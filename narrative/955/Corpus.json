Nigel wishes to use the money to pay off a mortgage on his estate\u00e2\u0080\u0094but the Duke of Buckingham and Prince Charles already have their eyes on it. The lord is drawn into the chaotic life of the court, and when he becomes an enemy of the profligate Lord Dalgarno, he finds himself in grave danger.\n\"Captain Clutterbuck\" is the imaginary author of The Fortunes of Nigel, as well as the patron to whom The Abbot is dedicated.David Ramsay, a watchmaker, lives with his daughter Margaret on Fleet Street. He has two apprentices, Mr Vincent and Mr Tunstall. The two apprentices had run off to join in a street fray, and the goldsmith George Heriot was gossiping with Ramsay, when they brought in a fellow named Richie Moniplies with a broken head and very tattered garments. His wound having been dressed, he explained that he had come to London with his master Nigel Olifaunt to obtain payment of a debt owing to him by the king, and had been set upon as a stranger. Next morning Nigel received a visit, at his lodging with the chandler and his wife, from the goldsmith, who had known his father, and, having warned him that his estate was in danger, lent him money to appear in proper attire in Court. Heriot proceeded to Whitehall, and, having presented the young lord's petition, King James authorised him to advance part of the sum due, and promised to interest himself in his affairs.\nDining with him the same day at the goldsmith's, in company with her father and Sir Mungo, Margaret lost her heart to Nigel, and employed Dame Ursula, the barber's wife, to ascertain all particulars respecting him. On being presented at Court by Lord Huntinglen he obtained an order for payment of his claim, and was introduced to the Duke of Buckingham, who announced himself as his enemy, and to the Duke's son, Lord Dalgarno, by whom he was initiated in all the vices of the aristocracy of that period, although warned by Richie, and by an anonymous letter. Meeting the Prince of Wales, later Charles I, in St. James's Park, attended by several courtiers, Nigel learnt from their manner, as well as from Sir Mungo, that he had been ill spoken of to Charles, upon which he challenged Dalgarno in the precincts of the Court, and was compelled to take refuge in Whitefriars to avoid arrest.\nHere he renewed his acquaintance with the barrister Lowestoffe, whom he had met at Beaujeu's tavern, and was assigned to the care of old Trapbois the lodging-house keeper and his daughter. On hearing of Nigel's trouble Margaret sought an interview with Lady Hermione, who occupied a suite of apartments in Heriot's mansion, and, having revealed her secret, was supplied with money to help him, being told at the same time by her confidant of the ill usage she had suffered from Lord Dalgarno. Vincent, who was in love with his master's daughter, and had been encouraged by Dame Ursula in extravagant habits, was now engaged by her to act as his rival's guide in effecting his escape from London. The same night old Trapbois was murdered by two ruffians who came to rob him; and, just as he had rescued the daughter, whom the bailiff Hildebrod had advised him to marry, Nigel was accosted by the apprentice, dressed as a waterman, from whom he learnt that a warrant had been issued for his apprehension, and that a boat was in readiness for him to give the king's officers the slip. Martha begged that she might accompany him, and, having secured her father's treasure, they were conducted by Vincent to the Temple Stairs. Having landed his companion at Paul's Wharf, where she was taken charge of by Moniplies, Nigel insisted on disembarking at Greenwich, instead of joining a Scotch vessel which was waiting for him at Gravesend; and having made his way to the park, he attended the king while he killed a deer, when he was recognised and consigned to the Tower.\nPresently Margaret, dressed as a boy, was shown into the same room; then the chandler came to claim his wife, whom he accused Nigel of having carried off; and, after he had dined, his friend Heriot arrived to reproach him with the position in which he had placed himself. He had also lost the king's warrant for his debt, and when his companion's disguise was detected, she saved him from further embarrassment by a full confession. One of her acts had been to present a petition to the king from Lady Hermione, on reading which he had commanded that Lord Dalgarno should instantly marry her; and another to offer such explanations respecting Nigel as induced his Majesty to pardon him. One hour only, however, remained within which to redeem his estates, when Moniplies appeared with the money, and Lord Dalgarno, who hoped to have secured them, was deprived of his revenge. The next day he was shot in Enfield Chase, where Captain Colepepper had planned to waylay him, as he was waiting, in company with Dame Nelly, and a page in charge of the treasure, to fight a duel with Nigel. Vincent and Lowestoffe, however, arrived in time to put two of the robbers to flight, while Moniplies killed the captain, who was suspected of having murdered Trapbois, and Christie recovered his wife. Nigel and Margaret were soon afterwards married; and as King James was honouring the feast with his presence, Richie presented Martha as his bride, who, at the same time, handed to the preserver of her life the deeds of the Glenvarloch estates, which she had freed from all liabilities, and the royal sign-manual which had been found among her father's papers.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Fortunes of Nigel, by Sir Walter Scott\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

But for those south of the Tweed, it may\nbe necessary to add, that the person so named was a wealthy citizen of\nEdinburgh, and the King's goldsmith, who followed James to the English\ncapital, and was so successful in his profession, as to die, in 1624,\nextremely wealthy for that period. He had no children; and after making\na full provision for such relations as might have claims upon him, he\nleft the residue of his fortune to establish an hospital, in which the\nsons of Edinburgh freemen are gratuitously brought up and educated for\nthe station to which their talents may recommend them, and are finally\nenabled to enter life under respectable auspices. The hospital in which\nthis charity is maintained is a noble quadrangle of the Gothic order,\nand as ornamental to the city as a building, as the manner in which the\nyouths are provided for and educated, renders it useful to the community\nas an institution. To the honour of those who have the management, (the\nMagistrates and Clergy of Edinburgh), the funds of the Hospital have\nincreased so much under their care, that it now supports and educates\none hundred and thirty youths annually, many of whom have done honour to\ntheir country in different situations.\n\nThe founder of such a charity as this may be reasonably supposed to have\nwalked through life with a steady pace, and an observant eye, neglecting\nno opportunity of assisting those who were not possessed of the\nexperience necessary for their own guidance. In supposing his\nefforts directed to the benefit of a young nobleman, misguided by the\naristocratic haughtiness of his own time, and the prevailing tone\nof selfish luxury which seems more peculiar to ours, as well as the\nseductions of pleasure which are predominant in all, some amusement,\nor even some advantage, might, I thought, be derived from the manner in\nwhich I might bring the exertions of this civic Mentor to bear in his\npupil's behalf. I am, I own, no great believer in the moral utility\nto be derived from fictitious compositions; yet, if in any case a word\nspoken in season may be of advantage to a young person, it must surely\nbe when it calls upon him to attend to the voice of principle and\nself-denial, instead of that of precipitate passion. I could not,\nindeed, hope or expect to represent my prudent and benevolent citizen\nin a point of view so interesting as that of the peasant girl, who\nnobly sacrificed her family affections to the integrity of her moral\ncharacter. Still however, something I hoped might be done not altogether\nunworthy the fame which George Heriot has secured by the lasting\nbenefits he has bestowed on his country.\n\nIt appeared likely, that out of this simple plot I might weave something\nattractive; because the reign of James I., in which George Heriot\nflourished, gave unbounded scope to invention in the fable, while at the\nsame time it afforded greater variety and discrimination of character\nthan could, with historical consistency, have been introduced, if the\nscene had been laid a century earlier. Lady Mary Wortley Montague has\nsaid, with equal truth and taste, that the most romantic region of every\ncountry is that where the mountains unite themselves with the plains or\nlowlands. For similiar reasons, it may be in like manner said, that the\nmost picturesque period of history is that when the ancient rough and\nwild manners of a barbarous age are just becoming innovated upon, and\ncontrasted, by the illumination of increased or revived learning, and\nthe instructions of renewed or reformed religion. The strong contrast\nproduced by the opposition of ancient manners to those which are\ngradually subduing them, affords the lights and shadows necessary to\ngive effect to a fictitious narrative; and while such a period entitles\nthe author to introduce incidents of a marvellous and improbable\ncharacter, as arising out of the turbulent independence and ferocity,\nbelonging to old habits of violence, still influencing the manners of\na people who had been so lately in a barbarous state; yet, on the other\nhand, the characters and sentiments of many of the actors may, with\nthe utmost probability, be described with great variety of shading and\ndelineation, which belongs to the newer and more improved period, of\nwhich the world has but lately received the light.\n\nThe reign of James I. of England possessed this advantage in a peculiar\ndegree. Some beams of chivalry, although its planet had been for some\ntime set, continued to animate and gild the horizon, and although\nprobably no one acted precisely on its Quixotic dictates, men and women\nstill talked the chivalrous language of Sir Philip Sydney's Arcadia; and\nthe ceremonial of the tilt-yard was yet exhibited, though it now only\nflourished as a Place de Carrousel. Here and there a high-spirited\nKnight of the Bath, witness the too scrupulous Lord Herbert of Cherbury,\nwas found devoted enough to the vows he had taken, to imagine himself\nobliged to compel, by the sword's-point, a fellow-knight or squire\nto restore the top-knot of ribbon which he had stolen from a fair\ndamsel;[Footnote: See Lord Herbert of Cherbury's Memoirs.] but yet,\nwhile men were taking each other's lives on such punctilios of honour,\nthe hour was already arrived when Bacon was about to teach the world\nthat they were no longer to reason from authority to fact, but to\nestablish truth by advancing from fact to fact, till they fixed an\nindisputable authority, not from hypothesis, but from experiment.\n\nThe state of society in the reign of James I. was also strangely\ndisturbed, and the license of a part of the community was perpetually\ngiving rise to acts of blood and violence. The bravo of the Queen's day,\nof whom Shakspeare has given us so many varieties, as Bardolph, Nym,\nPistol, Peto, and the other companions of Falstaff, men who had their\nhumours, or their particular turn of extravaganza, had, since the\ncommencement of the Low Country wars, given way to a race of sworders,\nwho used the rapier and dagger, instead of the far less dangerous sword\nand buckler; so that a historian says on this subject, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat private\nquarrels were nourished, but especially between the Scots and English;\nand duels in every street maintained; divers sects and peculiar titles\npassed unpunished and unregarded, as the sect of the Roaring Boys,\nBonaventors, Bravadors, Quarterors, and such like, being persons\nprodigal, and of great expense, who, having run themselves into debt,\nwere constrained to run next into factions, to defend themselves\nfrom danger of the law. These received countenance from divers of the\nnobility; and the citizens, through lasciviousness consuming their\nestates, it was like that the number [of these desperadoes] would rather\nincrease than diminish; and under these pretences they entered into many\ndesperate enterprizes, and scarce any durst walk in the street after\nnine at night. [Footnote: history of the First Fourteen Years of King\nJames's Reign. See Somers's Tracts, edited by Scott, vol. ii. p.266.]\n\nThe same authority assures us farther, that \u00e2\u0080\u009cancient gentlemen, who had\nleft their inheritance whole and well furnished with goods and chattels\n(having thereupon kept good houses) unto their sons, lived to see part\nconsumed in riot and excess, and the rest in possibility to be utterly\nlost; the holy state of matrimony made but a May-game, by which divers\nfamilies had been subverted; brothel houses much frequented, and even\ngreat persons, prostituting their bodies to the intent to satisfy their\nlusts, consumed their substance in lascivious appetites. And of\nall sorts, such knights and gentlemen, as either through pride or\nprodigality--had consumed their substance, repairing to the city, and to\nthe intent to consume their virtue also, lived dissolute lives; many\nof their ladies and daughters, to the intent to maintain themselves\naccording to their dignity, prostituting their bodies in shameful\nmanner. Ale-houses, dicing-houses, taverns, and places of iniquity,\nbeyond manner abounding in most places.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNor is it only in the pages of a puritanical, perhaps a satirical\nwriter, that we find so shocking and disgusting a picture of the\ncoarseness of the beginning of the seventeenth century. On the contrary,\nin all the comedies of the age, the principal character for gaiety and\nwit is a young heir, who has totally altered the establishment of\nthe father to whom he has succeeded, and, to use the old simile, who\nresembles a fountain, which plays off in idleness and extravagance\nthe wealth which its careful parents painfully had assembled in hidden\nreservoirs.\n\nAnd yet, while that spirit of general extravagance seemed at work over\na whole kingdom, another and very different sort of men were gradually\nforming the staid and resolved characters, which afterwards displayed\nthemselves during the civil wars, and powerfully regulated and affected\nthe character of the whole English nation, until, rushing from one\nextreme to another, they sunk in a gloomy fanaticism the splendid traces\nof the reviving fine arts.\n\nFrom the quotations which I have produced, the selfish and disgusting\nconduct of Lord Dalgarno will not perhaps appear overstrained; nor will\nthe scenes in Whitefriars and places of similar resort seem too highly\ncoloured. This indeed is far from being the case. It was in James I.'s\nreign that vice first appeared affecting the better classes in its\ngross and undisguised depravity. The entertainments and amusements of\nElizabeth's time had an air of that decent restraint which became the\ncourt of a maiden sovereign; and, in that earlier period, to use the\nwords of Burke, vice lost half its evil by being deprived of all its\ngrossness. In James's reign, on the contrary, the coarsest pleasures\nwere publicly and unlimitedly indulged, since, according to Sir John\nHarrington, the men wallowed in beastly delights; and even ladies\nabandoned their delicacy and rolled about in intoxication. After a\nludicrous account of a mask, in which the actors had got drunk, and\nbehaved themselves accordingly, he adds, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have much marvelled at these\nstrange pageantries, and they do bring to my recollection what passed of\nthis sort in our Queen's days, in which I was sometimes an assistant and\npartaker: but never did I see such lack of good order and sobriety as I\nhave now done. The gunpowder fright is got out of all our heads, and we\nare going on hereabout as if the devil was contriving every man should\nblow up himself by wild riot, excess, and devastation of time and\ntemperance. The great ladies do go well masqued; and indeed, it be the\nonly show of their modesty to conceal their countenance, but alack, they\nmeet with such countenance to uphold their strange doings, that I marvel\nnot at aught that happens.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Footnote: Harrington's Nugae Antique, vol.\nii. p. 352. For the gross debauchery of the period, too much encouraged\nby the example of the monarch, who was, in other respects, neither\nwithout talent nor a good-natured disposition, see Winwood's Memorials,\nHowell's Letters, and other Memorials of the time; but particularly,\nconsult the Private Letters and Correspondence of Steenie, _alias_\nBuckingham, with his reverend Dad and Gossip, King James, which abound\nwith the grossest as well as the most childish language. The learned Mr.\nD'Israeli, in an attempt to vindicate the character of James, has\nonly succeeded in obtaining for himself the character of a skilful and\ningenious advocate, without much advantage to his royal client]\n\nSuch being the state of the court, coarse sensuality brought along with\nit its ordinary companion, a brutal degree of undisguised selfishness,\ndestructive alike of philanthropy and good breeding; both of which, in\ntheir several spheres, depend upon the regard paid by each individual\nto the interest as well as the feelings of others. It is in such a time\nthat the heartless and shameless man of wealth and power may, like the\nsupposed Lord Dalgarno, brazen out the shame of his villainies, and\naffect to triumph in their consequences, so long as they were personally\nadvantageous to his own pleasures or profit.\n\nAlsatia is elsewhere explained as a cant name for Whitefriars, which,\npossessing certain privileges of sanctuary, became for that reason a\nnest of those mischievous characters who were generally obnoxious to the\nlaw. These privileges were derived from its having been an establishment\nof the Carmelites, or White Friars, founded says Stow, in his Survey\nof London, by Sir Patrick Grey, in 1241. Edward I. gave them a plot of\nground in Fleet Street, to build their church upon. The edifice then\nerected was rebuilt by Courtney, Earl of Devonshire, in the reign of\nEdward. In the time of the Reformation the place retained its immunities\nas a sanctuary, and James I. confirmed and added to them by a charter\nin 1608. Shadwell was the first author who made some literary use of\nWhitefriars, in his play of the Squire of Alsatia, which turns upon the\nplot of the Adelphi of Terence.\n\nIn this old play, two men of fortune, brothers, educate two young men,\n(sons to the one and nephews to the other,) each under his own separate\nsystem of rigour and indulgence. The elder of the subjects of this\nexperiment, who has been very rigidly brought up, falls at once into\nall the vices of the town, is debauched by the cheats and bullies of\nWhitefriars, and, in a word, becomes the Squire of Alsatia. The poet\ngives, as the natural and congenial inhabitants of the place, such\ncharacters as the reader will find in the note. [Footnote: \u00e2\u0080\u009cCheatly, a\nrascal, who by reason of debts dares not stir out of Whitefriars, but\nthere inveigles young heirs of entail, and helps them to goods and money\nupon great disadvantages, is bound for them, and shares with them till\nhe undoes them. A lewd, impudent, debauched fellow, very expert in the\ncant about town.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShamwell, cousin to the Belfords, who, being ruined by Cheatly, is made\na decoy-duck for others, not daring to stir out of Alsatia, where he\nlives. Is bound with Cheatly for heirs, and lives upon them a dissolute\ndebauched life.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCaptain Hackum, a blockheaded bully of Alsatia, a cowardly, impudent,\nblustering fellow, formerly a sergeant in Flanders, who has run from his\ncolours, and retreated into Whitefriars for a very small debt, where by\nthe Alsatians he is dubb'd a captain, marries one that lets lodgings,\nsells cherry-brandy, and is a bawd.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cScrapeall a hypocritical, repeating, praying, psalm-singing, precise\nfellow, pretending to great piety; a godly knave, who joins with\nCheatly, and supplies young heirs with goods, and money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--Dramatis\nPersonae to the Squire of Alsatia, SHADWELL'S Works, vol. iv.] The play,\nas we learn from the dedication to the Earl of Dorset and Middlesex, was\nsuccessful above the author's expectations, \u00e2\u0080\u009cno comedy these many years\nhaving filled the theatre so long together. And I had the great honour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n continues Shadwell, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto find so many friends, that the house was never\nso full since it was built as upon the third day of this play, and vast\nnumbers went away that could not be admitted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Footnote: Dedication to\nthe Squire of Alsatia, Shadwell's Works, vol. iv.] From the Squire of\nAlsatia the author derived some few hints, and learned the footing\non which the bullies and thieves of the Sanctuary stood with their\nneighbours, the fiery young students of the Temple, of which some\nintimation is given in the dramatic piece.\n\nSuch are the materials to which the author stands indebted for the\ncomposition of the Fortunes of Nigel, a novel, which may be perhaps one\nof those that are more amusing on a second perusal, than when read a\nfirst time for the sake of the story, the incidents of which are few and\nmeagre.\n\nThe Introductory Epistle is written, in Lucio's phrase, \u00e2\u0080\u009caccording\nto the trick,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and would never have appeared had the writer meditated\nmaking his avowal of the work. As it is the privilege of a masque or\nincognito to speak in a feigned voice and assumed character, the author\nattempted, while in disguise, some liberties of the same sort; and while\nhe continues to plead upon the various excuses which the introduction\ncontains, the present acknowledgment must serve as an apology for a\nspecies of \u00e2\u0080\u009choity toity, whisky frisky\u00e2\u0080\u009d pertness of manner, which, in\nhis avowed character, the author should have considered as a departure\nfrom the rules of civility and good taste.\n\n\nABBOTSFORD.\n\n1st July, 1831.\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTORY EPISTLE\n\nCAPTAIN CLUTTERBUCK TO THE REVEREND DR. DRYASDUST\n\nDEAR SIR,\n\nI readily accept of, and reply to the civilities with which you have\nbeen pleased to honour me in your obliging letter, and entirely agree\nwith your quotation, of _\u00e2\u0080\u009cQuam bonum et quam jucundum!\u00e2\u0080\u009d_ We may indeed\nesteem ourselves as come of the same family, or, according to our\ncountry proverb, as being all one man's bairns; and there needed no\napology on your part, reverend and dear sir, for demanding of me any\ninformation which I may be able to supply respecting the subject of your\ncuriosity. The interview which you allude to took place in the course\nof last winter, and is so deeply imprinted on my recollection, that it\nrequires no effort to collect all its most minute details.\n\nYou are aware that the share which I had in introducing the Romance,\ncalled THE MONASTERY, to public notice, has given me a sort of character\nin the literature of our Scottish metropolis. I no longer stand in\nthe outer shop of our bibliopolists, bargaining for the objects of my\ncuriosity with an unrespective shop-lad, hustled among boys who come to\nbuy Corderies and copy-books, and servant girls cheapening a pennyworth\nof paper, but am cordially welcomed by the bibliopolist himself, with,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPray, walk into the back-shop, Captain. Boy, get a chair for Captain\nClutterbuck. There is the newspaper, Captain--to-day's paper;\u00e2\u0080\u009d or, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere\nis the last new work--there is a folder, make free with the leaves;\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n or, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPut it in your pocket and carry it home;\u00e2\u0080\u009d or, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will make a\nbookseller of you, sir, and you shall have it at trade price.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Or,\nperhaps if it is the worthy trader's own publication, his liberality\nmay even extend itself to--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever mind booking such a trifle to\n_you_, sir--it is an over-copy. Pray, mention the work to your reading\nfriends.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I say nothing of the snug well-selected literary party\narranged round a turbot, leg of five-year-old mutton, or some such gear,\nor of the circulation of a quiet bottle of Robert Cockburn's choicest\nblack--nay, perhaps, of his new ones. All these are comforts reserved\nto such as are freemen of the corporation of letters, and I have the\nadvantage of enjoying them in perfection. But all things change under\nthe sun; and it is with no ordinary feelings of regret, that, in my\nannual visits to the metropolis, I now miss the social and warm-hearted\nwelcome of the quick-witted and kindly friend who first introduced me to\nthe public; who had more original wit than would have set up a dozen of\nprofessed sayers of good things, and more racy humour than would have\nmade the fortune of as many more. To this great deprivation has been\nadded, I trust for a time only, the loss of another bibliopolical\nfriend, whose vigorous intellect, and liberal ideas, have not only\nrendered his native country the mart of her own literature, but\nestablished there a Court of Letters, which must command respect, even\nfrom those most inclined to dissent from many of its canons. The effect\nof these changes, operated in a great measure by the strong sense and\nsagacious calculations of an individual, who knew how to avail himself,\nto an unhoped-for extent, of the various kinds of talent which his\ncountry produced, will probably appear more clearly to the generation\nwhich shall follow the present.\n\nI entered the shop at the Cross, to enquire after the health of my\nworthy friend, and learned with satisfaction, that his residence in the\nsouth had abated the rigour of the symptoms of his disorder. Availing\nmyself, then, of the privileges to which I have alluded, I strolled\nonward in that labyrinth of small dark rooms, or _crypts_, to speak our\nown antiquarian language, which form the extensive back-settlements of\nthat celebrated publishing-house. Yet, as I proceeded from one obscure\nrecess to another, filled, some of them with old volumes, some with such\nas, from the equality of their rank on the shelves, I suspected to be\nthe less saleable modern books of the concern, I could not help feeling\na holy horror creep upon me, when I thought of the risk of intruding on\nsome ecstatic bard giving vent to his poetical fury; or it might be,\non the yet more formidable privacy of a band of critics, in the act of\nworrying the game which they had just run down. In such a supposed case,\nI felt by anticipation the horrors of the Highland seers, whom their\ngift of deuteroscopy compels to witness things unmeet for mortal eye;\nand who, to use the expression of Collins,\n\n     ----\u00e2\u0080\u009cheartless, oft, like moody madness, stare,\n     To see the phantom train their secret work prepare.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nStill, however, the irresistible impulse of an undefined curiosity\ndrove me on through this succession of darksome chambers, till, like the\njeweller of Delhi in the house of the magician Bennaskar, I at length\nreached a vaulted room, dedicated to secrecy and silence, and beheld,\nseated by a lamp, and employed in reading a. blotted _revise_,\n[Footnote: The uninitiated must be informed, that a second proof-sheet\nis so called.] the person, or perhaps I should rather say the Eidolon,\nor representative Vision of the AUTHOR OF WAVERLEY! You will not be\nsurprised at the filial instinct which enabled me at once to acknowledge\nthe features borne by this venerable apparition, and that I at once\nbended the knee, with the classical salutation of, _Salve, magne\nparens!_ The vision, however, cut me short, by pointing to a seat,\nintimating at the same time, that my presence was not expected, and that\nhe had something to say to me.\n\nI sat down with humble obedience, and endeavoured to note the features\nof him with whom I now found myself so unexpectedly in society. But on\nthis point I can give your reverence no satisfaction; for, besides the\nobscurity of the apartment, and the fluttered state of my own nerves, I\nseemed to myself overwhelmed by a sense of filial awe, which prevented\nmy noting and recording what it is probable the personage before me\nmight most desire to have concealed. Indeed, his figure was so closely\nveiled and wimpled, either with a mantle, morning-gown, or some such\nloose garb, that the verses of Spenser might well have been applied--\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cYet, certes, by her face and physnomy,\n     Whether she man or woman only were,\n     That could not any creature well descry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI must, however, go on as I have begun, to apply the masculine gender;\nfor, notwithstanding very ingenious reasons, and indeed something like\npositive evidence, have been offered to prove the Author of Waverley to\nbe two ladies of talent, I must abide by the general opinion, that he is\nof the rougher sex. There are in his writings too many things\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cQuae maribus sola tribuuntur,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nto permit me to entertain any doubt on that subject. I will proceed, in\nthe manner of dialogue, to repeat as nearly as I can what passed betwixt\nus, only observing, that in the course of the conversation, my timidity\nimperceptibly gave way under the familiarity of his address; and that,\nin the concluding part of our dialogue, I perhaps argued with fully as\nmuch confidence as was beseeming.\n\n_Author of Waverley._ I was willing to see you, Captain Clutterbuck,\nbeing the person of my family whom I have most regard for, since the\ndeath of Jedediah Cleishbotham; and I am afraid I may have done you some\nwrong, in assigning to you The Monastery as a portion of my effects. I\nhave some thoughts of making it up to you, by naming you godfather\nto this yet unborn babe--(he indicated the proof-sheet with his\nfinger)--But first, touching The Monastery--How says the world--you are\nabroad and can learn?\n\n_Captain Clutterbuck._ Hem! hem!--The enquiry is delicate--I have not\nheard any complaints from the Publishers.\n\n_Author._ That is the principal matter; but yet an indifferent work is\nsometimes towed on by those which have left harbour before it, with the\nbreeze in their poop.--What say the Critics?\n\n_Captain._ There is a general--feeling--that the White Lady is no\nfavourite.\n\n_Author._ I think she is a failure myself; but rather in execution than\nconception. Could I have evoked an _esprit follet_, at the same time\nfantastic and interesting, capricious and kind; a sort of wildfire of\nthe elements, bound by no fixed laws, or motives of action; faithful and\nfond, yet teazing and uncertain----\n\n_Captain._ If you will pardon the interruption, sir, I think you are\ndescribing a pretty woman.\n\n_Author._ On my word, I believe I am. I must invest my elementary\nspirits with a little human flesh and blood--they are too fine-drawn for\nthe present taste of the public.\n\n_Captain._ They object, too, that the object of your Nixie ought to\nhave been more uniformly noble--Her ducking the priest was no Naiad-like\namusement.\n\n_Author._ Ah! they ought to allow for the capriccios of what is, after\nall, but a better sort of goblin. The bath into which Ariel, the most\ndelicate creation of Shakspeare's imagination, seduces our jolly friend\nTrinculo, was not of amber or rose-water. But no one shall find me\nrowing against the stream. I care not who knows it--I write for general\namusement; and, though I never will aim at popularity by what I think\nunworthy means, I will not, on the other hand, be pertinacious in the\ndefence of my own errors against the voice of the public.\n\n_Captain._ You abandon, then, in the present work--(looking, in my turn,\ntowards the proof-sheet)--the mystic, and the magical, and the whole\nsystem of signs, wonders, and omens? There are no dreams, or presages,\nor obscure allusions to future events?\n\n_Author._ Not a Cock-lane scratch, my son--not one bounce on the drum of\nTedworth--not so much as the poor tick of a solitary death-watch in\nthe wainscot. All is clear and above board--a Scots metaphysician might\nbelieve every word of it.\n\n_Captain._ And the story is, I hope, natural and probable; commencing\nstrikingly, proceeding naturally, ending happily--like the course of a\nfamed river, which gushes from the mouth of some obscure and romantic\ngrotto--then gliding on, never pausing, never precipitating its course,\nvisiting, as it were, by natural instinct, whatever worthy subjects of\ninterest are presented by the country through which it passes--widening\nand deepening in interest as it flows on; and at length arriving at\nthe final catastrophe as at some mighty haven, where ships of all kinds\nstrike sail and yard?\n\n_Author._ Hey! hey! what the deuce is all this? Why, 'tis Ercles' vein,\nand it would require some one much more like Hercules than I, to produce\na story which should gush, and glide, and never pause, and visit, and\nwiden, and deepen, and all the rest on't. I should be chin-deep in the\ngrave, man, before I had done with my task; and, in the meanwhile, all\nthe quirks and quiddities which I might have devised for my reader's\namusement, would lie rotting in my gizzard, like Sancho's suppressed\nwitticisms, when he was under his master's displeasure.--There never was\na novel written on this plan while the world stood.\n\n_Captain._ Pardon me--Tom Jones.\n\n_Author._ True, and perhaps Amelia also. Fielding had high notions of\nthe dignity of an art which he may be considered as having founded. He\nchallenges a comparison between the Novel and the Epic. Smollett, Le\nSage, and others, emancipating themselves from the strictness of\nthe rules he has laid down, have written rather a history of the\nmiscellaneous adventures which befall an individual in the course of\nlife, than the plot of a regular and connected epopeia, where every step\nbrings us a point nearer to the final catastrophe. These great masters\nhave been satisfied if they amused the reader upon the road; though the\nconclusion only arrived because the tale must have an end--just as the\ntraveller alights at the inn, because it is evening.\n\n_Captain._ A very commodious mode of travelling, for the author at\nleast. In short, sir, you are of opinion with Bayes--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat the devil\ndoes the plot signify, except to bring in fine things?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n_Author._ Grant that I were so, and that I should write with sense and\nspirit a few scenes unlaboured and loosely put together, but which had\nsufficient interest in them to amuse in one corner the pain of body; in\nanother, to relieve anxiety of mind; in a third place, to unwrinkle a\nbrow bent with the furrows of daily toil; in another, to fill the place\nof bad thoughts, or to suggest better; in yet another, to induce an\nidler to study the history of his country; in all, save where the\nperusal interrupted the discharge of serious duties, to furnish harmless\namusement,--might not the author of such a work, however inartificially\nexecuted, plead for his errors and negligences the excuse of the slave,\nwho, about to be punished for having spread the false report of a\nvictory, saved himself by exclaiming--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAm I to blame, O Athenians, who\nhave given you one happy day?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n_Captain._ Will your goodness permit me to mention an anecdote of my\nexcellent grandmother?\n\n_Author._ I see little she can have to do with the subject, Captain\nClutterbuck.\n\n_Captain._ It may come into our dialogue on Bayes's plan.--The sagacious\nold lady--rest her soul!--was a good friend to the church, and could\nnever hear a minister maligned by evil tongues, without taking his\npart warmly. There was one fixed point, however, at which she always\nabandoned the cause of her reverend _protege_--it was so soon as\nshe learned he had preached a regular sermon against slanderers and\nbackbiters.\n\n_Author._ And what is that to the purpose?\n\n_Captain._ Only that I have heard engineers say, that one may betray the\nweak point to the enemy, by too much ostentation of fortifying it.\n\n_Author._ And, once more I pray, what is that to the purpose?\n\n_Captain._ Nay, then, without farther metaphor, I am afraid this new\nproduction, in which your generosity seems willing to give me some\nconcern, will stand much in need of apology, since you think proper to\nbegin your defence before the case is on trial.-The story is hastily\nhuddled up, I will venture a pint of claret.\n\n_Author._ A pint of port, I suppose you mean?\n\n_Captain._ I say of claret--good claret of the Monastery. Ah, sir, would\nyou but take the advice of your friends, and try to deserve at least\none-half of the public favour you have met with, we might all drink\nTokay!\n\n_Author._ I care not what I drink, so the liquor be wholesome.\n\n_Captain._ Care for your reputation, then,--for your fame.\n\n_Author._ My fame?--I will answer you as a very ingenious, able, and\nexperienced friend, being counsel for the notorious Jem MacCoul, replied\nto the opposite side of the bar, when they laid weight on his client's\nrefusing to answer certain queries, which they said any man who had a\nregard for his reputation would not hesitate to reply to. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy client,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said he-by the way, Jem was standing behind him at the time, and a rich\nscene it was-\u00e2\u0080\u009cis so unfortunate as to have no regard for his reputation;\nand I should deal very uncandidly with the Court, should I say he had\nany that was worth his attention.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--I am, though from very different\nreasons, in Jem's happy state of indifference. Let fame follow those who\nhave a substantial shape. A shadow--and an impersonal author is nothing\nbetter--can cast no shade.\n\n_Captain._ You are not now, perhaps, so impersonal as here-tofore. These\nLetters to the Member for the University of Oxford--_Author._ Show the\nwit, genius, and delicacy of the author, which I heartily wish to see\nengaged on a subject of more importance; and show, besides, that the\npreservation of my character of _incongnito_ has engaged early talent in\nthe discussion of a curious question of evidence. But a cause, however\ningeniously pleaded, is not therefore gained. You may remember, the\nneatly-wrought chain of circumstantial evidence, so artificially brought\nforward to prove Sir Philip Francis's title to the Letters of Junius,\nseemed at first irrefragable; yet the influence of the reasoning has\npassed away, and Junius, in the general opinion, is as much unknown as\never. But on this subject I will not be soothed or provoked into saying\none word more. To say who I am not, would be one step towards saying\nwho I am; and as I desire not, any more than a certain justice of peace\nmentioned by Shenstone, the noise or report such things make in the\nworld, I shall continue to be silent on a subject, which, in my opinion,\nis very undeserving the noise that has been made about it, and still\nmore unworthy of the serious employment of such ingenuity as has been\ndisplayed by the young letter-writer.\n\n_Captain._ But allowing, my dear sir, that you care not for your\npersonal reputation, or for that of any literary person upon whose\nshoulders your faults may be visited, allow me to say, that common\ngratitude to the public, which has received you so kindly, and to the\ncritics, who have treated you so leniently, ought to induce you to\nbestow more pains on your story.\n\n_Author._ I do entreat you, my son, as Dr. Johnson would have said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cfree your mind from cant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For the critics, they have their business,\nand I mine; as the nursery proverb goes--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe children in Holland take pleasure in making What the children in\nEngland take pleasure in breaking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI am their humble jackal, too busy in providing food for them, to have\ntime for considering whether they swallow or reject it.--To the public,\nI stand pretty nearly in the relation of the postman who leaves a packet\nat the door of an individual. If it contains pleasing intelligence, a\nbillet from a mistress, a letter from an absent son, a remittance from\na correspondent supposed to be bankrupt,--the letter is acceptably\nwelcome, and read and re-read, folded up, filed, and safely deposited in\nthe bureau. If the contents are disagreeable, if it comes from a dun or\nfrom a bore, the correspondent is cursed, the letter is thrown into the\nfire, and the expense of postage is heartily regretted; while all the\ntime the bearer of the dispatches is, in either case, as little thought\non as the snow of last Christmas. The utmost extent of kindness between\nthe author and the public which can really exist, is, that the world are\ndisposed to be somewhat indulgent to the succeeding works of an original\nfavourite, were it but on account of the habit which the public mind has\nacquired; while the author very naturally thinks well of _their_ taste,\nwho have so liberally applauded _his_ productions. But I deny there is\nany call for gratitude, properly so called, either on one side or the\nother.\n\n_Captain._ Respect to yourself, then, ought to teach caution.\n\n_Author._ Ay, if caution could augment the chance of my success. But,\nto confess to you the truth, the works and passages in which I have\nsucceeded, have uniformly been written with the greatest rapidity; and\nwhen I have seen some of these placed in opposition with others, and\ncommended as more highly finished, I could appeal to pen and standish,\nthat the parts in which I have come feebly off, were by much the more\nlaboured. Besides, I doubt the beneficial effect of too much delay, both\non account of the author and the public. A man should strike while the\niron is hot, and hoist sail while the wind is fair. If a successful\nauthor keep not the stage, another instantly takes his ground. If\na writer lie by for ten years ere he produces a second work, he is\nsuperseded by others; or, if the age is so poor of genius that this does\nnot happen, his own reputation becomes his greatest obstacle. The public\nwill expect the new work to be ten times better than its predecessor;\nthe author will expect it should be ten times more popular, and 'tis a\nhundred to ten that both are disappointed.\n\n_Captain_. This may justify a certain degree of rapidity in publication,\nbut not that which is proverbially said to be no speed. You should take\ntime at least to arrange your story.\n\n_Author_. That is a sore point with me, my son. Believe me, I have not\nbeen fool enough to neglect ordinary precautions. I have repeatedly laid\ndown my future work to scale, divided it into volumes and chapters,\nand endeavoured to construct a story which I meant should evolve itself\ngradually and strikingly, maintain suspense, and stimulate curiosity;\nand which, finally, should terminate in a striking catastrophe. But I\nthink there is a demon who seats himself on the feather of my pen when I\nbegin to write, and leads it astray from the purpose. Characters expand\nunder my hand; incidents are multiplied; the story lingers, while the\nmaterials increase; my regular mansion turns out a Gothic anomaly, and\nthe work is closed long before I have attained the point I proposed.\n\n_Captain_. Resolution and determined forbearance might remedy that evil.\n\n_Author_. Alas! my dear sir, you do not know the force of paternal\naffection. When I light on such a character as Bailie Jarvie, or\nDalgetty, my imagination brightens, and my conception becomes clearer\nat every step which I take in his company, although it leads me many\na weary mile away from the regular road, and forces me leap hedge and\nditch to get back into the route again. If I resist the temptation,\nas you advise me, my thoughts become prosy, flat, and dull; I write\npainfully to myself, and under a consciousness of flagging which makes\nme flag still more; the sunshine with which fancy had invested the\nincidents, departs from them, and leaves every thing dull and gloomy.\nI am no more the same author I was in my better mood, than the dog in a\nwheel, condemned to go round and round for hours, is like the same\ndog merrily chasing his own tail, and gambolling in all the frolic of\nunrestrained freedom. In short, sir, on such occasions, I think I am\nbewitched.\n\n_Captain_. Nay, sir, if you plead sorcery, there is no more to be\nsaid--he must needs go whom the devil drives. And this, I suppose, sir,\nis the reason why you do not make the theatrical attempt to which you\nhave been so often urged?\n\n_Author_. It may pass for one good reason for not writing a play, that\nI cannot form a plot. But the truth is, that the idea adopted by too\nfavourable judges, of my having some aptitude for that department of\npoetry, has been much founded on those scraps of old plays, which,\nbeing taken from a source inaccessible to collectors, they have hastily\nconsidered the offspring of my mother-wit. Now, the manner in which I\nbecame possessed of these fragments is so extraordinary, that I cannot\nhelp telling it to you.\n\nYou must know, that, some twenty years since, I went down to visit an\nold friend in Worcestershire, who had served with me in the----Dragoons.\n\n_Captain._ Then you _have_ served, sir?\n\n_Author._ I have--or I have not, which signifies the same thing--Captain\nis a good travelling name.--I found my friend's house unexpectedly\ncrowded with guests, and, as usual, was condemned--the mansion being\nan old one--to the _haunted apartment._ I have, as a great modern said,\nseen too many ghosts to believe in them, so betook myself seriously\nto my repose, lulled by the wind rustling among the lime-trees, the\nbranches of which chequered the moonlight which fell on the floor\nthrough the diamonded casement, when, behold, a darker shadow interposed\nitself, and I beheld visibly on the floor of the apartment--\n\n_Captain._ The White Lady of Avenel, I suppose?--You have told the very\nstory before.\n\n_Author._ No--I beheld a female form, with mob-cap, bib, and apron,\nsleeves tucked up to the elbow, a dredging-box in the one hand, and in\nthe other a sauce-ladle. I concluded, of course, that it was my friend's\ncook-maid walking in her sleep; and as I knew he had a value for Sally,\nwho could toss a pancake with any girl in the country, I got up\nto conduct her safely to the door. But as I approached her, she\nsaid,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cHold, sir! I am not what you take me for;\u00e2\u0080\u009d--words which seemed\nso opposite to the circumstances, that I should not have much minded\nthem, had it not been for the peculiarly hollow sound in which they were\nuttered.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cKnow, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, in the same unearthly accents, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat\nI am the spirit of Betty Barnes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho hanged herself for love of the\nstage-coachman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought I; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is a proper spot of work!\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf that\nunhappy Elizabeth or Betty Barnes, long cook-maid to Mr. Warburton, the\npainful collector, but ah! the too careless custodier, of the largest\ncollection of ancient plays ever known--of most of which the titles only\nare left to gladden the Prolegomena of the Variorum Shakspeare. Yes,\nstranger, it was these ill-fated hands That consigned to grease and\nconflagration the scores of small quartos, which, did they now exist,\nwould drive the whole Roxburghe Club out of their senses--it was these\nunhappy pickers and stealers that singed fat fowls and wiped dirty\ntrenchers with the lost works of Beaumont and Fletcher, Massinger,\nJonson, Webster--what shall I say?--even of Shakspeare himself!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLike every dramatic antiquary, my ardent curiosity after some play named\nin the Book of the Master of Revels, had often been checked by finding\nthe object of my research numbered amongst the holocaust of victims\nwhich this unhappy woman had sacrificed to the God of Good Cheer. It is\nno wonder then, that, like the Hermit of Parnell,\n\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009cI broke the bands of fear, and madly cried,\n       'You careless jade!'--But scarce the words began,\n       When Betty brandish'd high her saucing-pan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBeware,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou do not, by your ill-timed anger, cut off the\nopportunity I yet have to indemnify the world for the errors of my\nignorance. In yonder coal-hole, not used for many a year, repose the few\ngreasy and blackened fragments of the elder Drama which were not totally\ndestroyed. Do thou then\u00e2\u0080\u009d--Why, what do you stare at, Captain? By my\nsoul, it is true; as my friend Major Longbow says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat should I tell\nyou a lie for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n_Captain._ Lie, sir! Nay, Heaven forbid I should apply the word to a\nperson so veracious. You are only inclined to chase your tail a little\nthis morning, that's all. Had you not better reserve this legend to form\nan introduction to \u00e2\u0080\u009cThree Recovered Dramas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or so?\n\n_Author._ You are quite right--habit's a strange thing, my son. I had\nforgot whom I was speaking to. Yes, Plays for the closet, not for the\nstage--\n\n_Captain._ Right, and so you are sure to be acted; for the managers,\nwhile thousands of volunteers are desirous of serving them, are\nwonderfully partial to pressed men.\n\n_Author._ I am a living witness, having been, like a second Laberius,\nmade a dramatist whether I would or not. I believe my muse would be\n_Terry_-fied into treading the stage, even if I should write a sermon.\n\n_Captain._ Truly, if you did, I am afraid folks might make a farce\nof it; and, therefore, should you change your style, I still advise a\nvolume of dramas like Lord Byron's.\n\n_Author._ No, his lordship is a cut above me--I won't run my horse\nagainst his, if I can help myself. But there is my friend Allan has\nwritten just such a play as I might write myself, in a very sunny day,\nand with one of Bramah's extra-patent pens. I cannot make neat work\nwithout such appurtenances.\n\n_Captain._ Do you mean Allan Ramsay?\n\n_Author._ No, nor Barbara Allan either. I mean Allan Cunningham, who\nhas just published his tragedy of Sir Marmaduke Maxwell, full of\nmerry-making and murdering, kissing and cutting of throats, and passages\nwhich lead to nothing, and which are very pretty passages for all\nthat. Not a glimpse of probability is there about the plot, but so much\nanimation in particular passages, and such a vein of poetry through the\nwhole, as I dearly wish I could infuse into my Culinary Remains, should\nI ever be tempted to publish them. With a popular impress, people would\nread and admire the beauties of Allan--as it is, they may perhaps only\nnote his defects--or, what is worse, not note him at all.--But\nnever mind them, honest Allan; you are a credit to Caledonia for all\nthat.--There are some lyrical effusions of his, too, which you would do\nwell to read, Captain. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's hame, and it's hame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is equal to Burns.\n\n_Captain._ I will take the hint. The club at Kennaquhair are turned\nfastidious since Catalan! visited the Abbey. My \u00e2\u0080\u009cPoortith Cauld\u00e2\u0080\u009d has\nbeen received both poorly and coldly, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Banks of Bonnie Doon\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n have been positively coughed down--_Tempora mutantur._\n\n_Author._ They cannot stand still, they will change with all of us. What\nthen?\n\n                 \u00e2\u0080\u009cA man's a man for a' that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut the hour of parting approaches.\n\n_Captain._ You are determined to proceed then in your own system?\nAre you aware that an unworthy motive may be assigned for this rapid\nsuccession of publication? You will be supposed to work merely for the\nlucre of gain.\n\n_Author._ Supposing that I did permit the great advantages which must\nbe derived from success in literature, to join with other motives in\ninducing me to come more frequently before the public,--that emolument\nis the voluntary tax which the public pays for a certain species of\nliterary amusement--it is extorted from no one, and paid, I presume,\nby those only who can afford it, and who receive gratification in\nproportion to the expense. If the capital sum which these volumes have\nput into circulation be a very large one, has it contributed to my\nindulgences only? or can I not say to hundreds, from honest Duncan the\npaper-manufacturer, to the most snivelling of the printer's devils,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDidst thou not share? Hadst thou not fifteen pence?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I profess I think\nour Modern Athens much obliged to me for having established such an\nextensive manufacture; and when universal suffrage comes in fashion,\nI intend to stand for a seat in the House on the interest of all the\nunwashed artificers connected with literature.\n\n_Captain._ This would be called the language of a calico-manufacturer.\n\n_Author._ Cant again, my dear son--there is lime in this sack,\ntoo--nothing but sophistication in this world! I do say it, in spite of\nAdam Smith and his followers, that a successful author is a productive\nlabourer, and that his works constitute as effectual a part of the\npublic wealth, as that which is created by any other manufacture. If a\nnew commodity, having an actually intrinsic and commercial value, be\nthe result of the operation, why are the author's bales of books to be\nesteemed a less profitable part of the public stock than the goods of\nany other manufacturer? I speak with reference to the diffusion of the\nwealth arising to the public, and the degree of industry which even such\na trifling work as the present must stimulate and reward, before the\nvolumes leave the publisher's shop. Without me it could not exist,\nand to this extent I am a benefactor to the country. As for my own\nemolument, it is won by my toil, and I account myself answerable to\nHeaven only for the mode in which I expend it. The candid may hope it is\nnot all dedicated to selfish purposes; and, without much pretensions to\nmerit in him who disburses it, a part may \u00e2\u0080\u009cwander, heaven-directed, to\nthe poor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n_Captain._ Yet it is generally held base to write from the mere motives\nof gain.\n\n_Author._ It would be base to do so exclusively, or even to make it a\nprincipal motive for literary exertion. Nay, I will venture to say,\nthat no work of imagination, proceeding from the mere consideration of\na certain sum of copy-money, ever did, or ever will, succeed. So the\nlawyer who pleads, the soldier who fights, the physician who prescribes,\nthe clergyman--if such there be--who preaches, without any zeal for his\nprofession, or without any sense of its dignity, and merely on account\nof the fee, pay, or stipend, degrade themselves to the rank of sordid\nmechanics. Accordingly, in the case of two of the learned faculties\nat least, their services are considered as unappreciable, and are\nacknowledged, not by any exact estimate of the services rendered, but by\na _honorarium,_ or voluntary acknowledgment. But let a client or patient\nmake the experiment of omitting this little ceremony of the honorarium,\nwhich is _cense_ to be a thing entirely out of consideration between\nthem, and mark how the learned gentleman will look upon his case. Cant\nset apart, it is the same thing with literary emolument. No man of\nsense, in any rank of life, is, or ought to be, above accepting a just\nrecompense for his time, and a reasonable share of the capital which\nowes its very existence to his exertions. When Czar Peter wrought in the\ntrenches, he took the pay of a common soldier; and nobles, statesmen,\nand divines, the most distinguished of their time, have not scorned to\nsquare accounts with their bookseller.\n\n_Captain. (Sings._)\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cO if it were a mean thing,\n       The gentles would not use it;\n     And if it were ungodly,\n       The clergy would refuse it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n_Author._ You say well. But no man of honour, genius, or spirit, would\nmake the mere love of gain, the chief, far less the only, purpose of his\nlabours. For myself, I am not displeased to find the game a winning one;\nyet while I pleased the public, I should probably continue it merely for\nthe pleasure of playing; for I have felt as strongly as most folks that\nlove of composition, which is perhaps the strongest of all instincts,\ndriving the author to the pen, the painter to the pallet, often without\neither the chance of fame or the prospect of reward. Perhaps I have said\ntoo much of this. I might, perhaps, with as much truth as most people,\nexculpate myself from the charge of being either of a greedy or\nmercenary disposition; but I am not, therefore, hypocrite enough to\ndisclaim the ordinary motives, on account of which the whole world\naround me is toiling unremittingly, to the sacrifice of ease, comfort,\nhealth, and life. I do not affect the disinterestedness of that\ningenious association of gentlemen mentioned by Goldsmith, who sold\ntheir magazine for sixpence a-piece, merely for their own amusement.\n\n_Captain._ I have but one thing more to hint.--The world say you will\nrun yourself out.\n\n_Author._ The world say true: and what then?

We shall\nfall into contempt and oblivion.\n\n_Author._ Like many a poor fellow, already overwhelmed with the number\nof his family, I cannot help going on to increase it--\u00e2\u0080\u009c'Tis my vocation,\nHal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--Such of you as deserve oblivion--perhaps the whole of you--may be\nconsigned to it. At any rate, you have been read in your day, which is\nmore than can be said of some of your contemporaries, of less fortune\nand more merit. They cannot say but that you _had_ the crown. It is\nalways something to have engaged the public attention for seven years.\nHad I only written Waverley, I should have long since been, according to\nthe established phrase, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe ingenious author of a novel much admired\nat the time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I believe, on my soul, that the reputation of Waverley\nis sustained very much by the praises of those, who may be inclined to\nprefer that tale to its successors.\n\n_Captain._ You are willing, then, to barter future reputation for\npresent popularity?\n\n_Author. Meliora spero._ Horace himself expected not to survive in all\nhis works--I may hope to live in some of mine;--_non omnis moriar._ It\nis some consolation to reflect, that the best authors in all countries\nhave been the most voluminous; and it has often happened, that those\nwho have been best received in their own time, have also continued to\nbe acceptable to posterity. I do not think so ill of the present\ngeneration, as to suppose that its present favour necessarily infers\nfuture condemnation.\n\n_Captain._ Were all to act on such principles, the public would be\ninundated.\n\n_Author_ Once more, my dear son, beware of cant. You speak as if the\npublic were obliged to read books merely because they are printed--your\nfriends the booksellers would thank you to make the proposition good.\nThe most serious grievance attending such inundations as you talk of,\nis, that they make rags dear. The multiplicity of publications does the\npresent age no harm, and may greatly advantage that which is to succeed\nus.\n\n_Captain._ I do not see how that is to happen.\n\n_Author._ The complaints in the time of Elizabeth and James, of\nthe alarming fertility of the press, were as loud as they are at\npresent--yet look at the shore over which the inundation of that age\nflowed, and it resembles now the Rich Strand of the Faery Queen--\n\n     ----\u00e2\u0080\u009cBesrrew'd all with rich array,\n     Of pearl and precious stones of great assay;\n     And all the gravel mix'd with golden ore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBelieve me, that even in the most neglected works of the present age,\nthe next may discover treasures.\n\n_Captain._ Some books will defy all alchemy.\n\n_Author._ They will be but few in number; since, as for the writers, who\nare possessed of no merit at all, unless indeed they publish their\nworks at their own expense, like Sir Richard Blackmore, their power of\nannoying the public will be soon limited by the difficulty of finding\nundertaking booksellers.\n\n_Captain._ You are incorrigible.

But although the united crown of England and Scotland was worn\nby the same individual, it required a long lapse of time, and the\nsuccession of more than one generation, ere the inveterate national\nprejudices which had so long existed betwixt the sister kingdoms were\nremoved, and the subjects of either side of the Tweed brought to regard\nthose upon the opposite bank as friends and as brethren.\n\nThese prejudices were, of course, most inveterate during the reign of\nKing James. The English subjects accused him of partiality to those of\nhis ancient kingdom; while the Scots, with equal injustice, charged\nhim with having forgotten the land of his nativity, and with neglecting\nthose early friends to whose allegiance he had been so much indebted.\n\nThe temper of the king, peaceable even to timidity, inclined him\nperpetually to interfere as mediator between the contending factions,\nwhose brawls disturbed the Court. But, notwithstanding all his\nprecautions, historians have recorded many instances, where the mutual\nhatred of two nations, who, after being enemies for a thousand years,\nhad been so very recently united, broke forth with a fury which menaced\na general convulsion; and, spreading from the highest to the lowest\nclasses, as it occasioned debates in council and parliament, factions in\nthe court, and duels among the gentry, was no less productive of riots\nand brawls amongst the lower orders.\n\nWhile these heart-burnings were at the highest, there flourished in the\ncity of London an ingenious but whimsical and self opinioned mechanic,\nmuch devoted to abstract studies, David Ramsay by name, who, whether\nrecommended by his great skill in his profession, as the courtiers\nalleged, or, as was murmured among the neighbours, by his birthplace, in\nthe good town of Dalkeith, near Edinburgh, held in James's household the\npost of maker of watches and horologes to his Majesty. He scorned\nnot, however, to keep open shop within Temple Bar, a few yards to the\neastward of Saint Dunstan's Church.\n\nThe shop of a London tradesman at that time, as it may be supposed, was\nsomething very different from those we now see in the same locality. The\ngoods were exposed to sale in cases, only defended from the weather by\na covering of canvass, and the whole resembled the stalls and booths now\nerected for the temporary accommodation of dealers at a country fair,\nrather than the established emporium of a respectable citizen. But most\nof the shopkeepers of note, and David Ramsay amongst others, had their\nbooth connected with a small apartment which opened backward from it,\nand bore the same resemblance to the front shop that Robinson Crusoe's\ncavern did to the tent which he erected before it.\n\nTo this Master Ramsay was often accustomed to retreat to the labour of\nhis abstruse calculations; for he aimed at improvements and discoveries\nin his own art, and sometimes pushed his researches, like Napier, and\nother mathematicians of the period, into abstract science. When thus\nengaged, he left the outer posts of his commercial establishment to be\nmaintained by two stout-bodied and strong-voiced apprentices, who kept\nup the cry of, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat d'ye lack? what d'ye lack?\u00e2\u0080\u009d accompanied with the\nappropriate recommendations of the articles in which they dealt.\n\nThis direct and personal application for custom to those who chanced to\npass by, is now, we believe, limited to Monmouth Street, (if it\nstill exists even in that repository of ancient garments,) under the\nguardianship of the scattered remnant of Israel. But at the time we\nare speaking of, it was practised alike by Jew and Gentile, and served,\ninstead of all our present newspaper puffs and advertisements, to\nsolicit the attention of the public in general, and of friends in\nparticular, to the unrivalled excellence of the goods, which they\noffered to sale upon such easy terms, that it might fairly appear that\nthe venders had rather a view to the general service of the public, than\nto their own particular advantage.\n\nThe verbal proclaimers of the excellence of their commodities, had this\nadvantage over those who, in the present day, use the public papers for\nthe same purpose, that they could in many cases adapt their address to\nthe peculiar appearance and apparent taste of the passengers. [This, as\nwe have said, was also the case in Monmouth Street in our remembrance.\nWe have ourselves been reminded of the deficiencies of our femoral\nhabiliments, and exhorted upon that score to fit ourselves more\nbeseemingly; but this is a digression.] This direct and personal mode of\ninvitation to customers became, however, a dangerous temptation to the\nyoung wags who were employed in the task of solicitation during\nthe absence of the principal person interested in the traffic; and,\nconfiding in their numbers and civic union, the 'prentices of London\nwere often seduced into taking liberties with the passengers, and\nexercising their wit at the expense of those whom they had no hopes of\nconverting into customers by their eloquence. If this were resented by\nany act of violence, the inmates of each shop were ready to pour forth\nin succour; and in the words of an old song which Dr. Johnson was used\nto hum,--\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cUp then rose the 'prentices all,\n     Living in London, both proper and tall.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDesperate riots often arose on such occasions, especially when the\nTemplars, or other youths connected with the aristocracy, were insulted,\nor conceived themselves to be so. Upon such occasions, bare steel was\nfrequently opposed to the clubs of the citizens, and death sometimes\nensued on both sides. The tardy and inefficient police of the time\nhad no other resource than by the Alderman of the ward calling out the\nhouseholders, and putting a stop to the strife by overpowering numbers,\nas the Capulets and Montagues are separated upon the stage.\n\nAt the period when such was the universal custom of the most\nrespectable, as well as the most inconsiderable, shopkeepers in London,\nDavid Ramsay, on the evening to which we solicit the attention of\nthe reader, retiring to more abstruse and private labours, left\nthe administration of his outer shop, or booth, to the aforesaid\nsharp-witted, active, able-bodied, and well-voiced apprentices, namely,\nJenkin Vincent and Frank Tunstall.\n\nVincent had been educated at the excellent foundation of Christ's Church\nHospital, and was bred, therefore, as well as born, a Londoner, with\nall the acuteness, address, and audacity which belong peculiarly to\nthe youth of a metropolis. He was now about twenty years old, short in\nstature, but remarkably strong made, eminent for his feats upon holidays\nat foot-ball, and other gymnastic exercises; scarce rivalled in\nthe broad-sword play, though hitherto only exercised in the form of\nsingle-stick. He knew every lane, blind alley, and sequestered court of\nthe ward, better than his catechism; was alike active in his master's\naffairs, and in his own adventures of fun and mischief; and so managed\nmatters, that the credit he acquired by the former bore him out, or at\nleast served for his apology, when the latter propensity led him into\nscrapes, of which, however, it is but fair to state, that they had\nhitherto inferred nothing mean or discreditable. Some aberrations there\nwere, which David Ramsay, his master, endeavoured to reduce to regular\norder when he discovered them, and others which he winked at--supposing\nthem to answer the purpose of the escapement of a watch, which disposes\nof a certain quantity of the extra power of that mechanical impulse\nwhich puts the whole in motion.\n\nThe physiognomy of Jin Vin--by which abbreviation he was familiarly\nknown through the ward--corresponded with the sketch we have given\nof his character. His head, upon which his 'prentice's flat cap was\ngenerally flung in a careless and oblique fashion, was closely covered\nwith thick hair of raven black, which curled naturally and closely, and\nwould have grown to great length, but for the modest custom enjoined by\nhis state in life and strictly enforced by his master, which compelled\nhim to keep it short-cropped,--not unreluctantly, as he looked with\nenvy on the flowing ringlets, in which the courtiers, and aristocratic\nstudents of the neighbouring Temple, began to indulge themselves, as\nmarks of superiority and of gentility.\n\nVincent's eyes were deep set in his head, of a strong vivid black, full\nof fire, roguery, and intelligence, and conveying a humorous expression,\neven while he was uttering the usual small-talk of his trade, as if\nhe ridiculed those who were disposed to give any weight to his\ncommonplaces. He had address enough, however, to add little touches of\nhis own, which gave a turn of drollery even to this ordinary routine of\nthe booth; and the alacrity of his manner--his ready and obvious wish\nto oblige--his intelligence and civility, when he thought civility\nnecessary, made him a universal favourite with his master's customers.\n\nHis features were far from regular, for his nose was flattish, his mouth\ntending to the larger size, and his complexion inclining to be more dark\nthan was then thought consistent with masculine beauty. But, in despite\nof his having always breathed the air of a crowded city, his complexion\nhad the ruddy and manly expression of redundant health; his turned-up\nnose gave an air of spirit and raillery to what he said, and seconded\nthe laugh of his eyes; and his wide mouth was garnished with a pair of\nwell-formed and well-coloured lips, which, when he laughed, disclosed a\nrange of teeth strong and well set, and as white as the very pearl. Such\nwas the elder apprentice of David Ramsay, Memory's Monitor, watchmaker,\nand constructor of horologes, to his Most Sacred Majesty James I.\n\nJenkin's companion was the younger apprentice, though, perhaps, he might\nbe the elder of the two in years. At any rate, he was of a much more\nstaid and composed temper. Francis Tunstall was of that ancient and\nproud descent who claimed the style of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cunstained;\u00e2\u0080\u009d because, amid\nthe various chances of the long and bloody wars of the Roses, they had,\nwith undeviating faith, followed the House of Lancaster, to which they\nhad originally attached themselves. The meanest sprig of such a tree\nattached importance to the root from which it derived itself; and\nTunstall was supposed to nourish in secret a proportion of that family\npride, which had exhorted tears from his widowed and almost indigent\nmother, when she saw herself obliged to consign him to a line of\nlife inferior, as her prejudices suggested, to the course held by his\nprogenitors. Yet, with all this aristocratic prejudice, his master found\nthe well-born youth more docile, regular, and strictly attentive to\nhis duty, than his far more active and alert comrade. Tunstall also\ngratified his master by the particular attention which he seemed\ndisposed to bestow on the abstract principles of science connected with\nthe trade which he was bound to study, the limits of which were daily\nenlarged with the increase of mathematical science.\n\nVincent beat his companion beyond the distance-post, in every thing like\nthe practical adaptation of thorough practice, in the dexterity of\nhand necessary to execute the mechanical branches of the art, and\ndoubled-distanced him in all respecting the commercial affairs of the\nshop. Still David Ramsay was wont to say, that if Vincent knew how to do\na thing the better of the two, Tunstall was much better acquainted with\nthe principles on which it ought to be done; and he sometimes objected\nto the latter, that he knew critical excellence too well ever to be\nsatisfied with practical mediocrity.\n\nThe disposition of Tunstall was shy, as well as studious; and, though\nperfectly civil and obliging, he never seemed to feel himself in his\nplace while he went through the duties of the shop. He was tall\nand handsome, with fair hair, and well-formed limbs, good features,\nwell-opened light-blue eyes, a straight Grecian nose, and a countenance\nwhich expressed both good-humour and intelligence, but qualified by a\ngravity unsuitable to his years, and which almost amounted to dejection.\nHe lived on the best of terms with his companion, and readily stood by\nhim whenever he was engaged in any of the frequent skirmishes, which, as\nwe have already observed, often disturbed the city of London about this\nperiod. But though Tunstall was allowed to understand quarter-staff (the\nweapon of the North country) in a superior degree, and though he was\nnaturally both strong and active, his interference in such affrays\nseemed always matter of necessity; and, as he never voluntarily joined\neither their brawls or their sports, he held a far lower place in the\nopinion of the youth of the ward than his hearty and active friend Jin\nVin. Nay, had it not been for the interest made for his comrade, by the\nintercession of Vincent, Tunstall would have stood some chance of being\naltogether excluded from the society of his contemporaries of the same\ncondition, who called him, in scorn, the Cavaliero Cuddy, and the Gentle\nTunstall.\n\nOn the other hand, the lad himself, deprived of the fresh air in which\nhe had been brought up, and foregoing the exercise to which he had\nformerly been accustomed, while the inhabitant of his native mansion,\nlost gradually the freshness of his complexion, and, without showing any\nformal symptoms of disease, grew more thin and pale as he grew older,\nand at length exhibited the appearance of indifferent health, without\nany thing of the habits and complaints of an invalid, excepting a\ndisposition to avoid society, and to spend his leisure time in private\nstudy, rather than mingle in the sports of his companions, or even\nresort to the theatres, then the general rendezvous of his class; where,\naccording to high authority, they fought for half-bitten apples, cracked\nnuts, and filled the upper gallery with their clamours.\n\nSuch were the two youths who called David Ramsay master; and with both\nof whom he used to fret from morning till night, as their peculiarities\ninterfered with his own, or with the quiet and beneficial course of his\ntraffic.\n\nUpon the whole, however, the youths were attached to their master, and\nhe, a good-natured, though an absent and whimsical man, was scarce\nless so to them; and when a little warmed with wine at an occasional\njunketing, he used to boast, in his northern dialect, of his \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwa bonnie\nlads, and the looks that the court ladies threw at them, when visiting\nhis shop in their caroches, when on a frolic into the city.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But David\nRamsay never failed, at the same time, to draw up his own tall,\nthin, lathy skeleton, extend his lean jaws into an alarming grin, and\nindicate, by a nod of his yard-long visage, and a twinkle of his little\ngrey eye, that there might be more faces in Fleet Street worth looking\nat than those of Frank and Jenkin. His old neighbour, Widow Simmons, the\nsempstress, who had served, in her day, the very tip-top revellers of\nthe Temple, with ruffs, cuffs, and bands, distinguished more deeply\nthe sort of attention paid by the females of quality, who so regularly\nvisited David Ramsay's shop, to its inmates. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe boy Frank,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nadmitted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cused to attract the attention of the young ladies, as having\nsomething gentle and downcast in his looks; but then he could not better\nhimself, for the poor youth had not a word to throw at a dog. Now Jin\nVin was so full of his jibes and jeers, and so willing, and so ready,\nand so serviceable, and so mannerly all the while, with a step that\nsprung like a buck's in Epping Forest, and his eye that twinkled as\nblack as a gipsy's, that no woman who knew the world would make a\ncomparison betwixt the lads. As for poor neighbour Ramsay himself, the\nman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas a civil neighbour, and a learned man, doubtless,\nand might be a rich man if he had common sense to back his learning; and\ndoubtless, for a Scot, neighbour Ramsay was nothing of a bad man, but\nhe was so constantly grimed with smoke, gilded with brass filings,\nand smeared with lamp-black and oil, that Dame Simmons judged it would\nrequire his whole shopful of watches to induce any feasible woman to\ntouch the said neighbour Ramsay with any thing save a pair of tongs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA still higher authority, Dame Ursula, wife to Benjamin Suddlechop, the\nbarber, was of exactly the same opinion.\n\nSuch were, in natural qualities and public estimation, the two youths,\nwho, in a fine April day, having first rendered their dutiful service\nand attendance on the table of their master and his daughter, at their\ndinner at one o'clock,--Such, O ye lads of London, was the severe\ndiscipline undergone by your predecessors!--and having regaled\nthemselves upon the fragments, in company with two female domestics, one\na cook, and maid of all work, the other called Mistress Margaret's maid,\nnow relieved their master in the duty of the outward shop; and agreeably\nto the established custom, were soliciting, by their entreaties and\nrecommendations of their master's manufacture, the attention and\nencouragement of the passengers.\n\nIn this species of service it may be easily supposed that Jenkin Vincent\nleft his more reserved and bashful comrade far in the background. The\nlatter could only articulate with difficulty, and as an act of duty\nwhich he was rather ashamed of discharging, the established words\nof form--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat d'ye lack?--What d'ye lack?--Clocks--watches--barnacles?\n--What d'ye lack?--Watches--clocks--barnacles?--What d'ye lack, sir? What\nd'ye lack, madam?--Barnacles--watches--clocks?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut this dull and dry iteration, however varied by diversity of verbal\narrangement, sounded flat when mingled with the rich and recommendatory\noratory of the bold-faced, deep-mouthed, and ready-witted Jenkin\nVincent.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat d'ye lack, noble sir?--What d'ye lack, beauteous madam?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n he said, in a tone at once bold and soothing, which often was so applied\nas both to gratify the persons addressed, and to excite a smile from\nother hearers.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod bless your reverence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to a beneficed clergyman;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Greek and Hebrew have harmed your reverence's eyes--Buy a pair of\nDavid Ramsay's barnacles. The King--God bless his Sacred Majesty!--never\nreads Hebrew or Greek without them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you well avised of that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a fat parson from the Vale of\nEvesham. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, if the Head of the Church wears them,--God bless his\nSacred Majesty!--I will try what they can do for me; for I have not\nbeen able to distinguish one Hebrew letter from another, since--I cannot\nremember the time--when I had a bad fever. Choose me a pair of his\nmost Sacred Majesty's own wearing, my good youth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a pair, and please your reverence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin, producing a\npair of spectacles which he touched with an air of great deference and\nrespect, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich his most blessed Majesty placed this day three weeks on\nhis own blessed nose; and would have kept them for his own sacred use,\nbut that the setting being, as your reverence sees, of the purest jet,\nwas, as his Sacred Majesty was pleased to say, fitter for a bishop than\nfor a secular prince.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis Sacred Majesty the King,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the worthy divine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas ever a very\nDaniel in his judgment. Give me the barnacles, my good youth, and who\ncan say what nose they may bestride in two years hence?--our reverend\nbrother of Gloucester waxes in years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He then pulled out his purse,\npaid for the spectacles, and left the shop with even a more important\nstep than that which had paused to enter it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor shame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tunstall to his companion; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthese glasses will never\nsuit one of his years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a fool, Frank,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Vincent, in reply; \u00e2\u0080\u009chad the good doctor\nwished glasses to read with, he would have tried them before buying.\nHe does not want to look through them himself, and these will serve\nthe purpose of being looked at by other folks, as well as the best\nmagnifiers in the shop.--What d'ye lack?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, resuming his\nsolicitations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMirrors for your toilette, my pretty madam; your\nhead-gear is something awry--pity, since it is so well fancied.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The\nwoman stopped and bought a mirror.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat d'ye lack?--a watch, Master\nSergeant--a watch that will go as long as a lawsuit, as steady and true\nas your own eloquence?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHold your peace, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Knight of the Coif, who was\ndisturbed by Vin's address whilst in deep consultation with an eminent\nattorney; \u00e2\u0080\u009chold your peace! You are the loudest-tongued varlet betwixt\nthe Devil's Tavern and Guildhall.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA watch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d reiterated the undaunted Jenkin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat shall not lose\nthirteen minutes in a thirteen years' lawsuit.--He's out of hearing--A\nwatch with four wheels and a bar-movement--a watch that shall tell you,\nMaster Poet, how long the patience of the audience will endure your next\npiece at the Black Bull.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The bard laughed, and fumbled in the pocket of\nhis slops till he chased into a corner, and fairly caught, a small piece\nof coin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere is a tester to cherish thy wit, good boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGramercy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Vin; \u00e2\u0080\u009cat the next play of yours I will bring down a\nset of roaring boys, that shall make all the critics in the pit, and the\ngallants on the stage, civil, or else the curtain shall smoke for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, that I call mean,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tunstall, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto take the poor rhymer's\nmoney, who has so little left behind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are an owl, once again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Vincent; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif he has nothing left to\nbuy cheese and radishes, he will only dine a day the sooner with some\npatron or some player, for that is his fate five days out of the seven.\nIt is unnatural that a poet should pay for his own pot of beer; I will\ndrink his tester for him, to save him from such shame; and when his\nthird night comes round, he shall have penniworths for his coin, I\npromise you.--But here comes another-guess customer. Look at that\nstrange fellow--see how he gapes at every shop, as if he would swallow\nthe wares.--O! Saint Dunstan has caught his eye; pray God he swallow not\nthe images. See how he stands astonished, as old Adam and Eve ply\ntheir ding-dong! Come, Frank, thou art a scholar; construe me that same\nfellow, with his blue cap with a cock's feather in it, to show he's of\ngentle blood, God wot--his grey eyes, his yellow hair, his sword with a\nton of iron in the handle--his grey thread-bare cloak--his step like a\nFrenchman--his look like a Spaniard--a book at his girdle, and a broad\ndudgeon-dagger on the other side, to show him half-pedant, half-bully.\nHow call you that pageant, Frank?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA raw Scotsman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tunstall; \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust come up, I suppose, to help the\nrest of his countrymen to gnaw old England's bones; a palmerworm, I\nreckon, to devour what the locust has spared.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven so, Frank,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Vincent; \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust as the poet sings sweetly,--\n\n    'In Scotland he was born and bred,\n     And, though a beggar, must be fed.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHush!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tunstall, \u00e2\u0080\u009cremember our master.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPshaw!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered his mercurial companion; \u00e2\u0080\u009che knows on which side\nhis bread is buttered, and I warrant you has not lived so long among\nEnglishmen, and by Englishmen, to quarrel with us for bearing an English\nmind. But see, our Scot has done gazing at St. Dunstan's, and comes our\nway. By this light, a proper lad and a sturdy, in spite of freckles and\nsun-burning.--He comes nearer still, I will have at him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd, if you do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his comrade, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou may get a broken head--he looks\nnot as if he would carry coals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA fig for your threat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Vincent, and instantly addressed the\nstranger. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuy a watch, most noble northern Thane--buy a watch, to count\nthe hours of plenty since the blessed moment you left Berwick behind\nyou.--Buy barnacles, to see the English gold lies ready for your\ngripe.--Buy what you will, you shall have credit for three days; for,\nwere your pockets as bare as Father Fergus's, you are a Scot in London,\nand you will be stocked in that time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The stranger looked sternly\nat the waggish apprentice, and seemed to grasp his cudgel in rather a\nmenacing fashion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuy physic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the undaunted Vincent, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you will\nbuy neither time nor light--physic for a proud stomach, sir;--there is a\n'pothecary's shop on the other side of the way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere the probationary disciple of Galen, who stood at his master's door\nin his flat cap and canvass sleeves, with a large wooden pestle in his\nhand, took up the ball which was flung to him by Jenkin, with, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\nd'ye lack, sir?--Buy a choice Caledonian salve, _Flos sulphvr. cum\nbutyro quant. suff._\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be taken after a gentle rubbing-down with an English oaken towel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said Vincent.\n\nThe bonny Scot had given full scope to the play of this small artillery\nof city wit, by halting his stately pace, and viewing grimly, first the\none assailant, and then the other, as if menacing either repartee or\nmore violent revenge. But phlegm or prudence got the better of his\nindignation, and tossing his head as one who valued not the raillery to\nwhich he had been exposed, he walked down Fleet Street, pursued by the\nhorse-laugh of his tormentors.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Scot will not fight till he see his own blood,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tunstall, whom\nhis north of England extraction had made familiar with all manner of\nproverbs against those who lay yet farther north than himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFaith, I know not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin; \u00e2\u0080\u009che looks dangerous, that\nfellow--he will hit some one over the noddle before he goes\nfar.--Hark!--hark!--they are rising.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAccordingly, the well-known cry of,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c'Prentices--'prentices--Clubs--clubs!\u00e2\u0080\u009d now rang along Fleet Street; and\nJenkin, snatching up his weapon, which lay beneath the counter ready\nat the slightest notice, and calling to Tunstall to take his bat and\nfollow, leaped over the hatch-door which protected the outer-shop, and\nran as fast as he could towards the affray, echoing the cry as he ran,\nand elbowing, or shoving aside, whoever stood in his way. His comrade,\nfirst calling to his master to give an eye to the shop, followed\nJenkin's example, and ran after him as fast as he could, but with more\nattention to the safety and convenience of others; while old David\nRamsay, with hands and eyes uplifted, a green apron before him, and a\nglass which he had been polishing thrust into his bosom, came forth\nto look after the safety of his goods and chattels, knowing, by old\nexperience, that, when the cry of \u00e2\u0080\u009cClubs\u00e2\u0080\u009d once arose, he would have\nlittle aid on the part of his apprentices.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\n  This, sir, is one among the Seignory,\n  Has wealth at will, and will to use his wealth,\n  And wit to increase it. Marry, his worst folly\n  Lies in a thriftless sort of charity,\n  That goes a-gadding sometimes after objects,\n  Which wise men will not see when thrust upon them.\n                             _The Old Couple._\n\nThe ancient gentleman bustled about his shop, in pettish displeasure\nat being summoned hither so hastily, to the interruption of his more\nabstract studies; and, unwilling to renounce the train of calculation\nwhich he had put in progress, he mingled whimsically with the fragments\nof the arithmetical operation, his oratory to the passengers, and angry\nreflections on his idle apprentices. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat d'ye lack, sir? Madam,\nwhat d'ye lack--clocks for hall or table--night-watches--day\nwatches?--_Locking wheel being 48--the power of retort 8--the striking\npins are 48_--What d'ye lack, honoured sir?--_The quotient--the\nmultiplicand_--That the knaves should have gone out this blessed\nminute!--_the acceleration being at the rate of 5 minutes, 55 seconds,\n53 thirds, 59 fourths_--I will switch them both when they come back--I\nwill, by the bones of the immortal Napier!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere the vexed philosopher was interrupted by the entrance of a grave\ncitizen of a most respectable appearance, who, saluting him familiarly\nby the name of \u00e2\u0080\u009cDavie, my old acquaintance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d demanded what had put him\nso much out of sorts, and gave him at the same time a cordial grasp of\nhis hand.\n\nThe stranger's dress was, though grave, rather richer than usual. His\npaned hose were of black velvet, lined with purple silk, which garniture\nappeared at the slashes. His doublet was of purple cloth, and his\nshort cloak of black velvet, to correspond with his hose; and both were\nadorned with a great number of small silver buttons richly wrought in\nfiligree. A triple chain of gold hung round his neck; and, in place of\na sword or dagger, he wore at his belt an ordinary knife for the purpose\nof the table, with a small silver case, which appeared to contain\nwriting materials. He might have seemed some secretary or clerk engaged\nin the service of the public, only that his low, flat, and unadorned\ncap, and his well-blacked, shining shoes, indicated that he belonged to\nthe city. He was a well-made man, about the middle size, and seemed in\nfirm health, though advanced in years. His looks expressed sagacity and\ngood-humour: and the air of respectability which his dress announced,\nwas well supported by his clear eye, ruddy cheek, and grey hair. He used\nthe Scottish idiom in his first address, but in such a manner that it\ncould hardly be distinguished whether he was passing upon his friend a\nsort of jocose mockery, or whether it was his own native dialect, for\nhis ordinary discourse had little provincialism.\n\nIn answer to the queries of his respectable friend, Ramsay groaned\nheavily, answering by echoing back the question, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat ails me, Master\nGeorge? Why, every thing ails me! I profess to you that a man may\nas well live in Fairyland as in the Ward of Farringdon-Without. My\napprentices are turned into mere goblins--they appear and disappear like\nspunkies, and have no more regularity in them than a watch without a\nscapement. If there is a ball to be tossed up, or a bullock to be driven\nmad, or a quean to be ducked for scolding, or a head to be broken,\nJenkin is sure to be at the one end or the other of it, and then\naway skips Francis Tunstall for company. I think the prize-fighters,\nbear-leaders, and mountebanks, are in a league against me, my dear\nfriend, and that they pass my house ten times for any other in the city.\nHere's an Italian fellow come over, too, that they call Punchinello;\nand, altogether----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d interrupted Master George, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut what is all this to the present\ncase?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Ramsay, \u00e2\u0080\u009chere has been a cry of thieves or murder, (I\nhope that will prove the least of it amongst these English pock-pudding\nswine!) and I have been interrupted in the deepest calculation ever\nmortal man plunged into, Master George.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat, man!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Master George, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou must take patience--You are a\nman that deals in time, and can make it go fast and slow at pleasure;\nyou, of all the world, have least reason to complain, if a little of it\nbe lost now and then.--But here come your boys, and bringing in a slain\nman betwixt them, I think--here has been serious mischief, I am afraid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe more mischief the better sport,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the crabbed old\nwatchmaker. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am blithe, though, that it's neither of the twa loons\nthemselves.--What are ye bringing a corpse here for, ye fause villains?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n he added, addressing the two apprentices, who, at the head of a\nconsiderable mob of their own class, some of whom bore evident marks of\na recent fray, were carrying the body betwixt them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is not dead yet, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Tunstall.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCarry him into the apothecary's, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied his master. \u00e2\u0080\u009cD'ye\nthink I can set a man's life in motion again, as if he were a clock or a\ntimepiece?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor godsake, old friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his acquaintance, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet us have him here\nat the nearest--he seems only in a swoon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA swoon?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ramsay, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand what business had he to swoon in the\nstreets? Only, if it will oblige my friend Master George, I would take\nin all the dead men in St. Dunstan's parish. Call Sam Porter to look\nafter the shop.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, the stunned man, being the identical\nScotsman who had passed a short time before amidst the jeers of the\napprentices, was carried into the back shop of the artist, and there\nplaced in an armed chair till the apothecary from over the way came to\nhis assistance. This gentleman, as sometimes happens to those of the\nlearned professions, had rather more lore than knowledge, and began to\ntalk of the sinciput and occiput, and cerebrum and cerebellum, until he\nexhausted David Ramsay's brief stock of patience.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBell-um! bell-ell-um!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he repeated, with great indignation; \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\nsignify all the bells in London, if you do not put a plaster on the\nchild's crown?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMaster George, with better-directed zeal, asked the apothecary whether\nbleeding might not be useful; when, after humming and hawing for a\nmoment, and being unable, upon the spur of the occasion, to suggest any\nthing else, the man of pharmacy observed, that it would, at all events,\nrelieve the brain or cerebrum, in case there was a tendency to the\ndepositation of any extravasated blood, to operate as a pressure upon\nthat delicate organ.\n\nFortunately he was adequate to performing this operation; and, being\npowerfully aided by Jenkin Vincent (who was learned in all cases of\nbroken heads) with plenty of cold water, and a little vinegar, applied\naccording to the scientific method practised by the bottle-holders in a\nmodern ring, the man began to raise himself on his chair, draw his cloak\ntightly around him, and look about like one who struggles to recover\nsense and recollection.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe had better lie down on the bed in the little back closet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr.\nRamsay's visitor, who seemed perfectly familiar with the accommodations\nwhich the house afforded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is welcome to my share of the truckle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin,--for in\nthe said back closet were the two apprentices accommodated in one\ntruckle-bed,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can sleep under the counter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo can I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tunstall, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand the poor fellow can have the bed all\nnight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSleep,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the apothecary, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis, in the opinion of Galen,\na restorative and febrifuge, and is most naturally taken in a\ntruckle-bed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere a better cannot be come by,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--said Master George; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut these are\ntwo honest lads, to give up their beds so willingly. Come, off with his\ncloak, and let us bear him to his couch--I will send for Dr. Irving, the\nking's chirurgeon--he does not live far off, and that shall be my share\nof the Samaritan's duty, neighbour Ramsay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the apothecary, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is at your pleasure to send for\nother advice, and I shall not object to consult with Dr. Irving or any\nother medical person of skill, neither to continue to furnish such drugs\nas may be needful from my pharmacopeia. However, whatever Dr. Irving,\nwho, I think, hath had his degrees in Edinburgh, or Dr. Any-one-beside,\nbe he Scottish or English, may say to the contrary, sleep, taken\ntimeously, is a febrifuge, or sedative, and also a restorative.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe muttered a few more learned words, and concluded by informing\nRamsay's friend in English far more intelligible than his Latin, that he\nwould look to him as his paymaster, for medicines, care, and attendance,\nfurnished, or to be furnished, to this party unknown.\n\nMaster George only replied by desiring him to send his bill for what he\nhad already to charge, and to give himself no farther trouble unless he\nheard from him. The pharmacopolist, who, from discoveries made by the\ncloak falling a little aside, had no great opinion of the faculty of\nthis chance patient to make reimbursement, had no sooner seen his case\nespoused by a substantial citizen, than he showed some reluctance to\nquit possession of it, and it needed a short and stern hint from Master\nGeorge, which, with all his good-humour, he was capable of expressing\nwhen occasion required, to send to his own dwelling this Esculapius of\nTemple Bar.\n\nWhen they were rid of Mr. Raredrench, the charitable efforts of Jenkin\nand Francis, to divest the patient of his long grey cloak, were firmly\nresisted on his own part.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy life suner--my life suner,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he muttered\nin indistinct murmurs. In these efforts to retain his upper garment,\nwhich was too tender to resist much handling, it gave way at length with\na loud rent, which almost threw the patient into a second syncope,\nand he sat before them in his under garments, the looped and repaired\nwretchedness of which moved at once pity and laughter, and had certainly\nbeen the cause of his unwillingness to resign the mantle, which, like\nthe virtue of charity, served to cover so many imperfections.\n\nThe man himself cast his eyes on his poverty-struck garb, and seemed so\nmuch ashamed of the disclosure, that, muttering between his teeth, that\nhe would be too late for his appointment, he made an effort to rise and\nleave the shop, which was easily prevented by Jenkin Vincent and his\ncomrade, who, at the nod of Master George, laid hold of and detained him\nin his chair.\n\nThe patient next looked round him for a moment, and then said faintly,\nin his broad northern language--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat sort of usage ca' ye this,\ngentlemen, to a stranger a sojourner in your town? Ye hae broken my\nhead--ye hae riven my cloak, and now ye are for restraining my personal\nliberty! They were wiser than me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, after a moment's pause,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat counselled me to wear my warst claithing in the streets of\nLondon; and, if I could have got ony things warse than these mean\ngarments,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--(\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich would have been very difficult,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jin Vin, in a\nwhisper to his companion,)--\u00e2\u0080\u009cthey would have been e'en ower gude for the\ngrips o' men sae little acquented with the laws of honest civility.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo say the truth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin, unable to forbear any longer, although\nthe discipline of the times prescribed to those in his situation a\ndegree of respectful distance and humility in the presence of parents,\nmasters, or seniors, of which the present age has no idea--\u00e2\u0080\u009cto say the\ntruth, the good gentleman's clothes look as if they would not brook much\nhandling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHold your peace, young man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Master George, with a tone of\nauthority; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnever mock the stranger or the poor--the black ox has not\ntrod on your foot yet--you know not what lands you may travel in, or\nwhat clothes you may wear, before you die.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nVincent held down his head and stood rebuked, but the stranger did not\naccept the apology which was made for him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI _am_ a stranger, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is certain; though methinks,\nthat, being such, I have been somewhat familiarly treated in this town\nof yours; but, as for my being poor, I think I need not be charged with\npoverty, till I seek siller of somebody.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe dear country all over,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Master George, in a whisper, to David\nRamsay, \u00e2\u0080\u009cpride and poverty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut David had taken out his tablets and silver pen, and, deeply immersed\nin calculations, in which he rambled over all the terms of arithmetic,\nfrom the simple unit to millions, billions, and trillions, neither heard\nnor answered the observation of his friend, who, seeing his abstraction,\nturned again to the Scot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI fancy now, Jockey, if a stranger were to offer you a noble, you would\nchuck it back at his head?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot if I could do him honest service for it, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Scot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nam willing to do what I may to be useful, though I come of an honourable\nhouse, and may be said to be in a sort indifferently weel provided for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the interrogator, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand what house may claim the honour of\nyour descent?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAn ancient coat belongs to it, as the play says,\u00e2\u0080\u009d whispered Vincent to\nhis companion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, Jockey, out with it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Master George, observing that the\nScot, as usual with his countrymen, when asked a blunt, straightforward\nquestion, took a little time before answering it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am no more Jockey, sir, than you are John,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the stranger, as if\noffended at being addressed by a name, which at that time was used, as\nSawney now is, for a general appellative of the Scottish nation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy\nname, if you must know it, is Richie Moniplies; and I come of the old\nand honourable house of Castle Collop, weel kend at the West-Port of\nEdinburgh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is that you call the West-Port?\u00e2\u0080\u009d proceeded the interrogator.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, an it like your honour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, who now, having recovered\nhis senses sufficiently to observe the respectable exterior of Master\nGeorge, threw more civility into his manner than at first, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe\nWest-Port is a gate of our city, as yonder brick arches at Whitehall\nform the entrance of the king's palace here, only that the West-Port is\nof stonern work, and mair decorated with architecture and the policy of\nbigging.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNouns, man, the Whitehall gateways were planned by the great Holbein,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered Master George; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suspect your accident has jumbled your\nbrains, my good friend. I suppose you will tell me next, you have\nat Edinburgh as fine a navigable river as the Thames, with all its\nshipping?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Thames!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Richie, in a tone of ineffable contempt--\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod\nbless your honour's judgment, we have at Edinburgh the Water-of-Leith\nand the Nor-loch!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the Pow-Burn, and the Quarry-holes, and the Gusedub, ye fause\nloon!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Master George, speaking Scotch with a strong and natural\nemphasis; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is such land-loupers as you, that, with your falset and\nfair fashions, bring reproach on our whole country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod forgie me, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, much surprised at finding the\nsupposed southron converted into a native Scot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI took your honour for\nan Englisher! But I hope there was naething wrang in standing up for\nane's ain country's credit in a strange land, where all men cry her\ndown?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you call it for your country's credit, to show that she has a lying,\npuffing rascal, for one of her children?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Master George. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut come,\nman, never look grave on it,--as you have found a countryman, so you\nhave found a friend, if you deserve one--and especially if you answer me\ntruly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see nae gude it wad do me to speak ought else but truth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nworthy North Briton.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then--to begin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Master George, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suspect you are a son of\nold Mungo Moniplies, the flesher, at the West-Port.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour honour is a witch, I think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, grinning.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd how dared you, sir, to uphold him for a noble?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI dinna ken, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, scratching his head; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hear muckle\nof an Earl of Warwick in these southern parts,--Guy, I think his name\nwas,--and he has great reputation here for slaying dun cows, and boars,\nand such like; and I am sure my father has killed more cows and boars,\nnot to mention bulls, calves, sheep, ewes, lambs, and pigs, than the\nhaill Baronage of England.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo to! you are a shrewd knave,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Master George; \u00e2\u0080\u009ccharm your tongue,\nand take care of saucy answers. Your father was an honest burgher, and\nthe deacon of his craft: I am sorry to see his son in so poor a coat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndifferent, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie Moniplies, looking down on his\ngarments--\u00e2\u0080\u009cvery indifferent; but it is the wonted livery of poor\nburghers' sons in our country--one of Luckie Want's bestowing upon\nus--rest us patient! The king's leaving Scotland has taken all custom\nfrae Edinburgh; and there is hay made at the Cross, and a dainty crop\nof fouats in the Grass-market. There is as much grass grows where my\nfather's stall stood, as might have been a good bite for the beasts he\nwas used to kill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is even too true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Master George; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand while we make fortunes\nhere, our old neighbours and their families are starving at home. This\nshould be thought upon oftener.--And how came you by that broken head,\nRichie?--tell me honestly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTroth, sir, I'se no lee about the matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Moniplies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was\ncoming along the street here, and ilk ane was at me with their jests and\nroguery. So I thought to mysell, ye are ower mony for me to mell with;\nbut let me catch ye in Barford's Park, or at the fit of the Vennel, I\ncould gar some of ye sing another sang. Sae ae auld hirpling deevil of\na potter behoved just to step in my way and offer me a pig, as he\nsaid, just to put my Scotch ointment in, and I gave him a push, as but\nnatural, and the tottering deevil coupit ower amang his ain pigs, and\ndamaged a score of them. And then the reird raise, and hadna these twa\ngentlemen helped me out of it, murdered I suld hae been, without remeid.\nAnd as it was, just when they got haud of my arm to have me out of the\nfray, I got the lick that donnerit me from a left-handed lighterman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMaster George looked to the apprentices as if to demand the truth of\nthis story.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is just as he says, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Jenkin; \u00e2\u0080\u009conly I heard nothing\nabout pigs.--The people said he had broke some crockery, and that--I beg\npardon, sir--nobody could thrive within the kenning of a Scot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, no matter what they said, you were an honest fellow to help the\nweaker side.--And you, sirrah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Master George, addressing his\ncountryman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill call at my house to-morrow morning, agreeable to this\ndirection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will wait upon your honour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Scot, bowing very low; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat\nis, if my honourable master will permit me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThy master?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cHast thou any other master save Want, whose\nlivery you say you wear?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTroth, in one sense, if it please your honour, I serve twa masters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said Richie; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor both my master and me are slaves to that same beldam,\nwhom we thought to show our heels to by coming off from Scotland. So\nthat you see, sir, I hold in a sort of black ward tenure, as we call it\nin our country, being the servant of a servant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what is your master's name?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Master George; and observing that\nRichie hesitated, he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, do not tell me, if it is a secret.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA secret that there is little use in keeping,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie; \u00e2\u0080\u009conly ye\nken that our northern stomachs are ower proud to call in witnesses to\nour distress. No that my master is in mair than present pinch, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nadded, looking towards the two English apprentices, \u00e2\u0080\u009chaving a large sum\nin the Royal Treasury--that is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, in a whisper to Master\nGeorge,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe king is owing him a lot of siller; but it's ill getting at\nit, it's like.--My master is the young Lord Glenvarloch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMaster George testified surprise at the name.--\u00e2\u0080\u009c_You_ one of the young\nLord Glenvarloch's followers, and in such a condition?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTroth, and I am all the followers he has, for the present that is; and\nblithe wad I be if he were muckle better aff than I am, though I were to\nbide as I am.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have seen his father with four gentlemen and ten lackeys at his\nheels,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Master George, \u00e2\u0080\u009crustling in their laces and velvets. Well,\nthis is a changeful world, but there is a better beyond it.--The good\nold house of Glenvarloch, that stood by king and country five hundred\nyears!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour honour may say a thousand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the follower.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will say what I know to be true, friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the citizen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand not\na word more.--You seem well recovered now--can you walk?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBravely, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit was but a bit dover. I was bred at the\nWest-Port, and my cantle will stand a clour wad bring a stot down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere does your master lodge?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe pit up, an it like your honour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Scot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin a sma' house\nat the fit of ane of the wynds that gang down to the water-side, with\na decent man, John Christie, a ship-chandler, as they ca't. His father\ncame from Dundee. I wotna the name of the wynd, but it's right anent the\nmickle kirk yonder; and your honour will mind, that we pass only by our\nfamily-name of simple Mr. Nigel Olifaunt, as keeping ourselves retired\nfor the present, though in Scotland we be called the Lord Nigel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is wisely done of your master,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the citizen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will find\nout your lodgings, though your direction be none of the clearest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n So saying, and slipping a piece of money at the same time into Richie\nMoniplies's hand, he bade him hasten home, and get into no more affrays.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will take care of that now, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, with a look of\nimportance, \u00e2\u0080\u009chaving a charge about me. And so, wussing ye a' weel, with\nspecial thanks to these twa young gentlemen----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am no gentleman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin, flinging his cap on his head; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am\na tight London 'prentice, and hope to be a freeman one day. Frank may\nwrite himself gentleman, if he will.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI _was_ a gentleman once,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tunstall, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I hope I have done\nnothing to lose the name of one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWeel, weel, as ye list,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie Moniplies; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I am mickle\nbeholden to ye baith--and I am not a hair the less like to bear it in\nmind that I say but little about it just now.--Gude-night to you, my\nkind countryman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he thrust out of the sleeve of his ragged\ndoublet a long bony hand and arm, on which the muscles rose like\nwhip-cord. Master George shook it heartily, while Jenkin and Frank\nexchanged sly looks with each other.\n\nRichie Moniplies would next have addressed his thanks to the master of\nthe shop, but seeing him, as he afterwards said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cscribbling on his\nbit bookie, as if he were demented,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he contented his politeness\nwith \u00e2\u0080\u009cgiving him a hat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d touching, that is, his bonnet, in token of\nsalutation, and so left the shop.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, there goes Scotch Jockey, with all his bad and good about him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said Master George to Master David, who suspended, though unwillingly,\nthe calculations with which he was engaged, and keeping his pen within\nan inch of the tablets, gazed on his friend with great lack-lustre eyes,\nwhich expressed any thing rather than intelligence or interest in the\ndiscourse addressed to him.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat fellow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d proceeded Master George,\nwithout heeding his friend's state of abstraction, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshows, with great\nliveliness of colouring, how our Scotch pride and poverty make liars\nand braggarts of us; and yet the knave, whose every third word to an\nEnglishman is a boastful lie, will, I warrant you, be a true and tender\nfriend and follower to his master, and has perhaps parted with his\nmantle to him in the cold blast, although he himself walked _in cuerpo,_\nas the Don says.--Strange! that courage and fidelity--for I will warrant\nthat the knave is stout--should have no better companion than this\nswaggering braggadocio humour.--But you mark me not, friend Davie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do--I do, most heedfully,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Davie.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor, as the sun goeth round\nthe dial-plate in twenty-four hours, add, for the moon, fifty minutes\nand a half----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are in the seventh heavens, man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his companion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI crave your pardon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Davie.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet the wheel A go round in\ntwenty-four hours--I have it--and the wheel B in twenty-four hours,\nfifty minutes and a half--fifty-seven being to fifty-four, as fifty-nine\nto twenty-four hours, fifty minutes and a half, or very nearly,--I crave\nyour forgiveness, Master George, and heartily wish you good-even.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-even?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Master George; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy, you have not wished me good-day\nyet. Come, old friend, lay by these tablets, or you will crack the inner\nmachinery of _your_ skull, as our friend yonder has got the outer-case\nof his damaged.--Good-night, quotha! I mean not to part with you so\neasily. I came to get my four hours' nunchion from you, man, besides a\ntune on the lute from my god-daughter, Mrs. Marget.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood faith! I was abstracted, Master George--but you know me. Whenever\nI get amongst the wheels,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Ramsay, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy, 'tis----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLucky that you deal in small ones,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his friend; as, awakened from\nhis reveries and calculations, Ramsay led the way up a little back-stair\nto the first storey, occupied by his daughter and his little household.\n\nThe apprentices resumed their places in the front-shop, and relieved\nSam Porter; when Jenkin said to Tunstall--\u00e2\u0080\u009cDidst see, Frank, how the old\ngoldsmith cottoned in with his beggarly countryman? When would one\nof his wealth have shaken hands so courteously with a poor\nEnglishman?--Well, I'll say that for the best of the Scots, that they\nwill go over head and ears to serve a countryman, when they will not\nwet a nail of their finger to save a Southron, as they call us, from\ndrowning. And yet Master George is but half-bred Scot neither in that\nrespect; for I have known him do many a kind thing to the English too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut hark ye, Jenkin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tunstall, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think you are but half-bred\nEnglish yourself. How came you to strike on the Scotsman's side after\nall?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, you did so, too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Vincent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, because I saw you begin; and, besides, it is no Cumberland fashion\nto fall fifty upon one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Tunstall.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd no Christ Church fashion neither,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFair play and Old\nEngland for ever!--Besides, to tell you a secret, his voice had a twang\nin it--in the dialect I mean--reminded me of a little tongue, which I\nthink sweeter--sweeter than the last toll of St. Dunstan's will sound,\non the day that I am shot of my indentures--Ha!--you guess who I mean,\nFrank?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot I, indeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Tunstall.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cScotch Janet, I suppose, the\nlaundress.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOff with Janet in her own bucking-basket!--No, no, no!--You blind\nbuzzard,--do you not know I mean pretty Mrs. Marget?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUmph!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Tunstall, dryly.\n\nA flash of anger, not unmingled with suspicion, shot from Jenkin's keen\nblack eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUmph!--and what signifies umph? I am not the first 'prentice has\nmarried his master's daughter, I suppose?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey kept their own secret, I fancy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tunstall, \u00e2\u0080\u009cat least till\nthey were out of their time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell you what it is, Frank,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Jenkin, sharply, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat may\nbe the fashion of you gentlefolks, that are taught from your biggin to\ncarry two faces under the same hood, but it shall never be mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are the stairs, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tunstall, coolly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cgo up and ask Mrs.\nMarget of our master just now, and see what sort of a face he will wear\nunder _his_ hood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I wonnot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Jenkin; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not such a fool as that neither.\nBut I will take my own time; and all the Counts in Cumberland shall not\ncut my comb, and this is that which you may depend upon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFrancis made no reply; and they resumed their usual attention to the\nbusiness of the shop, and their usual solicitations to the passengers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\n_Bobadil._ I pray you, possess no gallant of your acquaintance with a\nknowledge of my lodging. _Master Matthew._ Who, I, sir?--Lord, sir! _Ben\nJonson._\n\nThe next morning found Nigel Olifaunt, the young Lord of Glenvarloch,\nseated, sad and solitary, in his little apartment, in the mansion\nof John Christie, the ship-chandler; which that honest tradesman, in\ngratitude perhaps to the profession from which he derived his chief\nsupport, appeared to have constructed as nearly as possible upon the\nplan of a ship's cabin.\n\nIt was situated near to Paul's Wharf, at the end of one of those\nintricate and narrow lanes, which, until that part of the city was swept\naway by the Great Fire in 1666, constituted an extraordinary labyrinth\nof small, dark, damp, and unwholesome streets and alleys, in one corner\nor other of which the plague was then as surely found lurking, as in the\nobscure corners of Constantinople in our own time. But John Christie's\nhouse looked out upon the river, and had the advantage, therefore,\nof free air, impregnated, however, with the odoriferous fumes of the\narticles in which the ship-chandler dealt, with the odour of pitch, and\nthe natural scent of the ooze and sludge left by the reflux of the tide.\n\nUpon the whole, except that his dwelling did not float with the\nflood-tide, and become stranded with the ebb, the young lord was nearly\nas comfortably accommodated as he was while on board the little trading\nbrig from the long town of Kirkaldy, in Fife, by which he had come a\npassenger to London. He received, however, every attention which could\nbe paid him by his honest landlord, John Christie; for Richie Moniplies\nhad not thought it necessary to preserve his master's _incognito_ so\ncompletely, but that the honest ship-chandler could form a guess that\nhis guest's quality was superior to his appearance.\n\nAs for Dame Nelly, his wife, a round, buxom, laughter-loving dame,\nwith black eyes, a tight well-laced bodice, a green apron, and a red\npetticoat edged with a slight silver lace, and judiciously shortened so\nas to show that a short heel, and a tight clean ankle, rested upon her\nwell-burnished shoe,--she, of course, felt interest in a young man, who,\nbesides being very handsome, good-humoured, and easily satisfied with\nthe accommodations her house afforded, was evidently of a rank, as well\nas manners, highly superior to the skippers (or Captains, as they called\nthemselves) of merchant vessels, who were the usual tenants of the\napartments which she let to hire; and at whose departure she was sure to\nfind her well-scrubbed floor soiled with the relics of tobacco, (which,\nspite of King James's Counterblast, was then forcing itself into use,)\nand her best curtains impregnated with the odour of Geneva and strong\nwaters, to Dame Nelly's great indignation; for, as she truly said, the\nsmell of the shop and warehouse was bad enough without these additions.\n\nBut all Mr. Olifaunt's habits were regular and cleanly, and his address,\nthough frank and simple, showed so much of the courtier and gentleman,\nas formed a strong contrast with the loud halloo, coarse jests, and\nboisterous impatience of her maritime inmates. Dame Nelly saw that her\nguest was melancholy also, notwithstanding his efforts to seem contented\nand cheerful; and, in short, she took that sort of interest in him,\nwithout being herself aware of the extent, which an unscrupulous gallant\nmight have been tempted to improve to the prejudice of honest John,\nwho was at least a score of years older than his helpmate. Olifaunt,\nhowever, had not only other matters to think of, but would have regarded\nsuch an intrigue, had the idea ever occurred to him, as an abominable\nand ungrateful encroachment upon the laws of hospitality, his religion\nhaving been by his late father formed upon the strict principles of the\nnational faith, and his morality upon those of the nicest honour. He\nhad not escaped the predominant weakness of his country, an overweening\nsense of the pride of birth, and a disposition to value the worth and\nconsequence of others according to the number and the fame of their\ndeceased ancestors; but this pride of family was well subdued, and\nin general almost entirely concealed, by his good sense and general\ncourtesy.\n\nSuch as we have described him, Nigel Olifaunt, or rather the young\nLord Glenvarloch, was, when our narrative takes him up, under great\nperplexity respecting the fate of his trusty and only follower, Richard\nMoniplies, who had been dispatched by his young master, early the\npreceding morning, as far as the court at Westminster, but had not yet\nreturned. His evening adventures the reader is already acquainted with,\nand so far knows more of Richie than did his master, who had not heard\nof him for twenty-four hours.\n\nDame Nelly Christie, in the meantime, regarded her guest with some\nanxiety, and a great desire to comfort him, if possible. She placed on\nthe breakfast-table a noble piece of cold powdered beef, with its usual\nguards of turnip and carrot, recommended her mustard as coming direct\nfrom her cousin at Tewkesbury, and spiced the toast with her own\nhands--and with her own hands, also, drew a jug of stout and nappy ale,\nall of which were elements of the substantial breakfast of the period.\n\nWhen she saw that her guest's anxiety prevented him from doing justice\nto the good cheer which she set before him, she commenced her career\nof verbal consolation with the usual volubility of those women in her\nstation, who, conscious of good looks, good intentions, and good lungs,\nentertain no fear either of wearying themselves or of fatiguing their\nauditors.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, what the good year! are we to send you down to Scotland as thin\nas you came up?--I am sure it would be contrary to the course of nature.\nThere was my goodman's father, old Sandie Christie, I have heard he was\nan atomy when he came up from the North, and I am sure he died, Saint\nBarnaby was ten years, at twenty stone weight. I was a bare-headed girl\nat the time, and lived in the neighbourhood, though I had little thought\nof marrying John then, who had a score of years the better of me--but he\nis a thriving man and a kind husband--and his father, as I was saying,\ndied as fat as a church-warden. Well, sir, but I hope I have not\noffended you for my little joke--and I hope the ale is to your honour's\nliking,--and the beef--and the mustard?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll excellent--all too good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Olifaunt; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have every thing\nso clean and tidy, dame, that I shall not know how to live when I go\nback to my own country--if ever I go back there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was added as it seemed involuntarily, and with a deep sigh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI warrant your honour go back again if you like it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the dame:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cunless you think rather of taking a pretty well-dowered English lady,\nas some of your countryfolk have done. I assure you, some of the best of\nthe city have married Scotsmen. There was Lady Trebleplumb, Sir Thomas\nTrebleplumb the great Turkey merchant's widow, married Sir Awley\nMacauley, whom your honour knows, doubtless; and pretty Mistress\nDoublefee, old Sergeant Doublefee's daughter, jumped out of window,\nand was married at May-fair to a Scotsman with a hard name; and old\nPitchpost the timber merchant's daughters did little better, for they\nmarried two Irishmen; and when folks jeer me about having a Scotsman\nfor lodger, meaning your honour, I tell them they are afraid of their\ndaughters and their mistresses; and sure I have a right to stand up for\nthe Scots, since John Christie is half a Scotsman, and a thriving man,\nand a good husband, though there is a score of years between us; and so\nI would have your honour cast care away, and mend your breakfast with a\nmorsel and a draught.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt a word, my kind hostess, I cannot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Olifaunt; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am anxious\nabout this knave of mine, who has been so long absent in this dangerous\ntown of yours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt may be noticed in passing that Dame Nelly's ordinary mode of\nconsolation was to disprove the existence of any cause for distress; and\nshe is said to have carried this so far as to comfort a neighbour, who\nhad lost her husband, with the assurance that the dear defunct would be\nbetter to-morrow, which perhaps might not have proved an appropriate,\neven if it had been a possible, mode of relief.\n\nOn this occasion she denied stoutly that Richie had been absent\naltogether twenty hours; and as for people being killed in the streets\nof London, to be sure two men had been found in Tower-ditch last week,\nbut that was far to the east, and the other poor man that had his throat\ncut in the fields, had met his mishap near by Islington; and he that was\nstabbed by the young Templar in a drunken frolic, by Saint Clement's\nin the Strand, was an Irishman. All which evidence she produced to show\nthat none of these casualties had occurred in a case exactly parallel\nwith that of Richie, a Scotsman, and on his return from Westminster.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy better comfort is, my good dame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Olifaunt, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the lad\nis no brawler or quarreller, unless strongly urged, and that he has\nnothing valuable about him to any one but me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour honour speaks very well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d retorted the inexhaustible hostess, who\nprotracted her task of taking away, and putting to rights, in order\nthat she might prolong her gossip. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll uphold Master Moniplies to be\nneither reveller nor brawler, for if he liked such things, he might\nbe visiting and junketing with the young folks about here in the\nneighbourhood, and he never dreams of it; and when I asked the young\nman to go as far as my gossip's, Dame Drinkwater, to taste a glass of\naniseed, and a bit of the groaning cheese,--for Dame Drinkwater has had\ntwins, as I told your honour, sir,--and I meant it quite civilly to the\nyoung man, but he chose to sit and keep house with John Christie; and\nI dare say there is a score of years between them, for your honour's\nservant looks scarce much older than I am. I wonder what they could have\nto say to each other. I asked John Christie, but he bid me go to sleep.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf he comes not soon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his master, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will thank you to tell me\nwhat magistrate I can address myself to; for besides my anxiety for the\npoor fellow's safety, he has papers of importance about him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO! your honour may be assured he will be back in a quarter of an hour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said Dame Nelly; \u00e2\u0080\u009che is not the lad to stay out twenty-four hours at a\nstretch. And for the papers, I am sure your honour will pardon him for\njust giving me a peep at the corner, as I was giving him a small cup,\nnot so large as my thimble, of distilled waters, to fortify his stomach\nagainst the damps, and it was directed to the King's Most Excellent\nMajesty; and so doubtless his Majesty has kept Richie out of civility to\nconsider of your honour's letter, and send back a fitting reply.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDame Nelly here hit by chance on a more available topic of consolation\nthan those she had hitherto touched upon; for the youthful lord had\nhimself some vague hopes that his messenger might have been delayed at\nCourt until a fitting and favourable answer should be dispatched back to\nhim. Inexperienced, however, in public affairs as he certainly was,\nit required only a moment's consideration to convince him of the\nimprobability of an expectation so contrary to all he had heard of\netiquette, as well as the dilatory proceedings in a court suit, and he\nanswered the good-natured hostess with a sigh, that he doubted whether\nthe king would even look on the paper addressed to him, far less take it\ninto his immediate consideration.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, out upon you for a faint-hearted gentleman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the good\ndame; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand why should he not do as much for us as our gracious Queen\nElizabeth? Many people say this and that about a queen and a king, but\nI think a king comes more natural to us English folks; and this good\ngentleman goes as often down by water to Greenwich, and employs as many\nof the barge-men and water-men of all kinds; and maintains, in his royal\ngrace, John Taylor, the water-poet, who keeps both a sculler and a pair\nof oars. And he has made a comely Court at Whitehall, just by the river;\nand since the king is so good a friend to the Thames, I cannot see,\nif it please your honour, why all his subjects, and your honour in\nspecialty, should not have satisfaction by his hands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue, dame--true,--let us hope for the best; but I must take my cloak\nand rapier, and pray your husband in courtesy to teach me the way to a\nmagistrate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSure, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the prompt dame, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can do that as well as he, who has\nbeen a slow man of his tongue all his life, though I will give him his\ndue for being a loving husband, and a man as well to pass in the world\nas any betwixt us and the top of the lane. And so there is the sitting\nalderman, that is always at the Guildhall, which is close by Paul's, and\nso I warrant you he puts all to rights in the city that wisdom can mend;\nand for the rest there is no help but patience. But I wish I were as\nsure of forty pounds as I am that the young man will come back safe and\nsound.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOlifaunt, in great and anxious doubt of what the good dame so strongly\naverred, flung his cloak on one shoulder, and was about to belt on his\nrapier, when first the voice of Richie Moniplies on the stair, and\nthen that faithful emissary's appearance in the chamber, put the matter\nbeyond question. Dame Nelly, after congratulating Moniplies on his\nreturn, and paying several compliments to her own sagacity for having\nforetold it, was at length pleased to leave the apartment. The truth\nwas, that, besides some instinctive feelings of good breeding which\ncombated her curiosity, she saw there was no chance of Richie's\nproceeding in his narrative while she was in the room, and she therefore\nretreated, trusting that her own address would get the secret out of one\nor other of the young men, when she should have either by himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, in Heaven's name, what is the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel\nOlifaunt.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere have you been, or what have you been about? You look\nas pale as death. There is blood on your hand, and your clothes are\ntorn. What barns-breaking have you been at? You have been drunk,\nRichard, and fighting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFighting I have been,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richard, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin a small way; but for being\ndrunk, that's a job ill to manage in this town, without money to come\nby liquor; and as for barns-breaking, the deil a thing's broken but my\nhead. It's not made of iron, I wot, nor my claithes of chenzie-mail; so\na club smashed the tane, and a claught damaged the tither. Some misleard\nrascals abused my country, but I think I cleared the causey of them.\nHowever, the haill hive was ower mony for me at last, and I got this\neclipse on the crown, and then I was carried, beyond my kenning, to\na sma' booth at the Temple Port, whare they sell the whirligigs and\nmony-go-rounds that measure out time as a man wad measure a tartan\nweb; and then they bled me, wold I nold I, and were reasonably civil,\nespecially an auld country-man of ours, of whom more hereafter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd at what o'clock might this be?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe twa iron carles yonder, at the kirk beside the Port, were just\nbanging out sax o' the clock.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd why came you not home as soon as you recovered?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn troth, my lord, every _why_ has its _wherefore_, and this has a gude\nane,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered his follower. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo come hame, I behoved to ken whare hame\nwas; now, I had clean tint the name of the wynd, and the mair I asked,\nthe mair the folk leugh, and the farther they sent me wrang; sae I gave\nit up till God should send daylight to help me; and as I saw mysell near\na kirk at the lang run, I e'en crap in to take up my night's quarters in\nthe kirkyard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the churchyard?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel--\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I need not ask what drove you to\nsuch a pinch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt wasna sae much the want o' siller, my Lord Nigel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie,\nwith an air of mysterious importance, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I was no sae absolute without\nmeans, of whilk mair anon; but I thought I wad never ware a saxpence\nsterling on ane of their saucy chamberlains at a hostelry, sae lang as\nI could sleep fresh and fine in a fair, dry, spring night. Mony a time,\nwhen I hae come hame ower late, and faund the West-Port steekit, and the\nwaiter ill-willy, I have garr'd the sexton of Saint Cuthbert's calf-ward\nserve me for my quarters. But then there are dainty green graffs in\nSaint Cuthbert's kirkyard, whare ane may sleep as if they were in a\ndown-bed, till they hear the lavrock singing up in the air as high as\nthe Castle; whereas, and behold, these London kirkyards are causeyed\nwith through-stanes, panged hard and fast thegither; and my cloak being\nsomething threadbare, made but a thin mattress, so I was fain to give\nup my bed before every limb about me was crippled. Dead folks may sleep\nyonder sound enow, but deil haet else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what became of you next?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his master.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI just took to a canny bulkhead, as they ca' them here; that is, the\nboards on the tap of their bits of outshots of stalls and booths,\nand there I sleepit as sound as if I was in a castle. Not but I was\ndisturbed with some of the night-walking queans and swaggering billies,\nbut when they found there was nothing to be got by me but a slash of my\nAndrew Ferrara, they bid me good-night for a beggarly Scot; and I was\ne'en weel pleased to be sae cheap rid of them. And in the morning, I cam\ndaikering here, but sad wark I had to find the way, for I had been\neast as far as the place they ca' Mile-End, though it is mair like\nsax-mile-end.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Richie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am glad all this has ended so\nwell--go get something to eat. I am sure you need it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn troth do I, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Moniplies; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut, with your lordship's\nleave--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cForget the lordship for the present, Richie, as I have often told you\nbefore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFaith,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could weel forget that your honour was a\nlord, but then I behoved to forget that I am a lord's man, and that's\nnot so easy. But, however,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, assisting his description with the\nthumb and the two forefingers of his right hand, thrust out after the\nfashion of a bird's claw, while the little finger and ring-finger were\nclosed upon the palm, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto the Court I went, and my friend that promised\nme a sight of his Majesty's most gracious presence, was as gude as\nhis word, and carried me into the back offices, where I got the best\nbreakfast I have had since we came here, and it did me gude for the rest\nof the day; for as to what I have eaten in this accursed town, it is aye\nsauced with the disquieting thought that it maun be paid for. After a',\nthere was but beef banes and fat brose; but king's cauff, your honour\nkens, is better than ither folk's corn; at ony rate, it was a' in free\nawmous.--But I see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, stopping short, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat your honour waxes\nimpatient.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy no means, Richie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young nobleman, with an air of\nresignation, for he well knew his domestic would not mend his pace for\ngoading; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have suffered enough in the embassy to have a right to\ntell the story in your own way. Only let me pray for the name of the\nfriend who was to introduce you into the king's presence. You were very\nmysterious on the subject, when you undertook, through his means, to\nhave the Supplication put into his Majesty's own hands, since those\nsent heretofore, I have every reason to think, went no farther than his\nsecretary's.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWeel, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI did not tell you his name and quality\nat first, because I thought you would be affronted at the like of him\nhaving to do in your lordship's affairs. But mony a man climbs up in\nCourt by waur help. It was just Laurie Linklater, one of the yeomen of\nthe kitchen, that was my father's apprentice lang syne.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA yeoman in the kitchen--a scullion!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Lord Nigel, pacing the\nroom in displeasure.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut consider, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, composedly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat a' your great\nfriends hung back, and shunned to own you, or to advocate your petition;\nand then, though I am sure I wish Laurie a higher office, for your\nlordship's sake and for mine, and specially for his ain sake, being a\nfriendly lad, yet your lordship must consider, that a scullion, if a\nyeoman of the king's most royal kitchen may be called a scullion, may\nweel rank with a master-cook elsewhere; being that king's cauff, as I\nsaid before, is better than--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are right, and I was wrong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young nobleman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no\nchoice of means of making my case known, so that they be honest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLaurie is as honest a lad as ever lifted a ladle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot\nbut what I dare to say he can lick his fingers like other folk, and\nreason good. But, in fine, for I see your honour is waxing impatient, he\nbrought me to the palace, where a' was astir for the king going out to\nhunt or hawk on Blackheath, I think they ca'd it. And there was a horse\nstood with all the quarries about it, a bonny grey as ever was foaled;\nand the saddle and the stirrups, and the curb and bit, o' burning gowd,\nor silver gilded at least; and down, sir, came the king, with all his\nnobles, dressed out in his hunting-suit of green, doubly laced, and laid\ndown with gowd. I minded the very face o' him, though it was lang since\nI saw him. But my certie, lad, thought I, times are changed since ye\ncame fleeing down the back stairs of auld Holyrood House, in grit fear,\nhaving your breeks in your hand without time to put them on, and Frank\nStewart, the wild Earl of Bothwell, hard at your haunches; and if auld\nLord Glenvarloch hadna cast his mantle about his arm, and taken bluidy\nwounds mair than ane in your behalf, you wald not have craw'd sae\ncrouse this day; and so saying, I could not but think your lordship's\nSifflication could not be less than most acceptable; and so I banged\nin among the crowd of lords. Laurie thought me mad, and held me by the\ncloak-lap till the cloth rave in his hand; and so I banged in right\nbefore the king just as he mounted, and crammed the Sifflication into\nhis hand, and he opened it like in amaze; and just as he saw the first\nline, I was minded to make a reverence, and I had the ill luck to hit\nhis jaud o' a beast on the nose with my hat, and scaur the creature,\nand she swarved aside, and the king, that sits na mickle better than a\ndraff-pock on the saddle, was like to have gotten a clean coup, and that\nmight have cost my craig a raxing-and he flung down the paper amang the\nbeast's feet, and cried, 'Away wi' the fause loon that brought it!' And\nthey grippit me, and cried treason; and I thought of the Ruthvens that\nwere dirked in their ain house, for, it may be, as small a forfeit.\nHowever, they spak only of scourging me, and had me away to the porter's\nlodge to try the tawse on my back, and I was crying mercy as loud as\nI could; and the king, when he had righted himself on the saddle, and\ngathered his breath, cried to do me nae harm; for, said he, he is ane\nof our ain Norland stots, I ken by the rowt of him,--and they a'\nlaughed and rowted loud eneugh. And then he said, 'Gie him a copy of\nthe Proclamation, and let him go down to the North by the next light\ncollier, before waur come o't.' So they let me go, and rode out, a\nsniggering, laughing, and rounding in ilk ither's lugs. A sair life I\nhad wi' Laurie Linklater; for he said it wad be the ruin of him. And\nthen, when I told him it was in your matter, he said if he had known\nbefore he would have risked a scauding for you, because he minded\nthe brave old lord, your father. And then he showed how I suld have\ndone,--and that I suld have held up my hand to my brow, as if the\ngrandeur of the king and his horse-graith thegither had casten the\nglaiks in my een, and mair jackanape tricks I suld hae played, instead\nof offering the Sifflication, he said, as if I had been bringing guts to\na bear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Footnote: I am certain this prudential advice is not original\non Mr. Linklater's part, but I am not at present able to produce my\nauthority. I think it amounted to this, that James flung down a petition\npresented by some supplicant who paid no compliments to his horse,\nand expressed no admiration at the splendour of his furniture, saying,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShall a king cumber himself about the petition of a beggar, while\nthe beggar disregards the king's splendour?\u00e2\u0080\u009d It is, I think, Sir John\nHarrington who recommends, as a sure mode to the king's favour, to\npraise the paces of the royal palfrey.]\n\n'For,' said he, 'Richie, the king is a weel-natured and just man of\nhis ain kindly nature, but he has a wheen maggots that maun be cannily\nguided; and then, Richie,' says he, in a very laigh tone, 'I would tell\nit to nane but a wise man like yoursell, but the king has them about him\nwad corrupt an angel from heaven; but I could have gi'en you avisement\nhow to have guided him, but now it's like after meat mustard.'--'Aweel,\naweel, Laurie,' said I, 'it may be as you say', but since I am clear of\nthe tawse and the porter's lodge, sifflicate wha like, deil hae Richie\nMoniplies if he come sifflicating here again.'--And so away I came, and\nI wasna far by the Temple Port, or Bar, or whatever they ca' it, when I\nmet with the misadventure that I tauld you of before.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, my honest Richie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour attempt was well meant,\nand not so ill conducted, I think, as to have deserved so bad an issue;\nbut go to your beef and mustard, and we'll talk of the rest afterwards.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is nae mair to be spoken, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his follower, \u00e2\u0080\u009cexcept that\nI met ane very honest, fair-spoken, weel-put-on gentleman, or rather\nburgher, as I think, that was in the whigmaleery man's back-shop; and\nwhen he learned wha I was, behold he was a kindly Scot himsell, and,\nwhat is more, a town's-bairn o' the gude town, and he behoved to compel\nme to take this Portugal piece, to drink, forsooth--my certie, thought\nI, we ken better, for we will eat it--and he spoke of paying your\nlordship a visit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou did not tell him where I lived, you knave?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lord Nigel,\nangrily. \u00e2\u0080\u009c'Sdeath! I shall have every clownish burgher from Edinburgh\ncome to gaze on my distress, and pay a shilling for having seen the\nmotion of the Poor Noble!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell him where you lived?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, evading the question; \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow\ncould I tell him what I kendna mysell? If I had minded the name of the\nwynd, I need not have slept in the kirkyard yestreen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSee, then, that you give no one notice of our lodging,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young\nnobleman; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthose with whom I have business I can meet at Paul's, or in\nthe Court of Requests.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is steeking the stable-door when the steed is stolen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought\nRichie to himself; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I must put him on another pin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo thinking, he asked the young lord what was in the Proclamation which\nhe still held folded in his hand; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor, having little time to spell at\nit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour lordship well knows I ken nought about it but the\ngrand blazon at the tap--the lion has gotten a claught of our auld\nScottish shield now, but it was as weel upheld when it had a unicorn on\nilk side of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLord Nigel read the Proclamation, and he coloured deep with shame and\nindignation as he read; for the purport was, to his injured feelings,\nlike the pouring of ardent spirits upon a recent wound.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat deil's in the paper, my lord?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, unable to suppress his\ncuriosity as he observed his master change colour; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wadna ask such a\nthing, only the Proclamation is not a private thing, but is meant for a'\nmen's hearing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is indeed meant for all men's hearing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Lord Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand it\nproclaims the shame of our country, and the ingratitude of our Prince.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow the Lord preserve us! and to publish it in London, too!\u00e2\u0080\u009d ejaculated\nMoniplies.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHark ye, Richard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel Olifaunt, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin this paper the Lords of the\nCouncil set forth, that, 'in consideration of the resort of idle persons\nof low condition forth from his Majesty's kingdom of Scotland to his\nEnglish Court--filling the same with their suits and supplications,\nand dishonouring the royal presence with their base, poor, and beggarly\npersons, to the disgrace of their country in the estimation of the\nEnglish; these are to prohibit the skippers, masters of vessels\nand others, in every part of Scotland, from bringing such miserable\ncreatures up to Court under pain of fine and impisonment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d'\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI marle the skipper took us on board,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you need not marvel how you are to get back again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord\nNigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor here is a clause which says, that such idle suitors are to\nbe transported back to Scotland at his Majesty's expense, and punished\nfor their audacity with stripes, stocking, or incarceration, according\nto their demerits--that is to say, I suppose, according to the degree of\ntheir poverty, for I see no other demerit specified.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis will scarcely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009csquare with our old proverb--\n\n     A King's face\n     Should give grace--\n\nBut what says the paper farther, my lord?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, only a small clause which especially concerns us, making some still\nheavier denunciations against those suitors who shall be so bold as to\napproach the Court, under pretext of seeking payment of old debts due\nto them by the king, which, the paper states, is, of all species of\nimportunity, that which is most odious to his Majesty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe king has neighbours in that matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it is not\nevery one that can shift off that sort of cattle so easily as he does.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTheir conversation was here interrupted by a knocking at the door.\nOlifaunt looked out at the window, and saw an elderly respectable person\nwhom he knew not. Richie also peeped, and recognised, but, recognising,\nchose not to acknowledge, his friend of the preceding evening. Afraid\nthat his share in the visit might be detected, he made his escape out\nof the apartment under pretext of going to his breakfast; and left their\nlandlady the task of ushering Master George into Lord Nigel's apartment,\nwhich she performed with much courtesy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\n  Ay, sir, the clouted shoe hath oft times craft in't,\n  As says the rustic proverb; and your citizen,\n  In's grogram suit, gold chain, and well-black'd shoes,\n  Bears under his flat cap ofttimes a brain\n  Wiser than burns beneath the cap and feather,\n  Or seethes within the statesman's velvet nightcap.\n                               _Read me my Riddle._\n\nThe young Scottish nobleman received the citizen with distant\npoliteness, expressing that sort of reserve by which those of the higher\nranks are sometimes willing to make a plebeian sensible that he is an\nintruder. But Master George seemed neither displeased nor disconcerted.\nHe assumed the chair, which, in deference to his respectable appearance,\nLord Nigel offered to him, and said, after a moment's pause, during\nwhich he had looked attentively at the young man, with respect not\nunmingled with emotion--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will forgive me for this rudeness, my\nlord; but I was endeavouring to trace in your youthful countenance the\nfeatures of my good old lord, your excellent father.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was a moment's pause ere young Glenvarloch replied, still with\na reserved manner,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been reckoned like my father, sir; and am\nhappy to see any one that respects his memory. But the business which\ncalls me to this city is of a hasty as well as a private nature, and--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand the hint, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Master George, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand would not\nbe guilty of long detaining you from business, or more agreeable\nconversation. My errand is almost done when I have said that my name is\nGeorge Heriot, warmly befriended, and introduced into the employment\nof the Royal Family of Scotland, more than twenty years since, by your\nexcellent father; and that, learning from a follower of yours that your\nlordship was in this city in prosecution of some business of importance,\nit is my duty,--it is my pleasure,--to wait on the son of my respected\npatron; and, as I am somewhat known both at the Court, and in the city,\nto offer him such aid in the furthering of his affairs as my credit and\nexperience may be able to afford.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no doubt of either, Master Heriot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I\nthank you heartily for the good-will with which you have placed them at\na stranger's disposal; but my business at Court is done and ended, and\nI intend to leave London and, indeed, the island, for foreign travel\nand military service. I may add, that the suddenness of my departure\noccasions my having little time at my disposal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMaster Heriot did not take the hint, but sat fast, with an embarrassed\ncountenance however, like one who had something to say that he knew not\nexactly how to make effectual. At length he said, with a dubious smile,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are fortunate, my lord, in having so soon dispatched your business\nat Court. Your talking landlady informs me you have been but a fortnight\nin this city. It is usually months and years ere the Court and a suitor\nshake hands and part.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy business,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Nigel, with a brevity which was intended to\nstop further discussion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas summarily dispatched.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nStill Master Heriot remained seated, and there was a cordial good-humour\nadded to the reverence of his appearance, which rendered it impossible\nfor Lord Nigel to be more explicit in requesting his absence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour lordship has not yet had time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the citizen, still attempting\nto sustain the conversation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto visit the places of amusement,--the\nplayhouses, and other places to which youth resort. But I see in your\nlordship's hand one of the new-invented plots of the piece, [Footnote:\nMeaning, probably, playbills.] which they hand about of late--May I ask\nwhat play?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! a well-known piece,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Nigel, impatiently throwing down\nthe Proclamation, which he had hitherto been twisting to and fro in\nhis hand,--\u00e2\u0080\u009can excellent and well-approved piece--_A New Way to Pay Old\nDebts._\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMaster Heriot stooped down, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! my old acquaintance, Philip\nMassinger;\u00e2\u0080\u009d but, having opened the paper and seen the purport, he looked\nat Lord Nigel with surprise, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI trust your lordship does not\nthink this prohibition can extend either to _your_ person or your\nclaims?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should scarce have thought so myself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young nobleman; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut\nso it proves. His Majesty, to close this discourse at once, has been\npleased to send me this Proclamation, in answer to a respectful\nSupplication for the repayment of large loans advanced by my father for\nthe service of the State, in the king's utmost emergencies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is impossible!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the citizen--\u00e2\u0080\u009cit is absolutely impossible!--If\nthe king could forget what was due to your father's memory, still\nhe would not have wished--would not, I may say, have dared--to be so\nflagrantly unjust to the memory of such a man as your father, who, dead\nin the body, will long live in the memory of the Scottish people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should have been of your opinion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lord Nigel, in the same\ntone as before; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut there is no fighting with facts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat was the tenor of this Supplication?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cor by whom was\nit presented? Something strange there must have been in the contents, or\nelse--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may see my original draught,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young lord, taking it out\nof a small travelling strong-box; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe technical part is by my lawyer in\nScotland, a skilful and sensible man; the rest is my own, drawn, I hope,\nwith due deference and modesty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMaster Heriot hastly cast his eye over the draught. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ccan be more well-tempered and respectful. Is it possible the king can\nhave treated this petition with contempt?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe threw it down on the pavement,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lord of Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand\nsent me for answer that Proclamation, in which he classes me with the\npaupers and mendicants from Scotland, who disgrace his Court in the eyes\nof the proud English--that is all. Had not my father stood by him with\nheart, sword, and fortune, he might never have seen the Court of England\nhimself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut by whom was this Supplication presented, my lord?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cfor the distaste taken at the messenger will sometimes extend itself to\nthe message.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my servant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lord Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cby the man you saw, and, I think,\nwere kind to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy your servant, my lord?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the citizen; \u00e2\u0080\u009che seems a shrewd fellow,\nand doubtless a faithful; but surely--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou would say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009che is no fit messenger to a king's\npresence?--Surely he is not; but what could I do? Every attempt I had\nmade to lay my case before the king had miscarried, and my petitions\ngot no farther than the budgets of clerks and secretaries; this fellow\npretended he had a friend in the household that would bring him to the\nking's presence,--and so--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut, my lord, why should you not, in\nright of your rank and birth, have appeared at Court, and required an\naudience, which could not have been denied to you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young lord blushed a little, and looked at his dress, which was very\nplain; and, though in perfect good order, had the appearance of having\nseen service.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know not why I should be ashamed of speaking the truth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,\nafter a momentary hesitation,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI had no dress suitable for appearing\nat Court. I am determined to incur no expenses which I cannot discharge;\nand I think you, sir, would not advise me to stand at the palace-door,\nin person, and deliver my petition, along with those who are in very\ndeed pleading their necessity, and begging an alms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat had been, indeed, unseemly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the citizen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut yet, my lord,\nmy mind runs strangely that there must be some mistake.--Can I speak\nwith your domestic?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see little good it can do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the young lord, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut the\ninterest you take in my misfortunes seems sincere, and therefore----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n He stamped on the floor, and in a few seconds afterwards Moniplies\nappeared, wiping from his beard and mustaches the crumbs of bread,\nand the froth of the ale-pot, which plainly showed how he had been\nemployed.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill your lordship grant permission,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I\nask your groom a few questions?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis lordship's page, Master George,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Moniplies, with a nod of\nacknowledgment, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you are minded to speak according to the letter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHold your saucy tongue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his master, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand reply distinctly to the\nquestions you are to be asked.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd _truly,_ if it like your pageship,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the citizen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor you may\nremember I have a gift to discover falset.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWeel, weel, weel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the domestic, somewhat embarrassed, in spite\nof his effrontery--\u00e2\u0080\u009cthough I think that the sort of truth that serves my\nmaster, may weel serve ony ane else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPages lie to their masters by right of custom,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the citizen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand\nyou write yourself in that band, though I think you be among the oldest\nof such springalds; but to me you must speak truth, if you would not\nhave it end in the whipping-post.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that's e'en a bad resting-place,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the well-grown page; \u00e2\u0080\u009cso\ncome away with your questions, Master George.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d demanded the citizen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am given to understand that you\nyesterday presented to his Majesty's hand a Supplication, or petition,\nfrom this honourable lord, your master.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTroth, there's nae gainsaying that, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Moniplies; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\nwere enow to see it besides me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you pretend that his Majesty flung it from him with contempt?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nthe citizen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTake heed, for I have means of knowing the truth; and you\nwere better up to the neck in the Nor-Loch, which you like so well, than\ntell a leasing where his Majesty's name is concerned.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is nae occasion for leasing-making about the matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered\nMoniplies, firmly; \u00e2\u0080\u009chis Majesty e'en flung it frae him as if it had\ndirtied his fingers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou hear, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Olifaunt, addressing Heriot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHush!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the sagacious citizen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis fellow is not ill named--he\nhas more plies than one in his cloak. Stay, fellow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d for Moniplies,\nmuttering somewhat about finishing his breakfast, was beginning to\nshamble towards the door, \u00e2\u0080\u009canswer me this farther question--When you\ngave your master's petition to his Majesty, gave you nothing with it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOu, what should I give wi' it, ye ken, Master George?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is what I desire and insist to know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied his interrogator.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWeel, then--I am not free to say, that maybe I might not just slip\ninto the king's hand a wee bit Sifflication of mine ain, along with my\nlord's--just to save his Majesty trouble--and that he might consider\nthem baith at ance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA supplication of your own, you varlet!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his master.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOu dear, ay, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie--\u00e2\u0080\u009cpuir bodies hae their bits of\nsifflications as weel as their betters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd pray, what might your worshipful petition import?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Master\nHeriot.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, for Heaven's sake, my lord, keep your patience, or we\nshall never learn the truth of this strange matter.--Speak out, sirrah,\nand I will stand your friend with my lord.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's a lang story to tell--but the upshot is, that it's a scrape of an\nauld accompt due to my father's yestate by her Majesty the king's maist\ngracious mother, when she lived in the Castle, and had sundry providings\nand furnishings forth of our booth, whilk nae doubt was an honour to\nmy father to supply, and whilk, doubtless, it will be a credit to his\nMajesty to satisfy, as it will be grit convenience to me to receive the\nsaam.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat string of impertinence is this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his master.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery word as true as e'er John Knox spoke,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie; \u00e2\u0080\u009chere's the\nbit double of the Sifflication.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMaster George took a crumpled paper from the fellow's hand, and said,\nmuttering betwixt his teeth--\u00e2\u0080\u009c'Humbly showeth--um--um--his Majesty's\nmaist gracious mother--um--um--justly addebted and owing the sum of\nfifteen merks--the compt whereof followeth--Twelve nowte's feet for\njellies--ane lamb, being Christmas--ane roasted capin in grease for\nthe privy chalmer, when my Lord of Bothwell suppit with her Grace.'--I\nthink, my lord, you can hardly be surprised that the king gave this\npetition a brisk reception; and I conclude, Master Page, that you took\ncare to present your own Supplication before your master's?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTroth did I not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Moniplies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought to have given my\nlord's first, as was reason gude; and besides that, it wad have redd the\ngate for my ain little bill. But what wi' the dirdum an' confusion, an'\nthe loupin here and there of the skeigh brute of a horse, I believe I\ncrammed them baith into his hand cheek-by-jowl, and maybe my ain was\nbunemost; and say there was aught wrang, I am sure I had a' the fright\nand a' the risk--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd shall have all the beating, you rascal knave,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cam I to\nbe insulted and dishonoured by your pragmatical insolence, in blending\nyour base concerns with mine?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, nay, nay, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the good-humoured citizen, interposing,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been the means of bringing the fellow's blunder to light--allow\nme interest enough with your lordship to be bail for his bones. You\nhave cause to be angry, but still I think the knave mistook more out of\nconceit than of purpose; and I judge you will have the better service of\nhim another time, if you overlook this fault--Get you gone, sirrah--I'll\nmake your peace.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNa, na,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Moniplies, keeping his ground firmly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif he likes to\nstrike a lad that has followed him for pure love, for I think there has\nbeen little servant's fee between us, a' the way frae Scotland, just\nlet my lord be doing, and see the credit he will get by it--and I would\nrather (mony thanks to you though, Master George) stand by a lick of his\nbaton, than it suld e'er be said a stranger came between us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his master, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand get out of my sight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAweel I wot that is sune done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Moniplies, retiring slowly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI did\nnot come without I had been ca'd for--and I wad have been away half an\nhour since with my gude will, only Maister George keepit me to answer\nhis interrogation, forsooth, and that has made a' this stir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd so he made his grumbling exit, with the tone much rather of one who\nhas sustained an injury, than who has done wrong.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere never was a man so plagued as I am with a malapert knave!--The\nfellow is shrewd, and I have found him faithful--I believe he loves me,\ntoo, and he has given proofs of it--but then he is so uplifted in his\nown conceit, so self-willed, and so self-opinioned, that he seems to\nbecome the master and I the man; and whatever blunder he commits, he is\nsure to make as loud complaints, as if the whole error lay with me, and\nin no degree with himself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCherish him, and maintain him, nevertheless,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the citizen;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cfor believe my grey hairs, that affection and fidelity are now rarer\nqualities in a servitor, than when the world was younger. Yet, trust\nhim, my good lord, with no commission above his birth or breeding, for\nyou see yourself how it may chance to fall.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is but too evident, Master Heriot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young nobleman; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I\nam sorry I have done injustice to my sovereign, and your master. But I\nam, like a true Scotsman, wise behind hand--the mistake has happened--my\nSupplication has been refused, and my only resource is to employ the\nrest of my means to carry Moniplies and myself to some counter-scarp,\nand die in the battle-front like my ancestors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt were better to live and serve your country like your noble father,\nmy lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Master George. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, nay, never look down or shake\nyour head--the king has not refused your Supplication, for he has not\nseen it--you ask but justice, and that his place obliges him to give to\nhis subjects--ay, my lord, and I will say that his natural temper doth\nin this hold bias with his duty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI were well pleased to think so, and yet----\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel Olifaunt,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nspeak not of my own wrongs, but my country hath many that are\nunredressed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Master Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI speak of my royal master, not only\nwith the respect due from a subject--the gratitude to be paid by a\nfavoured servant, but also with the frankness of a free and loyal\nScotsman. The king is himself well disposed to hold the scales of\njustice even; but there are those around him who can throw without\ndetection their own selfish wishes and base interests into the scale.\nYou are already a sufferer by this, and without your knowing it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am surprised, Master Heriot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young lord, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto hear you, upon\nso short an acquaintance, talk as if you were familiarly acquainted with\nmy affairs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the goldsmith, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe nature of my employment affords\nme direct access to the interior of the palace; I am well known to be no\nmeddler in intrigues or party affairs, so that no favourite has as yet\nendeavoured to shut against me the door of the royal closet; on the\ncontrary, I have stood well with each while he was in power, and I have\nnot shared the fall of any. But I cannot be thus connected with the\nCourt, without hearing, even against my will, what wheels are in motion,\nand how they are checked or forwarded. Of course, when I choose to seek\nsuch intelligence, I know the sources in which it is to be traced. I\nhave told you why I was interested in your lordship's fortunes. It was\nlast night only that I knew you were in this city, yet I have been\nable, in coming hither this morning, to gain for you some information\nrespecting the impediments to your suit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir, I am obliged by your zeal, however little it may be merited,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered Nigel, still with some reserve; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyet I hardly know how I have\ndeserved this interest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst let me satisfy you that it is real,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the citizen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI blame\nyou not for being unwilling to credit the fair professions of a stranger\nin my inferior class of society, when you have met so little friendship\nfrom relations, and those of your own rank, bound to have assisted\nyou by so many ties. But mark the cause. There is a mortgage over your\nfather's extensive estate, to the amount of 40,000 merks, due ostensibly\nto Peregrine Peterson, the Conservator of Scottish Privileges at\nCampvere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know nothing of a mortgage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young lord; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut there is\na wadset for such a sum, which, if unredeemed, will occasion the\nforfeiture of my whole paternal estate, for a sum not above a fourth\nof its value--and it is for that very reason that I press the king's\ngovernment for a settlement of the debts due to my father, that I may be\nable to redeem my land from this rapacious creditor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA wadset in Scotland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis the same with a mortgage\non this side of the Tweed; but you are not acquainted with your real\ncreditor. The Conservator Peterson only lends his name to shroud no less\na man than the Lord Chancellor of Scotland, who hopes, under cover\nof this debt, to gain possession of the estate himself, or perhaps to\ngratify a yet more powerful third party. He will probably suffer\nhis creature Peterson to take possession, and when the odium of the\ntransaction shall be forgotten, the property and lordship of Glenvarloch\nwill be conveyed to the great man by his obsequious instrument, under\ncover of a sale, or some similar device.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan this be possible?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Chancellor wept when I\ntook leave of him--called me his cousin--even his son--furnished me with\nletters, and, though I asked him for no pecuniary assistance, excused\nhimself unnecessarily for not pressing it on me, alleging the expenses\nof his rank and his large family. No, I cannot believe a nobleman would\ncarry deceit so far.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not, it is true, of noble blood,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the citizen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut once more\nI bid you look on my grey hairs, and think what can be my interest in\ndishonouring them with falsehood in affairs in which I have no interest,\nsave as they regard the son of my benefactor. Reflect also, have you had\nany advantage from the Lord Chancellor's letters?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel Olifaunt, \u00e2\u0080\u009cexcept cold deeds and fair words. I have\nthought for some time, their only object was to get rid of me--one\nyesterday pressed money on me when I talked of going abroad, in order\nthat I might not want the means of exiling myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRight,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009crather than you fled not, they would themselves\nfurnish wings for you to fly withal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will to him this instant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the incensed youth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand tell him my\nmind of his baseness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnder your favour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot, detaining him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou shall not do so.\nBy a quarrel you would become the ruin of me your informer; and though\nI would venture half my shop to do your lordship a service, I think you\nwould hardly wish me to come by damage, when it can be of no service to\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe word _shop_ sounded harshly in the ear of the young nobleman, who\nreplied hastily--\u00e2\u0080\u009cDamage, sir?--so far am I from wishing you to incur\ndamage, that I would to Heaven you would cease your fruitless offers of\nserving one whom there is no chance of ultimately assisting!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLeave me alone for that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the citizen: \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have now erred as far\non the bow-hand. Permit me to take this Supplication--I will have it\nsuitably engrossed, and take my own time (and it shall be an early one)\nfor placing it, with more prudence, I trust, than that used by your\nfollower, in the king's hand--I will almost answer for his taking up the\nmatter as you would have him--but should he fail to do so, even then I\nwill not give up the good cause.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young nobleman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour speech is so friendly, and my own\nstate so helpless, that I know not how to refuse your kind proffer, even\nwhile I blush to accept it at the hands of a stranger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are, I trust, no longer such,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the goldsmith; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand for my\nguerdon, when my mediation proves successful, and your fortunes are\nre-established, you shall order your first cupboard of plate from George\nHeriot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou would have a bad paymaster, Master Heriot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not fear that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the goldsmith; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I am glad to see you\nsmile, my lord--methinks it makes you look still more like the good old\nlord your father; and it emboldens me, besides, to bring out a small\nrequest--that you would take a homely dinner with me to-morrow. I lodge\nhard by in Lombard Street. For the cheer, my lord, a mess of white\nbroth, a fat capon well larded, a dish of beef collops for auld\nScotland's sake, and it may be a cup of right old wine, that was\nbarrelled before Scotland and England were one nation--Then for company,\none or two of our own loving countrymen--and maybe my housewife may find\nout a bonny Scots lass or so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would accept your courtesy, Master Heriot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I hear\nthe city ladies of London like to see a man gallant--I would not like to\nlet down a Scottish nobleman in their ideas, as doubtless you have said\nthe best of our poor country, and I rather lack the means of bravery for\nthe present.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord, your frankness leads me a step farther,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Master George.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI--I owed your father some monies; and--nay, if your lordship looks at\nme so fixedly, I shall never tell my story--and, to speak plainly, for\nI never could carry a lie well through in my life--it is most fitting,\nthat, to solicit this matter properly, your lordship should go to\nCourt in a manner beseeming your quality. I am a goldsmith, and live\nby lending money as well as by selling plate. I am ambitious to put an\nhundred pounds to be at interest in your hands, till your affairs are\nsettled.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if they are never favourably settled?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned the citizen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe miscarriage of such a sum\nwill be of little consequence to me, compared with other subjects of\nregret.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster Heriot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lord Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour favour is generously\noffered, and shall be frankly accepted. I must presume that you see your\nway through this business, though I hardly do; for I think you would be\ngrieved to add any fresh burden to me, by persuading me to incur debts\nwhich I am not likely to discharge. I will therefore take your\nmoney, under the hope and trust that you will enable me to repay you\npunctually.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will convince you, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the goldsmith, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I mean to deal\nwith you as a creditor from whom I expect payment; and therefore, you\nshall, with your own good pleasure, sign an acknowledgment for these\nmonies, and an obligation to content and repay me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe then took from his girdle his writing materials, and, writing a few\nlines to the purport he expressed, pulled out a small bag of gold from\na side-pouch under his cloak, and, observing that it should contain an\nhundred pounds, proceeded to tell out the contents very methodically\nupon the table. Nigel Olifaunt could not help intimating that this was\nan unnecessary ceremonial, and that he would take the bag of gold on the\nword of his obliging creditor; but this was repugnant to the old man's\nforms of transacting business.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBear with me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy good lord,--we citizens are a wary and\nthrifty generation; and I should lose my good name for ever within\nthe toll of Paul's, were I to grant quittance, or take acknowledgment,\nwithout bringing the money to actual tale. I think it be right now--and,\nbody of me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, looking out at the window, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyonder come my boys\nwith my mule; for I must Westward Hoe. Put your monies aside, my lord;\nit is not well to be seen with such goldfinches chirping about one in\nthe lodgings of London. I think the lock of your casket be indifferent\ngood; if not, I can serve you at an easy rate with one that has held\nthousands;--it was the good old Sir Faithful Frugal's;--his spendthrift\nson sold the shell when he had eaten the kernel--and there is the end of\na city-fortune.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope yours will make a better termination, Master Heriot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nLord Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope it will, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old man, with a smile; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to use\nhonest John Bunyan's phrase--'therewithal the water stood in his eyes,'\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cit has pleased God to try me with the loss of two children; and for one\nadopted shild who lives--Ah! woe is me! and well-a-day!--But I am patient\nand thankful; and for the wealth God has sent me, it shall not want\ninheritors while there are orphan lads in Auld Reekie.--I wish you\ngood-morrow, my lord.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne orphan has cause to thank you already,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, as he attended\nhim to the door of his chamber, where, resisting further escort, the old\ncitizen made his escape.\n\nAs, in going downstairs, he passed the shop where Dame Christie stood\nbecking, he made civil inquiries after her husband. The dame of course\nregretted his absence; but he was down, she said, at Deptford, to settle\nwith a Dutch ship-master.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur way of business, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctakes him much from home, and my\nhusband must be the slave of every tarry jacket that wants but a pound\nof oakum.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll business must be minded, dame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the goldsmith. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMake my\nremembrances--George Heriot, of Lombard Street's remembrances--to your\ngoodman. I have dealt with him--he is just and punctual--true to time\nand engagements;--be kind to your noble guest, and see he wants nothing.\nThough it be his pleasure at present to lie private and retired, there\nbe those that care for him, and I have a charge to see him supplied; so\nthat you may let me know by your husband, my good dame, how my lord is,\nand whether he wants aught.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd so he _is_ a real lord after all?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the good dame. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sure I\nalways thought he looked like one. But why does he not go to Parliament,\nthen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe will, dame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto the Parliament of Scotland, which\nis his own country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! he is but a Scots lord, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the good dame; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand that's the\nthing makes him ashamed to take the title, as they say.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet him not hear _you_ say so, dame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the citizen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho, I, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered she; \u00e2\u0080\u009cno such matter in my thought, sir. Scot\nor English, he is at any rate a likely man, and a civil man; and rather\nthan he should want any thing, I would wait upon him myself, and come as\nfar as Lombard Street to wait upon your worship too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet your husband come to me, good dame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the goldsmith, who,\nwith all his experience and worth, was somewhat of a formalist and\ndisciplinarian. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe proverb says, 'House goes mad when women gad;' and\nlet his lordship's own man wait upon his master in his chamber--it is\nmore seemly. God give ye good-morrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-morrow to your worship,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the dame, somewhat coldly; and, so\nsoon as the adviser was out of hearing, was ungracious enough to mutter,\nin contempt of his council, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMarry quep of your advice, for an old\nScotch tinsmith, as you are! My husband is as wise, and very near as\nold, as yourself; and if I please him, it is well enough; and though he\nis not just so rich just now as some folks, yet I hope to see him ride\nupon his moyle, with a foot-cloth, and have his two blue-coats after\nhim, as well as they do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nWherefore come ye not to court? Certain 'tis the rarest sport; There\nare silks and jewels glistening, Prattling fools and wise men listening,\nBullies among brave men justling, Beggars amongst nobles bustling;\nLow-breath'd talkers, minion lispers, Cutting honest throats by\nwhispers; Wherefore come ye not to court? Skelton swears 'tis glorious\nsport. _Skelton Skeltonizeth._\n\nIt was not entirely out of parade that the benevolent citizen was\nmounted and attended in that manner, which, as the reader has been\ninformed, excited a gentle degree of spleen on the part of Dame\nChristie, which, to do her justice, vanished in the little soliloquy\nwhich we have recorded. The good man, besides the natural desire to\nmaintain the exterior of a man of worship, was at present bound to\nWhitehall in order to exhibit a piece of valuable workmanship to King\nJames, which he deemed his Majesty might be pleased to view, or even to\npurchase. He himself was therefore mounted upon his caparisoned mule,\nthat he might the better make his way through the narrow, dirty, and\ncrowded streets; and while one of his attendants carried under his arm\nthe piece of plate, wrapped up in red baize, the other two gave an\neye to its safety; for such was then the state of the police of the\nmetropolis, that men were often assaulted in the public street for the\nsake of revenge or of plunder; and those who apprehended being beset,\nusually endeavoured, if their estate admitted such expense, to secure\nthemselves by the attendance of armed followers. And this custom, which\nwas at first limited to the nobility and gentry, extended by degrees to\nthose citizens of consideration, who, being understood to travel with\na charge, as it was called, might otherwise have been selected as safe\nsubjects of plunder by the street-robber.\n\nAs Master George Heriot paced forth westward with this gallant\nattendance, he paused at the shop door of his countryman and friend, the\nancient horologer, and having caused Tunstall, who was in attendance, to\nadjust his watch by the real time, he desired to speak with his master;\nin consequence of which summons, the old Time-meter came forth from his\nden, his face like a bronze bust, darkened with dust, and glistening\nhere and there with copper filings, and his senses so bemused in the\nintensity of calculation, that he gazed on his friend the goldsmith for\na minute before he seemed perfectly to comprehend who he was, and\nheard him express his invitation to David Ramsay, and pretty Mistress\nMargaret, his daughter, to dine with him next day at noon, to meet with\na noble young countrymen, without returning any answer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll make thee speak, with a murrain to thee,\u00e2\u0080\u009d muttered Heriot to\nhimself; and suddenly changing his tone, he said aloud,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI pray you,\nneighbour David, when are you and I to have a settlement for the bullion\nwherewith I supplied you to mount yonder hall-clock at Theobald's, and\nthat other whirligig that you made for the Duke of Buckingham? I have\nhad the Spanish house to satisfy for the ingots, and I must needs put\nyou in mind that you have been eight months behind-hand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere is something so sharp and _aigre_ in the demand of a peremptory\ndun, that no human tympanum, however inaccessible to other tones, can\nresist the application. David Ramsay started at once from his reverie,\nand answered in a pettish tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWow, George, man, what needs aw this\ndin about sax score o' pounds? Aw the world kens I can answer aw claims\non me, and you proffered yourself fair time, till his maist gracious\nMajesty and the noble Duke suld make settled accompts wi' me; and ye\nmay ken, by your ain experience, that I canna gang rowting like an\nunmannered Highland stot to their doors, as ye come to mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHeriot laughed, and replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, David, I see a demand of money is\nlike a bucket of water about your ears, and makes you a man of the world\nat once. And now, friend, will you tell me, like a Christian man, if you\nwill dine with me to-morrow at noon, and bring pretty Mistress Margaret,\nmy god-daughter, with you, to meet with our noble young countryman, the\nLord of Glenvarloch?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe young Lord of Glenvarloch!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old mechanist; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwi' aw my\nheart, and blithe I will be to see him again. We have not met these\nforty years--he was twa years before me at the humanity classes--he is a\nsweet youth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was his father--his father--his father!--you old dotard\nDot-and-carry-one that you are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the goldsmith. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA sweet youth\nhe would have been by this time, had he lived, worthy nobleman! This is\nhis son, the Lord Nigel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis son!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ramsay; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaybe he will want something of a chronometer,\nor watch--few gallants care to be without them now-a-days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe may buy half your stock-in-trade, if ever he comes to his own, for\nwhat I know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his friend; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut, David, remember your bond, and\nuse me not as you did when my housewife had the sheep's-head and the\ncock-a-leeky boiling for you as late as two of the clock afternoon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe had the more credit by her cookery,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered David, now fully\nawake; \u00e2\u0080\u009ca sheep's-head over-boiled, were poison, according to our\nsaying.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Master George, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut as there will be no sheep's-head\nto-morrow, it may chance you to spoil a dinner which a proverb\ncannot mend. It may be you may forgather with your friend, Sir Mungo\nMalagrowther, for I purpose to ask his worship; so, be sure and bide\ntryste, Davie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat will I--I will be true as a chronometer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ramsay.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not trust you, though,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Heriot.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cHear you, Jenkin boy,\ntell Scots Janet to tell pretty Mistress Margaret, my god-child, she\nmust put her father in remembrance to put on his best doublet to-morrow,\nand to bring him to Lombard Street at noon. Tell her they are to meet a\nbrave young Scots lord.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJenkin coughed that sort of dry short cough uttered by those who are\neither charged with errands which they do not like, or hear opinions to\nwhich they must not enter a dissent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUmph!\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated Master George--who, as we have already noticed, was\nsomething of a martinet in domestic discipline--\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat does _umph_ mean?\nWill you do mine errand or not, sirrah?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSure, Master George Heriot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the apprentice, touching his cap,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI only meant, that Mistress Margaret was not likely to forget such an\ninvitation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Master George; \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe is a dutiful girl to her god-father,\nthough I sometimes call her a jill-flirt.--And, hark ye, Jenkin, you and\nyour comrade had best come with your clubs, to see your master and her\nsafely home; but first shut shop, and loose the bull-dog, and let the\nporter stay in the fore-shop till your return. I will send two of my\nknaves with you; for I hear these wild youngsters of the Temple are\nbroken out worse and lighter than ever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can keep their steel in order with good handbats,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand\nnever trouble your servants for the matter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOr, if need be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tunstall, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe have swords as well as the\nTemplars.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFie upon it--fie upon it, young man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the citizen;--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAn apprentice\nwith a sword!--Marry, heaven forefend! I would as soon see him in a hat\nand feather.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin--\u00e2\u0080\u009cwe will find arms fitting to our station, and\nwill defend our master and his daughter, if we should tear up the very\nstones of the pavement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere spoke a London 'prentice bold,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the citizen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand, for your\ncomfort, my lads, you shall crush a cup of wine to the health of the\nFathers of the City. I have my eye on both of you--you are thriving\nlads, each in his own way.--God be wi' you, Davie. Forget not to-morrow\nat noon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And, so saying, he again turned his mule's head westward, and\ncrossed Temple Bar, at that slow and decent amble, which at once became\nhis rank and civic importance, and put his pedestrian followers to no\ninconvenience to keep up with him.\n\nAt the Temple gate he again paused, dismounted, and sought his way into\none of the small booths occupied by scriveners in the neighbourhood. A\nyoung man, with lank smooth hair combed straight to his ears, and then\ncropped short, rose, with a cringing reverence, pulled off a slouched\nhat, which he would upon no signal replace on his head, and answered\nwith much demonstration of reverence, to the goldsmith's question of,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow goes business, Andrew?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAw the better for your worship's kind\ncountenance and maintenance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGet a large sheet of paper, man, and make a new pen, with a sharp neb,\nand fine hair-stroke. Do not slit the quill up too high, it's a wastrife\ncourse in your trade, Andrew--they that do not mind corn-pickles, never\ncome to forpits. I have known a learned man write a thousand pages with\none quill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Footnote: A biblical commentary by Gill, which (if the\nauthor's memory serves him) occupies between five and six hundred\nprinted quarto pages, and must therefore have filled more pages of\nmanuscript than the number mentioned in the text, has this quatrain at\nthe end of the volume--\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith one good pen I wrote this book,\n       Made of a grey goose quill;\n     A pen it was when it I took,\n       And a pen I leave it still.\u00e2\u0080\u009d]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lad, who listened to the goldsmith, though\ninstructing him in his own trade, with an air of veneration and\nacquiescence, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow sune ony puir creature like mysell may rise in the\nworld, wi' the instruction of such a man as your worship!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy instructions are few, Andrew, soon told, and not hard to practise.\nBe honest--be industrious--be frugal--and you will soon win wealth and\nworship.--Here, copy me this Supplication in your best and most formal\nhand. I will wait by you till it is done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe youth lifted not his eye from the paper, and laid not the pen from\nhis hand, until the task was finished to his employer's satisfaction.\nThe citizen then gave the young scrivener an angel; and bidding him, on\nhis life, be secret in all business intrusted to him, again mounted his\nmule, and rode on westward along the Strand.\n\nIt may be worth while to remind our readers, that the Temple Bar which\nHeriot passed, was not the arched screen, or gateway, of the present\nday; but an open railing, or palisade, which, at night, and in times of\nalarm, was closed with a barricade of posts and chains. The Strand also,\nalong which he rode, was not, as now, a continued street, although\nit was beginning already to assume that character. It still might be\nconsidered as an open road, along the south side of which stood various\nhouses and hotels belonging to the nobility, having gardens behind them\ndown to the water-side, with stairs to the river, for the convenience\nof taking boat; which mansions have bequeathed the names of their lordly\nowners to many of the streets leading from the Strand to the Thames. The\nnorth side of the Strand was also a long line of houses, behind which,\nas in Saint Martin's Lane, and other points, buildings, were rapidly\narising; but Covent Garden was still a garden, in the literal sense\nof the word, or at least but beginning to be studded with irregular\nbuildings. All that was passing around, however, marked the rapid\nincrease of a capital which had long enjoyed peace, wealth, and a\nregular government. Houses were rising in every direction; and the\nshrewd eye of our citizen already saw the period not distant, which\nshould convert the nearly open highway on which he travelled, into a\nconnected and regular street, uniting the Court and the town with the\ncity of London.\n\nHe next passed Charing Cross, which was no longer the pleasant solitary\nvillage at which the judges were wont to breakfast on their way to\nWestminster Hall, but began to resemble the artery through which, to\nuse Johnson's expression \u00e2\u0080\u009cpours the full tide of London population.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The\nbuildings were rapidly increasing, yet certainly gave not even a faint\nidea of its present appearance.\n\nAt last Whitehall received our traveller, who passed under one of\nthe beautiful gates designed by Holbein, and composed of tesselated\nbrick-work, being the same to which Moniplies had profanely likened the\nWest-Port of Edinburgh, and entered the ample precincts of the palace of\nWhitehall, now full of all the confusion attending improvement. It was\njust at the time when James,--little suspecting that he was employed in\nconstructing a palace, from the window of which his only son was to pass\nin order that he might die upon a scaffold before it,--was busied in\nremoving the ancient and ruinous buildings of De Burgh, Henry VIII., and\nQueen Elizabeth, to make way for the superb architecture on which Inigo\nJones exerted all his genius. The king, ignorant of futurity, was now\nengaged in pressing on his work; and, for that purpose, still maintained\nhis royal apartments at Whitehall, amidst the rubbish of old buildings,\nand the various confusion attending the erection of the new pile, which\nformed at present a labyrinth not easily traversed.\n\nThe goldsmith to the Royal Household, and who, if fame spoke true,\noftentimes acted as their banker,--for these professions were not as\nyet separated from each other,--was a person of too much importance to\nreceive the slightest interruption from sentinel or porter; and, leaving\nhis mule and two of his followers in the outer-court, he gently knocked\nat a postern-gate of the building, and was presently admitted, while the\nmost trusty of his attendants followed him closely, with the piece\nof plate under his arm. This man also he left behind him in an\nante-room,--where three or four pages in the royal livery, but\nuntrussed, unbuttoned, and dressed more carelessly than the place, and\nnearness to a king's person, seemed to admit, were playing at dice and\ndraughts, or stretched upon benches, and slumbering with half-shut eyes.\nA corresponding gallery, which opened from the ante-room, was occupied\nby two gentlemen-ushers of the chamber, who gave each a smile of\nrecognition as the wealthy goldsmith entered.\n\nNo word was spoken on either side; but one of the ushers looked first\nto Heriot, and then to a little door half-covered by the tapestry, which\nseemed to say, as plain as a look could, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLies your business that way?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n The citizen nodded; and the court-attendant, moving on tiptoe, and with\nas much caution as if the floor had been paved with eggs, advanced to\nthe door, opened it gently, and spoke a few words in a low tone. The\nbroad Scottish accent of King James was heard in reply,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAdmit him\ninstanter, Maxwell. Have you hairboured sae lang at the Court, and not\nlearned, that gold and silver are ever welcome?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe usher signed to Heriot to advance, and the honest citizen was\npresently introduced into the cabinet of the Sovereign.\n\nThe scene of confusion amid which he found the king seated, was no bad\npicture of the state and quality of James's own mind. There was much\nthat was rich and costly in cabinet pictures and valuable ornaments;\nbut they were arranged in a slovenly manner, covered with dust, and lost\nhalf their value, or at least their effect, from the manner in which\nthey were presented to the eye. The table was loaded with huge folios,\namongst which lay light books of jest and ribaldry; and, amongst notes\nof unmercifully long orations, and essays on king-craft, were mingled\nmiserable roundels and ballads by the Royal 'Prentice, as he styled\nhimself, in the art of poetry, and schemes for the general pacification\nof Europe, with a list of the names of the king's hounds, and remedies\nagainst canine madness.\n\nThe king's dress was of green velvet, quilted so full as to be\ndagger-proof--which gave him the appearance of clumsy and ungainly\nprotuberance; while its being buttoned awry, communicated to his figure\nan air of distortion. Over his green doublet he wore a sad-coloured\nnightgown, out of the pocket of which peeped his hunting-horn. His\nhigh-crowned grey hat lay on the floor, covered with dust, but encircled\nby a carcanet of large balas rubies; and he wore a blue velvet nightcap,\nin the front of which was placed the plume of a heron, which had been\nstruck down by a favourite hawk in some critical moment of the flight,\nin remembrance of which the king wore this highly honoured feather.\n\nBut such inconsistencies in dress and appointments were mere outward\ntypes of those which existed in the royal character, rendering it a\nsubject of doubt amongst his contemporaries, and bequeathing it as a\nproblem to future historians. He was deeply learned, without possessing\nuseful knowledge; sagacious in many individual cases, without having\nreal wisdom; fond of his power, and desirous to maintain and augment it,\nyet willing to resign the direction of that, and of himself, to the most\nunworthy favourites; a big and bold asserter of his rights in words, yet\none who tamely saw them trampled on in deeds; a lover of negotiations,\nin which he was always outwitted; and one who feared war, where\nconquest might have been easy. He was fond of his dignity, while he was\nperpetually degrading it by undue familiarity; capable of much public\nlabour, yet often neglecting it for the meanest amusement; a wit, though\na pedant; and a scholar, though fond of the conversation of the ignorant\nand uneducated. Even his timidity of temper was not uniform; and there\nwere moments of his life, and those critical, in which he showed the\nspirit of his ancestors. He was laborious in trifles, and a trifler\nwhere serious labour was required; devout in his sentiments, and yet\ntoo often profane in his language; just and beneficent by nature, he yet\ngave way to the iniquities and oppression of others. He was penurious\nrespecting money which he had to give from his own hand, yet\ninconsiderately and unboundedly profuse of that which he did not see.\nIn a word, those good qualities which displayed themselves in particular\ncases and occasions, were not of a nature sufficiently firm and\ncomprehensive to regulate his general conduct; and, showing themselves\nas they occasionally did, only entitled James to the character bestowed\non him by Sully--that he was the wisest fool in Christendom.\n\nThat the fortunes of this monarch might be as little of apiece as his\ncharacter, he, certainly the least able of the Stewarts, succeeded\npeaceably to that kingdom, against the power of which his predecessors\nhad, with so much difficulty, defended his native throne; and, lastly,\nalthough his reign appeared calculated to ensure to Great Britain that\nlasting tranquillity and internal peace which so much suited the king's\ndisposition, yet, during that very reign, were sown those seeds of\ndissension, which, like the teeth of the fabulous dragon, had their\nharvest in a bloody and universal civil war.\n\nSuch was the monarch, who, saluting Heriot by the name of Jingling\nGeordie, (for it was his well-known custom to give nicknames to all\nthose with whom he was on terms of familiarity,) inquired what new\nclatter-traps he had brought with him, to cheat his lawful and native\nPrince out of his siller.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod forbid, my liege,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the citizen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I should have any such\ndisloyal purpose. I did but bring a piece of plate to show to your most\ngracious Majesty, which, both for the subject and for the workmanship,\nI were loath to put into the hands of any subject until I knew your\nMajesty's pleasure anent it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBody o' me, man, let's see it, Heriot; though, by my saul, Steenie's\nservice o' plate was sae dear a bargain, I had 'maist pawned my word\nas a Royal King, to keep my ain gold and silver in future, and let you,\nGeordie, keep yours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRespecting the Duke of Buckingham's plate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the goldsmith, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour\nMajesty was pleased to direct that no expense should be spared, and--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat signifies what I desired, man? when a wise man is with fules and\nbairns, he maun e'en play at the chucks. But you should have had mair\nsense and consideration than to gie Babie Charles and Steenie their ain\ngate; they wad hae floored the very rooms wi' silver, and I wonder they\ndidna.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGeorge Heriot bowed, and said no more. He knew his master too well to\nvindicate himself otherwise than by a distant allusion to his order; and\nJames, with whom economy was only a transient and momentary twinge of\nconscience, became immediately afterwards desirous to see the piece of\nplate which the goldsmith proposed to exhibit, and dispatched Maxwell\nto bring it to his presence. In the meantime he demanded of the citizen\nwhence he had procured it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom Italy, may it please your Majesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Heriot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt has naething in it tending to papistrie?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, looking\ngraver than his wont.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSurely not, please your Majesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI were not wise to\nbring any thing to your presence that had the mark of the beast.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou would be the mair beast yourself to do so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is\nweel kend that I wrestled wi' Dagon in my youth, and smote him on the\ngroundsill of his own temple; a gude evidence that I should be in time\ncalled, however unworthy, the Defender of the Faith.--But here comes\nMaxwell, bending under his burden, like the Golden Ass of Apuleius.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHeriot hastened to relieve the usher, and to place the embossed salver,\nfor such it was, and of extraordinary dimensions, in a light favourable\nfor his Majesty's viewing the sculpture.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSaul of my body, man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is a curious piece, and, as\nI think, fit for a king's chalmer; and the subject, as you say, Master\nGeorge, vera adequate and beseeming--being, as I see, the judgment of\nSolomon--a prince in whose paths it weel becomes a' leeving monarchs to\nwalk with emulation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut whose footsteps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Maxwell, \u00e2\u0080\u009conly one of them--if a subject may\nsay so much--hath ever overtaken.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaud your tongue for a fause fleeching loon!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, but with\na smile on his face that showed the flattery had done its part. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook\nat the bonny piece of workmanship, and haud your clavering tongue.--And\nwhase handiwork may it be, Geordie?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was wrought, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the goldsmith, \u00e2\u0080\u009cby the famous Florentine,\nBenvenuto Cellini, and designed for Francis the First of France; but I\nhope it will find a fitter master.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrancis of France!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009csend Solomon, King of the Jews, to\nFrancis of France!--Body of me, man, it would have kythed Cellini mad,\nhad he never done ony thing else out of the gate. Francis!--why, he\nwas a fighting fule, man,--a mere fighting fule,--got himsell ta'en at\nPavia, like our ain David at Durham lang syne;--if they could hae sent\nhim Solomon's wit, and love of peace, and godliness, they wad hae dune\nhim a better turn. But Solomon should sit in other gate company than\nFrancis of France.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI trust that such will be his good fortune,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a curious and very artificial sculpture,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, in\ncontinuation; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut yet, methinks, the carnifex, or executioner there,\nis brandishing his gully ower near the king's face, seeing he is within\nreach of his weapon. I think less wisdom than Solomon's wad have taught\nhim that there was danger in edge-tools, and that he wad have bidden the\nsmaik either sheath his shabble, or stand farther back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGeorge Heriot endeavoured to alleviate this objection, by assuring the\nking that the vicinity betwixt Solomon and the executioner was nearer in\nappearance than in reality, and that the perspective should be allowed\nfor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGang to the deil wi' your prospective, man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\ncanna be a waur prospective for a lawful king, wha wishes to reign in\nluve, and die in peace and honour, than to have naked swords flashing in\nhis een. I am accounted as brave as maist folks; and yet I profess to\nye I could never look on a bare blade without blinking and winking. But\na'thegither it is a brave piece;--and what is the price of it, man?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe goldsmith replied by observing, that it was not his own property,\nbut that of a distressed countryman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhilk you mean to mak your excuse for asking the double of its worth,\nI warrant?\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the king. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI ken the tricks of you burrows-town\nmerchants, man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no hopes of baffling your Majesty's sagacity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe\npiece is really what I say, and the price a hundred and fifty pounds\nsterling, if it pleases your Majesty to make present payment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA hundred and fifty punds, man! and as mony witches and warlocks to\nraise them!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the irritated Monarch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy saul, Jingling Geordie, ye\nare minded that your purse shall jingle to a bonny tune!--How am I to\ntell you down a hundred and fifty punds for what will not weigh as many\nmerks? and ye ken that my very household servitors, and the officers of\nmy mouth, are sax months in arrear!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe goldsmith stood his ground against all this objurgation, being what\nhe was well accustomed to, and only answered, that, if his Majesty liked\nthe piece, and desired to possess it, the price could be easily settled.\nIt was true that the party required the money, but he, George Heriot,\nwould advance it on his Majesty's account, if such were his pleasure,\nand wait his royal conveniency for payment, for that and other matters;\nthe money, meanwhile, lying at the ordinary usage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my honour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said James, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand that is speaking like an honest and\nreasonable tradesman. We maun get another subsidy frae the Commons, and\nthat will make ae compting of it. Awa wi' it, Maxwell--awa wi' it,\nand let it be set where Steenie and Babie Charles shall see it as they\nreturn from Richmond.--And now that we are secret, my good auld friend\nGeordie, I do truly opine, that speaking of Solomon and ourselves, the\nhaill wisdom in the country left Scotland, when we took our travels to\nthe Southland here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGeorge Heriot was courtier enough to say, that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe wise naturally\nfollow the wisest, as stags follow their leader.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTroth, I think there is something in what thou sayest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said James;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cfor we ourselves, and those of our Court and household, as thou\nthyself, for example, are allowed by the English, for as self-opinioned\nas they are, to pass for reasonable good wits; but the brains of those\nwe have left behind are all astir, and run clean hirdie-girdie, like sae\nmony warlocks and witches on the Devil's Sabbath e'en.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sorry to hear this, my liege,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMay it please your\nGrace to say what our countrymen have done to deserve such a character?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are become frantic, man--clean brain-crazed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the king.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot keep them out of the Court by all the proclamations that the\nheralds roar themselves hoarse with. Yesterday, nae farther gane,\njust as we were mounted, and about to ride forth, in rushed a thorough\nEdinburgh gutterblood--a ragged rascal, every dud upon whose back was\nbidding good-day to the other, with a coat and hat that would have\nserved a pease-bogle, and without havings or reverence, thrusts into our\nhands, like a sturdy beggar, some Supplication about debts owing by our\ngracious mother, and siclike trash; whereat the horse spangs on end,\nand, but for our admirable sitting, wherein we have been thought to\nexcel maist sovereign princes, as well as subjects, in Europe, I promise\nyou we would have been laid endlang on the causeway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Majesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis their common father, and therefore they\nare the bolder to press into your gracious presence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI ken I am _pater patriae_ well enough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said James; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut one would\nthink they had a mind to squeeze my puddings out, that they may divide\nthe inheritance, Ud's death, Geordie, there is not a loon among them can\ndeliver a Supplication, as it suld be done in the face of majesty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would I knew the most fitting and beseeming mode to do so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwere it but to instruct our poor countrymen in better\nfashions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my halidome,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, \u00e2\u0080\u009cye are a ceevileezed fellow, Geordie,\nand I carena if I fling awa as much time as may teach ye. And, first,\nsee you, sir--ye shall approach the presence of majesty thus,--shadowing\nyour eyes with your hand, to testify that you are in the presence of\nthe Vice-gerent of Heaven.--Vera weel, George, that is done in a comely\nmanner.--Then, sir, ye sail kneel, and make as if ye would kiss the\nhem of our garment, the latch of our shoe, or such like.--Very weel\nenacted--whilk we, as being willing to be debonair and pleasing towards\nour lieges, prevent thus,--and motion to you to rise;--whilk, having\na boon to ask, as yet you obey not, but, gliding your hand into your\npouch, bring forth your Supplication, and place it reverentially in our\nopen palm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The goldsmith, who had complied with great accuracy with all\nthe prescribed points of the ceremonial, here completed it, to James's\nno small astonishment, by placing in his hand the petition of the Lord\nof Glenvarloch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat means this, ye fause loon?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, reddening and\nsputtering; \u00e2\u0080\u009chae I been teaching you the manual exercise, that ye suld\npresent your piece at our ain royal body?--Now, by this light, I had as\nlief that ye had bended a real pistolet against me, and yet this hae\nye done in my very cabinet, where nought suld enter but at my ain\npleasure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI trust your Majesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot, as he continued to kneel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill\nforgive my exercising the lesson you condescended to give me in the\nbehalf of a friend?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf a friend!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cso much the waur--so much the waur, I\ntell you. If it had been something to do _yoursell_ good there would\nhave been some sense in it, and some chance that you wad not have\ncome back on me in a hurry; but a man may have a hundred friends, and\npetitions for every ane of them, ilk ane after other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Majesty, I trust,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill judge me by former\nexperience, and will not suspect me of such presumption.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI kenna,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the placable monarch; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe world goes daft, I\nthink--_sed semel insanivimus omnes_--thou art my old and faithful\nservant, that is the truth; and, were't any thing for thy own behoof,\nman, thou shouldst not ask twice. But, troth, Steenie loves me so\ndearly, that he cares not that any one should ask favours of me but\nhimself.--Maxwell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d (for the usher had re-entered after having carried\noff the plate,) \u00e2\u0080\u009cget into the ante-chamber wi' your lang lugs.--In\nconscience, Geordie, I think as that thou hast been mine ain auld\nfiduciary, and wert my goldsmith when I might say with the Ethnic\npoet--_Non mea renidet in domo lacunar_--for, faith, they had pillaged\nmy mither's auld house sae, that beechen bickers, and treen trenchers,\nand latten platters, were whiles the best at our board, and glad we were\nof something to put on them, without quarrelling with the metal of the\ndishes. D'ye mind, for thou wert in maist of our complots, how we were\nfain to send sax of the Blue-banders to harry the Lady of Loganhouse's\ndowcot and poultry-yard, and what an awfu' plaint the poor dame made\nagainst Jock of Milch, and the thieves of Annandale, wha were as\nsackless of the deed as I am of the sin of murder?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was the better for Jock,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor, if I remember weel, it\nsaved him from a strapping up at Dumfries, which he had weel deserved\nfor other misdeeds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, man, mind ye that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut he had other virtues, for\nhe was a tight huntsman, moreover, that Jock of Milch, and could hollow\nto a hound till all the woods rang again. But he came to an Annandale\nend at the last, for Lord Torthorwald run his lance out through\nhim.--Cocksnails, man, when I think of those wild passages, in my\nconscience, I am not sure but we lived merrier in auld Holyrood in\nthose shifting days, than now when we are dwelling at heck and manger.\n_Cantabit vacuus_--we had but little to care for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if your Majesty please to remember,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the goldsmith, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe awful\ntask we had to gather silver-vessail and gold-work enough to make some\nshow before the Spanish Ambassador.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVera true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, now in a full tide of gossip, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I mind\nnot the name of the right leal lord that helped us with every unce he\nhad in his house, that his native Prince might have some credit in the\neyes of them that had the Indies at their beck.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think, if your Majesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the citizen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill cast your eye on the\npaper in your hand, you will recollect his name.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, \u00e2\u0080\u009csay ye sae, man?--Lord Glenvarloch, that was his\nname indeed--_Justus et tenax propositi_--A just man, but as obstinate\nas a baited bull. He stood whiles against us, that Lord Randal Olifaunt\nof Glenvarloch, but he was a loving and a leal subject in the main. But\nthis supplicator maun be his son--Randal has been long gone where king\nand lord must go, Geordie, as weel as the like of you--and what does his\nson want with us?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe settlement,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the citizen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cof a large debt due by your\nMajesty's treasury, for money advanced to your Majesty in great State\nemergency, about the time of the Raid of Ruthven.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI mind the thing weel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said King James--\u00e2\u0080\u009cOd's death, man, I was just\nout of the clutches of the Master of Glamis and his complices, and there\nwas never siller mair welcome to a born prince,--the mair the shame and\npity that crowned king should need sic a petty sum. But what need he dun\nus for it, man, like a baxter at the breaking? We aught him the siller,\nand will pay him wi' our convenience, or make it otherwise up to him,\nwhilk is enow between prince and subject--We are not _in meditatione\nfugae,_ man, to be arrested thus peremptorily.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas! an it please your Majesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the goldsmith, shaking his head,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cit is the poor young nobleman's extreme necessity, and not his will,\nthat makes him importunate; for he must have money, and that briefly,\nto discharge a debt due to Peregrine Peterson, Conservator of the\nPrivileges at Campvere, or his haill hereditary barony and estate of\nGlenvarloch will be evicted in virtue of an unredeemed wadset.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow say ye, man--how say ye?\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the king, impatiently; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe\ncarle of a Conservator, the son of a Low-Dutch skipper, evict the auld\nestate and lordship of the house of Olifaunt?--God's bread, man,\nthat maun not be--we maun suspend the diligence by writ of favour, or\notherwise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI doubt that may hardly be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the citizen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif it please your\nMajesty; your learned counsel in the law of Scotland advise, that there\nis no remeid but in paying the money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUd's fish,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet him keep haud by the strong hand\nagainst the carle, until we can take some order about his affairs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas!\u00e2\u0080\u009d insisted the goldsmith, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif it like your Majesty, your own\npacific government, and your doing of equal justice to all men, has made\nmain force a kittle line to walk by, unless just within the bounds of\nthe Highlands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell--weel--weel, man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the perplexed monarch, whose ideas of\njustice, expedience, and convenience, became on such occasions strangely\nembroiled; \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust it is we should pay our debts, that the young man may\npay his; and he must be paid, and _in verbo regis_ he shall be paid--but\nhow to come by the siller, man, is a difficult chapter--ye maun try the\ncity, Geordie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo say the truth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cplease your gracious Majesty,\nwhat betwixt loans and benevolences, and subsidies, the city is at this\npresent----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDonna tell me of what the city is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said King James; \u00e2\u0080\u009cour Exchequer is\nas dry as Dean Giles's discourses on the penitentiary psalms--_Ex nihilo\nnihil fit_--It's ill taking the breeks aff a wild Highlandman--they that\ncome to me for siller, should tell me how to come by it--the city ye\nmaun try, Heriot; and donna think to be called Jingling Geordie for\nnothing--and _in verbo regis_ I will pay the lad if you get me the\nloan--I wonnot haggle on the terms; and, between you and me, Geordie, we\nwill redeem the brave auld estate of Glenvarloch.--But wherefore comes\nnot the young lord to Court, Heriot--is he comely--is he presentable in\nthe presence?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo one can be more so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, I understand ye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his Majesty--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand ye--_Res angusta\ndomi_--puir lad-puir lad!--and his father a right true leal Scots heart,\nthough stiff in some opinions. Hark ye, Heriot, let the lad have twa\nhundred pounds to fit him out. And, here--here\u00e2\u0080\u009d--(taking the carcanet\nof rubies from his old hat)--\u00e2\u0080\u009cye have had these in pledge before for a\nlarger sum, ye auld Levite that ye are. Keep them in gage, till I gie ye\nback the siller out of the next subsidy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it please your Majesty to give me such directions in writing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nthe cautious citizen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe deil is in your nicety, George,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cye are as preceese\nas a Puritan in form, and a mere Nullifidian in the marrow of the\nmatter. May not a king's word serve ye for advancing your pitiful twa\nhundred pounds?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut not for detaining the crown jewels,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George Heriot.\n\nAnd the king, who from long experience was inured to dealing\nwith suspicious creditors, wrote an order upon George Heriot, his\nwell-beloved goldsmith and jeweller, for the sum of two hundred pounds,\nto be paid presently to Nigel Olifaunt, Lord of Glenvarloch, to be\nimputed as so much debts due to him by the crown; and authorizing\nthe retention of a carcanet of balas rubies, with a great diamond,\nas described in a Catalogue of his Majesty's Jewels, to remain in\npossession of the said George Heriot, advancer of the said sum, and\nso forth, until he was lawfully contented and paid thereof. By another\nrescript, his Majesty gave the said George Heriot directions to deal\nwith some of the monied men, upon equitable terms, for a sum of money\nfor his Majesty's present use, not to be under 50,000 merks, but as much\nmore as could conveniently be procured.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd has he ony lair, this Lord Nigel of ours?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king.\n\nGeorge Heriot could not exactly answer this question; but believed \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe\nyoung lord had studied abroad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe shall have our own advice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow to carry on his\nstudies to maist advantage; and it may be we will have him come to\nCourt, and study with Steenie and Babie Charles. And, now we think on't,\naway--away, George--for the bairns will be coming hame presently, and we\nwould not as yet they kend of this matter we have been treating anent.\n_Propera fedem,_ O Geordie. Clap your mule between your boughs, and\ngod-den with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThus ended the conference betwixt the gentle King Jamie and his\nbenevolent jeweller and goldsmith.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\n  O I do know him--tis the mouldy lemon\n  Which our court wits will wet their lips withal,\n  When they would sauce their honied conversation\n  With somewhat sharper flavour--Marry sir,\n  That virtue's wellnigh left him--all the juice\n  That was so sharp and poignant, is squeezed out,\n  While the poor rind, although as sour as ever,\n  Must season soon the draff we give our grunters,\n  For two legg'd things are weary on't.\n                     _The Chamberlain--A Comedy_\n\nThe good company invited by the hospitable citizen assembled at his\nhouse in Lombard Street at the \u00e2\u0080\u009chollow and hungry hour\u00e2\u0080\u009d of noon, to\npartake of that meal which divides the day, being about the time when\nmodern persons of fashion, turning themselves upon their pillow, begin\nto think, not without a great many doubts and much hesitation, that\nthey will by and by commence it. Thither came the young Nigel, arrayed\nplainly, but in a dress, nevertheless, more suitable to his age and\nquality than he had formerly worn, accompanied by his servant Moniplies,\nwhose outside also was considerably improved. His solemn and stern\nfeatures glared forth from under a blue velvet bonnet, fantastically\nplaced sideways on his head--he had a sound and tough coat of English\nblue broad-cloth, which, unlike his former vestment, would have\nstood the tug of all the apprentices in Fleet Street. The buckler and\nbroadsword he wore as the arms of his condition, and a neat silver\nbadge, bearing his lord's arms, announced that he was an appendage of\naristocracy. He sat down in the good citizen's buttery, not a little\npleased to find his attendance upon the table in the hall was likely to\nbe rewarded with his share of a meal such as he had seldom partaken of.\n\nMr. David Ramsay, that profound and ingenious mechanic, was safely\nconducted to Lombard Street, according to promise, well washed, brushed,\nand cleaned, from the soot of the furnace and the forge. His daughter,\nwho came with him, was about twenty years old, very pretty, very\ndemure, yet with lively black eyes, that ever and anon contradicted the\nexpression of sobriety, to which silence, reserve, a plain velvet hood,\nand a cambric ruff, had condemned Mistress Marget, as the daughter of a\nquiet citizen.\n\nThere were also two citizens and merchants of London, men ample in\ncloak, and many-linked golden chain, well to pass in the world, and\nexperienced in their craft of merchandise, but who require no particular\ndescription. There was an elderly clergyman also, in his gown and\ncassock, a decent venerable man, partaking in his manners of the\nplainness of the citizens amongst whom he had his cure.\n\nThese may be dismissed with brief notice; but not so Sir Mungo\nMalagrowther, of Girnigo Castle, who claims a little more attention, as\nan original character of the time in which he flourished.\n\nThat good knight knocked at Master Heriot's door just as the clock began\nto strike twelve, and was seated in his chair ere the last stroke\nhad chimed. This gave the knight an excellent opportunity of making\nsarcastic observations on all who came later than himself, not to\nmention a few rubs at the expense of those who had been so superfluous\nas to appear earlier.\n\nHaving little or no property save his bare designation, Sir Mungo had\nbeen early attached to Court in the capacity of whipping-boy, as the\noffice was then called, to King James the Sixth, and, with his Majesty,\ntrained to all polite learning by his celebrated preceptor, George\nBuchanan. The office of whipping-boy doomed its unfortunate occupant to\nundergo all the corporeal punishment which the Lord's Anointed, whose\nproper person was of course sacred, might chance to incur, in the course\nof travelling through his grammar and prosody. Under the stern rule,\nindeed, of George Buchanan, who did not approve of the vicarious mode\nof punishment, James bore the penance of his own faults, and Mungo\nMalagrowther enjoyed a sinecure; but James's other pedagogue, Master\nPatrick Young, went more ceremoniously to work, and appalled the very\nsoul of the youthful king by the floggings which he bestowed on the\nwhipping-boy, when the royal task was not suitably performed. And be\nit told to Sir Mungo's praise, that there were points about him in the\nhighest respect suited to his official situation. He had even in youth a\nnaturally irregular and grotesque set of features, which, when distorted\nby fear, pain, and anger, looked like one of the whimsical faces which\npresent themselves in a Gothic cornice. His voice also was high-pitched\nand querulous, so that, when smarting under Master Peter Young's\nunsparing inflictions, the expression of his grotesque physiognomy, and\nthe superhuman yells which he uttered, were well suited to produce all\nthe effects on the Monarch who deserved the lash, that could possibly be\nproduced by seeing another and an innocent individual suffering for his\ndelict.\n\nSir Mungo Malagrowther, for such he became, thus got an early footing\nat Court, which another would have improved and maintained. But, when he\ngrew too big to be whipped, he had no other means of rendering himself\nacceptable. A bitter, caustic, and backbiting humour, a malicious wit,\nand an envy of others more prosperous than the possessor of such amiable\nqualities, have not, indeed, always been found obstacles to a courtier's\nrise; but then they must be amalgamated with a degree of selfish cunning\nand prudence, of which Sir Mungo had no share. His satire ran riot, his\nenvy could not conceal itself, and it was not long after his majority\ntill he had as many quarrels upon his hands as would have required a\ncat's nine lives to answer. In one of these rencontres he received,\nperhaps we should say fortunately, a wound, which served him as an\nexcuse for answering no invitations of the kind in future. Sir Rullion\nRattray, of Ranagullion, cut off, in mortal combat, three of the fingers\nof his right hand, so that Sir Mungo never could hold sword again. At\na later period, having written some satirical verses upon the Lady\nCockpen, he received so severe a chastisement from some persons employed\nfor the purpose, that he was found half dead on the spot where they had\nthus dealt with him, and one of his thighs having been broken, and ill\nset, gave him a hitch in his gait, with which he hobbled to his grave.\nThe lameness of his leg and hand, besides that they added considerably\nto the grotesque appearance of this original, procured him in future\na personal immunity from the more dangerous consequences of his own\nhumour; and he gradually grew old in the service of the Court, in safety\nof life and limb, though without either making friends or attaining\npreferment. Sometimes, indeed, the king was amused with his caustic\nsallies, but he had never art enough to improve the favourable\nopportunity; and his enemies (who were, for that matter, the whole\nCourt) always found means to throw him out of favour again. The\ncelebrated Archie Armstrong offered Sir Mungo, in his generosity, a\nskirt of his own fool's coat, proposing thereby to communicate to him\nthe privileges and immunities of a professed jester--\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the man\nof motley, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir Mungo, as he goes on just now, gets no more for a good\njest than just the king's pardon for having made it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEven in London, the golden shower which fell around him did not moisten\nthe blighted fortunes of Sir Mungo Malagrowther. He grew old, deaf,\nand peevish--lost even the spirit which had formerly animated his\nstrictures--and was barely endured by James, who, though himself nearly\nas far stricken in years, retained, to an unusual and even an absurd\ndegree, the desire to be surrounded by young people.\n\nSir Mungo, thus fallen into the yellow leaf of years and fortune, showed\nhis emaciated form and faded embroidery at Court as seldom as his duty\npermitted; and spent his time in indulging his food for satire in the\npublic walks, and in the aisles of Saint Paul's, which were then the\ngeneral resort of newsmongers and characters of all descriptions,\nassociating himself chiefly with such of his countrymen as he accounted\nof inferior birth and rank to himself. In this manner, hating and\ncontemning commerce, and those who pursued it, he nevertheless lived a\ngood deal among the Scottish artists and merchants, who had followed\nthe Court to London. To these he could show his cynicism without much\noffence; for some submitted to his jeers and ill-humour in deference\nto his birth and knighthood, which in those days conferred high\nprivileges--and others, of more sense, pitied and endured the old man,\nunhappy alike in his fortunes and his temper.\n\nAmongst the latter was George Heriot, who, though his habits and\neducation induced him to carry aristocratical feelings to a degree which\nwould now be thought extravagant, had too much spirit and good sense to\npermit himself to be intruded upon to an unauthorized excess, or used\nwith the slightest improper freedom, by such a person as Sir Mungo, to\nwhom he was, nevertheless, not only respectfully civil, but essentially\nkind, and even generous.\n\nAccordingly, this appeared from the manner in which Sir Mungo\nMalagrowther conducted himself upon entering the apartment. He paid\nhis respects to Master Heriot, and a decent, elderly, somewhat\nsevere-looking female, in a coif, who, by the name of Aunt Judith, did\nthe honours of his house and table, with little or no portion of the\nsupercilious acidity, which his singular physiognomy assumed when he\nmade his bow successively to David Ramsay and the two sober citizens.\nHe thrust himself into the conversation of the latter, to observe he\nhad heard in Paul's, that the bankrupt concern of Pindivide, a great\nmerchant,--who, as he expressed it, had given the crows a pudding, and\non whom he knew, from the same authority, each of the honest citizens\nhas some unsettled claim,--was like to prove a total loss--\u00e2\u0080\u009cstock and\nblock, ship and cargo, keel and rigging, all lost, now and for ever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe two citizens grinned at each other; but, too prudent to make their\nprivate affairs the subject of public discussion, drew their heads\ntogether, and evaded farther conversation by speaking in a whisper.\n\nThe old Scots knight next attacked the watchmaker with the same\ndisrespectful familiarity.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cDavie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cDavie, ye donnard auld\nidiot, have ye no gane mad yet, with applying your mathematical science,\nas ye call it, to the book of Apocalypse? I expected to have heard ye\nmake out the sign of the beast, as clear as a tout on a bawbee whistle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Sir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the mechanist, after making an effort to recall\nto his recollection what had been said to him, and by whom, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit may be,\nthat ye are nearer the mark than ye are yoursell aware of; for, taking\nthe ten horns o' the beast, ye may easily estimate by your digitals--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy digits! you d--d auld, rusty, good-for-nothing time-piece!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n exclaimed Sir Mungo, while, betwixt jest and earnest, he laid on his\nhilt his hand, or rather his claw, (for Sir Rullion's broadsword\nhas abridged it into that form,)--\u00e2\u0080\u009cD'ye mean to upbraid me with my\nmutilation?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMaster Heriot interfered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot persuade our friend David,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat scriptural prophecies are intended to remain in obscurity, until\ntheir unexpected accomplishment shall make, as in former days, that\nfulfilled which was written. But you must not exert your knightly valour\non him for all that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my saul, and it would be throwing it away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Mungo,\nlaughing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would as soon set out, with hound and horn, to hunt\na sturdied sheep; for he is in a doze again, and up to the chin in\nnumerals, quotients, and dividends.--Mistress Margaret, my pretty\nhoney,\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the beauty of the young citizen made even Sir Mungo\nMalagrowther's grim features relax themselves a little, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis your father\nalways as entertaining as he seems just now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMistress Margaret simpered, bridled, looked to either side, then\nstraight before her; and, having assumed all the airs of bashful\nembarrassment and timidity which were necessary, as she thought, to\ncover a certain shrewd readiness which really belonged to her character,\nat length replied: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat indeed her father was very thoughtful, but she\nhad heard that he took the habit of mind from her grandfather.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour grandfather!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Mungo,--after doubting if he had heard her\naright,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSaid she her grandfather! The lassie is distraught!--I ken\nnae wench on this side of Temple Bar that is derived from so distant a\nrelation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe has got a godfather, however, Sir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George Heriot, again\ninterfering; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I hope you will allow him interest enough with you, to\nrequest you will not put his pretty godchild to so deep a blush.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe better--the better,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Mungo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a credit to her, that,\nbred and born within the sound of Bow-bell, she can blush for any thing;\nand, by my saul, Master George,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, chucking the irritated\nand reluctant damsel under the chin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe is bonny enough to make amends\nfor her lack of ancestry--at least, in such a region as Cheapside,\nwhere, d'ye mind me, the kettle cannot call the porridge-pot--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe damsel blushed, but not so angrily as before. Master George Heriot\nhastened to interrupt the conclusion of Sir Mungo's homely proverb, by\nintroducing him personally to Lord Nigel.\n\nSir Mungo could not at first understand what his host said,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cBread of\nHeaven, wha say ye, man?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nUpon the name of Nigel Olifaunt, Lord Glenvarloch, being again hollowed\ninto his ear, he drew up, and, regarding his entertainer with some\nausterity, rebuked him for not making persons of quality acquainted with\neach other, that they might exchange courtesies before they mingled with\nother folks. He then made as handsome and courtly a congee to his new\nacquaintance as a man maimed in foot and hand could do; and, observing\nhe had known my lord, his father, bid him welcome to London, and hoped\nhe should see him at Court.\n\nNigel in an instant comprehended, as well from Sir Mungo's manner, as\nfrom a strict compression of their entertainer's lips, which intimated\nthe suppression of a desire to laugh, that he was dealing with an\noriginal of no ordinary description, and accordingly, returned his\ncourtesy with suitable punctiliousness. Sir Mungo, in the meanwhile,\ngazed on him with much earnestness; and, as the contemplation of natural\nadvantages was as odious to him as that of wealth, or other adventitious\nbenefits, he had no sooner completely perused the handsome form and good\nfeatures of the young lord, than like one of the comforters of the man\nof Uz, he drew close up to him, to enlarge on the former grandeur of the\nLords of Glenvarloch, and the regret with which he had heard, that their\nrepresentative was not likely to possess the domains of his ancestry.\nAnon, he enlarged upon the beauties of the principal mansion of\nGlenvarloch--the commanding site of the old castle--the noble expanse\nof the lake, stocked with wildfowl for hawking--the commanding screen of\nforest, terminating in a mountain-ridge abounding with deer--and all the\nother advantages of that fine and ancient barony, till Nigel, in spite\nof every effort to the contrary, was unwillingly obliged to sigh.\n\nSir Mungo, skilful in discerning when the withers of those he conversed\nwith were wrung, observed that his new acquaintance winced, and would\nwillingly have pressed the discussion; but the cook's impatient knock\nupon the dresser with the haft of his dudgeon-knife, now gave a signal\nloud enough to be heard from the top of the house to the bottom,\nsummoning, at the same time, the serving-men to place the dinner upon\nthe table, and the guests to partake of it.\n\nSir Mungo, who was an admirer of good cheer,--a taste which, by the\nway, might have some weight in reconciling his dignity to these city\nvisits,--was tolled off by the sound, and left Nigel and the other\nguests in peace, until his anxiety to arrange himself in his due place\nof pre-eminence at the genial board was duly gratified. Here, seated on\nthe left hand of Aunt Judith, he beheld Nigel occupy the station of yet\nhigher honour on the right, dividing that matron from pretty Mistress\nMargaret; but he saw this with the more patience, that there stood\nbetwixt him and the young lord a superb larded capon.\n\nThe dinner proceeded according to the form of the times. All was\nexcellent of the kind; and, besides the Scottish cheer promised, the\nboard displayed beef and pudding, the statutory dainties of Old England.\nA small cupboard of plate, very choicely and beautifully wrought, did\nnot escape the compliments of some of the company, and an oblique\nsneer from Sir Mungo, as intimating the owner's excellence in his own\nmechanical craft.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not ashamed of the workmanship, Sir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the honest\ncitizen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey say, a good cook knows how to lick his own fingers; and,\nmethinks, it were unseemly that I, who have furnished half the cupboards\nin broad Britain, should have my own covered with paltry pewter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe blessing of the clergyman now left the guests at liberty to attack\nwhat was placed before them; and the meal went forward with great\ndecorum, until Aunt Judith, in farther recommendation of the capon,\nassured her company that it was of a celebrated breed of poultry, which\nshe had herself brought from Scotland.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen, like some of his countrymen, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the pitiless Sir Mungo,\nnot without a glance towards his landlord, \u00e2\u0080\u009che has been well larded in\nEngland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are some others of his countrymen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Master Heriot,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cto whom all the lard in England has not been able to render that good\noffice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSir Mungo sneered and reddened, the rest of the company laughed; and the\nsatirist, who had his reasons for not coming to extremity with Master\nGeorge, was silent for the rest of the dinner.\n\nThe dishes were exchanged for confections, and wine of the highest\nquality and flavour; and Nigel saw the entertainments of the wealthiest\nburgomasters, which he had witnessed abroad, fairly outshone by the\nhospitality of a London citizen. Yet there was nothing ostentatious, or\nwhich seemed inconsistent with the degree of an opulent burgher.\n\nWhile the collation proceeded, Nigel, according to the good-breeding of\nthe time, addressed his discourse principally to Mrs. Judith, whom he\nfound to be a woman of a strong Scottish understanding, more inclined\ntowards the Puritans than was her brother George, (for in that relation\nshe stood to him, though he always called her aunt,) attached to him in\nthe strongest degree, and sedulously attentive to all his comforts. As\nthe conversation of this good dame was neither lively nor fascinating,\nthe young lord naturally addressed himself next to the old horologer's\nvery pretty daughter, who sat upon his left hand. From her, however,\nthere was no extracting any reply beyond the measure of a monosyllable;\nand when the young gallant had said the best and most complaisant things\nwhich his courtesy supplied, the smile that mantled upon her pretty\nmouth was so slight and evanescent, as scarce to be discernible.\n\nNigel was beginning to tire of his company, for the old citizens were\nspeaking with his host of commercial matters in language to him totally\nunintelligible, when Sir Mungo Malagrowther suddenly summoned their\nattention.\n\nThat amiable personage had for some time withdrawn from the company into\nthe recess of a projecting window, so formed and placed as to command\na view of the door of the house, and of the street. This situation was\nprobably preferred by Sir Mungo on account of the number of objects\nwhich the streets of a metropolis usually offer, of a kind congenial\nto the thoughts of a splenetic man. What he had hitherto seen passing\nthere, was probably of little consequence; but now a trampling of horse\nwas heard without, and the knight suddenly exclaimed,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my faith,\nMaster George, you had better go look to shop; for here comes Knighton,\nthe Duke of Buckingham's groom, and two fellows after him, as if he were\nmy Lord Duke himself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy cash-keeper is below,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot, without disturbing himself,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand he will let me know if his Grace's commands require my immediate\nattention.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUmph!--cash-keeper?\u00e2\u0080\u009d muttered Sir Mungo to himself; \u00e2\u0080\u009che would have had\nan easy office when I first kend ye.--But,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, speaking aloud,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwill you not come to the window, at least? for Knighton has trundled a\npiece of silver-plate into your house--ha! ha! ha!--trundled it upon its\nedge, as a callan' would drive a hoop. I cannot help laughing--ha! ha!\nha!--at the fellow's impudence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe you could not help laughing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George Heriot, rising up\nand leaving the room, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif your best friend lay dying.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBitter that, my lord--ha?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Mungo, addressing Nigel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur\nfriend is not a goldsmith for nothing--he hath no leaden wit. But I will\ngo down, and see what comes on't.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHeriot, as he descended the stairs, met his cash-keeper coming up, with\nsome concern in his face.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, how now, Roberts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the goldsmith,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat means all this, man?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is Knighton, Master Heriot, from the Court--Knighton, the Duke's\nman. He brought back the salver you carried to Whitehall, flung it into\nthe entrance as if it had been an old pewter platter, and bade me tell\nyou the king would have none of your trumpery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, indeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George Heriot--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNone of my trumpery!--Come hither\ninto the compting-room, Roberts.--Sir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, bowing to the\nknight, who had joined, and was preparing to follow them, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI pray your\nforgiveness for an instant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn virtue of this prohibition, Sir Mungo, who, as well as the rest of\nthe company, had overheard what passed betwixt George Heriot and his\ncash-keeper, saw himself condemned to wait in the outer business-room,\nwhere he would have endeavoured to slake his eager curiosity by\nquestioning Knighton; but that emissary of greatness, after having added\nto the uncivil message of his master some rudeness of his own, had again\nscampered westward, with his satellites at his heels.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the name of the Duke of Buckingham, the omnipotent\nfavourite both of the king and the Prince of Wales, had struck some\nanxiety into the party which remained in the great parlour. He was more\nfeared than beloved, and, if not absolutely of a tyrannical disposition,\nwas accounted haughty, violent, and vindictive. It pressed on Nigel's\nheart, that he himself, though he could not conceive how, nor why,\nmight be the original cause of the resentment of the Duke against his\nbenefactor. The others made their comments in whispers, until the sounds\nreached Ramsay, who had not heard a word of what had previously passed,\nbut, plunged in those studies with which he connected every other\nincident and event, took up only the catchword, and replied,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\nDuke--the Duke of Buckingham--George Villiers--ay--I have spoke with\nLambe about him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur Lord and our Lady! Now, how can you say so, father?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his\ndaughter, who had shrewdness enough to see that her father was touching\nupon dangerous ground.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, ay, child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Ramsay; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe stars do but incline, they\ncannot compel. But well you wot, it is commonly said of his Grace, by\nthose who have the skill to cast nativities, that there was a notable\nconjunction of Mars and Saturn--the apparent or true time of which,\nreducing the calculations of Eichstadius made for the latitude of\nOranienburgh, to that of London, gives seven hours, fifty-five minutes,\nand forty-one seconds----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHold your peace, old soothsayer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot, who at that instant\nentered the room with a calm and steady countenance; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour calculations\nare true and undeniable when they regard brass and wire, and mechanical\nforce; but future events are at the pleasure of Him who bears the hearts\nof kings in his hands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, but, George,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the watchmaker, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere was a concurrence\nof signs at this gentleman's birth, which showed his course would be\na strange one. Long has it been said of him, he was born at the very\nmeeting of night and day, and under crossing and contending influences\nthat may affect both us and him.\n\n    'Full moon and high sea,\n     Great man shalt thou be;\n     Red dawning, stormy sky,\n     Bloody death shalt thou die.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not good to speak of such things,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cespecially of\nthe great; stone walls have ears, and a bird of the air shall carry the\nmatter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSeveral of the guests seemed to be of their host's opinion. The two\nmerchants took brief leave, as if under consciousness that something\nwas wrong. Mistress Margaret, her body-guard of 'prentices being in\nreadiness, plucked her father by the sleeve, and, rescuing him from a\nbrown study, (whether referring to the wheels of Time, or to that of\nFortune, is uncertain,) wished good-night to her friend Mrs. Judith, and\nreceived her godfather's blessing, who, at the same time, put upon\nher slender finger a ring of much taste and some value; for he seldom\nsuffered her to leave him without some token of his affection. Thus\nhonourably dismissed, and accompanied by her escort, she set forth on\nher return to Fleet Street.\n\nSir Mungo had bid adieu to Master Heriot as he came out from the back\ncompting-room, but such was the interest which he took in the affairs\nof his friend, that, when Master George went upstairs, he could not\nhelp walking into that sanctum sanctorum, to see how Master Roberts was\nemployed. The knight found the cash-keeper busy in making extracts from\nthose huge brass-clasped leathern-bound manuscript folios, which are\nthe pride and trust of dealers, and the dread of customers whose year of\ngrace is out. The good knight leant his elbows on the desk, and said to\nthe functionary in a condoling tone of voice,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! you have lost a\ngood customer, I fear, Master Roberts, and are busied in making out his\nbill of charges?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNow, it chanced that Roberts, like Sir Mungo himself, was a little deaf,\nand, like Sir Mungo, knew also how to make the most of it; so that he\nanswered at cross purposes,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI humbly crave your pardon, Sir Mungo, for\nnot having sent in your bill of charge sooner, but my master bade me not\ndisturb you. I will bring the items together in a moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he\nbegan to turn over the leaves of his book of fate, murmuring, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRepairing\nane silver seal-new clasp to his chain of office--ane over-gilt brooch\nto his hat, being a Saint Andrew's cross, with thistles--a copper gilt\npair of spurs,--this to Daniel Driver, we not dealing in the article.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe would have proceeded; but Sir Mungo, not prepared to endure the\nrecital of the catalogue of his own petty debts, and still less\nwilling to satisfy them on the spot, wished the bookkeeper, cavalierly,\ngood-night, and left the house without farther ceremony. The clerk\nlooked after him with a civil city sneer, and immediately resumed the\nmore serious labours which Sir Mungo's intrusion had interrupted.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\n  Things needful we have thought on; but the thing\n  Of all most needful--that which Scripture terms,\n  As if alone it merited regard,\n  The ONE thing needful--that's yet unconsider'd.\n                       _The Chamberlain._\n\nWhen the rest of the company had taken their departure from Master\nHeriot's house, the young Lord of Glenvarloch also offered to take\nleave; but his host detained him for a few minutes, until all were gone\nexcepting the clergyman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d then said the worthy citizen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe have had our permitted hour\nof honest and hospitable pastime, and now I would fain delay you for\nanother and graver purpose, as it is our custom, when we have the\nbenefit of good Mr. Windsor's company, that he reads the prayers of the\nchurch for the evening before we separate. Your excellent father, my\nlord, would not have departed before family worship--I hope the same\nfrom your lordship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith pleasure, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand you add in the invitation an\nadditional obligation to those with which you have loaded me. When young\nmen forget what is their duty, they owe deep thanks to the friend who\nwill remind them of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile they talked together in this manner, the serving-men had removed\nthe folding-tables, brought forward a portable reading-desk, and placed\nchairs and hassocks for their master, their mistress, and the noble\nstranger. Another low chair, or rather a sort of stool, was placed close\nbeside that of Master Heriot; and though the circumstance was trivial,\nNigel was induced to notice it, because, when about to occupy that\nseat, he was prevented by a sign from the old gentleman, and motioned\nto another of somewhat more elevation. The clergyman took his station\nbehind the reading-desk. The domestics, a numerous family both of clerks\nand servants, including Moniplies, attended, with great gravity, and\nwere accommodated with benches.\n\nThe household were all seated, and, externally at least, composed\nto devout attention, when a low knock was heard at the door of the\napartment; Mrs. Judith looked anxiously at her brother, as if desiring\nto know his pleasure. He nodded his head gravely, and looked to the\ndoor. Mrs. Judith immediately crossed the chamber, opened the door, and\nled into the apartment a beautiful creature, whose sudden and singular\nappearance might have made her almost pass for an apparition. She\nwas deadly pale-there was not the least shade of vital red to enliven\nfeatures, which were exquisitely formed, and might, but for that\ncircumstance, have been termed transcendently beautiful. Her long black\nhair fell down over her shoulders and down her back, combed smoothly and\nregularly, but without the least appearance of decoration or ornament,\nwhich looked very singular at a period when head-gear, as it was called,\nof one sort or other, was generally used by all ranks. Her dress was of\nwhite, of the simplest fashion, and hiding all her person excepting\nthe throat, face, and hands. Her form was rather beneath than above the\nmiddle size, but so justly proportioned and elegantly made, that\nthe spectator's attention was entirely withdrawn from her size. In\ncontradiction of the extreme plainness of all the rest of her attire,\nshe wore a necklace which a duchess might have envied, so large and\nlustrous were the brilliants of which it was composed; and around her\nwaist a zone of rubies of scarce inferior value.\n\nWhen this singular figure entered the apartment, she cast her eyes on\nNigel, and paused, as if uncertain whether to advance or retreat. The\nglance which she took of him seemed to be one rather of uncertainty and\nhesitation, than of bashfulness or timidity. Aunt Judith took her by the\nhand, and led her slowly forward--her dark eyes, however, continued to\nbe fixed on Nigel, with an expression of melancholy by which he felt\nstrangely affected. Even when she was seated on the vacant stool, which\nwas placed there probably for her accommodation, she again looked on him\nmore than once with the same pensive, lingering, and anxious expression,\nbut without either shyness or embarrassment, not even so much as to call\nthe slightest degree of complexion into her cheek.\n\nSo soon as this singular female had taken up the prayer-book, which\nwas laid upon her cushion, she seemed immersed in devotional duty; and\nalthough Nigel's attention to the service was so much disturbed by this\nextraordinary apparition, that he looked towards her repeatedly in\nthe course of the service, he could never observe that her eyes or her\nthoughts strayed so much as a single moment from the task in which she\nwas engaged. Nigel himself was less attentive, for the appearance of\nthis lady seemed so extraordinary, that, strictly as he had been bred up\nby his father to pay the most reverential attention during performance\nof divine service, his thoughts in spite of himself were disturbed by\nher presence, and he earnestly wished the prayers were ended, that\nhis curiosity might obtain some gratification. When the service was\nconcluded, and each had remained, according to the decent and edifying\npractice of the church, concentrated in mental devotion for a short\nspace, the mysterious visitant arose ere any other person stirred; and\nNigel remarked that none of the domestics left their places, oreven\nmoved, until she had first kneeled on one knee to Heriot, who seemed to\nbless her with his hand laid on her head, and a melancholy solemnity of\nlook and action. She then bended her body, but without kneeling, to Mrs.\nJudith, and having performed these two acts of reverence, she left the\nroom; yet just in the act of her departure, she once more turned her\npenetrating eyes on Nigel with a fixed look, which compelled him to turn\nhis own aside. When he looked towards her again, he saw only the skirt\nof her white mantle as she left the apartment.\n\nThe domestics then rose and dispersed themselves--wine, and fruit, and\nspices, were offered to Lord Nigel and to the clergyman, and the latter\ntook his leave. The young lord would fain have accompanied him, in hope\nto get some explanation of the apparition which he had beheld, but\nhe was stopped by his host, who requested to speak with him in his\ncompting-room.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the citizen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat your preparations for\nattending Court are in such forwardness that you can go thither the day\nafter to-morrow. It is, perhaps, the last day, for some time, that his\nMajesty will hold open Court for all who have pretensions by birth,\nrank, or office to attend upon him. On the subsequent day he goes\nto Theobald's, where he is so much occupied with hunting and other\npleasures, that he cares not to be intruded on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall be in all outward readiness to pay my duty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young\nnobleman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyet I have little heart to do it. The friends from whom I\nought to have found encouragement and protection, have proved cold and\nfalse--I certainly will not trouble _them_ for their countenance on\nthis occasion--and yet I must confess my childish unwillingness to enter\nquite alone upon so new a scene.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is bold of a mechanic like me to make such an offer to a nobleman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I must attend at Court to-morrow. I can accompany\nyou as far as the presence-chamber, from my privilege as being of the\nhousehold. I can facilitate your entrance, should you find difficulty,\nand I can point out the proper manner and time of approaching the king.\nBut I do not know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, smiling, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhether these little advantages\nwill not be overbalanced by the incongruity of a nobleman receiving them\nfrom the hands of an old smith.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom the hands rather of the only friend I have found in London,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nNigel, offering his hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, if you think of the matter in that way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the honest\ncitizen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is no more to be said--I will come for you to-morrow,\nwith a barge proper to the occasion.--But remember, my good young lord,\nthat I do not, like some men of my degree, wish to take opportunity to\nstep beyond it, and associate with my superiors in rank, and therefore\ndo not fear to mortify my presumption, by suffering me to keep my\ndistance in the presence, and where it is fitting for both of us to\nseparate; and for what remains, most truly happy shall I be in proving\nof service to the son of my ancient patron.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe style of conversation led so far from the point which had interested\nthe young nobleman's curiosity, that there was no returning to it that\nnight. He therefore exchanged thanks and greetings with George Heriot,\nand took his leave, promising to be equipped and in readiness to embark\nwith him on the second successive morning at ten o'clock.\n\nThe generation of linkboys, celebrated by Count Anthony Hamilton, as\npeculiar to London, had already, in the reign of James I., begun their\nfunctions, and the service of one of them with his smoky torch, had\nbeen secured to light the young Scottish lord and his follower to their\nlodgings, which, though better acquainted than formerly with the city,\nthey might in the dark have run some danger of missing. This gave the\ningenious Mr. Moniplies an opportunity of gathering close up to his\nmaster, after he had gone through the form of slipping his left arm into\nthe handles of his buckler, and loosening his broadsword in the sheath,\nthat he might be ready for whatever should befall.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it were not for the wine and the good cheer which we have had in\nyonder old man's house, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said this sapient follower, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand that\nI ken him by report to be a just living man in many respects, and a real\nEdinburgh gutterblood, I should have been well pleased to have seen how\nhis feet were shaped, and whether he had not a cloven cloot under the\nbraw roses and cordovan shoon of his.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, you rascal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have been too kindly treated,\nand now that you have filled your ravenous stomach, you are railing on\nthe good gentleman that relieved you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnder favour, no, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Moniplies,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would only like to see\nsomething mair about him. I have eaten his meat, it is true--more shame\nthat the like of him should have meat to give, when your lordship and\nme could scarce have gotten, on our own account, brose and a bear\nbannock--I have drunk his wine, too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see you have,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied his master, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca great deal more than you should\nhave done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnder your patience, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Moniplies, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are pleased to say\nthat, because I crushed a quart with that jolly boy Jenkin, as they\ncall the 'prentice boy, and that was out of mere acknowledgment for his\nformer kindness--I own that I, moreover, sung the good old song of Elsie\nMarley, so as they never heard it chanted in their lives----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd withal (as John Bunyan says) as they went on their way, he sung--\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cO, do ye ken Elsie Marley, honey--\n     The wife that sells the barley, honey?\n     For Elsie Marley's grown sae fine,\n     She winna get up to feed the swine.--\n         O, do ye ken----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere in mid career was the songster interrupted by the stern gripe\nof his master, who threatened to baton him to death if he brought the\ncity-watch upon them by his ill-timed melody.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI crave pardon, my lord--I humbly crave pardon--only when I think of\nthat Jen Win, as they call him, I can hardly help humming--'O, do ye\nken'--But I crave your honour's pardon, and will be totally dumb, if you\ncommand me so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, sirrah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctalk on, for I well know you would say and\nsuffer more under pretence of holding your peace, than when you get an\nunbridled license. How is it, then? What have you to say against Master\nHeriot?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt seems more than probable, that in permitting this license, the young\nlord hoped his attendant would stumble upon the subject of the young\nlady who had appeared at prayers in a manner so mysterious. But whether\nthis was the case, or whether he merely desired that Moniplies should\nutter, in a subdued and under tone of voice, those spirits which might\notherwise have vented themselves in obstreperous song, it is certain he\npermitted his attendant to proceed with his story in his own way.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd therefore,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the orator, availing himself of his immunity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nwould like to ken what sort of carle this Maister Heriot is. He hath\nsupplied your lordship with wealth of gold, as I can understand; and if\nhe has, I make it for certain he hath had his ain end in it, according\nto the fashion of the world. Now, had your lordship your own good\nlands at your guiding, doubtless this person, with most of his\ncraft--goldsmiths they call themselves--I say usurers--wad be glad to\nexchange so many pounds of African dust, by whilk I understand gold,\nagainst so many fair acres, and hundreds of acres, of broad Scottish\nland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you know I have no land,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young lord, \u00e2\u0080\u009cat least none that\ncan be affected by any debt which I can at present become obliged for--I\nthink you need not have reminded me of that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue, my lord, most true; and, as your lordship says, open to the\nmeanest capacity, without any unnecessary expositions. Now, therefore,\nmy lord, unless Maister George Heriot has something mair to allege as\na motive for his liberality, vera different from the possession of your\nestate--and moreover, as he could gain little by the capture of your\nbody, wherefore should it not be your soul that he is in pursuit of?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy soul, you rascal!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young lord; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat good should my soul do\nhim?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do I ken about that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Moniplies; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey go about roaring and\nseeking whom they may devour--doubtless, they like the food that they\nrage so much about--and, my lord, they say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added Moniplies, drawing up\nstill closer to his master's side, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey say that Master Heriot has one\nspirit in his house already.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow, or what do you mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will break your head, you\ndrunken knave, if you palter with me any longer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDrunken?\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered his trusty adherent, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand is this the story?--why,\nhow could I but drink your lordship's health on my bare knees, when\nMaster Jenkin began it to me?--hang them that would not--I would have\ncut the impudent knave's hams with my broadsword, that should make\nscruple of it, and so have made him kneel when he should have found it\ndifficult to rise again. But touching the spirit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he proceeded, finding\nthat his master made no answer to his valorous tirade, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour lordship\nhas seen her with your own eyes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw no spirit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Glenvarloch, but yet breathing thick as one who\nexpects some singular disclosure, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat mean you by a spirit?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou saw a young lady come in to prayers, that spoke not a word to\nany one, only made becks and bows to the old gentleman and lady of the\nhouse--ken ye wha she is?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, indeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009csome relation of the family, I suppose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDeil a bit--deil a bit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Moniplies, hastily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot a\nblood-drop's kin to them, if she had a drop of blood in her body--I tell\nyou but what all human beings allege to be truth, that swell within hue\nand cry of Lombard Street--that lady, or quean, or whatever you choose\nto call her, has been dead in the body these many a year, though she\nhaunts them, as we have seen, even at their very devotions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will allow her to be a good spirit at least,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel Olifaunt,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009csince she chooses such a time to visit her friends?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor that I kenna, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the superstitious follower; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI ken\nno spirit that would have faced the right down hammer-blow of Mess John\nKnox, whom my father stood by in his very warst days, bating a chance\ntime when the Court, which my father supplied with butcher-meat, was\nagainst him. But yon divine has another airt from powerful\nMaster Rollock, and Mess David Black, of North Leith, and sic\nlike.--Alack-a-day! wha can ken, if it please your lordship, whether\nsic prayers as the Southron read out of their auld blethering black\nmess-book there, may not be as powerful to invite fiends, as a right\nred-het prayer warm fraw the heart, may be powerful to drive them away,\neven as the Evil Spirit was driven by he smell of the fish's liver from\nthe bridal-chamber of Sara, the daughter of Raguel? As to whilk story,\nnevertheless, I make scruple to say whether it be truth or not, better\nmen than I am having doubted on that matter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well, well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his master, impatiently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe are now near home,\nand I have permitted you to speak of this matter for once, that we may\nhave an end to your prying folly, and your idiotical superstitions, for\never. For whom do you, or your absurd authors or informers, take this\nlady?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can sae naething preceesely as to that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Moniplies;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ccertain it is her body died and was laid in the grave many a day since,\nnotwithstanding she still wanders on earth, and chiefly amongst Maister\nHeriot's family, though she hath been seen in other places by them that\nwell knew her. But who she is, I will not warrant to say, or how she\nbecomes attached, like a Highland Brownie, to some peculiar family.\nThey say she has a row of apartments of her own, ante-room, parlour, and\nbedroom; but deil a bed she sleeps in but her own coffin, and the walls,\ndoors, and windows are so chinked up, as to prevent the least blink of\ndaylight from entering; and then she dwells by torchlight--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo what purpose, if she be a spirit?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel Olifaunt.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can I tell your lordship?\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered his attendant. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thank God I\nknow nothing of her likings, or mislikings--only her coffin is there;\nand I leave your lordship to guess what a live person has to do with a\ncoffin. As little as a ghost with a lantern, I trow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat reason,\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan a creature, so young and so\nbeautiful, have already habitually to contemplate her bed of last-long\nrest?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn troth, I kenna, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Moniplies; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut there is the\ncoffin, as they told me who have seen it: it is made of heben-wood, with\nsilver nails, and lined all through with three-piled damask, might serve\na princess to rest in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSingular,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, whose brain, like that of most active young\nspirits, was easily caught by the singular and the romantic; \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoes she\nnot eat with the family?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho!--she!\u00e2\u0080\u009d--exclaimed Moniplies, as if surprised at the question;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthey would need a lang spoon would sup with her, I trow. Always there\nis something put for her into the Tower, as they call it, whilk is a\nwhigmaleery of a whirling-box, that turns round half on the tae side o'\nthe wa', half on the tother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have seen the contrivance in foreign nunneries,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lord of\nGlenvarloch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd is it thus she receives her food?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey tell me something is put in ilka day, for fashion's sake,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied\nthe attendant; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it's no to be supposed she would consume it, ony\nmair than the images of Bel and the Dragon consumed the dainty vivers\nthat were placed before them. There are stout yeomen and chamber-queans\nin the house, enow to play the part of Lick-it-up-a', as well as the\nthreescore and ten priests of Bel, besides their wives and children.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd she is never seen in the family but when the hour of prayer\narrives?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the master.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever, that I hear of,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the servant.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is singular,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel Olifaunt, musing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWere it not for the\nornaments which she wears, and still more for her attendance upon the\nservice of the Protestant Church, I should know what to think, and\nshould believe her either a Catholic votaress, who, for some cogent\nreason, was allowed to make her cell here in London, or some unhappy\nPopish devotee, who was in the course of undergoing a dreadful penance.\nAs it is, I know not what to deem of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis reverie was interrupted by the linkboy knocking at the door of\nhonest John Christie, whose wife came forth with \u00e2\u0080\u009cquips, and becks, and\nwreathed smiles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to welcome her honoured guest on his return to his\napartment.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\n  Ay! mark the matron well--and laugh not, Harry,\n  At her old steeple-hat and velvet guard--\n  I've call'd her like the ear of Dionysius;\n  I mean that ear-form'd vault, built o'er his dungeon,\n  To catch the groans and discontented murmurs\n  Of his poor bondsmen--Even so doth Martha\n  Drink up, for her own purpose, all that passes,\n  Or is supposed to pass, in this wide city--\n  She can retail it too, if that her profit\n  Shall call on her to do so; and retail it\n  For your advantage, so that you can make\n  Your profit jump with hers.\n                            The Conspiracy.\n\nWe must now introduce to the reader's acquaintance another character,\nbusy and important far beyond her ostensible situation in society--in\na word, Dame Ursula Suddlechop, wife of Benjamin Suddlechop, the most\nrenowned barber in all Fleet Street. This dame had her own particular\nmerits, the principal part of which was (if her own report could be\ntrusted) an infinite desire to be of service to her fellow-creatures.\nLeaving to her thin half-starved partner the boast of having the most\ndexterous snap with his fingers of any shaver in London, and the care\nof a shop where starved apprentices flayed the faces of those who\nwere boobies enough to trust them, the dame drove a separate and more\nlucrative trade, which yet had so many odd turns and windings, that it\nseemed in many respects to contradict itself.\n\nIts highest and most important duties were of a very secret and\nconfidential nature, and Dame Ursula Suddlechop was never known to\nbetray any transaction intrusted to her, unless she had either been\nindifferently paid for her service, or that some one found it convenient\nto give her a double douceur to make her disgorge the secret; and\nthese contingencies happened in so few cases, that her character for\ntrustiness remained as unimpeached as that for honesty and benevolence.\n\nIn fact, she was a most admirable matron, and could be useful to the\nimpassioned and the frail in the rise, progress, and consequences of\ntheir passion. She could contrive an interview for lovers who could show\nproper reasons for meeting privately; she could relieve the frail fair\none of the burden of a guilty passion, and perhaps establish the hopeful\noffspring of unlicensed love as the heir of some family whose love was\nlawful, but where an heir had not followed the union. More than this she\ncould do, and had been concerned in deeper and dearer secrets. She had\nbeen a pupil of Mrs. Turner, and learned from her the secret of making\nthe yellow starch, and, it may be, two or three other secrets of more\nconsequence, though perhaps none that went to the criminal extent of\nthose whereof her mistress was accused. But all that was deep and dark\nin her real character was covered by the show of outward mirth and\ngood-humour, the hearty laugh and buxom jest with which the dame knew\nwell how to conciliate the elder part of her neighbours, and the many\npetty arts by which she could recommend herself to the younger, those\nespecially of her own sex.\n\nDame Ursula was, in appearance, scarce past forty, and her full, but\nnot overgrown form, and still comely features, although her person was\nplumped out, and her face somewhat coloured by good cheer, had a joyous\nexpression of gaiety and good-humour, which set off the remains of\nbeauty in the wane. Marriages, births, and christenings were seldom\nthought to be performed with sufficient ceremony, for a considerable\ndistance round her abode, unless Dame Ursley, as they called her, was\npresent. She could contrive all sorts of pastimes, games, and jests,\nwhich might amuse the large companies which the hospitality of our\nancestors assembled together on such occasions, so that her presence was\nliterally considered as indispensable in the families of all citizens of\nordinary rank, at such joyous periods. So much also was she supposed to\nknow of life and its labyrinths, that she was the willing confidant\nof half the loving couples in the vicinity, most of whom used to\ncommunicate their secrets to, and receive their counsel from, Dame\nUrsley. The rich rewarded her services with rings, owches, or gold\npieces, which she liked still better; and she very generously gave\nher assistance to the poor, on the same mixed principles as young\npractitioners in medicine assist them, partly from compassion, and\npartly to keep her hand in use.\n\nDame Ursley's reputation in the city was the greater that her practice\nhad extended beyond Temple Bar, and that she had acquaintances, nay,\npatrons and patronesses, among the quality, whose rank, as their members\nwere much fewer, and the prospect of approaching the courtly sphere much\nmore difficult, bore a degree of consequence unknown to the present day,\nwhen the toe of the citizen presses so close on the courtier's heel.\nDame Ursley maintained her intercourse with this superior rank of\ncustomers, partly by driving a small trade in perfumes, essences,\npomades, head-gears from France, dishes or ornaments from China, then\nalready beginning to be fashionable; not to mention drugs of various\ndescriptions, chiefly for the use of the ladies, and partly by other\nservices, more or less connected with the esoteric branches of her\nprofession heretofore alluded to.\n\nPossessing such and so many various modes of thriving, Dame Ursley\nwas nevertheless so poor, that she might probably have mended her own\ncircumstances, as well as her husband's, if she had renounced them all,\nand set herself quietly down to the care of her own household, and to\nassist Benjamin in the concerns of his trade. But Ursula was luxurious\nand genial in her habits, and could no more have endured the stinted\neconomy of Benjamin's board, than she could have reconciled herself to\nthe bald chat of his conversation.\n\nIt was on the evening of the day on which Lord Nigel Olifaunt dined with\nthe wealthy goldsmith, that we must introduce Ursula Suddlechop upon\nthe stage. She had that morning made a long tour to Westminster, was\nfatigued, and had assumed a certain large elbow-chair, rendered smooth\nby frequent use, placed on one side of her chimney, in which there was\nlit a small but bright fire. Here she observed, betwixt sleeping and\nwaking, the simmering of a pot of well-spiced ale, on the brown surface\nof which bobbed a small crab-apple, sufficiently roasted, while a little\nmulatto girl watched, still more attentively, the process of dressing\na veal sweetbread, in a silver stewpan which occupied the other side\nof the chimney. With these viands, doubtless, Dame Ursula proposed\nconcluding the well spent day, of which she reckoned the labour over,\nand the rest at her own command. She was deceived, however; for just\nas the ale, or, to speak technically, the lamb's-wool, was fitted for\ndrinking, and the little dingy maiden intimated that the sweetbread was\nready to be eaten, the thin cracked voice of Benjamin was heard from the\nbottom of the stairs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Dame Ursley--why, wife, I say--why, dame--why, love, you are\nwanted more than a strop for a blunt razor--why, dame--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would some one would draw a razor across thy windpipe, thou bawling\nass!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the dame to herself, in the first moment of irritation\nagainst her clamorous helpmate; and then called aloud,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, what is\nthe matter, Master Suddlechop? I am just going to slip into bed; I have\nbeen daggled to and fro the whole day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, sweetheart, it is not me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the patient Benjamin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut the\nScots laundry-maid from neighbour Ramsay's, who must speak with you\nincontinent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt the word sweetheart, Dame Ursley cast a wistful look at the mess\nwhich was stewed to a second in the stewpan, and then replied, with\na sigh,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cBid Scots Jenny come up, Master Suddlechop. I shall be very\nhappy to hear what she has to say;\u00e2\u0080\u009d then added in a lower tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I\nhope she will go to the devil in the flame of a tar-barrel, like many a\nScots witch before her!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Scots laundress entered accordingly, and having heard nothing of the\nlast kind wish of Dame Suddlechop, made her reverence with considerable\nrespect, and said, her young mistress had returned home unwell, and\nwished to see her neighbour, Dame Ursley, directly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd why will it not do to-morrow, Jenny, my good woman?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame\nUrsley; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I have been as far as Whitehall to-day already, and I am\nwell-nigh worn off my feet, my good woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAweel!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Jenny, with great composure, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand if that sae be sae,\nI maun take the langer tramp mysell, and maun gae down the waterside for\nauld Mother Redcap, at the Hungerford Stairs, that deals in comforting\nyoung creatures, e'en as you do yoursell, hinny; for ane o' ye the bairn\nmaun see before she sleeps, and that's a' that I ken on't.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, the old emissary, without farther entreaty, turned on her\nheel, and was about to retreat, when Dame Ursley exclaimed,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no--if\nthe sweet child, your mistress, has any necessary occasion for good\nadvice and kind tendance, you need not go to Mother Redcap, Janet. She\nmay do very well for skippers' wives, chandlers' daughters, and such\nlike; but nobody shall wait on pretty Mistress Margaret, the daughter of\nhis most Sacred Majesty's horologer, excepting and saving myself. And\nso I will but take my chopins and my cloak, and put on my muffler,\nand cross the street to neighbour Ramsay's in an instant. But tell me\nyourself, good Jenny, are you not something tired of your young lady's\nfrolics and change of mind twenty times a-day?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn troth, not I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the patient drudge, \u00e2\u0080\u009cunless it may be when she\nis a wee fashious about washing her laces; but I have been her\nkeeper since she was a bairn, neighbour Suddlechop, and that makes a\ndifference.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Ursley, still busied putting on additional defences\nagainst the night air; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand you know for certain that she has two\nhundred pounds a-year in good land, at her own free disposal?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLeft by her grandmother, heaven rest her soul!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Scotswoman;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand to a daintier lassie she could not have bequeathed it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery true, very true, mistress; for, with all her little whims, I have\nalways said Mistress Margaret Ramsay was the prettiest girl in the ward;\nand, Jenny, I warrant the poor child has had no supper?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJenny could not say but it was the case, for, her master being out, the\ntwa 'prentice lads had gone out after shutting shop, to fetch them home,\nand she and the other maid had gone out to Sandy MacGivan's, to see a\nfriend frae Scotland.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs was very natural, Mrs. Janet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Ursley, who found her\ninterest in assenting to all sorts of propositions from all sorts of\npersons.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd so the fire went out, too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--said Jenny.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhich was the most natural of the whole,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Suddlechop; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand\nso, to cut the matter short, Jenny, I'll carry over the little bit of\nsupper that I was going to eat. For dinner I have tasted none, and it\nmay be my young pretty Mistress Marget will eat a morsel with me; for\nit is mere emptiness, Mistress Jenny, that often puts these fancies\nof illness into young folk's heads.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, she put the silver\nposset-cup with the ale into Jenny's hands and assuming her mantle with\nthe alacrity of one determined to sacrifice inclination to duty, she\nhid the stewpan under its folds, and commanded Wilsa, the little mulatto\ngirl, to light them across the street.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhither away, so late?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the barber, whom they passed seated with\nhis starveling boys round a mess of stockfish and parsnips, in the shop\nbelow.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I were to tell you, Gaffer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the dame, with most contemptuous\ncoolness, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not think you could do my errand, so I will e'en keep it\nto myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Benjamin was too much accustomed to his wife's independent\nmode of conduct, to pursue his inquiry farther; nor did the dame tarry\nfor farther question, but marched out at the door, telling the eldest of\nthe boys \u00e2\u0080\u009cto sit up till her return, and look to the house the whilst.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe night was dark and rainy, and although the distance betwixt the two\nshops was short, it allowed Dame Ursley leisure enough, while she strode\nalong with high-tucked petticoats, to embitter it by the following\ngrumbling reflections--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wonder what I have done, that I must needs\ntrudge at every old beldam's bidding, and every young minx's maggot!\nI have been marched from Temple Bar to Whitechapel, on the matter of a\npinmaker's wife having pricked her fingers--marry, her husband that made\nthe weapon might have salved the wound.--And here is this fantastic ape,\npretty Mistress Marget, forsooth--such a beauty as I could make of a\nDutch doll, and as fantastic, and humorous, and conceited, as if she\nwere a duchess. I have seen her in the same day as changeful as a\nmarmozet and as stubborn as a mule. I should like to know whether\nher little conceited noddle, or her father's old crazy calculating\njolter-pate, breeds most whimsies. But then there's that two hundred\npounds a-year in dirty land, and the father is held a close chuff,\nthough a fanciful--he is our landlord besides, and she has begged a\nlate day from him for our rent; so, God help me, I must be\ncomfortable--besides, the little capricious devil is my only key to get\nat Master George Heriot's secret, and it concerns my character to find\nthat out; and so, ANDIAMOS, as the lingua franca hath it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThus pondering, she moved forward with hasty strides until she arrived\nat the watchmaker's habitation. The attendant admitted them by means of\na pass-key. Onward glided Dame Ursula, now in glimmer and now in gloom,\nnot like the lovely Lady Cristabelle through Gothic sculpture and\nancient armour, but creeping and stumbling amongst relics of old\nmachines, and models of new inventions in various branches of\nmechanics with which wrecks of useless ingenuity, either in a broken\nor half-finished shape, the apartment of the fanciful though ingenious\nmechanist was continually lumbered.\n\nAt length they attained, by a very narrow staircase, pretty Mistress\nMargaret's apartment, where she, the cynosure of the eyes of every bold\nyoung bachelor in Fleet Street, sat in a posture which hovered between\nthe discontented and the disconsolate. For her pretty back and shoulders\nwere rounded into a curve, her round and dimpled chin reposed in the\nhollow of her little palm, while the fingers were folded over her mouth;\nher elbow rested on a table, and her eyes seemed fixed upon the dying\ncharcoal, which was expiring in a small grate. She scarce turned her\nhead when Dame Ursula entered, and when the presence of that estimable\nmatron was more precisely announced in words by the old Scotswoman,\nMistress Margaret, without changing her posture, muttered some sort of\nanswer that was wholly unintelligible.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo your ways down to the kitchen with Wilsa, good Mistress Jenny,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nDame Ursula, who was used to all sorts of freaks, on the part of her\npatients or clients, whichever they might be termed; \u00e2\u0080\u009cput the stewpan\nand the porringer by the fireside, and go down below--I must speak to my\npretty love, Mistress Margaret, by myself--and there is not a bachelor\nbetwixt this and Bow but will envy me the privilege.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe attendants retired as directed, and Dame Ursula, having availed\nherself of the embers of charcoal, to place her stewpan to the best\nadvantage, drew herself as close as she could to her patient, and began\nin a low, soothing, and confidential tone of voice, to inquire what\nailed her pretty flower of neighbours.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing, dame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret somewhat pettishly, and changing her\nposture so as rather to turn her back upon the kind inquirer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing, lady-bird!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Dame Suddlechop; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand do you use to send\nfor your friends out of bed at this hour for nothing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was not I who sent for you, dame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the malecontent maiden.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd who was it, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ursula; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor if I had not been sent for, I\nhad not been here at this time of night, I promise you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was the old Scotch fool Jenny, who did it out of her own head, I\nsuppose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor she has been stunning me these two hours\nabout you and Mother Redcap.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMe and Mother Redcap!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Ursula, \u00e2\u0080\u009can old fool indeed, that\ncouples folk up so.--But come, come, my sweet little neighbour, Jenny\nis no such fool after all; she knows young folks want more and better\nadvice than her own, and she knows, too, where to find it for them; so\nyou must take heart of grace, my pretty maiden, and tell me what you are\nmoping about, and then let Dame Ursula alone for finding out a cure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, an ye be so wise, Mother Ursula,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the girl, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou may guess\nwhat I ail without my telling you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the complaisant matron, \u00e2\u0080\u009cno one can play\nbetter than I at the good old game of What is my thought like? Now I'll\nwarrant that little head of yours is running on a new head-tire, a foot\nhigher than those our city dames wear--or you are all for a trip\nto Islington or Ware, and your father is cross and will not\nconsent--or----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOr you are an old fool, Dame Suddlechop,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret, peevishly,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand must needs trouble yourself about matters you know nothing of.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFool as much as you will, mistress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Ursula, offended in her\nturn, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut not so very many years older than yourself, mistress.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! we are angry, are we?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the beauty; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand pray, Madam Ursula,\nhow come you, that are not so many years older than me, to talk about\nsuch nonsense to me, who am so many years younger, and who yet have too\nmuch sense to care about head-gears and Islington?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well, young mistress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the sage counsellor, rising, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nperceive I can be of no use here; and methinks, since you know your own\nmatters so much better than other people do, you might dispense with\ndisturbing folks at midnight to ask their advice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, now you are angry, mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret, detaining her; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis\ncomes of your coming out at eventide without eating your supper--I\nnever heard you utter a cross word after you had finished your little\nmorsel.--Here, Janet, a trencher and salt for Dame Ursula;--and what\nhave you in that porringer, dame?--Filthy clammy ale, as I would\nlive--Let Janet fling it out of the window, or keep it for my father's\nmorning draught; and she shall bring you the pottle of sack that was set\nready for him--good man, he will never find out the difference, for ale\nwill wash down his dusty calculations quite as well as wine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTruly, sweetheart, I am of your opinion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Ursula, whose\ntemporary displeasure vanished at once before these preparations for\ngood cheer; and so, settling herself on the great easy-chair, with\na three-legged table before her, she began to dispatch, with good\nappetite, the little delicate dish which she had prepared for herself.\nShe did not, however, fail in the duties of civility, and earnestly, but\nin vain, pressed Mistress Margaret to partake her dainties. The damsel\ndeclined the invitation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt least pledge me in a glass of sack,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Ursula; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have heard\nmy grandame say, that before the gospellers came in, the old Catholic\nfather confessors and their penitents always had a cup of sack together\nbefore confession; and you are my penitent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall drink no sack, I am sure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I told you\nbefore, that if you cannot find out what ails me, I shall never have the\nheart to tell it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, she turned away from Dame Ursula once more, and resumed her\nmusing posture, with her hand on her elbow, and her back, at least one\nshoulder, turned towards her confidant.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Ursula, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must exert my skill in good\nearnest.--You must give me this pretty hand, and I will tell you by\npalmistry, as well as any gipsy of them all, what foot it is you halt\nupon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs if I halted on any foot at all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret, something\nscornfully, but yielding her left hand to Ursula, and continuing at the\nsame time her averted position.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see brave lines here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ursula, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand not ill to read\nneither--pleasure and wealth, and merry nights and late mornings to my\nBeauty, and such an equipage as shall shake Whitehall. O, have I touched\nyou there?--and smile you now, my pretty one?--for why should not he be\nLord Mayor, and go to Court in his gilded caroch, as others have done\nbefore him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLord Mayor? pshaw!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Margaret.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd why pshaw at my Lord Mayor, sweetheart? or perhaps you pshaw at my\nprophecy; but there is a cross in every one's line of life as well as\nin yours, darling. And what though I see a 'prentice's flat cap in this\npretty palm, yet there is a sparking black eye under it, hath not its\nmatch in the Ward of Farringdon-Without.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhom do you mean, dame?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret coldly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhom should I mean,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Ursula, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut the prince of 'prentices,\nand king of good company, Jenkin Vincent?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOut, woman--Jenkin Vincent?--a clown--a Cockney!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the\nindignant damsel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, sets the wind in that quarter, Beauty!\u00e2\u0080\u009d quoth the dame; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy, it\nhas changed something since we spoke together last, for then I would\nhave sworn it blew fairer for poor Jin Vin; and the poor lad dotes on\nyou too, and would rather see your eyes than the first glimpse of the\nsun on the great holiday on May-day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would my eyes had the power of the sun to blind his, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nMargaret, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto teach the drudge his place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Ursula, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere be some who say that Frank Tunstall\nis as proper a lad as Jin Vin, and of surety he is third cousin to\na knighthood, and come of a good house; and so mayhap you may be for\nnorthward ho!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe I may\u00e2\u0080\u009d--answered Margaret, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut not with my father's 'prentice--I\nthank you, Dame Ursula.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, then, the devil may guess your thoughts for me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Ursula;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthis comes of trying to shoe a filly that is eternally wincing and\nshifting ground!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHear me, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand mind what I say.--This day I dined\nabroad--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can tell you where,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered her counsellor,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cwith your godfather\nthe rich goldsmith--ay, you see I know something--nay, I could tell you,\nas I would, with whom, too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret, turning suddenly round with an accent of strong\nsurprise, and colouring up to the eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith old Sir Mungo Malagrowther,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the oracular dame,--\u00e2\u0080\u009che was\ntrimmed in my Benjamin's shop in his way to the city.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPshaw! the frightful old mouldy skeleton!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the damsel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed you say true, my dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the confidant,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cit is a shame\nto him to be out of Saint Pancras's charnel-house, for I know no\nother place he is fit for, the foul-mouthed old railer. He said to my\nhusband--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSomewhat which signifies nothing to our purpose, I dare say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n interrupted Margaret. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must speak, then.--There dined with us a\nnobleman--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA nobleman! the maiden's mad!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Ursula.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere dined with us, I say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Margaret, without regarding the\ninterruption, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca nobleman--a Scottish nobleman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow Our Lady keep her!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the confidant, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe is quite\nfrantic!--heard ever any one of a watchmaker's daughter falling in love\nwith a nobleman--and a Scots nobleman, to make the matter complete,\nwho are all as proud as Lucifer, and as poor as Job?--A Scots nobleman,\nquotha? I had lief you told me of a Jew pedlar. I would have you think\nhow all this is to end, pretty one, before you jump in the dark.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is nothing to you, Ursula--it is your assistance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mistress\nMargaret, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand not your advice, that I am desirous to have, and you know\nI can make it worth your while.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, it is not for the sake of lucre, Mistress Margaret,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered\nthe obliging dame; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut truly I would have you listen to some\nadvice--bethink you of your own condition.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy father's calling is mechanical,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut our blood is\nnot so. I have heard my father say that we are descended, at a distance\nindeed, from the great Earls of Dalwolsey.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Footnote: The head of the\nancient and distinguished house of Ramsay, and to whom, as their chief,\nthe individuals of that name look as their origin and source of gentry.\nAllan Ramsay, the pastoral poet, in the same manner, makes\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cDalhousie of an auld descent,\n     My chief, my stoup, my ornament.\u00e2\u0080\u009d]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Ursula; \u00e2\u0080\u009ceven so--I never knew a Scot of you but was\ndescended, as ye call it, from some great house or other; and a piteous\ndescent it often is--and as for the distance you speak of, it is so\ngreat as to put you out of sight of each other. Yet do not toss your\npretty head so scornfully, but tell me the name of this lordly northern\ngallant, and we will try what can be done in the matter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is Lord Glenvarloch, whom they call Lord Nigel Olifaunt,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nMargaret in a low voice, and turning away to hide her blushes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMarry, Heaven forefend!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Dame Suddlechop; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is the very\ndevil, and something worse!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow mean you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the damsel, surprised at the vivacity of her\nexclamation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, know ye not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the dame, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat powerful enemies he has at\nCourt? know ye not--But blisters on my tongue, it runs too fast for my\nwit--enough to say, that you had better make your bridal-bed under a\nfalling house, than think of young Glenvarloch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe IS unfortunate then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew it--I divined it--there\nwas sorrow in his voice when he said even what was gay--there was a\ntouch of misfortune in his melancholy smile--he had not thus clung to my\nthoughts had I seen him in all the mid-day glare of prosperity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRomances have cracked her brain!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Ursula; \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe is a castaway\ngirl--utterly distraught--loves a Scots lord--and likes him the better\nfor being unfortunate! Well, mistress, I am sorry this is a matter I\ncannot aid you in--it goes against my conscience, and it is an affair\nabove my condition, and beyond my management;--but I will keep your\ncounsel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will not be so base as to desert me, after having drawn my secret\nfrom me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret, indignantly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you do, I know how to have my\nrevenge; and if you do not, I will reward you well. Remember the house\nyour husband dwells in is my father's property.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI remember it but too well, Mistress Margaret,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ursula, after\na moment's reflection, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I would serve you in any thing in my\ncondition; but to meddle with such high matters--I shall never forget\npoor Mistress Turner, my honoured patroness, peace be with her!--she had\nthe ill-luck to meddle in the matter of Somerset and Overbury, and so\nthe great earl and his lady slipt their necks out of the collar, and\nleft her and some half-dozen others to suffer in their stead. I shall\nnever forget the sight of her standing on the scaffold with the ruff\nround her pretty neck, all done up with the yellow starch which I had so\noften helped her to make, and that was so soon to give place to a rough\nhempen cord. Such a sight, sweetheart, will make one loath to meddle\nwith matters that are too hot or heavy for their handling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOut, you fool!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Mistress Margaret; \u00e2\u0080\u009cam I one to speak to you\nabout such criminal practices as that wretch died for? All I desire of\nyou is, to get me precise knowledge of what affair brings this young\nnobleman to Court.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd when you have his secret,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ursula, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat will it avail you,\nsweetheart?--and yet I would do your errand, if you could do as much for\nme.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what is it you would have of me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mistress Margaret.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat you have been angry with me for asking before,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Dame\nUrsula. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to have some light about the story of your godfather's\nghost, that is only seen at prayers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot for the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mistress Margaret, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill I be a spy on my kind\ngodfather's secrets--No, Ursula--that I will never pry into, which he\ndesires to keep hidden. But thou knowest that I have a fortune, of my\nown, which must at no distant day come under my own management--think of\nsome other recompense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, that I well know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the counsellor--\u00e2\u0080\u009cit is that two hundred\nper year, with your father's indulgence, that makes you so wilful,\nsweetheart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt may be so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--said Margaret Ramsay; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeanwhile, do you serve me\ntruly, and here is a ring of value in pledge, that when my fortune is in\nmy own hand, I will redeem the token with fifty broad pieces of gold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFifty broad pieces of gold!\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated the dame; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand this ring,\nwhich is a right fair one, in token you fail not of your word!--Well,\nsweetheart, if I must put my throat in peril, I am sure I cannot risk it\nfor a friend more generous than you; and I would not think of more than\nthe pleasure of serving you, only Benjamin gets more idle every day, and\nour family----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSay no more of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe understand each other. And now,\ntell me what you know of this young man's affairs, which made you so\nunwilling to meddle with them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf that I can say no great matter as yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Dame Ursula; \u00e2\u0080\u009conly\nI know, the most powerful among his own countrymen are against him, and\nalso the most powerful at the Court here. But I will learn more of it;\nfor it will be a dim print that I will not read for your sake, pretty\nMistress Margaret. Know you where this gallant dwells?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI heard by accident,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret, as if ashamed of the minute\nparticularity of her memory upon such an occasion,--\u00e2\u0080\u009che lodges,\nI think--at one Christie's--if I mistake not--at Paul's Wharf--a\nship-chandler's.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA proper lodging for a young baron!--Well, but cheer you up, Mistress\nMargaret--If he has come up a caterpillar, like some of his countrymen,\nhe may cast his slough like them, and come out a butterfly.--So I drink\ngood-night, and sweet dreams to you, in another parting cup of sack;\nand you shall hear tidings of me within four-and-twenty hours. And, once\nmore, I commend you to your pillow, my pearl of pearls, and Marguerite\nof Marguerites!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, she kissed the reluctant cheek of her young friend, or\npatroness, and took her departure with the light and stealthy pace of\none accustomed to accommodate her footsteps to the purposes of dispatch\nand secrecy.\n\nMargaret Ramsay looked after her for some time, in anxious silence. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\ndid ill,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she at length murmured, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto let her wring this out of me; but\nshe is artful, bold and serviceable--and I think faithful--or, if not,\nshe will be true at least to her interest, and that I can command. I\nwould I had not spoken, however--I have begun a hopeless work. For what\nhas he said to me, to warrant my meddling in his fortunes?--Nothing but\nwords of the most ordinary import--mere table-talk, and terms of course.\nYet who knows\u00e2\u0080\u009d--she said, and then broke off, looking at the glass the\nwhile, which, as it reflected back a face of great beauty, probably\nsuggested to her mind a more favourable conclusion of the sentence than\nshe cared to trust her tongue withal.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\n  So pitiful a thing is suitor's state!\n  Most miserable man, whom wicked fate\n  Hath brought to Court to sue, for _had I wist_,\n  That few have found, and many a one hath miss'd!\n  Full little knowest thou, that hast not tried,\n  What hell it is, in sueing long to bide:\n  To lose good days that might be better spent;\n  To waste long nights in pensive discontent;\n  To speed to-day, to be put back to-morrow;\n  To feed on hope, to pine with fear and sorrow;\n  To have thy Prince's grace, yet want her Peers';\n  To have thy asking, yet wait many years;\n  To fret thy soul with crosses and with cares--\n  To eat thy heart through comfortless despairs.\n  To fawn, to crouch, to wait, to ride, to run,\n  To spend, to give, to want, to be undone.\n                          _Mother Hubbard's Tale._\n\nOn the morning of the day on which George Heriot had prepared to escort\nthe young Lord of Glenvarloch to the Court at Whitehall, it may be\nreasonably supposed, that the young man, whose fortunes were likely to\ndepend on this cast, felt himself more than usually anxious. He rose\nearly, made his toilette with uncommon care, and, being enabled, by the\ngenerosity of his more plebeian countryman, to set out a very handsome\nperson to the best advantage, he obtained a momentary approbation from\nhimself as he glanced at the mirror, and a loud and distinct plaudit\nfrom his landlady, who declared at once, that, in her judgment, he would\ntake the wind out of the sail of every gallant in the presence--so much\nhad she been able to enrich her discourse with the metaphors of those\nwith whom her husband dealt.\n\nAt the appointed hour, the barge of Master George Heriot arrived,\nhandsomely manned and appointed, having a tilt, with his own cipher, and\nthe arms of his company, painted thereupon.\n\nThe young Lord of Glenvarloch received the friend, who had evinced such\ndisinterested attachment, with the kind courtesy which well became him.\n\nMaster Heriot then made him acquainted with the bounty of his sovereign;\nwhich he paid over to his young friend, declining what he had himself\nformerly advanced to him. Nigel felt all the gratitude which the\ncitizen's disinterested friendship had deserved, and was not wanting in\nexpressing it suitably.\n\nYet, as the young and high-born nobleman embarked to go to the\npresence of his prince, under the patronage of one whose best, or most\ndistinguished qualification, was his being an eminent member of the\nGoldsmiths' Incorporation, he felt a little surprised, if not abashed,\nat his own situation; and Richie Moniplies, as he stepped over\nthe gangway to take his place forward in the boat, could not help\nmuttering,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a changed day betwixt Master Heriot and his honest\nfather in the Kraemes;--but, doubtless, there was a difference between\nclinking on gold and silver, and clattering upon pewter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOn they glided, by the assistance of the oars of four stout watermen,\nalong the Thames, which then served for the principal high-road betwixt\nLondon and Westminster; for few ventured on horseback through the narrow\nand crowded streets of the city, and coaches were then a luxury reserved\nonly for the higher nobility, and to which no citizen, whatever was his\nwealth, presumed to aspire. The beauty of the banks, especially on the\nnorthern side, where the gardens of the nobility descended from their\nhotels, in many places, down to the water's edge, was pointed out to\nNigel by his kind conductor, and was pointed out in vain. The mind of\nthe young Lord of Glenvarloch was filled with anticipations, not the\nmost pleasant, concerning the manner in which he was likely to be\nreceived by that monarch, in whose behalf his family had been nearly\nreduced to ruin; and he was, with the usual mental anxiety of those\nin such a situation, framing imaginary questions from the king, and\nover-toiling his spirit in devising answers to them.\n\nHis conductor saw the labour of Nigel's mind, and avoided increasing it\nby farther conversation; so that, when he had explained to him briefly\nthe ceremonies observed at Court on such occasions of presentation, the\nrest of their voyage was performed in silence.\n\nThey landed at Whitehall Stairs, and entered the Palace after announcing\ntheir names,--the guards paying to Lord Glenvarloch the respect and\nhonours due to his rank.\n\nThe young man's heart beat high and thick within him as he came into the\nroyal apartments. His education abroad, conducted, as it had been, on\na narrow and limited scale, had given him but imperfect ideas of the\ngrandeur of a Court; and the philosophical reflections which taught him\nto set ceremonial and exterior splendour at defiance, proved, like other\nmaxims of mere philosophy, ineffectual, at the moment they were weighed\nagainst the impression naturally made on the mind of an inexperienced\nyouth, by the unusual magnificence of the scene. The splendid apartments\nthrough which they passed, the rich apparel of the grooms, guards, and\n apartments, had something in it, trifling and commonplace as it might\nappear to practised courtiers, embarrassing, and even alarming, to one,\nwho went through these forms for the first time, and who was doubtful\nwhat sort of reception was to accompany his first appearance before his\nsovereign.\n\nHeriot, in anxious attention to save his young friend from any momentary\nawkwardness, had taken care to give the necessary password to the\nwarders, grooms of the chambers, ushers, or by whatever name they were\ndesignated; so they passed on without interruption.\n\nIn this manner they passed several ante-rooms, filled chiefly with\nguards, attendants of the Court, and their acquaintances, male and\nfemale, who, dressed in their best apparel, and with eyes rounded by\neager curiosity to make the most of their opportunity, stood, with\nbeseeming modesty, ranked against the wall, in a manner which indicated\nthat they were spectators, not performers, in the courtly exhibition.\n\nThrough these exterior apartments Lord Glenvarloch and his city friend\nadvanced into a large and splendid withdrawing-room, communicating with\nthe presence-chamber, into which ante-room were admitted those only who,\nfrom birth, their posts in the state or household, or by the particular\ngrant of the kings, had right to attend the Court, as men entitled to\npay their respects to their sovereign.\n\nAmid this favoured and selected company, Nigel observed Sir Mungo\nMalagrowther, who, avoided and discountenanced by those who knew how\nlow he stood in Court interest and favour, was but too happy in the\nopportunity of hooking himself upon a person of Lord Glenvarloch's rank,\nwho was, as yet, so inexperienced as to feel it difficult to shake off\nan intruder.\n\nThe knight forthwith framed his grim features to a ghastly smile, and,\nafter a preliminary and patronising nod to George Heriot, accompanied\nwith an aristocratic wave of the hand, which intimated at once\nsuperiority and protection, he laid aside altogether the honest citizen,\nto whom he owed many a dinner, to attach himself exclusively to the\nyoung lord, although he suspected he might be occasionally in the\npredicament of needing one as much as himself. And even the notice\nof this original, singular and unamiable as he was, was not entirely\nindifferent to Lord Glenvarloch, since the absolute and somewhat\nconstrained silence of his good friend Heriot, which left him at liberty\nto retire painfully to his own agitating reflections, was now relieved;\nwhile, on the other hand, he could not help feeling interest in the\nsharp and sarcastic information poured upon him by an observant, though\ndiscontented courtier, to whom a patient auditor, and he a man of\ntitle and rank, was as much a prize, as his acute and communicative\ndisposition rendered him an entertaining companion to Nigel Olifaunt.\nHeriot, in the meantime, neglected by Sir Mungo, and avoiding every\nattempt by which the grateful politeness of Lord Glenvarloch strove to\nbring him into the conversation, stood by, with a kind of half smile on\nhis countenance; but whether excited by Sir Mungo's wit, or arising at\nhis expense, did not exactly appear.\n\nIn the meantime, the trio occupied a nook of the ante-room, next to\nthe door of the presence-chamber, which was not yet thrown open, when\nMaxwell, with his rod of office, came bustling into the apartment, where\nmost men, excepting those of high rank, made way for him. He stopped\nbeside the party in which we are interested, looked for a moment at\nthe young Scots nobleman, then made a slight obeisance to Heriot, and\nlastly, addressing Sir Mungo Malagrowther, began a hurried complaint\nto him of the misbehaviour of the gentlemen-pensioners and warders, who\nsuffered all sort of citizens, suitors, and scriveners, to sneak into\nthe outer apartments, without either respect or decency.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe English,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwere scandalised, for such a thing durst not be attempted in\nthe queen's days. In her time, there was then the court-yard for the\nmobility, and the apartments for the nobility; and it reflects on your\nplace, Sir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbelonging to the household as you do, that\nsuch things should not be better ordered.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere Sir Mungo, afflicted, as was frequently the case on such occasions,\nwith one of his usual fits of deafness, answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was no wonder\nthe mobility used freedoms, when those whom they saw in office were so\nlittle better in blood and havings than themselves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are right, sir--quite right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Maxwell, putting his hand on the\ntarnished embroidery on the old knight's sleeve,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen such fellows see\nmen in office dressed in cast-off suits, like paltry stage-players, it\nis no wonder the Court is thronged with intruders.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWere you lauding the taste of my embroidery, Maister Maxwell?\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered\nthe knight, who apparently interpreted the deputy-chamberlain's meaning\nrather from his action than his words;--\u00e2\u0080\u009cit is of an ancient and liberal\npattern, having been made by your mother's father, auld James Stitchell,\na master-fashioner of honest repute, in Merlin's Wynd, whom I made\na point to employ, as I am now happy to remember, seeing your father\nthought fit to intermarry with sic a person's daughter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMaxwell looked stern; but, conscious there was nothing to be got of Sir\nMungo in the way of amends, and that prosecuting the quarrel with\nsuch an adversary would only render him ridiculous, and make public\na mis-alliance of which he had no reason to be proud, he covered his\nresentment with a sneer; and, expressing his regret that Sir Mungo was\nbecome too deaf to understand or attend to what was said to him,\nwalked on, and planted himself beside the folding-doors of\nthe presence-chamber, at which he was to perform the duty of\ndeputy-chamberlain, or usher, so soon as they should be opened.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe door of the presence is about to open,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the goldsmith, in a\nwhisper, to his young friend; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy condition permits me to go no farther\nwith you. Fail not to present yourself boldly, according to your birth,\nand offer your Supplication; which the king will not refuse to accept,\nand, as I hope, to consider favourably.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs he spoke, the door of the presence-chamber opened accordingly, and,\nas is usual on such occasions, the courtiers began to advance towards\nit, and to enter in a slow, but continuous and uninterrupted stream.\n\nAs Nigel presented himself in his turn at the entrance, and mentioned\nhis name and title, Maxwell seemed to hesitate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are not known\nto any one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is my duty to suffer no one to pass to the\npresence, my lord, whose face is unknown to me, unless upon the word of\na responsible person.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI came with Master George Heriot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, in some embarrassment at\nthis unexpected interruption.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster Heriot's name will pass current for much gold and silver, my\nlord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Maxwell, with a civil sneer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut not for birth and\nrank. I am compelled by my office to be peremptory.--The entrance is\nimpeded--I am much concerned to say it--your lordship must stand back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said an old Scottish nobleman, who had been\nspeaking with George Heriot, after he had separated from Nigel, and\nwho now came forward, observing the altercation betwixt the latter and\nMaxwell.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is only Master Deputy-Chamberlain Maxwell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Mungo\nMalagrowther, \u00e2\u0080\u009cexpressing his joy to see Lord Glenvarloch at Court,\nwhose father gave him his office--at least I think he is speaking to\nthat purport--for your lordship kens my imperfection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A subdued laugh,\nsuch as the situation permitted, passed round amongst those who heard\nthis specimen of Sir Mungo's sarcastic temper. But the old nobleman\nstepped still more forward, saying,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat!--the son of my gallant\nold opponent, Ochtred Olifaunt--I will introduce him to the presence\nmyself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he took Nigel by the arm, without farther ceremony, and was\nabout to lead him forward, when Maxwell, still keeping his rod across\nthe door, said, but with hesitation and embarrassment--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord, this\ngentleman is not known, and I have orders to be scrupulous.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTutti--taiti, man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old lord, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will be answerable he is his\nfather's son, from the cut of his eyebrow--and thou, Maxwell, knewest\nhis father well enough to have spared thy scruples. Let us pass, man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n So saying, he put aside the deputy-chamberlain's rod, and entered the\npresence-room, still holding the young nobleman by the arm.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, I must know you, man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must know you. I knew your\nfather well, man, and I have broke a lance and crossed a blade with him;\nand it is to my credit that I am living to brag of it. He was king's-man\nand I was queen's-man during the Douglas wars--young fellows both,\nthat feared neither fire nor steel; and we had some old feudal quarrels\nbesides, that had come down from father to son, with our seal-rings,\ntwo-harided broad-swords, and plate-coats, and the crests on our\nburgonets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cToo loud, my Lord of Huntinglen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d whispered a gentleman of the\nchamber,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe King!--the King!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old earl (for such he proved) took the hint, and was silent;\nand James, advancing from a side-door, received in succession the\ncompliments of strangers, while a little group of favourite courtiers,\nor officers of the household, stood around him, to whom he addressed\nhimself from time to time. Some more pains had been bestowed on his\ntoilette than upon the occasion when we first presented the monarch to\nour readers; but there was a natural awkwardness about his figure which\nprevented his clothes from sitting handsomely, and the prudence or\ntimidity of his disposition had made him adopt the custom already\nnoticed, of wearing a dress so thickly quilted as might withstand the\nstroke of a dagger, which added an ungainly stiffness to his whole\nappearance, contrasting oddly with the frivolous, ungraceful, and\nfidgeting motions with which he accompanied his conversation. And yet,\nthough the king's deportment was very undignified, he had a manner so\nkind, familiar, and good-humoured, was so little apt to veil over or\nconceal his own foibles, and had so much indulgence and sympathy for\nthose of others, that his address, joined to his learning, and a\ncertain proportion of shrewd mother-wit, failed not to make a favourable\nimpression on those who approached his person.\n\nWhen the Earl of Huntinglen had presented Nigel to his sovereign, a\nceremony which the good peer took upon himself, the king received the\nyoung lord very graciously, and observed to his introducer, that he\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwas fain to see them twa stand side by side; for I trow, my Lord\nHuntinglen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour ancestors, ay, and e'en your lordship's\nself and this lad's father, have stood front to front at the sword's\npoint, and that is a worse posture.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUntil your Majesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Huntinglen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmade Lord Ochtred and me\ncross palms, upon the memorable day when your Majesty feasted all the\nnobles that were at feud together, and made them join hands in your\npresence--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI mind it weel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI mind it weel--it was a blessed day,\nbeing the nineteen of September, of all days in the year--and it was a\nblithe sport to see how some of the carles girned as they clapped loofs\ntogether. By my saul, I thought some of them, mair special the Hieland\nchiels, wad have broken out in our own presence; but we caused them to\nmarch hand in hand to the Cross, ourselves leading the way, and there\ndrink a blithe cup of kindness with ilk other, to the stanching of feud,\nand perpetuation of amity. Auld John Anderson was Provost that year--the\ncarle grat for joy, and the bailies and councillors danced bare-headed\nin our presence like five-year-auld colts, for very triumph.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was indeed a happy day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Huntinglen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand will not be\nforgotten in the history of your Majesty's reign.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would not that it were, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the monarch--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would not\nthat it were pretermitted in our annals. Ay, ay--BEATI PACIFICI. My\nEnglish lieges here may weel make much of me, for I would have them\nto know, they have gotten the only peaceable man that ever came of my\nfamily. If James with the Fiery Face had come amongst you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,\nlooking round him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor my great grandsire, of Flodden memory!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe should have sent him back to the north again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d whispered one English\nnobleman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt least,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said another, in the same inaudible tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe should have\nhad a MAN to our sovereign, though he were but a Scotsman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now, my young springald,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king to Lord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhere\nhave you been spending your calf-time?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt Leyden, of late, may it please your Majesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lord Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAha! a scholar,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand, by my saul, a modest and\ningenuous youth, that hath not forgotten how to blush, like most of our\ntravelled Monsieurs. We will treat him conformably.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen drawing himself up, coughing slightly, and looking around him with\nthe conscious importance of superior learning, while all the courtiers\nwho understood, or understood not, Latin, pressed eagerly forward to\nlisten, the sapient monarch prosecuted his inquiries as follows:--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHem! hem! _salve bis, quaterque salve, glenvarlochides noster!\nNuperumne ab lugduno batavorum britanniam rediisti?_\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young nobleman replied, bowing low--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Imo, rex augustissime--biennium fere apud lugdunenses Moratus sum._\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJames proceeded--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Biennium dicis? Bene, bene, optume factum est--non uno Die, quod\ndicunt,--intelligisti, domine glenvarlochiensis?_ Aha!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNigel replied by a reverent bow, and the king, turning to those behind\nhim, said--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Adolescens quidem ingenui vultus ingenuique pudoris._\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then resumed\nhis learned queries. \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Et quid hodie lugdunenses loquuntur--vossius\nvester nihilne novi scripsit?--nihil certe, quod doleo, typis recenter\neditit_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Valet quidem vossius, rex benevole._\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009c_ast senex\nveneratissimus annum agit, ni fallor, septuagesimum._\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Virum, mehercle, vix tam grandaevum crediderim_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the\nmonarch. \u00e2\u0080\u009c_et vorstius iste?--arminii improbi successor aeque ac\nsectator--herosne adhuc, ut cum homero loquar_, [ZOOS ESTI KAI EPI THONI\nDERKOV]?\u00e2\u0080\u009d text in Greek\n\nNigel, by good fortune, remembered that Vorstius, the divine last\nmentioned in his Majesty's queries about the state of Dutch literature,\nhad been engaged in a personal controversy with James, in which the\nking had taken so deep an interest, as at length to hint in his public\ncorrespondence with the United States, that they would do well to apply\nthe secular arm to stop the progress of heresy by violent measures\nagainst the Professor's person--a demand which their Mighty\nMightinesses' principles of universal toleration induced them to elude,\nthough with some difficulty. Knowing all this, Lord Glenvarloch, though\na courtier of only five minutes' standing, had address enough to reply--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Vivum quidem, haud diu est, hominem videbam--vigere autem quis dicat\nqui sub fulminibus eloquentiae tuae, rex magne, jamdudum pronus jacet,\net prostratus?_\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[Footnote: Lest any lady or gentleman should suspect there is aught of\nmystery concealed under the sentences printed in Italics, they will be\npleased to understand that they contain only a few commonplace Latin\nphrases, relating to the state of letters in Holland, which neither\ndeserve, nor would endure, a literal translation.]\n\nThis last tribute to his polemical powers completed James's happiness,\nwhich the triumph of exhibiting his erudition had already raised to a\nconsiderable height.\n\nHe rubbed his hands, snapped his fingers, fidgeted, chuckled,\nexclaimed--\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Euge! Belle! Optime!_\u00e2\u0080\u009d and turning to the Bishops of Exeter\nand Oxford, who stood behind him, he said.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe see, my lords, no bad\nspecimen of our Scottish Latinity, with which language we would all our\nsubjects of England were as well embued as this, and other youths of\nhonourable birth, in our auld kingdom; also, we keep the genuine and\nRoman pronunciation, like other learned nations on the continent, sae\nthat we hold communing with any scholar in the universe, who can but\nspeak the Latin tongue; whereas ye, our learned subjects of England,\nhave introduced into your universities, otherwise most learned, a\nfashion of pronouncing like unto the 'nippit foot and clippit foot' of\nthe bride in the fairy tale, whilk manner of speech, (take it not amiss\nthat I be round with you) can be understood by no nation on earth saving\nyourselves; whereby Latin, _quoad anglos_, ceaseth to be _communis\nlingua_, the general dragoman, or interpreter, between all the wise men\nof the earth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Bishop of Exeter bowed, as in acquiescence to the royal censure;\nbut he of Oxford stood upright, as mindful over what subjects his see\nextended, and as being equally willing to become food for fagots in\ndefence of the Latinity of the university, as for any article of his\nreligious creed.\n\nThe king, without awaiting an answer from either prelate, proceeded to\nquestion Lord Nigel, but in the vernacular tongue,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWeel, my likely\nAlumnus of the Muses, and what make you so far from the north?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo pay my homage to your Majesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young nobleman, kneeling on\none knee, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand to lay before you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis my humble and dutiful\nSupplication.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe presenting of a pistol would certainly have startled King James\nmore, but could (setting apart the fright) hardly have been more\nunpleasing to his indolent disposition.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd is it even so, man?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand can no single man, were it but\nfor the rarity of the case, ever come up frae Scotland, excepting EX\nPROPOSITO--on set purpose, to see what he can make out of his loving\nsovereign? It is but three days syne that we had weel nigh lost our\nlife, and put three kingdoms into dule-weeds, from the over haste of a\nclumsy-handed peasant, to thrust a packet into our hand, and now we are\nbeset by the like impediment in our very Court. To our Secretary with\nthat gear, my lord--to our Secretary with that gear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have already offered my humble Supplication to your Majesty's\nSecretary of State,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch--\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it seems----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat he would not receive it, I warrant?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, interrupting\nhim; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbu my saul, our Secretary kens that point of king-craft, called\nrefusing, better than we do, and will look at nothing but what he\nlikes himsell--I think I wad make a better Secretary to him than he to\nme.--Weel, my lord, you are welcome to London; and, as ye seem an acute\nand learned youth, I advise ye to turn your neb northward as soon as ye\nlike, and settle yoursell for a while at Saint Andrews, and we will be\nright glad to hear that you prosper in your studies.--_Incumbite Remis\nFortiter._\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile the king spoke thus, he held the petition of the young lord\ncarelessly, like one who only delayed till the supplicant's back was\nturned, to throw it away, or at least lay it aside to be no more looked\nat. The petitioner, who read this in his cold and indifferent looks, and\nin the manner in which he twisted and crumpled together the paper,\narose with a bitter sense of anger and disappointment, made a profound\nobeisance, and was about to retire hastily. But Lord Huntinglen, who\nstood by him, checked his intention by an almost imperceptible touch\nupon the skirt of his cloak, and Nigel, taking the hint, retreated\nonly a few steps from the royal presence, and then made a pause. In\nthe meantime, Lord Huntinglen kneeled before James, in his turn, and\nsaid--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay it please your Majesty to remember, that upon one certain\noccasion you did promise to grant me a boon every year of your sacred\nlife?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI mind it weel, man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered James, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI mind it weel, and good reason\nwhy--it was when you unclasped the fause traitor Ruthven's fangs\nfrom about our royal throat, and drove your dirk into him like a true\nsubject. We did then, as you remind us, (whilk was unnecessary,) being\npartly beside ourselves with joy at our liberation, promise we would\ngrant you a free boon every year; whilk promise, on our coming\nto menseful possession of our royal faculties, we did confirm,\n_restrictive_ always and _conditionaliter_, that your lordship's demand\nshould be such as we, in our royal discretion, should think reasonable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven so, gracious sovereign,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old earl, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand may I yet\nfarther crave to know if I have ever exceeded the bounds of your royal\nbenevolence?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my word, man, no!'\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot remember you have asked\nmuch for yourself, if it be not a dog or a hawk, or a buck out of our\npark at Theobald's, or such like. But to what serves this preface?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo the boon to which I am now to ask of your Grace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord\nHuntinglen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich is, that your Majesty would be pleased, on the\ninstant, to look at the placet of Lord Glenvarloch, and do upon it\nwhat your own just and royal nature shall think meet and just, without\nreference to your Secretary or any other of your Council.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my saul, my lord, this is strange,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cye are pleading\nfor the son of your enemy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf one who WAS my enemy till your Majesty made him my friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered\nLord Huntinglen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWeel spoken, my lord!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand with, a true Christian\nspirit. And, respecting the Supplication of this young man, I partly\nguess where the matter lies; and in plain troth I had promised to George\nHeriot to be good to the lad--But then, here the shoe pinches. Steenie\nand Babie Charles cannot abide him--neither can your own son, my lord;\nand so, methinks, he had better go down to Scotland before he comes\ntoill luck by them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy son, an it please your Majesty, so far as he is concerned, shall not\ndirect my doings,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the earl, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnor any wild-headed young man of them\nall.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, neither shall they mine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the monarch; \u00e2\u0080\u009cby my father's\nsaul, none of them all shall play Rex with me--I will do what I will,\nand what I ought, like a free king.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Majesty will then grant me my boon?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lord Huntinglen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, marry will I--marry will I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut follow me this\nway, man, where we may be more private.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe led Lord Huntinglen with rather a hurried step through the courtiers,\nall of whom gazed earnestly on this unwonted scene, as is the fashion of\nall Courts on similar occasions. The king passed into a little cabinet,\nand bade, in the first moment, Lord Huntinglen lock or bar the door; but\ncountermanded his direction in the next, saying,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, no--bread o'\nlife, man, I am a free king--will do what I will and what I should--I am\n_justus et tenax propositi_, man--nevertheless, keep by the door, Lord\nHuntinglen, in case Steenie should come in with his mad humour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO my poor master!\u00e2\u0080\u009d groaned the Earl of Huntinglen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you were in\nyour own cold country, you had warmer blood in your veins.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe king hastily looked over the petition or memorial, every now and\nthen glancing his eye towards the door, and then sinking it hastily\non the paper, ashamed that Lord Huntinglen, whom he respected, should\nsuspect him of timidity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo grant the truth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, after he had finished his hasty perusal,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is a hard case; and harder than it was represented to me, though I\nhad some inkling of it before. And so the lad only wants payment of the\nsiller due from us, in order to reclaim his paternal estate? But then,\nHuntinglen, the lad will have other debts--and why burden himsell with\nsae mony acres of barren woodland? let the land gang, man, let the land\ngang; Steenie has the promise of it from our Scottish Chancellor--it is\nthe best hunting-ground in Scotland--and Babie Charles and Steenie want\nto kill a buck there this next year--they maun hae the land--they maun\nhae the land; and our debt shall be paid to the young man plack and\nbawbee, and he may have the spending of it at our Court; or if he has\nsuch an eard hunger, wouns! man, we'll stuff his stomach with English\nland, which is worth twice as much, ay, ten times as much, as these\naccursed hills and heughs, and mosses and muirs, that he is sae keen\nafter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAll this while the poor king ambled up and down the apartment in a\npiteous state of uncertainty, which was made more ridiculous by his\nshambling circular mode of managing his legs, and his ungainly fashion\non such occasions of fiddling with the bunches of ribbons which fastened\nthe lower part of his dress.\n\nLord Huntinglen listened with great composure, and answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAn it\nplease your Majesty, there was an answer yielded by Naboth when\nAhab coveted his vineyard--' The Lord forbid that I should give the\ninheritance of my fathers unto thee.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEy, my lord--ey, my lord!\u00e2\u0080\u009d ejaculated James, while all the colour\nmounted both to his cheek and nose; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope ye mean not to teach me\ndivinity? Ye need not fear, my lord, that I will shun to do justice to\nevery man; and, since your lordship will give me no help to take up\nthis in a more peaceful manner--whilk, methinks, would be better for the\nyoung man, as I said before,--why--since it maun be so--'sdeath, I am\na free king, man, and he shall have his money and redeem his land, and\nmake a kirk and a miln of it, an he will.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he hastily wrote\nan order on the Scottish Exchequer for the sum in question, and then\nadded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow they are to pay it, I see not; but I warrant he will find\nmoney on the order among the goldsmiths, who can find it for every one\nbut me.--And now you see, my Lord of Huntinglen, that I am neither an\nuntrue man, to deny you the boon whilk I became bound for, nor an Ahab,\nto covet Naboth's vineyard; nor a mere nose-of-wax, to be twisted this\nway and that, by favourites and counsellors at their pleasure. I think\nyou will grant now that I am none of those?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are my own native and noble prince,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Huntinglen, as he knelt\nto kiss the royal hand--\u00e2\u0080\u009cjust and generous, whenever you listen to the\nworkings of your own heart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, laughing good-naturedly, as he raised his\nfaithful servant from the ground, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is what ye all say when I do any\nthing to please ye. There--there, take the sign-manual, and away with\nyou and this young fellow. I wonder Steenie and Babie Charles have not\nbroken in on us before now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLord Huntinglen hastened from the cabinet, foreseeing a scene at which\nhe was unwilling to be present, but which sometimes occurred when James\nroused himself so far as to exert his own free will, of which he boasted\nso much, in spite of that of his imperious favourite Steenie, as he\ncalled the Duke of Buckingham, from a supposed resemblance betwixt\nhis very handsome countenance, and that with which the Italian artists\nrepresented the protomartyr Stephen. In fact, the haughty favourite,\nwho had the unusual good fortune to stand as high in the opinion of the\nheir-apparent as of the existing monarch, had considerably diminished in\nhis respect towards the latter; and it was apparent, to the more\nshrewd courtiers, that James endured his domination rather from habit,\ntimidity, and a dread of encountering his stormy passions, than from any\nheartfelt continuation of regard towards him, whose greatness had been\nthe work of his own hands. To save himself the pain of seeing what was\nlikely to take place on the duke's return, and to preserve the king from\nthe additional humiliation which the presence of such a witness must\nhave occasioned, the earl left the cabinet as speedily as possible,\nhaving first carefully pocketed the important sign-manual.\n\nNo sooner had he entered the presence-room, than he hastily sought Lord\nGlenvarloch, who had withdrawn into the embrasure of one of the windows,\nfrom the general gaze of men who seemed disposed only to afford him the\nnotice which arises from surprise and curiosity, and, taking him by\nthe arm, without speaking, led him out of the presence-chamber into the\nfirst ante-room. Here they found the worthy goldsmith, who approached\nthem with looks of curiosity, which were checked by the old lord, who\nsaid hastily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll is well.--Is your barge in waiting?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Heriot answered\nin the affirmative. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Huntinglen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou shall give me a\ncast in it, as the watermen say; and I, in requital, will give you both\nyour dinner; for we must have some conversation together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey both followed the earl without speaking, and were in the second\nante-room when the important annunciation of the ushers, and the hasty\nmurmur with which all made ample way as the company repeated to each\nother,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Duke--the Duke!\u00e2\u0080\u009d made them aware of the approach of the\nomnipotent favourite.\n\nHe entered, that unhappy minion of Court favour, sumptuously dressed\nin the picturesque attire which will live for ever on the canvas of\nVandyke, and which marks so well the proud age, when aristocracy, though\nundermined and nodding to its fall, still, by external show and profuse\nexpense, endeavoured to assert its paramount superiority over the\ninferior orders. The handsome and commanding countenance, stately form,\nand graceful action and manners of the Duke of Buckingham, made him\nbecome that picturesque dress beyond any man of his time. At present,\nhowever, his countenance seemed discomposed, his dress a little\nmore disordered than became the place, his step hasty, and his voice\nimperative.\n\nAll marked the angry spot upon his brow, and bore back so suddenly\nto make way for him, that the Earl of Huntinglen, who affected no\nextraordinary haste on the occasion, with his companions, who could not,\nif they would, have decently left him, remained as it were by themselves\nin the middle of the room, and in the very path of the angry favourite.\nHe touched his cap sternly as he looked on Huntinglen, but unbonneted\nto Heriot, and sunk his beaver, with its shadowy plume, as low as the\nfloor, with a profound air of mock respect. In returning his greeting,\nwhich he did simply and unaffectedly, the citizen only said,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cToo much\ncourtesy, my lord duke, is often the reverse of kindness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI grieve you should think so, Master Heriot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the duke; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nonly meant, by my homage, to claim your protection, sir--your patronage.\nYou are become, I understand, a solicitor of suits--a promoter--an\nundertaker--a fautor of court suitors of merit and quality, who chance\nto be pennyless. I trust your bags will bear you out in your new boast.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey will bear me the farther, my lord duke,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the goldsmith,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat my boast is but small.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, you do yourself less than justice, my good Master Heriot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n continued the duke, in the same tone of irony; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have a marvellous\ncourt-faction, to be the son of an Edinburgh tinker. Have the goodness\nto prefer me to the knowledge of the high-born nobleman who is honoured\nand advantaged by your patronage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat shall be my task,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Huntinglen, with emphasis. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy\nlord duke, I desire you to know Nigel Olifaunt, Lord Glenvarloch,\nrepresentative of one of the most ancient and powerful baronial houses\nin Scotland.--Lord Glenvarloch, I present you to his Grace the Duke of\nBuckingham, representative of Sir George Villiers, Knight of Brookesby,\nin the county of Leicester.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe duke coloured still more high as he bowed to Lord Glenvarloch\nscornfully, a courtesy which the other returned haughtily, and with\nrestrained indignation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe know each other, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the duke, after\na moment's pause; and as if he had seen something in the young nobleman\nwhich merited more serious notice than the bitter raillery with which he\nhad commenced--\u00e2\u0080\u009cwe know each other--and you know me, my lord, for your\nenemy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thank you for your plainness, my lord duke,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009can open\nenemy is better than a hollow friend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor you, my Lord Huntinglen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the duke, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmethinks you have but now\noverstepped the limits of the indulgence permitted to you, as the father\nof the prince's friend, and my own.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my word, my lord duke,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the earl, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is easy for any one\nto outstep boundaries, of the existence of which he was not aware. It is\nneither to secure my protection nor approbation, that my son keeps such\nexalted company.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, my lord, we know you, and indulge you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the duke; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are one\nof those who presume for a life-long upon the merit of one good action.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn faith, my lord, and if it be so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old earl, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have at\nleast the advantage of such as presume more than I do, without having\ndone any action of merit whatever. But I mean not to quarrel with you,\nmy lord--we can neither be friends nor enemies--you have your path, and\nI have mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBuckingham only replied by throwing on his bonnet, and shaking its lofty\nplume with a careless and scornful toss of the head. They parted thus;\nthe duke walking onwards through the apartments, and the others leaving\nthe Palace and repairing to Whitehall Stairs, where they embarked on\nboard the barge of the citizen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\n  Bid not thy fortune troll upon the wheels\n  Of yonder dancing cubes of mottled bone;\n  And drown it not, like Egypt's royal harlot,\n  Dissolving her rich pearl in the brimm'd wine-cup.\n  These are the arts, Lothario, which shrink acres\n  Into brief yards--bring sterling pounds to farthings,\n  Credit to infamy; and the poor gull,\n  Who might have lived an honour'd, easy life,\n  To ruin, and an unregarded grave.\n              _The Changes._\n\nWhen they were fairly embarked on the Thames, the earl took from his\npocket the Supplication, and, pointing out to George Heriot the royal\nwarrant indorsed thereon, asked him, if it were in due and regular form?\nThe worthy citizen hastily read it over, thrust forth his hand as if to\ncongratulate the Lord Glenvarloch, then checked himself, pulled out\nhis barnacles, (a present from old David Ramsay,) and again perused\nthe warrant with the most business-like and critical attention. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\nis strictly correct and formal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, looking to the Earl of\nHuntinglen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I sincerely rejoice at it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI doubt nothing of its formality,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the earl; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe king understands\nbusiness well, and, if he does not practise it often, it is only because\nindolence obscures parts which are naturally well qualified for the\ndischarge of affairs. But what is next to be done for our young friend,\nMaster Heriot? You know how I am circumstanced. Scottish lords living at\nthe English Court have seldom command of money; yet, unless a sum can be\npresently raised on this warrant, matters standing as you hastily\nhinted to me, the mortgage, wadset, or whatever it is called, will be\nforeclosed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot, in some embarrassment; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is a large sum\nwanted in redemption--yet, if it is not raised, there will be an expiry\nof the legal, as our lawyers call it, and the estate will be evicted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy noble--my worthy friends, who have taken up my cause so\nundeservedly, so unexpectedly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo not let me be a burden\non your kindness. You have already done too much where nothing was\nmerited.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPeace, man, peace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Huntinglen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand let old Heriot and I\npuzzle this scent out. He is about to open--hark to him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the citizen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Duke of Buckingham sneers at our city\nmoney-bags; yet they can sometimes open, to prop a falling and a noble\nhouse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe know they can,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Huntinglen--\u00e2\u0080\u009cmind not Buckingham, he is a\nPeg-a-Ramsay--and now for the remedy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI partly hinted to Lord Glenvarloch already,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the\nredemption money might be advanced upon such a warrant as the present,\nand I will engage my credit that it can. But then, in order to secure\nthe lender, he must come in the shoes of the creditor to whom he\nadvances payment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome in his shoes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the earl; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy, what have boots or shoes to\ndo with this matter, my good friend?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a law phrase, my lord. My experience has made me pick up a few of\nthem,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, and of better things along with them, Master George,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Lord\nHuntinglen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut what means it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSimply this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed the citizen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the lender of this money will\ntransact with the holder of the mortgage, or wadset, over the estate of\nGlenvarloch, and obtain from him such a conveyance to his right as\nshall leave the lands pledged for the debt, in case the warrant upon\nthe Scottish Exchequer should prove unproductive. I fear, in this\nuncertainty of public credit, that without some such counter security,\nit will be very difficult to find so large a sum.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHo la!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Earl of Huntinglen, \u00e2\u0080\u009chalt there! a thought\nstrikes me.--What if the new creditor should admire the estate as a\nhunting-field, as much as my Lord Grace of Buckingham seems to do, and\nshould wish to kill a buck there in the summer season? It seems to\nme, that on your plan, Master George, our new friend will be as well\nentitled to block Lord Glenvarloch out of his inheritance as the present\nholder of the mortgage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe citizen laughed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will engage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the keenest\nsportsman to whom I may apply on this occasion, shall not have a\nthought beyond the Lord Mayor's Easter-Hunt, in Epping Forest. But your\nlordship's caution is reasonable. The creditor must be bound to allow\nLord Glenvarloch sufficient time to redeem his estate by means of\nthe royal warrant, and must wave in his favour the right of instant\nforeclosure, which may be, I should think, the more easily managed, as\nthe right of redemption must be exercised in his own name.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut where shall we find a person in London fit to draw the necessary\nwritings?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the earl. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf my old friend Sir John Skene of Halyards\nhad lived, we should have had his advice; but time presses, and--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009can orphan lad, a scrivener, that dwells by\nTemple Bar; he can draw deeds both after the English and Scottish\nfashion, and I have trusted him often in matters of weight and of\nimportance. I will send one of my serving-men for him, and the mutual\ndeeds may be executed in your lordship's presence; for, as things stand,\nthere should be no delay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His lordship readily assented; and, as they\nnow landed upon the private stairs leading down to the river from the\ngardens of the handsome hotel which he inhabited, the messenger was\ndispatched without loss of time.\n\nNigel, who had sat almost stupefied while these zealous friends\nvolunteered for him in arranging the measures by which his fortune was\nto be disembarrassed, now made another eager attempt to force upon\nthem his broken expressions of thanks and gratitude. But he was again\nsilenced by Lord Huntinglen, who declared he would not hear a word on\nthat topic, and proposed instead, that they should take a turn in the\npleached alley, or sit upon the stone bench which overlooked the Thames,\nuntil his son's arrival should give the signal for dinner.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI desire to introduce Dalgarno and Lord Glenvarloch to each other,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas two who will be near neighbours, and I trust will be more kind\nones than their fathers were formerly. There is but three Scots miles\nbetwixt the castles, and the turrets of the one are visible from the\nbattlements of the other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old earl was silent for a moment, and appeared to muse upon the\nrecollections which the vicinity of the castles had summoned up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoes Lord Dalgarno follow the Court to Newmarket next week?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nHeriot, by way of removing the conversation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe proposes so, I think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lord Huntinglen, relapsed into\nhis reverie for a minute or two, and then addressed Nigel somewhat\nabruptly--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy young friend, when you attain possession of your inheritance, as I\nhope you soon will, I trust you will not add one to the idle followers\nof the Court, but reside on your patrimonial estate, cherish your\nancient tenants, relieve and assist your poor kinsmen, protect the poor\nagainst subaltern oppression, and do what our fathers used to do, with\nfewer lights and with less means than we have.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd yet the advice to keep the country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccomes from an\nancient and constant ornament of the Court.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom an old courtier, indeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the earl, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand the first of my\nfamily that could so write himself--my grey beard falls on a cambric\nruff and a silken doublet--my father's descended upon a buff coat and\na breast-plate. I would not that those days of battle returned; but I\nshould love well to make the oaks of my old forest of Dalgarno ring once\nmore with halloo, and horn, and hound, and to have the old stone-arched\nhall return the hearty shout of my vassals and tenants, as the bicker\nand the quaigh walked their rounds amongst them. I should like to see\nthe broad Tay once more before I die--not even the Thames can match it,\nin my mind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSurely, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the citizen, \u00e2\u0080\u009call this might be easily done--it\ncosts but a moment's resolution, and the journey of some brief days, and\nyou will be where you desire to be--what is there to prevent you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHabits, Master George, habits,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the earl, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich to young men\nare like threads of silk, so lightly are they worn, so soon broken; but\nwhich hang on our old limbs as if time had stiffened them into gyves of\niron. To go to Scotland for a brief space were but labour in vain; and\nwhen I think of abiding there, I cannot bring myself to leave my old\nmaster, to whom I fancy myself sometimes useful, and whose weal and\nwoe I have shared for so many years. But Dalgarno shall be a Scottish\nnoble.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHas he visited the North?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was there last year and made such a report of the country, that the\nprince has expressed a longing to see it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLord Dalgarno is in high grace with his Highness and the Duke of\nBuckingham?\u00e2\u0080\u009d observed the goldsmith.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the earl,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI pray it may be for the advantage of\nthem all. The prince is just and equitable in his sentiments, though\ncold and stately in his manners, and very obstinate in his most trifling\npurposes; and the duke, noble and gallant, and generous and open, is\nfiery, ambitious, and impetuous. Dalgarno has none of these faults,\nand such as he may have of his own, may perchance be corrected by the\nsociety in which he moves.--See, here he comes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLord Dalgarno accordingly advanced from the farther end of the alley to\nthe bench on which his father and his guests were seated, so that Nigel\nhad full leisure to peruse his countenance and figure. He was dressed\npoint-device, and almost to extremity, in the splendid fashion of the\ntime, which suited well with his age, probably about five-and-twenty,\nwith a noble form and fine countenance, in which last could easily be\ntraced the manly features of his father, but softened by a more\nhabitual air of assiduous courtesy than the stubborn old earl had ever\ncondescended to assume towards the world in general. In other respects,\nhis address was gallant, free, and unencumbered either by pride or\nceremony--far remote certainly from the charge either of haughty\ncoldness or forward impetuosity; and so far his father had justly freed\nhim from the marked faults which he ascribed to the manners of the\nprince and his favourite Buckingham.\n\nWhile the old earl presented his young acquaintance Lord Glenvarloch to\nhis son, as one whom he would have him love and honour, Nigel marked the\ncountenance of Lord Dalgarno closely, to see if he could detect aught\nof that secret dislike which the king had, in one of his broken\nexpostulations, seemed to intimate, as arising from a clashing of\ninterests betwixt his new friend and the great Buckingham. But nothing\nof this was visible; on the contrary, Lord Dalgarno received his new\nacquaintance with the open frankness and courtesy which makes conquest\nat once, when addressed to the feelings of an ingenuous young man.\n\nIt need hardly be told that his open and friendly address met equally\nready and cheerful acceptation from Nigel Olifaunt. For many months, and\nwhile a youth not much above two-and-twenty, he had been restrained by\ncircumstances from the conversation of his equals. When, on his father's\nsudden death, he left the Low Countries for Scotland, he had found\nhimself involved, to all appearance inextricably, with the details\nof the law, all of which threatened to end in the alienation of the\npatrimony which should support his hereditary rank. His term of sincere\nmourning, joined to injured pride, and the swelling of the heart under\nunexpected and undeserved misfortune, together with the uncertainty\nattending the issue of his affairs, had induced the young Lord of\nGlenvarloch to live, while in Scotland, in a very private and reserved\nmanner. How he had passed his time in London, the reader is acquainted\nwith. But this melancholy and secluded course of life was neither\nagreeable to his age nor to his temper, which was genial and sociable.\nHe hailed, therefore, with sincere pleasure, the approaches which a\nyoung man of his own age and rank made towards him; and when he had\nexchanged with Lord Dalgarno some of those words and signals by which,\nas surely as by those of freemasonry, young people recognise a mutual\nwish to be agreeable to each other, it seemed as if the two noblemen had\nbeen acquainted for some time.\n\nJust as this tacit intercourse had been established, one of Lord\nHuntinglen's attendants came down the alley, marshalling onwards a\nman dressed in black buckram, who followed him with tolerable speed,\nconsidering that, according to his sense of reverence and propriety, he\nkept his body bent and parallel to the horizon from the moment that he\ncame in sight of the company to which he was about to be presented.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho is this, you cuckoldy knave,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old lord, who had retained\nthe keen appetite and impatience of a Scottish baron even during a long\nalienation from his native country; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand why does John Cook, with a\nmurrain to him, keep back dinner?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe we are ourselves responsible for this person's intrusion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said George Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is the scrivener whom we desired to see.--Look\nup, man, and see us in the face as an honest man should, instead of\nbeating thy noddle charged against us thus, like a battering-ram.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe scrivener did look up accordingly, with the action of an automaton\nwhich suddenly obeys the impulse of a pressed spring. But, strange to\ntell, not even the haste he had made to attend his patron's mandate,\na business, as Master Heriot's message expressed, of weight and\nimportance--nay not even the state of depression in which, out of sheer\nhumility, doubtless, he had his head stooped to the earth, from the\nmoment he had trod the demesnes of the Earl of Huntinglen, had called\nany colour into his countenance. The drops stood on his brow from haste\nand toil, but his cheek was still pale and tallow-coloured as before;\nnay, what seemed stranger, his very hair, when he raised his head, hung\ndown on either cheek as straight and sleek and undisturbed as it was\nwhen we first introduced him to our readers, seated at his quiet and\nhumble desk.\n\nLord Dalgarno could not forbear a stifled laugh at the ridiculous and\npuritanical figure which presented itself like a starved anatomy to the\ncompany, and whispered at the same time into Lord Glenvarloch's ear--\n\n     \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon,\n      Where got'st thou that goose-look?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNigel was too little acquainted with the English stage to understand a\nquotation which had already grown matter of common allusion in London.\nLord Dalgarno saw that he was not understood, and continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\nfellow, by his visage, should either be a saint, or a most hypocritical\nrogue--and such is my excellent opinion of human nature, that I always\nsuspect the worst. But they seem deep in business. Will you take a\nturn with me in the garden, my lord, or will you remain a member of the\nserious conclave?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith you, my lord, most willingly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel; and they were turning\naway accordingly, when George Heriot, with the formality belonging\nto his station, observed, that, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas their business concerned Lord\nGlenvarloch, he had better remain, to make himself master of it, and\nwitness to it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy presence is utterly needless, my good lord;-and, my best friend,\nMaster Heriot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young nobleman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall understand nothing\nthe better for cumbering you with my ignorance in these matters; and can\nonly say at the end, as I now say at the beginning, that I dare not take\nthe helm out of the hand of the kind pilots who have already guided\nmy course within sight of a fair and unhoped-for haven. Whatever you\nrecommend to me as fitting, I shall sign and seal; and the import of the\ndeeds I shall better learn by a brief explanation from Master Heriot, if\nhe will bestow so much trouble in my behalf, than by a thousand learned\nwords and law terms from this person of skill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Huntinglen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cour young friend is right, in\nconfiding these matters to you and me, Master George Heriot--he has not\nmisplaced his confidence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMaster George Heriot cast a long look after the two young noblemen, who\nhad now walked down the alley arm-in-arm, and at length said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe hath\nnot, indeed, misplaced his confidence, as your lordship well and truly\nsays--but, nevertheless, he is not in the right path; for it behoves\nevery man to become acquainted with his own affairs, so soon as he hath\nany that are worth attending to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen he had made this observation, they applied themselves, with the\nscrivener, to look into various papers, and to direct in what manner\nwritings should be drawn, which might at once afford sufficient security\nto those who were to advance the money, and at the same time preserve\nthe right of the young nobleman to redeem the family estate, provided he\nshould obtain the means of doing so, by the expected reimbursement from\nthe Scottish Exchequer, or otherwise. It is needless to enter into those\ndetails. But it is not unimportant to mention, as an illustration of\ncharacter, that Heriot went into the most minute legal details with a\nprecision which showed that experience had made him master even of the\nintricacies of Scottish conveyancing; and that the Earl of Huntinglen,\nthough far less acquainted with technical detail, suffered no step of\nthe business to pass over, until he had attained a general but distinct\nidea of its import and its propriety.\n\nThey seemed to be admirably seconded in their benevolent intentions\ntowards the young Lord Glenvarloch, by the skill and eager zeal of the\nscrivener, whom Heriot had introduced to this piece of business, the\nmost important which Andrew had ever transacted in his life, and the\nparticulars of which were moreover agitated in his presence between an\nactual earl, and one whose wealth and character might entitle him to be\nan alderman of his ward, if not to be lord mayor, in his turn.\n\nWhile they were thus in eager conversation on business, the good earl\neven forgetting the calls of his appetite, and the delay of dinner, in\nhis anxiety to see that the scrivener received proper instructions, and\nthat all was rightly weighed and considered, before dismissing him to\nengross the necessary deeds, the two young men walked together on the\nterrace which overhung the river, and talked on the topics which Lord\nDalgarno, the elder, and the more experienced, thought most likely to\ninterest his new friend.\n\nThese naturally regarded the pleasures attending a Court life; and Lord\nDalgarno expressed much surprise at understanding that Nigel proposed an\ninstant return to Scotland.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are jesting with me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll the Court rings--it is needless\nto mince it--with the extraordinary success of your suit--against the\nhighest interest, it is said, now influencing the horizon at Whitehall.\nMen think of you--talk of you--fix their eyes on you--ask each other,\nwho is this young Scottish lord, who has stepped so far in a single day?\nThey augur, in whispers to each other, how high and how far you may push\nyour fortune--and all that you design to make of it, is, to return to\nScotland, eat raw oatmeal cakes, baked upon a peat-fire, have your hand\nshaken by every loon of a blue-bonnet who chooses to dub you cousin,\nthough your relationship comes by Noah; drink Scots twopenny ale,\neat half-starved red-deer venison, when you can kill it, ride upon a\ngalloway, and be called my right honourable and maist worthy lord!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no great gaiety in the prospect before me, I confess,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nLord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009ceven if your father and good Master Heriot should\nsucceed in putting my affairs on some footing of plausible hope. And yet\nI trust to do something for my vassals as my ancestors before me, and to\nteach my children, as I have myself been taught, to make some personal\nsacrifices, if they be necessary, in order to maintain with dignity the\nsituation in which they are placed by Providence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLord Dalgarno, after having once or twice stifled his laughter during\nthis speech, at length broke out into a fit of mirth, so hearty and\nso resistless, that, angry as he was, the call of sympathy swept Nigel\nalong with him, and despite of himself, he could not forbear to join\nin a burst of laughter, which he thought not only causeless, but almost\nimpertinent.\n\nHe soon recollected himself, however, and said, in a tone qualified to\nallay Lord Dalgarno's extreme mirth: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is all well, my lord; but how\nam I to understand your merriment?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lord Dalgarno only answered him with\nredoubled peals of laughter, and at length held by Lord Glenvarloch's\ncloak, as if to prevent his falling down on the ground, in the extremity\nof his convulsion.\n\nAt length, while Nigel stood half abashed, half angry, at becoming thus\nthe subject of his new acquaintance's ridicule, and was only restrained\nfrom expressing his resentment against the son, by a sense of the\nobligations he owed the father, Lord Dalgarno recovered himself, and\nspoke in a half-broken voice, his eyes still running with tears: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\ncrave your pardon, my dear Lord Glenvarloch--ten thousand times do I\ncrave your pardon. But that last picture of rural dignity, accompanied\nby your grave and angry surprise at my laughing at what would have made\nany court-bred hound laugh, that had but so much as bayed the moon once\nfrom the court-yard at Whitehall, totally overcame me. Why, my liefest\nand dearest lord, you, a young and handsome fellow, with high birth, a\ntitle, and the name of an estate, so well received by the king at your\nfirst starting, as makes your further progress scarce matter of doubt,\nif you know how to improve it--for the king has already said you are a\n'braw lad, and well studied in the more humane letters'--you, too, whom\nall the women, and the very marked beauties of the Court, desire to see,\nbecause you came from Leyden, were born in Scotland, and have gained a\nhard-contested suit in England--you, I say, with a person like a prince,\nan eye of fire, and a wit as quick, to think of throwing your cards on\nthe table when the game is in your very hand, running back to the\nfrozen north, and marrying--let me see--a tall, stalking, blue-eyed,\nfair-skinned bony wench, with eighteen quarters in her scutcheon, a sort\nof Lot's wife, newly descended from her pedestal, and with her to shut\nyourself up in your tapestried chamber! Uh, gad!--Swouns, I shall never\nsurvive the idea!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt is seldom that youth, however high-minded, is able, from mere\nstrength of character and principle, to support itself against the force\nof ridicule. Half angry, half mortified, and, to say truth, half ashamed\nof his more manly and better purpose, Nigel was unable, and flattered\nhimself it was unnecessary, to play the part of a rigid moral patriot,\nin presence of a young man whose current fluency of language, as well as\nhis experience in the highest circles of society, gave him, in spite of\nNigel's better and firmer thoughts, a temporary ascendency over him. He\nsought, therefore, to compromise the matter, and avoid farther debate,\nby frankly owning, that, if to return to his own country were not his\nchoice, it was at least a matter of necessity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis affairs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwere unsettled, his income precarious.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd where is he whose affairs are settled, or whose income is less than\nprecarious, that is to be found in attendance on the Court?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord\nDalgarno; \u00e2\u0080\u009call are either losing or winning. Those who have wealth, come\nhither to get rid of it, while the happy gallants, who, like you and I,\ndear Glenvarloch, have little or none, have every chance to be sharers\nin their spoils.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no ambition of that sort,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand if I had, I must\ntell you plainly, Lord Dalgarno, I have not the means to do so. I can\nscarce as yet call the suit I wear my own; I owe it, and I do riot blush\nto say so, to the friendship of yonder good man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not laugh again, if I can help it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, Lord! that you should have gone to a wealthy goldsmith for your\nhabit--why, I could have brought you to an honest, confiding tailor,\nwho should have furnished you with half-a-dozen, merely for love of the\nlittle word, 'lordship,' which you place before your name;--and then\nyour goldsmith, if he be really a friendly goldsmith, should have\nequipped you with such a purse of fair rose-nobles as would have bought\nyou thrice as many suits, or done better things for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not understand these fashions, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, his\ndispleasure mastering his shame; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwere I to attend the Court of my\nsovereign, it should be when I could maintain, without shifting or\nborrowing, the dress and retinue which my rank requires.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhich my rank requires!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno, repeating his last words;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat, now, is as good as if my father had spoke it. I fancy you\nwould love to move to Court with him, followed by a round score of\nold blue-bottles, with white heads and red noses, with bucklers and\nbroadswords, which their hands, trembling betwixt age and strong waters,\ncan make no use of--as many huge silver badges on their arms, to\nshow whose fools they are, as would furnish forth a court cupboard of\nplate--rogues fit for nothing but to fill our ante-chambers with the\nflavour of onions and genievre--pah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe poor knaves!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey have served your father,\nit may be, in the wars. What would become of them were he to turn them\noff?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, let them go to the hospital,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dalgarno, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor to the\nbridge-end, to sell switches. The king is a better man than my father,\nand you see those who have served in HIS wars do so every day; or, when\ntheir blue coats were well worn out, they would make rare scarecrows.\nHere is a fellow, now, comes down the walk; the stoutest raven dared\nnot come within a yard of that copper nose. I tell you, there is more\nservice, as you will soon see, in my valet of the chamber, and such\na lither lad as my page Lutin, than there is in a score of these old\nmemorials of the Douglas wars, [Footnote: The cruel civil wars waged by\nthe Scottish barons during the minority of James VI., had the name from\nthe figure made in them by the celebrated James Douglas, Earl of Morton.\nBoth sides executed their prisoners without mercy or favour.] where they\ncut each other's throats for the chance of finding twelve pennies Scots\non the person of the slain. Marry, my lord, to make amends, they will\neat mouldy victuals, and drink stale ale, as if their bellies were\npuncheons.--But the dinner-bell is going to sound--hark, it is clearing\nits rusty throat, with a preliminary jowl. That is another clamorous\nrelic of antiquity, that, were I master, should soon be at the bottom\nof the Thames. How the foul fiend can it interest the peasants and\nmechanics in the Strand, to know that the Earl of Huntinglen is sitting\ndown to dinner? But my father looks our way--we must not be late for the\ngrace, or we shall be in DIS-grace, if you will forgive a quibble which\nwould have made his Majesty laugh. You will find us all of a piece, and,\nhaving been accustomed to eat in saucers abroad, I am ashamed you should\nwitness our larded capons, our mountains of beef, and oceans of brewis,\nas large as Highland hills and lochs; but you shall see better cheer\nto-morrow. Where lodge you? I will call for you. I must be your guide\nthrough the peopled desert, to certain enchanted lands, which you will\nscarce discover without chart and pilot. Where lodge you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will meet you in Paul's,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, a good deal embarrassed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cat\nany hour you please to name.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, you would be private,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young lord; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnay, fear not me--I\nwill be no intruder. But we have attained this huge larder of flesh,\nfowl, and fish. I marvel the oaken boards groan not under it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey had indeed arrived in the dining-parlour of the mansion, where the\ntable was superabundantly loaded, and where the number of attendants,\nto a certain extent, vindicated the sarcasms of the young nobleman.\nThe chaplain, and Sir Mungo Malagrowther, were of the party. The latter\ncomplimented Lord Glenvarloch upon the impression he had made at Court.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne would have thought ye had brought the apple of discord in your\npouch, my lord, or that you were the very firebrand of whilk Althea was\ndelivered, and that she had lain-in in a barrel of gunpowder, for the\nking, and the prince, and the duke, have been by the lugs about ye, and\nso have many more, that kendna before this blessed day that there was\nsuch a man living on the face of the earth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMind your victuals, Sir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the earl; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey get cold while\nyou talk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTroth, and that needsna, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the knight; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour lordship's\ndinners seldom scald one's mouth--the serving-men are turning auld, like\noursells, my lord, and it is far between the kitchen and the ha'.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith this little explosion of his spleen, Sir Mungo remained satisfied,\nuntil the dishes were removed, when, fixing his eyes on the brave new\ndoublet of Lord Dalgarno, he complimented him on his economy, pretending\nto recognise it as the same which his father had worn in Edinburgh in\nthe Spanish ambassador's time. Lord Dalgarno, too much a man of the\nworld to be moved by any thing from such a quarter, proceeded to crack\nsome nuts with great deliberation, as he replied, that the doublet was\nin some sort his father's, as it was likely to cost him fifty pounds\nsome day soon. Sir Mungo forthwith proceeded in his own way to convey\nthis agreeable intelligence to the earl, observing, that his son was a\nbetter maker of bargains than his lordship, for he had bought a doublet\nas rich as that his lordship wore when the Spanish ambassador was at\nHolyrood, and it had cost him but fifty pounds Scots;--\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat was no\nfool's bargain, my lord.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPounds sterling, if you please, Sir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the earl, calmly;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand a fool's bargain it is, in all the tenses. Dalgarno WAS a fool when\nhe bought--I _will_ be a fool when I pay--and you, Sir Mungo, craving\nyour pardon, _are_ a fool _in praesenti_, for speaking of what concerns\nyou not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, the earl addressed himself to the serious business of the\ntable and sent the wine around with a profusion which increased the\nhilarity, but rather threatened the temperance, of the company, until\ntheir joviality was interrupted by the annunciation that the scrivener\nhad engrossed such deeds as required to be presently executed.\n\nGeorge Heriot rose from the table, observing, that wine-cups and legal\ndocuments were unseemly neighbours. The earl asked the scrivener if they\nhad laid a trencher and set a cup for him in the buttery and received\nthe respectful answer, that heaven forbid he should be such an\nungracious beast as to eat or drink until his lordship's pleasure was\nperformed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou shalt eat before thou goest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Huntinglen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I will\nhave thee try, moreover, whether a cup of sack cannot bring some colour\ninto these cheeks of thine. It were a shame to my household, thou\nshouldst glide out into the Strand after such a spectre-fashion as\nthou now wearest--Look to it, Dalgarno, for the honour of our roof is\nconcerned.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLord Dalgarno gave directions that the man should be attended to. Lord\nGlenvarloch and the citizen, in the meanwhile, signed and interchanged,\nand thus closed a transaction, of which the principal party concerned\nunderstood little, save that it was under the management of a zealous\nand faithful friend, who undertook that the money should be forthcoming,\nand the estate released from forfeiture, by payment of the stipulated\nsum for which it stood pledged, and that at the term of Lambmas, and at\nthe hour of noon, and beside the tomb of the Regent Earl of Murray,\nin the High Kirk of Saint Giles, at Edinburgh, being the day and place\nassigned for such redemption. [Footnote: As each covenant in those days\nof accuracy had a special place nominated for execution, the tomb of the\nRegent Earl of Murray in Saint Giles's Church was frequently assigned\nfor the purpose.]\n\nWhen this business was transacted, the old earl would fain have renewed\nhis carouse; but the citizen, alleging the importance of the deeds he\nhad about him, and the business he had to transact betimes the next\nmorning, not only refused to return to table, but carried with him to\nhis barge Lord Glenvarloch, who might, perhaps, have been otherwise\nfound more tractable.\n\nWhen they were seated in the boat, and fairly once more afloat on the\nriver, George Heriot looked back seriously on the mansion they had\nleft--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere live,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe old fashion and the new. The father\nis like a noble old broadsword, but harmed with rust, from neglect and\ninactivity; the son is your modern rapier, well-mounted, fairly gilt,\nand fashioned to the taste of the time--and it is time must evince if\nthe metal be as good as the show. God grant it prove so, says an old\nfriend to the family.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNothing of consequence passed betwixt them, until Lord Glenvarloch,\nlanding at Paul's Wharf, took leave of his friend the citizen, and\nretired to his own apartment, where his attendant, Richie, not a little\nelevated with the events of the day, and with the hospitality of Lord\nHuntinglen's house-keeping, gave a most splendid account of them to\nthe buxom Dame Nelly, who rejoiced to hear that the sun at length was\nshining upon what Richie called \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe right side of the hedge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\n  You are not for the manner nor the times,\n  They have their vices now most like to virtues;\n  You cannot know them apait by any difference,\n  They wear the same clothes, eat the same meat--\n  Sleep i' the self-same beds, ride in those coaches,\n  Or very like four horses in a coach,\n  As the best men and women.\n                            _Ben Jonson_\n\nOn the following morning, while Nigel, his breakfast finished, was\nthinking how he should employ the day, there was a little bustle upon\nthe stairs which attracted his attention, and presently entered Dame\nNelly, blushing like scarlet, and scarce able to bring out--\u00e2\u0080\u009cA young\nnobleman, sir--no one less,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, drawing her hand slightly over\nher lips, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould be so saucy--a young nobleman, sir, to wait on you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd she was followed into the little cabin by Lord Dalgarno, gay,\neasy, disembarrassed, and apparently as much pleased to rejoin his\nnew acquaintance as if he had found him in the apartments of a palace.\nNigel, on the contrary, (for youth is slave to such circumstances,)\nwas discountenanced and mortified at being surprised by so splendid a\ngallant in a chamber which, at the moment the elegant and high-dressed\ncavalier appeared in it, seemed to its inhabitant, yet lower, narrower,\ndarker, and meaner than it had ever shown before. He would have made\nsome apology for the situation, but Lord Dalgarno cut him short--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a word of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot a single word--I know why you ride at\nanchor here--but I can keep counsel--so pretty a hostess would recommend\nworse quarters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn my word--on my honour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, nay, make no words of the matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am no\ntell-tale, nor shall I cross your walk; there is game enough in the\nforest, thank Heaven, and I can strike a doe for myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAll this he said in so significant a manner, and the explanation\nwhich he had adopted seemed to put Lord Glenvarloch's gallantry on so\nrespectable a footing, that Nigel ceased to try to undeceive him; and\nless ashamed, perhaps, (for such is human weakness,) of supposed vice\nthan of real poverty, changed the discourse to something else, and\nleft poor Dame Nelly's reputation and his own at the mercy of the young\ncourtier's misconstruction.\n\nHe offered refreshments with some hesitation. Lord Dalgarno had long\nsince breakfasted, but had just come from playing a set of tennis, he\nsaid, and would willingly taste a cup of the pretty hostess's single\nbeer. This was easily procured, was drunk, was commended, and, as the\nhostess failed not to bring the cup herself, Lord Dalgarno profited by\nthe opportunity to take a second and more attentive view of her, and\nthen gravely drank to her husband's health, with an almost imperceptible\nnod to Lord Glenvarloch. Dame Nelly was much honoured, smoothed her\napron down with her hands, and said\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHer John was greatly and truly honoured by their lordships--he was a\nkind painstaking man for his family, as was in the alley, or indeed, as\nfar north as Paul's Chain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe would have proceeded probably to state the difference betwixt their\nages, as the only alloy to their nuptial happiness; but her lodger, who\nhad no mind to be farther exposed to his gay friend's raillery, gave\nher, contrary to his wont, a signal to leave the room.\n\nLord Dalgarno looked after her, and then looked at Glenvarloch, shook\nhis head, and repeated the well-known lines--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c'My lord, beware of jealousy--It is the green-eyed monster which doth\nmake the meat it feeds on.'\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut come,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, changing his tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know not why I should worry\nyou thus--I who have so many follies of my own, when I should rather\nmake excuse for being here at all, and tell you wherefore I came.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he reached a seat, and, placing another for Lord Glenvarloch,\nin spite of his anxious haste to anticipate this act of courtesy, he\nproceeded in the same tone of easy familiarity:--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are neighbours, my lord, and are just made known to each other.\nNow, I know enough of the dear North, to be well aware that Scottish\nneighbours must be either dear friends or deadly enemies--must either\nwalk hand-in-hand, or stand sword-point to sword-point; so I choose the\nhand-in-hand, unless you should reject my proffer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow were it possible, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto refuse what\nis offered so frankly, even if your father had not been a second father\nto me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--And, as he took Lord Dalgarno's hand, he added--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have, I\nthink, lost no time, since, during one day's attendance at Court, I have\nmade a kind friend and a powerful enemy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe friend thanks you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Lord Dalgarno, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor your just opinion;\nbut, my dear Glenvarloch--or rather, for titles are too formal between\nus of the better file--what is your Christian name?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNigel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Lord Glenvarloch.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen we will be Nigel and Malcolm to each other,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his visitor,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand my lord to the plebeian world around us. But I was about to ask you\nwhom you suppose your enemy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo less than the all-powerful favourite, the great Duke of Buckingham.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou dream! What could possess you with such an opinion?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dalgarno.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe told me so himself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Glenvarloch; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand, in so doing, dealt\nfrankly and honourably with me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, you know him not yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his companion; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe duke is moulded of\nan hundred noble and fiery qualities, that prompt him, like a generous\nhorse, to spring aside in impatience at the least obstacle to his\nforward course. But he means not what he says in such passing heats--I\ncan do more with him, I thank Heaven, than most who are around him; you\nshall go visit him with me, and you will see how you shall be received.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI told you, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Glenvarloch firmly, and with some\nhaughtiness, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Duke of Buckingham, without the least offence,\ndeclared himself my enemy in the face of the Court; and he shall\nretract that aggression as publicly as it was given, ere I will make the\nslightest advance towards him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou would act becomingly in every other case,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut here you are wrong. In the Court horizon Buckingham is Lord of\nthe Ascendant, and as he is adverse or favouring, so sinks or rises the\nfortune of a suitor. The king would bid you remember your Phaedrus,\n\n     'Arripiens geminas, ripis cedentibus, ollas--'\n\nand so forth. You are the vase of earth; beware of knocking yourself\nagainst the vase of iron.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe vase of earth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill avoid the encounter, by\ngetting ashore out of the current--I mean to go no more to Court.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, to Court you necessarily must go; you will find your Scottish suit\nmove ill without it, for there is both patronage and favour necessary\nto enforce the sign-manual you have obtained. Of that we will speak more\nhereafter; but tell me in the meanwhile, my dear Nigel, whether you did\nnot wonder to see me here so early?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am surprised that you could find me out in this obscure corner,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nLord Glenvarloch.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy page Lutin is a very devil for that sort of discovery,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied\nLord Dalgarno; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have but to say, 'Goblin, I would know where he or she\ndwells,' and he guides me thither as if by art magic.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope he waits not now in the street, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will\nsend my servant to seek him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not concern yourself--he is by this time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cplaying at hustle-cap and chuck-farthing with the most blackguard imps\nupon the wharf, unless he hath foregone his old customs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you not afraid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat in such company his\nmorals may become depraved?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet his company look to their own,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lord Dalgarno, cooly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor\nit will be a company of real fiends in which Lutin cannot teach more\nmischief than he can learn: he is, I thank the gods, most thoroughly\nversed in evil for his years. I am spared the trouble of looking after\nhis moralities, for nothing can make them either better or worse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wonder you can answer this to his parents, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wonder where I should find his parents,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied his companion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto\nrender an account to them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe may be an orphan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut surely, being a page in\nyour lordship's family, his parents must be of rank.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf as high rank as the gallows could exalt them to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Lord\nDalgarno, with the same indifference; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey were both hanged, I\nbelieve--at least the gipsies, from whom I bought him five years ago,\nintimated as much to me.--You are surprised at this, now. But is it not\nbetter that, instead of a lazy, conceited, whey-faced slip of gentility,\nto whom, in your old-world idea of the matter, I was bound to stand Sir\nPedagogue, and see that he washed his hands and face, said his prayers,\nlearned his acddens, spoke no naughty words, brushed his hat, and\nwore his best doublet only on Sunday,--that, instead of such a Jacky\nGoodchild, I should have something like this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe whistled shrill and clear, and the page he spoke of darted into the\nroom, almost with the effect of an actual apparition. From his height he\nseemed but fifteen, but, from his face, might be two or even three years\nolder, very neatly made, and richly dressed; with a thin bronzed visage,\nwhich marked his gipsy descent, and a pair of sparkling black eyes,\nwhich seemed almost to pierce through those whom he looked at.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere he is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfit for every element--prompt to\nexecute every command, good, bad, or indifferent--unmatched in his\ntribe, as rogue, thief, and liar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll which qualities,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the undaunted page, \u00e2\u0080\u009chave each in turn stood\nyour lordship in stead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOut, you imp of Satan!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his master; \u00e2\u0080\u009cvanish-begone-or my conjuring\nrod goes about your ears.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The boy turned, and disappeared as suddenly\nas he had entered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat, in choosing my\nhousehold, the best regard I can pay to gentle blood is to exclude it\nfrom my service--that very gallows--bird were enough to corrupt a\nwhole antechamber of pages, though they were descended from kings and\nkaisers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can scarce think that a nobleman should need the offices of such\nan attendant as your goblin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are but jesting with my\ninexperience.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTime will show whether I jest or not, my dear Nigel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Dalgarno;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cin the meantime, I have to propose to you to take the advantage of the\nflood-tide, to run up the river for pastime; and at noon I trust you\nwill dine with me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNigel acquiesced in a plan which promised so much amusement; and his new\nfriend and he, attended by Lutin and Moniplies, who greatly resembled,\nwhen thus associated, the conjunction of a bear and a monkey, took\npossession of Lord Dalgarno's wherry, which, with its badged watermen,\nbearing his lordship's crest on their arms, lay in readiness to receive\nthem. The air was delightful upon the river; and the lively conversation\nof Lord Dalgarno added zest to the pleasures of the little voyage.\nHe could not only give an account of the various public buildings and\nnoblemen's houses which they passed in ascending the Thames, but knew\nhow to season his information with abundance of anecdote, political\ninnuendo, and personal scandal; if he had not very much wit, he was at\nleast completely master of the fashionable tone, which in that time, as\nin ours, more than amply supplies any deficiency of the kind.\n\nIt was a style of conversation entirely new to his companion, as was the\nworld which Lord Dalgarno opened to his observation; and it is no wonder\nthat Nigel, notwithstanding his natural good sense and high spirit,\nadmitted, more readily than seemed consistent with either, the tone\nof authoritative instruction which his new friend assumed towards him.\nThere would, indeed, have been some difficulty in making a stand. To\nattempt a high and stubborn tone of morality, in answer to the light\nstrain of Lord Dalgarno's conversation, which kept on the frontiers\nbetween jest and earnest, would have seemed pedantic and ridiculous; and\nevery attempt which Nigel made to combat his companion's propositions,\nby reasoning as jocose as his own, only showed his inferiority in\nthat gay species of controversy. And it must be owned, besides, though\ninternally disapproving much of what he heard, Lord Glenvarloch, young\nas he was in society, became less alarmed by the language and manners of\nhis new associate, than in prudence he ought to have been.\n\nLord Dalgarno was unwilling to startle his proselyte, by insisting\nupon any topic which appeared particularly to jar with his habits or\nprinciples; and he blended his mirth and his earnest so dexterously,\nthat it was impossible for Nigel to discover how far he was serious in\nhis propositions, or how far they flowed from a wild and extravagant\nspirit of raillery. And, ever and anon, those flashes of spirit and\nhonour crossed his conversation, which seemed to intimate, that, when\nstirred to action by some adequate motive, Lord Dalgarno would prove\nsomething very different from the court-haunting and ease-loving\nvoluptuary, which he was pleased to represent as his chosen character.\n\nAs they returned down the river, Lord Glenvarloch remarked, that the\nboat passed the mansion of Lord Huntinglen, and noticed the circumstance\nto Lord Dalgarno, observing, that he thought they were to have dined\nthere. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSurely no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young nobleman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have more mercy on you\nthan to gorge you a second time with raw beef and canary wine. I propose\nsomething better for you, I promise you, than such a second Scythian\nfestivity. And as for my father, he proposes to dine to-day with my\ngrave, ancient Earl of Northampton, whilome that celebrated putter-down\nof pretended prophecies, Lord Henry Howard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd do you not go with him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his companion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo what purpose?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo hear his wise lordship speak\nmusty politics in false Latin, which the old fox always uses, that he\nmay give the learned Majesty of England an opportunity of correcting his\nslips in grammar? That were a rare employment!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut out of respect, to wait on my lord your\nfather.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord my father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Lord Dalgarno, \u00e2\u0080\u009chas blue-bottles enough to\nwait on him, and can well dispense with such a butterfly as myself. He\ncan lift the cup of sack to his head without my assistance; and, should\nthe said paternal head turn something giddy, there be men enough to\nguide his right honourable lordship to his lordship's right honourable\ncouch.--Now, do not stare at me, Nigel, as if my words were to sink the\nboat with us. I love my father--I love him dearly--and I respect him,\ntoo, though I respect not many things; a trustier old Trojan never\nbelted a broadsword by a loop of leather. But what then? He belongs to\nthe old world, I to the new. He has his follies, I have mine; and the\nless either of us sees of the other's peccadilloes, the greater will be\nthe honour and respect--that, I think, is the proper phrase--I say the\n_respect_ in which we shall hold each other. Being apart, each of us is\nhimself, such as nature and circumstances have made him; but, couple us\nup too closely together, you will be sure to have in your leash either\nan old hypocrite or a young one, or perhaps both the one and t'other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs he spoke thus, the boat put into the landing-place at Blackfriars.\nLord Dalgarno sprung ashore, and, flinging his cloak and rapier to his\npage, recommended to his companion to do the like. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are coming among\na press of gallants,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand, if we walked thus muffled, we shall\nlook like your tawny-visaged Don, who wraps him close in his cloak, to\nconceal the defects of his doublet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have known many an honest man do that, if it please your lordship,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said Richie Moniplies, who had been watching for an opportunity to\nintrude himself on the conversation, and probably remembered what had\nbeen his own condition, in respect to cloak and doublet, at a very\nrecent period.\n\nLord Dalgarno stared at him, as if surprised at his assurance; but\nimmediately answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may have known many things, friend; but, in\nthe meanwhile, you do not know what principally concerns your master,\nnamely, how to carry his cloak, so as to show to advantage the\ngold-laced seams, and the lining of sables. See how Lutin holds the\nsword, with his cloak cast partly over it, yet so as to set off the\nembossed hilt, and the silver work of the mounting.--Give your familiar\nyour sword, Nigel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, addressing Lord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat he\nmay practise a lesson in an art so necessary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it altogether prudent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, unclasping his weapon, and\ngiving it to Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto walk entirely unarmed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd wherefore not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his companion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are thinking now of Auld\nReekie, as my father fondly calls your good Scottish capital, where\nthere is such bandying of private feuds and public factions, that a man\nof any note shall not cross your High Street twice, without endangering\nhis life thrice. Here, sir, no brawling in the street is permitted. Your\nbull-headed citizen takes up the case so soon as the sword is drawn, and\nclubs is the word.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd a hard word it is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas my brain-pan kens at this\nblessed moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWere I your master, sirrah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would make your\nbrain-pan, as you call it, boil over, were you to speak a word in my\npresence before you were spoken to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRichie murmured some indistinct answer, but took the hint, and ranked\nhimself behind his master along with Lutin, who failed not to expose his\nnew companion to the ridicule of the passers-by, by mimicking, as often\nas he could do so unobserved by Richie, his stiff and upright stalking\ngait and discontented physiognomy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd tell me now, my dear Malcolm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhere we are bending\nour course, and whether we shall dine at an apartment of yours?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAn apartment of mine--yes, surely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lord Dalgarno, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou shall\ndine at an apartment of mine, and an apartment of yours, and of twenty\ngallants besides; and where the board shall present better cheer, better\nwine, and better attendance, than if our whole united exhibitions went\nto maintain it. We are going to the most noted ordinary of London.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is, in common language, an inn, or a tavern,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAn inn, or a tavern, my most green and simple friend!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Lord\nDalgarno. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no--these are places where greasy citizens take pipe\nand pot, where the knavish pettifoggers of the law spunge on their most\nunhappy victims--where Templars crack jests as empty as their nuts, and\nwhere small gentry imbibe such thin potations, that they get dropsies\ninstead of getting drunk. An ordinary is a late-invented institution,\nsacred to Bacchus and Comus, where the choicest noble gallants of the\ntime meet with the first and most ethereal wits of the age,--where the\nwine is the very soul of the choicest grape, refined as the genius of\nthe poet, and ancient and generous as the blood of the nobles. And then\nthe fare is something beyond your ordinary gross terrestrial food! Sea\nand land are ransacked to supply it; and the invention of six ingenious\ncooks kept eternally upon the rack to make their art hold pace with, and\nif possible enhance, the exquisite quality of the materials.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy all which rhapsody,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can only understand,\nas I did before, that we are going to a choice tavern, where we shall be\nhandsomely entertained, on paying probably as handsome a reckoning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReckoning!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Lord Dalgarno in the same tone as before,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cperish the peasantly phrase! What profanation! Monsieur le Chevalier de\nBeaujeu, pink of Paris and flower of Gascony--he who can tell the age of\nhis wine by the bare smell, who distils his sauces in an alembic by the\naid of Lully's philosophy--who carves with such exquisite precision,\nthat he gives to noble, knight and squire, the portion of the pheasant\nwhich exactly accords with his rank--nay, he who shall divide a becafico\ninto twelve parts with such scrupulous exactness, that of twelve guests\nnot one shall have the advantage of the other in a hair's breadth, or\nthe twentieth part of a drachm, yet you talk of him and of a reckoning\nin the same breath! Why, man, he is the well-known and general referee\nin all matters affecting the mysteries of Passage, Hazard, In and\nIn, Penneeck, and Verquire, and what not--why, Beaujeu is King of\nthe Card-pack, and Duke of the Dice-box--HE call a reckoning like a\ngreen-aproned, red-nosed son of the vulgar spigot! O, my dearest Nigel,\nwhat a word you have spoken, and of what a person! That you know him\nnot, is your only apology for such blasphemy; and yet I scarce hold it\nadequate, for to have been a day in London and not to know Beaujeu, is a\ncrime of its own kind. But you _shall_ know him this blessed moment,\nand shall learn to hold yourself in horror for the enormities you have\nuttered.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, but mark you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis worthy chevalier keeps not all\nthis good cheer at his own cost, does he?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lord Dalgarno; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is a sort of ceremony which my\nchevalier's friends and intimates understand, but with which you have no\nbusiness at present. There is, as majesty might say, a _symbolum_ to be\ndisbursed--in other words, a mutual exchange of courtesies take place\nbetwixt Beaujeu and his guests. He makes them a free present of the\ndinner and wine, as often as they choose to consult their own felicity\nby frequenting his house at the hour of noon, and they, in gratitude,\nmake the chevalier a present of a Jacobus. Then you must know, that,\nbesides Comus and Bacchus, that princess of sublunary affairs, the Diva\nFortuna, is frequently worshipped at Beaujeu's, and he, as officiating\nhigh-priest, hath, as in reason he should, a considerable advantage from\na share of the sacrifice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn other words,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis man keeps a\ngaming-house.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA house in which you may certainly game,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas you\nmay in your own chamber if you have a mind; nay, I remember old Tom\nTally played a hand at put for a wager with Quinze le Va, the Frenchman,\nduring morning prayers in St. Paul's; the morning was misty, and the\nparson drowsy, and the whole audience consisted of themselves and a\nblind woman, and so they escaped detection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor all this, Malcolm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young lord, gravely, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot dine\nwith you to-day, at this same ordinary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd wherefore, in the name of heaven, should you draw back from your\nword?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not retract my word, Malcolm; but I am bound, by an early promise\nto my father, never to enter the doors of a gaming-house.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell you this is none,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is but, in plain\nterms, an eating-house, arranged on civiller terms, and frequented by\nbetter company, than others in this town; and if some of them do amuse\nthemselves with cards and hazard, they are men of honour, and who play\nas such, and for no more than they can well afford to lose. It was not,\nand could not be, such houses that your father desired you to avoid.\nBesides, he might as well have made you swear you would never take\naccommodation of an inn, tavern, eating-house, or place of public\nreception of any kind; for there is no such place of public resort but\nwhere your eyes may be contaminated by the sight of a pack of pieces of\npainted pasteboard, and your ears profaned by the rattle of those little\nspotted cubes of ivory. The difference is, that where we go, we may\nhappen to see persons of quality amusing themselves with a game; and in\nthe ordinary houses you will meet bullies and sharpers, who will strive\neither to cheat or to swagger you out of your money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sure you would not willingly lead me to do what is wrong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nNigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut my father had a horror for games of chance, religious\nI believe, as well as prudential. He judged from I know not what\ncircumstance, a fallacious one I should hope, that I should have a\npropensity to such courses, and I have told you the promise which he\nexacted from me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, by my honour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dalgarno, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat you have said affords the\nstrongest reason for my insisting that you go with me. A man who would\nshun any danger, should first become acquainted with its real bearing\nand extent, and that in the company of a confidential guide and guard.\nDo you think I myself game? Good faith, my father's oaks grow too far\nfrom London, and stand too fast rooted in the rocks of Perthshire, for\nme to troll them down with a die, though I have seen whole forests go\ndown like nine-pins. No, no--these are sports for the wealthy Southron,\nnot for the poor Scottish noble. The place is an eating-house, and as\nsuch you and I will use it. If others use it to game in, it is their\nfault, but neither that of the house nor ours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nUnsatisfied with this reasoning, Nigel still insisted upon the promise\nhe had given to his father, until his companion appeared rather\ndispleased, and disposed to impute to him injurious and unhandsome\nsuspicions. Lord Glenvarloch could not stand this change of tone. He\nrecollected that much was due from him to Lord Dalgarno, on account\nof his father's ready and efficient friendship, and something also on\naccount of the frank manner in which the young man himself had offered\nhim his intimacy. He had no reason to doubt his assurances, that the\nhouse where they were about to dine did not fall under the description\nof places which his father's prohibition referred; and finally, he was\nstrong in his own resolution to resist every temptation to join in\ngames of chance. He therefore pacified Lord Dalgarno, by intimating\nhis willingness to go along with him; and, the good-humour of the young\ncourtier instantaneously returning, he again ran on in a grotesque and\nrodomontade account of the host, Monsieur de Beaujeu, which he did not\nconclude until they had reached the temple of hospitality over which\nthat eminent professor presided.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\n    ----This is the very barn-yard,\n    Where muster daily the prime cocks o' the game,\n    Ruffle their pinions, crow till they are hoarse,\n    And spar about a barleycorn. Here too chickens,\n    The callow, unfledged brood of forward folly,\n    Learn first to rear the crest, and aim the spur,\n    And tune their note like full-plumed Chanticleer.\n                                        _The Bear-Garden._\n\nThe Ordinary, now an ignoble sound, was in the days of James, a\nnew institution, as fashionable among the youth of that age as the\nfirst-rate modern club-houses are amongst those of the present day.\nIt differed chiefly, in being open to all whom good clothes and good\nassurance combined to introduce there. The company usually dined\ntogether at an hour fixed, and the manager of the establishment presided\nas master of the ceremonies.\n\nMonsieur le Chevalier, (as he qualified himself,) Saint Priest de\nBeaujeu, was a sharp, thin Gascon, about sixty years old, banished from\nhis own country, as he said, on account of an affair of honour, in which\nhe had the misfortune to kill his antagonist, though the best swordsman\nin the south of France. His pretensions to quality were supported by\na feathered hat, a long rapier, and a suit of embroidered taffeta, not\nmuch the worse for wear, in the extreme fashion of the Parisian court,\nand fluttering like a Maypole with many knots of ribbon, of which it\nwas computed he bore at least five hundred yards about his person.\nBut, notwithstanding this profusion of decoration, there were many who\nthought Monsieur le Chevalier so admirably calculated for his present\nsituation, that nature could never have meant to place him an inch\nabove it. It was, however, part of the amusement of the place, for Lord\nDalgarno and other young men of quality to treat Monsieur de Beaujeu\nwith a great deal of mock ceremony, which being observed by the herd of\nmore ordinary and simple gulls, they paid him, in clumsy imitation, much\nreal deference. The Gascon's natural forwardness being much enhanced by\nthese circumstances, he was often guilty of presuming beyond the limits\nof his situation, and of course had sometimes the mortification to be\ndisagreeably driven back into them.\n\nWhen Nigel entered the mansion of this eminent person, which had been\nbut of late the residence of a great Baron of Queen Elizabeth's court,\nwho had retired to his manors in the country on the death of that\nprincess, he was surprised at the extent of the accommodation which it\nafforded, and the number of guests who were already assembled. Feathers\nwaved, spurs jingled, lace and embroidery glanced everywhere; and at\nfirst sight, at least, it certainly made good Lord Dalgarno's encomium,\nwho represented the company as composed almost entirely of youth of the\nfirst quality. A more close review was not quite so favourable. Several\nindividuals might be discovered who were not exactly at their ease\nin the splendid dresses which they wore, and who, therefore, might be\nsupposed not habitually familiar with such finery. Again, there were\nothers, whose dress, though on a general view it did not seem inferior\nto that of the rest of the company, displayed, on being observed more\nclosely, some of these petty expedients, by which vanity endeavours to\ndisguise poverty.\n\nNigel had very little time to make such observations, for the entrance\nof Lord Dalgarno created an immediate bustle and sensation among the\ncompany, as his name passed from one mouth to another. Some stood\nforward to gaze, others stood back to make way--those of his own rank\nhastened to welcome him--those of inferior degree endeavoured to catch\nsome point of his gesture, or of his dress, to be worn and practised\nupon a future occasion, as the newest and most authentic fashion.\n\nThe _genius loci_, the Chevalier himself, was not the last to welcome\nthis prime stay and ornament of his establishment. He came shuffling\nforward with a hundred apish _conges_ and _chers milors_, to express his\nhappiness at seeing Lord Dalgarno again.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope you do bring back the\nsun with you, _Milor_--You did carry away the sun and moon from your\npauvre Chevalier when you leave him for so long. Pardieu, I believe you\ntake them away in your pockets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat must have been because you left me nothing else in them,\nChevalier,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lord Dalgarno; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut Monsieur le Chevalier, I pray\nyou to know my countryman and friend, Lord Glenvarloch!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, ha! tres honore--Je m'en souviens,--oui. J'ai connu autrefois un\nMilor Kenfarloque en Ecosse. Yes, I have memory of him--le pere de milor\napparemment-we were vera intimate when I was at Oly Root with Monsieur\nde la Motte--I did often play at tennis vit Milor Kenfarloque at\nL'Abbaie d'Oly Root--il etoit meme plus fort que moi--Ah le beaucoup\nde revers qu'il avoit!--I have memory, too that he was among the pretty\ngirls--ah, un vrai diable dechaine--Aha! I have memory--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBetter have no more memory of the late Lord Glenvarloch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord\nDalgarno, interrupting the Chevalier without ceremony; who perceived\nthat the encomium which he was about to pass on the deceased was likely\nto be as disagreeable to the son as it was totally undeserved by the\nfather, who, far from being either a gamester or libertine, as the\nChevalier's reminiscences falsely represented him, was, on the contrary,\nstrict and severe in his course of life, almost to the extent of rigour.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have the reason, milor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Chevalier, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have the\nright--Qu'est ce que nous avons a faire avec le temps passe?--the time\npassed did belong to our fathers--our ancetres--very well--the time\npresent is to us--they have their pretty tombs with their memories and\narmorials, all in brass and marbre--we have the petits plats exquis, and\nthe soupe-a-Chevalier, which I will cause to mount up immediately.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he made a pirouette on his heel, and put his attendants in\nmotion to place dinner on the table. Dalgarno laughed, and, observing\nhis young friend looked grave, said to him, in a tone of reproach--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy,\nwhat!--you are not gull enough to be angry with such an ass as that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI keep my anger, I trust, for better purposes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I confess I was moved to hear such a fellow mention my father's\nname--and you, too, who told me this was no gaming-house, talked to him\nof having left it with emptied pockets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPshaw, man!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI spoke but according to the trick of\nthe time; besides, a man must set a piece or two sometimes, or he would\nbe held a cullionly niggard. But here comes dinner, and we will\nsee whether you like the Chevalier's good cheer better than his\nconversation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDinner was announced accordingly, and the two friends, being seated in\nthe most honourable station at the board, were ceremoniously attended\nto by the Chevalier, who did the honours of his table to them and to the\nother guests, and seasoned the whole with his agreeable conversation.\nThe dinner was really excellent, in that piquant style of cookery which\nthe French had already introduced, and which the home-bred young men of\nEngland, when they aspired to the rank of connoisseurs and persons of\ntaste, were under the necessity of admiring. The wine was also of the\nfirst quality, and circulated in great variety, and no less abundance.\nThe conversation among so many young men was, of course, light, lively,\nand amusing; and Nigel, whose mind had been long depressed by anxiety\nand misfortune, naturally found himself at ease, and his spirits raised\nand animated.\n\nSome of the company had real wit, and could use it both politely and to\nadvantage; others were coxcombs, and were laughed at without discovering\nit; and, again, others were originals, who seemed to have no objection\nthat the company should be amused with their folly instead of their\nwit. And almost all the rest who played any prominent part in the\nconversation had either the real tone of good society which belonged to\nthe period, or the jargon which often passes current for it.\n\nIn short, the company and conversation was so agreeable, that Nigel's\nrigour was softened by it, even towards the master of ceremonies, and\nhe listened with patience to various details which the Chevalier de\nBeaujeu, seeing, as he said, that Milor's taste lay for the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccurieux\nand Futile,\u00e2\u0080\u009d chose to address to him in particular, on the subject of\ncookery. To gratify, at the same time, the taste for antiquity, which\nhe somehow supposed that his new guest possessed, he launched out in\ncommendation of the great artists of former days, particularly one\nwhom he had known in his youth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaitre de Cuisine to the Marechal\nStrozzi--tres bon gentilhomme pourtant;\u00e2\u0080\u009d who had maintained his master's\ntable with twelve covers every day during the long and severe blockade\nof le petit Leyth, although he had nothing better to place on it than\nthe quarter of a carrion-horse now and then, and the grass and weeds\nthat grew on the ramparts. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDespardieux c'dtoit un homme superbe!\u00e2\u0080\u009d With\none tistle-head, and a nettle or two, he could make a soupe for twenty\nguests--an haunch of a little puppy-dog made a roti des plus excellens;\nbut his coupe de maitre was when the rendition--what you call the\nsurrender, took place and appened; and then, dieu me damme, he made out\nof the hind quarter of one salted horse, forty-five couverts; that the\nEnglish and Scottish officers and nobility, who had the honour to dine\nwith Monseigneur upon the rendition, could not tell what the devil any\nof them were made upon at all.\n\nThe good wine had by this time gone so merrily round, and had such\ngenial effect on the guests, that those of the lower end of the table,\nwho had hitherto been listeners, began, not greatly to their own credit,\nor that of the ordinary, to make innovations.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou speak of the siege of Leith,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a tall, raw-boned man, with\nthick mustaches turned up with a military twist, a broad buff belt, a\nlong rapier, and other outward symbols of the honoured profession, which\nlives by killing other people--\u00e2\u0080\u009cyou talk of the siege of Leith, and I\nhave seen the place--a pretty kind of a hamlet it is, with a plain wall,\nor rampart, and a pigeon-house or so of a tower at every angle. Uds\ndaggers and scabbards, if a leaguer of our days had been twenty-four\nhours, not to say so many months, before it, without carrying the place\nand all its cocklofts, one after another, by pure storm, they would have\ndeserved no better grace than the Provost-Marshal gives when his noose\nis reeved.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSaar,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Chevalier, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMonsieur le Capitaine, I vas not at\nthe siege of the petit Leyth, and I know not what you say about the\ncockloft; but I will say for Monseigneur de Strozzi, that he understood\nthe grande guerre, and was grand capitaine--plus grand--that is more\ngreat, it may be, than some of the capitaines of Angleterre, who do\nspeak very loud--tenez, Monsieur, car c'est a vous!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO Monsieur.\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the swordsman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe know the Frenchman will fight\nwell behind his barrier of stone, or when he is armed with back, breast,\nand pot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPot!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the Chevalier, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat do you mean by pot--do you mean to\ninsult me among my noble guests? Saar, I have done my duty as a pauvre\ngentilhomme under the Grand Henri Quatre, both at Courtrai and Yvry,\nand, ventre saint gris! we had neither pot nor marmite, but did always\ncharge in our shirt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhich refutes another base scandal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno, laughing,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009calleging that linen was scarce among the French gentlemen-at-arms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGentlemen out at arms and elbows both, you mean, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\ncaptain, from the bottom of the table. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCraving your lordship's pardon,\nI do know something of these same gens-d'armes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will spare your knowledge at present, captain, and save your modesty\nat the same time the trouble of telling us how that knowledge was\nacquired,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lord Dalgarno, rather contemptuously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI need not speak of it, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the man of war; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe world knows\nit--all perhaps, but the men of mohair--the poor sneaking citizens of\nLondon, who would see a man of valour eat his very hilts for hunger, ere\nthey would draw a farthing from their long purses to relieve them. O,\nif a band of the honest fellows I have seen were once to come near that\ncuckoo's nest of theirs!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA cuckoo's nest!-and that said of the city of London!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a gallant\nwho sat on the opposite side of the table, and who, wearing a splendid\nand fashionable dress, seemed yet scarce at home in it--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not\nbrook to hear that repeated.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the soldier, bending a most terrific frown from a pair of\nbroad black eyebrows, handling the hilt of his weapon with one hand, and\ntwirling with the other his huge mustaches; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill you quarrel for your\ncity?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, marry will I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the other. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a citizen, I care not who\nknows it; and he who shall speak a word in dispraise of the city, is an\nass and a peremptory gull, and I will break his pate, to teach him sense\nand manners.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe company, who probably had their reasons for not valuing the\ncaptain's courage at the high rate which he himself put upon it, were\nmuch entertained at the manner in which the quarrel was taken up by\nthe indignant citizen; and they exclaimed on all sides, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell run,\nBow-bell!\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell crowed, the cock of Saint Paul's!\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSound a charge\nthere, or the soldier will mistake his signals, and retreat when he\nshould advance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mistake me, gentlemen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the captain, looking round with an\nair of dignity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will but inquire whether this cavaliero citizen is\nof rank and degree fitted to measure swords with a man of action; (for,\nconceive me, gentlemen, it is not with every one that I can match myself\nwithout loss of reputation;) and in that case he shall soon hear from me\nhonourably, by way of cartel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall feel me most dishonourably in the way of cudgel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\ncitizen, starting up, and taking his sword, which he had laid in a\ncorner. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFollow me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is my right to name the place of combat, by all the rules of\nthe sword,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the captain; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I do nominate the Maze, in\nTothill-Fields, for place--two gentlemen, who shall be indifferent\njudges, for witnesses;--and for time--let me say this day fortnight, at\ndaybreak.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the citizen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo nominate the bowling-alley behind the\nhouse for place, the present good company for witnesses, and for time\nthe present moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he cast on his beaver, struck the soldier across the\nshoulders with his sheathed sword, and ran down stairs. The captain\nshowed no instant alacrity to follow him; yet, at last, roused by the\nlaugh and sneer around him, he assured the company, that what he did he\nwould do deliberately, and, assuming his hat, which he put on with the\nair of Ancient Pistol, he descended the stairs to the place of combat,\nwhere his more prompt adversary was already stationed, with his sword\nunsheathed. Of the company, all of whom seemed highly delighted with\nthe approaching fray, some ran to the windows which overlooked the\nbowling-alley, and others followed the combatants down stairs. Nigel\ncould not help asking Dalgarno whether he would not interfere to prevent\nmischief.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would be a crime against the public interest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered his friend;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthere can no mischief happen between two such originals, which will not\nbe a positive benefit to society, and particularly to the Chevalier's\nestablishment, as he calls it. I have been as sick of that captain's\nbuff belt, and red doublet, for this month past, as e'er I was of aught;\nand now I hope this bold linendraper will cudgel the ass out of that\nfilthy lion's hide. See, Nigel, see the gallant citizen has ta'en his\nground about a bowl's-cast forward, in the midst of the alley--the very\nmodel of a hog in armour. Behold how he prances with his manly foot, and\nbrandishes his blade, much as if he were about to measure forth cambric\nwith it. See, they bring on the reluctant soldado, and plant him\nopposite to his fiery antagonist, twelve paces still dividing them--Lo,\nthe captain draws his tool, but, like a good general, looks over his\nshoulder to secure his retreat, in case the worse come on't. Behold the\nvaliant shop-keeper stoops his head, confident, doubtless, in the civic\nhelmet with which his spouse has fortified his skull--Why, this is the\nrarest of sport. By Heaven, he will run a tilt at him, like a ram.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was even as Lord Dalgarno had anticipated; for the citizen, who\nseemed quite serious in his zeal for combat, perceiving that the man\nof war did not advance towards him, rushed onwards with as much good\nfortune as courage, beat down the captain's guard, and, pressing\non, thrust, as it seemed, his sword clear through the body of his\nantagonist, who, with a deep groan, measured his length on the ground.\nA score of voices cried to the conqueror, as he stood fixed in\nastonishment at his own feat, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAway, away with you!--fly, fly--fly by\nthe back door!--get into the Whitefriars, or cross the water to the\nBankside, while we keep off the mob and the constables.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And\nthe conqueror, leaving his vanquished foeman on the ground, fled\naccordingly, with all speed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy Heaven,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could never have believed that\nthe fellow would have stood to receive a thrust--he has certainly been\narrested by positive terror, and lost the use of his limbs. See, they\nare raising him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nStiff and stark seemed the corpse of the swordsman, as one or two of\nthe guests raised him from the ground; but, when they began to open his\nwaistcoat to search for the wound which nowhere existed, the man of war\ncollected, his scattered spirits; and, conscious that the ordinary was\nno longer a stage on which to display his valour, took to his heels as\nfast as he could run, pursued by the laughter and shouts of the company.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my honour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno, \u00e2\u0080\u009che takes the same course with his\nconqueror. I trust in heaven he will overtake him, and then the valiant\ncitizen will suppose himself haunted by the ghost of him he has slain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDespardieux, milor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Chevalier, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif he had stayed one moment,\nhe should have had a _torchon_--what you call a dishclout, pinned to him\nfor a piece of shroud, to show he be de ghost of one grand fanfaron.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the meanwhile,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou will oblige us, Monsieur le\nChevalier, as well as maintain your own honoured reputation, by letting\nyour drawers receive the man-at-arms with a cudgel, in case he should\nventure to come way again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVentre saint gris, milor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Chevalier, \u00e2\u0080\u009cleave that to\nme.--Begar, the maid shall throw the wash-sud upon the grand poltron!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen they had laughed sufficiently at this ludicrous occurrence, the\nparty began to divide themselves into little knots--some took possession\nof the alley, late the scene of combat, and put the field to its proper\nuse of a bowling-ground, and it soon resounded with all the terms of the\ngame, as \u00e2\u0080\u009crun, run-rub, rub--hold bias, you infernal trundling timber!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n thus making good the saying, that three things are thrown away in a\nbowling-green, namely, time, money, and oaths. In the house, many of the\ngentlemen betook themselves to cards or dice, and parties were formed at\nOmbre, at Basset, at Gleek, at Primero, and other games then in fashion;\nwhile the dice were used at various games, both with and without the\ntables, as Hazard, In-and-in, Passage, and so forth. The play, however,\ndid not appear to be extravagantly deep; it was certainly conducted with\ngreat decorum and fairness; nor did there appear any thing to lead the\nyoung Scotsman in the least to doubt his companion's assurance, that\nthe place was frequented by men of rank and quality, and that the\nrecreations they adopted were conducted upon honourable principles.\n\nLord Dalgarno neither had proposed play to his friend, nor joined in the\namusement himself, but sauntered from one table to another, remarking\nthe luck of the different players, as well as their capacity to avail\nthemselves of it, and exchanging conversation with the highest and most\nrespectable of the guests. At length, as if tired of what in modern\nphrase would have been termed lounging, he suddenly remembered that\nBurbage was to act Shakespeare's King Richard, at the Fortune, that\nafternoon, and that he could not give a stranger in London, like\nLord Glenvarloch, a higher entertainment than to carry him to that\nexhibition; \u00e2\u0080\u009cunless, indeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, in a whisper, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is paternal\ninterdiction of the theatre as well as of the ordinary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never heard my father speak of stage-plays,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cfor they are shows of a modern date, and unknown in Scotland. Yet, if\nwhat I have heard to their prejudice be true, I doubt much whether he\nwould have approved of them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cApproved of them!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Lord Dalgarno--\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy, George Buchanan wrote\ntragedies, and his pupil, learned and wise as himself, goes to see\nthem, so it is next door to treason to abstain; and the cleverest men in\nEngland write for the stage, and the prettiest women in London resort to\nthe playhouses, and I have a brace of nags at the door which will\ncarry us along the streets like wild-fire, and the ride will digest our\nvenison and ortolans, and dissipate the fumes of the wine, and so let's\nto horse--Godd'en to you, gentlemen--Godd'en, Chevalier de la Fortune.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLord Dalgarno's grooms were in attendance with two horses, and the young\nmen mounted, the proprietor upon a favourite barb, and Nigel upon a\nhigh-dressed jennet, scarce less beautiful. As they rode towards the\ntheatre, Lord Dalgarno endeavoured to discover his friend's opinion of\nthe company to which he had introduced him, and to combat the exceptions\nwhich he might suppose him to have taken. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd wherefore lookest thou\nsad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy pensive neophyte? Sage son of the Alma Mater of\nLow-Dutch learning, what aileth thee? Is the leaf of the living world\nwhich we have turned over in company, less fairly written than thou\nhadst been taught to expect? Be comforted, and pass over one little blot\nor two; thou wilt be doomed to read through many a page, as black as\nInfamy, with her sooty pinion, can make them. Remember, most immaculate\nNigel, that we are in London, not Leyden--that we are studying life, not\nlore. Stand buff against the reproach of thine over-tender conscience,\nman, and when thou summest up, like a good arithmetician, the actions\nof the day, before you balance the account on your pillow, tell the\naccusing spirit, to his brimstone beard, that if thine ears have heard\nthe clatter of the devil's bones, thy hand hath not trowled them--that\nif thine eye hath seen the brawling of two angry boys, thy blade hath\nnot been bared in their fray.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, all this may be wise and witty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyet I own I\ncannot think but that your lordship, and other men of good quality\nwith whom we dined, might have chosen a place of meeting free from the\nintrusion of bullies, and a better master of your ceremonial than yonder\nforeign adventurer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll shall be amended, Sancte Nigelle, when thou shalt come forth a\nnew Peter the Hermit, to preach a crusade against dicing, drabbing, and\ncompany-keeping. We will meet for dinner in Saint Sepulchre's Church;\nwe will dine in the chancel, drink our flask in the vestry, the parson\nshall draw every cork, and the clerk say amen to every health. Come man,\ncheer up, and get rid of this sour and unsocial humour. Credit me, that\nthe Puritans who object to us the follies and the frailties incident to\nhuman nature, have themselves the vices of absolute devils, privy malice\nand backbiting hypocrisy, and spiritual pride in all its presumption.\nThere is much, too, in life which we must see, were it only to learn to\nshun it. Will Shakespeare, who lives after death, and who is presently\nto afford thee such pleasure as none but himself can confer, has\ndescribed the gallant Falconbridge as calling that man\n\n  ----' a bastard to the time,\n  That doth not smack of observation;\n  Which, though I will not practise to deceive,\n  Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut here we are at the door of the Fortune, where we shall have\nmatchless Will speaking for himself.--Goblin, and you other lout, leave\nthe horses to the grooms, and make way for us through the press.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey dismounted, and the assiduous efforts of Lutin, elbowing, bullying,\nand proclaiming his master's name and title, made way through a crowd of\nmurmuring citizens, and clamorous apprentices, to the door, where Lord\nDalgarno speedily procured a brace of stools upon the stage for his\ncompanion and himself, where, seated among other gallants of the same\nclass, they had an opportunity of displaying their fair dresses\nand fashionable manners, while they criticised the piece during its\nprogress; thus forming, at the same time, a conspicuous part of the\nspectacle, and an important proportion of the audience.\n\nNigel Olifaunt was too eagerly and deeply absorbed in the interest of\nthe scene, to be capable of playing his part as became the place\nwhere he was seated. He felt all the magic of that sorcerer, who had\ndisplayed, within the paltry circle of a wooden booth, the long wars of\nYork and Lancaster, compelling the heroes of either line to stalk across\nthe scene in language and fashion as they lived, as if the grave had\ngiven up the dead for the amusement and instruction of the living.\nBurbage, esteemed the best Richard until Garrick arose, played the\ntyrant and usurper with such truth and liveliness, that when the Battle\nof Bosworth seemed concluded by his death, the ideas of reality and\ndeception were strongly contending in Lord Glenvarloch's imagination,\nand it required him to rouse himself from his reverie, so strange did\nthe proposal at first sound when his companion declared King Richard\nshould sup with them at the Mermaid.\n\nThey were joined, at the same time, by a small party of the gentlemen\nwith whom they had dined, which they recruited by inviting two or three\nof the most accomplished wits and poets, who seldom failed to attend\nthe Fortune Theatre, and were even but too ready to conclude a day of\namusement with a night of pleasure. Thither the whole party adjourned,\nand betwixt fertile cups of sack, excited spirits, and the emulous wit\nof their lively companions, seemed to realise the joyous boast of one of\nBen Jonson's contemporaries, when reminding the bard of\n\n            \u00e2\u0080\u009cThose lyric feasts,\n     Where men such clusters had,\n     As made them nobly wild, not mad;\n     While yet each verse of thine\n     Outdid the meat, outdid the frolic wine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\n    Let the proud salmon gorge the feather'd hook,\n    Then strike, and then you have him--He will wince;\n    Spin out your line that it shall whistle from you\n    Some twenty yards or so, yet you shall have him--\n    Marry! you must have patience--the stout rock\n    Which is his trust, hath edges something sharp;\n    And the deep pool hath ooze and sludge enough\n    To mar your fishing--'less you are more careful.\n                _Albion, or the Double Kings._\n\nIt is seldom that a day of pleasure, upon review, seems altogether\nso exquisite as the partaker of the festivity may have felt it while\npassing over him. Nigel Olifaunt, at least, did not feel it so, and it\nrequired a visit from his new acquaintance, Lord Dalgarno, to reconcile\nhim entirely to himself. But this visit took place early after\nbreakfast, and his friend's discourse was prefaced with a question, How\nhe liked the company of the preceding evening?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, excellently well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch; \u00e2\u0080\u009conly I should have\nliked the wit better had it appeared to flow more freely. Every man's\ninvention seemed on the stretch, and each extravagant simile seemed to\nset one half of your men of wit into a brown study to produce something\nwhich should out-herod it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd wherefore not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor what are these fellows fit\nfor, but to play the intellectual gladiators before us? He of them who\ndeclares himself recreant, should, d--n him, be restricted to muddy ale,\nand the patronage of the Waterman's Company. I promise you, that many a\npretty fellow has been mortally wounded with a quibble or a carwitchet\nat the Mermaid, and sent from thence, in a pitiable estate, to Wit's\nhospital in the Vintry, where they languish to this day amongst fools\nand aldermen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt may be so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyet I could swear by my honour, that\nlast night I seemed to be in company with more than one man whose genius\nand learning ought either to have placed him higher in our company, or\nto have withdrawn him altogether from a scene, where, sooth to speak,\nhis part seemed unworthily subordinate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, out upon your tender conscience,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand the\nfico for such outcasts of Parnassus! Why, these are the very leavings of\nthat noble banquet of pickled herrings and Rhenish, which lost London\nso many of her principal witmongers and bards of misrule. What would you\nhave said had you seen Nash or Green, when you interest yourself about\nthe poor mimes you supped with last night? Suffice it, they had their\ndrench and their doze, and they drank and slept as much as may save\nthem from any necessity of eating till evening, when, if they are\nindustrious, they will find patrons or players to feed them. [Footnote:\nThe condition of men of wit and talents was never more melancholy than\nabout this period. Their lives were so irregular, and their means of\nliving so precarious, that they were alternately rioting in debauchery,\nor encountering and struggling with the meanest necessities. Two or\nthree lost their lives by a surfeit brought on by that fatal banquet of\nRhenish wine and pickled herrings, which is familiar to those who\nstudy the lighter literature of that age. The whole history is a most\nmelancholy picture of genius, degraded at once by its own debaucheries,\nand the patronage of heartless rakes and profligates.] For the rest of\ntheir wants, they can be at no loss for cold water while the New\nRiver head holds good; and your doublets of Parnassus are eternal in\nduration.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVirgil and Horace had more efficient patronage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied his countryman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut these fellows are neither Virgil nor\nHorace; besides, we have other spirits of another sort, to whom I will\nintroduce you on some early occasion. Our Swan of Avon hath sung his\nlast; but we have stout old Ben, with as much learning and genius as\never prompted the treader of sock and buskin. It is not, however, of\nhim I mean now to speak; but I come to pray you, of dear love, to row up\nwith me as far as Richmond, where two or three of the gallants whom you\nsaw yesterday, mean to give music and syllabubs to a set of beauties,\nwith some curious bright eyes among them--such, I promise you, as might\nwin an astrologer from his worship of the galaxy. My sister leads the\nbevy, to whom I desire to present you. She hath her admirers at Court;\nand is regarded, though I might dispense with sounding her praise, as\none of the beauties of the time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was no refusing an engagement, where the presence of the party\ninvited, late so low in his own regard, was demanded by a lady of\nquality, one of the choice beauties of the time. Lord Glenvarloch\naccepted, as was inevitable, and spent a lively day among the gay\nand the fair. He was the gallant in attendance, for the day, upon his\nfriend's sister, the beautiful Countess of Blackchester, who aimed at\nonce at superiority in the realms of fashion, of power, and of wit.\n\nShe was, indeed, considerably older than her brother, and had probably\ncompleted her six lustres; but the deficiency in extreme youth was more\nthan atoned for, in the most precise and curious accuracy in attire,\nan early acquaintance with every foreign mode, and a peculiar gift\nin adapting the knowledge which she acquired, to her own particular\nfeatures and complexion. At Court, she knew as well as any lady in the\ncircle, the precise tone, moral, political, learned, or jocose, in which\nit was proper to answer the monarch, according to his prevailing humour;\nand was supposed to have been very active, by her personal interest,\nin procuring her husband a high situation, which the gouty old viscount\ncould never have deserved by any merit of his own commonplace conduct\nand understanding.\n\nIt was far more easy for this lady than for her brother, to reconcile\nso young a courtier as Lord Glenvarloch to the customs and habits of\na sphere so new to him. In all civilised society, the females of\ndistinguished rank and beauty give the tone to manners, and, through\nthese, even to morals. Lady Blackchester had, besides, interest either\nin the Court, or over the Court, (for its source could not be well\ntraced,) which created friends, and overawed those who might have been\ndisposed to play the part of enemies.\n\nAt one time, she was understood to be closely leagued with the\nBuckingham family, with whom her brother still maintained a great\nintimacy; and, although some coldness had taken place betwixt the\nCountess and the Duchess of Buckingham, so that they were little seen\ntogether, and the former seemed considerably to have withdrawn herself\ninto privacy, it was whispered that Lady Blackchester's interest with\nthe great favourite was not diminished in consequence of her breach with\nhis lady.\n\nOur accounts of the private Court intrigues of that period, and of the\npersons to whom they were intrusted, are not full enough to enable us to\npronounce upon the various reports which arose out of the circumstances\nwe have detailed. It is enough to say, that Lady Blackchester possessed\ngreat influence on the circle around her, both from her beauty, her\nabilities, and her reputed talents for Court intrigue; and that Nigel\nOlifaunt was not long of experiencing its power, as he became a slave in\nsome degree to that species of habit, which carries so many men into a\ncertain society at a certain hour, without expecting or receiving any\nparticular degree of gratification, or even amusement.\n\nHis life for several weeks may be thus described. The ordinary was no\nbad introduction to the business of the day; and the young lord quickly\nfound, that if the society there was not always irreproachable, still\nit formed the most convenient and agreeable place of meeting with the\nfashionable parties, with whom he visited Hyde Park, the theatres, and\nother places of public resort, or joined the gay and glittering circle\nwhich Lady Blackchester had assembled around her. Neither did he\nentertain the same scrupulous horror which led him originally even to\nhesitate entering into a place where gaming was permitted; but, on the\ncontrary, began to admit the idea, that as there could be no harm done\nin beholding such recreation when only indulged in to a moderate degree,\nso, from a parity of reasoning, there could be no objection to joining\nin it, always under the same restrictions. But the young lord was a\nScotsman, habituated to early reflection, and totally unaccustomed to\nany habit which inferred a careless risk or profuse waste of money.\nProfusion was not his natural vice, or one likely to be acquired in\nthe course of his education; and, in all probability, while his father\nanticipated with noble horror the idea of his son approaching the\ngaming-table, he was more startled at the idea of his becoming a gaining\nthan a losing adventurer. The second, according to his principles, had\na termination, a sad one indeed, in the loss of temporal fortune--the\nfirst quality went on increasing the evil which he dreaded, and perilled\nat once both body and soul.\n\nHowever the old lord might ground his apprehension, it was so far\nverified by his son's conduct, that, from an observer of the various\ngames of chance which he witnessed, he came, by degrees, by moderate\nhazards, and small bets or wagers, to take a certain interest in them.\nNor could it be denied, that his rank and expectations entitled him to\nhazard a few pieces (for his game went no deeper) against persons, who,\nfrom the readiness with which they staked their money, might be supposed\nwell able to afford to lose it.\n\nIt chanced, or, perhaps, according to the common belief, his evil genius\nhad so decreed, that Nigel's adventures were remarkably successful. He\nwas temperate, cautious, cool-headed, had a strong memory, and a ready\npower of calculation; was besides, of a daring and intrepid character,\none upon whom no one that had looked even slightly, or spoken to\nthough but hastily, would readily have ventured to practise any thing\napproaching to trick, or which required to be supported by intimidation.\nWhile Lord Glenvarloch chose to play, men played with him regularly,\nor, according to the phrase, upon the square; and, as he found his\nluck change, or wished to hazard his good fortune no farther, the more\nprofessed votaries of fortune, who frequented the house of Monsieur le\nChevalier de Saint Priest Beaujeu, did not venture openly to express\ntheir displeasure at his rising a winner. But when this happened\nrepeatedly, the gamesters murmured amongst themselves equally at the\ncaution and the success of the young Scotsman; and he became far from\nbeing a popular character among their society.\n\nIt was no slight inducement to the continuance of this most evil habit,\nwhen it was once in some degree acquired, that it seemed to place\nLord Glenvarloch, haughty as he naturally was, beyond the necessity of\nsubjecting himself to farther pecuniary obligations, which his prolonged\nresidence in London must otherwise have rendered necessary. He had to\nsolicit from the ministers certain forms of office, which were to render\nhis sign-manual effectually useful; and these, though they could not be\ndenied, were delayed in such a manner, as to lead Nigel to believe there\nwas some secret opposition, which occasioned the demur in his business.\nHis own impulse was, to have appeared at Court a second time, with the\nking's sign-manual in his pocket, and to have appealed to his Majesty\nhimself, whether the delay of the public officers ought to render his\nroyal generosity unavailing. But the Lord Huntinglen, that good old\npeer, who had so frankly interfered in his behalf on a former occasion,\nand whom he occasionally visited, greatly dissuaded him from a similar\nadventure, and exhorted him quietly to await the deliverance of the\nministers, which should set him free from dancing attendance in London.\n\nLord Dalgarno joined his father in deterring his young friend from a\nsecond attendance at Court, at least till he was reconciled with the\nDuke of Buckingham--\u00e2\u0080\u009ca matter in which,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, addressing his father,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have offered my poor assistance, without being able to prevail on\nLord Nigel to make any--not even the least--submission to the Duke of\nBuckingham.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my faith, and I hold the laddie to be in the right on't, Malcom!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered the stout old Scots lord.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat right hath Buckingham, or,\nto speak plainly, the son of Sir George Villiers, to expect homage and\nfealty from one more noble than himself by eight quarters? I heard him\nmyself, on no reason that I could perceive, term Lord Nigel his enemy;\nand it will never be by my counsel that the lad speaks soft word to him,\ntill he recalls the hard one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is precisely my advice to Lord Glenvarloch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lord\nDalgarno; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut then you will admit, my dear father, that it would be the\nrisk of extremity for our friend to return into the presence, the duke\nbeing his enemy--better to leave it with me to take off the heat of the\ndistemperature, with which some pickthanks have persuaded the duke to\nregard our friend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf thou canst persuade Buckingham of his error, Malcolm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his\nfather, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor once I will say there hath been kindness and honesty in\nCourt service. I have oft told your sister and yourself, that in the\ngeneral I esteem it as lightly as may be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou need not doubt my doing my best in Nigel's case,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lord\nDalgarno; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut you must think, my dear father, I must needs use slower\nand gentler means than those by which you became a favourite twenty\nyears ago.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my faith, I am afraid thou wilt,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered his father.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell\nthee, Malcolm, I would sooner wish myself in the grave, than doubt\nthine honesty or honour; yet somehow it hath chanced, that honest,\nready service, hath not the same acceptance at Court which it has in my\nyounger time--and yet you rise there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, the time permits not your old-world service,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord\nDalgarno; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe have now no daily insurrections, no nightly attempts at\nassassination, as were the fashion in the Scottish Court. Your prompt\nand uncourteous sword-in-hand attendance on the sovereign is no\nlonger necessary, and would be as unbeseeming as your old-fashioned\nserving-men, with their badges, broadswords, and bucklers, would be at a\ncourt-mask. Besides, father, loyal haste hath its inconveniences. I have\nheard, and from royal lips too, that when you stuck your dagger into the\ntraitor Ruthven, it was with such little consideration, that the point\nran a quarter of an inch into the royal buttock. The king\nnever talks of it but he rubs the injured part, and quotes his\n_'infandum-------renovare dolorem.'_ But this comes of old fashions, and\nof wearing a long Liddesdale whinger instead of a poniard of Parma. Yet\nthis, my dear father, you call prompt and valiant service. The king, I\nam told, could not sit upright for a fortnight, though all the cushions\nin Falkland were placed in his chair of state, and the Provost of\nDunfermline's borrowed to the boot of all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a lie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old earl, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca false lie, forge it who list!--It\nis true I wore a dagger of service by my side, and not a bodkin like\nyours, to pick one's teeth withal--and for prompt service--Odds nouns!\nit should be prompt to be useful when kings are crying treason and\nmurder with the screech of a half-throttled hen. But you young courtiers\nknow nought of these matters, and are little better than the green geese\nthey bring over from the Indies, whose only merit to their masters is to\nrepeat their own words after them--a pack of mouthers, and flatterers,\nand ear-wigs.--Well, I am old and unable to mend, else I would break all\noff, and hear the Tay once more flinging himself over the Campsie Linn.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut there is your dinner-bell, father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich, if\nthe venison I sent you prove seasonable, is at least as sweet a sound.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFollow me, then, youngsters, if you list,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old earl; and\nstrode on from the alcove in which this conversation was held, towards\nthe house, followed by the two young men.\n\nIn their private discourse, Lord Dalgarno had little trouble in\ndissuading Nigel from going immediately to Court; while, on the other\nhand, the offers he made him of a previous introduction to the Duke\nof Buckingham, were received by Lord Glenvarloch with a positive and\ncontemptuous refusal. His friend shrugged his shoulders, as one who\nclaims the merit of having given to an obstinate friend the best\ncounsel, and desires to be held free of the consequences of his\npertinacity.\n\nAs for the father, his table indeed, and his best liquor, of which\nhe was more profuse than necessary, were at the command of his young\nfriend, as well as his best advice and assistance in the prosecution of\nhis affairs. But Lord Huntinglen's interest was more apparent than real;\nand the credit he had acquired by his gallant defence of the king's\nperson, was so carelessly managed by himself, and so easily eluded by\nthe favourites and ministers of the sovereign, that, except upon one or\ntwo occasions, when the king was in some measure taken by surprise, as\nin the case of Lord Glenvarloch, the royal bounty was never efficiently\nextended either to himself or to his friends.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere never was a man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno, whose shrewder knowledge of\nthe English Court saw where his father's deficiency lay, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat had it so\nperfectly in his power to have made his way to the pinnacle of fortune\nas my poor father. He had acquired a right to build up a staircase, step\nby step, slowly and surely, letting every boon, which he begged year\nafter year, become in its turn the resting-place for the next annual\ngrant. But your fortunes shall not shipwreck upon the same coast,\nNigel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would conclude. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I have fewer means of influence than my\nfather has, or rather had, till he threw them away for butts of sack,\nhawks, hounds, and such carrion, I can, far better than he, improve that\nwhich I possess; and that, my dear Nigel, is all engaged in your behalf.\nDo not be surprised or offended that you now see me less than formerly.\nThe stag-hunting is commenced, and the prince looks that I should attend\nhim more frequently. I must also maintain my attendance on the duke,\nthat I may have an opportunity of pleading your cause when occasion\nshall permit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no cause to plead before the duke,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, gravely; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have\nsaid so repeatedly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, I meant the phrase no otherwise, thou churlish and suspicious\ndisputant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Dalgarno, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthan as I am now pleading the duke's\ncause with thee. Surely I only mean to claim a share in our royal\nmaster's favourite benediction, _Beati Pacifici_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nUpon several occasions, Lord Glenvarloch's conversations, both with the\nold earl and his son, took a similar turn and had a like conclusion. He\nsometimes felt as if, betwixt the one and the other, not to mention the\nmore unseen and unboasted, but scarce less certain influence of Lady\nBlackchester, his affair, simple as it had become, might have been\nsomehow accelerated. But it was equally impossible to doubt the rough\nhonesty of the father, and the eager and officious friendship of Lord\nDalgarno; nor was it easy to suppose that the countenance of the lady,\nby whom he was received with such distinction, would be wanting, could\nit be effectual in his service.\n\nNigel was further sensible of the truth of what Lord Dalgarno often\npointed out, that the favourite being supposed to be his enemy, every\npetty officer, through whose hands his affair must necessarily pass,\nwould desire to make a merit of throwing obstacles in his way, which\nhe could only surmount by steadiness and patience, unless he preferred\nclosing the breach, or, as Lord Dalgarno called it, making his peace\nwith the Duke of Buckingham.\n\nNigel might, and doubtless would, have had recourse to the advice of his\nfriend George Heriot upon this occasion, having found it so advantageous\nformerly; but the only time he saw him after their visit to Court, he\nfound the worthy citizen engaged in hasty preparations for a journey to\nParis, upon business of great importance in the way of his profession,\nand by an especial commission from the Court and the Duke of Buckingham,\nwhich was likely to be attended with considerable profit. The good man\nsmiled as he named the Duke of Buckingham. He had been, he said, pretty\nsure that his disgrace in that quarter would not be of long duration.\nLord Glenvarloch expressed himself rejoiced at that reconciliation,\nobserving, that it had been a most painful reflection to him, that\nMaster Heriot should, in his behalf, have incurred the dislike, and\nperhaps exposed himself to the ill offices, of so powerful a favourite.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor your father's son I would do much; and yet\ntruly, if I know myself, I would do as much and risk as much, for the\nsake of justice, in the case of a much more insignificant person, as I\nhave ventured for yours. But as we shall not meet for some time, I must\ncommit to your own wisdom the farther prosecution of this matter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd thus they took a kind and affectionate leave of each other.\n\nThere were other changes in Lord Glenvarloch's situation, which require\nto be noticed. His present occupations, and the habits of amusement\nwhich he had acquired, rendered his living so far in the city a\nconsiderable inconvenience. He may also have become a little ashamed of\nhis cabin on Paul's Wharf, and desirous of being lodged somewhat\nmore according to his quality. For this purpose, he had hired a small\napartment near the Temple. He was, nevertheless, almost sorry for what\nhe had done, when he observed that his removal appeared to give some\npain to John Christie, and a great deal to his cordial and officious\nlandlady. The former, who was grave and saturnine in every thing he did,\nonly hoped that all had been to Lord Glenvarloch's mind, and that he had\nnot left them on account of any unbeseeming negligence on their part.\nBut the tear twinkled in Dame Nelly's eye, while she recounted the\nvarious improvements she had made in the apartment, of express purpose\nto render it more convenient to his lordship.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was a great sea-chest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009chad been taken upstairs to the\nshopman's garret, though it left the poor lad scarce eighteen inches\nof opening to creep betwixt it and his bed; and Heaven knew--she did\nnot--whether it could ever be brought down that narrow stair again. Then\nthe turning the closet into an alcove had cost a matter of twenty round\nshillings; and to be sure, to any other lodger but his lordship, the\ncloset was more convenient. There was all the linen, too, which she had\nbought on purpose--But Heaven's will be done--she was resigned.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEverybody likes marks of personal attachment; and Nigel, whose heart\nreally smote him, as if in his rising fortunes he were disdaining the\nlowly accommodations and the civilities of the humble friends which had\nbeen but lately actual favours, failed not by every assurance in his\npower, and by as liberal payment as they could be prevailed upon to\naccept, to alleviate the soreness of their feelings at his departure;\nand a parting kiss from the fair lips of his hostess sealed his\nforgiveness.\n\nRichie Moniplies lingered behind his master, to ask whether, in case of\nneed, John Christie could help a canny Scotsman to a passage back to his\nown country; and receiving assurance of John's interest to that effect,\nhe said at parting, he would remind him of his promise soon.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif my lord is not weary of this London life, I ken one that\nis, videlicet, mysell; and I am weel determined to see Arthur's Seat\nagain ere I am many weeks older.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\n  Bingo, why, Bingo! hey, boy--here, sir, here!--\n  He's gone and off, but he'll be home before us;--\n  'Tis the most wayward cur e'er mumbled bone,\n  Or dogg'd a master's footstep.--Bingo loves me\n  Better than ever beggar loved his alms;\n  Yet, when he takes such humour, you may coax\n  Sweet Mistress Fantasy, your worship's mistress,\n  Out of her sullen moods, as soon as Bingo.\n                       _The Dominie And His Dog_.\n\nRichie Moniplies was as good as his word. Two or three mornings after\nthe young lord had possessed himself of his new lodgings, he appeared\nbefore Nigel, as he was preparing to dress, having left his pillow at an\nhour much later than had formerly been his custom.\n\nAs Nigel looked upon his attendant, he observed there was a gathering\ngloom upon his solemn features, which expressed either additional\nimportance, or superadded discontent, or a portion of both.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat is the matter this morning, Richie, that you\nhave made your face so like the grotesque mask on one of the spouts\nyonder?\u00e2\u0080\u009d pointing to the Temple Church, of which Gothic building they\nhad a view from the window.\n\nRichie swivelled his head a little to the right with as little alacrity\nas if he had the crick in his neck, and instantly resuming his posture,\nreplied,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMask here, mask there--it were nae such matters that I have\nto speak anent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what matters have you to speak anent, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his master, whom\ncircumstances had inured to tolerate a good deal of freedom from his\nattendant.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--said Richie, and then stopped to cough and hem, as if what\nhe had to say stuck somewhat in his throat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI guess the mystery,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou want a little money, Richie;\nwill five pieces serve the present turn?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI may, it is like, want a trifle of money; and\nI am glad at the same time, and sorry, that it is mair plenty with your\nlordship than formerly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGlad and sorry, man!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy, you are reading riddles to\nme, Richie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy riddle will be briefly read,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI come to crave of your\nlordship your commands for Scotland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor Scotland!--why, art thou mad, man?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009ccanst thou not\ntarry to go down with me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI could be of little service,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009csince you purpose to hire\nanother page and groom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, thou jealous ass,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young lord, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill not thy load of\nduty lie the lighter?--Go, take thy breakfast, and drink thy ale double\nstrong, to put such absurdities out of thy head--I could be angry with\nthee for thy folly, man--but I remember how thou hast stuck to me in\nadversity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAdversity, my lord, should never have parted us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cmethinks, had the warst come to warst, I could have starved as\ngallantly as your lordship, or more so, being in some sort used to it;\nfor, though I was bred at a flasher's stall, I have not through my life\nhad a constant intimacy with collops.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, what is the meaning of all this trash?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cor has it no\nother end than to provoke my patience? You know well enough, that, had I\ntwenty serving-men, I would hold the faithful follower that stood by\nme in my distress the most valued of them all. But it is totally out of\nreason to plague me with your solemn capriccios.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin declaring your trust in me, you have done\nwhat is honourable to yourself, if I may with humility say so much, and\nin no way undeserved on my side. Nevertheless, we must part.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBody of me, man, why?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat reason can there be for\nit, if we are mutually satisfied?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie Moniplies, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour lordship's occupations are such\nas I cannot own or countenance by my presence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow now, sirrah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his master, angrily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnder favour, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied his domestic, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is unequal dealing to\nbe equally offended by my speech and by my silence. If you can hear with\npatience the grounds of my departure, it may be, for aught I know, the\nbetter for you here and hereafter--if not, let me have my license of\ndeparture in silence, and so no more about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo to, sir!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cspeak out your mind--only remember to whom\nyou speak it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWeel, weel, my lord--I speak it with humility;\u00e2\u0080\u009d (never did Richie look\nwith more starched dignity than when he uttered the word;) \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut do\nyou think this dicing and card-shuffling, and haunting of taverns and\nplayhouses, suits your lordship--for I am sure it does not suit me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, you are not turned precisian or puritan, fool?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord\nGlenvarloch, laughing, though, betwixt resentment and shame, it cost him\nsome trouble to do so.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the follower, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI ken the purport of your query. I\nam, it may be, a little of a precisian, and I wish to Heaven I was mair\nworthy of the name; but let that be a pass-over.--I have stretched the\nduties of a serving-man as far as my northern conscience will permit. I\ncan give my gude word to my master, or to my native country, when I am\nin a foreign land, even though I should leave downright truth a wee bit\nbehind me. Ay, and I will take or give a slash with ony man that\nspeaks to the derogation of either. But this chambering, dicing, and\nplay-haunting, is not my element--I cannot draw breath in it--and when\nI hear of your lordship winning the siller that some poor creature may\nfull sairly miss--by my saul, if it wad serve your necessity, rather\nthan you gained it from him, I wad take a jump over the hedge with your\nlordship, and cry 'Stand!' to the first grazier we met that was coming\nfrom Smithfield with the price of his Essex calves in his leathern\npouch!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a simpleton,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, who felt, however, much\nconscience-struck; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never play but for small sums.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the unyielding domestic, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand--still with\nreverence--it is even sae much the waur. If you played with your equals,\nthere might be like sin, but there wad be mair warldly honour in it.\nYour lordship kens, or may ken, by experience of your ain, whilk is not\nas yet mony weeks auld, that small sums can ill be missed by those that\nhave nane larger; and I maun e'en be plain with you, that men notice it\nof your lordship, that ye play wi' nane but the misguided creatures that\ncan but afford to lose bare stakes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo man dare say so!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Nigel, very angrily. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI play with whom I\nplease, but I will only play for what stake I please.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is just what they say, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the unmerciful Richie,\nwhose natural love of lecturing, as well as his bluntness of feeling,\nprevented him from having any idea of the pain which he was inflicting\non his master; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthese are even their own very words. It was but\nyesterday your lordship was pleased, at that same ordinary, to win from\nyonder young hafflins gentleman, with the crimson velvet doublet, and\nthe cock's feather in his beaver--him, I mean, who fought with the\nranting captain--a matter of five pounds, or thereby. I saw him come\nthrough the hall; and, if he was not cleaned out of cross and pile, I\nnever saw a ruined man in my life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cImpossible!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, who is he? he looked like a\nman of substance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll is not gold that glistens, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Richie; \u00e2\u0080\u009c'broidery\nand bullion buttons make bare pouches. And if you ask who he is--maybe I\nhave a guess, and care not to tell.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt least, if I have done any such fellow an injury,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lord\nNigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet me know how I can repair it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever fash your beard about that, my lord,--with reverence always,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said Richie,--\u00e2\u0080\u009che shall be suitably cared after. Think on him but as\nane wha was running post to the devil, and got a shouldering from your\nlordship to help him on his journey. But I will stop him, if reason can;\nand so your lordship needs asks nae mair about it, for there is no use\nin your knowing it, but much the contrair.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHark you, sirrah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his master, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have borne with you thus far,\nfor certain reasons; but abuse my good-nature no farther--and since you\nmust needs go, why, go a God's name, and here is to pay your journey.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n So saying, he put gold into his hand, which Richie told over piece by\npiece, with the utmost accuracy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it all right--or are they wanting in weight--or what the devil keeps\nyou, when your hurry was so great five minutes since?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young\nlord, now thoroughly nettled at the presumptuous precision with which\nRichie dealt forth his canons of morality.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe tale of coin is complete,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, with the most imperturbable\ngravity; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand, for the weight, though they are sae scrupulous in this\ntown, as make mouths at a piece that is a wee bit light, or that has\nbeen cracked within the ring, my sooth, they will jump at them in\nEdinburgh like a cock at a grosart. Gold pieces are not so plenty there,\nthe mair the pity!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe more is your folly, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, whose anger was only\nmomentary, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat leave the land where there is enough of them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto be round with you, the grace of God is\nbetter than gold pieces. When Goblin, as you call yonder Monsieur\nLutin,--and you might as well call him Gibbet, since that is what he is\nlike to end in,--shall recommend a page to you, ye will hear little such\ndoctrine as ye have heard from me.--And if they were my last words,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid, raising his voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would say you are misled, and are forsaking\nthe paths which your honourable father trode in; and, what is more, you\nare going--still under correction--to the devil with a dishclout, for ye\nare laughed at by them that lead you into these disordered bypaths.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLaughed at!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, who, like others of his age, was more sensible\nto ridicule than to reason--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho dares laugh at me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord, as sure as I live by bread--nay, more, as I am a true\nman--and, I think, your lordship never found Richie's tongue bearing\naught but the truth--unless that your lordship's credit, my country's\nprofit, or, it may be, some sma' occasion of my ain, made it unnecessary\nto promulgate the haill veritie,--I say then, as I am a true man, when I\nsaw that puir creature come through the ha', at that ordinary, whilk is\naccurst (Heaven forgive me for swearing!) of God and man, with his teeth\nset, and his hands clenched, and his bonnet drawn over his brows like a\ndesperate man, Goblin said to me, 'There goes a dunghill chicken, that\nyour master has plucked clean enough; it will be long ere his lordship\nruffle a feather with a cock of the game.' And so, my lord, to speak\nit out, the lackeys, and the gallants, and more especially your sworn\nbrother, Lord Dalgarno, call you the sparrow-hawk.--I had some thought\nto have cracked Lutin's pate for the speech, but, after a', the\ncontroversy was not worth it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo they use such terms of me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Nigel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDeath and the devil!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the devil's dam, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Richie; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey are all three\nbusy in London.--And, besides, Lutin and his master laughed at you, my\nlord, for letting it be thought that--I shame to speak it--that ye were\nover well with the wife of the decent honest man whose house you but\nnow left, as not sufficient for your new bravery, whereas they said, the\nlicentious scoffers, that you pretended to such favour when you had not\ncourage enough for so fair a quarrel, and that the sparrow-hawk was\ntoo craven-crested to fly at the wife of a cheesemonger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--He stopped a\nmoment, and looked fixedly in his master's face, which was inflamed with\nshame and anger, and then proceeded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord, I did you justice in my\nthought, and myself too; for, thought I, he would have been as deep in\nthat sort of profligacy as in others, if it hadna been Richie's four\nquarters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat new nonsense have you got to plague me with?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Nigel.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut go on, since it is the last time I am to be tormented with your\nimpertinence,--go on, and make the most of your time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn troth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand so will I even do. And as Heaven has\nbestowed on me a tongue to speak and to advise----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhich talent you can by no means be accused of suffering to remain\nidle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, interrupting him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, again waving his hand, as if to bespeak\nhis master's silence and attention; \u00e2\u0080\u009cso, I trust, you will think some\ntime hereafter. And, as I am about to leave your service, it is proper\nthat ye suld know the truth, that ye may consider the snares to which\nyour youth and innocence may be exposed, when aulder and doucer heads\nare withdrawn from beside you.--There has been a lusty, good-looking\nkimmer, of some forty, or bygane, making mony speerings about you, my\nlord.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, sir, what did she want with me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt first, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied his sapient follower, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas she seemed to be\na well-fashioned woman, and to take pleasure in sensible company, I was\nno way reluctant to admit her to my conversation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI dare say not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnor unwilling to tell her about my\nprivate affairs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot I, truly, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the attendant;--\u00e2\u0080\u009cfor, though she asked me\nmony questions about your fame, your fortune, your business here, and\nsuch like, I did not think it proper to tell her altogether the truth\nthereanent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see no call on you whatever,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto tell the woman\neither truth or lies upon what she had nothing to do with.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought so, too, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand so I told her\nneither.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what _did_ you tell her, then, you eternal babbler?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his\nmaster, impatient of his prate, yet curious to know what it was all to\nend in.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI told her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cabout your warldly fortune, and sae forth,\nsomething whilk is not truth just at this time; but which hath been\ntruth formerly, suld be truth now, and will be truth again,--and that\nwas, that you were in possession of your fair lands, whilk ye are but\nin right of as yet. Pleasant communing we had on that and other topics,\nuntil she showed the cloven foot, beginning to confer with me about some\nwench that she said had a good-will to your lordship, and fain she would\nhave spoken with you in particular anent it; but when I heard of such\ninklings, I began to suspect she was little better than--whew! \u00e2\u0080\u009c--Here\nhe concluded his narrative with a low, but very expressive whistle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what did your wisdom do in these circumstances?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Nigel,\nwho, notwithstanding his former resentment, could now scarcely forbear\nlaughing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI put on a look, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Richie, bending his solemn brows,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat suld give her a heartscald of walking on such errands. I laid her\nenormities clearly before her, and I threatened her, in sae mony words,\nthat I would have her to the ducking-stool; and she, on the contrair\npart, miscawed me for a forward northern tyke--and so we parted never\nto meet again, as I hope and trust. And so I stood between your lordship\nand that temptation, which might have been worse than the ordinary, or\nthe playhouse either; since you wot well what Solomon, King of the Jews,\nsayeth of the strange woman--for, said I to mysell, we have taken to\ndicing already, and if we take to drabbing next, the Lord kens what we\nmay land in!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour impertinence deserves correction, but it is the last which, for\na time at least, I shall have to forgive--and I forgive it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord\nGlenvarloch; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand, since we are to part, Richie, I will say no more\nrespecting your precautions on my account, than that I think you might\nhave left me to act according to my own judgment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMickle better not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Richie--\u00e2\u0080\u009cmickle better not; we are a'\nfrail creatures, and can judge better for ilk ither than in our ain\ncases. And for me, even myself, saving that case of the Sifflication,\nwhich might have happened to ony one, I have always observed myself to\nbe much more prudential in what I have done in your lordship's\nbehalf, than even in what I have been able to transact for my own\ninterest--whilk last, I have, indeed, always postponed, as in duty I\nought.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do believe thou hast,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009chaving ever found thee true\nand faithful. And since London pleases you so little, I will bid you a\nshort farewell; and you may go down to Edinburgh until I come thither\nmyself, when I trust you will re-enter into my service.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Heaven bless you, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie Moniplies, with uplifted\neyes; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor that word sounds more like grace than ony has come out of\nyour mouth this fortnight.--I give you godd'en, my lord.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he thrust forth his immense bony hand, seized on that of Lord\nGlenvarloch, raised it to his lips, then turned short on his heel, and\nleft the room hastily, as if afraid of showing more emotion than was\nconsistent with his ideas of decorum. Lord Nigel, rather surprised at\nhis sudden exit, called after him to know whether he was sufficiently\nprovided with money; but Richie, shaking his head, without making any\nother answer, ran hastily down stairs, shut the street-door heavily\nbehind him, and was presently seen striding along the Strand.\n\nHis master almost involuntarily watched and distinguished the tall\nraw-boned figure of his late follower, from the window, for some time,\nuntil he was lost among the crowd of passengers. Nigel's reflections\nwere not altogether those of self-approval. It was no good sign of his\ncourse of life, (he could not help acknowledging this much to himself,)\nthat so faithful an adherent no longer seemed to feel the same pride\nin his service, or attachment to his person, which he had formerly\nmanifested. Neither could he avoid experiencing some twinges of\nconscience, while he felt in some degree the charges which Richie\nhad preferred against him, and experienced a sense of shame and\nmortification, arising from the colour given by others to that, which\nhe himself would have called his caution and moderation in play. He had\nonly the apology, that it had never occurred to himself in this light.\n\nThen his pride and self-love suggested, that, on the other hand, Richie,\nwith all his good intentions, was little better than a conceited,\npragmatical domestic, who seemed disposed rather to play the tutor than\nthe lackey, and who, out of sheer love, as he alleged, to his master's\nperson, assumed the privilege of interfering with, and controlling, his\nactions, besides rendering him ridiculous in the gay world, from the\nantiquated formality, and intrusive presumption, of his manners.\n\nNigel's eyes were scarce turned from the window, when his new landlord\nentering, presented to him a slip of paper, carefully bound round with\na string of flox-silk and sealed---it had been given in, he said, by a\nwoman, who did not stop an instant. The contents harped upon the same\nstring which Richie Moniplies had already jarred. The epistle was in the\nfollowing words:\n\nFor the Right Honourable hands of Lord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese, from a\nfriend unknown:--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMY LORD,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are trusting to an unhonest friend, and diminishing an honest\nreputation. An unknown but real friend of your lordship will speak in\none word what you would not learn from flatterers in so many days, as\nshould suffice for your utter ruin. He whom you think most true--I say\nyour friend Lord Dalgarno--is utterly false to you, and doth but seek,\nunder pretence of friendship, to mar your fortune, and diminish the good\nname by which you might mend it. The kind countenance which he shows\nto you, is more dangerous than the Prince's frown; even as to gain\nat Beaujeu's ordinary is more discreditable than to lose. Beware of\nboth.--And this is all from your true but nameless friend, IGNOTO.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLord Glenvarloch paused for an instant, and crushed the paper\ntogether--then again unfolded and read it with attention--bent\nhis brows--mused for a moment, and then tearing it to fragments,\nexclaimed--\u00e2\u0080\u009cBegone for a vile calumny! But I will watch--I will\nobserve--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThought after thought rushed on him; but, upon the whole, Lord\nGlenvarloch was so little satisfied with the result of his own\nreflections, that he resolved to dissipate them by a walk in the Park,\nand, taking his cloak and beaver, went thither accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\n  Twas when fleet Snowball's head was woxen grey,\n  A luckless lev'ret met him on his way.--\n  Who knows not Snowball--he, whose race renown'd\n  Is still victorious on each coursing ground?\n  Swaffhanm Newmarket, and the Roman Camp,\n  Have seen them victors o'er each meaner stamp--\n  In vain the youngling sought, with doubling wile,\n  The hedge, the hill, the thicket, or the stile.\n  Experience sage the lack of speed supplied,\n  And in the gap he sought, the victim died.\n  So was I once, in thy fair street, Saint James,\n  Through walking cavaliers, and car-borne dames,\n  Descried, pursued, turn'd o'er again, and o'er,\n  Coursed, coted, mouth'd by an unfeeling bore.\n                                        &c. &c. &c,\n\nThe Park of Saint James's, though enlarged, planted with verdant alleys,\nand otherwise decorated by Charles II., existed in the days of his\ngrandfather, as a public and pleasant promenade; and, for the sake of\nexercise or pastime, was much frequented by the better classes.\n\nLord Glenvarloch repaired thither to dispel the unpleasant reflections\nwhich had been suggested by his parting with his trusty squire, Richie\nMoniplies, in a manner which was agreeable neither to his pride nor his\nfeelings; and by the corroboration which the hints of his late attendant\nhad received from the anonymous letter mentioned in the end of the last\nchapter.\n\nThere was a considerable number of company in the Park when he entered\nit, but, his present state of mind inducing him to avoid society,\nhe kept aloof from the more frequented walks towards Westminster\nand Whitehall, and drew to the north, or, as we should now say, the\nPiccadilly verge of the enclosure, believing he might there enjoy, or\nrather combat, his own thoughts unmolested.\n\nIn this, however, Lord Glenvarloch was mistaken; for, as he strolled\nslowly along with his arms folded in his cloak, and his hat drawn over\nhis eyes, he was suddenly pounced upon by Sir Mungo Malagrowther,\nwho, either shunning or shunned, had retreated, or had been obliged to\nretreat, to the same less frequented corner of the Park.\n\nNigel started when he heard the high, sharp, and querulous tones of the\nknight's cracked voice, and was no less alarmed when he beheld his tall\nthin figure hobbling towards him, wrapped in a thread-bare cloak, on\nwhose surface ten thousand varied stains eclipsed the original scarlet,\nand having his head surmounted with a well-worn beaver, bearing a black\nvelvet band for a chain, and a capon's feather for an ostrich plume.\n\nLord Glenvarloch would fain have made his escape, but, as our motto\nintimates, a leveret had as little chance to free herself of an\nexperienced greyhound. Sir Mungo, to continue the simile, had long ago\nlearned to run cunning, and make sure of mouthing his game. So\nNigel found himself compelled to stand and answer the hackneyed\nquestion--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat news to-day?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing extraordinary, I believe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the young nobleman,\nattempting to pass on.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, ye are ganging to the French ordinary belive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the knight;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it is early day yet--we will take a turn in the Park in the\nmeanwhile--it will sharpen your appetite.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he quietly slipped his arm under Lord Glenvarloch's, in spite\nof all the decent reluctance which his victim could exhibit, by keeping\nhis elbow close to his side; and having fairly grappled the prize, he\nproceeded to take it in tow.\n\nNigel was sullen and silent, in hopes to shake off his unpleasant\ncompanion; but Sir Mungo was determined, that if he did not speak, he\nshould at least hear.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe are bound for the ordinary, my lord?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the cynic;--\u00e2\u0080\u009cweel, ye\ncanna do better--there is choice company there, and peculiarly selected,\nas I am tauld, being, dootless, sic as it is desirable that young\nnoblemen should herd withal--and your noble father wad have been blithe\nto see you keeping such worshipful society.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, thinking himself obliged to say\nsomething, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the society is as good as generally can be found in\nsuch places, where the door can scarcely be shut against those who come\nto spend their money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRight, my lord--vera right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his tormentor, bursting out into a\nchuckling, but most discordant laugh. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese citizen chuffs and clowns\nwill press in amongst us, when there is but an inch of a door open. And\nwhat remedy?--Just e'en this, that as their cash gies them confidence,\nwe should strip them of it. Flay them, my lord--singe them as the\nkitchen wench does the rats, and then they winna long to come back\nagain.--Ay, ay--pluck them, plume them--and then the larded capons will\nnot be for flying so high a wing, my lord, among the goss-hawks and\nsparrow-hawks, and the like.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd, therewithal, Sir Mungo fixed on Nigel his quick, sharp, grey\neye, watching the effect of his sarcasm as keenly as the surgeon, in a\ndelicate operation, remarks the progress of his anatomical scalpel.\n\nNigel, however willing to conceal his sensations, could not avoid\ngratifying his tormentor by wincing under the operation. He coloured\nwith vexation and anger; but a quarrel with Sir Mungo Malagrowther\nwould, he felt, be unutterably ridiculous; and he only muttered to\nhimself the words, \u00e2\u0080\u009cImpertinent coxcomb!\u00e2\u0080\u009d which, on this occasion,\nSir Mungo's imperfection of organ did not prevent him from hearing and\nreplying to.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay--vera true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the caustic old courtier--\u00e2\u0080\u009cImpertinent\ncoxcombs they are, that thus intrude themselves on the society of their\nbetters; but your lordship kens how to gar them as gude--ye have the\ntrick on't.--They had a braw sport in the presence last Friday, how ye\nsuld have routed a young shopkeeper, horse and foot, ta'en his _spolia\nofima_, and a' the specie he had about him, down to the very silver\nbuttons of his cloak, and sent him to graze with Nebuchadnezzar, King\nof Babylon. Muckle honour redounded to your lordship thereby.--We were\ntauld the loon threw himsell into the Thames in a fit of desperation.\nThere's enow of them behind--there was mair tint on Flodden-edge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have been told a budget of lies, so far as I am concerned, Sir\nMungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, speaking loud and sternly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVera likely--vera likely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the unabashed and undismayed Sir Mungo;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cnaething but lies are current in the circle.--So the chield is not\ndrowned, then?--the mair's the pity.--But I never believed that part of\nthe story--a London dealer has mair wit in his anger. I dare swear the\nlad has a bonny broom-shank in his hand by this time, and is scrubbing\nthe kennels in quest after rusty nails, to help him to begin his pack\nagain.--He has three bairns, they say; they will help him bravely to\ngrope in the gutters. Your good lordship may have the ruining of him\nagain, my lord, if they have any luck in strand-scouring.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is more than intolerable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, uncertain whether to make\nan angry vindication of his character, or to fling the old tormentor\nfrom his arm. But an instant's recollection convinced him, that, to do\neither, would only give an air of truth and consistency to the scandals\nwhich he began to see were affecting his character, both in the higher\nand lower circles. Hastily, therefore, he formed the wiser resolution,\nto endure Sir Mungo's studied impertinence, under the hope of\nascertaining, if possible, from what source those reports arose which\nwere so prejudicial to his reputation.\n\nSir Mungo, in the meanwhile, caught up, as usual, Nigel's last words, or\nrather the sound of them, and amplified and interpreted them in his own\nway. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTolerable luck!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he repeated; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyes, truly, my lord, I am told that\nyou have tolerable luck, and that ye ken weel how to use that jilting\nquean, Dame Fortune, like a canny douce lad, willing to warm yourself in\nher smiles, without exposing yourself to her frowns. And that is what I\nca' having luck in a bag.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir Mungo Malagrowther,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, turning towards him\nseriously, \u00e2\u0080\u009chave the goodness to hear me for a moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs weel as I can, my lord--as weel as I can,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Mungo, shaking\nhis head, and pointing the finger of his left hand to his ear.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will try to speak very distinctly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, arming himself with\npatience. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou take me for a noted gamester; I give you my word that\nyou have not been rightly informed--I am none such. You owe me some\nexplanation, at least, respecting the source from which you have derived\nsuch false information.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never heard ye were a _great_ gamester, and never thought or said ye\nwere such, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Mungo, who found it impossible to\navoid hearing what Nigel said with peculiarly deliberate and distinct\npronunciation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI repeat it--I never heard, said, or thought that\nyou were a ruffling gamester,--such as they call those of the first\nhead.--Look you, my lord, I call _him_ a gamester, that plays with equal\nstakes and equal skill, and stands by the fortune of the game, good or\nbad; and I call _him_ a ruffling gamester, or ane of the first head, who\nventures frankly and deeply upon such a wager. But he, my lord, who has\nthe patience and prudence never to venture beyond small game, such as,\nat most, might crack the Christmas-box of a grocer's 'prentice, who vies\nwith those that have little to hazard, and who therefore, having the\nlarger stock, can always rook them by waiting for his good fortune, and\nby rising from the game when luck leaves him--such a one as he, my\nlord, I do not call a _great_ gamester, to whatever other name he may be\nentitled.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd such a mean-spirited, sordid wretch, you would infer that I am,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n replied Lord Glenvarloch; \u00e2\u0080\u009cone who fears the skilful, and preys upon the\nignorant--who avoids playing with his equals, that he may make sure\nof pillaging his inferiors?--Is this what I am to understand has been\nreported of me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, my lord, you will gain nought by speaking big with me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir\nMungo, who, besides that his sarcastic humour was really supported by\na good fund of animal courage, had also full reliance on the immunities\nwhich he had derived from the broadsword of Sir Rullion Rattray, and the\nbaton of the satellites employed by the Lady Cockpen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd for the truth\nof the matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour lordship best knows whether you\never lost more than five pieces at a time since you frequented\nBeaujeu's--whether you have not most commonly risen a winner--and\nwhether the brave young gallants who frequent the ordinary--I mean\nthose of noble rank, and means conforming--are in use to play upon those\nterms?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy father was right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, in the bitterness of his\nspirit; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand his curse justly followed me when I first entered that\nplace. There is contamination in the air, and he whose fortune avoids\nruin, shall be blighted in his honour and reputation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSir Mungo, who watched his victim with the delighted yet wary eye of an\nexperienced angler, became now aware, that if he strained the line on\nhim too tightly, there was every risk of his breaking hold. In order to\ngive him room, therefore, to play, he protested that Lord Glenvarloch\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cshould not take his free speech _in malam partem_. If you were a trifle\nower sicker in your amusement, my lord, it canna be denied that it\nis the safest course to prevent farther endangerment of your somewhat\ndilapidated fortunes; and if ye play with your inferiors, ye are\nrelieved of the pain of pouching the siller of your friends and\nequals; forby, that the plebeian knaves have had the advantage, _tecum\ncertasse_, as Ajax Telamon sayeth, _apud Metamorphoseos_; and for the\nlike of them to have played with ane Scottish nobleman is an honest and\nhonourable consideration to compensate the loss of their stake, whilk, I\ndare say, moreover, maist of the churls can weel afford.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe that as it may, Sir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would fain know--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d interrupted Sir Mungo; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand, as you say, who cares whether the\nfat bulls of Bashan can spare it or no? gentlemen are not to limit their\nsport for the like of them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish to know, Sir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin what company you\nhave learned these offensive particulars respecting me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDootless--dootless, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Mungo; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have ever heard, and\nhave ever reported, that your lordship kept the best of company in a\nprivate way.--There is the fine Countess of Blackchester, but I think\nshe stirs not much abroad since her affair with his Grace of Buckingham;\nand there is the gude auld-fashioned Scottish nobleman, Lord Huntinglen,\nan undeniable man of quality--it is pity but he could keep caup and can\nfrae his head, whilk now and then doth'minish his reputation. And there\nis the gay young Lord Dalgarno, that carries the craft of gray hairs\nunder his curled love-locks--a fair race they are, father, daughter,\nand son, all of the same honourable family. I think we needna speak of\nGeorge Heriot, honest man, when we have nobility in question. So that\nis the company I have heard of your keeping, my lord, out-taken those of\nthe ordinary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy company has not, indeed, been much more extended than amongst those\nyou mention,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut in short--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo Court?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Mungo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat was just what I was going to say--Lord\nDalgarno says he cannot prevail on ye to come to Court, and that does ye\nprejudice, my lord--the king hears of you by others, when he should see\nyou in person--I speak in serious friendship, my lord. His Majesty,\nwhen you were named in the circle short while since, was heard to say,\n_'Jacta est alea!_--Glenvarlochides is turned dicer and drinker.'--My\nLord Dalgarno took your part, and he was e'en borne down by the popular\nvoice of the courtiers, who spoke of you as one who had betaken yourself\nto living a town life, and risking your baron's coronet amongst the\nflatcaps of the city.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd this was publicly spoken of me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand in the king's\npresence?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSpoken openly?\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated Sir Mungo Malagrowther; \u00e2\u0080\u009cay, by my troth\nwas it--that is to say, it was whispered privately--whilk is as open\npromulgation as the thing permitted; for ye may think the Court is not\nlike a place where men are as sib as Simmie and his brother, and roar\nout their minds as if they were at an ordinary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA curse on the Court and the ordinary both!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Nigel, impatiently.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith all my heart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the knight; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have got little by a knight's\nservice in the Court; and the last time I was at the ordinary, I lost\nfour angels.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I pray of you, Sir Mungo, to let me know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe names\nof those who thus make free with the character of one who can be but\nlittle known to them, and who never injured any of them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave I not told you already,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Sir Mungo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the king said\nsomething to that effect--so did the Prince too;--and such being the\ncase, ye may take it on your corporal oath, that every man in the circle\nwho was not silent, sung the same song as they did.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou said but now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat Lord Dalgarno interfered\nin my behalf.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn good troth did he,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Sir Mungo, with a sneer; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut the young\nnobleman was soon borne down--by token, he had something of a catarrh,\nand spoke as hoarse as a roopit raven. Poor gentleman, if he had had his\nfull extent of voice, he would have been as well listened to, dootless,\nas in a cause of his ain, whilk no man kens better how to plead to\npurpose.--And let me ask you, by the way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Sir Mungo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhether\nLord Dalgarno has ever introduced your lordship to the Prince, or the\nDuke of Buckingham, either of whom might soon carry through your suit?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no claim on the favour of either the Prince or the Duke of\nBuckingham,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs you seem to have made my\naffairs your study, Sir Mungo, although perhaps something unnecessarily,\nyou may have heard that I have petitioned my Sovereign for payment of a\ndebt due to my family. I cannot doubt the king's desire to do justice,\nnor can I in decency employ the solicitation of his Highness the Prince,\nor his Grace the Duke of Buckingham, to obtain from his Majesty what\neither should be granted me as a right, or refused altogether.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSir Mungo twisted his whimsical features into one of his most grotesque\nsneers, as he replied--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a vera clear and parspicuous position of the case, my lord; and\nin relying thereupon, you show an absolute and unimprovable acquaintance\nwith the King, Court, and mankind in general.-But whom have we got\nhere?--Stand up, my lord, and make way--by my word of honour, they are\nthe very men we spoke of--talk of the devil, and--humph!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt must be here premised, that, during the conversation, Lord\nGlenvarloch, perhaps in the hope of shaking himself free of Sir Mungo,\nhad directed their walk towards the more frequented part of the Park;\nwhile the good knight had stuck to him, being totally indifferent which\nway they went, provided he could keep his talons clutched upon his\ncompanion. They were still, however, at some distance from the livelier\npart of the scene, when Sir Mungo's experienced eye noticed the\nappearances which occasioned the latter part of his speech to Lord\nGlenvarloch. A low respectful murmur arose among the numerous groups of\npersons which occupied the lower part of the Park. They first clustered\ntogether, with their faces turned towards Whitehall, then fell back\non either hand to give place to a splendid party of gallants, who,\nadvancing from the Palace, came onward through the Park; all the other\ncompany drawing off the pathway, and standing uncovered as they passed.\n\nMost of these courtly gallants were dressed in the garb which the\npencil of Vandyke has made familiar even at the distance of nearly two\ncenturies; and which was just at this period beginning to supersede\nthe more fluttering and frivolous dress which had been adopted from the\nFrench Court of Henri Quatre.\n\nThe whole train were uncovered excepting the Prince of Wales, afterwards\nthe most unfortunate of British monarchs, who came onward, having his\nlong curled auburn tresses, and his countenance, which, even in early\nyouth, bore a shade of anticipated melancholy, shaded by the Spanish hat\nand the single ostrich feather which drooped from it. On his right\nhand was Buckingham, whose commanding, and at the same time graceful,\ndeportment, threw almost into shade the personal demeanour and majesty\nof the Prince on whom he attended. The eye, movements, and gestures\nof the great courtier were so composed, so regularly observant of all\netiquette belonging to his situation, as to form a marked and strong\ncontrast with the forward gaiety and frivolity by which he recommended\nhimself to the favour of his \u00e2\u0080\u009cdear dad and gossip,\u00e2\u0080\u009d King James. A\nsingular fate attended this accomplished courtier, in being at once\nthe reigning favourite of a father and son so very opposite in manners,\nthat, to ingratiate himself with the youthful Prince, he was obliged\nto compress within the strictest limits of respectful observance the\nfrolicsome and free humour which captivated his aged father.\n\nIt is true, Buckingham well knew the different dispositions both of\nJames and Charles, and had no difficulty in so conducting himself as\nto maintain the highest post in the favour of both. It has indeed been\nsupposed, as we before hinted, that the duke, when he had completely\npossessed himself of the affections of Charles, retained his hold in\nthose of the father only by the tyranny of custom; and that James,\ncould he have brought himself to form a vigorous resolution, was, in\nthe latter years of his life especially, not unlikely to have discarded\nBuckingham from his counsels and favour. But if ever the king indeed\nmeditated such a change, he was too timid, and too much accustomed to\nthe influence which the duke had long exercised over him, to summon up\nresolution enough for effecting such a purpose; and at all events it\nis certain, that Buckingham, though surviving the master by whom he was\nraised, had the rare chance to experience no wane of the most splendid\ncourt-favour during two reigns, until it was at once eclipsed in his\nblood by the dagger of his assassin Felton.\n\nTo return from this digression: The Prince, with his train, advanced,\nand were near the place where Lord Glenvarloch and Sir Mungo had stood\naside, according to form, in order to give the Prince passage, and\nto pay the usual marks of respect. Nigel could now remark that Lord\nDalgarno walked close behind the Duke of Buckingham, and, as he thought,\nwhispered something in his ear as they came onward. At any rate, both\nthe Prince's and Duke of Buckingham's attention seemed to be directed\nby such circumstance towards Nigel, for they turned their heads in that\ndirection and looked at him attentively--the Prince with a countenance,\nthe grave, melancholy expression of which was blended with severity;\nwhile Buckingham's looks evinced some degree of scornful triumph.\nLord Dalgarno did not seem to observe his friend, perhaps because the\nsunbeams fell from the side of the walk on which Nigel stood, obliging\nMalcolm to hold up his hat to screen his eyes.\n\nAs the Prince passed, Lord Glenvarloch and Sir Mungo bowed, as respect\nrequired; and the Prince, returning their obeisance with that grave\nceremony which paid to every rank its due, but not a tittle beyond\nit, signed to Sir Mungo to come forward. Commencing an apology for his\nlameness as he started, which he had just completed as his hobbling gait\nbrought him up to the Prince, Sir Mungo lent an attentive, and, as it\nseemed, an intelligent ear, to questions, asked in a tone so low, that\nthe knight would certainly have been deaf to them had they been put to\nhim by any one under the rank of Prince of Wales. After about a minute's\nconversation, the Prince bestowed on Nigel the embarrassing notice of\nanother fixed look, touched his hat slightly to Sir Mungo, and walked\non.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is even as I suspected, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Mungo, with an air\nwhich he designed to be melancholy and sympathetic, but which, in\nfact, resembled the grin of an ape when he has mouthed a scalding\nchestnut--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe have back-friends, my lord, that is, unfriends--or, to be\nplain, enemies--about the person of the Prince.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sorry to hear it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I would I knew what they\naccuse me of.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe shall hear, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Mungo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Prince's vera words--'Sir\nMungo,' said he, 'I rejoice to see you, and am glad your rheumatic\ntroubles permit you to come hither for exercise.'--I bowed, as in duty\nbound--ye might remark, my lord, that I did so, whilk formed the first\nbranch of our conversation.--His Highness then demanded of me, 'if he\nwith whom I stood, was the young Lord Glenvarloch.' I answered, 'that\nyou were such, for his Highness's service;' whilk was the second\nbranch.--Thirdly, his Highness, resuming the argument, said, that 'truly\nhe had been told so,' (meaning that he had been told you were that\npersonage,) 'but that he could not believe, that the heir of that noble\nand decayed house could be leading an idle, scandalous, and precarious\nlife, in the eating-houses and taverns of London, while the king's\ndrums were beating, and colours flying in Germany in the cause of the\nPalatine, his son-in-law.'--I could, your lordship is aware, do nothing\nbut make an obeisance; and a gracious 'Give ye good-day, Sir Mungo\nMalagrowther,' licensed me to fall back to your lordship. And now,\nmy lord, if your business or pleasure calls you to the ordinary,\nor anywhere in the direction of the city--why, have with you; for,\ndootless, ye will think ye have tarried lang enough in the Park, as they\nwill likely turn at the head of the walk, and return this way--and you\nhave a broad hint, I think, not to cross the Prince's presence in a\nhurry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_You_ may stay or go as you please, Sir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, with an\nexpression of calm, but deep resentment; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut, for my own part, my\nresolution is taken. I will quit this public walk for pleasure of no\nman--still less will I quit it like one unworthy to be seen in places of\npublic resort. I trust that the Prince and his retinue will return this\nway as you expect; for I will abide, Sir Mungo, and beard them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBeard them!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Sir Mungo, in the extremity of surprise,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cBeard\nthe Prince of Wales--the heir-apparent of the kingdoms!--By my saul, you\nshall beard him yourself then.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAccordingly, he was about to leave Nigel very hastily, when some\nunwonted touch of good-natured interest in his youth and experience,\nseemed suddenly to soften his habitual cynicism.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe devil is in me for an auld fule!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Mungo; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I must\nneeds concern mysell--I that owe so little either to fortune or\nmy fellow-creatures, must, I say, needs concern mysell--with this\nspringald, whom I will warrant to be as obstinate as a pig possessed\nwith a devil, for it's the cast of his family; and yet I maun e'en\nfling away some sound advice on him.--My dainty young Lord Glenvarloch,\nunderstand me distinctly, for this is no bairn's-play. When the Prince\nsaid sae much to me as I have repeated to you, it was equivalent to\na command not to appear in his presence; wherefore take an auld man's\nadvice that wishes you weel, and maybe a wee thing better than he has\nreason to wish ony body. Jouk, and let the jaw gae by, like a canny\nbairn--gang hame to your lodgings, keep your foot frae taverns, and your\nfingers frae the dice-box; compound your affairs quietly wi' some ane\nthat has better favour than yours about Court, and you will get a round\nspell of money to carry you to Germany, or elsewhere, to push your\nfortune. It was a fortunate soldier that made your family four or five\nhundred years syne, and, if you are brave and fortunate, you may find\nthe way to repair it. But, take my word for it, that in this Court you\nwill never thrive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen Sir Mungo had completed his exhortation, in which there was more of\nsincere sympathy with another's situation, than he had been heretofore\nknown to express in behalf of any one, Lord Glenvarloch replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am\nobliged to you, Sir Mungo--you have spoken, I think, with sincerity, and\nI thank you. But in return for your good advice, I heartily entreat you\nto leave me; I observe the Prince and his train are returning down the\nwalk, and you may prejudice yourself, but cannot help me, by remaining\nwith me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that is true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--said Sir Mungo; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyet, were I ten years younger,\nI would be tempted to stand by you, and gie them the meeting. But at\nthreescore and upward, men's courage turns cauldrife; and they that\ncanna win a living, must not endanger the small sustenance of their\nage. I wish you weel through, my lord, but it is an unequal fight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So\nsaying, he turned and limped away; often looking back, however, as if\nhis natural spirit, even in its present subdued state, aided by his\nlove of contradiction and of debate, rendered him unwilling to adopt the\ncourse necessary for his own security.\n\nThus abandoned by his companion, whose departure he graced with better\nthoughts of him than those which he bestowed on his appearance, Nigel\nremained with his arms folded, and reclining against a solitary tree\nwhich overhung the path, making up his mind to encounter a moment which\nhe expected to be critical of his fate. But he was mistaken in supposing\nthat the Prince of Wales would either address him, or admit him to\nexpostulation, in such a public place as the Park. He did not remain\nunnoticed, however, for, when he made a respectful but haughty\nobeisance, intimating in look and manner that he was possessed of, and\nundaunted by, the unfavourable opinion which the Prince had so lately\nexpressed, Charles returned his reverence with such a frown, as is only\ngiven by those whose frown is authority and decision. The train passed\non, the Duke of Buckingham not even appearing to see Lord Glenvarloch;\nwhile Lord Dalgarno, though no longer incommoded by the sunbeams, kept\nhis eyes, which had perhaps been dazzled by their former splendour, bent\nupon the ground.\n\nLord Glenvarloch had difficulty to restrain an indignation, to which,\nin the circumstances, it would have been madness to have given vent. He\nstarted from his reclining posture, and followed the Prince's train so\nas to keep them distinctly in sight; which was very easy, as they walked\nslowly. Nigel observed them keep their road towards the Palace, where\nthe Prince turned at the gate and bowed to the noblemen in attendance,\nin token of dismissing them, and entered the Palace, accompanied only by\nthe Duke of Buckingham, and one or two of his equerries. The rest of\nthe train, having returned in all dutiful humility the farewell of the\nPrince, began to disperse themselves through the Park.\n\nAll this was carefully noticed by Lord Glenvarloch, who, as he adjusted\nhis cloak, and drew his sword-belt round so as to bring the hilt closer\nto his hand, muttered--\u00e2\u0080\u009cDalgarno shall explain all this to me, for it is\nevident that he is in the secret!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\n  Give way--give way--I must and will have justice.\n  And tell me not of privilege and place;\n  Where I am injured, there I'll sue redress.\n  Look to it, every one who bars my access;\n  I have a heart to feel the injury,\n  A hand to night myself, and, by my honour,\n  That hand shall grasp what grey-beard Law denies me.\n                                _The Chamberlain._\n\nIt was not long ere Nigel discovered Lord Dalgarno advancing towards him\nin the company of another young man of quality of the Prince's train;\nand as they directed their course towards the south-eastern corner of\nthe Park, he concluded they were about to go to Lord Huntinglen's. They\nstopped, however, and turned up another path leading to the north; and\nLord Glenvarloch conceived that this change of direction was owing to\ntheir having seen him, and their desire to avoid him.\n\nNigel followed them without hesitation by a path which, winding around\na thicket of shrubs and trees, once more conducted him to the less\nfrequented part of the Park. He observed which side of the thicket\nwas taken by Lord Dalgarno and his companion, and he himself, walking\nhastily round the other verge, was thus enabled to meet them face to\nface.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-morrow, my Lord Dalgarno,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, sternly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHa! my friend Nigel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lord Dalgarno, in his usual careless and\nindifferent tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy friend Nigel, with business on his brow?--but you\nmust wait till we meet at Beaujeu's at noon--Sir Ewes Haldimund and I\nare at present engaged in the Prince's service.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you were engaged in the king's, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cyou must stand and answer me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey-day!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno, with an air of great astonishment, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat\npassion is this? Why, Nigel, this is King Cambyses' vein!--You have\nfrequented the theatres too much lately--Away with this folly, man; go,\ndine upon soup and salad, drink succory-water to cool your blood, go to\nbed at sun-down, and defy those foul fiends, Wrath and Misconstruction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have had misconstruction enough among you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Glenvarloch, in the\nsame tone of determined displeasure, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand from you, my Lord Dalgarno, in\nparticular, and all under the mask of friendship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere is a proper business!\u00e2\u0080\u009d--said Dalgarno, turning as if to appeal to\nSir Ewes Haldimund; \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo you see this angry ruffler, Sir Ewes? A month\nsince, he dared not have looked one of yonder sheep in the face, and\nnow he is a prince of roisterers, a plucker of pigeons, a controller of\nplayers and poets--and in gratitude for my having shown him the way\nto the eminent character which he holds upon town, he comes hither to\nquarrel with his best friend, if not his only one of decent station.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI renounce such hollow friendship, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\ndisclaim the character which, even to my very face, you labour to fix\nupon me, and ere we part I will call you to a reckoning for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lords both,\u00e2\u0080\u009d interrupted Sir Ewes Haldimund, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet me remind you that\nthe Royal Park is no place to quarrel in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will make my quarrel good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, who did not know, or in\nhis passion might not have recollected, the privileges of the place,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwherever I find my enemy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall find quarelling enough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Lord Dalgarno, calmly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cso\nsoon as you assign a sufficient cause for it. Sir Ewes Haldimund,\nwho knows the Court, will warrant you that I am not backward on such\noccasions.--But of what is it that you now complain, after having\nexperienced nothing save kindness from me and my family?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf your family I complain not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Lord Glenvarloch; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey have\ndone for me all they could, more, far more, than I could have expected;\nbut you, my lord, have suffered me, while you called me your friend, to\nbe traduced, where a word of your mouth would have placed my character\nin its true colours--and hence the injurious message which I just now\nreceived from the Prince of Wales. To permit the misrepresentation of a\nfriend, my lord, is to share in the slander.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have been misinformed, my Lord Glenvarloch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Ewes\nHaldimund; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have myself often heard Lord Dalgarno defend your\ncharacter, and regret that your exclusive attachment to the pleasures of\na London life prevented your paying your duty regularly to the King and\nPrince.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile he himself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdissuaded me from presenting\nmyself at Court.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will cut this matter short,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno, with haughty\ncoldness. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou seem to have conceived, my lord, that you and I were\nPylades and Orestes--a second edition of Damon and Pythias--Theseus and\nPirithoiis at the least. You are mistaken, and have given the name of\nfriendship to what, on my part, was mere good-nature and compassion for\na raw and ignorant countryman, joined to the cumbersome charge which my\nfather gave me respecting you. Your character, my lord, is of no one's\ndrawing, but of your own making. I introduced you where, as in all such\nplaces, there was good and indifferent company to be met with--your\nhabits, or taste, made you prefer the worse. Your holy horror at the\nsight of dice and cards degenerated into the cautious resolution to play\nonly at those times, and with such persons, as might ensure your rising\na winner--no man can long do so, and continue to be held a gentleman.\nSuch is the reputation you have made for yourself, and you have no right\nto be angry that I do not contradict in society what yourself know to be\ntrue. Let us pass on, my lord; and if you want further explanation, seek\nsome other time and fitter place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo time can be better than the present,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, whose\nresentment was now excited to the uttermost by the cold-blooded and\ninsulting manner, in which Dalgarno vindicated himself,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cno place\nfitter than the place where we now stand. Those of my house have ever\navenged insult, at the moment, and on the spot, where it was offered,\nwere it at the foot of the throne.--Lord Dalgarno, you are a villain!\ndraw and defend yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At the same moment he unsheathed his rapier.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you mad?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno, stepping back; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe are in the\nprecincts of the Court.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe better,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lord Glenvarloch; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will cleanse them from a\ncalumniator and a coward.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He then pressed on Lord Dalgarno, and struck\nhim with the flat of the sword.\n\nThe fray had now attracted attention, and the cry went round, \u00e2\u0080\u009cKeep\nthe peace--keep the peace--swords drawn in the Park!--What, ho!\nguards!--keepers--yeomen--rangers!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and a number of people came rushing\nto the spot from all sides.\n\nLord Dalgarno, who had half drawn his sword on receiving the blow,\nreturned it to his scabbard when he observed the crowd thicken, and,\ntaking Sir Ewes Haldimund by the arm, walked hastily away, only saying\nto Lord Glenvarloch as they left him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall dearly abye this\ninsult--we will meet again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA decent-looking elderly man, who observed that Lord Glenvarloch\nremained on the spot, taking compassion on his youthful appearance,\nsaid to him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you aware that this is a Star-Chamber business, young\ngentleman, and that it may cost you your right hand?--Shift for yourself\nbefore the keepers or constables come up--Get into Whitefriars or\nsomewhere, for sanctuary and concealment, till you can make friends or\nquit the city.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe advice was not to be neglected. Lord Glenvarloch made hastily\ntowards the issue from the Park by Saint James's Palace, then Saint\nJames's Hospital. The hubbub increased behind him; and several\npeace-officers of the Royal Household came up to apprehend the\ndelinquent. Fortunately for Nigel, a popular edition of the cause of the\naffray had gone abroad. It was said that one of the Duke of Buckingham's\ncompanions had insulted a stranger gentleman from the country, and that\nthe stranger had cudgelled him soundly. A favourite, or the companion\nof a favourite, is always odious to John Bull, who has, besides, a\npartiality to those disputants who proceed, as lawyers term it, _par\nwye du fait_, and both prejudices were in Nigel's favour. The officers,\ntherefore, who came to apprehend him, could learn from the spectators no\nparticulars of his appearance, or information concerning the road he had\ntaken; so that, for the moment, he escaped being arrested.\n\nWhat Lord Glenvarloch heard among the crowd as he passed along, was\nsufficient to satisfy him, that in his impatient passion he had placed\nhimself in a predicament of considerable danger. He was no stranger\nto the severe and arbitrary proceedings of the Court of Star-Chamber,\nespecially in cases of breach of privilege, which made it the terror\nof all men; and it was no farther back than the Queen's time that the\npunishment of mutilation had been actually awarded and executed, for\nsome offence of the same kind which he had just committed. He had also\nthe comfortable reflection, that, by his violent quarrel with Lord\nDalgarno, he must now forfeit the friendship and good offices of that\nnobleman's father and sister, almost the only persons of consideration\nin whom he could claim any interest; while all the evil reports which\nhad been put in circulation concerning his character, were certain to\nweigh heavily against him, in a case where much must necessarily depend\non the reputation of the accused. To a youthful imagination, the idea\nof such a punishment as mutilation seems more ghastly than death itself;\nand every word which he overheard among the groups which he met, mingled\nwith, or overtook and passed, announced this as the penalty of his\noffence. He dreaded to increase his pace for fear of attracting\nsuspicion, and more than once saw the ranger's officers so near him,\nthat his wrist tingled as if already under the blade of the dismembering\nknife. At length he got out of the Park, and had a little more leisure\nto consider what he was next to do.\n\nWhitefriars, adjacent to the Temple, then well known by the cant name\nof Alsatia, had at this time, and for nearly a century afterwards, the\nprivilege of a sanctuary, unless against the writ of the Lord Chief\nJustice, or of the Lords of the Privy-Council. Indeed, as the place\nabounded with desperadoes of every description,--bankrupt citizens,\nruined gamesters, irreclaimable prodigals, desperate duellists, bravoes,\nhomicides, and debauched profligates of every description, all leagued\ntogether to maintain the immunities of their asylum,--it was both\ndifficult and unsafe for the officers of the law to execute warrants\nemanating even from the highest authority, amongst men whose safety\nwas inconsistent with warrants or authority of any kind. This Lord\nGlenvarloch well knew; and odious as the place of refuge was, it seemed\nthe only one where, for a space at least, he might be concealed and\nsecure from the immediate grasp of the law, until he should have leisure\nto provide better for his safety, or to get this unpleasant matter in\nsome shape accommodated.\n\nMeanwhile, as Nigel walked hastily forward towards the place of\nsanctuary, he bitterly blamed himself for suffering Lord Dalgarno\nto lead him into the haunts of dissipation; and no less accused his\nintemperate heat of passion, which now had driven him for refuge into\nthe purlieus of profane and avowed vice and debauchery.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDalgarno spoke but too truly in that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d were his bitter reflections; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nhave made myself an evil reputation by acting on his insidious counsels,\nand neglecting the wholesome admonitions which ought to have claimed\nimplicit obedience from me, and which recommended abstinence even\nfrom the slightest approach of evil. But if I escape from the perilous\nlabyrinth in which folly and inexperience, as well as violent passions,\nhave involved me, I will find some noble way of redeeming the lustre of\na name which was never sullied until I bore it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs Lord Glenvarloch formed these prudent resolutions, he entered the\nTemple Walks, whence a gate at that time opened into Whitefriars, by\nwhich, as by the more private passage, he proposed to betake himself to\nthe sanctuary. As he approached the entrance to that den of infamy, from\nwhich his mind recoiled even while in the act of taking shelter there,\nhis pace slackened, while the steep and broken stairs reminded him of\nthe _facilis_ descensus Averni, and rendered him doubtful whether it\nwere not better to brave the worst which could befall him in the public\nhaunts of honourable men, than to evade punishment by secluding himself\nin those of avowed vice and profligacy.\n\nAs Nigel hesitated, a young gentleman of the Temple advanced towards\nhim, whom he had often seen, and sometimes conversed with, at the\nordinary, where he was a frequent and welcome guest, being a wild\nyoung gallant, indifferently well provided with money, who spent at\nthe theatres and other gay places of public resort, the time which his\nfather supposed he was employing in the study of the law. But Reginald\nLowestoffe, such was the young Templar's name, was of opinion that\nlittle law was necessary to enable him to spend the revenues of the\npaternal acres which were to devolve upon him at his father's demose,\nand therefore gave himself no trouble to acquire more of that science\nthan might be imbibed along with the learned air of the region in which\nhe had his chambers. In other respects, he was one of the wits of the\nplace, read Ovid and Martial, aimed at quick repartee and pun, (often\nvery far fetched,) danced, fenced, played at tennis, and performed\nsundry tunes on the fiddle and French horn, to the great annoyance of\nold Counsellor Barratter, who lived in the chambers immediately below\nhim. Such was Reginald Lowes-toffe, shrewd, alert, and well-acquainted\nwith the town through all its recesses, but in a sort of disrespectable\nway. This gallant, now approaching the Lord Glenvarloch, saluted him by\nname and title, and asked if his lordship designed for the Chevalier's\nthis day, observing it was near noon, and the woodcock would be on the\nboard before they could reach the ordinary.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not go there to-day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lord Glenvarloch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhich way, then,\nmy lord?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young Templar, who was perhaps not undesirous to\nparade a part at least of the street in company with a lord, though but\na Scottish one.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI--I--\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, desiring to avail himself of this young man's local\nknowledge, yet unwilling and ashamed to acknowledge his intention to\ntake refuge in so disreputable a quarter, or to describe the situation\nin which he stood--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have some curiosity to see Whitefriars.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! your lordship is for a frolic into Alsatia?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nLowestoffe-\u00e2\u0080\u009c-Have with you, my lord--you cannot have a better guide to\nthe infernal regions than myself. I promise you there are bona-robas to\nbe found there--good wine too, ay, and good fellows to drink it with,\nthough somewhat suffering under the frowns of Fortune. But your lordship\nwill pardon me--you are the last of our acquaintance to whom I would\nhave proposed such a voyage of discovery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am obliged to you, Master Lowestoffe, for the good opinion you have\nexpressed in the observation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut my present\ncircumstances may render even a residence of a day or two in the\nsanctuary a matter of necessity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lowestoffe, in a tone of great surprise; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought your\nlordship had always taken care not to risk any considerable stake--I beg\npardon, but if the bones have proved perfidious, I know just so much\nlaw as that a peer's person is sacred from arrest; and for mere\nimpecuniosity, my lord, better shift can be made elsewhere than in\nWhitefriars, where all are devouring each other for very poverty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy misfortune has no connexion with want of money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, then, I suppose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lowestoffe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have been tilting,\nmy lord, and have pinked your man; in which case, and with a\npurse reasonably furnished, you may lie perdu in Whitefriars for a\ntwelvemonth--Marry, but you must be entered and received as a member of\ntheir worshipful society, my lord, and a frank burgher of Alsatia--so\nfar you must condescend; there will be neither peace nor safety for you\nelse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy fault is not in a degree so deadly, Master Lowestoffe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered\nLord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas you seem to conjecture--I have stricken a\ngentleman in the Park, that is all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my hand, my lord, and you had better have struck your sword through\nhim at Barns Elms,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Templar. \u00e2\u0080\u009cStrike within the verge of\nthe Court! You will find that a weighty dependence upon your hands,\nespecially if your party be of rank and have favour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will be plain with you, Master Lowestoffe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009csince I have\ngone thus far. The person I struck was Lord Dalgarno, whom you have seen\nat Beaujeu's.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA follower and favourite of the Duke of Buckingham!--It is a most\nunhappy chance, my lord; but my heart was formed in England, and cannot\nbear to see a young nobleman borne down, as you are like to be. We\nconverse here greatly too open for your circumstances. The Templars\nwould suffer no bailiff to execute a writ, and no gentleman to be\narrested for a duel, within their precincts; but in such a matter\nbetween Lord Dalgarno and your lordship, there might be a party on\neither side. You must away with me instantly to my poor chambers\nhere, hard by, and undergo some little change of dress, ere you take\nsanctuary; for else you will have the whole rascal rout of the Friars\nabout you, like crows upon a falcon that strays into their rookery. We\nmust have you arrayed something more like the natives of Alsatia, or\nthere will be no life there for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile Lowestoffe spoke, he pulled Lord Glenvarloch along with him into\nhis chambers, where he had a handsome library, filled with all the poems\nand play-books which were then in fashion. The Templar then dispatched a\nboy, who waited upon him, to procure a dish or two from the next cook's\nshop; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmust be your lordship's dinner, with a glass\nof old sack, of which my grandmother (the heavens requite her!) sent me\na dozen bottles, with charge to use the liquor only with clarified whey,\nwhen I felt my breast ache with over study. Marry, we will drink the\ngood lady's health in it, if it is your lordship's pleasure, and you\nshall see how we poor students eke out our mutton-commons in the hall.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe outward door of the chambers was barred so soon as the boy had\nre-entered with the food; the boy was ordered to keep close watch, and\nadmit no one; and Lowestoffe, by example and precept, pressed his noble\nguest to partake of his hospitality. His frank and forward manners,\nthough much differing from the courtly ease of Lord Dalgarno, were\ncalculated to make a favourable impression; and Lord Glenvarloch, though\nhis experience of Dalgarno's perfidy had taught him to be cautious of\nreposing faith in friendly professions, could not avoid testifying his\ngratitude to the young Templar, who seemed so anxious for his safety and\naccommodation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may spare your gratitude any great sense of obligation, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said the Templar. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo doubt I am willing to be of use to any gentleman\nthat has cause to sing _Fortune my foe_, and particularly proud to serve\nyour lordship's turn; but I have also an old grudge, to speak Heaven's\ntruth, at your opposite, Lord Dalgarno.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I ask on what account, Master Lowestoffe?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Templar, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit was for a hap that chanced after\nyou left the ordinary, one evening about three weeks since--at least I\nthink you were not by, as your lordship always left us before deep play\nbegan--I mean no offence, but such was your lordship's custom--when\nthere were words between Lord Dalgarno and me concerning a certain game\nat gleek, and a certain mournival of aces held by his lordship, which\nwent for eight--tib, which went for fifteen--twenty-three in all. Now I\nheld king and queen, being three--a natural towser, making fifteen--and\ntiddy, nineteen. We vied the ruff, and revied, as your lordship may\nsuppose, till the stake was equal to half my yearly exhibition, fifty as\nfair yellow canary birds as e'er chirped in the bottom of a green silk\npurse. Well, my lord, I gained the cards, and lo you! it pleases his\nlordship to say that we played without tiddy; and as the rest stood\nby and backed him, and especially the sharking Frenchman, why, I was\nobliged to lose more than I shall gain all the season.--So judge if I\nhave not a crow to pluck with his lordship. Was it ever heard there was\na game at gleek at the ordinary before, without counting tiddy?--marry\nquep upon his lordship!--Every man who comes there with his purse in his\nhand, is as free to make new laws as he, I hope, since touch pot touch\npenny makes every man equal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs Master Lowestoffe ran over this jargon of the gaming-table, Lord\nGlenvarloch was both ashamed and mortified, and felt a severe pang of\naristocratic pride, when he concluded in the sweeping clause that the\ndice, like the grave, levelled those distinguishing points of society,\nto which Nigel's early prejudices clung perhaps but too fondly. It was\nimpossible, however, to object any thing to the learned reasoning of\nthe young Templar, and therefore Nigel was contented to turn the\nconversation, by making some inquiries respecting the present state of\nWhite-friars. There also his host was at home.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Master Lowestoffe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat we Templars are a\npower and a dominion within ourselves, and I am proud to say that I hold\nsome rank in our republic--was treasurer to the Lord of Misrule last\nyear, and am at this present moment in nomination for that dignity\nmyself. In such circumstances, we are under the necessity of maintaining\nan amicable intercourse with our neighbours of Alsatia, even as the\nChristian States find themselves often, in mere policy, obliged to make\nalliance with the Grand Turk, or the Barbary States.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should have imagined you gentlemen of the Temple more independent of\nyour neighbours,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou do us something too much honour, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Templar; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe\nAlsatians and we have some common enemies, and we have, under the rose,\nsome common friends. We are in the use of blocking all bailiffs out of\nour bounds, and we are powerfully aided by our neighbours, who tolerate\nnot a rag belonging to them within theirs. Moreover the Alsatians\nhave--I beg you to understand me--the power of protecting or distressing\nour friends, male or female, who may be obliged to seek sanctuary within\ntheir bounds. In short, the two communities serve each other, though the\nleague is between states of unequal quality, and I may myself say, that\nI have treated of sundry weighty affairs, and have been a negotiator\nwell approved on both sides.--But hark--hark--what is that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe sound by which Master Lowestoffe was interrupted, was that of a\ndistant horn, winded loud and keenly, and followed by a faint and remote\nhuzza.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is something doing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lowestoffe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin the Whitefriars at this\nmoment. That is the signal when their privileges are invaded by tipstaff\nor bailiff; and at the blast of the horn they all swarm out to the\nrescue, as bees when their hive is disturbed.--Jump, Jim,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid, calling out to the attendant, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand see what they are doing in\nAlsatia.--That bastard of a boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, as the lad, accustomed\nto the precipitate haste of his master, tumbled rather than ran out of\nthe apartment, and so down stairs, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis worth gold in this quarter--he\nserves six masters--four of them in distinct Numbers, and you would\nthink him present like a fairy at the mere wish of him that for the time\nmost needs his attendance. No scout in Oxford, no gip in Cambridge, ever\nmatched him in speed and intelligence. He knows the step of a dun from\nthat of a client, when it reaches the very bottom of the staircase; can\ntell the trip of a pretty wench from the step of a bencher, when at\nthe upper end of the court; and is, take him all in all--But I see your\nlordship is anxious--May I press another cup of my kind grandmother's\ncordial, or will you allow me to show you my wardrobe, and act as your\nvalet or groom of the chamber?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLord Glenvarloch hesitated not to acknowledge that he was painfully\nsensible of his present situation, and anxious to do what must needs be\ndone for his extrication.\n\nThe good-natured and thoughtless young Templar readily acquiesced,\nand led the way into his little bedroom, where, from bandboxes,\nportmanteaus, mail-trunks, not forgetting an old walnut-tree wardrobe,\nhe began to select the articles which he thought best suited effectually\nto disguise his guest in venturing into the lawless and turbulent\nsociety of Alsatia.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\n Come hither, young one,--Mark me! Thou art now\n 'Mongst men o' the sword, that live by reputation\n More than by constant income--Single-suited\n They are, I grant you; yet each single suit\n Maintains, on the rough guess, a thousand followers--\n And they be men, who, hazarding their all,\n Needful apparel, necessary income,\n And human body, and immortal soul,\n Do in the very deed but hazard nothing-- So strictly is that ALL bound in reversion;\n Clothes to the broker, income to the usurer,\n And body to disease, and soul to the foul fiend;\n Who laughs to see Soldadoes and Fooladoes,\n Play better than himself his game on earth.\n                                        _The Mohocks._\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour lordship,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Reginald Lowestoffe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmust be content to exchange\nyour decent and court-beseeming rapier, which I will retain in safe\nkeeping, for this broadsword, with an hundredweight of rusty iron about\nthe hilt, and to wear these huge-paned slops, instead of your civil\nand moderate hose. We allow no cloak, for your ruffian always walks in\n_cuerpo_; and the tarnished doublet of bald velvet, with its discoloured\nembroidery, and--I grieve to speak it--a few stains from the blood of\nthe grape, will best suit the garb of a roaring boy. I will leave you to\nchange your suit for an instant, till I can help to truss you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLowestoffe retired, while slowly, and with hesitation, Nigel obeyed\nhis instructions. He felt displeasure and disgust at the scoundrelly\ndisguise which he was under the necessity of assuming; but when he\nconsidered the bloody consequences which law attached to his rash act\nof violence, the easy and indifferent temper of James, the prejudices of\nhis son, the overbearing influence of the Duke of Buckingham, which was\nsure to be thrown into the scale against him; and, above all, when\nhe reflected that he must now look upon the active, assiduous, and\ninsinuating Lord Dalgarno, as a bitter enemy, reason told him he was in\na situation of peril which authorised all honest means, even the most\nunseemly in outward appearance, to extricate himself from so dangerous a\npredicament.\n\nWhile he was changing his dress, and musing on these particulars, his\nfriendly host re-entered the sleeping apartment--\u00e2\u0080\u009cZounds!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy\nlord, it was well you went not straight into that same Alsatia of ours\nat the time you proposed, for the hawks have stooped upon it. Here\nis Jem come back with tidings, that he saw a pursuivant there with a\nprivy-council warrant, and half a score of yeomen assistants, armed to\nthe teeth, and the horn which we heard was sounded to call out the posse\nof the Friars. Indeed, when old Duke Hildebrod saw that the quest was\nafter some one of whom he knew nothing, he permitted, out of courtesy,\nthe man-catcher to search through his dominions, quite certain that\nthey would take little by their motions; for Duke Hildebrod is a most\njudicious potentate.--Go back, you bastard, and bring us word when all\nis quiet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd who may Duke Hildebrod be?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNouns! my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Templar, \u00e2\u0080\u009chave you lived so long on the town,\nand never heard of the valiant, and as wise and politic as valiant, Duke\nHildebrod, grand protector of the liberties of Alsatia? I thought the\nman had never whirled a die but was familiar with his fame.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYet I have never heard of him, Master Lowestoffe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord\nGlenvarloch; \u00e2\u0080\u009cor, what is the same thing, I have paid no attention to\naught that may have passed in conversation respecting him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lowestoffe--\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut, first, let me have the honour of\ntrussing you. Now, observe, I have left several of the points untied, of\nset purpose; and if it please you to let a small portion of your shirt\nbe seen betwixt your doublet and the band of your upper stock, it will\nhave so much the more rakish effect, and will attract you respect in\nAlsatia, where linen is something scarce. Now, I tie some of the\npoints carefully asquint, for your ruffianly gallant never appears too\naccurately trussed--so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cArrange it as you will, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut let me hear at least\nsomething of the conditions of the unhappy district into which, with\nother wretches, I am compelled to retreat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Templar, \u00e2\u0080\u009cour neighbouring state of Alsatia,\nwhich the law calls the Sanctuary of White-friars, has had its mutations\nand revolutions like greater kingdoms; and, being in some sort a\nlawless, arbitrary government, it follows, of course, that these have\nbeen more frequent than our own better regulated commonwealth of the\nTemplars, that of Gray's Inn, and other similar associations, have\nhad the fortune to witness. Our traditions and records speak of twenty\nrevolutions within the last twelve years, in which the aforesaid state\nhas repeatedly changed from absolute despotism to republicanism, not\nforgetting the intermediate stages of oligarchy, limited monarchy, and\neven gynocracy; for I myself remember Alsatia governed for nearly nine\nmonths by an old fish-woman. 'I hen it fell under the dominion of a\nbroken attorney, who was dethroned by a reformado captain, who, proving\ntyrannical, was deposed by a hedgeparson, who was succeeded, upon\nresignation of his power, by Duke Jacob Hildebrod, of that name the\nfirst, whom Heaven long preserve.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd is this potentate's government,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, forcing\nhimself to take some interest in the conversation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cof a despotic\ncharacter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPardon me, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Templar; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis said sovereign is too\nwise to incur, like many of his predecessors, the odium of wielding\nso important an authority by his own sole will. He has established a\ncouncil of state, who regularly meet for their morning's draught\nat seven o'clock; convene a second time at eleven for their\n_ante-meridiem_, or whet; and, assembling in solemn conclave at the\nhour of two afternoon, for the purpose of consulting for the good of\nthe commonwealth, are so prodigal of their labour in the service of\nthe state, that they seldom separate before midnight. Into this worthy\nsenate, composed partly of Duke Hildebrod's predecessors in his high\noffice, whom he has associated with him to prevent the envy attending\nsovereign and sole authority, I must presently introduce your lordship,\nthat they may admit you to the immunities of the Friars, and assign you\na place of residence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoes their authority extend to such regulation?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe council account it a main point of their privileges, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered Lowestoffe; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand, in fact, it is one of the most powerful means\nby which they support their authority. For when Duke Ilildebrod and his\nsenate find a topping householder in the Friars becomes discontented and\nfactious, it is but assigning him, for a lodger, some fat bankrupt, or\nnew lesidenter, whose circumstances require refuge, and whose purse can\npay for it, and the malecontent becomes as tractable as a lamb. As\nfor the poorer refugees, they let them shift as they can; but the\nregistration of their names in the Duke's entry-book, and the payment of\ngarnish conforming to their circumstances, is never dispensed with; and\nthe Friars would be a very unsafe residence for the stranger who should\ndispute these points of jurisdiction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Master Lowestoffe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must be controlled\nby the circumstances which dictate to me this state of concealment--of\ncourse, I am desirous not to betray my name and rank.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will be highly advisable, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lowestoffe; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand is a\ncase thus provided for in the statutes of the republic, or monarchy, or\nwhatsoever you call it.--He who desires that no questions shall be asked\nhim concerning his name, cause of refuge, and the like, may escape\nthe usual interrogations upon payment of double the garnish otherwise\nbelonging to his condition. Complying with this essential stipulation,\nyour lordship may register yourself as King of Bantam if you will, for\nnot a question will be asked of you.--But here comes our scout, with\nnews of peace and tranquillity. Now, I will go with your lordship\nmyself, and present you to the council of Alsatia, with all the\ninfluence which I have over them as an office-bearer in the Temple,\nwhich is not slight; for they have come halting off upon all occasions\nwhen we have taken part against them, and that they well know. The time\nis propitious, for as the council is now met in Alsatia, so the Temple\nwalks are quiet. Now, my lord, throw your cloak about you, to hide your\npresent exterior. You shall give it to the boy at the foot of the stairs\nthat go down to the Sanctuary; and as the ballad says that Queen Eleanor\nsunk at Charing Cross and rose at Queenhithe, so you shall sink a\nnobleman in the Temple Gardens, and rise an Alsatian at Whitefriars.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey went out accordingly, attended by the little scout, traversed\nthe gardens, descended the stairs, and at the bottom the young Templar\nexclaimed,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now let us sing, with Ovid,\n\n     'In nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas--'\n\nOff, off, ye lendings!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, in the same vein. \u00e2\u0080\u009cVia, the\ncurtain that shadowed Borgia!--But how now, my lord?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued,\nwhen he observed Lord Glenvarloch was really distressed at the degrading\nchange in his situation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI trust you are not offended at my rattling\nfolly? I would but reconcile you to your present circumstances, and give\nyou the tone of this strange place. Come, cheer up; I trust it will only\nbe your residence for a very few days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNigel was only able to press his hand, and reply in a whisper, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am\nsensible of your kindness. I know I must drink the cup which my own\nfolly has filled for me. Pardon me, that, at the first taste, I feel its\nbitterness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nReginald Lowestoffe was bustlingly officious and good-natured; but,\nused to live a scrambling, rakish course of life himself, he had not the\nleast idea of the extent of Lord Glenvarloch's mental sufferings, and\nthought of his temporary concealment as if it were merely the trick of\na wanton boy, who plays at hide-and-seek with his tutor. With the\nappearance of the place, too, he was familiar--but on his companion it\nproduced a deep sensation.\n\nThe ancient Sanctuary at Whitefriars lay considerably lower than the\nelevated terraces and gardens of the Temple, and was therefore generally\ninvolved in the damps and fogs arising from the Thames. The brick\nbuildings by which it was occupied, crowded closely on each other, for,\nin a place so rarely privileged, every foot of ground was valuable; but,\nerected in many cases by persons whose funds were inadequate to their\nspeculations, the houses were generally insufficient, and exhibited the\nlamentable signs of having become ruinous while they were yet new.\nThe wailing of children, the scolding of their mothers, the miserable\nexhibition of ragged linens hung from the windows to dry, spoke the\nwants and distresses of the wretched inhabitants; while the sounds of\ncomplaint were mocked and overwhelmed in the riotous shouts, oaths,\nprofane songs, and boisterous laughter, that issued from the alehouses\nand taverns, which, as the signs indicated, were equal in number to all\nthe other houses; and, that the full character of the place might be\nevident, several faded, tinselled and painted females, looked boldly at\nthe strangers from their open lattices, or more modestly seemed busied\nwith the cracked flower-pots, filled with mignonette and rosemary,\nwhich were disposed in front of the windows, to the great risk of the\npassengers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Semi-reducta Venus_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Templar, pointing to one of these\nnymphs, who seemed afraid of observation, and partly concealed herself\nbehind the casement, as she chirped to a miserable blackbird, the tenant\nof a wicker prison, which hung outside on the black brick wall.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nknow the face of yonder waistcoateer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the guide; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I could\nwager a rose-noble, from the posture she stands in, that she has clean\nhead-gear and a soiled night-rail.--But here come two of the male\ninhabitants, smoking like moving volcanoes! These are roaring blades,\nwhom Nicotia and Trinidado serve, I dare swear, in lieu of beef and\npudding; for be it known to you, my lord, that the king's counter-blast\nagainst the Indian weed will no more pass current in Alsatia than will\nhis writ of _capias_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs he spoke, the two smokers approached; shaggy, uncombed ruffians,\nwhose enormous mustaches were turned back over their ears, and mingled\nwith the wild elf-locks of their hair, much of which was seen under\nthe old beavers which they wore aside upon their heads, while some\nstraggling portion escaped through the rents of the hats aforesaid.\nTheir tarnished plush jerkins, large slops, or trunk-breeches, their\nbroad greasy shoulder-belts, and discoloured scarfs, and, above all, the\nostentatious manner in which the one wore a broad-sword and the other an\nextravagantly long rapier and poniard, marked the true Alsatian bully,\nthen, and for a hundred years afterwards, a well-known character.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTour out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the one ruffian to the other; \u00e2\u0080\u009ctour the bien mort\ntwiring at the gentry cove!\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Footnote: Look sharp. See how the girl is\ncoquetting with the strange gallants!]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI smell a spy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the other, looking at Nigel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChalk him across\nthe peepers with your cheery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Footnote: Slash him over the eyes with\nyour dagger.]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBing avast, bing avast!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied his companion; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyon other is rattling\nReginald Lowestoffe of the Temple--I know him; he is a good boy, and\nfree of the province.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, and enveloping themselves in another thick cloud of smoke,\nthey went on without farther greeting.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Grasso in aere_!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Templar. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou hear what a character the\nimpudent knave gives me; but, so it serves your lordship's turn, I care\nnot.--And, now, let me ask your lordship what name you will assume, for\nwe are near the ducal palace of Duke Hildebrod.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will be called Grahame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit was my mother's name.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGrime,\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated the Templar, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill suit Alsatia well enough--both a\ngrim and grimy place of refuge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI said Grahame, sir, not Grime,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, something shortly, and\nlaying an emphasis on the vowel--for few Scotsmen understand raillery\nupon the subject of their names.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI beg pardon, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the undisconcerted punster; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut\n_Graam_ will suit the circumstance, too--it signifies tribulation in\nthe High Dutch, and your lordship must be considered as a man under\ntrouble.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNigel laughed at the pertinacity of the Templar; who, proceeding to\npoint out a sign representing, or believed to represent, a dog attacking\na bull, and running at his head, in the true scientific style of\nonset,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoth faithful Duke Hildebrod deal forth laws,\nas well as ale and strong waters, to his faithful Alsatians. Being a\ndetermined champion of Paris Garden, he has chosen a sign corresponding\nto his habits; and he deals in giving drink to the thirsty, that he\nhimself may drink without paying, and receive pay for what is drunken by\nothers.--Let us enter the ever-open gate of this second Axylus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs they spoke, they entered the dilapidated tavern, which was,\nnevertheless, more ample in dimensions, and less ruinous, than many\nhouses in the same evil neighbourhood. Two or three haggard, ragged\ndrawers, ran to and fro, whose looks, like those of owls, seemed only\nadapted for midnight, when other creatures sleep, and who by day seemed\nbleared, stupid, and only half awake. Guided by one of these blinking\nGanymedes, they entered a room, where the feeble rays of the sun were\nalmost wholly eclipsed by volumes of tobacco-smoke, rolled from the\ntubes of the company, while out of the cloudy sanctuary arose the old\nchant of--\n\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009cOld Sir Simon the King,\n       And old Sir Simon the King,\n       With his malmsey nose,\n       And his ale-dropped hose,\n       And sing hey ding-a-ding-ding.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDuke Hildebrod, who himself condescended to chant this ditty to his\nloving subjects, was a monstrously fat old man, with only one eye; and\na nose which bore evidence to the frequency, strength, and depth of\nhis potations. He wore a murrey-coloured plush jerkin, stained with the\noverflowings of the tankard, and much the worse for wear, and unbuttoned\nat bottom for the ease of his enormous paunch. Behind him lay a\nfavourite bull-dog, whose round head and single black glancing eye, as\nwell as the creature's great corpulence, gave it a burlesque resemblance\nto its master.\n\nThe well-beloved counsellors who surrounded the ducal throne, incensed\nit with tobacco, pledged its occupier in thick clammy ale, and echoed\nback his choral songs, were Satraps worthy of such a Soldan. The buff\njerkin, broad belt, and long sword of one, showed him to be a Low\nCountry soldier, whose look of scowling importance, and drunken\nimpudence, were designed to sustain his title to call himself a Roving\nBlade. It seemed to Nigel that he had seen this fellow somewhere or\nother. A hedge-parson, or buckle-beggar, as that order of priesthood\nhas been irreverently termed, sat on the Duke's left, and was easily\ndistinguished by his torn band, flapped hat, and the remnants of a rusty\ncassock. Beside the parson sat a most wretched and meagre-looking old\nman, with a threadbare hood of coarse kersey upon his head, and buttoned\nabout his neck, while his pinched features, like those of old Daniel,\nwere illuminated by\n\n                            --\u00e2\u0080\u009can eye,\n  Through the last look of dotage still cunning and sly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOn his left was placed a broken attorney, who, for some malpractices,\nhad been struck from the roll of practitioners, and who had nothing\nleft of his profession, except its roguery. One or two persons of\nless figure, amongst whom there was one face, which, like that of the\nsoldier, seemed not unknown to Nigel, though he could not recollect\nwhere he had seen it, completed the council-board of Jacob Duke\nHildebrod.\n\nThe strangers had full time to observe all this; for his grace the Duke,\nwhether irresistibly carried on by the full tide of harmony, or whether\nto impress the strangers with a proper idea of his consequence, chose\nto sing his ditty to an end before addressing them, though, during the\nwhole time, he closely scrutinized them with his single optic.\n\nWhen Duke Hildebrod had ended his song, he informed his Peers that a\nworthy officer of the Temple attended them, and commanded the captain\nand parson to abandon their easy chairs in behalf of the two strangers,\nwhom he placed on his right and left hand. The worthy representative of\nthe army and the church of Alsatia went to place themselves on a crazy\nform at the bottom of the table, which, ill calculated to sustain men\nof such weight, gave way under them, and the man of the sword and man of\nthe gown were rolled over each other on the floor, amidst the exulting\nshouts of the company. They arose in wrath, contending which should vent\nhis displeasure in the loudest and deepest oaths, a strife in which\nthe parson's superior acquaintance with theology enabled him greatly to\nexcel the captain, and were at length with difficulty tranquillised by\nthe arrival of the alarmed waiters with more stable chairs, and by a\nlong draught of the cooling tankard. When this commotion was appeased,\nand the strangers courteously accommodated with flagons, after the\nfashion of the others present, the Duke drank prosperity to the Temple\nin the most gracious manner, together with a cup of welcome to Master\nReginald Lowestoffe; and, this courtesy having been thankfully accepted,\nthe party honoured prayed permission to call for a gallon of Rhenish,\nover which he proposed to open his business.\n\nThe mention of a liquor so superior to their usual potations had an\ninstant and most favourable effect upon the little senate; and its\nimmediate appearance might be said to secure a favourable reception\nof Master Lowestoffe's proposition, which, after a round or two had\ncirculated, he explained to be the admission of his friend Master Nigel\nGrahame to the benefit of the sanctuary and other immunities of Alsatia,\nin the character of a grand compounder; for so were those termed who\npaid a double fee at their matriculation, in order to avoid laying\nbefore the senate the peculiar circumstances which compelled them to\ntake refuge there.\n\nThe worthy Duke heard the proposition with glee, which glittered in his\nsingle eye; and no wonder, as it was a rare occurrence, and of peculiar\nadvantage to his private revenue. Accordingly, he commanded his ducal\nregister to be brought him, a huge book, secured with brass clasps like\na merchant's ledger, and whose leaves, stained with wine, and slabbered\nwith tobacco juice, bore the names probably of as many rogues as are to\nbe found in the Calendar of Newgate.\n\nNigel was then directed to lay down two nobles as his ransom, and to\nclaim privilege by reciting the following doggerel verses, which were\ndictated to him by the Duke:--\n\n        \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour suppliant, by name\n         Nigel Grahame,\n         In fear of mishap\n         From a shoulder-tap;\n         And dreading a claw\n         From the talons of law,\n          That are sharper than briers:\n         His freedom to sue,\n         And rescue by you--\n         Thorugh weapon and wit,\n         From warrant and writ,\n         From bailiff's hand,\n         From tipstaff's wand,\n          Is come hither to Whitefriars.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs Duke Hildebrod with a tremulous hand began to make the entry, and had\nalready, with superfluous generosity, spelled Nigel with two g's instead\nof one, he was interrupted by the parson. [Footnote: This curious\nregister is still in existence, being in possession of that eminent\nantiquary, Dr. Dryasdust, who liberally offered the author permission to\nhave the autograph of Duke Hildebrod engraved as an illustration of this\npassage. Unhappily, being rigorous as Ritson himself in adhering to the\nvery letter of his copy, the worthy Doctor clogged his munificence with\nthe condition that we should adopt the Duke's orthography, and entitle\nthe work \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Fortunes of Niggle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with which stipulation we did\nnot think it necessary to comply.] This reverend gentleman had been\nwhispering for a minute or two, not with the captain, but with that\nother individual, who dwelt imperfectly, as we have already mentioned,\nin Nigel's memory, and being, perhaps, still something malecontent on\naccount of the late accident, he now requested to be heard before the\nregistration took place.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe person,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho hath now had the assurance to propose\nhimself as a candidate for the privileges and immunities of this\nhonourable society, is, in plain terms, a beggarly Scot, and we have\nenough of these locusts in London already--if we admit such palmer-worms\nand caterpillars to the Sanctuary, we shall soon have the whole nation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are not entitled to inquire,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Duke Hildebrod, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhether he be\nScot, or French, or English; seeing he has honourably laid down his\ngarnish, he is entitled to our protection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWord of denial, most Sovereign Duke,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the parson, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI ask him no\nquestions--his speech betrayeth him--he is a Galilean--and his garnish\nis forfeited for his assurance in coming within this our realm; and I\ncall on you, Sir Duke, to put the laws in force against him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Templar here rose, and was about to interrupt the deliberations of\nthe court, when the Duke gravely assured him that he should be heard\nin behalf of his friend, so soon as the council had finished their\ndeliberations.\n\nThe attorney next rose, and, intimating that he was to speak to the\npoint of law, said--\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was easy to be seen that this gentleman did not\ncome here in any civil case, and that he believed it to be the story\nthey had already heard of concerning a blow given within the verge of\nthe Park--that the Sanctuary would not bear out the offender in such\ncase--and that the queer old Chief would send down a broom which would\nsweep the streets of Alsatia from the Strand to the Stairs; and it\nwas even policy to think what evil might come to their republic, by\nsheltering an alien in such circumstances.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe captain, who had sat impatiently while these opinions were\nexpressed, now sprung on his feet with the vehemence of a cork bouncing\nfrom a bottle of brisk beer, and, turning up his mustaches with a\nmartial air, cast a glance of contempt on the lawyer and churchman,\nwhile he thus expressed his opinion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMost noble Duke Hildebrod! When I hear such base, skeldering, coistril\npropositions come from the counsellors of your grace, and when I\nremember the Huffs, the Muns, and the Tityretu's by whom your grace's\nancestors and predecessors were advised on such occasions, I begin to\nthink the spirit of action is as dead in Alsatia as in my old grannam;\nand yet who thinks so thinks a lie, since I will find as many roaring\nboys in the Friars as shall keep the liberties against all the\nscavengers of Westminster. And, if we should be overborne for a turn,\ndeath and darkness! have we not time to send the gentleman off by water,\neither to Paris Garden or to the bankside? and, if he is a gallant of\ntrue breed, will he not make us full amends for all the trouble we have?\nLet other societies exist by the law, I say that we brisk boys of\nthe Fleet live in spite of it; and thrive best when we are in right\nopposition to sign and seal, writ and warrant, sergeant and tipstaff,\ncatchpoll, and bum-bailey.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis speech was followed by a murmur of approbation, and Lowestoffe,\nstriking in before the favourable sound had subsided, reminded the Duke\nand his council how much the security of their state depended upon the\namity of the Templars, who, by closing their gates, could at pleasure\nshut against the Alsatians the communication betwixt the Friars and the\nTemple, and that as they conducted themselves on this occasion, so would\nthey secure or lose the benefit of his interest with his own body, which\nthey knew not to be inconsiderable. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd, in respect of my friend being\na Scotsman and alien, as has been observed by the reverend divine and\nlearned lawyer, you are to consider,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lowestoffe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor what he is\npursued hither--why, for giving the bastinado, not to an Englishman, but\nto one of his own countrymen. And for my own simple part,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued,\ntouching Lord Glenvarloch at the same time, to make him understand he\nspoke but in jest, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif all the Scots in London were to fight a Welsh\nmain, and kill each other to a man, the survivor would, in my humble\nopinion, be entitled to our gratitude, as having done a most acceptable\nservice to poor Old England.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA shout of laughter and applause followed this ingenious apology for the\nclient's state of alienage; and the Templar followed up his plea with\nthe following pithy proposition:--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is the\ncustom of the fathers of this old and honourable republic, ripely\nand well to consider all their proceedings over a proper allowance of\nliquor; and far be it from me to propose the breach of so laudable a\ncustom, or to pretend that such an affair as the present can be well and\nconstitutionally considered during the discussion of a pitiful gallon\nof Rhenish. But, as it is the same thing to this honourable conclave\nwhether they drink first and determine afterwards, or whether they\ndetermine first and drink afterwards, I propose your grace, with the\nadvice of your wise and potent senators, shall pass your edict, granting\nto mine honourable friend the immunities of the place, and assigning\nhim a lodging, according to your wise forms, to which he will presently\nretire, being somewhat spent with this day's action; whereupon I will\npresently order you a rundlet of Rhenish, with a corresponding quantity\nof neats' tongues and pickled herrings, to make you all as glorious as\nGeorge-a-Green.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis overture was received with a general shout of applause, which\naltogether drowned the voice of the dissidents, if any there were\namongst the Alsatian senate who could have resisted a proposal so\npopular. The words of, kind heart! noble gentleman! generous gallant!\nflew from mouth to mouth; the inscription of the petitioner's name in\nthe great book was hastily completed, and the oath administered to him\nby the worthy Doge. Like the Laws of the Twelve Tables, of the ancient\nCambro-Britons, and other primitive nations, it was couched in poetry,\nand ran as follows:--\n\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy spigot and barrel,\n  By bilboe and buff;\n  Thou art sworn to the quarrel\n  Of the blades of the huff.\n  For Whitefriars and its claims\n  To be champion or martyr,\n  And to fight for its dames\n  Like a Knight of the Garter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNigel felt, and indeed exhibited, some disgust at this mummery; but,\nthe Templar reminding him that he was too far advanced to draw back,\nhe repeated the words, or rather assented as they were repeated by Duke\nHildebrod, who concluded the ceremony by allowing him the privilege of\nsanctuary, in the following form of prescriptive doggerel:--\n\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom the touch of the tip,\n  From the blight of the warrant,\n  From the watchmen who skip\n  On the Harman Beck's errand;\n  From the bailiffs cramp speech,\n  That makes man a thrall,\n  I charm thee from each,\n  And I charm thee from all.\n  Thy freedom's complete\n  As a Blade of the Huff,\n  To be cheated and cheat,\n  To be cuff'd and to cuff;\n  To stride, swear, and swagger,\n  To drink till you stagger,\n  To stare and to stab,\n  And to brandish your dagger\n  In the cause of your drab;\n  To walk wool-ward in winter,\n  Drink brandy, and smoke,\n  And go _fresco_ in summer\n  For want of a cloak;\n  To eke out your living\n  By the wag of your elbow,\n  By fulham and gourd,\n  And by baring of bilboe;\n  To live by your shifts,\n  And to swear by your honour,\n  Are the freedom and gifts\n  Of which I am the donor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Footnote: Of the cant words used in this\ninauguratory oration, some are obvious in their meaning, others, as\nHarman Beck (constable), and the like, derive their source from that\nancient piece of lexicography, the Slang Dictionary]\n\nThis homily being performed, a dispute arose concerning the special\nresidence to be assigned the new brother of the Sanctuary; for, as\nthe Alsatians held it a maxim in their commonwealth, that ass's milk\nfattens, there was usually a competition among the inhabitants which\nshould have the managing, as it was termed, of a new member of the\nsociety.\n\nThe Hector who had spoken so warmly and critically in Nigel's behalf,\nstood out now chivalrously in behalf of a certain Blowselinda, or\nBonstrops, who had, it seems, a room to hire, once the occasional\nresidence of Slicing Dick of Paddington, who lately suffered at Tyburn,\nand whose untimely exit had been hitherto mourned by the damsel in\nsolitary widowhood, after the fashion of the turtle-dove.\n\nThe captain's interest was, however, overruled, in behalf of the old\ngentleman in the kersey hood, who was believed, even at his extreme age,\nto understand the plucking of a pigeon, as well, or better, than any man\nin Alsatia.\n\nThis venerable personage was an usurer of notoriety, called Trapbois,\nand had very lately done the state considerable service in advancing a\nsubsidy necessary to secure a fresh importation of liquors to the Duke's\ncellars, the wine-merchant at the Vintry being scrupulous to deal with\nso great a man for any thing but ready money.\n\nWhen, therefore, the old gentleman arose, and with much coughing,\nreminded the Duke that he had a poor apartment to let, the claims of all\nothers were set aside, and Nigel was assigned to Trapbois as his guest.\n\nNo sooner was this arrangement made, than Lord Glenvarloch expressed to\nLowestoffe his impatience to leave this discreditable assembly, and took\nhis leave with a careless haste, which, but for the rundlet of Rhenish\nwine that entered just as he left the apartment, might have been taken\nin bad part. The young Templar accompanied his friend to the house of\nthe old usurer, with the road to which he and some other youngsters\nabout the Temple were even but too well acquainted. On the way, he\nassured Lord Glenvarloch that he was going to the only clean house in\nWhitefriars; a property which it owed solely to the exertions of the old\nman's only daughter, an elderly damsel, ugly enough to frighten sin, yet\nlikely to be wealthy enough to tempt a puritan, so soon as the devil had\ngot her old dad for his due. As Lowestoffe spoke thus, they knocked at\nthe door of the house, and the sour stern countenance of the female by\nwhom it was opened, fully confirmed all that the Templar had said of\nthe hostess. She heard with an ungracious and discontented air the young\nTemplar's information, that the gentleman, his companion, was to be her\nfather's lodger, muttered something about the trouble it was likely\nto occasion, but ended by showing the stranger's apartment, which was\nbetter than could have been augured from the general appearance of the\nplace, and much larger in extent than that which he occupied at Paul's\nWharf, though inferior to it in neatness.\n\nLowestoffe, having thus seen his friend fairly installed in his new\napartment, and having obtained for him a note of the rate at which he\ncould be accommodated with victuals from a neighbouring cook's shop, now\ntook his leave, offering, at the same time, to send the whole, or any\npart of Lord Glenvarloch's baggage, from his former place of residence\nto his new lodging. Nigel mentioned so few articles, that the Templar\ncould not help observing, that his lordship, it would seem, did not\nintend to enjoy his new privileges long.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are too little suited to my habits and taste, that I should do\nso,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Lord Glenvarloch.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may change your opinion to-morrow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lowestoffe; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand so I wish\nyou a good even. To-morrow I will visit you betimes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe morning came, but instead of the Templar, it brought only a letter\nfrom him. The epistle stated, that Lowestoffe's visit to Alsatia had\ndrawn down the animadversions of some crabbed old pantaloons among the\nbenchers, and that he judged it wise not to come hither at present, for\nfear of attracting too much attention to Lord Glenvarloch's place of\nresidence. He stated, that he had taken measures for the safety of his\nbaggage, and would send him, by a safe hand, his money-casket, and\nwhat articles he wanted. Then followed some sage advices, dictated by\nLowestoffe's acquaintance with Alsatia and its manners. He advised him\nto keep the usurer in the most absolute uncertainty concerning the state\nof his funds-never to throw a main with the captain, who was in the\nhabit of playing dry-fisted, and paying his losses with three vowels;\nand, finally, to beware of Duke Hildebrod, who was as sharp, he said,\nas a needle, though he had no more eyes than are possessed by that\nnecessary implement of female industry.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\n_Mother._ What I dazzled by a flash from Cupid's mirror, With which\nthe boy, as mortal urchins wont, Flings back the sunbeam in the eye of\npassengers--Then laughs to see them stumble!\n\n_Daughter._ Mother! no--It was a lightning-flash which dazzled me, And\nnever shall these eyes see true again. _Beef and Pudding.-An Old English\nComedy._\n\nIt is necessary that we should leave our hero Nigel for a time, although\nin a situation neither safe, comfortable, nor creditable, in order\nto detail some particulars which have immediate connexion with his\nfortunes.\n\nIt was but the third day after he had been forced to take refuge in the\nhouse of old Trapbois, the noted usurer of Whitefriars, commonly called\nGolden Trapbois, when the pretty daughter of old Ramsay, the watchmaker,\nafter having piously seen her father finish his breakfast, (from\nthe fear that he might, in an abstruse fit of thought, swallow the\nsalt-cellar instead of a crust of the brown loaf,) set forth from the\nhouse as soon as he was again plunged into the depth of calculation,\nand, accompanied only by that faithful old drudge, Janet, the Scots\nlaundress, to whom her whims were laws, made her way to Lombard Street,\nand disturbed, at the unusual hour of eight in the morning, Aunt Judith,\nthe sister of her worthy godfather.\n\nThe venerable maiden received her young visitor with no great\ncomplacency; for, naturally enough, she had neither the same admiration\nof her very pretty countenance, nor allowance for her foolish and\ngirlish impatience of temper, which Master George Heriot entertained.\nStill Mistress Margaret was a favourite of her brother's, whose will was\nto Aunt Judith a supreme law; and she contented herself with asking her\nuntimely visitor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat she made so early with her pale, chitty face, in\nthe streets of London?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would speak with the Lady Hermione,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the almost breathless\ngirl, while the blood ran so fast to her face as totally to remove the\nobjection of paleness which Aunt Judith had made to her complexion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith the Lady Hermione?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Aunt Judith--\u00e2\u0080\u009cwith the Lady Hermione? and\nat this time in the morning, when she will scarce see any of the family,\neven at seasonable hours? You are crazy, you silly wench, or you abuse\nthe indulgence which my brother and the lady have shown to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed, indeed I have not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated Margaret, struggling to retain the\nunbidden tear which seemed ready to burst out on the slightest occasion.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo but say to the lady that your brother's god-daughter desires\nearnestly to speak to her, and I know she will not refuse to see me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAunt Judith bent an earnest, suspicious, and inquisitive glance on her\nyoung visitor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou might make me your secretary, my lassie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cas well as the Lady Hermione. I am older, and better skilled to advise.\nI live more in the world than one who shuts herself up within four\nrooms, and I have the better means to assist you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO! no--no--no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret, eagerly, and with more earnest sincerity\nthan complaisance; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere are some things to which you cannot advise me,\nAunt Judith. It is a case--pardon me, my dear aunt--a case beyond your\ncounsel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am glad on't, maiden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Aunt Judith, somewhat angrily; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I\nthink the follies of the young people of this generation would drive mad\nan old brain like mine. Here you come on the viretot, through the whole\nstreets of London, to talk some nonsense to a lady, who scarce sees\nGod's sun, but when he shines on a brick wall. But I will tell her you\nare here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe went away, and shortly returned with a dry--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Marget, the lady\nwill be glad to see you; and that's more, my young madam, than you had a\nright to count upon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMistress Margaret hung her head in silence, too much perplexed by\nthe train of her own embarrassed thoughts, for attempting either to\nconciliate Aunt Judith's kindness, or, which on other occasions\nwould have been as congenial to her own humour, to retaliate on her\ncross-tempered remarks and manner. She followed Aunt Judith, therefore,\nin silence and dejection, to the strong oaken door which divided the\nLady Hermione's apartments from the rest of George Heriot's spacious\nhouse.\n\nAt the door of this sanctuary it is necessary to pause, in order to\ncorrect the reports with which Richie Moniplies had filled his master's\near, respecting the singular appearance of that lady's attendance at\nprayers, whom we now own to be by name the Lady Hermione. Some part\nof these exaggerations had been communicated to the worthy Scotsman by\nJenkin Vincent, who was well experienced in the species of wit which\nhas been long a favourite in the city, under the names of cross-biting,\ngiving the dor, bamboozling, cramming, hoaxing, humbugging, and\nquizzing; for which sport Richie Moniplies, with his solemn gravity,\ntotally unapprehensive of a joke, and his natural propensity to the\nmarvellous, formed an admirable subject. Farther ornaments the tale had\nreceived from Richie himself, whose tongue, especially when oiled with\ngood liquor, had a considerable tendency to amplification, and\nwho failed not, while he retailed to his master all the wonderful\ncircumstances narrated by Vincent, to add to them many conjectures of\nhis own, which his imagination had over-hastily converted into facts.\n\nYet the life which the Lady Hermione had led for two years, during which\nshe had been the inmate of George Heriot's house, was so singular, as\nalmost to sanction many of the wild reports which went abroad. The house\nwhich the worthy goldsmith inhabited, had in former times belonged to a\npowerful and wealthy baronial family, which, during the reign of Henry\nVIII., terminated in a dowager lady, very wealthy, very devout, and most\nunalienably attached to the Catholic faith. The chosen friend of the\nHonourable Lady Foljambe was the Abbess of Saint Roque's Nunnery, like\nherself a conscientious, rigid, and devoted Papist. When the house of\nSaint Roque was despotically dissolved by the fiat of the impetuous\nmonarch, the Lady Foljambe received her friend into her spacious\nmansion, together with two vestal sisters, who, like their Abbess, were\ndetermined to follow the tenor of their vows, instead of embracing the\nprofane liberty which the Monarch's will had thrown in their choice.\nFor their residence, the Lady Foljambe contrived, with all secrecy--for\nHenry might not have relished her interference--to set apart a suite of\nfour rooms, with a little closet fitted up as an oratory, or chapel; the\nwhole apartments fenced by a stout oaken door to exclude strangers, and\naccommodated with a turning wheel to receive necessaries, according\nto the practice of all nunneries. In this retreat, the Abbess of Saint\nRoque and her attendants passed many years, communicating only with the\nLady Foljambe, who, in virtue of their prayers, and of the support she\nafforded them, accounted herself little less than a saint on earth. The\nAbbess, fortunately for herself, died before her munificent patroness,\nwho lived deep in Queen Elizabeth's time, ere she was summoned by fate.\n\nThe Lady Foljambe was succeeded in this mansion by a sour fanatic\nknight, a distant and collateral relation, who claimed the same merit\nfor expelling the priestess of Baal, which his predecessor had founded\non maintaining the votaresses of Heaven. Of the two unhappy nuns, driven\nfrom their ancient refuge, one went beyond sea; the other, unable from\nold age to undertake such a journey, died under the roof of a faithful\nCatholic widow of low degree. Sir Paul Crambagge, having got rid of\nthe nuns, spoiled the chapel of its ornaments, and had thoughts of\naltogether destroying the apartments, until checked by the reflection\nthat the operation would be an unnecessary expense, since he only\ninhabited three rooms of the large mansion, and had not therefore the\nslightest occasion for any addition to its accommodations. His son\nproved a waster and a prodigal, and from him the house was bought by our\nfriend George Heriot, who, finding, like Sir Paul, the house more than\nsufficiently ample for his accommodation, left the Foljambe apartments,\nor Saint Roque's rooms, as they were called, in the state in which he\nfound them.\n\nAbout two years and a half before our history opened, when Heriot was\nabsent upon an expedition to the Continent, he sent special orders to\nhis sister and his cash-keeper, directing that the Foljambe apartments\nshould be fitted up handsomely, though plainly, for the reception of\na lady, who would make them her residence for some time; and who would\nlive more or less with his own family according to her pleasure. He also\ndirected, that the necessary repairs should be made with secrecy,\nand that as little should be said as possible upon the subject of his\nletter.\n\nWhen the time of his return came nigh, Aunt Judith and the household\nwere on the tenter-hooks of impatience. Master George came, as he had\nintimated, accompanied by a lady, so eminently beautiful, that, had\nit not been for her extreme and uniform paleness, she might have been\nreckoned one of the loveliest creatures on earth. She had with her an\nattendant, or humble companion, whose business seemed only to wait upon\nher. This person, a reserved woman, and by her dialect a foreigner, aged\nabout fifty, was called by the lady Monna Paula, and by Master Heriot,\nand others, Mademoiselle Pauline. She slept in the same room with\nher patroness at night, ate in her apartment, and was scarcely ever\nseparated from her during the day.\n\nThese females took possession of the nunnery of the devout Abbess, and,\nwithout observing the same rigorous seclusion, according to the letter,\nseemed wellnigh to restore the apartments to the use to which they had\nbeen originally designed. The new inmates lived and took their meals\napart from the rest of the family. With the domestics Lady Hermione, for\nso she was termed, held no communication, and Mademoiselle Pauline only\nsuch as was indispensable, which she dispatched as briefly as possible.\nFrequent and liberal largesses reconciled the servants to this conduct;\nand they were in the habit of observing to each other, that to do a\nservice for Mademoiselle Pauline, was like finding a fairy treasure.\n\nTo Aunt Judith the Lady Hermione was kind and civil, but their\nintercourse was rare; on which account the elder lady felt some pangs\nboth of curiosity and injured dignity. But she knew her brother so well,\nand loved him so dearly, that his will, once expressed, might be truly\nsaid to become her own. The worthy citizen was not without a spice of\nthe dogmatism which grows on the best disposition, when a word is a\nlaw to all around. Master George did not endure to be questioned by his\nfamily, and, when he had generally expressed his will, that the Lady\nHermione should live in the way most agreeable to her, and that no\ninquiries should be made concerning their history, or her motives for\nobserving such strict seclusion, his sister well knew that he would have\nbeen seriously displeased with any attempt to pry into the secret.\n\nBut, though Heriot's servants were bribed, and his sister awed into\nsilent acquiescence in these arrangements, they were not of a nature to\nescape the critical observation of the neighbourhood. Some opined that\nthe wealthy goldsmith was about to turn papist, and re-establish Lady\nFoljambe's nunnery--others that he was going mad--others that he\nwas either going to marry, or to do worse. Master George's constant\nappearance at church, and the knowledge that the supposed votaress\nalways attended when the prayers of the English ritual were read in the\nfamily, liberated him from the first of these suspicions; those who\nhad to transact business with him upon 'Change, could not doubt the\nsoundness of Master Heriot's mind; and, to confute the other rumours,\nit was credibly reported by such as made the matter their particular\ninterest, that Master George Heriot never visited his guest but in\npresence of Mademoiselle Pauline, who sat with her work in a remote part\nof the same room in which they conversed. It was also ascertained that\nthese visits scarcely ever exceeded an hour in length, and were usually\nonly repeated once a week, an intercourse too brief and too long\ninterrupted, to render it probable that love was the bond of their\nunion.\n\nThe inquirers were, therefore, at fault, and compelled to relinquish\nthe pursuit of Master Heriot's secret, while a thousand ridiculous\ntales were circulated amongst the ignorant and superstitious, with some\nspecimens of which our friend Richie Moniplies had been _crammed_, as we\nhave seen, by the malicious apprentice of worthy David Ramsay.\n\nThere was one person in the world who, it was thought, could (if she\nwould) have said more of the Lady Hermione than any one in London,\nexcept George Heriot himself; and that was the said David Ramsay's only\nchild, Margaret.\n\nThis girl was not much past the age of fifteen when the Lady Hermione\nfirst came to England, and was a very frequent visitor at her\ngodfather's, who was much amused by her childish sallies, and by the\nwild and natural beauty with which she sung the airs of her native\ncountry. Spoilt she was on all hands; by the indulgence of her\ngodfather, the absent habits and indifference of her father, and the\ndeference of all around to her caprices, as a beauty and as an heiress.\nBut though, from these circumstances, the city-beauty had become as\nwilful, as capricious, and as affected, as unlimited indulgence seldom\nfails to render those to whom it is extended; and although she exhibited\nupon many occasions that affectation of extreme shyness, silence, and\nreserve, which misses in their teens are apt to take for an amiable\nmodesty; and, upon others, a considerable portion of that flippancy,\nwhich youth sometimes confounds with wit, Mistress Margaret had much\nreal shrewdness and judgment, which wanted only opportunities of\nobservation to refine it--a lively, good-humoured, playful disposition,\nand an excellent heart. Her acquired follies were much increased by\nreading plays and romances, to which she devoted a great deal of her\ntime, and from which she adopted ideas as different as possible from\nthose which she might have obtained from the invaluable and affectionate\ninstructions of an excellent mother; and the freaks of which she was\nsometimes guilty, rendered her not unjustly liable to the charge of\naffectation and coquetry. But the little lass had sense and shrewdness\nenough to keep her failings out of sight of her godfather, to whom she\nwas sincerely attached; and so high she stood in his favour, that, at\nhis recommendation, she obtained permission to visit the recluse Lady\nHermione.\n\nThe singular mode of life which that lady observed; her great beauty,\nrendered even more interesting by her extreme paleness; the conscious\npride of being admitted farther than the rest of the world into the\nsociety of a person who was wrapped in so much mystery, made a\ndeep impression on the mind of Margaret Ramsay; and though their\nconversations were at no time either long or confidential, yet, proud of\nthe trust reposed in her, Margaret was as secret respecting their tenor\nas if every word repeated had been to cost her life. No inquiry, however\nartfully backed by flattery and insinuation, whether on the part of Dame\nUrsula, or any other person equally inquisitive, could wring from the\nlittle maiden one word of what she heard or saw, after she entered these\nmysterious and secluded apartments. The slightest question concerning\nMaster Heriot's ghost, was sufficient, at her gayest moment, to check\nthe current of her communicative prattle, and render her silent.\n\nWe mention this, chiefly to illustrate the early strength of Margaret's\ncharacter--a strength concealed under a hundred freakish whims and\nhumours, as an ancient and massive buttress is disguised by its\nfantastic covering of ivy and wildflowers. In truth, if the damsel had\ntold all she heard or saw within the Foljambe apartments, she would have\nsaid but little to gratify the curiosity of inquirers.\n\nAt the earlier period of their acquaintance, the Lady Hermione was wont\nto reward the attentions of her little friend with small but elegant\npresents, and entertain her by a display of foreign rarities and\ncuriosities, many of them of considerable value. Sometimes the time\nwas passed in a way much less agreeable to Margaret, by her receiving\nlessons from Pauline in the use of the needle. But, although her\npreceptress practised these arts with a dexterity then only known in\nforeign convents, the pupil proved so incorrigibly idle and awkward,\nthat the task of needlework was at length given up, and lessons of music\nsubstituted in their stead. Here also Pauline was excellently qualified\nas an instructress, and Margaret, more successful in a science for which\nNature had gifted her, made proficiency both in vocal and instrumental\nmusic. These lessons passed in presence of the Lady Hermione, to whom\nthey seemed to give pleasure. She sometimes added her own voice to the\nperformance, in a pure, clear stream of liquid melody; but this was only\nwhen the music was of a devotional cast. As Margaret became older, her\ncommunications with the recluse assumed a different character. She was\nallowed, if not encouraged, to tell whatever she had remarked out of\ndoors, and the Lady Hermione, while she remarked the quick, sharp, and\nretentive powers of observation possessed by her young friend, often\nfound sufficient reason to caution her against rashness in forming\nopinions, and giddy petulance in expressing them.\n\nThe habitual awe with which she regarded this singular personage,\ninduced Mistress Margaret, though by no means delighting in\ncontradiction or reproof, to listen with patience to her admonitions,\nand to make full allowance for the good intentions of the patroness by\nwhom they were bestowed; although in her heart she could hardly conceive\nhow Madame Hermione, who never stirred from the Foljambe apartments,\nshould think of teaching knowledge of the world to one who walked twice\na-week between Temple Bar and Lombard Street, besides parading in\nthe Park every Sunday that proved to be fair weather. Indeed, pretty\nMistress Margaret was so little inclined to endure such remonstrances,\nthat her intercourse with the inhabitants of the Foljambe apartments\nwould have probably slackened as her circle of acquaintance increased\nin the external world, had she not, on the one hand, entertained an\nhabitual reverence for her monitress, of which she could not divest\nherself, and been flattered, on the other, by being to a certain degree\nthe depository of a confidence for which others thirsted in vain.\nBesides, although the conversation of Hermione was uniformly serious, it\nwas not in general either formal or severe; nor was the lady offended by\nflights of levity which Mistress Margaret sometimes ventured on in her\npresence, even when they were such as made Monna Paula cast her eyes\nupwards, and sigh with that compassion which a devotee extends towards\nthe votaries of a trivial and profane world. Thus, upon the whole, the\nlittle maiden was disposed to submit, though not without some wincing,\nto the grave admonitions of the Lady Hermione; and the rather that the\nmystery annexed to the person of her monitress was in her mind early\nassociated with a vague idea of wealth and importance, which had been\nrather confirmed than lessened by many accidental circumstances which\nshe had noticed since she was more capable of observation.\n\nIt frequently happens, that the counsel which we reckon intrusive when\noffered to us unasked, becomes precious in our eyes when the pressure of\ndifficulties renders us more diffident of our own judgment than we are\napt to find ourselves in the hours of ease and indifference; and this is\nmore especially the case if we suppose that our adviser may also possess\npower and inclination to back his counsel with effectual assistance.\nMistress Margaret was now in that situation. She was, or believed\nherself to be, in a condition where both advice and assistance might be\nnecessary; and it was therefore, after an anxious and sleepless night,\nthat she resolved to have recourse to the Lady Hermione, who she knew\nwould readily afford her the one, and, as she hoped, might also possess\nmeans of giving her the other. The conversation between them will best\nexplain the purport of the visit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\n  By this good light, a wench of matchless mettle!\n  This were a leaguer-lass to love a soldier,\n  To bind his wounds, and kiss his bloody brow,\n  And sing a roundel as she help'd to arm him,\n  Though the rough foeman's drums were beat so nigh,\n  They seem'd to bear the burden.\n                               _Old Play._\n\nWhen Mistress Margaret entered the Foljambe apartment, she found the\ninmates employed in their usual manner; the lady in reading, and her\nattendant in embroidering a large piece of tapestry, which had occupied\nher ever since Margaret had been first admitted within these secluded\nchambers.\n\nHermione nodded kindly to her visitor, but did not speak; and Margaret,\naccustomed to this reception, and in the present case not sorry for it,\nas it gave her an interval to collect her thoughts, stooped over Monna\nPaula's frame and observed, in a half whisper, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou were just so far as\nthat rose, Monna, when I first saw you--see, there is the mark where I\nhad the bad luck to spoil the flower in trying to catch the stitch--I\nwas little above fifteen then. These flowers make me an old woman, Monna\nPaula.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish they could make you a wise one, my child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Monna Paula,\nin whose esteem pretty Mistress Margaret did not stand quite so high as\nin that of her patroness; partly owing to her natural austerity, which\nwas something intolerant of youth and gaiety, and partly to the jealousy\nwith which a favourite domestic regards any one whom she considers as a\nsort of rival in the affections of her mistress.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is it you say to Monna, little one?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Mistress Margaret, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut that I have seen the\nreal flowers blossom three times over since I first saw Monna Paula\nworking in her canvass garden, and her violets have not budded yet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue, lady-bird,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Hermione; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut the buds that are longest in\nblossoming will last the longest in flower. You have seen them in the\ngarden bloom thrice, but you have seen them fade thrice also; now, Monna\nPaula's will remain in blow for ever--they will fear neither frost nor\ntempest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Mistress Margaret; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut neither have they life\nor odour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat, little one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the recluse, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis to compare a life agitated\nby hope and fear, and chequered with success and disappointment, and\nfevered by the effects of love and hatred, a life of passion and of\nfeeling, saddened and shortened by its exhausting alternations, to a\ncalm and tranquil existence, animated but by a sense of duties, and only\nemployed, during its smooth and quiet course, in the unwearied discharge\nof them. Is that the moral of your answer?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not know, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Mistress Margaret; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut, of all birds\nin the air, I would rather be the lark, that sings while he is drifting\ndown the summer breeze, than the weathercock that sticks fast yonder\nupon his iron perch, and just moves so much as to discharge his duty,\nand tell us which way the wind blows.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMetaphors are no arguments, my pretty maiden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady Hermione,\nsmiling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sorry for that, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Margaret; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor they are such a\npretty indirect way of telling one's mind when it differs from one's\nbetters--besides, on this subject there is no end of them, and they are\nso civil and becoming withal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009clet me hear some of them, I pray you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would be, for example, very bold in me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto say\nto your ladyship, that, rather than live a quiet life, I would like a\nlittle variety of hope and fear, and liking and disliking--and--and--and\nthe other sort of feelings which your ladyship is pleased to speak of;\nbut I may say freely, and without blame, that I like a butterfly better\nthan a bettle, or a trembling aspen better than a grim Scots fir, that\nnever wags a leaf--or that of all the wood, brass, and wire that ever my\nfather's fingers put together, I do hate and detest a certain huge\nold clock of the German fashion, that rings hours and half hours, and\nquarters and half quarters, as if it were of such consequence that the\nworld should know it was wound up and going. Now, dearest lady, I wish\nyou would only compare that clumsy, clanging, Dutch-looking piece of\nlumber, with the beautiful timepiece that Master Heriot caused my father\nto make for your ladyship, which uses to play a hundred merry tunes, and\nturns out, when it strikes the hour, a whole band of morrice dancers, to\ntrip the hays to the measure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd which of these timepieces goes the truest, Margaret?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nlady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must confess the old Dutchman has the advantage in that\u00e2\u0080\u009d--said\nMargaret. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI fancy you are right, madam, and that comparisons are no\narguments; at least mine has not brought me through.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon my word, maiden Margaret,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lady, smiling, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have been\nof late thinking very much of these matters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps too much, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret, so low as only to be heard by\nthe lady, behind the back of whose chair she had now placed herself. The\nwords were spoken very gravely, and accompanied by a half sigh, which\ndid not escape the attention of her to whom they were addressed.\nThe Lady Hermione turned immediately round, and looked earnestly at\nMargaret, then paused for a moment, and, finally, commanded Monna Paula\nto carry her frame and embroidery into the antechamber. When they were\nleft alone, she desired her young friend to come from behind the chair\non the back of which she still rested, and sit down beside her upon a\nstool.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will remain thus, madam, under your favour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Margaret,\nwithout changing her posture; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would rather you heard me without\nseeing me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn God's name, maiden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned her patroness, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat is it you can\nhave to say, that may not be uttered face to face, to so true a friend\nas I am?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWithout making any direct answer, Margaret only replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou were\nright, dearest lady, when you said, I had suffered my feelings too much\nto engross me of late. I have done very wrong, and you will be angry\nwith me--so will my godfather, but I cannot help it--he must be\nrescued.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_He?_\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated the lady, with emphasis; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat brief little word does,\nindeed, so far explain your mystery;--but come from behind the chair,\nyou silly popinjay! I will wager you have suffered yonder gay young\napprentice to sit too near your heart. I have not heard you mention\nyoung Vincent for many a day--perhaps he has not been out of mouth and\nout of mind both. Have you been so foolish as to let him speak to you\nseriously?--I am told he is a bold youth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot bold enough to say any thing that could displease me, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nMargaret.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps, then, you were _not_ displeased,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009cor perhaps\nhe has not _spoken_, which would be wiser and better. Be open-hearted,\nmy love--your godfather will soon return, and we will take him into\nour consultations. If the young man is industrious, and come of honest\nparentage, his poverty may be no such insurmountable obstacle. But you\nare both of you very young, Margaret--I know your godfather will expect,\nthat the youth shall first serve out his apprenticeship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMargaret had hitherto suffered the lady to proceed, under the mistaken\nimpression which she had adopted, simply because she could not tell how\nto interrupt her; but pure despite at hearing her last words gave her\nboldness at length to say \u00e2\u0080\u009cI crave your pardon, madam; but neither\nthe youth you mention, nor any apprentice or master within the city of\nLondon--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMargaret,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lady, in reply, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe contemptuous tone with which\nyou mention those of your own class, (many hundreds if not thousands of\nwhom are in all respects better than yourself, and would greatly honour\nyou by thinking of you,) is methinks, no warrant for the wisdom of your\nchoice--for a choice, it seems, there is. Who is it, maiden, to whom you\nhave thus rashly attached yourself?--rashly, I fear it must be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is the young Scottish Lord Glenvarloch, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Margaret,\nin a low and modest tone, but sufficiently firm, considering the\nsubject.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe young Lord of Glenvarloch!\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated the lady, in great\nsurprise--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaiden, you are distracted in your wits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew you would say so, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Margaret. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is what another\nperson has already told me--it is, perhaps, what all the world would\ntell me--it is what I am sometimes disposed to tell myself. But look\nat me, madam, for I will now come before you, and tell me if there is\nmadness or distraction in my look and word, when I repeat to you again,\nthat I have fixed my affections on this young nobleman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf there is not madness in your look or word, maiden, there is infinite\nfolly in what you say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Lady Hermione, sharply. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen did\nyou ever hear that misplaced love brought any thing but wretchedness?\nSeek a match among your equals, Margaret, and escape the countless\nkinds of risk and misery that must attend an affection beyond your\ndegree.--Why do you smile, maiden? Is there aught to cause scorn in what\nI say?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSurely no, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Margaret. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI only smiled to think how it\nshould happen, that, while rank made such a wide difference between\ncreatures formed from the same clay, the wit of the vulgar should,\nnevertheless, jump so exactly the same length with that of the\naccomplished and the exalted. It is but the variation of the phrase\nwhich divides them. Dame Ursley told me the very same thing which your\nladyship has but now uttered; only you, madam, talk of countless misery,\nand Dame Ursley spoke of the gallows, and Mistress Turner, who was\nhanged upon it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Lady Hermione; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand who may Dame Ursley be,\nthat your wise choice has associated with me in the difficult task of\nadvising a fool?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe barber's wife at next door, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Margaret, with feigned\nsimplicity, but far from being sorry at heart, that she had found an\nindirect mode of mortifying her monitress. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is the wisest woman that\nI know, next to your ladyship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA proper confidant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand chosen with the same delicate\nsense of what is due to yourself and others!--But what ails you,\nmaiden--where are you going?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly to ask Dame Ursley's advice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret, as if about to\ndepart; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I see your ladyship is too angry to give me any, and the\nemergency is pressing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat emergency, thou simple one?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lady, in a kinder\ntone.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSit down, maiden, and tell me your tale. It is true you are a\nfool, and a pettish fool to boot; but then you are a child--an amiable\nchild, with all your self-willed folly, and we must help you, if we\ncan.--Sit down, I say, as you are desired, and you will find me a safer\nand wiser counseller than the barber-woman. And tell me how you come to\nsuppose, that you have fixed your heart unalterably upon a man whom you\nhave seen, as I think, but once.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have seen him oftener,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the damsel, looking down; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I have\nonly spoken to him once. I should have been able to get that once out of\nmy head, though the impression was so deep, that I could even now repeat\nevery trifling word he said; but other things have since riveted it in\nmy bosom for ever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaiden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009c_for ever_ is the word which comes most\nlightly on the lips in such circumstances, but which, not the less,\nis almost the last that we should use. The fashion of this world,\nits passions, its joys, and its sorrows, pass away like the winged\nbreeze--there is nought for ever but that which belongs to the world\nbeyond the grave.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have corrected me justly, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret calmly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI ought\nonly to have spoken of my present state of mind, as what will last me\nfor my lifetime, which unquestionably may be but short.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what is there in this Scottish lord that can rivet what concerns\nhim so closely in your fancy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lady. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI admit him a personable\nman, for I have seen him; and I will suppose him courteous and\nagreeable. But what are his accomplishments besides, for these surely\nare not uncommon attributes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is unfortunate, madam--most unfortunate--and surrounded by snares\nof different kinds, ingeniously contrived to ruin his character, destroy\nhis estate, and, perhaps, to reach even his life. These schemes have\nbeen devised by avarice originally, but they are now followed close by\nvindictive ambition, animated, I think, by the absolute and concentrated\nspirit of malice; for the Lord Dalgarno--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere, Monna Paula--Monna Paula!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the Lady Hermione,\ninterrupting her young friend's narrative. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe hears me not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nanswered, rising and going out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must seek her--I will return\ninstantly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She returned accordingly very soon after. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mentioned a\nname which I thought was familiar to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut Monna Paula has\nput me right. I know nothing of your lord--how was it you named him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLord Dalgarno,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret;--\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe wickedest man who lives. Under\npretence of friendship, he introduced the Lord Glenvarloch to a\ngambling-house with the purpose of engaging him in deep play; but\nhe with whom the perfidious traitor had to deal, was too virtuous,\nmoderate, and cautious, to be caught in a snare so open. What did they\nnext, but turn his own moderation against him, and persuade others\nthat--because he would not become the prey of wolves, he herded with\nthem for a share of their booty! And, while this base Lord Dalgarno was\nthus undermining his unsuspecting countryman, he took every measure\nto keep him surrounded by creatures of his own, to prevent him from\nattending Court, and mixing with those of his proper rank. Since the\nGunpowder Treason, there never was a conspiracy more deeply laid, more\nbasely and more deliberately pursued.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe lady smiled sadly at Margaret's vehemence, but sighed the next\nmoment, while she told her young friend how little she knew the world\nshe was about to live in, since she testified so much surprise at\nfinding it full of villainy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut by what means,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccould you, maiden, become possessed of\nthe secret views of a man so cautious as Lord Dalgarno--as villains in\ngeneral are?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPermit me to be silent on that subject,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the maiden; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could not\ntell you without betraying others--let it suffice that my tidings are as\ncertain as the means by which I acquired them are secret and sure. But I\nmust not tell them even to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are too bold, Margaret,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto traffic in such matters\nat your early age. It is not only dangerous, but even unbecoming and\nunmaidenly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew you would say that also,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret, with more meekness and\npatience than she usually showed on receiving reproof; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut, God knows,\nmy heart acquits me of every other feeling save that of the wish to\nassist this most innocent and betrayed man.--I contrived to send him\nwarning of his friend's falsehood;--alas! my care has only hastened his\nutter ruin, unless speedy aid be found. He charged his false friend with\ntreachery, and drew on him in the Park, and is now liable to the fatal\npenalty due for breach of privilege of the king's palace.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is indeed an extraordinary tale,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hermione; \u00e2\u0080\u009cis Lord\nGlenvarloch then in prison?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, madam, thank God, but in the Sanctuary at Whitefriars--it is matter\nof doubt whether it will protect him in such a case--they speak of a\nwarrant from the Lord Chief Justice--A gentleman of the temple has been\narrested, and is in trouble for having assisted him in his flight.--Even\nhis taking temporary refuge in that base place, though from extreme\nnecessity, will be used to the further defaming him. All this I know,\nand yet I cannot rescue him--cannot rescue him save by your means.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my means, maiden?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lady--\u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are beside yourself!--What\nmeans can I possess in this secluded situation, of assisting this\nunfortunate nobleman?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have means,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret, eagerly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have those means, unless\nI mistake greatly, which can do anything--can do everything, in this\ncity, in this world--you have wealth, and the command of a small portion\nof it will enable me to extricate him from his present danger. He will\nbe enabled and directed how to make his escape--and I--\u00e2\u0080\u009d she paused.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill accompany him, doubtless, and reap the fruits of your sage\nexertions in his behalf?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady Hermione, ironically.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay heaven forgive you the unjust thought, lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Margaret.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will never see him more--but I shall have saved him, and the thought\nwill make me happy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA cold conclusion to so bold and warm a flame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lady, with a\nsmile which seemed to intimate incredulity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is, however, the only one which I expect, madam--I could almost\nsay the only one which I wish--I am sure I will use no efforts to bring\nabout any other; if I am bold in his cause, I am timorous enough in my\nown. During our only interview I was unable to speak a word to him. He\nknows not the sound of my voice--and all that I have risked, and must\nyet risk, I am doing for one, who, were he asked the question, would say\nhe has long since forgotten that he ever saw, spoke to, or sat beside, a\ncreature of so little signification as I am.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a strange and unreasonable indulgence of a passion equally\nfanciful and dangerous,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lady Hermione. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will _not_ assist me,\nthen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret; \u00e2\u0080\u009chave good-day, then, madam--my secret, I trust,\nis safe in such honourable keeping.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTarry yet a little,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand tell me what resource you\nhave to assist this youth, if you were supplied with money to put it in\nmotion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is superfluous to ask me the question, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Margaret,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cunless you purpose to assist me; and, if you do so purpose, it is still\nsuperfluous. You could not understand the means I must use, and time is\ntoo brief to explain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut have you in reality such means?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have, with the command of a moderate sum,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Margaret Ramsay,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe power of baffling all his enemies--of eluding the passion of\nthe irritated king--the colder but more determined displeasure of the\nprince--the vindictive spirit of Buckingham, so hastily directed against\nwhomsoever crosses the path of his ambition--the cold concentrated\nmalice of Lord Dalgarno--all, I can baffle them all!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut is this to be done without your own personal risk, Margaret?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n replied the lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor, be your purpose what it will, you are not to\nperil your own reputation or person, in the romantic attempt of serving\nanother; and I, maiden, am answerable to your godfather,--to your\nbenefactor, and my own,--not to aid you in any dangerous or unworthy\nenterprise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDepend upon my word,--my oath,--dearest lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the supplicant,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I will act by the agency of others, and do not myself design to\nmingle in any enterprise in which my appearance might be either perilous\nor unwomanly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know not what to do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady Hermione; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is perhaps\nincautious and inconsiderate in me to aid so wild a project; yet the end\nseems honourable, if the means be sure--what is the penalty if he fall\ninto their power?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas, alas! the loss of his right hand!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Margaret, her voice\nalmost stifled with sobs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre the laws of England so cruel? Then there is mercy in heaven alone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said the lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009csince, even in this free land, men are wolves to each\nother.--Compose yourself, Margaret, and tell me what money is necessary\nto secure Lord Glenvarloch's escape.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTwo hundred pieces,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Margaret; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would speak to you of\nrestoring them--and I must one day have the power--only that I\nknow--that is, I think--your ladyship is indifferent on that score.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a word more of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009ccall Monna Paula hither.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\n  Credit me, friend, it hath been ever thus,\n  Since the ark rested on Mount Ararat.\n  False man hath sworn, and woman hath believed--\n  Repented and reproach'd, and then believed once more.\n                                  _The New World._\n\nBy the time that Margaret returned with Monna Paula, the Lady Hermione\nwas rising from the table at which she had been engaged in writing\nsomething on a small slip of paper, which she gave to her attendant.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMonna Paula,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccarry this paper to Roberts the cash-keeper;\nlet them give you the money mentioned in the note, and bring it hither\npresently.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMonna Paula left the room, and her mistress proceeded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMargaret, if I have done, and am doing,\nwell in this affair. My life has been one of strange seclusion, and I am\ntotally unacquainted with the practical ways of this world--an ignorance\nwhich I know cannot be remedied by mere reading.--I fear I am doing\nwrong to you, and perhaps to the laws of the country which affords me\nrefuge, by thus indulging you; and yet there is something in my heart\nwhich cannot resist your entreaties.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, listen to it--listen to it, dear, generous lady!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret,\nthrowing herself on her knees and grasping those of her benefactress\nand looking in that attitude like a beautiful mortal in the act\nof supplicating her tutelary angel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe laws of men are but the\ninjunctions of mortality, but what the heart prompts is the echo of the\nvoice from heaven within us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRise, rise, maiden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hermione; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou affect me more than I thought\nI could have been moved by aught that should approach me. Rise and tell\nme whence it comes, that, in so short a time, your thoughts, your looks,\nyour speech, and even your slightest actions, are changed from those\nof a capricious and fanciful girl, to all this energy and impassioned\neloquence of word and action?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sure I know not, dearest lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret, looking down; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut\nI suppose that, when I was a trifler, I was only thinking of trifles.\nWhat I now reflect is deep and serious, and I am thankful if my speech\nand manner bear reasonable proportion to my thoughts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt must be so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyet the change seems a rapid and\nstrange one. It seems to be as if a childish girl had at once shot up\ninto deep-thinking and impassioned woman, ready to make exertions alike,\nand sacrifices, with all that vain devotion to a favourite object of\naffection, which is often so basely rewarded.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Lady Hermione sighed bitterly, and Monna Paula entered ere the\nconversation proceeded farther. She spoke to her mistress in the foreign\nlanguage in which they frequently conversed, but which was unknown to\nMargaret.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must have patience for a time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lady to her visitor; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe\ncash-keeper is abroad on some business, but he is expected home in the\ncourse of half an hour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMargaret wrung her hands in vexation and impatience.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMinutes are precious,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I am well aware of;\nand we will at least suffer none of them to escape us. Monna Paula shall\nremain below and transact our business, the very instant that Roberts\nreturns home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe spoke to her attendant accordingly, who again left the room.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are very kind, madam--very good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the poor little Margaret,\nwhile the anxious trembling of her lip and of her hand showed all that\nsickening agitation of the heart which arises from hope deferred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe patient, Margaret, and collect yourself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\nmay, you must, have much to do to carry through this your bold\npurpose--reserve your spirits, which you may need so much--be\npatient--it is the only remedy against the evils of life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret, wiping her eyes, and endeavouring in\nvain to suppress the natural impatience of her temper,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have heard\nso--very often indeed; and I dare say I have myself, heaven forgive me,\nsaid so to people in perplexity and affliction; but it was before I\nhad suffered perplexity and vexation myself, and I am sure I will never\npreach patience to any human being again, now that I know how much the\nmedicine goes against the stomach.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will think better of it, maiden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady Hermione; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI also,\nwhen I first felt distress, thought they did me wrong who spoke to me\nof patience; but my sorrows have been repeated and continued till I have\nbeen taught to cling to it as the best, and--religious duties excepted,\nof which, indeed, patience forms a part--the only alleviation which life\ncan afford them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMargaret, who neither wanted sense nor feeling, wiped her tears hastily,\nand asked her patroness's forgiveness for her petulance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI might have thought\u00e2\u0080\u009d--she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI ought to have reflected, that even\nfrom the manner of your life, madam, it is plain you must have suffered\nsorrow; and yet, God knows, the patience which I have ever seen you\ndisplay, well entitles you to recommend your own example to others.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe lady was silent for a moment, and then replied--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMargaret, I am about to repose a high confidence in you. You are no\nlonger a child, but a thinking and a feeling woman. You have told me as\nmuch of your secret as you dared--I will let you know as much of mine as\nI may venture to tell. You will ask me, perhaps, why, at a moment when\nyour own mind is agitated, I should force upon you the consideration of\nmy sorrows? and I answer, that I cannot withstand the impulse which now\ninduces me to do so. Perhaps from having witnessed, for the first time\nthese three years, the natural effects of human passion, my own\nsorrows have been awakened, and are for the moment too big for my own\nbosom--perhaps I may hope that you, who seem driving full sail on the\nvery rock on which I was wrecked for ever, will take warning by the tale\nI have to tell. Enough, if you are willing to listen, I am willing to\ntell you who the melancholy inhabitant of the Foljambe apartments really\nis, and why she resides here. It will serve, at least, to while away the\ntime until Monna Paula shall bring us the reply from Roberts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt any other moment of her life, Margaret Ramsay would have heard\nwith undivided interest a communication so flattering in itself, and\nreferring to a subject upon which the general curiosity had been so\nstrongly excited. And even at this agitating moment, although she ceased\nnot to listen with an anxious ear and throbbing heart for the sound of\nMonna Paula's returning footsteps, she nevertheless, as gratitude and\npolicy, as well as a portion of curiosity dictated, composed herself,\nin appearance at least, to the strictest attention to the Lady Hermione,\nand thanked her with humility for the high confidence she was pleased\nto repose in her. The Lady Hermione, with the same calmness which always\nattended her speech and actions, thus recounted her story to her young\nfriend:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas a merchant, but he was of a city whose\nmerchants are princes. I am the daughter of a noble house in Genoa,\nwhose name stood as high in honour and in antiquity, as any inscribed in\nthe Golden Register of that famous aristocracy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy mother was a noble Scottish woman. She was descended--do not\nstart--and not remotely descended, of the house of Glenvarloch--no\nwonder that I was easily led to take concern in the misfortunes of this\nyoung lord. He is my near relation, and my mother, who was more than\nsufficiently proud of her descent, early taught me to take an interest\nin the name. My maternal grandfather, a cadet of that house of\nGlenvarloch, had followed the fortunes of an unhappy fugitive, Francis\nEarl of Bothwell, who, after showing his miseries in many a foreign\ncourt, at length settled in Spain upon a miserable pension, which\nhe earned by conforming to the Catholic faith. Ralph Olifaunt, my\ngrandfather, separated from him in disgust, and settled at Barcelona,\nwhere, by the friendship of the governor, his heresy, as it was termed,\nwas connived at. My father, in the course of his commerce, resided more\nat Barcelona than in his native country, though at times he visited\nGenoa.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was at Barcelona that he became acquainted with my mother, loved\nher, and married her; they differed in faith, but they agreed in\naffection. I was their only child. In public I conformed to the\ndocterins and ceremonial of the Church of Rome; but my mother, by whom\nthese were regarded with horror, privately trained me up in those of the\nreformed religion; and my father, either indifferent in the matter, or\nunwilling to distress the woman whom he loved, overlooked or connived at\nmy secretly joining in her devotions.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut when, unhappily, my father was attacked, while yet in the prime\nof life, by a slow wasting disease, which he felt to be incurable, he\nforesaw the hazard to which his widow and orphan might be exposed, after\nhe was no more, in a country so bigoted to Catholicism as Spain. He made\nit his business, during the two last years of his life, to realize and\nremit to England a large part of his fortune, which, by the faith and\nhonour of his correspondent, the excellent man under whose roof I now\nreside, was employed to great advantage. Had my father lived to complete\nhis purpose, by withdrawing his whole fortune from commerce, he himself\nwould have accompanied us to England, and would have beheld us settled\nin peace and honour before his death. But heaven had ordained it\notherwise. He died, leaving several sums engaged in the hands of his\nSpanish debtors; and, in particular, he had made a large and extensive\nconsignment to a certain wealthy society of merchants at Madrid, who\nshowed no willingness after his death to account for the proceeds. Would\nto God we had left these covetous and wicked men in possession of their\nbooty, for such they seemed to hold the property of their deceased\ncorrespondent and friend! We had enough for comfort, and even splendour,\nalready secured in England; but friends exclaimed upon the folly\nof permitting these unprincipled men to plunder us of our rightful\nproperty. The sum itself was large, and the claim having been made,\nmy mother thought that my father's memory was interested in its being\nenforced, especially as the defences set up for the mercantile society\nwent, in some degree, to impeach the fairness of his transactions.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe went therefore to Madrid. I was then, my Margaret, about your age,\nyoung and thoughtless, as you have hitherto been--We went, I say, to\nMadrid, to solicit the protection of the Court and of the king, without\nwhich we were told it would be in vain to expect justice against an\nopulent and powerful association.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur residence at the Spanish metropolis drew on from weeks to months.\nFor my part, my natural sorrow for a kind, though not a fond father,\nhaving abated, I cared not if the lawsuit had detained us at Madrid for\never. My mother permitted herself and me rather more liberty than we\nhad been accustomed to. She found relations among the Scottish and Irish\nofficers, many of whom held a high rank in the Spanish armies; their\nwives and daughters became our friends and companions, and I had\nperpetual occasion to exercise my mother's native language, which I had\nlearned from my infancy. By degrees, as my mother's spirits were low,\nand her health indifferent, she was induced, by her partial fondness for\nme, to suffer me to mingle occasionally in society which she herself did\nnot frequent, under the guardianship of such ladies as she imagined she\ncould trust, and particularly under the care of the lady of a general\nofficer, whose weakness or falsehood was the original cause of my\nmisfortunes. I was as gay, Margaret, and thoughtless--I again repeat\nit--as you were but lately, and my attention, like yours, became\nsuddenly riveted to one object, and to one set of feelings.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe person by whom they were excited was young, noble, handsome,\naccomplished, a soldier, and a Briton. So far our cases are nearly\nparallel; but, may heaven forbid that the parallel should become\ncomplete! This man, so noble, so fairly formed, so gifted, and so\nbrave--this villain, for that, Margaret, was his fittest name, spoke of\nlove to me, and I listened---Could I suspect his sincerity? If he was\nwealthy, noble, and long-descended, I also was a noble and an opulent\nheiress. It is true, that he neither knew the extent of my father's\nwealth, nor did I communicate to him (I do not even remember if I myself\nknew it at the time) the important circumstance, that the greater part\nof that wealth was beyond the grasp of arbitrary power, and not subject\nto the precarious award of arbitrary judges. My lover might think,\nperhaps, as my mother was desirous the world at large should believe,\nthat almost our whole fortune depended on the precarious suit which we\nhad come to Madrid to prosecute--a belief which she had countenanced\nout of policy, being well aware that a knowledge of my father's having\nremitted such a large part of his fortune to England, would in no shape\naid the recovery of further sums in the Spanish courts. Yet, with no\nmore extensive views of my fortune than were possessed by the public,\nI believe that he, of whom I am speaking, was at first sincere in his\npretensions. He had himself interest sufficient to have obtained a\ndecision in our favour in the courts, and my fortune, reckoning only\nwhat was in Spain, would then have been no inconsiderable sum. To be\nbrief, whatever might be his motives or temptation for so far committing\nhimself, he applied to my mother for my hand, with my consent and\napproval. My mother's judgment had become weaker, but her passions had\nbecome more irritable, during her increasing illness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have heard of the bitterness of the ancient Scottish feuds, of\nwhich it may be said, in the language of Scripture, that the fathers eat\nsour grapes, and the teeth of the children are set on edge. Unhappily--I\nshould say _happily_, considering what this man has now shown himself\nto be--some such strain of bitterness had divided his house from my\nmother's, and she had succeeded to the inheritance of hatred. When\nhe asked her for my hand, she was no longer able to command her\npassions--she raked up every injury which the rival families had\ninflicted upon each other during a bloody feud of two centuries--heaped\nhim with epithets of scorn, and rejected his proposal of alliance, as if\nit had come from the basest of mankind.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lover retired in passion; and I remained to weep and murmur against\nfortune, and--I will confess my fault--against my affectionate parent.\nI had been educated with different feelings, and the traditions of the\nfeuds and quarrels of my mother's family in Scotland, which we're to her\nmonuments and chronicles, seemed to me as insignificant and unmeaning\nas the actions and fantasies of Don Quixote; and I blamed my mother\nbitterly for sacrificing my happiness to an empty dream of family\ndignity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile I was in this humour, my lover sought a renewal of our\nintercourse. We met repeatedly in the house of the lady whom I\nhave mentioned, and who, in levity, or in the spirit of intrigue,\ncountenanced our secret correspondence. At length we were secretly\nmarried--so far did my blinded passion hurry me. My lover had secured\nthe assistance of a clergyman of the English church. Monna Paula, who\nhad been my attendant from infancy, was one witness of our union. Let me\ndo the faithful creature justice--She conjured me to suspend my purpose\ntill my mother's death should permit us to celebrate our marriage\nopenly; but the entreaties of my lover, and my own wayward passion,\nprevailed over her remonstrances. The lady I have spoken of was another\nwitness, but whether she was in full possession of my bridegroom's\nsecret, I had never the means to learn. But the shelter of her name and\nroof afforded us the means of frequently meeting, and the love of my\nhusband seemed as sincere and as unbounded as my own.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was eager, he said, to gratify his pride, by introducing me to one\nor two of his noble English friends. This could not be done at Lady\nD---'s; but by his command, which I was now entitled to consider as my\nlaw, I contrived twice to visit him at his own hotel, accompanied only\nby Monna Paula. There was a very small party, of two ladies and two\ngentlemen. There was music, mirth, and dancing. I had heard of the\nfrankness of the English nation, but I could not help thinking it\nbordered on license during these entertainments, and in the course\nof the collation which followed; but I imputed my scruples to my\ninexperience, and would not doubt the propriety of what was approved by\nmy husband.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was soon summoned to other scenes: My poor mother's disease drew to\na conclusion--Happy I am that it took place before she discovered what\nwould have cut her to the soul.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Spain you may have heard how the Catholic priests, and particularly\nthe monks, besiege the beds of the dying, to obtain bequests for the\ngood of the church. I have said that my mother's temper was irritated by\ndisease, and her judgment impaired in proportion. She gathered spirits\nand force from the resentment which the priests around her bed excited\nby their importunity, and the boldness of the stern sect of reformers,\nto which she had secretly adhered, seemed to animate her dying tongue.\nShe avowed the religion she had so long concealed; renounced all hope\nand aid which did not come by and through its dictates; rejected with\ncontempt the ceremonial of the Romish church; loaded the astonished\npriests with reproaches for their greediness and hypocrisy, and\ncommanded them to leave her house. They went in bitterness and rage,\nbut it was to return with the inquisitorial power, its warrants, and its\nofficers; and they found only the cold corpse left of her, on whom they\nhad hoped to work their vengeance. As I was soon discovered to have\nshared my mother's heresy, I was dragged from her dead body, imprisoned\nin a solitary cloister, and treated with severity, which the Abbess\nassured me was due to the looseness of my life, as well as my spiritual\nerrors. I avowed my marriage, to justify the situation in which I found\nmyself--I implored the assistance of the Superior to communicate my\nsituation to my husband. She smiled coldly at the proposal, and told\nme the church had provided a better spouse for me; advised me to secure\nmyself of divine grace hereafter, and deserve milder treatment here, by\npresently taking the veil. In order to convince me that I had no other\nresource, she showed me a royal decree, by which all my estate was\nhypothecated to the convent of Saint Magdalen, and became their complete\nproperty upon my death, or my taking the vows. As I was, both from\nreligious principle, and affectionate attachment to my husband,\nabsolutely immovable in my rejection of the veil, I believe--may heaven\nforgive me if I wrong her--that the Abbess was desirous to make sure of\nmy spoils, by hastening the former event.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a small and a poor convent, and situated among the mountains\nof Guadarrama. Some of the sisters were the daughters of neighbouring\nHidalgoes, as poor as they were proud and ignorant; others were women\nimmured there on account of their vicious conduct. The Superior herself\nwas of a high family, to which she owed her situation; but she was said\nto have disgraced her connexions by her conduct during youth, and now,\nin advanced age, covetousness and the love of power, a spirit too of\nseverity and cruelty, had succeeded to the thirst after licentious\npleasure. I suffered much under this woman--and still her dark, glassy\neye, her tall, shrouded form, and her rigid features, haunt my slumbers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was not destined to be a mother. I was very ill, and my recovery was\nlong doubtful. The most violent remedies were applied, if remedies\nthey indeed were. My health was restored at length, against my own\nexpectation and that of all around me. But, when I first again beheld\nthe reflection of my own face, I thought it was the visage of a ghost. I\nwas wont to be flattered by all, but particularly by my husband, for the\nfineness of my complexion--it was now totally gone, and, what is more\nextraordinary, it has never returned. I have observed that the few\nwho now see me, look upon me as a bloodless phantom--Such has been\nthe abiding effect of the treatment to which I was subjected. May God\nforgive those who were the agents of it!--I thank Heaven I can say so\nwith as sincere a wish, as that with which I pray for forgiveness of\nmy own sins. They now relented somewhat towards me--moved perhaps\nto compassion by my singular appearance, which bore witness to my\nsufferings; or afraid that the matter might attract attention during\na visitation of the bishop, which was approaching. One day, as I was\nwalking in the convent-garden, to which I had been lately admitted, a\nmiserable old Moorish slave, who was kept to cultivate the little\nspot, muttered as I passed him, but still keeping his wrinkled face and\ndecrepit form in the same angle with the earth--'There is Heart's Ease\nnear the postern.'\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew something of the symbolical language of flowers, once carried to\nsuch perfection among the Moriscoes of Spain; but if I had been ignorant\nof it, the captive would soon have caught at any hint which seemed\nto promise liberty. With all the haste consistent with the utmost\ncircumspection--for I might be observed by the Abbess or some of the\nsisters from the window--I hastened to the postern. It was closely\nbarred as usual, but when I coughed slightly, I was answered from the\nother side--and, O heaven! it was my husband's voice which said, 'Lose\nnot a minute here at present, but be on this spot when the vesper bell\nhas tolled.'\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI retired in an ecstasy of joy. I was not entitled or permitted to\nassist at vespers, but was accustomed to be confined to my cell while\nthe nuns were in the choir. Since my recovery, they had discontinued\nlocking the door; though the utmost severity was denounced against me\nif I left these precincts. But, let the penalty be what it would, I\nhastened to dare it.--No sooner had the last toll of the vesper bell\nceased to sound, than I stole from my chamber, reached the garden\nunobserved, hurried to the postern, beheld it open with rapture, and\nin the next moment was in my husband's arms. He had with him another\ncavalier of noble mien--both were masked and armed. Their horses, with\none saddled for my use, stood in a thicket hard by, with two other\nmasked horsemen, who seemed to be servants. In less than two minutes we\nwere mounted, and rode off as fast as we could through rough and devious\nroads, in which one of the domestics appeared to act as guide.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe hurried pace at which we rode, and the anxiety of the moment, kept\nme silent, and prevented my expressing my surprise or my joy save in a\nfew broken words. It also served as an apology for my husband's silence.\nAt length we stopped at a solitary hut--the cavaliers dismounted, and I\nwas assisted from my saddle, not by M----M----my husband, I would say,\nwho seemed busied about his horse, but by the stranger.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c'Go into the hut,' said my husband, 'change your dress with the\nspeed of lightning--you will find one to _assist_ you--we must forward\ninstantly when you have shifted your apparel.'\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI entered the hut, and was received in the arms of the faithful Monna\nPaula, who had waited my arrival for many hours, half distracted with\nfear and anxiety. With her assistance I speedily tore off the detested\ngarments of the convent, and exchanged them for a travelling suit, made\nafter the English fashion. I observed that Monna Paula was in a similar\ndress. I had but just huddled on my change of attire, when we were\nhastily summoned to mount. A horse, I found, was provided for Monna\nPaula, and we resumed our route. On the way, my convent-garb, which had\nbeen wrapped hastily together around a stone, was thrown into a lake,\nalong the verge of which we were then passing. The two cavaliers rode\ntogether in front, my attendant and I followed, and the servants brought\nup the rear. Monna Paula, as we rode on, repeatedly entreated me to\nbe silent upon the road, as our lives depended on it. I was easily\nreconciled to be passive, for, the first fever of spirits which attended\nthe sense of liberation and of gratified affection having passed away, I\nfelt as it were dizzy with the rapid motion; and my utmost exertion was\nnecessary to keep my place on the saddle, until we suddenly (it was now\nvery dark) saw a strong light before us.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy husband reined up his horse, and gave a signal by a low whistle\ntwice repeated, which was answered from a distance. The whole party then\nhalted under the boughs of a large cork-tree, and my husband, drawing\nhimself close to my side, said, in a voice which I then thought was only\nembarrassed by fear for my safety,--'We must now part. Those to whom I\ncommit you are contrabandists, who only know you as English-women, but\nwho, for a high bribe, have undertaken to escort you through the passes\nof the Pyrenees as far as Saint Jean de Luz.'\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c'And do you not go with us?' I exclaimed with emphasis, though in a\nwhisper.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c'It is impossible,' he said, 'and would ruin all--See that you speak\nin English in these people's hearing, and give not the least sign of\nunderstanding what they say in Spanish--your life depends on it; for,\nthough they live in opposition to, and evasion of, the laws of Spain,\nthey would tremble at the idea of violating those of the church--I see\nthem coming--farewell--farewell.'\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe last words were hastily uttered-I endeavoured to detain him yet a\nmoment by my feeble grasp on his cloak.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c'You will meet me, then, I trust, at Saint Jean de Luz?'\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c'Yes, yes,' he answered hastily, 'at Saint Jean de Luz you will meet\nyour protector.'\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe then extricated his cloak from my grasp, and was lost in the\ndarkness. His companion approached--kissed my hand, which in the\nagony of the moment I was scarce sensible of, and followed my husband,\nattended by one of the domestics.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe tears of Hermione here flowed so fast as to threaten the\ninterruption of her narrative. When she resumed it, it was with a kind\nof apology to Margaret.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery circumstance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009coccurring in those moments, when I\nstill enjoyed a delusive idea of happiness, is deeply imprinted in my\nremembrance, which, respecting all that has since happened, is waste and\nunvaried as an Arabian desert. But I have no right to inflict on you,\nMargaret, agitated as you are with your own anxieties, the unavailing\ndetails of my useless recollections.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMargaret's eyes were full of tears--it was impossible it could\nbe otherwise, considering that the tale was told by her suffering\nbenefactress, and resembled, in some respects, her own situation; and\nyet she must not be severely blamed, if, while eagerly pressing her\npatroness to continue her narrative, her eye involuntarily sought the\ndoor, as if to chide the delay of Monna Paula.\n\nThe Lady Hermione saw and forgave these conflicting emotions; and\nshe, too, must be pardoned, if, in her turn, the minute detail of her\nnarrative showed, that, in the discharge of feelings so long locked\nin her own bosom, she rather forgot those which were personal to\nher auditor, and by which it must be supposed Margaret's mind was\nprincipally occupied, if not entirely engrossed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI told you, I think, that one domestic followed the gentlemen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thus\nthe lady continued her story, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe other remained with us for the\npurpose, as it seemed, of introducing us to two persons whom M--, I\nsay, whom my husband's signal had brought to the spot. A word or two of\nexplanation passed between them and the servant, in a sort of _patois_,\nwhich I did not understand; and one of the strangers taking hold of my\nbridle, the other of Monna Paula's, they led us towards the light,\nwhich I have already said was the signal of our halting. I touched Monna\nPaula, and was sensible that she trembled very much, which surprised me,\nbecause I knew her character to be so strong and bold as to border upon\nthe masculine.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we reached the fire, the gipsy figures of those who surrounded it,\nwith their swarthy features, large Sombrero hats, girdles stuck full\nof pistols and poniards, and all the other apparatus of a roving and\nperilous life, would have terrified me at another moment. But then I\nonly felt the agony of having parted from my husband almost in the very\nmoment of my rescue. The females of the gang--for there were four or\nfive women amongst these contraband traders--received us with a sort of\nrude courtesy. They were, in dress and manners, not extremely different\nfrom the men with whom they associated--were almost as hardy and\nadventurous, carried arms like them, and were, as we learned from\npassing circumstances, scarce less experienced in the use of them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was impossible not to fear these wild people; yet they gave us no\nreason to complain of them, but used us on all occasions with a kind of\nclumsy courtesy, accommodating themselves to our wants and our weakness\nduring the journey, even while we heard them grumbling to each other\nagainst our effeminacy,--like some rude carrier, who, in charge of a\npackage of valuable and fragile ware, takes every precaution for its\npreservation, while he curses the unwonted trouble which it occasions\nhim. Once or twice, when they were disappointed in their contraband\ntraffic, lost some goods in a rencontre with the Spanish officers of\nthe revenue, and were finally pursued by a military force, their murmurs\nassumed a more alarming tone, in the terrified ears of my attendant and\nmyself, when, without daring to seem to understand them, we heard them\ncurse the insular heretics, on whose account God, Saint James, and\nOur Lady of the Pillar, had blighted their hopes of profit. These are\ndreadful recollections, Margaret.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, then, dearest lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Margaret, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill you thus dwell on\nthem?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is only,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady Hermione, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause I linger like a criminal\non the scaffold, and would fain protract the time that must inevitably\nbring on the final catastrophe. Yes, dearest Margaret, I rest and dwell\non the events of that journey, marked as it was by fatigue and danger,\nthough the road lay through the wildest and most desolate deserts and\nmountains, and though our companions, both men and women, were fierce\nand lawless themselves, and exposed to the most merciless retaliation\nfrom those with whom they were constantly engaged--yet would I rather\ndwell on these hazardous events than tell that which awaited me at Saint\nJean de Luz.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you arrived there in safety?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, maiden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Lady Hermione; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand were guided by the chief\nof our outlawed band to the house which had been assigned for reception,\nwith the same punctilious accuracy with which he would have delivered a\nbale of uncustomed goods to a correspondent. I was told a gentleman\nhad expected me for two days--I rushed into the apartment, and, when\nI expected to embrace my husband--I found myself in the arms of his\nfriend!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe villain!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Margaret, whose anxiety had, in spite of\nherself, been a moment suspended by the narrative of the lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Hermione, calmly, though her voice somewhat faltered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\nis the name that best--that well befits him. He, Margaret, for whom I\nhad sacrificed all--whose love and whose memory were dearer to me than\nmy freedom, when I was in the convent--than my life, when I was on my\nperilous journey--had taken his measures to shake me off, and transfer\nme, as a privileged wanton, to the protection of his libertine\nfriend. At first the stranger laughed at my tears and my agony, as the\nhysterical passion of a deluded and overreached wanton, or the wily\naffection of a courtezan. My claim of marriage he laughed at, assuring\nme he knew it was a mere farce required by me, and submitted to by his\nfriend, to save some reserve of delicacy; and expressed his surprise\nthat I should consider in any other light a ceremony which could be\nvalid neither in Spain nor England, and insultingly offered to remove\nmy scruples, by renewing such a union with me himself. My exclamations\nbrought Monna Paula to my aid--she was not, indeed, far distant, for she\nhad expected some such scene.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood heaven!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas she a confidant of your base\nhusband?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Hermione, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo her not that injustice. It was her\npersevering inquiries that discovered the place of my confinement--it\nwas she who gave the information to my husband, and who remarked even\nthen that the news was so much more interesting to his friend than to\nhim, that she suspected, from an early period, it was the purpose of the\nvillain to shake me off. On the journey, her suspicions were confirmed.\nShe had heard him remark to his companion, with a cold sarcastic\nsneer, the total change which my prison and my illness had made on my\ncomplexion; and she had heard the other reply, that the defect might be\ncured by a touch of Spanish red. This, and other circumstances, having\nprepared her for such treachery, Monna Paula now entered, completely\npossessed of herself, and prepared to support me. Her calm\nrepresentations went farther with the stranger than the expressions of\nmy despair. If he did not entirely believe our tale, he at least\nacted the part of a man of honour, who would not intrude himself\non defenceless females, whatever was their character; desisted from\npersecuting us with his presence; and not only directed Monna Paula how\nwe should journey to Paris, but furnished her with money for the purpose\nof our journey. From the capital I wrote to Master Heriot, my father's\nmost trusted correspondent; he came instantly to Paris on receiving\nthe letter; and--But here comes Monna Paula, with more than the sum you\ndesired. Take it, my dearest maiden--serve this youth if you will. But,\nO Margaret, look for no gratitude in return!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Lady Hermione took the bag of gold from her attendant, and gave it\nto her young friend, who threw herself into her arms, kissed her on\nboth the pale cheeks, over which the sorrows so newly awakened by\nher narrative had drawn many tears, then sprung up, wiped her own\noverflowing eyes, and left the Foljambe apartments with a hasty and\nresolved step.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\n  Rove not from pole to pole-the man lives here\n  Whose razor's only equall'd by his beer;\n  And where, in either sense, the cockney-put\n  May, if he pleases, get confounded cut.\n       _On the sign of an Alehouse kept by a Barber._\n\nWe are under the necessity of transporting our readers to the habitation\nof Benjamin Suddlechop, the husband of the active and efficient Dame\nUrsula, and who also, in his own person, discharged more offices than\none. For, besides trimming locks and beards, and turning whiskers upward\ninto the martial and swaggering curl, or downward into the drooping\nform which became mustaches of civil policy; besides also occasionally\nletting blood, either by cupping or by the lancet, extracting a stump,\nand performing other actions of petty pharmacy, very nearly as well as\nhis neighbour Raredrench, the apothecary: he could, on occasion, draw\na cup of beer as well as a tooth, tap a hogshead as well as a vein, and\nwash, with a draught of good ale, the mustaches which his art had just\ntrimmed. But he carried on these trades apart from each other.\n\nHis barber's shop projected its long and mysterious pole into Fleet\nStreet, painted party-coloured-wise, to represent the ribbons with\nwhich, in elder times, that ensign was garnished. In the window were\nseen rows of teeth displayed upon strings like rosaries--cups with a red\nrag at the bottom, to resemble blood, an intimation that patients\nmight be bled, cupped, or blistered, with the assistance of \u00e2\u0080\u009csufficient\nadvice;\u00e2\u0080\u009d while the more profitable, but less honourable operations upon\nthe hair of the head and beard, were briefly and gravely announced.\nWithin was the well-worn leather chair for customers, the guitar, then\ncalled a ghittern or cittern, with which a customer might amuse himself\ntill his predecessor was dismissed from under Benjamin's hands, and\nwhich, therefore, often flayed the ears of the patient metaphorically,\nwhile his chin sustained from the razor literal scarification. All,\ntherefore, in this department, spoke the chirurgeon-barber, or the\nbarber-chirurgeon.\n\nBut there was a little back-room, used as a private tap-room, which had\na separate entrance by a dark and crooked alley, which communicated with\nFleet Street, after a circuitous passage through several by-lanes\nand courts. This retired temple of Bacchus had also a connexion with\nBenjamin's more public shop by a long and narrow entrance, conducting to\nthe secret premises in which a few old topers used to take their morning\ndraught, and a few gill-sippers their modicum of strong waters, in a\nbashful way, after having entered the barber's shop under pretence of\nbeing shaved. Besides, this obscure tap-room gave a separate admission\nto the apartments of Dame Ursley, which she was believed to make use of\nin the course of her multifarious practice, both to let herself secretly\nout, and to admit clients and employers who cared not to be seen to\nvisit her in public. Accordingly, after the hour of noon, by which time\nthe modest and timid whetters, who were Benjamin's best customers, had\neach had his draught, or his thimbleful, the business of the tap was in\na manner ended, and the charge of attending the back-door passed from\none of the barber's apprentices to the little mulatto girl, the dingy\nIris of Dame Suddlechop. Then came mystery thick upon mystery; muffled\ngallants, and masked females, in disguises of different fashions, were\nseen to glide through the intricate mazes of the alley; and even the low\ntap on the door, which frequently demanded the attention of the\nlittle Creole, had in it something that expressed secrecy and fear of\ndiscovery.\n\nIt was the evening of the same day when Margaret had held the long\nconference with the Lady Hermione, that Dame Suddlechop had directed her\nlittle portress to \u00e2\u0080\u009ckeep the door fast as a miser's purse-strings; and,\nas she valued her saffron skin, to let in none but---\u00e2\u0080\u009d the name she\nadded in a whisper, and accompanied it with a nod. The little domestic\nblinked intelligence, went to her post, and in brief time thereafter\nadmitted and ushered into the presence of the dame, that very\ncity-gallant whose clothes sat awkwardly upon him, and who had behaved\nso doughtily in the fray which befell at Nigel's first visit to\nBeaujeu's ordinary. The mulatto introduced him--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMissis, fine young\ngentleman, all over gold and velvet \u00e2\u0080\u009c--then muttered to herself as she\nshut the door, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfine young gentleman, he!--apprentice to him who makes\nthe tick-tick.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was indeed--we are sorry to say it, and trust our readers will\nsympathize with the interest we take in the matter--it was indeed honest\nJin Vin, who had been so far left to his own devices, and abandoned by\nhis better angel, as occasionally to travesty himself in this fashion,\nand to visit, in the dress of a gallant of the day, those places of\npleasure and dissipation, in which it would have been everlasting\ndiscredit to him to have been seen in his real character and condition;\nthat is, had it been possible for him in his proper shape to have gained\nadmission. There was now a deep gloom on his brow, his rich habit was\nhastily put on, and buttoned awry; his belt buckled in a most disorderly\nfashion, so that his sword stuck outwards from his side, instead of\nhanging by it with graceful negligence; while his poniard, though fairly\nhatched and gilded, stuck in his girdle like a butcher's steel in\nthe fold of his blue apron. Persons of fashion had, by the way, the\nadvantage formerly of being better distinguished from the vulgar than at\npresent; for, what the ancient farthingale and more modern hoop were to\ncourt ladies, the sword was to the gentleman; an article of dress, which\nonly rendered those ridiculous who assumed it for the nonce, without\nbeing in the habit of wearing it. Vincent's rapier got between his legs,\nand, as he stumbled over it, he exclaimed--\u00e2\u0080\u009cZounds! 'tis the second time\nit has served me thus--I believe the damned trinket knows I am no true\ngentleman, and does it of set purpose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, come, mine honest Jin Vin--come, my good boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the dame, in\na soothing tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnever mind these trankums--a frank and hearty London\n'prentice is worth all the gallants of the inns of court.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was a frank and hearty London 'prentice before I knew you, Dame\nSuddlechop,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Vincent; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat your advice has made me, you may find a\nname for; since, fore George! I am ashamed to think about it myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA-well-a-day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d quoth the dame, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand is it even so with thee?--nay,\nthen, I know but one cure;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and with that, going to a little corner\ncupboard of carved wainscoat, she opened it by the assistance of a key,\nwhich, with half-a-dozen besides, hung in a silver chain at her girdle,\nand produced a long flask of thin glass cased with wicker, bringing\nforth at the same time two Flemish rummer glasses, with long stalks and\ncapacious wombs. She filled the one brimful for her guest, and the other\nmore modestly to about two-thirds of its capacity, for her own\nuse, repeating, as the rich cordial trickled forth in a smooth oily\nstream--\u00e2\u0080\u009cRight Rosa Solis, as ever washed mulligrubs out of a moody\nbrain!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut, though Jin Vin tossed off his glass without scruple, while the lady\nsippped hers more moderately, it did not appear to produce the expected\namendment upon his humour. On the contrary, as he threw himself into the\ngreat leathern chair, in which Dame Ursley was wont to solace herself of\nan evening, he declared himself \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe most miserable dog within the sound\nof Bow-bell.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd why should you be so idle as to think yourself so, silly boy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nDame Suddlechop; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut 'tis always thus--fools and children never know\nwhen they are well. Why, there is not one that walks in St. Paul's,\nwhether in flat cap, or hat and feather, that has so many kind glances\nfrom the wenches as you, when ye swagger along Fleet Street with your\nbat under your arm, and your cap set aside upon your head. Thou knowest\nwell, that, from Mrs. Deputy's self down to the waist-coateers in the\nalley, all of them are twiring and peeping betwixt their fingers when\nyou pass; and yet you call yourself a miserable dog! and I must tell\nyou all this over and over again, as if I were whistling the chimes\nof London to a pettish child, in order to bring the pretty baby into\ngood-humour!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe flattery of Dame Ursula seemed to have the fate of her cordial--it\nwas swallowed, indeed, by the party to whom she presented it, and that\nwith some degree of relish, but it did not operate as a sedative on the\ndisturbed state of the youth's mind. He laughed for an instant, half\nin scorn, and half in gratified vanity, but cast a sullen look on Dame\nUrsley as he replied to her last words,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou do treat me like a child indeed, when you sing over and over to me\na cuckoo song that I care not a copper-filing for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAha!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Ursley; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is to say, you care not if you please\nall, unless you please one--You are a true lover, I warrant, and care\nnot for all the city, from here to Whitechapel, so you could write\nyourself first in your pretty Peg-a-Ramsay's good-will. Well, well, take\npatience, man, and be guided by me, for I will be the hoop will bind you\ntogether at last.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is time you were so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor hitherto you have rather\nbeen the wedge to separate us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDame Suddlechop had by this time finished her cordial--it was not the\nfirst she had taken that day; and, though a woman of strong brain,\nand cautious at least, if not abstemious, in her potations, it may\nnevertheless be supposed that her patience was not improved by the\nregimen which she observed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, thou ungracious and ingrate knave,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Ursley, \u00e2\u0080\u009chave not\nI done every thing to put thee in thy mistress's good graces? She loves\ngentry, the proud Scottish minx, as a Welshman loves cheese, and has\nher father's descent from that Duke of Daldevil, or whatsoever she calls\nhim, as close in her heart as gold in a miser's chest, though she\nas seldom shows it--and none she will think of, or have, but a\ngentleman--and a gentleman I have made of thee, Jin Vin, the devil\ncannot deny that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have made a fool of me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said poor Jenkin, looking at the sleeve of\nhis jacket.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever the worse gentleman for that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Ursley, laughing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what is worse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, turning his back to her suddenly, and\nwrithing in his chair, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have made a rogue of me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever the worse gentleman for that neither,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Ursley, in the\nsame tone; \u00e2\u0080\u009clet a man bear his folly gaily and his knavery stoutly, and\nlet me see if gravity or honesty will look him in the face now-a-days.\nTut, man, it was only in the time of King Arthur or King Lud, that a\ngentleman was held to blemish his scutcheon by a leap over the line\nof reason or honesty--It is the bold look, the ready hand, the fine\nclothes, the brisk oath, and the wild brain, that makes the gallant\nnow-a-days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know what you have made me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jin Vin; \u00e2\u0080\u009csince I have given up\nskittles and trap-ball for tennis and bowls, good English ale for thin\nBordeaux and sour Rhenish, roast-beef and pudding for woodcocks and\nkickshaws--my bat for a sword, my cap for a beaver, my forsooth for\na modish oath, my Christmas-box for a dice-box, my religion for the\ndevil's matins, and mine honest name for--Woman, I could brain thee,\nwhen I think whose advice has guided me in all this!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhose advice, then? whose advice, then? Speak out, thou poor, petty\ncloak-brusher, and say who advised thee!\u00e2\u0080\u009d retorted Dame Ursley, flushed\nand indignant--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMarry come up, my paltry companion--say by whose advice\nyou have made a gamester of yourself, and a thief besides, as your\nwords would bear--The Lord deliver us from evil!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And here Dame Ursley\ndevoutly crossed herself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHark ye, Dame Ursley Suddlechop,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin, starting up, his dark\neyes flashing with anger; \u00e2\u0080\u009cremember I am none of your husband--and, if\nI were, you would do well not to forget whose threshold was swept\nwhen they last rode the Skimmington [Footnote: A species of triumphal\nprocession in honour of female supremacy, when it rose to such a height\nas to attract the attention of the neighbourhood. It is described at\nfull length in Hudibras. (Part II. Canto II.) As the procession passed\non, those who attended it in an official capacity were wont to sweep\nthe threshold of the houses in which Fame affirmed the mistresses to\nexercise paramount authority, which was given and received as a hint\nthat their inmates might, in their turn, be made the subject of a\nsimilar ovation. The Skimmington, which in some degree resembled\nthe proceedings of Mumbo Jumbo in an African village, has been long\ndiscontinued in England, apparently because female rule has become\neither milder or less frequent than among our ancestors.] upon such\nanother scolding jade as yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope to see you ride up Holborn next,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Ursley, provoked out\nof all her holiday and sugar-plum expressions, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith a nosegay at your\nbreast, and a parson at your elbow!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat may well be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Jin Vin, bitterly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I walk by your\ncounsels as I have begun by them; but, before that day comes, you\nshall know that Jin Vin has the brisk boys of Fleet Street still at\nhis wink.--Yes, you jade, you shall be carted for bawd and conjurer,\ndouble-dyed in grain, and bing off to Bridewell, with every brass basin\nbetwixt the Bar and Paul's beating before you, as if the devil were\nbanging them with his beef-hook.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDame Ursley coloured like scarlet, seized upon the half-emptied flask of\ncordial, and seemed, by her first gesture, about to hurl it at the head\nof her adversary; but suddenly, and as if by a strong internal effort,\nshe checked her outrageous resentment, and, putting the bottle to its\nmore legitimate use, filled, with wonderful composure, the two glasses,\nand, taking up one of them, said, with a smile, which better became her\ncomely and jovial countenance than the fury by which it was animated the\nmoment before--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere is to thee, Jin Vin, my lad, in all loving kindness, whatever\nspite thou bearest to me, that have always been a mother to thee.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJenkin's English good-nature could not resist this forcible appeal; he\ntook up the other glass, and lovingly pledged the dame in her cup of\nreconciliation, and proceeded to make a kind of grumbling apology for\nhis own violence--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor you know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit was you persuaded me to get these fine\nthings, and go to that godless ordinary, and ruffle it with the best,\nand bring you home all the news; and you said, I, that was the cock\nof the ward, would soon be the cock of the ordinary, and would win\nten times as much at gleek and primero, as I used to do at put and\nbeggar-my-neighbour--and turn up doublets with the dice, as busily as I\nwas wont to trowl down the ninepins in the skittle-ground--and then you\nsaid I should bring you such news out of the ordinary as should make\nus all, when used as you knew how to use it--and now you see what is to\ncome of it all!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c'Tis all true thou sayest, lad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the dame; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut thou must have\npatience. Rome was not built in a day--you cannot become used to your\ncourt-suit in a month's time, any more than when you changed your long\ncoat for a doublet and hose; and in gaming you must expect to lose as\nwell as gain--'tis the sitting gamester sweeps the board.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe board has swept me, I know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Jin Vin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand that pretty\nclean out.--I would that were the worst; but I owe for all this finery,\nand settling-day is coming on, and my master will find my accompt worse\nthan it should be by a score of pieces. My old father will be called in\nto make them good; and I--may save the hangman a labour and do the job\nmyself, or go the Virginia voyage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not speak so loud, my dear boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Ursley; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut tell me why\nyou borrow not from a friend to make up your arrear. You could lend him\nas much when his settling-day came round.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no--I have had enough of that work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Vincent. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTunstall would\nlend me the money, poor fellow, an he had it; but his gentle, beggarly\nkindred, plunder him of all, and keep him as bare as a birch at\nChristmas. No--my fortune may be spelt in four letters, and these read,\nRUIN.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow hush, you simple craven,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the dame; \u00e2\u0080\u009cdid you never hear, that\nwhen the need is highest the help is nighest? We may find aid for you\nyet, and sooner than you are aware of. I am sure I would never have\nadvised you to such a course, but only you had set heart and eye on\npretty Mistress Marget, and less would not serve you--and what could\nI do but advise you to cast your city-slough, and try your luck where\nfolks find fortune?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay--I remember your counsel well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was to be\nintroduced to her by you when I was perfect in my gallantries, and as\nrich as the king; and then she was to be surprised to find I was poor\nJin Vin, that used to watch, from matin to curfew, for one glance of\nher eye; and now, instead of that, she has set her soul on this Scottish\nsparrow-hawk of a lord that won my last tester, and be cursed to him;\nand so I am bankrupt in love, fortune, and character, before I am out of\nmy time, and all along of you, Mother Midnight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not call me out of my own name, my dear boy, Jin Vin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered\nUrsula, in a tone betwixt rage and coaxing,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cdo not; because I am no\nsaint, but a poor sinful woman, with no more patience than she needs,\nto carry her through a thousand crosses. And if I have done you wrong by\nevil counsel, I must mend it and put you right by good advice. And for\nthe score of pieces that must be made up at settling-day, why, here is,\nin a good green purse, as much as will make that matter good; and\nwe will get old Crosspatch, the tailor, to take a long day for your\nclothes; and--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMother, are you serious?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jin Vin, unable to trust either his eyes\nor his ears.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn troth am I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the dame; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand will you call me Mother Midnight\nnow, Jin Vin?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMother Midnight!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Jenkin, hugging the dame in his transport,\nand bestowing on her still comely cheek a hearty and not unacceptable\nsmack, that sounded like the report of a pistol,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMother Midday,\nrather, that has risen to light me out of my troubles--a mother more\ndear than she who bore me; for she, poor soul, only brought me into a\nworld of sin and sorrow, and your timely aid has helped me out of the\none and the other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And the good-natured fellow threw himself back in\nhis chair, and fairly drew his hand across his eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou would not have me be made to ride the Skimmington then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\ndame; \u00e2\u0080\u009cor parade me in a cart, with all the brass basins of the ward\nbeating the march to Bridewell before me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would sooner be carted to Tyburn myself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the penitent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, then, sit up like a man, and wipe thine eyes; and, if thou art\npleased with what I have done, I will show thee how thou mayst requite\nme in the highest degree.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin Vincent, sitting straight up in his chair.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\nwould have me, then, do you some service for this friendship of yours?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, marry would I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Ursley; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor you are to know, that though\nI am right glad to stead you with it, this gold is not mine, but was\nplaced in my hands in order to find a trusty agent, for a certain\npurpose; and so--But what's the matter with you?--are you fool enough to\nbe angry because you cannot get a purse of gold for nothing? I would\nI knew where such were to come by. I never could find them lying in my\nroad, I promise you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, dame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said poor Jenkin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is not for that; for, look you,\nI would rather work these ten bones to the knuckles, and live by my\nlabour; but--\u00e2\u0080\u009d (and here he paused.)\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what, man?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Ursley. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are willing to work for what you\nwant; and yet, when I offer you gold for the winning, you look on me as\nthe devil looks over Lincoln.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is ill talking of the devil, mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had him even\nnow in my head--for, look you, I am at that pass, when they say he\nwill appear to wretched ruined creatures, and proffer them gold for the\nfee-simple of their salvation. But I have been trying these two days to\nbring my mind strongly up to the thought, that I will rather sit down\nin shame, and sin, and sorrow, as I am like to do, than hold on in ill\ncourses to get rid of my present straits; and so take care, Dame Ursula,\nhow you tempt me to break such a good resolution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI tempt you to nothing, young man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Ursula; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand, as I\nperceive you are too wilful to be wise, I will e'en put my purse in my\npocket, and look out for some one that will work my turn with better\nwill, and more thankfulness. And you may go your own course,--break\nyour indenture, ruin your father, lose your character, and bid pretty\nMistress Margaret farewell, for ever and a day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStay, stay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe woman is in as great a hurry as a brown\nbaker when his oven is overheated. First, let me hear that which you\nhave to propose to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, after all, it is but to get a gentleman of rank and fortune, who\nis in trouble, carried in secret down the river, as far as the Isle of\nDogs, or somewhere thereabout, where he may lie concealed until he can\nescape aboard. I know thou knowest every place by the river's side as\nwell as the devil knows an usurer, or the beggar knows his dish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA plague of your similes, dame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the apprentice; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor the devil\ngave me that knowledge, and beggary may be the end on't.--But what has\nthis gentleman done, that he should need to be under hiding? No Papist,\nI hope--no Catesby and Piercy business--no Gunpowder Plot?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFy, fy!--what do you take me for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Ursula. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am as good a\nchurchwoman as the parson's wife, save that necessary business will not\nallow me to go there oftener than on Christmas-day, heaven help me!--No,\nno--this is no Popish matter. The gentleman hath but struck another in\nthe Park--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHa! what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Vincent, interrupting her with a start.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, I see you guess whom I mean. It is even he we have spoken of so\noften--just Lord Glenvarloch, and no one else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nVincent sprung from his seat, and traversed the room with rapid and\ndisorderly steps.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere, there it is now--you are always ice or gunpowder. You sit in the\ngreat leathern armchair, as quiet as a rocket hangs upon the frame in a\nrejoicing-night till the match be fired, and then, whizz! you are in the\nthird heaven, beyond the reach of the human voice, eye, or brain.--When\nyou have wearied yourself with padding to and fro across the room, will\nyou tell me your determination, for time presses? Will you aid me in\nthis matter, or not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo--no--no--a thousand times no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Jenkin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you not\nconfessed to me, that Margaret loves him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the dame, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat she thinks she does; but that will not\nlast long.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd have I not told you but this instant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Jenkin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat it was\nthis same Glenvarloch that rooked me, at the ordinary, of every penny I\nhad, and made a knave of me to boot, by gaining more than was my own?--O\nthat cursed gold, which Shortyard, the mercer, paid me that morning on\naccompt, for mending the clock of Saint Stephen's! If I had not, by ill\nchance, had that about me, I could but have beggared my purse, without\nblemishing my honesty; and, after I had been rooked of all the rest\namongst them, I must needs risk the last five pieces with that shark\namong the minnows!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGranted,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Ursula. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll this I know; and I own, that as Lord\nGlenvarloch was the last you played with, you have a right to charge\nyour ruin on his head. Moreover, I admit, as already said, that Margaret\nhas made him your rival. Yet surely, now he is in danger to lose his\nhand, it is not a time to remember all this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my faith, but it is, though,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young citizen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLose his\nhand, indeed? They may take his head, for what I care. Head and hand\nhave made me a miserable wretch!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, were it not better, my prince of flat-caps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Ursula,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat matters were squared between you; and that, through means of the\nsame Scottish lord, who has, as you say, deprived you of your money and\nyour mistress, you should in a short time recover both?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd how can your wisdom come to that conclusion, dame?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\napprentice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy money, indeed, I can conceive--that is, if I comply with\nyour proposal; but--my pretty Marget!--how serving this lord, whom\nshe has set her nonsensical head upon, can do me good with her, is far\nbeyond my conception.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is because, in simple phrase,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Ursula, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou knowest no\nmore of a woman's heart than doth a Norfolk gosling. Look you, man.\nWere I to report to Mistress Margaret that the young lord has miscarried\nthrough thy lack of courtesy in refusing to help him, why, then, thou\nwert odious to her for ever. She will loathe thee as she will loathe the\nvery cook who is to strike off Glenvarloch's hand with his cleaver--and\nthen she will be yet more fixed in her affections towards this lord.\nLondon will hear of nothing but him--speak of nothing but him--think\nof nothing but him, for three weeks at least, and all that outcry will\nserve to keep him uppermost in her mind; for nothing pleases a girl so\nmuch as to bear relation to any one who is the talk of the whole world\naround her. Then, if he suffer this sentence of the law, it is a chance\nif she ever forgets him. I saw that handsome, proper young gentleman\nBabington, suffer in the Queen's time myself, and though I was then but\na girl, he was in my head for a year after he was hanged. But, above\nall, pardoned or punished, Glenvarloch will probably remain in London,\nand his presence will keep up the silly girl's nonsensical fancy about\nhim. Whereas, if he escapes--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, show me how that is to avail me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf he escapes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said the dame, resuming her argument, \u00e2\u0080\u009che must resign the Court for\nyears, if not for life; and you know the old saying, 'out of sight, and\nout of mind.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue--most true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin; \u00e2\u0080\u009cspoken like an oracle, most wise\nUrsula.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, I knew you would hear reason at last,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the wily dame; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand\nthen, when this same lord is off and away for once and for ever, who, I\npray you, is to be pretty pet's confidential person, and who is to fill\nup the void in her affections?--why, who but thou, thou pearl of\n'prentices! And then you will have overcome your own inclinations to\ncomply with hers, and every woman is sensible of that--and you will have\nrun some risk, too, in carrying her desires into effect--and what is it\nthat woman likes better than bravery, and devotion to her will? Then you\nhave her secret, and she must treat you with favour and observance, and\nrepose confidence in you, and hold private intercourse with you, till\nshe weeps with one eye for the absent lover whom she is never to see\nagain, and blinks with the other blithely upon him who is in presence;\nand then if you know not how to improve the relation in which you stand\nwith her, you are not the brisk lively lad that all the world takes you\nfor--Said I well?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have spoken like an empress, most mighty Ursula,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin\nVincent; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand your will shall be obeyed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know Alsatia well?\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued his tutoress.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell enough, well enough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied he with a nod; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have heard the\ndice rattle there in my day, before I must set up for gentleman, and go\namong the gallants at the Shavaleer Bojo's, as they call him,--the worse\nrookery of the two, though the feathers are the gayest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd they will have a respect for thee yonder, I warrant?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Vin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen I am got into my fustian doublet again,\nwith my bit of a trunnion under my arm, I can walk Alsatia at midnight\nas I could do that there Fleet Street in midday--they will not one of\nthem swagger with the prince of 'prentices, and the king of clubs--they\nknow I could bring every tall boy in the ward down upon them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you know all the watermen, and so forth?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan converse with every sculler in his own language, from Richmond to\nGravesend, and know all the water-cocks, from John Taylor the Poet to\nlittle Grigg the Grinner, who never pulls but he shows all his teeth\nfrom ear to ear, as if he were grimacing through a horse-collar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you can take any dress or character upon you well, such as a\nwaterman's, a butcher's, a foot-soldier's,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Ursula, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor the\nlike?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot such a mummer as I am within the walls, and thou knowest that\nwell enough, dame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the apprentice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can touch the players\nthemselves, at the Ball and at the Fortune, for presenting any thing\nexcept a gentleman. Take but this d--d skin of frippery off me, which\nI think the devil stuck me into, and you shall put me into nothing else\nthat I will not become as if I were born to it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, we will talk of your transmutation by and by,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the dame,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand find you clothes withal, and money besides; for it will take a good\ndeal to carry the thing handsomely through.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut where is that money to come from, dame?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is a\nquestion I would fain have answered before I touch it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, what a fool art thou to ask such a question! Suppose I am content\nto advance it to please young madam, what is the harm then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will suppose no such thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin, hastily; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know that you,\ndame, have no gold to spare, and maybe would not spare it if you had--so\nthat cock will not crow. It must be from Margaret herself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, thou suspicious animal, and what if it were?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ursula.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Jenkin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I will presently to her, and learn if\nshe has come fairly by so much ready money; for sooner than connive at\nher getting it by any indirection, I would hang myself at once. It is\nenough what I have done myself, no need to engage poor Margaret in such\nvillainy--I'll to her, and tell her of the danger--I will, by heaven!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are mad to think of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Suddlechop, considerably\nalarmed--\u00e2\u0080\u009chear me but a moment. I know not precisely from whom she got\nthe money; but sure I am that she obtained it at her godfather's.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Master George Heriot is not returned from France,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Ursula, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut Dame Judith is at home--and the strange lady,\nwhom they call Master Heriot's ghost--she never goes abroad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is very true, Dame Suddlechop,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I believe you have\nguessed right--they say that lady has coin at will; and if Marget can\nget a handful of fairy-gold, why, she is free to throw it away at will.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, Jin Vin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the dame, reducing her voice almost to a whisper,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwe should not want gold at will neither, could we but read the riddle\nof that lady!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey may read it that list,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll never pry into what\nconcerns me not--Master George Heriot is a worthy and brave citizen, and\nan honour to London, and has a right to manage his own household as he\nlikes best.--There was once a talk of rabbling him the fifth of November\nbefore the last, because they said he kept a nunnery in his house, like\nold Lady Foljambe; but Master George is well loved among the 'prentices,\nand we got so many brisk boys of us together as should have rabbled the\nrabble, had they had but the heart to rise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, let that pass,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ursula; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand now, tell me how you will\nmanage to be absent from shop a day or two, for you must think that this\nmatter will not be ended sooner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, as to that, I can say nothing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have always served\nduly and truly; I have no heart to play truant, and cheat my master of\nhis time as well as his money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, but the point is to get back his money for him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ursula,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich he is not likely to see on other conditions. Could you not ask\nleave to go down to your uncle in Essex for two or three days? He may be\nill, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, if I must, I must,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin, with a heavy sigh; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I will\nnot be lightly caught treading these dark and crooked paths again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHush thee, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the dame, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand get leave for this very evening;\nand come back hither, and I will introduce you to another implement,\nwho must be employed in the matter.--Stay, stay!--the lad is mazed--you\nwould not go into your master's shop in that guise, surely? Your trunk\nis in the matted chamber, with your 'prentice things--go and put them on\nas fast as you can.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think I am bewitched,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin, giving a glance towards his\ndress, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor that these fool's trappings have made as great an ass of\nme as of many I have seen wear them; but let line once be rid of the\nharness, and if you catch me putting it on again, I will give you leave\nto sell me to a gipsy, to carry pots, pans, and beggar's bantlings, all\nthe rest of my life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he retired to change his apparel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\n  Chance will not do the work--Chance sends the breeze;\n  But if the pilot slumber at the helm,\n  The very wind that wafts us towards the port\n  May dash us on the shelves.--The steersman's part is vigilance,\n  Blow it or rough or smooth.\n                               _Old Play_.\n\nWe left Nigel, whose fortunes we are bound to trace by the engagement\ncontracted in our title-page, sad and solitary in the mansion of\nTrapbois the usurer, having just received a letter instead of a visit\nfrom his friend the Templar, stating reasons why he could not at\nthat time come to see him in Alsatia. So that it appeared that his\nintercourse with the better and more respectable class of society, was,\nfor the present, entirely cut off. This was a melancholy, and, to a\nproud mind like that of Nigel, a degrading reflection.\n\nHe went to the window of his apartment, and found the street enveloped\nin one of those thick, dingy, yellow-coloured fogs, which often invest\nthe lower part of London and Westminster. Amid the darkness, dense and\npalpable, were seen to wander like phantoms a reveller or two, whom the\nmorning had surprised where the evening left them; and who now, with\ntottering steps, and by an instinct which intoxication could not wholly\novercome, were groping the way to their own homes, to convert day into\nnight, for the purpose of sleeping off the debauch which had turned\nnight into day. Although it was broad day in the other parts of the\ncity, it was scarce dawn yet in Alsatia; and none of the sounds of\nindustry or occupation were there heard, which had long before aroused\nthe slumberers in any other quarter. The prospect was too tiresome and\ndisagreeable to detain Lord Glenvarloch at his station, so, turning from\nthe window, he examined with more interest the furniture and appearance\nof the apartment which he tenanted.\n\nMuch of it had been in its time rich and curious--there was a huge\nfour-post bed, with as much carved oak about it as would have made the\nhead of a man-of-war, and tapestry hangings ample enough to have\nbeen her sails. There was a huge mirror with a massy frame of gilt\nbrass-work, which was of Venetian manufacture, and must have been worth\na considerable sum before it received the tremendous crack, which,\ntraversing it from one corner to the other, bore the same proportion to\nthe surface that the Nile bears to the map of Egypt. The chairs were\nof different forms and shapes, some had been carved, some gilded, some\ncovered with damasked leather, some with embroidered work, but all were\ndamaged and worm-eaten. There was a picture of Susanna and the Elders\nover the chimney-piece, which might have been accounted a choice piece,\nhad not the rats made free with the chaste fair one's nose, and with the\nbeard of one of her reverend admirers.\n\nIn a word, all that Lord Glenvarloch saw, seemed to have been articles\ncarried off by appraisement or distress, or bought as pennyworths at\nsome obscure broker's, and huddled together in the apartment, as in a\nsale-room, without regard to taste or congruity.\n\nThe place appeared to Nigel to resemble the houses near the sea-coast,\nwhich are too often furnished with the spoils of wrecked vessels, as\nthis was probably fitted up with the relics of ruined profligates.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy\nown skiff is among the breakers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought Lord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthough my\nwreck will add little to the profits of the spoiler.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was chiefly interested in the state of the grate, a huge assemblage\nof rusted iron bars which stood in the chimney, unequally supported\nby three brazen feet, moulded into the form of lion's claws, while the\nfourth, which had been bent by an accident, seemed proudly uplifted\nas if to paw the ground; or as if the whole article had nourished the\nambitious purpose of pacing forth into the middle of the apartment, and\nhad one foot ready raised for the journey. A smile passed over Nigel's\nface as this fantastic idea presented itself to his fancy.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must\nstop its march, however,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he thought; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor this morning is chill and raw\nenough to demand some fire.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe called accordingly from the top of a large staircase, with a heavy\noaken balustrade, which gave access to his own and other apartments, for\nthe house was old and of considerable size; but, receiving no answer to\nhis repeated summons, he was compelled to go in search of some one who\nmight accommodate him with what he wanted.\n\nNigel had, according to the fashion of the old world in Scotland,\nreceived an education which might, in most particulars, be termed\nsimple, hardy, and unostentatious; but he had, nevertheless, been\naccustomed to much personal deference, and to the constant attendance\nand ministry of one or more domestics. This was the universal custom in\nScotland, where wages were next to nothing, and where, indeed, a man of\ntitle or influence might have as many attendants as he pleased, for\nthe mere expense of food, clothes, and countenance. Nigel was therefore\nmortified and displeased when he found himself without notice or\nattendance; and the more dissatisfied, because he was at the same time\nangry with himself for suffering such a trifle to trouble him at all,\namongst matters of more deep concernment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere must surely be some\nservants in so large a house as this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, as he wandered over the\nplace, through which he was conducted by a passage which branched\noff from the gallery. As he went on, he tried the entrance to several\napartments, some of which he found were locked and others unfurnished,\nall apparently unoccupied; so that at length he returned to the\nstaircase, and resolved to make his way down to the lower part of the\nhouse, where he supposed he must at least find the old gentleman, and\nhis ill-favoured daughter. With this purpose he first made his entrance\ninto a little low, dark parlour, containing a well-worn leathern\neasy-chair, before which stood a pair of slippers, while on the left\nside rested a crutch-handled staff; an oaken table stood before it, and\nsupported a huge desk clamped with iron, and a massive pewter inkstand.\nAround the apartment were shelves, cabinets, and other places convenient\nfor depositing papers. A sword, musketoon, and a pair of pistols, hung\nover the chimney, in ostentatious display, as if to intimate that the\nproprietor would be prompt in the defence of his premises.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis must be the usurer's den,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought Nigel; and he was about to\ncall aloud, when the old man, awakened even by the slightest noise,\nfor avarice seldom sleeps sound, soon was heard from the inner room,\nspeaking in a voice of irritability, rendered more tremulous by his\nmorning cough.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUgh, ugh, ugh--who is there? I say--ugh, ugh--who is there? Why,\nMartha!--ugh! ugh--Martha Trapbois--here be thieves in the house, and\nthey will not speak to me--why, Martha!--thieves, thieves--ugh, ugh,\nugh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNigel endeavoured to explain, but the idea of thieves had taken\npossession of the old man's pineal gland, and he kept coughing and\nscreaming, and screaming and coughing, until the gracious Martha entered\nthe apartment; and, having first outscreamed her father, in order\nto convince him that there was no danger, and to assure him that the\nintruder was their new lodger, and having as often heard her sire\nejaculate--\u00e2\u0080\u009cHold him fast--ugh, ugh--hold him fast till I come,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she at\nlength succeeded in silencing his fears and his clamour, and then\ncoldly and dryly asked Lord Glenvarloch what he wanted in her father's\napartment.\n\nHer lodger had, in the meantime, leisure to contemplate her appearance,\nwhich did not by any means improve the idea he had formed of it by\ncandlelight on the preceding evening. She was dressed in what was called\na Queen Mary's ruff and farthingale; not the falling ruff with which the\nunfortunate Mary of Scotland is usually painted, but that which, with\nmore than Spanish stiffness, surrounded the throat, and set off\nthe morose head, of her fierce namesake, of Smithfield memory. This\nantiquated dress assorted well with the faded complexion, grey eyes,\nthin lips, and austere visage of the antiquated maiden, which was,\nmoreover, enhanced by a black hood, worn as her head-gear, carefully\ndisposed so as to prevent any of her hair from escaping to view,\nprobably because the simplicity of the period knew no art of disguising\nthe colour with which time had begun to grizzle her tresses. Her figure\nwas tall, thin, and flat, with skinny arms and hands, and feet of the\nlarger size, cased in huge high-heeled shoes, which added height to\na stature already ungainly. Apparently some art had been used by\nthe tailor, to conceal a slight defect of shape, occasioned by\nthe accidental elevation of one shoulder above the other; but the\npraiseworthy efforts of the ingenious mechanic, had only succeeded in\ncalling the attention of the observer to his benevolent purpose, without\ndemonstrating that he had been able to achieve it.\n\nSuch was Mrs. Martha Trapbois, whose dry \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat were you seeking here,\nsir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d fell again, and with reiterated sharpness, on the ear of Nigel,\nas he gazed upon her presence, and compared it internally to one of the\nfaded and grim figures in the old tapestry which adorned his bedstead.\nIt was, however, necessary to reply, and he answered, that he came in\nsearch of the servants, as he desired to have a fire kindled in his\napartment on account of the rawness of the morning.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe woman who does our char-work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Mistress Martha, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccomes at\neight o'clock-if you want fire sooner, there are fagots and a bucket of\nsea-coal in the stone-closet at the head of the stair--and there is a\nflint and steel on the upper shelf--you can light fire for yourself if\nyou will.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo--no--no, Martha,\u00e2\u0080\u009d ejaculated her father, who, having donned his\nrustic tunic, with his hose all ungirt, and his feet slip-shod, hastily\ncame out of the inner apartment, with his mind probably full of robbers,\nfor he had a naked rapier in his hand, which still looked formidable,\nthough rust had somewhat marred its shine.--What he had heard at\nentrance about lighting a fire, had changed, however, the current of his\nideas. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo--no--no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, and each negative was more emphatic than\nits predecessor-\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe gentleman shall not have the trouble to put on a\nfire--ugh--ugh. I'll put it on myself, for a con-si-de-ra-ti-on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis last word was a favourite expression with the old gentleman, which\nhe pronounced in a peculiar manner, gasping it out syllable by syllable,\nand laying a strong emphasis upon the last. It was, indeed, a sort\nof protecting clause, by which he guarded himself against all\ninconveniences attendant on the rash habit of offering service or\ncivility of any kind, the which, when hastily snapped at by those to\nwhom they are uttered, give the profferer sometimes room to repent his\npromptitude.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor shame, father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Martha, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat must not be. Master Grahame will\nkindle his own fire, or wait till the char-woman comes to do it for him,\njust as likes him best.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, child--no, child. Child Martha, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d reiterated the old miser--\u00e2\u0080\u009cno\nchar-woman shall ever touch a grate in my house; they put--ugh, ugh--the\nfaggot uppermost, and so the coal kindles not, and the flame goes up\nthe chimney, and wood and heat are both thrown away. Now, I will lay\nit properly for the gentleman, for a consideration, so that it shall\nlast--ugh, ugh--last the whole day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here his vehemence increased his\ncough so violently, that Nigel could only, from a scattered word here\nand there, comprehend that it was a recommendation to his daughter\nto remove the poker and tongs from the stranger's fireside, with an\nassurance, that, when necessary, his landlord would be in attendance to\nadjust it himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor a consideration.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMartha paid as little attention to the old man's injunctions as a\npredominant dame gives to those of a henpecked husband. She only\nrepeated, in a deeper and more emphatic tone of censure,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor shame,\nfather--for shame!\u00e2\u0080\u009d then, turning to her guest, said, with her usual\nungraciousness of manner--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster Grahame--it is best to be plain with\nyou at first. My father is an old, a very old man, and his wits, as you\nmay see, are somewhat weakened--though I would not advise you to make\na bargain with him, else you may find them too sharp for your own. For\nmyself, I am a lone woman, and, to say truth, care little to see or\nconverse with any one. If you can be satisfied with house-room, shelter,\nand safety, it will be your own fault if you have them not, and they\nare not always to be found in this unhappy quarter. But, if you seek\ndeferential observance and attendance, I tell you at once you will not\nfind them here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not wont either to thrust myself upon acquaintance, madam, or\nto give trouble,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the guest; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnevertheless, I shall need the\nassistance of a domestic to assist me to dress--Perhaps you can\nrecommend me to such?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, to twenty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Mistress Martha, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho will pick your purse\nwhile they tie your points, and cut your throat while they smooth your\npillow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will be his servant, myself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old man, whose intellect,\nfor a moment distanced, had again, in some measure, got up with\nthe conversation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will brush his cloak--ugh, ugh--and tie his\npoints--ugh, ugh--and clean his shoes--ugh--and run on his errands with\nspeed and safety--ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh--for a consideration.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-morrow to you, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Martha, to Nigel, in a tone of direct\nand positive dismissal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt cannot be agreeable to a daughter that\na stranger should hear her father speak thus. If you be really a\ngentleman, you will retire to your own apartment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not delay a moment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, respectfully, for he was\nsensible that circumstances palliated the woman's rudeness. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would but\nask you, if seriously there can be danger in procuring the assistance of\na serving-man in this place?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYoung gentleman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Martha, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou must know little of Whitefriars to\nask the question. We live alone in this house, and seldom has a stranger\nentered it; nor should you, to be plain, had my will been consulted.\nLook at the door--see if that of a castle can be better secured; the\nwindows of the first floor are grated on the outside, and within, look\nto these shutters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe pulled one of them aside, and showed a ponderous apparatus of bolts\nand chains for securing the window-shutters, while her father, pressing\nto her side, seized her gown with a trembling hand, and said, in a low\nwhisper, \u00e2\u0080\u009cShow not the trick of locking and undoing them. Show him not\nthe trick on't, Martha--ugh, ugh--on _no_ consideration.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Martha went\non, without paying him any attention.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd yet, young gentleman, we have been more than once like to find all\nthese defences too weak to protect our lives; such an evil effect on the\nwicked generation around us hath been made by the unhappy report of my\npoor father's wealth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSay nothing of that, housewife,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the miser, his irritability\nincreased by the very supposition of his being wealthy--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSay nothing\nof that, or I will beat thee, housewife--beat thee with my staff, for\nfetching and carrying lies that will procure our throats to be cut\nat last--ugh, ugh.--I am but a poor man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, turning to\nNigel--\u00e2\u0080\u009ca very poor man, that am willing to do any honest turn upon\nearth, for a modest consideration.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI therefore warn you of the life you must lead, young gentleman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nMartha; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe poor woman who does the char-work will assist you so far as\nin her power, but the wise man is his own best servant and assistant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a lesson you have taught me, madam, and I thank you for it--I\nwill assuredly study it at leisure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will do well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Martha; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand as you seem thankful for advice,\nI, though I am no professed counsellor of others, will give you more.\nMake no intimacy with any one in Whitefriars--borrow no money, on any\nscore, especially from my father, for, dotard as he seems, he will make\nan ass of you. Last, and best of all, stay here not an instant longer\nthan you can help it. Farewell, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA gnarled tree may bear good fruit, and a harsh nature may give good\ncounsel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought the Lord of Glenvarloch, as he retreated to his own\napartment, where the same reflection occurred to him again and again,\nwhile, unable as yet to reconcile himself to the thoughts of becoming\nhis own fire-maker, he walked up and down his bedroom, to warm himself\nby exercise.\n\nAt length his meditations arranged themselves in the following\nsoliloquy--by which expression I beg leave to observe once for all, that\nI do not mean that Nigel literally said aloud with his bodily organs,\nthe words which follow in inverted commas, (while pacing the room by\nhimself,) but that I myself choose to present to my dearest reader the\npicture of my hero's mind, his reflections and resolutions, in the form\nof a speech, rather than in that of a narrative. In other words, I have\nput his thoughts into language; and this I conceive to be the purpose of\nthe soliloquy upon the stage as well as in the closet, being at once the\nmost natural, and perhaps the only way of communicating to the spectator\nwhat is supposed to be passing in the bosom of the scenic personage.\nThere are no such soliloquies in nature, it is true, but unless they\nwere received as a conventional medium of communication betwixt the poet\nand the audience, we should reduce dramatic authors to the recipe of\nMaster Puff, who makes Lord Burleigh intimate a long train of political\nreasoning to the audience, by one comprehensive shake of his noddle. In\nnarrative, no doubt, the writer has the alternative of telling that his\npersonages thought so and so, inferred thus and thus, and arrived at\nsuch and such a conclusion; but the soliloquy is a more concise and\nspirited mode of communicating the same information; and therefore thus\ncommuned, or thus might have communed, the Lord of Glenvarloch with his\nown mind.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is right, and has taught me a lesson I will profit by. I have been,\nthrough my whole life, one who leant upon others for that assistance,\nwhich it is more truly noble to derive from my own exertions. I am\nashamed of feeling the paltry inconvenience which long habit had led me\nto annex to the want of a servant's assistance--I am ashamed of that;\nbut far, far more am I ashamed to have suffered the same habit of\nthrowing my own burden on others, to render me, since I came to this\ncity, a mere victim of those events, which I have never even\nattempted to influence--a thing never acting, but perpetually acted\nupon--protected by one friend, deceived by another; but in the advantage\nwhich I received from the one, and the evil I have sustained from the\nother, as passive and helpless as a boat that drifts without oar or\nrudder at the mercy of the winds and waves. I became a courtier, because\nHeriot so advised it--a gamester, because Dalgarno so contrived it--an\nAlsatian, because Lowestoffe so willed it. Whatever of good or bad has\nbefallen me, has arisen out of the agency of others, not from my own. My\nfather's son must no longer hold this facile and puerile course. Live\nor die, sink or swim, Nigel Olifaunt, from this moment, shall owe his\nsafety, success, and honour, to his own exertions, or shall fall with\nthe credit of having at least exerted his own free agency. I will write\nit down in my tablets, in her very words,--'The wise man is his own best\nassistant.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe had just put his tablets in his pocket when the old charwoman, who,\nto add to her efficiency, was sadly crippled by rheumatism, hobbled into\nthe room, to try if she could gain a small gratification by waiting on\nthe stranger. She readily undertook to get Lord Glenvarloch's breakfast,\nand as there was an eating-house at the next door, she succeeded in a\nshorter time than Nigel had augured.\n\nAs his solitary meal was finished, one of the Temple porters, or\ninferior officers, was announced, as seeking Master Grahame, on the part\nof his friend, Master Lowestoffe; and, being admitted by the old woman\nto his apartment, he delivered to Nigel a small mail-trunk, with the\nclothes he had desired should be sent to him, and then, with more\nmystery, put into his hand a casket, or strong-boy, which he carefully\nconcealed beneath his cloak. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am glad to be rid on't,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nfellow, as he placed it on the table.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, it is surely not so very heavy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand you are a\nstout young man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the fellow; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut Samson himself would not have\ncarried such a matter safely through Alsatia, had the lads of the Huff\nknown what it was. Please to look into it, sir, and see all is right--I\nam an honest fellow, and it comes safe out of my hands. How long it may\nremain so afterwards, will depend on your own care. I would not my good\nname were to suffer by any after-clap.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTo satisfy the scruples of the messenger, Lord Glenvarloch opened the\ncasket in his presence, and saw that his small stock of money, with\ntwo or three valuable papers which it contained, and particularly the\noriginal sign-manual which the king had granted in his favour, were in\nthe same order in which he had left them. At the man's further instance,\nhe availed himself of the writing materials which were in the casket, in\norder to send a line to Master Lowestoffe, declaring that his property\nhad reached him in safety. He added some grateful acknowledgments for\nLowestoffe's services, and, just as he was sealing and delivering his\nbillet to the messenger, his aged landlord entered the apartment. His\nthreadbare suit of black clothes was now somewhat better arranged than\nthey had been in the dishabille of his first appearance, and his nerves\nand intellects seemed to be less fluttered; for, without much coughing\nor hesitation, he invited Nigel to partake of a morning draught of\nwholesome single ale, which he brought in a large leathern tankard, or\nblack-jack, carried in the one hand, while the other stirred it round\nwith a sprig of rosemary, to give it, as the old man said, a flavour.\n\nNigel declined the courteous proffer, and intimated by his manner,\nwhile he did so, that he desired no intrusion on the privacy of his\nown apartment; which, indeed, he was the more entitled to maintain,\nconsidering the cold reception he had that morning met with when\nstraying from its precincts into those of his landlord. But the open\ncasket contained matter, or rather metal, so attractive to old Trapbois,\nthat he remained fixed, like a setting-dog at a dead point, his nose\nadvanced, and one hand expanded like the lifted forepaw, by which that\nsagacious quadruped sometimes indicates that it is a hare which he has\nin the wind. Nigel was about to break the charm which had thus arrested\nold Trapbois, by shutting the lid of the casket, when his attention was\nwithdrawn from him by the question of the messenger, who, holding\nout the letter, asked whether he was to leave it at Mr. Lowestoffe's\nchambers in the Temple, or carry it to the Marshalsea?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Marshalsea?\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated Lord Glenvarloch; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat of the Marshalsea?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the man, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe poor gentleman is laid up there in\nlavender, because, they say, his own kind heart led him to scald his\nfingers with another man's broth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNigel hastily snatched back the letter, broke the seal, joined to the\ncontents his earnest entreaty that he might be instantly acquainted with\nthe cause of his confinement, and added, that, if it arose out of his\nown unhappy affair, it would be of a brief duration, since he had, even\nbefore hearing of a reason which so peremptorily demanded that he should\nsurrender himself, adopted the resolution to do so, as the manliest and\nmost proper course which his ill fortune and imprudence had left in his\nown power. He therefore conjured Mr. Lowestoffe to have no delicacy upon\nthis score, but, since his surrender was what he had determined upon as\na sacrifice due to his own character, that he would have the frankness\nto mention in what manner it could be best arranged, so as to extricate\nhim, Lowestoffe, from the restraint to which the writer could not but\nfear his friend had been subjected, on account of the generous interest\nwhich he had taken in his concerns. The letter concluded, that the\nwriter would suffer twenty-four hours to elapse in expectation of\nhearing from him, and, at the end of that period, was determined to put\nhis purpose in execution. He delivered the billet to the messenger,\nand, enforcing his request with a piece of money, urged him, without a\nmoment's delay, to convey it to the hands of Master Lowestoffe.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI--I--I--will carry it to him myself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old usurer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor half\nthe consideration.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe man who heard this attempt to take his duty and perquisites over his\nhead, lost no time in pocketing the money, and departed on his errand as\nfast as he could.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster Trapbois,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, addressing the old man somewhat\nimpatiently, \u00e2\u0080\u009chad you any particular commands for me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI--I--came to see if you rested well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the old man; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand--if I\ncould do anything to serve you, on any consideration.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir, I thank you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thank you;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and, ere he\ncould say more, a heavy footstep was heard on the stair.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy God!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the old man, starting up--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy,\nDorothy--char-woman--why, daughter,--draw bolt, I say, housewives--the\ndoor hath been left a-latch!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe door of the chamber opened wide, and in strutted the portly bulk\nof the military hero whom Nigel had on the preceding evening in vain\nendeavoured to recognise.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nSWASH-BUCKLER. Bilboe's the word--PIERROT. It hath been spoke too often,\nThe spell hath lost its charm--I tell thee, friend, The meanest cur that\ntrots the street, will turn, And snarl against your proffer'd bastinado.\nSWASH-BUCKLER. 'Tis art shall do it, then--I will dose the mongrels--Or,\nin plain terms, I'll use the private knife 'Stead of the brandish'd\nfalchion. _Old Play_.\n\nThe noble Captain Colepepper or Peppercull, for he was known by both\nthese names, and some others besides; had a martial and a swashing\nexterior, which, on the present occasion, was rendered yet more\npeculiar, by a patch covering his left eye and a part of the cheek.\nThe sleeves of his thickset velvet jerkin were polished and shone with\ngrease,--his buff gloves had huge tops, which reached almost to the\nelbow; his sword-belt of the same materials extended its breadth from\nhis haunchbone to his small ribs, and supported on the one side his\nlarge black-hilted back-sword, on the other a dagger of like proportions\nHe paid his compliments to Nigel with that air of predetermined\neffrontery, which announces that it will not be repelled by any coldness\nof reception, asked Trapbois how he did, by the familiar title of old\nPeter Pillory, and then, seizing upon the black-jack, emptied it off at\na draught, to the health of the last and youngest freeman of Alsatia,\nthe noble and loving master Nigel Grahame.\n\nWhen he had set down the empty pitcher and drawn his breath, he began to\ncriticise the liquor which it had lately contained.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSufficient single\nbeer, old Pillory--and, as I take it, brewed at the rate of a nutshell\nof malt to a butt of Thames--as dead as a corpse, too, and yet it\nwent hissing down my throat--bubbling, by Jove, like water upon hot\niron.--You left us early, noble Master Grahame, but, good faith, we had\na carouse to your honour--we heard _butt_ ring hollow ere we parted;\nwe were as loving as inkle-weavers--we fought, too, to finish off the\ngawdy. I bear some marks of the parson about me, you see--a note of the\nsermon or so, which should have been addressed to my ear, but missed its\nmark, and reached my left eye. The man of God bears my sign-manual too,\nbut the Duke made us friends again, and it cost me more sack than I\ncould carry, and all the Rhenish to boot, to pledge the seer in the way\nof love and reconciliation--But, Caracco! 'tis a vile old canting slave\nfor all that, whom I will one day beat out of his devil's livery into\nall the colours of the rainbow.--Basta!--Said I well, old Trapbois?\nWhere is thy daughter, man?--what says she to my suit?--'tis an honest\none--wilt have a soldier for thy son-in-law, old Pillory, to mingle the\nsoul of martial honour with thy thieving, miching, petty-larceny blood,\nas men put bold brandy into muddy ale?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy daughter receives not company so early, noble captain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nusurer, and concluded his speech with a dry, emphatical \u00e2\u0080\u009cugh, ugh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat, upon no con-si-de-ra-ti-on?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the captain; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand wherefore not,\nold Truepenny? she has not much time to lose in driving her bargain,\nmethinks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCaptain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Trapbois, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was upon some little business with our\nnoble friend here, Master Nigel Green--ugh, ugh, ugh--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you would have me gone, I warrant you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the bully; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut\npatience, old Pillory, thine hour is not yet come, man--You see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid, pointing to the casket, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat noble Master Grahame, whom you call\nGreen, has got the _decuses_ and the _smelt_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhich you would willingly rid him of, ha! ha!--ugh, ugh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the\nusurer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you knew how--but, lack-a-day! thou art one of those that\ncome out for wool, and art sure to go home shorn. Why now, but that I\nam sworn against laying of wagers, I would risk some consideration that\nthis honest guest of mine sends thee home penniless, if thou darest\nventure with him--ugh, ugh--at any game which gentlemen play at.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMarry, thou hast me on the hip there, thou old miserly cony-catcher!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered the captain, taking a bale of dice from the sleeve of his coat;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must always keep company with these damnable doctors, and they have\nmade me every baby's cully, and purged my purse into an atrophy; but\nnever mind, it passes the time as well as aught else--How say you,\nMaster Grahame?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe fellow paused; but even the extremity of his impudence could\nscarcely hardly withstand the cold look of utter contempt with which\nNigel received his proposal, returning it with a simple, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI only play\nwhere I know my company, and never in the morning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCards may be more agreeable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Captain Colepepper; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand, for\nknowing your company, here is honest old Pillory will tell you Jack\nColepepper plays as truly on the square as e'er a man that trowled\na die--Men talk of high and low dice, Fulhams and bristles, topping,\nknapping, slurring, stabbing, and a hundred ways of rooking besides;\nbut broil me like a rasher of bacon, if I could ever learn the trick on\n'em!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have got the vocabulary perfect, sir, at the least,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, in\nthe same cold tone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, by mine honour have I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned the Hector; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey are phrases\nthat a gentleman learns about town.--But perhaps you would like a set at\ntennis, or a game at balloon--we have an indifferent good court hard\nby here, and a set of as gentleman-like blades as ever banged leather\nagainst brick and mortar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI beg to be excused at present,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand to be\nplain, among the valuable privileges your society has conferred on me, I\nhope I may reckon that of being private in my own apartment when I have\na mind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour humble servant, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the captain; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I thank you for\nyour civility--Jack Colepepper can have enough of company, and thrusts\nhimself on no one.--But perhaps you will like to make a match at\nskittles?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am by no means that way disposed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the young nobleman,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOr to leap a flea--run a snail--match a wherry, eh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo--I will do none of these,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Nigel.\n\nHere the old man, who had been watching with his little peery eyes,\npulled the bulky Hector by the skirt, and whispered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not vapour him\nthe huff, it will not pass--let the trout play, he will rise to the hook\npresently.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut the bully, confiding in his own strength, and probably mistaking\nfor timidity the patient scorn with which Nigel received his proposals,\nincited also by the open casket, began to assume a louder and more\nthreatening tone. He drew himself up, bent his brows, assumed a look of\nprofessional ferocity, and continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Alsatia, look ye, a man must\nbe neighbourly and companionable. Zouns! sir, we would slit any nose\nthat was turned up at us honest fellows.--Ay, sir, we would slit it\nup to the gristle, though it had smelt nothing all its life but musk,\nambergris, and court-scented water.--Rabbit me, I am a soldier, and care\nno more for a lord than a lamplighter!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you seeking a quarrel, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, calmly, having in truth no\ndesire to engage himself in a discreditable broil in such a place, and\nwith such a character.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cQuarrel, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the captain; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not seeking a quarrel, though I\ncare not how soon I find one. Only I wish you to understand you must\nbe neighbourly, that's all. What if we should go over the water to the\ngarden, and see a bull hanked this fine morning--'sdeath, will you do\nnothing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSomething I am strangely tempted to do at this moment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVidelicet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Colepepper, with a swaggering air, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet us hear the\ntemptation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am tempted to throw you headlong from the window, unless you\npresently make the best of your way down stairs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThrow me from the window?--hell and furies!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the captain; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nhave confronted twenty crooked sabres at Buda with my single rapier, and\nshall a chitty-faced, beggarly Scots lordling, speak of me and a window\nin the same breath?--Stand off, old Pillory, let me make Scotch collops\nof him--he dies the death!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the love of Heaven, gentlemen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the old miser, throwing\nhimself between them, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo not break the peace on any consideration!\nNoble guest, forbear the captain--he is a very Hector of\nTroy--Trusty Hector, forbear my guest, he is like to prove a very\nAchilles-ugh-ugh----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere he was interrupted by his asthma, but, nevertheless, continued\nto interpose his person between Colepepper (who had unsheathed his\nwhinyard, and was making vain passes at his antagonist) and Nigel, who\nhad stepped back to take his sword, and now held it undrawn in his left\nhand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMake an end of this foolery, you scoundrel!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel--\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you come\nhither to vent your noisy oaths and your bottled-up valour on me? You\nseem to know me, and I am half ashamed to say I have at length been\nable to recollect you--remember the garden behind the ordinary,--you\ndastardly ruffian, and the speed with which fifty men saw you run from a\ndrawn sword.--Get you gone, sir, and do not put me to the vile labour of\ncudgelling such a cowardly rascal down stairs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe bully's countenance grew dark as night at this unexpected\nrecognition; for he had undoubtedly thought himself secure in his change\nof dress, and his black patch, from being discovered by a person who had\nseen him but once. He set his teeth, clenched his hands, and it seemed\nas if he was seeking for a moment's courage to fly upon his antagonist.\nBut his heart failed, he sheathed his sword, turned his back in gloomy\nsilence, and spoke not until he reached the door, when, turning\nround, he said, with a deep oath, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I be not avenged of you for this\ninsolence ere many days go by, I would the gallows had my body and the\ndevil my spirit!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, and with a look where determined spite and malice made his\nfeatures savagely fierce, though they could not overcome his fear, he\nturned and left the house. Nigel followed him as far as the gallery at\nthe head of the staircase, with the purpose of seeing him depart, and\nere he returned was met by Mistress Martha Trapbois, whom the noise of\nthe quarrel had summoned from her own apartment. He could not resist\nsaying to her in his natural displeasure--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would, madam, you could\nteach your father and his friends the lesson which you had the goodness\nto bestow on me this morning, and prevail on them to leave me the\nunmolested privacy of my own apartment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you came hither for quiet or retirement, young man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered she,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have been advised to an evil retreat. You might seek mercy in the\nStar-Chamber, or holiness in hell, with better success than quiet in\nAlsatia. But my father shall trouble you no longer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, she entered the apartment, and, fixing her eyes on the\ncasket, she said with emphasis--\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you display such a loadstone, it\nwill draw many a steel knife to your throat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile Nigel hastily shut the casket, she addressed her father,\nupbraiding him, with small reverence, for keeping company with the\ncowardly, hectoring, murdering villain, John Colepepper.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old man, with the cunning leer which\nintimated perfect satisfaction with his own superior address--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know--I\nknow--ugh--but I'll crossbite him--I know them all, and I can manage\nthem--ay, ay--I have the trick on't--ugh-ugh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_You_ manage, father!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the austere damsel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou will manage to\nhave your throat cut, and that ere long. You cannot hide from them your\ngains and your gold as formerly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy gains, wench? my gold?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the usurer; \u00e2\u0080\u009calack-a-day, few of these\nand hard got--few and hard got.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis will not serve you, father, any longer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand had not\nserved you thus long, but that Bully Colepepper had contrived a cheaper\nway of plundering your house, even by means of my miserable self.--But\nwhy do I speak to him of all this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, checking herself, and\nshrugging her shoulders with an expression of pity which did not fall\nmuch short of scorn. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe hears me not--he thinks not of me.--Is it\nnot strange that the love of gathering gold should survive the care to\npreserve both property and life?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, who could not help respecting the\nstrong sense and feeling shown by this poor woman, even amidst all\nher rudeness and severity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour father seems to have his faculties\nsufficiently alert when he is in the exercise of his ordinary pursuits\nand functions. I wonder he is not sensible of the weight of your\narguments.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNature made him a man senseless of danger, and that insensibility is\nthe best thing I have derived from him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she; \u00e2\u0080\u009cage has left him\nshrewdness enough to tread his old beaten paths, but not to seek new\ncourses. The old blind horse will long continue to go its rounds in the\nmill, when it would stumble in the open meadow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDaughter!--why, wench--why, housewife!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old man, awakening\nout of some dream, in which he had been sneering and chuckling in\nimagination, probably over a successful piece of roguery,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cgo to\nchamber, wench--go to chamber--draw bolts and chain--look sharp to\ndoor--let none in or out but worshipful Master Grahame--I must take my\ncloak, and go to Duke Hildebrod--ay, ay, time has been, my own warrant\nwas enough; but the lower we lie, the more are we under the wind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd, with his wonted chorus of muttering and coughing, the old man left\nthe apartment. His daughter stood for a moment looking after him, with\nher usual expression of discontent and sorrow.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou ought to persuade your father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto leave this evil\nneighbourhood, if you are in reality apprehensive for his safety.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe would be safe in no other quarter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the daughter; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would\nrather the old man were dead than publicly dishonoured. In other\nquarters he would be pelted and pursued, like an owl which ventures into\nsunshine. Here he was safe, while his comrades could avail themselves of\nhis talents; he is now squeezed and fleeced by them on every pretence.\nThey consider him as a vessel on the strand, from which each may snatch\na prey; and the very jealousy which they entertain respecting him as a\ncommon property, may perhaps induce them to guard him from more private\nand daring assaults.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStill, methinks, you ought to leave this place,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009csince\nyou might find a safe retreat in some distant country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Scotland, doubtless,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, looking at him with a sharp and\nsuspicious eye, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand enrich strangers with our rescued wealth--Ha! young\nman?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam, if you knew me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou would spare the\nsuspicion implied in your words.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho shall assure me of that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Martha, sharply. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey say you are\na brawler and a gamester, and I know how far these are to be trusted by\nthe unhappy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey do me wrong, by Heaven!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt may be so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Martha; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am little interested in the degree of\nyour vice or your folly; but it is plain, that the one or the other\nhas conducted you hither, and that your best hope of peace, safety, and\nhappiness, is to be gone, with the least possible delay, from a place\nwhich is always a sty for swine, and often a shambles.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, she\nleft the apartment.\n\nThere was something in the ungracious manner of this female, amounting\nalmost to contempt of him she spoke to--an indignity to which\nGlenvarloch, notwithstanding his poverty, had not as yet been personally\nexposed, and which, therefore, gave him a transitory feeling of painful\nsurprise. Neither did the dark hints which Martha threw out concerning\nthe danger of his place of refuge, sound by any means agreeably to his\nears. The bravest man, placed in a situation in which he is surrounded\nby suspicious persons, and removed from all counsel and assistance,\nexcept those afforded by a valiant heart and a strong arm, experiences\na sinking of the spirit, a consciousness of abandonment, which for\na moment chills his blood, and depresses his natural gallantry of\ndisposition.\n\nBut, if sad reflections arose in Nigel's mind, he had not time to\nindulge them; and, if he saw little prospect of finding friends in\nAlsatia, he found that he was not likely to be solitary for lack of\nvisitors.\n\nHe had scarcely paced his apartment for ten minutes, endeavouring to\narrange his ideas on the course which he was to pursue on quitting\nAlsatia, when he was interrupted by the Sovereign of the quarter, the\ngreat Duke Hildebrod himself, before whose approach the bolts and chains\nof the miser's dwelling fell, or withdrew, as of their own accord; and\nboth the folding leaves of the door were opened, that he might roll\nhimself into the house like a huge butt of liquor, a vessel to which\nhe bore a considerable outward resemblance, both in size, shape,\ncomplexion, and contents.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-morrow to your lordship,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the greasy puncheon, cocking his\nsingle eye, and rolling it upon Nigel with a singular expression of\nfamiliar impudence; whilst his grim bull-dog, which was close at his\nheels, made a kind of gurgling in his throat, as if saluting, in similar\nfashion, a starved cat, the only living thing in Trapbois' house which\nwe have not yet enumerated, and which had flown up to the top of the\ntester, where she stood clutching and grinning at the mastiff, whose\ngreeting she accepted with as much good-will as Nigel bestowed on that\nof the dog's master.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPeace, Belzie!--D--n thee, peace!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Duke Hildebrod. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBeasts and\nfools will be meddling, my lord.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Nigel, with as much haughtiness as was\nconsistent with the cool distance which he desired to preserve, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nthought I had told you, my name at present was Nigel Grahame.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis eminence of Whitefriars on this burst out into a loud, chuckling,\nimpudent laugh, repeating the word, till his voice was almost\ninarticulate,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNiggle Green--Niggle Green--Niggle Green!--why, my lord,\nyou would be queered in the drinking of a penny pot of Malmsey, if you\ncry before you are touched. Why, you have told me the secret even now,\nhad I not had a shrewd guess of it before. Why, Master Nigel, since that\nis the word, I only called you my lord, because we made you a peer\nof Alsatia last night, when the sack was predominant.--How you look\nnow!--Ha! ha! ha!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNigel, indeed, conscious that he had unnecessarily betrayed himself,\nreplied hastily,--\u00e2\u0080\u009che was much obliged to him for the honours conferred,\nbut did not propose to remain in the Sanctuary long enough to enjoy\nthem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, that may be as you will, an you will walk by wise counsel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered the ducal porpoise; and, although Nigel remained standing, in\nhopes to accelerate his guest's departure, he threw himself into one of\nthe old tapestry-backed easy-chairs, which cracked under his weight, and\nbegan to call for old Trapbois.\n\nThe crone of all work appearing instead of her master, the Duke cursed\nher for a careless jade, to let a strange gentleman, and a brave guest,\ngo without his morning's draught.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never take one, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Glenvarloch.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTime to begin--time to begin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Duke.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere, you old\nrefuse of Sathan, go to our palace, and fetch Lord Green's morning\ndraught. Let us see--what shall it be, my lord?--a humming double pot of\nale, with a roasted crab dancing in it like a wherry above bridge?--or,\nhum--ay, young men are sweet-toothed--a quart of burnt sack, with sugar\nand spice?--good against the fogs. Or, what say you to sipping a gill of\nright distilled waters? Come, we will have them all, and you shall take\nyour choice.--Here, you Jezebel, let Tim send the ale, and the sack, and\nthe nipperkin of double-distilled, with a bit of diet-loaf, or some such\ntrinket, and score it to the new comer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGlenvarloch, bethinking himself that it might be as well to endure\nthis fellow's insolence for a brief season, as to get into farther\ndiscreditable quarrels, suffered him to take his own way, without\ninterruption, only observing, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou make yourself at home, sir, in my\napartment; but, for the time, you may use your pleasure. Meanwhile,\nI would fain know what has procured me the honour of this unexpected\nvisit?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall know that when old Deb has brought the liquor--I never speak\nof business dry-lipped. Why, how she drumbles--I warrant she stops to\ntake a sip on the road, and then you will think you have had unchristian\nmeasure.--In the meanwhile, look at that dog there--look Belzebub in\nthe face, and tell me if you ever saw a sweeter beast--never flew but at\nhead in his life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd, after this congenial panegyric, he was proceeding with a tale of a\ndog and a bull, which threatened to be somewhat of the longest, when\nhe was interrupted by the return of the old crone, and two of his own\ntapsters, bearing the various kinds of drinkables which he had demanded,\nand which probably was the only species of interruption he would have\nendured with equanimity.\n\nWhen the cups and cans were duly arranged upon the table, and when\nDeborah, whom the ducal generosity honoured with a penny farthing in\nthe way of gratuity, had withdrawn with her satellites, the worthy\npotentate, having first slightly invited Lord Glenvarloch to partake\nof the liquor which he was to pay for, and after having observed, that,\nexcepting three poached eggs, a pint of bastard, and a cup of clary, he\nwas fasting from every thing but sin, set himself seriously to reinforce\nthe radical moisture. Glenvarloch had seen Scottish lairds and Dutch\nburgomasters at their potations; but their exploits (though each might\nbe termed a thirsty generation) were nothing to those of Duke Hildebrod,\nwho seemed an absolute sandbed, capable of absorbing any given quantity\nof liquid, without being either vivified or overflowed. He drank off\nthe ale to quench a thirst which, as he said, kept him in a fever from\nmorning to night, and night to morning; tippled off the sack to correct\nthe crudity of the ale; sent the spirits after the sack to keep all\nquiet, and then declared that, probably, he should not taste liquor till\n_post meridiem_, unless it was in compliment to some especial friend.\nFinally, he intimated that he was ready to proceed on the business\nwhich brought him from home so early, a proposition which Nigel readily\nreceived, though he could not help suspecting that the most important\npurpose of Duke Hildebrod's visit was already transacted.\n\nIn this, however, Lord Glenvarloch proved to be mistaken. Hildebrod,\nbefore opening what he had to say, made an accurate survey of the\napartment, laying, from time to time, his finger on his nose, and\nwinking on Nigel with his single eye, while he opened and shut the\ndoors, lifted the tapestry, which concealed, in one or two places, the\ndilapidation of time upon the wainscoted walls, peeped into closets,\nand, finally, looked under the bed, to assure himself that the coast\nwas clear of listeners and interlopers. He then resumed his seat, and\nbeckoned confidentially to Nigel to draw his chair close to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am well as I am, Master Hildebrod,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the young lord, little\ndisposed to encourage the familiarity which the man endeavoured to fix\non him; but the undismayed Duke proceeded as follows:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall pardon me, my lord--and I now give you the title right\nseriously--if I remind you that our waters may be watched; for though\nold Trapbois be as deaf as Saint Paul's, yet his daughter has sharp\nears, and sharp eyes enough, and it is of them that it is my business to\nspeak.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSay away, then, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, edging his chair somewhat closer to\nthe Quicksand, \u00e2\u0080\u009calthough I cannot conceive what business I have either\nwith mine host or his daughter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will see that in the twinkling of a quart-pot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the\ngracious Duke; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand first, my lord, you must not think to dance in a net\nbefore old Jack Hildebrod, that has thrice your years o'er his head, and\nwas born, like King Richard, with all his eye-teeth ready cut.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, sir, go on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, then, my lord, I presume to say, that, if you are, as I believe\nyou are, that Lord Glenvarloch whom all the world talk of--the Scotch\ngallant that has spent all, to a thin cloak and a light purse--be not\nmoved, my lord, it is so noised of you--men call you the sparrow-hawk,\nwho will fly at all--ay, were it in the very Park--Be not moved, my\nlord.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am ashamed, sirrah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you should have power\nto move me by your insolence--but beware--and, if you indeed guess who\nI am, consider how long I may be able to endure your tone of insolent\nfamiliarity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI crave pardon, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hildebrod, with a sullen, yet apologetic\nlook; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI meant no harm in speaking my poor mind. I know not what honour\nthere may be in being familiar with your lordship, but I judge there\nis little safety, for Lowestoffe is laid up in lavender only for having\nshown you the way into Alsatia; and so, what is to come of those who\nmaintain you when you are here, or whether they will get most honour or\nmost trouble by doing so, I leave with your lordship's better judgment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will bring no one into trouble on my account,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will leave Whitefriars to-morrow. Nay, by Heaven, I will leave it\nthis day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will have more wit in your anger, I trust,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Duke Hildebrod;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009clisten first to what I have to say to you, and, if honest Jack\nHildebrod puts you not in the way of nicking them all, may he never cast\ndoublets, or dull a greenhorn again! And so, my lord, in plain words,\nyou must wap and win.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour words must be still plainer before I can understand them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nNigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat the devil--a gamester, one who deals with the devil's bones and\nthe doctors, and not understand Pedlar's French! Nay, then, I must speak\nplain English, and that's the simpleton's tongue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeak, then, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I pray you be brief, for I have\nlittle more time to bestow on you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then, my lord, to be brief, as you and the lawyers call it--I\nunderstand you have an estate in the north, which changes masters for\nwant of the redeeming ready.--Ay, you start, but you cannot dance in\na net before me, as I said before; and so the king runs the frowning\nhumour on you, and the Court vapours you the go-by; and the Prince\nscowls at you from under his cap; and the favourite serves you out the\npuckered brow and the cold shoulder; and the favourite's favourite--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo go no further, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d interrupted Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009csuppose all this true--and\nwhat follows?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat follows?\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned Duke Hildebrod. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMarry, this follows, that you\nwill owe good deed, as well as good will, to him who shall put you in\nthe way to walk with your beaver cocked in the presence, as an ye were\nEarl of Kildare; bully the courtiers; meet the Prince's blighting look\nwith a bold brow; confront the favourite; baffle his deputy, and--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is all well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel! \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut how is it to be accomplished?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy making thee a Prince of Peru, my lord of the northern latitudes;\npropping thine old castle with ingots,--fertilizing thy failing fortunes\nwith gold dust--it shall but cost thee to put thy baron's coronet for a\nday or so on the brows of an old Caduca here, the man's daughter of the\nhouse, and thou art master of a mass of treasure that shall do all I\nhave said for thee, and--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat, you would have me marry this old gentlewoman here, the daughter\nof mine host?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, surprised and angry, yet unable to suppress\nsome desire to laugh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, my lord, I would have you marry fifty thousand good sterling\npounds; for that, and better, hath old Trapbois hoarded; and thou shall\ndo a deed of mercy in it to the old man, who will lose his golden smelts\nin some worse way--for now that he is well-nigh past his day of work,\nhis day of payment is like to follow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTruly, this is a most courteous offer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut may\nI pray of your candour, most noble duke, to tell me why you dispose of\na ward of so much wealth on a stranger like me, who may leave you\nto-morrow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn sooth, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Duke, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat question smacks more of the\nwit of Beaujeu's ordinary, than any word I have yet heard your lordship\nspeak, and reason it is you should be answered. Touching my peers, it is\nbut necessary to say, that Mistress Martha Trapbois will none of them,\nwhether clerical or laic. The captain hath asked her, so hath the\nparson, but she will none of them--she looks higher than either, and\nis, to say truth, a woman of sense, and so forth, too profound, and of\nspirit something too high, to put up with greasy buff or rusty prunella.\nFor ourselves, we need but hint that we have a consort in the land of\nthe living, and, what is more to purpose, Mrs. Martha knows it. So, as\nshe will not lace her kersey hood save with a quality binding, you, my\nlord, must be the man, and must carry off fifty thousand decuses, the\nspoils of five thousand bullies, cutters, and spendthrifts,--always\ndeducting from the main sum some five thousand pounds for our princely\nadvice and countenance, without which, as matters stand in Alsatia, you\nwould find it hard to win the plate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut has your wisdom considered, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow this\nwedlock can serve me in my present emergence?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs for that, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Duke Hildebrod, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif, with forty or fifty\nthousand pounds in your pouch, you cannot save yourself, you will\ndeserve to lose your head for your folly, and your hand for being\nclose-fisted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, since your goodness has taken my matters into such serious\nconsideration,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Nigel, who conceived there was no prudence\nin breaking with a man, who, in his way, meant him favour rather than\noffence, \u00e2\u0080\u009cperhaps you may be able to tell me how my kindred will be\nlikely to receive such a bride as you recommend to me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTouching that matter, my lord, I have always heard your countrymen knew\nas well as other folks, on which side their bread was buttered. And,\ntruly, speaking from report, I know no place where fifty thousand\npounds--fifty thousand pounds, I say--will make a woman more welcome\nthan it is likely to do in your ancient kingdom. And, truly, saving the\nslight twist in her shoulder, Mrs. Martha Trapbois is a person of very\nawful and majestic appearance, and may, for aught I know, be come of\nbetter blood than any one wots of; for old Trapbois looks not over\nlike to be her father, and her mother was a generous, liberal sort of a\nwoman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am afraid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat chance is rather too vague to\nassure her a gracious reception into an honourable house.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, then, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Hildebrod, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it like she will be\neven with them; for I will venture to say, she has as much ill-nature as\nwill make her a match for your whole clan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat may inconvenience me a little,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a whit--not a whit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Duke, fertile in expedients; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif she\nshould become rather intolerable, which is not unlikely, your honourable\nhouse, which I presume to be a castle, hath, doubtless, both turrets and\ndungeons, and ye may bestow your bonny bride in either the one or the\nother, and then you know you will be out of hearing of her tongue, and\nshe will be either above or below the contempt of your friends.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is sagely counselled, most equitable sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand such\nrestraint would be a fit meed for her folly that gave me any power over\nher.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou entertain the project then, my lord?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Duke Hildebrod.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must turn it in my mind for twenty-four hours,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I\nwill pray you so to order matters that I be not further interrupted by\nany visitors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will utter an edict to secure your privacy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Duke; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand you\ndo not think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, lowering his voice to a confidential whisper,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat ten thousand is too much to pay to the Sovereign, in name of\nwardship?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTen thousand!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy, you said five thousand but\nnow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAha! art avised of that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Duke, touching the side of his\nnose with his finger; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnay, if you have marked me so closely, you are\nthinking on the case more nearly than I believed, till you trapped me.\nWell, well, we will not quarrel about the consideration, as old Trapbois\nwould call it--do you win and wear the dame; it will be no hard matter\nwith your face and figure, and I will take care that no one interrupts\nyou. I will have an edict from the Senate as soon as they meet for their\nmeridiem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, Duke Hildebrod took his leave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\n  This is the time--Heaven's maiden sentinel\n  Hath quitted her high watch--the lesser spangles\n  Are paling one by one; give me the ladder\n  And the short lever--bid Anthony\n  Keep with his carabine the wicket-gate;\n  And do thou bare thy knife and follow me,\n  For we will in and do it--darkness like this\n  Is dawning of our fortunes.\n                           _Old Play._\n\nWhen Duke Hildebrod had withdrawn, Nigel's first impulse was an\nirresistible feeling to laugh at the sage adviser, who would have thus\nconnected him with age, ugliness, and ill-temper; but his next thought\nwas pity for the unfortunate father and daughter, who, being the only\npersons possessed of wealth in this unhappy district, seemed like a\nwreck on the sea-shore of a barbarous country, only secured from plunder\nfor the moment by the jealousy of the tribes among whom it had been\ncast. Neither could he help being conscious that his own residence here\nwas upon conditions equally precarious, and that he was considered by\nthe Alsatians in the same light of a godsend on the Cornish coast, or a\nsickly but wealthy caravan travelling through the wilds of Africa, and\nemphatically termed by the nations of despoilers through whose regions\nit passes _Dummalafong_, which signifies a thing given to be devoured--a\ncommon prey to all men.\n\nNigel had already formed his own plan to extricate himself, at whatever\nrisk, from his perilous and degrading situation; and, in order that he\nmight carry it into instant execution, he only awaited the return of\nLowestoffe's messenger. He expected him, however, in vain, and could\nonly amuse himself by looking through such parts of his baggage as had\nbeen sent to him from his former lodgings, in order to select a small\npacket of the most necessary articles to take with him, in the event of\nhis quitting his lodgings secretly and suddenly, as speed and privacy\nwould, he foresaw, be particularly necessary, if he meant to obtain\nan interview with the king, which was the course his spirit and his\ninterest alike determined him to pursue.\n\nWhile he was thus engaged, he found, greatly to his satisfaction, that\nMaster Lowestoffe had transmitted not only his rapier and poniard, but a\npair of pistols, which he had used in travelling; of a smaller and more\nconvenient size than the large petronels, or horse pistols, which were\nthen in common use, as being made for wearing at the girdle or in the\npockets. Next to having stout and friendly comrades, a man is chiefly\nemboldened by finding himself well armed in case of need, and Nigel,\nwho had thought with some anxiety on the hazard of trusting his life, if\nattacked, to the protection of the clumsy weapon with which Lowestoffe\nhad equipped him, in order to complete his disguise, felt an emotion\nof confidence approaching to triumph, as, drawing his own good and\nwell-tried rapier, he wiped it with his handkerchief, examined its\npoint, bent it once or twice against the ground to prove its well-known\nmetal, and finally replaced it in the scabbard, the more hastily, that\nhe heard a tap at the door of his chamber, and had no mind to be found\nvapouring in the apartment with his sword drawn.\n\nIt was his old host who entered, to tell him with many cringes that the\nprice of his apartment was to be a crown per diem; and that, according\nto the custom of Whitefriars, the rent was always payable per advance,\nalthough he never scrupled to let the money lie till a week or\nfortnight, or even a month, in the hands of any honourable guest like\nMaster Grahame, always upon some reasonable consideration for the use.\nNigel got rid of the old dotard's intrusion, by throwing down two pieces\nof gold, and requesting the accommodation of his present apartment for\neight days, adding, however, he did not think he should tarry so long.\n\nThe miser, with a sparkling eye and a trembling hand, clutched fast the\nproffered coin, and, having balanced the pieces with exquisite pleasure\non the extremity of his withered finger, began almost instantly to\nshow that not even the possession of gold can gratify for more than an\ninstant the very heart that is most eager in the pursuit of it. First,\nthe pieces might be light--with hasty hand he drew a small pair\nof scales from his bosom, and weighed them, first together, then\nseparately, and smiled with glee as he saw them attain the due\ndepression in the balance--a circumstance which might add to his\nprofits, if it were true, as was currently reported, that little of the\ngold coinage was current in Alsatia in a perfect state, and that none\never left the Sanctuary in that condition.\n\nAnother fear then occurred to trouble the old miser's pleasure. He had\nbeen just able to comprehend that Nigel intended to leave the Friars\nsooner than the arrival of the term for which he had deposited the rent.\nThis might imply an expectation of refunding, which, as a Scotch wag\nsaid, of all species of funding, jumped least with the old gentleman's\nhumour. He was beginning to enter a hypothetical caveat on this subject,\nand to quote several reasons why no part of the money once consigned as\nroom-rent, could be repaid back on any pretence, without great hardship\nto the landlord, when Nigel, growing impatient, told him that the money\nwas his absolutely, and without any intention on his part of resuming\nany of it--all he asked in return was the liberty of enjoying in private\nthe apartment he had paid for. Old Trapbois, who had still at his\ntongue's end much of the smooth language, by which, in his time, he had\nhastened the ruin of many a young spendthrift, began to launch out\nupon the noble and generous disposition of his new guest, until Nigel,\ngrowing impatient, took the old gentleman by the hand, and gently, yet\nirresistibly, leading him to the door of the chamber, put him out, but\nwith such decent and moderate exertion of his superior strength, as to\nrender the action in no shape indecorous, and, fastening the door, began\nto do that for his pistols which he had done for his favourite sword,\nexamining with care the flints and locks, and reviewing the state of his\nsmall provision of ammunition.\n\nIn this operation he was a second time interrupted by a knocking at the\ndoor--he called upon the person to enter, having no doubt that it\nwas Lowestoffe's messenger at length arrived. It was, however, the\nungracious daughter of old Trapbois, who, muttering something about her\nfather's mistake, laid down upon the table one of the pieces of gold\nwhich Nigel had just given to him, saying, that what she retained was\nthe full rent for the term he had specified. Nigel replied, he had paid\nthe money, and had no desire to receive it again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo as you will with it, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied his hostess, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor there it lies,\nand shall lie for me. If you are fool enough to pay more than is reason,\nmy father shall not be knave enough to take it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut your father, mistress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour father told me--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, my father, my father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, interrupting him,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cmy father\nmanaged these affairs while he was able--I manage them now, and that may\nin the long run be as well for both of us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe then looked on the table, and observed the weapons.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have arms, I see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo you know how to use them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should do so mistress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor it has been my\noccupation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a soldier, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she demanded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo farther as yet, than as every gentleman of my country is a soldier.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, that is your point of honour--to cut the throats of the poor--a\nproper gentlemanlike occupation for those who should protect them!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not deal in cutting throats, mistress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I\ncarry arms to defend myself, and my country if it needs me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Martha, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is fairly worded; but men say you are as\nprompt as others in petty brawls, where neither your safety nor your\ncountry is in hazard; and that had it not been so, you would not have\nbeen in the Sanctuary to-day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMistress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should labour in vain to make you\nunderstand that a man's honour, which is, or should be, dearer to him\nthan his life, may often call on and compel us to hazard our own\nlives, or those of others, on what would otherwise seem trifling\ncontingencies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod's law says nought of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the female; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have only read\nthere, that thou shall not kill. But I have neither time nor inclination\nto preach to you--you will find enough of fighting here if you like\nit, and well if it come not to seek you when you are least prepared.\nFarewell for the present--the char-woman will execute your commands for\nyour meals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe left the room, just as Nigel, provoked at her assuming a superior\ntone of judgment and of censure, was about to be so superfluous as to\nenter into a dispute with an old pawnbroker's daughter on the subject of\nthe point of honour. He smiled at himself for the folly into which the\nspirit of self-vindication had so nearly hurried him.\n\nLord Glenvarloch then applied to old Deborah the char-woman, by whose\nintermediation he was provided with a tolerably decent dinner; and the\nonly embarrassment which he experienced, was from the almost forcible\nentry of the old dotard his landlord, who insisted upon giving his\nassistance at laying the cloth. Nigel had some difficulty to prevent\nhim from displacing his arms and some papers which were lying on a small\ntable at which he had been sitting; and nothing short of a stern and\npositive injunction to the contrary could compel him to use another\nboard (though there were two in the room) for the purpose of laying the\ncloth.\n\nHaving at length obliged him to relinquish his purpose, he could not\nhelp observing that the eyes of the old dotard seemed still anxiously\nfixed upon the small table on which lay his sword and pistols; and that,\namidst all the little duties which he seemed officiously anxious to\nrender to his guest, he took every opportunity of looking towards and\napproaching these objects of his attention. At length, when Trapbois\nthought he had completely avoided the notice of his guest, Nigel,\nthrough the observation of one of the cracked mirrors, oh which channel\nof communication the old man had not calculated, beheld him actually\nextend his hand towards the table in question. He thought it unnecessary\nto use further ceremony, but telling his landlord, in a stern voice,\nthat he permitted no one to touch his arms, he commanded him to leave\nthe apartment. The old usurer commenced a maundering sort of apology, in\nwhich all that Nigel distinctly apprehended, was a frequent repetition\nof the word _consideration_, and which did not seem to him to require\nany other answer than a reiteration of his command to him to leave the\napartment, upon pain of worse consequences.\n\nThe ancient Hebe who acted as Lord Glenvarloch's cup-bearer, took his\npart against the intrusion of the still more antiquated Ganymede, and\ninsisted on old Trapbois leaving the room instantly, menacing him at\nthe same time with her mistress's displeasure if he remained there any\nlonger. The old man seemed more under petticoat government than any\nother, for the threat of the char-woman produced greater effect upon him\nthan the more formidable displeasure of Nigel. He withdrew grumbling and\nmuttering, and Lord Glenvarloch heard him bar a large door at the nearer\nend of the gallery, which served as a division betwixt the other parts\nof the extensive mansion, and the apartment occupied by his guest,\nwhich, as the reader is aware, had its access from the landing-place at\nthe head of the grand staircase.\n\nNigel accepted the careful sound of the bolts and bars as they were\nseverally drawn by the trembling hand of old Trapbois, as an omen\nthat the senior did not mean again to revisit him in the course of\nthe evening, and heartily rejoiced that he was at length to be left to\nuninterrupted solitude.\n\nThe old woman asked if there was aught else to be done for his\naccommodation; and, indeed, it had hitherto seemed as if the pleasure of\nserving him, or more properly the reward which she expected, had renewed\nher youth and activity. Nigel desired to have candles, to have a fire\nlighted in his apartment, and a few fagots placed beside it, that he\nmight feed it from time to time, as he began to feel the chilly effects\nof the damp and low situation of the house, close as it was to the\nThames. But while the old woman was absent upon his errand, he began to\nthink in what way he should pass the long solitary evening with which he\nwas threatened.\n\nHis own reflections promised to Nigel little amusement, and less\napplause. He had considered his own perilous situation in every light\nin which it could be viewed, and foresaw as little utility as comfort in\nresuming the survey. To divert the current of his ideas, books were, of\ncourse, the readiest resource; and although, like most of us, Nigel had,\nin his time, sauntered through large libraries, and even spent a long\ntime there without greatly disturbing their learned contents, he was now\nin a situation where the possession of a volume, even of very inferior\nmerit, becomes a real treasure. The old housewife returned shortly\nafterwards with fagots, and some pieces of half-burnt wax-candles, the\nperquisites, probably, real or usurped, of some experienced groom of\nthe chambers, two of which she placed in large brass candlesticks, of\ndifferent shapes and patterns, and laid the others on the table, that\nNigel might renew them from time to time as they burnt to the socket.\nShe heard with interest Lord Glenvarloch's request to have a book--any\nsort of book--to pass away the night withal, and returned for answer,\nthat she knew of no other books in the house than her young mistress's\n(as she always denominated Mistress Martha Trapbois) Bible, which the\nowner would not lend; and her master's Whetstone of Witte, being the\nsecond part of Arithmetic, by Robert Record, with the Cossike Practice\nand Rule of Equation; which promising volume Nigel declined to borrow.\nShe offered, however, to bring him some books from Duke Hildebrod--\u00e2\u0080\u009cwho\nsometimes, good gentleman, gave a glance at a book when the State\naffairs of Alsatia left him as much leisure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNigfil embraced the proposal, and his unwearied Iris scuttled away on\nthis second embassy. She returned in a short time with a tattered quarto\nvolume under her arm, and a bottle of sack in her hand; for the Duke,\njudging that mere reading was dry work, had sent the wine by way of\nsauce to help it down, not forgetting to add the price to the morning's\nscore, which he had already run up against the stranger in the\nSanctuary.\n\nNigel seized on the book, and did not refuse the wine, thinking that a\nglass or two, as it really proved to be of good quality, would be no\nbad interlude to his studies. He dismissed, with thanks and assurance\nof reward, the poor old drudge who had been so zealous in his service;\ntrimmed his fire and candles, and placed the easiest of the old\narm-chairs in a convenient posture betwixt the fire and the table at\nwhich he had dined, and which now supported the measure of sack and the\nlights; and thus accompanying his studies with such luxurious appliances\nas were in his power, he began to examine the only volume with which the\nducal library of Alsatia had been able to supply him.\n\nThe contents, though of a kind generally interesting, were not well\ncalculated to dispel the gloom by which he was surrounded. The book was\nentitled \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod's Revenge against Murther;\u00e2\u0080\u009d not, as the bibliomaniacal\nreader may easily conjecture, the work which Reynolds published under\nthat imposing name, but one of a much earlier date, printed and sold\nby old Wolfe; and which, could a copy now be found, would sell for much\nmore than its weight in gold.[Footnote: Only three copies are known\nto exist; one in the library at Kennaquhair, and two--one foxed and\ncropped, the other tall and in good condition--both in the possession\nof an eminent member of the Roxburghe Club.--_Note by_ CAPTAIN\nCLUTTERBUCK.] Nigel had soon enough of the doleful tales which the book\ncontains, and attempted one or two other modes of killing the evening.\nHe looked out at window, but the night was rainy, with gusts of wind;\nhe tried to coax the fire, but the fagots were green, and smoked without\nburning; and as he was naturally temperate, he felt his blood somewhat\nheated by the canary sack which he had already drank, and had no farther\ninclination to that pastime. He next attempted to compose a memorial\naddressed to the king, in which he set forth his case and his\ngrievances; but, speedily stung with the idea that his supplication\nwould be treated with scorn, he flung the scroll into the fire, and, in\na sort of desperation, resumed the book which he had laid aside.\n\nNigel became more interested in the volume at the second than at the\nfirst attempt which he made to peruse it. The narratives, strange and\nshocking as they were to human feeling, possessed yet the interest of\nsorcery or of fascination, which rivets the attention by its awakening\nhorrors. Much was told of the strange and horrible acts of blood by\nwhich men, setting nature and humanity alike at defiance, had, for\nthe thirst of revenge, the lust of gold, or the cravings of irregular\nambition, broken into the tabernacle of life. Yet more surprising and\nmysterious tales were recounted of the mode in which such deeds of blood\nhad come to be discovered and revenged. Animals, irrational animals,\nhad told the secret, and birds of the air had carried the matter. The\nelements had seemed to betray the deed which had polluted them--earth\nhad ceased to support the murderer's steps, fire to warm his frozen\nlimbs, water to refresh his parched lips, air to relieve his gasping\nlungs. All, in short, bore evidence to the homicide's guilt. In other\ncircumstances, the criminal's own awakened conscience pursued and\nbrought him to justice; and in some narratives the grave was said to\nhave yawned, that the ghost of the sufferer might call for revenge.\n\nIt was now wearing late in the night, and the book was still in Nigel's\nhands, when the tapestry which hung behind him flapped against the wall,\nand the wind produced by its motion waved the flame of the candles by\nwhich he was reading. Nigel started and turned round, in that excited\nand irritated state of mind which arose from the nature of his studies,\nespecially at a period when a certain degree of superstition was\ninculcated as a point of religious faith. It was not without emotion\nthat he saw the bloodless countenance, meagre form, and ghastly aspect\nof old Trapbois, once more in the very act of extending his withered\nhand towards the table which supported his arms. Convinced by this\nuntimely apparition that something evil was meditated towards him, Nigel\nsprung up, seized his sword, drew it, and placing it at the old man's\nbreast, demanded of him what he did in his apartment at so untimely an\nhour. Trapbois showed neither fear nor surprise, and only answered\nby some imperfect expressions, intimating he would part with his\nlife rather than with his property; and Lord Glenvarloch, strangely\nembarrassed, knew not what to think of the intruder's motives, and still\nless how to get rid of him. As he again tried the means of intimidation,\nhe was surprised by a second apparition from behind the tapestry, in the\nperson of the daughter of Trapbois, bearing a lamp in her hand. She\nalso seemed to possess her father's insensibility to danger, for, coming\nclose to Nigel, she pushed aside impetuously his naked sword, and even\nattempted to take it out of his hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor shame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour sword on a man of eighty years and\nmore!-=this the honour of a Scottish gentleman!--give it to me to make a\nspindle of!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStand back,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean your father no injury--but I _will_\nknow what has caused him to prowl this whole day, and even at this late\nhour of night, around my arms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour arms!\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated she; \u00e2\u0080\u009calas! young man, the whole arms in the Tower\nof London are of little value to him, in comparison of this miserable\npiece of gold which I left this morning on the table of a young\nspendthrift, too careless to put what belonged to him into his own\npurse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, she showed the piece of gold, which, still remaining on the\ntable, where she left it, had been the bait that attracted old Trapbois\nso frequently to the spot; and which, even in the silence of the night,\nhad so dwelt on his imagination, that he had made use of a private\npassage long disused, to enter his guest's apartment, in order to\npossess himself of the treasure during his slumbers. He now exclaimed,\nat the highest tones of his cracked and feeble voice--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is mine--it is mine!--he gave it to me for a consideration--I will\ndie ere I part with my property!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is indeed his own, mistress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I do entreat you to\nrestore it to the person on whom I have bestowed it, and let me have my\napartment in quiet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will account with you for it, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--said the maiden, reluctantly\ngiving to her father the morsel of Mammon, on which he darted as if his\nbony fingers had been the talons of a hawk seizing its prey; and then\nmaking a contented muttering and mumbling, like an old dog after he\nhas been fed, and just when he is wheeling himself thrice round for the\npurpose of lying down, he followed his daughter behind the tapestry,\nthrough a little sliding-door, which was perceived when the hangings\nwere drawn apart.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis shall be properly fastened to-morrow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the daughter to Nigel,\nspeaking in such a tone that her father, deaf, and engrossed by his\nacquisition, could not hear her; \u00e2\u0080\u009cto-night I will continue to watch him\nclosely.--I wish you good repose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThese few words, pronounced in a tone of more civility than she had yet\nmade use of towards her lodger, contained a wish which was not to be\naccomplished, although her guest, presently after her departure, retired\nto bed.\n\nThere was a slight fever in Nigel's blood, occasioned by the various\nevents of the evening, which put him, as the phrase is, beside his\nrest. Perplexing and painful thoughts rolled on his mind like a troubled\nstream, and the more he laboured to lull himself to slumber, the farther\nhe seemed from attaining his object. He tried all the resources common\nin such cases; kept counting from one to a thousand, until his head\nwas giddy--he watched the embers of the wood fire till his eyes were\ndazzled--he listened to the dull moaning of the wind, the swinging and\ncreaking of signs which projected from the houses, and the baying of\nhere and there a homeless dog, till his very ear was weary.\n\nSuddenly, however, amid this monotony, came a sound which startled him\nat once. It was a female shriek. He sat up in his bed to listen, then\nremembered he was in Alsatia, where brawls of every sort were current\namong the unruly inhabitants. But another scream, and another, and\nanother, succeeded so close, that he was certain, though the noise was\nremote and sounded stifled, it must be in the same house with himself.\n\nNigel jumped up hastily, put on a part of his clothes, seized his sword\nand pistols, and ran to the door of his chamber. Here he plainly heard\nthe screams redoubled, and, as he thought, the sounds came from the\nusurer's apartment. All access to the gallery was effectually excluded\nby the intermediate door, which the brave young lord shook with eager,\nbut vain impatience. But the secret passage occurred suddenly to his\nrecollection. He hastened back to his room, and succeeded with some\ndifficulty in lighting a candle, powerfully agitated by hearing the\ncries repeated, yet still more afraid lest they should sink into\nsilence.\n\nHe rushed along the narrow and winding entrance, guided by the noise,\nwhich now burst more wildly on his ear; and, while he descended a narrow\nstaircase which terminated the passage, he heard the stifled voices\nof men, encouraging, as it seemed, each other. \u00e2\u0080\u009cD--n her, strike\nher down--silence her--beat her brains out!\u00e2\u0080\u009d--while the voice of his\nhostess, though now almost exhausted, was repeating the cry of \u00e2\u0080\u009cmurder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n and \u00e2\u0080\u009chelp.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At the bottom of the staircase was a small door, which gave\nway before Nigel as he precipitated himself upon the scene of action,--a\ncocked pistol in one hand, a candle in the other, and his naked sword\nunder his arm.\n\nTwo ruffians had, with great difficulty, overpowered, or, rather, were\non the point of overpowering, the daughter of Trapbois, whose resistance\nappeared to have been most desperate, for the floor was covered with\nfragments of her clothes, and handfuls of her hair. It appeared that her\nlife was about to be the price of her defence, for one villain had drawn\na long clasp-knife, when they were surprised by the entrance of Nigel,\nwho, as they turned towards him, shot the fellow with the knife dead on\nthe spot, and when the other advanced to him, hurled the candlestick at\nhis head, and then attacked him with his sword. It was dark, save some\npale moonlight from the window; and the ruffian, after firing a pistol\nwithout effect, and fighting a traverse or two with his sword, lost\nheart, made for the window, leaped over it, and escaped. Nigel fired his\nremaining pistol after him at a venture, and then called for light.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is light in the kitchen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Martha Trapbois, with more\npresence of mind than could have been expected. \u00e2\u0080\u009cStay, you know not the\nway; I will fetch it myself.--Oh! my father--my poor father!--I knew\nit would come to this--and all along of the accursed gold!--They have\n_murdered_ him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\n  Death finds us 'mid our playthings--snatches us,\n  As a cross nurse might do a wayward child,\n  From all our toys and baubles. His rough call\n  Unlooses all our favourite ties on earth;\n  And well if they are such as may be answer'd\n  In yonder world, where all is judged of truly.\n                                   _Old Play_.\n\nIt was a ghastly scene which opened, upon Martha Trapbois's return with\na light. Her own haggard and austere features were exaggerated by\nall the desperation of grief, fear, and passion--but the latter was\npredominant. On the floor lay the body of the robber, who had expired\nwithout a groan, while his blood, flowing plentifully, had crimsoned\nall around. Another body lay also there, on which the unfortunate woman\nprecipitated herself in agony, for it was that of her unhappy father. In\nthe next moment she started up, and exclaiming--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere may be life yet!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n strove to raise the body. Nigel went to her assistance, but not without\na glance at the open window; which Martha, as acute as if undisturbed\neither by passion or terror, failed not to interpret justly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFear not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfear not; they are base cowards, to whom courage\nis as much unknown as mercy. If I had had weapons, I could have defended\nmyself against them without assistance or protection.--Oh! my poor\nfather! protection comes too late for this cold and stiff corpse.--He is\ndead--dead!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile she spoke, they were attempting to raise the dead body of the old\nmiser; but it was evident, even from the feeling of the inactive weight\nand rigid joints, that life had forsaken her station. Nigel looked for a\nwound, but saw none. The daughter of the deceased, with more presence\nof mind than a daughter could at the time have been supposed capable\nof exerting, discovered the instrument of his murder--a sort of scarf,\nwhich had been drawn so tight round his throat, as to stifle his cries\nfor assistance, in the first instance, and afterwards to extinguish\nlife.\n\nShe undid the fatal noose; and, laying the old man's body in the arms of\nLord Glenvarloch, she ran for water, for spirits, for essences, in the\nvain hope that life might be only suspended. That hope proved indeed\nvain. She chafed his temples, raised his head, loosened his nightgown,\n(for it seemed as if he had arisen from bed upon hearing the entrance\nof the villains,) and, finally, opened, with difficulty, his fixed and\nclosely-clenched hands, from one of which dropped a key, from the other\nthe very piece of gold about which the unhappy man had been a little\nbefore so anxious, and which probably, in the impaired state of his\nmental faculties, he was disposed to defend with as desperate energy as\nif its amount had been necessary to his actual existence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is in vain--it is in vain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the daughter, desisting from her\nfruitless attempts to recall the spirit which had been effectually\ndislodged, for the neck had been twisted by the violence of the\nmurderers; \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is in vain--he is murdered--I always knew it would be\nthus; and now I witness it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe then snatched up the key and the piece of money, but it was only to\ndash them again on the floor, as she exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAccursed be ye both,\nfor you are the causes of this deed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNigel would have spoken--would have reminded her, that measures should\nbe instantly taken for the pursuit of the murderer who had escaped, as\nwell as for her own security against his return; but she interrupted him\nsharply.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe silent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbe silent. Think you, the thoughts of my own\nheart are not enough to distract me, and with such a sight as this\nbefore me? I say, be silent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said again, and in a yet sterner\ntone--\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan a daughter listen, and her father's murdered corpse lying on\nher knees?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLord Glenvarloch, however overpowered by the energy of her grief, felt\nnot the less the embarrassment of his own situation. He had discharged\nboth his pistols--the robber might return--he had probably other\nassistants besides the man who had fallen, and it seemed to him, indeed,\nas if he had heard a muttering beneath the windows. He explained hastily\nto his companion the necessity of procuring ammunition.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, somewhat contemptuously, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand have ventured\nalready more than ever I expected of man. Go, and shift for yourself,\nsince that is your purpose--leave me to my fate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWithout stopping for needless expostulation, Nigel hastened to his own\nroom through the secret passage, furnished himself with the ammunition\nhe sought for, and returned with the same celerity; wondering himself at\nthe accuracy with which he achieved, in the dark, all the meanderings\nof the passage which he had traversed only once, and that in a moment of\nsuch violent agitation.\n\nHe found, on his return, the unfortunate woman standing like a statue by\nthe body of her father, which she had laid straight on the floor, having\ncovered the face with the skirt of his gown. She testified neither\nsurprise nor pleasure at Nigel's return, but said to him calmly--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy\nmoan is made--my sorrow--all the sorrow at least that man shall ever\nhave noting of, is gone past; but I will have justice, and the base\nvillain who murdered this poor defenceless old man, when he had not, by\nthe course of nature, a twelvemonth's life in him, shall not cumber\nthe earth long after him. Stranger, whom heaven has sent to forward\nthe revenge reserved for this action, go to Hildebrod's--there they are\nawake all night in their revels--bid him come hither--he is bound by his\nduty, and dare not, and shall not, refuse his assistance, which he knows\nwell I can reward. Why do ye tarry?--go instantly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I am fearful of leaving you alone; the\nvillains may return, and--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue, most true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Martha, \u00e2\u0080\u009che may return; and, though I care\nlittle for his murdering me, he may possess himself of what has most\ntempted him. Keep this key and this piece of gold; they are both of\nimportance--defend your life if assailed, and if you kill the villain I\nwill make you rich. I go myself to call for aid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNigel would have remonstrated with her, but she had departed, and in\na moment he heard the house-door clank behind her. For an instant he\nthought of following her; but upon recollection that the distance was\nbut short betwixt the tavern of Hildebrod and the house of Trapbois,\nhe concluded that she knew it better than he--incurred little danger in\npassing it, and that he would do well in the meanwhile to remain on the\nwatch as she recommended.\n\nIt was no pleasant situation for one unused to such scenes to remain\nin the apartment with two dead bodies, recently those of living and\nbreathing men, who had both, within the space of less than half an hour,\nsuffered violent death; one of them by the hand of the assassin, the\nother, whose blood still continued to flow from the wound in his throat,\nand to flood all around him, by the spectator's own deed of violence,\nthough of justice. He turned his face from those wretched relics of\nmortality with a feeling of disgust, mingled with superstition; and he\nfound, when he had done so, that the consciousness of the presence\nof these ghastly objects, though unseen by him, rendered him more\nuncomfortable than even when he had his eyes fixed upon, and reflected\nby, the cold, staring, lifeless eyeballs of the deceased. Fancy also\nplayed her usual sport with him. He now thought he heard the well-worn\ndamask nightgown of the deceased usurer rustle; anon, that he heard the\nslaughtered bravo draw up his leg, the boot scratching the floor as if\nhe was about to rise; and again he deemed he heard the footsteps and\nthe whisper of the returned ruffian under the window from which he had\nlately escaped. To face the last and most real danger, and to parry the\nterrors which the other class of feelings were like to impress upon him,\nNigel went to the window, and was much cheered to observe the light of\nseveral torches illuminating the street, and followed, as the murmur\nof voices denoted, by a number of persons, armed, it would seem, with\nfirelocks and halberds, and attendant on Hildebrod, who (not in his\nfantastic office of duke, but in that which he really possessed of\nbailiff of the liberty and sanctuary of Whitefriars) was on his way to\ninquire into the crime and its circumstances.\n\nIt was a strange and melancholy contrast to see these debauchees,\ndisturbed in the very depth of their midnight revel, on their arrival at\nsuch a scene as this. They stared on each other, and on the bloody work\nbefore them, with lack-lustre eyes; staggered with uncertain steps\nover boards slippery with blood; their noisy brawling voices sunk into\nstammering whispers; and, with spirits quelled by what they saw, while\ntheir brains were still stupefied by the liquor which they had drunk,\nthey seemed like men walking in their sleep.\n\nOld Hildebrod was an exception to the general condition. That seasoned\ncask, however full, was at all times capable of motion, when there\noccurred a motive sufficiently strong to set him a-rolling. He seemed\nmuch shocked at what he beheld, and his proceedings, in consequence,\nhad more in them of regularity and propriety, than he might have been\nsupposed capable of exhibiting upon any occasion whatever. The\ndaughter was first examined, and stated, with wonderful accuracy and\ndistinctness, the manner in which she had been alarmed with a noise of\nstruggling and violence in her father's apartment, and that the\nmore readily, because she was watching him on account of some alarm\nconcerning his health. On her entrance, she had seen her father sinking\nunder the strength of two men, upon whom she rushed with all the fury\nshe was capable of. As their faces were blackened, and their figures\ndisguised, she could not pretend, in the hurry of a moment so dreadfully\nagitating, to distinguish either of them as persons whom she had seen\nbefore. She remembered little more except the firing of shots, until\nshe found herself alone with her guest, and saw that the ruffians had\nescaped. Lord Glenvarloch told his story as we have given it to the\nreader. The direct evidence thus received, Hildebrod examined the\npremises. He found that the villains had made their entrance by the\nwindow out of which the survivor had made his escape; yet it seemed\nsingular that they should have done so, as it was secured with strong\niron bars, which old Trapbois was in the habit of shutting with his own\nhand at nightfall. He minuted down with great accuracy, the state of\nevery thing in the apartment, and examined carefully the features of the\nslain robber. He was dressed like a seaman of the lowest order, but\nhis face was known to none present. Hildebrod next sent for an Alsatian\nsurgeon, whose vices, undoing what his skill might have done for him,\nhad consigned him to the wretched practice of this place. He made him\nexamine the dead bodies, and make a proper declaration of the manner in\nwhich the sufferers seemed to have come by their end. The circumstances\nof the sash did not escape the learned judge, and having listened to\nall that could be heard or conjectured on the subject, and collected\nall particulars of evidence which appeared to bear on the bloody\ntransaction, he commanded the door of the apartment to be locked until\nnext morning; and carrying, the unfortunate daughter of the murdered\nman into the kitchen, where there was no one in presence but Lord\nGlenvarloch, he asked her gravely, whether she suspected no one in\nparticular of having committed the deed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo _you_ suspect no one?\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Martha, looking fixedly on him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps, I may, mistress; but it is my part to ask questions, yours to\nanswer them. That's the rule of the game.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen I suspect him who wore yonder sash. Do not you know whom I mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, if you call on me for honours, I must needs say I have seen\nCaptain Peppercull have one of such a fashion, and he was not a man to\nchange his suits often.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSend out, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Martha, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand have him apprehended.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it is he, he will be far by this time; but I will communicate with\nthe higher powers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the judge.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou would have him escape,\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed she, fixing her eyes on him\nsternly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy cock and pie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Hildebrod, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdid it depend on me, the\nmurdering cut-throat should hang as high as ever Haman did--but let me\ntake my time. He has friends among us, _that_ you wot well; and all that\nshould assist me are as drunk as fiddlers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will have revenge--I _will_ have it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated she; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand take heed\nyou trifle not with me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrifle! I would sooner trifle with a she-bear the minute after they had\nbaited her. I tell you, mistress, be but patient, and we will have him.\nI know all his haunts, and he cannot forbear them long; and I will have\ntrap-doors open for him. You cannot want justice, mistress, for you have\nthe means to get it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey who help me in my revenge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Martha, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshall share those\nmeans.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEnough said,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Hildebrod; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand now I would have you go to my\nhouse, and get something hot--you will be but dreary here by yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will send for the old char-woman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Martha, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand we have the\nstranger gentleman, besides.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUmph, umph--the stranger gentleman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hildebrod to Nigel, whom\nhe drew a little apart. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI fancy the captain has made the stranger\ngentleman's fortune when he was making a bold dash for his own. I\ncan tell your honour--I must not say lordship--that I think my having\nchanced to give the greasy buff-and-iron scoundrel some hint of what I\nrecommended to you to-day, has put him on this rough game. The better\nfor you--you will get the cash without the father-in-law.--You will keep\nconditions, I trust?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish you had said nothing to any one of a scheme so absurd,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nNigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAbsurd!--Why, think you she will not have thee? Take her with the tear\nin her eye, man--take her with the tear in her eye. Let me hear from you\nto-morrow. Good-night, good-night--a nod is as good as a wink. I must to\nmy business of sealing and locking up. By the way, this horrid work has\nput all out of my head.--Here is a fellow from Mr. Lowestoffe has been\nasking to see you. As he said his business was express, the Senate only\nmade him drink a couple of flagons, and he was just coming to beat up\nyour quarters when this breeze blew up.--Ahey, friend! there is Master\nNigel Grahame.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA young man, dressed in a green plush jerkin, with a badge on the\nsleeve, and having the appearance of a waterman, approached and took\nNigel aside, while Duke Hildebrod went from place to place to exercise\nhis authority, and to see the windows fastened, and the doors of the\napartment locked up. The news communicated by Lowestoffe's messenger\nwere not the most pleasant. They were intimated in a courteous whisper\nto Nigel, to the following effect:--That Master Lowestoffe prayed him to\nconsult his safety by instantly leaving Whitefriars, for that a warrant\nfrom the Lord Chief-Justice had been issued out for apprehending him,\nand would be put in force to-morrow, by the assistance of a party of\nmusketeers, a force which the Alsatians neither would nor dared to\nresist.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd so, squire,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the aquatic emissary, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy wherry is to wait you\nat the Temple Stairs yonder, at five this morning, and, if you would\ngive the blood-hounds the slip, why, you may.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy did not Master Lowestoffe write to me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas! the good gentleman lies up in lavender for it himself, and has as\nlittle to do with pen and ink as if he were a parson.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid he send any token to me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cToken!--ay, marry did he--token enough, an I have not forgot it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nthe fellow; then, giving a hoist to the waistband of his breeches, he\nsaid,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, I have it--you were to believe me, because your name was\nwritten with an O, for Grahame. Ay, that was it, I think.--Well, shall\nwe meet in two hours, when tide turns, and go down the river like a\ntwelve-oared barge?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is the king just now, knowest thou?\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lord Glenvarloch.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe king! why, he went down to Greenwich yesterday by water, like a\nnoble sovereign as he is, who will always float where he can. He was\nto have hunted this week, but that purpose is broken, they say; and\nthe Prince, and the Duke, and all of them at Greenwich, are as merry as\nminnows.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will be ready to go at five; do thou come\nhither to carry my baggage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, master,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the fellow, and left the house mixing himself\nwith the disorderly attendants of Duke Hildebrod, who were now retiring.\nThat potentate entreated Nigel to make fast the doors behind him, and,\npointing to the female who sat by the expiring fire with her limbs\noutstretched, like one whom the hand of Death had already arrested, he\nwhispered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMind your hits, and mind your bargain, or I will cut your\nbow-string for you before you can draw it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFeeling deeply the ineffable brutality which could recommend the\nprosecuting such views over a wretch in such a condition, Lord\nGlenvarloch yet commanded his temper so far as to receive the advice\nin silence, and attend to the former part of it, by barring the door\ncarefully behind Duke Hildebrod and his suite, with the tacit hope\nthat he should never again see or hear of them. He then returned to the\nkitchen, in which the unhappy woman remained, her hands still clenched,\nher eyes fixed, and her limbs extended, like those of a person in a\ntrance. Much moved by her situation, and with the prospect which lay\nbefore her, he endeavoured to awaken her to existence by every means in\nhis power, and at length apparently succeeded in dispelling her stupor,\nand attracting her attention. He then explained to her that he was\nin the act of leaving Whitefriars in a few hours--that his future\ndestination was uncertain, but that he desired anxiously to know whether\nhe could contribute to her protection by apprizing any friend of her\nsituation, or otherwise. With some difficulty she seemed to comprehend\nhis meaning, and thanked him with her usual short ungracious manner. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\nmight mean well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut he ought to know that the miserable had\nno friends.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNigel said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe would not willingly be importunate, but, as he was about\nto leave the Friars--\u00e2\u0080\u009d She interrupted him--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are about to leave the Friars? I will go with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou go with me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Lord Glenvarloch.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will persuade my father to leave this murdering\nden.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But, as she spoke, the more perfect recollection of what had\npassed crowded on her mind. She hid her face in her hands, and burst out\ninto a dreadful fit of sobs, moans, and lamentations, which terminated\nin hysterics, violent in proportion to the uncommon strength of her body\nand mind.\n\nLord Glenvarloch, shocked, confused, and inexperienced, was about to\nleave the house in quest of medical, or at least female assistance; but\nthe patient, when the paroxysm had somewhat spent its force, held him\nfast by the sleeve with one hand, covering her face with the other,\nwhile a copious flood of tears came to relieve the emotions of grief by\nwhich she had been so violently agitated.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not leave me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said--\u00e2\u0080\u009cdo not leave me, and call no one. I have\nnever been in this way before, and would not now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, sitting\nupright, and wiping her eyes with her apron,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cwould not now--but\nthat--but that he loved _me_. if he loved nothing else that was\nhuman--To die so, and by such hands!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd again the unhappy woman gave way to a paroxysm of sorrow, mingling\nher tears with sobbing, wailing, and all the abandonment of female\ngrief, when at its utmost height. At length, she gradually recovered\nthe austerity of her natural composure, and maintained it as if by a\nforcible exertion of resolution, repelling, as she spoke, the repeated\nreturns of the hysterical affection, by such an effort as that by which\nepileptic patients are known to suspend the recurrence of their fits.\nYet her mind, however resolved, could not so absolutely overcome the\naffection of her nerves, but that she was agitated by strong fits of\ntrembling, which, for a minute or two at a time, shook her whole frame\nin a manner frightful to witness. Nigel forgot his own situation, and,\nindeed, every thing else, in the interest inspired by the unhappy woman\nbefore him--an interest which affected a proud spirit the more deeply,\nthat she herself, with correspondent highness of mind, seemed determined\nto owe as little as possible either to the humanity or the pity of\nothers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not wont to be in this way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut--but--Nature will\nhave power over the frail beings it has made. Over you, sir, I have some\nright; for, without you, I had not survived this awful night. I wish\nyour aid had been either earlier or later--but you have saved my life,\nand you are bound to assist in making it endurable to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you will show me how it is possible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are going hence, you say, instantly--carry me with you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nthe unhappy woman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my own efforts, I shall never escape from this\nwilderness of guilt and misery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas! what can I do for you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Nigel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy own way, and I must\nnot deviate from it, leads me, in all probability, to a dungeon. I\nmight, indeed, transport you from hence with me, if you could afterwards\nbestow yourself with any friend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFriend!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she exclaimed--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no friend--they have long since\ndiscarded us. A spectre arising from the dead were more welcome than\nI should be at the doors of those who have disclaimed us; and, if they\nwere willing to restore their friendship to me now, I would despise it,\nbecause they withdrew it from him--from him\u00e2\u0080\u009d--(here she underwent strong\nbut suppressed agitation, and then added firmly)--\u00e2\u0080\u009cfrom _him_ who lies\nyonder.--I have no friend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here she paused; and then suddenly, as if\nrecollecting herself, added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no friend, but I have that\nwill purchase many--I have that which will purchase both friends and\navengers.--It is well thought of; I must not leave it for a prey to\ncheats and ruffians.--Stranger, you must return to yonder room. Pass\nthrough it boldly to his--that is, to the sleeping apartment; push the\nbedstead aside; beneath each of the posts is a brass plate, as if to\nsupport the weight, but it is that upon the left, nearest to the wall,\nwhich must serve your turn--press the corner of the plate, and it will\nspring up and show a keyhole, which this key will open. You will then\nlift a concealed trap-door, and in a cavity of the floor you will\ndiscover a small chest. Bring it hither; it shall accompany our journey,\nand it will be hard if the contents cannot purchase me a place of\nrefuge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the door communicating with the kitchen has been locked by these\npeople,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue, I had forgot; they had their reasons for that, doubtless,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered she. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the secret passage from your apartment is open, and\nyou may go that way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLord Glenvarloch took the key, and, as he lighted a lamp to show him the\nway, she read in his countenance some unwillingness to the task imposed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou fear?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she--\u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is no cause; the murderer and his victim\nare both at rest. Take courage, I will go with you myself--you cannot\nknow the trick of the spring, and the chest will be too heavy for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo fear, no fear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lord Glenvarloch, ashamed of the\nconstruction she put upon a momentary hesitation, arising from a dislike\nto look upon what is horrible, often connected with those high-wrought\nminds which are the last to fear what is merely dangerous--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will do\nyour errand as you desire; but for you, you must not--cannot go yonder.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can--I will,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am composed. You shall see that I am so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n She took from the table a piece of unfinished sewing-work, and, with\nsteadiness and composure, passed a silken thread into the eye of a\nfine needle.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cCould I have done that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, with a smile yet more\nghastly than her previous look of fixed despair, \u00e2\u0080\u009chad not my heart and\nhand been both steady?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe then led the way rapidly up stairs to Nigel's chamber, and proceeded\nthrough the secret passage with the same haste, as if she had feared her\nresolution might have failed her ere her purpose was executed. At the\nbottom of the stairs she paused a moment, before entering the fatal\napartment, then hurried through with a rapid step to the sleeping\nchamber beyond, followed closely by Lord Glenvarloch, whose reluctance\nto approach the scene of butchery was altogether lost in the anxiety\nwhich he felt on account of the survivor of the tragedy.\n\nHer first action was to pull aside the curtains of her father's bed. The\nbed-clothes were thrown aside in confusion, doubtless in the action of\nhis starting from sleep to oppose the entrance of the villains into the\nnext apartment. The hard mattress scarcely showed the slight pressure\nwhere the emaciated body of the old miser had been deposited. His\ndaughter sank beside the bed, clasped her hands, and prayed to heaven,\nin a short and affectionate manner, for support in her affliction,\nand for vengeance on the villains who had made her fatherless. A\nlow-muttered and still more brief petition recommended to Heaven the\nsoul of the sufferer, and invoked pardon for his sins, in virtue of the\ngreat Christian atonement.\n\nThis duty of piety performed, she signed to Nigel to aid her; and,\nhaving pushed aside the heavy bedstead, they saw the brass plate which\nMartha had described. She pressed the spring, and, at once, the plate\nstarting up, showed the keyhole, and a large iron ring used in lifting\nthe trap-door, which, when raised, displayed the strong box, or small\nchest, she had mentioned, and which proved indeed so very weighty, that\nit might perhaps have been scarcely possible for Nigel, though a very\nstrong man, to have raised it without assistance.\n\nHaving replaced everything as they had found it, Nigel, with such help\nas his companion was able to afford, assumed his load, and made a shift\nto carry it into the next apartment, where lay the miserable owner,\ninsensible to sounds and circumstances, which, if any thing could\nhave broken his long last slumber, would certainly have done so. His\nunfortunate daughter went up to his body, and had even the courage to\nremove the sheet which had been decently disposed over it. She put her\nhand on the heart, but there was no throb--held a feather to the lips,\nbut there was no motion--then kissed with deep reverence the starting\nveins of the pale forehead, and then the emaciated hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would you could hear me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cFather! I would you could hear\nme swear, that, if I now save what you most valued on earth, it is only\nto assist me in obtaining vengeance for your death.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe replaced the covering, and, without a tear, a sigh, or an additional\nword of any kind, renewed her efforts, until they conveyed the\nstrong-box betwixt them into Lord Glenvarloch's sleeping apartment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\nmust pass,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas part of your baggage. I will be in readiness\nso soon as the waterman calls.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe retired; and Lord Glenvarloch, who saw the hour of their departure\napproach, tore down a part of the old hanging to make a covering, which\nhe corded upon the trunk, lest the peculiarity of its shape, and the\ncare with which it was banded and counterbanded with bars of steel,\nmight afford suspicions respecting the treasure which it contained.\nHaving taken this measure of precaution, he changed the rascally\ndisguise, which he had assumed on entering Whitefriars, into a suit\nbecoming his quality, and then, unable to sleep, though exhausted\nwith the events of the night, he threw himself on his bed to await the\nsummons of the waterman.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\n  Give us good voyage, gentle stream--we stun not\n  Thy sober ear with sounds of revelry;\n  Wake not the slumbering echoes of thy banks\n  With voice of flute and horn--we do but seek\n  On the broad pathway of thy swelling bosom\n  To glide in silent safety.\n                             _The Double Bridal._\n\nGrey, or rather yellow light, was beginning to twinkle through the\nfogs of Whitefriars, when a low tap at the door of the unhappy miser\nannounced to Lord Glenvarloch the summons of the boatman. He found at\nthe door the man whom he had seen the night before, with a companion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, come, master, let us get afloat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one of them, in a rough\nimpressive whisper, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctime and tide wait for no man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey shall not wait for me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I have some\nthings to carry with me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay--no man will take a pair of oars now, Jack, unless he means to\nload the wherry like a six-horse waggon. When they don't want to shift\nthe whole kitt, they take a sculler, and be d--d to them. Come, come,\nwhere be your rattle-traps?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOne of the men was soon sufficiently loaded, in his own estimation at\nleast, with Lord Glenvarloch's mail and its accompaniments, with which\nburden he began to trudge towards the Temple Stairs. His comrade, who\nseemed the principal, began to handle the trunk which contained the\nmiser's treasure, but pitched it down again in an instant, declaring,\nwith a great oath, that it was as reasonable to expect a man to carry\nPaul's on his back. The daughter of Trapbois, who had by this time\njoined them, muffled up in a long dark hood and mantle, exclaimed to\nLord Glenvarloch--\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet them leave it if they will, let them leave it\nall; let us but escape from this horrible place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe have mentioned elsewhere, that Nigel was a very athletic young man,\nand, impelled by a strong feeling of compassion and indignation, he\nshowed his bodily strength singularly on this occasion, by seizing on\nthe ponderous strong-box, and, by means of the rope he had cast around\nit, throwing it on his shoulders, and marching resolutely forward under\na weight, which would have sunk to the earth three young gallants,\nat the least, of our degenerate day. The waterman followed him in\namazement, calling out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, master, master, you might as well gie me\nt'other end on't!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and anon offered his assistance to support it in some\ndegree behind, which after the first minute or two Nigel was fain to\naccept. His strength was almost exhausted when he reached the wherry,\nwhich was lying at the Temple Stairs according to appointment; and, when\nhe pitched the trunk into it, the weight sank the bow of the boat so low\nin the water as well-nigh to overset it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe shall have as hard a fare of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the waterman to his\ncompanion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas if we were ferrying over an honest bankrupt with all his\nsecreted goods--Ho, ho! good woman, what, are you stepping in for?--our\ngunwale lies deep enough in the water without live lumber to boot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis person comes with me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch; \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe is for the\npresent under my protection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, come, master,\u00e2\u0080\u009d rejoined the fellow, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is out of my\ncommission. You must not double my freight on me--she may go by\nland--and, as for protection, her face will protect her from Berwick to\nthe Land's End.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will not except at my doubling the loading, if I double the fare?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said Nigel, determined on no account to relinquish the protection of\nthis unhappy woman, for which he had already devised some sort of plan,\nlikely now to be baffled by the characteristic rudeness of the Thames\nwatermen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, by G----, but I will except, though,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the fellow with the green\nplush jacket: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will overload my wherry neither for love nor money--I\nlove my boat as well as my wife, and a thought better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, nay, comrade,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his mate, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is speaking no true water\nlanguage. For double fare we are bound to row a witch in her eggshell if\nshe bid us; and so pull away, Jack, and let us have no more prating.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey got into the stream-way accordingly, and, although heavily laden,\nbegan to move down the river with reasonable speed.\n\nThe lighter vessels which passed, overtook, or crossed them, in their\ncourse, failed not to assail them with their boisterous raillery, which\nwas then called water-wit; for which the extreme plainness of Mistress\nMartha's features, contrasted with the youth, handsome figure, and good\nlooks of Nigel, furnished the principal topics; while the circumstance\nof the boat being somewhat overloaded, did not escape their notice. They\nwere hailed successively, as a grocer's wife upon a party of pleasure\nwith her eldest apprentice--as an old woman carrying her grandson to\nschool--and as a young strapping Irishman, conveying an ancient maiden\nto Dr. Rigmarole's, at Redriffe, who buckles beggars for a tester and\na dram of Geneva. All this abuse was retorted in a similar strain of\nhumour by Greenjacket and his companion, who maintained the war of wit\nwith the same alacrity with which they were assailed.\n\nMeanwhile, Lord Glenvarloch asked his desolate companion if she had\nthought on any place where she could remain in safety with her property.\nShe confessed, in more detail than formerly, that her father's character\nhad left her no friends; and that, from the time he had betaken himself\nto Whitefriars, to escape certain legal consequences of his eager\npursuit of gain, she had lived a life of total seclusion; not\nassociating with the society which the place afforded, and, by her\nresidence there, as well as her father's parsimony, effectually cut off\nfrom all other company. What she now wished, was, in the first place,\nto obtain the shelter of a decent lodging, and the countenance of honest\npeople, however low in life, until she should obtain legal advice as\nto the mode of obtaining justice on her father's murderer. She had\nno hesitation to charge the guilt upon Colepepper, (commonly called\nPeppercull,) whom she knew to be as capable of any act of treacherous\ncruelty, as he was cowardly, where actual manhood was required. He\nhad been strongly suspected of two robberies before, one of which\nwas coupled with an atrocious murder. He had, she intimated, made\npretensions to her hand as the easiest and safest way of obtaining\npossession of her father's wealth; and, on her refusing his addresses,\nif they could be termed so, in the most positive terms, he had thrown\nout such obscure hints of vengeance, as, joined with some imperfect\nassaults upon the house, had kept her in frequent alarm, both on her\nfather's account and her own.\n\nNigel, but that his feeling of respectful delicacy to the unfortunate\nwoman forebade him to do so, could here have communicated a circumstance\ncorroborative of her suspicions, which had already occurred to his own\nmind. He recollected the hint that old Hildebrod threw forth on the\npreceding night, that some communication betwixt himself and Colepepper\nhad hastened the catastrophe. As this communication related to the\nplan which Hildebrod had been pleased to form, of promoting a marriage\nbetwixt Nigel himself and the rich heiress of Trapbois, the fear\nof losing an opportunity not to be regained, together with the mean\nmalignity of a low-bred ruffian, disappointed in a favourite scheme,\nwas most likely to instigate the bravo to the deed of violence which\nhad been committed. The reflection that his own name was in some\ndegree implicated with the causes of this horrid tragedy, doubled Lord\nGlenvarloch's anxiety in behalf of the victim whom he had rescued, while\nat the same time he formed the tacit resolution, that, so soon as his\nown affairs were put upon some footing, he would contribute all in his\npower towards the investigation of this bloody affair.\n\nAfter ascertaining from his companion that she could form no better plan\nof her own, he recommended to her to take up her lodging for the time,\nat the house of his old landlord, Christie the ship-chandler, at Paul's\nWharf, describing the decency and honesty of that worthy couple, and\nexpressing his hopes that they would receive her into their own house,\nor recommend her at least to that of some person for whom they would be\nresponsible, until she should have time to enter upon other arrangements\nfor herself.\n\nThe poor woman received advice so grateful to her in her desolate\ncondition, with an expression of thanks, brief indeed, but deeper\nthan any thing had yet extracted from the austerity of her natural\ndisposition.\n\nLord Glenvarloch then proceeded to inform Martha, that certain reasons,\nconnected with his personal safety, called him immediately to Greenwich,\nand, therefore, it would not be in his power to accompany her to\nChristie's house, which he would otherwise have done with pleasure: but,\ntearing a leaf from his tablet, he wrote on it a few lines, addressed\nto his landlord, as a man of honesty and humanity, in which he described\nthe bearer as a person who stood in singular necessity of temporary\nprotection and good advice, for which her circumstances enabled her to\nmake ample acknowledgment. He therefore requested John Christie, as his\nold and good friend, to afford her the shelter of his roof for a short\ntime; or, if that might not be consistent with his convenience, at least\nto direct her to a proper lodging-and, finally, he imposed on him the\nadditional, and somewhat more difficult commission, to recommend her to\nthe counsel and services of an honest, at least a reputable and skilful\nattorney, for the transacting some law business of importance. The note\nhe subscribed with his real name, and, delivering it to his _protegee_,\nwho received it with another deeply uttered \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thank you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which spoke\nthe sterling feelings of her gratitude better than a thousand combined\nphrases, he commanded the watermen to pull in for Paul's Wharf, which\nthey were now approaching.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have not time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Green-jacket; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe cannot be stopping every\ninstant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut, upon Nigel insisting upon his commands being obeyed, and adding,\nthat it was for the purpose of putting the lady ashore, the waterman\ndeclared that he would rather have her room than her company, and put\nthe wherry alongside the wharf accordingly. Here two of the porters, who\nply in such places, were easily induced to undertake the charge of the\nponderous strong-box, and at the same time to guide the owner to the\nwell-known mansion of John Christie, with whom all who lived in that\nneighbourhood were perfectly acquainted.\n\nThe boat, much lightened of its load, went down the Thames at a rate\nincreased in proportion. But we must forbear to pursue her in her voyage\nfor a few minutes, since we have previously to mention the issue of Lord\nGlenvarloch's recommendation.\n\nMistress Martha Trapbois reached the shop in perfect safety, and was\nabout to enter it, when a sickening sense of the uncertainty of her\nsituation, and of the singularly painful task of telling her story, came\nover her so strongly, that she paused a moment at the very threshold\nof her proposed place of refuge, to think in what manner she could best\nsecond the recommendation of the friend whom Providence had raised up\nto her. Had she possessed that knowledge of the world, from which her\nhabits of life had completely excluded her, she might have known\nthat the large sum of money which she brought along with her, might,\njudiciously managed, have been a passport to her into the mansions\nof nobles, and the palaces of princes. But, however conscious of its\ngeneral power, which assumes so many forms and complexions, she was so\ninexperienced as to be most unnecessarily afraid that the means by which\nthe wealth had been acquired, might exclude its inheretrix from shelter\neven in the house of a humble tradesman.\n\nWhile she thus delayed, a more reasonable cause for hesitation arose, in\na considerable noise and altercation within the house, which grew louder\nand louder as the disputants issued forth upon the street or lane before\nthe door.\n\nThe first who entered upon the scene was a tall raw-boned hard-favoured\nman, who stalked out of the shop hastily, with a gait like that of a\nSpaniard in a passion, who, disdaining to add speed to his locomotion by\nrunning, only condescends, in the utmost extremity of his angry haste,\nto add length to his stride. He faced about, so soon as he was out\nof the house, upon his pursuer, a decent-looking, elderly, plain\ntradesman--no other than John Christie himself, the owner of the shop\nand tenement, by whom he seemed to be followed, and who was in a state\nof agitation more than is usually expressed by such a person.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll hear no more on't,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the personage who first appeared on the\nscene.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir, I will hear no more on it. Besides being a most false\nand impudent figment, as I can testify--it is _Scandaalum Magnaatum_,\nsir--_Scandaalum Magnaatum_\u00e2\u0080\u009d he reiterated with a broad accentuation of\nthe first vowel, well known in the colleges of Edinburgh and Glasgow,\nwhich we can only express in print by doubling the said first of letters\nand of vowels, and which would have cheered the cockles of the reigning\nmonarch had he been within hearing,--as he was a severer stickler for\nwhat he deemed the genuine pronunciation of the Roman tongue, than for\nany of the royal prerogatives, for which he was at times disposed to\ninsist so strenuously in his speeches to Parliament.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI care not an ounce of rotten cheese,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said John Christie in reply,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat you call it--but it is TRUE; and I am a free Englishman, and have\nright to speak the truth in my own concerns; and your master is little\nbetter than a villain, and you no more than a swaggering coxcomb, whose\nhead I will presently break, as I have known it well broken before on\nlighter occasion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd, so saying, he flourished the paring-shovel which usually made clean\nthe steps of his little shop, and which he had caught up as the readiest\nweapon of working his foeman damage, and advanced therewith upon him.\nThe cautious Scot (for such our readers must have already pronounced\nhim, from his language and pedantry) drew back as the enraged\nship-chandler approached, but in a surly manner, and bearing his hand\non his sword-hilt rather in the act of one who was losing habitual\nforbearance and caution of deportment, than as alarmed by the attack of\nan antagonist inferior to himself in youth, strength, and weapons.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBide back,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaister Christie--I say bide back, and consult\nyour safety, man. I have evited striking you in your ain house under\nmuckle provocation, because I am ignorant how the laws here may\npronounce respecting burglary and hamesucken, and such matters; and,\nbesides, I would not willingly hurt ye, man, e'en on the causeway, that\nis free to us baith, because I mind your kindness of lang syne, and\npartly consider ye as a poor deceived creature. But deil d--n me, sir,\nand I am not wont to swear, but if you touch my Scotch shouther with\nthat shule of yours, I will make six inches of my Andrew Ferrara\ndeevilish intimate with your guts, neighbour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd therewithal, though still retreating from the brandished shovel, he\nmade one-third of the basket-hilled broadsword which he wore, visible\nfrom the sheath. The wrath of John Christie was abated, either by his\nnatural temperance of disposition, or perhaps in part by the glimmer of\ncold steel, which flashed on him from his adversary's last action.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would do well to cry clubs on thee, and have thee ducked at the\nwharf,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, grounding his shovel, however, at the same time, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor\na paltry swaggerer, that would draw thy bit of iron there on an honest\ncitizen before his own door; but get thee gone, and reckon on a salt eel\nfor thy supper, if thou shouldst ever come near my house again. I wish\nit had been at the bottom of the Thames when it first gave the use of\nits roof to smooth-faced, oily-tongued, double-minded Scots thieves!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's an ill bird that fouls its own nest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied his adversary, not\nperhaps the less bold that he saw matters were taking the turn of a\npacific debate; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand a pity it is that a kindly Scot should ever\nhave married in foreign parts, and given life to a purse-proud,\npudding-headed, fat-gutted, lean-brained Southron, e'en such as you,\nMaister Christie. But fare ye weel--fare ye weel, for ever and a day;\nand, if you quarrel wi' a Scot again, man, say as mickle ill o' himsell\nas ye like, but say nane of his patron or of his countrymen, or it will\nscarce be your flat cap that will keep your lang lugs from the sharp\nabridgement of a Highland whinger, man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd, if you continue your insolence to me before my own door, were\nit but two minutes longer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d retorted John Christie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will call the\nconstable, and make your Scottish ankles acquainted with an English pair\nof stocks!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he turned to retire into his shop with some show of victory;\nfor his enemy, whatever might be his innate valour, manifested no\ndesire to drive matters to extremity--conscious, perhaps, that whatever\nadvantage he might gain in single combat with Jonn Christie, would\nbe more than overbalanced by incurring an affair with the constituted\nauthorities of Old England, not at that time apt to be particularly\nfavourable to their new fellow-subjects, in the various successive\nbroils which were then constantly taking place between the individuals\nof two proud nations, who still retained a stronger sense of their\nnational animosity during centuries, than of their late union for a few\nyears under the government of the same prince.\n\nMrs. Martha Trapbois had dwelt too long in Alsatia, to be either\nsurprised or terrified at the altercation she had witnessed. Indeed,\nshe only wondered that the debate did not end in some of those acts of\nviolence by which they were usually terminated in the Sanctuary. As\nthe disputants separated from each other, she, who had no idea that the\ncause of the quarrel was more deeply rooted than in the daily scenes of\nthe same nature which she had heard of or witnessed, did not hesitate to\nstop Master Christie in his return to his shop, and present to him the\nletter which Lord Glenvarloch had given to her. Had she been better\nacquainted with life and its business, she would certainly have waited\nfor a more temperate moment; and she had reason to repent of her\nprecipitation, when, without saying a single word, or taking the trouble\nto gather more of the information contained in the letter than was\nexpressed in the subscription, the incensed ship chandler threw it down\non the ground, trampled it in high disdain, and, without addressing a\nsingle word to the bearer, except, indeed, something much more like\na hearty curse than was perfectly consistent with his own grave\nappearance, he retired into his shop, and shut the hatch-door.\n\nIt was with the most inexpressible anguish that the desolate, friendless\nand unhappy female, thus beheld her sole hope of succour, countenance,\nand protection, vanish at once, without being able to conceive a reason;\nfor, to do her justice, the idea that her friend, whom she knew by\nthe name of Nigel Grahame, had imposed on her, a solution which might\nreadily have occurred to many in her situation, never once entered\nher mind. Although it was not her temper easily to bend her mind to\nentreaty, she could not help exclaiming after the ireful and retreating\nship-chandler,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood Master, hear me but a moment! for mercy's sake,\nfor honesty's sake!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMercy and honesty from him, mistress!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Scot, who, though he\nessayed not to interrupt the retreat of his antagonist, still kept stout\npossession of the field of action,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cye might as weel expect brandy from\nbean-stalks, or milk from a craig of blue whunstane. The man is mad, bom\nmad, to boot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must have mistaken the person to whom the letter was addressed,\nthen;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and, as she spoke, Mistress Martha Trapbois was in the act of\nstooping to lift the paper which had been so uncourteously received. Her\ncompanion, with natural civility, anticipated her purpose; but, what\nwas not quite so much in etiquette, he took a sly glance at it as he was\nabout to hand it to her, and his eye having caught the subscription, he\nsaid, with surprise, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGlenvarloch--Nigel Olifaunt of Glenvarloch! Do you\nknow the Lord Glenvarloch, mistress?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know not of whom you speak,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Martha, peevishly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had that\npaper from one Master Nigel Gram.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNigel Grahame!--umph.-O, ay, very true--I had forgot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nScotsman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA tall, well-set young man, about my height; bright blue\neyes like a hawk's; a pleasant speech, something leaning to the kindly\nnorth-country accentuation, but not much, in respect of his having been\nresident abroad?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll this is true--and what of it all?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the daughter of the miser.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHair of my complexion?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYours is red,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI pray you peace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Scotsman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was going to say--of my\ncomplexion, but with a deeper shade of the chestnut. Weel, mistress, if\nI have guessed the man aright, he is one with whom I am, and have been,\nintimate and familiar,--nay,--I may truly say I have done him much\nservice in my time, and may live to do him more. I had indeed a sincere\ngood-will for him, and I doubt he has been much at a loss since we\nparted; but the fault is not mine. Wherefore, as this letter will not\navail you with him to whom it is directed, you may believe that heaven\nhath sent it to me, who have a special regard for the writer--I have,\nbesides, as much mercy and honesty within me as man can weel make his\nbread with, and am willing to aid any distressed creature, that is my\nfriend's friend, with my counsel, and otherwise, so that I am not put\nto much charges, being in a strange country, like a poor lamb that has\nwandered from its ain native hirsel, and leaves a tait of its woo' in\nevery d--d Southron bramble that comes across it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While he spoke thus,\nhe read the contents of the letter, without waiting for permission,\nand then continued,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd so this is all that you are wanting, my dove?\nnothing more than safe and honourable lodging, and sustenance, upon your\nown charges?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you are a man and a Christian, you will\nhelp me to what I need so much.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA man I am,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the formal Caledonian, \u00e2\u0080\u009ce'en sic as ye see me; and\na Christian I may call myself, though unworthy, and though I have\nheard little pure doctrine since I came hither--a' polluted with men's\ndevices--ahem! Weel, and if ye be an honest woman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d (here he peeped\nunder her muffler,) \u00e2\u0080\u009cas an honest woman ye seem likely to be--though,\nlet me tell you, they are a kind of cattle not so rife in the streets\nof this city as I would desire them--I was almost strangled with my own\nband by twa rampallians, wha wanted yestreen, nae farther gane, to harle\nme into a change-house--however, if ye be a decent honest woman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d (here\nhe took another peep at features certainly bearing no beauty which\ncould infer suspicion,) \u00e2\u0080\u009cas decent and honest ye seem to be, why, I\nwill advise you to a decent house, where you will get douce, quiet\nentertainment, on reasonable terms, and the occasional benefit of my\nown counsel and direction--that is, from time to time, as my other\navocations may permit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I venture to accept of such an offer from a stranger?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Martha,\nwith natural hesitation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTroth, I see nothing to hinder you, mistress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the bonny Scot;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cye can but see the place, and do after as ye think best. Besides, we\nare nae such strangers, neither; for I know your friend, and you,\nit's like, know mine, whilk knowledge, on either hand, is a medium of\ncommunication between us, even as the middle of the string connecteth\nits twa ends or extremities. But I will enlarge on this farther as we\npass along, gin ye list to bid your twa lazy loons of porters there lift\nup your little kist between them, whilk ae true Scotsman might carry\nunder his arm. Let me tell you, mistress, ye will soon make a toom\npock-end of it in Lon'on, if you hire twa knaves to do the work of ane.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he led the way, followed by Mistress Martha Trapbois, whose\nsingular destiny, though it had heaped her with wealth, had left her,\nfor the moment, no wiser counsellor, or more distinguished protector,\nthan honest Richie Moniplies, a discarded serving-man.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n\n  This way lie safety and a sure retreat;\n  Yonder lie danger, shame, and punishment\n  Most welcome danger then--Nay, let me say,\n  Though spoke with swelling heart--welcome e'en shame\n  And welcome punishment--for, call me guilty,\n  I do but pay the tax that's due to justice;\n  And call me guiltless, then that punishment\n  Is shame to those alone who do inflict it,\n                              _The Tribunal_.\n\nWe left Lord Glenvarloch, to whose fortunes our story chiefly attaches\nitself, gliding swiftly down the Thames. He was not, as the reader may\nhave observed, very affable in his disposition, or apt to enter into\nconversation with those into whose company he was casually thrown. This\nwas, indeed, an error in his conduct, arising less from pride, though\nof that feeling we do not pretend to exculpate him, than from a sort of\nbashful reluctance to mix in the conversation of those with whom he was\nnot familiar. It is a fault only to be cured by experience and knowledge\nof the world, which soon teaches every sensible and acute person the\nimportant lesson, that amusement, and, what is of more consequence,\nthat information and increase of knowledge, are to be derived from the\nconversation of every individual whatever, with whom he is thrown into\na natural train of communication. For ourselves, we can assure the\nreader--and perhaps if we have ever been able to afford him amusement,\nit is owing in a great degree to this cause--that we never found\nourselves in company with the stupidest of all possible companions in a\npost-chaise, or with the most arrant cumber-corner that ever occupied\na place in the mail-coach, without finding, that, in the course of our\nconversation with him, we had some ideas suggested to us, either grave\norgay, or some information communicated in the course of our journey,\nwhich we should have regretted not to have learned, and which we should\nbe sorry to have immediately forgotten. But Nigel was somewhat immured\nwithin the Bastile of his rank, as some philosopher (Tom Paine, we\nthink) has happily enough expressed that sort of shyness which men of\ndignified situations are apt to be beset with, rather from not exactly\nknowing how far, or with whom, they ought to be familiar, than from any\nreal touch of aristocratic pride. Besides, the immediate pressure of\nour adventurer's own affairs was such as exclusively to engross his\nattention.\n\nHe sat, therefore, wrapt in his cloak, in the stern of the boat, with\nhis mind entirely bent upon the probable issue of the interview with his\nSovereign, which it was his purpose to seek; for which abstraction of\nmind he may be fully justified, although perhaps, by questioning\nthe watermen who were transporting him down the river, he might have\ndiscovered matters of high concernment to him.\n\nAt any rate, Nigel remained silent till the wherry approached the\ntown of Greenwich, when he commanded the men to put in for the nearest\nlanding-place, as it was his purpose to go ashore there, and dismiss\nthem from further attendance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is not possible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the fellow with the green jacket, who, as\nwe have already said, seemed to take on himself the charge of pilotage.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must go,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto Gravesend, where a Scottish vessel,\nwhich dropped down the river last tide for the very purpose, lies\nwith her anchor a-peak, waiting to carry you to your own dear northern\ncountry. Your hammock is slung, and all is ready for you, and you talk\nof going ashore at Greenwich, as seriously as if such a thing were\npossible!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see no impossibility,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin your landing me where I desire\nto be landed; but very little possibility of your carrying me anywhere I\nam not desirous of going.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, whether do you manage the wherry, or we, master?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked\nGreen-jacket, in a tone betwixt jest and earnest; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI take it she will go\nthe way we row her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d retorted Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I take it you will row her on the course I\ndirect you, otherwise your chance of payment is but a poor one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSuppose we are content to risk that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the undaunted waterman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nwish to know how you, who talk so big--I mean no offence, master, but\nyou do talk big--would help yourself in such a case?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSimply thus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lord Glenvarloch--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou saw me, an hour since,\nbring down to the boat a trunk that neither of you could lift. If we are\nto contest the destination of our voyage, the same strength which\ntossed that chest into the wherry, will suffice to fling you out of it;\nwherefore, before we begin the scuffle, I pray you to remember, that,\nwhither I would go, there I will oblige you to carry me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGramercy for your kindness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Green-jacket; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand now mark me in\nreturn. My comrade and I are two men--and you, were you as stout as\nGeorge-a-Green, can pass but for one; and two, you will allow, are more\nthan a match for one. You mistake in your reckoning, my friend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is you who mistake,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Nigel, who began to grow warm; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is\nI who am three to two, sirrah--I carry two men's lives at my girdle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he opened his cloak and showed the two pistols which he had\ndisposed at his girdle. Green-jacket was unmoved at the display.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have got,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca pair of barkers that will match yours,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he\nshowed that he also was armed with pistols; \u00e2\u0080\u009cso you may begin as soon as\nyou list.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, drawing forth and cocking a pistol,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe sooner the better. Take notice, I hold you as a ruffian, who have\ndeclared you will put force on my person; and that I will shoot you\nthrough the head if you do not instantly put me ashore at Greenwich.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe other waterman, alarmed at Nigel's gesture, lay upon his oar; but\nGreen-jacket replied coolly--\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook you, master, I should not care a\ntester to venture a life with you on this matter; but the truth is, I am\nemployed to do you good, and not to do you harm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy whom are you employed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lord Glenvarloch; \u00e2\u0080\u009cor who dare\nconcern themselves in me, or my affairs, without my authority?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs to that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the waterman, in the same tone of indifference,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall not show my commission. For myself, I care not, as I said,\nwhether you land at Greenwich to get yourself hanged, or go down to get\naboard the Royal Thistle, to make your escape to your own country; you\nwill be equally out of my reach either way. But it is fair to put the\nchoice before you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy choice is made,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have told you thrice already it is\nmy pleasure to be landed at Greenwich.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWrite it on a piece of paper,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the waterman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat such is your\npositive will; I must have something to show to my employers, that the\ntransgression of their orders lies with yourself, not with me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI choose to hold this trinket in my hand for the present,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel,\nshowing his pistol, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand will write you the acquittance when I go\nashore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would not go ashore with you for a hundred pieces,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nwaterman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIll luck has ever attended you, except in small gaming; do me\nfair justice, and give me the testimony I desire. If you are afraid of\nfoul play while you write it, you may hold my pistols, if you will.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He\noffered the weapons to Nigel accordingly, who, while they were under\nhis control, and all possibility of his being taken at disadvantage was\nexcluded, no longer hesitated to give the waterman an acknowledgment, in\nthe following terms:--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJack in the Green, with his mate, belonging to the wherry called\nthe Jolly Raven, have done their duty faithfully by me, landing me\nat Greenwich by my express command; and being themselves willing and\ndesirous to carry me on board the Royal Thistle, presently lying at\nGravesend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Having finished this acknowledgment, which he signed\nwith the letters, N. O. G. as indicating his name and title, he again\nrequested to know of the waterman, to whom he delivered it, the name of\nhis employers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Jack in the Green, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have respected your secret, do not\nyou seek to pry into mine. It would do you no good to know for whom I\nam taking this present trouble; and, to be brief, you shall not know\nit--and, if you will fight in the quarrel, as you said even now, the\nsooner we begin the better. Only this you may be cock-sure of, that we\ndesigned you no harm, and that, if you fall into any, it will be of your\nown wilful seeking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As he spoke, they approached the landing-place,\nwhere Nigel instantly jumped ashore. The waterman placed his small\nmail-trunk on the stairs, observing that there were plenty of spare\nhands about, to carry it where he would.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe part friends, I hope, my lads,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young nobleman, offering at\nthe same time a piece of money more than double the usual fare, to the\nboatmen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe part as we met,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Green-jacket; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand, for your money, I am\npaid sufficiently with this bit of paper. Only, if you owe me any love\nfor the cast I have given you, I pray you not to dive so deep into the\npockets of the next apprentice that you find fool enough to play the\ncavalier.--And you, you greedy swine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he to his companion, who\nstill had a longing eye fixed on the money which Nigel continued to\noffer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cpush off, or, if I take a stretcher in hand, I'll break the\nknave's pate of thee.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The fellow pushed off, as he was commanded, but\nstill could not help muttering, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis was entirely out of waterman's\nrules.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGlenvarloch, though without the devotion of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cinjured Thales\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the\nmoralist, to the memory of that great princess, had now attained\n\n     \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe hallow'd soil which gave Eliza birth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nwhose halls were now less respectably occupied by her successor. It was\nnot, as has been well shown by a late author, that James was void either\nof parts or of good intentions; and his predecessor was at least as\narbitrary in effect as he was in theory. But, while Elizabeth possessed\na sternness of masculine sense and determination which rendered even her\nweaknesses, some of which were in themselves sufficiently ridiculous, in\na certain degree respectable, James, on the other hand, was so utterly\ndevoid of \u00e2\u0080\u009cfirm resolve,\u00e2\u0080\u009d so well called by the Scottish bard,\n\n     \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe stalk of carle-hemp in man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nthat even his virtues and his good meaning became laughable, from the\nwhimsical uncertainty of his conduct; so that the wisest things he ever\nsaid, and the best actions he ever did, were often touched with a strain\nof the ludicrous and fidgety character of the man. Accordingly, though\nat different periods of his reign he contrived to acquire with his\npeople a certain degree of temporary popularity, it never long outlived\nthe occasion which produced it; so true it is, that the mass of mankind\nwill respect a monarch stained with actual guilt, more than one whose\nfoibles render him only ridiculous.\n\nTo return from this digression, Lord Glenvarloch soon received, as\nGreen-jacket had assured him, the offer of an idle bargeman to transport\nhis baggage where he listed; but that where was a question of momentary\ndoubt. At length, recollecting the necessity that his hair and beard\nshould be properly arranged before he attempted to enter the royal\npresence, and desirous, at the same time, of obtaining some information\nof the motions of the Sovereign and of the Court, he desired to be\nguided to the next barber's shop, which we have already mentioned as\nthe place where news of every kind circled and centred. He was speedily\nshown the way to such an emporium of intelligence, and soon found he was\nlikely to hear all he desired to know, and much more, while his head was\nsubjected to the art of a nimble tonsor, the glibness of whose tongue\nkept pace with the nimbleness of his fingers while he ran on, without\nstint or stop, in the following excursive manner:--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Court here, master?--yes, master--much to the advantage of\ntrade--good custom stirring. His Majesty loves Greenwich--hunts every\nmorning in the Park--all decent persons admitted that have the entries\nof the Palace--no rabble--frightened the king's horse with their\nhallooing, the uncombed slaves.--Yes, sir, the beard more peaked?\nYes, master, so it is worn. I know the last cut--dress several of the\ncourtiers--one valet-of-the-chamber, two pages of the body, the clerk\nof the kitchen, three running footmen, two dog-boys, and an honourable\nScottish knight, Sir Munko Malgrowler.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMalagrowther, I suppose?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, thrusting in his conjectural\nemendation, with infinite difficulty, betwixt two clauses of the\nbarber's text.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir--Malcrowder, sir, as you say, sir--hard names the Scots have,\nsir, for an English mouth. Sir Munko is a handsome person, sir--perhaps\nyou know him--bating the loss of his fingers, and the lameness of his\nleg, and the length of his chin. Sir, it takes me one minute, twelve\nseconds, more time to trim that chin of his, than any chin that I know\nin the town of Greenwich, sir. But he is a very comely gentleman,\nfor all that; and a pleasant--a very pleasant gentleman, sir--and a\ngood-humoured, saving that he is so deaf he can never hear good of\nany one, and so wise, that he can never believe it; but he is a very\ngood-natured gentleman for all that, except when one speaks too low, or\nwhen a hair turns awry.--Did I graze you, sir? We shall put it to rights\nin a moment, with one drop of styptic--my styptic, or rather my wife's,\nsir--She makes the water herself. One drop of the styptic, sir, and a\nbit of black taffeta patch, just big enough to be the saddle to a flea,\nsir--Yes, sir, rather improves than otherwise. The Prince had a patch\nthe other day, and so had the Duke: and, if you will believe me, there\nare seventeen yards three quarters of black taffeta already cut into\npatches for the courtiers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut Sir Mungo Malagrowther?\u00e2\u0080\u009d again interjected Nigel, with difficulty.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, sir--Sir Munko, as you say; a pleasant, good-humoured gentleman\nas ever--To be spoken with, did you say? O ay, easily to be spoken\nwithal, that is, as easily as his infirmity will permit. He will\npresently, unless some one hath asked him forth to breakfast, be taking\nhis bone of broiled beef at my neighbour Ned Kilderkin's yonder,\nremoved from over the way. Ned keeps an eating-house, sir, famous for\npork-griskins; but Sir Munko cannot abide pork, no more than the\nKing's most Sacred Majesty,[Footnote: The Scots, till within the last\ngeneration, disliked swine's flesh as an article of food as much as the\nHighlanders do at present. It was remarked as extraordinary rapacity,\nwhen the Border depredators condescended to make prey of the accursed\nrace, whom the fiend made his habitation. Ben Jonson, in drawing James's\ncharacter, says, he loved \u00e2\u0080\u009cno part of a swine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d] nor my Lord Duke of\nLennox, nor Lord Dalgarno,--nay, I am sure, sir, if I touched you this\ntime, it was your fault, not mine.--But a single drop of the styptic,\nanother little patch that would make a doublet for a flea, just under\nthe left moustache; it will become you when you smile, sir, as well as\na dimple; and if you would salute your fair mistress--but I beg pardon,\nyou are a grave gentleman, very grave to be so young.--Hope I have given\nno offence; it is my duty to entertain customers--my duty, sir, and my\npleasure--Sir Munko Malcrowther?--yes, sir, I dare say he is at this\nmoment in Ned's eating-house, for few folks ask him out, now Lord\nHuntinglen is gone to London. You will get touched again--yes,\nsir--there you shall find him with his can of single ale, stirred with a\nsprig of rosemary, for he never drinks strong potations, sir, unless to\noblige Lord Huntinglen--take heed, sir--or any other person who asks him\nforth to breakfast--but single beer he always drinks at Ned's, with his\nbroiled bone of beef or mutton--or, it may be, lamb at the season--but\nnot pork, though Ned is famous for his griskins. But the Scots never eat\npork--strange that! some folk think they are a sort of Jews. There is a\nresemblance, sir,--Do you not think so? Then they call our most gracious\nSovereign the Second Solomon, and Solomon, you know, was King of the\nJews; so the thing bears a face, you see. I believe, sir, you will\nfind yourself trimmed now to your content. I will be judged by the fair\nmistress of your affections. Crave pardon--no offence, I trust. Pray,\nconsult the glass--one touch of the crisping tongs, to reduce this\nstraggler.--Thank your munificence, sir--hope your custom while you stay\nin Greenwich. Would you have a tune on that ghittern, to put your temper\nin concord for the day?--Twang, twang--twang, twang, dillo. Something\nout of tune, sir--too many hands to touch it--we cannot keep these\nthings like artists. Let me help you with your cloak, sir--yes,\nsir--You would not play yourself, sir, would you?--Way to Sir Munko's\neating-house?--Yes, sir; but it is Ned's eating-house, not Sir\nMunko's.--The knight, to be sure, eats there, and makes it his\neating-house in some sense, sir--ha, ha! Yonder it is, removed from over\nthe way, new white-washed posts, and red lattice--fat man in his doublet\nat the door--Ned himself, sir--worth a thousand pounds, they say--better\nsingeing pigs' faces than trimming courtiers--but ours is the less\nmechanical vocation.--Farewell, sir; hope your custom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he\nat length permitted Nigel to depart, whose ears, so long tormented with\ncontinued babble, tingled when it had ceased, as if a bell had been rung\nclose to them for the same space of time.\n\nUpon his arrival at the eating-house, where he proposed to meet with Sir\nMungo Malagrowther, from whom, in despair of better advice, he trusted\nto receive some information as to the best mode of introducing himself\ninto the royal presence, Lord Glenvarloch found, in the host with whom\nhe communed, the consequential taciturnity of an Englishman well to pass\nin the world. Ned Kilderkin spoke as a banker writes, only touching the\nneedful. Being asked if Sir Mungo Malagrowther was there? he replied,\nNo. Being interrogated whether he was expected? he said, Yes. And being\nagain required to say when he was expected, he answered, Presently.\nAs Lord Glenvarloch next inquired, whether he himself could have any\nbreakfast? the landlord wasted not even a syllable in reply, but,\nushering him into a neat room where there were several tables, he placed\none of them before an armchair, and beckoning Lord Glenvarloch to take\npossession, he set before him, in a very few minutes, a substantial\nrepast of roast-beef, together with a foaming tankard, to which\nrefreshment the keen air of the river disposed him, notwithstanding his\nmental embarrassments, to do much honour.\n\nWhile Nigel was thus engaged in discussing his commons, but raising his\nhead at the same time whenever he heard the door of the apartment open,\neagerly desiring the arrival of Sir Mungo Malagrowther, (an event which\nhad seldom been expected by any one with so much anxious interest,) a\npersonage, as it seemed, of at least equal importance with the knight,\nentered into the apartment, and began to hold earnest colloquy with\nthe publican, who thought proper to carry on the conference on his side\nunbonneted. This important gentleman's occupation might be guessed from\nhis dress. A milk-white jerkin, and hose of white kersey; a white apron\ntwisted around his body in the manner of a sash, in which, instead of a\nwar-like dagger, was stuck a long-bladed knife, hilted with buck's-horn;\na white nightcap on his head, under which his hair was neatly tucked,\nsufficiently pourtrayed him as one of those priests of Comus whom the\nvulgar call cooks; and the air with which he rated the publican for\nhaving neglected to send some provisions to the Palace, showed that he\nministered to royalty itself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis will never answer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster Kilderkin--the king twice\nasked for sweetbreads, and fricasseed coxcombs, which are a favourite\ndish of his most Sacred Majesty, and they were not to be had, because\nMaster Kilderkin had not supplied them to the clerk of the kitchen, as\nby bargain bound.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here Kilderkin made some apology, brief, according\nto his own nature, and muttered in a lowly tone after the fashion of all\nwho find themselves in a scrape. His superior replied, in a lofty\nstrain of voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not tell me of the carrier and his wain, and of the\nhen-coops coming from Norfolk with the poultry; a loyal man would have\nsent an express--he would have gone upon his stumps, like Widdrington.\nWhat if the king had lost his appetite, Master Kilderkin? What if his\nmost Sacred Majesty had lost his dinner? O, Master Kilderkin, if you had\nbut the just sense of the dignity of our profession, which is told of\nby the witty African slave, for so the king's most excellent Majesty\ndesignates him, Publius Terentius, _Tanguam in specula--in patinas\ninspicerejubeo_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are learned, Master Linklater,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the English publican,\ncompelling, as it were with difficulty, his mouth to utter three or four\nwords consecutively.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA poor smatterer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Linklater; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it would be a shame to us,\nwho are his most excellent Majesty's countrymen, not in some sort to\nhave cherished those arts wherewith he is so deeply embued--_Regis ad\nexemplar_, Master Kilderkin, _totus componitur orbis_--which is as\nmuch as to say, as the king quotes the cook learns. In brief, Master\nKilderkin, having had the luck to be bred where humanities may be had\nat the matter of an English five groats by the quarter, I, like others,\nhave acquired--ahem-hem!--\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here, the speaker's eye having fallen upon\nLord Glenvarloch, he suddenly stopped in his learned harangue, with\nsuch symptoms of embarrassment as induced Ned Kilderkin to stretch his\ntaciturnity so far as not only to ask him what he ailed, but whether he\nwould take any thing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAil nothing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the learned rival of the philosophical Syrus;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing--and yet I do feel a little giddy. I could taste a glass of\nyour dame's _aqua mirabilis_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will fetch it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ned, giving a nod; and his back was no sooner\nturned, than the cook walked near the table where Lord Glenvarloch was\nseated, and regarding him with a look of significance, where more was\nmeant than met the ear, said,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a stranger in Greenwich, sir.\nI advise you to take the opportunity to step into the Park--the western\nwicket was ajar when I came hither; I think it will be locked presently,\nso you had better make the best of your way--that is, if you have any\ncuriosity. The venison are coming into season just now, sir, and there\nis a pleasure in looking at a hart of grease. I always think when they\nare bounding so blithely past, what a pleasure it would be, to broach\ntheir plump haunches on a spit, and to embattle their breasts in a noble\nfortification of puff-paste, with plenty of black pepper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe said no more, as Kilderkin re-entered with the cordial, but edged off\nfrom Nigel without waiting any reply, only repeating the same look of\nintelligence with which he had accosted him.\n\nNothing makes men's wits so alert as personal danger. Nigel took the\nfirst opportunity which his host's attention to the yeoman of the royal\nkitchen permitted, to discharge his reckoning, and readily obtained a\ndirection to the wicket in question. He found it upon the latch, as\nhe had been taught to expect; and perceived that it admitted him to a\nnarrow footpath, which traversed a close and tangled thicket, designed\nfor the cover of the does and the young fawns. Here he conjectured it\nwould be proper to wait; nor had he been stationary above five minutes,\nwhen the cook, scalded as much with heat of motion as ever he had been\nby his huge fire-place, arrived almost breathless, and with his pass-key\nhastily locked the wicket behind him.\n\nEre Lord Glenvarloch had time to speculate upon this action, the man\napproached with anxiety, and said--\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood lord, my Lord Glenvarloch!--why\nwill you endanger yourself thus?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know me then, my friend?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot much of that, my lord--but I know your honour's noble house\nwell.--My name is Laurie Linklater, my lord.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLinklater!\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated Nigel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should recollect--'\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnder your lordship's favour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was 'prentice, my\nlord, to old Mungo Moniplies, the flesher at the wanton West-Port of\nEdinburgh, which I wish I saw again before I died. And, your honour's\nnoble father having taken Richie Moniplies into his house to wait on\nyour lordship, there was a sort of connexion, your lordship sees.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had almost forgot your name, but not\nyour kind purpose. You tried to put Richie in the way of presenting a\nsupplication to his Majesty?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMost true, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the king's cook. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had like to have come\nby mischief in the job; for Richie, who was always wilful, 'wadna be\nguided by me,' as the sang says. But nobody amongst these brave English\ncooks can kittle up his Majesty's most sacred palate with our own gusty\nScottish dishes. So I e'en betook myself to my craft, and concocted a\nmess of friar's chicken for the soup, and a savoury hachis, that made\nthe whole cabal coup the crans; and, instead of disgrace, I came\nby preferment. I am one of the clerks of the kitchen now, make me\nthankful--with a finger in the purveyor's office, and may get my whole\nhand in by and by.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am truly glad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto hear that you have not suffered on my\naccount,--still more so at your good fortune.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou bear a kind heart, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Linklater, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand do not forget\npoor people; and, troth, I see not why they should be forgotten, since\nthe king's errand may sometimes fall in the cadger's gate. I have\nfollowed your lordship in the street, just to look at such a stately\nshoot of the old oak-tree; and my heart jumped into my throat, when I\nsaw you sitting openly in the eating-house yonder, and knew there was\nsuch danger to your person.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! there are warrants against me, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is even true, my lord; and there are those who are willing to\nblacken you as much as they can.--God forgive them, that would sacrifice\nan honourable house for their own base ends!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAmen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor, say your lordship may have been a little wild, like other young\ngentlemen--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have little time to talk of it, my friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe point\nin question is, how am I to get speech of the king?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe king, my lord!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Linklater in astonishment; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy, will not that\nbe rushing wilfully into danger?--scalding yourself, as I may say, with\nyour own ladle?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy good friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy experience of the Court, and\nmy knowledge of the circumstances in which I stand, tell me, that the\nmanliest and most direct road is, in my case, the surest and the safest.\nThe king has both a head to apprehend what is just, and a heart to do\nwhat is kind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is e'en true, my lord, and so we, his old servants, know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added\nLinklater; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut, woe's me, if you knew how many folks make it their\ndaily and nightly purpose to set his head against his heart, and his\nheart against his head--to make him do hard things because they are\ncalled just, and unjust things because they are represented as kind.\nWoe's me! it is with his Sacred Majesty, and the favourites who work\nupon him, even according to the homely proverb that men taunt my calling\nwith,--'God sends good meat, but the devil sends cooks.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt signifies not talking of it, my good friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must\ntake my risk, my honour peremptorily demands it. They may maim me, or\nbeggar me, but they shall not say I fled from my accusers. My peers\nshall hear my vindication.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour peers?\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the cook--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlack-a-day, my lord, we are not in\nScotland, where the nobles can bang it out bravely, were it even\nwith the king himself, now and then. This mess must be cooked in the\nStar-Chamber, and that is an oven seven times heated, my lord;--and yet,\nif you are determined to see the king, I will not say but you may find\nsome favour, for he likes well any thing that is appealed directly to\nhis own wisdom, and sometimes, in the like cases, I have known him stick\nby his own opinion, which is always a fair one. Only mind, if you will\nforgive me, my lord--mind to spice high with Latin; a curn or two of\nGreek would not be amiss; and, if you can bring in any thing about the\njudgment of Solomon, in the original Hebrew, and season with a merry\njest or so, the dish will be the more palatable.--Truly, I think, that,\nbesides my skill in art, I owe much to the stripes of the Rector of\nthe High School, who imprinted on my mind that cooking scene in\nthe Heautontimorumenos.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLeaving that aside, my friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan you inform\nme which way I shall most readily get to the sight and speech of the\nking?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo the sight of him readily enough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Linklater; \u00e2\u0080\u009che is galloping\nabout these alleys, to see them strike the hart, to get him an appetite\nfor a nooning--and that reminds me I should be in the kitchen. To the\nspeech of the king you will not come so easily, unless you could either\nmeet him alone, which rarely chances, or wait for him among the\ncrowd that go to see him alight. And now, farewell, my lord, and God\nspeed!--if I could do more for you, I would offer it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have done enough, perhaps, to endanger yourself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord\nGlenvarloch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI pray you to be gone, and leave me to my fate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe honest cook lingered, but a nearer burst of the horns apprized him\nthat there was no time to lose; and, acquainting Nigel that he would\nleave the postern-door on the latch to secure his retreat in that\ndirection, he bade God bless him, and farewell.\n\nIn the kindness of this humble countryman, flowing partly from national\npartiality, partly from a sense of long-remembered benefits, which had\nbeen scarce thought on by those who had bestowed them, Lord Glenvarloch\nthought he saw the last touch of sympathy which he was to receive in\nthis cold and courtly region, and felt that he must now be sufficient to\nhimself, or be utterly lost.\n\nHe traversed more than one alley, guided by the sounds of the chase,\nand met several of the inferior attendants upon the king's sport, who\nregarded him only as one of the spectators who were sometimes permitted\nto enter the Park by the concurrence of the officers about the Court.\nStill there was no appearance of James, or any of his principal\ncourtiers, and Nigel began to think whether, at the risk of incurring\ndisgrace similar to that which had attended the rash exploit of Richie\nMoniplies, he should not repair to the Palace-gate, in order to address\nthe king on his return, when Fortune presented him the opportunity of\ndoing so, in her own way.\n\nHe was in one of those long walks by which the Park was traversed, when\nhe heard, first a distant rustling, then the rapid approach of hoofs\nshaking the firm earth on which he stood; then a distant halloo, warned\nby which he stood up by the side of the avenue, leaving free room for\nthe passage of the chase. The stag, reeling, covered with foam, and\nblackened with sweat, his nostrils extended as he gasped for breath,\nmade a shift to come up as far as where Nigel stood, and, without\nturning to bay, was there pulled down by two tall greyhounds of the\nbreed still used by the hardy deer-stalkers of the Scottish Highlands,\nbut which has been long unknown in England. One dog struck at the buck's\nthroat, another dashed his sharp nose and fangs, I might almost\nsay, into the animal's bowels. It would have been natural for Lord\nGlenvarloch, himself persecuted as if by hunters, to have thought upon\nthe occasion like the melancholy Jacques; but habit is a strange matter,\nand I fear that his feelings on the occasion were rather those of the\npractised huntsman than of the moralist. He had no time, however, to\nindulge them, for mark what befell.\n\nA single horseman followed the chase, upon a steed so thoroughly\nsubjected to the rein, that it obeyed the touch of the bridle as if\nit had been a mechanical impulse operating on the nicest piece of\nmachinery; so that, seated deep in his demipique saddle, and so trussed\nup there as to make falling almost impossible, the rider, without either\nfear or hesitation, might increase or diminish the speed at which he\nrode, which, even on the most animating occasions of the chase, seldom\nexceeded three-fourths of a gallop, the horse keeping his haunches\nunder him, and never stretching forward beyond the managed pace of\nthe academy. The security with which he chose to prosecute even this\nfavourite, and, in the ordinary case, somewhat dangerous amusement, as\nwell as the rest of his equipage, marked King James. No attendant was\nwithin sight; indeed, it was often a nice strain of flattery to permit\nthe Sovereign to suppose he had outridden and distanced all the rest of\nthe chase.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWeel dune, Bash--weel dune, Battie!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed as he came up. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy\nthe honour of a king, ye are a credit to the Braes of Balwhither!--Haud\nmy horse, man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he called out to Nigel, without stopping to see to whom\nhe had addressed himself--\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaud my naig, and help me doun out o' the\nsaddle--deil ding your saul, sirrah, canna ye mak haste before these\nlazy smaiks come up?--haud the rein easy--dinna let him swerve--now,\nhaud the stirrup--that will do, man, and now we are on terra firma.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n So saying, without casting an eye on his assistant, gentle King Jamie,\nunsheathing the short, sharp hanger, (_couteau de chasse_,) which was\nthe only thing approaching to a sword that he could willingly endure the\nsight of, drew the blade with great satisfaction across the throat of\nthe buck, and put an end at once to its struggles and its agonies.\n\nLord Glenvarloch, who knew well the silvan duty which the occasion\ndemanded, hung the bridle of the king's palfrey on the branch of a tree,\nand, kneeling duteously down, turned the slaughtered deer upon its back,\nand kept the _quarree_ in that position, while the king, too intent upon\nhis sport to observe any thing else, drew his _couteau_ down the breast\nof the animal, _secundum artem_; and, having made a cross cut, so as to\nascertain the depth of the fat upon the chest, exclaimed, in a sort of\nrapture, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThree inches of white fat on the brisket!--prime--prime--as\nI am a crowned sinner--and deil ane o' the lazy loons in but mysell!\nSeven--aught--aught tines on the antlers. By G--d, a hart of aught\ntines, and the first of the season! Bash and Battie, blessings on the\nheart's-root of ye! Buss me, my bairns, buss me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The dogs accordingly\nfawned upon him, licked him with bloody jaws, and soon put him in such\na state that it might have seemed treason had been doing its full work\nupon his anointed body. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBide doun, with a mischief to ye--bide doun,\nwith a wanion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the king, almost overturned by the obstreperous\ncaresses of the large stag-hounds. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut ye are just like ither folks,\ngie ye an inch and ye take an ell.--And wha may ye be, friend?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,\nnow finding leisure to take a nearer view of Nigel, and observing what\nin his first emotion of silvan delight had escaped him,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe are nane\nof our train, man. In the name of God, what the devil are ye?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAn unfortunate man, sire,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI dare say that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the king, snappishly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor I wad have seen\nnaething of you. My lieges keep a' their happiness to themselves; but\nlet bowls row wrang wi' them, and I am sure to hear of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd to whom else can we carry our complaints but to your Majesty, who\nis Heaven's vicegerent over us!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRight, man, right--very weel spoken,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut you should\nleave Heaven's vicegerent some quiet on earth, too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf your Majesty will look on me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d (for hitherto the king had been\nso busy, first with the dogs, and then with the mystic operation of\n_breaking_, in vulgar phrase, cutting up the deer, that he had scarce\ngiven his assistant above a transient glance,) \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou will see whom\nnecessity makes bold to avail himself of an opportunity which may never\nagain occur.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nKing James looked; his blood left his cheek, though it continued stained\nwith that of the animal which lay at his feet, he dropped the knife from\nhis hand, cast behind him a faltering eye, as if he either\nmeditated flight or looked out for assistance, and then\nexclaimed,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cGlenvarlochides! as sure as I was christened James Stewart.\nHere is a bonny spot of work, and me alone, and on foot too!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added,\nbustling to get upon his horse.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cForgive me that I interrupt you, my liege,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, placing himself\nbetween the king and his steed; \u00e2\u0080\u009chear me but a moment!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll hear ye best on horseback,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI canna hear a word\non foot, man, not a word; and it is not seemly to stand cheek-for-chowl\nconfronting us that gate. Bide out of our gate, sir, we charge you on\nyour allegiance.--The deil's in them a', what can they be doing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the crown that you wear, my liege,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand for which my\nancestors have worthily fought, I conjure you to be composed, and to\nhear me but a moment!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThat which he asked was entirely out of the monarch's power to grant.\nThe timidity which he showed was not the plain downright cowardice,\nwhich, like a natural impulse, compels a man to flight, and which can\nexcite little but pity or contempt, but a much more ludicrous, as well\nas more mingled sensation. The poor king was frightened at once and\nangry, desirous of securing his safety, and at the same time ashamed\nto compromise his dignity; so that without attending to what Lord\nGlenvarloch endeavoured to explain, he kept making at his horse, and\nrepeating, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are a free king, man,--we are a free king--we will not be\ncontrolled by a subject.--In the name of God, what keeps Steenie? And,\npraised be his name, they are coming--Hillo, ho--here, here--Steenie,\nSteenie!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Duke of Buckingham galloped up, followed by several courtiers\nand attendants of the royal chase, and commenced with his usual\nfamiliarity,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see Fortune has graced our dear dad, as usual.--But\nwhat's this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is it? It is treason for what I ken,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand a' your\nwyte, Steenie. Your dear dad and gossip might have been murdered, for\nwhat you care.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMurdered? Secure the villain!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the Duke. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy Heaven, it is\nOlifaunt himself!\u00e2\u0080\u009d A dozen of the hunters dismounted at once, letting\ntheir horses run wild through the park. Some seized roughly on Lord\nGlenvarloch, who thought it folly to offer resistance, while others\nbusied themselves with the king. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you wounded, my liege--are you\nwounded?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot that I ken of,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, in the paroxysm of his apprehension,\n(which, by the way, might be pardoned in one of so timorous a\ntemper, and who, in his time, had been exposed to so many strange\nattempts)--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot that I ken of--but search him--search him. I am sure I\nsaw fire-arms under his cloak. I am sure I smelled powder--I am dooms\nsure of that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLord Glenvarloch's cloak being stripped off, and his pistols discovered,\na shout of wonder and of execration on the supposed criminal purpose,\narose from the crowd now thickening every moment. Not that celebrated\npistol, which, though resting on a bosom as gallant and as loyal as\nNigel's, spread such cause less alarm among knights and dames at a late\nhigh solemnity--not that very pistol caused more temporary consternation\nthan was so groundlessly excited by the arms which were taken from Lord\nGlenvarloch's person; and not Mhic-Allastar-More himself could repel\nwith greater scorn and indignation, the insinuations that they were worn\nfor any sinister purposes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAway with the wretch--the parricide--the bloody-minded villain!\u00e2\u0080\u009d was\nechoed on all hands; and the king, who naturally enough set the same\nvalue on his own life, at which it was, or seemed to be, rated by\nothers, cried out, louder than all the rest, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay--away with him.\nI have had enough of him and so has the country. But do him no bodily\nharm--and, for God's sake, sirs, if ye are sure ye have thoroughly\ndisarmed him, put up your swords, dirks, and skenes, for you will\ncertainly do each other a mischief.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was a speedy sheathing of weapons at the king's command; for those\nwho had hitherto been brandishing them in loyal bravado, began thereby\nto call to mind the extreme dislike which his Majesty nourished against\nnaked steel, a foible which seemed to be as constitutional as his\ntimidity, and was usually ascribed to the brutal murder of Rizzio having\nbeen perpetrated in his unfortunate mother's presence before he yet saw\nthe light.\n\nAt this moment, the Prince, who had been hunting in a different part\nof the then extensive Park, and had received some hasty and confused\ninformation of what was going forward, came rapidly up, with one or two\nnoblemen in his train, and amongst others Lord Dalgarno. He sprung from\nhis horse and asked eagerly if his father were wounded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot that I am sensible of, Baby Charles--but a wee matter exhausted,\nwith struggling single-handed with the assassin.--Steenie, fill up a cup\nof wine--the leathern bottle is hanging at our pommel.--Buss me, then,\nBaby Charles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the monarch, after he had taken this cup of\ncomfort; \u00e2\u0080\u009cO man, the Commonwealth and you have had a fair escape from\nthe heavy and bloody loss of a dear father; for we are _pater patriae_,\nas weel as _pater familias_.-_Quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus tarn\ncari capitis!_-Woe is me, black cloth would have been dear in England,\nand dry een scarce!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd, at the very idea of the general grief which must have attended his\ndeath, the good-natured monarch cried heartily himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs this possible?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Charles, sternly; for his pride was hurt at\nhis father's demeanour on the one hand, while on the other, he felt the\nresentment of a son and a subject, at the supposed attempt on the\nking's life. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet some one speak who has seen what happened--My Lord of\nBuckingham!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot say my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Duke, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I saw any actual\nviolence offered to his Majesty, else I should have avenged him on the\nspot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou would have done wrong, then, in your zeal, George,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the\nPrince; \u00e2\u0080\u009csuch offenders were better left to be dealt with by the laws.\nBut was the villain not struggling with his Majesty?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot term it so, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Duke, who, with many faults,\nwould have disdained an untruth; \u00e2\u0080\u009che seemed to desire to detain his\nMajesty, who, on the contrary, appeared to wish to mount his horse; but\nthey have found pistols on his person, contrary to the proclamation,\nand, as it proves to be by Nigel Olifaunt, of whose ungoverned\ndisposition your Royal Highness has seen some samples, we seem to be\njustified in apprehending the worst.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNigel Olifaunt!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Prince; \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan that unhappy man so soon have\nengaged in a new trespass? Let me see those pistols.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe are not so unwise as to meddle with such snap-haunces, Baby\nCharles?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said James--\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not give him them, Steenie--I command you\non your allegiance! They may go off of their own accord, whilk often\nbefalls.--You will do it, then?--Saw ever a man sic wilful bairns as we\nare cumbered with!--Havena we guardsmen and soldiers enow, but you must\nunload the weapons yoursell--you, the heir of our body and dignities,\nand sae mony men around that are paid for venturing life in our cause?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut without regarding his father's exclamations, Prince Charles, with\nthe obstinacy which characterised him in trifles, as well as matters of\nconsequence, persisted in unloading the pistols with his own hand, of\nthe double bullets with which each was charged. The hands of all around\nwere held up in astonishment at the horror of the crime supposed to have\nbeen intended, and the escape which was presumed so narrow.\n\nNigel had not yet spoken a word--he now calmly desired to be heard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo what purpose?\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Prince coldly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou knew yourself\naccused of a heavy offence, and, instead of rendering yourself up to\njustice, in terms of the proclamation, you are here found intruding\nyourself on his Majesty's presence, and armed with unlawful weapons.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay it please you, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wore these unhappy weapons\nfor my own defence; and not very many hours since they were necessary to\nprotect the lives of others.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoubtless, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Prince, still calm and\nunmoved,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cyour late mode of life, and the associates with whom you have\nlived, have made you familiar with scenes and weapons of violence. But\nit is not to me you are to plead your cause.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHear me--hear me, noble Prince!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, eagerly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHear me!\nYou--even you yourself--may one day ask to be heard, and in vain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Prince, haughtily--\u00e2\u0080\u009chow am I to construe that, my\nlord?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf not on earth, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the prisoner, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyet to Heaven we must all\npray for patient and favourable audience.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Prince, bending his head with haughty\nacquiescence; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnor would I now refuse such audience to you, could it\navail you. But you shall suffer no wrong. We will ourselves look into\nyour case.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the king, \u00e2\u0080\u009che hath made _appellatio ad Casarem_--we\nwill interrogate Glenvarlochides ourselves, time and place fitting; and,\nin the meanwhile, have him and his weapons away, for I am weary of the\nsight of them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn consequence of directions hastily given, Nigel was accordingly\nremoved from the presence, where, however, his words had not altogether\nfallen to the ground. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a most strange matter, George,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nthe Prince to the favourite; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis gentleman hath a good countenance, a\nhappy presence, and much calm firmness in his look and speech. I cannot\nthink he would attempt a crime so desperate and useless.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI profess neither love nor favour to the young man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered\nBuckingham, whose high-spirited ambition bore always an open character:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I cannot but agree with your Highness, that our dear gossip hath\nbeen something hasty in apprehending personal danger from him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my saul, Steenie, ye are not blate, to say so!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo I\nnot ken the smell of pouther, think ye? Who else nosed out the Fifth of\nNovember, save our royal selves? Cecil, and Suffolk, and all of them,\nwere at fault, like sae mony mongrel tikes, when I puzzled it out:\nand trow ye that I cannot smell pouther? Why, 'sblood, man, Joannes\nBarclaius thought my ingine was in some measure inspiration, and terms\nhis history of the plot, Series patefacti divinitus parricidii; and\nSpondanus, in like manner, saith of us, Divinitus evasit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe land was happy in your Majesty's escape,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Duke of\nBuckingham, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand not less in the quick wit which tracked that labyrinth\nof treason by so fine and almost invisible a clew.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSaul, man, Steenie, ye are right! There are few youths have sic true\njudgment as you, respecting the wisdom of their elders; and, as for this\nfause, traitorous smaik, I doubt he is a hawk of the same nest. Saw ye\nnot something papistical about him? Let them look that he bears not a\ncrucifix, or some sic Roman trinket, about him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would ill become me to attempt the exculpation of this unhappy man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said Lord Dalgarno, \u00e2\u0080\u009cconsidering the height of his present attempt,\nwhich has made all true men's blood curdle in their veins. Yet I cannot\navoid intimating, with all due submission to his Majesty's infallible\njudgment, in justice to one who showed himself formerly only my enemy,\nthough he now displays himself in much blacker colours, that this\nOlifaunt always appeared to me more as a Puritan than as a Papist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, Dalgarno, art thou there, man?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd ye behoved to\nkeep back, too, and leave us to our own natural strength and the care of\nProvidence, when we were in grips with the villain!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cProvidence, may it please your most Gracious Majesty, would not fail\nto aid, in such a strait, the care of three weeping kingdoms,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord\nDalgarno.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSurely, man--surely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the king--\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut a sight of your father,\nwith his long whinyard, would have been a blithe matter a short while\nsyne; and in future we will aid the ends of Providence in our favour,\nby keeping near us two stout beef-eaters of the guard.--And so this\nOlifaunt is a Puritan?--not the less like to be a Papist, for all\nthat--for extremities meet, as the scholiast proveth. There are, as I\nhave proved in my book, Puritans of papistical principles--it is just a\nnew tout on an old horn.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere the king was reminded by the Prince, who dreaded perhaps that he\nwas going to recite the whole Basilicon Doron, that it would be best to\nmove towards the Palace, and consider what was to be done for satisfying\nthe public mind, in whom the morning's adventure was likely to excite\nmuch speculation. As they entered the gate of the Palace, a female bowed\nand presented a paper, which the king received, and, with a sort\nof groan, thrust it into his side pocket. The Prince expressed some\ncuriosity to know its contents. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe valet in waiting will tell you\nthem,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen I strip off my cassock. D'ye think, Baby,\nthat I can read all that is thrust into my hands? See to me, man\u00e2\u0080\u009d--(he\npointed to the pockets of his great trunk breeches, which were stuffed\nwith papers)--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are like an ass--that we should so speak--stooping\nbetwixt two burdens. Ay, ay, Asinus fortis accumbens inter terminos, as\nthe Vulgate hath it--Ay, ay, Vidi terrain quod esset optima, et supposui\nhumerum ad portandum, et factus sum tributis serviens--I saw this land\nof England, and became an overburdened king thereof.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are indeed well loaded, my dear dad and gossip,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Duke of\nBuckingham, receiving the papers which King James emptied out of his\npockets.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the monarch; \u00e2\u0080\u009ctake them to you per aversionem,\nbairns--the one pouch stuffed with petitions, t'other with pasquinadoes;\na fine time we have on't. On my conscience, I believe the tale of Cadmus\nwas hieroglyphical, and that the dragon's teeth whilk he sowed were\nthe letters he invented. Ye are laughing, Baby Charles?--Mind what I\nsay.--When I came here first frae our ain country, where the men are\nas rude as the weather, by my conscience, England was a bieldy bit;\none would have thought the king had little to do but to walk by quiet\nwaters, per aquam refectionis. But, I kenna how or why, the place is\nsair changed--read that libel upon us and on our regimen. The dragon's\nteeth are sown, Baby Charles; I pray God they bearna their armed harvest\nin your day, if I suld not live to see it. God forbid I should, for\nthere will be an awful day's kemping at the shearing of them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall know how to stifle the crop in the blade,--ha, George?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nthe Prince, turning to the favourite with a look expressive of some\ncontempt for his father's apprehensions, and full of confidence in the\nsuperior firmness and decision of his own counsels.\n\nWhile this discourse was passing, Nigel, in charge of a\npursuivant-at-arms, was pushed and dragged through the small town, all\nthe inhabitants of which, having been alarmed by the report of an attack\non the king's life, now pressed forward to see the supposed traitor.\nAmid the confusion of the moment, he could descry the face of the\nvictualler, arrested into a stare of stolid wonder, and that of the\nbarber grinning betwixt horror and eager curiosity. He thought that he\nalso had a glimpse of his waterman in the green jacket.\n\nHe had no time for remarks, being placed in a boat with the pursuivant\nand two yeomen of the guard, and rowed up the river as fast as the\narms of six stout watermen could pull against the tide. They passed\nthe groves of masts which even then astonished the stranger with the\nextended commerce of London, and now approached those low and blackened\nwalls of curtain and bastion, which exhibit here and there a piece of\nordnance, and here and there a solitary sentinel under arms, but have\notherwise so little of the military terrors of a citadel. A projecting\nlow-browed arch, which had loured over many an innocent, and many a\nguilty head, in similar circumstances, now spread its dark frowns over\nthat of Nigel. The boat was put close up to the broad steps against\nwhich the tide was lapping its lazy wave. The warder on duty looked from\nthe wicket, and spoke to the pursuivant in whispers. In a few minutes\nthe Lieutenant of the Tower appeared, received, and granted an\nacknowledgment for the body of Nigel, Lord Glenvarloch.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n\n  Ye towers of Julius! London's lasting shame;\n  With many a foul and midnight murder fed!\n                           _Gray._\n\nSuch is the exclamation of Gray. Bandello, long before him, has said\nsomething like it; and the same sentiment must, in some shape or other,\nhave frequently occurred to those, who, remembering the fate of other\ncaptives in that memorable state-prison, may have had but too much\nreason to anticipate their own. The dark and low arch, which seemed,\nlike the entrance to Dante's Hell, to forbid hope of regress--the\nmuttered sounds of the warders, and petty formalities observed in\nopening and shutting the grated wicket--the cold and constrained\nsalutation of the Lieutenant of the fortress, who showed his prisoner\nthat distant and measured respect which authority pays as a tax to\ndecorum, all struck upon Nigel's heart, impressing on him the cruel\nconsciousness of captivity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a prisoner,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, the words escaping from him almost unawares;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a prisoner, and in the Tower!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Lieutenant bowed--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd it is my duty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto show your\nlordship your chamber, where, I am compelled to say, my orders are\nto place you under some restraint. I will make it as easy as my duty\npermits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNigel only bowed in return to this compliment, and followed the\nLieutenant to the ancient buildings on the western side of the parade,\nand adjoining to the chapel, used in those days as a state-prison, but\nin ours as the mess-room of the officers of the guard upon duty at the\nfortress. The double doors were unlocked, the prisoner ascended a few\nsteps, followed by the Lieutenant, and a warder of the higher class.\nThey entered a large, but irregular, low-roofed, and dark apartment,\nexhibiting a very scanty proportion of furniture. The warder had orders\nto light a fire, and attend to Lord Glenvarloch's commands in all things\nconsistent with his duty; and the Lieutenant, having made his reverence\nwith the customary compliment, that he trusted his lordship would not\nlong remain under his guardianship, took his leave.\n\nNigel would have asked some questions of the warder, who remained to\nput the apartment into order, but the man had caught the spirit of his\noffice. He seemed not to hear some of the prisoner's questions, though\nof the most ordinary kind, did not reply to others, and when he did\nspeak, it was in a short and sullen tone, which, though not\npositively disrespectful, was such as at least to encourage no farther\ncommunication.\n\nNigel left him, therefore, to do his work in silence, and proceeded\nto amuse himself with the melancholy task of deciphering the names,\nmottoes, verses, and hieroglyphics, with which his predecessors in\ncaptivity had covered the walls of their prison-house. There he saw\nthe names of many a forgotten sufferer mingled with others which will\ncontinue in remembrance until English history shall perish. There were\nthe pious effusions of the devout Catholic, poured forth on the eve of\nhis sealing his profession at Tyburn, mingled with those of the firm\nProtestant, about to feed the fires of Smithfield. There the slender\nhand of the unfortunate Jane Grey, whose fate was to draw tears from\nfuture generations, might be contrasted with the bolder touch which\nimpressed deep on the walls the Bear and Ragged Staff, the proud emblem\nof the proud Dudleys. It was like the roll of the prophet, a record of\nlamentation and mourning, and yet not unmixed with brief\ninterjections of resignation, and sentences expressive of the firmest\nresolution.[Footnote: These memorials of illustrious criminals, or of\ninnocent persons who had the fate of such, are still preserved, though\nat one time, in the course of repairing the rooms, they were in some\ndanger of being whitewashed. They are preserved at present with becoming\nrespect, and have most of them been engraved.--_See_ BAYLEY'S _History\nand Antiquities of the Tower of London._]\n\nIn the sad task of examining the miseries of his predecessors in\ncaptivity, Lord Glenvarloch was interrupted by the sudden opening of\nthe door of his prison-room. It was the warder, who came to inform him,\nthat, by order of the Lieutenant of the Tower, his lordship was to\nhave the society and attendance of a fellow-prisoner in his place of\nconfinement. Nigel replied hastily, that he wished no attendance, and\nwould rather be left alone; but the warder gave him to understand, with\na kind of grumbling civility, that the Lieutenant was the best judge how\nhis prisoners should be accommodated, and that he would have no trouble\nwith the boy, who was such a slip of a thing as was scarce worth turning\na key upon.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere, Giles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbring the child in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnother warder put the \u00e2\u0080\u009clad before him\u00e2\u0080\u009d into the room, and, both\nwithdrawing, bolt crashed and chain clanged, as they replaced these\nponderous obstacles to freedom. The boy was clad in a grey suit of the\nfinest cloth, laid down with silver lace, with a buff-coloured cloak\nof the same pattern. His cap, which was a Montero of black velvet, was\npulled over his brows, and, with the profusion of his long ringlets,\nalmost concealed his face. He stood on the very spot where the warder\nhad quitted his collar, about two steps from the door of the apartment,\nhis eyes fixed on the ground, and every joint trembling with confusion\nand terror. Nigel could well have dispensed with his society, but it was\nnot in his nature to behold distress, whether of body or mind, without\nendeavouring to relieve it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCheer up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy pretty lad. We are to be companions, it seems,\nfor a little time--at least I trust your confinement will be short,\nsince you are too young to have done aught to deserve long restraint.\nCome, come--do not be discouraged. Your hand is cold and trembles? the\nair is warm too--but it may be the damp of this darksome room. Place you\nby the fire.--What! weeping-ripe, my little man? I pray you, do not be\na child. You have no beard yet, to be dishonoured by your tears, but yet\nyou should not cry like a girl. Think you are only shut up for playing\ntruant, and you can pass a day without weeping, surely.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe boy suffered himself to be led and seated by the fire, but, after\nretaining for a long time the very posture which he assumed in sitting\ndown, he suddenly changed it in order to wring his hands with an air of\nthe bitterest distress, and then, spreading them before his face, wept\nso plentifully, that the tears found their way in floods through his\nslender fingers.\n\nNigel was in some degree rendered insensible to his own situation, by\nhis feelings for the intense agony by which so young and beautiful\na creature seemed to be utterly overwhelmed; and, sitting down close\nbeside the boy, he applied the most soothing terms which occurred,\nto endeavour to alleviate his distress; and, with an action which the\ndifference of their age rendered natural, drew his hand kindly along the\nlong hair of the disconsolate child. The lad appeared so shy as even\nto shrink from this slight approach to familiarity--yet, when Lord\nGlenvarloch, perceiving and allowing for his timidity, sat down on the\nfarther side of the fire, he appeared to be more at his ease, and to\nhearken with some apparent interest to the arguments which from time to\ntime Nigel used, to induce him to moderate, at least, the violence of\nhis grief. As the boy listened, his tears, though they continued to flow\nfreely, seemed to escape from their source more easily, his sobs were\nless convulsive, and became gradually changed into low sighs, which\nsucceeded each other, indicating as much sorrow, perhaps, but less\nalarm, than his first transports had shown.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell me who and what you are, my pretty boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cConsider\nme, child, as a companion, who wishes to be kind to you, would you but\nteach him how he can be so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir--my lord, I mean,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the boy, very timidly, and in a voice\nwhich could scarce be heard even across the brief distance which divided\nthem, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are very good--and I--am very unhappy--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA second fit of tears interrupted what else he had intended to say, and\nit required a renewal of Lord Glenvarloch's good-natured expostulations\nand encouragements, to bring him once more to such composure as rendered\nthe lad capable of expressing himself intelligibly. At length, however,\nhe was able to say--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sensible of your goodness, my lord--and\ngrateful for it--but I am a poor unhappy creature, and, what is worse,\nhave myself only to thank for my misfortunes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are seldom absolutely miserable, my young acquaintance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwithout being ourselves more or less responsible for it--I may well say\nso, otherwise I had not been here to-day--but you are very young, and\ncan have but little to answer for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO sir! I wish I could say so--I have been self-willed and\nobstinate--and rash and ungovernable--and now--now, how dearly do I pay\nthe price of it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPshaw, my boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis must be some childish frolic--some\nbreaking out of bounds--some truant trick--And yet how should any of\nthese have brought you to the Tower?--There is something mysterious\nabout you, young man, which I must inquire into.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed, indeed, my lord, there is no harm about me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the boy, more\nmoved it would seem to confession by the last words, by which he seemed\nconsiderably alarmed, than by all the kind expostulations and arguments\nwhich Nigel had previously used. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am innocent--that is, I have done\nwrong, but nothing to deserve being in this frightful place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell me the truth, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, in a tone in which command\nmingled with encouragement; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have nothing to fear from me, and as\nlittle to hope, perhaps--yet, placed as I am, I would know with whom I\nspeak.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith an unhappy--boy, sir--and idle and truantly disposed, as your\nlordship said,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the lad, looking up, and showing a countenance\nin which paleness and blushes succeeded each other, as fear and\nshamefacedness alternately had influence. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI left my father's house\nwithout leave, to see the king hunt in the Park at Greenwich; there came\na cry of treason, and all the gates were shut--I was frightened, and\nhid myself in a thicket, and I was found by some of the rangers and\nexamined--and they said I gave no good account of myself--and so I was\nsent hither.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am an unhappy, a most unhappy being,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, rising\nand walking through the apartment; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnothing approaches me but shares my\nown bad fate! Death and imprisonment dog my steps, and involve all who\nare found near me. Yet this boy's story sounds strangely.--You say you\nwere examined, my young friend--Let me pray you to say whether you told\nyour name, and your means of gaining admission into the Park--if so,\nthey surely would not have detained you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the boy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI took care not to tell them the name of\nthe friend that let me in; and as to my father--I would not he knew\nwhere I now am for all the wealth in London!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut do you not expect,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat they will dismiss you till\nyou let them know who and what you are?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat good will it do them to keep so useless a creature as myself?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said the boy; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey must let me go, were it but out of shame.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not trust to that--tell me your name and station--I will communicate\nthem to the Lieutenant--he is a man of quality and honour, and will not\nonly be willing to procure your liberation, but also, I have no doubt,\nwill intercede with your father. I am partly answerable for such poor\naid as I can afford, to get you out of this embarrassment, since I\noccasioned the alarm owing to which you were arrested; so tell me your\nname, and your father's name.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy name to you? O never, never!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the boy, in a tone of deep\nemotion, the cause of which Nigel could not comprehend.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you so much afraid of me, young man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause I am\nhere accused and a prisoner? Consider, a man may be both, and deserve\nneither suspicion nor restraint. Why should you distrust me? You seem\nfriendless, and I am myself so much in the same circumstances, that I\ncannot but pity your situation when I reflect on my own. Be wise; I have\nspoken kindly to you--I mean as kindly as I speak.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, I doubt it not, I doubt it not, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the boy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I could\ntell you all--that is, almost all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell me nothing, my young friend, excepting what may assist me in being\nuseful to you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are generous, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the boy; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I am sure--O sure,\nI might safely trust to your honour--But yet--but yet--I am so sore\nbeset--I have been so rash, so unguarded--I can never tell you of\nmy folly. Besides, I have already told too much to one whose heart I\nthought I had moved--yet I find myself here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo whom did you make this disclosure?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI dare not tell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the youth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is something singular about you, my young friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord\nGlenvarloch, withdrawing with a gentle degree of compulsion the hand\nwith which the boy had again covered his eyes; \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo not pain yourself\nwith thinking on your situation just at present--your pulse is high, and\nyour hand feverish--lay yourself on yonder pallet, and try to compose\nyourself to sleep. It is the readiest and best remedy for the fancies\nwith which you are worrying yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thank you for your considerate kindness, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the boy;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwith your leave I will remain for a little space quiet in this chair--I\nam better thus than on the couch. I can think undisturbedly on what I\nhave done, and have still to do; and if God sends slumber to a creature\nso exhausted, it shall be most welcome.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, the boy drew his hand from Lord Nigel's, and, drawing around\nhim and partly over his face the folds of his ample cloak, he resigned\nhimself to sleep or meditation, while his companion, notwithstanding the\nexhausting scenes of this and the preceding day, continued his pensive\nwalk up and down the apartment.\n\nEvery reader has experienced, that times occur, when far from being lord\nof external circumstances, man is unable to rule even the wayward realm\nof his own thoughts. It was Nigel's natural wish to consider his own\nsituation coolly, and fix on the course which it became him as a man\nof sense and courage to adopt; and yet, in spite of himself, and\nnotwithstanding the deep interest of the critical state in which he was\nplaced, it did so happen that his fellow-prisoner's situation occupied\nmore of his thoughts than did his own. There was no accounting for this\nwandering of the imagination, but also there was no striving with it.\nThe pleading tones of one of the sweetest voices he had ever heard,\nstill rung in his ear, though it seemed that sleep had now fettered the\ntongue of the speaker. He drew near on tiptoe to satisfy himself whether\nit were so. The folds of the cloak hid the lower part of his face\nentirely; but the bonnet, which had fallen a little aside, permitted him\nto see the forehead streaked with blue veins, the closed eyes, and the\nlong silken eyelashes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPoor child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel to himself, as he looked on him, nestled up as\nit were in the folds of his mantle, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe dew is yet on thy eyelashes,\nand thou hast fairly wept thyself asleep. Sorrow is a rough nurse to one\nso young and delicate as thou art. Peace be to thy slumbers, I will\nnot disturb them. My own misfortunes require my attention, and it is to\ntheir contemplation that I must resign myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe attempted to do so, but was crossed at every turn by conjectures\nwhich intruded themselves as before, and which all regarded the sleeper\nrather than himself. He was angry and vexed, and expostulated with\nhimself concerning the overweening interest which he took in the\nconcerns of one of whom he knew nothing, saving that the boy was forced\ninto his company, perhaps as a spy, by those to whose custody he was\ncommitted--but the spell could not be broken, and the thoughts which he\nstruggled to dismiss, continued to haunt him.\n\nThus passed half an hour, or more; at the conclusion of which, the\nharsh sound of the revolving bolts was again heard, and the voice of the\nwarder announced that a man desired to speak with Lord Glenvarloch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA\nman to speak with me, under my present circumstances!--Who can it be?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n And John Christie, his landlord of Paul's Wharf, resolved his doubts, by\nentering the apartment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWelcome--most welcome, mine honest landlord!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said Lord Glenvarloch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow could I have dreamt of seeing you in my\npresent close lodgings?\u00e2\u0080\u009d And at the same time, with the frankness of\nold kindness, he walked up to Christie and offered his hand; but John\nstarted back as from the look of a basilisk.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKeep your courtesies to yourself, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, gruffly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have\nhad as many of them already as may serve me for my life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Master Christie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat means this? I trust I have not\noffended you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAsk me no questions, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Christie, bluntly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a man of\npeace--I came not hither to wrangle with you at this place and season.\nJust suppose that I am well informed of all the obligements from your\nhonour's nobleness, and then acquaint me, in as few words as may be,\nwhere is the unhappy woman--What have you done with her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat have I done with her!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch--\u00e2\u0080\u009cDone with whom? I\nknow not what you are speaking of.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Christie; \u00e2\u0080\u009cplay surprise as well as you will,\nyou must have some guess that I am speaking of the poor fool that was my\nwife, till she became your lordship's light-o'-love.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour wife! Has your wife left you? and, if she has, do you come to ask\nher of me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, my lord, singular as it may seem,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned Christie, in a tone\nof bitter irony, and with a sort of grin widely discording from the\ndiscomposure of his features, the gleam of his eye, and the froth which\nstood on his lip, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do come to make that demand of your lordship.\nDoubtless, you are surprised I should take the trouble; but, I cannot\ntell, great men and little men think differently. She has lain in\nmy bosom, and drunk of my cup; and, such as she is, I cannot forget\nthat--though I will never see her again--she must not starve, my lord,\nor do worse, to gain bread, though I reckon your lordship may think I am\nrobbing the public in trying to change her courses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my faith as a Christian, by my honour as a gentleman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord\nGlenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif aught amiss has chanced with your wife, I know nothing\nof it. I trust in Heaven you are as much mistaken in imputing guilt to\nher, as in supposing me her partner in it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFie! fie! my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Christie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy will you make it so tough? She\nis but the wife of a clod-pated old chandler, who was idiot enough to\nmarry a wench twenty years younger than himself. Your lordship cannot\nhave more glory by it than you have had already; and, as for\nadvantage and solace, I take it Dame Nelly is now unnecessary to\nyour gratification. I should be sorry to interrupt the course of your\npleasure; an old wittol should have more consideration of his condition.\nBut, your precious lordship being mewed up here among other choice\njewels of the kingdom, Dame Nelly cannot, I take it, be admitted\nto share the hours of dalliance which\u00e2\u0080\u009d--Here the incensed husband\nstammered, broke off his tone of irony, and proceeded, striking his\nstaff against the ground--\u00e2\u0080\u009cO that these false limbs of yours, which I\nwish had been hamstrung when they first crossed my honest threshold,\nwere free from the fetters they have well deserved! I would give you the\nodds of your youth, and your weapon, and would bequeath my soul to\nthe foul fiend if I, with this piece of oak, did not make you such an\nexample to all ungrateful, pick-thank courtiers, that it should be a\nproverb to the end of time, how John Christie swaddled his wife's fine\nleman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand not your insolence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I forgive it,\nbecause you labour under some strange delusion. In so far as I can\ncomprehend your vehement charge, it is entirely undeserved on my part.\nYou seem to impute to me the seduction of your wife--I trust she is\ninnocent. For me, at least, she is as innocent as an angel in bliss.\nI never thought of her--never touched her hand or cheek, save in\nhonourable courtesy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, ay--courtesy!--that is the very word. She always praised your\nlordship's honourable courtesy. Ye have cozened me between ye, with your\ncourtesy. My lord--my lord, you came to us no very wealthy man--you know\nit. It was for no lucre of gain I took you and your swash-buckler, your\nDon Diego yonder, under my poor roof. I never cared if the little room\nwere let or no; I could live without it. If you could not have paid for\nit, you should never have been asked. All the wharf knows John Christie\nhas the means and spirit to do a kindness. When you first darkened my\nhonest doorway, I was as happy as a man need to be, who is no youngster,\nand has the rheumatism. Nelly was the kindest and best-humoured\nwench--we might have a word now and then about a gown or a ribbon, but\na kinder soul on the whole, and a more careful, considering her years,\ntill you come--and what is she now!--But I will not be a fool to cry, if\nI can help it. _What_ she is, is not the question, but where she is; and\nthat I must learn, sir, of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can you, when I tell you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I am as ignorant as\nyourself, or rather much more so? Till this moment, I never heard of any\ndisagreement betwixt your dame and you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is a lie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said John Christie, bluntly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow, you base villain!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch--\u00e2\u0080\u009cdo you presume on my\nsituation? If it were not that I hold you mad, and perhaps made so\nby some wrong sustained, you should find my being weaponless were no\nprotection, I would beat your brains out against the wall.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Christie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbully as ye list. Ye have been at the\nordinaries, and in Alsatia, and learned the ruffian's rant, I doubt not.\nBut I repeat, you have spoken an untruth, when you said you knew not of\nmy wife's falsehood; for, when you were twitted with it among your gay\nmates, it was a common jest among you, and your lordship took all the\ncredit they would give you for your gallantry and gratitude.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was a mixture of truth in this part of the charge which\ndisconcerted Lord Glenvarloch exceedingly; for he could not, as a man\nof honour, deny that Lord Dalgarno, and others, had occasionally jested\nwith him on the subject of Dame Nelly, and that, though he had not\nplayed exactly _le fanfaron des vices qu'il n'avoit pas_, he had not\nat least been sufficiently anxious to clear himself of the suspicion of\nsuch a crime to men who considered it as a merit. It was therefore with\nsome hesitation, and in a sort of qualifying tone, that he admitted that\nsome idle jests had passed upon such a supposition, although without\nthe least foundation in truth. John Christie would not listen to his\nvindication any longer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy your own account,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou permitted\nlies to be told of you injest. How do I know you are speaking truth,\nnow you are serious? You thought it, I suppose, a fine thing to wear the\nreputation of having dishonoured an honest family,--who will not think\nthat you had real grounds for your base bravado to rest upon? I will not\nbelieve otherwise for one, and therefore, my lord, mark what I have to\nsay. You are now yourself in trouble--As you hope to come through\nit safely, and without loss of life and property, tell me where this\nunhappy woman is. Tell me, if you hope for heaven--tell me, if you fear\nhell--tell me, as you would not have the curse of an utterly ruined\nwoman, and a broken-hearted man, attend you through life, and bear\nwitness against you at the Great Day, which shall come after death. You\nare moved, my lord, I see it. I cannot forget the wrong you have done\nme. I cannot even promise to forgive it--but--tell me, and you shall\nnever see me again, or hear more of my reproaches.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnfortunate man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have said more, far more\nthan enough, to move me deeply. Were I at liberty, I would lend you my\nbest aid to search out him who has wronged you, the rather that I do\nsuspect my having been your lodger has been in some degree the remote\ncause of bringing the spoiler into the sheepfold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am glad your lordship grants me so much,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said John Christie,\nresuming the tone of embittered irony with which he had opened\nthe singular conversation; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will spare you farther reproach and\nremonstrance--your mind is made up, and so is mine.--So, ho, warder!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n The warder entered, and John went on,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to get out, brother. Look\nwell to your charge--it were better that half the wild beasts in their\ndens yonder were turned loose upon Tower Hill, than that this same\nsmooth-faced, civil-spoken gentleman, were again returned to honest\nmen's company!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he hastily left the apartment; and Nigel had full leisure\nto lament the waywardness of his fate, which seemed never to tire of\npersecuting him for crimes of which he was innocent, and investing him\nwith the appearances of guilt which his mind abhorred. He could not,\nhowever, help acknowledging to himself, that all the pain which he\nmight sustain from the present accusation of John Christie, was so far\ndeserved, from his having suffered himself, out of vanity, or rather an\nunwillingness to encounter ridicule, to be supposed capable of a\nbase inhospitable crime, merely because fools called it an affair of\ngallantry; and it was no balsam to the wound, when he recollected what\nRichie had told him of his having been ridiculed behind his back by the\ngallants of the ordinary, for affecting the reputation of an intrigue\nwhich he had not in reality spirit enough to have carried on. His\nsimulation had, in a word, placed him in the unlucky predicament of\nbeing rallied as a braggart amongst the dissipated youths, with whom the\nreality of the amour would have given him credit; whilst, on the other\nhand, he was branded as an inhospitable seducer by the injured husband,\nwho was obstinately persuaded of his guilt.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n\n  How fares the man on whom good men would look\n  With eyes where scorn and censure combated,\n  But that kind Christian love hath taught the lesson--\n  That they who merit most contempt and hate,\n  Do most deserve our pity.--\n                              _Old Play_.\n\nIt might have seemed natural that the visit of John Christie should have\nentirely diverted Nigel's attention from his slumbering companion, and,\nfor a time, such was the immediate effect of the chain of new ideas\nwhich the incident introduced; yet, soon after the injured man had\ndeparted, Lord Glenvarloch began to think it extraordinary that the boy\nshould have slept so soundly, while they talked loudly in his vicinity.\nYet he certainly did not appear to have stirred. Was he well--was he\nonly feigning sleep? He went close to him to make his observations, and\nperceived that he had wept, and was still weeping, though his eyes were\nclosed. He touched him gently on the shoulder--the boy shrunk from his\ntouch, but did not awake. He pulled him harder, and asked him if he was\nsleeping.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo they waken folk in your country to know whether they are asleep or\nno?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the boy, in a peevish tone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, my young sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut when they weep in the manner\nyou do in your sleep, they awaken them to see what ails them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt signifies little to any one what ails me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the boy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Lord Glenvarloch; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut you knew before you went to\nsleep how little I could assist you in your difficulties, and you seemed\ndisposed, notwithstanding, to put some confidence in me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I did, I have changed my mind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lad.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what may have occasioned this change of mind, I trow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord\nGlenvarloch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome men speak through their sleep--perhaps you have the\ngift of hearing in it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, but the Patriarch Joseph never dreamt truer dreams than I do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd, pray, what dream have you had\nthat has deprived me of your good opinion; for that, I think, seems the\nmoral of the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall judge yourself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the boy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI dreamed I was in a wild\nforest, where there was a cry of hounds, and winding of horns, exactly\nas I heard in Greenwich Park.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was because you were in the Park this morning, you simple child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStay, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the youth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI went on in my dream, till, at the\ntop of a broad green alley, I saw a noble stag which had fallen into the\ntoils; and methought I knew that he was the very stag which the whole\nparty were hunting, and that if the chase came up, the dogs would tear\nhim to pieces, or the hunters would cut his throat; and I had pity on\nthe gallant stag, and though I was of a different kind from him, and\nthough I was somewhat afraid of him, I thought I would venture something\nto free so stately a creature; and I pulled out my knife, and just as I\nwas beginning to cut the meshes of the net, the animal started up in my\nface in the likeness of a tiger, much larger and fiercer than any you\nmay have seen in the ward of the wild beasts yonder, and was just about\nto tear me limb from limb, when you awaked me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMethinks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI deserve more thanks than I have got, for\nrescuing you from such a danger by waking you. But, my pretty master,\nmethinks all this tale of a tiger and a stag has little to do with your\nchange of temper towards me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know not whether it has or no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lad; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I will not tell\nyou who I am.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will keep your secret to yourself then, peevish boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel,\nturning from him, and resuming his walk through the room; then stopping\nsuddenly, he said--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd yet you shall not escape from me without knowing\nthat I penetrate your mystery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy mystery!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the youth, at once alarmed and irritated--\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat mean\nyou, my lord?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly that I can read your dream without the assistance of a Chaldean\ninterpreter, and my exposition is--that my fair companion does not wear\nthe dress of her sex.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if I do not, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his companion, hastily starting up, and\nfolding her cloak tight around her, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy dress, such as it is, covers one\nwho will not disgrace it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMany would call that speech a fair challenge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch,\nlooking on her fixedly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwomen do not masquerade in men's clothes, to\nmake use of men's weapons.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no such purpose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the seeming boy; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have other means\nof protection, and powerful--but I would first know what is _your_\npurpose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAn honourable and a most respectful one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhatever you are--whatever motive may have brought you into this\nambiguous situation, I am sensible--every look, word, and action of\nyours, makes me sensible, that you are no proper subject of importunity,\nfar less of ill usage. What circumstances can have forced you into so\ndoubtful a situation, I know not; but I feel assured there is, and can\nbe, nothing in them of premeditated wrong, which should expose you to\ncold-blooded insult. From me you have nothing to dread.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI expected nothing less from your nobleness, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the\nfemale; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy adventure, though I feel it was both desperate and foolish,\nis not so very foolish, nor my safety here so utterly unprotected, as\nat first sight--and in this strange dress, it may appear to be. I have\nsuffered enough, and more than enough, by the degradation of having been\nseen in this unfeminine attire, and the comments you must necessarily\nhave made on my conduct--but I thank God that I am so far protected,\nthat I could not have been subjected to insult unavenged.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When this\nextraordinary explanation had proceeded thus far, the warder appeared,\nto place before Lord Glenvarloch a meal, which, for his present\nsituation, might be called comfortable, and which, if not equal to\nthe cookery of the celebrated Chevalier Beaujeu, was much superior in\nneatness and cleanliness to that of Alsatia. A warder attended to do the\nhonours of the table, and made a sign to the disguised female to rise\nand assist him in his functions. But Nigel, declaring that he knew the\nyouth's parents, interfered, and caused his companion to eat along with\nhim. She consented with a sort of embarrassment, which rendered her\npretty features yet more interesting. Yet she maintained with a natural\ngrace that sort of good-breeding which belongs to the table; and\nit seemed to Nigel, whether already prejudiced in her favour by the\nextraordinary circumstances of their meeting, or whether really judging\nfrom what was actually the fact, that he had seldom seen a young person\ncomport herself with more decorous propriety, mixed with ingenuous\nsimplicity; while the consciousness of the peculiarity of her situation\nthrew a singular colouring over her whole demeanour, which could be\nneither said to be formal, nor easy, nor embarrassed, but was compounded\nof, and shaded with, an interchange of all these three characteristics.\nWine was placed on the table, of which she could not be prevailed on\nto taste a glass. Their conversation was, of course, limited by the\npresence of the warder to the business of the table: but Nigel had, long\nere the cloth was removed, formed the resolution, if possible, of making\nhimself master of this young person's history, the more especially as he\nnow began to think that the tones of her voice and her features were not\nso strange to him as he had originally supposed. This, however, was a\nconviction which he adopted slowly, and only as it dawned upon him from\nparticular circumstances during the course of the repast.\n\nAt length the prison-meal was finished, and Lord Glenvarloch began to\nthink how he might most easily enter upon the topic he meditated, when\nthe warder announced a visitor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSoh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, something displeased, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI find even a prison does not\nsave one from importunate visitations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe prepared to receive his guest, however, while his alarmed companion\nflew to the large cradle-shaped chair, which had first served her as a\nplace of refuge, drew her cloak around her, and disposed herself as much\nas she could to avoid observation. She had scarce made her arrangements\nfor that purpose when the door opened, and the worthy citizen, George\nHeriot, entered the prison-chamber.\n\nHe cast around the apartment his usual sharp, quick glance of\nobservation, and, advancing to Nigel, said--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord, I wish I could say\nI was happy to see you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe sight of those who are unhappy themselves, Master Heriot, seldom\nproduces happiness to their friends--I, however, am glad to see you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe extended his hand, but Heriot bowed with much formal complaisance,\ninstead of accepting the courtesy, which in those times, when the\ndistinction of ranks was much guarded by etiquette and ceremony, was\nconsidered as a distinguished favour.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are displeased with me, Master Heriot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch,\nreddening, for he was not deceived by the worthy citizen's affectation\nof extreme reverence and respect.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy no means, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I have been in France, and\nhave thought it is well to import, along with other more substantial\narticles, a small sample of that good-breeding which the French are so\nrenowned for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not kind of you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto bestow the first use of it on\nan old and obliged friend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHeriot only answered to this observation with a short dry cough, and\nthen proceeded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHem! hem! I say, ahem! My lord, as my French politeness may not carry\nme far, I would willingly know whether I am to speak as a friend, since\nyour lordship is pleased to term me such; or whether I am, as befits\nmy condition, to confine myself to the needful business which must be\ntreated of between us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeak as a friend by all means, Master Heriot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI perceive\nyou have adopted some of the numerous prejudices against me, if not\nall of them. Speak out, and frankly--what I cannot deny I will at least\nconfess.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I trust, my lord, redress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo far as in my power, certainly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh I my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is a melancholy though a\nnecessary restriction; for how lightly may any one do an hundred times\nmore than the degree of evil which it may be within his power to repair\nto the sufferers and to society! But we are not alone here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,\nstopping, and darting his shrewd eye towards the muffled figure of the\ndisguised maiden, whose utmost efforts had not enabled her so to adjust\nher position as altogether to escape observation. More anxious to\nprevent her being discovered than to keep his own affairs private, Nigel\nhastily answered--\u00e2\u0080\u009c'Tis a page of mine; you may speak freely before him.\nHe is of France, and knows no English.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am then to speak freely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot, after a second glance at the\nchair; \u00e2\u0080\u009cperhaps my words may be more free than welcome.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo on, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have told you I can bear reproof.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn one word, then, my lord--why do I find you in this place, and\nwhelmed with charges which must blacken a name rendered famous by ages\nof virtue?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSimply, then, you find me here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause, to begin from my\noriginal error, I would be wiser than my father.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a difficult task, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour father was\nvoiced generally as the wisest and one of the bravest men of Scotland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe commanded me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto avoid all gambling; and I took\nupon me to modify this injunction into regulating my play according to\nmy skill, means, and the course of my luck.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, self opinion, acting on a desire of acquisition, my lord--you hoped\nto touch pitch and not to be defiled,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Heriot. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, my\nlord, you need not say, for I have heard with much regret, how far\nthis conduct diminished your reputation. Your next error I may without\nscruple remind you of--My lord, my lord, in whatever degree Lord\nDalgarno may have failed towards you, the son of his father should have\nbeen sacred from your violence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou speak in cold blood, Master Heriot, and I was smarting under a\nthousand wrongs inflicted on me under the mask of friendship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is, he gave your lordship bad advice, and you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWas fool enough to follow his counsel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Nigel--\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut we will\npass this, Master Heriot, if you please. Old men and young men, men of\nthe sword and men of peaceful occupation, always have thought, always\nwill think, differently on such subjects.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI grant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe distinction between the old goldsmith\nand the young nobleman--still you should have had patience for Lord\nHuntinglen's sake, and prudence for your own. Supposing your quarrel\njust--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI pray you to pass on to some other charge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not your accuser, my lord; but I trust in heaven, that your own\nheart has already accused you bitterly on the inhospitable wrong which\nyour late landlord has sustained at your hand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHad I been guilty of what you allude to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch,--\u00e2\u0080\u009chad\na moment of temptation hurried me away, I had long ere now most bitterly\nrepented it. But whoever may have wronged the unhappy woman, it was not\nI--I never heard of her folly until within this hour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot, with some severity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis sounds too much\nlike affectation. I know there is among our modern youth a new creed\nrespecting adultery as well as homicide--I would rather hear you speak\nof a revision of the Decalogue, with mitigated penalties in favour of\nthe privileged orders--I would rather hear you do this than deny a fact\nin which you have been known to glory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGlory!--I never did, never would have taken honour to myself from\nsuch a cause,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could not prevent other idle\ntongues, and idle brains, from making false inferences.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou would have known well enough how to stop their mouths, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n replied Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009chad they spoke of you what was unpleasing to your\nears, and what the truth did not warrant.--Come, my lord, remember your\npromise to confess; and, indeed, to confess is, in this case, in\nsome slight sort to redress. I will grant you are young--the woman\nhandsome--and, as I myself have observed, light-headed enough. Let me\nknow where she is. Her foolish husband has still some compassion for\nher--will save her from infamy--perhaps, in time, receive her back; for\nwe are a good-natured generation we traders. Do not, my lord, emulate\nthose who work mischief merely for the pleasure of doing so--it is the\nvery devil's worst quality.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour grave remonstrances will drive me mad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is\na show of sense and reason in what you say; and yet, it is positively\ninsisting on my telling the retreat of a fugitive of whom I know nothing\nearthly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is well, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Heriot, coldly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have a right, such\nas it is, to keep your own secrets; but, since my discourse on these\npoints seems so totally unavailing, we had better proceed to business.\nYet your father's image rises before me, and seems to plead that I\nshould go on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe it as you will, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Glenvarloch; \u00e2\u0080\u009che who doubts my word shall\nhave no additional security for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, my lord.--In the Sanctuary at Whitefriars--a place of refuge so\nunsuitable to a young man of quality and character--I am told a murder\nwas committed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you believe that I did the deed, I suppose?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod forbid, my lord!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe coroner's inquest hath sat,\nand it appeared that your lordship, under your assumed name of Grahame,\nbehaved with the utmost bravery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo compliment, I pray you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am only too happy to find,\nthat I did not murder, or am not believed to have murdered, the old\nman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut even in this affair there lacks\nexplanation. Your lordship embarked this morning in a wherry with a\nfemale, and, it is said, an immense sum of money, in specie and other\nvaluables--but the woman has not since been heard of.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI parted with her at Paul's Wharf,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhere she went ashore\nwith her charge. I gave her a letter to that very man, John Christie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, that is the waterman's story; but John Christie denies that he\nremembers anything of the matter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sorry to hear this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young nobleman; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope in Heaven\nshe has not been trepanned, for the treasure she had with her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope not, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut men's minds are much\ndisturbed about it. Our national character suffers on all hands. Men\nremember the fatal case of Lord Sanquhar, hanged for the murder of a\nfencing-master; and exclaim, they will not have their wives whored, and\ntheir property stolen, by the nobility of Scotland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd all this is laid to my door!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy exculpation is easy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI trust so, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot;--\u00e2\u0080\u009cnay, in this particular, I do not\ndoubt it.--But why did you leave Whitefriars under such circumstances?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster Reginald Lowestoffe sent a boat for me, with intimation to\nprovide for my safety.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sorry to say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat he denies all knowledge of\nyour lordship's motions, after having dispatched a messenger to you with\nsome baggage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe watermen told me they were employed by him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWatermen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cone of these proves to be an idle apprentice,\nan old acquaintance of mine--the other has escaped; but the fellow who\nis in custody persists in saying he was employed by your lordship, and\nyou only.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe lies!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, hastily;--\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe told me Master\nLowestoffe had sent him.--I hope that kind-hearted gentleman is at\nliberty?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand has escaped with a rebuke from the\nbenchers, for interfering in such a matter as your lordship's. The Court\ndesire to keep well with the young Templars in these times of commotion,\nor he had not come off so well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is the only word of comfort I have heard from you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Nigel.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut this poor woman,--she and her trunk were committed to the charge of\ntwo porters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo said the pretended waterman; but none of the fellows who ply at the\nwharf will acknowledge the employment.--I see the idea makes you uneasy,\nmy lord; but every effort is made to discover the poor woman's place\nof retreat--if, indeed, she yet lives.--And now, my lord, my errand is\nspoken, so far as it relates exclusively to your lordship; what remains,\nis matter of business of a more formal kind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet us proceed to it without delay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would\nhear of the affairs of any one rather than of my own.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou cannot have forgotten, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe transaction\nwhich took place some weeks since at Lord Huntinglen's--by which a large\nsum of money was advanced for the redemption of your lordship's estate?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI remember it perfectly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand your present austerity\ncannot make me forget your kindness on the occasion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHeriot bowed gravely, and went on.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat money was advanced under the\nexpectation and hope that it might be replaced by the contents of a\ngrant to your lordship, under the royal sign-manual, in payment of\ncertain monies due by the crown to your father.--I trust your lordship\nunderstood the transaction at the time--I trust you now understand my\nresumption of its import, and hold it to be correct?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUndeniably correct,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lord Glenvarloch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the sums contained\nin the warrant cannot be recovered, my lands become the property of\nthose who paid off the original holders of the mortgage, and now stand\nin their right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven so, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd your lordship's unhappy\ncircumstances having, it would seem, alarmed these creditors, they\nare now, I am sorry to say, pressing for one or other of these\nalternatives--possession of the land, or payment of their debt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have a right to one or other,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lord Glenvarloch; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand as\nI cannot do the last in my present condition, I suppose they must enter\non possession.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStay, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you have ceased to call me a friend\nto your person, at least you shall see I am willing to be such to your\nfather's house, were it but for the sake of your father's memory. If\nyou will trust me with the warrant under the sign-manual, I believe\ncircumstances do now so stand at Court, that I may be able to recover\nthe money for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would do so gladly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut the casket which\ncontains it is not in my possession. It was seized when I was arrested\nat Greenwich.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will be no longer withheld from you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor, I\nunderstand, my Master's natural good sense, and some information which\nhe has procured, I know not how, has induced him to contradict the whole\ncharge of the attempt on his person. It is entirely hushed up; and\nyou will only be proceeded against for your violence on Lord Dalgarno,\ncommitted within the verge of the Palace--and that you will find heavy\nenough to answer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not shrink under the weight,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut that\nis not the present point.--If I had that casket--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour baggage stood in the little ante-room, as I passed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\ncitizen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe casket caught my eye. I think you had it of me. It was my\nold friend Sir Faithful Frugal's. Ay; he, too, had a son--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere he stopped short.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA son who, like Lord Glenvarloch's, did no credit to his father.--Was\nit not so you would have ended the sentence, Master Heriot?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the\nyoung nobleman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord, it was a word spoken rashly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Heriot. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod may\nmend all in his own good time. This, however, I will say, that I have\nsometimes envied my friends their fair and flourishing families; and yet\nhave I seen such changes when death has removed the head, so many rich\nmen's sons penniless, the heirs of so many knights and nobles acreless,\nthat I think mine own estate and memory, as I shall order it, has a fair\nchance of outliving those of greater men, though God has given me no\nheir of my name. But this is from the purpose.--Ho! warder, bring in\nLord Glenvarloch's baggage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The officer obeyed. Seals had been placed\nupon the trunk and casket, but were now removed, the warder said, in\nconsequence of the subsequent orders from Court, and the whole was\nplaced at the prisoner's free disposal.\n\nDesirous to bring this painful visit to a conclusion, Lord Glenvarloch\nopened the casket, and looked through the papers which it contained,\nfirst hastily, and then more slowly and accurately; but it was all in\nvain. The Sovereign's signed warrant had disappeared.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought and expected nothing better,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George Heriot, bitterly.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe beginning of evil is the letting out of water. Here is a fair\nheritage lost, I dare say, on a foul cast at dice, or a conjuring trick\nat cards!--My lord, your surprise is well played. I give you full joy\nof your accomplishments. I have seen many as young brawlers and\nspendthrifts, but never as young and accomplished a dissembler.--Nay,\nman, never bend your angry brows on me. I speak in bitterness of heart,\nfrom what I remember of your worthy father; and if his son hears of his\ndegeneracy from no one else, he shall hear it from the old goldsmith.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis new suspicion drove Nigel to the very extremity of his patience;\nyet the motives and zeal of the good old man, as well as the\ncircumstances of suspicion which created his displeasure, were so\nexcellent an excuse for it, that they formed an absolute curb on the\nresentment of Lord Glenvarloch, and constrained him, after two or three\nhasty exclamations, to observe a proud and sullen silence. At length,\nMaster Heriot resumed his lecture.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHark you, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is scarce possible that this most\nimportant paper can be absolutely assigned away. Let me know in what\nobscure corner, and for what petty sum, it lies pledged--something may\nyet be done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour efforts in my favour are the more generous,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord\nGlenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas you offer them to one whom you believe you have cause\nto think hardly of--but they are altogether unavailing. Fortune has\ntaken the field against me at every point. Even let her win the battle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cZouns!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Heriot, impatiently,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cyou would make a saint swear!\nWhy, I tell you, if this paper, the loss of which seems to sit so\nlight on you, be not found, farewell to the fair lordship of\nGlenvarloch--firth and forest--lea and furrow--lake and stream--all that\nhas been in the house of Olifaunt since the days of William the Lion!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFarewell to them, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cand that moan is soon made.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c'Sdeath! my lord, you will make more moan for it ere you die,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nHeriot, in the same tone of angry impatience.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot I, my old friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I mourn, Master Heriot, it will\nbe for having lost the good opinion of a worthy man, and lost it, as I\nmust say, most undeservedly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, young man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot, shaking his head, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake me believe\nthat if you can.--To sum the matter up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, rising from his seat,\nand walking towards that occupied by the disguised female, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor our\nmatters are now drawn into small compass, you shall as soon make me\nbelieve that this masquerading mummer, on whom I now lay the hand of\npaternal authority, is a French page, who understands no English.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he took hold of the supposed page's cloak, and, not without\nsome gentle degree of violence, led into the middle of the apartment the\ndisguised fair one, who in vain attempted to cover her face, first with\nher mantle, and afterwards with her hands; both which impediments Master\nHeriot removed something unceremoniously, and gave to view the detected\ndaughter of the old chronologist, his own fair god-daughter, Margaret\nRamsay.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere is goodly gear!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; and, as he spoke, he could not prevent\nhimself from giving her a slight shake, for we have elsewhere noticed\nthat he was a severe disciplinarian.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow comes it, minion, that I\nfind you in so shameless a dress, and so unworthy a situation? Nay, your\nmodesty is now mistimed--it should have come sooner. Speak, or I will--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster Heriot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhatever right you may have\nover this maiden elsewhere, while in my apartment she is under my\nprotection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour protection, my lord!--a proper protector!--and how long, mistress,\nhave you been under my lord's protection? Speak out forsooth!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the matter of two hours, godfather,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the maiden, with a\ncountenance bent to the ground, and covered with blushes, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it was\nagainst my will.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTwo hours!\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated Heriot,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cspace enough for mischief.--My lord,\nthis is, I suppose, another victim offered to your character of\ngallantry--another adventure to be boasted of at Beaujeu's ordinary?\nMethinks the roof under which you first met this silly maiden should\nhave secured _her_, at least, from such a fate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn my honour, Master Heriot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou remind me\nnow, for the first time, that I saw this young lady in your family.\nHer features are not easily forgotten, and yet I was trying in vain to\nrecollect where I had last looked on them. For your suspicions, they are\nas false as they are injurious both to her and me. I had but discovered\nher disguise as you entered. I am satisfied, from her whole behaviour,\nthat her presence here in this dress was involuntary; and God forbid\nthat I have been capable of taking advantage of it to her prejudice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is well mouthed, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Master Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut a cunning clerk\ncan read the Apocrypha as loud as the Scripture. Frankly, my lord, you\nare come to that pass, where your words will not be received without a\nwarrant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should not speak, perhaps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret, the natural vivacity of\nwhose temper could never be long suppressed by any situation, however\ndisadvantageous, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I cannot be silent. Godfather, you do me\nwrong--and no less wrong to this young nobleman. You say his words want\na warrant. I know where to find a warrant for some of them, and the rest\nI deeply and devoutly believe without one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I thank you, maiden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor the good opinion you have\nexpressed. I am at that point, it seems, though how I have been driven\nto it I know not, where every fair construction of my actions and\nmotives is refused me. I am the more obliged to her who grants me that\nright which the world denies me. For you, lady, were I at liberty, I\nhave a sword and arm should know how to guard your reputation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon my word, a perfect Amadis and Oriana!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George Heriot. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nshould soon get my throat cut betwixt the knight and the princess, I\nsuppose, but that the beef-eaters are happily within halloo.--Come,\ncome, Lady Light-o'-Love--if you mean to make your way with me, it must\nbe by plain facts, not by speeches from romaunts and play-books. How, in\nHeaven's name, came you here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Margaret, \u00e2\u0080\u009csince I must speak, I went to Greenwich this\nmorning with Monna Paula, to present a petition to the king on the part\nof the Lady Hermione.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMercy-a-gad!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis she in the dance, too? Could she\nnot have waited my return to stir in her affairs? But I suppose the\nintelligence I sent her had rendered her restless. Ah! woman, woman--he\nthat goes partner with you, had need of a double share of patience, for\nyou will bring none into the common stock.--Well, but what on earth had\nthis embassy of Monna Paula's to do with your absurd disguise? Speak\nout.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMonna Paula was frightened,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Margaret, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand did not know\nhow to set about the errand, for you know she scarce ever goes out of\ndoors--and so--and so--I agreed to go with her to give her courage; and,\nfor the dress, I am sure you remember I wore it at a Christmas mumming,\nand you thought it not unbeseeming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, for a Christmas parlour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut not to go a-masking\nthrough the country in. I do remember it, minion, and I knew it even\nnow; that and your little shoe there, linked with a hint I had in the\nmorning from a friend, or one who called himself such, led to your\ndetection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--Here Lord Glenvarloch could not help giving a glance at the\npretty foot, which even the staid citizen thought worth recollection--it\nwas but a glance, for he saw how much the least degree of observation\nadded to Margaret's distress and confusion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd tell me, maiden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n continued Master Heriot, for what we have observed was by-play,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cdid\nthe Lady Hermione know of this fair work?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI dared not have told her for the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret--\u00e2\u0080\u009cshe thought\none of our apprentices went with Monna Paula.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt may be here noticed, that the words, \u00e2\u0080\u009cour apprentices,\u00e2\u0080\u009d seemed to\nhave in them something of a charm to break the fascination with which\nLord Glenvarloch had hitherto listened to the broken, yet interesting\ndetails of Margaret's history.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd wherefore went he not?--he had been a fitter companion for Monna\nPaula than you, I wot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the citizen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was otherwise employed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret, in a voice scarce audible.\n\nMaster George darted a hasty glance at Nigel, and when he saw his\nfeatures betoken no consciousness, he muttered to himself,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt must be\nbetter than I feared.--And so this cursed Spaniard, with her head full,\nas they all have, of disguises, trap-doors, rope-ladders, and masks,\nwas jade and fool enough to take you with her on this wild goose\nerrand?--And how sped you, I pray?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust as we reached the gate of the Park,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Margaret, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe cry\nof treason was raised. I know not what became of Monna, but I ran till I\nfell into the arms of a very decent serving-man, called Linklater; and I\nwas fain to tell him I was your god-daughter, and so he kept the rest of\nthem from me, and got me to speech of his Majesty, as I entreated him to\ndo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is the only sign you showed in the whole matter that common sense\nhad not utterly deserted your little skull,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis Majesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the damsel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas so gracious as to receive me\nalone, though the courtiers cried out against the danger to his person,\nand would have searched me for arms, God help me, but the king forbade\nit. I fancy he had a hint from Linklater how the truth stood with me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, maiden, I ask not what passed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit becomes not\nme to pry into my Master's secrets. Had you been closeted with his\ngrandfather the Red Tod of Saint Andrews, as Davie Lindsay used to call\nhim, by my faith, I should have had my own thoughts of the matter; but\nour Master, God bless him, is douce and temperate, and Solomon in every\nthing, save in the chapter of wives and concubines.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know not what you mean, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Margaret. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis Majesty was\nmost kind and compassionate, but said I must be sent hither, and that\nthe Lieutenant's lady, the Lady Mansel, would have a charge of me, and\nsee that I sustained no wrong; and the king promised to send me in a\ntilted barge, and under conduct of a person well known to you; and thus\nI come to be in the Tower.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut how, or why, in this apartment, nymph?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George\nHeriot--\u00e2\u0080\u009cExpound that to me, for I think the riddle needs reading.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot explain it, sir, further, than that the Lady Mansel sent me\nhere, in spite of my earnest prayers, tears, and entreaties. I was not\nafraid of any thing, for I knew I should be protected. But I could have\ndied then--could die now--for very shame and confusion!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well, if your tears are genuine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey may the\nsooner wash out the memory of your fault--Knows your father aught of\nthis escape of yours?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would not for the world he did,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied she; \u00e2\u0080\u009che believes me with\nthe Lady Hermione.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, honest Davy can regulate his horologes better than his\nfamily.--Come, damsel, now I will escort you back to the Lady Mansel,\nand pray her, of her kindness, that when she is again trusted with a\ngoose, she will not give it to the fox to keep.--The warders will let us\npass to my lady's lodgings, I trust.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStay but one moment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhatever hard opinion you\nmay have formed of me, I forgive you, for time will show that you do\nme wrong; and you yourself, I think, will be the first to regret the\ninjustice you have done me. But involve not in your suspicions this\nyoung person, for whose purity of thought angels themselves should be\nvouchers. I have marked every look, every gesture; and whilst I can draw\nbreath, I shall ever think of her with--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThink not at all of her, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered George Heriot, interrupting\nhim; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is, I have a notion, the best favour you can do her;--or think\nof her as the daughter of Davy Ramsay, the clockmaker, no proper\nsubject for fine speeches, romantic adventures, or high-flown Arcadian\ncompliments. I give you god-den, my lord. I think not altogether so\nharshly as my speech may have spoken. If I can help--that is, if I saw\nmy way clearly through this labyrinth--but it avails not talking now. I\ngive your lordship god-den.--Here, warder! Permit us to pass to the\nLady Hansel's apartment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The warder said he must have orders from the\nLieutenant; and as he retired to procure them, the parties remained\nstanding near each other, but without speaking, and scarce looking at\neach other save by stealth, a situation which, in two of the party at\nleast, was sufficiently embarrassing. The difference of rank, though in\nthat age a consideration so serious, could not prevent Lord Glenvarloch\nfrom seeing that Margaret Ramsay was one of the prettiest young women\nhe had ever beheld--from suspecting, he could scarce tell why, that he\nhimself was not indifferent to her--from feeling assured that he had\nbeen the cause of much of her present distress--admiration, self-love,\nand generosity, acting in favour of the same object; and when the yeoman\nreturned with permission to his guests to withdraw, Nigel's obeisance\nto the beautiful daughter of the mechanic was marked with an expression,\nwhich called up in her cheeks as much colour as any incident of the\neventful day had hitherto excited. She returned the courtesy timidly\nand irresolutely--clung to her godfather's arm, and left the apartment,\nwhich, dark as it was, had never yet appeared so obscure to Nigel, as\nwhen the door closed behind her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n\n  Yet though thou shouldst be dragg'd in scorn\n  To yonder ignominious tree,\n  Thou shall not want one faithful friend\n  To share the cruel fates' decree.\n                   _Ballad of Jemmy Dawson._\n\nMaster George Heriot and his ward, as she might justly be termed, for\nhis affection to Margaret imposed on him all the cares of a guardian,\nwere ushered by the yeoman of the guard to the lodging of the\nLieutenant, where they found him seated with his lady. They were\nreceived by both with that decorous civility which Master Heriot's\ncharacter and supposed influence demanded, even at the hand of a\npunctilious old soldier and courtier like Sir Edward Mansel. Lady Mansel\nreceived Margaret with like courtesy, and informed Master George that\nshe was now only her guest, and no longer her prisoner.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is at liberty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto return to her friends under your\ncharge--such is his Majesty's pleasure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am glad of it, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut only I could have wished\nher freedom had taken place before her foolish interview with that\nsingular young man; and I marvel your ladyship permitted it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy good Master Heriot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Edward, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe act according to the\ncommands of one better and wiser than ourselves--our orders from his\nMajesty must be strictly and literally obeyed; and I need not say that\nthe wisdom of his Majesty doth more than ensure--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know his Majesty's wisdom well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyet there is an old\nproverb about fire and flax--well, let it pass.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see Sir Mungo Malagrowther stalking towards the door of the lodging,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said the Lady Mansel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith the gait of a lame crane--it is his second\nvisit this morning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe brought the warrant for discharging Lord Glenvarloch of the charge\nof treason,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Edward.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd from him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI heard much of what had befallen; for I\ncame from France only late last evening, and somewhat unexpectedly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs they spoke, Sir Mungo entered the apartment--saluted the Lieutenant\nof the Tower and his lady with ceremonious civility--honoured George\nHeriot with a patronising nod of acknowledgment, and accosted Margaret\nwith--\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey! my young charge, you have not doffed your masculine attire\nyet?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe does not mean to lay it aside, Sir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot, speaking\nloud, \u00e2\u0080\u009cuntil she has had satisfaction from you, for betraying her\ndisguise to me, like a false knight--and in very deed, Sir Mungo, I\nthink when you told me she was rambling about in so strange a dress, you\nmight have said also that she was under Lady Mansel's protection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was the king's secret, Master Heriot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Mungo, throwing\nhimself into a chair with an air of atrabilarious importance; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe other\nwas a well-meaning hint to yourself, as the girl's friend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit was done like yourself--enough told to make\nme unhappy about her--not a word which could relieve my uneasiness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir Mungo will not hear that remark,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe must change\nthe subject.--Is there any news from Court, Sir Mungo? you have been to\nGreenwich?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou might as well ask me, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Knight, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhether there\nis any news from hell.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow, Sir Mungo, how!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Edward, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeasure your words something\nbetter--You speak of the Court of King James.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir Edward, if I spoke of the court of the twelve Kaisers, I would say\nit is as confused for the present as the infernal regions. Courtiers of\nforty years' standing, and such I may write myself, are as far to seek\nin the matter as a minnow in the Maelstrom. Some folk say the king has\nfrowned on the Prince--some that the Prince has looked grave on the\nduke--some that Lord Glenvarloch will be hanged for high treason--and\nsome that there is matter against Lord Dalgarno that may cost him as\nmuch as his head's worth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what do you, that are a courtier of forty years' standing, think of\nit all?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Edward Mansel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, nay, do not ask him, Sir Edward,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lady, with an\nexpressive look to her husband.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir Mungo is too witty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added Master Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto remember that he who\nsays aught that may be repeated to his own prejudice, does but load a\npiece for any of the company to shoot him dead with, at their pleasure\nand convenience.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the bold Knight, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou think I am afraid of the trepan? Why\nnow, what if I should say that Dalgarno has more wit than honesty,--the\nduke more sail than ballast,--the Prince more pride than prudence,--and\nthat the king--\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Lady Mansel held up her finger in a warning\nmanner--\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the king is my very good master, who has given me, for\nforty years and more, dog's wages, videlicit, bones and beating.--Why\nnow, all this is said, and Archie Armstrong [Footnote: The celebrated\nCourt jester.] says worse than this of the best of them every day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe more fool he,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyet he is not so utterly wrong,\nfor folly is his best wisdom. But do not you, Sir Mungo, set your wit\nagainst a fool's, though he be a court fool.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA fool, said you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Sir Mungo, not having fully heard what\nMaster Heriot said, or not choosing to have it thought so,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have\nbeen a fool indeed, to hang on at a close-fisted Court here, when men of\nunderstanding and men of action have been making fortunes in every other\nplace of Europe. But here a man comes indifferently off unless he gets a\ngreat key to turn,\u00e2\u0080\u009d (looking at Sir Edward,) \u00e2\u0080\u009cor can beat tattoo with a\nhammer on a pewter plate.--Well, sirs, I must make as much haste back on\nmine errand as if I were a fee'd messenger.--Sir Edward and my lady,\nI leave my commendations with you--and my good-will with you, Master\nHeriot--and for this breaker of bounds, if you will act by my counsel,\nsome maceration by fasting, and a gentle use of the rod, is the best\ncure for her giddy fits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you propose for Greenwich, Sir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lieutenant, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\nspare you the labour--the king comes immediately to Whitehall.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that must be the reason the council are summoned to meet in such\nhurry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Mungo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell--I will, with your permission, go to the\npoor lad Glenvarloch, and bestow some comfort on him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Lieutenant seemed to look up, and pause for a moment as if in doubt.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe lad will want a pleasant companion, who can tell him the nature of\nthe punishment which he is to suffer, and other matters of concernment.\nI will not leave him until I show him how absolutely he hath ruined\nhimself from feather to spur, how deplorable is his present state, and\nhow small his chance of mending it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Sir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Lieutenant, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you really think all\nthis likely to be very consolatory to the party concerned, I will send a\nwarder to conduct you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill humbly pray of Lady Mansel, that she\nwill lend some of her handmaiden's apparel to this giddy-brained girl;\nfor I shall forfeit my reputation if I walk up Tower Hill with her\nin that mad guise--and yet the silly lassie looks not so ill in it\nneither.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will send my coach with you instantly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the obliging lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFaith, madam, and if you will honour us by such courtesy, I will gladly\naccept it at your hands,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the citizen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor business presses hard\non me, and the forenoon is already lost, to little purpose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe coach being ordered accordingly, transported the worthy citizen and\nhis charge to his mansion in Lombard Street. There he found his presence\nwas anxiously expected by the Lady Hermione, who had just received an\norder to be in readiness to attend upon the Royal Privy Council in the\ncourse of an hour; and upon whom, in her inexperience of business, and\nlong retirement from society and the world, the intimation had made as\ndeep an impression as if it had not been the necessary consequence of\nthe petition which she had presented to the king by Monna Paula. George\nHeriot gently blamed her for taking any steps in an affair so important\nuntil his return from France, especially as he had requested her\nto remain quiet, in a letter which accompanied the evidence he had\ntransmitted to her from Paris. She could only plead in answer the\ninfluence which her immediately stirring in the matter was likely to\nhave on the affair of her kinsman Lord Glenvarloch, for she was ashamed\nto acknowledge how much she had been gained on by the eager importunity\nof her youthful companion. The motive of Margaret's eagerness was, of\ncourse, the safety of Nigel; but we must leave it to time to show in\nwhat particulars that came to be connected with the petition of the\nLady Hermione. Meanwhile, we return to the visit with which Sir Mungo\nMalagrowther favoured the afflicted young nobleman in his place of\ncaptivity.\n\nThe Knight, after the usual salutations, and having prefaced his\ndiscourse with a great deal of professed regret for Nigel's situation,\nsat down beside him, and composing his grotesque features into the most\nlugubrious despondence, began his raven song as follows:--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI bless God, my lord, that I was the person who had the pleasure to\nbring his Majesty's mild message to the Lieutenant, discharging the\nhigher prosecution against ye, for any thing meditated against his\nMajesty's sacred person; for, admit you be prosecuted on the lesser\noffence, or breach of privilege of the Palace and its precincts, _usque\nad mutilationem_, even to dismemberation, as it is most likely you will,\nyet the loss of a member is nothing to being hanged and drawn quick,\nafter the fashion of a traitor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should feel the shame of having deserved such a punishment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered\nNigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore than the pain of undergoing it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoubtless, my lord, the having, as you say, deserved it, must be an\nexcruciation to your own mind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied his tormentor; \u00e2\u0080\u009ca kind of mental\nand metaphysical hanging, drawing, and quartering, which may be in some\nmeasure equipollent with the external application of hemp, iron, fire,\nand the like, to the outer man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI say, Sir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand beg you to understand my words,\nthat I am unconscious of any error, save that of having arms on my\nperson when I chanced to approach that of my Sovereign.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe are right, my lord, to acknowledge nothing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Mungo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\nhave an old proverb,--Confess, and--so forth. And indeed, as to the\nweapons, his Majesty has a special ill-will at all arms whatsoever, and\nmore especially pistols; but, as I said, there is an end of that matter.\n[Footnote: Wilson informs us that when Colonel Grey, a Scotsman who\naffected the buff dress even in the time of peace, appeared in that\nmilitary garb at Court, the king, seeing him with a case of pistols at\nhis girdle, which he never greatly liked, told him, merrily, \u00e2\u0080\u009che was\nnow so fortified, that, if he were but well victualled, he would be\nimpregnable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--WILSON'S _Life and Reign of James VI._, _apud_ KENNET'S\n_History of England_, vol. ii. p. 389. In 1612, the tenth year\nof James's reign, there was a rumour abroad that a shipload of\npocket-pistols had been exported from Spain, with a view to a general\nmassacre of the Protestants. Proclamations were of consequence sent\nforth, prohibiting all persons from carrying pistols under a foot long\nin the barrel. _Ibid_. p. 690.] I wish you as well through the next,\nwhich is altogether unlikely.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSurely, Sir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou yourself might say something\nin my favour concerning the affair in the Park. None knows better\nthan you that I was at that moment urged by wrongs of the most heinous\nnature, offered to me by Lord Dalgarno, many of which were reported to\nme by yourself, much to the inflammation of my passion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlack-a-day!-Alack-a-day!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Sir Mungo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI remember but too well\nhow much your choler was inflamed, in spite of the various remonstrances\nwhich I made to you respecting the sacred nature of the place. Alas!\nalas! you cannot say you leaped into the mire for want of warning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see, Sir Mungo, you are determined to remember nothing which can do\nme service,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBlithely would I do ye service,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Knight; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand the best whilk I\ncan think of is, to tell you the process of the punishment to the whilk\nyou will be indubitably subjected, I having had the good fortune to\nbehold it performed in the Queen's time, on a chield that had written\na pasquinado. I was then in my Lord Gray's train, who lay leaguer here,\nand being always covetous of pleasing and profitable sights, I could not\ndispense with being present on the occasion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should be surprised, indeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you had so\nfar put restraint upon your benevolence, as to stay away from such an\nexhibition.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey! was your lordship praying me to be present at your own execution?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered the Knight. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTroth, my lord, it will be a painful sight to a\nfriend, but I will rather punish myself than baulk you. It is a pretty\npageant, in the main--a very pretty pageant. The fallow came on with\nsuch a bold face, it was a pleasure to look on him. He was dressed all\nin white, to signify harmlessness and innocence. The thing was done on a\nscaffold at Westminster--most likely yours will be at the Charing. There\nwere the Sheriffs and the Marshal's men, and what not--the executioner,\nwith his cleaver and mallet, and his man, with a pan of hot charcoal,\nand the irons for cautery. He was a dexterous fallow that Derrick. This\nman Gregory is not fit to jipper a joint with him; it might be worth\nyour lordship's while to have the loon sent to a barber-surgeon's, to\nlearn some needful scantling of anatomy--it may be for the benefit of\nyourself and other unhappy sufferers, and also a kindness to Gregory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not take the trouble,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the laws will demand my\nhand, the executioner may get it off as he best can. If the king leaves\nit where it is, it may chance to do him better service.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVera noble--vera grand, indeed, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Mungo; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is\npleasant to see a brave man suffer. This fallow whom I spoke of--This\nTubbs, or Stubbs, or whatever the plebeian was called, came forward as\nbold as an emperor, and said to the people, 'Good friends, I come\nto leave here the hand of a true Englishman,' and clapped it on\nthe dressing-block with as much ease as if he had laid it on his\nsweetheart's shoulder; whereupon Derrick the hangman, adjusting, d'ye\nmind me, the edge of his cleaver on the very joint, hit it with the\nmallet with such force, that the hand flew off as far from the owner as\na gauntlet which the challenger casts down in the tilt-yard. Well, sir,\nStubbs, or Tubbs, lost no whit of countenance, until the fallow clapped\nthe hissing-hot iron on his raw stump. My lord, it fizzed like a rasher\nof bacon, and the fallow set up an elritch screech, which made some\nthink his courage was abated; but not a whit, for he plucked off his\nhat with his left hand, and waved it, crying, 'God save the Queen, and\nconfound all evil counsellors!' The people gave him three cheers, which\nhe deserved for his stout heart; and, truly, I hope to see your lordship\nsuffer with the same magnanimity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thank you, Sir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, who had not been able to forbear\nsome natural feelings of an unpleasant nature during this lively\ndetail,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no doubt the exhibition will be a very engaging one\nto you and the other spectators, whatever it may prove to the party\nprincipally concerned.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVera engaging,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Sir Mungo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cvera interesting--vera interesting\nindeed, though not altogether so much so as an execution for high\ntreason. I saw Digby, the Winters, Fawkes, and the rest of the gunpowder\ngang, suffer for that treason, whilk was a vera grand spectacle, as well\nin regard to their sufferings, as to their constancy in enduring.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am the more obliged to your goodness, Sir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Nigel,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat has induced you, although you have lost the sight, to congratulate\nme on my escape from the hazard of making the same edifying appearance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs you say, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Sir Mungo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe loss is chiefly\nin appearance. Nature has been very bountiful to us, and has given\nduplicates of some organs, that we may endure the loss of one of them,\nshould some such circumstance chance in our pilgrimage. See my poor\ndexter, abridged to one thumb, one finger, and a stump,--by the blow of\nmy adversary's weapon, however, and not by any carnificial knife. Weel,\nsir, this poor maimed hand doth me, in some sort, as much service as\never; and, admit yours to be taken off by the wrist, you have still your\nleft hand for your service, and are better off than the little Dutch\ndwarf here about town, who threads a needle, limns, writes, and tosses a\npike, merely by means of his feet, without ever a hand to help him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Sir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is all no doubt very\nconsolatory; but I hope the king will spare my hand to fight for him\nin battle, where, notwithstanding all your kind encouragement, I could\nspend my blood much more cheerfully than on a scaffold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is even a sad truth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Sir Mungo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat your lordship was\nbut too like to have died on a scaffold--not a soul to speak for you but\nthat deluded lassie Maggie Ramsay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhom mean you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, with more interest than he had hitherto\nshown in the Knight's communications.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, who should I mean, but that travestied lassie whom we dined with\nwhen we honoured Heriot the goldsmith? Ye ken best how you have made\ninterest with her, but I saw her on her knees to the king for you. She\nwas committed to my charge, to bring her up hither in honour and safety.\nHad I had my own will, I would have had her to Bridewell, to flog the\nwild blood out of her--a cutty quean, to think of wearing the breeches,\nand not so much as married yet!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHark ye, Sir Mungo Malagrowther,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would have you\ntalk of that young person with fitting respect.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith all the respect that befits your lordship's paramour, and Davy\nRamsay's daughter, I shall certainly speak of her, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir\nMungo, assuming a dry tone of irony.\n\nNigel was greatly disposed to have made a serious quarrel of it, but\nwith Sir Mungo such an affair would have been ridiculous; he smothered\nhis resentment, therefore, and conjured him to tell what he had heard\nand seen respecting this young person.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSimply, that I was in the ante-room when she had audience, and heard\nthe king say, to my great perplexity, '_Pulchra sane puella;_' and\nMaxwell, who hath but indifferent Latin ears, thought that his Majesty\ncalled on him by his own name of Sawney, and thrust into the presence,\nand there I saw our Sovereign James, with his own hand, raising up the\nlassie, who, as I said heretofore, was travestied in man's attire. I\nshould have had my own thoughts of it, but our gracious Master is auld,\nand was nae great gillravager amang the queans even in his youth; and\nhe was comforting her in his own way and saying,--'Ye needna greet about\nit, my bonnie woman, Glenvarlochides shall have fair play; and, indeed,\nwhen the hurry was off our spirits, we could not believe that he had\nany design on our person. And touching his other offences, we will look\nwisely and closely into the matter.' So I got charge to take the young\nfence-louper to the Tower here, and deliver her to the charge of Lady\nMansel; and his Majesty charged me to say not a word to her about your\noffences, for, said he, the poor thing is breaking her heart for him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd on this you have charitably founded the opinion to the prejudice\nof this young lady, which you have now thought proper to express?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nLord Glenvarloch.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn honest truth, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Sir Mungo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat opinion would you\nhave me form of a wench who gets into male habiliments, and goes on\nher knees to the king for a wild young nobleman? I wot not what the\nfashionable word may be, for the phrase changes, though the custom\nabides. But truly I must needs think this young leddy--if you call\nWatchie Ramsay's daughter a young leddy--demeans herself more like a\nleddy of pleasure than a leddy of honour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou do her egregious wrong, Sir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cor rather you have\nbeen misled by appearances.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo will all the world be misled, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the satirist,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cunless you were doing that to disabuse them which your father's son\nwill hardly judge it fit to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what may that be, I pray you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cE'en marry the lass--make her Leddy Glenvarloch.--Ay, ay, ye may\nstart--but it's the course you are driving on. Rather marry than do\nworse, if the worst be not done already.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI pray you to forbear this subject, and rather\nreturn to that of the mutilation, upon which it pleased you to enlarge a\nshort while since.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have not time at present,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Mungo, hearing the clock strike\nfour; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut so soon as you shall have received sentence, my lord, you may\nrely on my giving you the fullest detail of the whole solemnity; and I\ngive you my word, as a knight and a gentleman, that I will myself attend\nyou on the scaffold, whoever may cast sour looks on me for doing so. I\nbear a heart, to stand by a friend in the worst of times.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he wished Lord Glenvarloch farewell; who felt as heartily\nrejoiced at his departure, though it may be a bold word, as any person\nwho had ever undergone his society.\n\nBut, when left to his own reflections, Nigel could not help feeling\nsolitude nearly as irksome as the company of Sir Mungo Malagrowther. The\ntotal wreck of his fortune,--which seemed now to be rendered unavoidable\nby the loss of the royal warrant, that had afforded him the means of\nredeeming his paternal estate,--was an unexpected and additional blow.\nWhen he had seen the warrant he could not precisely remember; but was\ninclined to think, it was in the casket when he took out money to pay\nthe miser for his lodgings at Whitefriars. Since then, the casket had\nbeen almost constantly under his own eye, except during the short time\nhe was separated from his baggage by the arrest in Greenwich Park. It\nmight, indeed, have been taken out at that time, for he had no reason\nto think either his person or his property was in the hands of those who\nwished him well; but, on the other hand, the locks of the strong-box had\nsustained no violence that he could observe, and, being of a particular\nand complicated construction, he thought they could scarce be opened\nwithout an instrument made on purpose, adapted to their peculiarities,\nand for this there had been no time. But, speculate as he would on the\nmatter, it was clear that this important document was gone, and probable\nthat it had passed into no friendly hands. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet it be so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel\nto himself; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am scarcely worse off respecting my prospects of fortune,\nthan when I first reached this accursed city. But to be hampered with\ncruel accusations, and stained with foul suspicions-to be the object\nof pity of the most degrading kind to yonder honest citizen, and of the\nmalignity of that envious and atrabilarious courtier, who can endure\nthe good fortune and good qualities of another no more than the mole\ncan brook sunshine--this is indeed a deplorable reflection; and the\nconsequences must stick to my future life, and impede whatever my head,\nor my hand, if it is left me, might be able to execute in my favour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe feeling, that he is the object of general dislike and dereliction,\nseems to be one of the most unendurably painful to which a human being\ncan be subjected. The most atrocious criminals, whose nerves have not\nshrunk from perpetrating the most horrid cruelty, endure more from the\nconsciousness that no man will sympathise with their sufferings, than\nfrom apprehension of the personal agony of their impending punishment;\nand are known often to attempt to palliate their enormities, and\nsometimes altogether to deny what is established by the clearest proof,\nrather than to leave life under the general ban of humanity. It was no\nwonder that Nigel, labouring under the sense of general, though unjust\nsuspicion, should, while pondering on so painful a theme, recollect that\none, at least, had not only believed him innocent, but hazarded herself,\nwith all her feeble power, to interpose in his behalf.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPoor girl!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he repeated; \u00e2\u0080\u009cpoor, rash, but generous maiden! your fate is\nthat of her in Scottish story, who thrust her arm into the staple of\nthe door, to oppose it as a bar against the assassins who threatened the\nmurder of her sovereign. The deed of devotion was useless; save to give\nan immortal name to her by whom it was done, and whose blood flows, it\nis said, in the veins of my house.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI cannot explain to the reader, whether the recollection of this\nhistorical deed of devotion, and the lively effect which the comparison,\na little overstrained perhaps, was likely to produce in favour of\nMargaret Ramsay, was not qualified by the concomitant ideas of ancestry\nand ancient descent with which that recollection was mingled. But the\ncontending feelings suggested a new train of ideas.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAncestry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nthought, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand ancient descent, what are they to me?--My patrimony\nalienated--my title become a reproach--for what can be so absurd as\ntitled beggary?--my character subjected to suspicion,--I will not remain\nin this country; and should I, at leaving it, procure the society of one\nso lovely, so brave, and so faithful, who should say that I derogated\nfrom the rank which I am virtually renouncing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was something romantic and pleasing, as he pursued this picture of\nan attached and faithful pair, becoming all the world to each other,\nand stemming the tide of fate arm in arm; and to be linked thus with a\ncreature so beautiful, and who had taken such devoted and disinterested\nconcern in his fortunes, formed itself into such a vision as romantic\nyouth loves best to dwell upon.\n\nSuddenly his dream was painfully dispelled, by the recollection, that\nits very basis rested upon the most selfish ingratitude on his own part.\nLord of his castle and his towers, his forests and fields, his fair\npatrimony and noble name, his mind would have rejected, as a sort of\nimpossibility, the idea of elevating to his rank the daughter of a\nmechanic; but, when degraded from his nobility, and plunged into poverty\nand difficulties, he was ashamed to feel himself not unwilling, that\nthis poor girl, in the blindness of her affection, should abandon\nall the better prospects of her own settled condition, to embrace the\nprecarious and doubtful course which he himself was condemned to. The\ngenerosity of Nigel's mind recoiled from the selfishness of the plan of\nhappiness which he projected; and he made a strong effort to expel from\nhis thoughts for the rest of the evening this fascinating female, or, at\nleast, not to permit them to dwell upon the perilous circumstance, that\nshe was at present the only creature living who seemed to consider him\nas an object of kindness.\n\nHe could not, however, succeed in banishing her from his slumbers, when,\nafter having spent a weary day, he betook himself to a perturbed couch.\nThe form of Margaret mingled with the wild mass of dreams which his late\nadventures had suggested; and even when, copying the lively narrative of\nSir Mungo, fancy presented to him the blood bubbling and hissing on\nthe heated iron, Margaret stood behind him like a spirit of light, to\nbreathe healing on the wound. At length nature was exhausted by these\nfantastic creations, and Nigel slept, and slept soundly, until awakened\nin the morning by the sound of a well-known voice, which had often\nbroken his slumbers about the same hour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n\n  Many, come up, sir, with your gentle blood!\n  Here's a red stream beneath this coarse blue doublet,\n  That warms the heart as kindly as if drawn\n  From the far source of old Assyrian kings.\n  Who first made mankind subject to their sway.\n                           _Old Play_.\n\nThe sounds to which we alluded in our last, were no other than the\ngrumbling tones of Richie Moniplies's voice.\n\nThis worthy, like some other persons who rank high in their own opinion,\nwas very apt, when he could have no other auditor, to hold conversation\nwith one who was sure to be a willing listener--I mean with himself. He\nwas now brushing and arranging Lord Glenvarloch's clothes, with as\nmuch composure and quiet assiduity as if he had never been out of\nhis service, and grumbling betwixt whiles to the following\npurpose:--\u00e2\u0080\u009cHump--ay, time cloak and jerkin were through my hands--I\nquestion if horsehair has been passed over them since they and I last\nparted. The embroidery finely frayed too--and the gold buttons of the\ncloak--By my conscience, and as I am an honest man, there is a round\ndozen of them gane! This comes of Alsatian frolics--God keep us with\nhis grace, and not give us over to our own devices!--I see no sword--but\nthat will be in respect of present circumstances.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNigel for some time could not help believing that he was still in a\ndream, so improbable did it seem that his domestic, whom he supposed to\nbe in Scotland, should have found him out, and obtained access to him,\nin his present circumstances. Looking through the curtains, however,\nhe became well assured of the fact, when he beheld the stiff and bony\nlength of Richie, with a visage charged with nearly double its ordinary\ndegree of importance, employed sedulously in brushing his master's\ncloak, and refreshing himself with whistling or humming, from interval\nto interval, some snatch of an old melancholy Scottish ballad-tune.\nAlthough sufficiently convinced of the identity of the party, Lord\nGlenvarloch could not help expressing his surprise in the superfluous\nquestion--\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the name of Heaven, Richie, is this you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd wha else suld it be, my lord?\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Richie; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI dreamna that\nyour lordship's levee in this place is like to be attended by ony that\nare not bounded thereto by duty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am rather surprised,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat it should be attended by\nany one at all--especially by you, Richie; for you know that we parted,\nand I thought you had reached Scotland long since.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI crave your lordship's pardon, but we have not parted yet, nor are\nsoon likely so to do; for there gang twa folk's votes to the unmaking\nof a bargain, as to the making of ane. Though it was your lordship's\npleasure so to conduct yourself that we were like to have parted, yet\nit was not, on reflection, my will to be gone. To be plain, if your\nlordship does not ken when you have a good servant, I ken when I have a\nkind master; and to say truth, you will be easier served now than ever,\nfor there is not much chance of your getting out of bounds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am indeed bound over to good behaviour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, with\na smile; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I hope you will not take advantage of my situation to be\ntoo severe on my follies, Richie?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod forbid, my lord--God forbid!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Richie, with an expression\nbetwixt a conceited consciousness of superior wisdom and real\nfeeling--\u00e2\u0080\u009cespecially in consideration of your lordship's having a due\nsense of them. I did indeed remonstrate, as was my humble duty, but\nI scorn to cast that up to your lordship now--Na, na, I am myself an\nerring creature--very conscious of some small weaknesses--there is no\nperfection in man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, Richie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009calthough I am much obliged to you\nfor your proffered service, it can be of little use to me here, and may\nbe of prejudice to yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour lordship shall pardon me again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, whom the relative\nsituation of the parties had invested with ten times his ordinary\ndogmatism; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut as I will manage the matter, your lordship shall be\ngreatly benefited by my service, and I myself no whit prejudiced.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see not how that can be, my friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009csince\neven as to your pecuniary affairs--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTouching my pecuniars, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am indifferently\nweel provided; and, as it chances, my living here will be no burden to\nyour lordship, or distress to myself. Only I crave permission to annex\ncertain conditions to my servitude with your lordship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnnex what you will,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor you are pretty sure\nto take your own way, whether you make any conditions or not. Since you\nwill not leave me, which were, I think, your wisest course, you must,\nand I suppose will, serve me only on such terms as you like yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll that I ask, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, gravely, and with a tone of\ngreat moderation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis to have the uninterrupted command of my own\nmotions, for certain important purposes which I have now in hand, always\ngiving your lordship the solace of my company and attendance, at such\ntimes as may be at once convenient for me, and necessary for your\nservice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf which, I suppose, you constitute yourself sole judge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied\nNigel, smiling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnquestionably, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Richie, gravely; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor your lordship\ncan only know what yourself want; whereas I, who see both sides of the\npicture, ken both what is the best for your affairs, and what is the\nmost needful for my own.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRichie, my good friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI fear this arrangement, which\nplaces the master much under the disposal of the servant, would scarce\nsuit us if we were both at large; but a prisoner as I am, I may be as\nwell at your disposal as I am at that of so many other persons; and\nso you may come and go as you list, for I suppose you will not take my\nadvice, to return to your own country, and leave me to my fate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe deil be in my feet if I do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Moniplies,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not the lad to\nleave your lordship in foul weather, when I followed you and fed upon\nyou through the whole summer day, And besides, there may be brave days\nbehind, for a' that has come and gane yet; for\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's hame, and it's hame, and it's hame we fain would be, Though the\ncloud is in the lift, and the wind is on the lea; For the sun through\nthe mirk blinks blithe on mine ee, Says,--'I'll shine on ye yet in our\nain country!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaving sung this stanza in the manner of a ballad-singer, whose voice\nhas been cracked by matching his windpipe against the bugle of the north\nblast, Richie Moniplies aided Lord Glenvarloch to rise, attended his\ntoilet with every possible mark of the most solemn and deferential\nrespect, then waited upon him at breakfast, and finally withdrew,\npleading that he had business of importance, which would detain him for\nsome hours.\n\nAlthough Lord Glenvarloch necessarily expected to be occasionally\nannoyed by the self-conceit and dogmatism of Richie Moniplies's\ncharacter, yet he could not but feel the greatest pleasure from the firm\nand devoted attachment which this faithful follower had displayed in\nthe present instance, and indeed promised himself an alleviation of the\nennui of his imprisonment, in having the advantage of his services. It\nwas, therefore, with pleasure that he learned from the warder, that\nhis servant's attendance would be allowed at all times when the general\nrules of the fortress permitted the entrance of strangers.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the magnanimous Richie Moniplies had already reached\nTower Wharf. Here, after looking with contempt on several scullers by\nwhom he was plied, and whose services he rejected with a wave of his\nhand, he called with dignity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst oars!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and stirred into activity\nseveral lounging Tritons of the higher order, who had not, on his\nfirst appearance, thought it worth while to accost him with proffers of\nservice. He now took possession of a wherry, folded his arms within his\nample cloak, and sitting down in the stern with an air of importance,\ncommanded them to row to Whitehall Stairs. Having reached the Palace\nin safety, he demanded to see Master Linklater, the under-clerk of his\nMajesty's kitchen. The reply was, that he was not to be spoken withal,\nbeing then employed in cooking a mess of cock-a-leekie for the king's\nown mouth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Moniplies, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat it is a dear countryman of his, who\nseeks to converse with him on matter of high import.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA dear countryman?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Linklater, when this pressing message was\ndelivered to him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, let him come in and be d--d, that I should say\nsae! This now is some red-headed, long-legged, gillie-white-foot\nfrae the West Port, that, hearing of my promotion, is come up to be\na turn-broche, or deputy scullion, through my interest. It is a great\nhinderance to any man who would rise in the world, to have such friends\nto hang by his skirts, in hope of being towed up along with him.--Ha!\nRichie Moniplies, man, is it thou? And what has brought ye here? If they\nshould ken thee for the loon that scared the horse the other day!--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo more o' that, neighbour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am just here on the auld\nerrand--I maun speak with the king.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe king? Ye are red wud,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Linklater; then shouted to his\nassistant in the kitchen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook to the broches, ye knaves--_pisces\npurga_--_Salsamenta fac macerentur pulchre_--I will make you understand\nLatin, ye knaves, as becomes the scullions of King James.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then in a\ncautious tone, to Richie's private ear, he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cKnow ye not how\nill your master came off the other day?--I can tell you that job made\nsome folk shake for their office.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWeel, but, Laurie, ye maun befriend me this time, and get this wee\nbit sifflication slipped into his Majesty's ain most gracious hand. I\npromise you the contents will be most grateful to him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRichie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Linklater, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have certainly sworn to say your\nprayers in the porter's lodge, with your back bare; and twa grooms, with\ndog-whips, to cry amen to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNa, na, Laurie, lad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI ken better what belangs to\nsifflications than I did yon day; and ye will say that yoursell, if ye\nwill but get that bit note to the king's hand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will have neither hand nor foot in the matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the cautious\nClerk of the Kitchen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut there is his Majesty's mess of cock-a-leekie\njust going to be served to him in his closet--I cannot prevent you from\nputting the letter between the gilt bowl and the platter; his sacred\nMajesty will see it when he lifts the bowl, for he aye drinks out the\nbroth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEnough said,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Richie, and deposited the paper accordingly, just\nbefore a page entered to carry away the mess to his Majesty.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAweel, aweel, neighbour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Laurence, when the mess was taken\naway, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif ye have done ony thing to bring yoursell to the withy, or the\nscourging post, it is your ain wilful deed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will blame no other for it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie; and with that undismayed\npertinacity of conceit, which made a fundamental part of his character,\nhe abode the issue, which was not long of arriving.\n\nIn a few minutes Maxwell himself arrived in the apartment, and demanded\nhastily who had placed a writing on the king's trencher, Linklater\ndenied all knowledge of it; but Richie Moniplies, stepping boldly forth,\npronounced the emphatical confession, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am the man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFollow me, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Maxwell, after regarding him with a look of\ngreat curiosity.\n\nThey went up a private staircase,--even that private staircase, the\nprivilege of which at Court is accounted a nearer road to power than the\n_grandes entrees_ themselves. Arriving in what Richie described as an\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cill redd-up\u00e2\u0080\u009d ante-room, the usher made a sign to him to stop, while he\nwent into the king's closet. Their conference was short, and as Maxwell\nopened the door to retire, Richie heard the conclusion of it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe are sure he is not dangerous?--I was caught once.--Bide within call,\nbut not nearer the door than within three geometrical cubits. If I speak\nloud, start to me like a falcon--If I speak loun, keep your lang lugs\nout of ear-shot--and now let him come in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRichie passed forward at Maxwell's mute signal, and in a moment found\nhimself in the presence of the king. Most men of Richie's birth and\nbreeding, and many others, would have been abashed at finding themselves\nalone with their Sovereign. But Richie Moniplies had an opinion of\nhimself too high to be controlled by any such ideas; and having made his\nstiff reverence, he arose once more into his perpendicular height, and\nstood before James as stiff as a hedge-stake.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave ye gotten them, man? have ye gotten them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, in\na fluttered state, betwixt hope and eagerness, and some touch of\nsuspicious fear. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGie me them--gie me them--before ye speak a word, I\ncharge you, on your allegiance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRichie took a box from his bosom, and, stooping on one knee, presented\nit to his Majesty, who hastily opened it, and having ascertained that\nit contained a certain carcanet of rubies, with which the reader was\nformerly made acquainted, he could not resist falling into a sort of\nrapture, kissing the gems, as if they had been capable of feeling,\nand repeating again and again with childish delight, \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Onyx cum prole,\nsilexque_---_Onyx cum prole!_ Ah, my bright and bonny sparklers, my\nheart loups light to see you again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He then turned to Richie, upon\nwhose stoical countenance his Majesty's demeanour had excited something\nlike a grim smile, which James interrupted his rejoicing to reprehend,\nsaying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTake heed, sir, you are not to laugh at us--we are your\nanointed Sovereign.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod forbid that I should laugh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, composing his countenance\ninto its natural rigidity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI did but smile, to bring my visage into\ncoincidence and conformity with your Majesty's physiognomy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe speak as a dutiful subject, and an honest man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut\nwhat deil's your name, man?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven Richie Moniplies, the son of auld Mungo Moniplies, at the West\nPort of Edinburgh, who had the honour to supply your Majesty's mother's\nroyal table, as weel as your Majesty's, with flesh and other vivers,\nwhen time was.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAha!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, laughing,--for he possessed, as a useful attribute\nof his situation, a tenacious memory, which recollected every one with\nwhom he was brought into casual contact,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe are the self-same traitor\nwho had weelnigh coupit us endlang on the causey of our ain courtyard?\nbut we stuck by our mare. _Equam memento rebus in arduis servare_. Weel,\nbe not dismayed, Richie; for, as many men have turned traitors, it\nis but fair that a traitor, now and then, suld prove to be, contra\nexpectanda, a true man. How cam ye by our jewels, man?--cam ye on the\npart of George Heriot?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn no sort,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMay it please your Majesty, I come as\nHarry Wynd fought, utterly for my own hand, and on no man's errand; as,\nindeed, I call no one master, save Him that made me, your most\ngracious Majesty who governs me, and the noble Nigel Olifaunt, Lord of\nGlenvarloch, who maintained me as lang as he could maintain himself,\npoor nobleman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGlenvarlochides again!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cby my honour, he lies in\nambush for us at every corner!--Maxwell knocks at the door. It is George\nHeriot come to tell us he cannot find these jewels.--Get thee behind\nthe arras, Richie--stand close, man--sneeze not--cough not--breathe\nnot!--Jingling Geordie is so damnably ready with his gold-ends of\nwisdom, and sae accursedly backward with his gold-ends of siller, that,\nby our royal saul, we are glad to get a hair in his neck.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRichie got behind the arras, in obedience to the commands of the\ngood-natured king, while the Monarch, who never allowed his dignity to\nstand in the way of a frolic, having adjusted, with his own hand, the\ntapestry, so as to complete the ambush, commanded Maxwell to tell him\nwhat was the matter without. Maxwell's reply was so low as to be lost by\nRichie Moniplies, the peculiarity of whose situation by no means abated\nhis curiosity and desire to gratify it to the uttermost.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet Geordie Heriot come in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king; and, as Richie could\nobserve through a slit in the tapestry, the honest citizen, if not\nactually agitated, was at least discomposed. The king, whose talent for\nwit, or humour, was precisely of a kind to be gratified by such a scene\nas ensued, received his homage with coldness, and began to talk to him\nwith an air of serious dignity, very different from the usual indecorous\nlevity of his behaviour. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster Heriot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif we aright\nremember, we opignorated in your hands certain jewels of the Crown, for\na certain sum of money--Did we, or did we not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy most gracious Sovereign,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cindisputably your Majesty\nwas pleased to do so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe property of which jewels and _cimelia_ remained with us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued\nthe king, in the same solemn tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009csubject only to your claim of\nadvance thereupon; which advance being repaid, gives us right to\nrepossession of the thing opignorated, or pledged, or laid in wad.\nVoetius, Vinnius, Groenwigeneus, Pagenstecherus,--all who have treated\n_de Contractu Opignerationis, consentiunt in eundem_,--gree on the same\npoint. The Roman law, the English common law, and the municipal law\nof our ain ancient kingdom of Scotland, though they split in mair\nparticulars than I could desire, unite as strictly in this as the three\nstrands of a twisted rope.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay it please your Majesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit requires not so many\nlearned authorities to prove to any honest man, that his interest in a\npledge is determined when the money lent is restored.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWeel, sir, I proffer restoration of the sum lent, and I demand to be\nrepossessed of the jewels pledged with you. I gave ye a hint, brief\nwhile since, that this would be essential to my service, for, as\napproaching events are like to call us into public, it would seem\nstrange if we did not appear with those ornaments, which are heirlooms\nof the Crown, and the absence whereof is like to place us in contempt\nand suspicion with our liege subjects.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMaster George Heriot seemed much moved by this address of his Sovereign,\nand replied with emotion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI call Heaven to witness, that I am totally\nharmless in this matter, and that I would willingly lose the sum\nadvanced, so that I could restore those jewels, the absence of which\nyour Majesty so justly laments. Had the jewels remained with me, the\naccount of them would be easily rendered; but your Majesty will do me\nthe justice to remember, that, by your express order, I transferred them\nto another person, who advanced a large sum, just about the time of my\ndeparture for Paris. The money was pressingly wanted, and no other means\nto come by it occurred to me. I told your Majesty, when I brought the\nneedful supply, that the man from whom the monies were obtained, was\nof no good repute; and your most princely answer was, smelling to the\ngold--_Non olet_, it smells not of the means that have gotten it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWeel, man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut what needs a' this din? If ye gave my\njewels in pledge to such a one, suld ye not, as a liege subject, have\ntaken care that the redemption was in our power? And are we to suffer\nthe loss of our _cimelia_ by your neglect, besides being exposed to the\nscorn and censure of our lieges, and of the foreign ambassadors?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord and liege king,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod knows, if my bearing blame\nor shame in this matter would keep it from your Majesty, it were my duty\nto endure both, as a servant grateful for many benefits; but when\nyour Majesty considers the violent death of the man himself, the\ndisappearance of his daughter, and of his wealth, I trust you will\nremember that I warned your Majesty, in humble duty, of the possibility\nof such casualties, and prayed you not to urge me to deal with him on\nyour behalf.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you brought me nae better means,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king--\u00e2\u0080\u009cGeordie, ye\nbrought me nae better means. I was like a deserted man; what could I do\nbut grip to the first siller that offered, as a drowning man grasps to\nthe willow-wand that comes readiest?--And now, man, what for have ye not\nbrought back the jewels? they are surely above ground, if ye wad make\nstrict search.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll strict search has been made, may it please your Majesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied\nthe citizen; \u00e2\u0080\u009chue and cry has been sent out everywhere, and it has been\nfound impossible to recover them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDifficult, ye mean, Geordie, not impossible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor\nthat whilk is impossible, is either naturally so, _exempli gratia_, to\nmake two into three; or morally so, as to make what is truth falsehood;\nbut what is only difficult may come to pass, with assistance of wisdom\nand patience; as, for example, Jingling Geordie, look here!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he\ndisplayed the recovered treasure to the eyes of the astonished jeweller,\nexclaiming, with great triumph, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat say ye to that, Jingler?--By my\nsceptre and crown, the man stares as if he took his native prince for a\nwarlock! us that are the very _malleus maleficarum_, the contunding\nand contriturating hammer of all witches, sorcerers, magicians, and the\nlike; he thinks we are taking a touch of the black art outsells!--But\ngang thy way, honest Geordie; thou art a good plain man, but nane of the\nseven sages of Greece; gang thy way, and mind the soothfast word which\nyou spoke, small time syne, that there is one in this land that comes\nnear to Solomon, King of Israel, in all his gifts, except in his love to\nstrange women, forby the daughter of Pharaoh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIf Heriot was surprised at seeing the jewels so unexpectedly produced\nat the moment the king was upbraiding him for the loss of them, this\nallusion to the reflection which had escaped him while conversing with\nLord Glenvarloch, altogether completed his astonishment; and the king\nwas so delighted with the superiority which it gave him at the moment,\nthat he rubbed his hands, chuckled, and finally, his sense of dignity\ngiving way to the full feeling of triumph, he threw himself into his\neasy-chair, and laughed with unconstrained violence till he lost his\nbreath, and the tears ran plentifully down his cheeks as he strove\nto recover it. Meanwhile, the royal cachinnation was echoed out by a\ndiscordant and portentous laugh from behind the arras, like that of one\nwho, little accustomed to give way to such emotions, feels himself\nat some particular impulse unable either to control or to modify his\nobstreperous mirth. Heriot turned his head with new surprise towards the\nplace, from which sounds so unfitting the presence of a monarch seemed\nto burst with such emphatic clamour.\n\nThe king, too, somewhat sensible of the indecorum, rose up, wiped his\neyes, and calling,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cTodlowrie, come out o' your den,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he produced from\nbehind the arras the length of Richie Moniplies, still laughing with as\nunrestrained mirth as ever did gossip at a country christening. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhisht,\nman, whisht, man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cye needna nicher that gait, like a\ncusser at a caup o' corn, e'en though it was a pleasing jest, and our\nain framing. And yet to see Jingling Geordie, that bauds himself so\nmuch the wiser than other folk--to see him, ha! ha! ha!--in the vein of\nEuclio apud Plautum, distressing himself to recover what was lying at\nhis elbow--'Peril, interii, occidi--quo curram? quo non curram?--Tene,\ntene--quem? quis? nescio--nihil video.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! Geordie, your een are sharp enough to look after gowd and silver,\ngems, rubies, and the like of that, and yet ye kenna how to come by them\nwhen they are lost.--Ay, ay--look at them, man--look at them--they are\na' right and tight, sound and round, not a doublet crept in amongst\nthem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGeorge Heriot, when his first surprise was over, was too old a courtier\nto interrupt the king's imaginary triumph, although he darted a look\nof some displeasure at honest Richie, who still continued on what is\nusually termed the broad grin. He quietly examined the stones, and\nfinding them all perfect, he honestly and sincerely congratulated his\nMajesty on the recovery of a treasure which could not have been lost\nwithout some dishonour to the crown; and asked to whom he himself was to\npay the sums for which they had been pledged, observing, that he had the\nmoney by him in readiness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe are in a deevil of a hurry, when there is paying in the case,\nGeordie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat's a' the haste, man? The jewels were\nrestored by an honest, kindly countryman of ours. There he stands, and\nwha kens if he wants the money on the nail, or if he might not be as\nweel pleased wi' a bit rescript on our treasury some six months hence?\nYe ken that our Exchequer is even at a low ebb just now, and ye cry pay,\npay, pay, as if we had all the mines of Ophir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease your Majesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif this man has the real right to\nthese monies, it is doubtless at his will to grant forbearance, if he\nwill. But when I remember the guise in which I first saw him, with a\ntattered cloak and a broken head, I can hardly conceive it.--Are not you\nRichie Moniplies, with the king's favour?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven sae, Master Heriot--of the ancient and honourable house of Castle\nCollop, near to the West Port of Edinburgh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Richie.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, please your Majesty, he is a poor serving-man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis\nmoney can never be honestly at his disposal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat for no?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWad ye have naebody spraickle up the brae\nbut yoursell, Geordie? Your ain cloak was thin enough when ye cam here,\nthough ye have lined it gay and weel. And for serving-men, there has\nmony a red-shank cam over the Tweed wi' his master's wallet on his\nshoulders, that now rustles it wi' his six followers behind him. There\nstands the man himsell; speer at him, Geordie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis may not be the best authority in the case,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the cautious\ncitizen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTut, tut, man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, \u00e2\u0080\u009cye are over scrupulous. The knave\ndeer-stealers have an apt phrase, _Non est inquirendum unde venit_\nVENISON. He that brings the gudes hath surely a right to dispose of\nthe gear.--Hark ye, friend, speak the truth and shame the deil. Have\nye plenary powers to dispose on the redemption-money as to delay of\npayments, or the like, ay or no?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFull power, an it like your gracious Majesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Richie\nMoniplies; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I am maist willing to subscrive to whatsoever may in ony\nwise accommodate your Majesty anent the redemption-money, trusting your\nMajesty's grace will be kind to me in one sma' favour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEy, man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccome ye to me there? I thought ye wad e'en\nbe like the rest of them.--One would think our subjects' lives and goods\nwere all our ain, and holden of us at our free will; but when we stand\nin need of ony matter of siller from them, which chances more frequently\nthan we would it did, deil a boddle is to be had, save on the auld terms\nof giff-gaff. It is just niffer for niffer.--Aweel, neighbour, what\nis it that ye want--some monopoly, I reckon? Or it may be a grant\nof kirk-lands and teinds, or a knighthood, or the like? Ye maun be\nreasonable, unless ye propose to advance more money for our present\noccasions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy liege,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Richie Moniplies, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe owner of these monies places\nthem at your Majesty's command, free of all pledge or usage as long as\nit is your royal pleasure, providing your Majesty will condescend to\nshow some favour to the noble Lord Glenvarloch, presently prisoner in\nyour royal Tower of London.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow, man--how,--man--how, man!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the king, reddening and\nstammering, but with emotions more noble than those by which he was\nsometimes agitated--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is that you dare to say to us?--Sell our\njustice!--sell our mercy!--and we a crowned king, sworn to do justice\nto our subjects in the gate, and responsible for our stewardship to\nHim that is over all kings?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--Here he reverently looked up, touched his\nbonnet, and continued, with some sharpness,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe dare not traffic in\nsuch commodities, sir; and, but that ye are a poor ignorant creature,\nthat have done us this day some not unpleasant service, we wad have a\nred iron driven through your tongue, _in terrorem_ of others.--Awa with\nhim, Geordie,--pay him, plack and bawbee, out of our monies in your\nhands, and let them care that come ahint.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRichie, who had counted with the utmost certainty upon the success\nof this master-stroke of policy, was like an architect whose whole\nscaffolding at once gives way under him. He caught, however, at what\nhe thought might break his fall. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot only the sum for which the jewels\nwere pledged,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut the double of it, if required, should be\nplaced at his Majesty's command, and even without hope or condition of\nrepayment, if only--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut the king did not allow him to complete the sentence, crying out with\ngreater vehemence than before, as if he dreaded the stability of his own\ngood resolutions,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAwa wi' him--swith awa wi' him! It is time he\nwere gane, if he doubles his bode that gate. And, for your life, letna\nSteenie, or ony of them, hear a word from his mouth; for wha kens what\ntrouble that might bring me into! _Ne inducas in tentationem_--_Vade\nretro, Sathanas!--Amen_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn obedience to the royal mandate, George Heriot hurried the abashed\npetitioner out of the presence and out of the Palace; and, when they\nwere in the Palace-yard, the citizen, remembering with some resentment\nthe airs of equality which Richie had assumed towards him in the\ncommencement of the scene which had just taken place, could not forbear\nto retaliate, by congratulating him with an ironical smile on his favour\nat Court, and his improved grace in presenting a supplication.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever fash your beard about that, Master George Heriot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie,\ntotally undismayed; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut tell me when and where I am to sifflicate\nyou for eight hundred pounds sterling, for which these jewels stood\nengaged?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe instant that you bring with you the real owner of the money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n replied Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhom it is important that I should see on more accounts\nthan one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen will I back to his Majesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie Moniplies, stoutly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand\nget either the money or the pledge back again. I am fully commissionate\nto act in that matter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt may be so, Richie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the citizen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand perchance it may _not_\nbe so neither, for your tales are not all gospel; and, therefore, be\nassured I will see that it _is_ so, ere I pay you that large sum of\nmoney. I shall give you an acknowledgment for it, and I will keep it\nprestable at a moment's warning. But, my good Richard Moniplies, of\nCastle Collop, near the West Port of Edinburgh, in the meantime I am\nbound to return to his Majesty on matters of weight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So speaking, and\nmounting the stair to re-enter the Palace, he added, by way of summing\nup the whole,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cGeorge Heriot is over old a cock to be caught with\nchaff.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRichie stood petrified when he beheld him re-enter the Palace, and found\nhimself, as he supposed, left in the lurch.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, plague on ye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nmuttered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor a cunning auld skinflint! that, because ye are an honest\nman yoursell, forsooth, must needs deal with all the world as if they\nwere knaves. But deil be in me if ye beat me yet!--Gude guide us!\nyonder comes Laurie Linklater next, and he will be on me about the\nsifflication.--I winna stand him, by Saint Andrew!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, and changing the haughty stride with which he had that\nmorning entered the precincts of the Palace, into a skulking shamble, he\nretreated for his wherry, which was in attendance, with speed which, to\nuse the approved phrase on such occasions, greatly resembled a flight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n\n_Benedict_. This looks not like a nuptial. _Much Ado About Nothing._\n\nMaster George Heriot had no sooner returned to the king's apartment,\nthan James inquired of Maxwell if the Earl of Huntinglen was in\nattendance, and, receiving an answer in the affirmative, desired that he\nshould be admitted. The old Scottish Lord having made his reverence\nin the usual manner, the king extended his hand to be kissed, and then\nbegan to address him in a tone of great sympathy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe told your lordship in our secret epistle of this morning, written\nwith our ain hand, in testimony we have neither pretermitted nor\nforgotten your faithful service, that we had that to communicate to you\nthat would require both patience and fortitude to endure, and therefore\nexhorted you to peruse some of the most pithy passages of Seneca, and of\nBoethius _de Consolatione_, that the back may be, as we say, fitted for\nthe burden--This we commend to you from our ain experience.\n\n     'Non ignara mail, miseris succurrere disco,'\n\nsayeth Dido, and I might say in my own person, _non ignarus_; but\nto change the gender would affect the prosody, whereof our southern\nsubjects are tenacious. So, my Lord of Huntinglen, I trust you have\nacted by our advice, and studied patience before ye need it--_venienti\noccurrite morbo_--mix the medicament when the disease is coming on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay it please your Majesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lord Huntinglen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am more of an\nold soldier than a scholar--and if my own rough nature will not bear\nme out in any calamity, I hope I shall have grace to try a text of\nScripture to boot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, man, are you there with your bears?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Bible,\nman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d (touching his cap,) \u00e2\u0080\u009cis indeed _principium et fons_--but it is\npity your lordship cannot peruse it in the original. For although we did\nourselves promote that work of translation,--since ye may read, at the\nbeginning of every Bible, that when some palpable clouds of darkness\nwere thought like to have overshadowed the land, after the setting of\nthat bright occidental star, Queen Elizabeth; yet our appearance, like\nthat of the sun in his strength, instantly dispelled these surmised\nmists,--I say, that although, as therein mentioned, we countenanced\nthe preaching of the gospel, and especially the translation of the\nScriptures out of the original sacred tongues; yet nevertheless, we\nourselves confess to have found a comfort in consulting them in the\noriginal Hebrew, whilk we do not perceive even in the Latin version of\nthe Septuagint, much less in the English traduction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease your Majesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Huntinglen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif your Majesty delays\ncommunicating the bad news with which your honoured letter threatens me,\nuntil I am capable to read Hebrew like your Majesty, I fear I shall\ndie in ignorance of the misfortune which hath befallen, or is about to\nbefall, my house.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will learn it but too soon, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the king. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI grieve\nto say it, but your son Dalgarno, whom I thought a very saint, as he was\nso much with Steenie and Baby Charles, hath turned out a very villain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVillain!\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated Lord Huntinglen; and though he instantly checked\nhimself, and added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it is your Majesty speaks the word,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the effect\nof his first tone made the king step back as if he had received a blow.\nHe also recovered himself again, and said in the pettish way which\nusually indicated his displeasure--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, my lord, it was we that said\nit--_non surdo canis_--we are not deaf--we pray you not to raise your\nvoice in speech with us--there is the bonny memorial--read, and judge\nfor yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe king then thrust into the old nobleman's hand a paper, containing\nthe story of the Lady Hermione, with the evidence by which it was\nsupported, detailed so briefly and clearly, that the infamy of Lord\nDalgarno, the lover by whom she had been so shamefully deceived, seemed\nundeniable. But a father yields not up so easily the cause of his son.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay it please your Majesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy was this tale not sooner\ntold? This woman hath been here for years--wherefore was the claim on my\nson not made the instant she touched English ground?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell him how that came about, Geordie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, dressing Heriot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI grieve to distress my Lord Huntinglen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I must speak\nthe truth. For a long time the Lady Hermione could not brook the idea\nof making her situation public; and when her mind became changed in\nthat particular, it was necessary to recover the evidence of the false\nmarriage, and letters and papers connected with it, which, when she\ncame to Paris, and just before I saw her, she had deposited with a\ncorrespondent of her father in that city. He became afterwards bankrupt,\nand in consequence of that misfortune the lady's papers passed into\nother hands, and it was only a few days since I traced and recovered\nthem. Without these documents of evidence, it would have been imprudent\nfor her to have preferred her complaint, favoured as Lord Dalgarno is by\npowerful friends.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe are saucy to say sae,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI ken what ye mean weel\neneugh--ye think Steenie wad hae putten the weight of his foot into\nthe scales of justice, and garr'd them whomle the bucket--ye forget,\nGeordie, wha it is whose hand uphaulds them. And ye do poor Steenie the\nmair wrang, for he confessed it ance before us and our privy council,\nthat Dalgarno would have put the quean aff on him, the puir simple\nbairn, making him trow that she was a light-o'-love; in whilk mind he\nremained assured even when he parted from her, albeit Steenie might hae\nweel thought ane of thae cattle wadna hae resisted the like of him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Lady Hermione,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009chas always done the utmost\njustice to the conduct of the duke, who, although strongly possessed\nwith prejudice against her character, yet scorned to avail himself\nof her distress, and on the contrary supplied her with the means of\nextricating herself from her difficulties.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was e'en like himsell--blessings on his bonny face!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand I believed this lady's tale the mair readily, my Lord Huntinglen,\nthat she spake nae ill of Steenie--and to make a lang tale short, my\nlord, it is the opinion of our council and ourself, as weel as of Baby\nCharles and Steenie, that your son maun amend his wrong by wedding this\nlady, or undergo such disgrace and discountenance as we can bestow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe person to whom he spoke was incapable of answering him. He stood\nbefore the king motionless, and glaring with eyes of which even the lids\nseemed immovable, as if suddenly converted into an ancient statue of the\ntimes of chivalry, so instantly had his hard features and strong limbs\nbeen arrested into rigidity by the blow he had received--And in a second\nafterwards, like the same statue when the lightning breaks upon it,\nhe sunk at once to the ground with a heavy groan. The king was in the\nutmost alarm, called upon Heriot and Maxwell for help, and, presence\nof mind not being his _forte_, ran to and fro in his cabinet,\nexclaiming--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy ancient and beloved servant--who saved our anointed\nself! _vae atque dolor!_ My Lord of Huntinglen, look up--look up, man,\nand your son may marry the Queen of Sheba if he will.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBy this time Maxwell and Heriot had raised the old nobleman, and placed\nhim on a chair; while the king, observing that he began to recover\nhimself, continued his consolations more methodically.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaud up your head--haud up your head, and listen to your ain kind\nnative Prince. If there is shame, man, it comesna empty-handed--there\nis siller to gild it--a gude tocher, and no that bad a pedigree;--if she\nhas been a loon, it was your son made her sae, and he can make her an\nhonest woman again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThese suggestions, however reasonable in the common case, gave no\ncomfort to Lord Huntinglen, if indeed he fully comprehended them; but\nthe blubbering of his good-natured old master, which began to accompany\nand interrupt his royal speech, produced more rapid effect. The large\ntear gushed reluctantly from his eye, as he kissed the withered hands,\nwhich the king, weeping with less dignity and restraint, abandoned to\nhim, first alternately and then both together, until the feelings of the\nman getting entirely the better of the Sovereign's sense of dignity, he\ngrasped and shook Lord Huntinglen's hands with the sympathy of an equal\nand a familiar friend.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Compone lachrymas_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Monarch; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbe patient, man, be patient;\nthe council, and Baby Charles, and Steenie, may a' gang to the\ndeevil--he shall not marry her since it moves you so deeply.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe _shall_ marry her, by God!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the earl, drawing himself\nup, dashing the tear from his eyes, and endeavouring to recover his\ncomposure. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI pray your Majesty's pardon, but he shall marry her, with\nher dishonour for her dowry, were she the veriest courtezan in all\nSpain--If he gave his word, he shall make his word good, were it to\nthe meanest creature that haunts the streets--he shall do it, or my own\ndagger shall take the life that I gave him. If he could stoop to use so\nbase a fraud, though to deceive infamy, let him wed infamy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Monarch continued to insinuate, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthings are not so bad as\nthat--Steenie himself never thought of her being a streetwalker, even\nwhen he thought the worst of her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it can at all console my Lord of Huntinglen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the citizen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\ncan assure him of this lady's good birth, and most fair and unspotted\nfame.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sorry for it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Huntinglen--then interrupting himself, he\nsaid--\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeaven forgive me for being ungrateful for such comfort!--but I\nam well-nigh sorry she should be as you represent her, so much better\nthan the villain deserves. To be condemned to wed beauty and innocence\nand honest birth--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, and wealth, my lord--wealth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d insinuated the king, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis a better\nsentence than his perfidy has deserved.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is long,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the embittered father, \u00e2\u0080\u009csince I saw he was selfish\nand hardhearted; but to be a perjured liar--I never dreaded that such a\nblot would have fallen on my race! I will never look on him again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHoot ay, my lord, hoot ay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cye maun tak him to task\nroundly. I grant you should speak more in the vein of Demea than Mitio,\n_vi nempe et via pervulgata patrum_; but as for not seeing him again,\nand he your only son, that is altogether out of reason. I tell ye, man,\n(but I would not for a boddle that Baby Charles heard me,) that he might\ngie the glaiks to half the lasses of Lonnun, ere I could find in my\nheart speak such harsh words as you have said of this deil of a Dalgarno\nof yours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay it please your Majesty to permit me to retire,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord\nHuntinglen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand dispose of the case according to your own royal sense\nof justice, for I desire no favour for him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAweel, my lord, so be it; and if your lordship can think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added the\nMonarch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cof any thing in our power which might comfort you--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Majesty's gracious sympathy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Huntinglen, \u00e2\u0080\u009chas already\ncomforted me as far as earth can; the rest must be from the King of\nkings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo Him I commend you, my auld and faithful servant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said James with\nemotion, as the earl withdrew from his presence. The king remained fixed\nin thought for some time, and then said to Heriot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cJingling Geordie,\nye ken all the privy doings of our Court, and have dune so these thirty\nyears, though, like a wise man, ye hear, and see, and say nothing.\nNow, there is a thing I fain wad ken, in the way of philosophical\ninquiry--Did you ever hear of the umquhile Lady Huntinglen, the departed\nCountess of this noble earl, ganging a wee bit gleed in her walk through\nthe world; I mean in the way of slipping a foot, casting a leglin-girth,\nor the like, ye understand me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[Footnote: A leglin-girth is the lowest hoop upon a _leglin_, or\nmilk-pail. Allan Ramsay applies the phrase in the same metaphorical\nsense.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOr bairns can read, they first maun spell, I learn'd this frae my\nmammy, And cast a leglin-girth mysell,\n Lang ere I married Tammy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n                               _Christ's Kirk On The Green_.]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn my word as an honest man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George Heriot, somewhat surprised\nat the question, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never heard her wronged by the slightest breath\nof suspicion. She was a worthy lady, very circumspect in her walk, and\nlived in great concord with her husband, save that the good Countess was\nsomething of a puritan, and kept more company with ministers than was\naltogether agreeable to Lord Huntinglen, who is, as your Majesty well\nknows, a man of the old rough world, that will drink and swear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO Geordie!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the king, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthese are auld-warld frailties, of\nwhilk we dare not pronounce even ourselves absolutely free. But the\nwarld grows worse from day to day, Geordie. The juveniles of this age\nmay weel say with the poet--\n\n     'Aetas parentum, pejor avis, tulit Nos nequiores--'\n\nThis Dalgarno does not drink so much, or swear so much, as his father;\nbut he wenches, Geordie, and he breaks his word and oath baith. As\nto what you say of the leddy, and the ministers, we are a' fallible\ncreatures, Geordie, priests and kings, as weel as others; and wha kens\nbut what that may account for the difference between this Dalgarno and\nhis father? The earl is the vera soul of honour, and cares nae mair for\nwarld's gear than a noble hound for the quest of a foulmart; but as\nfor his son, he was like to brazen us a' out--ourselves, Steenie, Baby\nCharles, and our council--till he heard of the tocher, and then, by my\nkingly crown, he lap like a cock at a grossart! These are discrepancies\nbetwixt parent and son not to be accounted for naturally, according to\nBaptista Porta, Michael Scott _de secretis_, and others.--Ah, Jingling\nGeordie, if your clouting the caldron, and jingling on pots, pans, and\nveshels of all manner of metal, hadna jingled a' your grammar out of\nyour head, I could have touched on that matter to you at mair length.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHeriot was too plain-spoken to express much concern for the loss of his\ngrammar learning on this occasion; but after modestly hinting that he\nhad seen many men who could not fill their father's bonnet, though no\none had been suspected of wearing their father's nightcap, he inquired\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhether Lord Dalgarno had consented to do the Lady Hermione justice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTroth, man, I have small doubt that he will,\u00e2\u0080\u009d quoth the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI gave\nhim the schedule of her worldly substance, which you delivered to us in\nthe council, and we allowed him half-an-hour to chew the cud upon that.\nIt is rare reading for bringing him to reason. I left Baby Charles and\nSteenie laying his duty before him; and if he can resist doing what\n_they_ desire him--why, I wish he would teach _me_ the gate of it. O\nGeordie, Jingling Geordie, it was grand to hear Baby Charles laying down\nthe guilt of dissimulation, and Steenie lecturing on the turpitude of\nincontinence!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am afraid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George Heriot, more hastily than prudently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI might\nhave thought of the old proverb of Satan reproving sin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDeil hae our saul, neighbour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, reddening, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut ye are\nnot blate! I gie ye license to speak freely, and, by our saul, ye do not\nlet the privilege become lost _non utendo_--it will suffer no negative\nprescription in your hands. Is it fit, think ye, that Baby Charles\nshould let his thoughts be publicly seen?--No--no--princes' thoughts are\n_arcana imperii_--_Qui nescit dissimulare nescit regnare_. Every liege\nsubject is bound to speak the whole truth to the king, but there is\nnae reciprocity of obligation--and for Steenie having been whiles a\ndike-louper at a time, is it for you, who are his goldsmith, and to\nwhom, I doubt, he awes an uncomatable sum, to cast that up to him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHeriot did not feel himself called on to play the part of Zeno and\nsacrifice himself for upholding the cause of moral truth; he did not\ndesert it, however, by disavowing his words, but simply expressed\nsorrow for having offended his Majesty, with which the placable king was\nsufficiently satisfied.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now, Geordie, man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d quoth he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe will to this culprit, and hear\nwhat he has to say for himself, for I will see the job cleared this\nblessed day. Ye maun come wi' me, for your evidence may be wanted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe king led the way, accordingly, into a larger apartment, where the\nPrince, the Duke of Buckingham, and one or two privy counsellors were\nseated at a table, before which stood Lord Dalgarno, in an attitude of\nas much elegant ease and indifference as could be expressed, considering\nthe stiff dress and manners of the times.\n\nAll rose and bowed reverently, while the king, to use a north country\nword, expressive of his mode of locomotion, _toddled_ to his chair or\nthrone, making a sign to Heriot to stand behind him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe hope,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his Majesty, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat Lord Dalgarno stands prepared to do\njustice to this unfortunate lady, and to his own character and honour?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I humbly inquire the penalty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin case\nI should unhappily find compliance with your Majesty's demands\nimpossible?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBanishment frae our Court, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrae our Court and\nour countenance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnhappy exile that I may be!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno, in a tone of subdued\nirony--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will at least carry your Majesty's picture with me, for I\nshall never see such another king.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd banishment, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Prince, sternly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrom these our\ndominions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat must be by form of law, please your Royal Highness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nDalgarno, with an affectation of deep respect; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I have not heard\nthat there is a statute, compelling us, under such penalty, to marry\nevery woman we may play the fool with. Perhaps his Grace of Buckingham\ncan tell me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a villain, Dalgarno,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the haughty and vehement favourite.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFie, my lord, fie!--to a prisoner, and in presence of your royal and\npaternal gossip!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I will cut this deliberation\nshort. I have looked over this schedule of the goods and effects of\nErminia Pauletti, daughter of the late noble--yes, he is called the\nnoble, or I read wrong, Giovanni Pauletti, of the Houee of Sansovino,\nin Genoa, and of the no less noble Lady Maud Olifaunt, of the House of\nGlenvarloch--Well, I declare that I was pre-contracted in Spain to this\nnoble lady, and there has passed betwixt us some certain _proelibatio\nmatrimonii_; and now, what more does this grave assembly require of me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat you should repair the gross and infamous wrong you have done the\nlady, by marrying her within this hour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Prince.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, may it please your Royal Highness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Dalgarno, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a\ntrifling relationship with an old Earl, who calls himself my father, who\nmay claim some vote in the matter. Alas! every son is not blessed with\nan obedient parent!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He hazarded a slight glance towards the throne, to\ngive meaning to his last words.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have spoken ourselves with Lord Huntinglen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand are\nauthorised to consent in his name.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI could never have expected this intervention of a _proxaneta_, which\nthe vulgar translate blackfoot, of such eminent dignity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dalgarno,\nscarce concealing a sneer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd my father hath consented? He was wont\nto say, ere we left Scotland, that the blood of Huntinglen and of\nGlenvarloch would not mingle, were they poured into the same basin.\nPerhaps he has a mind to try the experiment?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said James, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe will not be longer trifled with--Will you\ninstantly, and _sine mora_, take this lady to your wife, in our chapel?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Statim atque instanter_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lord Dalgarno; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I perceive\nby doing so, I shall obtain power to render great services to the\ncommonwealth--I shall have acquired wealth to supply the wants of\nyour Majesty, and a fair wife to be at the command of his Grace of\nBuckingham.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Duke rose, passed to the end of the table where Lord Dalgarno was\nstanding, and whispered in his ear, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have placed a fair sister at my\ncommand ere now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis taunt cut deep through Lord Dalgarno's assumed composure. He\nstarted as if an adder had stung him, but instantly composed himself,\nand, fixing on the Duke's still smiling countenance an eye which spoke\nunutterable hatred, he pointed the forefinger of his left hand to the\nhilt of his sword, but in a manner which could scarce be observed by any\none save Buckingham. The Duke gave him another smile of bitter scorn,\nand returned to his seat, in obedience to the commands of the king, who\ncontinued calling out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSit down, Steenie, sit down, I command ye--we\nwill hae nae harnsbreaking here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Majesty needs not fear my patience,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand\nthat I may keep it the better, I will not utter another word in this\npresence, save those enjoined to me in that happy portion of the\nPrayer-Book, which begins with _Dearly Beloved_, and ends with\n_amazement_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a hardened villain, Dalgarno,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand were I the\nlass, by my father's saul, I would rather brook the stain of having been\nyour concubine, than run the risk of becoming your wife. But she shall\nbe under our special protection.--Come, my lords, we will ourselves see\nthis blithesome bridal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He gave the signal by rising, and moved towards\nthe door, followed by the train. Lord Dalgarno attended, speaking to\nnone, and spoken to by no one, yet seeming as easy and unembarrassed in\nhis gait and manner as if in reality a happy bridegroom.\n\nThey reached the Chapel by a private entrance, which communicated from\nthe royal apartment. The Bishop of Winchester, in his pontifical dress,\nstood beside the altar; on the other side, supported by Monna Paula, the\ncolourless, faded, half-lifeless form of the Lady Hermione, or Erminia\nPauletti. Lord Dalgarno bowed profoundly to her, and the Prince,\nobserving the horror with which she regarded him, walked up, and said\nto her, with much dignity,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam, ere you put yourself under the\nauthority of this man, let me inform you, he hath in the fullest degree\nvindicated your honour, so far as concerns your former intercourse. It\nis for you to consider whether you will put your fortune and happiness\ninto the hands of one, who has shown himself unworthy of all trust.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe lady, with much difficulty, found words to make reply. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI owe to\nhis Majesty's goodness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe care of providing me some\nreservation out of my own fortune, for my decent sustenance. The rest\ncannot be better disposed than in buying back the fair fame of which I\nam deprived, and the liberty of ending my life in peace and seclusion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe contract has been drawn up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, \u00e2\u0080\u009cunder our own eye,\nspecially discharging the _potestas maritalis_, and agreeing they shall\nlive separate. So buckle them, my Lord Bishop, as fast as you can, that\nthey may sunder again the sooner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Bishop accordingly opened his book and commenced the marriage\nceremony, under circumstances so novel and so inauspicious. The\nresponses of the bride were only expressed by inclinations of the\nhead and body; while those of the bridegroom were spoken boldly and\ndistinctly, with a tone resembling levity, if not scorn. When it was\nconcluded, Lord Dalgarno advanced as if to salute the bride, but seeing\nthat she drew back in fear and abhorrence, he contented himself with\nmaking her a low bow. He then drew up his form to its height, and\nstretched himself as if examining the power of his limbs, but elegantly,\nand without any forcible change of attitude. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could caper yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n he said \u00e2\u0080\u009cthough I am in fetters--but they are of gold, and lightly\nworn.--Well, I see all eyes look cold on me, and it is time I should\nwithdraw. The sun shines elsewhere than in England! But first I must ask\nhow this fair Lady Dalgarno is to be bestowed. Methinks it is but decent\nI should know. Is she to be sent to the harem of my Lord Duke? Or is\nthis worthy citizen, as before--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHold thy base ribald tongue!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his father, Lord Huntinglen, who had\nkept in the background during the ceremony, and now stepping suddenly\nforward, caught the lady by the arm, and confronted her unworthy\nhusband.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Lady Dalgarno,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshall remain as a widow in\nmy house. A widow I esteem her, as much as if the grave had closed over\nher dishonoured husband.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLord Dalgarno exhibited momentary symptoms of extreme confusion, and\nsaid, in a submissive tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you, my lord, can wish me dead, I\ncannot, though your heir, return the compliment. Few of the first-born\nof Israel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, recovering himself from the single touch of\nemotion he had displayed, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan say so much with truth. But I will\nconvince you ere I go, that I am a true descendant of a house famed for\nits memory of injuries.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI marvel your Majesty will listen to him longer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Prince Charles.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMethinks we have heard enough of his daring insolence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut James, who took the interest of a true gossip in such a scene as was\nnow passing, could not bear to cut the controversy short, but imposed\nsilence on his son, with \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhisht, Baby Charles--there is a good bairn,\nwhisht!--I want to hear what the frontless loon can say.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dalgarno, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat but for one single line in this\nschedule, all else that it contains could not have bribed me to take\nthat woman's hand into mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat line maun have been the SUMMA TOTALIS,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot so, sire,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Dalgarno. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe sum total might indeed have been\nan object for consideration even to a Scottish king, at no very distant\nperiod; but it would have had little charms for me, save that I see\nhere an entry which gives me the power of vengeance over the family of\nGlenvarloch; and learn from it that yonder pale bride, when she put the\nwedding-torch into my hand, gave me the power of burning her mother's\nhouse to ashes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow is that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is he speaking about, Jingling\nGeordie?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis friendly citizen, my liege,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno, \u00e2\u0080\u009chath expended a\nsum belonging to my lady, and now, I thank heaven, to me, in acquiring\na certain mortgage, or wanset, over the estate of Glenvarloch, which, if\nit be not redeemed before to-morrow at noon, will put me in possession\nof the fair demesnes of those who once called themselves our house's\nrivals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan this be true?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is even but too true, please your Majesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the citizen.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Lady Hermione having advanced the money for the original creditor,\nI was obliged, in honour and honesty, to take the rights to her; and\ndoubtless, they pass to her husband.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the warrant, man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king--\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe warrant on our\nExchequer--Couldna that supply the lad wi' the means of redemption?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnhappily, my liege, he has lost it, or disposed of it--It is not to be\nfound. He is the most unlucky youth!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a proper spot of work!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, beginning to amble\nabout and play with the points of his doublet and hose, in expression of\ndismay. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe cannot aid him without paying our debts twice over, and we\nhave, in the present state of our Exchequer, scarce the means of paying\nthem once.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have told me news,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I will take no\nadvantage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his father, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbe a bold villain, since thou must be one,\nand seek revenge with arms, and not with the usurer's weapons.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPardon me, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPen and ink are now my\nsurest means of vengeance; and more land is won by the lawyer with the\nram-skin, than by the Andrea Ferrara with his sheepshead handle. But,\nas I said before, I will take no advantages. I will await in town\nto-morrow, near Covent Garden; if any one will pay the redemption-money\nto my scrivener, with whom the deeds lie, the better for Lord\nGlenvarloch; if not, I will go forward on the next day, and travel with\nall dispatch to the north, to take possession.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake a father's malison with you, unhappy wretch!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord\nHuntinglen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd a king's, who is _pater patriae_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said James.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI trust to bear both lightly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno; and bowing around\nhim, he withdrew; while all present, oppressed, and, as it were,\noverawed, by his determined effrontery, found they could draw breath\nmore freely, when he at length relieved them of his society. Lord\nHuntinglen, applying himself to comfort his new daughter-in-law,\nwithdrew with her also; and the king, with his privy-council, whom he\nhad not dismissed, again returned to his council-chamber, though the\nhour was unusually late. Heriot's attendance was still commanded, but\nfor what reason was not explained to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n---I'll play the eavesdropper. _Richard III., Act V., Scene 3_.\n\nJames had no sooner resumed his seat at the council-board than he began\nto hitch in his chair, cough, use his handkerchief, and make other\nintimations that he meditated a long speech. The council composed\nthemselves to the beseeming degree of attention. Charles, as strict\nin his notions of decorum, as his father was indifferent to it, fixed\nhimself in an attitude of rigid and respectful attention, while the\nhaughty favourite, conscious of his power over both father and\nson, stretched himself more easily on his seat, and, in assuming an\nappearance of listening, seemed to pay a debt to ceremonial rather than\nto duty.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI doubt not, my lords,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Monarch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat some of you may be\nthinking the hour of refection is past, and that it is time to ask with\nthe slave in the comedy--_Quid de symbolo?_--Nevertheless, to do justice\nand exercise judgment is our meat and drink; and now we are to pray your\nwisdom to consider the case of this unhappy youth, Lord Glenvarloch, and\nsee whether, consistently with our honour, any thing can be done in his\nfavour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am surprised at your Majesty's wisdom making the inquiry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nDuke; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is plain this Dalgarno hath proved one of the most insolent\nvillains on earth, and it must therefore be clear, that if Lord\nGlenvarloch had run him through the body, there would but have been\nout of the world a knave who had lived in it too long. I think Lord\nGlenvarloch hath had much wrong; and I regret that, by the persuasions\nof this false fellow, I have myself had some hand in it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe speak like a child, Steenie--I mean my Lord of Buckingham,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered\nthe king, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand as one that does not understand the logic of the schools;\nfor an action may be inconsequential or even meritorious, _quoad\nhominem_, that is, as touching him upon _whom_ it is acted; and yet most\ncriminal, _quoad locum_, or considering the place _wherein_ it is done;\nas a man may lawfully dance Chrighty Beardie or any other dance in a\ntavern, but not _inter parietes ecclesiae_. So that, though it may have\nbeen a good deed to have sticked Lord Dalgarno, being such as he has\nshown himself, anywhere else, yet it fell under the plain statute, when\nviolence was offered within the verge of the Court. For, let me tell\nyou, my lords, the statute against striking would be of no small use in\nour Court, if it could be eluded by justifying the person stricken to be\na knave. It is much to be lamented that I ken nae Court in Christendom\nwhere knaves are not to be found; and if men are to break the peace\nunder pretence of beating them, why, it will rain Jeddart staves\n[Footnote: The old-fashioned weapon called the Jeddart staff was a\nspecies of battle-axe. Of a very great tempest, it is said, in the south\nof Scotland, that it rains Jeddart staffs, as in England the common\npeople talk of its raining cats and dogs.] in our very ante-chamber.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat your Majesty says,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Prince Charles, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis marked with your\nusual wisdom--the precincts of palaces must be sacred as well as\nthe persons of kings, which are respected even in the most barbarous\nnations, as being one step only beneath their divinities. But your\nMajesty's will can control the severity of this and every other law,\nand it is in your power, on consideration of his case, to grant the rash\nyoung man a free pardon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Rem acu tetigisti, Carole, mi puerule,_\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand know,\nmy lords, that we have, by a shrewd device and gift of our own, already\nsounded the very depth of this Lord Glenvarloch's disposition. I trow\nthere be among you some that remember my handling in the curious case\nof my Lady Lake, and how I trimmed them about the story of hearkening\nbehind the arras. Now this put me to cogitation, and I remembered me\nof having read that Dionysius, King of Syracuse, whom historians call\nTyrannos, which signifieth not in the Greek tongue, as in ours, a\ntruculent usurper, but a royal king who governs, it may be, something\nmore strictly than we and other lawful monarchs, whom the ancients\ntermed Basileis--Now this Dionysius of Syracuse caused cunning workmen\nto build for himself a _lugg_--D'ye ken what that is, my Lord Bishop?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA cathedral, I presume to guess,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Bishop.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat the deil, man--I crave your lordship's pardon for swearing--but\nit was no cathedral--only a lurking-place called the king's _lugg_,\nor _ear_, where he could sit undescried, and hear the converse of his\nprisoners. Now, sirs, in imitation of this Dionysius, whom I took for\nmy pattern, the rather that he was a great linguist and grammarian, and\ntaught a school with good applause after his abdication, (either he or\nhis successor of the same name, it matters not whilk)--I have caused\nthem to make a _lugg_ up at the state-prison of the Tower yonder, more\nlike a pulpit than a cathedral, my Lord Bishop--and communicating with\nthe arras behind the Lieutenant's chamber, where we may sit and\nprivily hear the discourse of such prisoners as are pent up there for\nstate-offences, and so creep into the very secrets of our enemies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Prince cast a glance towards the Duke, expressive of great vexation\nand disgust. Buckingham shrugged his shoulders, but the motion was so\nslight as to be almost imperceptible.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWeel, my lords, ye ken the fray at the hunting this morning--I\nshall not get out of the trembling exies until I have a sound night's\nsleep--just after that, they bring ye in a pretty page that had been\nfound in the Park. We were warned against examining him ourselves by the\nanxious care of those around us; nevertheless, holding our life ever at\nthe service of these kingdoms, we commanded all to avoid the room,\nthe rather that we suspected this boy to be a girl. What think ye, my\nlords?--few of you would have thought I had a hawk's eye for sic gear;\nbut we thank God, that though we are old, we know so much of such toys\nas may beseem a man of decent gravity. Weel, my lords, we questioned\nthis maiden in male attire ourselves, and I profess it was a very pretty\ninterrogatory, and well followed. For, though she at first professed\nthat she assumed this disguise in order to countenance the woman who\nshould present us with the Lady Hermione's petition, for whom she\nprofessed entire affection; yet when we, suspecting _anguis in herba_,\ndid put her to the very question, she was compelled to own a virtuous\nattachment for Glenvarlochides, in such a pretty passion of shame and\nfear, that we had much ado to keep our own eyes from keeping company\nwith hers in weeping. Also, she laid before us the false practices of\nthis Dalgarno towards Glenvarlochides, inveigling him into houses of ill\nresort, and giving him evil counsel under pretext of sincere friendship,\nwhereby the inexperienced lad was led to do what was prejudicial to\nhimself, and offensive to us. But, however prettily she told her tale,\nwe determined not altogether to trust to her narration, but rather to\ntry the experiment whilk we had devised for such occasions. And having\nourselves speedily passed from Greenwich to the Tower, we constituted\nourselves eavesdropper, as it is called, to observe what should pass\nbetween Glenvarlochides and his page, whom we caused to be admitted to\nhis apartment, well judging that if they were of counsel together to\ndeceive us, it could not be but something of it would spunk out--And\nwhat think ye we saw, my lords?--Naething for you to sniggle and laugh\nat, Steenie--for I question if you could have played the temperate and\nChristian-like part of this poor lad Glenvarloch. He might be a Father\nof the Church in comparison of you, man.--And then, to try his patience\nyet farther, we loosed on him a courtier and a citizen, that is Sir\nMungo Malagrowther and our servant George Heriot here, wha dang the poor\nlad about, and didna greatly spare our royal selves.--You mind, Geordie,\nwhat you said about the wives and concubines? but I forgie ye, man--nae\nneed of kneeling, I forgie ye--the readier, that it regards a certain\nparticular, whilk, as it added not much to Solomon's credit, the lack\nof it cannot be said to impinge on ours. Aweel, my lords, for all\ntemptation of sore distress and evil ensample, this poor lad never\nloosed his tongue on us to say one unbecoming word--which inclines us\nthe rather, acting always by your wise advice, to treat this affair\nof the Park as a thing done in the heat of blood, and under strong\nprovocation, and therefore to confer our free pardon on Lord\nGlenvarloch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am happy your gracious Majesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Duke of Buckingham, \u00e2\u0080\u009chas\narrived at that conclusion, though I could never have guessed at the\nroad by which you attained it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI trust,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Prince Charles, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat it is not a path which your\nMajesty will think it consistent with your high dignity to tread\nfrequently.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever while I live again, Baby Charles, that I give you my royal word\non. They say that hearkeners hear ill tales of themselves--by my saul,\nmy very ears are tingling wi' that auld sorrow Sir Mungo's sarcasms. He\ncalled us close-fisted, Steenie--I am sure you can contradict that. But\nit is mere envy in the auld mutilated sinner, because he himself has\nneither a noble to hold in his loof, nor fingers to close on it if he\nhad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here the king lost recollection of Sir Mungo's irreverence\nin chuckling over his own wit, and only farther alluded to it by\nsaying--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must give the old maunderer _bos in linguam_--something to\nstop his mouth, or he will rail at us from Dan to Beersheba.--And now,\nmy lords, let our warrant of mercy to Lord Glenvarloch be presently\nexpedited, and he put to his freedom; and as his estate is likely to go\nso sleaveless a gate, we will consider what means of favour we can\nshow him.--My lords, I wish you an appetite to an early supper--for our\nlabours have approached that term.--Baby Charles and Steenie, you will\nremain till our couchee.--My Lord Bishop, you will be pleased to stay to\nbless our meat.--Geordie Heriot, a word with you apart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis Majesty then drew the citizen into a corner, while the counsellors,\nthose excepted who had been commanded to remain, made their\nobeisance, and withdrew. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGeordie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy good and trusty\nservant\u00e2\u0080\u009d--Here he busied his fingers much with the points and ribbons of\nhis dress,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe see that we have granted, from our own natural sense of\nright and justice, that which yon long-backed fallow, Moniplies I think\nthey ca' him, proffered to purchase from us with a mighty bribe; whilk\nwe refused, as being a crowned king, who wad neither sell our justice\nnor our mercy for pecuniar consideration. Now, what think ye should be\nthe upshot of this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy Lord Glenvarloch's freedom, and his restoration to your Majesty's\nfavour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heriot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI ken that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, peevishly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYe are very dull to-day. I\nmean, what do you think this fallow Moniplies should think about the\nmatter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSurely that your Majesty is a most good and gracious sovereign,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered Heriot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe had need to be gude and gracious baith,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, still more\npettishly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat have idiots about us that cannot understand what we\nmint at, unless we speak it out in braid Lowlands. See this chield\nMoniplies, sir, and tell him what we have done for Lord Glenvarloch,\nin whom he takes such part, out of our own gracious motion, though we\nrefused to do it on ony proffer of private advantage. Now, you may put\nit till him, as if of your own mind, whether it will be a gracious or a\ndutiful part in him, to press us for present payment of the two or three\nhundred miserable pounds for whilk we were obliged to opignorate our\njewels? Indeed, mony men may think ye wad do the part of a good citizen,\nif you took it on yourself to refuse him payment, seeing he hath\nhad what he professed to esteem full satisfaction, and considering,\nmoreover, that it is evident he hath no pressing need of the money,\nwhereof we have much necessity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGeorge Heriot sighed internally. \u00e2\u0080\u009cO my Master,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought he--\u00e2\u0080\u009cmy dear\nMaster, is it then fated you are never to indulge any kingly or noble\nsentiment, without its being sullied by some afterthought of interested\nselfishness!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe king troubled himself not about what he thought, but taking him by\nthe collar, said,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe ken my meaning now, Jingler--awa wi' ye. You\nare a wise man--manage it your ain gate--but forget not our present\nstraits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The citizen made his obeisance, and withdrew.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now, bairns,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat do you look upon each other\nfor--and what have you got to ask of your dear dad and gossip?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Prince, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat it would please your Majesty to command\nthe lurking-place at the prison to be presently built up--the groans of\na captive should not be brought in evidence against him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! build up my lugg, Baby Charles? And yet, better deaf than hear\nill tales of oneself. So let them build it up, hard and fast, without\ndelay, the rather that my back is sair with sitting in it for a whole\nhour.--And now let us see what the cooks have been doing for us, bonny\nbairns.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\n  To this brave man the knight repairs\n  For counsel in his law affairs;\n  And found him mounted in his pew.\n  With books and money placed for show,\n  Like nest-eggs to make clients lay,\n  And for his false opinion pay.\n                        _Hudibras._\n\nOur readers may recollect a certain smooth-tongued, lank-haired,\nbuckram-suited, Scottish scrivener, who, in the earlier part of this\nhistory, appeared in the character of a protege of George Heriot. It is\nto his house we are about to remove, but times have changed with him.\nThe petty booth hath become a chamber of importance--the buckram suit\nis changed into black velvet; and although the wearer retains his\npuritanical humility and politeness to clients of consequence, he can\nnow look others broad in the face, and treat them with a full allowance\nof superior opulence, and the insolence arising from it. It was but\na short period that had achieved these alterations, nor was the party\nhimself as yet entirely accustomed to them, but the change was becoming\nless embarrassing to him with every day's practice. Among other\nacquisitions of wealth, you may see one of Davy Ramsay's best timepieces\non the table, and his eye is frequently observing its revolutions, while\na boy, whom he employs as a scribe, is occasionally sent out to compare\nits progress with the clock of Saint Dunstan.\n\nThe scrivener himself seemed considerably agitated. He took from a\nstrong-box a bundle of parchments, and read passages of them with great\nattention; then began to soliloquize--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no outlet which law can\nsuggest--no back-door of evasion--none--if the lands of Glenvarloch\nare not redeemed before it rings noon, Lord Dalgarno has them a cheap\npennyworth. Strange, that he should have been at last able to set his\npatron at defiance, and achieve for himself the fair estate, with the\nprospect of which he so long flattered the powerful Buckingham.--Might\nnot Andrew Skurliewhitter nick him as neatly? He hath been my\npatron--true--not more than Buckingham was his; and he can be so no\nmore, for he departs presently for Scotland. I am glad of it--I hate\nhim, and I fear him. He knows too many of my secrets--I know too many\nof his. But, no--no--no--I need never attempt it, there are no means of\nover-reaching him.--Well, Willie, what o'clock?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEle'en hours just chappit, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo to your desk without, child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the scrivener. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat to do\nnext--I shall lose the old Earl's fair business, and, what is worse, his\nson's foul practice. Old Heriot looks too close into business to permit\nme more than the paltry and ordinary dues. The Whitefriars business was\nprofitable, but it has become unsafe ever since--pah!--what brought that\nin my head just now? I can hardly hold my pen--if men should see me\nin this way!--Willie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d (calling aloud to the boy,) \u00e2\u0080\u009ca cup of distilled\nwaters--Soh!--now I could face the devil.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe spoke the last words aloud, and close by the door of the apartment,\nwhich was suddenly opened by Richie Moniplies, followed by two\ngentlemen, and attended by two porters bearing money-bags. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf ye can\nface the devil, Maister Skurliewhitter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cye will be the\nless likely to turn your back on a sack or twa o' siller, which I have\nta'en the freedom to bring you. Sathanas and Mammon are near akin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The\nporters, at the same time, ranged their load on the floor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI--I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--stammered the surprised scrivener--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot guess what you\nmean, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly that I have brought you the redemption-money on the part of\nLord Glenvarloch, in discharge of a certain mortgage over his family\ninheritance. And here, in good time, comes Master Reginald Lowestoffe,\nand another honourable gentleman of the Temple, to be witnesses to the\ntransaction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI--I incline to think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the scrivener, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the term is expired.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will pardon us, Master Scrivener,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lowestoffe. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will not\nbaffle us--it wants three-quarters of noon by every clock in the city.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must have time, gentlemen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Andrew, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto examine the gold by tale\nand weight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo so at your leisure, Master Scrivener,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Lowestoffe again.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have already seen the contents of each sack told and weighed, and we\nhave put our seals on them. There they stand in a row, twenty in number,\neach containing three hundred yellow-hammers--we are witnesses to the\nlawful tender.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGentlemen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the scrivener, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis security now belongs to a\nmighty lord. I pray you, abate your haste, and let me send for Lord\nDalgarno,--or rather I will run for him myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he took up his hat; but Lowestoffe called out,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cFriend\nMoniplies, keep the door fast, an thou be'st a man! he seeks but to put\noff the time.--In plain terms, Andrew, you may send for the devil, if\nyou will, who is the mightiest lord of my acquaintance, but from hence\nyou stir not till you have answered our proposition, by rejecting or\naccepting the redemption-money fairly tendered--there it lies--take it,\nor leave it, as you will. I have skill enough to know that the law is\nmightier than any lord in Britain--I have learned so much at the Temple,\nif I have learned nothing else. And see that you trifle not with it,\nlest it make your long ears an inch shorter, Master Skurliewhitter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, gentlemen, if you threaten me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the scrivener, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot\nresist compulsion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo threats--no threats at all, my little Andrew,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lowestoffe; \u00e2\u0080\u009ca\nlittle friendly advice only--forget not, honest Andrew, I have seen you\nin Alsatia.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWithout answering a single word, the scrivener sat down, and drew in\nproper form a full receipt for the money proffered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI take it on your report, Master Lowestoffe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope you\nwill remember I have insisted neither upon weight nor tale--I have been\ncivil--if there is deficiency I shall come to loss.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFillip his nose with a gold-piece, Richie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d quoth the Templar. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTake up\nthe papers, and now wend we merrily to dine thou wot'st where.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I might choose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit should not be at yonder roguish\nordinary; but as it is your pleasure, gentlemen, the treat shall be\ngiven wheresoever you will have it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt the ordinary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the one Templar.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt Beaujeu's,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the other; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is the only house in London for neat\nwines, nimble drawers, choice dishes, and--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd high charges,\u00e2\u0080\u009d quoth Richie Moniplies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, as I said before,\ngentlemen, ye have a right to command me in this thing, having so\nfrankly rendered me your service in this small matter of business,\nwithout other stipulation than that of a slight banquet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe latter part of this discourse passed in the street, where,\nimmediately afterwards, they met Lord Dalgarno. He appeared in haste,\ntouched his hat slightly to Master Lowestoffe, who returned his\nreverence with the same negligence, and walked slowly on with his\ncompanion, while Lord Dalgarno stopped Richie Moniplies with a\ncommanding sign, which the instinct of education compelled Moniplies,\nthough indignant, to obey.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhom do you now follow, sirrah?\u00e2\u0080\u009d demanded the noble.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhomsoever goeth before me, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Moniplies.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo sauciness, you knave--I desire to know if you still serve Nigel\nOlifaunt?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dalgarno.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am friend to the noble Lord Glenvarloch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Moniplies, with\ndignity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Lord Dalgarno, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat noble lord has sunk to seek friends\namong lackeys--Nevertheless,--hark thee hither,--nevertheless, if he\nbe of the same mind as when we last met, thou mayst show him, that, on\nto-morrow, at four afternoon, I shall pass northward by Enfield Chase--I\nwill be slenderly attended, as I design to send my train through Barnet.\nIt is my purpose to ride an easy pace through the forest, and to linger\na while by Camlet Moat--he knows the place; and, if he be aught but an\nAlsatian bully, will think it fitter for some purposes than the Park. He\nis, I understand, at liberty, or shortly to be so. If he fail me at\nthe place nominated, he must seek me in Scotland, where he will find me\npossessed of his father's estate and lands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHumph!\u00e2\u0080\u009d muttered Richie; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere go twa words to that bargain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe even meditated a joke on the means which he was conscious he\npossessed of baffling Lord Dalgarno's expectations; but there was\nsomething of keen and dangerous excitement in the eyes of the young\nnobleman, which prompted his discretion for once to rule his vit, and he\nonly answered--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod grant your lordship may well brook your new conquest--when you\nget it. I shall do your errand to my lord--whilk is to say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added\ninternally, \u00e2\u0080\u009che shall never hear a word of it from Richie. I am not the\nlad to put him in such hazard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLord Dalgarno looked at him sharply for a moment, as if to penetrate\nthe meaning of the dry ironical tone, which, in spite of Richie's awe,\nmingled with his answer, and then waved his hand, in signal he should\npass on. He himself walked slowly till the trio were out of sight, then\nturned back with hasty steps to the door of the scrivener, which he had\npassed in his progress, knocked, and was admitted.\n\nLord Dalgarno found the man of law with the money-bags still\nstanding before him; and it escaped not his penetrating glance, that\nSkurliewhitter was disconcerted and alarmed at his approach.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow now, man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat! hast thou not a word of oily compliment\nto me on my happy marriage?--not a word of most philosophical\nconsolation on my disgrace at Court?--Or has my mien, as a wittol and\ndiscarded favourite, the properties of the Gorgon's head, the _turbatae\nPalladis arma_, as Majesty might say?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord, I am glad--my lord, I am sorry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--answered the trembling\nscrivener, who, aware of the vivacity of Lord Dalgarno's temper, dreaded\nthe consequence of the communication he had to make to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGlad and sorry!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lord Dalgarno. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is blowing hot and cold,\nwith a witness. Hark ye, you picture of petty-larceny personified--if\nyou are sorry I am a cuckold, remember I am only mine own, you\nknave--there is too little blood in her cheeks to have sent her astray\nelsewhere. Well, I will bear mine antler'd honours as I may--gold\nshall gild them; and for my disgrace, revenge shall sweeten it. Ay,\nrevenge--and there strikes the happy hour!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe hour of noon was accordingly heard to peal from Saint Dunstan's.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell banged, brave hammers!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno, in triumph.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\nestate and lands of Glenvarloch are crushed beneath these clanging\nblows. If my steel to-morrow prove but as true as your iron maces\nto-day, the poor landless lord will little miss what your peal hath\ncut him out from.--The papers--the papers, thou varlet! I am to-morrow\nNorthward, ho! At four, afternoon, I am bound to be at Camlet Moat,\nin the Enfield Chase. To-night most of my retinue set forward. The\npapers!--Come, dispatch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord, the--the papers of the Glenvarloch mortgage--I--I have them\nnot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave them not!\u00e2\u0080\u009d echoed Lord Dalgarno,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cHast thou sent them to my\nlodgings, thou varlet? Did I not say I was coming hither?--What mean you\nby pointing to that money? What villainy have you done for it? It is too\nlarge to be come honestly by.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour lordship knows best,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the scrivener, in great\nperturbation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe gold is your own. It is--it is--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot the redemption-money of the Glenvarloch estate!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dalgarno.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDare not say it is, or I will, upon the spot, divorce your pettifogging\nsoul from your carrion carcass!\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he seized the scrivener\nby the collar, and shook him so vehemently, that he tore it from the\ncassock.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord, I must call for help,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the trembling caitiff, who felt\nat that moment all the bitterness of the mortal agony--\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was the law's\nact, not mine. What could I do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDost ask?--why, thou snivelling dribblet of damnation, were all thy\noaths, tricks, and lies spent? or do you hold yourself too good to utter\nthem in my service? Thou shouldst have lied, cozened, out-sworn truth\nitself, rather than stood betwixt me and my revenge! But mark me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\ncontinued; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know more of your pranks than would hang thee. A line from\nme to the Attorney-General, and thou art sped.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat would you have me to do, my lord?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the scrivener. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll that\nart and law can accomplish, I will try.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, are you converted? do so, or pity of your life!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lord;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand remember I never fail my word.--Then keep that accursed gold,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n he continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOr, stay, I will not trust you--send me this gold home\npresently to my lodging. I will still forward to Scotland, and it shall\ngo hard but that I hold out Glenvarloch Castle against the owner, by\nmeans of the ammunition he has himself furnished. Thou art ready to\nserve me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The scrivener professed the most implicit obedience.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen remember, the hour was past ere payment was tendered--and see thou\nhast witnesses of trusty memory to prove that point.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTush, my lord, I will do more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Andrew, reviving--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will prove\nthat Lord Glenvarloch's friends threatened, swaggered, and drew swords\non me.--Did your lordship think I was ungrateful enough to have suffered\nthem to prejudice your lordship, save that they had bare swords at my\nthroat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEnough said,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Dalgarno; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are perfect--mind that you\ncontinue so, as you would avoid my fury. I leave my page below--get\nporters, and let them follow me instantly with the gold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, Lord Dalgarno left the scrivener's habitation.\n\nSkurliewhitter, having dispatched his boy to get porters of trust for\ntransporting the money, remained alone and in dismay, meditating by\nwhat means he could shake himself free of the vindictive and ferocious\nnobleman, who possessed at once a dangerous knowledge of his character,\nand the power of exposing him, where exposure would be ruin. He\nhad indeed acquiesced in the plan, rapidly sketched, for obtaining\npossession of the ransomed estate, but his experience foresaw that this\nwould be impossible; while, on the other hand, he could not anticipate\nthe various consequences of Lord Dalgarno's resentment, without fears,\nfrom which his sordid soul recoiled. To be in the power, and subject\nboth to the humours and the extortions of a spendthrift young lord, just\nwhen his industry had shaped out the means of fortune,--it was the most\ncruel trick which fate could have played the incipient usurer.\n\nWhile the scrivener was in this fit of anxious anticipation, one knocked\nat the door of the apartment; and, being desired to enter, appeared in\nthe coarse riding-cloak of uncut Wiltshire cloth, fastened by a broad\nleather belt and brass buckle, which was then generally worn by graziers\nand countrymen. Skurliewhitter, believing he saw in his visitor a\ncountry client who might prove profitable, had opened his mouth to\nrequest him to be seated, when the stranger, throwing back his frieze\nhood which he had drawn over his face, showed the scrivener features\nwell imprinted in his recollection, but which he never saw without a\ndisposition to swoon.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, faintly, as the stranger replaced the hood which\nconcealed his features.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho else should it be?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his visitor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou son of parchment, got betwixt the inkhorn And the stuff'd\nprocess-bag--that mayest call The pen thy father, and the ink thy mother,\n\n The wax thy brother, and the sand thy sister\n And the good pillory thy cousin allied--\n Rise, and do reverence unto me, thy better!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot yet down to the country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the scrivener, \u00e2\u0080\u009cafter every warning?\nDo not think your grazier's cloak will bear you out, captain--no, nor\nyour scraps of stage-plays.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, what would you have me to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the captain--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWould you have\nme starve? If I am to fly, you must eke my wings with a few feathers.\nYou can spare them, I think.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou had means already--you have had ten pieces--What is become of\nthem?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Captain Colepepper--\u00e2\u0080\u009cGone, no matter where--I had a\nmind to bite, and I was bitten, that's all--I think my hand shook at the\nthought of t'other night's work, for I trowled the doctors like a very\nbaby.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you have lost all, then?--Well, take this and be gone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nscrivener.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat, two poor smelts! Marry, plague of your bounty!--But remember, you\nare as deep in as I.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot so, by Heaven!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the scrivener; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI only thought of easing\nthe old man of some papers and a trifle of his gold, and you took his\nlife.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWere he living,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Colepepper, \u00e2\u0080\u009che would rather have lost\nit than his money.--But that is not the question, Master\nSkurliewhitter--you undid the private bolts of the window when you\nvisited him about some affairs on the day ere he died--so satisfy\nyourself, that, if I am taken, I will not swing alone. Pity Jack\nHempsfield is dead, it spoils the old catch,\n\n     'And three merry men, and three merry men,\n      And three merry men are we,\n      As ever did sing three parts in a string,\n      All under the triple tree.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor God's sake, speak lower,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the scrivener; \u00e2\u0080\u009cis this a place or\ntime to make your midnight catches heard?--But how much will serve your\nturn? I tell you I am but ill provided.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou tell me a lie, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the bully--\u00e2\u0080\u009ca most palpable and gross\nlie.--How much, d'ye say, will serve my turn? Why, one of these bags\nwill do for the present.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI swear to you that these bags of money are not at my disposal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot honestly, perhaps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the captain, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut that makes little\ndifference betwixt us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI swear to you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the scrivener \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey are in no way at my\ndisposal--they have been delivered to me by tale--I am to pay them over\nto Lord Dalgarno, whose boy waits for them, and I could not skelder one\npiece out of them, without risk of hue and cry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan you not put off the delivery?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the bravo, his huge hand still\nfumbling with one of the bags, as if his fingers longed to close on it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cImpossible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the scrivener, \u00e2\u0080\u009che sets forward to Scotland\nto-morrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the bully, after a moment's thought--\u00e2\u0080\u009cTravels he the north\nroad with such a charge?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is well accompanied,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added the scrivener; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut yet--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut yet--but what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the bravo.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, I meant nothing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the scrivener.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou didst--thou hadst the wind of some good thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied\nColepepper; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw thee pause like a setting dog. Thou wilt say as\nlittle, and make as sure a sign, as a well-bred spaniel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll I meant to say, captain, was, that his servants go by Barnet, and\nhe himself, with his page, pass through Enfield Chase; and he spoke to\nme yesterday of riding a soft pace.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAha!--Comest thou to me there, my boy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd of resting\u00e2\u0080\u009d--continued the scrivener,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cresting a space at Camlet\nMoat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, this is better than cock-fighting!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the captain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see not how it can advantage you, captain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the scrivener. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut,\nhowever, they cannot ride fast, for his page rides the sumpter-horse,\nwhich carries all that weight,\u00e2\u0080\u009d pointing to the money on the table.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLord Dalgarno looks sharp to the world's gear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat horse will be obliged to those who may ease him of his burden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said the bravo; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand egad, he may be met with.--He hath still that\npage--that same Lutin--that goblin? Well, the boy hath set game for\nme ere now. I will be revenged, too, for I owe him a grudge for an old\nscore at the ordinary. Let me see--Black Feltham, and Dick Shakebag--we\nshall want a fourth--I love to make sure, and the booty will stand\nparting, besides what I can bucket them out of. Well, scrivener, lend\nme two pieces.--Bravely done--nobly imparted! Give ye good-den.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And\nwrapping his disguise closer around him, away he went.\n\nWhen he had left the room, the scrivener wrung his hands, and exclaimed,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMore blood--more blood! I thought to have had done with it, but this\ntime there was no fault with me--none--and then I shall have all the\nadvantage. If this ruffian falls, there is truce with his tugs at my\npurse-strings; and if Lord Dalgarno dies--as is most likely, for though\nas much afraid of cold steel as a debtor of a dun, this fellow is\na deadly shot from behind a bush,--then am I in a thousand ways\nsafe--safe--safe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe willingly drop the curtain over him and his reflections.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\n\n  We are not worst at once--the course of evil\n  Begins so slowly, and from such slight source,\n  An infant's hand might stem its breach with clay;\n  But let the stream get deeper, and philosophy--\n  Ay, and religion too--shall strive in vain\n  To turn the headlong torrent.\n                            _Old Play._\n\nThe Templars had been regaled by our friend Richie Moniplies in a\nprivate chamber at Beaujeu's, where he might be considered as good\ncompany; for he had exchanged his serving-man's cloak and jerkin for\na grave yet handsome suit of clothes, in the fashion of the times, but\nsuch as might have befitted an older man than himself. He had positively\ndeclined presenting himself at the ordinary, a point to which his\ncompanions were very desirous to have brought him, for it will be\neasily believed that such wags as Lowestoffe and his companion were not\nindisposed to a little merriment at the expense of the raw and pedantic\nScotsman; besides the chance of easing him of a few pieces, of which\nhe appeared to have acquired considerable command. But not even a\nsuccession of measures of sparkling sack, in which the little brilliant\natoms circulated like motes in the sun's rays, had the least effect\non Richie's sense of decorum. He retained the gravity of a judge, even\nwhile he drank like a fish, partly from his own natural inclination to\ngood liquor, partly in the way of good fellowship towards his guests.\nWhen the wine began to make some innovation on their heads, Master\nLowestoffe, tired, perhaps, of the humours of Richie, who began to\nbecome yet more stoically contradictory and dogmatical than even in the\nearlier part of the entertainment, proposed to his friend to break up\ntheir debauch and join the gamesters.\n\nThe drawer was called accordingly, and Richie discharged the reckoning\nof the party, with a generous remuneration to the attendants, which was\nreceived with cap and knee, and many assurances of--\u00e2\u0080\u009cKindly welcome,\ngentlemen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI grieve we should part so soon, gentlemen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie to his\ncompanions,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cand I would you had cracked another quart ere you went, or\nstayed to take some slight matter of supper, and a glass of Rhenish. I\nthank you, however, for having graced my poor collation thus far; and\nI commend you to fortune, in your own courses, for the ordinary neither\nwas, is, nor shall be, an element of mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFare thee well, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lowestoffe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmost sapient and sententious\nMaster Moniplies. May you soon have another mortgage to redeem, and may\nI be there to witness it; and may you play the good fellow, as heartily\nas you have done this day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, gentlemen, it is merely of your grace to say so--but, if you\nwould but hear me speak a few words of admonition respecting this wicked\nordinary--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReserve the lesson, most honourable Richie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lowestoffe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cuntil\nI have lost all my money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d showing, at the same time, a purse\nindifferently well provided, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand then the lecture is likely to have\nsome weight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd keep my share of it, Richie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the other Templar, showing an\nalmost empty purse, in his turn, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctill this be full again, and then I\nwill promise to hear you with some patience.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, gallants,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe full and the empty gang a' ae\ngate, and that is a grey one--but the time will come.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, it is come already,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lowestoffe; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey have set out the\nhazard table. Since you will peremptorily not go with us, why, farewell,\nRichie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd farewell, gentlemen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, and left the house, into which\nthey had returned.\n\nMoniplies was not many steps from the door, when a person, whom, lost\nin his reflections on gaming, ordinaries, and the manners of the age,\nhe had not observed, and who had been as negligent on his part, ran\nfull against him; and, when Richie desired to know whether he meant \u00e2\u0080\u009cony\nincivility,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied by a curse on Scotland, and all that belonged to\nit. A less round reflection on his country would, at any time, have\nprovoked Richie, but more especially when he had a double quart of\nCanary and better in his pate. He was about to give a very rough answer,\nand to second his word by action, when a closer view of his antagonist\nchanged his purpose.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are the vera lad in the warld,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhom I most wished to\nmeet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the stranger, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor any of your beggarly countrymen,\nare the last sight I should ever wish to see. You Scots are ever fair\nand false, and an honest man cannot thrive within eyeshot of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs to our poverty, friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is as Heaven pleases;\nbut touching our falset, I'll prove to you that a Scotsman bears as leal\nand true a heart to his friend as ever beat in English doublet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI care not whether he does or not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the gallant. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me go--why\nkeep you hold of my cloak? Let me go, or I will thrust you into the\nkennel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe I could forgie ye, for you did me a good turn once, in\nplucking me out of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Scot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBeshrew my fingers, then, if they did so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the stranger. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nwould your whole country lay there, along with you; and Heaven's curse\nblight the hand that helped to raise them!--Why do you stop my way?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nadded, fiercely.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause it is a bad one, Master Jenkin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, never start\nabout it, man--you see you are known. Alack-a-day! that an honest man's\nson should live to start at hearing himself called by his own name!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Jenkin struck his brow violently with his clenched fist.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, come,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis passion availeth nothing. Tell me what\ngate go you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo the devil!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Jin Vin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is a black gate, if you speak according to the letter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered\nRichie; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut if metaphorically, there are worse places in this great\ncity than the Devil Tavern; and I care not if I go thither with you, and\nbestow a pottle of burnt sack on you--it will correct the crudities of\nmy stomach, and form a gentle preparative for the leg of a cold pullet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI pray you, in good fashion, to let me go,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may mean\nme kindly, and I wish you to have no wrong at my hand; but I am in the\nhumour to be dangerous to myself, or any one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will abide the risk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Scot, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you will but come with me;\nand here is a place convenient, a howff nearer than the Devil, whilk\nis but an ill-omened drouthy name for a tavern. This other of the Saint\nAndrew is a quiet place, where I have ta'en my whetter now and\nthen, when I lodged in the neighbourhood of the Temple with Lord\nGlenvarloch.--What the deil's the matter wi' the man, garr'd him gie sic\na spang as that, and almaist brought himself and me on the causeway?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not name that false Scot's name to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jin Vin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you would\nnot have me go mad!--I was happy before I saw him--he has been the cause\nof all the ill that has befallen me--he has made a knave and a madman of\nme!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you are a knave,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have met an officer--if you are\ndaft, you have met a keeper; but a gentle officer and a kind keeper.\nLook you, my gude friend, there has been twenty things said about this\nsame lord, in which there is no more truth than in the leasings of\nMahound. The warst they can say of him is, that he is not always so\namenable to good advice as I would pray him, you, and every young man to\nbe. Come wi' me--just come ye wi' me; and, if a little spell of siller\nand a great deal of excellent counsel can relieve your occasions, all\nI can say is, you have had the luck to meet one capable of giving you\nboth, and maist willing to bestow them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe pertinacity of the Scot prevailed over the sullenness of Vincent,\nwho was indeed in a state of agitation and incapacity to think for\nhimself, which led him to yield the more readily to the suggestions of\nanother. He suffered himself to be dragged into the small tavern which\nRichie recommended, and where they soon found themselves seated in a\nsnug niche, with a reeking pottle of burnt sack, and a paper of sugar\nbetwixt them. Pipes and tobacco were also provided, but were only used\nby Richie, who had adopted the custom of late, as adding considerably to\nthe gravity and importance of his manner, and affording, as it were,\na bland and pleasant accompaniment to the words of wisdom which flowed\nfrom his tongue. After they had filled their glasses and drank them in\nsilence, Richie repeated the question, whither his guest was going when\nthey met so fortunately.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI told you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was going to destruction--I mean to the\ngaming-house. I am resolved to hazard these two or three pieces, to get\nas much as will pay for a passage with Captain Sharker, whose ship lies\nat Gravesend, bound for America--and so Eastward, ho!--I met one devil\nin the way already, who would have tempted me from my purpose, but I\nspurned him from me--you may be another for what I know.--What degree\nof damnation do you propose for me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added wildly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand what is the\nprice of it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would have you to know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I deal in no such\ncommodities, whether as buyer or seller. But if you will tell me\nhonestly the cause of your distress, I will do what is in my power to\nhelp you out of it,--not being, however, prodigal of promises, until\nI know the case; as a learned physician only gives advice when he has\nobserved the diagnostics.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo one has any thing to do with my affairs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the poor lad; and\nfolding his arms on the table, he laid his head upon them, with the\nsullen dejection of the overburdened lama, when it throws itself down to\ndie in desperation.\n\nRichard Moniplies, like most folk who have a good opinion of themselves,\nwas fond of the task of consolation, which at once displayed his\nsuperiority, (for the consoler is necessarily, for the time at least,\nsuperior to the afflicted person,) and indulged his love of talking.\nHe inflicted on the poor penitenta harangue of pitiless length, stuffed\nfull of the usual topics of the mutability of human affairs--the eminent\nadvantages of patience under affliction--the folly of grieving for what\nhath no remedy--the necessity of taking more care for the future, and\nsome gentle rebukes on account of the past, which acid he threw in to\nassist in subduing the patient's obstinacy, as Hannibal used vinegar in\ncutting his way through rocks. It was not in human nature to endure this\nflood of commonplace eloquence in silence; and Jin Vin, whether desirous\nof stopping the flow of words--crammed thus into his ear, \u00e2\u0080\u009cagainst the\nstomach of his sense,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or whether confiding in Richie's protestations\nof friendship, which the wretched, says Fielding, are ever so ready to\nbelieve, or whether merely to give his sorrows vent in words, raised his\nhead, and turning his red and swollen eyes to Richie--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCocksbones, man, only hold thy tongue, and thou shall know all about\nit,--and then all I ask of thee is to shake hands and part.--This\nMargaret Ramsay,--you have seen her, man?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009conce, at Master George Heriot's in Lombard\nStreet--I was in the room when they dined.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, you helped to shift their trenchers, I remember,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jin Vin.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, that same pretty girl--and I will uphold her the prettiest\nbetwixt Paul's and the Bar--she is to be wedded to your Lord\nGlenvarloch, with a pestilence on him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is impossible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is raving nonsense, man--they\nmake April gouks of you cockneys every month in the year--The Lord\nGlenvarloch marry the daughter of a Lonnon mechanic! I would as soon\nbelieve the great Prester John would marry the daughter of a Jew\npackman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHark ye, brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jin Vin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will allow no one to speak\ndisregardfully of the city, for all I am in trouble.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI crave your pardon, man--I meant no offence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut as to\nthe marriage, it is a thing simply impossible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a thing that will take place, though, for the Duke and the\nPrince, and all of them, have a finger in it; and especially the old\nfool of a king, that makes her out to be some great woman in her own\ncountry, as all the Scots pretend to be, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster Vincent, but that you are under affliction,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the consoler,\noffended on his part, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would hear no national reflections.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe afflicted youth apologised in his turns, but asserted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit was true\nthat the king said Peg-a-Ramsay was some far-off sort of noblewoman; and\nthat he had taken a great interest in the match, and had run about like\nan old gander, cackling about Peggie ever since he had seen her in hose\nand doublet--and no wonder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added poor Vin, with a deep sigh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis may be all true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthough it sounds strange in my\nears; but, man, you should not speak evil of dignities---Curse not the\nking, Jenkin; not even in thy bed-chamber--stone walls have ears--no one\nhas a right to know better than I.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not curse the foolish old man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I would have\nthem carry things a peg lower.--If they were to see on a plain field\nthirty thousand such pikes as I have seen in the artillery gardens,\nit would not be their long-haired courtiers would help them, I trow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n [Footnote: Clarendon remarks, that the importance of the military\nexercise of the citizens was severely felt by the cavaliers during the\ncivil war, notwithstanding the ridicule that had been showered upon it\nby the dramatic poets of the day. Nothing less than habitual practice\ncould, at the battle of Newbury and elsewhere, have enabled the\nLondoners to keep their ranks as pikemen, in spite of the repeated\ncharge of the fiery Prince Rupert and his gallant cavaliers.]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHout tout, man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmind where the Stewarts come frae, and\nnever think they would want spears or claymores either; but leaving sic\nmatters, whilk are perilous to speak on, I say once more, what is your\nconcern in all this matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy, have I not fixed on Peg-a-Ramsay to be\nmy true love, from the day I came to her old father's shop? and have I\nnot carried her pattens and her chopines for three years, and borne her\nprayer-book to church, and brushed the cushion for her to kneel down\nupon, and did she ever say me nay?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see no cause she had,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif the like of such small\nservices were all that ye proffered. Ah, man! there are few--very few,\neither of fools or of wise men, ken how to guide a woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, did I not serve her at the risk of my freedom, and very nigh at\nthe risk of my neck? Did she not--no, it was not her neither, but that\naccursed beldam whom she caused to work upon me--persuade me like a fool\nto turn myself into a waterman to help my lord, and a plague to him,\ndown to Scotland? and instead of going peaceably down to the ship at\nGravesend, did not he rant and bully, and show his pistols, and make\nme land him at Greenwich, where he played some swaggering pranks, that\nhelped both him and me into the Tower?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAha!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, throwing more than his usual wisdom into his looks,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cso you were the green-jacketed waterman that rowed Lord Glenvarloch\ndown the river?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe more fool I, that did not souse him in the Thames,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand I was the lad who would not confess one word of who and what I\nwas, though they threatened to make me hug the Duke of Exeter's\ndaughter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Footnote: A particular species of rack, used at the Tower of\nLondon, was so called.]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWha is she, man?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie; \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe must be an ill-fashioned piece, if\nyou're so much afraid of her, and she come of such high kin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean the rack--the rack, man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere were you bred\nthat never heard of the Duke of Exeter's daughter? But all the dukes and\nduchesses in England could have got nothing out of me--so the truth came\nout some other way, and I was set free.--Home I ran, thinking myself\none of the cleverest and happiest fellows in the ward. And she--she--she\nwanted to pay me with _money_ for all my true service! and she spoke so\nsweetly and so coldly at the same time, I wished myself in the deepest\ndungeon of the Tower--I wish they had racked me to death before I heard\nthis Scottishman was to chouse me out of my sweetheart!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut are ye sure ye have lost her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit sounds strange\nin my ears that my Lord Glenvarloch should marry the daughter of a\ndealer,--though there are uncouth marriages made in London, I'll allow\nthat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, I tell you this lord was no sooner clear of the Tower, than he and\nMaster George Heriot comes to make proposals for her, with the king's\nassent, and what not; and fine fair-day prospects of Court favour for\nthis lord, for he hath not an acre of land.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, and what said the auld watch-maker?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas he not, as\nmight weel beseem him, ready to loop out of his skin-case for very joy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe multiplied six figures progressively, and reported the product--then\ngave his consent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what did you do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI rushed into the streets,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the poor lad, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith a burning heart\nand a blood-shot eye--and where did I first find myself, but with that\nbeldam, Mother Suddlechop--and what did she propose to me, but to take\nthe road?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake the road, man? in what sense?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven as a clerk to Saint Nicholas--as a highwayman, like Poins and\nPeto, and the good fellows in the play--and who think you was to be my\ncaptain?--for she had the whole out ere I could speak to her--I fancy\nshe took silence for consent, and thought me damned too unutterably\nto have one thought left that savoured of redemption--who was to be my\ncaptain, but the knave that you saw me cudgel at the ordinary when you\nwaited on Lord Glenvarloch, a cowardly, sharking, thievish bully about\ntown here, whom they call Colepepper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cColepepper--umph--I know somewhat of that smaik,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie; \u00e2\u0080\u009cken ye\nby ony chance where he may be heard of, Master Jenkin?--ye wad do me a\nsincere service to tell me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, he lives something obscurely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the apprentice, \u00e2\u0080\u009con\naccount of suspicion of some villainy--I believe that horrid murder in\nWhitefriars, or some such matter. But I might have heard all about him\nfrom Dame Suddlechop, for she spoke of my meeting him at Enfield Chase,\nwith some other good fellows, to do a robbery on one that goes northward\nwith a store of treasure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you did not agree to this fine project?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Moniplies.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cursed her for a hag, and came away about my business,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered\nJenkin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, and what said she to that, man? That would startle her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nRichie.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a whit. She laughed, and said she was in jest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Jenkin;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I know the she-devil's jest from her earnest too well to be taken\nin that way. But she knows I would never betray her.'\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBetray her! No,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Richie; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut are ye in any shape bound to this\nbirkie Peppercull, or Colepepper, or whatever they call him, that ye\nsuld let him do a robbery on the honest gentleman that is travelling to\nthe north, and may be a kindly Scot, for what we know?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy--going home with a load of English money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut be he\nwho he will, they may rob the whole world an they list, for I am robbed\nand ruined.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRichie filled his friend's cup up to the brim, and insisted that he\nshould drink what he called \u00e2\u0080\u009cclean caup out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis love,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cis but a bairnly matter for a brisk young fellow like yourself, Master\nJenkin. And if ye must needs have a whimsy, though I think it would be\nsafer to venture on a staid womanly body, why, here be as bonny lasses\nin London as this Peg-a-Ramsay. You need not sigh sae deeply, for it is\nvery true--there is as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it. Now\nwherefore should you, who are as brisk and trig a young fellow of your\ninches as the sun needs to shine on--wherefore need you sit moping this\nway, and not try some bold way to better your fortune?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell you, Master Moniplies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am as poor as any\nScot among you--I have broke my indenture, and I think of running my\ncountry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA-well-a-day!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut that maunna be, man--I ken weel, by\nsad experience, that poortith takes away pith, and the man sits full\nstill that has a rent in his breeks. [Footnote: This elegant speech was\nmade by the Earl of Douglas, called Tineman after being wounded and made\nprisoner at the battle of Shrewsbury, where\n\n     \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis well labouring sword\n     Had three times slain the semblance of the king,\u00e2\u0080\u009d]\n\nBut courage, man; you have served me heretofore, and I will serve you\nnow.

I hate that braggart, that\nbloody-minded, cowardly bully. If you can get me mounted I care not if I\nshow you where the dame told me I should meet him--but you must stand\nto the risk, for though he is a coward himself, I know he will have more\nthan one stout fellow with him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe'll have a warrant, man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand the hue and cry, to\nboot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will have no such thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I am to go with you.

I am sworn to cutter's law, and will\nsell no man's blood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAweel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca wilful man must have his way; ye must think\nthat I was born and bred where cracked crowns were plentier than whole\nones. Besides, I have two noble friends here, Master Lowestoffe of the\nTemple, and his cousin Master Ringwood, that will blithely be of so\ngallant a party.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLowestoffe and Ringwood!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenkin; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey are both brave\ngallants--they will be sure company.

Go, try if you can bring them\nhither, since you have so much to say with, them. We must not be seen\nabroad together.--I know not how it is, Master Moniplies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued he,\nas his countenance brightened up, and while, in his turn, he filled the\ncups, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I feel my heart something lighter since I have thought of\nthis matter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThus it is to have counsellors, Master Jenkin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand truly\nI hope to hear you say that your heart is as light as a lavrock's, and\nthat before you are many days aulder. Never smile and shake your head,\nbut mind what I tell you--and bide here in the meanwhile, till I go to\nseek these gallants. I warrant you, cart-ropes would not hold them back\nfrom such a ploy as I shall propose to them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\n\n  The thieves have bound the true men--\n  Now, could thou and I rob the thieves, and go\n   merrily to London.\n                    _Henry IV., Part I._\n\nThe sun was high upon the glades of Enfield Chase, and the deer, with\nwhich it then abounded, were seen sporting in picturesque groups among\nthe ancient oaks of the forest, when a cavalier and a lady, on foot,\nalthough in riding apparel, sauntered slowly up one of the long alleys\nwhich were cut through the park for the convenience of the hunters.\nTheir only attendant was a page, who, riding a Spanish jennet, which\nseemed to bear a heavy cloak-bag, followed them at a respectful\ndistance. The female, attired in all the fantastic finery of the period,\nwith more than the usual quantity of bugles, flounces, and trimmings,\nand holding her fan of ostrich feathers in one hand, and her riding-mask\nof black velvet in the other, seemed anxious, by all the little coquetry\npractised on such occasions, to secure the notice of her companion,\nwho sometimes heard her prattle without seeming to attend to it, and\nat other times interrupted his train of graver reflections, to reply to\nher.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, but, my lord--my lord, you walk so fast, you will leave me behind\nyou.--Nay, I will have hold of your arm, but how to manage with my mask\nand my fan? Why would you not let me bring my waiting-gentlewoman to\nfollow us, and hold my things? But see, I will put my fan in my girdle,\nsoh!--and now that I have a hand to hold you with, you shall not run\naway from me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome on, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the gallant, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand let us walk apace, since you\nwould not be persuaded to stay with your gentlewoman, as you call her,\nand with the rest of the baggage.--You may perhaps see _that_, though,\nyou will not like to see.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe took hold of his arm accordingly; but as he continued to walk at the\nsame pace, she shortly let go her hold, exclaiming that he had hurt her\nhand. The cavalier stopped, and looked at the pretty hand and arm which\nshe showed him, with exclamations against his cruelty. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI dare say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nsaid, baring her wrist and a part of her arm, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is all black and blue\nto the very elbow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI dare say you are a silly little fool,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the cavalier, carelessly\nkissing the aggrieved arm; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is only a pretty incarnate which sets off\nthe blue veins.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, my lord, now it is you are silly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the dame; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I am\nglad I can make you speak and laugh on any terms this morning. I am\nsure, if I did insist on following you into the forest, it was all\nfor the sake of diverting you. I am better company than your page, I\ntrow.--And now, tell me, these pretty things with horns, be they not\ndeer?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven such they be, Nelly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered her neglectful attendant.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what can the great folk do with so many of them, forsooth?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey send them to the city, Nell, where wise men make venison pasties\nof their flesh, and wear their horns for trophies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lord\nDalgarno, whom our reader has already recognised.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, now you laugh at me, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered his companion; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I know\nall about venison, whatever you may think. I always tasted it once a\nyear when we dined with Mr. Deputy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued, sadly, as a sense\nof her degradation stole across a mind bewildered with vanity and\nfolly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthough he would not speak to me now, if we met together in the\nnarrowest lane in the Ward!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI warrant he would not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause thou, Nell,\nwouldst dash him with a single look; for I trust thou hast more spirit\nthan to throw away words on such a fellow as he?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho, I!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Nelly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, I scorn the proud princox too much for\nthat. Do you know, he made all the folk in the Ward stand cap in hand to\nhim, my poor old John Christie and all?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here her recollection began to\noverflow at her eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA plague on your whimpering,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dalgarno, somewhat harshly,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay,\nnever look pale for the matter, Nell. I am not angry with you, you\nsimple fool. But what would you have me think, when you are eternally\nlooking back upon your dungeon yonder by the river, which smelt of pitch\nand old cheese worse than a Welshman does of onions, and all this when I\nam taking you down to a castle as fine as is in Fairy Land!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShall we be there to-night, my lord?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nelly, drying her tears.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo-night, Nelly?--no, nor this night fortnight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, the Lord be with us, and keep us!--But shall we not go by sea,\nmy lord?--I thought everybody came from Scotland by sea. I am sure Lord\nGlenvarloch and Richie Moniplies came up by sea.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a wide difference between coming up and going down, Nelly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered Lord Dalgarno.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd so there is, for certain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his simple companion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut yet I\nthink I heard people speaking of going down to Scotland by sea, as well\nas coming up. Are you well avised of the way?--Do you think it possible\nwe can go by land, my sweet lord?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is but trying, my sweet lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMen say England\nand Scotland are in the same island, so one would hope there may be some\nroad betwixt them by land.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall never be able to ride so far,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will have your saddle stuffed softer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lord. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell you\nthat you shall mew your city slough, and change from the caterpillar of\na paltry lane into the butterfly of a prince's garden. You shall have as\nmany tires as there are hours in the day--as many handmaidens as\nthere are days in the week--as many menials as there are weeks in the\nyear--and you shall ride a hunting and hawking with a lord, instead of\nwaiting upon an old ship-chandler, who could do nothing but hawk and\nspit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, but will you make me your lady?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dame Nelly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, surely--what else?\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the lord--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lady-love.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, but I mean your lady-wife,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nelly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTruly, Nell, in that I cannot promise to oblige you. A lady-wife,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n continued Dalgarno, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis a very different thing from a lady-love.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI heard from Mrs. Suddlechop, whom you lodged me with since I left poor\nold John Christie, that Lord Glenvarloch is to marry David Ramsay the\nclockmaker's daughter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is much betwixt the cup and the lip, Nelly. I wear something\nabout me may break the bans of that hopeful alliance, before the day is\nmuch older,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lord Dalgarno.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, but my father was as good a man as old Davy Ramsay, and as well\nto pass in the world, my lord; and, therefore, why should you not marry\nme? You have done me harm enough, I trow--wherefore should you not do me\nthis justice?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor two good reasons, Nelly. Fate put a husband on you, and the king\npassed a wife upon me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lord Dalgarno.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nelly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut they remain in England, and we go to\nScotland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThy argument is better than thou art aware of,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Dalgarno. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nhave heard Scottish lawyers say the matrimonial tie may be unclasped\nin our happy country by the gentle hand of the ordinary course of law,\nwhereas in England it can only be burst by an act of Parliament. Well,\nNelly, we will look into that matter; and whether we get married again\nor no, we will at least do our best to get unmarried.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShall we indeed, my honey-sweet lord? and then I will think less about\nJohn Christie, for he will marry again, I warrant you, for he is well to\npass; and I would be glad to think he had somebody to take care of him,\nas I used to do, poor loving old man! He was a kind man, though he was\na score of years older than I; and I hope and pray he will never let a\nyoung lord cross his honest threshold again!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere the dame was once more much inclined to give way to a passion of\ntears; but Lord Dalgarno conjured down the emotion, by saying with some\nasperity--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am weary of these April passions, my pretty mistress, and\nI think you will do well to preserve your tears for some more pressing\noccasion. Who knows what turn of fortune may in a few minutes call for\nmore of them than you can render?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGoodness, my lord! what mean you by such expressions? John Christie\n(the kind heart!) used to keep no secrets from me, and I hope your\nlordship will not hide your counsel from me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSit down beside me on this bank,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the nobleman; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am bound to\nremain here for a short space, and if you can be but silent, I should\nlike to spend a part of it in considering how far I can, on the present\noccasion, follow the respectable example which you recommend to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe place at which he stopped was at that time little more than a mound,\npartly surrounded by a ditch, from which it derived the name of Camlet\nMoat. A few hewn stones there were, which had escaped the fate of many\nothers that had been used in building different lodges in the forest for\nthe royal keepers. These vestiges, just sufficient to show that \u00e2\u0080\u009cherein\nformer times the hand of man had been,\u00e2\u0080\u009d marked the ruins of the abode of\na once illustrious but long-forgotten family, the Mandevilles, Earls\nof Essex, to whom Enfield Chase and the extensive domains adjacent had\nbelonged in elder days. A wild woodland prospect led the eye at various\npoints through broad and seemingly interminable alleys, which, meeting\nat this point as at a common centre, diverged from each other as they\nreceded, and had, therefore, been selected by Lord Dalgarno as\nthe rendezvous for the combat, which, through the medium of Richie\nMoniplies, he had offered to his injured friend, Lord Glenvarloch.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe will surely come?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to himself; \u00e2\u0080\u009ccowardice was not wont to\nbe his fault--at least he was bold enough in the Park.--Perhaps yonder\nchurl may not have carried my message? But no--he is a sturdy knave--one\nof those would prize their master's honour above their life.--Look to\nthe palfrey, Lutin, and see thou let him not loose, and cast thy falcon\nglance down every avenue to mark if any one comes.--Buckingham has\nundergone my challenge, but the proud minion pleads the king's paltry\ncommands for refusing to answer me. If I can baffle this Glenvarloch, or\nslay him--If I can spoil him of his honour or his life, I shall go down\nto Scotland with credit sufficient to gild over past mischances. I know\nmy dear countrymen--they never quarrel with any one who brings them\nhome either gold or martial glory, much more if he has both gold and\nlaurels.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs he thus reflected, and called to mind the disgrace which he had\nsuffered, as well as the causes he imagined for hating Lord Glenvarloch,\nhis countenance altered under the influence of his contending emotions,\nto the terror of Nelly, who, sitting unnoticed at his feet, and looking\nanxiously in his face, beheld the cheek kindle, the mouth become\ncompressed, the eye dilated, and the whole countenance express the\ndesperate and deadly resolution of one who awaits an instant and\ndecisive encounter with a mortal enemy. The loneliness of the place, the\nscenery so different from that to which alone she had been accustomed,\nthe dark and sombre air which crept so suddenly over the countenance\nof her seducer, his command imposing silence upon her, and the apparent\nstrangeness of his conduct in idling away so much time without any\nobvious cause, when a journey of such length lay before them, brought\nstrange thoughts into her weak brain. She had read of women, seduced\nfrom their matrimonial duties by sorcerers allied to the hellish powers,\nnay, by the Father of Evil himself, who, after conveying his victim\ninto some desert remote from human kind, exchanged the pleasing shape in\nwhich he gained her affections, for all his natural horrors. She chased\nthis wild idea away as it crowded itself upon her weak and bewildered\nimagination; yet she might have lived to see it realised allegorically,\nif not literally, but for the accident which presently followed.\n\nThe page, whose eyes were remarkably acute, at length called out to\nhis master, pointing with his finger at the same time down one of the\nalleys, that horsemen were advancing in that direction. Lord Dalgarno\nstarted up, and shading his eyes with his hand, gazed eagerly down the\nalley; when, at the same instant, he received a shot, which, grazing his\nhand, passed right through his brain, and laid him a lifeless corpse\nat the feet, or rather across the lap, of the unfortunate victim of\nhis profligacy. The countenance, whose varied expression she had been\nwatching for the last five minutes, was convulsed for an instant, and\nthen stiffened into rigidity for ever. Three ruffians rushed from the\nbrake from which the shot had been fired, ere the smoke was dispersed.\nOne, with many imprecations seized on the page; another on the female,\nupon whose cries he strove by the most violent threats to impose\nsilence; whilst the third began to undo the burden from the page's\nhorse. But an instant rescue prevented their availing themselves of the\nadvantage they had obtained.\n\nIt may easily be supposed that Richie Moniplies, having secured the\nassistance of the two Templars, ready enough to join in any thing\nwhich promised a fray, with Jin Vin to act as their guide, had set off,\ngallantly mounted and well armed, under the belief that they would reach\nCamlet Moat before the robbers, and apprehend them in the fact. They\nhad not calculated that, according to the custom of robbers in other\ncountries, but contrary to that of the English highwayman of those\ndays, they meant to ensure robbery by previous murder. An accident also\nhappened to delay them a little while on the road. In riding through\none of the glades of the forest, they found a man dismounted and sitting\nunder a tree, groaning with such bitterness of spirit, that Lowestoffe\ncould not forbear asking if he was hurt. In answer, he said he was\nan unhappy man in pursuit of his wife, who had been carried off by a\nvillain; and as he raised his countenance, the eyes of Richie, to his\ngreat astonishment, encountered the visage of John Christie.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the Almighty's sake, help me, Master Moniplies!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have\nlearned my wife is but a short mile before, with that black villain Lord\nDalgarno.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave him forward by all means,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lowestoffe; \u00e2\u0080\u009ca second Orpheus\nseeking his Eurydice!--Have him forward--we will save Lord Dalgarno's\npurse, and ease him of his mistress--Have him with us, were it but for\nthe variety of the adventure. I owe his lordship a grudge for rooking\nme. We have ten minutes good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut it is dangerous to calculate closely in matters of life and death.\nIn all probability the minute or two which was lost in mounting John\nChristie behind one of their party, might have saved Lord Dalgarno\nfrom his fate. Thus his criminal amour became the indirect cause of\nhis losing his life; and thus \u00e2\u0080\u009cour pleasant vices are made the whips to\nscourge us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe riders arrived on the field at full gallop the moment after the shot\nwas fired; and Richie, who had his own reasons for attaching himself to\nColepepper, who was bustling to untie the portmanteau from the page's\nsaddle, pushed against him with such violence as to overthrow him, his\nown horse at the same time stumbling and dismounting his rider, who was\nnone of the first equestrians. The undaunted Richie immediately arose,\nhowever, and grappled with the ruffian with such good-will, that, though\na strong fellow, and though a coward now rendered desperate, Moniplies\ngot him under, wrenched a long knife from his hand, dealt him a\ndesperate stab with his own weapon, and leaped on his feet; and, as the\nwounded man struggled to follow his example, he struck him upon the head\nwith the butt-end of a musketoon, which last blow proved fatal.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBravo, Richie!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Lowestoffe, who had himself engaged\nat sword-point with one of the ruffians, and soon put him to\nflight,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cBravo! why, man, there lies Sin, struck down like an ox, and\nIniquity's throat cut like a calf.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know not why you should upbraid me with my upbringing, Master\nLowestoffe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Richie, with great composure; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I can tell you,\nthe shambles is not a bad place for training one to this work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe other Templar now shouted loudly to them,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf ye be men, come\nhither--here lies Lord Dalgarno, murdered!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLowestoffe and Richie ran to the spot, and the page took the\nopportunity, finding himself now neglected on all hands, to ride off\nin a different direction; and neither he, nor the considerable sum with\nwhich his horse was burdened, were ever heard of from that moment.\n\nThe third ruffian had not waited the attack of the Templar and Jin Vin,\nthe latter of whom had put down old Christie from behind him that he\nmight ride the lighter; and the whole five now stood gazing with horror\non the bloody corpse of the young nobleman, and the wild sorrow of the\nfemale, who tore her hair and shrieked in the most disconsolate manner,\nuntil her agony was at once checked, or rather received a new direction,\nby the sudden and unexpected appearance of her husband, who, fixing on\nher a cold and severe look, said, in a tone suited to his manner--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\nwoman! thou takest on sadly for the loss of thy paramour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--Then,\nlooking on the bloody corpse of him from whom he had received so deep an\ninjury, he repeated the solemn words of Scripture,--\u00e2\u0080\u009c'Vengeance is mine,\nsaith the Lord, and I will repay it.'--I, whom thou hast injured, will\nbe first to render thee the decent offices due to the dead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he covered the dead body with his cloak, and then looking on\nit for a moment, seemed to reflect on what he had next to perform. As\nthe eye of the injured man slowly passed from the body of the seducer\nto the partner and victim of his crime, who had sunk down to his feet,\nwhich she clasped without venturing to look up, his features, naturally\ncoarse and saturnine, assumed a dignity of expression which overawed\nthe young Templars, and repulsed the officious forwardness of Richie\nMoniplies, who was at first eager to have thrust in his advice and\nopinion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cKneel not to me, woman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut kneel to the God\nthou hast offended, more than thou couldst offend such another worm as\nthyself. How often have I told thee, when thou wert at the gayest and\nthe lightest, that pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit\nbefore a fall? Vanity brought folly, and folly brought sin, and sin hath\nbrought death, his original companion. Thou must needs leave duty, and\ndecency, and domestic love, to revel it gaily with the wild and with the\nwicked; and there thou liest like a crushed worm, writhing beside the\nlifeless body of thy paramour. Thou hast done me much wrong--dishonoured\nme among friends--driven credit from my house, and peace from my\nfireside--But thou wert my first and only love, and I will not see\nthee an utter castaway, if it lies with me to prevent it.--Gentlemen,\nI render ye such thanks as a broken-hearted man can give.--Richard,\ncommend me to your honourable master. I added gall to the bitterness of\nhis affliction, but I was deluded.--Rise up, woman, and follow me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe raised her up by the arm, while, with streaming eyes, and bitter\nsobs, she endeavoured to express her penitence. She kept her hands\nspread over her face, yet suffered him to lead her away; and it was only\nas they turned around a brake which concealed the scene they had left,\nthat she turned back, and casting one wild and hurried glance towards\nthe corpse of Dalgarno, uttered a shriek, and clinging to her husband's\narm, exclaimed wildly,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSave me--save me! They have murdered him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLowestoffe was much moved by what he had witnessed; but he was ashamed,\nas a town-gallant, of his own unfashionable emotion, and did a force\nto his feelings when he exclaimed,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, let them go--the kind-hearted,\nbelieving, forgiving husband--the liberal, accommodating spouse. O what\na generous creature is your true London husband!--Horns hath he, but,\ntame as a fatted ox, he goreth not. I should like to see her when\nshe hath exchanged her mask and riding-beaver for her peaked hat\nand muffler. We will visit them at Paul's Wharf, coz--it will be a\nconvenient acquaintance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou had better think of catching the gipsy thief, Lutin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie\nMoniplies; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor, by my faith, he is off with his master's baggage and\nthe siller.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA keeper, with his assistants, and several other persons, had now come\nto the spot, and made hue and cry after Lutin, but in vain. To their\ncustody the Templars surrendered the dead bodies, and after going\nthrough some formal investigation, they returned, with Richard and\nVincent, to London, where they received great applause for their\ngallantry.--Vincent's errors were easily expiated, in consideration\nof his having been the means of breaking up this band of villains;\nand there is some reason to think, that what would have diminished\nthe credit of the action in other instances, rather added to it in\nthe actual circumstances, namely, that they came too late to save Lord\nDalgarno.\n\nGeorge Heriot, who suspected how matters stood with Vincent, requested\nand obtained permission from his master to send the poor young fellow on\nan important piece of business to Paris. We are unable to trace his\nfate farther, but believe it was prosperous, and that he entered into\nan advantageous partnership with his fellow-apprentice, upon old\nDavy Ramsay retiring from business, in consequence of his daughter's\nmarriage. That eminent antiquary, Dr. Dryasdust, is possessed of an\nantique watch, with a silver dial-plate, the mainspring being a piece\nof catgut instead of a chain, which bears the names of Vincent and\nTunstall, Memory-Monitors.\n\nMaster Lowestoffe failed not to vindicate his character as a man of\ngaiety, by inquiring after John Christie and Dame Nelly; but greatly to\nhis surprise, (indeed to his loss, for he had wagered ten pieces that he\nwould domesticate himself in the family,) he found the good-will, as\nit was called, of the shop, was sold, the stock auctioned, and the late\nproprietor and his wife gone, no one knew whither. The prevailing belief\nwas, that they had emigrated to one of the new settlements in America.\n\nLady Dalgarno received the news of her unworthy husband's death with a\nvariety of emotions, among which, horror that he should have been cut\noff in the middle career of his profligacy, was the most prominent.\nThe incident greatly deepened her melancholy, and injured her health,\nalready shaken by previous circumstances. Repossessed of her own\nfortune by her husband's death, she was anxious to do justice to Lord\nGlenvarloch, by treating for the recovery of the mortgage.\n\nBut the scrivener, having taken fright at the late events, had left the\ncity and absconded, so that it was impossible to discover into whose\nhands the papers had now passed. Richard Moniplies was silent, for his\nown reasons; the Templars, who had witnessed the transaction, kept\nthe secret at his request, and it was universally believed that the\nscrivener had carried off the writings along with him. We may here\nobserve, that fears similar to those of Skurliewhitter freed London for\never from the presence of Dame Suddlechop, who ended her career in the\n_Rasp-haus_, (viz. Bridewell,) of Amsterdam.\n\nThe stout old Lord Huntinglen, with a haughty carriage and unmoistened\neye, accompanied the funeral procession of his only son to its last\nabode; and perhaps the single tear which fell at length upon the coffin,\nwas given less to the fate of the individual, than to the extinction of\nthe last male of his ancient race.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\n\n_Jacques_. There is, suie, another flood toward, and these couples are\ncoming to the ark!--Here comes a pair of very strange beasts.--_As You\nLike It_.\n\nThe fashion of such narratives as the present, changes like other\nearthly things. Time was that the tale-teller was obliged to wind up\nhis story by a circumstantial description of the wedding, bedding, and\nthrowing the stocking, as the grand catastrophe to which, through so\nmany circumstances of doubt and difficulty, he had at length happily\nconducted his hero and heroine. Not a circumstance was then omitted,\nfrom the manly ardour of the bridegroom, and the modest blushes of the\nbride, to the parson's new surplice, and the silk tabinet mantua of\nthe bridesmaid. But such descriptions are now discarded, for the same\nreason, I suppose, that public marriages are no longer fashionable, and\nthat, instead of calling together their friends to a feast and a dance,\nthe happy couple elope in a solitary post-chaise, as secretly as if they\nmeant to go to Gretna-Green, or to do worse. I am not ungrateful for a\nchange which saves an author the trouble of attempting in vain to give\na new colour to the commonplace description of such matters; but,\nnotwithstanding, I find myself forced upon it in the present instance,\nas circumstances sometimes compel a stranger to make use of an old road\nwhich has been for some time shut up. The experienced reader may have\nalready remarked, that the last chapter was employed in sweeping out\nof the way all the unnecessary and less interesting characters, that I\nmight clear the floor for a blithe bridal.\n\nIn truth, it would be unpardonable to pass over slightly what so\ndeeply interested our principal personage, King James. That learned and\ngood-humoured monarch made no great figure in the politics of Europe;\nbut then, to make amends, he was prodigiously busy, when he could find a\nfair opportunity of intermeddling with the private affairs of his loving\nsubjects, and the approaching marriage of Lord Glenvarloch was matter\nof great interest to him. He had been much struck (that is, for him,\nwho was not very accessible to such emotions) with the beauty and\nembarrassment of the pretty Peg-a-Ramsay, as he called her, when he\nfirst saw her, and he glorified himself greatly on the acuteness which\nhe had displayed in detecting her disguise, and in carrying through the\nwhole inquiry which took place in consequence of it.\n\nHe laboured for several weeks, while the courtship was in progress, with\nhis own royal eyes, so as wellnigh to wear out, he declared, a pair\nof her father's best barnacles, in searching through old books and\ndocuments, for the purpose of establishing the bride's pretensions to\na noble, though remote descent, and thereby remove the only objection\nwhich envy might conceive against the match. In his own opinion, at\nleast, he was eminently successful; for, when Sir Mungo Malagrowther one\nday, in the presence-chamber, took upon him to grieve bitterly for the\nbride's lack of pedigree, the monarch cut him short with, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYe may save\nyour grief for your ain next occasions, Sir Mungo; for, by our royal\nsaul, we will uphauld her father, Davy Ramsay, to be a gentleman of nine\ndescents, whase great gudesire came of the auld martial stock of the\nHouse of Dalwolsey, than whom better men never did, and better never\nwill, draw sword for king and country. Heard ye never of Sir William\nRamsay of Dalwolsey, man, of whom John Fordoun saith,--'He was\n_bellicosissimus, nobilissimus?_'--His castle stands to witness for\nitsell, not three miles from Dalkeith, man, and within a mile of\nBannockrig. Davy Ramsay came of that auld and honoured stock, and I\ntrust he hath not derogated from his ancestors by his present craft.\nThey all wrought wi' steel, man; only the auld knights drilled holes wi'\ntheir swords in their enemies' corslets, and he saws nicks in his brass\nwheels. And I hope it is as honourable to give eyes to the blind as\nto slash them out of the head of those that see, and to show us how to\nvalue our time as it passes, as to fling it away in drinking, brawling,\nspear-splintering, and such-like unchristian doings. And you maun\nunderstand, that Davy Ramsay is no mechanic, but follows a liberal art,\nwhich approacheth almost to the act of creating a living being,\nseeing it may be said of a watch, as Claudius saith of the sphere of\nArchimedes, the Syracusan--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cInclusus variis famulatur spiritus astris, Et vivum certis motibus\nurget opus.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Majesty had best give auld Davy a coat-of-arms, as well as a\npedigree,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Mungo.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's done, or ye bade, Sir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I trust we, who\nare the fountain of all earthly honour, are free to spirit a few drops\nof it on one so near our person, without offence to the Knight of Castle\nGirnigo. We have already spoken with the learned men of the Herald's\nCollege, and we propose to grant him an augmented coat-of-arms, being\nhis paternal coat, charged with the crown-wheel of a watch in chief, for\na difference; and we purpose to add Time and Eternity, for supporters,\nas soon as the Garter King-at-Arms shall be able to devise how Eternity\nis to be represented.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would make him twice as muckle as Time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Footnote: Chaucer says,\nthere is nothing new but what it has been old. The reader has here the\noriginal of an anecdote which has since been fathered on a Scottish\nChief of our own time.] said Archie Armstrong, the Court fool, who\nchanced to be present when the king stated this dilemma. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeace, man--ye\nshall be whippet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, in return for this hint; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand you, my\nliege subjects of England, may weel take a hint from what we have said,\nand not be in such a hurry to laugh at our Scottish pedigrees, though\nthey be somewhat long derived, and difficult to be deduced. Ye see that\na man of right gentle blood may, for a season, lay by his gentry, and\nyet ken whare to find it, when he has occasion for it. It would be as\nunseemly for a packman, or pedlar, as ye call a travelling merchant,\nwhilk is a trade to which our native subjects of Scotland are specially\naddicted, to be blazing his genealogy in the faces of those to whom he\nsells a bawbee's worth of ribbon, as it would be to him to have a\nbeaver on his head, and a rapier by his side, when the pack was on his\nshoulders. Na, na--he hings his sword on the cleek, lays his beaver on\nthe shelf, puts his pedigree into his pocket, and gangs as doucely and\ncannily about his peddling craft as if his blood was nae better than\nditch-water; but let our pedlar be transformed, as I have kend it happen\nmair than ance, into a bein thriving merchant, then ye shall have a\ntransformation, my lords.\n\n     'In nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas--'\n\nOut he pulls his pedigree, on he buckles his sword, gives his beaver a\nbrush, and cocks it in the face of all creation. We mention these things\nat the mair length, because we would have you all to know, that it is\nnot without due consideration of the circumstances of all parties, that\nwe design, in a small and private way, to honour with our own royal\npresence the marriage of Lord Glenvarloch with Margaret Ramsay, daughter\nand heiress of David Ramsay, our horologer, and a cadet only thrice\nremoved from the ancient house of Dalwolsey. We are grieved we cannot\nhave the presence of the noble Chief of that House at the ceremony; but\nwhere there is honour to be won abroad the Lord Dalwolsey is seldom\nto be found at home. _Sic fuit, est, et erit_.-Jingling Geordie, as ye\nstand to the cost of the marriage feast, we look for good cheer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHeriot bowed, as in duty bound. In fact, the king, who was a great\npolitician about trifles, had manoeuvred greatly on this occasion,\nand had contrived to get the Prince and Buckingham dispatched on an\nexpedition to Newmarket, in order that he might find an opportunity in\ntheir absence of indulging himself in his own gossiping, _coshering_\nhabits, which were distasteful to Charles, whose temper inclined to\nformality, and with which even the favourite, of late, had not thought\nit worth while to seem to sympathise. When the levee was dismissed, Sir\nMungo Malagrowther seized upon the worthy citizen in the court-yard\nof the Palace, and detained him, in spite of all his efforts, for the\npurpose of subjecting him to the following scrutiny:--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a sair job on you, Master George--the king must have had little\nconsideration--this will cost you a bonny penny, this wedding dinner?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will not break me, Sir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe king hath a\nright to see the table which his bounty hath supplied for years, well\ncovered for a single day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVera true, vera true--we'll have a' to pay, I doubt, less or mair--a\nsort of penny-wedding it will prove, where all men contribute to the\nyoung folk's maintenance, that they may not have just four bare legs in\na bed together. What do you propose to give, Master George?--we begin\nwith the city when money is in question.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Footnote: The penny-wedding\nof the Scots, now disused even among the lowest ranks, was a peculiar\nspecies of merry-making, at which, if the wedded pair were popular, the\nguests who convened, contributed considerable sums under pretence of\npaying for the bridal festivity, but in reality to set the married folk\nafloat in the world.]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly a trifle, Sir Mungo--I give my god-daughter the marriage ring;\nit is a curious jewel--I bought it in Italy; it belonged to Cosmo\nde Medici. The bride will not need my help--she has an estate which\nbelonged to her maternal grandfather.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe auld soap-boiler,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Mungo; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit will need some of his suds\nto scour the blot out of the Glenvarloch shield--I have heard that\nestate was no great things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is as good as some posts at Court, Sir Mungo, which are coveted by\npersons of high quality,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied George Heriot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCourt favour, said ye? Court favour, Master Heriot?\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Sir Mungo,\nchoosing then to use his malady of misapprehension; \u00e2\u0080\u009cMoonshine in\nwater, poor thing, if that is all she is to be tochered with--I am truly\nsolicitous about them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will let you into a secret,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the citizen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich will relieve\nyour tender anxiety. The dowager Lady Dalgarno gives a competent fortune\nto the bride, and settles the rest of her estate upon her nephew the\nbridegroom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, say ye sae?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Mungo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust to show her regard to her\nhusband that is in the tomb--lucky that her nephew did not send him\nthere; it was a strange story that death of poor Lord Dalgarno--some\nfolk think the poor gentleman had much wrong. Little good comes of\nmarrying the daughter of the house you are at feud with; indeed, it was\nless poor Dalgarno's fault, than theirs that forced the match on him;\nbut I am glad the young folk are to have something to live on, come how\nit like, whether by charity or inheritance. But if the Lady Dalgarno\nwere to sell all she has, even to her very wylie-coat, she canna gie\nthem back the fair Castle of Glenvarloch--that is lost and gane--lost\nand gane.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is but too true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe cannot discover what has\nbecome of the villain Andrew Skurliewhitter, or what Lord Dalgarno has\ndone with the mortgage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAssigned it away to some one, that his wife might not get it after he\nwas gane; it would have disturbed him in his grave, to think Glenvarloch\nshould get that land back again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Mungo; \u00e2\u0080\u009cdepend on it, he will\nhave ta'en sure measures to keep that noble lordship out of her grips or\nher nevoy's either.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed it is but too probable, Sir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Master Heriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut\nas I am obliged to go and look after many things in consequence of this\nceremony, I must leave you to comfort yourself with the reflection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe bride-day, you say, is to be on the thirtieth of the instant\nmonth?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Mungo, holloing after the citizen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will be with you\nin the hour of cause.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe king invites the guests,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George Heriot, without turning back.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe base-born, ill-bred mechanic!\u00e2\u0080\u009d soliloquised Sir Mungo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif it were\nnot the odd score of pounds he lent me last week, I would teach him how\nto bear himself to a man of quality! But I will be at the bridal banquet\nin spite of him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSir Mungo contrived to get invited, or commanded, to attend on the\nbridal accordingly, at which there were but few persons present; for\nJames, on such occasions, preferred a snug privacy, which gave him\nliberty to lay aside the encumbrance, as he felt it to be, of his regal\ndignity. The company was very small, and indeed there were at least two\npersons absent whose presence might have been expected. The first of\nthese was the Lady Dalgarno, the state of whose health, as well as the\nrecent death of her husband, precluded her attendance on the ceremony.\nThe other absentee was Richie Moniplies, whose conduct for some time\npast had been extremely mysterious. Regulating his attendance on Lord\nGlenvarloch entirely according to his own will and pleasure, he had,\never since the rencounter in Enfield Chase, appeared regularly at his\nbedside in the morning, to assist him to dress, and at his wardrobe in\nthe evening. The rest of the day he disposed of at his own pleasure,\nwithout control from his lord, who had now a complete establishment of\nattendants. Yet he was somewhat curious to know how the fellow disposed\nof so much of his time; but on this subject Richie showed no desire to\nbe communicative.\n\nOn the morning of the bridal-day, Richie was particularly attentive in\ndoing all a valet-de-chambre could, so as to set off to advantage the\nvery handsome figure of his master; and when he had arranged his dress\nto the utmost exactness, and put to his long curled locks what he called\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe finishing touch of the redding-kaim,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he gravely kneeled down,\nkissed his hand, and bade him farewell, saying that he humbly craved\nleave to discharge himself of his lordship's service.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, what humour is this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you mean to\ndischarge yourself of my service, Richie, I suppose you intend to enter\nmy wife's?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish her good ladyship that shall soon be, and your good lordship,\nthe blessings of as good a servant as myself, in heaven's good time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said Richie; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut fate hath so ordained it, that I can henceforth only\nbe your servant in the way of friendly courtesy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Richie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young lord, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you are tired of service, we\nwill seek some better provision for you; but you will wait on me to the\nchurch, and partake of the bridal dinner?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnder favour, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Richie; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must remind you of our\ncovenant, having presently some pressing business of mine own, whilk\nwill detain me during the ceremony; but I will not fail to prie Master\nGeorge's good cheer, in respect he has made very costly fare, whilk it\nwould be unthankful not to partake of.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo as you list,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lord Glenvarloch; and having bestowed a\npassing thought on the whimsical and pragmatical disposition of his\nfollower, he dismissed the subject for others better suited to the day.\n\nThe reader must fancy the scattered flowers which strewed the path\nof the happy couple to church--the loud music which accompanied the\nprocession--the marriage service performed by a bishop--the king, who\nmet them at Saint Paul's, giving away the bride,--to the great relief\nof her father, who had thus time, during the ceremony, to calculate the\njust quotient to be laid on the pinion of report in a timepiece which he\nwas then putting together.\n\nWhen the ceremony was finished, the company were transported in the\nroyal carriages to George Heriot's, where a splendid collation was\nprovided for the marriage-guests in the Foljambe apartments. The king\nno sooner found himself in this snug retreat, than, casting from him\nhis sword and belt with such haste as if they burnt his fingers, and\nflinging his plumed hat on the table, as who should say, Lie there,\nauthority! he swallowed a hearty cup of wine to the happiness of the\nmarried couple, and began to amble about the room, mumping, laughing,\nand cracking jests, neither the wittiest nor the most delicate, but\naccompanied and applauded by shouts of his own mirth, in order to\nencourage that of the company. Whilst his Majesty was in the midst of\nthis gay humour, and a call to the banquet was anxiously expected,\na servant whispered Master Heriot forth of the apartment. When he\nre-entered, he walked up to the king, and, in his turn whispered\nsomething, at which James started.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is not wanting his siller?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, shortly and sharply.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy no means, my liege,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Heriot. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a subject he states\nhimself as quite indifferent about, so long as it can pleasure your\nMajesty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBody of us, man!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is the speech of a true man and a\nloving subject, and we will grace him accordingly--what though he be\nbut a carle--a twopenny cat may look at a king. Swith, man! have\nhim--_pundite fores_.--Moniplies?--They should have called the chield\nMonypennies, though I sall warrant you English think we have not such a\nname in Scotland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is an ancient and honourable stock, the Monypennies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Mungo\nMalagrowther; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe only loss is, there are sae few of the name.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe family seems to increase among your countrymen, Sir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nMaster Lowestoffe, whom Lord Glenvarloch had invited to be present,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009csince his Majesty's happy accession brought so many of you here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRight, sir--right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Mungo, nodding and looking at George\nHeriot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere have some of ourselves been the better of that great\nblessing to the English nation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs he spoke, the door flew open, and in entered, to the astonishment\nof Lord Glenvarloch, his late serving-man Richie Moniplies, now\nsumptuously, nay, gorgeously, attired in a superb brocaded suit, and\nleading in his hand the tall, thin, withered, somewhat distorted form\nof Martha Trapbois, arrayed in a complete dress of black velvet,\nwhich suited so strangely with the pallid and severe melancholy of her\ncountenance, that the king himself exclaimed, in some perturbation,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat the deil has the fallow brought us here? Body of our regal selves!\nit is a corpse that has run off with the mort-cloth!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I sifflicate your Majesty to be gracious unto her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbeing that she is, in respect of this morning's wark, my ain wedded\nwife, Mrs. Martha Moniplies by name.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSaul of our body, man! but she looks wondrous grim,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered King\nJames. \u00e2\u0080\u009cArt thou sure she has not been in her time maid of honour to\nQueen Mary, our kinswoman, of redhot memory?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sure, an it like your Majesty, that she has brought me fifty\nthousand pounds of good siller, and better; and that has enabled me to\npleasure your Majesty, and other folk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe need have said naething about that, man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe ken our\nobligations in that sma' matter, and we are glad this rudas spouse of\nthine hath bestowed her treasure on ane wha kens to put it to the profit\nof his king and country.--But how the deil did ye come by her, man?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the auld Scottish fashion, my liege. She is the captive of my bow\nand my spear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Moniplies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was a convention that she\nshould wed me when I avenged her father's death--so I slew, and took\npossession.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is the daughter of Old Trapbois, who has been missed so long,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nLowestoffe.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere the devil could you mew her up so closely, friend\nRichie?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster Richard, if it be your will,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Richie; \u00e2\u0080\u009cor Master\nRichard Moniplies, if you like it better. For mewing of her up, I found\nher a shelter, in all honour and safety, under the roof of an honest\ncountryman of my own--and for secrecy, it was a point of prudence, when\nwantons like you were abroad, Master Lowestoffe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was a laugh at Richie's magnanimous reply, on the part of every\none but his bride, who made to him a signal of impatience, and said,\nwith her usual brevity and sternness,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cPeace--peace, I pray you, peace.\nLet us do that which we came for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, she took out a bundle of\nparchments, and delivering them to Lord Glenvarloch, she said aloud,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\ntake this royal presence, and all here, to witness, that I restore the\nransomed lordship of Glenvarloch to the right owner, as free as ever it\nwas held by any of his ancestors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI witnessed the redemption of the mortgage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lowestoffe; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I\nlittle dreamt by whom it had been redeemed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo need ye should,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere would have been small wisdom in\ncrying roast-meat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPeace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his bride, \u00e2\u0080\u009conce more.--This paper,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued,\ndelivering another to Lord Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis also your property--take it,\nbut spare me the question how it came into my custody.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe king had bustled forward beside Lord Glenvarloch, and fixing an\neager eye on the writing, exclaimed--\u00e2\u0080\u009cBody of ourselves, it is our royal\nsign-manual for the money which was so long out of sight!--How came you\nby it, Mistress Bride?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a secret,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Martha, dryly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA secret which my tongue shall never utter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richie,\nresolutely,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cunless the king commands me on my allegiance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do--I do command you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said James, trembling and stammering with the\nimpatient curiosity of a gossip; while Sir Mungo, with more malicious\nanxiety to get at the bottom of the mystery, stooped his long thin form\nforward like a bent fishing-rod, raised his thin grey locks from his\near, and curved his hand behind it to collect every vibration of the\nexpected intelligence. Martha in the meantime frowned most ominously on\nRichie, who went on undauntedly to inform the king, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat his deceased\nfather-in-law, a good careful man in the main, had a' touch of worldly\nwisdom about him, that at times marred the uprightness of his walk;\nhe liked to dabble among his neighbour's gear, and some of it would at\ntimes stick to his fingers in the handling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor shame, man, for shame!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Martha; \u00e2\u0080\u009csince the infamy of the\ndeed must be told, be it at least briefly.--Yes, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added,\naddressing Glenvarloch, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe piece of gold was not the sole bait which\nbrought the miserable old man to your chamber that dreadful night--his\nobject, and he accomplished it, was to purloin this paper. The wretched\nscrivener was with him that morning, and, I doubt not, urged the doting\nold man to this villainy, to offer another bar to the ransom of your\nestate. If there was a yet more powerful agent at the bottom of this\nconspiracy, God forgive it to him at this moment, for he is now where\nthe crime must be answered!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAmen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Glenvarloch, and it was echoed by all present.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor my father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued she, with her stern features twitched by an\ninvoluntary and convulsive movement, \u00e2\u0080\u009chis guilt and folly cost him his\nlife; and my belief is constant, that the wretch, who counselled him\nthat morning to purloin the paper, left open the window for the entrance\nof the murderers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEvery body was silent for an instant; the king was first to speak,\ncommanding search instantly to be made for the guilty scrivener.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_I, lictor,_\u00e2\u0080\u009d he concluded, \u00e2\u0080\u009c_colliga manus--caput obnubito-infelici\nsuspendite arbori_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLowestoffe answered with due respect, that the scrivener had absconded\nat the time of Lord Dalgarno's murder, and had not been heard of since.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet him be sought for,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now let us change the\ndiscourse--these stories make one's very blood grew, and are altogether\nunfit for bridal festivity. Hymen, O Hymenee!\u00e2\u0080\u009d added he, snapping his\nfingers, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLord Glenvarloch, what say you to Mistress Moniplies, this\nbonny bride, that has brought you back your father's estate on your\nbridal day?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet him say nothing, my liege,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Martha; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat will best suit his\nfeelings and mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is redemption-money, at the least, to be repaid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord\nGlenvarloch; \u00e2\u0080\u009cin that I cannot remain debtor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will speak of it hereafter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Martha; \u00e2\u0080\u009c_my_ debtor _you_ cannot\nbe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And she shut her mouth as if determined to say nothing more on the\nsubject.\n\nSir Mungo, however, resolved not to part with the topic, and availing\nhimself of the freedom of the moment, said to Richie--\u00e2\u0080\u009cA queer story\nthat of your father-in-law, honest man; methinks your bride thanked you\nlittle for ripping it up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI make it a rule, Sir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009calways to speak any evil\nI know about my family myself, having observed, that if I do not, it is\nsure to be told by ither folks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, Richie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Mungo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit seems to me that this bride of yours\nis like to be master and mair in the conjugal state.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf she abides by words, Sir Mungo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Richie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thank heaven I\ncan be as deaf as any one; and if she comes to dunts, I have twa hands\nto paik her with.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWeel said, Richie, again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the king; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have gotten it on baith\nhaffits, Sir Mungo.--Troth, Mistress Bride, for a fule, your gudeman has\na pretty turn of wit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are fools, sire,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho have wit, and fools who\nhave courage--aye, and fools who have learning, and are great fools\nnotwithstanding.--I chose this man because he was my protector when\nI was desolate, and neither for his wit nor his wisdom. He is truly\nhonest, and has a heart and hand that make amends for some folly. Since\nI was condemned to seek a protector through the world, which is to me a\nwilderness, I may thank God that I have come by no worse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that is sae sensibly said,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the king, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat, by my saul,\nI'll try whether I canna make him better. Kneel down, Richie--somebody\nlend me a rapier--yours, Mr. Langstaff, (that's a brave name for a\nlawyer,)--ye need not flash it out that gate, Templar fashion, as if ye\nwere about to pink a bailiff!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe took the drawn sword, and with averted eyes, for it was a sight he\nloved not to look on, endeavoured to lay it on Richie's shoulder, but\nnearly stuck it into his eye. Richie, starting back, attempted to rise,\nbut was held down by Lowestoffe, while Sir Mungo, guiding the royal\nweapon, the honour-bestowing blow was given and received: \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Surge,\ncarnifex_--Rise up, Sir Richard Moniplies, of Castle-Collop!--And, my\nlords and lieges, let us all to our dinner, for the cock-a-leekie is\ncooling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nNOTES\n\n\nNote I. p. l4.--DAVID RAMSAY\n\nDavid Ramsay, watchmaker and horologer to James I., was a real person,\nthough the author has taken the liberty of pressing him into the service\nof fiction. Although his profession led him to cultivate the exact\nsciences, like many at this period he mingled them with pursuits which\nwere mystical and fantastic. The truth was, that the boundaries between\ntruth and falsehood in mathematics, astronomy, and similar pursuits,\nwere not exactly known, and there existed a sort of _terra incognita_\nbetween them, in which the wisest men bewildered themselves. David\nRamsay risked his money on the success of the vaticinations which his\nresearches led him to form, since he sold clocks and watches under\ncondition, that their value should not become payable till King James\nwas crowned in the Pope's chair at Rome. Such wagers were common in that\nday, as may be seen by looking at Jonson's Every Man out of his Humour.\n\nDavid Ramsay was also an actor in another singular scene, in which the\nnotorious astrologer Lilly was a performer, and had no small expectation\non the occasion, since he brought with him a half-quartern sack to put\nthe treasure in.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDavid Ramsay, his Majesty's clock-maker, had been informed that there\nwas a great quantity of treasure buried in the cloister of Westminster\nAbbey. He acquaints Dean Withnam therewith, who was also then Bishop\nof Lincoln. The Dean gave him liberty to search after it, with this\nproviso, that if any was discovered, his church should have a share of\nit. Davy Ramsay finds out one John Scott, who pretended the use of the\nMosaical rods, to assist him herein. [Footnote: The same now called,\nI believe, the Divining Rod, and applied to the discovery of water\nnot obvious to the eye.] I was desired to join with him, unto which\nI consented. One winter's night, Davy Ramsay, with several gentlemen,\nmyself, and Scott, entered the cloisters. We played the hazel rods round\nabout the cloisters. Upon the west end of the cloisters the rods turned\none over another, an argument that the treasure was there. The labourers\ndigged at least six feet deep, and then we met with a coffin; but which,\nin regard it was not heavy, we did not open, which we afterwards much\nrepented.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom the cloisters we went into the abbey church, where, upon a\nsudden, (there being no wind when we began,) so fierce and so high, so\nblustering and loud a wind did rise, that we verily believed the west\nend of the church would have fallen upon us. Our rods would not move at\nall; the candles and torches, also, but one were extinguished, or burned\nvery dimly. John Scott, my partner, was amazed, looked pale, knew not\nwhat to think or do, until I gave directions and command to dismiss the\ndemons; which, when done, all was quiet again, and each man returned\nunto his lodging late, about twelve o'clock at night. I could never\nsince be induced to join with any such like actions.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe true miscarriage of the business was by reason of so many people\nbeing present at the operation; for there was about thirty, some\nlaughing, others deriding us; so that, if we had not dismissed the\ndemons, I believe most part of the abbey church would have been blown\ndown. Secrecy and intelligent operators, with a strong confidence and\nknowledge of what they are doing, are best for the work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--LILLY'S _Life\nand Times_, p. 46.\n\nDavid Ramsay had a son called William Ramsay, who appears to have\npossessed all his father's credulity. He became an astrologer, and in\n1651-2 published \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Vox Stellarum_, an Introduction to the Judgment of\nEclipses and the Annual Revolutions of the World.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The edition of 1652\nis inscribed, to his father. It would appear, as indeed it might be\nargued from his mode of disposing of his goods, that the old horologer\nhad omitted to make hay while the sun shone; for his son, in his\ndedication, has this exception to the paternal virtues, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's true your\ncarelessness in laying up while the sun shone for the tempests of a\nstormy day, hath given occasion to some inferior spirited people not to\nvalue you according to what you are by nature and in yourself, for such\nlook not to a man longer than he is in prosperity, esteeming none\nbut for their wealth, not wisdom, power, nor virtue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d From these\nexpressions, it is to be apprehended that while old David Ramsay, a\nfollower of the Stewarts, sunk under the Parliamentary government, his\nson, William, had advanced from being a dupe to astrology to the dignity\nof being himself a cheat.\n\nNote II. p. 27.-GEORGE HERIOT\n\nThis excellent person was but little known by his actions when alive,\nbut we may well use, in this particular, the striking phrase of\nScripture, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat being dead he yet speaketh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d We have already mentioned,\nin the Introduction, the splendid charity of which he was the founder;\nthe few notices of his personal history are slight and meagre.\n\nGeorge Heriot was born at Trabroun, in the parish of Gladsmuir; he was\nthe eldest son of a goldsmith in Edinburgh, descended from a family of\nsome consequence in East Lothian. His father enjoyed the confidence of\nhis fellow-citizens, and was their representative in Parliament. He\nwas, besides, one of the deputies sent by the inhabitants of the city to\npropitiate the King, when he had left Edinburgh abruptly, after the riot\nof 17th December, 1596.\n\nGeorge Heriot, the son, pursued his father's occupation of a\ngoldsmith, then peculiarly lucrative, and much connected with that of a\nmoney-broker. He enjoyed the favour and protection of James, and of his\nconsort, Anne of Denmark. He married, for his first wife, a maiden of\nhis own rank, named Christian Marjoribanks, daughter of a respectable\nburgess. This was in 1586. He was afterwards named jeweller to the\nQueen, whose account to him for a space of ten years amounted to nearly\nL40,000. George Heriot, having lost his wife, connected himself with\nthe distinguished house of Rosebery, by marrying a daughter of James\nPrimrose, Clerk to the Privy Council. Of this lady he was deprived by\nher dying in child-birth in 1612, before attaining her twenty-first\nyear. After a life spent in honourable and successful industry, George\nHeriot died in London, to which city he had followed his royal master,\non the 12th February, 1624, at the age of sixty-one years. His picture,\n(copied by Scougal from a lost original,) in which he is represented in\nthe prime of life, is thus described: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis fair hair, which overshades\nthe thoughtful brow and calm calculating eye, with the cast of humour\non the lower part of the countenance, are all indicative of the genuine\nScottish character, and well distinguish a person fitted to move\nsteadily and wisely through the world, with a strength of resolution\nto ensure success, and a disposition to enjoy it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--_Historical and\nDescriptive Account of Heriot's Hospital, with a Memoir of the Founder,\nby Messrs James and John Johnstone._ Edinburgh, 1827.\n\nI may add, as every thing concerning George Heriot is interesting,\nthat his second wife, Alison Primrose, was interred in Saint Gregory's\nChurch, from the register of which parish the Rev. Mr. Barham, Rector,\nhas, in the kindest manner, sent me the following extract:--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMrs.\nAlison, the wife of Mr. George Heriot, gentleman, 20th April, 1612.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Saint Gregory's, before the Great Fire of London which consumed the\nCathedral, formed one of the towers of old Saint Paul's, and occupied\nthe space of ground now filled by Queen Anne's statue. In the south\naisle of the choir Mrs. Heriot reposed under a handsome monument,\nbearing the following inscription:--\n\n_\u00e2\u0080\u009cSanctissimae et charissimae conjugi ALISONAE HERIOT, Jacobi Primrosii,\nRegia Majestatis in Sanctiori Concilio Regni Scotia Amanuensis,\nfiliae, fernina omnibus turn animi turn corporis dotibus, ac pio cultu\ninstructissimae, maestissimus ipsius maritus GEORGIUS HERIOT, ARMIGER,\nRegis, Reginae, Principum Henrici et Caroli Gemmarius, bene merenti, non\nsine lachrymis, hoc Monumentum pie posuit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cObiit Mensis Aprilis die 16, anno salutis 1612, aetatis 20, in\nipso flore juventae, et mihi, parentibus, et amicis tristissimum sui\ndesiderium reliquit.\n\n Hic Alicia Primrosa\n Jacet crudo abruta fato,\n Intempestivas\n Ut rosa pressa manus.\n Nondum bisdenos\n Annorum impleverat orbes,\n Pulchra, pudica,\n Patris delicium atque viri:\n Quum gravida, heu!

The epitaph occurs in Strype's edition of\n_Stewe's Survey of London_, Book iii., page 228.\n\nNote III. p. 39.--PROCLAMATION AGAINST THE SCOTS COMING TO ENGLAND\n\nThe English agreed in nothing more unanimously than in censuring James\non account of the beggarly rabble which not only attended the King at\nhis coming first out of Scotland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Osborne, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich, through\nhis whole reign, like a fluent spring, were found still crossing the\nTweed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yet it is certain, from the number of proclamations published\nby the Privy Council in Scotland, and bearing marks of the King's\nown diction, that he was sensible of the whole inconveniences and\nunpopularity attending the importunate crowd of disrespectable suitors,\nand as desirous to get rid of them as his Southern subjects could be.\nBut it was in vain that his Majesty argued with his Scottish subjects on\nthe disrespect they were bringing on their native country and sovereign,\nby causing the English to suppose there were no well-nurtured or\nindependent gentry in Scotland, they who presented themselves being, in\nthe opinion and conceit of all beholders, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut idle rascals, and poor\nmiserable bodies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was even in vain that the vessels which brought\nup this unwelcome cargo of petitioners were threatened with fine and\nconfiscation; the undaunted suitors continued to press forward, and, as\none of the proclamations says, many of them under pretence of requiring\npayment of \u00e2\u0080\u009cauld debts due to them by the King,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which, it is observed\nwith great _naivete_, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis, of all kinds of importunity, most unpleasing\nto his Majesty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The expressions in the text are selected from these\ncurious proclamations.\n\nNOTE IV. p. 59.--KING JAMES\n\nThe dress of this monarch, together with his personal appearance, is\nthus described by a contemporary:--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was of a middle stature, more corpulent through [i.e. by means of]\nhis clothes than in his body, yet fat enough. His legs were very weak,\nhaving had, as was thought, some foul play in his youth, or rather\nbefore he was born, that he was not able to stand at seven years of age.\nThat weakness made him ever leaning on other men's shoulders. His walk\nwas even circular; his hands are in that walk ever fiddling about----[a\npart of dress now laid aside]. He would make a great deal too bold with\nGod in his passion, both with cursing and swearing, and a strain higher\nverging on blasphemy; but would, in his better temper, say, he hoped God\nwould not impute them as sins, and lay them to his charge, seeing they\nproceeded from passion. He had need of great assistance, rather than\nhope, that would daily make thus bold with God.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--DALZELL'S _Sketches of\nScottish History _, p. 86.\n\nNOTE V. p. 78.--SIR MUNGO MALAGROWTHER\n\nIt will perhaps be recognised by some of my countrymen, that the caustic\nScottish knight, as described in the preceding chapter, borrowed some of\nhis attributes from a most worthy and respectable baronet, who was to be\nmet with in Edinburgh society about twenty-five or thirty years ago. It\nis not by any means to be inferred, that the living person resembled the\nimaginary one in the course of life ascribed to him, or in his personal\nattributes. But his fortune was little adequate to his rank and the\nantiquity of his family; and, to avenge himself of this disparity, the\nworthy baronet lost no opportunity of making the more avowed sons of\nfortune feel the edge of his satire. This he had the art of disguising\nunder the personal infirmity of deafness, and usually introduced his\nmost severe things by an affected mistake of what was said around\nhim. For example, at a public meeting of a certain county, this worthy\ngentleman had chosen to display a laced coat, of such a pattern as had\nnot been seen in society for the better part of a century. The young men\nwho were present amused themselves with rallying him on his taste,\nwhen he suddenly singled out one of the party:--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAuld d'ye think my\ncoat--auld-fashioned?--indeed it canna be new; but it was the wark of a\nbraw tailor, and that was your grandfather, who was at the head of the\ntrade in Edinburgh about the beginning of last century.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Upon another\noccasion, when this type of Sir Mungo Malagrowther happened to hear a\nnobleman, the high chief of one of those Border clans who were accused\nof paying very little attention in ancient times to the distinctions\nof _Meum_ and _Tuum,_ addressing a gentleman of the same name, as\nif conjecturing there should be some relationship between them, he\nvolunteered to ascertain the nature of the connexion by saying, that\nthe \u00e2\u0080\u009cchief's ancestors had _stolen_ the cows, and the other gentleman's\nancestors had _killed_ them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--fame ascribing the origin of the latter\nfamily to a butcher. It may be well imagined, that among a people that\nhave been always punctilious about genealogy, such a person, who had a\ngeneral acquaintance with all the flaws and specks in the shields of the\nproud, the pretending, and the nouveaux riches, must have had the same\nscope for amusement as a monkey in a china shop.\n\nNote VI. p. 98.--MRS. ANNE TURNER\n\nMrs. Anne Turner was a dame somewhat of the occupation of Mrs.\nSuddlechop in the text; that is, half milliner half procuress, and\nsecret agent in all manner of proceedings. She was a trafficker in the\npoisoning of Sir Thomas Overbury, for which so many subordinate agents\nlost their lives, while, to the great scandal of justice, the Earl of\nSomerset and his Countess were suffered to escape, upon a threat of\nSomerset to make public some secret which nearly affected his master,\nKing James. Mrs. Turner introduced into England a French custom of using\nyellow starch in getting up bands and cuffs, and, by Lord Coke's orders,\nshe appeared in that fashion at the place of execution. She was the\nwidow of a physician, and had been eminently beautiful, as appears from\nthe description of her in the poem called Overbury's Vision. There was\nproduced in court a parcel of dolls or puppets belonging to this lady,\nsome naked, some dressed, and which she used for exhibiting fashions\nupon. But, greatly to the horror of the spectators, who accounted these\nfigures to be magical devices, there was, on their being shown, \u00e2\u0080\u009cheard a\ncrack from the scaffold, which caused great fear, tumult, and confusion,\namong the spectators and throughout the hall, every one fearing hurt, as\nif the devil had been present, and grown angry to have his workmanship\nshowed to such as were not his own scholars.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Compare this curious\npassage in the History of King James for the First Fourteen Years, 1651,\nwith the Aulicus Coquinarius of Dr. Heylin. Both works are published in\nthe Secret History of King James.\n\nNote VII. p. 110.--LORD HUNTINGLEN\n\nThe credit of having rescued James I. from the dagger of Alexander\nRuthven, is here fictitiously ascribed to an imaginary Lord Huntinglen.\nIn reality, as may be read in every history, his preserver was John\nRamsay, afterwards created Earl of Holderness, who stabbed the younger\nRuthven with his dagger while he was struggling with the King. Sir\nAnthony Weldon informs us, that, upon the annual return of the day, the\nKing's deliverance was commemorated by an anniversary feast. The time\nwas the fifth of August, \u00e2\u0080\u009cupon which,\u00e2\u0080\u009d proceeds the satirical historian,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir John Ramsay, for his good service in that preservation, was the\nprincipal guest, and so did the King grant him any boon he would ask\nthat day. But he had such limitation made to his asking, as made his\nsuit as unprofitable, as the action for which he asked it for was\nunserviceable to the King.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNote VIII. p. 115.--BUCKINGHAM\n\nBuckingham, who had a frankness in his high and irascible ambition,\nwas always ready to bid defiance to those by whom he was thwarted or\nopposed. He aspired to be created Prince of Tipperary in Ireland, and\nLord High Constable of England. Coventry, then Lord Keeper, opposed what\nseemed such an unreasonable extent of power as was annexed to the office\nof Constable. On this opposition, according to Sir Anthony Weldon,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Duke peremptorily accosted Coventry, 'Who made you Lord Keeper,\nCoventry?' He replied, 'The King.' Buckingham replied, 'It's false;\n'twas I did make you, and you shall know that I, who made you, can, and\nwill, unmake you.' Coventry thus answered him, 'Did I conceive that\nI held my place by your favour, I would presently unmake myself, by\nrendering up the seals to his Majesty.' Then Buckingham, in a scorn and\nfury, flung from him, saying, 'You shall not keep it long;' and surely,\nhad not Felton prevented him, he had made good his word.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--WELDON'S\n_Court of King James and Charles._\n\n Note IX. p. 134.--PAGES IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY\n\nAbout this time the ancient customs arising from the long prevalence of\nchivalry, began to be grossly varied from the original purposes of the\ninstitution. None was more remarkable than the change which took place\nin the breeding and occupation of pages. This peculiar species of menial\noriginally consisted of youths of noble birth, who, that they might be\ntrained to the exercise of arms, were early removed from their paternal\nhomes, where too much indulgence might have been expected, to be placed\nin the family of some prince or man of rank and military renown, where\nthey served, as it were, an apprenticeship to the duties of chivalry\nand courtesy. Their education was severely moral, and pursued with great\nstrictness in respect to useful exercises, and what were deemed elegant\naccomplishments. From being pages, they were advanced to the next\ngradation of squires; from squires, these candidates for the honours of\nknighthood were frequently made knights.\n\nBut in the sixteenth century the page had become, in many instances,\na mere domestic, who sometimes, by the splendour of his address and\nappearance, was expected to make up in show for the absence of a whole\nband of retainers with swords and bucklers. We have Sir John's authority\nwhen he cashiers part of his train.\n\n   \u00e2\u0080\u009cFalstaff will learn the humour of the age,\n    French thrift, you rogues, myself and skirted page.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJonson, in a high tone of moral indignation, thus reprobated the change.\nThe Host of the New Inn replies to Lord Lovel, who asks to have his son\nfor a page, that he would, with his own hands hang him, sooner\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThan damn him to this desperate course of life.\n     _LOVEL._ Call you that desperate, which, by a line\n   Of institution, from our ancestors\n   Hath been derived down to us, and received\n   In a succession, for the noblest way\n   Of brushing up our youth, in letters, arms,\n   Fair mien, discourses civil, exercise,\n   And all the blazon of a gentleman?\n   Where can he learn to vault, to ride, to fence,\n   To move his body gracefully, to speak\n   The language pure, or to turn his mind\n   Or manners more to the harmony of nature,\n   Than in these nurseries of nobility?\n     _HOST._ Ay, that was when the nursery's self was noble,\n   And only virtue made it, not the market,\n   That titles were not vended at the drum\n   And common outcry; goodness gave the greatness,\n   And greatness worship; every house became\n   An academy, and those parts\n   We see departed in the practice now\n   Quite from the institution.\n     _LOVEL._ Why do you say so,\n   Or think so enviously? do they not still\n   Learn us the Centaur's skill, the art of Thrace,\n   To ride? or Pollux' mystery, to fence?\n   The Pyrrhick gestures, both to stand and spring\n   In armour; to be active for the wars;\n   To study figures, numbers and proportions,\n   May yield them great in counsels and the art;\n   To make their English sweet upon their tongue?\n   As reverend Chaucer says.\n     _HOST._ Sir, you mistake;\n   To play Sir Pandarus, my copy hath it,\n   And carry messages to Madam Cressid;\n   Instead of backing the brave steed o'mornings.\n   To kiss the chambermaid, and for a leap\n   O' the vaulting horse, to ply the vaulting house;\n   For exercise of arms a bale of dice,\n   And two or three packs of cards to show the cheat\n   And nimbleness of hand; mistake a cloak\n   From my lord's back, and pawn it; ease his pockets\n   Of a superfluous watch, or geld a jewel\n   Of an odd stone or so; twinge three or four buttons\n   From off my lady's gown: These are the arts,\n   Or seven liberal deadly sciences,\n   Of pagery, or rather paganism,\n   As the tides run; to which, if he apply him,\n   He may, perhaps, take a degree at Tyburn,\n   A year the earlier come to read a lecture\n   Upon Aquinas, at Saint Thomas-a-Watering's\n   And so go forth a laureate in hemp-circle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n                             The New Inn, Act I.\n\nNote X. p. 135.--LORD HENRY HOWARD\n\nLord Henry Howard was the second son of the poetical Earl of Surrey, and\npossessed considerable parts and learning. He wrote, in the year 1583, a\nbook called, _A Defensative against the Poison of supposed Prophecies._\nHe gained the favour of Queen Elizabeth, by having, he says, directed\nhis battery against a sect of prophets and pretended soothsayers, whom\nhe accounted _infesti regibus,_ as he expresses it. In the last years\nof the Queen, he became James's most ardent partisan, and conducted\nwith great pedantry, but much intrigue, the correspondence betwixt the\nScottish King and the younger Cecil. Upon James's accession, he was\ncreated Earl of Northampton, and Lord Privy Seal. According to De\nBeaumont the French Ambassador, Lord Henry Howard, was one of the\ngreatest flatterers and calumniators that ever lived.\n\nNote XI. p. 136.--SKIRMISHES IN THE PUBLIC STREETS\n\nEdinburgh appears to have been one of the most disorderly towns in\nEurope, during the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth century.\nThe Diary of the honest citizen Birrel, repeatedly records such\nincidents as the following: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe 24 of November (1567), at two\nafternoon, the Laird of Airth and the Laird of Weems met on the High\nGate of Edinburgh, and they and their followers fought a very bloody\nskirmish, where there were many hurt on both sides with shot of pistol.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n These skirmishes also took place in London itself. In Shadwell's play of\n_The Scowrers,_ an old rake thus boasts of his early exploits:--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew\nthe Hectors, and before them the Muns, and the Tityretu's; they were\nbrave fellows indeed! In these days, a man could not go from the Rose\nGarden to the Piazza once, but he must venture his life twice, my dear\nSir Willie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But it appears that the affrays, which, in the Scottish\ncapital, arose out of hereditary quarrels and ancient feuds, were\nin London the growth of the licentiousness and arrogance of young\ndebauchees.\n\nNote XII. p. 144.--FRENCH COOKERY\n\nThe exertion of French ingenuity mentioned in the text is noticed\nby some authorities of the period; the siege of Leith was also\ndistinguished by the protracted obstinacy of the besieged, in which was\ndisplayed all that the age possessed of defensive war, so that Brantome\nrecords that those who witnessed this siege, had, from that very\ncircumstance, a degree of consequence yielded to their persons and\nopinions. He tells a story of Strozzi himself, from which it appears\nthat his jests lay a good deal in the line of the cuisine. He caused a\nmule to be stolen from one Brusquet, on whom he wished to play a trick,\nand served up the flesh of that unclean animal so well disguised, that\nit passed with Brusquet for venison.\n\nNote XIII. p. 145.--CUCKOO'S NEST\n\nThe quarrel in this chapter between the pretended captain and the\ncitizen of London, is taken from a burlesque poem called The Counter\nScuffle, that is, the Scuffle in the Prison at Wood street, so called.\nIt is a piece of low humour, which had at the time very considerable\nvogue. The prisoners, it seems, had fallen into a dispute amongst\nthemselves \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich calling was of most repute,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and a lawyer put in his\nclaim to be most highly considered. The man of war repelled his pretence\nwith much arrogance.\n\n   \u00e2\u0080\u009c'Wer't not for us, thou swad,' quoth he,\n    'Where wouldst thou fay to get a fee?\n    But to defend such things as thee\n            'Tis pity;\n    For such as you esteem us least,\n    Who ever have been ready prest\n    To guard you and your cuckoo's nest,\n            The City'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe offence is no sooner given than it is caught up by a gallant\ncitizen, a goldsmith, named Ellis.\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009c'Of London city I am free,\n    And there I first my wife did see,\n    And for that very cause,' said he,\n            'I love it.\n\n    And he that calls it cuckoo's nest,\n    Except he say he speaks in jest,\n    He is a villain and a beast,--\n            'I'll prove it!\n\n    For though I am a man of trade,\n    And free of London city made,\n    Yet can I use gun, bill, and blade,\n            In battle.\n\n    And citizens, if need require,\n    Themselves can force the foe retire,\n    Whatever this low country squire\n             May prattle.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe dispute terminates in the scuffle, which is the subject of the poem.\nThe whole may be found in the second edition of Dryden's _Miscellany,_\n12mo, vol. iii. 1716.\n\nNote XIV. p. 150.--BURBAGE\n\nBurbage, whom Camden terms another Roscius, was probably the original\nrepresentative of Richard III., and seems to have been early almost\nidentified with his prototype. Bishop Corbet, in his Iter Boreale, tells\nus that mine host of Market Bosworth was full of ale and history.\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHear him, See you yon wood? there Richard lay\n   With his whole army; look the other way,\n   And lo, where Richmond, in a field of gorse,\n   Encamp'd himself in might and all his force.\n   Upon this hill they met. Why, he could tell\n   The inch where Richmond stood, where Richard fell;\n   Besides, what of his knowledge he could say,\n   He had authentic notice from the play,\n   Which I might guess by's mustering up the ghosts\n   And policies not incident to hosts;\n   But chiefly by that one perspicuous thing,\n   Where he mistook a player for a king,\n   For when he would have said, that Richard died,\n   And call'd, a horse! a horse! he Burbage cried.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n            RICHARD CORBET'S _Poems, Edition 1815,_ p. 193.\n\nNote XV. p. 323.--MHIC-ALLASTAR-MORE\n\nThis is the Highland patronymic of the late gallant Chief of Glengarry.\nThe allusion in the text is to an unnecessary alarm taken by some lady,\nat the ceremonial of the coronation of George IV., at the sight of\nthe pistols which the Chief wore as a part of his Highland dress. The\ncircumstance produced some confusion, which was talked of at the time.\nAll who knew Glengarry (and the author knew him well) were aware that\nhis principles were of devoted loyalty to the person of his sovereign.\n\nNote XVI. p. 323.--KING JAMES'S HUNTING BOTTLE\n\nRoger Coke, in his Detection of the Court and State of England, London,\n1697, p.70, observes of James I., \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe king was excessively addicted to\nhunting, and drinking, not ordinary French and Spanish wines, but strong\nGreek wines, and thought he would compound his hunting with these wines;\nand to that purpose, he was attended by a special officer, who was, as\nmuch as he could be, always at hand to fill the King's cup in hunting\nwhen he called for it. I have heard my father say, that, hunting with\nthe King, after the King had drank of the wine, he also drank of it; and\nthough he was young, and of a healthful disposition, it so deranged\nhis head that it spoiled his pleasure and disordered him for three days\nafter. Whether it was from drinking these wines, or from some other\ncause, the King became so lazy and so unwieldy, that he was trussed on\nhorseback, and as he was set, so would he ride, without stirring himself\nin the saddle; nay, when his hat was set upon his head he would not take\nthe trouble to alter it, but it sate as it was put on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe trussing, for which the demipique saddle of the day afforded\nparticular facility, is alluded to in the text; and the author, among\nother nickcnacks of antiquity, possesses a leathern flask, like those\ncarried by sportsmen, which is labelled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cKing James's Hunting Bottle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n with what authenticity is uncertain. Coke seems to have exaggerated the\nKing's taste for the bottle. Welldon says James was not intemperate in\nhis drinking; \u00e2\u0080\u009cHowever, in his old age, Buckingham's jovial suppers,\nwhen he had any turn to do with him, made him sometimes overtaken, which\nhe would the next day remember, and repent with tears. It is true he\ndrank very often, which was rather out of a custom than any delight; and\nhis drinks were of that kind for strength, as Frontiniack, Canary, high\ncountry wine, tent wine, and Scottish ale, that had he not had a very\nstrong brain, he might have been daily overtaken, though he seldom\ndrank at any one time above four spoonfuls, many times not above one or\ntwo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--_Secret History of King James,_ vol. ii., p. 3. Edin. 1811.\n\nNote XVII. p. 325.--SCENE IN GREENWICH PARK\n\nI cannot here omit mentioning, that a painting of the old school is in\nexistence, having a remarkable resemblance to the scene described in the\nforegoing chapter, although it be nevertheless true that the similarity\nis in all respects casual, and that the author knew not of the existence\nof the painting till it was sold, amongst others, with the following\ndescription attached to it in a well-drawn-up catalogue:\n\n                             \u00e2\u0080\u009cFREDERIGO ZUCCHERO\n    _\u00e2\u0080\u009cScene as represented in the Fortunes of Nigel, by Frederigo\nZucchero, the King's painter._\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis extraordinary picture, which, independent of its pictorial merit,\nhas been esteemed a great literary curiosity, represents most faithfully\nthe meeting, in Greenwich Park, between King James and Nigel Oliphaunt,\nas described in the Fortunes of Nigel, showing that the author must\nhave taken the anecdote from authenticated facts. In the centre of the\npicture sits King James on horseback, very erect and stiffly. Between\nthe King and Prince Charles, who is on the left of the picture, the Duke\nof Buckingham is represented riding a black horse, and pointing eagerly\ntowards the culprit, Nigel Olifaunt, who is standing on the right side\nof the picture. He grasps with his right hand a gun, or crossbow, and\nlooks angrily towards the King, who seems somewhat confused and alarmed.\nBehind Nigel, his servant is restraining two dogs which are barking\nfiercely. Nigel and his servant are both clothed in red, the livery of\nthe Oliphaunt family in which, to this day, the town-officers of Perth\nare clothed, there being an old charter, granting to the Oliphaunt\nfamily, the privilege of dressing the public officers of Perth in their\nlivery. The Duke of Buckingham is in all respects equal in magnificence\nof dress to the King or the Prince. The only difference that is marked\nbetween him and royalty is, that his head is uncovered. The King and the\nPrince wear their hats. In Letitia Aikin's Memoirs of the Reign of\nKing James, will be found a letter from Sir Thomas Howard to Lord\nL. Harrington, in which he recommends the latter to come to court,\nmentioning that his Majesty has spoken favourably of him. He then\nproceeds to give him some advice, by which he is likely to find favour\nin the King's eyes. He tells him to wear a bushy ruff, well starched;\nand after various other directions as to his dress, he concludes, 'but\nabove all things fail not to praise the roan jennet whereon the King\ndoth daily ride.' In this picture King James is represented on the\nidentical roan jennet. In the background of the picture are seen two\nor three suspicious-looking figures, as if watching the success of some\nplot. These may have been put in by the painter, to flatter the King,\nby making it be supposed that he had actually escaped, or successfully\ncombated, some serious plot. The King is attended by a numerous band of\ncourtiers and attendants, all of whom seem moving forward to arrest\nthe defaulter. The painting of this picture is extremely good, but\nthe drawing is very Gothic, and there is no attempt at the keeping of\nperspective. The picture is very dark and obscure, which considerably\nadds to the interest of the scene.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNote XVIII. p. 325.--KING JAMES'S TIMIDITY\n\nThe fears of James for his personal safety were often excited without\nserious grounds. On one occasion, having been induced to visit a\ncoal-pit on the coast of Fife, he was conducted a little way under the\nsea, and brought to daylight again on a small island, or what was such\nat full tide, down which a shaft had been sunk. James, who conceived his\nlife or liberty aimed at, when he found himself on an islet surrounded\nby the sea, instead of admiring, as his cicerone hoped, the unexpected\nchange of scene, cried TREASON with all his might, and could not be\npacified till he was rowed ashore. At Lockmaben he took an equally\ncauseless alarm from a still slighter circumstance. Some vendisses,\na fish peculiar to the Loch, were presented to the royal table as a\ndelicacy; but the King, who was not familiar with their appearance,\nconcluded they were poisoned, and broke up the banquet \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith most\nadmired disorder.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNote XIX. p. 328.--TRAITOR'S GATE\n\nTraitor's Gate, which opens from the Tower of London to the Thames, was,\nas its name implies, that by which persons accused of state offences\nwere conveyed to their prison. When the tide is making, and the ancient\ngate is beheld from within the buildings, it used to be a most striking\npart of the old fortress; but it is now much injured in appearance,\nbeing half built up with masonry to support a steam-engine, or something\nof that sort.\n\nNote XX. p. 361.--PUNISHMENT OF STUBBS BY MUTILATION\n\nThis execution, which so captivated the imagination of Sir Mungo\nMalagrowther, was really a striking one. The criminal, a furious and\nbigoted Puritan, had published a book in very violent terms against the\nmatch of Elizabeth with the Duke of Alencon, which he termed an union of\na daughter of God with a son of antichrist. Queen Elizabeth was greatly\nincensed at the freedom assumed in this work, and caused the author\nStubbs, with Page the publisher, and one Singleton the printer, to\nbe tried on an act passed by Philip and Mary against the writers and\ndispersers of seditious publications. They were convicted, and although\nthere was an opinion strongly entertained by the lawyers, that the\nact was only temporary, and expired with Queen Mary, Stubbs and Page\nreceived sentence to have their right hands struck off. They accordingly\nsuffered the punishment, the wrist being divided by a cleaver driven\nthrough the joint by force of a mallet. The printer was pardoned. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nremember,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the historian Camden, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbeing then present, that Stubbs,\nwhen his right hand was cut off, plucked off his hat with the left, and\nsaid, with a loud voice, 'God save the Queen!' The multitude standing\nabout was deeply silent, either out of horror of this new and unwonted\nkind of punishment, or out of commiseration towards the man, as being of\nan honest and unblamable repute, or else out of hatred to the marriage,\nwhich most men presaged would be the overthrow of religion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--CAMDBN'S\n_Annals for the Year_ 1581.\n\nNote XXI. p. 375.--RlCHIE MONIPLIES BEHIND THE ARRAS\n\nThe practical jest of Richie Moniplies going behind the arras to get an\nopportunity of teasing Heriot, was a pleasantry such as James might be\nsupposed to approve of. It was customary for those who knew his humour\nto contrive jests of this kind for his amusement. The celebrated Archie\nArmstrong, and another jester called Drummond, mounted on other people's\nbacks, used to charge each other like knights in the tilt-yard, to the\nmonarch's great amusement. The following is an instance of the same\nkind, taken from Webster upon Witchcraft. The author is speaking of the\nfaculty called ventriloquism.\n\nBut to make this more plain and certain, we shall add a story of a\nnotable impostor, or ventriloquist, from the testimony of Mr. Ady, which\nwe have had confirmed from the mouth of some courtiers, that both saw\nand knew him, and is this:--It hath been (saith he) credibly reported,\nthat there was a man in the court of King James his days, that could act\nthis imposture so lively, that he could call the King by name, and cause\nthe King to look round about him, wondering who it was that called him,\nwhereas he that called him stood before him in his presence, with his\nface towards him. But after this imposture was known, the King, in his\nmerriment, would sometimes take occasionally this impostor to make sport\nupon some of his courtiers, as, for instance:--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was a knight belonging to the court, whom the King caused to come\nbefore him in his private room, (where no man was but the King, and this\nknight and the impostor,) and feigned some occasion of serious discourse\nwith the knight; but when the King began to speak and the knight bending\nhis attention to the King, suddenly there came a voice as out of another\nroom, calling the knight by name, 'Sir John, Sir John; come away,\nSir John;' at which the knight began to frown that any man should be\nunmannerly as to molest the King and him; and still listening to the\nKing's discourse, the voice came again, 'Sir John, Sir John; come away\nand drink off your sack.' At that Sir John began to swell with anger,\nand looked into the next room to see who it was that dared to call him\nso importunately, and could not find out who it was, and having chid\nwith whomsoever he found, he returned again to the King. The King had no\nsooner begun to speak as formerly, but the voice came again, 'Sir John,\ncome away, your sack stayeth for you.' At that Sir John began to stamp\nwith madness, and looked out and returned several times to the King, but\ncould not be quiet in his discourse with the King, because of the voice\nthat so often troubled him, till the king had sported enough.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--WEBSTER\n_on Witchcraft_, p. 124.\n\nNote XXII. p. 393.--LADY LAKE.\n\nWhether out of a meddling propensity common to all who have a gossiping\ndisposition, or from the love of justice, which ought to make part of a\nprince's character, James was very fond of enquiring personally into the\ncauses _celebres_ which occurred during his reign. In the imposture of\nthe Boy of Bilson, who pretended to be possessed, and of one Richard\nHaydock, a poor scholar, who pretended to preach during his sleep, the\nKing, to use the historian Wilson's expression, took delight in\nsounding with the line of his understanding, the depths of these brutish\nimpositions, and in doing so, showed the acuteness with which he was\nendowed by Nature. Lady Lake's story consisted in a clamorous complaint\nagainst the Countess of Exeter, whom she accused of a purpose to put to\ndeath Lady Lake herself, and her daughter, Lady Ross, the wife of the\nCountess's own son-in-law, Lord Ross; and a forged letter was produced,\nin which Lady Exeter was made to acknowledge such a purpose. The account\ngiven of the occasion of obtaining this letter, was, that it had been\nwritten by the Countess at Wimbledon, in presence of Lady Lake and her\ndaughter, Lady Ross, being designed to procure their forgiveness for her\nmischievous intention. The King remained still unsatisfied, the writing,\nin his opinion, bearing some marks of forgery. Lady Lake and her\ndaughter then alleged, that, besides their own attestation, and that of\na confidential domestic, named Diego, in whose presence Lady Exeter had\nwritten the confession, their story might also be supported by the oath\nof their waiting-maid, who had been placed behind the hangings at the\ntime the letter was written, and heard the Countess of Exeter read over\nthe confession after she had signed it. Determined to be at the bottom\nof this accusation, James, while hunting one day near Wimbledon, the\nscene of the alleged confession, suddenly left his sport, and,\ngalloping hastily to Wimbledon, in order to examine personally the\nroom, discovered, from the size of the apartment, that the alleged\nconversation could not have taken place in the manner sworn to; and that\nthe tapestry of the chamber, which had remained in the same state for\nthirty years, was too short by two feet, and, therefore, could not have\nconcealed any one behind it. This matter was accounted an exclusive\ndiscovery of the King by his own spirit of shrewd investigation. The\nparties were punished in the Star Chamber by fine and imprisonment.\n\n\n\n   _A,' all.                         BELDAM, ugly old woman.\n   ABYE, suffer for.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n","id":955,"split":"train"}
