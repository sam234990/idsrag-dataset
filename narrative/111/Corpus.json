In the mines he befriends many of the workers, and realizes their misery and exploitation at the hands of the bosses.\nHe befriends Mary Burke, who is a passionate fighter for the workers' rights. Her father is a mine worker who spends his days drinking and leaving her to take care of her siblings. She and Hal grow close, which tears at Hal's loyalty to his fianc\u0102\u0160e back home.\nAfter dedicating himself to the workers' cause, he tells them that he will appeal to the bosses to become a check weigh man who measures the amount of coal, but the GFC, wanting to cheat the workers out of their pay, appoints a company check weigh man. Hal is eventually put into the jail by the marshal, who is teased by Hal over conditions of the mines and accused by Hal of being corrupted and unfair to the workers.\nAfter an explosion in the mines, Hal seeks out Percy Harrigan, an old friend whose father, Peter Harrigan, owns the General Fuel Company. The workers organize a strike and union to demand their rights from the bosses, but the rescue effort goes longer than expected. The bosses are more intent on the tools and equipment than the miners. \"Damn the man! save the Mules!\" says a boss.\nHal appeals to the United Mine Workers to back the strike, but they refuse, telling him that the strike is primitive and unexpected and that to support it when its just started to participate in action would waste the union's resources. Hal is told to wait a few more years for the other unions to strike, and only with a massive course of action could the unions win. Hal is left to tell the workers the grievous news but the workers nevertheless cheer out his name (some calling out Joe Smith and others Hal) for standing up for them.\nAfter a confrontation with his brother Edward, Hal resolves to return home and dedicate his life to the workers' cause. Hal leaves and concludes that he is in love with Mary Burke.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of King Coal, by Upton Sinclair\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

A great and\nnon-temporizing enthusiast, he never flinched from making sacrifices.\nNow and then he attained great material successes as a writer, but\ninvariably he invested and lost his earnings in enterprises by which he\nhad hoped to ward off injustice and to further human happiness. Though\ndisappointed time after time, he never lost faith nor courage to start\nagain.\n\nAs a convinced socialist and eager advocate of unpopular doctrines, as\nan exposer of social conditions that would otherwise be screened away\nfrom the public eye, the most influential journals of his country were\nas a rule arraigned against him. Though always a poor man, though never\nwilling to grant to publishers the concessions essential for many\neditions and general popularity, he was maliciously represented to be a\ncarpet knight of radicalism and a socialist millionaire. He has several\ntimes been obliged to change his publisher, which goes to prove that he\nis no seeker of material gain.\n\nUpton Sinclair is one of the writers of the present time most deserving\nof a sympathetic interest. He shows his patriotism as an American, not\nby joining in hymns to the very conditional kind of liberty peculiar to\nthe United States, but by agitating for infusing it with the elixir of\nreal liberty, the liberty of humanity. He does not limit himself to a\ndispassionate and entertaining description of things as they are. But in\nhis appeals to the honour and good-fellowship of his compatriots, he\nopens their eyes to the appalling conditions under which wage-earning\nslaves are living by the hundreds of thousands. His object is to better\nthese unnatural conditions, to obtain for the very poorest a glimpse of\nlight and happiness, to make even them realise the sensation of cosy\nwell-being and the comfort of knowing that justice is to be found also\nfor them.\n\nThis time Upton Sinclair has absorbed himself in the study of the\nminer's life in the lonesome pits of the Rocky Mountains, and his\nsensitive and enthusiastic mind has brought to the world an American\nparallel to GERMINAL, Emile Zola's technical masterpiece.\n\nThe conditions described in the two books are, however, essentially\ndifferent. While Zola's working-men are all natives of France, one meets\nin Sinclair's book a motley variety of European emigrants, speaking a\nBabel of languages and therefore debarred from forming some sort of\nassociation to protect themselves against being exploited by the\nanonymous limited Company. Notwithstanding this natural bar against\nunited action on the part of the wage-earning slaves, the Company feels\nfar from at ease and jealously guards its interests against any attempt\nof organising the men.\n\nA young American of the upper class, with great sympathy for the\ndowntrodden and an honest desire to get a first-hand knowledge of their\nconditions in order to help them, decides to take employment in a mine\nunder a fictitious name and dressed like a working-man. His unusual way\nof trying to obtain work arouses suspicion. He is believed to be a\nprofessional strike-leader sent out to organise the miners against their\nexploiters, and he is not only refused work, but thrashed mercilessly.\nWhen finally he succeeds in getting inside, he discovers with growing\nindignation the shameless and inhuman way in which those who unearth the\nblack coal are being exploited.\n\nThese are the fundamental ideas of the book, but they give but a faint\nnotion of the author's poetic attitude. Most beautifully is this shown\nin Hal's relation to a young Irish girl, Red Mary. She is poor, and her\ndaily life harsh and joyless, but nevertheless her wonderful grace is\none of the outstanding features of the book. The first impression of\nMary is that of a Celtic Madonna with a tender heart for little\nchildren. She develops into a Valk\u00c3\u00bcre of the working-class, always ready\nto fight for the worker's right.\n\nThe last chapters of the book give a description of the miners' revolt\nagainst the Company. They insist upon their right to choose a deputy to\ncontrol the weighing-in of the coal, and upon having the mines sprinkled\nregularly to prevent explosion. They will also be free to buy their food\nand utensils wherever they like, even in shops not belonging to the\nCompany.\n\nIn a postscript Sinclair explains the fundamental facts on which his\nwork of art has been built up. Even without the postscript one could not\nhelp feeling convinced that the social conditions he describes are true\nto life. The main point is that Sinclair has not allowed himself to\nbecome inspired by hackneyed phrases that bondage and injustice and the\nother evils and crimes of Kingdoms have been banished from Republics,\nbut that he is earnestly pointing to the honeycombed ground on which the\ngreatest modern money-power has been built. The fundament of this power\nis not granite, but mines. It lives and breathes in the light, because\nit has thousands of unfortunates toiling in the darkness. It lives and\nhas its being in proud liberty because thousands are slaving for it,\nwhose thraldom is the price of this liberty.\n\nThis is the impression given to the reader of this exciting novel.\n\nGEORG BRANDES.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK ONE\n\nTHE DOMAIN OF KING COAL\n\n\n\nSECTION 1.\n\nThe town of Pedro stood on the edge of the mountain country; a\nstraggling assemblage of stores and saloons from which a number of\nbranch railroads ran up into the canyons, feeding the coal-camps.\nThrough the week it slept peacefully; but on Saturday nights, when the\nminers came trooping down, and the ranchmen came in on horseback and in\nautomobiles, it wakened to a seething life.\n\nAt the railroad station, one day late in June, a young man alighted from\na train. He was about twenty-one years of age, with sensitive features,\nand brown hair having a tendency to waviness. He wore a frayed and faded\nsuit of clothes, purchased in a quarter of his home city where the\nHebrew merchants stand on the sidewalks to offer their wares; also a\nsoiled blue shirt without a tie, and a pair of heavy boots which had\nseen much service. Strapped on his back was a change of clothing and a\nblanket, and in his pockets a comb, a toothbrush, and a small pocket\nmirror.\n\nSitting in the smoking-car of the train, the young man had listened to\nthe talk of the coal-camps, seeking to correct his accent. When he got\noff the train he proceeded down the track and washed his hands with\ncinders, and lightly powdered some over his face. After studying the\neffect of this in his mirror, he strolled down the main street of Pedro,\nand, selecting a little tobacco-shop, went in. In as surly a voice as he\ncould muster, he inquired of the proprietress, \"Can you tell me how to\nget to the Pine Creek mine?\"\n\nThe woman looked at him with no suspicion in her glance. She gave the\ndesired information, and he took a trolley and got off at the foot of\nthe Pine Creek canyon, up which he had a thirteen-mile trudge. It was\na sunshiny day, with the sky crystal clear, and the mountain air\ninvigourating. The young man seemed to be happy, and as he strode on\nhis way, he sang a song with many verses:\n\n  \"Old King Coal was a merry old soul,\n    And a merry old soul was he;\n  He made him a college all full of knowledge--\n    Hurrah for you and me!\n\n  \"Oh, Liza-Ann, come out with me,\n    The moon is a-shinin' in the monkey-puzzle tree;\n  Oh, Liza-Ann, I have began\n    To sing you the song of Harrigan!\n\n  \"He keeps them a-roll, this merry old soul--\n    The wheels of industree;\n  A-roll and a-roll, for his pipe and his bowl\n    And his college facultee!\n\n  \"Oh, Mary-Jane, come out in the lane,\n    The moon is a-shinin' in the old pecan;\n  Oh, Mary-Jane, don't you hear me a-sayin'\n    I'll sing you the song of Harrigan!\n\n  \"So hurrah for King Coal, and his fat pay-roll,\n    And his wheels of industree!\n  Hurrah for his pipe, and hurrah for his bowl--\n    And hurrah for you and me!\n\n  \"Oh, Liza-Ann, come out with me,\n    The moon is a-shinin'--\"\n\nAnd so on and on--as long as the moon was a-shinin' on a college campus.\nIt was a mixture of happy nonsense and that questioning with which\nmodern youth has begun to trouble its elders. As a marching tune, the\nsong was a trifle swift for the grades of a mountain canyon; Warner\ncould stop and shout to the canyon-walls, and listen to their answer,\nand then march on again. He had youth in his heart, and love and\ncuriosity; also he had some change in his trousers' pocket, and a ten\ndollar bill, for extreme emergencies, sewed up in his belt. If a\nphotographer for Peter Harrigan's General Fuel Company could have got a\nsnap-shot of him that morning, it might have served as a \"portrait of a\ncoal-miner\" in any \"prosperity\" publication.\n\nBut the climb was a stiff one, and before the end the traveller became\naware of the weight of his boots, and sang no more. Just as the sun was\nsinking up the canyon, he came upon his destination--a gate across the\nroad, with a sign upon it:\n\nPINE CREEK COAL CO.\n\nPRIVATE PROPERTY\n\nTRESPASSING FORBIDDEN\n\nHal approached the gate, which was of iron bars, and padlocked. After\nstanding for a moment to get ready his surly voice, he kicked upon the\ngate and a man came out of a shack inside.\n\n\"What do you want?\" said he.\n\n\"I want to get in. I'm looking for a job.\"\n\n\"Where do you come from?\"\n\n\"From Pedro.\"\n\n\"Where you been working?\"\n\n\"I never worked in a mine before.\"\n\n\"Where did you work?\"\n\n\"In a grocery-store.\"\n\n\"What grocery-store?\"\n\n\"Peterson & Co., in Western City.\"\n\nThe guard came closer to the gate and studied him through the bars.\n\n\"Hey, Bill!\" he called, and another man came out from the cabin. \"Here's\na guy says he worked in a grocery, and he's lookin' for a job.\"\n\n\"Where's your papers?\" demanded Bill.\n\nEvery one had told Hal that labour was scarce in the mines, and that the\ncompanies were ravenous for men; he had supposed that a workingman would\nonly have to knock, and it would be opened unto him. \"They didn't give\nme no papers,\" he said, and added, hastily, \"I got drunk and they fired\nme.\" He felt quite sure that getting drunk would not bar one from a coal\ncamp.\n\nBut the two made no move to open the gate. The second man studied him\ndeliberately from top to toe, and Hal was uneasily aware of possible\nsources of suspicion. \"I'm all right,\" he declared. \"Let me in, and I'll\nshow you.\"\n\nStill the two made no move. They looked at each other, and then Bill\nanswered, \"We don't need no hands.\"\n\n\"But,\" exclaimed Hal, \"I saw a sign down the canyon--\"\n\n\"That's an old sign,\" said Bill.\n\n\"But I walked all the way up here!\"\n\n\"You'll find it easier walkin' back.\"\n\n\"But--it's night!\"\n\n\"Scared of the dark, kid?\" inquired Bill, facetiously.\n\n\"Oh, say!\" replied Hal. \"Give a fellow a chance! Ain't there some way I\ncan pay for my keep--or at least for a bunk to-night?\"\n\n\"There's nothin' for you,\" said Bill, and turned and went into the\ncabin.\n\nThe other man waited and watched, with a decidedly hostile look. Hal\nstrove to plead with him, but thrice he repeated, \"Down the canyon with\nyou.\" So at last Hal gave up, and moved down the road a piece and sat\ndown to reflect.\n\nIt really seemed an absurdly illogical proceeding, to post a notice,\n\"Hands Wanted,\" in conspicuous places on the roadside, causing a man to\nclimb thirteen miles up a mountain canyon, only to be turned off without\nexplanation. Hal was convinced that there must be jobs inside the\nstockade, and that if only he could get at the bosses he could persuade\nthem. He got up and walked down the road a quarter of a mile, to where\nthe railroad-track crossed it, winding up the canyon. A train of\n\"empties\" was passing, bound into the camp, the cars rattling and\nbumping as the engine toiled up the grade. This suggested a solution of\nthe difficulty.\n\nIt was already growing dark. Crouching slightly, Hal approached the\ncars, and when he was in the shadows, made a leap and swung onto one of\nthem. It took but a second to clamber in, and he lay flat and waited,\nhis heart thumping.\n\nBefore a minute had passed he heard a shout, and looking over, he saw\nthe Cerberus of the gate running down a path to the track, his\ncompanion, Bill, just behind him. \"Hey! come out of there!\" they yelled;\nand Bill leaped, and caught the car in which Hal was riding.\n\nThe latter saw that the game was up, and sprang to the ground on the\nother side of the track and started out of the camp. Bill followed him,\nand as the train passed, the other man ran down the track to join him.\nHal was walking rapidly, without a word; but the Cerberus of the gate\nhad many words, most of them unprintable, and he seized Hal by the\ncollar, and shoving him violently, planted a kick upon that portion of\nhis anatomy which nature has constructed for the reception of kicks. Hal\nrecovered his balance, and, as the man was still pursuing him, he turned\nand aimed a blow, striking him on the chest and making him reel.\n\nHal's big brother had seen to it that he knew how to use his fists; he\nnow squared off, prepared to receive the second of his assailants. But\nin coal-camps matters are not settled in that primitive way, it\nappeared. The man halted, and the muzzle of a revolver came suddenly\nunder Hal's nose. \"Stick 'em up!\" said the man.\n\nThis was a slang which Hal had never heard, but the meaning was\ninescapable; he \"stuck 'em up.\" At the same moment his first assailant\nrushed at him, and dealt him a blow over the eye which sent him\nsprawling backward upon the stones.\n\n\n\nSECTION 2.\n\nWhen Hal came to himself again he was in darkness, and was conscious of\nagony from head to toe. He was lying on a stone floor, and he rolled\nover, but soon rolled back again, because there was no part of his back\nwhich was not sore. Later on, when he was able to study himself, he\ncounted over a score of marks of the heavy boots of his assailants.\n\nHe lay for an hour or two, making up his mind that he was in a lock-up,\nbecause he could see the starlight through iron bars. He could hear\nsomebody snoring, and he called half a dozen times, in a louder and\nlouder voice, until at last, hearing a growl, he inquired, \"Can you give\nme a drink of water?\"\n\n\"I'll give you hell if you wake me up again,\" said the voice; after\nwhich Hal lay in silence until morning.\n\nA couple of hours after daylight, a man entered his cell. \"Get up,\" said\nhe, and added a prod with his foot. Hal had thought he could not do it,\nbut he got up.\n\n\"No funny business now,\" said his jailer, and grasping him by the sleeve\nof his coat, marched him out of the cell and down a little corridor into\na sort of office, where sat a red-faced personage with a silver shield\nupon the lapel of his coat. Hal's two assailants of the night before\nstood nearby.\n\n\"Well, kid?\" said the personage in the chair. \"Had a little time to\nthink it over?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Hal, briefly.\n\n\"What's the charge?\" inquired the personage, of the two watchmen.\n\n\"Trespassing and resisting arrest.\"\n\n\"How much money you got, young fellow?\" was, the next question.\n\nHal hesitated.\n\n\"Speak up there!\" said the man.\n\n\"Two dollars and sixty-seven cents,\" said Hal--\"as well as I can\nremember.\"\n\n\"Go on!\" said the other. \"What you givin' us?\" And then, to the two\nwatchmen, \"Search him.\"\n\n\"Take off your coat and pants,\" said Bill, promptly, \"and your boots.\"\n\n\"Oh, I say!\" protested Hal.\n\n\"Take 'em off!\" said the man, and clenched his fists. Hal took 'em off,\nand they proceeded to go through the pockets, producing a purse with the\namount stated, also a cheap watch, a strong pocket knife, the\ntooth-brush, comb and mirror, and two white handkerchiefs, which they\nlooked at contemptuously and tossed to the spittle-drenched floor.\n\nThey unrolled the pack, and threw the clean clothing about. Then,\nopening the pocket-knife, they proceeded to pry about the soles and\nheels of the boots, and to cut open the lining of the clothing. So they\nfound the ten dollars in the belt, which they tossed onto the table with\nthe other belongings. Then the personage with the shield announced, \"I\nfine you twelve dollars and sixty-seven cents, and your watch and\nknife.\" He added, with a grin, \"You can keep your snot-rags.\"\n\n\"Now see here!\" said Hal, angrily. \"This is pretty raw!\"\n\n\"You get your duds on, young fellow, and get out of here as quick as you\ncan, or you'll go in your shirt-tail.\"\n\nBut Hal was angry enough to have been willing to go in his skin. \"You\ntell me who you are, and your authority for this procedure?\"\n\n\"I'm marshal of the camp,\" said the man.\n\n\"You mean you're an employ\u00c3\u00a9 of the General Fuel Company? And you propose\nto rob me--\"\n\n\"Put him out, Bill,\" said the marshal. And Hal saw Bill's fists clench.\n\n\"All right,\" he said, swallowing his indignation. \"Wait till I get my\nclothes on.\" And he proceeded to dress as quickly as possible; he rolled\nup his blanket and spare clothing, and started for the door.\n\n\"Remember,\" said the marshal, \"straight down the canyon with you, and if\nyou show your face round here again, you'll get a bullet through you.\"\n\nSo Hal went out into the sunshine, with a guard on each side of him as\nan escort. He was on the same mountain road, but in the midst of the\ncompany-village. In the distance he saw the great building of the\nbreaker, and heard the incessant roar of machinery and falling coal. He\nmarched past a double lane of company houses and shanties, where\nslattern women in doorways and dirty children digging in the dust of the\nroadside paused and grinned at him--for he limped as he walked, and it\nwas evident enough what had happened to him.\n\nHal had come with love and curiosity. The love was greatly\ndiminished--evidently this was not the force which kept the wheels of\nindustry a-roll. But the curiosity was greater than ever. What was there\nso carefully hidden inside this coal-camp stockade?\n\nHal turned and looked at Bill, who had showed signs of humour the day\nbefore. \"See here,\" said he, \"you fellows have got my money, and you've\nblacked my eye and kicked me blue, so you ought to be satisfied. Before\nI go, tell me about it, won't you?\"\n\n\"Tell you what?\" growled Bill.\n\n\"Why did I get this?\"\n\n\"Because you're too gay, kid. Didn't you know you had no business trying\nto sneak in here?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Hal; \"but that's not what I mean. Why didn't you let me in\nat first?\"\n\n\"If you wanted a job in a mine,\" demanded the man, \"why didn't you go at\nit in the regular way?\"\n\n\"I didn't know the regular way.\"\n\n\"That's just it. And we wasn't takin' chances with you. You didn't look\nstraight.\"\n\n\"But what did you think I was? What are you afraid of?\"\n\n\"Go on!\" said the man. \"You can't work me!\"\n\nHal walked a few steps in silence, pondering how to break through. \"I\nsee you're suspicious of me,\" he said. \"I'll tell you the truth, if\nyou'll let me.\" Then, as the other did not forbid him, \"I'm a college\nboy, and I wanted to see life and shift for myself a while. I thought it\nwould be a lark to come here.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Bill, \"this ain't no foot-ball field. It's a coal-mine.\"\n\nHal saw that his story had been accepted. \"Tell me straight,\" he said,\n\"what did you think I was?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't mind telling,\" growled Bill. \"There's union agitators\ntrying to organise these here camps, and we ain't taking no chances with\n'em. This company gets its men through agencies, and if you'd went and\nsatisfied them, you'd 'a been passed in the regular way. Or if you'd\nwent to the office down in Pedro and got a pass, you'd 'a been all\nright. But when a guy turns up at the gate, and looks like a dude and\ntalks like a college perfessor, he don't get by, see?\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Hal. And then, \"If you'll give me the price of a breakfast\nout of my money, I'll be obliged.\"\n\n\"Breakfast is over,\" said Bill. \"You sit round till the pinyons gets\nripe.\" He laughed; but then, mellowed by his own joke, he took a quarter\nfrom his pocket and passed it to Hal. He opened the padlock on the gate\nand saw him out with a grin; and so ended Hal's first turn on the wheels\nof industry.\n\n\n\nSECTION 3.\n\nHal Warner started to drag himself down the road, but was unable to make\nit. He got as far as a brooklet that came down the mountain-side, from\nwhich he might drink without fear of typhoid; there he lay the whole\nday, fasting. Towards evening a thunder-storm came up, and he crawled\nunder the shelter of a rock, which was no shelter at all. His single\nblanket was soon soaked through, and he passed a night almost as\nmiserable as the previous one. He could not sleep, but he could think,\nand he thought about what had happened to him. \"Bill\" had said that a\ncoal mine was not a foot-ball field, but it seemed to Hal that the net\nimpress of the two was very much the same. He congratulated himself that\nhis profession was not that of a union organiser.\n\nAt dawn he dragged himself up, and continued his journey, weak from cold\nand unaccustomed lack of food. In the course of the day he reached a\npower-station near the foot of the canyon. He did not have the price of\na meal, and was afraid to beg; but in one of the group of buildings by\nthe roadside was a store, and he entered and inquired concerning prunes,\nwhich were twenty-five cents a pound. The price was high, but so was the\naltitude, and as Hal found in the course of time, they explained the one\nby the other--not explaining, however, why the altitude of the price was\nalways greater than the altitude of the store. Over the counter he saw a\nsign: \"We buy scrip at ten per cent discount.\" He had heard rumours of a\nstate law forbidding payment of wages in \"scrip\"; but he asked no\nquestions, and carried off his very light pound of prunes, and sat down\nby the roadside and munched them.\n\nJust beyond the power-house, down on the railroad track, stood a little\ncabin with a garden behind it. He made his way there, and found a\none-legged old watchman. He asked permission to spend the night on the\nfloor of the cabin; and seeing the old fellow look at his black eye, he\nexplained, \"I tried to get a job at the mine, and they thought I was a\nunion organiser.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the man, \"I don't want no union organisers round here.\"\n\n\"But I'm not one,\" pleaded Hal.\n\n\"How do I know what you are? Maybe you're a company spy.\"\n\n\"All I want is a dry place to sleep,\" said Hal. \"Surely it won't be any\nharm for you to give me that.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure,\" the other answered. \"However, you can spread your\nblanket in the corner. But don't you talk no union business to me.\"\n\nHal had no desire to talk. He rolled himself in his blanket and slept\nlike a man untroubled by either love or curiosity. In the morning the\nold fellow gave him a slice of corn bread and some young onions out of\nhis garden, which had a more delicious taste than any breakfast that had\never been served him. When Hal thanked his host in parting, the latter\nremarked: \"All right, young fellow, there's one thing you can do to pay\nme, and that is, say nothing about it. When a man has grey hair on his\nhead and only one leg, he might as well be drowned in the creek as lose\nhis job.\"\n\nHal promised, and went his way. His bruises pained him less, and he was\nable to walk. There were ranch-houses in sight--it was like coming back\nsuddenly to America!\n\n\n\nSECTION 4.\n\nHal had now before him a week's adventures as a hobo: a genuine hobo,\nwith no ten dollar bill inside his belt to take the reality out of his\nexperiences. He took stock of his worldly goods and wondered if he still\nlooked like a dude. He recalled that he had a smile which had fascinated\nthe ladies; would it work in combination with a black eye? Having no\nother means of support, he tried it on susceptible looking housewives,\nand found it so successful that he was tempted to doubt the wisdom of\nhonest labour. He sang the Harrigan song no more, but instead the words\nof a hobo-song he had once heard:\n\n\"Oh, what's the use of workin' when there's women in the land?\"\n\nThe second day he made the acquaintance of two other gentlemen of the\nroad, who sat by the railroad-track toasting some bacon over a fire.\nThey welcomed him, and after they had heard his story, adopted him into\nthe fraternity and instructed him in its ways of life. Pretty soon he\nmade the acquaintance of one who had been a miner, and was able to give\nhim the information he needed before climbing another canyon.\n\n\"Dutch Mike\" was the name this person bore, for reasons he did not\nexplain. He was a black-eyed and dangerous-looking rascal, and when the\nsubject of mines and mining was broached, he opened up the flood-gates\nof an amazing reservoir of profanity. He was through with that game--Hal\nor any other God-damned fool might have his job for the asking. It was\nonly because there were so many natural-born God-damned fools in the\nworld that the game could be kept going. \"Dutch Mike\" went on to relate\ndreadful tales of mine-life, and to summon before him the ghosts of one\npit-boss after another, consigning them to the fires of eternal\nperdition.\n\n\"I wanted to work while I was young,\" said he, \"but now I'm cured, an'\nfer good.\" The world had come to seem to him a place especially\nconstructed for the purpose of making him work, and every faculty he\npossessed was devoted to foiling this plot. Sitting by a camp-fire near\nthe stream which ran down the valley, Hal had a merry time pointing out\nto \"Dutch Mike\" how he worked harder at dodging work than other men\nworked at working. The hobo did not seem to mind that, however--it was a\nmatter of principle with him, and he was willing to make sacrifices for\nhis convictions. Even when they had sent him to the work-house, he had\nrefused to work; he had been shut in a dungeon, and had nearly died on a\ndiet of bread and water, rather than work. If everybody would do the\nsame, he said, they would soon \"bust things.\"\n\nHal took a fancy to this spontaneous revolutionist, and travelled with\nhim for a couple of days, in the course of which he pumped him as to\ndetails of the life of a miner. Most of the companies used regular\nemployment agencies, as the guard had mentioned; but the trouble was,\nthese agencies got something from your pay for a long time--the bosses\nwere \"in cahoots\" with them. When Hal wondered if this were not against\nthe law, \"Cut it out, Bo!\" said his companion. \"When you've had a job\nfor a while, you'll know that the law in a coal-camp is what your boss\ntells you.\" The hobo went on to register his conviction that when one\nman has the giving of jobs, and other men have to scramble for them, the\nlaw would never have much to say in the deal. Hal judged this a profound\nobservation, and wished that it might be communicated to the professor\nof political economy at Harrigan.\n\nOn the second night of his acquaintance with \"Dutch Mike,\" their\n\"jungle\" was raided by a constable with half a dozen deputies; for a\ndetermined effort was being made just then to drive vagrants from the\nneighbourhood--or to get them to work in the mines. Hal's friend, who\nslept with one eye open, made a break in the darkness, and Hal followed\nhim, getting under the guard of the raiders by a foot-ball trick. They\nleft their food and blankets behind them, but \"Dutch Mike\" made light of\nthis, and lifted a chicken from a roost to keep them cheerful through\nthe night hours, and stole a change of underclothing off a clothes-line\nthe next day. Hal ate the chicken, and wore the underclothing, thus\nbeginning his career in crime.\n\nParting from \"Dutch Mike,\" he went back to Pedro. The hobo had told him\nthat saloon-keepers nearly always had friends in the coal-camps, and\ncould help a fellow to a job. So Hal began enquiring, and the second one\nreplied, Yes, he would give him a letter to a man at North Valley, and\nif he got the job, the friend would deduct a dollar a month from his\npay. Hal agreed, and set out upon another tramp up another canyon, upon\nthe strength of a sandwich \"bummed\" from a ranch-house at the entrance\nto the valley. At another stockaded gate of the General Fuel Company he\npresented his letter, addressed to a person named O'Callahan, who turned\nout also to be a saloon-keeper.\n\nThe guard did not even open the letter, but passed Hal in at sight of\nit, and he sought out his man and applied for work. The man said he\nwould help him, but would have to deduct a dollar a month for himself,\nas well as a dollar for his friend in Pedro. Hal kicked at this, and\nthey bartered back and forth; finally, when Hal turned away and\nthreatened to appeal directly to the \"super,\" the saloon-keeper\ncompromised on a dollar and a half.\n\n\"You know mine-work?\" he asked.\n\n\"Brought up at it,\" said Hal, made wise, now, in the ways of the world.\n\n\"Where did you work?\"\n\nHal named several mines, concerning which he had learned something from\nthe hoboes. He was going by the name of \"Joe Smith,\" which he judged\nlikely to be found on the payroll of any mine. He had more than a week's\ngrowth of beard to disguise him, and had picked up some profanity as\nwell.\n\nThe saloon-keeper took him to interview Mr. Alec Stone, pit-boss in\nNumber Two mine, who inquired promptly: \"You know anything about mules?\"\n\n\"I worked in a stable,\" said Hal, \"I know about horses.\"\n\n\"Well, mules is different,\" said the man. \"One of my stable-men got the\ncolic the other day, and I don't know if he'll ever be any good again.\"\n\n\"Give me a chance,\" said Hal. \"I'll manage them.\"\n\nThe boss looked him over. \"You look like a bright chap,\" said he. \"I'll\npay you forty-five a month, and if you make good I'll make it fifty.\"\n\n\"All right, sir. When do I start in?\"\n\n\"You can't start too quick to suit me. Where's your duds?\"\n\n\"This is all I've got,\" said Hal, pointing to the bundle of stolen\nunderwear in his hand.\n\n\"Well, chuck it there in the corner,\" said the man; then suddenly he\nstopped, and looked at Hal, frowning. \"You belong to any union?\"\n\n\"Lord, no!\"\n\n\"Did you _ever_ belong to any union?\"\n\n\"No, sir. Never.\"\n\nThe man's gaze seemed to imply that Hal was lying, and that his secret\nsoul was about to be read. \"You have to swear to that, you know, before\nyou can work here.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Hal, \"I'm willing.\"\n\n\"I'll see you about it to-morrow,\" said the other. \"I ain't got the\npaper with me. By the way, what's your religion?\"\n\n\"Seventh Day Adventist.\"\n\n\"Holy Christ! What's that?\"\n\n\"It don't hurt,\" said Hal. \"I ain't supposed to work on Saturdays, but I\ndo.\"\n\n\"Well, don't you go preachin' it round here. We got our own\npreacher--you chip in fifty cents a month for him out of your wages.\nCome ahead now, and I'll take you down.\" And so it was that Hal got his\nstart in life.\n\n\n\nSECTION 5.\n\nThe mule is notoriously a profane and godless creature; a blind alley of\nNature, so to speak, a mistake of which she is ashamed, and which she\ndoes not permit to reproduce itself. The thirty mules under Hal's charge\nhad been brought up in an environment calculated to foster the worst\ntendencies of their natures. He soon made the discovery that the \"colic\"\nof his predecessor had been caused by a mule's hind foot in the stomach;\nand he realised that he must not let his mind wander for an instant, if\nhe were to avoid this dangerous disease.\n\nThese mules lived their lives in the darkness of the earth's interior;\nonly when they fell sick were they taken up to see the sunlight and to\nroll about in green pastures. There was one of them called \"Dago\nCharlie,\" who had learned to chew tobacco, and to rummage in the pockets\nof the miners and their \"buddies.\" Not knowing how to spit out the\njuice, he would make himself ill, and then he would swear off from\nindulgence. But the drivers and the pit-boys knew his failing, and would\ntempt \"Dago Charlie\" until he fell from grace. Hal soon discovered this\nmoral tragedy, and carried the pain of it in his soul as he went about\nhis all-day drudgery.\n\nHe went down the shaft with the first cage, which was very early in the\nmorning. He fed and watered his charges, and helped to harness them.\nThen, when the last four hoofs had clattered away, he cleaned out the\nstalls, and mended harness, and obeyed the orders of any person older\nthan himself who happened to be about.\n\nNext to the mules, his torment was the \"trapper-boys,\" and other\nyoungsters with whom he came into contact. He was a newcomer, and so\nthey hazed him; moreover, he had an inferior job--there seemed to their\nminds to be something humiliating and comic about the task of tending\nmules. These urchins came from a score of nations of Southern Europe and\nAsia; there were flat-faced Tartars and swarthy Greeks and shrewd-eyed\nlittle Japanese. They spoke a compromise language, consisting mainly of\nEnglish curse words and obscenities; the filthiness which their minds\nhad spawned was incredible to one born and raised in the sunlight. They\nalleged obscenities of their mothers and their grandmothers; also of the\nVirgin Mary, the one mythological character they had heard of. Poor\nlittle creatures of the dark, their souls grimed and smutted even more\nquickly and irrevocably than their faces!\n\nHal had been advised by his boss to inquire for board at \"Reminitsky's.\"\nHe came up in the last car, at twilight, and was directed to a dimly\nlighted building of corrugated iron, where upon inquiry he was met by a\nstout Russian, who told him he could be taken care of for twenty-seven\ndollars a month, this including a cot in a room with eight other single\nmen. After deducting a dollar and a half a month for his saloon-keepers,\nfifty cents for the company clergyman and a dollar for the company\ndoctor, fifty cents a month for wash-house privileges and fifty cents\nfor a sick and accident benefit fund, he had fourteen dollars a month\nwith which to clothe himself, to found a family, to provide himself with\nbeer and tobacco, and to patronise the libraries and colleges endowed by\nthe philanthropic owners of coal mines.\n\nSupper was nearly over at Reminitsky's when he arrived; the floor looked\nlike the scene of a cannibal picnic, and what food was left was cold. It\nwas always to be this way with him, he found, and he had to make the\nbest of it. The dining-room of this boarding-house, owned and managed by\nthe G. F. C., brought to his mind the state prison, which he had once\nvisited--with its rows of men sitting in silence, eating starch and\ngrease out of tin-plates. The plates here were of crockery half an inch\nthick, but the starch and grease never failed; the formula of\nReminitsky's cook seemed to be, When in doubt add grease, and boil it\nin. Even ravenous as Hal was after his long tramp and his labour below\nground, he could hardly swallow this food. On Sundays, the only time he\nate by daylight, the flies swarmed over everything, and he remembered\nhaving heard a physician say that an enlightened man should be more\nafraid of a fly than of a Bengal tiger. The boarding-house provided him\nwith a cot and a supply of vermin, but with no blanket, which was a\nnecessity in the mountain regions. So after supper he had to seek out\nhis boss, and arrange to get credit at the company-store. They were\nwilling to give a certain amount of credit, he found, as this would\nenable the camp-marshal to keep him from straying. There was no law to\nhold a man for debt--but Hal knew by this time how much a camp-marshal\ncared for law.\n\n\n\nSECTION 6.\n\nFor three days Hal toiled in the bowels of the mine, and ate and pursued\nvermin at Reminitsky's. Then came a blessed Sunday, and he had a couple\nof free hours to see the sunlight and to get a look at the North Valley\ncamp. It was a village straggling along more than a mile of the mountain\ncanyon. In the centre were the great breaker-buildings, the shaft-house,\nand the power-house with its tall chimneys; nearby were the\ncompany-store and a couple of saloons. There were several\nboarding-houses like Reminitsky's, and long rows of board cabins\ncontaining from two to four rooms each, some of them occupied by several\nfamilies. A little way up a slope stood a school-house, and another\nsmall one-room building which served as a church; the clergyman\nbelonging to the General Fuel Company denomination. He was given the use\nof the building, by way of start over the saloons, which had to pay a\nheavy rental to the company; it seemed a proof of the innate perversity\nof human nature that even in spite of this advantage, heaven was losing\nout in the struggle against hell in the coal-camp.\n\nAs one walked through this village, the first impression was of\ndesolation. The mountains towered, barren and lonely, scarred with the\nwounds of geologic ages. In these canyons the sun set early in the\nafternoon, the snow came early in the fall; everywhere Nature's hand\nseemed against man, and man had succumbed to her power. Inside the camps\none felt a still more cruel desolation--that of sordidness and\nanimalism. There were a few pitiful attempts at vegetable-gardens, but\nthe cinders and smoke killed everything, and the prevailing colour was\nof grime. The landscape was strewn with ash-heaps, old wire and\ntomato-cans, and smudged and smutty children playing.\n\nThere was a part of the camp called \"shanty-town,\" where, amid miniature\nmountains of slag, some of the lowest of the newly-arrived foreigners\nhad been permitted to build themselves shacks out of old boards, tin,\nand sheets of tar-paper. These homes were beneath the dignity of\nchicken-houses, yet in some of them a dozen people were crowded, men and\nwomen sleeping on old rags and blankets on a cinder floor. Here the\nbabies swarmed like maggots. They wore for the most part a single ragged\nsmock, and their bare buttocks were shamelessly upturned to the heavens.\nIt was so the children of the cave-men must have played, thought Hal;\nand waves of repulsion swept over him. He had come with love and\ncuriosity, but both motives failed here. How could a man of sensitive\nnerves, aware of the refinements and graces of life, learn to love these\npeople, who were an affront to his every sense--a stench to his\nnostrils, a jabbering to his ear, a procession of deformities to his\neye? What had civilisation done for them? What could it do? After all,\nwhat were they fit for, but the dirty work they were penned up to do? So\nspoke the haughty race-consciousness of the Anglo-Saxon, contemplating\nthese Mediterranean hordes, the very shape of whose heads was\nobjectionable.\n\nBut Hal stuck it out; and little by little new vision came to him. First\nof all, it was the fascination of the mines. They were old mines--veritable\ncities tunnelled out beneath the mountains, the main passages running\nfor miles. One day Hal stole off from his job, and took a trip with a\n\"rope-rider,\" and got through his physical senses a realisation of the\nvastness and strangeness and loneliness of this labyrinth of night. In\nNumber Two mine the vein ran up at a slope of perhaps five degrees; in\npart of it the empty cars were hauled in long trains by an endless rope,\nbut coming back loaded, they came of their own gravity. This involved\nmuch work for the \"spraggers,\" or boys who did the braking; it sometimes\nmeant run-away cars, and fresh perils added to the everyday perils of\ncoal-mining.\n\nThe vein varied from four to five feet in thickness; a cruelty of nature\nwhich made it necessary that the men at the \"working face\"--the place\nwhere new coal was being cut--should learn to shorten their stature.\nAfter Hal had squatted for a while and watched them at their tasks, he\nunderstood why they walked with head and shoulders bent over and arms\nhanging down, so that, seeing them coming out of the shaft in the\ngloaming, one thought of a file of baboons. The method of getting out\nthe coal was to \"undercut\" it with a pick, and then blow it loose with a\ncharge of powder. This meant that the miner had to lie on his side while\nworking, and accounted for other physical peculiarities.\n\nThus, as always, when one understood the lives of men, one came to pity\ninstead of despising. Here was a separate race of creatures,\nsubterranean, gnomes, pent up by society for purposes of its own.\nOutside in the sunshine-flooded canyon, long lines of cars rolled down\nwith their freight of soft-coal; coal which would go to the ends of the\nearth, to places the miner never heard of, turning the wheels of\nindustry whose products the miner would never see. It would make\nprecious silks for fine ladies, it would cut precious jewels for their\nadornment; it would carry long trains of softly upholstered cars across\ndeserts and over mountains; it would drive palatial steamships out of\nwintry tempests into gleaming tropic seas. And the fine ladies in their\nprecious silks and jewels would eat and sleep and laugh and lie at\nease--and would know no more of the stunted creatures of the dark than\nthe stunted creatures knew of them. Hal reflected upon this, and subdued\nhis Anglo-Saxon pride, finding forgiveness for what was repulsive in\nthese people--their barbarous, jabbering speech, their vermin-ridden\nhomes, their bare-bottomed babies.\n\n\n\nSECTION 7.\n\nIt chanced before many days that Hal got a holiday, relieving the\nmonotony of his labours as stableman: an accidental holiday, not\nprovided for in his bargain with the pit-boss. Something went wrong with\nthe ventilating-course in Number Two, and he began to notice a headache,\nand heard the men grumbling that their lamps were burning low. Then, as\nmatters began to get serious, orders came to get the mules to the\nsurface.\n\nWhich meant an amusing adventure. The delight of Hal's pets at seeing\nthe sunlight was irresistibly comic. They could not be kept from lying\ndown and rolling on their backs in the cinder-strewn street; and when\nthey were corralled in a distant part of the camp where actual grass\ngrew, they abandoned themselves to rapture like a horde of school\nchildren at a picnic.\n\nSo Hal had a few free hours; and being still young and not cured of idle\ncuriosities, he climbed the canyon wall to see the mountains. As he was\nsliding down again, toward evening, a vivid spot of colour was painted\ninto his picture of mine-life; he found himself in somebody's back yard,\nand being observed by somebody's daughter, who was taking in the family\nwash. It was a splendid figure of a lass, tall and vigorous, with the\nsort of hair that in polite circles is called auburn, and that flaming\ncolour in the cheeks which is Nature's recompense to people who live\nwhere it rains all the time. She was the first beautiful sight Hal had\nseen since he had come up the canyon, and it was only natural that he\nshould be interested. It seemed to him that, so long as the girl stared,\nhe had a right to stare back. It did not occur to him that he too was a\npleasing sight--that the mountain air had given colour to his cheeks and\na shine to his gay brown eyes, while the mountain winds had blown his\nwavy brown hair.\n\n\"Hello,\" said she, at last, in a warm voice, unmistakably Irish.\n\n\"Hello yourself,\" said Hal, in the accepted dialect; then he added, with\nmore elegance, \"Pardon me for trespassing on your wash.\"\n\nHer grey eyes opened wider. \"Go on!\" she said.\n\n\"I'd rather stay,\" said Hal. \"It's a beautiful sunset.\"\n\n\"I'll move, so ye can see it better.\" She carried her armful of clothes\nover and dropped them into the basket.\n\n\"No,\" said Hal, \"it's not so fine now. The colours have faded.\"\n\nShe turned and gazed at him again. \"Go on wid ye! I been teased about my\nhair since before I could talk.\"\n\n\"'Tis envy,\" said Hal, dropping into her way of speech; and he came a\nfew steps nearer, so that he could inspect the hair more closely. It lay\nabove her brow in undulations which were agreeable to the decorative\ninstinct, and a tight heavy braid of it fell over her shoulders and\nswung to her waist-line. He observed the shoulders, which were sturdy,\nobviously accustomed to hard labour; not conforming to accepted romantic\nstandards of femininity, yet having an athletic grace of their own. They\nwere covered with a faded blue calico dress, unfortunately not entirely\nclean; also, the young man noticed, there was a rent in one shoulder\nthrough which a patch of skin was visible. The girl's eyes, which had\nbeen following his, became defiant; she tossed a piece of her washing\nover the shoulder, where it stayed through the balance of the interview.\n\n\"Who are ye?\" she demanded, suddenly.\n\n\"My name's Joe Smith. I'm a stableman in Number Two.\"\n\n\"And what were ye doin' up there, if a body might ask?\" She lifted her\ngrey eyes to the bare mountainside, down which he had come sliding in a\nshower of loose stones and dirt.\n\n\"I've been surveying my empire,\" said he.\n\n\"Your what?\"\n\n\"My empire. The land belongs to the company, but the landscape belongs\nto him who cares for it.\"\n\nShe tossed her head a little. \"Where did ye learn to talk like ye do?\"\n\n\"In another life,\" said he--\"before I became a stableman. Not in entire\nforgetfulness, but trailing clouds of glory did I come.\"\n\nFor a moment she wrestled with this. Then a smile broke upon her face.\n\"Sure, 'tis like a poetry-book! Say some more!\"\n\n\"_O, singe fort, so suess und fein_!\" quoted Hal--and saw her look\npuzzled.\n\n\"Aren't you American?\" she inquired; and he laughed. To speak a foreign\nlanguage in North Valley was not a mark of culture!\n\n\"I've been listening to the crowd at Reminitsky's,\" he said,\napologetically.\n\n\"Oh! You eat there?\"\n\n\"I go there three times a day. I can't say I eat very much. Could you\nlive on greasy beans?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" laughed the girl, \"the good old pertaties is good enough for\nme.\"\n\n\"I should have said you lived on rose leaves!\" he observed.\n\n\"Go on wid ye! 'Tis the blarney-stone ye been kissin'!\"\n\n\"'Tis no stone I'd be wastin' my kisses on.\"\n\n\"Ye're gettin' bold, Mister Smith. I'll not listen to ye.\" And she\nturned away, and began industriously taking her clothes from the line.\nBut Hal did not want to be dismissed. He came a step closer.\n\n\"Coming down the mountain-side,\" he said, \"I found something wonderful.\nIt's bare and grim up there, but I came on a sheltered corner where the\nsun shone, and there was a wild rose. Only one! I thought to myself, 'So\nroses grow, even in the loneliest parts of the world!'\"\n\n\"Sure, 'tis a poetry-book again!\" she cried. \"Why didn't ye bring the\nrose?\"\n\n\"There is a poetry-book that tells us to 'leave the wild-rose on its\nstalk.' It will go on blooming there; but if one were to pluck it, it\nwould wither in a few hours.\"\n\nHe had meant nothing more by this than to keep the conversation going.\nBut her answer turned the tide of their acquaintance.\n\n\"Ye can never be sure, lad. Perhaps to-night a storm may come and blow\nit to pieces. Perhaps if ye'd pulled it and been happy, 'twould 'a been\nwhat the rose was for.\"\n\nWhatever of unconscious patronage there had been in the poet's attitude\nwas lost now in the eternal mystery. Whether the girl knew it--or\ncared--she had won the woman's first victory. She had caught the man's\nmind and pinned it with curiosity. What did this wild rose of the mining\ncamps mean?\n\nThe wild rose, apparently unconscious that she had said anything\nepoch-making, was busy with the wash; and meantime Hal Warner studied\nher features and pondered her words. From a lady of sophistication they\nwould have meant only one thing, an invitation; but in this girl's clear\ngrey eyes was nothing of wantonness, only pain. But what was this pain\nin the face and words of one so young, so eager and alive? Was it the\nmelancholy of her race, the thing one got in old folk-songs? Or was it a\nnew and special kind of melancholy, engendered in mining-camps in the\nfar West of America?\n\nThe girl's countenance was as intriguing as her words. Her grey eyes\nwere set under sharply defined dark brows, which did not match her hair.\nHer lips also were sharply defined, and straight, almost without curves,\nso that it seemed as if her mouth had been painted in carmine upon her\nface. These features gave her, when she stared at you, an aspect vivid\nand startling, bold, with a touch of defiance. But when she smiled, the\nred lips would curve into gentler lines, and the grey eyes would become\nwistful, and seemingly darker in colour. Winsome indeed, but not simple,\nwas this Irish lass!\n\n\n\nSECTION 8.\n\nHal asked the name of his new acquaintance, and she told him it was Mary\nBurke. \"Ye've not been here long, I take it,\" she said, \"or ye'd have\nheard of 'Red Mary.' 'Tis along of this hair.\"\n\n\"I've not been here long,\" he answered, \"but I shall hope to stay\nnow--along of this hair! May I come to see you some time, Miss Burke?\"\n\nShe did not reply, but glanced at the house where she lived. It was an\nunpainted, three room cabin, more dilapidated than the average, with\nbare dirt and cinders about it, and what had once been a picket-fence,\nnow falling apart and being used for stove-wood. The windows were\ncracked and broken, and upon the roof were signs of leaks that had been\ncrudely patched.\n\n\"May I come?\" he made haste to ask again--so that he would not seem to\nlook too critically at her home.\n\n\"Perhaps ye may,\" said the girl, as she picked up the clothes basket. He\nstepped forward, offering to carry it, but she did not give it up.\nHolding it tight, and looking him defiantly in the face, she said, \"Ye\nmay come, but ye'll not find it a happy place to visit, Mr. Smith. Ye'll\nhear soon enough from the neighbours.\"\n\n\"I don't think I know any of your neighbours,\" said he.\n\nThere was sympathy in his voice; but her look was no less defiant.\n\"Ye'll hear about it, Mr. Smith; but ye'll hear also that I hold me head\nup. And 'tis not so easy to do that in North Valley.\"\n\n\"You don't like the place?\" he asked; and he was amazed by the effect of\nthis question, which was merely polite. It was as if a storm cloud had\nswept over the girl's face. \"I hate it! 'Tis a place of fear and\ndevils!\"\n\nHe hesitated a moment; then, \"Will you tell me what you mean by that\nwhen I come?\"\n\nBut \"Red Mary\" was winsome again. \"When ye come, Mr. Smith, I'll not be\nentertaining ye with troubles. I'll put on me company manner, and we'll\ngo out for a nice walk, if ye please.\"\n\nAll the way as he walked back to Reminitsky's to supper, Hal thought\nabout this girl; not merely her pleasantness to the eye, so unexpected\nin this place of desolation, but her personality, which baffled him--the\npain that seemed always just beneath the surface of her thoughts, the\nfierce pride which flashed out at the slightest suggestion of sympathy,\nthe way she had of brightening when he spoke the language of metaphor,\nhowever trite. How had she come to know about poetry-books? He wanted to\nknow more about this miracle of Nature--this wild rose blooming on a\nbare mountain-side!\n\n\n\nSECTION 9.\n\nThere was one of Mary Burke's remarks upon which Hal soon got light--her\nstatement that North Valley was a place of fear. He listened to the\ntales of these underworld men, until it came so that he shuddered with\ndread each time that he went down in the cage.\n\nThere was a wire-haired and almond eyed Korean, named Cho, a\n\"rope-rider\" in Hal's part of the mine. He was one of those who had\ncharge of the long trains of cars, called \"trips,\" which were hauled\nthrough the main passage-ways; the name \"rope-rider\" came from the fact\nthat he sat on the heavy iron ring to which the rope was attached. He\ninvited Hal to a seat with him, and Hal accepted, at peril of his job as\nwell as of his limbs. Cho had picked up what he fondly thought was\nEnglish, and now and then one could understand a word. He pointed upon\nthe ground, and shouted above the rattle of the cars: \"Big dust!\" Hal\nsaw that the ground was covered with six inches of coal-dust, while on\nthe old disused walls one could write his name in it. \"Much blow-up!\"\nsaid the rope-rider; and when the last empty cars had been shunted off\ninto the working-rooms, and he was waiting to make up a return \"trip,\"\nhe laboured with gestures to explain what he meant. \"Load cars. Bang!\nBust like hell!\"\n\nHal knew that the mountain air in this region was famous for its\ndryness; he learned now that the quality which meant life to invalids\nfrom every part of the world meant death to those who toiled to keep the\ninvalids warm. Driven through the mines by great fans, this air took out\nevery particle of moisture, and left coal dust so thick and dry that\nthere were fatal explosions from the mere friction of loading-shovels.\nSo it happened that these mines were killing several times as many men\nas other mines throughout the country.\n\nWas there no remedy for this, Hal asked, talking with one of his\nmule-drivers, Tim Rafferty, the evening after his ride with Cho. There\nwas a remedy, said Tim--the law required sprinkling the mines with\n\"adobe-dust\"; and once in Tim's life, he remembered this law's being\nobeyed. There had come some \"big fellows\" inspecting things, and\nprevious to their visit there had been an elaborate campaign of\nsprinkling. But that had been several years ago, and now the apparatus\nwas stored away, nobody knew where, and one heard nothing about\nsprinkling.\n\nIt was the same with precautions against gas. The North Valley mines\nwere especially \"gassy,\" it appeared. In these old rambling passages one\nsmelt a stink as of all the rotten eggs in all the barn-yards of the\nworld; and this sulphuretted hydrogen was the least dangerous of the\ngases against which a miner had to contend. There was the dreaded\n\"choke-damp,\" which was odourless, and heavier than air. Striking into\nsoft, greasy coal, one would open a pocket of this gas, a deposit laid\nup for countless ages, awaiting its predestined victim. A man might sink\nto sleep as he lay at work, and if his \"buddy,\" or helper, happened to\nbe out of sight, and to delay a minute too long, it would be all over\nwith the man. And there was the still more dreaded \"fire-damp,\" which\nmight wreck a whole mine, and kill scores and even hundreds of men.\n\nAgainst these dangers there was a \"fire-boss,\" whose duty was to go\nthrough the mine, testing for gas, and making sure that the\nventilating-course was in order, and the fans working properly. The\n\"fire-boss\" was supposed to make his rounds in the early morning, and\nthe law specified that no one should go to work till he had certified\nthat all was safe. But what if the \"fire-boss\" overslept himself, or\nhappened to be drunk? It was too much to expect thousands of dollars to\nbe lost for such a reason. So sometimes one saw men ordered to their\nwork, and sent down grumbling and cursing. Before many hours some of\nthem would be prostrated with headache, and begging to be taken out; and\nperhaps the superintendent would not let them out, because if a few\ncame, the rest would get scared and want to come also.\n\nOnce, only last year, there had been an accident of that sort. A young\nmule-driver, a Croatian, told Hal about it while they sat munching the\ncontents of their dinner-pails. The first cage-load of men had gone down\ninto the mine, sullenly protesting; and soon afterwards some one had\ntaken down a naked light, and there had been an explosion which had\nsounded like the blowing up of the inside of the world. Eight men had\nbeen killed, the force of the explosion being so great that some of the\nbodies had been wedged between the shaft wall and the cage, and it had\nbeen necessary to cut them to pieces to get them out. It was them Japs\nthat were to blame, vowed Hal's informant. They hadn't ought to turn\nthem loose in coal mines, for the devil himself couldn't keep a Jap from\nsneaking off to get a smoke.\n\nSo Hal understood how North Valley was a place of fear. What tales the\nold chambers of these mines could have told, if they had had voices! Hal\nwatched the throngs pouring in to their labours, and reflected that\naccording to the statisticians of the government eight or nine of every\nthousand of them were destined to die violent deaths before a year was\nout, and some thirty more would be badly injured. And they knew this,\nthey knew it better than all the statisticians of the government; yet\nthey went to their tasks! Reflecting upon this, Hal was full of wonder.\nWhat was the force that kept men at such a task? Was it a sense of duty?\nDid they understand that society had to have coal and that some one had\nto do the \"dirty work\" of providing it? Did they have a vision of a\nfuture, great and wonderful, which was to grow out of their ill-requited\ntoil? Or were they simply fools or cowards, submitting blindly, because\nthey had not the wit nor the will to do otherwise? Curiosity held him,\nhe wanted to understand the inner souls of these silent and patient\narmies which through the ages have surrendered their lives to other\nmen's control.\n\n\n\nSECTION 10.\n\nHal was coming to know these people; to see them no longer as a mass,\nto be despised or pitied in bulk, but as individuals, with individual\ntemperaments and problems, exactly like people in the world of the\nsunlight. Mary Burke and Tim Rafferty, Cho the Korean and Madvik the\nCroatian--one by one these individualities etched themselves into the\nforeground of Hal's picture, making it a thing of life, moving him to\nsympathy and fellowship. Some of these people, to be sure, were stunted\nand dulled to a sordid ugliness of soul and body--but on the other hand,\nsome of them were young, and had the light of hope in their hearts, and\nthe spark of rebellion.\n\nThere was \"Andy,\" a boy of Greek parentage; Androkulos was his right\nname--but it was too much to expect any one to get that straight in a\ncoal-camp. Hal noticed him at the store, and was struck by his beautiful\nfeatures, and the mournful look in his big black eyes. They got to\ntalking, and Andy made the discovery that Hal had not spent all his time\nin coal-camps, but had seen the great world. It was pitiful, the\nexcitement that came into his voice; he was yearning for life, with its\njoys and adventures--and it was his destiny to sit ten hours a day by\nthe side of a chute, with the rattle of coal in his ears and the dust of\ncoal in his nostrils, picking out slate with his fingers. He was one of\nmany scores of \"breaker-boys.\"\n\n\"Why don't you go away?\" asked Hal.\n\n\"Christ! How I get away? Got mother, two sisters.\"\n\n\"And your father?\" So Hal made the discovery that Andy's father had been\none of those men whose bodies had had to be cut to pieces to get them\nout of the shaft. Now the son was chained to the father's place, until\nhis time too should come!\n\n\"Don't want to be miner!\" cried the boy. \"Don't want to get _kil-lid_!\"\n\nHe began to ask, timidly, what Hal thought he could do if he were to run\naway from his family and try his luck in the world outside. Hal,\nstriving to remember where he had seen olive-skinned Greeks with big\nblack eyes in this beautiful land of the free, could hold out no better\nprospect than a shoe-shining parlour, or the wiping out of wash-bowls in\na hotel-lavatory, handing over the tips to a fat padrone.\n\nAndy had been to school, and had learned to read English, and the\nteacher had loaned him books and magazines with wonderful pictures in\nthem; now he wanted more than pictures, he wanted the things which they\nportrayed. So Hal came face to face with one of the difficulties of\nmine-operators. They gathered a population of humble serfs, selected\nfrom twenty or thirty races of hereditary bondsmen; but owing to the\nabsurd American custom of having public-schools, the children of this\npopulation learned to speak English, and even to read it. So they became\ntoo good for their lot in life; and then a wandering agitator would get\nin, and all of a sudden there would be hell. Therefore in every\ncoal-camp had to be another kind of \"fire-boss,\" whose duty it was to\nguard against another kind of explosions--not of carbon monoxide, but of\nthe human soul.\n\nThe immediate duties of this office in North Valley devolved upon Jeff\nCotton, the camp-marshal. He was not at all what one would have expected\nfrom a person of his trade--lean and rather distinguished-looking, a man\nwho in evening clothes might have passed for a diplomat. But his mouth\nwould become ugly when he was displeased, and he carried a gun with six\nnotches upon it; also he wore a deputy-sheriff's badge, to give him\nimmunity for other notches he might wish to add. When Jeff Cotton came\nnear, any man who was explosive went off to be explosive by himself. So\nthere was \"order\" in North Valley, and it was only on Saturday and\nSunday nights, when the drunks had to be suppressed, or on Monday\nmornings when they had to be haled forth and kicked to their work, that\none realised upon what basis this \"order\" rested.\n\nBesides Jeff Cotton, and his assistant, \"Bud\" Adams, who wore badges,\nand were known, there were other assistants who wore no badges, and were\nnot supposed to be known. Coming up in the cage one evening, Hal made\nsome remark to the Croatian mule-driver, Madvik, about the high price of\ncompany-store merchandise, and was surprised to get a sharp kick on the\nankle. Afterwards, as they were on their way to supper, Madvik gave him\nthe reason. \"Red-faced feller, Gus. Look out for him--company spotter.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" said Hal, with interest. \"How do you know?\"\n\n\"I know. Everybody know.\"\n\n\"He don't look like he had much sense,\" said Hal--who had got his idea\nof detectives from Sherlock Holmes.\n\n\"No take much sense. Go pit-boss, say, 'Joe feller talk too much. Say\nstore rob him.' Any damn fool do that. Hey?\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" admitted Hal. \"And the company pays him for it?\"\n\n\"Pit-boss pay him. Maybe give him drink, maybe two bits. Then pit-boss\ncome to you: 'You shoot your mouth off too much, feller. Git the hell\nout of here!' See?\"\n\nHal saw.\n\n\"So you go down canyon. Then maybe you go 'nother mine. Boss say, 'Where\nyou work?' You say 'North Valley.' He say, 'What your name?' You say,\n'Joe Smith.' He say, 'Wait.' He go in, look at paper; he come out, say,\n'No job!' You say, 'Why not?' He say, 'Shoot off your mouth too much,\nfeller. Git the hell out of here!' See?\"\n\n\"You mean a black-list,\" said Hal.\n\n\"Sure, black-list. Maybe telephone, find out all about you. You do\nanything bad, like talk union\"--Madvik had dropped his voice and\nwhispered the word \"union\"--\"they send your picture--don't get job\nnowhere in state. How you like that?\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 11.\n\nBefore long Hal had a chance to see this system of espionage at work,\nand he began to understand something of the force which kept these\nsilent and patient armies at their tasks. On a Sunday morning he was\nstrolling with his mule-driver friend Tim Rafferty, a kindly lad with a\npair of dreamy blue eyes in his coal-smutted face. They came to Tim's\nhome, and he invited Hal to come in and meet his family. The father was\na bowed and toil-worn man, but with tremendous strength in his solid\nframe, the product of many generations of labour in coal-mines. He was\nknown as \"Old Rafferty,\" despite the fact that he was well under fifty.\nHe had been a pit-boy at the age of nine, and he showed Hal a faded\nleather album with pictures of his ancestors in the \"oul' country\"--men\nwith sad, deeply lined faces, sitting very stiff and solemn to have\ntheir presentments made permanent for posterity.\n\nThe mother of the family was a gaunt, grey-haired woman, with no teeth,\nbut with a warm heart. Hal took to her, because her home was clean; he\nsat on the family door-step, amid a crowd of little Rafferties with\nnewly-washed Sunday faces, and fascinated them with tales of adventures\ncribbed from Clark Russell and Captain Mayne Reid. As a reward he was\ninvited to stay for dinner, and had a clean knife and fork, and a clean\nplate of steaming hot potatoes, with two slices of salt pork on the\nside. It was so wonderful that he forthwith inquired if he might forsake\nhis company boarding-house and come and board with them.\n\nMrs. Rafferty opened wide her eyes. \"Sure,\" exclaimed she, \"do you think\nyou'd be let?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Hal.\n\n\"Sure, 't would be a bad example for the others.\"\n\n\"Do you mean I _have_ to board at Reminitsky's?\"\n\n\"There be six company boardin'-houses,\" said the woman.\n\n\"And what would they do if I came to you?\"\n\n\"First you'd get a hint, and then you'd go down the canyon, and maybe us\nafter ye.\"\n\n\"But there's lots of people have boarders in shanty-town,\" objected Hal.\n\n\"Oh! Them wops! Nobody counts them--they live any way they happen to\nfall. But you started at Reminitsky's, and 't would not be healthy for\nthem that took ye away.\"\n\n\"I see,\" laughed Hal. \"There seem to be a lot of unhealthy things\nhereabouts.\"\n\n\"Sure there be! They sent down Nick Ammons because his wife bought milk\ndown the canyon. They had a sick baby, and it's not much you get in this\nthin stuff at the store. They put chalk in it, I think; any way, you can\nsee somethin' white in the bottom.\"\n\n\"So you have to trade at the store, too!\"\n\n\"I thought ye said ye'd worked in coal-mines,\" put in Old Rafferty, who\nhad been a silent listener.\n\n\"So I have,\" said Hal. \"But it wasn't quite that bad.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Mrs. Rafferty, \"I'd like to know where 'twas then--in this\ncountry. Me and me old man spent weary years a-huntin'.\"\n\nThus far the conversation had proceeded naturally; but suddenly it was\nas if a shadow passed over it--a shadow of fear. Hal saw Old Rafferty\nlook at his wife, and frown and make signs to her. After all, what did\nthey know about this handsome young stranger, who talked so glibly, and\nhad been in so many parts of the world?\n\n\"'Tis not complainin' we'd be,\" said the old man.\n\nAnd his wife made haste to add, \"If they let peddlers and the like of\nthem come in, 'twould be no end to it, I suppose. We find they treat us\nhere as well as anywhere.\"\n\n\"'Tis no joke, the life of workin' men, wherever ye try it,\" added the\nother; and when young Tim started to express an opinion, they shut him\nup with such evident anxiety that Hal's heart ached for them, and he\nmade haste to change the subject.\n\n\n\nSECTION 12.\n\nOn the evening of the same Sunday Hal went to pay his promised call upon\nMary Burke. She opened the front door of the cabin to let him in, and\neven by the dim rays of the little kerosene lamp, there came to him an\nimpression of cheerfulness. \"Hello,\" she said--just as she had said it\nwhen he had slid down the mountain into the family wash. He followed her\ninto the room, and saw that the impression he had got of cheerfulness\ncame from Mary herself. How bright and fresh she looked! The old blue\ncalico, which had not been entirely clean, was newly laundered now, and\non the shoulder where the rent had been was a neat patch of unfaded\nblue.\n\nThere being only three rooms in Mary's home, two of these necessarily\nbed-rooms, she entertained her company in the kitchen. The room was\nbare, Hal saw--there was not even so much as a clock by way of ornament.\nThe only charm the girl had been able to give to it, in preparation for\ncompany, was that of cleanness. The board floor had been newly sanded\nand scrubbed; the kitchen table also had been scrubbed, and the kettle\non the stove, and the cracked tea-pot and bowls on the shelf. Mary's\nlittle brother and sister were in the room: Jennie, a dark-eyed,\ndark-haired little girl, frail, with a sad, rather frightened face; and\nTommie, a round headed youngster, like a thousand other round headed and\nfreckle-faced boys. Both of them were now sitting very straight in their\nchairs, staring at the visitor with a certain resentment, he thought. He\nsuspected that they had been included in the general scrubbing. Inasmuch\nas it had been uncertain just when the visitor would come, they must\nhave been required to do this every night, and he could imagine family\ndisturbances, with arguments possibly not altogether complimentary to\nMary's new \"feller.\"\n\nThere seemed to be a certain uneasiness in the place.\n\nMary did not invite her company to a seat, but stood irresolute; and\nafter Hal had ventured a couple of friendly remarks to the children, she\nsaid, abruptly, \"Shall we be takin' that walk that we spoke of, Mr.\nSmith?\"\n\n\"Delighted!\" said Hal; and while she pinned on her hat before the broken\nmirror on the shelf, he smiled at the children and quoted two lines from\nhis Harrigan song--\n\n  \"Oh, Mary-Jane, come out in the lane,\n  The moon is a-shinin' in the old pecan!\"\n\nTommie and Jennie were too shy to answer, but Mary exclaimed, \"'Tis in a\ntin-can ye see it shinin' here!\"\n\nThey went out. In the soft summer night it was pleasant to stroll under\nthe moon--especially when they had come to the remoter parts of the\nvillage, where there were not so many weary people on door-steps and\nchildren playing noisily. There were other young couples walking here,\nunder the same moon; the hardest day's toil could not so sap their\nenergies that they did not feel the spell of this soft summer night.\n\nHal, being tired, was content to stroll and enjoy the stillness; but\nMary Burke sought information about the mysterious young man she was\nwith. \"Ye've not worked long in coal-mines, Mr. Smith?\" she remarked.\n\nHal was a trifle disconcerted. \"How did you find that out?\"\n\n\"Ye don't look it--ye don't talk it. Ye're not like anybody or anything\naround here. I don't know how to say it, but ye make me think more of\nthe poetry-books.\"\n\nFlattered as Hal was by this na\u00c3\u00afve confession, he did not want to talk\nof the mystery of himself. He took refuge in a question about the\n\"poetry-books.\" \"I've read some,\" said the girl; \"more than ye'd have\nthought, perhaps.\" This with a flash of her defiance.\n\nHe asked more questions, and learned that she, like the Greek boy,\n\"Andy,\" had come under the influence of that disturbing American\ninstitution, the public-school; she had learned to read, and the pretty\nyoung teacher had helped her, lending her books and magazines. Thus she\nhad been given a key to a treasure-house, a magic carpet on which to\ntravel over the world. These similes Mary herself used--for the Arabian\nNights had been one of the books that were loaned to her. On rainy days\nshe would hide behind the sofa, reading at a spot where the light crept\nin--so that she might be safe from small brothers and sisters!\n\nJoe Smith had read these same books, it appeared; and this seemed\nremarkable to Mary, for books cost money and were hard to get. She\nexplained how she had searched the camp for new magic carpets, finding a\n\"poetry-book\" by Longfellow, and a book of American history, and a story\ncalled \"David Copperfield,\" and last and strangest of all, another story\ncalled \"Pride and Prejudice.\" A curious freak of fortune--the prim and\nsentimentally quivering Jane Austen in a coal-camp in a far Western\nwilderness! An adventure for Jane, as well as for Mary!\n\nWhat had Mary made of it, Hal wondered. Had she revelled, shop-girl\nfashion, in scenes of pallid ease? He learned that what she had made of\nit was despair. This world outside, with its freedom and cleanness, its\npeople living gracious and worth-while lives, was not for her; she was\nchained to a scrub-pail in a coal-camp. Things had got so much worse\nsince the death of her mother, she said. Her voice had become dull and\nhard--Hal thought that he had never heard a young voice express such\nhopelessness.\n\n\"You've never been anywhere but here?\" he asked.\n\n\"I been in two other camps,\" she said--\"first the Gordon, and then East\nRun. But they're all alike.\"\n\n\"But you've been down to the towns?\"\n\n\"Only for a day, once or twice a year. Once I was in Sheridan, and in a\nchurch I heard a lady sing.\"\n\nShe stopped for a moment, lost in this memory. Then suddenly her voice\nchanged--and he could imagine in the darkness that she had tossed her\nhead defiantly. \"I'll not be entertainin' company with my troubles! Ye\nknow how tiresome that is when ye hear it from somebody else--like my\nnext-door neighbour, Mrs. Zamboni. D' ye know her?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Hal.\n\n\"The poor old lady has troubles enough, God knows. Her man's not much\ngood--he's troubled with the drink; and she's got eleven childer, and\nthat's too many for one woman. Don't ye think so?\"\n\nShe asked this with a na\u00c3\u00afvet\u00c3\u00a9 which made Hal laugh. \"Yes,\" he said, \"I\ndo.\"\n\n\"Well, I think people'd help her more if she'd not complain so! And half\nof it in the Slavish language, that a body can't understand!\" So Mary\nbegan to tell funny things about Mrs. Zamboni and her other polyglot\nneighbours, imitating their murdering of the Irish dialect. Hal thought\nher humour was na\u00c3\u00afve and delightful, and he led her on to more cheerful\ngossip during the remainder of their walk.\n\n\n\nSECTION 13.\n\nBut then, as they were on their way home, tragedy fell upon them.\nHearing a step behind them, Mary turned and looked; then catching Hal by\nthe arm, she drew him into the shadows at the side, whispering to him to\nbe silent. The bent figure of a man went past them, lurching from side\nto side.\n\nWhen he had turned and gone into the house, Mary said, \"It's my father.\nHe's ugly when he's like that.\" And Hal could hear her quick breathing\nin the darkness.\n\nSo that was Mary's trouble--the difficulty in her home life to which she\nhad referred at their first meeting! Hal understood many things in a\nflash--why her home was bare of ornament, and why she did not invite her\ncompany to sit down. He stood silent, not knowing what to say. Before he\ncould find the word, Mary burst out, \"Oh, how I hate O'Callahan, that\nsells the stuff to my father! His home with plenty to eat in it, and his\nwife dressin' in silk and goin' down to mass every Sunday, and thinkin'\nherself too good for a common miner's daughter! Sometimes I think I'd\nlike to kill them both.\"\n\n\"That wouldn't help much,\" Hal ventured.\n\n\"No, I know--there'd only be some other one in his place. Ye got to do\nmore than that, to change things here. Ye got to get after them that\nmake money out of O'Callahan.\"\n\nSo Mary's mind was groping for causes! Hal had thought her excitement\nwas due to humiliation, or to fear of a scene of violence when she\nreached home; but she was thinking of the deeper aspects of this\nterrible drink problem. There was still enough unconscious snobbery in\nHal Warner for him to be surprised at this phenomenon in a common\nminer's daughter; and so, as at their first meeting, his pity was turned\nto intellectual interest.\n\n\"They'll stop the drink business altogether some day,\" he said. He had\nnot known that he was a Prohibitionist; he had become one suddenly!\n\n\"Well,\" she answered, \"they'd best stop it soon, if they don't want to\nbe too late. 'Tis a sight to make your heart sick to see the young lads\ncomin' home staggerin', too drunk even to fight.\"\n\nHal had not had time to see much of this aspect of North Valley. \"They\nsell to boys?\" he asked.\n\n\"Sure, who's to care? A boy's money's as good as a man's.\"\n\n\"But I should think the company--\"\n\n\"The company lets the saloon-buildin'--that's all the company cares.\"\n\n\"But they must care something about the efficiency of their hands!\"\n\n\"Sure, there's plenty more where they come from. When ye can't work,\nthey fire ye, and that's all there is to it.\"\n\n\"And is it so easy to get skilled men?\"\n\n\"It don't take much skill to get out coal. The skill is in keepin' your\nbones whole--and if you can stand breakin' 'em, the company can stand\nit.\"\n\nThey had come to the little cabin. Mary stood for a moment in silence.\n\"I'm talkin' bitter again!\" she exclaimed suddenly. \"And I promised ye\nme company manner! But things keep happening to set me off.\" And she\nturned abruptly and ran into the house. Hal stood for a moment wondering\nif she would return; then, deciding that she had meant that as good\nnight, he went slowly up the street.\n\nHe fought against a mood of real depression, the first he had known\nsince his coming to North Valley. He had managed so far to keep a\ncertain degree of aloofness, that he might see this industrial world\nwithout prejudice. But to-night his pity for Mary had involved him more\ndeeply. To be sure, he might be able to help her, to find her work in\nsome less crushing environment; but his mind went on to the\nquestion--how many girls might there be in mining-camps, young and\neager, hungering for life, but crushed by poverty, and by the burden of\nthe drink problem?\n\nA man walked past Hal, greeting him in the semi-darkness with a nod and\na motion of the hand. It was the Reverend Spragg, the gentleman who was\nofficially commissioned to combat the demon rum in North Valley.\n\nHal had been to the little white church the Sunday before, and heard the\nReverend Spragg preach a doctrinal sermon, in which the blood of the\nlamb was liberally sprinkled, and the congregation heard where and how\nthey were to receive compensation for the distresses they endured in\nthis vale of tears.\n\nWhat a mockery it seemed! Once, indubitably, people had believed such\ndoctrines; they had been willing to go to the stake for them. But now\nnobody went to the stake for them--on the contrary, the company\ncompelled every worker to contribute out of his scanty earnings towards\nthe preaching of them. How could the most ignorant of zealots confront\nsuch an arrangement without suspicion of his own piety? Somewhere at the\nhead of the great dividend-paying machine that was called the General\nFuel Company must be some devilish intelligence that had worked it all\nout, that had given the orders to its ecclesiastical staff: \"We want the\npresent--we leave you the future! We want the bodies--we leave you the\nsouls! Teach them what you will about heaven--so long as you let us\nplunder them on earth!\"\n\nIn accordance with this devil's program, the Reverend Spragg might\ndenounce the demon rum, but he said nothing about dividends based on the\nrenting of rum-shops, nor about local politicians maintained by company\ncontributions, plus the profits of wholesale liquor. He said nothing\nabout the conclusions of modern hygiene, concerning over-work as a cause\nof the craving for alcohol; the phrase \"industrial drinking,\" it seemed,\nwas not known in General Fuel Company theology! In fact, when you\nlistened to such a sermon, you would never have guessed that the hearers\nof it had physical bodies at all; certainly you would never have guessed\nthat the preacher had a body, which was nourished by food produced by\nthe overworked and under-nourished wage-slaves whom he taught!\n\n\n\nSECTION 14.\n\nFor the most part the victims of this system were cowed and spoke of\ntheir wrongs only in whispers; but there was one place in the camp, Hal\nfound, where they could not keep silence, where their sense of outrage\nbattled with their fear. This place was the solar plexus of the\nmine-organism, the centre of its nervous energies; to change the simile,\nit was the judgment-seat, where the miner had sentence passed upon\nhim--sentence either to plenty, or to starvation and despair.\n\nThis place was the \"tipple,\" where the coal that came out of the mine\nwas weighed and recorded. Every digger, as he came from the cage, made\nfor this spot. There was a bulletin-board, and on it his number, and the\nrecord of the weights of the cars he had sent out that day. And every\nman, no matter how ignorant, had learned enough English to read those\nfigures.\n\nHal had gradually come to realise that here was the place of drama. Most\nof the men would look, and then, without a sound or glance about, would\nslouch off with drooping shoulders. Others would mumble to\nthemselves--or, what amounted to the same thing, would mumble to one\nanother in barbarous dialects. But about one in five could speak\nEnglish; and scarcely an evening passed that some man did not break\nloose, shaking his fist at the sky, or at the weigh-boss--behind the\nlatter's back. He might gather a knot of fellow-grumblers about him; it\nwas to be noted that the camp-marshal had the habit of being on hand at\nthis hour.\n\nIt was on one of these occasions that Hal first noticed Mike Sikoria, a\ngrizzle-haired old Slovak, who had spent twenty years in the mines of\nthese regions. All the bitterness of all the wrongs of all these years\nwelled up in Old Mike, as he shouted his score aloud: \"Nineteen,\ntwenty-two, twenty-four, twenty! Is that my weight, Mister? You want me\nto believe that's my weight?\"\n\n\"That's your weight,\" said the weigh-boss, coldly.\n\n\"Well, by Judas, your scale is off, Mister! Look at them cars--them cars\nis big! You measure them cars, Mister--seven feet long, three and a half\nfeet high, four feet wide. And you tell me them don't go but twenty?\"\n\n\"You don't load them right,\" said the boss.\n\n\"Don't load them right?\" echoed the old miner; he became suddenly\nplaintive, as if more hurt than angered by such an insinuation. \"You\nknow all the years I work, and you tell me I don't know a load? When I\nload a car, I load him like a miner, I don't load him like a Jap, that\ndon't know about a mine! I put it up--I chunk it up like a stack of hay.\nI load him square--like that.\" With gestures the old fellow was\nillustrating what he meant. \"See there! There's a ton on the top, and a\nton and a half on the bottom--and you tell me I get only nineteen,\ntwenty!\"\n\n\"That's your weight,\" said the boss, implacably.\n\n\"But, Mister, your scale is wrong! I tell you I used to get my weight. I\nused to get forty-five, forty-six on them cars. Here's my buddy--ask him\nif it ain't so. What is it, Bo?\"\n\n\"Um m m-mum,\" said Bo, who was a negro--though one could hardly be sure\nof this for the coal-dust on him.\n\n\"I can't make a living no more!\" exclaimed the old Slovak, his voice\ntrembling and his wizened dark eyes full of pleading. \"What you think I\nmake? For fifteen days, fifty cents! I pay board, and so help me God,\nMister--and I stand right here--I swear for God I make fifty cents. I\ndig the coal and I ain't got no weight, I ain't got nothing! Your scale\nis wrong!\"\n\n\"Get out!\" said the weigh-boss, turning away.\n\n\"But, Mister!\" cried Old Mike, following behind him, and pouring his\nwhole soul into his words. \"What is this life, Mister? You work like a\nburro, and you don't get nothing for it! You burn your own powder--half\na dollar a day powder--what you think of that? Crosscut--and you get\nnothing! Take the skip and a pillar, and you get nothing! Brush--and you\nget nothing! Here, by Judas, a poor man, going and working his body to\nthe last point, and blood is run out! You starve me to death, I say! I\nhave got to have something to eat, haven't I?\"\n\nAnd suddenly the boss whirled upon him. \"Get the hell out of here!\" he\nshouted. \"If you don't like it, get your time and quit. Shut your face,\nor I'll shut it for you.\"\n\nThe old man quailed and fell silent. He stood for a moment more, biting\nhis whiskered lips nervously; then his shoulders sank together, and he\nturned and slunk off, followed by his negro helper.\n\n\n\nSECTION 15.\n\nOld Mike boarded at Reminitsky's, and after supper was over, Hal sought\nhim out. He was easy to know, and proved an interesting acquaintance.\nWith the help of his eloquence Hal wandered through a score of camps in\nthe district. The old fellow had a temper that he could not manage, and\nso he was always on the move; but all places were alike, he said--there\nwas always some trick by which a miner was cheated of his earnings. A\nminer was a little business man, a contractor who took a certain job,\nwith its expenses and its chance of profit or loss. A \"place\" was\nassigned to him by the boss--and he undertook to get out the coal from\nit, being paid at the rate of fifty-five cents a ton for each ton of\nclean coal. In some \"places\" a man could earn good money, and in others\nhe would work for weeks, and not be able to keep up with his\nstore-account.\n\nIt all depended upon the amount of rock and slate that was found with\nthe coal. If the vein was low, the man had one or two feet of rock to\ntake off the ceiling, and this had to be loaded on separate cars and\ntaken away. This work was called \"brushing,\" and for it the miner\nreceived no pay. Or perhaps it was necessary to cut through a new\npassage, and clean out the rock; or perhaps to \"grade the bottom,\" and\nlay the ties and rails over which the cars were brought in to be loaded;\nor perhaps the vein ran into a \"fault,\" a broken place where there was\nrock instead of coal--and this rock must be hewed away before the miner\ncould get at the coal. All such work was called \"dead-work,\" and it was\nthe cause of unceasing war. In the old days the company had paid extra\nfor it; now, since they had got the upper hand of the men, they were\nrefusing to pay. And so it was important to the miner to have a \"place\"\nassigned him where there was not so much of this dead work. And the\n\"place\" a man got depended upon the boss; so here, at the very outset,\nwas endless opportunity for favouritism and graft, for quarrelling, or\n\"keeping in\" with the boss. What chance did a man stand who was poor and\nold and ugly, and could not speak English good? inquired old Mike, with\nbitterness. The boss stole his cars and gave them to other people; he\ntook the weight off the cars, and gave them to fellows who boarded with\nhim, or treated him to drinks, or otherwise curried favour with him.\n\n\"I work five days in the Southeastern,\" said Mike, \"and when I work them\nfive days, so help me God, brother, if I don't get up out of this chair,\nfifteen cents I was still in the hole yet. Fourteen inches of rock! And\nthe Mr. Bishop--that is the superintendent--I says, 'Do you pay\nsomething for that rock?' 'Huh?' says he. 'Well,' I says, 'if you don't\npay nothing for the rock, I don't go ahead with it. I ain't got no place\nto put that rock.' 'Get the hell out of here,' says he, and when I\nstarted to fight he pull gun on me. And then I go to Cedar Mountain, and\nthe super give me work there, and he says, 'You go Number Four,' and he\nsays, 'Rail is in Number Three, and the ties.' And he says, 'I pay you\nfor it when you put it in.' So I take it away and I put it in, and I\nwork till twelve o'clock. Carried the three pair of rails and the ties,\nand I pulled all the spikes--\"\n\n\"Pulled the spikes?\" asked Hal.\n\n\"Got no good spikes. Got to use old spikes, what you pull out of them\nold ties. So then I says, 'What is my half day, what you promise me?'\nSays he, 'You ain't dug no coal yet!' 'But, mister,' says I, 'you\npromise me pay to pull them spikes and put in them ties!' Says he,\n'Company pay nothin' for dead work--you know that,' says he, and that is\nall the satisfaction I get.\"\n\n\"And you didn't get your half day's pay?\"\n\n\"Sure I get nothin'. Boss do just as he please in coal mine.\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 16.\n\nThere was another way, Old Mike explained, in which the miner was at the\nmercy of others; this was the matter of stealing cars. Each miner had\nbrass checks with his number on them, and when he sent up a loaded car,\nhe hung one of these checks on a hook inside. In the course of the long\njourney to the tipple, some one would change the check, and the car was\ngone. In some mines, the number was put on the car with chalk; and how\neasy it was for some one to rub it out and change it! It appeared to Hal\nthat it would have been a simple matter to put a number padlock on the\ncar, instead of a check; but such an equipment would have cost the\ncompany one or two hundred dollars, he was told, and so the stealing\nwent on year after year.\n\n\"You think it's the bosses steal these cars?\" asked Hal.\n\n\"Sometimes bosses, sometimes bosses' friend--sometimes company himself\nsteal them from miners.\" In North Valley it was the company, the old\nSlovak insisted. It was no use sending up more than six cars in one day,\nhe declared; you could never get credit for more than six. Nor was it\nworth while loading more than a ton on a car; they did not really weigh\nthe cars, the boss just ran them quickly over the scales, and had orders\nnot to go above a certain average. Mike told of an Italian who had\nloaded a car for a test, so high that he could barely pass it under the\nroof of the entry, and went up on the tipple and saw it weighed himself,\nand it was sixty-five hundred pounds. They gave him thirty-five hundred,\nand when he started to fight, they arrested him. Mike had not seen him\narrested, but when he had come out of the mine, the man was gone, and\nnobody ever saw him again. After that they put a door onto the\nweigh-room, so that no one could see the scales.\n\nThe more Hal listened to the men and reflected upon these things, the\nmore he came to see that the miner was a contractor who had no\nopportunity to determine the size of the contract before he took it on,\nnor afterwards to determine how much work he had done. More than that,\nhe was obliged to use supplies, over the price and measurements of which\nhe had no control. He used powder, and would find himself docked at the\nend of the month for a certain quantity, and if the quantity was wrong,\nhe would have no redress. He was charged a certain sum for\n\"black-smithing\"--the keeping of his tools in order; and he would find a\ndollar or two deducted from his account each month, even though he had\nnot been near the blacksmith shop.\n\nLet any business-man in the world consider the proposition, thought Hal,\nand say if he would take a contract upon such terms! Would a man\nundertake to build a dam, for example, with no chance to measure the\nground in advance, nor any way of determining how many cubic yards of\nconcrete he had to put in? Would a grocer sell to a customer who\nproposed to come into the store and do his own weighing--and meantime\nlocking the grocer outside? Merely to put such questions was to show the\npreposterousness of the thing; yet in this district were fifteen\nthousand men working on precisely such terms.\n\nUnder the state law, the miner had a right to demand a check-weighman to\nprotect his interest at the scales, paying this check-weighman's wages\nout of his own earnings. Whenever there was any public criticism about\nconditions in the coal-mines, this law would be triumphantly cited by\nthe operators; and one had to have actual experience in order to realise\nwhat a bitter mockery this was to the miner.\n\nIn the dining-room Hal sat next to a fair-haired Swedish giant named\nJohannson, who loaded timbers ten hours a day. This fellow was one who\nindulged in the luxury of speaking his mind, because he had youth and\nhuge muscles, and no family to tie him down. He was what is called a\n\"blanket-stiff,\" wandering from mine to harvest-field and from\nharvest-field to lumber-camp. Some one broached the subject of\ncheck-weighmen to him, and the whole table heard his scornful laugh. Let\nany man ask for a check-weighman!\n\n\"You mean they would fire him?\" asked Hal.\n\n\"Maybe!\" was the answer. \"Maybe they make him fire himself.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"They make his life one damn misery till he go.\"\n\nSo it was with check-weighman--as with scrip, and with company stores,\nand with all the provisions of the law to protect the miner against\naccidents. You might demand your legal rights, but if you did, it was a\nmatter of the boss's temper. He might make your life one damn misery\ntill you went of your own accord. Or you might get a string of curses\nand an order, \"Down the canyon!\"--and likely as not the toe of a boot in\nyour trouser-seat, or the muzzle of a revolver under your nose.\n\n\n\nSECTION 17.\n\nSuch conditions made the coal-district a place of despair. Yet there\nwere men who managed to get along somehow, and to raise families and\nkeep decent homes. If one had the luck to escape accident, if he did not\nmarry too young, or did not have too many children; if he could manage\nto escape the temptations of liquor, to which overwork and monotony\ndrove so many; if, above all, he could keep on the right side of his\nboss--why then he might have a home, and even a little money on deposit\nwith the company.\n\nSuch a one was Jerry Minetti, who became one of Hal's best friends. He\nwas a Milanese, and his name was Gerolamo, which had become Jerry in the\n\"melting-pot.\" He was about twenty-five years of age, and what is\nunusual with the Italians, was of good stature. Their meeting took\nplace--as did most of Hal's social experiences--on a Sunday. Jerry had\njust had a sleep and a wash, and had put on a pair of new blue overalls,\nso that he presented a cheering aspect in the sunlight. He walked with\nhis head up and his shoulders square, and one could see that he had few\ncares in the world.\n\nBut what caught Hal's attention was not so much Jerry as what followed\nat Jerry's heels; a perfect reproduction of him, quarter-size, also with\na newly-washed face and a pair of new blue overalls. He too had his head\nup, and his shoulders square, and he was an irresistible object,\nthrowing out his heels and trying his best to keep step. Since the\nlongest strides he could take left him behind, he would break into a\nrun, and getting close under his father's heels, would begin keeping\nstep once more.\n\nHal was going in the same direction, and it affected him like the music\nof a military band; he too wanted to throw his head up and square his\nshoulders and keep step. And then other people, seeing the grin on his\nface, would turn and watch, and grin also. But Jerry walked on gravely,\nunaware of this circus in the rear.\n\nThey went into a house; and Hal, having nothing to do but enjoy life,\nstood waiting for them to come out. They returned in the same\nprocession, only now the man had a sack of something on his shoulder,\nwhile the little chap had a smaller load poised in imitation. So Hal\ngrinned again, and when they were opposite him, he said, \"Hello.\"\n\n\"Hello,\" said Jerry, and stopped. Then, seeing Hal's grin, he grinned\nback; and Hal looked at the little chap and grinned, and the little chap\ngrinned back. Jerry, seeing what Hal was grinning at, grinned more than\never; so there stood all three in the middle of the road, grinning at\none another for no apparent reason.\n\n\"Gee, but that's a great kid!\" said Hal.\n\n\"Gee, you bet!\" said Jerry; and he set down his sack. If some one\ndesired to admire the kid, he was willing to stop any length of time.\n\n\"Yours?\" asked Hal.\n\n\"You bet!\" said Jerry, again.\n\n\"Hello, Buster!\" said Hal.\n\n\"Hello yourself!\" said the kid. One could see in a moment that he had\nbeen in the \"melting-pot.\"\n\n\"What's your name?\" asked Hal.\n\n\"Jerry,\" was the reply.\n\n\"And what's his name?\" Hal nodded towards the man--\n\n\"Big Jerry.\"\n\n\"Got any more like you at home?\"\n\n\"One more,\" said Big Jerry. \"Baby.\"\n\n\"He ain't like me,\" said Little Jerry. \"He's little.\"\n\n\"And you're big?\" said Hal.\n\n\"He can't walk!\"\n\n\"Neither can you walk!\" laughed Hal, and caught him up and slung him\nonto his shoulder. \"Come on, we'll ride!\"\n\nSo Big Jerry took up his sack again, and they started off; only this\ntime it was Hal who fell behind and kept step, squaring his shoulders\nand flinging out his heels. Little Jerry caught onto the joke, and\ngiggled and kicked his sturdy legs with delight. Big Jerry would look\nround, not knowing what the joke was, but enjoying it just the same.\n\nThey came to the three-room cabin which was Both Jerrys' home; and Mrs.\nJerry came to the door, a black-eyed Sicilian girl, who did not look old\nenough to have even one baby. They had another bout of grinning, at the\nend of which Big Jerry said, \"You come in?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Hal.\n\n\"You stay supper,\" added the other. \"Got spaghetti.\"\n\n\"Gee!\" said Hal. \"All right, let me stay, and pay for it.\"\n\n\"Hell, no!\" said Jerry. \"You no pay!\"\n\n\"No! No pay!\" cried Mrs. Jerry, shaking her pretty head energetically.\n\n\"All right,\" said Hal, quickly, seeing that he might hurt their\nfeelings. \"I'll stay if you're sure you have enough.\"\n\n\"Sure, plenty!\" said Jerry. \"Hey, Rosa?\"\n\n\"Sure, plenty!\" said Mrs. Jerry.\n\n\"Then I'll stay,\" said Hal. \"You like spaghetti, Kid?\"\n\n\"Jesus!\" cried Little Jerry.\n\nHal looked about him at this Dago home. It was a tome in keeping with\nits pretty occupant. There were lace curtains in the windows, even\nshinier and whiter than at the Rafferties; there was an incredibly\nbright-coloured rug on the floor, and bright coloured pictures of Mount\nVesuvius and of Garibaldi on the walls. Also there was a cabinet with\nmany interesting treasures to look at--a bit of coral and a conch-shell,\na shark's tooth and an Indian arrow-head, and a stuffed linnet with a\nglass cover over him. A while back Hal would not have thought of such\nthings as especially stimulating to the imagination; but that was before\nhe had begun to spend five-sixths of his waking hours in the bowels of\nthe earth.\n\nHe ate supper, a real Dago supper; the spaghetti proved to be real Dago\nspaghetti, smoking hot, with tomato sauce and a rich flavour of\nmeat-juice. And all through the meal Hal smacked his lips and grinned at\nLittle Jerry, who smacked his lips and grinned back. It was all so\ndifferent from feeding at Reminitsky's pig-trough, that Hal thought he\nhad never had such a good supper in his life before. As for Mr. and Mrs.\nJerry, they were so proud of their wonderful kid, who could swear in\nEnglish as good as a real American, that they were in the seventh\nheaven.\n\nWhen the meal was over, Hal leaned back and exclaimed, just as he had at\nthe Rafferties', \"Lord, how I wish I could board here!\"\n\nHe saw his host look at his wife. \"All right,\" said he. \"You come here.\nI board you. Hey, Rosa?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Rosa.\n\nHal looked at them, astonished. \"You're sure they'll let you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Let me? Who stop me?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Maybe Reminitsky. You might get into trouble.\"\n\nJerry grinned. \"I no fraid,\" said he. \"Got friends here. Carmino my\ncousin. You know Carmino?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Hal.\n\n\"Pit-boss in Number One. He stand by me. Old Reminitsky go hang! You\ncome here, I give you bunk in that room, give you good grub. What you\npay Reminitsky?\"\n\n\"Twenty-seven a month.\"\n\n\"All right, you pay me twenty-seven, you get everything good. Can't get\nmuch stuff here, but Rosa good cook, she fix it.\"\n\nHal's new friend--besides being a favourite of the boss--was a\n\"shot-firer\"; it was his duty to go about the mine at night, setting off\nthe charges of powder which the miners had got ready by day. This was\ndangerous work, calling for a skilled man, and it paid pretty well; so\nJerry got on in the world and was not afraid to speak his mind, within\ncertain limits. He ignored the possibility that Hal might be a company\nspy, and astonished him by rebellious talk of the different kinds of\ngraft in North Valley, and at other places he had worked since coming to\nAmerica as a boy. Minetti was a Socialist, Hal learned; he took an\nItalian Socialist paper, and the clerk at the post-office knew what sort\nof paper it was, and would \"josh\" him about it. What was more\nremarkable, Mrs. Minetti was a Socialist also; that meant a great deal\nto a man, as Jerry explained, because she was not under the domination\nof a priest.\n\n\n\nSECTION 18.\n\nHal made the move at once, sacrificing part of a month's board, which\nReminitsky would charge against his account with the company. But he was\nwilling to pay for the privilege of a clean home and clean food. To his\namusement he found that in the eyes of his Irish friends he was losing\ncaste by going to live with the Minettis. There were most rigid social\nlines in North Valley, it appeared. The Americans and English and Scotch\nlooked down upon the Welsh and Irish; the Welsh and Irish looked down\nupon the Dagoes and Frenchies; the Dagoes and Frenchies looked down upon\nPolacks and Hunkies, these in turn upon Greeks, Bulgarians and\n\"Montynegroes,\" and so on through a score of races of Eastern Europe,\nLithuanians, Slovaks, and Croatians, Armenians, Roumanians, Rumelians,\nRuthenians--ending up with Greasers, niggers, and last and lowest, Japs.\n\nIt was when Hal went to pay another call upon the Rafferties that he\nmade this discovery. Mary Burke happened to be there, and when she\ncaught sight of him, her grey eyes beamed with mischief. \"How do ye do,\nMr. Minetti?\" she cried.\n\n\"How do ye do, Miss Rosetti?\" he countered.\n\n\"You lika da spagett?\"\n\n\"You no lika da spagett?\"\n\n\"I told ye once,\" laughed the girl--\"the good old pertaties is good\nenough for me!\"\n\n\"And you remember,\" said he, \"what I answered?\"\n\nYes, she remembered! Her cheeks took on the colour of the rose-leaves he\nhad specified as her probable diet.\n\nAnd then the Rafferty children, who had got to know Hal well, joined in\nthe teasing. \"Mister Minetti! Lika da spagetti!\" Hal, when he had\ngrasped the situation, was tempted to retaliate by reminding them that\nhe had offered to board with the Irish, and been turned down; but he\nfeared that the elder Rafferty might not appreciate this joke, so\ninstead he pretended to have supposed all along that the Rafferties were\nItalians. He addressed the elder Rafferty gravely, pronouncing the name\nwith the accent on the second syllable--\"Signer Rafferti\"; and this so\namused the old man that he chuckled over it at intervals for an hour.\nHis heart warmed to this lively young fellow; he forgot some of his\nsuspicions, and after the youngsters had been sent away to bed, he\ntalked more or less frankly about his life as a coal-miner.\n\n\"Old Rafferty\" had once been on the way to high station. He had been\nmade tipple-boss at the San Jos\u00c3\u00a9 mine, but had given up his job because\nhe had thought that his religion did not permit him to do what he was\nordered to do. It had been a crude proposition of keeping the men's\nscore at a certain level, no matter how much coal they might send up;\nand when Rafferty had quit rather than obey such orders, he had had to\nleave the mine altogether; for of course everybody knew why he had quit,\nand his mere presence had the effect of keeping discontent alive.\n\n\"You think there are no honest companies at all?\" Hal asked.\n\nThe old man answered, \"There be some, but 'tis not so easy as ye might\nthink to be honest. They have to meet each other's prices, and when one\nshort-weights, the others have to. 'Tis a way of cuttin' wages without\nthe men findin' it out; and there be people that do not like to fall\nbehind with their profits.\" Hal found himself thinking of old Peter\nHarrigan, who controlled the General Fuel Company, and had made the\nremark: \"I am a great clamourer for dividends!\"\n\n\"The trouble with the miner,\" continued Old Rafferty, \"is that he has no\none to speak for him. He stands alone--\"\n\nDuring this discourse, Hal had glanced at \"Red Mary,\" and noticed that\nshe sat with her arms on the table, her sturdy shoulders bowed in a\nfashion which told of a hard day's toil. But here she broke into the\nconversation; her voice came suddenly, alive with scorn: \"The trouble\nwith the miner is that he's a _slave!_\"\n\n\"Ah, now--\" put in the old man, protestingly.\n\n\"He has the whole world against him, and he hasn't got the sense to get\ntogether--to form a union, and stand by it!\"\n\nThere fell a sudden silence in the Rafferty home. Even Hal was\nstartled--for this was the first time during his stay in the camp that\nhe had heard the dread word \"union\" spoken above a whisper.\n\n\"I know!\" said Mary, her grey eyes full of defiance. \"Ye'll not have the\nword spoken! But some will speak it in spite of ye!\"\n\n\"'Tis all very well,\" said the old man. \"When ye're young, and a woman\ntoo--\"\n\n\"A woman! Is it only the women that can have courage?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said he, with a wry smile, \"'tis the women that have the\ntongues, and that can't he stopped from usin' them. Even the boss must\nknow that.\"\n\n\"Maybe so,\" replied Mary. \"And maybe 'tis the women have the most to\nsuffer in a coal-camp; and maybe the boss knows that.\" The girl's cheeks\nwere red.\n\n\"Mebbe so,\" said Rafferty; and after that there was silence, while he\nsat puffing his pipe. It was evident that he did not care to go on, that\nhe did not want union speeches made in his home. After a while Mrs.\nRafferty made a timid effort to change the course of the talk, by asking\nafter Mary's sister, who had not been well; and after they had discussed\nremedies for the ailments of children, Mary rose, saying, \"I'll be goin'\nalong.\"\n\nHal rose also. \"I'll walk with you, if I may,\" he said.\n\n\"Sure,\" said she; and it seemed that the cheerfulness of the Rafferty\nfamily was restored by the sight of a bit of gallantry.\n\n\n\nSECTION 19.\n\nThey strolled down the street, and Hal remarked, \"That's the first word\nI've heard here about a union.\"\n\nMary looked about her nervously. \"Hush!\" she whispered.\n\n\"But I thought you said you were talking about it!\"\n\nShe answered, \"'Tis one thing, talkin' in a friend's house, and another\noutside. What's the good of throwin' away your job?\"\n\nHe lowered his voice. \"Would you seriously like to have a union here?\"\n\n\"Seriously?\" said she. \"Didn't ye see Mr. Rafferty--what a coward he is?\nThat's the way they are! No, 'twas just a burst of my temper. I'm a bit\ncrazy to-night--something happened to set me off.\"\n\nHe thought she was going on, but apparently she changed her mind.\nFinally he asked, \"What happened?\"\n\n\"Oh, 'twould do no good to talk,\" she answered; and they walked a bit\nfarther in silence.\n\n\"Tell me about it, won't you?\" he said; and the kindness in his tone\nmade its impression.\n\n\"'Tis not much ye know of a coal-camp, Joe Smith,\" she said. \"Can't ye\nimagine what it's like--bein' a woman in a place like this? And a woman\nthey think good-lookin'!\"\n\n\"Oh, so it's that!\" said he, and was silent again. \"Some one's been\ntroubling you?\" he ventured after a while.\n\n\"Sure! Some one's always troublin' us women! Always! Never a day but we\nhear it. Winks and nudges--everywhere ye turn.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\"\n\n\"The bosses, the clerks--anybody that has a chance to wear a stiff\ncollar, and thinks he can offer money to a girl. It begins before she's\nout of short skirts, and there's never any peace afterwards.\"\n\n\"And you can't make them understand?\"\n\n\"I've made them understand me a bit; now they go after my old man.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Sure! D'ye suppose they'd not try that? Him that's so crazy for liquor,\nand can never get enough of it!\"\n\n\"And your father?--\" But Hal stopped. She would not want that question\nasked!\n\nShe had seen his hesitation, however. \"He was a decent man once,\" she\ndeclared. \"'Tis the life here, that turns a man into a coward. 'Tis\neverything ye need, everywhere ye turn--ye have to ask favours from some\nboss. The room ye work in, the dead work they pile on ye; or maybe 'tis\nmore credit ye need at the store, or maybe the doctor to come when ye're\nsick. Just now 'tis our roof that leaks--so bad we can't find a dry\nplace to sleep when it rains.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Hal. \"Who owns the house?\"\n\n\"Sure, there's none but company houses here.\"\n\n\"Who's supposed to fix it?\"\n\n\"Mr. Kosegi, the house-agent. But we gave him up long ago--if he does\nanything, he raises the rent. Today my father went to Mr. Cotton. He's\nsupposed to look out for the health of the place, and it seems hardly\nhealthy to keep people wet in their beds.\"\n\n\"And what did Cotton say?\" asked Hal, when she stopped again.\n\n\"Well, don't ye know Jeff Cotton--can't ye guess what he'd say? 'That's\na fine girl ye got, Burke! Why don't ye make her listen to reason?' And\nthen he laughed, and told me old father he'd better learn to take a\nhint. 'Twas bad for an old man to sleep in the rain--he might get\ncarried off by pneumonia.\"\n\nHal could no longer keep back the question, \"What did your father do?\"\n\n\"I'd not have ye think hard of my old father,\" she said, quickly. \"He\nused to be a fightin' man, in the days before O'Callahan had his way\nwith him. But now he knows what a camp-marshal can do to a miner!\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 20.\n\nMary Burke had said that the company could stand breaking the bones of\nits men; and not long after Number Two started up again, Hal had a\nchance to note the truth of this assertion.\n\nA miner's life depended upon the proper timbering of the room where he\nworked. The company undertook to furnish the timbers, but when the miner\nneeded them, he would find none at hand, and would have to make the\nmile-long trip to the surface. He would select timbers of the proper\nlength, and would mark them--the understanding being that they were to\nbe delivered to his room by some of the labourers. But then some one\nelse would carry them off--here was more graft and favouritism, and the\nminer might lose a day or two of work, while meantime his account was\npiling up at the store, and his children might have no shoes to go to\nschool. Sometimes he would give up waiting for timbers, and go on taking\nout coal; so there would be a fall of rock--and the coroner's jury would\nbring in a verdict of \"negligence,\" and the coal-operators would talk\nsolemnly about the impossibility of teaching caution to miners. Not so\nvery long ago Hal had read an interview which the president of the\nGeneral Fuel Company had given to a newspaper, in which he set forth the\nidea that the more experience a miner had the more dangerous it was to\nemploy him, because he thought he knew it all, and would not heed the\nwise regulations which the company laid down for his safety!\n\nIn Number Two mine there were some places being operated by the \"room\nand pillar\" method; the coal being taken out as from a series of rooms,\nthe portion corresponding to the walls of the rooms being left to uphold\nthe roof. These walls are the \"pillars\"; and when the end of the vein is\nreached, the miner begins to work backwards, \"pulling the pillars,\" and\nletting the roof collapse behind him. This is a dangerous task; as he\nworks, the man has to listen to the drumming sounds of the rock above\nhis head, and has to judge just when to make his escape. Sometimes he is\ntoo anxious to save a tool; or sometimes the collapse comes without\nwarning. In that case the victim is seldom dug out; for it must be\nadmitted that a man buried under a mountain is as well buried as a\ncompany could be expected to arrange it.\n\nIn Number Two mine a man was caught in this way. He stumbled as he ran,\nand the lower half of his body was pinned fast; the doctor had to come\nand pump opiates into him, while the rescue crew was digging him loose.\nThe first Hal knew of the accident was when he saw the body stretched\nout on a plank, with a couple of old sacks to cover it. He noticed that\nnobody stopped for a second glance. Going up from work, he asked his\nfriend Madvik, the mule driver, who answered, \"Lit'uanian feller--got\nmash.\" And that was all. Nobody knew him, and nobody cared about him.\n\nIt happened that Mike Sikoria had been working nearby, and was one of\nthose who helped to get the victim out. Mike's negro \"buddy\" had been in\ntoo great haste to get some of the rock out of the way, and had got his\nhand crushed, and would not be able to work for a month or so. Mike told\nHal about it, in his broken English. It was a terrible thing to see a\nman trapped like that, gasping, his eyes almost popping out of his head.\nFortunately he was a young fellow, and had no family.\n\nHal asked what they would do with the body; the answer was they would\nbury him in the morning. The company had a piece of ground up the\ncanyon.\n\n\"But won't they have an inquest?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Inques'?\" repeated the other. \"What's he?\"\n\n\"Doesn't the coroner see the body?\"\n\nThe old Slovak shrugged his bowed shoulders; if there was a coroner in\nthis part of the world, he had never heard of it; and he had worked in a\ngood many mines, and seen a good many men put under the ground. \"Put him\nin a box and dig a hole,\" was the way he described the procedure.\n\n\"And doesn't the priest come?\"\n\n\"Priest too far away.\"\n\nAfterwards Hal made inquiry among the English-speaking men, and learned\nthat the coroner did sometimes come to the camp. He would empanel a jury\nconsisting of Jeff Cotton, the marshal, and Predovich, the Galician Jew\nwho worked in the company store, and a clerk or two from the company's\noffice, and a couple of Mexican labourers who had no idea what it was\nall about. This jury would view the corpse, and ask a couple of men what\nhad happened, and then bring in a verdict: \"We find that the deceased\nmet his death from a fall of rock caused by his own fault.\" (In one case\nthey had added the picturesque detail: \"No relatives, and damned few\nfriends!\")\n\nFor this service the coroner got a fee, and the company got an official\nverdict, which would be final in case some foreign consul should\nthreaten a damage suit. So well did they have matters in hand that\nnobody in North Valley had ever got anything for death or injury; in\nfact, as Hal found later, there had not been a damage suit filed against\nany coal-operator in that county for twenty-three years!\n\nThis particular, accident was of consequence to Hal, because it got him\na chance to see the real work of mining. Old Mike was without a helper,\nand made the proposition that Hal should take the job. It was better\nthan a stableman's, for it paid two dollars a day.\n\n\"But will the boss let me change?\" asked Hal.\n\n\"You give him ten dollar, he change you,\" said Mike.\n\n\"Sorry,\" said Hal, \"I haven't got ten dollars.\"\n\n\"You give him ten dollar credit,\" said the other.\n\nAnd Hal laughed. \"They take scrip for graft, do they?\"\n\n\"Sure they take him,\" said Mike.\n\n\"Suppose I treat my mules bad?\" continued the other. \"So I can make him\nchange me for nothing!\"\n\n\"He change you to hell!\" replied Mike. \"You get him cross, he put us in\nbad room, cost us ten dollar a week. No, sir--you give him drink, say\nfine feller, make him feel good. You talk American--give him jolly!\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 21.\n\nHal was glad of this opportunity to get better acquainted with his\npit-boss. Alec Stone was six feet high, and built in proportion, with\narms like hams--soft with fat, yet possessed of enormous strength. He\nhad learned his manner of handling men on a sugar-plantation in\nLouisiana--a fact which, when Hal heard it, explained much. Like a\nstage-manager who does not heed the real names of his actors, but calls\nthem by their character-names, Stone had the habit of addressing his men\nby their nationalities: \"You, Polack, get that rock into the car! Hey,\nJap, bring them tools over here! Shut your mouth, now, Dago, and get to\nwork, or I'll kick the breeches off you, sure as you're alive!\"\n\nHal had witnessed one occasion when there was a dispute as to whose duty\nit was to move timbers. There was a great two-handled cross-cut saw\nlying on the ground, and Stone seized it and began to wave it, like a\nmighty broadsword, in the face of a little Bohemian miner. \"Load them\ntimbers, Hunkie, or I'll carve you into bits!\" And as the terrified man\nshrunk back, he followed, until his victim was flat against a wall, the\nweapon swinging to and fro under his nose after the fashion of \"The Pit\nand the Pendulum.\" \"Carve you into pieces, Hunkie! Carve you into\nstew-meat!\" When at last the boss stepped back, the little Bohemian\nleaped to load the timbers.\n\nThe curious part about it to Hal was that Stone seemed to be reasonably\ngood-natured about such proceedings. Hardly one time in a thousand did\nhe carry out his bloodthirsty threats, and like as not he would laugh\nwhen he had finished his tirade, and the object of it would grin in\nturn--but without slackening his frightened efforts. After the\nbroad-sword waving episode, seeing that Hal had been watching, the boss\nremarked, \"That's the way you have to manage them wops.\" Hal took this\nremark as a tribute to his American blood, and was duly flattered.\n\nHe sought out the boss that evening, and found him with his feet upon\nthe railing of his home. \"Mr. Stone,\" said he, \"I've something I'd like\nto ask you.\"\n\n\"Fire away, kid,\" said the other.\n\n\"Won't you come up to the saloon and have a drink?\"\n\n\"Want to get something out of me, hey? You can't work me, kid!\" But\nnevertheless he slung down his feet from the railing, and knocked the\nashes out of his pipe and strolled up the street with Hal.\n\n\"Mr. Stone,\" said Hal, \"I want to make a change.\"\n\n\"What's that? Got a grouch on them mules?\"\n\n\"No, sir, but I got a better job in sight. Mike Sikoria's buddy is laid\nup, and I'd like to take his place, if you're willing.\"\n\n\"Why, that's a nigger's place, kid. Ain't you scared to take a nigger's\nplace?\"\n\n\"Why, sir?\"\n\n\"Don't you know about hoodoos?\"\n\n\"What I want,\" said Hal, \"is the nigger's pay.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the boss, abruptly, \"you stick by them mules. I got a good\nstableman, and I don't want to spoil him. You stick, and by and by I'll\ngive you a raise. You go into them pits, the first thing you know you'll\nget a fall of rock on your head, and the nigger's pay won't be no good\nto you.\"\n\nThey came to the saloon and entered. Hal noted that a silence fell\nwithin, and every one nodded and watched. It was pleasant to be seen\ngoing out with one's boss.\n\nO'Callahan, the proprietor, came forward with his best society smile and\njoined them, and at Hal's invitation they ordered whiskies. \"No, you\nstick to your job,\" continued the pit-boss. \"You stay by it, and when\nyou've learned to manage mules, I'll make a boss out of you, and let you\nmanage men.\"\n\nSome of the bystanders tittered. The pit-boss poured down his whiskey,\nand set the glass on the bar. \"That's no joke,\" said he, in a tone that\nevery one could hear. \"I learned that long ago about niggers. They'd say\nto me, 'For God's sake, don't talk to our niggers like that. Some night\nyou'll have your house set afire.' But I said, 'Pet a nigger, and you've\ngot a spoiled nigger.' I'd say, 'Nigger, don't you give me any of your\nimp, or I'll kick the breeches off you.' And they knew I was a\ngentleman, and they stepped lively.\"\n\n\"Have another drink,\" said Hal.\n\nThe pit-boss drank, and becoming more sociable, told nigger stories. On\nthe sugar-plantations there was a rush season, when the rule was twenty\nhours' work a day; when some of the niggers tried to shirk it, they\nwould arrest them for swearing or crap-shooting, and work them as\nconvicts, without pay. The pit-boss told how one \"buck\" had been brought\nbefore the justice of the peace, and the charge read, \"being\ncross-eyed\"; for which offence he had been sentenced to sixty days' hard\nlabour. This anecdote was enjoyed by the men in the saloon--whose\nrace-feelings seemed to be stronger than their class-feelings.\n\nWhen the pair went out again, it was late, and the boss was cordial.\n\"Mr. Stone,\" began Hal, \"I don't want to bother you, but I'd like first\nrate to get more pay. If you could see your way to let me have that\nbuddy's job, I'd be more than glad to divide with you.\"\n\n\"Divide with me?\" said Stone. \"How d'ye mean?\" Hal waited with some\napprehension--for if Mike had not assured him so positively, he would\nhave expected a swing from the pit-boss's mighty arm.\n\n\"It's worth about fifteen a month more to me. I haven't any cash, but if\nyou'd be willing to charge off ten dollars from my store-account, it\nwould be well worth my while.\"\n\nThey walked for a short way in silence. \"Well, I'll tell you,\" said the\nboss, at last; \"that old Slovak is a kicker--one of these fellows that\nthinks he could run the mine if he had a chance. And if you get to\nlistenin' to him, and think you can come to me and grumble, by God--\"\n\n\"That's all right, sir,\" put in Hal, quickly. \"I'll manage that for\nyou--I'll shut him up. If you'd like me to, I'll see what fellows he\ntalks with, and if any of them are trying to make trouble, I'll tip you\noff.\"\n\n\"Now that's the talk,\" said the boss, promptly. \"You do that, and I'll\nkeep my eye on you and give you a chance. Not that I'm afraid of the old\nfellow--I told him last time that if I heard from him again, I'd kick\nthe breeches off him. But when you got half a thousand of this foreign\nscum, some of them Anarchists, and some of them Bulgars and Montynegroes\nthat's been fightin' each other at home--\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Hal. \"You have to watch 'em.\"\n\n\"That's it,\" said the pit-boss. \"And by the way, when you tell the\nstore-clerk about that fifteen dollars, just say you lost it at poker.\"\n\n\"I said ten dollars,\" put in Hal, quickly.\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" responded the other. \"But _I_ said fifteen!\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 22.\n\nHal told himself with satisfaction that he was now to do the real work\nof coal-mining. His imagination had been occupied with it for a long\ntime; but as so often happens in the life of man, the first contact with\nreality killed the results of many years' imagining. It killed all\nimagining, in fact; Hal found that his entire stock of energy, both\nmental and physical, was consumed in enduring torment. If any one had\ntold him the horror of attempting to work in a room five feet high, he\nwould not have believed it. It was like some of the dreadful devices of\ntorture which one saw in European castles, the \"iron maiden\" and the\n\"spiked collar.\" Hal's back burned as if hot irons were being run up and\ndown it; every separate joint and muscle cried aloud. It seemed as if he\ncould never learn the lesson of the jagged ceiling above his head--he\nbumped it and continued to bump it, until his scalp was a mass of cuts\nand bruises, and his head ached till he was nearly blind, and he would\nhave to throw himself flat on the ground.\n\nThen old Mike Sikoria would grin. \"I know. Like green mule! Some day get\ntough!\"\n\nHal recalled the great thick callouses on the flanks of his former\ncharges, where the harness rubbed against them. \"Yes, I'm a 'green\nmule,' all right!\"\n\nIt was amazing how many ways there were to bruise and tear one's\nfingers, loading lumps of coal into a car. He put on a pair of gloves,\nbut these wore through in a day. And then the gas, and the smoke of\npowder, stifling one; and the terrible burning of the eyes, from the\ndust and the feeble light. There was no way to rub these burning eyes,\nbecause everything about one was equally dusty. Could anybody have\nimagined the torment of that--any of those ladies who rode in softly\nupholstered parlour-cars, or reclined upon the decks of steam-ships in\ngleaming tropic seas?\n\nOld Mike was good to his new \"buddy.\" Mike's spine was bent and his\nhands were hardened by forty years of this sort of toil, so he could do\nthe work of two men, and entertain his friend with comments into the\nbargain. The old fellow had the habit of talking all the time, like a\nchild; he would talk to his helper, to himself, to his tools. He would\ncall these tools by obscene and terrifying names--but with entire\nfriendliness and good humour. \"Get in there, you son-of-a-gun!\" he would\nsay to his pick. \"Come along here, you wop!\" he would say to his car.\n\"In with you, now, you old buster!\" he would say to a lump of coal. And\nhe would lecture Hal on the details of mining. He would tell stories of\nsuccessful days, or of terrible mishaps. Above all he would tell about\nrascality--cursing the \"G. F. C.,\" its foremen and superintendents, its\nofficials, directors and stock-holders, and the world which permitted\nsuch a criminal institution to exist.\n\nNoon-time would come, and Hal would lie upon his back, too worn to eat.\nOld Mike would sit munching; his abundant whiskers came to a point on\nhis chin, and as his jaws moved, he looked for all the world like an\naged billy-goat. He was a kind-hearted and anxious old billy-goat, and\nsought to tempt his buddy with a bit of cheese or a swig of cold coffee.\nHe believed in eating--no man could keep up steam if he did not stoke\nthe furnace. Failing in this, he would try to divert Hal's mind, telling\nstories of mining-life in America and Russia. He was most proud to have\nan \"American feller\" for a buddy, and tried to make the work as easy as\npossible, for fear lest Hal might quit.\n\nHal did not quit; but he would drag himself out towards night, so\nexhausted that he would fall asleep in the cage. He would fall asleep at\nsupper, and go in and sink down on his cot and sleep like a log. And oh,\nthe torture of being routed out before daybreak! Having to shake the\nsleep out of his head, and move his creaking joints, and become aware of\nthe burning in his eyes, and the blisters and sores on his hands!\n\nIt was a week before he had a moment that was not pain; and he never got\nfully used to the labour. It was impossible for any one to work so hard\nand keep his mental alertness, his eagerness and sensitiveness; it was\nimpossible to work so hard and be an adventurer--to be anything, in\nfact, but a machine. Hal had heard that phrase of contempt, \"the inertia\nof the masses,\" and had wondered about it. He no longer wondered, he\nknew. Could a man be brave enough to protest to a pit-boss when his body\nwas numb with weariness? Could he think out a definite conclusion as to\nhis rights and wrongs, and back his conclusion with effective action,\nwhen his mental faculties were paralysed by such weariness of body?\n\nHal had come here, as one goes upon the deck of a ship in mid-ocean, to\nsee the storm. In this ocean of social misery, of ignorance and despair,\none saw upturned, tortured faces, writhing limbs and clutching hands; in\none's ears was a storm of lamentation, upon one's cheek a spray of blood\nand tears. Hal found himself so deep in this ocean that he could no\nlonger find consolation in the thought that he could escape whenever he\nwanted to: that he could say to himself, It is sad, it is terrible--but\nthank God, I can get out of it when I choose! I can go back into the\nwarm and well-lighted saloon and tell the other passengers how\npicturesque it is, what an interesting experience they are missing!\n\n\n\nSECTION 23.\n\nDuring these days of torment, Hal did not go to see \"Red Mary\"; but\nthen, one evening, the Minettis' baby having been sick, she came in to\nask about it, bringing what she called \"a bit of a custard\" in a bowl.\nHal was suspicious enough of the ways of men, especially of\nbusiness-men; but when it came to women he was without insight--it did\nnot occur to him as singular that an Irish girl with many troubles at\nhome should come out to nurse a Dago woman's baby. He did not reflect\nthat there were plenty of sick Irish babies in the camp, to whom Mary\nmight have taken her \"bit of a custard.\" And when he saw the surprise of\nRosa, who had never met Mary before, he took it to be the touching\ngratitude of the poor!\n\nThere are, in truth, many kinds of women, with many arts, and no man has\ntime to learn them all. Hal had observed the shop-girl type, who dress\nthemselves with many frills, and cast side-long glances, and indulge in\nfits of giggles to attract the attention of the male; he was familiar\nwith the society-girl type, who achieve the same end with more subtle\nand alluring means. But could there be a type who hold little Dago\nbabies in their laps, and call them pretty Irish names, and feed them\ncustard out of a spoon? Hal had never heard of that kind, and he thought\nthat \"Red Mary\" made a charming picture--a Celtic madonna with a\nSicilian infant in her arms.\n\nHe noticed that she was wearing the same faded blue calico-dress with a\npatch on the shoulder. Man though he was, he realised that dress is an\nimportant consideration in the lives of women. He was tempted to suspect\nthat this blue calico might be the only dress that Mary owned; but\nseeing it newly laundered every time, he concluded that she must have at\nleast one other. At any rate, here she was, crisp and fresh-looking; and\nwith the new shining costume, she had put on the long promised \"company\nmanner\": high spirits and badinage, precisely like any belle of the\nworld of luxury, who powders and bedecks herself for a ball. She had\nbeen grim and complaining in former meetings with this interesting young\nman; she had frightened him away, apparently; perhaps she could win him\nback by womanliness and good humour.\n\nShe rallied him upon his battered scalp and his creaking back, telling\nhim he looked ten years older--which he was fully prepared to believe.\nAlso she had fun with him for working under a Slovak--another loss of\ncaste, it appeared! This was a joke the Minettis could share\nin--especially Little Jerry, who liked jokes. He told Mary how Joe Smith\nhad had to pay fifteen dollars for his new job, besides several drinks\nat O'Callahan's. Also he told how Mike Sikoria had called Joe his \"green\nmule.\" Little Jerry complained about the turn of events, for in the old\ndays Joe had taught him a lot of fine new games--and now he was sore,\nand would not play them. Also, in the old days he had sung a lot of\njolly songs, full of the most fascinating rhymes. There was a song about\na \"monkey puzzle tree\"! Had Mary ever seen that kind of tree? Little\nJerry never got tired of trying to imagine what it might look like.\n\nThe Dago urchin stood and watched gravely while Mary fed the custard to\nthe baby; and when two or three spoonfuls were held out to him, he\nopened his mouth wide, and afterwards licked his lips. Gee, that was\ngood stuff!\n\nWhen the last taste was gone, he stood gazing at Mary's shining coronet.\n\"Say,\" said he, \"was your hair always like that?\"\n\nHal and Mary burst into laughter, while Rosa cried \"Hush!\" She was never\nsure what this youngster would say next.\n\n\"Sure, did ye think I painted it?\" asked Mary.\n\n\"I didn't know,\" said Little Jerry. \"It looks so nice and new.\" And he\nturned to Hal. \"Ain't it?\"\n\n\"You bet,\" said Hal, and added, \"Go on and tell her about it. Girls like\ncompliments.\"\n\n\"Compliments?\" echoed Little Jerry. \"What's that?\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Hal, \"that's when you say that her hair is like the sunrise,\nand her eyes are like twilight, or that she's a wild rose on a\nmountain-side.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the Dago urchin, somewhat doubtfully. \"Anyhow,\" he added,\n\"she make nice custard!\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 24.\n\nThe time came for Mary to take her departure, and Hal got up, wincing\nwith pain, to escort her home. She regarded him gravely, having not\nrealised before how seriously he was suffering. As they walked along she\nasked, \"Why do ye do such work, when ye don't have to?\"\n\n\"But I _do_ have to! I have to earn a living!\"\n\n\"Ye don't have to earn it that way! A bright young fellow like you--an\nAmerican!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Hal, \"I thought it would be interesting to see coal\nmining.\"\n\n\"Now ye've seen it,\" said the girl--\"now quit!\"\n\n\"But it won't do me any harm to go on for a while!\"\n\n\"Won't it? How can ye know? When any day they may carry you out on a\nplank!\"\n\nHer \"company manner\" was gone; her voice was full of bitterness, as it\nalways was when she spoke of North Valley. \"I know what I'm tellin' ye,\nJoe Smith. Didn't I lose two brothers in it--as fine lads as ye'd find\nanywhere in the world! And many another lad I've seen go in laughin',\nand come out a corpse--or what is worse, for workin' people, a cripple.\nSometimes I'd like to go and stand at the pit-mouth in the mornin' and\ncry to them, 'Go back, go back! Go down the canyon this day! Starve, if\nye have to, beg if ye have to, only find some other work but\ncoal-minin'!'\"\n\nHer voice had risen to a passion of protest; when she went on a new note\ncame into it--a note of personal terror. \"It's worse now--since you\ncame, Joe! To see ye settin' out on the life of a miner--you, that are\nyoung and strong and different. Oh, go away, Joe, go away while ye can!\"\n\nHe was astonished at her intensity. \"Don't worry about me, Mary,\" he\nsaid. \"Nothing will happen to me. I'll go away after a while.\"\n\nThe path was irregular, and he had been holding her arm as they walked.\nHe felt her trembling, and went on again, quickly, \"It's not I that\nshould go away, Mary. It's yourself. You hate the place--it's terrible\nfor you to have to live here. Have you never thought of going away?\"\n\nShe did not answer at once, and when she did the excitement was gone\nfrom her voice; it was flat and dull with despair. \"'Tis no use to think\nof me. There's nothin' I can do--there's nothin' any girl can do when\nshe's poor. I've tried--but 'tis like bein' up against a stone wall. I\ncan't even save the money to get on a train with! I've tried it--I been\nsavin' for two years--and how much d'ye think I got, Joe? Seven dollars!\nSeven dollars in two years! No--ye can't save money in a place where\nthere's so many things that wring the heart. Ye may hate them for being\ncowards--but ye must help when ye see a man killed, and his family\nturned out without a roof to cover them in the winter-time!\"\n\n\"You're too tender-hearted, Mary.\"\n\n\"No, 'tis not that! Should I go off and leave me own brother and sister,\nthat need me?\"\n\n\"But you could earn money and send it to them.\"\n\n\"I earn a little here--I do cleanin' and nursin' for some that need me.\"\n\n\"But outside--couldn't you earn more?\"\n\n\"I could get a job in a restaurant for seven or eight a week, but I'd\nhave to spend more, and what I sent home would not go so far, with me\naway. Or I could get a job in some other woman's home, and work fourteen\nhours a day for it. But, Joe, 'tis not more drudgery I want, 'tis\nsomethin' fair to look upon--somethin' of my own!\" She flung out her\narms suddenly like one being stifled. \"Oh, I want somethin' that's fair\nand clean!\"\n\nAgain he felt her trembling. Again the path was rough, and having an\nimpulse of sympathy, he put his arm about her. In the world of leisure,\none might indulge in such considerateness, and he assumed it would not\nbe different with a miner's daughter. But then, when she was close to\nhim, he felt, rather than heard, a sob.\n\n\"Mary!\" he whispered; and they stopped. Almost without realising it, he\nput his other arm about her, and in a moment more he felt her warm\nbreath on his cheek, and she was trembling and shaking in his embrace.\n\"Joe! Joe!\" she whispered. \"_You_ take me away!\"\n\nShe was a rose in a mining-camp, and Hal was deeply moved. The primrose\npath of dalliance stretched fair before him, here in the soft summer\nnight, with a moon overhead which bore the same message as it bore in\nthe Italian gardens of the leisure-class. But not many minutes passed\nbefore a cold fear began to steal over Hal. There was a girl at home,\nwaiting for him; and also there was the resolve which had been growing\nin him since his coming to this place--a resolve to find some way of\ncompensation to the poor, to repay them for the freedom and culture he\nhad taken; not to prey upon them, upon any individual among them. There\nwere the Jeff Cottons for that!\n\n\"Mary,\" he pleaded, \"we mustn't do this.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because--I'm not free. There is some one else.\"\n\nHe felt her start, but she did not draw away.\n\n\"Where?\" she asked, in a low voice.\n\n\"At home, waiting for me.\"\n\n\"And why didn't ye tell me?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nHal realised in a moment that the girl had ground of complaint against\nhim. According to the simple code of her world, he had gone some\ndistance with her; he had been seen to walk out with her, he had been\naccounted her \"fellow.\" He had led her to talk to him of herself--he had\ninsisted upon having her confidences. And these people who were poor did\nnot have subtleties, there was no room in their lives for intellectual\ncuriosities, for Platonic friendships or philanderings. \"Forgive me,\nMary!\" he said.\n\nShe made no answer; but a sob escaped her, and she drew back from his\narms--slowly. He struggled with an impulse to clasp her again. She was\nbeautiful, warm with life--and so much in need of happiness!\n\nBut he held himself in check, and for a minute or two they stood apart.\nThen he asked, humbly, \"We can still be friends, Mary, can't we? You\nmust know--I'm so _sorry_!\"\n\nBut she could not endure being pitied. \"'Tis nothin',\" she said. \"Only I\nthought I was going to get away! That's what ye mean to me.\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 25.\n\nHal had promised Alec Stone to keep a look-out for trouble-makers; and\none evening the boss stopped him on the street, and asked him if he had\nanything to report. Hal took the occasion to indulge his sense of\nhumour.\n\n\"There's no harm in Mike Sikoria,\" said he. \"He likes to shoot off his\nhead, but if he's got somebody to listen, that's all he wants. He's just\nold and grouchy. But there's another fellow that I think would bear\nwatching.\"\n\n\"Who's that?\" asked the boss.\n\n\"I don't know his last name. They call him Gus and he's a 'cager.'\nFellow with a red face.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Stone--\"Gus Durking.\"\n\n\"Well, he tried his best to get me to talk about unions. He keeps\nbringing it up, and I think he's some kind of trouble-maker.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said the boss. \"I'll get after him.\"\n\n\"You won't say I told you,\" said Hal, anxiously.\n\n\"Oh, no--sure not.\" And Hal caught the trace of a smile on the\npit-boss's face.\n\nHe went away, smiling in his turn. The \"red-faced feller. Gus,\" was the\nperson Madvik had named as being a \"spotter\" for the company!\n\nThere were ins and outs to this matter of \"spotting,\" and sometimes it\nwas not easy to know what to think. One Sunday morning Hal went for a\nwalk up the canyon, and on the way he met a young chap who got to\ntalking with him, and after a while brought up the question of\nworking-conditions in North Valley. He had only been there a week, he\nsaid, but everybody he had met seemed to be grumbling about short\nweight. He himself had a job as an \"outside man,\" so it made no\ndifference to him, but he was interested, and wondered what Hal had\nfound.\n\nStraightway came the question, was this really a workingman, or had Alec\nStone set some one to spying upon his spy. This was an intelligent\nfellow, an American--which in itself was suspicious, for most of the new\nmen the company got in were from \"somewhere East of Suez.\"\n\nHal decided to spar for a while. He did not know, he said, that\nconditions were any worse here than elsewhere. You heard complaints, no\nmatter what sort of job you took.\n\nYes, said the stranger, but matters seemed to be especially bad in the\ncoal-camps. Probably it was because they were so remote, and the\ncompanies owned everything in sight.\n\n\"Where have you been?\" asked Hal, thinking that this might trap him.\n\nBut the other answered straight; he had evidently worked in half a dozen\nof the camps. In Mateo he had paid a dollar a month for wash-house\nprivileges, and there had never been any water after the first three men\nhad washed. There had been a common wash-tub for all the men, an\nunthinkably filthy arrangement. At Pine Creek--Hal found the very naming\nof the place made his heart stand still--at Pine Creek he had boarded\nwith his boss, but the roof of the building leaked, and everything he\nowned was ruined; the boss would do nothing--yet when the boarder moved,\nhe lost his job. At East Ridge, this man and a couple of other fellows\nhad rented a two room cabin and started to board themselves, in spite of\nthe fact that they had to pay a dollar-fifty a sack for potatoes and\neleven cents a pound for sugar at the company store. They had continued\nuntil they made the discovery that the water supply had run short, and\nthat the water for which they were paying the company a dollar a month\nwas being pumped from the bottom of the mine, where the filth of mules\nand men was plentiful!\n\nHal forced himself to remain non-committal; he shook his head and said\nit was too bad, but the workers always got it in the neck, and he didn't\nsee what they could do about it. So they strolled back to the camp, the\nstranger evidently baffled, and Hal, for his part, feeling like the\nreader of a detective story at the end of the first chapter. Was this\nyoung man the murderer, or was he the hero? One would have to read on in\nthe book to find out!\n\n\n\nSECTION 26.\n\nHal kept his eye upon his new acquaintance, and perceived that he was\ntalking with others. Before long the man tackled Old Mike; and Mike of\ncourse could not refuse an invitation to grumble, though it came from\nthe devil himself. Hal decided that something must be done about it.\n\nHe consulted his friend Jerry, who, being a radical, might have some\ntouch-stone by which to test the stranger. Jerry sought him out at\nnoon-time, and came back and reported that he was as much in the dark as\nHal. Either the man was an agitator, seeking to \"start something,\" or\nelse he was a detective sent in by the company. There was only one way\nto find out--which was for some one to talk freely with him, and see\nwhat happened to that person!\n\nAfter some hesitation, Hal decided that he would be the victim. It\nrewakened his love of adventure, which digging in a coal-mine had\nsubdued in him. The mysterious stranger was a new sort of miner, digging\ninto the souls of men; Hal would countermine him, and perhaps blow him\nup. He could afford the experiment better than some others--better, for\nexample, than little Mrs. David, who had already taken the stranger into\nher home, and revealed to him the fact that her husband had been a\nmember of the most revolutionary of all miners' organisations, the South\nWales Federation.\n\nSo next Sunday Hal invited the stranger for another walk. The man showed\nreluctance--until Hal said that he wanted to talk to him. As they walked\nup the canyon, Hal began, \"I've been thinking about what you said of\nconditions in these camps, and I've concluded it would be a good thing\nif we had a little shaking up here in North Valley.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" said the other.\n\n\"When I first came here, I used to think the men were grouchy. But now\nI've had a chance to see for myself, and I don't believe anybody gets a\nsquare deal. For one thing, nobody gets full weight in these mines--at\nleast not unless he's some favourite of the boss. I'm sure of it, for\nI've tried all sorts of experiments with my partner. We've loaded a car\nextra light, and got eighteen hundredweight, and then we've loaded one\nhigh and solid, so that we'd know it had twice as much in it--but all we\never got was twenty-two and twenty-three. There's just no way you can\nget over that--though everybody knows those big cars can be made to hold\ntwo or three tons.\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose they might,\" said the other.\n\n\"And if you get the smallest piece of rock in, you get a 'double-O,'\nsure as fate; and sometimes they say you got rock in when you didn't.\nThere's no law to make them prove it.\"\n\n\"No, I suppose not.\"\n\n\"What it comes to is simply this--they make you think they are paying\nfifty-five a ton, but they've secretly cut you down to thirty-five. And\nyesterday at the company-store I paid a dollar and a half for a pair of\nblue overalls that I'd priced in Pedro for sixty cents.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the other, \"the company has to haul them up here, you\nknow!\"\n\nSo, gradually, Hal made the discovery that the tables were turned--the\nmysterious personage was now occupied in holding _him_ at arm's length!\nFor some reason, Hal's sudden interest in industrial justice had failed\nto make an impression.\n\nSo his career as a detective came to an inglorious end. \"Say, man!\" he\nexclaimed \"What's your game, anyhow?\"\n\n\"Game?\" said the other, quietly. \"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean, what are you here for?\"\n\n\"I'm here for two dollars a day--the same as you, I guess.\"\n\nHal began to laugh. \"You and I are like a couple of submarines, trying\nto find each other under water. I think we'd better come to the surface\nto do our fighting.\"\n\nThe other considered the simile, and seemed to like it. \"You come\nfirst,\" said he. But he did not smile. His quiet blue eyes were fixed on\nHal with deadly seriousness.\n\n\"All right,\" said Hal; \"my story isn't very thrilling. I'm not an\nescaped convict, I'm not a company spy, as you may be thinking. Nor am I\na 'natural born' coal-miner. I happen to have a brother and some friends\nat home who think they know about the coal-industry, and it got on my\nnerves, and I came to see for myself. That's all, except that I've found\nthings interesting, and want to stay on a while, so I hope you aren't a\n'dick'!\"\n\nThe other walked in silence, weighing Hal's words. \"That's not exactly\nwhat you'd call a usual story,\" he remarked, at last.\n\n\"I know,\" replied Hal. \"The best I can say for it is that it's true.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the stranger, \"I'll take a chance on it. I have to trust\nsomebody, if I'm ever to get anywhere. I picked you out because I liked\nyour face.\" He gave Hal another searching look as he walked. \"Your smile\nisn't that of a cheat. But you're young--so let me remind you of the\nimportance of secrecy in this place.\"\n\n\"I'll keep mum,\" said Hal; and the stranger opened a flap inside his\nshirt, and drew out a letter which certified him to be Thomas Olson, an\norganiser for the United Mine-Workers, the great national union of the\ncoal-miners!\n\n\n\nSECTION 27.\n\nHal was so startled by this discovery that he stopped in his tracks and\ngazed at the man. He had heard a lot about \"trouble-makers\" in the\ncamps, but so far the only kind he had seen were those hired by the\ncompany to make trouble for the men. But now, here was a union\norganiser! Jerry had suggested the possibility, but Hal had not thought\nof it seriously; an organiser was a mythological creature, whispered\nabout by the miners, cursed by the company and its servants, and by\nHal's friends at home. An incendiary, a fire-brand, a loudmouthed,\nirresponsible person, stirring up blind and dangerous passions! Having\nheard such things all his life, Hal's first impulse was of distrust. He\nfelt like the one-legged old switchman who had given him a place to\nsleep, after his beating at Pine Creek, and who had said, \"Don't you\ntalk no union business to me!\"\n\nSeeing Hal's emotion, the organiser gave an uneasy laugh. \"While you're\nhoping I'm not a 'dick,' I trust you understand I'm hoping _you're_ not\none.\"\n\nHal's answer was to the point. \"I was taken for an organiser once,\" he\nsaid, and his hands sought the seat of his ancient bruises.\n\nThe other laughed. \"You got off with a beating? You were lucky. Down in\nAlabama, not so long ago, they tarred and feathered one of us.\"\n\nDismay came upon Hal's face; but after a moment he too began to laugh.\n\"I was just thinking about my brother and his friends--what they'd have\nsaid if I'd come home from Pine Creek in a coat of tar and feathers!\"\n\n\"Possibly,\" ventured the other, \"they'd have said you got what you\ndeserved.\"\n\n\"Yes, that seems to be their attitude. That's the rule they apply to all\nthe world--if anything goes wrong with you, it must be your own fault.\nIt's a land of equal opportunity.\"\n\n\"And you'll notice,\" said the organiser, \"that the more privileges\npeople have had, the more boldly they talk that way.\"\n\nHal began to feel a sense of comradeship with this stranger, who was\nable to understand one's family troubles! It had been a long time since\nHal had talked with any one from the outside world, and he found it a\nrelief to his mind. He remembered how, after he had got his beating, he\nhad lain out in the rain and congratulated himself that he was not what\nthe guards had taken him for. Now he was curious about the psychology of\nan organiser. A man must have strong convictions to follow that\noccupation!\n\nHe made the remark, and the other answered, \"You can have my pay any\ntime you'll do my work. But let me tell you, too, it isn't being beaten\nand kicked out of camp that bothers one most; it isn't the camp-marshal\nand the spy and the blacklist. Your worst troubles are inside the heads\nof the fellows you're trying to help! Have you ever thought what it\nwould mean to try to explain things to men who speak twenty different\nlanguages?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" said Hal. \"I wonder how you ever get a start.\"\n\n\"Well, you look for an interpreter--and maybe he's a company spy. Or\nmaybe the first man you try to convert reports you to the boss. For, of\ncourse, some of the men are cowards, and some of them are crooks;\nthey'll sell out the next fellow for a better 'place'--maybe for a glass\nof beer.\"\n\n\"That must have a tendency to weaken your convictions,\" said Hal.\n\n\"No,\" said the other, in a matter of fact tone. \"It's hard, but one\ncan't blame the poor devils. They're ignorant--kept so deliberately. The\nbosses bring them here, and have a regular system to keep them from\ngetting together. And of course these European peoples have their old\nprejudices--national prejudices, religious prejudices, that keep them\napart. You see two fellows, one you think is exactly as miserable as the\nother--but you find him despising the other, because back home he was\nthe other's superior. So they play into the bosses' hands.\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 28.\n\nThey had come to a remote place in the canyon, and found themselves\nseats on a flat rock, where they could talk in comfort.\n\n\"Put yourself in their place,\" said the organiser. \"They're in a strange\ncountry, and one person tells them one thing, and another tells them\nsomething else. The masters and their agents say: 'Don't trust the union\nagitators. They're a lot of grafters, they live easy and don't have to\nwork. They take your money and call you out on strike, and you lose your\njobs and your home; they sell you out, maybe, and go on to some other\nplace to repeat the same trick.' And the workers think maybe that's\ntrue; they haven't the wit to see that if the union leaders are corrupt,\nit must be because the bosses are buying them. So you see, they're\ncompletely bedevilled; they don't know which way to turn.\"\n\nThe man was speaking quietly, but there was a little glow of excitement\nin his face. \"The company is forever repeating that these people are\nsatisfied--that it's we who are stirring them up. But are they\nsatisfied? You've been here long enough to know!\"\n\n\"There's no need to discuss that,\" Hal answered. \"Of course they're not\nsatisfied! They've seemed to me like a lot of children crying in the\ndark--not knowing what's the matter with them, or who's to blame, or\nwhere to turn for help.\"\n\nHal found himself losing his distrust of this man. He did not correspond\nin any way to Hal's imaginary picture of a union organiser; he was a\nblue-eyed, clean-looking young American, and instead of being wild and\nloud-mouthed, he seemed rather wistful. He had indignation, of course,\nbut it did not take the form of ranting or florid eloquence; and this\nrepression was making its appeal to Hal, who, in spite of his democratic\nimpulses, had the habits of thought of a class which shrinks from\nnoisiness and over-emphasis.\n\nAlso Hal was interested in his attitude towards the weaknesses of\nworking-people. The \"inertia\" of the poor, which caused so many people\nto despair for them--their cowardice and instability--these were things\nabout which Hal had heard all his life. \"You can't help them,\" people\nwould say. \"They're dirty and lazy, they drink and shirk, they betray\neach other. They've always been like that.\" The idea would be summed up\nin a formula: \"You can't change human nature!\" Even Mary Burke, herself\none of the working-class, spoke of the workers in this angry and\nscornful way. But Olson had faith in their manhood, and went ahead to\nawaken and teach them.\n\nTo his mind the path was clear and straight. \"They must be taught the\nlesson of solidarity. As individuals, they're helpless in the power of\nthe great corporations; but if they stand together, if they sell their\nlabour as a unit--then they really count for something.\" He paused, and\nlooked at the other inquiringly. \"How do you feel about unions?\"\n\nHal answered, \"They're one of the things I want to find out about. You\nhear this and that--there's so much prejudice on each side. I want to\nhelp the under dog, but I want to be sure of the right way.\"\n\n\"What other way is there?\" And Olson paused. \"To appeal to the tender\nhearts of the owners?\"\n\n\"Not exactly; but mightn't one appeal to the world in general--to public\nopinion? I was brought up an American, and learned to believe in my\ncountry. I can't think but there's some way to get justice. Maybe if the\nmen were to go into politics--\"\n\n\"Politics?\" cried Olson. \"My God! How long have you been in this place?\"\n\n\"Only a couple of months.\"\n\n\"Well, stay till November, and see what they do with the ballot-boxes in\nthese camps!\"\n\n\"I can imagine, of course--\"\n\n\"No, you can't. Any more than you could imagine the graft and the\nmisery!\"\n\n\"But if the men should take to voting together--\"\n\n\"How _can_ they take to voting together--when any one who mentions the\nidea goes down the canyon? Why, you can't even get naturalisation\npapers, unless you're a company man; they won't register you, unless the\nboss gives you an O. K. How are you going to make a start, unless you\nhave a union?\"\n\nIt sounded reasonable, Hal had to admit; but he thought of the stories\nhe had heard about \"walking delegates,\" all the dreadful consequences of\n\"union domination.\" He had not meant to go in for unionism!\n\nOlson was continuing. \"We've had laws passed, a whole raft of laws about\ncoal-mining--the eight-hour law, the anti-scrip law, the company-store\nlaw, the mine-sprinkling law, the check-weighman law. What difference\nhas it made in North Valley that there are such laws on the\nstatute-books? Would you ever even know about them?\"\n\n\"Ah, now!\" said Hal. \"If you put it that way--if your movement is to\nhave the law enforced--I'm with you!\"\n\n\"But how will you get the law enforced, except by a union? No individual\nman can do it--it's 'down the canyon' with him if he mentions the law.\nIn Western City our union people go to the state officials, but they\nnever do anything--and why? They know we haven't got the men behind us!\nIt's the same with the politicians as it is with the bosses--the union\nis the thing that counts!\"\n\nHal found this an entirely new argument. \"People don't realise that\nidea--that men have to be organised to get their _legal_ rights.\"\n\nAnd the other threw up his hands with a comical gesture. \"My God! If you\nwant to make a list of the things that people don't realise about us\nminers!\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 29.\n\nOlson was eager to win Hal, and went on to tell all the secrets of his\nwork. He sought men who believed in unions, and were willing to take the\nrisk of trying to convert others. In each place he visited he would get\na group together, and would arrange some way to communicate with them\nafter he left, smuggling in propaganda literature for distribution. So\nthere would be the nucleus of an organisation. In a year or two they\nwould have such a nucleus in every camp, and then they would be ready to\ncome into the open, calling meetings in the towns, and in places in the\ncanyons to which the miners would flock. So the flame of revolt would\nleap up; men would join the movement faster than the companies could get\nrid of them, and they would make a demand for their rights, backed with\nthe threat of a strike throughout the entire district.\n\n\"You understand,\" added Olson, \"we have a legal right to organise--even\nthough the bosses disapprove. You need not stand back on that score.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Hal; \"but it occurs to me that as a matter of tactics, it\nwould be better here in North Valley if you chose some issue there's\nless controversy about; if, for instance, you'd concentrate on getting a\ncheck-weighman.\"\n\nThe other smiled. \"We'd have to have a union to back the demand; so\nwhat's the difference?\"\n\n\"Well,\" argued Hal, \"there are prejudices to be reckoned with. Some\npeople don't like the idea of a union--they think it means tyranny and\nviolence--\"\n\nThe organiser laughed. \"You aren't convinced but that it does yourself,\nare you! Well, all I can tell you is, if you want to tackle the job of\ngetting a check-weighman in North Valley, I'll not stand in your way!\"\n\nHere was an idea--a real idea! Life had grown dull for Hal since he had\nbecome a buddy, working in a place five feet high. This would promise\nlivelier times!\n\nBut was it a thing he wanted to do? So far he had been an observer of\nconditions in this coal-camp. He had convinced himself that conditions\nwere cruel, and he had pretty well convinced himself that the cruelty\nwas needless and deliberate. But when it came to a question of an action\nto be taken--then he hesitated, and old prejudices and fears made\nthemselves heard. He had been told that labour was \"turbulent\" and\n\"lazy,\" that it had to be \"ruled with a strong hand\"; now, was he\nwilling to weaken the strong hand, to ally himself with those who\n\"fomented labour troubles\"?\n\nBut this would not be the same thing, he told himself. This suggestion\nof Olson's was different from trade unionism, which might be a\ndemoralising force, leading the workers from one demand to another,\nuntil they were seeking to \"dominate industry.\" This would be merely an\nappeal to the law, a test of that honesty and fair dealing to which the\ncompany everywhere laid claim. If, as the bosses proclaimed, the workers\nwere fully protected by the check-weighman law; if, as all the world was\nmade to believe, the reason there was no check-weighman was simply\nbecause the men did not ask for one--why, then there would be no harm\ndone. If on the other hand a demand for a right that was not merely a\nlegal right, but a moral right as well--if that were taken by the bosses\nas an act of rebellion against the company--well, Hal would understand a\nlittle more about the \"turbulence\" of labour! If, as Old Mike and\nJohannson and the rest maintained, the bosses would \"make your life one\ndamn misery\" till you left--then he would be ready to make a few damn\nmiseries for the bosses in return!\n\n\"It would be an adventure,\" said Hal, suddenly.\n\nAnd the other laughed. \"It would that!\"\n\n\"You're thinking I'll have another Pine Creek experience,\" Hal added.\n\"Well, maybe so--but I have to try things out for myself. You see, I've\ngot a brother at home, and when I think about going in for revolution, I\nhave imaginary arguments with him. I want to be able to say 'I didn't\nswallow anybody's theories; I tried it for myself, and this is what\nhappened.'\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied the organiser, \"that's all right. But while you're\nseeking education for yourself and your brother, don't forget that I've\nalready got my education. I _know_ what happens to men who ask for a\ncheck-weighman, and I can't afford to sacrifice myself proving it\nagain.\"\n\n\"I never asked you to,\" laughed Hal. \"If I won't join your movement, I\ncan't expect you to join mine! But if I can find a few men who are\nwilling to take the risk of making a demand for a check-weighman--that\nwon't hurt your work, will it?\"\n\n\"Sure not!\" said the other. \"Just the opposite--it'll give me an object\nlesson to point to. There are men here who don't even know they've a\nlegal right to a check-weighman. There are others who know they don't\nget their weights, but aren't sure its the company that's cheating them.\nIf the bosses should refuse to let any one inspect the weights, if they\nshould go further and fire the men who ask it--well, there'll be plenty\nof recruits for my union local!\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Hal. \"I'm not setting out to recruit your union local,\nbut if the company wants to recruit it, that's the company's affair!\"\nAnd on this bargain the two shook hands.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK TWO\n\nTHE SERFS OF KING COAL\n\n\n\n\nSECTION 1.\n\nHal was now started upon a new career, more full of excitements than\nthat of stableman or buddy, with perils greater than those of falling\nrock or the hind feet of mules in the stomach. The inertia which\noverwork produces had not had time to become a disease with him; youth\nwas on his side, with its zest for more and yet more experience. He\nfound it thrilling to be a conspirator, to carry about with him secrets\nas dark and mysterious as the passages of the mine in which he worked.\n\nBut Jerry Minetti, the first person he told of Tom Olson's purpose in\nNorth Valley, was older in such thrills. The care-free look which Jerry\nwas accustomed to wear vanished abruptly, and fear came into his eyes.\n\"I know it come some day,\" he exclaimed--\"trouble for me and Rosa!\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"We get into it--get in sure. I say Rosa, 'Call yourself Socialist--what\ngood that do? No help any. No use to vote here--they don't count no\nSocialist vote, only for joke!' I say, 'Got to have union. Got to\nstrike!' But Rosa say, 'Wait little bit. Save little bit money, let\nchildren grow up. Then we help, no care if we no got any home.'\"\n\n\"But we're not going to start a union now!\" objected Hal. \"I have\nanother plan for the present.\"\n\nJerry, however, was not to be put at ease. \"No can wait!\" he declared.\n\"Men no stand it! I say, 'It come some day quick--like blow-up in mine!\nSomebody start fight, everybody fight.'\" And Jerry looked at Rosa, who\nsat with her black eyes fixed anxiously upon her husband. \"We get into\nit,\" he said; and Hal saw their eyes turn to the room where Little Jerry\nand the baby were sleeping.\n\nHal said nothing--he was beginning to understand the meaning of\nrebellion to such people. He watched with curiosity and pity the\nstruggle that went on; a struggle as old as the soul of man--between the\nvoice of self-interest, of comfort and prudence, and the call of duty,\nof the ideal. No trumpet sounded for this conflict, only the still small\nvoice within.\n\nAfter a while Jerry asked what it was Hal and Olson had planned; and Hal\nexplained that he wanted to make a test of the company's attitude toward\nthe check-weighman law. Hal thought it a fine scheme; what did Jerry\nthink?\n\nJerry smiled sadly. \"Yes, fine scheme for young feller--no got family!\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" said Hal, \"I'll take the job--I'll be the\ncheck-weighman.\"\n\n\"Got to have committee,\" said Jerry--\"committee go see boss.\"\n\n\"All right, but we'll get young fellows for that too--men who have no\nfamilies. Some of the fellows who live in the chicken-coops in\nshanty-town. They won't care what happens to them.\"\n\nBut Jerry would not share Hal's smile. \"No got sense 'nough, them\nfellers. Take sense to stick together.\" He explained that they would\nneed a group of men to stand back of the committee; such a group would\nhave to be organised, to hold meetings in secret--it would be\npractically the same thing as a union, would be so regarded by the\nbosses and their spotters. And no organisation of any sort was permitted\nin the camps. There had been some Serbians who had wanted to belong to a\nfraternal order back in their home country, but even that had been\nforbidden. If you wanted to insure your life or your health, the company\nwould attend to it--and get the profit from it. For that matter, you\ncould not even buy a post-office money-order, to send funds back to the\nold country; the post-office clerk, who was at the same time a clerk in\nthe company-store, would sell you some sort of a store-draft.\n\nSo Hal was facing the very difficulties about which Olson had warned\nhim. The first of them was Jerry's fear. Yet Hal knew that Jerry was no\n\"coward\"; if any man had a contempt for Jerry's attitude, it was because\nhe had never been in Jerry's place!\n\n\"All I'll ask of you now is advice,\" said Hal. \"Give me the names of\nsome young fellows who are trustworthy, and I'll get their help without\nanybody suspecting you.\"\n\n\"You my boarder!\" was Jerry's reply to this.\n\nSo again Hal was \"up against it.\" \"You mean that would get you into\ntrouble?\"\n\n\"Sure! They know we talk. They know I talk Socialism, anyhow. They fire\nme sure!\"\n\n\"But how about your cousin, the pit-boss in Number One?\"\n\n\"He no help. May be get fired himself. Say damn fool--board\ncheck-weighman!\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Hal. \"Then I'll move away now, before it's too late.\nYou can say I was a trouble-maker, and you turned me off.\"\n\nThe Minettis sat gazing at each other--a mournful pair. They hated to\nlose their boarder, who was such good company, and paid them such good\nmoney. As for Hal, he felt nearly as bad, for he liked Jerry and his\ngirl-wife, and Little Jerry--even the black-eyed baby, who made so much\nnoise and interrupted conversation!\n\n\"No!\" said Jerry. \"I no run, away! I do my share!\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" replied Hal. \"You do your share--but not just yet.\nYou stay on in the camp and help Olson after I'm fired. We don't want\nthe best men put out at once.\"\n\nSo, after further argument, it was decided, and Hal saw little Rosa sink\nback in her chair and draw a deep breath of relief. The time for\nmartyrdom was put off; her little three-roomed cabin, her furniture and\nher shining pans and her pretty white lace curtains, might be hers for a\nfew weeks longer!\n\n\n\nSECTION 2.\n\nHal went back to Reminitsky's boarding-house; a heavy sacrifice, but not\nwithout its compensations, because it gave him more chance to talk with\nthe men.\n\nHe and Jerry made up a list of those who could be trusted with the\nsecret: the list beginning with the name of Mike Sikoria. To be put on a\ncommittee, and sent to interview a boss, would appeal to Old Mike as the\npurpose for which he had been put upon earth! But they would not tell\nhim about it until the last minute, for fear lest in his excitement he\nmight shout out the announcement the next time he lost one of his cars.\n\nThere was a young Bulgarian miner named Wresmak who worked near Hal. The\nroad into this man's room ran up an incline, and he had hardly been able\nto push his \"empties\" up the grade. While he was sweating and straining\nat the task, Alec Stone had come along, and having a giant's contempt\nfor physical weakness, began to cuff him. The man raised his\narm--whether in offence or to ward off the blow, no one could be sure;\nbut Stone fell upon him and kicked him all the way down the passage,\npouring out upon him furious curses. Now the man was in another room,\nwhere he had taken out over forty car-loads of rock, and been allowed\nonly three dollars for it. No one who watched his face when the pit-boss\npassed would doubt that this man would be ready to take his chances in a\nmovement of protest.\n\nThen there was a man whom Jerry knew, who had just come out of the\nhospital, after contact with the butt-end of the camp-marshal's\nrevolver. This was a Pole, who unfortunately did not know a word of\nEnglish; but Olson, the organiser, had got into touch with another Pole,\nwho spoke a little English, and would pass the word on to his\nfellow-countryman. Also there was a young Italian, Rovetta, whom Jerry\nknew and whose loyalty he could vouch for.\n\nThere was another person Hal thought of--Mary Burke. He had been\ndeliberately avoiding her of late; it seemed the one safe thing to\ndo--although it seemed also a cruel thing, and left his mind ill at\nease. He went over and over what had happened. How had the trouble got\nstarted? It is a man's duty in such cases to take the blame upon\nhimself; but a man does not like to take blame upon himself, and he\ntries to make it as light as possible. Should Hal say that it was\nbecause he had been too officious that night in helping Mary where the\npath was rough? She had not actually needed such help, she was quite as\ncapable on her feet as he! But he had really gone farther than that--he\nhad had a definite sentimental impulse; and he had been a cad--he should\nhave known all along that all this girl's discontent, all the longing of\nher starved soul, would become centred upon him, who was so \"different,\"\nwho had had opportunity, who made her think of the \"poetry-books\"!\n\nBut here suddenly seemed a solution of the difficulty; here was a new\ninterest for Mary, a safe channel in which her emotions could run. A\nwoman could not serve on a miners' committee, but she would be a good\nadviser, and her sharp tongue would be a weapon to drive others into\nline. Being aflame with this enterprise, Hal became impersonal,\nman-fashion--and so fell into another sentimental trap! He did not stop\nto think that Mary's interest in the check-weighman movement might be\nconditioned in part by a desire to see more of him; still less did it\noccur to him that he might be glad for a pretext to see Mary.\n\nNo, he was picturing her in a new role, an activity more inspiriting\nthan cooking and nursing. His \"poetry-book\" imagination took fire; he\ngave her a hope and a purpose, a pathway with a goal at the end. Had\nthere not been women leaders in every great proletarian movement?\n\nHe went to call on her, and met her at the door of her cabin. \"'Tis a\ncheerin' sight to see ye, Joe Smith!\" she said. And she looked him in\nthe eye and smiled.\n\n\"The same to you, Mary Burke!\" he answered.\n\nShe was game, he saw; she was going to be a \"good sport.\" But he noticed\nthat she was paler than when he had seen her last. Could it be that\nthese gorgeous Irish complexions ever faded? He thought that she was\nthinner too; the old blue calico seemed less tight upon her.\n\nHal plunged into his theme. \"Mary, I had a vision of you to-day!\"\n\n\"Of me, lad? What's that?\"\n\nHe laughed. \"I saw you with a glory in your face, and your hair shining\nlike a crown of gold. You were mounted on a snow-white horse, and wore a\nrobe of white, soft and lustrous--like Joan of Arc, or a leader in a\nsuffrage parade. You were riding at the head of a host--I've still got\nthe music in my ears, Mary!\"\n\n\"Go on with ye, lad--what's all this about?\"\n\n\"Come in and I'll tell you,\" he said.\n\nSo they went into the bare kitchen, and sat in bare wooden chairs--Mary\nfolding her hands in her lap like a child who has been promised a\nfairy-story. \"Now hurry,\" said she. \"I want to know about this new dress\nye're givin' me. Are ye tired of me old calico?\"\n\nHe joined in her smile. \"This is a dress you will weave for yourself,\nMary, out of the finest threads of your own nature--out of courage and\ndevotion and self-sacrifice.\"\n\n\"Sure, 'tis the poetry-book again! But what is it ye're really meanin'?\"\n\nHe looked about him. \"Is anybody here?\"\n\n\"Nobody.\"\n\nBut instinctively he lowered his voice as he told his story. There was\nan organiser of the \"big union\" in the camp, and he was going to rouse\nthe slaves to protest.\n\nThe laughter went out of Mary's face. \"Oh! It's that!\" she said, in a\nflat tone. The vision of the snow-white horse and the soft and lustrous\nrobe was gone. \"Ye can never do anything of that sort here!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"'Tis the men in this place. Don't ye remember what I told ye at Mr.\nRafferty's? They're cowards!\"\n\n\"Ah, Mary, it's easy to say that. But it's not so pleasant being turned\nout of your home--\"\n\n\"Do ye have to tell me that?\" she cried, with sudden passion. \"Haven't I\nseen that?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mary; but I want to _do_ something--\"\n\n\"Yes, and haven't I wanted to do something? Sure, I've wanted to bite\noff the noses of the bosses!\"\n\n\"Well,\" he laughed, \"we'll make that a part of our programme.\" But Mary\nwas not to be lured into cheerfulness; her mood was so full of pain and\nbewilderment that he had an impulse to reach out and take her hand\nagain. But he checked that; he had come to divert her energies into a\nsafe channel!\n\n\"We must waken these men to resistance, Mary!\"\n\n\"Ye can't do it, Joe--not the English-speakin' men. The Greeks and the\nBulgars, maybe--they're fightin' at home, and they might fight here. But\nthe Irish never--never! Them that had any backbone went out long ago.\nThem that stayed has been made into boot-licks. I know them, every man\nof them. They grumble, and curse the boss, but then they think of the\nblacklist, and they go back and cringe at his feet.\"\n\n\"What such men want--\"\n\n\"'Tis booze they want, and carousin' with the rotten women in the\ncoal-towns, and sittin' up all night winnin' each other's money with a\ngreasy pack of cards! They take their pleasure where they find it, and\n'tis nothin' better they want.\"\n\n\"Then, Mary, if that's so, don't you see it's all the more reason for\ntrying to teach them? If not for their own sakes, for the sake of their\nchildren! The children, mustn't grow up like that! They are learning\nEnglish, at least--\"\n\nMary gave a scornful laugh. \"Have ye been up to that school?\"\n\nHe answered no; and she told him there were a hundred and twenty\nchildren packed in one room, three in a seat, and solid all round the\nwall. She went on, with swift anger--the school was supposed to be paid\nfor out of taxes, but as nobody owned any property but the company, it\nwas all in the company's hands. The school-board consisted of Mr.\nCartwright, the mine-superintendent, and Jake Predovich, a clerk in the\nstore, and the preacher, the Reverend Spraggs. Old Spraggs would bump\nhis nose on the floor if the \"super\" told him to.\n\n\"Now, now!\" said Hal, laughing. \"You're down on him because his\ngrandfather was an Orangeman!\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 3.\n\nMary Burke had been suckled upon despair, and the poison of it was deep\nin her blood. Hal began to realise that it would be as hard to give her\na hope as to rouse the workers whom she despised. She was brave enough,\nno doubt, but how could he persuade her to be brave for men who had no\ncourage for themselves?\n\n\"Mary,\" he said, \"in your heart you don't really hate these people. You\nknow how they suffer, you pity them for it. You give their children your\nlast cent when they need it--\"\n\n\"Ah, lad!\" she cried, and he saw tears suddenly spring into her eyes.\n\"'Tis because I love them so that I hate them! Sometimes 'tis the bosses\nI would murder, sometimes 'tis the men. What is it ye're wantin' me to\ndo?\"\n\nAnd then, even before he could answer, she began to run over the list of\nher acquaintances in the camp. Yes, there was one man Hal ought to talk\nto; he would be too old to join them, but his advice would be\ninvaluable, and they could be sure he would never betray them. That was\nold John Edstrom, a Swede from Minnesota, who had worked in this\ndistrict from the time the mines had first started up. He had been\nactive in the great strike eight years ago, and had been black-listed,\nhis four sons with him. The sons were scattered now to the four parts of\nthe world, but the father had stayed nearby, working as a ranch-hand and\nrailroad labourer, until a couple of years ago, during a rush season, he\nhad got a chance to come back into the mines.\n\nHe was old, old, declared Mary--must be sixty. And when Hal remarked\nthat that did not sound so frightfully aged, she answered that one\nseldom heard of a man being able to work in a coal-mine at that age; in\nfact, there were not many who managed to live to that age. Edstrom's\nwife was dying now, and he was having a hard time.\n\n\"'Twould not be fair to let such an old gentleman lose his job,\" said\nMary. \"But at least he could give ye good advice.\"\n\nSo that evening the two of them went to call on John Edstrom, in a tiny\nunpainted cabin in \"shanty-town,\" with a bare earth floor, and a half\npartition of rough boards to hide his dying wife from his callers. The\nwoman's trouble was cancer, and this made calling a trying matter, for\nthere was a fearful odour in the place. For some time it was impossible\nfor Hal to force himself to think about anything else; but finally he\novercame this weakness, telling himself that this was a war, and that a\nman must be ready for the hospital as well as for the parade-ground.\n\nHe looked about, and saw that the cracks of Edstrom's cabin were stopped\nwith rags, and the broken windowpanes mended with brown paper. The old\nman had evidently made an effort to keep the place neat, and Hal noticed\na row of books on a shelf. Because it was cold in these mountain regions\nat night, even in September, the old man had a fire in the little\ncast-iron stove, and sat huddled by it. There were only a few hairs left\non his head, and his scrubby beard was as white as anything could be in\na coal-camp. The first impression of his face was of its pallor, and\nthen of the benevolence in the faded dark eyes; also his voice was\ngentle, like a caress. He rose to greet his visitors, and put out to Hal\na trembling hand, which resembled the paw of some animal, horny and\nmisshapen. He made a move to draw up a bench, and apologised for his\nunskillful house-keeping. It occurred to Hal that a man might be able to\nwork in a coal-mine at sixty, and not be able to work in it at\nsixty-one.\n\nHal had requested Mary to say nothing about his purpose, until after he\nhad a chance to judge for himself. So now the girl inquired about Mrs.\nEdstrom. There was no news, the man answered; she was lying in a stupor,\nas usual. Dr. Barrett had come again, but all he could do was to give\nher morphine. No one could do any more, the doctor declared.\n\n\"Sure, he'd not know it if they could!\" sniffed Mary.\n\n\"He's not such a bad one, when he's sober,\" said Edstrom, patiently.\n\n\"And how often is that?\" sniffed Mary again. She added, by way of\nexplanation to Hal, \"He's a cousin of the super.\"\n\nThings were better here than in some places, said Edstrom. At Harvey's\nRun, where he had worked, a man had got his eye hurt, and had lost it\nthrough the doctor's instrument slipping; broken arms and legs had been\nset wrong, and either the men had to go through life as cripples, or go\nelsewhere and have the bones re-broken and reset, It was like everything\nelse--the doctor was a part of the company machine, and if you had too\nmuch to say about him, it was down the canyon with you. You not only had\na dollar a month taken out of your pay, but if you were injured, and he\ncame to attend you, he would charge whatever extra he pleased.\n\n\"And you have to pay?\" asked Hal.\n\n\"They take it off your account,\" said the old man.\n\n\"Sometimes they take it when he's done nothin' at all,\" added Mary.\n\"They charged Mrs. Zamboni twenty-five dollars for her last baby--and\nDr. Barrett never set foot across her door till three hours after the\nbaby was in my arms!\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 4.\n\nThe talk went on. Wishing to draw the old man out, Hal spoke of various\ntroubles of the miners, and at last he suggested that the remedy might\nbe found in a union. Edstrom's dark eyes studied him, and then turned to\nMary. \"Joe's all right,\" said the girl, quickly. \"You can trust him.\"\n\nEdstrom made no direct answer to this, but remarked that he had once\nbeen in a strike. He was a marked man, now, and could only stay in the\ncamp so long as he attended strictly to his own affairs. The part he had\nplayed in the big strike had never been forgotten; the bosses had let\nhim work again, partly because they had needed him at a rush time, and\npartly because the pit-boss happened to be a personal friend.\n\n\"Tell him about the big strike,\" said Mary. \"He's new in this district.\"\n\nThe old man had apparently accepted Mary's word for Hal's good faith,\nfor he began to narrate those terrible events which were a whispered\ntradition of the camps. There had been a mighty effort of ten thousand\nslaves for freedom; and it had been crushed with utter ruthlessness.\nEver since these mines had been started, the operators had controlled\nthe local powers of government, and now, in the emergency, they had\nbrought in the state militia as well, and used it frankly to drive the\nstrikers back to work. They had seized the leaders and active men, and\nthrown them into jail without trial or charges; when the jails would\nhold no more, they kept some two hundred in an open stockade, called a\n\"bull-pen,\" and finally they loaded them into freight-cars, took them at\nnight out of the state, and dumped them off in the midst of the desert\nwithout food or water.\n\nJohn Edstrom had been one of these men. He told how one of his sons had\nbeen beaten and severely injured in jail, and how another had been kept\nfor weeks in a damp cellar, so that he had come out crippled with\nrheumatism for life. The officers of the state militia had done these\nthings; and when some of the local authorities were moved to protest,\nthe militia had arrested them--even the judges of the civil courts had\nbeen forbidden to sit, under threat of imprisonment. \"To hell with the\nconstitution!\" had been the word of the general in command; his\nsubordinate had made famous the saying, \"No habeas corpus; we'll give\nthem post-mortems!\"\n\nTom Olson had impressed Hal with his self-control, but this old man made\nan even deeper impression upon him. As he listened, he became humble,\ntouched with awe. Incredible as it might seem, when John Edstrom talked\nabout his cruel experiences, it was without bitterness in his voice, and\napparently without any in his heart. Here, in the midst of want and\ndesolation, with his family broken and scattered, and the wolf of\nstarvation at his door, he could look back upon the past without hatred\nof those who had ruined him. Nor was this because he was old and feeble,\nand had lost the spirit of revolt; it was because he had studied\neconomics, and convinced himself that it was an evil system which\nblinded men's eyes and poisoned their souls. A better day was coming, he\nsaid, when this evil system would be changed, and it would be possible\nfor men to be merciful to one another.\n\nAt this point in the conversation, Mary Burke gave voice once more to\nher corroding despair. How could things ever be changed? The bosses were\nmean-hearted, and the men were cowards and traitors. That left nobody\nbut God to do the changing--and God had left things as they were for\nsuch a long time!\n\nHal was interested to hear how Edstrom dealt with this attitude. \"Mary,\"\nhe said, \"did you ever read about ants in Africa?\"\n\n\"No,\" said she.\n\n\"They travel in long columns, millions and millions of them. And when\nthey come to a ditch, the front ones fall in, and more and more of them\non top, till they fill up the ditch, and the rest cross over. We are\nants, Mary.\"\n\n\"No matter how many go in,\" cried the girl, \"none will ever get across.\nThere's no bottom to the ditch!\"\n\nHe answered: \"That's more than any ant can know. Mary. All they know is\nto go in. They cling to each other's bodies, even in death; they make a\nbridge, and the rest go over.\"\n\n\"I'll step one side!\" she declared, fiercely. \"I'll not throw meself\naway.\"\n\n\"You may step one side,\" answered the other--\"but you'll step back into\nline again. I know you better than you know yourself, Mary.\"\n\nThere was silence in the little cabin. The winds of an early fall\nshrilled outside, and life suddenly seemed to Hal a stern and merciless\nthing. He had thought in his youthful fervour it would be thrilling to\nbe a revolutionist; but to be an ant, one of millions and millions, to\nperish in a bottomless ditch--that was something a man could hardly\nbring himself to face! He looked at the bowed figure of this white\nhaired toiler, vague in the feeble lamplight, and found himself thinking\nof Rembrandt's painting, the Visit of Emmaus: the ill-lighted room in\nthe dirty tavern, and the two ragged men, struck dumb by the glow of\nlight about the forehead of their table-companion. It was not fantastic\nto imagine a glow of light about the forehead of this soft-voiced old\nman!\n\n\"I never had any hope it would come in my time,\" the old man was saying\ngently. \"I did use to hope my boys might see it--but now I'm not sure\neven of that. But in all my life I never doubted that some day the\nworking-people will cross over to the promised land. They'll no longer\nbe slaves, and what they make won't be wasted by idlers. And take it\nfrom one who knows, Mary--for a workingman or woman not to have that\nfaith, is to have lost the reason for living.\"\n\nHal decided that it would be safe to trust this man, and told him of his\ncheck-weighman plan. \"We only want your advice,\" he explained,\nremembering Mary's warning. \"Your sick wife--\"\n\nBut the old man answered, sadly, \"She's almost gone, and I'll soon be\nfollowing. What little strength I have left might as well be used for\nthe cause.\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 5.\n\nThis business of conspiracy was grimly real to men whose living came out\nof coal; but Hal, even at the most serious moments, continued to find in\nit the thrill of romance. He had read stories of revolutionists, and of\nthe police who hunted them. That such excitements were to be had in\nRussia, he knew; but if any one had told him they could be had in his\nown free America, within a few hours' journey of his home city and his\ncollege-town, he could not have credited the statement.\n\nThe evening after his visit to Edstrom, Hal was stopped on the street by\nhis boss. Encountering him suddenly, Hal started, like a pick-pocket who\nruns into a policeman.\n\n\"Hello, kid,\" said the pit-boss.\n\n\"Hello, Mr. Stone,\" was the reply.\n\n\"I want to talk to you,\" said the boss.\n\n\"All right, sir.\" And then, under his breath, \"He's got me!\"\n\n\"Come up to my house,\" said Stone; and Hal followed, feeling as if\nhand-cuffs were already on his wrists.\n\n\"Say,\" said the man, as they walked, \"I thought you were going to tell\nme if you'd heard any talk.\"\n\n\"I haven't heard any, sir.\"\n\n\"Well,\" continued Stone, \"you want to get busy; there's sure to be\nkickers in every coal-camp.\" And deep within, Hal drew a sigh of relief.\nIt was a false alarm!\n\nThey came to the boss's house, and he took a chair on the piazza and\nmotioned Hal to take another. They sat in semi-darkness, and Stone\ndropped his voice as he began. \"What I want to talk to you about now is\nsomething else--this election.\"\n\n\"Election, sir?\"\n\n\"Didn't you know there was one? The Congressman in this district died,\nand there's a special election three weeks from next Tuesday.\"\n\n\"I see, sir.\" And Hal chuckled inwardly. He would get the information\nwhich Tom Olson had recommended to him!\n\n\"You ain't heard any talk about it?\" inquired the pit-boss.\n\n\"Nothing at all, sir. I never pay much attention to politics--it ain't\nin my line.\"\n\n\"Well, that's the way I like to hear a miner talk!\" said the pit-boss,\nwith heartiness. \"If they all had sense enough to leave politics to the\npoliticians, they'd be a sight better off. What they need is to tend to\ntheir own jobs.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" agreed Hal, meekly--\"like I had to tend to them mules, if I\ndidn't want to get the colic.\"\n\nThe boss smiled appreciatively. \"You've got more sense than most of 'em.\nIf you'll stand by me, there'll be a chance for you to move up in the\nworld.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Stone,\" said Hal. \"Give me a chance.\"\n\n\"Well now, here's this election. Every year they send us a bunch of\ncampaign money to handle. A bit of it might come your way.\"\n\n\"I could use it, I reckon,\" said Hal, brightening visibly. \"What is it\nyou want?\"\n\nThere was a pause, while Stone puffed on his pipe. He went on, in a\nbusiness-like manner. \"What I want is somebody to feel things out a bit,\nand let me know the situation. I thought it better not to use the men\nthat generally work for me, but somebody that wouldn't be suspected.\nDown in Sheridan and Pedro they say the Democrats are making a big stir,\nand the company's worried. I suppose you know the 'G. F. C.' is\nRepublican.\"\n\n\"I've heard so.\"\n\n\"You might think a congressman don't have much to do with us, way off in\nWashington; but it has a bad effect to have him campaigning, telling the\nmen the company's abusing them. So I'd like you just to kind o'\ncirculate a bit, and start the men on politics, and see if any of them\nhave been listening to this MacDougall talk. (MacDougall's this here\nDemocrat, you know.) And I want to find out whether they've been sending\nin literature to this camp, or have any agents here. You see, they claim\nthe right to come in and make speeches, and all that sort of thing.\nNorth Valley's an incorporated town, so they've got the law on their\nside, in a way, and if we shut 'em out, they make a howl in the papers,\nand it looks bad. So we have to get ahead of them in quiet ways.\nFortunately there ain't any hall in the camp for them to meet in, and\nwe've made a local ordinance against meetings on the street. If they try\nto bring in circulars, something has to happen to them before they get\ndistributed. See?\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Hal; he thought of Tom Olson's propaganda literature!\n\n\"We'll pass the word out,--it's the Republican the company wants\nelected; and you be on the lookout and see how they take it in the\ncamp.\"\n\n\"That sounds easy enough,\" said Hal. \"But tell me, Mr. Stone, why do you\nbother? Do so many of these wops have votes?\"\n\n\"It ain't the wops so much. We get them naturalised on purpose--they\nvote our way for a glass of beer. But the English-speaking men, or the\nforeigners that's been here too long, and got too big for their\nbreeches--they're the ones we got to watch. If they get to talking\npolitics, they don't stop there; the first thing you know, they're\nlistening to union agitators, and wanting to run the camp.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I see!\" said Hal, and wondered if his voice sounded right.\n\nBut the pit-boss was concerned with his own troubles. \"As I told Si\nAdams the other day, what I'm looking for is fellows that talk some new\nlingo--one that nobody will ever understand! But I suppose that would be\ntoo easy. There's no way to keep them from learning some English!\"\n\nHal decided to make use of this opportunity to perfect his education.\n\"Surely, Mr. Stone,\" he remarked, \"you don't have to count any votes if\nyou don't want to!\"\n\n\"Well, I'll tell you,\" replied Stone; \"it's a question of the easiest\nway to manage things. When I was superintendent over to Happy Gulch, we\ndidn't waste no time on politics. The company was Democratic at that\ntime, and when election night come, we wrote down four hundred votes for\nthe Democratic candidates. But the first thing we knew, a bunch of\nfellers was taken into town and got to swear they'd voted the Republican\nticket in our camp. The Republican papers were full of it, and some fool\njudge ordered a recount, and we had to get busy over night and mark up a\nnew lot of ballots. It gave us a lot of bother!\"\n\nThe pit-boss laughed, and Hal joined him discreetly.\n\n\"So you see, you have to learn to manage. If there's votes for the wrong\ncandidate in your camp, the fact gets out, and if the returns is too\none-sided, there's a lot of grumbling. There's plenty of bosses that\ndon't care, but I learned my lesson that time, and I got my own\nmethod--that is not to let any opposition start. See?\"\n\n\"Yes, I see.\"\n\n\"Maybe a mine-boss has got no right to meddle in politics--but there's\none thing he's got the say about, and that is who works in his mine.\nIt's the easiest thing to weed out--weed out--\" Hal never forgot the\nmotion of beefy hands with which Alec Stone illustrated these words. As\nhe went on, the tones of his voice did not seem so good-natured as\nusual. \"The fellows that don't want to vote my way can go somewhere else\nto do their voting. That's all I got to say on politics!\"\n\nThere was a brief pause, while Stone puffed on his pipe. Then it may\nhave occurred to him that it was not necessary to go into so much detail\nin breaking in a political recruit. When he resumed, it was in a\ngood-natured tone of dismissal. \"That's what you do, kid. To-morrow you\nget a sprained wrist, so you can't work for a few days, and that'll give\nyou a chance to bum round and hear what the men are saying. Meantime,\nI'll see you get your wages.\"\n\n\"That sounds all right,\" said Hal; but showing only a small part of his\nsatisfaction!\n\nThe pit-boss rose from his chair and knocked the ashes from his pipe.\n\"Mind you--I want the goods. I've got other fellows working, and I'm\ncomparing 'em. For all you know, I may have somebody watching you.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Hal, and grinned cheerfully. \"I'll not fail to bear that in\nmind.\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 6.\n\nThe first thing Hal did was to seek out Tom Olson and narrate this\nexperience. The two of them had a merry time over it. \"I'm the favourite\nof a boss now!\" laughed Hal.\n\nBut the organiser became suddenly serious. \"Be careful what you do for\nthat fellow.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"He might use it on you later on. One of the things they try to do if\nyou make any trouble for them, is to prove that you took money from\nthem, or tried to.\"\n\n\"But he won't have any proofs.\"\n\n\"That's my point--don't give him any. If Stone says you've been playing\nthe political game for him, then some fellow might remember that you did\nask him about politics. So don't have any marked money on you.\"\n\nHal laughed. \"Money doesn't stay on me very long these days. But what\nshall I say if he asks me for a report?\"\n\n\"You'd better put your job right through, Joe--so that he won't have\ntime to ask for any report.\"\n\n\"All right,\" was the reply. \"But just the same, I'm going to get all the\nfun there is, being the favourite of a boss!\"\n\nAnd so, early the next morning when Hal went to his work he proceeded to\n\"sprain his wrist.\" He walked about in pain, to the great concern of Old\nMike; and when finally he decided that he would have to lay off, Mike\nfollowed him half way to the shaft, giving him advice about hot and cold\ncloths. Leaving the old Slovak to struggle along as best he could alone,\nHal went out to bask in the wonderful sunshine of the upper world, and\nthe still more wonderful sunshine of a boss's favour.\n\nFirst he went to his room at Reminitsky's, and tied a strip of old shirt\nabout his wrist, and a clean handkerchief on top of that; by this symbol\nhe was entitled to the freedom of the camp and the sympathy of all men,\nand so he sallied forth.\n\nStrolling towards the tipple of Number One, he encountered a wiry,\nquick-moving little man, with restless black eyes and a lean,\nintelligent face. He wore a pair of common miner's \"jumpers,\" but even\nso, he was not to be taken for a workingman. Everything about him spoke\nof authority.\n\n\"Morning, Mr. Cartwright,\" said Hal.\n\n\"Good morning,\" replied the superintendent; then, with a glance at Hal's\nbandage, \"You hurt?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Just a bit of sprain, but I thought I'd better lay off.\"\n\n\"Been to the doctor?\"\n\n\"No, sir. I don't think it's that bad.\"\n\n\"You'd better go. You never know how bad a sprain is.\"\n\n\"Right, sir,\" said Hal. Then, as the superintendent was passing, \"Do you\nthink, Mr. Cartwright, that MacDougall stands any chance of being\nelected?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied the other, surprised. \"I hope not. You aren't\ngoing to vote for him, are you?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. I'm a Republican--born that way. But I wondered if you'd heard\nany MacDougall talk.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm hardly the one that would hear it. You take an interest in\npolitics?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir--in a way. In fact, that's how I came to get this wrist.\"\n\n\"How's that? In a fight?\"\n\n\"No, sir; but you see, Mr. Stone wanted me to feel out sentiment in the\ncamp, and he told me I'd better sprain my wrist and lay off.\"\n\nThe \"super,\" after staring at Hal, could not keep from laughing. Then he\nlooked about him. \"You want to be careful, talking about such things.\"\n\n\"I thought I could surely trust the superintendent,\" said Hal, drily.\n\nThe other measured him with his keen eyes; and Hal, who was getting the\nspirit of political democracy, took the liberty of returning the gaze.\n\"You're a wide-awake young fellow,\" said Cartwright, at last. \"Learn the\nropes here, and make yourself useful, and I'll see you're not passed\nover.\"\n\n\"All right, sir--thank you.\"\n\n\"Maybe you'll be made an election-clerk this time. That's worth three\ndollars a day, you know.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\" And Hal put on his smile again. \"They tell me you're\nthe mayor of North Valley.\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"And the justice of the peace is a clerk in your store. Well, Mr.\nCartwright, if you need a president of the board of health or a dog\ncatcher, I'm your man--as soon, that is, as my wrist gets well.\"\n\nAnd so Hal went on his way. Such \"joshing\" on the part of a \"buddy\" was\nof course absurdly presumptuous; the superintendent stood looking after\nhim with a puzzled frown upon his face.\n\n\n\nSECTION 7.\n\nHal did not look back, but turned into the company-store. \"North Valley\nTrading Company\" read the sign over the door; within was a Serbian woman\npointing out what she wanted to buy, and two little Lithuanian girls\nwatching the weighing of a pound of sugar. Hal strolled up to the person\nwho was doing the weighing, a middle-aged man with a yellow moustache\nstained with tobacco-juice. \"Morning, Judge.\"\n\n\"Huh!\" was the reply from Silas Adams, justice of the peace in the town\nof North Valley.\n\n\"Judge,\" said Hal, \"what do you think about the election?\"\n\n\"I don't think about it,\" said the other. \"Busy weighin' sugar.\"\n\n\"Anybody round here going to vote for MacDougall?\"\n\n\"They better not tell me if they are!\"\n\n\"What?\" smiled Hal. \"In this free American republic?\"\n\n\"In this part of the free American republic a man is free to dig coal,\nbut not to vote for a skunk like MacDougall.\" Then, having tied up the\nsugar, the \"J. P.\" whittled off a fresh chew from his plug, and turned\nto Hal. \"What'll you have?\"\n\nHal purchased half a pound of dried peaches, so that he might have an\nexcuse to loiter, and be able to keep time with the jaws of the Judge.\nWhile the order was being filled, he seated himself upon the counter.\n\"You know,\" said he, \"I used to work in a grocery.\"\n\n\"That so? Where at?\"\n\n\"Peterson & Co., in American City.\" Hal had told this so often that he\nhad begun to believe it.\n\n\"Pay pretty good up there?\"\n\n\"Yes, pretty fair.\" Then, realising that he had no idea what would\nconstitute good pay in a grocery, Hal added, quickly, \"Got a bad wrist\nhere!\"\n\n\"That so?\" said the other.\n\nHe did not show much sociability; but Hal persisted, refusing to believe\nthat any one in a country store would miss an opening to discuss\npolitics, even with a miner's helper. \"Tell me,\" said he, \"just what is\nthe matter with MacDougall?\"\n\n\"The matter with him,\" said the Judge, \"is that the company's against\nhim.\" He looked hard at the young miner. \"You meddlin' in politics?\" he\ngrowled. But the young miner's gay brown eyes showed only appreciation\nof the earlier response; so the \"J. P.\" was tempted into specifying the\nwould-be congressman's vices. Thus conversation started; and pretty soon\nthe others in the store joined in--\"Bob\" Johnson, bookkeeper and\npost-master, and \"Jake\" Predovich, the Galician Jew who was a member of\nthe local school-board, and knew the words for staple groceries in\nfifteen languages.\n\nHal listened to an exposition of the crimes of the political opposition\nin Pedro County. Their candidate, MacDougall, had come to the state as a\n\"tin-horn gambler,\" yet now he was going around making speeches in\nchurches, and talking about the moral sentiment of the community. \"And\nhim with a district chairman keeping three families in Pedro!\" declared\nSi Adams.\n\n\"Well,\" ventured Hal, \"if what I hear is true, the Republican chairman\nisn't a plaster saint. They say he was drunk at the convention--\"\n\n\"Maybe so,\" said the \"J. P.\" \"But we ain't playin' for the prohibition\nvote; and we ain't playin' for the labour vote--tryin' to stir up the\nriff-raff in these coal-camps, promisin' 'em high wages an' short hours.\nDon't he know he can't get it for 'em? But he figgers he'll go off to\nWashington and leave us here to deal with the mess he's stirred up!\"\n\n\"Don't you fret,\" put in Bob Johnson--\"he ain't goin' to no Washin'ton.\"\n\nThe other two agreed, and Hal ventured again, \"He says you stuff the\nballot-boxes.\"\n\n\"What do you suppose his crowd is doin' in the cities? We got to meet\n'em some way, ain't we?\"\n\n\"Oh, I see,\" said Hal, na\u00c3\u00afvely. \"You stuff them worse!\"\n\n\"Sometimes we stuff the boxes, and sometimes we stuff the voters.\" There\nwas an appreciative titter from the others, and the \"J. P.\" was moved to\nreminiscence. \"Two years ago I was election clerk, over to Sheridan, and\nwe found we'd let 'em get ahead of us--they had carried the whole state.\n'By God,' said Alf. Raymond, 'we'll show 'em a trick from the\ncoal-counties! And there won't be no recount business either!' So we\nheld back our returns till the rest had come in, and when we seen how\nmany votes we needed, we wrote 'em down. And that settled it.\"\n\n\"That seems a simple method,\" remarked Hal. \"They'll have to get up\nearly to beat Alf.\"\n\n\"You bet you!\" said Si, with the complacency of one of the gang. \"They\ncall this county the 'Empire of Raymond.'\"\n\n\"It must be a cinch,\" said Hal--\"being the sheriff, and having the\nnaming of so many deputies as they need in these coal-camps!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed the other. \"And there's his wholesale liquor business,\ntoo. If you want a license in Pedro county, you not only vote for Alf,\nbut you pay your bills on time!\"\n\n\"Must be a fortune in that!\" remarked Hal; and the Judge, the\nPost-master and the School-commissioner appeared like children listening\nto a story of a feast. \"You bet you!\"\n\n\"I suppose it takes money to run politics in this county,\" Hal added.\n\n\"Well, Alf don't put none of it up, you can bet! That's the company's\njob.\"\n\nThis from the Judge; and the School-commissioner added, \"De coin in dese\ncamps is beer.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see!\" laughed Hal. \"The companies buy Alf's beer, and use it to\nget him votes!\"\n\n\"Sure thing!\" said the Post-master.\n\nAt this moment he happened to reach into his pocket for a cigar, and Hal\nobserved a silver shield on the breast of his waistcoat. \"That a\ndeputy's badge?\" he inquired, and then turned to examine the\nSchool-commissioner's costume. \"Where's yours?\"\n\n\"I git mine ven election comes,\" said Jake, with a grin.\n\n\"And yours, Judge?\"\n\n\"I'm a justice of the peace, young feller,\" said Silas, with dignity.\n\nLeaning round, and observing a bulge on the right hip of the\nSchool-commissioner, Hal put out his hand towards it. Instinctively the\nother moved his hand to the spot.\n\nHal turned to the Post-master. \"Yours?\" he asked.\n\n\"Mine's under the counter,\" grinned Bob.\n\n\"And yours, Judge?\"\n\n\"Mine's in the desk,\" said the Judge.\n\nHal drew a breath. \"Gee!\" said he. \"It's like a steel trap!\" He managed\nto keep the laugh on his face, but within he was conscious of other\nfeelings than those of amusement. He was losing that \"first fine\ncareless rapture\" with which he had set out to run with the hare and the\nhounds in North Valley!\n\n\n\nSECTION 8.\n\nTwo days after this beginning of Hal's political career, it was arranged\nthat the workers who were to make a demand for a check-weighman should\nmeet in the home of Mrs. David. When Mike Sikoria came up from the pit\nthat day, Hal took him aside and told him of the gathering. A look of\ndelight came upon the old Slovak's face as he listened; he grabbed his\nbuddy by the shoulders, crying, \"You mean it?\"\n\n\"Sure meant it,\" said Hal. \"You want to be on the committee to go and\nsee the boss?\"\n\n\"_Pluha biedna_!\" cried Mike--which is something dreadful in his own\nlanguage. \"By Judas, I pack up my old box again!\"\n\nHal felt a guilty pang. Should he let this old man into the thing? \"You\nthink you'll have to move out of camp?\" he asked.\n\n\"Move out of state this time! Move back to old country, maybe!\" And Hal\nrealised that he could not stop him now, even if he wanted to. The old\nfellow was so much excited that he hardly ate any supper, and his buddy\nwas afraid to leave him alone, for fear he might blurt out the news.\n\nIt had been agreed that those who attended the meeting should come one\nby one, and by different routes. Hal was one of the first to arrive, and\nhe saw that the shades of the house had been drawn, and the lamps turned\nlow. He entered by the back door, where \"Big Jack\" David stood on guard.\n\"Big Jack,\" who had been a member of the South Wales Federation at home,\nmade sure of Hal's identity, and then passed him in without a word.\n\nInside was Mike--the first on hand. Mrs. David, a little black-eyed\nwoman with a never-ceasing tongue, was bustling about, putting things in\norder; she was so nervous that she could not sit still. This couple had\ncome from their birth-place only a year or so ago, and had brought all\ntheir wedding presents to their new home--pictures and bric-a-brac and\nlinen. It was the prettiest home Hal had so far been in, and Mrs. David\nwas risking it deliberately, because of her indignation that her husband\nhad had to foreswear his union in order to get work in America.\n\nThe young Italian, Rovetta, came, then old John Edstrom. There being not\nchairs enough in the house, Mrs. David had set some boxes against the\nwall, covering them with cloth; and Hal noticed that each person took\none of these boxes, leaving the chairs for the later comers. Each one as\nhe came in would nod to the others, and then silence would fall again.\n\nWhen Mary Burke entered, Hal divined from her aspect and manner that she\nhad sunk back into her old mood of pessimism. He felt a momentary\nresentment. He was so thrilled with this adventure; he wanted everybody\nelse to be thrilled--especially Mary! Like every one who has not\nsuffered much, he was repelled by a condition of perpetual suffering in\nanother. Of course Mary had good reasons for her black moods--but she\nherself considered it necessary to apologise for what she called her\n\"complainin'\"! She knew that he wanted her to help encourage the others;\nbut here she was, putting herself in a corner and watching this\nwonderful proceeding, as if she had said: \"I'm an ant, and I stay in\nline--but I'll not pretend I have any hope in it!\"\n\nRosa and Jerry had insisted on coming, in spite of Hal's offer to spare\nthem. After them came the Bulgarian, Wresmak; then the Polacks, Klowoski\nand Zamierowski. Hal found these difficult names to remember, but the\nPolacks were not at all sensitive about this; they would grin\ngood-naturedly while he practised, nor would they mind if he gave it up\nand called them Tony and Pete. They were humble men, accustomed all\ntheir lives to being driven about. Hal looked from one to another of\ntheir bowed forms and toil-worn faces, appearing more than ever sombre\nand mournful in the dim light; he wondered if the cruel persecution\nwhich had driven them to protest would suffice to hold them in line.\n\nOnce a newcomer, having misunderstood the orders, came to the front door\nand knocked; and Hal noted that every one started, and some rose to\ntheir feet in alarm. Again he recognised the atmosphere of novels of\nRussian revolutionary life. He had to remind himself that these men and\nwomen, gathered here like criminals, were merely planning to ask for a\nright guaranteed them by the law!\n\nThe last to come was an Austrian miner named Huszar, with whom Olson had\ngot into touch. Then, it being time to begin, everybody looked uneasily\nat everybody else. Few of them had conspired before, and they did not\nknow quite how to set about it. Olson, the one who would naturally have\nbeen their leader, had deliberately stayed away. They must run this\ncheck-weighman affair for themselves!\n\n\"Somebody talk,\" said Mrs. David at last; and then, as the silence\ncontinued, she turned to Hal. \"You're going to be the check-weighman.\nYou talk.\"\n\n\"I'm the youngest man here,\" said Hal, with a smile. \"Some older fellow\ntalk.\"\n\nBut nobody else smiled. \"Go on!\" exclaimed old Mike; and so at last Hal\nstood up. It was something he was to experience many times in the\nfuture; because he was an American, and educated, he was forced into a\nposition of leadership.\n\n\"As I understand it, you people want a check-weighman. Now, they tell me\nthe pay for a check-weighman should be three dollars a day, but we've\ngot only seven miners among us, and that's not enough. I will offer to\ntake the job for twenty-five cents a day from each man, which will make\na dollar-seventy-five, less than what I'm getting now as a buddy. If we\nget thirty men to come in, then I'll take ten cents a day from each, and\nmake the full three dollars. Does that seem fair?\"\n\n\"Sure!\" said Mike; and the others added their assent by word or nod.\n\n\"All right. Now, there's nobody that works in this mine but knows the\nmen don't get their weight. It would cost the company several hundred\ndollars a day to give us our weight, and nobody should be so foolish as\nto imagine they'll do it without a struggle. We've got to make up our\nminds to stand together.\"\n\n\"Sure, stand together!\" cried Mike.\n\n\"No get check-weighman!\" exclaimed Jerry, pessimistically.\n\n\"Not unless we try, Jerry,\" said Hal.\n\nAnd Mike thumped his knee. \"Sure try! And get him too!\"\n\n\"Right!\" cried \"Big Jack.\" But his little wife was not satisfied with\nthe response of the others. She gave Hal his first lesson in the\ndrilling of these polyglot masses.\n\n\"Talk to them. Make them understand you!\" And she pointed them out one\nby one with her finger: \"You! You! Wresmak, here, and you, Klowoski, and\nyou, Zam--you other Polish fellow. Want check-weighman. Want to get all\nweight. Get all our money. Understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\"\n\n\"Get committee, go see super! Want check-weighman. Understand? Got to\nhave check-weighman! No back down, no scare.\"\n\n\"No--no scare!\" Klowoski, who understood some English, explained rapidly\nto Zamierowski; and Zamierowski, whose head was still plastered where\nJeff Cotton's revolver had hit it, nodded eagerly in assent. In spite of\nhis bruises, he would stand by the others, and face the boss.\n\nThis suggested another question. \"Who's going to do the talking to the\nboss?\"\n\n\"You do that,\" said Mrs. David, to Hal.\n\n\"But I'm the one that's to be paid. It's not for me to talk.\"\n\n\"No one else can do it right,\" declared the woman.\n\n\"Sure--got to be American feller!\" said Mike.\n\nBut Hal insisted. If he did the talking, it would look as if the\ncheck-weighman had been the source of the movement, and was engaged in\nmaking a good paying job for himself.\n\nThere was discussion back and forth, until finally John Edstrom spoke\nup. \"Put me on the committee.\"\n\n\"You?\" said Hal. \"But you'll be thrown out! And what will your wife do?\"\n\n\"I think my wife is going to die to-night,\" said Edstrom, simply.\n\nHe sat with his lips set tightly, looking straight before him. After a\npause he went on: \"If it isn't to-night, it will be to-morrow, the\ndoctor says; and after that, nothing will matter. I shall have to go\ndown to Pedro to bury her, and if I have to stay, it will make little\ndifference to me, so I might as well do what I can for the rest of you.\nI've been a miner all my life, and Mr. Cartwright knows it; that might\nhave some weight with him. Let Joe Smith and Sikoria and myself be the\nones to go and see him, and the rest of you wait, and don't give up your\njobs unless you have to.\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 9.\n\nHaving settled the matter of the committee, Hal told the assembly how\nAlec Stone had asked him to spy upon the men. He thought they should\nknow about it; the bosses might try to use it against him, as Olson had\nwarned. \"They may tell you I'm a traitor,\" he said. \"You must trust me.\"\n\n\"We trust you!\" exclaimed Mike, with fervour; and the others nodded\ntheir agreement.\n\n\"All right,\" Hal answered. \"You can rest sure of this one thing--if I\nget onto that tipple, you're going to get your weights!\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" cried \"Big Jack,\" in English fashion. And a murmur ran\nabout the room. They did not dare make much noise, but they made clear\nthat that was what they wanted.\n\nHal sat down, and began to unroll the bandage from his wrist. \"I guess\nI'm through with this,\" he said, and explained how he had come to wear\nit.\n\n\"What?\" cried Old Mike. \"You fool me like that?\" And he caught the\nwrist, and when he had made sure there was no sign of swelling upon it,\nhe shook it so that he almost sprained it really, laughing until the\ntears ran down his cheeks. \"You old son-of-a-gun!\" he exclaimed.\nMeantime Klowoski was telling the story to Zamierowski, and Jerry\nMinetti was explaining it to Wresmak, in the sort of pidgin-English\nwhich does duty in the camps. Hal had never seen such real laughter\nsince coming to North Valley.\n\nBut conspirators cannot lend themselves long to merriment. They came\nback to business again. It was agreed that the hour for the committee's\nvisit to the superintendent should be quitting-time on the morrow. And\nthen John Edstrom spoke, suggesting that they should agree upon their\ncourse of action in case they were offered violence.\n\n\"You think there's much chance of that?\" said some one.\n\n\"Sure there be!\" cried Mike Sikoria. \"One time in Cedar Mountain we go\nsee boss, say air-course blocked. What you think he do them fellers? He\nhit them one lick in nose, he kick them three times in behind, he run\nthem out!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Hal, \"if there's going to be anything like that, we must be\nready.\"\n\n\"What you do?\" demanded Jerry.\n\nIt was time for Hal's leadership. \"If he hits me one lick in the nose,\"\nhe declared, \"I'll hit him one lick in the nose, that's all.\"\n\nThere was a bit of applause at this. That was the way to talk! Hal\ntasted the joys of his leadership. But then his fine self-confidence met\nwith a sudden check--a \"lick in the nose\" of his pride, so to speak.\nThere came a woman's voice from the corner, low and grim: \"Yes! And get\nye'self killed for all your trouble!\"\n\nHe looked towards Mary Burke, and saw her vivid face, flushed and\nfrowning. \"What do you mean?\" he asked. \"Would you have us turn and run\naway?\"\n\n\"I would that!\" said she. \"Rather than have ye killed, I would! What'll\nye do if he pulls his gun on ye?\"\n\n\"Would he pull his gun on a committee?\"\n\nOld Mike broke in again. \"One time in Barela--ain't I told you how I\nlose my cars? I tell weigh-boss somebody steal my cars, and he pull gun\non me, and he say, 'Get the hell off that tipple, you old billy-goat, I\nshoot you full of holes!'\"\n\nAmong his class-mates at college, Hal had been wont to argue that the\nproper way to handle a burglar was to call out to him, saying, \"Go\nahead, old chap, and help yourself; there's nothing here I'm willing to\nget shot for.\" What was the value of anything a burglar could steal, in\ncomparison with a man's own life? And surely, one would have thought,\nthis was a good time to apply the plausible theory. But for some reason\nHal failed even to remember it. He was going ahead, precisely as if a\nton of coal per day was the one thing of consequence in life!\n\n\"What shall we do?\" he asked. \"We don't want to back out.\"\n\nBut even while he asked the question, Hal was realising that Mary was\nright. His was the attitude of the leisure-class person, used to having\nhis own way; but Mary, though she had a temper too, was pointing the\nlesson of self-control. It was the second time to-night that she had\ninjured his pride. But now he forgave her in his admiration; he had\nalways known that Mary had a mind and could help him! His admiration was\nincreased by what John Edstrom was saying--they must do nothing that\nwould injure the cause of the \"big union,\" and so they must resolve to\noffer no physical resistance, no matter what might be done to them.\n\nThere was vehement argument on the other side. \"We fight! We fight!\"\ndeclared Old Mike, and cried out suddenly, as if in anticipation of the\npain in his injured nose. \"You say me stand that?\"\n\n\"If you fight back,\" said Edstrom, \"we'll all get the worst of it. The\ncompany will say we started the trouble, and put us in the wrong. We've\ngot to make up our mind to rely on moral force.\"\n\nSo, after more discussion, it was agreed; every man would keep his\ntemper--that is, if he could! So they shook hands all round, pledging\nthemselves to stand firm. But, when the meeting was declared adjourned,\nand they stole out one by one into the night, they were a very sober and\nanxious lot of conspirators.\n\n\n\nSECTION 10.\n\nHal slept but little that night. Amid the sounds of the snoring of eight\nof Reminitsky's other boarders, he lay going over in his mind various\nthings which might happen on the morrow. Some of them were far from\npleasant things; he tried to picture himself with a broken nose, or with\ntar and feathers on him. He recalled his theory as to the handling of\nburglars. The \"G. F. C.\" was a burglar of gigantic and terrible\nproportions; surely this was a time to call out, \"Help yourself!\" But\ninstead of doing it, Hal thought about Edstrom's ants, and wondered at\nthe power which made them stay in line.\n\nWhen morning came, he went up into the mountains, where a man may wander\nand renew his moral force. When the sun had descended behind the\nmountain-tops, he descended also, and met Edstrom and Sikoria in front\nof the company office.\n\nThey nodded a greeting, and Edstrom told Hal that his wife had died\nduring the day. There being no undertaker in North Valley, he had\narranged for a woman friend to take the body down to Pedro, so that he\nmight be free for the interview with Cartwright. Hal put his hand on the\nold man's shoulder, but attempted no word of condolence; he saw that\nEdstrom had faced the trouble and was ready for duty.\n\n\"Come ahead,\" said the old man, and the three went into the office.\nWhile a clerk took their message to the inner office, they stood for a\ncouple of minutes, shifting uneasily from one foot to the other, and\nturning their caps in their hands in the familiar manner of the lowly.\n\nAt last Mr. Cartwright appeared in the doorway, his small sparely-built\nfigure eloquent of sharp authority. \"Well, what's this?\" he inquired.\n\n\"If you please,\" said Edstrom, \"we'd like to speak to you. We've\ndecided, sir, that we want to have a check-weighman.\"\n\n\"_What_?\" The word came like the snap of a whip.\n\n\"We'd like to have a check-weighman, sir.\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence. \"Come in here.\" They filed into the inner\noffice, and he shut the door.\n\n\"Now. What's this?\"\n\nEdstrom repeated his words again.\n\n\"What put that notion into your heads?\"\n\n\"Nothing, sir; only we thought we'd be better satisfied.\"\n\n\"You think you're not getting your weight?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, you see--some of the men--we think it would be better if we\nhad the check-weighman. We're willing to pay for him.\"\n\n\"Who's this check-weighman to be?\"\n\n\"Joe Smith, here.\"\n\nHal braced himself to meet the other's stare. \"Oh! So it's you!\" Then,\nafter a moment, \"So that's why you were feeling so gay!\"\n\nHal was not feeling in the least gay at the moment; but he forebore to\nsay so. There was a silence.\n\n\"Now, why do you fellows want to throw away your money?\" The\nsuperintendent started to argue with them, showing the absurdity of the\nnotion that they could gain anything by such a course. The mine had been\nrunning for years on its present system, and there had never been any\ncomplaint. The idea that a company as big and as responsible as the \"G.\nF. C.\" would stoop to cheat its workers out of a few tons of coal! And\nso on, for several minutes.\n\n\"Mr. Cartwright,\" said Edstrom, when the other had finished, \"you know\nI've worked all my life in mines, and most of it in this district. I am\ntelling you something I know when I say there is general dissatisfaction\nthroughout these camps because the men feel they are not getting their\nweight. You say there has been no public complaint; you understand the\nreason for this--\"\n\n\"What is the reason?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Edstrom, gently, \"maybe you don't know the reason--but\nanyway we've decided that we want a check-weighman.\"\n\nIt was evident that the superintendent had been taken by surprise, and\nwas uncertain how to meet the issue. \"You can imagine,\" he said, at\nlast, \"the company doesn't relish hearing that its men believe it's\ncheating them--\"\n\n\"We don't say the company knows anything about it, Mr. Cartwright. It's\npossible that some people may be taking advantage of us, without either\nthe company or yourself having anything to do with it. It's for your\nprotection as well as ours that a check-weighman is needed.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the other, drily. His tone revealed that he was\nholding himself in by an effort. \"Very well,\" he added, at last. \"That's\nenough about the matter, if your minds are made up. I'll give you my\ndecision later.\"\n\nThis was a dismissal, and Mike Sikoria turned humbly, and started to the\ndoor. But Edstrom was one of the ants that did not readily \"step one\nside\"; and Mike took a glance at him, and then stepped back into line in\na hurry, as if hoping his delinquency had not been noted.\n\n\"If you please, Mr. Cartwright,\" said Edstrom, \"we'd like your decision,\nso as to have the check-weighman start in the morning.\"\n\n\"What? You're in such a hurry?\"\n\n\"There's no reason for delay, sir. We've selected our man, and we're\nready to pay him.\"\n\n\"Who are the men who are ready to pay him? Just you two\"\n\n\"I am not at liberty to name the other men, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh! So it's a secret movement!\"\n\n\"In a way--yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said the superintendent, ominously. \"And you don't care what\nthe company thinks about it!\"\n\n\"It's not that, Mr. Cartwright, but we don't see anything for the\ncompany to object to. It's a simple business arrangement--\"\n\n\"Well, if it seems simple to you, it doesn't to me,\" snapped the other.\nAnd then, getting himself in hand, \"Understand me, the company would not\nhave the least objection to the men making sure of their weights, if\nthey really think it's necessary. The company has always been willing to\ndo the right thing. But it's not a matter that can be settled off hand.\nI will let you know later.\"\n\nAgain they were dismissed, and again Old Mike turned, and Edstrom also.\nBut now another ant sprang into the ditch. \"Just when will you be\nprepared to let the check-weighman begin work, Mr. Cartwright?\" asked\nHal.\n\nThe superintendent gave him a sharp look, and again it could be seen\nthat he made a strong effort to keep his temper. \"I'm not prepared to\nsay,\" he replied. \"I will let you know, as soon as convenient to me.\nThat's all now.\" And as he spoke he opened the door, putting something\ninto the action that was a command.\n\n\"Mr. Cartwright,\" said Hal, \"there's no law against our having a\ncheck-weighman, is there?\"\n\nThe look which these words drew from the superintendent showed that he\nknew full well what the law was. Hal accepted this look as an answer,\nand continued, \"I have been selected by a committee of the men to act as\ntheir check-weighman, and this committee has duly notified the company.\nThat makes me a check-weighman, I believe, Mr. Cartwright, and so all I\nhave to do is to assume my duties.\" Without waiting for the\nsuperintendent's answer, he walked to the door, followed by his somewhat\nshocked companions.\n\n\n\nSECTION 11.\n\nAt the meeting on the night before it had been agreed to spread the news\nof the check-weighman movement, for the sake of its propaganda value. So\nnow when the three men came out from the office, there was a crowd\nwaiting to know what had happened; men clamoured questions, and each one\nwho got the story would be surrounded by others eager to hear. Hal made\nhis way to the boarding-house, and when he had finished his supper, he\nset out from place to place in the camp, telling the men about the\ncheck-weighman plan and explaining that it was a legal right they were\ndemanding. All this while Old Mike stayed on one side of him, and\nEdstrom on the other; for Tom Olson had insisted strenuously that Hal\nshould not be left alone for a moment. Evidently the bosses had given\nthe same order; for when Hal came out from Reminitsky's, there was\n\"Jake\" Predovich, the store-clerk, on the fringe of the crowd, and he\nfollowed wherever Hal went, doubtless making note of every one he spoke\nto.\n\nThey consulted as to where they were to spend the night. Old Mike was\nnervous, taking the activities of the spy to mean that they were to be\nthugged in the darkness. He told horrible stories of that sort of thing.\nWhat could be an easier way for the company to settle the matter? They\nwould fix up some story; the world outside would believe they had been\nkilled in a drunken row, perhaps over some woman. This last suggestion\nespecially troubled Hal; he thought of the people at home. No, he must\nnot sleep in the village! And on the other hand he could not go down the\ncanyon, for if he once passed the gate, he might not be allowed to\nrepass it.\n\nAn idea occurred to him. Why not go _up_ the canyon? There was no\nstockade at the upper end of the village--nothing but wilderness and\nrocks, without even a road.\n\n\"But where we sleep?\" demanded Old Mike, aghast.\n\n\"Outdoors,\" said Hal.\n\n\"_Pluha biedna_! And get the night air into my bones?\"\n\n\"You think you keep the day air in your bones when you sleep inside?\"\nlaughed Hal.\n\n\"Why don't I, when I shut them windows tight, and cover up my bones?\"\n\n\"Well, risk the night air once,\" said Hal. \"It's better than having\nsomebody let it into you with a knife.\"\n\n\"But that fellow Predovich--he follow us up canyon too!\"\n\n\"Yes, but he's only one man, and we don't have to fear him. If he went\nback for others, he'd never be able to find us in the darkness.\"\n\nEdstrom, whose notions of anatomy were not so crude as Mike's, gave his\nsupport to this suggestion; so they got their blankets and stumbled up\nthe canyon in the still, star-lit night. For a while they heard the spy\nbehind them, but finally his footsteps died away, and after they had\nmoved on for some distance, they believed they were safe till daylight.\nHal had slept out many a night as a hunter, but it was a new adventure\nto sleep out as the game!\n\nAt dawn they rose, and shook the dew from their blankets, and wiped it\nfrom their eyes. Hal was young, and saw the glory of the morning, while\npoor Mike Sikoria groaned and grumbled over his stiff and aged joints.\nHe thought he had ruined himself forever, but he took courage at\nEdstrom's mention of coffee, and they hurried down to breakfast at their\nboarding-house.\n\nNow came a critical time, when Hal had to be left by himself. Edstrom\nwas obliged to go down to see to his wife's funeral; and it was obvious\nthat if Mike Sikoria were to lay off work, he would be providing the\nboss with an excuse for firing him. The law which provided for a\ncheck-weighman had failed to provide for a check-weighman's body-guard!\n\nHal had announced his programme in that flash of defiance in\nCartwright's office. As soon as work started up, he went to the tipple.\n\"Mr. Peters,\" he said, to the tipple-boss, \"I've come to act as\ncheck-weighman.\"\n\nThe tipple-boss was a man with a big black moustache, which made him\nlook like the pictures of Nietzsche. He stared at Hal, frankly\ndumbfounded. \"What the devil?\" said he.\n\n\"Some of the men have chosen me check-weighman,\" explained Hal, in a\nbusiness-like manner. \"When their cars come up, I'll see to their\nweights.\"\n\n\"You keep off this tipple, young fellow!\" said Peters. His manner was\nequally business-like.\n\nSo the would-be check-weighman came out and sat on the steps to wait.\nThe tipple was a fairly public place, and he judged he was as safe there\nas anywhere. Some of the men grinned and winked at him as they went\nabout their work; several found a chance to whisper words of\nencouragement. And all morning he sat, like a protestant at the\npalace-gates of a mandarin in China, It was tedious work, but he\nbelieved that he would be able to stand it longer than the company.\n\n\n\nSECTION 12.\n\nIn the middle of the morning a man came up to him--\"Bud\" Adams, a\nyounger brother of the \"J. P.,\" and Jeff Cotton's assistant. Bud was\nstocky, red-faced, and reputed to be handy with his fists. So Hal rose\nup warily when he saw him.\n\n\"Hey, you,\" said Bud. \"There's a telegram at the office for you.\"\n\n\"For me?\"\n\n\"Your name's Joe Smith, ain't it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, that's what it says.\"\n\nHal considered for a moment. There was no one to be telegraphing Joe\nSmith. It was only a ruse to get him away.\n\n\"What's in the telegram?\" he asked.\n\n\"How do I know?\" said Bud.\n\n\"Where is it from?\"\n\n\"I dunno that.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Hal, \"you might bring it to me here.\"\n\nThe other's eyes flew open. This was not a revolt, it was a revolution!\n\"Who the hell's messenger boy do you think I am?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Don't the company deliver telegrams?\" countered Hal, politely. And Bud\nstood struggling with his human impulses, while Hal watched him\ncautiously. But apparently those who had sent the messenger had given\nhim precise instructions; for he controlled his wrath, and turned and\nstrode away.\n\nHal continued his vigil. He had his lunch with him; and was prepared to\neat alone--understanding the risk that a man would be running who showed\nsympathy with him. He was surprised, therefore, when Johannson, the\ngiant Swede, came and sat down by his side. There also came a young\nMexican labourer, and a Greek miner. The revolution was spreading!\n\nHal felt sure the company would not let this go on. And sure enough,\ntowards the middle of the afternoon, the tipple-boss came out and\nbeckoned to him. \"Come here, you!\" And Hal went in.\n\nThe \"weigh-room\" was a fairly open place; but at one side was a door\ninto an office. \"This way,\" said the man.\n\nBut Hal stopped where he was.\n\n\"This is where the check-weighman belongs, Mr. Peters.\"\n\n\"But I want to talk to you.\"\n\n\"I can hear you, sir.\" Hal was in sight of the men, and he knew that was\nhis only protection.\n\nThe tipple-boss went back into the office; and a minute later Hal saw\nwhat had been intended. The door opened and Alec Stone came out.\n\nHe stood for a moment looking at his political henchman. Then he came\nup. \"Kid,\" he said, in a low voice, \"you're overdoing this. I didn't\nintend you to go so far.\"\n\n\"This is not what you intended, Mr. Stone,\" answered Hal.\n\nThe pit-boss came closer yet. \"What you looking for, kid? What you\nexpect to get out of this?\"\n\nHal's gaze was unwavering. \"Experience,\" he replied.\n\n\"You're feeling smart, sonny. But you'd better stop and realise what\nyou're up against. You ain't going to get away with it, you know; get\nthat through your head--you ain't going to get away with it. You'd\nbetter come in and have a talk with me.\"\n\nThere was a silence.\n\n\"Don't you know how it'll be, Smith? These little fires start up--but we\nput 'em out. We know how to do it, we've got the machinery. It'll all be\nforgotten in a week or two, and then where'll you be at? Can't you see?\"\n\nAs Hal still made no reply, the other's voice dropped lower. \"I\nunderstand your position. Just give me a nod, and it'll be all right.\nYou tell the men that you've watched the weights, and that they're all\nright. They'll be satisfied, and you and me can fix it up later.\"\n\n\"Mr. Stone,\" said Hal, with intense gravity, \"am I correct in the\nimpression that you are offering me a bribe?\"\n\nIn a flash, the man's self-control vanished. He thrust his huge fist\nwithin an inch of Hal's nose, and uttered a foul oath. But Hal did not\nremove his nose from the danger-zone, and over the fist a pair of angry\nbrown eyes gazed at the pit-boss. \"Mr. Stone, you had better realise\nthis situation. I am in dead earnest about this matter, and I don't\nthink it will be safe for you to offer me violence.\"\n\nFor a moment or two the man continued to glare at Hal; but it appeared\nthat he, like Bud Adams, had been given instructions. He turned abruptly\nand strode back into the office.\n\nHal stood for a bit, until he had made sure of his composure. After\nwhich he strolled over towards the scales. A difficulty had occurred to\nhim for the first time--that he did not know anything about the working\nof coal-scales.\n\nBut he was given no time to learn. The tipple-boss reappeared. \"Get out\nof here, fellow!\" said he.\n\n\"But you invited me in,\" remarked Hal, mildly.\n\n\"Well, now I invite you out again.\"\n\nAnd so the protestant resumed his vigil at the mandarin's palace-gates.\n\n\n\nSECTION 13.\n\nWhen the quitting-whistle blew, Mike Sikoria came quickly to join Hal\nand hear what had happened. Mike was exultant, for several new men had\ncome up to him and offered to join the check-weighman movement. The old\nfellow was not sure whether this was owing to his own eloquence as a\npropagandist, or to the fine young American buddy he had; but in either\ncase he was equally proud. He gave Hal a note which had been slipped\ninto his hand, and which Hal recognised as coming from Tom Olson. The\norganiser reported that every one in the camp was talking\ncheck-weighman, and so from a propaganda standpoint they could count\ntheir move a success, no matter what the bosses might do. He added that\nHal should have a number of men stay with him that night, so as to have\nwitnesses if the company tried to \"pull off anything.\" \"And be careful\nof the new men,\" he added; \"one or two of them are sure to be spies.\"\n\nHal and Mike discussed their programme for the second night. Neither of\nthem were keen for sleeping out again--the old Slovak because of his\nbones, and Hal because he saw there were now several spies following\nthem about. At Reminitsky's, he spoke to some of those who had offered\ntheir support, and asked them if they would be willing to spend the\nnight with him in Edstrom's cabin. Not one shrank from this test of\nsincerity; they all got their blankets, and repaired to the place, where\nHal lighted the lamp and held an impromptu check-weighman meeting--and\nincidentally entertained himself with a spy-hunt!\n\nOne of the new-comers was a Pole named Wojecicowski; this, on top of\nZamierowski, caused Hal to give up all effort to call the Poles by their\nnames. \"Woji\" was an earnest little man, with a pathetic, tired face. He\nexplained his presence by the statement that he was sick of being\nrobbed; he would pay his share for a check-weighman, and if they fired\nhim, all right, he would move on, and to hell with them. After which\ndeclaration he rolled up in a blanket and went to snoring on the floor\nof the cabin. That did not seem to be exactly the conduct of a spy.\n\nAnother was an Italian, named Farenzena; a dark-browed and\nsinister-looking fellow, who might have served as a villain in any\nmelodrama. He sat against the wall and talked in guttural tones, and Hal\nregarded him with deep suspicion. It was not easy to understand his\nEnglish, but finally Hal managed to make out the story he was\ntelling--that he was in love with a \"fanciulla,\" and that the\n\"fanciulla\" was playing with him. He had about made up his mind that she\nwas a coquette, and not worth bothering with, so he did not care any\ncurses if they sent him down the canyon. \"Don't fight for fanciulla,\nfight for check-weighman!\" he concluded, with a growl.\n\nAnother volunteer was a Greek labourer, a talkative young chap who had\nsat with Hal at lunch-time, and had given his name as Apostolikas. He\nentered into fluent conversation with Hal, explaining how much\ninterested he was in the check-weighman plan; he wanted to know just\nwhat they were going to do, what chance of success they thought they\nhad, who had started the movement and who was in it. Hal's replies took\nthe form of little sermons on working-class solidarity. Each time the\nman would start to \"pump\" him, Hal would explain the importance of the\npresent issue to the miners, how they must stand by one another and make\nsacrifices for the good of all. After he had talked abstract theories\nfor half an hour, Apostolikas gave up and moved on to Mike Sikoria, who,\nhaving been given a wink by Hal, talked about \"scabs,\" and the dreadful\nthings that honest workingmen would do to them. When finally the Greek\ngrew tired again, and lay down on the floor, Hal moved over to Old Mike\nand whispered that the first name of Apostolikas must be Judas!\n\n\n\nSECTION 14.\n\nOld Mike went to sleep quickly; but Hal had not worked for several days,\nand had exciting thoughts to keep him awake. He had been lying quiet for\na couple of hours, when he became aware that some one was moving in the\nroom. There was a lamp burning dimly, and through half-closed eyes he\nmade out one of the men lifting himself to a sitting position. At first\nhe could not be sure which one it was, but finally he recognised the\nGreek.\n\nHal lay motionless, and after a minute or so he stole another look and\nsaw the man crouching and listening, his hands still on the floor.\nThrough half opened eye-lids Hal continued to steal glimpses, while the\nother rose and tip-toed towards him, stepping carefully over the\nsleeping forms.\n\nHal did his best to simulate the breathing of sleep: no easy matter,\nwith the man stooping over him, and a knife-thrust as one of the\npossibilities of the situation. He took the chance, however; and after\nwhat seemed an age, he felt the man's fingers lightly touch his side.\nThey moved down to his coat-pocket.\n\n\"Going to search me!\" thought Hal; and waited, expecting the hand to\ntravel to other pockets. But after what seemed an interminable period,\nhe realised that Apostolikas had risen again, and was stepping back to\nhis place. In a minute more he had lain down, and all was still in the\ncabin.\n\nHal's hand moved to the pocket, and his fingers slid inside. They\ntouched something, which he recognised instantly as a roll of bills.\n\n\"I see!\" thought he. \"A frame-up!\" And he laughed to himself, his mind\ngoing back to early boyhood--to a dilapidated trunk in the attic of his\nhome, containing story-books that his father had owned. He could see\nthem now, with their worn brown covers and crude pictures: \"The Luck and\nPluck Series,\" by Horatio Alger; \"Live or Die,\" \"Rough and Ready,\" etc.\nHow he had thrilled over the story of the country-boy who comes to the\ncity, and meets the villain who robs his employer's cash-drawer and\ndrops the key of it into the hero's pocket! Evidently some one connected\nwith the General Fuel Company had read Horatio Alger!\n\nHal realised that he could not be too quick about getting those bills\nout of his pocket. He thought of returning them to \"Judas,\" but decided\nthat he would save them for Edstrom, who was likely to need money before\nlong. He gave the Greek half an hour to go to sleep, then with his\npocket-knife he gently picked out a hole in the cinders of the floor and\nburied the money as best he could. After which he wormed his way to\nanother place, and lay thinking.\n\n\n\nSECTION 15.\n\nWould they wait until morning, or would they come soon? He was inclined\nto the latter guess, so he was only slightly startled when, an hour or\ntwo later, he heard the knob of the cabin-door turned. A moment later\ncame a crash and the door was burst open, with the shoulder of a heavy\nman behind it.\n\nThe room was in confusion in a second. Men sprang to their feet, crying\nout; others sat up bewildered, still half asleep. The room was bright\nfrom an electric torch in the hands of one of the invaders. \"There's the\nfellow!\" cried a voice, which Hal instantly recognised as belonging to\nJeff Cotton, the camp-marshal. \"Stick 'em up, there! You, Joe Smith!\"\nHal did not wait to see the glint of the marshal's revolver.\n\nThere followed a silence. As this drama was being staged for the benefit\nof the other men, it was necessary to give them time to get thoroughly\nawake, and to get their eyes used to the light. Meantime Hal stood, his\nhands in the air. Behind the torch he could make out the faces of the\nmarshal, Bud Adams, Alec Stone, Jake Predovich, and two or three others.\n\n\"Now, men,\" said Cotton, at last, \"you are some of the fellows that want\na check-weighman. And this is the man you chose. Is that right?\"\n\nThere was no answer.\n\n\"I'm going to show you the kind of fellow he is. He came to Mr. Stone\nhere and offered to sell you out.\"\n\n\"It's a lie, men,\" said Hal, quietly.\n\n\"He took some money from Mr. Stone to sell you out!\" insisted the\nmarshal.\n\n\"It's a lie,\" said Hal, again.\n\n\"He's got that money now!\" cried the other.\n\nAnd Hal cried, in turn, \"They are trying to frame something on me, boys!\nDon't let them fool you!\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" commanded the marshal; then, to the men, \"I'll show you. I\nthink he's got that money on him now. Jake, search him.\"\n\nThe store-clerk advanced.\n\n\"Watch out, boys!\" exclaimed Hal. \"They will put something in my\npockets.\" And then to Old Mike, who had started angrily forward, \"It's\nall right, Mike! Let them alone!\"\n\n\"Jake, take off your coat,\" ordered Cotton. \"Roll up your sleeves. Show\nyour hands.\"\n\nIt was for all the world like the performance of a prestidigitator. The\nlittle Jew took off his coat and rolled up his sleeves above his elbows.\nHe exhibited his hands to the audience, turning them this way and that;\nthen, keeping them out in front of him, he came slowly towards Hal, like\na hypnotist about to put him to sleep.\n\n\"Watch him!\" said Cotton. \"He's got that money on him, I know.\"\n\n\"Look sharp!\" cried Hal. \"If it isn't there, they'll put it there.\"\n\n\"Keep your hands up, young fellow,\" commanded the marshal. \"Keep back\nfrom him there!\" This last to Mike Sikoria and the other spectators, who\nwere pressing nearer, peering over one another's shoulders.\n\nIt was all very serious at the time, but afterwards, when Hal recalled\nthe scene, he laughed over the grotesque figure of Predovich searching\nhis pockets while keeping as far away from him as possible, so that\nevery one might know that the money had actually come out of Hal's\npocket. The searcher put his hands first in the inside pockets, then in\nthe pockets of Hal's shirt. Time was needed to build up this climax!\n\n\"Turn around,\" commanded Cotton; and Hal turned, and the Jew went\nthrough his trouser-pockets. He took out in turn Hal's watch, his comb\nand mirror, his handkerchief; after examining them and holding them up,\nhe dropped them onto the floor. There was a breathless hush when he came\nto Hal's purse, and proceeded to open it. Thanks to the greed of the\ncompany, there was nothing in the purse but some small change. Predovich\nclosed it and dropped it to the floor.\n\n\"Wait now! He's not through!\" cried the master of ceremonies. \"He's got\nthat money somewhere, boys! Did you look in his side-pockets, Jake?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Jake.\n\n\"Look sharp!\" cried the marshal; and every one craned forward eagerly,\nwhile Predovich stooped down on one knee, and put his hand into one coat\npocket and then into the other.\n\nHe took his hand out again, and the look of dismay upon his face was so\nobvious that Hal could hardly keep from laughing. \"It ain't dere!\" he\ndeclared.\n\n\"What?\" cried Cotton, and they stared at each other. \"By God, he's got\nrid of it!\"\n\n\"There's no money on me, boys!\" proclaimed Hal. \"It's a job they are\ntrying to put over on us.\"\n\n\"He's hid it!\" shouted the marshal. \"Find it, Jake!\"\n\nThen Predovich began to search again, swiftly, and with less\ncircumstance. He was not thinking so much about the spectators now, as\nabout all that good money gone for nothing! He made Hal take off his\ncoat, and ripped open the lining; he unbuttoned the trousers and felt\ninside; he thrust his fingers down inside Hal's shoes.\n\nBut there was no money, and the searchers were at a standstill. \"He took\ntwenty-five dollars from Mr. Stone to sell you out!\" declared the\nmarshal. \"He's managed to get rid of it somehow.\"\n\n\"Boys,\" cried Hal, \"they sent a spy in here, and told him to put money\non me.\" He was looking at Apostolikas as he spoke; he saw the man start\nand shrink back.\n\n\"That's him! He's a scab!\" cried Old Mike. \"He's got the money on him, I\nbet!\" And he made a move towards the Greek.\n\nSo the camp-marshal realised suddenly that it was time to ring down the\ncurtain on this drama. \"That's enough of this foolishness,\" he declared.\n\"Bring that fellow along here!\" And in a flash a couple of the party had\nseized Hal's wrists, and a third had grabbed him by the collar of his\nshirt. Before the miners had time to realise what was happening, they\nhad rushed their prisoner out of the cabin.\n\nThe quarter of an hour which followed was an uncomfortable one for the\nwould-be check-weighman. Outside, in the darkness, the camp-marshal was\nfree to give vent to his rage, and so was Alec Stone. They poured out\ncurses upon him, and kicked him and cuffed him as they went along. One\nof the men who held his wrists twisted his arm, until he cried out with\npain; then they cursed him harder, and bade him hold his mouth. Down the\ndark and silent street they went swiftly, and into the camp-marshal's\noffice, and upstairs to the room which served as the North Valley jail.\nHal was glad enough when they left him here, slamming the iron door\nbehind them.\n\n\n\nSECTION 16.\n\nIt had been a crude and stupid plot, yet Hal realised that it was\nadapted to the intelligence of the men for whom it was intended. But for\nthe accident that he had stayed awake, they would have found the money\non him, and next morning the whole camp would have heard that he had\nsold out. Of course his immediate friends, the members of the committee,\nwould not have believed it; but the mass of the workers would have\nbelieved it, and so the purpose of Tom Olson's visit to North Valley\nwould have been balked. Throughout the experiences which were to come to\nhim, Hal retained his vivid impression of that adventure; it served to\nhim as a symbol of many things. Just as the bosses had tried to bedevil\nhim, to destroy his influence with his followers, so later on he saw\nthem trying to bedevil the labour-movement, to confuse the intelligence\nof the whole country.\n\nNow Hal was in jail. He went to the window and tried the bars--but found\nthat they had been made for such trials. Then he groped his way about in\nthe darkness, examining his prison, which proved to be a steel cage\nbuilt inside the walls of an ordinary room. In one corner was a bench,\nand in another corner another bench, somewhat broader, with a mattress\nupon it. Hal had read a little about jails--enough to cause him to avoid\nthis mattress. He sat upon the bare bench, and began to think.\n\nIt is a fact that there is a peculiar psychology incidental to being in\njail; just as there is a peculiar psychology incidental to straining\nyour back and breaking your hands loading coal-cars in a five foot vein;\nand another, and quite different psychology, produced by living at ease\noff the labours of coal-miners. In a jail, you have first of all the\nsense of being an animal; the animal side of your being is emphasised,\nthe animal passions of hatred and fear are called into prominence, and\nif you are to escape being dominated by them, it can only be by intense\nand concentrated effort of the mind. So, if you are a thinking man, you\ndo a great deal of thinking in a jail; the days are long, and the nights\nstill longer--you have time for all the thoughts you can have.\n\nThe bench was hard, and seemed to grow harder. There was no position in\nwhich it could be made to grow soft. Hal got up and paced about, then he\nlay down for a while, then got up and walked again; and all the while he\nthought, and all the while the jail-psychology was being impressed upon\nhis mind.\n\nFirst, he thought about his immediate problem. What were they going to\ndo to him? The obvious thing would be to put him out of camp, and so be\ndone with him; but would they rest content with that, in their\nirritation at the trick he had played? Hal had heard vaguely of that\nnative American institution, the \"third degree,\" but had never had\noccasion to think of it as a possibility in his own life. What a\ndifference it made, to think of it in that way!\n\nHal had told Tom Olson that he would not pledge himself to organise a\nunion, but that he would pledge himself to get a check-weighman; and\nOlson had laughed, and seemed quite content--apparently assuming that it\nwould come to the same thing. And now, it rather seemed that Olson had\nknown what he was talking about. For Hal found his thoughts no longer\ntroubled with fears of labour union domination and walking delegate\ntyranny; on the contrary, he became suddenly willing for the people of\nNorth Valley to have a union, and to be as tyrannical as they knew how!\nAnd in this change, though Hal had no idea of it, he was repeating an\nexperience common among reformers; many of whom begin as mild and\nbenevolent advocates of some obvious bit of justice, and under the\noperation of the jail-psychology are made into blazing and determined\nrevolutionists. \"Eternal spirit of the chainless mind,\" says Byron.\n\"Greatest in dungeons Liberty thou art!\"\n\nThe poet goes on to add that \"When thy sons to fetters are confined--\"\nthen \"Freedom's fame finds wings on every wind.\" And just as it was in\nChillon, so it seemed to be in North Valley. Dawn came, and Hal stood at\nthe window of his cell, and heard the whistle blow and saw the workers\ngoing to their tasks, the toil-bent, pallid faced creatures of the\nunderworld, like a file of baboons in the half-light. He waved his hand\nto them, and they stopped and stared, and then waved back; he realised\nthat every one of those men must be thinking about his imprisonment, and\nthe reason for it--and so the jail-psychology was being communicated to\nthem. If any of them cherished distrust of unions, or doubt of the need\nof organisation in North Valley--that distrust and that doubt were being\ndissipated!\n\n--There was only one thing discouraging about the matter, as Hal thought\nit over. Why should the bosses have left him here in plain sight, when\nthey might so easily have put him into an automobile, and whisked him\ndown to Pedro before daylight? Was it a sign of the contempt they felt\nfor their slaves? Did they count upon the sight of the prisoner in the\nwindow to produce fear instead of resentment? And might it not be that\nthey understood their workers better than the would-be check-weighman?\nHe recalled Mary Burke's pessimism about them, and anxiety gnawed at his\nsoul; and--such is the operation of the jail-psychology--he fought\nagainst this anxiety. He hated the company for its cynicism, he clenched\nhis hands and set his teeth, desiring to teach the bosses a lesson, to\nprove to them that their workers were not slaves, but men!\n\n\n\nSECTION 17.\n\nToward the middle of the morning, Hal heard footsteps in the corridor\noutside, and a man whom he did not know opened the barred door and set\ndown a pitcher of water and a tin plate with a hunk of bread on it. When\nhe started to leave, Hal spoke: \"Just a minute, please.\"\n\nThe other frowned at him.\n\n\"Can you give me any idea how long I am to stay in here?\"\n\n\"I cannot,\" said the man.\n\n\"If I'm to be locked up,\" said Hal, \"I've certainly a right to know what\nis the charge against me.\"\n\n\"Go to blazes!\" said the other, and slammed the door and went down the\ncorridor.\n\nHal went to the window again, and passed the time watching the people\nwho went by. Groups of ragged children gathered, looking up at him,\ngrinning and making signs--until some one appeared below and ordered\nthem away.\n\nAs time passed, Hal became hungry. The taste of bread, eaten alone,\nbecomes speedily monotonous, and the taste of water does not relieve it;\nnevertheless, Hal munched the bread, and drank the water, and wished for\nmore.\n\nThe day dragged by; and late in the afternoon the keeper came again,\nwith another hunk of bread and another pitcher of water. \"Listen a\nmoment,\" said Hal, as the man was turning away.\n\n\"I got nothin' to say to you,\" said the other.\n\n\"I have something to say to you,\" pleaded Hal. \"I have read in a book--I\nforget where, but it was written by some doctor--that white bread does\nnot contain the elements necessary to the sustaining of the human body.\"\n\n\"Go on!\" growled the jailer. \"What yer givin' us?\"\n\n\"I mean,\" explained Hal, \"a diet of bread and water is not what I'd\nchoose to live on.\"\n\n\"What would yer choose?\"\n\nThe tone suggested that the question was a rhetorical one; but Hal took\nit in good faith. \"If I could have some beefsteak and mashed potatoes--\"\n\nThe door of the cell closed with a slam whose echoes drowned out the\nrest of that imaginary menu. And so once more Hal sat on the hard bench,\nand munched his hunk of bread, and thought jail-thoughts.\n\nWhen the quitting-whistle blew, he stood at the window, and saw the\ngroups of his friends once again, and got their covert signals of\nencouragement. Then darkness fell, and another long vigil began.\n\nIt was late; Hal had no means of telling how late, save that all the\nlights in the camps were out. He made up his mind that he was in for the\nnight, and had settled himself on the floor with his arm for a pillow,\nand had dozed off to sleep, when suddenly there came a scraping sound\nagainst the bars of his window. He sat up with a start, and heard\nanother sound, unmistakably the rustling of paper. He sprang to the\nwindow, where by the faint light of the stars he could make out\nsomething dangling. He caught at it; it seemed to be an ordinary\nnote-book, such as stenographers use, tied on the end of a pole.\n\nHal looked out, but could see no one. He caught hold of the pole and\njerked it, as a signal; and then he heard a whisper which he recognised\ninstantly as Rovetta's. \"Hello! Listen. Write your name hundred times in\nbook. I come back. Understand?\"\n\nThe command was a sufficiently puzzling one, but Hal realised that this\nwas no time for explanations. He answered, \"Yes,\" and broke the string\nand took the notebook. There was a pencil attached, with a piece of\ncloth wrapped round the point to protect it.\n\nThe pole was withdrawn, and Hal sat on the bench, and began to write,\nthree or four times on a page, \"Joe Smith--Joe Smith--Joe Smith.\" It is\nnot hard to write \"Joe Smith,\" even in darkness, and so, while his hand\nmoved, Hal's mind was busy with this mystery. It was fairly to be\nassumed that his committee did not want his autograph to distribute for\na souvenir; they must want it for some vital purpose, to meet some new\nmove of the bosses. The answer to this riddle was not slow in coming:\nhaving failed in their effort to find money on him, the bosses had\nframed up a letter, which they were exhibiting as having been written by\nthe would-be check-weigh-man. His friends wanted his signature to\ndisprove the authenticity of the letter.\n\nHal wrote a free and rapid hand, with a generous flourish; he felt sure\nit would be different from Alec Stone's idea of a working-boy's scrawl.\nHis pencil flew on and on--\"Joe Smith--Joe Smith--\" page after page,\nuntil he was sure that he had written a signature for every miner in the\ncamp, and was beginning on the buddies. Then, hearing a whistle outside,\nhe stopped and sprang to the window.\n\n\"Throw it!\" whispered a voice; and Hal threw it. He saw a form vanish up\nthe street, after which all was quiet again. He listened for a while, to\nsee if he had roused his jailer; then he lay down on the bench--and\nthought more jail-thoughts!\n\n\n\nSECTION 18.\n\nMorning came, and the mine-whistle blew, and Hal stood at the window\nagain. This time he noticed that some of the miners on their way to work\nhad little strips of paper in their hands, which strips they waved\nconspicuously for him to see. Old Mike Sikoria came along, having a\nwhole bunch of strips in his hands, which he was distributing to all who\nwould take them. Doubtless he had been warned to proceed secretly, but\nthe excitement of the occasion had been too much for him; he capered\nabout like a young spring lamb, and waved the strips at Hal in plain\nsight of all the world.\n\nSuch indiscreet behaviour met the return it invited. As Hal watched, he\nsaw a stocky figure come striding round the corner, confronting the\nstartled old Slovak. It was Bud Adams, the mine-guard, and his hard\nfists were clenched, and his whole body gathered for a blow. Mike saw\nhim, and was as if suddenly struck with paralysis; his toil-bent\nshoulders sunk together, and his hands fell to his sides--his fingers\nopening, and his precious strips of paper fluttering to the ground. Mike\nstared at Bud like a fascinated rabbit, making no move to protect\nhimself.\n\nHal clutched the bars, with an impulse to leap to his friend's defence.\nBut the expected blow did not fall; the mine-guard contented himself\nwith glaring ferociously, and giving an order to the old man. Mike\nstooped and picked up the papers--the process taking him some time, as\nhe was unable or unwilling to take his eyes off the mine-guard's. When\nhe got them all in his hands, there came another order, and he gave them\nup to Bud. After which he fell back a step, and the other followed, his\nfists still clenched, and a blow seeming about to leap from him every\nmoment. Mike receded another step, and then another--so the two of them\nbacked out of sight around the corner. Men who had been witnesses of\nthis little drama turned and slunk off, and Hal was given no clue as to\nits outcome.\n\nA couple of hours afterwards, Hal's jailer came up, this time without\nany bread and water. He opened the door and commanded the prisoner to\n\"come along.\" Hal went downstairs, and entered Jeff Cotton's office.\n\nThe camp-marshal sat at his desk with a cigar between his teeth. He was\nwriting, and he went on writing until the jailer had gone out and closed\nthe door. Then he turned his revolving chair and crossed his legs,\nleaning back and looking at the young miner in his dirty blue overalls,\nhis hair tousled and his face pale from his period of confinement. The\ncamp-marshal's aristocratic face wore a smile. \"Well, young fellow,\"\nsaid he, \"you've been having a lot of fun in this camp.\"\n\n\"Pretty fair, thank you,\" answered Hal.\n\n\"Beat us out all along the line, hey?\" Then, after a pause, \"Now, tell\nme, what do you think you're going to get out of it?\"\n\n\"That's what Alec Stone asked me,\" replied Hal. \"I don't think it would\ndo much good to explain. I doubt if you believe in altruism any more\nthan Stone does.\"\n\nThe camp-marshal took his cigar from his mouth, and flicked off the\nashes. His face became serious, and there was a silence, while he\nstudied Hal. \"You a union organiser?\" he asked, at last.\n\n\"No,\" said Hal.\n\n\"You're an educated man; you're no labourer, that I know. Who's paying\nyou?\"\n\n\"There you are! You don't believe in altruism.\"\n\nThe other blew a ring of smoke across the room. \"Just want to put the\ncompany in the hole, hey? Some kind of agitator?\"\n\n\"I am a miner who wants to be a check-weighman.\"\n\n\"Socialist?\"\n\n\"That depends upon developments here.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the marshal, \"you're an intelligent chap, that I can see.\nSo I'll lay my hand on the table and you can study it. You're not going\nto serve as check-weighman in North Valley, nor any other place that the\n'G. F. C.' has anything to do with. Nor are you going to have the\nsatisfaction of putting the company in a hole. We're not even going to\nbeat you up and make a martyr of you. I was tempted to do that the other\nnight, but I changed my mind.\"\n\n\"You might change the bruises on my arm,\" suggested Hal, in a pleasant\nvoice.\n\n\"We're going to offer you the choice of two things,\" continued the\nmarshal, without heeding this mild sarcasm. \"Either you will sign a\npaper admitting that you took the twenty-five dollars from Alec Stone,\nin which case we will fire you and call it square; or else we will prove\nthat you took it, in which case we will send you to the pen for five or\nten years. Do you get that?\"\n\nNow when Hal had applied for the job of check-weighman, he had been\nexpecting to be thrown out of the camp, and had intended to go, counting\nhis education complete. But here, as he sat and gazed into the marshal's\nmenacing eyes, he decided suddenly that he did not want to leave North\nValley. He wanted to stay and take the measure of this gigantic\n\"burglar,\" the General Fuel Company.\n\n\"That's a serious threat, Mr. Cotton,\" he remarked. \"Do you often do\nthings like that?\"\n\n\"We do them when we have to,\" was the reply.\n\n\"Well, it's a novel proposition. Tell me more about it. What will the\ncharge be?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure about that--we'll put it up to our lawyers. Maybe they'll\ncall it conspiracy, maybe blackmail. They'll make it whatever carries a\nlong enough sentence.\"\n\n\"And before I enter my plea, would you mind letting me see the letter\nI'm supposed to have written.\"\n\n\"Oh, you've heard about the letter, have you?\" said the camp-marshal,\nlifting his eyebrows in mild surprise. He took from his desk a sheet of\npaper and handed it to Hal, who read:\n\n\"Dere mister Stone, You don't need worry about the check-wayman. Pay me\ntwenty five dollars, and I will fix it right. Yours try, Joe Smith.\"\n\nHaving taken in the words of the letter, Hal examined the paper, and\nperceived that his enemies had taken the trouble, not merely to forge a\nletter in his name, but to have it photographed, to have a cut made of\nthe photograph, and to have it printed. Beyond doubt they had\ndistributed it broadcast in the camp. And all this in a few hours! It\nwas as Olson had said--a regular system to keep the men bedevilled.\n\n\n\nSECTION 19.\n\nHal took a minute or so to ponder the situation. \"Mr. Cotton,\" he said,\nat last. \"I know how to spell better than that. Also my handwriting is a\nbit more fluent.\"\n\nThere was a trace of a smile about the marshal's cruel lips. \"I know,\"\nhe replied. \"I've not failed to compare them.\"\n\n\"You have a good secret-service department!\" said Hal.\n\n\"Before you get through, young fellow, you'll discover that our legal\ndepartment is equally efficient.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Hal, \"they'll need to be; for I don't see how you can get\nround the fact that I'm a check-weighman, chosen according to the law,\nand with a group of the men behind me.\"\n\n\"If that's what you're counting on,\" retorted Cotton, \"you may as well\nforget it. You've got no group any more.\"\n\n\"Oh! You've got rid of them?\"\n\n\"We've got rid of the ring-leaders.\"\n\n\"Of whom?\"\n\n\"That old billy-goat, Sikoria, for one.\"\n\n\"You've shipped him?\"\n\n\"We have.\"\n\n\"I saw the beginning of that. Where have you sent him?\"\n\n\"That,\" smiled the marshal, \"is a job for _your_ secret-service\ndepartment!\"\n\n\"And who else?\"\n\n\"John Edstrom has gone down to bury his wife. It's not the first time\nthat dough-faced old preacher has made trouble for us, but it'll be the\nlast. You'll find him in Pedro--probably in the poor-house.\"\n\n\"No,\" responded Hal, quickly--and there came just a touch of elation in\nhis voice--\"he won't have to go to the poor-house at once. You see, I've\njust sent twenty-five dollars to him.\"\n\nThe camp-marshal frowned. \"Really!\" Then, after a pause, \"You _did_ have\nthat money on you! I thought that lousy Greek had got away with it!\"\n\n\"No. Your knave was honest. But so was I. I knew Edstrom had been\ngetting short weight for years, so he was the one person with any right\nto the money.\"\n\nThis story was untrue, of course; the money was still buried in\nEdstrom's cabin. But Hal meant for the old miner to have it in the end,\nand meantime he wanted to throw Cotton off the track.\n\n\"A clever trick, young man!\" said the marshal. \"But you'll repent it\nbefore you're through. It only makes me more determined to put you where\nyou can't do us any harm.\"\n\n\"You mean in the pen? You understand, of course, it will mean a jury\ntrial. You can get a jury to do what you want?\"\n\n\"They tell me you've been taking an interest in politics in Pedro\nCounty. Haven't you looked into our jury-system?\"\n\n\"No, I haven't got that far.\"\n\nThe marshal began blowing rings of smoke again.\n\n\"Well, there are some three hundred men on our jury-list, and we know\nthem all. You'll find yourself facing a box with Jake Predovich as\nforeman, three company-clerks, two of Alf Raymond's saloon-keepers, a\nranchman with a mortgage held by the company-bank, and five Mexicans who\nhave no idea what it's all about, but would stick a knife into your back\nfor a drink of whiskey. The District Attorney is a politician who\nfavours the miners in his speeches, and favours us in his acts; while\nJudge Denton, of the district court, is the law partner of Vagleman, our\nchief-counsel. Do you get all that?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Hal. \"I've heard of the 'Empire of Raymond'; I'm interested\nto see the machinery. You're quite open about it!\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied the marshal, \"I want you to know what you're up against.\nWe didn't start this fight, and we're perfectly willing to end it\nwithout trouble. All we ask is that you make amends for the mischief\nyou've done us.\"\n\n\"By 'making amends,' you mean I'm to disgrace myself--to tell the men\nI'm a traitor?\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" said the marshal.\n\n\"I think I'll have a seat while I consider the matter,\" said Hal; and he\ntook a chair, and stretched out his legs, and made himself elaborately\ncomfortable. \"That bench upstairs is frightfully hard,\" said he, and\nsmiled mockingly upon the camp-marshal.\n\n\n\nSECTION 20.\n\nWhen this conversation was continued, it was upon a new and unexpected\nline. \"Cotton,\" remarked the prisoner, \"I perceive that you are a man of\neducation. It occurs to me that once upon a time you must have been what\nthe world calls a gentleman.\"\n\nThe blood started into the camp-marshal's face. \"You go to hell!\" said\nhe.\n\n\"I did not intend to ask questions,\" continued Hal. \"I can well\nunderstand that you mightn't care to answer them. My point is that,\nbeing an ex-gentleman, you may appreciate certain aspects of this case\nwhich would be beyond the understanding of a nigger-driver like Stone,\nor an efficiency expert like Cartwright. One gentleman can recognise\nanother, even in a miner's costume. Isn't that so?\"\n\nHal paused for an answer, and the marshal gave him a wary look. \"I\nsuppose so,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, to begin with, one gentleman does not smoke without inviting\nanother to join him.\"\n\nThe man gave another look. Hal thought he was going to consign him to\nhades once more; but instead he took a cigar from his vest-pocket and\nheld it out.\n\n\"No, thank you,\" said Hal, quietly. \"I do not smoke. But I like to be\ninvited.\"\n\nThere was a pause, while the two men measured each other.\n\n\"Now, Cotton,\" began the prisoner, \"you pictured the scene at my trial.\nLet me carry on the story for you. You have your case all framed up,\nyour hand-picked jury in the box, and your hand-picked judge on the\nbench, your hand-picked prosecuting-attorney putting through the job;\nyou are ready to send your victim to prison, for an example to the rest\nof your employ\u00c3\u00a9s. But suppose that, at the climax of the proceedings,\nyou should make the discovery that your victim is a person who cannot be\nsent to prison?\"\n\n\"Cannot be sent to prison?\" repeated the other. His tone was thoughtful.\n\"You'll have to explain.\"\n\n\"Surely not to a man of your intelligence! Don't you know, Cotton, there\nare people who cannot be sent to prison?\"\n\nThe camp-marshal smoked his cigar for a bit. \"There are some in this\ncounty,\" said he. \"But I thought I knew them all.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Hal, \"has it never occurred to you that there might be some\nin this _state_?\"\n\nThere followed a long silence. The two men were gazing into each other's\neyes; and the more they gazed, the more plainly Hal read uncertainty in\nthe face of the marshal.\n\n\"Think how embarrassing it would be!\" he continued. \"You have your drama\nall staged--as you did the night before last--only on a larger stage,\nbefore a more important audience; and at the _d\u00c3\u00a9nouement_ you find that,\ninstead of vindicating yourself before the workers in North Valley, you\nhave convicted yourself before the public of the state. You have shown\nthe whole community that you are law-breakers; worse than that--you have\nshown that you are jack-asses!\"\n\nThis time the camp-marshal gazed so long that his cigar went out. And\nmeantime Hal was lounging in his chair, smiling at him strangely. It was\nas if a transformation was taking place before the marshal's eyes; the\nminer's \"jumpers\" fell away from Hal's figure, and there was a suit of\nevening-clothes in their place!\n\n\"Who the devil are you?\" cried the man.\n\n\"Well now!\" laughed Hal. \"You boast of the efficiency of your secret\nservice department! Put them at work upon this problem. A young man, age\ntwenty-one, height five feet ten inches, weight one hundred and\nfifty-two pounds, eyes brown, hair chestnut and rather wavy, manner\ngenial, a favourite with the ladies--at least that's what the society\nnotes say--missing since early in June, supposed to be hunting\nmountain-goats in Mexico. As you know, Cotton, there's only one city in\nthe state that has any 'society,' and in that city there are only\ntwenty-five or thirty families that count. For a secret service\ndepartment like that of the 'G. F. C.', that is really too easy.\"\n\nAgain there was a silence, until Hal broke it. \"Your distress is a\ntribute to your insight. The company is lucky in the fact that one of\nits camp-marshals happens to be an ex-gentleman.\"\n\nAgain the other flushed. \"Well, by God!\" he said, half to himself; and\nthen, making a last effort to hold his bluff--\"You're kidding me!\"\n\n\"'Kidding,' as you call it, is one of the favourite occupations of\nsociety, Cotton. A good part of our intercourse consists of it--at least\namong the younger set.\"\n\nSuddenly the marshal rose. \"Say,\" he demanded, \"would you mind going\nback upstairs for a few minutes?\"\n\nHal could not restrain his laughter at this. \"I should mind it very\nmuch,\" he said. \"I have been on a bread and water diet for thirty-six\nhours, and I should like very much to get out and have a breath of fresh\nair.\"\n\n\"But,\" said the other, lamely, \"I've got to send you up there.\"\n\n\"That's another matter,\" replied Hal. \"If you send me, I'll go, but it's\nyour look-out. You've kept me here without legal authority, with no\ncharge against me, and without giving me an opportunity to see counsel.\nUnless I'm very much mistaken, you are liable criminally for that, and\nthe company is liable civilly. That is your own affair, of course. I\nonly want to make clear my position--when you ask me would I _mind_\nstepping upstairs, I, answer that I would mind very much indeed.\"\n\nThe camp-marshal stood for a bit, chewing nervously on his extinct\ncigar. Then he went to the door. \"Hey, Gus!\" he called. Hal's jailer\nappeared, and Cotton whispered to him, and he went away again. \"I'm\ntelling him to get you some food, and you can sit and eat it here. Will\nthat suit you better?\"\n\n\"It depends,\" said Hal, making the most of the situation. \"Are you\ninviting me as your prisoner, or as your guest?\"\n\n\"Oh, come off!\" said the other.\n\n\"But I have to know my legal status. It will be of importance to my\nlawyers.\"\n\n\"Be my guest,\" said the camp-marshal.\n\n\"But when a guest has eaten, he is free to go out, if he wishes to!\"\n\n\"I will let you know about that before you get through.\"\n\n\"Well, be quick. I'm a rapid eater.\"\n\n\"You'll promise you won't go away before that?\"\n\n\"If I do,\" was Hal's laughing reply, \"it will be only to my place of\nbusiness. You can look for me at the tipple, Cotton!\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 21.\n\nThe marshal went out, and a few moments later the jailer came back, with\na meal which presented a surprising contrast to the ones he had\npreviously served. There was a tray containing cold ham, a couple of\nsoft boiled eggs, some potato salad, and a cup of coffee with rolls and\nbutter.\n\n\"Well, well!\" said Hal, condescendingly. \"That's even nicer than\nbeefsteak and mashed potatoes!\" He sat and watched, not offering to\nhelp, while the other made room for the tray on the table in front of\nhim. Then the man stalked out, and Hal began to eat.\n\nBefore he had finished, the camp-marshal returned. He seated himself in\nhis revolving chair, and appeared to be meditative. Between bites, Hal\nwould look up and smile at him.\n\n\"Cotton,\" said he, \"you know there is no more certain test of breeding\nthan table-manners. You will observe that I have not tucked my napkin in\nmy neck, as Alec Stone would have done.\"\n\n\"I'm getting you,\" replied the marshal.\n\nHal set his knife and fork side by side on his plate. \"Your man has\noverlooked the finger-bowl,\" he remarked. \"However, don't bother. You\nmight ring for him now, and let him take the tray.\"\n\nThe camp-marshal used his voice for a bell, and the jailer came.\n\"Unfortunately,\" said Hal, \"when your people were searching me, night\nbefore last, they dropped my purse, so I have no tip for the waiter.\"\n\nThe \"waiter\" glared at Hal as if he would like to bite him; but the\ncamp-marshal grinned. \"Clear out, Gus, and shut the door,\" said he.\n\nThen Hal stretched his legs and made himself comfortable again. \"I must\nsay I like being your guest better than being your prisoner!\"\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\"I've been talking it over with Mr. Cartwright,\" began the marshal.\n\"I've got no way of telling how much of this is bluff that you've been\ngiving me, but it's evident enough that you're no miner. You may be some\nnewfangled kind of agitator, but I'm damned if I ever saw an agitator\nthat had tea-party manners. I suppose you've been brought up to money;\nbut if that's so, why you want to do this kind of thing is more than I\ncan imagine.\"\n\n\"Tell me, Cotton,\" said Hal, \"did you never hear of _ennui_?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the other, \"but aren't you rather young to be troubled\nwith that complaint?\"\n\n\"Suppose I've seen others suffering from it, and wanted to try a\ndifferent way of living from theirs?\"\n\n\"If you're what you say, you ought to be still in college.\"\n\n\"I go back for my senior year this fall.\"\n\n\"What college?\"\n\n\"You doubt me still, I see!\" said Hal, and smiled. Then, unexpectedly,\nwith a spirit which only moonlit campuses and privilege could beget, he\nchanted:\n\n  \"Old King Coal was a merry old soul,\n    And a merry old soul was he;\n  He made him a college, all full of knowledge--\n    Hurrah for you and me!\"\n\n\"What college is that?\" asked the marshal. And Hal sang again:\n\n  \"Oh, Liza-Ann, come out with me,\n  The moon is a-shinin' in the monkey-puzzle tree!\n  Oh, Liza-Ann, I have began\n  To sing you the song of Harrigan!\"\n\n\"Well, well!\" commented the marshal, when the concert was over. \"Are\nthere many more like you at Harrigan?\"\n\n\"A little group--enough to leaven the lump.\"\n\n\"And this is your idea of a vacation?\"\n\n\"No, it isn't a vacation; it's a summer-course in practical sociology.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see!\" said the marshal; and he smiled in spite of himself.\n\n\"All last year we let the professors of political economy hand out their\ntheories to us. But somehow the theories didn't seem to correspond with\nthe facts. I said to myself, 'I've got to check them up.' You know the\nphrases, perhaps--individualism, _laissez faire_, freedom of contract,\nthe right of every man to work for whom he pleases. And here you see how\nthe theories work out--a camp-marshal with a cruel smile on his face and\na gun on his hip, breaking the laws faster than a governor can sign\nthem.\"\n\nThe camp-marshal decided suddenly that he had had enough of this\n\"tea-party.\" He rose to his feet to cut matters short. \"If you don't\nmind, young man,\" said he, \"we'll get down to business!\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 22.\n\nHe took a turn about the room, then he came and stopped in front of Hal.\nHe stood with his hands thrust into his pockets, with a certain jaunty\ngrace that was out of keeping with his occupation. He was a handsome\ndevil, Hal thought--in spite of his dangerous mouth, and the marks of\ndissipation on him.\n\n\"Young man,\" he began, with another effort at geniality. \"I don't know\nwho you are, but you're wide awake; you've got your nerve with you, and I\nadmire you. So I'm willing to call the thing off, and let you go back\nand finish that course at college.\"\n\nHal had been studying the other's careful smile. \"Cotton,\" he said, at\nlast, \"let me get the proposition clear. I don't have to say I took that\nmoney?\"\n\n\"No, we'll let you off from that.\"\n\n\"And you won't send me to the pen?\"\n\n\"No. I never meant to do that, of course. I was only trying to bluff\nyou. All I ask is that you clear out, and give our people a chance to\nforget.\"\n\n\"But what's there in that for me, Cotton? If I had wanted to run away, I\ncould have done it any time during the last eight or ten weeks.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course, but now it's different. Now it's a matter of my\nconsideration.\"\n\n\"Cut out the consideration!\" exclaimed Hal. \"You want to get rid of me,\nand you'd like to do it without trouble. But you can't--so forget it.\"\n\nThe other was staring, puzzled. \"You mean you expect to stay here?\"\n\n\"I mean just that.\"\n\n\"Young man, I've had enough of this! I've got no more time to play. I\ndon't care who you are, I don't care about your threats. I'm the marshal\nof this camp, and I have the job of keeping order in it. I say you're\ngoing to get out!\"\n\n\"But, Cotton,\" said Hal, \"this is an incorporated town! I have a right\nto walk on the streets--exactly as much right as you.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to waste time arguing. I'm going to put you into an\nautomobile and take you down to Pedro!\"\n\n\"And suppose I go to the District Attorney and demand that he prosecute\nyou?\"\n\n\"He'll laugh at you.\"\n\n\"And suppose I go to the Governor of the state?\"\n\n\"He'll laugh still louder.\"\n\n\"All right, Cotton; maybe you know what you're doing; but I wonder--I\nwonder just how sure you feel. Has it never occurred to you that your\nsuperiors might not care to have you take these high-handed steps?\"\n\n\"My superiors? Who do you mean?\"\n\n\"There's one man in the state you must respect--even though you despise\nthe District Attorney and the Governor. That is Peter Harrigan.\"\n\n\"Peter Harrigan?\" echoed the other; and then he burst into a laugh.\n\"Well, you _are_ a merry lad!\"\n\nHal continued to study him, unmoved. \"I wonder if you're sure! He'll\nstand for everything you've done.\"\n\n\"He will!\" said the other.\n\n\"For the way you treat the workers? He knows you are giving short\nweights.\"\n\n\"Oh hell!\" said the other. \"Where do you suppose he got the money for\nyour college?\"\n\nThere was a pause; at last the marshal asked, defiantly, \"Have you got\nwhat you want?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Hal. \"Of course, I thought it all along, but it's hard to\nconvince other people. Old Peter's not like most of these Western\nwolves, you know; he's a pious high-church man.\"\n\nThe marshal smiled grimly. \"So long as there are sheep,\" said he,\n\"there'll be wolves in sheep's clothing.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Hal. \"And you leave them to feed on the lambs!\"\n\n\"If any lamb is silly enough to be fooled by that old worn-out skin,\"\nremarked the marshal, \"it deserves to be eaten.\"\n\nHal was studying the cynical face in front of him. \"Cotton,\" he said,\n\"the shepherds are asleep; but the watch-dogs are barking. Haven't you\nheard them?\"\n\n\"I hadn't noticed.\"\n\n\"They are barking, barking! They are going to wake the shepherds! They\nare going to save the sheep!\"\n\n\"Religion don't interest me,\" said the other, looking bored; \"your kind\nany more than Old Peter's.\"\n\nAnd suddenly Hal rose to his feet. \"Cotton,\" said he, \"my place is with\nthe flock! I'm going back to my job at the tipple!\" And he started\ntowards the door.\n\n\n\nSECTION 23.\n\nJeff Cotton sprang forward. \"Stop!\" he cried.\n\nBut Hal did not stop.\n\n\"See here, young man!\" cried the marshal. \"Don't carry this joke too\nfar!\" And he sprang to the door, just ahead of his prisoner. His hand\nmoved toward his hip.\n\n\"Draw your gun, Cotton,\" said Hal; and, as the marshal obeyed, \"Now I\nwill stop. If I obey you in future, it will be at the point of your\nrevolver.\"\n\nThe marshal's mouth was dangerous-looking. \"You may find that in this\ncountry there's not so much between the drawing of a gun and the firing\nof it!\"\n\n\"I've explained my attitude,\" replied Hal. \"What are your orders?\"\n\n\"Come back and sit in this chair.\"\n\nSo Hal sat, and the marshal went to his desk, and took up the telephone.\n\"Number seven,\" he said, and waited a moment. \"That you, Tom? Bring the\ncar right away.\"\n\nHe hung up the receiver, and there followed a silence; finally Hal\ninquired, \"I'm going to Pedro?\"\n\nThere was no reply.\n\n\"I see I've got on your nerves,\" said Hal. \"But I don't suppose it's\noccurred to you that you deprived me of my money last night. Also, I've\nan account with the company, some money coming to me for my work? What\nabout that?\"\n\nThe marshal took up the receiver and gave another number. \"Hello,\nSimpson. This is Cotton. Will you figure out the time of Joe Smith,\nbuddy in Number Two, and send over the cash. Get his account at the\nstore; and be quick, we're waiting for it. He's going out in a hurry.\"\nAgain he hung up the receiver.\n\n\"Tell me,\" said Hal, \"did you take that trouble for Mike Sikoria?\"\n\nThere was silence.\n\n\"Let me suggest that when you get my time, you give me part of it in\nscrip. I want it for a souvenir.\"\n\nStill there was silence.\n\n\"You know,\" persisted the prisoner, tormentingly, \"there's a law against\npaying wages in scrip.\"\n\nThe marshal was goaded to speech. \"We don't pay in scrip.\"\n\n\"But you do, man! You know you do!\"\n\n\"We give it when they ask their money ahead.\"\n\n\"The law requires you to pay them twice a month, and you don't do it.\nYou pay them once a month, and meantime, if they need money, you give\nthem this imitation money!\"\n\n\"Well, if it satisfies them, where's your kick?\"\n\n\"If it doesn't satisfy them, you put them on the train and ship them\nout?\"\n\nThe marshal sat in silence, tapping impatiently with his fingers on the\ndesk.\n\n\"Cotton,\" Hal began, again, \"I'm out for education, and there's\nsomething I'd like you to explain to me--a problem in human psychology.\nWhen a man puts through a deal like this, what does he tell himself\nabout it?\"\n\n\"Young man,\" said the marshal, \"if you'll pardon me, you are getting to\nbe a bore.\"\n\n\"Oh, but we've got an automobile ride before us! Surely we can't sit in\nsilence all the way!\" After a moment he added, in a coaxing tone, \"I\nreally want to learn, you know. You might be able to win me over.\"\n\n\"No!\" said Cotton, promptly. \"I'll not go in for anything like that!\"\n\n\"But why not?\"\n\n\"Because, I'm no match for you in long-windedness. I've heard you\nagitators before, you're all alike: you think the world is run by\ntalk--but it isn't.\"\n\nHal had come to realise that he was not getting anywhere in his duel\nwith the camp-marshal. He had made every effort to get somewhere; he had\nargued, threatened, bluffed, he had even sung songs for the marshal! But\nthe marshal was going to ship him out, that was all there was to it.\n\nHal had gone on with the quarrel, simply because he had to wait for the\nautomobile, and because he had endured indignities and had to vent his\nanger and disappointment. But now he stopped quarrelling suddenly. His\nattention was caught by the marshal's words, \"You think the world is run\nby talk!\" Those were the words Hal's brother always used! And also, the\nmarshal had said, \"You agitators!\" For years it had been one of the\ntaunts Hal had heard from his brother, \"You will turn into one of these\nagitators!\" Hal had answered, with boyish obstinacy, \"I don't care if I\ndo!\" And now, here the marshal was calling him an agitator, seriously,\nwithout an apology, without the license of blood relationship. He\nrepeated the words, \"That's what gets me about you agitators--you come\nin here trying to stir these people up--\"\n\nSo that was the way Hal seemed to the \"G. F. C.\"! He had come here\nintending to be a spectator, to stand on the deck of the steamer and\nlook down into the ocean of social misery. He had considered every step\nso carefully before he took it! He had merely tried to be a\ncheck-weighman, nothing more! He had told Tom Olson he would not go in\nfor unionism; he had had a distrust of union organisers, of agitators of\nall sorts--blind, irresponsible persons who went about stirring up\ndangerous passions. He had come to admire Tom Olson--but that had only\npartly removed his prejudices; Olson was only one agitator, not the\nwhole lot of them!\n\nBut all his consideration for the company had counted for nothing;\nlikewise all his efforts to convince the marshal that he was a\nleisure-class person. In spite of all Hal's \"tea-party manners,\" the\nmarshal had said, \"You agitators!\" What was he judging by, Hal wondered.\nHad he, Hal Warner, come to look like one of these blind, irresponsible\npersons? It was time that he took stock of himself!\n\nHad two months of \"dirty work\" in the bowels of the earth changed him\nso? The idea was bound to be disconcerting to one who had been a\nfavourite of the ladies! Did he talk like it?--he who had been \"kissing\nthe Blarney-stone!\" The marshal had said he was \"long-winded!\" Well, to\nbe sure, he had talked a lot; but what could the man expect--having shut\nhim up in jail for two nights and a day, with only his grievances to\nbrood over! Was that the way real agitators were made--being shut up\nwith grievances to brood over?\n\nHal recalled his broodings in the jail. He had been embittered; he had\nnot cared whether North Valley was dominated by labour unions. But that\nhad all been a mood, the same as his answer to his brother; that was\njail psychology, a part of his summer course in practical sociology. He\nhad put it aside; but apparently it had made a deeper impression upon\nhim than he had realised. It had changed his physical aspect! It had\nmade him look and talk like an agitator! It had made him\n\"irresponsible,\" \"blind!\"\n\nYes, that was it! All this dirt, ignorance, disease, this knavery and\noppression, this maiming of men in body and soul in the coal-camps of\nAmerica--all this did not exist--it was the hallucination of an\n\"irresponsible\" brain! There was the evidence of Hal's brother and the\ncamp-marshal to prove it; there was the evidence of the whole world to\nprove it! The camp-marshal and his brother and the whole world could not\nbe \"blind!\" And if you talked to them about these conditions, they\nshrugged their shoulders, they called you a \"dreamer,\" a \"crank,\" they\nsaid you were \"off your trolley\"; or else they became angry and bitter,\nthey called you names; they said, \"You agitators!\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 24.\n\nThe camp-marshal of North Valley had been \"agitated\" to such an extent\nthat he could not stay in his chair. All the harassments of his troubled\ncareer had come pouring into his mind. He had begun pacing the floor,\nand was talking away, regardless of whether Hal listened or not.\n\n\"A campful of lousy wops! They can't understand any civilised language,\nthey've only one idea in the world--to shirk every lick of work they\ncan, to fill up their cars with slate and rock and blame it on some\nother fellow, and go off to fill themselves with booze. They won't work\nfair, they won't fight fair--they fight with a knife in the back! And\nyou agitators with your sympathy for them--why the hell do they come to\nthis country, unless they like it better than their own?\"\n\nHal had heard this question before; but they had to wait for the\nautomobile--and being sure that he was an agitator now, he would make\nall the trouble he could! \"The reason is obvious enough,\" he said.\n\"Isn't it true that the 'G. F. C.' employs agents abroad to tell them of\nthe wonderful pay they get in America?\"\n\n\"Well, they get it, don't they? Three times what they ever got at home!\"\n\n\"Yes, but it doesn't do them any good. There's another fact which the\n'G. F. C.' doesn't mention--that the cost of living is even higher than\nthe wages. Then, too, they're led to think of America as a land of\nliberty; they come, hoping for a better chance for themselves and their\nchildren; but they find a camp-marshal who's off in his geography--who\nthinks the Rocky Mountains are somewhere in Russia!\"\n\n\"I know that line of talk!\" exclaimed the other. \"I learned to wave the\nstarry flag when I was a kid. But I tell you, you've got to get coal\nmined, and it isn't the same thing as running a Fourth of July\ncelebration. Some church people make a law they shan't work on\nSunday--and what comes of that? They have thirty-six hours to get soused\nin, and so they can't work on Monday!\"\n\n\"Surely there's a remedy, Cotton! Suppose the company refused to rent\nbuildings to saloon-keepers?\"\n\n\"Good God! You think we haven't tried it? They go down to Pedro for the\nstuff, and bring back all they can carry--inside them and out. And if we\nstop that--then our hands move to some other camps, where they can spend\ntheir money as they please. No, young man, when you have such cattle,\nyou have to drive them! And it takes a strong hand to do it--a man like\nPeter Harrigan. If there's to be any coal, if industry's to go on, if\nthere's to be any progress--\"\n\n\"We have that in our song!\" laughed Hal, breaking into the\ncamp-marshal's discourse--\n\n  \"He keeps them a-roll, that merry old soul--\n    The wheels of industree;\n  A-roll and a-roll, for his pipe and his bowl\n    And his college facultee!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" growled the marshal. \"It's easy enough for you smart young chaps\nto make verses, while you're living at ease on the old man's bounty. But\nthat don't answer any argument. Are you college boys ready to take over\nhis job? Or these Democrat politicians that come in here, talking\nfool-talk about liberty, making labour laws for these wops--\"\n\n\"I begin to understand,\" said Hal. \"You object to the politicians who\npass the laws, you doubt their motives--and so you refuse to obey. But\nwhy didn't you tell me sooner you were an anarchist?\"\n\n\"Anarchist?\" cried the marshal. \"_Me_ an anarchist?\"\n\n\"That's what an anarchist is, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Good God! If that isn't the limit! You come here, stirring up the\nmen--a union agitator, or whatever you are--and you know that the first\nidea of these people, when they do break loose, is to put dynamite in\nthe shafts and set fire to the buildings!\"\n\n\"Do they do that?\" There was surprise in Hal's tone.\n\n\"Haven't you read what they did in the last big strike? That dough-faced\nold preacher, John Edstrom, could tell you. He was one of the bunch.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Hal, \"you're mistaken. Edstrom has a different philosophy.\nBut others did, I've no doubt. And since I've been here, I can\nunderstand their point of view entirely. When they set fire to the\nbuildings, it was because they thought you and Alec Stone might be\ninside.\"\n\nThe marshal did not smile.\n\n\"They want to destroy the properties,\" continued Hal, \"because that's\nthe only way they can think of to punish the tyranny and greed of the\nowners. But, Cotton, suppose some one were to put a new idea into their\nheads; suppose some one were to say to them, 'Don't destroy the\nproperties--_take them!_'\"\n\nThe other stared. \"Take them! So that's your idea of morality!\"\n\n\"It would be more moral than the method by which Peter got them in the\nbeginning.\"\n\n\"What method is that?\" demanded the marshal, with some appearance of\nindignation. \"He paid the market-price for them, didn't he?\"\n\n\"He paid the market-price for politicians. Up in Western City I happen\nto know a lady who was a school-commissioner when he was buying\nschool-lands from the state--lands that were known to contain coal. He\nwas paying three dollars an acre, and everybody knew they were worth\nthree thousand.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Cotton, \"if you don't buy the politicians, you wake up some\nfine morning and find that somebody else has bought them. If you have\nproperty, you have to protect it.\"\n\n\"Cotton,\" said Hal, \"you sell Old Peter your time--but surely you might\nkeep part of your brains! Enough to look at your monthly pay-check and\nrealise that you too are a wage-slave, not much better than the miners\nyou despise.\"\n\nThe other smiled. \"My check might be bigger, I admit; but I've figured\nover it, and I think I have an easier time than you agitators. I'm\ntop-dog, and I expect to stay on top.\"\n\n\"Well, Cotton, on that view of life, I don't wonder you get drunk now\nand then. A dog-fight, with no faith or humanity anywhere! Don't think\nI'm sneering at you--I'm talking out of my heart to you. I'm not so\nyoung, nor such a fool, that I haven't had the dog-fight aspect of\nthings brought to my attention. But there's something in a fellow that\ninsists he isn't all dog; he has at least a possibility of something\nbetter. Take these poor under-dogs sweating inside the mountain, risking\ntheir lives every hour of the day and night to provide you and me with\ncoal to keep us warm--to 'keep the wheels of industry a-roll'--\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 25.\n\nThese were the last words Hal spoke. They were obvious enough words, yet\nwhen he looked back upon the coincidence, it seemed to him a singular\none. For while he was sitting there chatting, it happened that the poor\nunder-dogs inside the mountain were in the midst of one of those\nexperiences which make the romance and terror of coal-mining. One of the\nboys who were employed underground, in violation of the child labour\nlaw, was in the act of bungling his task. He was a \"spragger,\" whose\nduty it was to thrust a stick into the wheel of a loaded car to hold it;\nand he was a little chap, and the car was in motion when he made the\nattempt. It knocked him against the wall--and so there was a load of\ncoal rolling down grade, pursued too late by half a dozen men. Gathering\nmomentum, it whirled round a curve and flew from the track, crashing\ninto timbers and knocking them loose. With the timbers came a shower of\ncoal-dust, accumulated for decades in these old workings; and at the\nsame time came an electric light wire, which, as it touched the car,\nproduced a spark.\n\nAnd so it was that Hal, chatting with the marshal, suddenly felt, rather\nthan heard, a deafening roar; he felt the air about him turn into a\nliving thing which struck him a mighty blow, hurling him flat upon the\nfloor. The windows of the room crashed inward upon him in a shower of\nglass, and the plaster of the ceiling came down on his head in another\nshower.\n\nWhen he raised himself, half stunned, he saw the marshal, also on the\nfloor; these two conversationalists stared at each other with horrified\neyes. Even as they crouched, there came a crash above their heads, and\nhalf the ceiling of the room came toward them, with a great piece of\ntimber sticking through. All about them were other crashes, as if the\nend of the world had come.\n\nThey struggled to their feet, and rushing to the door, flung it open,\njust as a jagged piece of timber shattered the side-walk in front of\nthem. They sprang back again, \"Into the cellar!\" cried the marshal,\nleading the way to the back-stairs.\n\nBut before they had started down these stairs, they realised that the\ncrashing had ceased. \"What is it?\" gasped Hal, as they stood.\n\n\"Mine-explosion,\" said the other; and after a few seconds they ran to\nthe door again.\n\nThe first thing they saw was a vast pillar of dust and smoke, rising\ninto the sky above them. It spread before their dazed eyes, until it\nmade night of everything about them. There was still a rain of lighter\ndebris pattering down over the village; as they stared, and got their\nwits about them, remembering how things had looked before this, they\nrealised that the shaft-house of Number One had disappeared.\n\n\"Blown up, by God!\" cried the marshal; and the two ran out into the\nstreet, and looking up, saw that a portion of the wrecked building had\nfallen through the roof of the jail above their heads.\n\nThe rain of debris had now ceased, but there were clouds of dust which\ncovered the two men black; the clouds grew worse, until they could\nhardly see their way at all. And with the darkness there fell silence,\nwhich, after the sound of the explosion and the crashing of debris,\nseemed the silence of death.\n\nFor a few moments Hal stood dazed. He saw a stream of men and boys\npouring from the breaker; while from every street there appeared a\nstream of women; women old, women young--leaving their cooking on the\nstove, their babies in the crib, with their older children screaming at\ntheir skirts, they gathered in swarms about the pit-mouth, which was\nlike the steaming crater of a volcano.\n\nCartwright, the superintendent, appeared, running toward the fan-house.\nCotton joined him, and Hal followed. The fan-house was a wreck, the\ngiant fan lying on the ground a hundred feet away, its blades smashed.\nHal was too inexperienced in mine-matters to get the full significance\nof this; but he saw the marshal and the superintendent stare blankly at\neach other, and heard the former's exclamation, \"That does for us!\"\nCartwright said not a word; but his thin lips were pressed together, and\nthere was fear in his eyes.\n\nBack to the smoking pit-mouth the two men hurried, with Hal following.\nHere were a hundred, two hundred women crowded, clamouring questions all\nat once. They swarmed about the marshal, the superintendent, the other\nbosses--even about Hal, crying hysterically in Polish and Bohemian and\nGreek. When Hal shook his head, indicating that he did not understand\nthem, they moaned in anguish, or shrieked aloud. Some continued to stare\ninto the smoking pit-mouth; others covered the sight from their eyes, or\nsank down upon their knees, sobbing, praying with uplifted hands.\n\nLittle by little Hal began to realise the full horror of a\nmine-disaster. It was not noise and smoke and darkness, nor frantic,\nwailing women; it was not anything above ground, but what was below in\nthe smoking black pit! It was men! Men whom Hal knew, whom he had worked\nwith and joked with, whose smiles he had shared; whose daily life he had\ncome to know! Scores, possibly hundreds of them, they were down here\nunder his feet--some dead, others injured, maimed. What would they do?\nWhat would those on the surface do for them? Hal tried to get to Cotton,\nto ask him questions; but the camp-marshal was surrounded, besieged. He\nwas pushing the women back, exclaiming, \"Go away! Go home!\"\n\nWhat? Go home? they cried. When their men were in the mine? They crowded\nabout him closer, imploring, shrieking.\n\n\"Get out!\" he kept exclaiming. \"There's nothing you can do! There's\nnothing anybody can do yet! Go home! Go home!\" He had to beat them back\nby force, to keep them from pushing one another into the pit-mouth.\n\nEverywhere Hal looked were women in attitudes of grief: standing rigid,\nstaring ahead of them as if in a trance; sitting down, rocking to and\nfro; on their knees with faces uplifted in prayer; clutching their\nterrified children about their skirts. He saw an Austrian woman, a\npitiful, pale young thing with a ragged grey shawl about her head,\nstretching out her hands and crying: \"Mein Mann! Mein Mann!\" Presently\nshe covered her face, and her voice died into a wail of despair: \"O,\nmein Mann! O, mein Mann!\" She turned away, staggering about like some\ncreature that has received a death wound. Hal's eyes followed her; her\ncry, repeated over and over incessantly, became the leit-motif of this\nsymphony of horror.\n\nHe had read about mine-disasters in his morning newspaper; but here a\nmine-disaster became a thing of human flesh and blood. The unendurable\npart of it was the utter impotence of himself and of all the world. This\nimpotence became clearer to him each moment--from the exclamations of\nCotton and of the men he questioned. It was monstrous, incredible--but\nit was so! They must send for a new fan, they must wait for it to be\nbrought in, they must set it up and get it into operation; they must\nwait for hours after that while smoke and gas were cleared out of the\nmain passages of the mine; and until this had been done, there was\nnothing they could do--absolutely nothing! The men inside the mine would\nstay. Those who had not been killed outright would make their way into\nthe remoter chambers, and barricade themselves against the deadly \"after\ndamp.\" They would wait, without food or water, with air of doubtful\nquality--they would wait and wait, until the rescue-crew could get to\nthem!\n\n\n\nSECTION 26.\n\nAt moments in the midst of this confusion, Hal found himself trying to\nrecall who had worked in Number One, among the people he knew. He\nhimself had been employed in Number Two, so he had naturally come to\nknow more men in that mine. But he had known some from the other\nmine--Old Rafferty for one, and Mary Burke's father for another, and at\nleast one of the members of his check-weighman group--Zamierowski. Hal\nsaw in a sudden vision the face of this patient little man, who smiled\nso good-naturedly while Americans were trying to say his name. And Old\nRafferty, with all his little Rafferties, and his piteous efforts to\nkeep the favour of his employers! And poor Patrick Burke, whom Hal had\nnever seen sober; doubtless he was sober now, if he was still alive!\n\nThen in the crowd Hal encountered Jerry Minetti, and learned that\nanother man who had been down was Farenzena, the Italian whose\n\"fanciulla\" had played with him; and yet another was Judas\nApostolikas--having taken his thirty pieces of silver with him into the\ndeathtrap!\n\nPeople were making up lists, just as Hal was doing, by asking questions\nof others. These lists were subject to revision--sometimes under\ndramatic circumstances. You saw a woman weeping, with her apron to her\neyes; suddenly she would look up, give a piercing cry, and fling her\narms about the neck of some man. As for Hal, he felt as if he were\nencountering a ghost when suddenly he recognised Patrick Burke, standing\nin the midst of a group of people. He went over and heard the old man's\nstory--how there was a Dago fellow who had stolen his timbers, and he\nhad come up to the surface for more; so his life had been saved, while\nthe timber-thief was down there still--a judgment of Providence upon\nmine-miscreants!\n\nPresently Hal asked if Burke had been to tell his family. He had run\nhome, he said, but there was nobody there. So Hal began pushing his way\nthrough the throngs, looking for Mary, or her sister Jennie, or her\nbrother Tommie. He persisted in this search, although it occurred to him\nto wonder whether the family of a hopeless drunkard would appreciate the\ninterposition of Providence in his behalf.\n\nHe encountered Olson, who had had a narrow escape, being employed as a\nsurface-man near the hoist. All this was an old story to the organiser,\nwho had worked in mines since he was eight years old, and had seen many\nkinds of disaster. He began to explain things to Hal, in a matter of\nfact way. The law required a certain number of openings to every mine,\nalso an escape-way with ladders by which men could come out; but it cost\ngood money to dig holes in the ground.\n\nAt this time the immediate cause of the explosion was unknown, but they\ncould tell it was a \"dust explosion\" by the clouds of coke-dust, and no\none who had been into the mine and seen its dry condition would doubt\nwhat they would find when they went down and traced out the \"force\" and\nits effects. They were supposed to do regular sprinkling, but in such\nmatters the bosses used their own judgment.\n\nHal was only half listening to these explanations. The thing was too raw\nand too horrible to him. What difference did it make whose fault it was?\nThe accident had happened, and the question was now how to meet the\nemergency! Underneath Olson's sentences he heard the cry of men and boys\nbeing asphyxiated in dark dungeons--he heard the wailing of women, like\na surf beating on a distant shore, or the faint, persistent\naccompaniment of muted strings: \"O, mein Mann! O, mein Mann!\"\n\nThey came upon Jeff Cotton again. With half a dozen men to help him, he\nwas pushing back the crowd from the pit-mouth, and stretching barbed\nwired to hold them back. He was none too gentle about it, Hal thought;\nbut doubtless women are provoking when they are hysterical. He was\nanswering their frenzied questions, \"Yes, yes! We're getting a new fan.\nWe're doing everything we can, I tell you. We'll get them out. Go home\nand wait.\"\n\nBut of course no one would go home. How could a woman sit in her house,\nor go about her ordinary tasks of cooking or washing, while her man\nmight be suffering asphyxiation under the ground? The least she could do\nwas to stand at the pit-mouth--as near to him as she could get! Some of\nthem stood motionless, hour after hour, while others wandered through\nthe village streets, asking the same people, over and over again, if\nthey had seen their loved ones. Several had turned up, like Patrick\nBurke; there seemed always a chance for one more.\n\n\n\nSECTION 27.\n\nIn the course of the afternoon Hal came upon Mary Burke on the street.\nShe had long ago found her father, and seen him off to O'Callahan's to\ncelebrate the favours of Providence. Now Mary was concerned with a\ngraver matter. Number Two Mine was in danger! The explosion in Number\nOne had been so violent that the gearing of the fan of the other mine,\nnearly a mile up the canyon, had been thrown out of order. So the fan\nhad stopped; and when some one had gone to Alec Stone, asking that he\nbring out the men, Stone had refused. \"What do ye think he said?\" cried\nMary. \"What do ye think? 'Damn the men! Save the mules!'\"\n\nHal had all but lost sight of the fact that there was a second mine in\nthe village, in which hundreds of men and boys were still at work.\n\"Wouldn't they know about the explosion?\" he asked.\n\n\"They might have heard the noise,\" said Mary. \"But they'd not know what\nit was; and the bosses won't tell them till they've got out the mules.\"\n\nFor all that he had seen in North Valley, Hal could hardly credit that\nstory. \"How do you know it, Mary?\"\n\n\"Young Rovetta just told me. He was there, and heard it with his own\nears.\"\n\nHe was staring at her. \"Let's go and make sure,\" he said, and they\nstarted up the main street of the village. On the way they were joined\nby others--for already the news of this fresh trouble had begun to\nspread. Jeff Cotton went past them in an automobile, and Mary exclaimed,\n\"I told ye so! When ye see him goin', ye know there's dirty work to be\ndone!\"\n\nThey came to the shaft-house of Number Two, and found a swarm of people,\nalmost a riot. Women and children were shrieking and gesticulating,\nthreatening to break into the office and use the mine-telephone to warn\nthe men themselves. And here was the camp-marshal driving them back. Hal\nand Mary arrived in time to see Mrs. David, whose husband was at work in\nNumber Two, shaking her fist in the marshal's face and screaming at him\nlike a wild-cat. He drew his revolver upon her; and at this Hal started\nforward. A blind fury seized him--he would have thrown himself upon the\nmarshal.\n\nBut Mary Burke stopped him, flinging her arms about him, and pinning him\nby main force. \"No, no!\" she cried. \"Stay back, man! D'ye want to get\nkilled?\"\n\nHe was amazed at her strength. He was amazed also at the vehemence of\nher emotion. She was calling him a crazy fool, and names even more\nharsh. \"Have ye no more sense than a woman? Running into the mouth of a\nrevolver like that!\"\n\nThe crisis passed in a moment, for Mrs. David fell back, and then the\nmarshal put up his weapon. But Mary continued scolding Hal, trying to\ndrag him away. \"Come on now! Come out of here!\"\n\n\"But, Mary! We must do something!\"\n\n\"Ye can do nothin', I tell ye! Ye'd ought to have sense enough to know\nit. I'll not let ye get yeself murdered! Come away now!\" And half by\nforce and half by cajoling, she got him farther down the street.\n\nHe was trying to think out the situation. Were the men in Number Two\nreally in danger? Could it be possible that the bosses would take such a\nchance in cold blood? And right at this moment, with the disaster in the\nother mine before their eyes! He could not believe it; and meantime\nMary, at his side, was declaring that the men were in no real danger--it\nwas only Alec Stone's brutal words that had set her crazy.\n\n\"Don't ye remember the time when the air-course was blocked before, and\nye helped to get up the mules yeself? Ye thought nothin' of it then, and\n'tis the same now. They'll get everybody out in time!\"\n\nShe was concealing her real feelings in order to keep him safe; he let\nher lead him on, while he tried to think of something else to do. He\nwould think of the men in Number Two; they were his best friends, Jack\nDavid, Tim Rafferty, Wresmak, Androkulos, Klowoski. He would think of\nthem, in their remote dungeons--breathing bad air, becoming sick and\nfaint--in order that mules might be saved! He would stop in his tracks,\nand Mary would drag him on, repeating over and over, \"Ye can do nothin'!\nNothin'!\" And then he would think, What could he do? He had put up his\nbest bluff to Jeff Cotton a few hours earlier, and the answer had been\nthe muzzle of the marshal's revolver in his face. All he could\naccomplish now would be to bring himself to Cotton's attention, and be\nthrust out of camp forthwith.\n\n\n\nSECTION 28.\n\nThey came to Mary's home; and next door was the home of the Slav woman,\nMrs. Zamboni, about whom in the past she had told him so many funny\nstories. Mrs. Zamboni had had a new baby every year for sixteen years,\nand eleven of these babies were still alive. Now her husband was trapped\nin Number One, and she was distracted, wandering about the streets with\nthe greater part of her brood at her heels. At intervals she would emit\na howl like a tortured animal, and her brood would take it up in various\ntimbres. Hal stopped to listen to the sounds, but Mary put her fingers\ninto her ears and fled into the house. Hal followed her, and saw her\nfling herself into a chair and burst into hysterical weeping. And\nsuddenly Hal realised what a strain this terrible affair had been upon\nMary. It had been bad enough to him--but he was a man, and more able to\ncontemplate sights of horror. Men went to their deaths in industry and\nwar, and other men saw them go and inured themselves to the spectacle.\nBut women were the mothers of these men; it was women who bore them in\npain, nursed them and reared them with endless patience--women could\nnever become inured to the spectacle! Then too, the women's fate was\nworse. If the men were dead, that was the end of them; but the women\nmust face the future, with its bitter memories, its lonely and desolate\nstruggle for existence. The women must see the children suffering, dying\nby slow stages of deprivation.\n\nHal's pity for all suffering women became concentrated upon the girl\nbeside him. He knew how tenderhearted she was. She had no man in the\nmine, but some day she would have, and she was suffering the pangs of\nthat inexorable future. He looked at her, huddled in her chair, wiping\naway her tears with the hem of her old blue calico. She seemed\nunspeakably pathetic--like a child that has been hurt. She was sobbing\nout sentences now and then, as if to herself: \"Oh, the poor women, the\npoor women! Did ye see the face of Mrs. Jonotch? She'd jumped into the\nsmoking pit-mouth if they'd let her!\"\n\n\"Don't suffer so, Mary!\" pleaded Hal--as if he thought she could stop.\n\n\"Let me alone!\" she cried. \"Let me have it out!\" And Hal, who had had no\nexperience with hysteria, stood helplessly by.\n\n\"There's more misery than I ever knew there was!\" she went on. \"'Tis\neverywhere ye turn, a woman with her eyes burnin' with suffering\nwondering if she'll ever see her man again! Or some mother whose lad may\nbe dying and she can do nothin' for him!\"\n\n\"And neither can you do anything, Mary,\" Hal pleaded again. \"You're only\nsorrowing yourself to death.\"\n\n\"Ye say that to me?\" she cried. \"And when ye were ready to let Jeff\nCotton shoot ye, because you were so sorry for Mrs. David! No, the\nsights here nobody can stand.\"\n\nHe could think of nothing to answer. He drew up a chair and sat by her\nin silence, and after a while she began to grow calmer, and wiped away\nher tears, and sat gazing dully through the doorway into the dirty\nlittle street.\n\nHal's eyes followed hers. There were the ash-heaps and tomato-cans,\nthere were two of Mrs. Zamboni's bedraggled brood, poking with sticks\ninto a dump-heap--looking for something to eat, perhaps, or for\nsomething to play with. There was the dry, waste grass of the road-side,\ngrimy with coal-dust, as was everything else in the village. What a\nscene!--And this girl's eyes had never a sight of anything more\ninspiring than this. Day in and day out, all her life long, she looked\nat this scene! Had he ever for a moment reproached her for her \"black\nmoods\"? With such an environment could men or women be cheerful--could\nthey dream of beauty, aspire to heights of nobility and courage, to\nhappy service of their fellows? There was a miasma of despair over this\nplace; it was not a real place--it was a dream-place--a horrible,\ndistorted nightmare! It was like the black hole in the ground which\nhaunted Hal's imagination, with men and boys at the bottom of it, dying\nof asphyxiation!\n\nSuddenly it came to Hal--he wanted to get away from North Valley! To get\naway at all costs! The place had worn down his courage; slowly, day\nafter day, the sight of misery and want, of dirt and disease, of hunger,\noppression, despair, had eaten the soul out of him, had undermined his\nfine structure of altruistic theories. Yes, he wanted to escape--to a\nplace where the sun shone, where the grass grew green, where human\nbeings stood erect and laughed and were free. He wanted to shut from his\neyes the dust and smoke of this nasty little village; to stop his ears\nto that tormenting sound of women wailing: \"O, mein Mann! O, mein Mann!\"\n\nHe looked at the girl, who sat staring before her, bent forward, her\narms hanging limply over her knees.\n\n\"Mary,\" he said, \"you must go away from here! It's no place for a\ntenderhearted girl to be. It's no place for any one!\"\n\nShe gazed at him dully for a moment. \"It was me that was tellin' _you_\nto go away,\" she said, at last. \"Ever since ye came here I been sayin'\nit! Now I guess ye know what I mean.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I do, and I want to go. But I want you to go too.\"\n\n\"D'ye think 'twould do me any good, Joe?\" she asked. \"D'ye think 'twould\ndo me any good to get away? Could I ever forget the sights I've seen\nthis day? Could I ever have any real, honest happiness anywhere after\nthis?\"\n\nHe tried to reassure her, but he was far from reassured himself. How\nwould it be with him? Would he ever feel that he had a right to\nhappiness after this? Could he take any satisfaction in a pleasant and\ncomfortable world, knowing that it was based upon such hideous misery?\nHis thoughts went to that world, where careless, pleasure-loving people\nsought gratification of their desires. It came to him suddenly that what\nhe wanted more than to get away was to bring those people here, if only\nfor a day, for an hour, that they might hear this chorus of wailing\nwomen!\n\n\n\nSECTION 29.\n\nMary made Hal swear that he would not get into a fight with Cotton; then\nthey went to Number Two. They found the mules coming up, and the bosses\npromising that in a short while the men would be coming. Everything was\nall right--there was not a bit of danger! But Mary was afraid to trust\nHal, in spite of his promise, so she lured him back to Number One.\n\nThey found that a rescue-car had just arrived from Pedro, bringing\ndoctors and nurses, also several \"helmets.\" These \"helmets\" were strange\nlooking contrivances, fastened over the head and shoulders, air-tight,\nand provided with oxygen sufficient to last for an hour or more. The men\nwho wore them sat in a big bucket which was let down the shaft with a\nwindlass, and every now and then they pulled on a signal-cord to let\nthose on the surface know they were alive. When the first of them came\nback, he reported that there were bodies near the foot of the shaft, but\napparently all dead. There was heavy black smoke, indicating a fire\nsomewhere in the mine; so nothing more could be done until the fan had\nbeen set up. By reversing the fan, they could draw out the smoke and\ngases and clear the shaft.\n\nThe state mine-inspector had been notified, but was ill at home, and was\nsending one of his deputies. Under the law this official would have\ncharge of all the rescue work, but Hal found that the miners took no\ninterest in his presence. It had been his duty to prevent the accident,\nand he had not done so. When he came, he would do what the company\nwanted.\n\nSome time after dark the workers began to come out of Number Two, and\ntheir women, waiting at the pit-mouth, fell upon their necks with cries\nof thankfulness. Hal observed other women, whose men were in Number One,\nand would perhaps never come out again, standing and watching these\ngreetings with wistful, tear-filled eyes. Among those who came out was\nJack David, and Hal walked home with him and his wife, listening to the\nlatter abuse Jeff Cotton and Alec Stone, which was an education in the\nvocabulary of class-consciousness. The little Welsh woman repeated the\npit-boss's saying, \"Damn the men, save the mules!\" She said it again and\nagain--it seemed to delight her like a work of art, it summed up so\nperfectly the attitude of the bosses to their men! There were many other\npeople repeating that saying, Hal found; it went all over the village,\nin a few days it went all over the district. It summed up what the\ndistrict believed to be the attitude of the coal-operators to the\nworkers!\n\nHaving got over the first shock of the disaster, Hal wanted information,\nand he questioned Big Jack, a solid and well-read man who had given\nthought to every aspect of the industry. In his quiet, slow way, he\nexplained to Hal that the frequency of accidents in this district was\nnot due to any special difficulty in operating these mines, the\nexplosiveness of the gases or the dryness of the atmosphere. It was\nmerely the carelessness of those in charge, their disregard of the laws\nfor the protection of the men. There ought to be a law with \"teeth\" in\nit--for example, one providing that for every man killed in a coal-mine\nhis heirs should receive a thousand dollars, regardless of who had been\nto blame for the accident. Then you would see how quickly the operators\nwould get busy and find remedies for the \"unusual\" dangers!\n\nAs it was, they knew that no matter how great their culpability, they\ncould get off with slight loss. Already, no doubt, their lawyers were on\nthe spot, and by the time the first bodies were brought out, they would\nbe fixing things up with the families. They would offer a widow a ticket\nback to the old country; they would offer a whole family of orphaned\nchildren, maybe fifty dollars, maybe a hundred dollars--and it would be\na case of take it or leave it. You could get nothing from the courts;\nthe case was so hopeless that you could not even find a lawyer to make\nthe attempt. That was one reform in which the companies believed, said\n\"Big Jack,\" with sarcasm; they had put the \"shyster lawyer\" out of\nbusiness!\n\n\n\nSECTION 30.\n\nThere followed a night and then another day of torturing suspense. The\nfan came, but it had to be set up before anything could be done. As\nvolumes of black smoke continued to pour from the shaft, the opening was\nmade tight with a board and canvas cover; it was necessary, the bosses\nsaid, but to Hal it seemed the climax of horror. To seal up men and boys\nin a place of deadly gases!\n\nThere was something peculiarly torturing in the idea of men caught in a\nmine; they were directly under one's feet, yet it was impossible to get\nto them, to communicate with them in any way! The people on top yearned\nto them, and they, down below, yearned back. It was impossible to forget\nthem for even a few minutes. People would become abstracted while they\ntalked, and would stand staring into space; suddenly, in the midst of a\ncrowd, a woman would bury her face in her hands and burst into tears,\nand then all the others would follow suit.\n\nFew people slept in North Valley during those two nights. They held\nmourning parties in their homes or on the streets. Some house-work had\nto be done, of course, but no one did anything that could be left\nundone. The children would not play; they stood about, silent, pale,\nlike wizened-up grown people, over-mature in knowledge of trouble. The\nnerves of every one were on edge, the self-control of every one balanced\nupon a fine point.\n\nIt was a situation bound to be fruitful in imaginings and rumours,\nstimulated to those inclined to signs and omens--the seers of ghosts, or\nthose who went into trances, or possessed second sight or other\nmysterious gifts. There were some living in a remote part of the village\nwho declared they had heard explosions under the ground, several blasts\nin quick succession. The men underground were setting off dynamite by\nway of signalling!\n\nIn the course of the second day Hal sat with Mary Burke upon the steps\nof her home. Old Patrick lay within, having found the secret of oblivion\nat O'Callahan's. Now and then came the moaning of Mrs. Zamboni, who was\nin her cabin with her brood of children. Mary had been in to feed them,\nbecause the distracted mother let them starve and cry. Mary was worn\nout, herself; the wonderful Irish complexion had faded, and there were\nno curves to the vivid lips. They had been sitting in silence, for there\nwas nothing to talk of but the disaster--and they had said all there was\nto say about that. But Hal had been thinking while he watched Mary.\n\n\"Listen, Mary,\" he said, at last; \"when this thing is over, you must\nreally come away from here. I've thought it all out--I have friends in\nWestern City who will give you work, so you can take care of yourself,\nand of your brother and sister too. Will you go?\"\n\nBut she did not answer. She continued to gaze indifferently into the\ndirty little street.\n\n\"Truly, Mary,\" he went on. \"Life isn't so terrible everywhere as it is\nhere. Come away! Hard as it is to believe, you'll forget all this.\nPeople suffer, but then they stop suffering; it's nature's way--to make\nthem forget.\"\n\n\"Nature's way has been to beat me dead,\" said she.\n\n\"Yes, Mary. Despair can become a disease, but it hasn't with you. You're\njust tired out. If you'll try to rouse yourself--\" And he reached over\nand caught her hand with an attempt at playfulness. \"Cheer up, Mary!\nYou're coming away from North Valley.\"\n\nShe turned and looked at him. \"Am I?\" she asked, impassively; and she\nwent on studying his face. \"Who are ye, Joe Smith? What are ye doin'\nhere?\"\n\n\"Working in a coal-mine,\" he laughed, still trying to divert her.\n\nBut she went on, as gravely as before. \"Ye're no working man, that I\nknow. And ye're always offering me help! Ye're always sayin' what ye can\ndo for me!\" She paused and there came some of the old defiance into her\nface. \"Joe, ye can have no idea of the feelin's that have got hold of me\njust now. I'm ready to do something desperate; ye'd best be leavin' me\nalone, Joe!\"\n\n\"I think I understand, Mary. I would hardly blame you for anything you\ndid.\"\n\nShe took up his words eagerly. \"Wouldn't ye, Joe? Ye're sure? Then what\nI want is to get the truth from ye. I want ye to talk it out fair!\"\n\n\"All right, Mary. What is it?\"\n\nBut her defiance had vanished suddenly. Her eyes dropped, and he saw her\nfingers picking nervously at a fold of her dress. \"About us, Joe,\" she\nsaid. \"I've thought sometimes ye cared for me. I've thought ye liked to\nbe with me--not just because ye were sorry for me, but because of _me_.\nI've not been sure, but I can't help thinkin' it's so. Is it?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is,\" he said, a little uncertainly. \"I _do_ care for you.\"\n\n\"Then is it that ye don't care for that other girl all the time?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"it's not that.\"\n\n\"Ye can care for two girls at the same time?\"\n\nHe did not know what to say. \"It would seem that I can, Mary.\"\n\nShe raised her eyes again and studied his face. \"Ye told me about that\nother girl, and I been wonderin', was it only to put me off? Maybe it's\nme own fault, but I can't make meself believe in that other girl, Joe!\"\n\n\"You're mistaken, Mary,\" he answered, quickly. \"What I told you was\ntrue.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe so,\" she said, but there was no conviction in her tone. \"Ye\ncome away from her, and ye never go where she is or see her--it's hard\nto believe ye'd do that way if ye were very close to her. I just don't\nthink ye love her as much as ye might. And ye say you do care some for\nme. So I've thought--I've wondered--\"\n\nShe stopped, forcing herself to meet his gaze: \"I been tryin' to work it\nout! I know ye're too good a man for me, Joe. Ye come from a better\nplace in life, ye've a right to expect more in a woman--\"\n\n\"It's not that, Mary!\"\n\nBut she cut him short. \"I know that's true! Ye're only tryin' to save my\nfeelin's. I know ye're better than me! I've tried hard to hold me head\nup, I've tried a long time not to let meself go to pieces. I've even\ntried to keep cheerful, telling meself I'd not want to be like Mrs.\nZamboni, forever complainin'. But 'tis no use tellin' yourself lies! I\nbeen up to the church, and heard the Reverend Spragg tell the people\nthat the rich and poor are the same in the sight of the Lord. And maybe\n'tis so, but I'm not the Lord, and I'll never pretend I'm not ashamed to\nbe livin' in a place like this.\"\n\n\"I'm sure the Lord has no interest in keeping you here--\" he began.\n\nBut she broke in, \"What makes it so hard to bear is knowin' there's so\nmany wonderful things in the world, and ye can never have them! 'Tis as\nif ye had to see them through a pane of glass, like in the window of a\nstore. Just think, Joe Smith--once, in a church in Sheridan, I heard a\nlady sing beautiful music; once in my whole lifetime! Can ye guess what\nit meant to me?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mary, I can.\"\n\n\"But I had that all out with meself--years ago. I knew the price a\nworkin' girl has to pay for such things, and I said, I'll not let meself\nthink about them. I've hated this place, I've wanted to get away--but\nthere's only one way to go, to let some man take ye! So I've stayed;\nI've kept straight, Joe. I want ye to believe that.\"\n\n\"Of course, Mary!\"\n\n\"No! It's not been 'of course'! It means ye have to fight with\ntemptations. It's many a time I've looked at Jeff Cotton, and thought\nabout the things I need! And I've done without! But now comes the thing\na woman wants more than all the other things in the world!\"\n\nShe paused, but only for a moment. \"They tell ye to love a man of your\nown class. Me old mother said that to me, before she died. But suppose\nye didn't happen to? Suppose ye'd stopped and thought what it meant,\nhavin' one baby after another, till ye're worn out and drop--like me old\nmother did? Suppose ye knew good manners when ye see them--ye knew\ninterestin' talk when ye heard it!\" She clasped her hands suddenly\nbefore her, exclaiming, \"Ah, 'tis something different ye are, Joe--so\ndifferent from anything around here! The way ye talk, the way ye move,\nthe gay look in your eyes! No miner ever had that happy look, Joe; me\nheart stops beatin' almost when ye look at me!\" She stopped with a sharp\ncatching of her breath, and he saw that she was struggling for\nself-control. After a moment she exclaimed, defiantly: \"But they'd tell\nye, be careful, ye daren't love that kind of man; ye'd only have your\nheart broken!\"\n\nThere was silence. For this problem the amateur sociologist had no\nsolution at hand--whether for the abstract question, or for its concrete\napplication!\n\n\n\nSECTION 31.\n\nMary forced herself to go on. \"This is how I've worked it out, Joe! I\nsaid to meself, 'Ye love this man; and it's his _love_ ye want--nothin'\nelse! If he's got a place in the world, ye'd only hold him back--and\nye'd not want to do that. Ye don't want his name, or his friends, or any\nof those things--ye want _him_!' Have ye ever heard of such a thing as\nthat?\"\n\nHer cheeks were flaming, but she continued to meet his gaze. \"Yes, I've\nheard of it,\" he answered, in a low voice.\n\n\"What would ye say to it? Is it honest? The Reverend Spragg would say\n'twas the devil, no doubt; Father O'Gorman, down in Pedro, would call it\nmortal sin; and maybe they know--but I don't! I only know I can't stand\nit any more!\"\n\nTears sprang to her eyes, and she cried out suddenly, \"Oh, take me away\nfrom here! Take me away and give me a chance, Joe! I'll ask nothing,\nI'll never stand in your way; I'll work for ye, I'll cook and wash and\ndo everything for ye, I'll wear my fingers to the bone! Or I'll go out\nand work at some job, and earn my share. And I'll make ye this\npromise--if ever ye get tired and want to leave me, ye'll not hear a\nword of complaint!\"\n\nShe made no conscious appeal to his senses; she sat gazing at him\nhonestly through her tears, and that made it all the harder to answer\nher.\n\nWhat could he say? He felt the old dangerous impulse--to take the girl\nin his arms and comfort her. When finally he spoke it was with an effort\nto keep his voice calm. \"I'd say yes, Mary, if I thought it would work.\"\n\n\"It _would_ work! It would, Joe! Ye can quit when ye want to. I mean\nit!\"\n\n\"There's no woman lives who can be happy on such terms, Mary. She wants\nher man, and she wants him to herself, and she wants him always; she's\nonly deluding herself if she believes anything else. You're over-wrought\nnow, what you've seen in the last few days has made you wild--\"\n\n\"No!\" she exclaimed. \"'Tis not only that! I been thinkin' about it for\nweeks.\"\n\n\"I know. You've been thinking, but you wouldn't have spoken if it hadn't\nbeen for this horror.\" He paused for a moment, to renew his own\nself-possession. \"It won't do, Mary,\" he declared. \"I've seen it tried\nmore than once, and I'm not so old either. My own brother tried it once,\nand ruined himself.\"\n\n\"Ah, ye're afraid to trust me, Joe!\"\n\n\"No, it's not that; what I mean is--he ruined his own heart, he made\nhimself selfish. He took everything, and gave nothing. He's much older\nthan I, so I've had a chance to see its effect on him. He's cold, he has\nno faith, even in his own nature; when you talk to him about making the\nworld better he tells you you're a fool.\"\n\n\"It's another way of bein' afraid of me,\" she insisted. \"Afraid you'd\nought to marry me!\"\n\n\"But, Mary--there's the other girl. I really love her, and I'm promised\nto her. What can I do?\"\n\n\"'Tis that I've never believed you loved her,\" she said, in a whisper.\nHer eyes fell and she began picking nervously again at the faded blue\ndress, which was smutted and grease-stained, perhaps from her recent\neffort with Mrs. Zamboni's brood. Several times Hal thought she was\ngoing to speak, but she shut her lips tightly again; he watched her, his\nheart aching.\n\nWhen finally she spoke, it was still in a whisper, and there was a note\nof humility he had never heard from her before. \"Ye'll not be wantin' to\nspeak to me, Joe, after what I've said.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mary!\" he exclaimed, and caught her hand, \"don't say I've made you\nmore unhappy! I want to help you! Won't you let me be your friend--your\nreal, true friend? Let me help you to get out of this trap; you'll have\na chance to look about, you'll find a way to be happy--the whole world\nwill seem different to you then, and you'll laugh at the idea that you\never wanted me!\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 32.\n\nThe two of them went back to the pit-mouth. It had been two days since\nthe disaster, and still the fan had not been started, and there was no\nsign of its being started. The hysteria of the women was growing, and\nthere was a tension in the crowds. Jeff Cotton had brought in a force of\nmen to assist him in keeping order. They had built a fence of barbed\nwire about the pit-mouth and its approaches, and behind this wire they\nwalked--hard-looking citizens with policemen's \"billies,\" and the bulge\nof revolvers plainly visible on their hips.\n\nDuring this long period of waiting, Hal had talks with members of his\ncheck-weighman group. They told what had happened while he was in jail,\nand this reminded him of something which had been driven from his mind\nby the explosion. Poor old John Edstrom was down in Pedro, perhaps in\ndire need. Hal went to the old Swede's cabin that night, climbed through\na window, and dug up the buried money. There were five five-dollar\nbills, and he put them in an envelope, addressed them in care of General\nDelivery, Pedro, and had Mary Burke take them to the post office and\nregister them.\n\nThe hours dragged on, and still there was no sign of the pit-mouth being\nopened. There began to be secret gatherings of the miners and their\nwives to complain at the conduct of the company; and it was natural that\nHal's friends who had started the check-weighman movement, should take\nthe lead in these. They were among the most intelligent of the workers,\nand saw farther into the meaning of events. They thought, not merely of\nthe men who were trapped under ground at this moment, but of thousands\nof others who would be trapped through years to come. Hal, especially,\nwas pondering how he could accomplish something definite before he left\nthe camp; for of course he would have to leave soon--Jeff Cotton would\nremember him, and carry out his threat to get rid of him.\n\nNewspapers had come in, with accounts of the disaster, and Hal and his\nfriends read these. It was evident that the company had been at pains to\nhave the accounts written from its own point of view. There existed some\npublic sensitiveness on the subject of mine-disasters in this state. The\ndeath-rate from accidents was seen to be mounting steadily; the reports\nof the state mine inspector showed six per thousand in one year, eight\nand a half in the next, and twenty-one and a half in the next. When\nfifty or a hundred men were killed in a single accident, and when such\naccidents kept happening, one on the heels of another, even the most\ncallous public could not help asking questions. So in this case the \"G.\nF. C.\" had been careful to minimise the loss of life, and to make\nexcuses. The accident had been owing to no fault of the company's; the\nmine had been regularly sprinkled, both with water and adobe dust, and\nso the cause of the explosion must have been the carelessness of the men\nin handling powder.\n\nIn Jack David's cabin one night there arose a discussion as to the\nnumber of men entombed in the mine. The company's estimate of the number\nwas forty, but Minetti and Olson and David agreed that this was absurd.\nAny man who went about in the crowds could satisfy himself that there\nwere two or three times as many unaccounted for. And this falsification\nwas deliberate, for the company had a checking system, whereby it knew\nthe name of every man in the mine. But most of these names were\nunpronounceable Slavish, and the owners of the names had no friends to\nmention them--at least not in any language understood by American\nnewspaper editors.\n\nIt was all a part of the system, declared Jack David: its purpose and\neffect being to enable the company to go on killing men without paying\nfor them, either in money or in prestige. It occurred to Hal that it\nmight be worth while to contradict these false statements--almost as\nworth while as to save the men who were at this moment entombed. Any one\nwho came forward to make such a contradiction would of course be giving\nhimself up to the black-list; but then, Hal regarded himself as a man\nalready condemned to that penalty.\n\nTom Olson spoke up. \"What would you do with your contradiction?\"\n\n\"Give it to the papers,\" Hal answered.\n\n\"But what papers would print it?\"\n\n\"There are two rival papers in Pedro, aren't there?\"\n\n\"One owned by Alf Raymond, the sheriff-emperor, and the other by\nVagleman, counsel for the 'G. F. C.' Which one would you try?\"\n\n\"Well then, the outside papers--those in Western City. There are\nreporters here now, and some one of them would surely take it.\"\n\nOlson answered, declaring that they would not get any but labour and\nSocialist papers to print such news. But even that was well worth doing.\nAnd Jack David, who was strong for unions and all their activities, put\nin, \"The thing to do is to take a regular census, so as to know exactly\nhow many are in the mine.\"\n\nThe suggestion struck fire, and they agreed to set to work that same\nevening. It would be a relief to do something, to have something in\ntheir minds but despair. They passed the word to Mary Burke, to Rovetta,\nKlowoski, and others; and at eleven o'clock the next morning they met\nagain, and the lists were put together, and it was found that no less\nthan a hundred and seven men and boys were positively known to be inside\nNumber One.\n\n\n\nSECTION 33.\n\nAs it happened, however, discussion of this list and the method of\ngiving it to the world was cut short by a more urgent matter. Jack David\ncame in with news of fresh trouble at the pit-mouth. The new fan was\nbeing put in place; but they were slow about it, so slow that some\npeople had become convinced that they did not mean to start the fan at\nall, but were keeping the mine sealed to prevent the fire from\nspreading. A group of such malcontents had presumed to go to Mr.\nCarmichael, the deputy state mine-inspector, to urge him to take some\naction; and the leader of these protestants, Huszar, the Austrian, who\nhad been one of Hal's check-weighman group, had been taken into custody\nand marched at double-quick to the gate of the stockade!\n\nJack David declared furthermore that he knew a carpenter who was working\nin the fan-house, and who said that no haste whatever was being made.\nAll the men at the fan-house shared that opinion; the mine was sealed,\nand would stay sealed until the company was sure the fire was out.\n\n\"But,\" argued Hal, \"if they were to open it, the fire would spread; and\nwouldn't that prevent rescue work?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" declared \"Big Jack.\" He explained that by reversing the\nfan they could draw the smoke up through the air-course, which would\nclear the main passages for a time. \"But, you see, some coal might catch\nfire, and some timbers; there might be falls of rock so they couldn't\nwork some of the rooms again.\"\n\n\"How long will they keep the mine sealed?\" cried Hal, in consternation.\n\n\"Nobody can say. In a big mine like that, a fire might smoulder for a\nweek.\"\n\n\"Everybody be dead!\" cried Rosa Minetti, wringing her hands in a sudden\naccess of grief.\n\nHal turned to Olson. \"Would they possibly do such a thing?\"\n\n\"It's been done--more than once,\" was the organiser's reply.\n\n\"Did you never hear about Cherry, Illinois?\" asked David. \"They did it\nthere, and more than three hundred people lost their lives.\" He went on\nto tell that dreadful story, known to every coal-miner. They had sealed\nthe mine, while women fainted and men tore their clothes in frenzy--some\ngoing insane. They had kept it sealed for two weeks, and when they\nopened it, there were twenty-one men still alive!\n\n\"They did the same thing in Diamondville, Wyoming,\" added Olson. \"They\nbuilt up a barrier, and when they took it away they found a heap of dead\nmen, who had crawled to it and torn their fingers to the bone trying to\nbreak through.\"\n\n\"My God!\" cried Hal, springing to his feet. \"And this man\nCarmichael--would he stand for that?\"\n\n\"He'd tell you they were doing their best,\" said \"Big Jack.\" \"And maybe\nhe thinks they are. But you'll see--something'll keep happening; they'll\ndrag on from day to day, and they'll not start the fan till they're\nready.\"\n\n\"Why, it's murder!\" cried Hal.\n\n\"It's business,\" said Tom Olson, quietly.\n\nHal looked from one to another of the faces of these working people. Not\none but had friends in that trap; not one but might be in the same trap\nto-morrow!\n\n\"You have to stand it!\" he exclaimed, half to himself.\n\n\"Don't you see the guards at the pit-mouth?\" answered David. \"Don't you\nsee the guns sticking out of their pockets?\"\n\n\"They bring in more guards this morning,\" put in Jerry Minetti. \"Rosa,\nshe see them get off.\"\n\n\"They know what they doin'!\" said Rosa. \"They only fraid we find it out!\nThey told Mrs. Zamboni she keep away or they send her out of camp. And\nold Mrs. Jonotch--her husband and three sons inside!\"\n\n\"They're getting rougher and rougher,\" declared Mrs. David. \"That big\nfellow they call Pete, that came up from Pedro--the way he's handling\nthe women is a shame!\"\n\n\"I know him,\" put in Olson; \"Pete Hanun. They had him in Sheridan when\nthe union first opened headquarters. He smashed one of our organisers in\nthe mouth and broke four of his teeth. They say he has a jail-record.\"\n\nAll through the previous year at college Hal had listened to lectures\nupon political economy, filled with the praises of a thing called\n\"Private Ownership.\" This Private Ownership developed initiative and\neconomy; it kept the wheels of industry a-roll, it kept fat the\npay-rolls of college faculties; it accorded itself with the sacred laws\nof supply and demand, it was the basis of the progress and prosperity\nwherewith America had been blessed. And here suddenly Hal found himself\nface to face with the reality of it; he saw its wolfish eyes glaring\ninto his own, he felt its smoking hot breath in his face, he saw its\ngleaming fangs and claw-like fingers, dripping with the blood of men and\nwomen and children. Private Ownership of coal-mines! Private Ownership\nof sealed-up entrances and non-existent escape-ways! Private Ownership\nof fans which did not start, of sprinklers which did not sprinkle.\nPrivate Ownership of clubs and revolvers, and of thugs and ex-convicts\nto use them, driving away rescuers and shutting up agonised widows and\norphans in their homes! Oh, the serene and well-fed priests of Private\nOwnership, chanting in academic halls the praises of the bloody Demon!\n\nSuddenly Hal stopped still. Something had risen in him, the existence of\nwhich he had never suspected. There was a new look upon his face, his\nvoice was deep as a strong man's when he spoke: \"I am going to make them\nopen that mine!\"\n\nThey looked at him. They were all of them close to the border of\nhysteria, but they caught the strange note in his utterance. \"I am going\nto make them open that mine!\"\n\n\"How?\" asked Olson.\n\n\"The public doesn't know about this thing. If the story got out, there'd\nbe such a clamour, it couldn't go on!\"\n\n\"But how will you get it out?\"\n\n\"I'll give it to the newspapers! They can't suppress such a thing--I\ndon't care how prejudiced they are!\"\n\n\"But do you think they'd believe what a miner's buddy tells them?\" asked\nMrs. David.\n\n\"I'll find a way to make them believe me,\" said Hal. \"I'm going to make\nthem open that mine!\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 34.\n\nIn the course of his wanderings about the camp, Hal had observed several\nwide-awake looking young men with notebooks in their hands. He could see\nthat these young men were being made guests of the company, chatting\nwith the bosses upon friendly terms; nevertheless, he believed that\namong them he might find one who had a conscience--or at any rate who\nwould yield to the temptation of a \"scoop.\" So, leaving the gathering at\nMrs. David's, Hal went to the pit-mouth, watching out for one of these\nreporters; when he found him, he followed him for a while, desiring to\nget him where no company \"spotter\" might interfere. At the first chance,\nhe stepped up, and politely asked the reporter to come into a side\nstreet, where they might converse undisturbed.\n\nThe reporter obeyed the request; and Hal, concealing the intensity of\nhis feelings, so as not to repel the other, let it be known that he had\nworked in North Valley for some months, and could tell much about\nconditions in the camp. There was the matter of adobe-dust, for example.\nExplosions in dry mines could be prevented by spraying the walls with\nthis material. Did the reporter happen to know that the company's claim\nto have used it was entirely false?\n\nNo, the reporter answered, he did not know this. He seemed interested,\nand asked Hal's name and occupation. Hal told him \"Joe Smith,\" a\n\"buddy,\" who had recently been chosen as check-weighman. The reporter, a\nlean and keen-faced young man, asked many questions--intelligent\nquestions; incidentally he mentioned that he was the local correspondent\nof the great press association whose stories of the disaster were sent\nto every corner of the country. This seemed to Hal an extraordinary\npiece of good fortune, and he proceeded to tell this Mr. Graham about\nthe census which some of the workers had taken; they were able to give\nthe names of a hundred and seven men and boys who were inside the mine.\nThe list was at Mr. Graham's disposal if he cared to see it. Mr. Graham\nseemed more interested than ever, and made notes in his book.\n\nAnother thing, more important yet, Hal continued; the matter of the\ndelay in getting the fan started. It had been three days since the\nexplosion, but there had been no attempt at entering the mine. Had Mr.\nGraham seen the disturbance at the pit-mouth that morning? Did he\nrealise that a man had been thrown out of camp merely because he had\nappealed to the deputy state mine-inspector? Hal told what so many had\ncome to believe--that the company was saving property at the expense of\nlife. He went on to point out the human meaning of this--he told about\nold Mrs. Rafferty, with her failing health and her eight children; about\nMrs. Zamboni, with eleven children; about Mrs. Jonotch, with a husband\nand three sons in the mine. Led on by the reporter's interest, Hal began\nto show some of his feeling. These were human beings, not animals; they\nloved and suffered, even though they were poor and humble!\n\n\"Most certainly!\" said Mr. Graham. \"You're right, and you may rest\nassured I'll look into this.\"\n\n\"There's one thing more,\" said Hal. \"If my name is mentioned, I'll be\nfired, you know.\"\n\n\"I won't mention it,\" said the other.\n\n\"Of course, if you can't publish the story without giving its source--\"\n\n\"I'm the source,\" said the reporter, with a smile. \"Your name would not\nadd anything.\"\n\nHe spoke with quiet assurance; he seemed to know so completely both the\nsituation and his own duty in regard to it, that Hal felt a thrill of\ntriumph. It was as if a strong wind had come blowing from the outside\nworld, dispelling the miasma which hung over this coal-camp. Yes, this\nreporter _was_ the outside world! He was the power of public opinion,\nmaking itself felt in this place of knavery and fear! He was the voice\nof truth, the courage and rectitude of a great organisation of\npublicity, independent of secret influences, lifted above corruption!\n\n\"I'm indebted to you,\" said Mr. Graham, at the end, and Hal's sense of\nvictory was complete. What an extraordinary chance--that he should have\nrun into the agent of the great press association! The story would go\nout to the great world of industry, which depended upon coal as its\nlife-blood. The men in the factories, the wheels of which were turned by\ncoal--the travellers on trains which were moved by coal--they would hear\nat last of the sufferings of those who toiled in the bowels of the earth\nfor them! Even the ladies, reclining upon the decks of palatial\nsteamships in gleaming tropic seas--so marvellous was the power of\nmodern news-spreading agencies, that these ladies too might hear the cry\nfor help of these toilers, and of their wives and little ones! And from\nthis great world would come an answer, a universal shout of horror, of\nexecration, that would force even old Peter Harrigan to give way! So Hal\nmused--for he was young, and this was his first crusade.\n\nHe was so happy that he was able to think of himself again, and to\nrealise that he had not eaten that day. It was noon-time, and he went\ninto Reminitsky's, and was about half through with the first course of\nReminitsky's two-course banquet, when his cruel disillusioning fell upon\nhim!\n\nHe looked up and saw Jeff Cotton striding into the dining-room, making\nstraight for him. There was blood in the marshal's eye, and Hal saw it,\nand rose, instinctively.\n\n\"Come!\" said Cotton, and took him by the coat-sleeve and marched him\nout, almost before the rest of the diners had time to catch their\nbreath.\n\nHal had no opportunity now to display his \"tea-party manners\" to the\ncamp-marshal. As they walked, Cotton expressed his opinion of him, that\nhe was a skunk, a puppy, a person of undesirable ancestry; and when Hal\nendeavoured to ask a question--which he did quite genuinely, not\ngrasping at once the meaning of what was happening--the marshal bade him\n\"shut his face,\" and emphasised the command by a twist at his\ncoat-collar. At the same time two of the huskiest mine-guards, who had\nbeen waiting at the dining-room door, took him, one by each arm, and\nassisted his progress.\n\nThey went down the street and past Jeff Cotton's office, not stopping\nthis time. Their destination was the railroad-station, and when Hal got\nthere, he saw a train standing. The three men marched him to it, not\nreleasing him till they had jammed him down into a seat.\n\n\"Now, young fellow,\" said Cotton, \"we'll see who's running this camp!\"\n\nBy this time Hal had regained a part of his self-possession. \"Do I need\na ticket?\" he asked.\n\n\"I'll see to that,\" said the marshal.\n\n\"And do I get my things?\"\n\n\"You save some questions for your college professors,\" snapped the\nmarshal.\n\nSo Hal waited; and a minute or two later a man arrived on the run with\nhis scanty belongings, rolled into a bundle and tied with a piece of\ntwine. Hal noted that this man was big and ugly, and was addressed by\nthe camp-marshal as \"Pete.\"\n\nThe conductor shouted, \"All aboard!\" And at the same time Jeff Cotton\nleaned over towards Hal and spoke in a menacing whisper: \"Take this from\nme, young fellow; don't stop in Pedro, move on in a hurry, or something\nwill happen to you on a dark night.\"\n\nAfter which he strode down the aisle, and jumped off the moving train.\nBut Hal noticed that Pete Hanun, the breaker of teeth, stayed on the car\na few seats behind him.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THREE\n\nTHE HENCHMEN OF KING COAL\n\n\n\n\nSECTION 1.\n\nIt was Hal's intention to get to Western City as quickly as possible to\ncall upon the newspaper editors. But first he must have money to travel,\nand the best way he could think of to get it was to find John Edstrom.\nHe left the train, followed by Pete Hanun; after some inquiry, he came\nupon the undertaker who had buried Edstrom's wife, and who told him\nwhere the old Swede was staying, in the home of a labouring-man nearby.\n\nEdstrom greeted him with eager questions: Who had been killed? What was\nthe situation? Hal told in brief sentences what had happened. When he\nmentioned his need of money, Edstrom answered that he had a little, and\nwould lend it, but it was not enough for a ticket to Western City. Hal\nasked about the twenty-five dollars which Mary Burke had sent by\nregistered mail; the old man had heard nothing about it, he had not been\nto the post-office. \"Let's go now!\" said Hal, at once; but as they were\nstarting downstairs, a fresh difficulty occurred to him. Pete Hanun was\non the street outside, and it was likely that he had heard about this\nmoney from Jeff Cotton; he might hold Edstrom up and take it away.\n\n\"Let me suggest something,\" put in the old man. \"Come and see my friend\nEd MacKellar. He may be able to give us some advice--even to think of\nsome way to get the mine open.\" Edstrom explained that MacKellar, an old\nScotchman, had been a miner, but was now crippled, and held some petty\noffice in Pedro. He was a persistent opponent of \"Alf\" Raymond's\nmachine, and they had almost killed him on one occasion. His home was\nnot far away, and it would take little time to consult him.\n\n\"All right,\" said Hal, and they set out at once. Pete Hanun followed\nthem, not more than a dozen yards behind, but did not interfere, and\nthey turned in at the gate of a little cottage. A woman opened the door\nfor them, and asked them into the dining-room where MacKellar was\nsitting--a grey-haired old man, twisted up with rheumatism and obliged\nto go about on crutches.\n\nHal told his story. As the Scotchman had been brought up in the mines,\nit was not necessary to go into details about the situation. When Hal\ntold his idea of appealing to the newspapers, the other responded at\nonce, \"You won't have to go to Western City. There's a man right here\nwho'll do the business for you; Keating, of the _Gazette_.\"\n\n\"The Western City _Gazette?_\" exclaimed Hal. He knew this paper; an\nevening journal selling for a cent, and read by working-men. Persons of\nculture who referred to it disposed of it with the adjective \"yellow.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said MacKellar, noting Hal's tone. \"But it's the only paper\nthat will publish your story anyway.\"\n\n\"Where is this Keating?\"\n\n\"He's been up at the mine. It's too bad you didn't meet him.\"\n\n\"Can we get hold of him now?\"\n\n\"He might be in Pedro. Try the American Hotel.\"\n\nHal went to the telephone, and in a minute was hearing for the first\ntime the cheery voice of his friend and lieutenant-to-be, \"Billy\"\nKeating. In a couple of minutes more the owner of the voice was at\nMacKellar's door, wiping the perspiration from his half-bald forehead.\nHe was round-faced, like a full moon, and as jolly as Falstaff; when you\ngot to know him better, you discovered that he was loyal as a\nNewfoundland dog. For all his bulk, Keating was a newspaper man, every\ninch of him \"on the job.\"\n\nHe started to question the young miner as soon as he was introduced, and\nit quickly became clear to Hal that here was the man he was looking for.\nKeating knew exactly what questions to ask, and had the whole story in a\nfew minutes. \"By thunder!\" he cried. \"My last edition!\" And he pulled\nout his watch, and sprang to the telephone. \"Long distance,\" he called;\nthen, \"I want the city editor of the Western City _Gazette_. And,\noperator, please see if you can't rush it through. It's very urgent, and\nlast time I had to wait nearly half an hour.\"\n\nHe turned back to Hal, and proceeded to ask more questions, at the same\ntime pulling a bunch of copy-paper from his pocket and making notes. He\ngot all Hal's statements about the lack of sprinkling, the absence of\nescape-ways, the delay in starting the fan, the concealing of the number\nof men in the mine. \"I knew things were crooked up there!\" he exclaimed.\n\"But I couldn't get a lead! They kept a man with me every minute of the\ntime. You know a fellow named Predovich?\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Hal. \"The company store-clerk; he once went through my\npockets.\"\n\nKeating made a face of disgust. \"Well, he was my chaperon. Imagine\ntrying to get the miners to talk to you with that sneak at your heels! I\nsaid to the superintendent, 'I don't need anybody to escort me around\nyour place.' And he looked at me with a nasty little smile. 'We wouldn't\nwant anything to happen to you while you're in this camp, Mr. Keating.'\n'You don't consider it necessary to protect the lives of the other\nreporters,' I said. 'No,' said he; 'but the _Gazette_ has made a great\nmany enemies, you know.' 'Drop your fooling, Mr. Cartwright,' I said.\n'You propose to have me shadowed while I'm working on this assignment?'\n'You can put it that way,' he answered, 'if you think it'll please the\nreaders of the _Gazette_.'\"\n\n\"Too bad we didn't meet!\" said Hal. \"Or if you'd run into any of our\ncheck-weighman crowd!\"\n\n\"Oh! You know about that check-weighman business!\" exclaimed the\nreporter. \"I got a hint of it--that's how I happened to be down here\nto-day. I heard there was a man named Edstrom, who'd been shut out for\nmaking trouble; and I thought if I could find him, I might get a lead.\"\n\nHal and MacKellar looked at the old Swede, and the three of them began\nto laugh. \"Here's your man!\" said MacKellar.\n\n\"And here's your check-weighman!\" added Edstrom, pointing to Hal.\n\nInstantly the reporter was on his job again; he began to fire another\nseries of questions. He would use that check-weighman story as a\n\"follow-up\" for the next day, to keep the subject of North Valley alive.\nThe story had a direct bearing on the disaster, because it showed what\nthe North Valley bosses were doing when they should have been looking\nafter the safety of their mine. \"I'll write it out this afternoon and\nsend it by mail,\" said Keating; he added, with a smile, \"That's one\nadvantage of handling news the other papers won't touch--you don't have\nto worry about losing your 'scoops'!\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 2.\n\nKeating went to the telephone again, to worry \"long distance\"; then,\ngrumbling about his last edition, he came back to ask more questions\nabout Hal's experiences. Before long he drew out the story of the young\nman's first effort in the publicity game; at which he sank back in his\nchair, and laughed until he shook, as the nursery-rhyme describes it,\n\"like a bowlful of jelly.\"\n\n\"Graham!\" he exclaimed. \"Fancy, MacKellar, he took that story to\nGraham!\"\n\nThe Scotchman seemed to find it equally funny; together they explained\nthat Graham was the political reporter of the _Eagle_, the paper in\nPedro which was owned by the Sheriff-emperor. One might call him Alf\nRaymond's journalistic jackal; there was no job too dirty for him.\n\n\"But,\" cried Hal, \"he told me he was correspondent for the Western press\nassociation!\"\n\n\"He's that, too,\" replied Billy.\n\n\"But does the press association employ spies for the 'G. F. C.'?\"\n\nThe reporter answered, drily, \"When you understand the news game better,\nyou'll realise that the one thing the press association cares about in a\ncorrespondent is that he should have respect for property. If respect\nfor property is the back-bone of his being, he can learn what news is,\nand the right way to handle it.\"\n\nKeating turned to the Scotchman. \"Do you happen to have a typewriter in\nthe house, Mr. MacKellar?\"\n\n\"An old one,\" said the other--\"lame, like myself.\"\n\n\"I'll make out with it. I'd ask this young man over to my hotel, but I\nthink he'd better keep off the streets as much as possible.\"\n\n\"You're right. If you take my advice, you'll take the typewriter\nupstairs, where there's no chance of a shot through the window.\"\n\n\"Great heavens!\" exclaimed Hal. \"Is this America, or mediaeval Italy?\"\n\n\"It's the Empire of Raymond,\" replied MacKellar. \"They shot my friend\nTom Burton dead while he stood on the steps of his home. He was opposing\nthe machine, and had evidence about ballot-frauds he was going to put\nbefore the Grand Jury.\"\n\nWhile Keating continued to fret with \"long distance,\" the old Scotchman\nwent on trying to impress upon Hal the danger of his position. Quite\nrecently an organiser of the miners' union had been beaten up in broad\nday-light and left insensible on the sidewalk; MacKellar had watched the\ntrial and acquittal of the two thugs who had committed this crime--the\nforeman of the jury being a saloon-keeper one of Raymond's heelers, and\nthe other jurymen being Mexicans, unable to comprehend a word of the\ncourt proceedings.\n\n\"Exactly such a jury as Jeff Cotton promised me!\" remarked Hal, with a\nfeeble attempt at a smile.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the other; \"and don't make any mistake about it, if they\nwant to put you away, they can do it. They run the whole machine here. I\nknow how it is, for I had a political job myself, until they found they\ncouldn't use me.\"\n\nThe old Scotchman went on to explain that he had been elected justice of\npeace, and had tried to break up the business of policemen taking money\nfrom the women of the town; he had been forced to resign, and his\nenemies had made his life a torment. Recently he had been candidate for\ndistrict judge on the Progressive ticket, and told of his efforts to\ncarry on a campaign in the coal-camps--how his circulars had been\nconfiscated, his posters torn down, his supporters \"kangarooed.\" It was\nexactly as Alec Stone, the pit-boss, had explained to Hal. In some of\nthe camps the meeting-halls belonged to the company; in others they\nbelonged to saloon-keepers whose credit depended upon Alf Raymond. In\nthe few places where there were halls that could be hired, the machine\nhad gone to the extreme of sending in rival entertainments, furnishing\nfree music and free beer in order to keep the crowds away from\nMacKellar.\n\nAll this time Billy Keating had been chafing and scolding at \"long\ndistance.\" Now at last he managed to get his call, and silence fell in\nthe room. \"Hello, Pringle, that you? This is Keating. Got a big story on\nthe North Valley disaster. Last edition put to bed yet? Put Jim on the\nwire. Hello, Jim! Got your book?\" And then Billy, evidently talking to a\nstenographer, began to tell the story he had got from Hal. Now and then\nhe would stop to repeat or spell a word; once or twice Hal corrected him\non details. So, in about a quarter of an hour, they put the job through;\nand Keating turned to Hal.\n\n\"There you are, son,\" said he. \"Your story'll be on the street in\nWestern City in a little over an hour; it'll be down here as soon\nthereafter as they can get telephone connections. And take my advice, if\nyou want to keep a whole skin, you'll be out of Pedro when that\nhappens!\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 3.\n\nWhen Hal spoke, he did not answer Billy Keating's last remark. He had\nbeen listening to a retelling of the North Valley disaster over the\ntelephone; so he was not thinking about his skin, but about a hundred\nand seven men and boys buried inside a mine.\n\n\"Mr. Keating,\" said he, \"are you sure the _Gazette_ will print that\nstory?\"\n\n\"Good Lord!\" exclaimed the other. \"What am I here for?\"\n\n\"Well, I've been disappointed once, you know.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you got into the wrong camp. We're a poor man's paper, and\nthis is what we live on.\"\n\n\"There's no chance of its being 'toned down'?\"\n\n\"Not the slightest, I assure you.\"\n\n\"There's no chance of Peter Harrigan's suppressing it?\"\n\n\"Peter Harrigan made his attempts on the _Gazette_ long ago, my boy.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Hal, \"and now tell me this--will it do the work?\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"I mean--in making them open the mine.\"\n\nKeating considered for a moment. \"I'm afraid it won't do much.\"\n\nHal looked at him blankly. He had taken it for granted the publication\nof the facts would force the company to move. But Keating explained that\nthe _Gazette_ read mainly by working-people, and so had comparatively\nlittle influence. \"We're an afternoon paper,\" he said; \"and when people\nhave been reading lies all morning, it's not easy to make them believe\nthe truth in the afternoon.\"\n\n\"But won't the story go to other papers--over the country, I mean?\"\n\n\"Yes, we have a press service; but the papers are all like the\n_Gazette_--poor man's papers. If there's something very raw, and we keep\npounding away for a long time, we can make an impression; at least we\nlimit the amount of news the Western press association can suppress. But\nwhen it comes to a small matter like sealing up workingmen in a mine,\nall we can do is to worry the 'G. F. C.' a little.\"\n\nSo Hal was just where he had begun! \"I must find some other plan,\" he\nexclaimed.\n\n\"I don't see what you can do,\" replied the other.\n\nThere was a pause, while the young miner pondered. \"I had thought of\ngoing up to Western City and appealing to the editors,\" he said, a\nlittle uncertainly.\n\n\"Well, I can tell you about that--you might as well save your car-fare.\nThey wouldn't touch your story.\"\n\n\"And if I appealed to the Governor?\"\n\n\"In the first place, he probably wouldn't see you. And if he did, he\nwouldn't do anything. He's not really the Governor, you know; he's a\npuppet put up there to fool you. He only moves when Harrigan pulls a\nstring.\"\n\n\"Of course I knew he was Old Peter's man,\" said Hal. \"But then\"--and he\nconcluded, somewhat lamely, \"What _can_ I do?\"\n\nA smile of pity came upon the reporter's face. \"I can see this is the\nfirst time you've been up against 'big business.'\" And then he added,\n\"You're young! When you've had more experience, you'll leave these\nproblems to older heads!\" But Hal failed to get the reporter's sarcasm.\nHe had heard these exact words in such deadly seriousness from his\nbrother! Besides, he had just come from scenes of horror.\n\n\"But don't you see, Mr. Keating?\" he exclaimed. \"It's impossible for me\nto sit still while those men die?\"\n\n\"I don't know about your sitting still,\" said the other. \"All I know is\nthat all your moving about isn't going to do them any good.\"\n\nHal turned to Edstrom and MacKellar. \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"listen to me\nfor a minute.\" And there was a note of pleading in his voice--as if he\nthought they were deliberately refusing to help him! \"We've got to do\nsomething about this. We've _got_ to do something! I'm new at the game,\nas Mr. Keating says; but you aren't. Put your minds on it, gentlemen,\nand help me work out a plan!\"\n\nThere was a long silence. \"God knows,\" said Edstrom, at last. \"I'd\nsuggest something if I could.\"\n\n\"And I, too,\" said MacKellar. \"You're up against a stone-wall, my boy.\nThe government here is simply a department of the 'G. F. C.' The\nofficials are crooks--company servants, all of them.\"\n\n\"Just a moment now,\" said Hal. \"Let's consider. Suppose we had a real\ngovernment--what steps would we take? We'd carry such a case to the\nDistrict Attorney, wouldn't we?\"\n\n\"Yes, no doubt of it,\" said MacKellar.\n\n\"You mentioned him before,\" said Hal. \"He threatened to prosecute some\nmine-superintendents for ballot-frauds, you said.\"\n\n\"That was while he was running for election,\" said MacKellar.\n\n\"Oh! I remember what Jeff Cotton said--that he was friendly to the\nminers in his speeches, and to the companies in his acts.\"\n\n\"That's the man,\" said the other, drily.\n\n\"Well,\" argued Hal, \"oughtn't I go to him, to give him a chance, at\nleast? You can't tell, he might have a heart inside him.\"\n\n\"It isn't a heart he needs,\" replied MacKellar; \"it's a back-bone.\"\n\n\"But surely I ought to put it up to him! If he won't do anything, at\nleast I'll put him on record, and it'll make another story for you,\nwon't it, Mr. Keating?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's true,\" admitted the reporter. \"What would you ask him to\ndo?\"\n\n\"Why, to lay the matter before the Grand Jury; to bring indictments\nagainst the North Valley bosses.\"\n\n\"But that would take a long time; it wouldn't save the men in the mine.\"\n\n\"What might save them would be the threat of it.\" MacKellar put in. \"I\ndon't think any threat of Dick Barker's would count for that much. The\nbosses know they could stop him.\"\n\n\"Well, isn't there somebody else? Shouldn't I try the courts?\"\n\n\"What courts?\"\n\n\"I don't know. You tell me.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the Scotchman, \"to begin at the bottom, there's a justice\nof the peace.\"\n\n\"Who's he?\"\n\n\"Jim Anderson, a horse-doctor. He's like any other J.P. you ever\nknew--he lives on petty graft.\"\n\n\"Is there a higher court?\"\n\n\"Yes, the district court; Judge Denton. He's the law-partner of\nVagleman, counsel for the 'G. F. C.' How far would you expect to get\nwith him?\"\n\n\"I suppose I'm clutching at straws,\" said Hal. \"But they say that's what\na drowning man does. Anyway, I'm going to see these people, and maybe\nout of the lot of them I can find one who'll act. It can't do any harm!\"\n\nThe three men thought of some harm it might do; they tried to make Hal\nconsider the danger of being slugged Or shot. \"They'll do it!\" exclaimed\nMacKellar. \"And no trouble for them--they'll prove you were stabbed by a\ndrunken Dago, quarrelling over some woman.\"\n\nBut Hal had got his head set; he believed he could put this job through\nbefore his enemies had time to lay any plans. Nor would he let any of\nhis friends accompany him; he had something more important for both\nEdstrom and Keating to do--and as for MacKellar, he could not get about\nrapidly enough. Hal bade Edstrom go to the post-office and get the\nregistered letter, and proceed at once to change the bills. It was his\nplan to make out affidavits, and if the officials here would not act, to\ntake the affidavits to the Governor. And for this he would need money.\nMeantime, he said, let Billy Keating write out the check-weighman story,\nand in a couple of hours meet him at the American Hotel, to get copies\nof the affidavits for the _Gazette_.\n\nHal was still wearing the miner's clothes he had worn on the night of\nhis arrest in Edstrom's cabin. But he declined MacKellar's offer to lend\nhim a business-suit; the old Scotchman's clothes would not fit him, he\nknew, and it would be better to make his appeal as a real miner than as\na misfit gentleman.\n\nThese matters being settled, Hal went out upon the street, where Pete\nHanun, the breaker of teeth, fell in behind him. The young miner at once\nbroke into a run, and the other followed suit, and so the two of them\nsped down the street, to the wonder of people on the way. As Hal had had\npractice as a sprinter, no doubt Pete was glad that the District\nAttorney's office was not far away!\n\n\n\nSECTION 4.\n\nMr. Richard Parker was busy, said the clerk in toe outer office; for\nwhich Hal was not sorry, as it gave him a chance to get his breath.\nSeeing a young man flushed and panting, the clerk stared with curiosity;\nbut Hal offered no explanation, and the breaker of teeth waited on the\nstreet outside.\n\nMr. Parker received his caller in a couple of minutes. He was a well-fed\ngentleman with generous neck and chin, freshly shaved and rubbed with\ntalcum powder. His clothing was handsome, his linen immaculate; one got\nthe impression of a person who \"did himself well.\" There were papers on\nhis desk, and he looked preoccupied.\n\n\"Well?\" said he, with a swift glance at the young miner.\n\n\"I understand that I am speaking to the District Attorney of Pedro\nCounty?\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"Mr. Parker, have you given any attention to the circumstances of the\nNorth Valley disaster?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Parker. \"Why?\"\n\n\"I have just come from North Valley, and I can give you information\nwhich may be of interest to you. There are a hundred and seven people\nentombed in the mine, and the company officials have sealed it, and are\nsacrificing those lives.\"\n\nThe other put down the correspondence, and made an examination of his\ncaller from under his heavy eyelids. \"How do you know this?\"\n\n\"I left there only a few hours ago. The facts are known to all the\nworkers in the camp.\"\n\n\"You are speaking from what you heard?\"\n\n\"I am speaking from what I know at first hand. I saw the disaster, I saw\nthe pit-mouth boarded over and covered with canvas. I know a man who was\ndriven out of camp this morning for complaining about the delay in\nstarting the fan. It has been over three days since the explosion, and\nstill nothing has been done.\"\n\nMr. Parker proceeded to fire a series of questions, in the sharp,\nsuspicious manner customary to prosecuting officials. But Hal did not\nmind that; it was the man's business to make sure.\n\nPresently he demanded to know how he could get corroboration of Hal's\nstatements.\n\n\"You'll have to go up there,\" was the reply.\n\n\"You say the facts are known to the men. Give me the names of some of\nthem.\"\n\n\"I have no authority to give their names, Mr. Parker.\"\n\n\"What authority do you need? They will tell me, won't they?\"\n\n\"They may, and they may not. One man has already lost his job; not every\nman cares to lose his job.\"\n\n\"You expect me to go up there on your bare say-so?\"\n\n\"I offer you more than my say-so. I offer an affidavit.\"\n\n\"But what do I know about you?\"\n\n\"You know that I worked in North Valley--or you can verify the fact by\nusing the telephone. My name is Joe Smith, and I was a miner's helper in\nNumber Two.\"\n\nBut that was not sufficient, said Mr. Parker; his time was valuable, and\nbefore he took a trip to North Valley he must have the names of\nwitnesses who would corroborate these statements.\n\n\"I offer you an affidavit!\" exclaimed Hal. \"I say that I have knowledge\nthat a crime is being committed--that a hundred and seven human lives\nare being sacrificed. You don't consider that a sufficient reason for\neven making inquiry?\"\n\nThe District Attorney answered again that he desired to do his duty, he\ndesired to protect the workers in their rights; but he could not afford\nto go off on a \"wild goose chase,\" he must have the names of witnesses.\nAnd Hal found himself wondering. Was the man merely taking the first\npretext for doing nothing? Or could it be that an official of the state\nwould go as far as to help the company by listing the names of\n\"trouble-makers\"?\n\nIn spite of his distrust, Hal was resolved to give the man every chance\nhe could. He went over the whole story of the disaster. He took Mr.\nParker up to the camp, showed him the agonised women and terrified\nchildren crowding about the pit-mouth, driven back with clubs and\nrevolvers. He named family after family, widows and mothers and orphans.\nHe told of the miners clamouring for a chance to risk their lives to\nsave their fellows. He let his own feelings sweep him along; he pleaded\nwith fervour for his suffering friends.\n\n\"Young man,\" said the other, breaking in upon his eloquence, \"how long\nhave you been working in North Valley?\"\n\n\"About ten weeks.\"\n\n\"How long have you been working in coal-mines?\"\n\n\"That was my first experience.\"\n\n\"And you think that in ten weeks you have learned enough to entitle you\nto bring a charge of 'murder' against men who have spent their lives in\nlearning the business of mining?\"\n\n\"As I have told you,\" exclaimed Hal, \"it's not merely my opinion; it's\nthe opinion of the oldest and most experienced of the miners. I tell you\nno effort whatever is being made to save those men! The bosses care\nnothing about their men! One of them, Alec Stone, was heard by a crowd\nof people to say, 'Damn the men! Save the mules!'\"\n\n\"Everybody up there is excited,\" declared the other. \"Nobody can think\nstraight at present--you can't think straight yourself. If the mine's on\nfire, and if the fire is spreading to such an extent that it can't be\nput out--\"\n\n\"But, Mr. Parker, how can you say that it's spreading to such an\nextent?\"\n\n\"Well, how can you say that it isn't?\"\n\nThere was a pause. \"I understand there's a deputy mine-inspector up\nthere,\" said the District Attorney, suddenly. \"What's his name?\"\n\n\"Carmichael,\" said Hal.\n\n\"Well, and what does _he_ say about it?\"\n\n\"It was for appealing to him that the miner, Huszar, was turned out of\ncamp.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Parker--and there came a note into his voice by which\nHal knew that he had found the excuse he sought--\"Well, it's\nCarmichael's business, and I have no right to butt in on it. If he comes\nto me and asks for indictments, I'll act--but not otherwise. That's all\nI have to say about it.\"\n\nAnd Hal rose. \"Very well, Mr. Parker,\" said he. \"I have put the facts\nbefore you. I was told you wouldn't do anything, but I wanted to give\nyou a chance. Now I'm going to ask the Governor for your removal!\" And\nwith these words the young miner strode out of the office.\n\n\n\nSECTION 5.\n\nHal went down the street to the American Hotel, where there was a public\nstenographer. When this young woman discovered the nature of the\nmaterial he proposed to dictate, her fingers trembled visibly; but she\ndid not refuse the task, and Hal proceeded to set forth the\ncircumstances of the sealing of the pit-mouth of Number One Mine at\nNorth Valley, and to pray for warrants for the arrest of Enos Cartwright\nand Alec Stone. Then he gave an account of how he had been selected as\ncheck-weighman and been refused access to the scales; and with all the\nlegal phraseology he could rake up, he prayed for the arrest of Enos\nCartwright and James Peters, superintendent and tipple-boss at North\nValley, for these offences. In another affidavit he narrated how Jeff\nCotton, camp-marshal, had seized him at night, mistreated him, and shut\nhim in prison for thirty-six hours without warrant or charge; also how\nCotton, Pete Hanun, and two other parties by name unknown, had illegally\ndriven him from the town of North Valley, threatening him with violence;\nfor which he prayed the arrest of Jeff Cotton, Pete Hanun, and the two\nparties unknown.\n\nBefore this task was finished, Billy Keating came in, bringing the\ntwenty-five dollars which Edstrom had got from the post-office. They\nfound a notary public, before whom Hal made oath to each document; and\nwhen these had been duly inscribed and stamped with the seal of the\nstate, he gave carbon copies to Keating, who hurried off to catch a\nmail-train which was just due. Billy would not trust such things to the\nlocal post-office; for Pedro was the hell of a town, he declared. As\nthey went out on the street again they noticed that their body-guard had\nbeen increased by another husky-looking personage, who made no attempt\nto conceal what he was doing.\n\nHal went around the corner to an office bearing the legend, \"J.W.\nAnderson, Justice of the Peace.\"\n\nJim Anderson, the horse-doctor, sat at his desk within. He had evidently\nchewed tobacco before he assumed the ermine, and his reddish-coloured\nmoustache still showed the stains. Hal observed such details, trying to\nweigh his chances of success. He presented the affidavit describing his\ntreatment in North Valley, and sat waiting while His Honour read it\nthrough with painful slowness.\n\n\"Well,\" said the man, at last, \"what do you want?\"\n\n\"I want a warrant for Jeff Cotton's arrest.\"\n\nThe other studied him for a minute. \"No, young fellow,\" said he. \"You\ncan't get no such warrant here.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because Cotton's a deputy-sheriff; he had a right to arrest you.\"\n\n\"To arrest me without a warrant?\"\n\n\"How do you know he didn't have a warrant?\"\n\n\"He admitted to me that he didn't.\"\n\n\"Well, whether he had a warrant or not, it was his business to keep\norder in the camp.\"\n\n\"You mean he can do anything he pleases in the camp?\"\n\n\"What I mean is, it ain't my business to interfere. Why didn't you see\nSi Adams, up to the camp?\"\n\n\"They didn't give me any chance to see him.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied the other, \"there's nothing I can do for you. You can\nsee that for yourself. What kind of discipline could they keep in them\ncamps if any fellow that had a kick could come down here and have the\nmarshal arrested?\"\n\n\"Then a camp-marshal can act without regard to the law?\"\n\n\"I didn't say that.\"\n\n\"Suppose he had committed murder--would you give a warrant for that?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course, if it was murder.\"\n\n\"And if you knew that he was in the act of committing murder in a\ncoal-camp--would you try to stop him?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course.\"\n\n\"Then here's another affidavit,\" said Hal; and he produced the one about\nthe sealing of the mine. There was silence while Justice Anderson read\nit through.\n\nBut again he shook his head. \"No, you can't get no such warrants here.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because it ain't my business to run a coal-mine. I don't understand it,\nand I'd make a fool of myself if I tried to tell them people how to run\ntheir business.\"\n\nHal argued with him. Could company officials in charge of a coal-mine\ncommit any sort of outrage upon their employ\u00c3\u00a9s, and call it running\ntheir business? Their control of the mine in such an emergency as this\nmeant the power of life and death over a hundred and seven men and boys;\ncould it be that the law had nothing to say in such a situation? But Mr.\nAnderson only shook his head; it was not his business to interfere. Hal\nmight go up to the court-house and see Judge Denton about it. So Hal\ngathered up his affidavits and went out to the street again--where there\nwere now three husky-looking personages waiting to escort him.\n\n\n\nSECTION 6.\n\nThe district court was in session and Hal sat for a while in the\ncourt-room, watching Judge Denton. Here was another prosperous and\nwell-fed appearing gentleman, with a rubicund visage shining over the\ntop of his black silk robe. The young miner found himself regarding both\nthe robe and the visage with suspicion. Could it be that Hal was\nbecoming cynical, and losing his faith in his fellow man? What he\nthought of, in connection with the Judge's appearance, was that there\nwas a living to be made sitting on the bench, while one's partner\nappeared before the bench as coal-company counsel!\n\nIn an interval of the proceedings, Hal spoke to the clerk, and was told\nthat he might see the judge at four-thirty; but a few minutes later Pete\nHanun came in and whispered to this clerk. The clerk looked at Hal, then\nhe went up and whispered to the Judge. At four-thirty, when the court\nwas declared adjourned, the Judge rose and disappeared into his private\noffice; and when Hal applied to the clerk, the latter brought out the\nmessage that Judge Denton was too busy to see him.\n\nBut Hal was not to be disposed of in that easy fashion. There was a side\ndoor to the court-room, with a corridor beyond it, and while he stood\narguing with the clerk he saw the rubicund visage of the Judge flit\npast.\n\nHe darted in pursuit. He did not shout or make a disturbance; but when\nhe was close behind his victim, he said, quietly, \"Judge Denton, I\nappeal to you for justice!\"\n\nThe Judge turned and looked at him, his countenance showing annoyance.\n\"What do you want?\"\n\nIt was a ticklish moment, for Pete Hanun was at Hal's heels, and it\nwould have needed no more than a nod from the Judge to cause him to\ncollar Hal. But the Judge, taken by surprise, permitted himself to\nparley with the young miner; and the detective hesitated, and finally\nfell back a step or two.\n\nHal repeated his appeal. \"Your Honour, there are a hundred and seven men\nand boys now dying up at the North Valley mine. They are being murdered,\nand I am trying to save their lives!\"\n\n\"Young man,\" said the Judge, \"I have an urgent engagement down the\nstreet.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" replied Hal, \"I will walk with you and tell you as you go.\"\nNor did he give \"His Honour\" a chance to say whether this arrangement\nwas pleasing to him; he set out by his side, with Pete Hanun and the\nother two men some ten yards in the rear.\n\nHal told the story as he had told it to Mr. Richard Parker; and he\nreceived the same response. Such matters were not easy to decide about;\nthey were hardly a Judge's business. There was a state official on the\nground, and it was for him to decide if there was violation of law.\n\nHal repeated his statement that a man who made a complaint to this\nofficial had been thrown out of camp. \"And I was thrown out also, your\nHonour.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"Nobody told me what for.\"\n\n\"Tut, tut, young man! They don't throw men out without telling them the\nreason!\"\n\n\"But they _do_, your Honour! Shortly before that they locked me up in\njail, and held me for thirty-six hours without the slightest show of\nauthority.\"\n\n\"You must have been doing something!\"\n\n\"What I had done was to be chosen by a committee of miners to act as\ntheir check-weighman.\"\n\n\"Their check-weighman?\"\n\n\"Yes, your Honour. I am informed there's a law providing that when the\nmen demand a check-weighman, and offer to pay for him, the company must\npermit him to inspect the weights. Is that correct?\"\n\n\"It is, I believe.\"\n\n\"And there's a penalty for refusing?\"\n\n\"The law always carries a penalty, young man.\"\n\n\"They tell me that law has been on the statute-books for fifteen or\nsixteen years, and that the penalty is from twenty-five to five hundred\ndollars fine. It's a case about which there can be no dispute, your\nHonour--the miners notified the superintendent that they desired my\nservices, and when I presented myself at the tipple, I was refused\naccess to the scales; then I was seized and shut up in jail, and finally\nturned out of the camp. I have made affidavit to these facts, and I\nthink I have the right to ask for warrants for the guilty men.\"\n\n\"Can you produce witnesses to your statements?\"\n\n\"I can, your Honour. One of the committee of miners, John Edstrom, is\nnow in Pedro, having been kept out of his home, which he had rented and\npaid for. The other, Mike Sikoria, was also thrown out of camp. There\nare many others at North Valley who know all about it.\"\n\nThere was a pause. Judge Denton for the first time took a good look at\nthe young miner at his side; and then he drew his brows together in\nsolemn thought, and his voice became deep and impressive. \"I shall take\nthis matter under advisement. What is your name, and where do you live?\"\n\n\"Joe Smith, your Honour. I'm staying at Edward MacKellar's, but I don't\nknow how long I'll be able to stay there. There are company thugs\nwatching the place all the time.\"\n\n\"That's wild talk!\" said the Judge, impatiently.\n\n\"As it happens,\" said Hal, \"we are being followed by three of them at\nthis moment--one of them the same Pete Hanun who helped to drive me out\nof North Valley. If you will turn your head you will see them behind\nus.\"\n\nBut the portly Judge did not turn his head.\n\n\"I have been informed,\" Hal continued, \"that I am taking my life in my\nhands by my present course of action. I believe I'm entitled to ask for\nprotection.\"\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\"\n\n\"To begin with, I'd like you to cause the arrest of the men who are\nshadowing me.\"\n\n\"It's not my business to cause such arrests. You should apply to a\npoliceman.\"\n\n\"I don't see any policeman. Will you tell me where to find one?\"\n\nHis Honour was growing weary of such persistence. \"Young man, what's the\nmatter with you is that you've been reading dime novels, and they've got\non your nerves!\"\n\n\"But the men are right behind me, your Honour! Look at them!\"\n\n\"I've told you it's not my business, young man!\"\n\n\"But, your Honour, before I can find a policeman I may be dead!\"\n\nThe other appeared to be untroubled by this possibility.\n\n\"And, your Honour, while you are taking these matters under advisement,\nthe men in the mine will be dead!\"\n\nAgain there was no reply.\n\n\"I have some affidavits here,\" said Hal. \"Do you wish them?\"\n\n\"You can give them to me if you want to,\" said the other.\n\n\"You don't ask me for them?\"\n\n\"I haven't yet.\"\n\n\"Then just one more question--if you will pardon me, your Honour. Can\nyou tell me where I can find an honest lawyer in this town--a man who\nmight be willing to take a case against the interests of the General\nFuel Company?\"\n\nThere was a silence--a long, long silence. Judge Denton, of the firm of\nDenton and Vagleman, stared straight in front of him as he walked.\nWhatever complicated processes might have been going on inside his mind,\nhis judicial features did not reveal them. \"No, young man,\" he said at\nlast, \"it's not my business to give you information about lawyers.\" And\nwith that the judge turned on his heel and went into the Elks' Club.\n\n\n\nSECTION 7.\n\nHal stood and watched the portly figure until it disappeared; then he\nturned back and passed the three detectives, who stopped. He stared at\nthem, but made no sign, nor did they. Some twenty feet behind him, they\nfell in and followed as before.\n\nJudge Denton had suggested consulting a policeman; and suddenly Hal\nnoticed that he was passing the City Hall, and it occurred to him that\nthis matter of his being shadowed might properly be brought to the\nattention of the mayor of Pedro. He wondered what the chief magistrate\nof such a \"hell of a town\" might be like; after due inquiry, he found\nhimself in the office of Mr. Ezra Perkins, a mild-mannered little\ngentleman who had been in the undertaking-business, before he became a\nfigure-head for the so-called \"Democratic\" machine.\n\nHe sat pulling nervously at a neatly trimmed brown beard, trying to\nwriggle out of the dilemma into which Hal put him. Yes, it might\npossibly be that a young miner was being followed on the streets of the\ntown; but whether or not this was against the law depended on the\ncircumstances. If he had made a disturbance in North Valley, and there\nwas reason to believe that he might be intending trouble, doubtless the\ncompany was keeping track of him. But Pedro was a law-abiding place, and\nhe would be protected in his rights so long as he behaved himself.\n\nHal replied by citing what MacKellar had told him about men being\nslugged on the streets in broad day-light. To this Mr. Perkins answered\nthat there was uncertainty about the circumstances of these cases;\nanyhow, they had happened before he became mayor. His was a reform\nadministration, and he had given strict orders to the Chief of Police\nthat there were to be no more incidents of the sort.\n\n\"Will you go with me to the Chief of Police and give him orders now?\"\ndemanded Hal.\n\n\"I do not consider it necessary,\" said Mr. Perkins.\n\nHe was about to go home, it seemed. He was a pitiful little rodent, and\nit was a shame to torment him; but Hal stuck to him for ten or twenty\nminutes longer, arguing and insisting--until finally the little rodent\nbolted for the door, and made his escape in an automobile. \"You can go\nto the Chief of Police yourself,\" were his last words, as he started the\nmachine; and Hal decided to follow the suggestion. He had no hope left,\nbut he was possessed by a kind of dogged rage. He _would_ not let go!\n\nUpon inquiry of a passer-by, he learned that police headquarters was in\nthis same building, the entrance being just round the corner. He went\nin, and found a man in uniform writing at a desk, who stated that the\nChief had \"stepped down the street.\" Hal sat down to wait, by a window\nthrough which he could look out upon the three gunmen loitering across\nthe way.\n\nThe man at the desk wrote on, but now and then he eyed the young miner\nwith that hostility which American policemen cultivate toward the lower\nclasses. To Hal this was a new phenomenon, and he found himself suddenly\nwishing that he had put on MacKellar's clothes. Perhaps a policeman\nwould not have noticed the misfit!\n\nThe Chief came in. His blue uniform concealed a burly figure, and his\nmoustache revealed the fact that his errand down the street had had to\ndo with beer. \"Well, young fellow?\" said he, fixing his gaze upon Hal.\n\nHal explained his errand.\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\" asked the Chief, in a decidedly hostile\nvoice.\n\n\"I want you to make those men stop following me.\"\n\n\"How can I make them stop?\"\n\n\"You can lock them up, if necessary. I can point them out to you, if\nyou'll step to the window.\"\n\nBut the other made no move. \"I reckon if they're follerin' you, they've\ngot some reason for it. Have you been makin' trouble in the camps?\" He\nasked this question with sudden force, as if it had occurred to him that\nit might be his duty to lock up Hal.\n\n\"No,\" said Hal, speaking as bravely as he could--\"no indeed, I haven't\nbeen making trouble. I've only been demanding my rights.\"\n\n\"How do I know what you been doin'?\"\n\nThe young miner was willing to explain, but the other cut him short.\n\"You behave yourself while you're in this town, young feller, d'you see?\nIf you do, nobody'll bother you.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Hal, \"they've already threatened to bother me.\"\n\n\"What did they say?\"\n\n\"They said something might happen to me on a dark night.\"\n\n\"Well, so it might--you might fall down and hit your nose.\"\n\nThe Chief was pleased with this wit, but only for a moment. \"Understand,\nyoung feller, we'll give you your rights in this town, but we got no\nlove for agitators, and we don't pretend to have. See?\"\n\n\"You call a man an agitator when he demands his legal rights?\"\n\n\"I ain't got time to argue with you, young feller. It's no easy matter\nkeepin' order in coal-camps, and I ain't going to meddle in the\nbusiness. I reckon the company detectives has got as good a right in\nthis town as you.\"\n\nThere was a pause. Hal saw that there was nothing to be gained by\nfurther discussion with the Chief. It was his first glimpse of the\nAmerican policeman as he appears to the labouring man in revolt, and he\nfound it an illuminating experience. There was dynamite in his heart as\nhe turned and went out to the street; nor was the amount of the\nexplosive diminished by the mocking grins which he noted upon the faces\nof Pete Hanun and the other two husky-looking personages.\n\n\n\nSECTION 8.\n\nHal judged that he had now exhausted his legal resources in Pedro; the\nChief of Police had not suggested any one else he might call upon, so\nthere seemed nothing he could do but go back to MacKellar's and await\nthe hour of the night train to Western City. He started to give his\nguardians another run, by way of working off at least a part of his own\ntemper; but he found that they had anticipated this difficulty. An\nautomobile came up and the three of them stepped in. Not to be outdone,\nHal engaged a hack, and so the expedition returned in pomp to\nMacKellar's.\n\nHal found the old cripple in a state of perturbation. All that afternoon\nhis telephone had been ringing; one person after another had warned\nhim--some pleading with him, some abusing him. It was evident that among\nthem were people who had a hold on the old man; but he was undaunted,\nand would not hear of Hal's going to stay at the hotel until train-time.\n\nThen Keating returned, with an exciting tale to tell. Schulman, general\nmanager of the \"G. F. C.,\" had been sending out messengers to hunt for\nhim, and finally had got him in his office, arguing and pleading,\ncajoling and denouncing him by turns. He had got Cartwright on the\ntelephone, and the North Valley superintendent had laboured to convince\nKeating that he had done the company a wrong. Cartwright had told a\nstory about Hal's efforts to hold up the company for money.\n\"Incidentally,\" said Keating, \"he added the charge that you had seduced\na girl in his camp.\"\n\nHal stared at his friend. \"Seduced a girl!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"That's what he said; a red-headed Irish girl.\"\n\n\"Well, damn his soul!\"\n\nThere followed a silence, broken by a laugh from Billy. \"Don't glare at\nme like that. _I_ didn't say it!\"\n\nBut Hal continued to glare, nevertheless. \"The dirty little skunk!\"\n\n\"Take it easy, sonny,\" said the fat man, soothingly. \"It's quite the\nusual thing, to drag in a woman. It's so easy--for of course there\nalways _is_ a woman. There's one in this case, I suppose?\"\n\n\"There's a perfectly decent girl.\"\n\n\"But you've been friendly with her? You've been walking around where\npeople can see you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"So you see, they've got you. There's nothing you can do about a thing\nof that sort.\"\n\n\"You wait and see!\" Hal burst out.\n\nThe other gazed curiously at the angry young miner. \"What'll you do?\nBeat him up some night?\"\n\nBut the young miner did not answer. \"You say he described the girl?\"\n\n\"He was kind enough to say she was a red-headed beauty, and with no one\nto protect her but a drunken father. I could understand that must have\nmade it pretty hard for her, in one of these coal-camps.\" There was a\npause. \"But see here,\" said the reporter, \"you'll only do the girl harm\nby making a row. Nobody believes that women in coal-camps have any\nvirtue. God knows, I don't see how they do have, considering the sort of\nmen who run the camps, and the power they have.\"\n\n\"Mr. Keating,\" said Hal, \"did _you_ believe what Cartwright told you?\"\n\nKeating had started to light a cigar. He stopped in the middle, and his\neyes met Hal's. \"My dear boy,\" said he, \"I didn't consider it my\nbusiness to have an opinion.\"\n\n\"But what did you say to Cartwright?\"\n\n\"Ah! That's another matter. I said that I'd been a newspaper man for a\ngood many years, and I knew his game.\"\n\n\"Thank you for that,\" said Hal. \"You may be interested to know there\nisn't any truth in the story.\"\n\n\"Glad to hear it,\" said the other. \"I believe you.\"\n\n\"Also you may be interested to know that I shan't drop the matter until\nI've made Cartwright take it back.\"\n\n\"Well, you're an enterprising cuss!\" laughed the reporter. \"Haven't you\ngot enough on your hands, with all the men you're going to get out of\nthe mine?\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 9.\n\nBilly Keating went out again, saying that he knew a man who might be\nwilling to talk to him on the quiet, and give him some idea what was\ngoing to happen to Hal. Meantime Hal and Edstrom sat down to dinner with\nMacKellar. The family were afraid to use the dining-room of their home,\nbut spread a little table in the upstairs hall. The distress of mind of\nMacKellar's wife and daughter was apparent, and this brought home to Hal\nthe terror of life in this coal-country. Here were American women, in an\nAmerican home, a home with evidences of refinement and culture; yet they\nfelt and acted as if they were Russian conspirators, in terror of\nSiberia and the knout!\n\nThe reporter was gone a couple of hours; when he came back, he brought\nnews. \"You can prepare for trouble, young fellow.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Jeff Cotton's in town.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"I saw him in an automobile. If he left North Valley at this time, it\nwas for something serious, you may be sure.\"\n\n\"What does he mean to do?\"\n\n\"There's no telling. He may have you slugged; he may have you run out of\ntown and dumped out in the desert; he may just have you arrested.\"\n\nHal considered for a moment. \"For slander?\"\n\n\"Or for vagrancy; or on suspicion of having robbed a bank in Texas, or\nmurdered your great-grandmother in Tasmania. The point is, he'll keep\nyou locked up till this trouble has blown over.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Hal, \"I don't want to be locked up. I want to go up to\nWestern City. I'm waiting for the train.\"\n\n\"You may have to wait till morning,\" replied Keating. \"There's been\ntrouble on the railroad--a freight-car broke down and ripped up the\ntrack; it'll be some time before it's clear.\"\n\nThey discussed this new problem back and forth. MacKellar wanted to get\nin half a dozen friends and keep guard over Hal during the night; and\nHal had about agreed to this idea, when the discussion was given a new\nturn by a chance remark of Keating's. \"Somebody else is tied up by the\nrailroad accident. The Coal King's son!\"\n\n\"The Coal King's son?\" echoed Hal.\n\n\"Young Percy Harrigan. He's got a private car here--or rather a whole\ntrain. Think of it--dining-car, drawing-room car, two whole cars with\nsleeping apartments! Wouldn't you like to be a son of the Coal King?\"\n\n\"Has he come on account of the mine-disaster?\"\n\n\"Mine-disaster?\" echoed Keating. \"I doubt if he's heard of it. They've\nbeen on a trip to the Grand Canyon, I was told; there's a baggage-car\nwith four automobiles.\"\n\n\"Is Old Peter with them?\"\n\n\"No, he's in New York. Percy's the host. He's got one of his automobiles\nout, and was up in town--two other fellows and some girls.\"\n\n\"Who's in his party?\"\n\n\"I couldn't find out. You can see, it might be a story for the\n_Gazette_--the Coal King's son, coming by chance at the moment when a\nhundred and seven of his serfs are perishing in the mine! If I could\nonly have got him to say a word about the disaster! If I could even have\ngot him to say he didn't know about it!\"\n\n\"Did you try?\"\n\n\"What am I a reporter for?\"\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"Nothing happened; except that he froze me stiff.\"\n\n\"Where was this?\"\n\n\"On the street. They stopped at a drug-store, and I stepped up. 'Is this\nMr. Percy Harrigan?' He was looking into the store, over my head. 'I'm a\nreporter,' I said, 'and I'd like to ask you about the accident up at\nNorth Valley.' 'Excuse me,' he said, in a tone--gee, it makes your blood\ncold to think of it! 'Just a word,' I pleaded. 'I don't give\ninterviews,' he answered; and that was all--he continued looking over my\nhead, and everybody else staring in front of them. They had turned to\nice at my first word. If ever I felt like a frozen worm!\"\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\"Ain't it wonderful,\" reflected Billy, \"how quick you can build up an\naristocracy! When you looked at that car, the crowd in it and the airs\nthey wore, you'd think they'd been running the world since the time of\nWilliam the Conqueror. And Old Peter came into this country with a\npedlar's pack on his shoulders!\"\n\n\"We're hustlers here,\" put in MacKellar.\n\n\"We'll hustle all the way to hell in a generation more,\" said the\nreporter. Then, after a minute, \"Say, but there's one girl in that bunch\nthat was the real thing! She sure did get me! You know all those fluffy\nthings they do themselves up in--soft and fuzzy, makes you think of\nspring-time orchards. This one was exactly the colour of\napple-blossoms.\"\n\n\"You're susceptible to the charms of the ladies?\" inquired Hal, mildly.\n\n\"I am,\" said the other. \"I know it's all fake, but just the same, it\nmakes my little heart go pit-a-pat. I always want to think they're as\nlovely as they look.\"\n\nHal's smile became reminiscent, and he quoted:\n\n  \"Oh Liza-Ann, come out with me,\n    The moon is a-shinin' in the monkey-puzzle tree!\"\n\nThen he stopped, with a laugh. \"Don't wear your heart on your sleeve,\nMr. Keating. She wouldn't be above taking a peck at it as she passed.\"\n\n\"At me? A worm of a newspaper reporter?\"\n\n\"At you, a man!\" laughed Hal. \"I wouldn't want to accuse the lady of\nposing; but a lady has her role in life, and has to keep her hand in.\"\n\nThere was a pause. The reporter was looking at the young miner with\nsudden curiosity. \"See here,\" he remarked, \"I've been wondering about\nyou. How do you come to know so much about the psychology of the leisure\nclass?\"\n\n\"I used to have money once,\" said Hal. \"My family's gone down as quickly\nas the Harrigans have come up.\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 10.\n\nHal went on to question Keating about the apple-blossom girl. \"Maybe I\ncould guess who she is. What colour was her hair?\"\n\n\"The colour of molasses taffy when you've pulled it,\" said Billy; \"but\nall fluffy and wonderful, with star-dust in it. Her eyes were brown, and\nher cheeks pink and cream.\"\n\n\"She had two rows of pearly white teeth, that flashed at you when she\nsmiled?\"\n\n\"She didn't smile, unfortunately.\"\n\n\"Then her brown eyes gazed at you, wide open, full of wonder?\"\n\n\"Yes, they did--only it was into the drug-store window.\"\n\n\"Did she wear a white hat of soft straw, with a green and white flower\ngarden on it, and an olive green veil, and maybe cream white ribbons?\"\n\n\"By George, I believe you've seen her!\" exclaimed the reporter.\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Hal. \"Or maybe I'm describing the girl on the cover of one\nof the current magazines!\" He smiled; but then, seeing the other's\ncuriosity, \"Seriously, I think I do know your young lady. If you\nannounce that Miss Jessie Arthur is a member of the Harrigan party, you\nwon't be taking a long chance.\"\n\n\"I can't afford to take any chance at all,\" said the reporter. \"You mean\nRobert Arthur's daughter?\"\n\n\"Heiress-apparent of the banking business of Arthur and Sons,\" said Hal.\n\"It happens I know her by sight.\"\n\n\"How's that?\"\n\n\"I worked in a grocery-store where she used to come.\"\n\n\"Whereabouts?\"\n\n\"Peterson and Company, in Western City.\"\n\n\"Oho! And you used to sell her candy.\"\n\n\"Stuffed dates.\"\n\n\"And your little heart used to go pit-a-pat, so that you could hardly\ncount the change?\"\n\n\"Gave her too much, several times!\"\n\n\"And you wondered if she was as good as she was beautiful! One day you\nwere thrilled with hope, the next you were cynical and bitter--till at\nlast you gave up in despair, and ran away to work in a coal-mine!\"\n\nThey laughed, and MacKellar and Edstrom joined in. But suddenly Keating\nbecame serious again. \"I ought to be away on that story!\" he exclaimed.\n\"I've got to get something out of that crowd about the disaster. Think\nwhat copy it would make!\"\n\n\"But how can you do it?\"\n\n\"I don't know; I only know I ought to be trying. I'll hang round the\ntrain, and maybe I can get one of the porters to talk.\"\n\n\"Interview with the Coal King's porter!\" chuckled Hal. \"How it feels to\nmake up a multi-millionaire's bed!\"\n\n\"How it feels to sell stuffed dates to a banker's daughter!\" countered\nthe other.\n\nBut suddenly it was Hal's turn to become serious. \"Listen, Mr. Keating,\"\nsaid he, \"why not let _me_ interview young Harrigan?\"\n\n\"_You?_\"\n\n\"Yes! I'm the proper person--one of his miners! I help to make his money\nfor him, don't I? I'm the one to tell him about North Valley.\"\n\nHal saw the reporter staring at him in sudden excitement; he continued:\n\"I've been to the District Attorney, the Justice of the Peace, the\nDistrict Judge, the Mayor and the Chief of Police. Now, why shouldn't I\ngo to the Owner?\"\n\n\"By thunder!\" cried Billy. \"I believe you'd have the nerve!\"\n\n\"I believe I would,\" replied Hal, quietly.\n\nThe other scrambled out of his chair, wild with delight. \"I dare you!\"\nhe exclaimed.\n\n\"I'm ready,\" said Hal.\n\n\"You mean it?\"\n\n\"Of course I mean it.\"\n\n\"In that costume?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I'm one of his miners.\"\n\n\"But it won't go,\" cried the reporter. \"You'll stand no chance to get\nnear him unless you're well dressed.\"\n\n\"Are you sure of that? What I've got on might be the garb of a\nrailroad-hand. Suppose there was something out of order in one of the\ncars--the plumbing, for example?\"\n\n\"But you couldn't fool the conductor or the porter.\"\n\n\"I might be able to. Let's try it.\"\n\nThere was a pause, while Keating thought. \"The truth is,\" he said, \"it\ndoesn't matter whether you succeed or not--it's a story if you even make\nthe attempt. The Coal King's son appealed to by one of his serfs! The\nhard heart of Plutocracy rejects the cry of Labour!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Hal, \"but I really mean to get to him. Do you suppose he's\ngot back to the train yet?\"\n\n\"They were starting to it when I left.\"\n\n\"And where _is_ the train?\"\n\n\"Two or three hundred yards east of the station, I was told.\"\n\nMacKellar and Edstrom had been listening enthralled to this exciting\nconversation. \"That ought to be just back of my house,\" said the former.\n\n\"It's a short train--four parlour-cars and a baggage-car,\" added\nKeating. \"It ought to be easy to recognise.\"\n\nThe old Scotchman put in an objection. \"The difficulty may be to get out\nof this house. I don't believe they mean to let you get away to-night.\"\n\n\"By Jove, that's so!\" exclaimed Keating. \"We're talking too much--let's\nget busy. Are they watching the back door, do you suppose?\"\n\n\"They've been watching it all day,\" said MacKellar.\n\n\"Listen,\" broke in Hal--\"I've an idea. They haven't tried to interfere\nwith your going out, have they, Mr. Keating?\"\n\n\"No, not yet.\"\n\n\"Nor with you, Mr. MacKellar?\"\n\n\"No, not yet,\" said the Scotchman.\n\n\"Well,\" Hal suggested, \"suppose you lend me your crutches?\"\n\nWhereat Keating gave an exclamation of delight. \"The very thing!\"\n\n\"I'll take your over-coat and hat,\" Hal added. \"I've watched you get\nabout, and I think I can give an imitation. As for Mr. Keating, he's not\neasy to mistake.\"\n\n\"Billy, the fat boy!\" laughed the other. \"Come, let's get on the job!\"\n\n\"I'll go out by the front door at the same time,\" put in Edstrom, his\nold voice trembling with excitement. \"Maybe that'll help to throw them\noff the track.\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 11.\n\nThey had been sitting upstairs in MacKellar's room. Now they rose, and\nwere starting for the stairs, when suddenly there came a ring at the\nfront door bell. They stopped and stared at one another. \"There they\nare!\" whispered Keating.\n\nAnd MacKellar sat down suddenly, and held out his crutches to Hal. \"The\nhat and coat are in the front hall,\" he exclaimed. \"Make a try for it!\"\nHis words were full of vigour, but like Edstrom, his voice was\ntrembling. He was no longer young, and could not take adventure gaily.\n\nHal and Keating ran downstairs, followed by Edstrom. Hal put on the coat\nand hat, and they went to the back door, while at the same time Edstrom\nanswered the bell in front.\n\nThe back door opened into a yard, and this gave, through a side gate,\ninto an alley. Hal's heart was pounding furiously as he began to hobble\nalong with the crutches. He had to go at MacKellar's slow pace--while\nKeating, at his side, started talking. He informed \"Mr. MacKellar,\" in a\ncasual voice, that the _Gazette_ was a newspaper which believed in the\npeople's cause, and was pledged to publish the people's side of all\npublic questions. Discoursing thus, they went out of the gate and into\nthe alley.\n\nA man emerged from the shadows and walked by them. He passed within\nthree feet of Hal, and peered at him, narrowly. Fortunately there was no\nmoon; Hal could not see the man's face, and hoped the man could not see\nhis.\n\nMeantime Keating was proceeding with his discourse. \"You understand, Mr.\nMacKellar,\" he was saying, \"sometimes it's difficult to find out the\ntruth in a situation like this. When the interests are filling their\nnewspapers with falsehoods and exaggerations, it's a temptation for us\nto publish falsehoods and exaggerations on the other side. But we find\nin the long run that it pays best to publish the truth, Mr.\nMacKellar--we can stand by it, and there's no come-back.\"\n\nHal, it must be admitted, was not paying much attention to this edifying\nsermon. He was looking ahead, to where the alley debouched onto the\nstreet. It was the street behind MacKellar's house, and only a block\nfrom the railroad-track.\n\nHe dared not look behind, but he was straining his ears. Suddenly he\nheard a shout, in John Edstrom's voice. \"Run! Run!\"\n\nIn a flash, Hal dropped the two crutches, and started down the alley,\nKeating at his heels. They heard cries behind them, and a voice,\nsounding quite near, commanded, \"Halt!\" They had reached the end of the\nalley, and were in the act of swerving, when a shot rang out and there\nwas a crash of glass in a house beyond them on the far side of the\nstreet.\n\nFarther on was a vacant lot with a path running across it. Following\nthis, they dodged behind some shanties, and came to another street--and\nso to the railroad tracks. There was a long line of freight-cars before\nthem, and they ran between two of these, and climbing over the\ncouplings, saw a great engine standing, its headlight gleaming full in\ntheir eyes. They sprang in front of it, and alongside the train, passing\na tender, then a baggage-car, then a parlour-car.\n\n\"Here we are!\" exclaimed Keating, who was puffing like a bellows.\n\nHal saw that there were only three more cars to the train; also, he saw\na man in a blue uniform standing at the steps. He dashed towards him.\n\"Your car's on fire!\" he cried.\n\n\"What?\" exclaimed the man. \"Where?\"\n\n\"Here!\" cried Hal; and in a flash he had sprung past the other, up the\nsteps and into the car.\n\nThere was a long, narrow corridor, to be recognised as the kitchen\nportion of a dining-car; at the other end of this corridor was a\nswinging door, and to this Hal leaped. He heard the conductor shouting\nto him to stop, but he paid no heed. He slipped off his over-coat and\nhat; and then, pushing open the door, he entered a brightly lighted\napartment--and the presence of the Coal King's son.\n\n\n\nSECTION 12.\n\nWhite linen and cut glass of the dining-saloon shone brilliantly under\nelectric lights, softened to the eye by pink shades. Seated at the\ntables were half a dozen young men and as many young ladies, all in\nevening costume; also two or three older ladies. They had begun the\nfirst course of their meal, and were laughing and chatting, when\nsuddenly came this unexpected visitor, clad in coal-stained miner's\njumpers. He was not disturbing in the manner of his entry; but\nimmediately behind him came a fat man, perspiring, wild of aspect, and\nwheezing like an old fashioned steam-engine; behind him came the\nconductor of the train, in a no less evident state of agitation. So, of\ncourse, conversation ceased. The young ladies turned in their chairs,\nwhile several of the young men sprang to their feet.\n\nThere followed a silence: until finally one of the young men took a step\nforward. \"What's this?\" he demanded, as one who had a right to demand.\n\nHal advanced towards the speaker, a slender youth, correct in\nappearance, but not distinguished looking. \"Hello, Percy!\" said Hal.\n\nA look of amazement came upon the other's face. He stared, but seemed\nunable to believe what he saw. And then suddenly came a cry from one of\nthe young ladies; the one having hair the colour of molasses taffy when\nyou've pulled it--but all fluffy and wonderful, with stardust in it. Her\ncheeks were pink and cream, and her brown eyes gazed, wide open, full of\nwonder. She wore a dinner gown of soft olive green, with a cream white\nscarf of some filmy material thrown about her bare shoulders.\n\nShe had started to her feet. \"It's Hal!\" she cried.\n\n\"Hal Warner!\" echoed young Harrigan. \"Why, what in the world--?\"\n\nHe was interrupted by a clamour outside. \"Wait a moment,\" said Hal,\nquietly. \"I think some one else is coming in.\"\n\nThe door was pushed violently open. It was pushed so violently that\nBilly Keating and the conductor were thrust to one side; and Jeff Cotton\nappeared in the entrance.\n\nThe camp-marshal was breathless, his face full of the passion of the\nhunt. In his right hand he carried a revolver. He glared about him, and\nsaw the two men he was chasing; also he saw the Coal King's son, and the\nrest of the astonished company. He stood, stricken dumb.\n\nThe door was pushed again, forcing him aside, and two more men crowded\nin, both of them carrying revolvers in their hands. The foremost was\nPete Hanun, and he also stood staring. The \"breaker of teeth\" had two\nteeth of his own missing, and when his prize-fighter's jaw dropped down,\nthe deficiency became conspicuous. It was probably his first entrance\ninto society, and he was like an overgrown boy caught in the jam-closet.\n\nPercy Harrigan's manner became distinctly imperious. \"What does this\nmean?\" he demanded.\n\nIt was Hal who answered. \"I am seeking a criminal, Percy.\"\n\n\"What?\" There were little cries of alarm from the women.\n\n\"Yes, a criminal; the man who sealed up the mine.\"\n\n\"Sealed up the mine?\" echoed the other. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Let me explain. First, I will introduce my friends. Harrigan, this is\nmy friend Keating.\"\n\nBilly suddenly realised that he had a hat on his head. He jerked it off;\nbut for the rest, his social instincts failed him. He could only stare.\nHe had not yet got all his breath.\n\n\"Billy's a reporter,\" said Hal. \"But you needn't worry--he's a\ngentleman, and won't betray a confidence. You understand, Billy.\"\n\n\"Y--yes,\" said Billy, faintly.\n\n\"And this,\" said Hal, \"is Jeff Cotton, camp-marshal at North Valley. I\nsuppose you know, Percy, that the North Valley mines belong to the 'G.\nF. C.' Cotton, this is Mr. Harrigan.\"\n\nThen Cotton remembered his hat; also his revolver, which he tried to get\nout of sight behind his back.\n\n\"And this,\" continued Hal, \"is Mr. Pete Hanun, by profession a breaker\nof teeth. This other gentleman, whose name I don't know, is presumably\nan assistant-breaker.\" So Hal went on, observing the forms of social\nintercourse, his purpose being to give his mind a chance to work. So\nmuch depended upon the tactics he chose in this emergency! Should he\ntake Percy to one side and tell him the story quietly, leaving it to his\nsense of justice and humanity? No, that was not the way one dealt with\nthe Harrigans! They had bullied their way to the front; if anything were\ndone with them, it would be by force! If anything were done with Percy,\nit would be by laying hold of him before these guests, exposing the\nsituation, and using their feelings to coerce him!\n\nThe Coal King's son was asking questions again. What was all this about?\nSo Hal began to describe the condition of the men inside the mine. \"They\nhave no food or water, except what they had in their dinner-pails; and\nit's been three days and a half since the explosion! They are breathing\nbad air; their heads are aching, the veins swelling in their foreheads;\ntheir tongues are cracking, they are lying on the ground, gasping. But\nthey are waiting--kept alive by the faith they have in their friends on\nthe surface, who will try to get to them. They dare not take down the\nbarriers, because the gases would kill them at once. But they know the\nrescuers will come, so they listen for the sounds of axes and picks.\nThat is the situation.\"\n\nHal stopped and waited for some sign of concern from young Harrigan. But\nno such sign was given. Hal went on:\n\n\"Think of it, Percy! There is one old man in that mine, an Irishman who\nhas a wife and eight children waiting to learn about his fate. I know\none woman who has a husband and three sons in the mine. For three days\nand a half the women and children have been standing at the pit-mouth; I\nhave seen them sitting with their heads sunk upon their knees, or\nshaking their fists, screaming curses at the criminal who is to blame.\"\n\nThere was a pause. \"The criminal?\" inquired young Harrigan. \"I don't\nunderstand!\"\n\n\"You'll hardly be able to believe it; but nothing has been done to\nrescue these men. The criminal has nailed a cover of boards over the\npit-mouth, and put tarpaulin over it--sealing up men and boys to die!\"\n\nThere was a murmur of horror from the diners.\n\n\"I know, you can't conceive such a thing. The reason is, there's a fire\nin the mine; if the fan is set to working, the coal will burn. But at\nthe same time, some of the passages could be got clear of smoke, and\nsome of the men could be rescued. So it's a question of property against\nlives; and the criminal has decided for the property. He proposes to\nwait a week, two weeks, until the fire has been smothered; _then_ of\ncourse the men and boys will be dead.\"\n\nThere was a silence. It was broken by young Harrigan. \"Who has done\nthis?\"\n\n\"His name is Enos Cartwright.\"\n\n\"But who _is_ he?\"\n\n\"Just now when I said that I was seeking the criminal, I misled you a\nlittle, Percy. I did it because I wanted to collect my thoughts.\" Hal\npaused: when he continued, his voice was sharper, his sentences falling\nlike blows. \"The criminal I've been telling you about is the\nsuperintendent of the mine--a man employed and put in authority by the\nGeneral Fuel Company. The one who is being chased is not the one who\nsealed up the mine, but the one who proposed to have it opened. He is\nbeing treated as a malefactor, because the laws of the state, as well as\nthe laws of humanity, have been suppressed by the General Fuel Company;\nhe was forced to seek refuge in your car, in order to save his life from\nthugs and gunmen in the company's employ!\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 13.\n\nKnowing these people well, Hal could measure the effect of the\nthunderbolt he had hurled among them. They were people to whom good\ntaste was the first of all the virtues; he knew how he was offending\nthem. If he was to win them to the least extent, he must explain his\npresence here--a trespasser upon the property of the Harrigans.\n\n\"Percy,\" he continued, \"you remember how you used to jump on me last\nyear at college, because I listened to 'muck-rakers.' You saw fit to\ntake personal offence at it. You knew that their tales couldn't be true.\nBut I wanted to see for myself, so I went to work in a coal-mine. I saw\nthe explosion; I saw this man, Jeff Cotton, driving women and children\naway from the pit-mouth with blows and curses. I set out to help the men\nin the mine, and the marshal rushed me out of camp. He told me that if I\ndidn't go about my business, something would happen to me on a dark\nnight. And you see--this is a dark night!\"\n\nHal waited, to give young Harrigan a chance to grasp this situation and\nto take command. But apparently young Harrigan was not aware of the\npresence of the camp-marshal and his revolver. Hal tried again:\n\n\"Evidently these men wouldn't have minded killing me; they fired at me\njust now. The marshal still has the revolver and you can smell the\npowder-smoke. So I took the liberty of entering your car, Percy. It was\nto save my life, and you'll have to excuse me.\"\n\nThe Coal King's son had here a sudden opportunity to be magnanimous. He\nmade haste to avail himself of it. \"Of course, Hal,\" he said. \"It was\nquite all right to come here. If our employ\u00c3\u00a9s were behaving in such\nfashion, it was without authority, and they will surely pay for it.\" He\nspoke with quiet certainty; it was the Harrigan manner, and before it\nJeff Cotton and the two mine-guards seemed to wither and shrink.\n\n\"Thank you, Percy,\" said Hal. \"It's what I knew you'd say. I'm sorry to\nhave disturbed your dinner-party--\"\n\n\"Not at all, Hal; it was nothing of a party.\"\n\n\"You see, Percy, it was not only to save myself, but the people in the\nmine! They are dying, and every moment is precious. It will take a day\nat least to get to them, so they'll be at their last gasp. Whatever's to\nbe done must be done at once.\"\n\nAgain Hal waited--until the pause became awkward. The diners had so far\nbeen looking at him; but now they were looking at young Harrigan, and\nyoung Harrigan felt the change.\n\n\"I don't know just what you expect of me, Hal. My father employs\ncompetent men to manage his business, and I certainly don't feel that I\nknow enough to give them any suggestions.\" This again in the Harrigan\nmanner; but it weakened before Hal's firm gaze. \"What can I do?\"\n\n\"You can give the order to open the mine, to reverse the fan and start\nit. That will draw out the smoke and gases, and the rescuers can go\ndown.\"\n\n\"But Hal, I assure you I have no authority to give such an order.\"\n\n\"You must _take_ the authority. Your father's in the East, the officers\nof the company are in their beds at home; you are here!\"\n\n\"But I don't understand such things, Hal! I don't know anything of the\nsituation--except what you tell me. And while I don't doubt your word,\nany man may make a mistake in such a situation.\"\n\n\"Come and see for yourself, Percy! That's all I ask, and it's easy\nenough. Here is your train, your engine with steam up; have us switched\nonto the North Valley branch, and we can be at the mine in half an hour.\nThen--let me take you to the men who know! Men who've been working all\ntheir lives in mines, who've seen accidents like this many times, and\nwho will tell you the truth--that there's a chance of saving many lives,\nand that the chance is being thrown away to save some thousands of\ndollars' worth of coal and timbers and track.\"\n\n\"But even if that's true, Hal, I have no _power_!\"\n\n\"If you come there, you can cut the red-tape in one minute. What those\nbosses are doing is a thing that can only be done in darkness!\"\n\nUnder the pressure of Hal's vehemence, the Harrigan manner was failing;\nthe Coal King's son was becoming a bewildered and quite ordinary youth.\nBut there was a power greater than Hal behind him. He shook his head.\n\"It's the old man's business, Hal. I've no right to butt in!\"\n\nThe other, in his desperate need, turned to the rest of the party. His\ngaze, moving from one face to another, rested upon the magazine-cover\ncountenance, with the brown eyes wide open, full of wonder.\n\n\"Jessie! What do you think about it?\"\n\nThe girl started, and distress leaped into her face. \"How do you mean,\nHal?\"\n\n\"Tell him he ought to save those lives!\"\n\nThe moments seemed ages as Hal waited. It was a test, he realised. The\nbrown eyes dropped. \"I don't understand such things, Hal!\"\n\n\"But, Jessie, I am explaining them! Here are men and boys being\nsuffocated to death, in order to save a little money. Isn't that plain?\"\n\n\"But how can I _know_, Hal?\"\n\n\"I'm giving you my word, Jessie. Surely I wouldn't appeal to you unless\nI knew.\"\n\nStill she hesitated. And there came a swift note of feeling into his\nvoice: \"Jessie, dear!\"\n\nAs if under a spell, the girl's eyes were raised to his; he saw a\nscarlet flame of embarrassment spreading over her throat and cheeks.\n\"Jessie, I know--it seems an intolerable thing to ask! You've never been\nrude to a friend. But I remember once you forgot your good manners, when\nyou saw a rough fellow on the street beating an old drudge-horse. Don't\nyou remember how you rushed at him--like a wild thing! And now--think of\nit, dear, here are old drudge-creatures being tortured to death; but not\nhorses--working-men!\"\n\nStill the girl gazed at him. He could read grief, dismay in her eyes; he\nsaw tears steal from them, and stream down her cheeks. \"Oh, I don't\nknow, I don't _know!_\" she cried; and hid her face in her hands, and\nbegan to sob aloud.\n\n\n\nSECTION 14.\n\nThere was a painful pause. Hal's gaze travelled on, and came to a\ngrey-haired lady in a black dinner-gown, with a rope of pearls about her\nneck. \"Mrs. Curtis! Surely _you_ will advise him!\"\n\nThe grey-haired lady started--was there no limit to his impudence? She\nhad witnessed the torturing of Jessie. But Jessie was his fianc\u00c3\u00a9e; he\nhad no such claim upon Mrs. Curtis. She answered, with iciness in her\ntone: \"I could not undertake to dictate to my host in such a matter.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Curtis! You have founded a charity for the helping of stray cats\nand dogs!\" These words rose to Hal's lips; but he did not say them. His\neyes moved on. Who else might help to bully a Harrigan?\n\nNext to Mrs. Curtis sat Reggie Porter, with a rose in the button-hole of\nhis dinner-jacket. Hal knew the r\u00c3\u00b4le in which Reggie was there--a kind\nof male chaperon, an assistant host, an admirer to the wealthy, a solace\nto the bored. Poor Reggie lived other people's lives, his soul\nperpetually a-quiver with other people's excitements, with gossip,\npreparations for tea-parties, praise of tea-parties past. And always the\nsoul was pushing; calculating, measuring opportunities, making up in\ntact and elegance for distressing lack of money. Hal got one swift\nglimpse of the face; the sharp little black moustaches seemed standing\nup with excitement, and in a flash of horrible intuition Hal read the\nsituation--Reggie was expecting to be questioned, and had got ready an\nanswer that would increase his social capital in the Harrigan family\nbank!\n\nAcross the aisle sat Genevieve Halsey: tall, erect, built on the scale\nof a statue. You thought of the ox-eyed Juno, and imagined stately\nemotions; but when you came to know Genevieve, you discovered that her\nmind was slow, and entirely occupied with herself. Next to her was Bob\nCreston, smooth-shaven, rosy-cheeked, exuding well-being--what is called\na \"good fellow,\" with a wholesome ambition to win cups for his athletic\nclub, and to keep up the score of his rifle-team of the state militia.\nJolly Bob might have spoken, out of his good heart; but he was in love\nwith a cousin of Percy's, Betty Gunnison, who sat across the table from\nhim--and Hal saw her black eyes shining, her little fists clenched\ntightly, her lips pressed white. Hal understood Betty--she was one of\nthe Harrigans, working at the Harrigan family task of making the\nchildren of a pack-pedlar into leaders in the \"younger set!\"\n\nNext sat \"Vivie\" Cass, whose talk was of horses and dogs and such\nungirlish matters; Hal had discussed social questions in her presence,\nand heard her view expressed in one flashing sentence--\"If a man eats\nwith his knife, I consider him my personal enemy!\" Over her shoulder\npeered the face of a man with pale eyes and yellow moustaches--Bert\nAtkins, cynical and world-weary, whom the papers referred to as a\n\"club-man,\" and whom Hal's brother had called a \"tame cat.\" There was\n\"Dicky\" Everson, like Hal, a favourite of the ladies, but nothing more;\n\"Billy\" Harris, son of another \"coal man\"; Daisy, his sister; and\nBlanche Vagleman, whose father was Old Peter's head lawyer, whose\nbrother was the local counsel, and publisher of the Pedro _Star_.\n\nSo Hal's eyes moved from face to face, and his mind from personality to\npersonality. It was like the unrolling of a scroll; a panorama of a\nworld he had half forgotten. He had no time for reflection, but one\nimpression came to him, swift and overwhelming. Once he had lived in\nthis world and taken it as a matter of course. He had known these\npeople, gone about with them; they had seemed friendly, obliging, a good\nsort of people on the whole. And now, what a change! They seemed no\nlonger friendly! Was the change in them? Or was it Hal who had become\ncynical--so that he saw them in this terrifying new light, cold, and\nunconcerned as the stars about men who were dying a few miles away!\n\nHal's eyes came back to the Coal King's son, and he discovered that\nPercy was white with anger. \"I assure you, Hal, there's no use going on\nwith this. I have no intention of letting myself be bulldozed.\"\n\nPercy's gaze shifted with sudden purpose to the camp-marshal. \"Cotton,\nwhat do you say about this? Is Mr. Warner correct in his idea of the\nsituation?\"\n\n\"You know what such a man would say, Percy!\" broke in Hal.\n\n\"I don't,\" was the reply. \"I wish to know. What is it, Cotton?\"\n\n\"He's mistaken, Mr. Harrigan.\" The marshal's voice was sharp and\ndefiant.\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"The company's doing everything to get the mine open, and has been from\nthe beginning.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" And there was triumph in Percy's voice. \"What is the cause of the\ndelay?\"\n\n\"The fan was broken, and we had to send for a new one. It's a job to set\nit up--such things can't be done in an hour.\"\n\nPercy turned to Hal. \"You see! There are two opinions, at least!\"\n\n\"Of course!\" cried Betty Gunnison, her black eyes snapping at Hal. She\nwould have said more, but Hal interrupted, stepping closer to his host.\n\"Percy,\" he said, in a low voice, \"come back here, please. I have a word\nto say to you alone.\"\n\nThere was just a hint of menace in Hal's voice; his gaze went to the far\nend of the car, a space occupied only by two negro waiters. These\nretired in haste as the young men moved towards them; and so, having the\nCoal King's son to himself, Hal went in to finish this fight.\n\n\n\nSECTION 15.\n\nPercy Harrigan was known to Hal, as a college-boy is known to his\nclass-mates. He was not brutal, like his grim old father; he was merely\nself-indulgent, as one who had always had everything; he was weak, as\none who had never had to take a bold resolve. He had been brought up by\nthe women of the family, to be a part of what they called \"society\"; in\nwhich process he had been given high notions of his own importance. The\nlife of the Harrigans was dominated by one painful memory--that of a\npedlar's pack; and Hal knew that Percy's most urgent purpose was to be\nregarded as a real and true and freehanded aristocrat. It was this\nknowledge Hal was using in his attack.\n\nHe began with apologies, attempting to soothe the other's anger. He had\nnot meant to make a scene like this; it was the gunmen who had forced\nit, putting his life in danger. It was the very devil, being chased\nabout at night and shot at! He had lost his nerve, really; he had forgot\nwhat little manners he had been able to keep as a miner's buddy. He had\nmade a spectacle of himself; good Lord yes, he realised how he must\nseem!\n\n--And Hal looked at his dirty miner's jumpers, and then at Percy. He\ncould see that Percy was in hearty agreement thus far--he had indeed\nmade a spectacle of himself, and of Percy too! Hal was sorry about this\nlatter, but here they were, in a pickle, and it was certainly too late\nnow. This story was out--there could be no suppressing it! Hal might sit\ndown on his reporter-friend, Percy might sit down on the waiters and the\nconductor and the camp-marshal and the gunmen--but he could not possibly\nsit down on all his friends! They would talk about nothing else for\nweeks! The story would be all over Western City in a day--this amazing,\nmelodramatic, ten-twenty-thirty story of a miner's buddy in the private\ncar of the Coal King's son!\n\n\"And you must see, Percy,\" Hal went on, \"it's the sort of thing that\nsticks to a man. It's the thing by which everybody will form their idea\nof you as long as you live!\"\n\n\"I'll take my chances with my friends' criticism,\" said the other, with\nsome attempt at the Harrigan manner.\n\n\"You can make it whichever kind of story you choose,\" continued Hal,\nimplacably. \"The world will say, He decided for the dollars; or it will\nsay, He decided for the lives. Surely, Percy, your family doesn't need\nthose particular dollars so badly! Why, you've spent more on this one\ntrain-trip!\"\n\nAnd Hal waited, to give his victim time to calculate.\n\nThe result of the thinking was a question worthy of Old Peter. \"What are\n_you_ getting out of this?\"\n\n\"Percy,\" said Hal, \"you must _know_ I'm getting nothing! If you can't\nunderstand it otherwise, say to yourself that you are dealing with a man\nwho's irresponsible. I've seen so many terrible things--I've been chased\naround so much by camp-marshals--why, Percy, that man Cotton has six\nnotches on his gun! I'm simply crazy!\" And into the brown eyes of this\nminer's buddy came a look wild enough to convince a stronger man than\nPercy Harrigan. \"I've got just one idea left in the world, Percy--to\nsave those miners! You make a mistake unless you realise how desperate I\nam. So far I've done this thing incog! I've been Joe Smith, a miner's\nbuddy. If I'd come out and told my real name--well, maybe I wouldn't\nhave made them open the mine, but at least I'd have made a lot of\ntrouble for the G. F. C.! But I didn't do it; I knew what a scandal it\nwould make, and there was something I owed my father. But if I see\nthere's no other way, if it's a question of letting those people perish,\nI'll throw everything else to the winds. Tell your father that; tell him\nI threatened to turn this man Keating loose and blow the thing wide\nopen--denounce the company, appeal to the Governor, raise a disturbance\nand get arrested on the street, if necessary, in order to force the\nfacts before the public. You see, I've got the facts, Percy! I've been\nthere and seen with my own eyes. Can't you realise that?\"\n\nThe other did not answer, but it was evident that he realised.\n\n\"On the other hand, see how you can fix it, if you choose. You were on a\npleasure trip when you heard of this disaster; you rushed up and took\ncommand, you opened the mine, you saved the lives of your employ\u00c3\u00a9s. That\nis the way the papers will handle it.\"\n\nHal, watching his victim intently, and groping for the path to his mind,\nperceived that he had gone wrong. Crude as the Harrigans were, they had\nlearned that it is not aristocratic to be picturesque.\n\n\"All right then!\" said Hal, quickly. \"If you prefer, you needn't be\nmentioned. The bosses up at the camp have the reporters under their\nthumbs, they'll handle the story any way you want it. The one thing I\ncare about is that you run your car up and see the mine opened. Won't\nyou do it, Percy?\"\n\nHal was gazing into the other's eyes, knowing that life and death for\nthe miners hung upon his nod. \"Well? What is the answer?\"\n\n\"Hal,\" exclaimed Percy, \"my old man will give me hell!\"\n\n\"All right; but on the other hand, _I'll_ give you hell; and which will\nbe worse?\"\n\nAgain there was a silence. \"Come along, Percy! For God's sake!\" And\nHal's tone was desperate, alarming.\n\nAnd suddenly the other gave way. \"All right!\"\n\nHal drew a breath. \"But mind you!\" he added. \"You're not going up there\nto let them fool you! They'll try to bluff you out--they may go as far\nas to refuse to obey you. But you must stand by your guns--for, you see,\nI'm going along, I'm going to see that mine open. I'll never quit till\nthe rescuers have gone down!\"\n\n\"Will they go, Hal?\"\n\n\"Will they go? Good God, man, they're clamouring for the chance to go!\nThey've almost been rioting for it. I'll go with them--and you, too,\nPercy--the whole crowd of us idlers will go! When we come out, we'll\nknow something about the business of coal-mining!\"\n\n\"All right, I'm with you,\" said the Coal King's son.\n\n\n\nSECTION 16.\n\nHal never knew what Percy said to Cartwright that night; he only knew\nthat when they arrived at the mine the superintendent was summoned to a\nconsultation, and half an hour later Percy emerged smiling, with the\nannouncement that Hal Warner had been mistaken all along; the mine\nauthorities had been making all possible haste to get the fan ready,\nwith the intention of opening the mine at the earliest moment. The work\nwas now completed, and in an hour or two the fan was to be started, and\nby morning there would be a chance of rescuers getting in. Percy said\nthis so innocently that for a moment Hal wondered if Percy himself might\nnot believe it. Hal's position as guest of course required that he\nshould graciously pretend to believe it, consenting to appear as a fool\nbefore the rest of the company.\n\nPercy invited Hal and Billy Keating to spend the night in the train; but\nthis Hal declined. He was too dirty, he said; besides, he wanted to be\nup at daylight, to be one of the first to go down the shaft. Percy\nanswered that the superintendent had vetoed this proposition--he did not\nwant any one to go down but experienced men, who could take care of\nthemselves. When there were so many on hand ready and eager to go, there\nwas no need to imperil the lives of amateurs.\n\nAt the risk of seeming ungracious, Hal declared that he would \"hang\naround\" and see them take the cover off the pit-mouth. There were\nmourning parties in some of the cabins, where women were gathered\ntogether who could not sleep, and it would be an act of charity to take\nthem the good news.\n\nHal and Keating set out; they went first to the Rafferties', and saw\nMrs. Rafferty spring up and stare at them, and then scream aloud to the\nHoly Virgin, waking all the little Rafferties to frightened clamour.\nWhen the woman had made sure that they really knew what they were\ntalking about, she rushed out to spread the news, and so pretty soon the\nstreets were alive with hurrying figures, and a crowd gathered once more\nat the pit-mouth.\n\nHal and Keating went on to Jerry Minetti's. Out of a sense of loyalty to\nPercy, Hal did no more than repeat Percy's own announcement, that it had\nbeen Cartwright's intention all along to have the mine opened. It was\nfunny to see the effect of this statement--the face with which Jerry\nlooked at Hal! But they wasted no time in discussion; Jerry slipped into\nhis clothes and hurried with them to the pit-mouth.\n\nSure enough, a gang was already tearing off the boards and canvas. Never\nsince Hal had been in North Valley had he seen men working with such a\nwill! Soon the great fan began to stir, and then to roar, and then to\nsing; and there was a crowd of a hundred people, roaring and singing\nalso.\n\nIt would be some hours before anything more could be done; and suddenly\nHal realised that he was exhausted. He and Billy Keating went back to\nthe Minetti cabin, and spreading themselves a blanket on the floor, lay\ndown with sighs of relief. As for Billy, he was soon snoring; but to Hal\nthere came sudden reaction from all the excitement, and sleep was far\nfrom him.\n\nAn ocean of thoughts came flooding into his mind: the world outside,\n_his_ world, which he had banished deliberately for several months, and\nwhich he had so suddenly been compelled to remember! It had seemed so\nsimple, what he had set out to do that summer: to take another name, to\nbecome a member of another class, to live its life and think its\nthoughts, and then come back to his own world with a new and fascinating\nadventure to tell about! The possibility that his own world, the world\nof Hal Warner, might find him out as Joe Smith, the miner's buddy--that\nwas a possibility which had never come to his mind. He was like a\nburglar, working away at a job in darkness, and suddenly finding the\nroom flooded with light.\n\nHe had gone into the adventure, prepared to find things that would shock\nhim; he had known that somehow, somewhere, he would have to fight the\n\"system.\" But he had never expected to find himself in the thick of the\nclass-war, leading a charge upon the trenches of his own associates. Nor\nwas this the end, he knew; this war would not be settled by the winning\nof a trench! Lying here in the darkness and silence, Hal was realising\nwhat he had got himself in for. To employ another simile, he was a man\nwho begins a flirtation on the street, and wakes up next morning to find\nhimself married.\n\nIt was not that he had regrets for the course he had taken with Percy.\nNo other course had been thinkable. But while Hal had known these North\nValley people for ten weeks, he had known the occupants of Percy's car\nfor as many years. So these latter personalities loomed large in his\nconsciousness, and here in the darkness their thoughts about him,\nwhether actively hostile or passively astonished, laid siege to the\ndefences of his mind.\n\nParticularly he found himself wrestling with Jessie Arthur. Her face\nrose up before him, appealing, yearning. She had one of those perfect\nfaces, which irresistibly compel the soul of a man. Her brown eyes, soft\nand shining, full of tenderness; her lips, quick to tremble with\nemotion; her skin like apple-blossoms, her hair with star-dust in it!\nHal was cynical enough about coal-operators and mine-guards, but it\nnever occurred to him that Jessie's soul might be anything but what\nthese bodily charms implied. He was in love with her; and he was too\nyoung, too inexperienced in love to realise that underneath the\nsweetness of girlhood, so genuine and so lovable, might lie deep,\nunconscious cruelty, inherited and instinctive--the cruelty of caste,\nthe hardness of worldly prejudice. A man has to come to middle age, and\nto suffer much, before he understands that the charms of women, those\nrare and magical perfections of eyes and teeth and hair, that softness\nof skin and delicacy of feature, have cost labour and care of many\ngenerations, and imply inevitably that life has been feral, that customs\nand conventions have been murderous and inhuman.\n\nJessie had failed Hal in his desperate emergency. But now he went over\nthe scene, and told himself that the test had been an unfair one. He had\nknown her since childhood, and loved her, and never before had he seen\nan act or heard a word that was not gracious and kind. But--so he told\nhimself--she gave her sympathy to those she knew; and what chance had\nshe ever had to know working-people? He must give her the chance; he\nmust compel her, even against her will, to broaden her understanding of\nlife! The process might hurt her, it might mar the unlined softness of\nher face, but nevertheless, it would be good for her--it would be a\n\"growing pain\"!\n\nSo, lying there in the darkness and silence, Hal found himself absorbed\nin long conversation with his sweetheart. He escorted her about the\ncamp, explaining things to her, introducing her to this one and that. He\ntook others of his private-car friends and introduced them to his North\nValley friends. There were individuals who had qualities in common, and\nwould surely hit it off! Bob Creston, for example, who was good at a\n\"song and dance\"--he would surely be interested in \"Blinky,\" the\nvaudeville specialist of the camp! Mrs. Curtis, who liked cats, would\nfind a bond of sisterhood with old Mrs. Nagle, who lived next door to\nthe Minettis, and kept five! And even Vivie Cass, who hated men who ate\nwith their knives--she would be driven to murder by the table-manners of\nReminitsky's boarders, but she would take delight in \"Dago Charlie,\" the\ntobacco-chewing mule which had once been Hal's pet! Hal could hardly\nwait for daylight to come, so that he might begin these efforts at\nsocial amalgamation!\n\n\n\nSECTION 17.\n\nTowards dawn Hal fell asleep; he was awakened by Billy Keating, who sat\nup yawning, at the same time grumbling and bewailing. Hal realised that\nBilly also had discovered troubles during the night. Never in all his\ncareer as a journalist had he had such a story; never had any man had\nsuch a story--and it must be killed!\n\nCartwright had got the reporters together late the night before and told\nthem the news--that the company had at last succeeded in getting the\nmine ready to be opened; also that young Mr. Harrigan was there in his\nprivate train, prompted by his concern for the entombed miners. The\nreporters would mention his coming, of course, but were requested not to\n\"play it up,\" nor to mention the names of Mr. Harrigan's guests.\nNeedless to say they were not told that the \"buddy\" who had been thrown\nout of camp for insubordination had turned out to be the son of Edward\nS. Warner, the \"coal magnate.\"\n\nA fine, cold rain was falling, and Hal borrowed an old coat of Jerry's\nand slipped it on. Little Jerry clamoured to go with him, and after some\ncontroversy Hal wrapped him in a shawl and slung him onto his shoulder.\nIt was barely daylight, but already the whole population of the village\nwas on hand at the pit-mouth. The helmet-men had gone down to make\ntests, so the hour of final revelation was at hand. Women stood with wet\nshawls about their hunched shoulders, their faces white and strained,\ntheir suspense too great for any sort of utterance. A ghastly thought it\nwas, that while they were shuddering in the wet, their men below might\nbe expiring for lack of a few drops of water!\n\nThe helmet-men, coming up, reported that lights would burn at the bottom\nof the shaft; so it was safe for men to go down without helmets, and the\nvolunteers of the first rescue party made ready. All night there had\nbeen a clattering of hammers, where the carpenters were working on a new\ncage. Now it was swung from the hoist, and the men took their places in\nit. When at last the hoist began to move, and the group disappeared\nbelow the surface of the ground, you could hear a sigh from a thousand\nthroats, like the moaning of wind in a pine-tree. They were leaving\nwomen and children above, yet not one of these women would have asked\nthem to stay--such was the deep unconscious bond of solidarity which\nmade these toilers of twenty nations one!\n\nIt was a slow process, letting down the cage; on account of the danger\nof gas, and the newness of the cage, it was necessary to proceed a few\nfeet at a time, waiting for a pull upon the signal-cord to tell that the\nmen were all right. After they had reached the bottom, there would be\nmore time, no one could say how long, before they came upon survivors\nwith signs of life in them. There were bodies near the foot of the\nshaft, according to the reports of the helmet-men, but there was no use\ndelaying to bring these up, for they must have been dead for days. Hal\nsaw a crowd of women clamouring about the helmet-men, trying to find out\nif these bodies had been recognised. Also he saw Jeff Cotton and Bud\nAdams at their old duty of driving the women back.\n\nThe cage returned for a second load of men. There was less need of\ncaution now; the hoist worked quickly, and group after group of men with\nsilent, set faces, and pickaxes and crow-bars and shovels in their\nhands, went down into the pit of terror. They would scatter through the\nworkings, testing everywhere ahead of them with safety-lamps, and\nlooking for barriers erected by the imprisoned men for defence against\nthe gases. As they hammered on these barriers, perhaps they would hear\nthe signals of living men on the other side; or they would break through\nin silence, and find men too far gone to make a sound, yet possibly with\nthe spark of life still in them.\n\nOne by one, Hal's friends went down--\"Big Jack\" David, and Wresmak, the\nBohemian, Klowoski, the Pole, and finally Jerry Minetti. Little Jerry\nwaved his hand from his perch on Hal's shoulder; while Rosa, who had\ncome out and joined them, was clinging to Hal's arm, silent, as if her\nsoul were going down in the cage. There went blue-eyed Tim Rafferty to\nlook for his father, and black-eyed \"Andy,\" the Greek boy, whose father\nhad perished in a similar disaster years ago; there went Rovetta, and\nCarmino, the pit-boss, Jerry's cousin. One by one their names ran\nthrough the crowd, as of heroes marching out to battle.\n\n\n\nSECTION 18.\n\nLooking about, Hal saw some of the guests of the Harrigan party. There\nwas Vivie Cass, standing under an umbrella with Bert Atkins; and there\nwas Bob Creston with Dicky Everson. These two had on mackintoshes and\nwater-proof hats, and were talking to Cartwright; tall, immaculate men,\nwho seemed like creatures of another world beside the stunted and\ncoal-smutted miners.\n\nSeeing Hal, they moved over to him. \"Where did you get the kid?\"\ninquired Bob, his rosy, smooth-shaven face breaking into a smile.\n\n\"I picked him up,\" said Hal, giving Little Jerry a toss and sliding him\noff his shoulder.\n\n\"Hello, kid!\" said Bob.\n\nAnd the answer came promptly, \"Hello, yourself!\" Little Jerry knew how\nto talk American; he was a match for any society man! \"My father's went\ndown in that cage,\" said he, looking up at the tall stranger, his bright\nblack eyes sparkling.\n\n\"Is that so!\" replied the other. \"Why don't you go?\"\n\n\"My father'll get 'em out. He ain't afraid o' nothin', my father!\"\n\n\"What's your father's name?\"\n\n\"Big Jerry.\"\n\n\"Oho! And what'll you be when you grow up?\"\n\n\"I'm goin' to be a shot-firer.\"\n\n\"In this mine?\"\n\n\"You bet not!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\nLittle Jerry looked mysterious. \"I ain't tellin' all I know,\" said he.\n\nThe two young fellows laughed. Here was education for them! \"Maybe\nyou'll go back to the old country?\" put in Dicky Everson.\n\n\"No, sir-ee!\" said Little Jerry. \"I'm American.\"\n\n\"Maybe you'll be president some day.\"\n\n\"That's what my father says,\" replied the little chap--\"president of a\nminers' union.\"\n\nAgain they laughed; but Rosa gave a nervous whisper and caught at the\nchild's sleeve. That was not the sort of thing to say to mysterious and\nrich-looking strangers! \"This is Little Jerry's mother, Mrs. Minetti,\"\nput in Hal, by way of reassuring her.\n\n\"Glad to meet you, Mrs. Minetti,\" said the two young men, taking off\ntheir hats with elaborate bows; they stared, for Rosa was a pretty\nobject as she blushed and made her shy response. She was much\nembarrassed, having never before in her life been bowed to by men like\nthese.\n\nAnd here they were greeting Joe Smith as an old friend, and calling him\nby a strange name! She turned her black Italian eyes upon Hal in\ninquiry, and he felt a flush creeping over him. It was almost as\nuncomfortable to be found out by North Valley as to be found out by\nWestern City!\n\nThe men talked about the rescue-work, and what Cartwright had been\ntelling of its progress. The fire was in one of the main passages, and\nwas burning out the timbering, spreading rapidly under the draft from\nthe reversed fan. There could be little hope of rescue in this part of\nthe mine, but the helmet-men would defy the heat and smoke in the burned\nout passages. They knew how likely was the collapse of such portions of\nthe mine; but also they knew that men had been working here before the\nexplosion. \"I must say they're a game lot!\" remarked Dicky.\n\nA group of women and children were gathered about to listen, their\nshyness overcome by their torturing anxiety for news. They made one\nthink of women in war-time, listening to the roar of distant guns and\nwaiting for the bringing in of the wounded. Hal saw Bob and Dicky glance\nnow and then at the ring of faces about them; they were getting\nsomething of this mood, and that was a part of what he had desired for\nthem.\n\n\"Are the others coming out?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Bob. \"I suppose they're having breakfast. It's time\nwe went in.\"\n\n\"Won't you come with us?\" added Dicky.\n\n\"No, thanks,\" replied Hal, \"I've an engagement with the kid here.\" And\nhe gave Little Jerry's hand a squeeze. \"But tell some of the other\nfellows to come. They'll be interested in these things.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said the two, as they moved away.\n\n\n\nSECTION 19.\n\nAfter allowing a sufficient time for the party in the dining-car to\nfinish breakfast, Hal went down to the tracks, and induced the porter to\ntake in his name to Percy Harrigan. He was hoping to persuade Percy to\nsee the village under other than company chaperonage; he heard with\ndismay the announcement that the party had arranged to depart in the\ncourse of a couple of hours.\n\n\"But you haven't seen anything at all!\" Hal protested.\n\n\"They won't let us into the mine,\" replied the other. \"What else is\nthere we can do?\"\n\n\"I wanted you to talk to the people and learn something about conditions\nhere. You ought not to lose this chance, Percy!\"\n\n\"That's all right, Hal, but you might understand this isn't a convenient\ntime. I've got a lot of people with me, and I've no right to ask them to\nwait.\"\n\n\"But can't they learn something also, Percy?\"\n\n\"It's raining,\" was the reply; \"and ladies would hardly care to stand\nround in a crowd and see dead bodies brought out of a mine.\"\n\nHal got the rebuke. Yes, he had grown callous since coming to North\nValley; he had lost that delicacy of feeling, that intuitive\nunderstanding of the sentiments of ladies, which he would surely have\nexhibited a short time earlier in his life. He was excited about this\ndisaster; it was a personal thing to him, and he lost sight of the fact\nthat to the ladies of the Harrigan party it was, in its details, merely\nsordid and repelling. If they went out in the mud and rain of a\nmining-village and stood about staring, they would feel that they were\nexhibiting, not human compassion, but idle curiosity. The sights they\nwould see would harrow them to no purpose; and incidentally they would\nbe exposing themselves to distressing publicity. As for offering\nsympathy to widows and orphans--well, these were foreigners mostly, who\ncould not understand what was said to them, and who might be more\nembarrassed than helped by the intrusion into their grief of persons\nfrom an alien world.\n\nThe business of offering sympathy had been reduced to a system by the\ncivilisation which these ladies helped to maintain; and, as it happened,\nthere was one present who was familiar with this system. Mrs. Curtis had\nalready acted, so Percy informed Hal; she had passed about a\nsubscription-paper, and in a couple of minutes over a thousand dollars\nhad been pledged. This would be paid by check to the \"Red Cross,\" whose\nagents would understand how to distribute relief among such sufferers.\nSo the members of Percy's party felt that they had done the proper and\ndelicate thing, and might go their ways with a quiet conscience.\n\n\"The world can't stop moving just because there's been a mine-disaster,\"\nsaid the Coal King's son. \"People have engagements they must keep.\"\n\nAnd he went on to explain what these engagements were. He himself had to\ngo to a dinner that evening, and would barely be able to make it. Bert\nAtkins was to play a challenge match at billiards, and Mrs. Curtis was\nto attend a committee meeting of a woman's club. Also it was the last\nFriday of the month; had Hal forgotten what that meant?\n\nAfter a moment Hal remembered--the \"Young People's Night\" at the country\nclub! He had a sudden vision of the white colonial mansion on the\nmountain-side, with its doors and windows thrown wide, and the strains\nof an orchestra floating out. In the ball-room the young ladies of\nPercy's party would appear--Jessie, his sweetheart, among them--gowned\nin filmy chiffons and laces, floating in a mist of perfume and colour\nand music. They would laugh and chatter, they would flirt and scheme\nagainst one another for the sovereignty of the ball-room--while here in\nNorth Valley the sobbing widows would be clutching their mangled dead in\ntheir arms! How strange, how ghastly it seemed! How like the scenes one\nread of on the eve of the French Revolution!\n\n\n\nSECTION 20.\n\nPercy wanted Hal to come away with the party. He suggested this\ntactfully at first, and then, as Hal did not take the hint, he began to\npress the matter, showing signs of irritation. The mine was open\nnow--what more did Hal want? When Hal suggested that Cartwright might\norder it closed again, Percy revealed the fact that the matter was in\nhis father's hands. The superintendent had sent a long telegram the\nnight before, and an answer was due at any moment. Whatever the answer\nordered would have to be done.\n\nThere was a grim look upon Hal's face, but he forced himself to speak\npolitely. \"If your father orders anything that interferes with the\nrescuing of the men--don't you see, Percy, that I have to fight him?\"\n\n\"But how _can_ you fight him?\"\n\n\"With the one weapon I have--publicity.\"\n\n\"You mean--\" Percy stopped, and stared.\n\n\"I mean what I said before--I'd turn Billy Keating loose and blow this\nwhole story wide open.\"\n\n\"Well, by God!\" cried young Harrigan. \"I must say I'd call it damned\ndirty of you! You said you'd not do it, if I'd come here and open the\nmine!\"\n\n\"But what good does it do to open it, if you close it again before the\nmen are out?\" Hal paused, and when he went on it was in a sincere\nattempt at apology. \"Percy, don't imagine I fail to appreciate the\nembarrassments of this situation. I know I must seem a cad to you--more\nthan you've cared to tell me. I called you my friend in spite of all our\nquarrels. All I can do is to assure you that I never intended to get\ninto such a position as this.\"\n\n\"Well, what the hell did you want to come here for? You knew it was the\nproperty of a friend--\"\n\n\"That's the question at issue between us, Percy. Have you forgotten our\narguments? I tried to convince you what it meant that you and I should\nown the things by which other people have to live. I said we were\nignorant of the conditions under which our properties were worked, we\nwere a bunch of parasites and idlers. But you laughed at me, called me a\ncrank, an anarchist, said I swallowed what any muck-raker fed me. So I\nsaid: 'I'll go to one of Percy's mines! Then, when he tries to argue\nwith me, I'll have him!' That was the way the thing started--as a joke.\nBut then I got drawn into things. I don't want to be nasty, but no man\nwith a drop of red blood in his veins could stay in this place a week\nwithout wanting to fight! That's why I want you to stay--you ought to\nstay, to meet some of the people and see for yourself.\"\n\n\"Well, I can't stay,\" said the other, coldly. \"And all I can tell you is\nthat I wish you'd go somewhere else to do your sociology.\"\n\n\"But where could I go, Percy? Somebody owns everything. If it's a big\nthing, it's almost certain to be somebody we know.\"\n\nSaid Percy, \"If I might make a suggestion, you could have begun with the\ncoal-mines of the Warner Company.\"\n\nHal laughed. \"You may be sure I thought of that, Percy. But see the\nsituation! If I was to accomplish my purpose, it was essential that I\nshouldn't be known. And I had met some of my father's superintendents in\nhis office, and I knew they'd recognise me. So I _had_ to go to some\nother mines.\"\n\n\"Most fortunate for the Warner Company,\" replied Percy, in an ugly tone.\n\nHal answered, gravely, \"Let me tell you, I don't intend to leave the\nWarner Company permanently out of my sociology.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied the other, \"all I can say is that we pass one of their\nproperties on our way back, and nothing would please me better than to\nstop the train and let you off!\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 21.\n\nHal went into the drawing-room car. There were Mrs. Curtis and Reggie\nPorter, playing bridge with Genevieve Halsey and young Everson. Bob\nCreston was chatting with Betty Gunnison, telling her what he had seen\noutside, no doubt. Bert Atkins was looking over the morning paper,\nyawning. Hal went on, seeking Jessie Arthur, and found her in one of the\ncompartments of the car, looking out of the rain-drenched\nwindow--learning about a mining-camp in the manner permitted to young\nladies of her class.\n\nHe expected to find her in a disturbed state of mind, and was prepared\nto apologise. But when he met the look of distress she turned upon him,\nhe did not know just where to begin. He tried to speak casually--he had\nheard she was going away. But she caught him by the hand, exclaiming:\n\"Hal, you are coming with us!\"\n\nHe did not answer for a moment, but sat down by her. \"Have I made you\nsuffer so much, Jessie?\"\n\nHe saw tears start into her eyes. \"Haven't you _known_ you were making\nme suffer? Here I was as Percy's guest; and to have you put such\nquestions to me! What could I say? What do I know about the way Mr.\nHarrigan should run his business?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" he said, humbly. \"Perhaps I shouldn't have drawn you into\nit. But the matter was so complicated and so sudden. Can't you\nunderstand that, and forgive me? Everything has turned out so well!\"\n\nBut she did not think that everything had turned out well. \"In the first\nplace, for you to be here, in such a plight! And when I thought you were\nhunting mountain-goats in Mexico!\"\n\nHe could not help laughing; but Jessie had not even a smile. \"And\nthen--to have you drag our love into the thing, there before every one!\"\n\n\"Was that really so terrible, Jessie?\"\n\nShe looked at him with amazement. That he, Hal Warner, could have done\nsuch a thing, and not realise how terrible it was! To put her in a\nposition where she had to break either the laws of love or the laws of\ngood-breeding! Why, it had amounted to a public quarrel. It would be the\ntalk of the town--there was no end to the embarrassment of it!\n\n\"But, sweetheart!\" argued Hal. \"Try to see the reality of this\nthing--think about those people in the mine. You really _must_ do that!\"\n\nShe looked at him, and noticed the new, grim lines that had come upon\nhis youthful face. Also, she caught the note of suppressed passion in\nhis voice. He was pale and weary looking, in dirty clothes, his hair\nunkempt and his face only half washed. It was terrifying--as if he had\ngone to war.\n\n\"Listen to me, Jessie,\" he insisted. \"I want you to know about these\nthings. If you and I are ever to make each other happy, you must try to\ngrow up with me. That was why I was glad to have you here--you would\nhave a chance to see for yourself. Now I ask you not to go without\nseeing.\"\n\n\"But I have to go, Hal. I can't ask Percy Harrigan to stay and\ninconvenience everybody!\"\n\n\"You can stay without him. You can ask one of the ladies to chaperon\nyou.\"\n\nShe gazed at him in dismay. \"Why, Hal! What a thing to suggest!\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Think how it would look!\"\n\n\"I can't think so much about looks, dear--\"\n\nShe broke in: \"Think what Mamma would say!\"\n\n\"She wouldn't like it, I know--\"\n\n\"She would be wild! She would never forgive either of us. She would\nnever forgive any one who stayed with me. And what would Percy say, if I\ncame here as his guest, and stayed to spy on him and his father? Don't\nyou see how preposterous it would be?\"\n\nYes, he saw. He was defying all the conventions of her world, and it\nseemed to her a course of madness. She clutched his hands in hers, and\nthe tears ran down her cheeks.\n\n\"Hal,\" she cried, \"I can't leave you in this dreadful place! You look\nlike a ghost, and a scarecrow, too! I want you to go and get some decent\nclothes and come home on this train.\"\n\nBut he shook his head. \"It's not possible, Jessie.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because I have a duty to do here. Can't you understand, dear? All my\nlife, I've been living on the labour of coal-miners, and I've never\ntaken the trouble to go near them, to see how my money was got!\"\n\n\"But, Hal! These aren't your people! They are Mr. Harrigan's people!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"but it's all the same. They toil, and we live on their\ntoil, and take it as a matter of course.\"\n\n\"But what can one _do_ about it, Hal?\"\n\n\"One can understand it, if nothing else. And you see what I was able to\ndo in this case--to get the mine open.\"\n\n\"Hal,\" she exclaimed, \"I can't understand you! You've become so cynical,\nyou don't believe in any one! You're quite convinced that these\nofficials meant to murder their working people! As if Mr. Harrigan would\nlet his mines be run that way!\"\n\n\"Mr. Harrigan, Jessie? He passes the collection plate at St. George's!\nThat's the only place you've ever seen him, and that's all you know\nabout him.\"\n\n\"I know what everybody says, Hal! Papa knows him, and my brothers--yes,\nyour own brother, too! Isn't it true that Edward would disapprove what\nyou're doing?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear, I fear so.\"\n\n\"And you set yourself up against them--against everybody you know! Is it\nreasonable to think the older people are all wrong, and only you are\nright? Isn't it at least possible you're making a mistake? Think about\nit--honestly, Hal, for my sake!\"\n\nShe was looking at him pleadingly; and he leaned forward and took her\nhand. \"Jessie,\" he said, his voice trembling, \"I _know_ that these\nworking people are oppressed; I know it, because I have been one of\nthem! And I know that such men as Peter Harrigan, and even my own\nbrother, are to blame! And they've got to be faced by some one--they've\ngot to be made to see! I've come to see it clearly this summer--that's\nthe job I have to do!\"\n\nShe was gazing at him with her wide-open, beautiful eyes; underneath her\nprotests and her terror, she was thrilling with awe at this amazing\nmadman she loved. \"They will _kill_ you!\" she cried.\n\n\"No, dearest--you don't need to worry about that--I don't think they'll\nkill me.\"\n\n\"But they shot at you!\"\n\n\"No, they shot at Joe Smith, a miner's buddy. They won't shoot at the\nson of a millionaire--not in America, Jessie.\"\n\n\"But some dark night--\"\n\n\"Set your mind at rest,\" he said, \"I've got Percy tied up in this, and\neverybody knows it. There's no way they could kill me without the whole\nstory's coming out--and so I'm as safe as I would be in my bed at home!\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 22.\n\nHal was still possessed by his idea that Jessie must be taught--she must\nhave knowledge forced upon her, whether she would or no. The train would\nnot start for a couple of hours, and he tried to think of some use he\ncould make of that precious interval. He recalled that Rosa Minetti had\nreturned to her cabin to attend to her baby. A sudden vision came to him\nof Jessie in that little home. Rosa was sweet and good, and assuredly\nLittle Jerry was a \"winner.\"\n\n\"Sweetheart,\" he said, \"I wish you'd come for a walk with me.\"\n\n\"But it's raining, Hal!\"\n\n\"It won't hurt you to spoil one dress; you have plenty.\"\n\n\"I'm not thinking of that--\"\n\n\"I _wish_ you'd come.\"\n\n\"I don't feel comfortable about it, Hal. I'm here as Percy's guest, and\nhe mightn't like--\"\n\n\"I'll ask him if he objects to your taking a stroll,\" he suggested, with\npretended gravity.\n\n\"No, no! That would make it worse!\" Jessie had no humour whatever about\nthese matters.\n\n\"Well, Vivie Cass was out, and some of the others are going. He hasn't\nobjected to that.\"\n\n\"I know, Hal. But he knows they're all right.\"\n\nHal laughed. \"Come on, Jessie. Percy won't hold you for my sins! You\nhave a long train journey before you, and some fresh air will be good\nfor you.\"\n\nShe saw that she must make some concession to him, if she was to keep\nany of her influence over him.\n\n\"All right,\" she said, with resignation, and disappeared and returned\nwith a heavy veil over her face, to conceal her from prying reportorial\neyes; also an equipment of mackintosh, umbrella and overshoes, against\nthe rain. The two stole out of the car, feeling like a couple of\ncriminals.\n\nSkirting the edge of the throng about the pit-mouth, they came to the\nmuddy, unpaved quarter in which the Italians had their homes; he held\nher arm, steering her through the miniature sloughs and creeks. It was\nthrilling to him to have her with him thus, to see her sweet face and\nhear her voice full of love. Many a time he had thought of her here, and\ntold her in his imagination of his experiences!\n\nHe told her now--about the Minetti family, and how he had met Big and\nLittle Jerry on the street, and how they had taken him in, and then been\ndriven by fear to let him go again. He told his check-weighman story,\nand was telling how Jeff Cotton had arrested him; but they came to the\nMinetti cabin, and the terrifying narrative was cut short.\n\nIt was Little Jerry who came to the door, with the remains of breakfast\ndistributed upon his cheeks; he stared in wonder at the mysteriously\nveiled figure. Entering, they saw Rosa sitting in a chair nursing her\nbaby. She rose in confusion; but she did not quite like to turn her back\nupon her guests, so she stood trying to hide her breast as best she\ncould, blushing and looking very girlish and pretty.\n\nHal introduced Jessie, as an old friend who was interested to meet his\nnew friends, and Jessie threw back her veil and sat down. Little Jerry\nwiped off his face at his mother's command, and then came where he could\nstare at this incredibly lovely vision.\n\n\"I've been telling Miss Arthur what good care you took of me,\" said Hal\nto Rosa. \"She wanted to come and thank you for it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" added Jessie, graciously. \"Anybody who is good to Hal earns my\ngratitude.\"\n\nRosa started to murmur something; but Little Jerry broke in, with his\ncheerful voice, \"Why you call him Hal? His name's Joe!\"\n\n\"Ssh!\" cried Rosa. But Hal and Jessie laughed--and so the process of\nAmericanising Little Jerry was continued.\n\n\"I've got lots of names,\" said Hal. \"They called me Hal when I was a kid\nlike you.\"\n\n\"Did _she_ know you then?\" inquired Little Jerry.\n\n\"Yes, indeed.\"\n\n\"Is she your girl?\"\n\nRosa laughed shyly, and Jessie blushed, and looked charming. She\nrealised vaguely a difference in manners. These people accepted the\nexistence of \"girls,\" not concealing their interest in the phenomenon.\n\n\"It's a secret,\" warned Hal. \"Don't you tell on us!\"\n\n\"I can keep a secret,\" said Little Jerry. After a moment's pause he\nadded, dropping his voice, \"You gotta keep secrets if you work in North\nValley.\"\n\n\"You bet your life,\" said Hal.\n\n\"My father's a Socialist,\" continued the other, addressing Jessie; then,\nsince one thing leads on to another, \"My father's a shot-firer.\"\n\n\"What's a shot-firer?\" asked Jessie, by way of being sociable.\n\n\"Jesus!\" exclaimed Little Jerry. \"Don't you know nothin' about minin'?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Jessie. \"You tell me.\"\n\n\"You couldn't get no coal without a shot-firer,\" declared Little Jerry.\n\"You gotta get a good one, too, or maybe you bust up the mine. My\nfather's the best they got.\"\n\n\"What does he do?\"\n\n\"Well, they got a drill--long, long, like this, all the way across the\nroom; and they turn it and bore holes in the coal. Sometimes they got\nmachines to drill, only we don't like them machines, 'cause it takes the\nmen's jobs. When they got the holes, then the shot-firer comes and sets\noff the powder. You gotta have--\" and here Little Jerry slowed up,\npronouncing each syllable very carefully--\"per-miss-i-ble powder--what\ndon't make no flame. And you gotta know just how much to put in. If you\nput in too much, you smash the coal, and the miner raises hell; if you\ndon't put in enough, you make too much work for him, an' he raises hell\nagain. So you gotta get a good shot-firer.\"\n\nJessie looked at Hal, and he saw that her dismay was mingled with\ngenuine amusement. He judged this a good way for her to get her\neducation, so he proceeded to draw out Little Jerry on other aspects of\ncoal-mining: on short weights and long hours, grafting bosses and\ncamp-marshals, company-stores and boarding-houses, Socialist agitators\nand union organisers. Little Jerry talked freely of the secrets of the\ncamp. \"It's all right for you to know,\" he remarked gravely. \"You're\nJoe's girl!\"\n\n\"You little cherub!\" exclaimed Jessie.\n\n\"What's a cherub?\" was Little Jerry's reply.\n\n\n\nSECTION 23.\n\nSo the time passed in a way that was pleasant. Jessie was completely won\nby this little Dago mine-urchin, in spite of all his frightful\ncurse-words; and Hal saw that she was won, and was delighted by the\nsuccess of this experiment in social amalgamation. He could not read\nJessie's mind, and realise that underneath her genuine delight were\nreservations born of her prejudices, the instinctive cruelty of caste.\nYes, this little mine chap was a cherub, now; but how about when he grew\nbig? He would grow ugly and coarse-looking, in ten years one would not\nknow him from any other of the rough and dirty men of the village.\nJessie took the fact that common people grow ugly as they mature as a\nproof that they are, in some deep and permanent way, the inferiors of\nthose above them. Hal was throwing away his time and strength, trying to\nmake them into something which Nature had obviously not intended them to\nbe! She decided to make that point to Hal on their way back to the\ntrain. She realised that he had brought her here to educate her; like\nall the rest of the world, she resented forcible education, and she was\nnot without hope that she might turn the tables and educate Hal.\n\nPretty soon Rosa finished nursing the baby, and Jessie remarked the\nlittle one's black eyes. This topic broke down the mother's shyness, and\nthey were chatting pleasantly, when suddenly they heard sounds outside\nwhich caused them to start up. It was a clamour of women's voices; and\nHal and Rosa sprang to the door. Just now was a critical time, when\nevery one was on edge for news.\n\nHal threw open the door and called to those outside \"What is it?\" There\ncame a response, in a woman's voice, \"They've found Rafferty!\"\n\n\"Alive?\"\n\n\"Nobody knows yet.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"In Room Seventeen. Eleven of them--Rafferty, and young Flanagan, and\nJohannson, the Swede. They're near dead--can't speak, they say. They\nwon't let anybody near them.\"\n\nOther voices broke in; but the one which answered Hal had a different\nquality; it was a warm, rich voice, unmistakably Irish, and it held\nJessie's attention. \"They've got them in the tipple-room, and the women\nwant to know about their men, and they won't tell them. They're beatin'\nthem back like dogs!\"\n\nThere was a tumult of weeping, and Hal stepped out of the cabin, and in\na minute or so he entered again, supporting on his arm a girl, clad in a\nfaded blue calico dress, and having a head of very conspicuous red hair.\nShe seemed half fainting, and kept moaning that it was horrible,\nhorrible. Hal led her to a chair, and she sank into it and hid her face\nin her hands, sobbing, talking incoherently between her sobs.\n\nJessie stood looking at this girl. She felt the intensity of her\nexcitement, and shared it; yet at the same time there was something in\nJessie that resented it. She did not wish to be upset about things like\nthis, which she could not help. Of course these unfortunate people were\nsuffering; but--what a shocking lot of noise the poor thing was making!\nA part of the poor thing's excitement was rage, and Jessie realised\nthat, and resented it still more. It was as if it were a personal\nchallenge to her; the same as Hal's fierce social passions, which so\nbewildered and shocked her.\n\n\"They're beatin' the women back like dogs!\" the girl repeated.\n\n\"Mary,\" said Hal, trying to soothe her, \"the doctors will be doing their\nbest. The women couldn't expect to crowd about them!\"\n\n\"Maybe they couldn't; but that's not it, Joe, and ye know it! They been\nbringin' up dead bodies, some they found where the explosion was--blown\nall to pieces. And they won't let anybody see them. Is that because of\nthe doctors? No, it ain't! It's because they want to tell lies about the\nnumber killed! They want to count four or five legs to a man! And that's\nwhat's drivin' the women crazy! I saw Mrs. Zamboni, tryin' to get into\nthe shed, and Pete Hanun caught her by the breasts and shoved her back.\n'I want my man!' she screamed. 'Well, what do you want him for? He's all\nin pieces!' 'I want the pieces!' 'What good'll they do you? Are you\ngoin' to eat him?'\"\n\nThere were cries of horror now, even from Jessie; and the strange girl\nhid her face in her hands and began to sob again. Hal put his hand\ngently on her arm.\n\n\"Mary,\" he pleaded, \"it's not so bad--at least they're getting the\npeople out.\"\n\n\"How do ye know what they're doin'? They might be sealin' up parts of\nthe mine down below! That's what makes it so horrible--nobody knows\nwhat's happenin'! Ye should have heard poor Mrs. Rafferty screamin'.\nJoe, it went through me like a knife. Just think, it's been half an hour\nsince they brought him up, and the poor lady can't be told if her man is\nalive.\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 24.\n\nHal stood for a few moments in thought. He was surprised that such\nthings should be happening while Percy Harrigan's train was in the\nvillage. He was considering whether he should go to Percy, or whether a\nhint to Cotton or Cartwright would not be sufficient.\n\n\"Mary,\" he said, in a quiet voice, \"you needn't distress yourself so. We\ncan get better treatment for the women, I'm sure.\"\n\nBut her sobbing went on. \"What can ye do? They're bound to have their\nway!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Hal. \"There's a difference now. Believe me--something can be\ndone. I'll step over and have a word with Jeff Cotton.\"\n\nHe started towards the door; but there came a cry: \"Hal!\" It was Jessie,\nwhom he had almost forgotten in his sudden anger at the bosses.\n\nAt her protest he turned and looked at her; then he looked at Mary. He\nsaw the latter's hands fall from her tear-stained face, and her\nexpression of grief give way to one of wonder. \"Hal!\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" he said, quickly. \"Miss Burke, this is my friend, Miss\nArthur.\" Then, not quite sure if this was a satisfactory introduction,\nhe added, \"Jessie, this is my friend, Mary.\"\n\nJessie's training could not fail in any emergency. \"Miss Burke,\" she\nsaid, and smiled with perfect politeness. But Mary said nothing, and the\nstrained look did not leave her face.\n\nIn the first excitement she had almost failed to notice this stranger;\nbut now she stared, and realisation grew upon her. Here was a girl,\nbeautiful with a kind of beauty hardly to be conceived of in a\nmining-camp; reserved, yet obviously expensive--even in a mackintosh and\nrubber-shoes. Mary was used to the expensiveness of Mrs. O'Callahan, but\nhere was a new kind of expensiveness, subtle and compelling, strangely\nunconscious. And she laid claim to Joe Smith, the miner's buddy! She\ncalled him by a name hitherto unknown to his North Valley associates! It\nneeded no word from Little Jerry to guide Mary's instinct; she knew in a\nflash that here was the \"other girl.\"\n\nMary was seized with sudden acute consciousness of the blue calico\ndress, patched at the shoulder and stained with grease-spots; of her\nhands, big and rough with hard labour; of her feet, clad in shoes worn\nsideways at the heel, and threatening to break out at the toes. And as\nfor Jessie, she too had the woman's instinct; she too saw a girl who was\nbeautiful, with a kind of beauty of which she did not approve, but which\nshe could not deny--the beauty of robust health, of abounding animal\nenergy. Jessie was not unaware of the nature of her own charms, having\nbeen carefully educated to conserve them; nor did she fail to make note\nof the other girl's handicaps--the patched and greasy dress, the big\nrough hands, the shoes worn sideways. But even so, she realised that\n\"Red Mary\" had a quality which she lacked--that beside this wild rose of\na mining-camp, she, Jessie Arthur, might possibly seem a garden flower,\nfragile and insipid.\n\nShe had seen Hal lay his hand upon Mary's arm, and heard her speak to\nhim. She called him Joe! And a sudden fear had leaped into Jessie's\nheart.\n\nLike many girls who have been delicately reared, Jessie Arthur knew more\nthan she admitted, even to herself. She knew enough to realise that\nyoung men with ample means and leisure are not always saints and\nascetics. Also, she had heard the remark many times made that these\nwomen of the lower orders had \"no morals.\" Just what did such a remark\nmean? What would be the attitude of such a girl as Mary\nBurke--full-blooded and intense, dissatisfied with her lot in life--to a\nman of culture and charm like Hal? She would covet him, of course; no\nwoman who knew him could fail to covet him. And she would try to steal\nhim away from his friends, from the world to which he belonged, the\nfuture of happiness and ease to which he was entitled. She would have\npowers--dark and terrible powers, all the more appalling to Jessie\nbecause they were mysterious. Might they possibly be able to overcome\neven the handicap of a dirty calico dress, of big rough hands and shoes\nworn sideways?\n\nThese reflections, which have taken many words to explain, came to\nJessie in one flash of intuition. She understood now, all at once, the\nincomprehensible phenomenon--that Hal should leave friends and home and\ncareer, to come and live amid this squalor and suffering! She saw the\nold drama of the soul of man, heaven and hell contending for mastery of\nit; and she knew that she was heaven, and that this \"Red Mary\" was hell.\n\nShe looked at Hal. He seemed to her so fine and true; his face was\nfrank, he was the soul of honourableness. No, it was impossible to\nbelieve that he had yielded to such a lure! If that had been the case,\nhe would never have brought her to this cabin, he would never have taken\na chance of her meeting the girl. No; but he might be struggling against\ntemptation, he might be in the toils of it, and only half aware of it.\nHe was a man, and therefore blind; he was a dreamer, and it would be\nlike him to idealise this girl, calling her na\u00c3\u00afve and primitive,\nthinking that she had no wiles! Jessie had come just in time to save\nhim! And she would fight to save him--using wiles more subtle than those\nat the command of any mining-camp hussy!\n\n\n\nSECTION 25.\n\nIt was the surging up in Jessie Arthur of that instinctive self, the\ncreature of hereditary cruelty, of the existence of which Hal had no\nidea. She drew back, and there was a quiet _hauteur_ in her tone as she\nspoke. \"Hal, come here, please.\"\n\nHe came; and she waited until he was close enough for intimacy, and then\nsaid, \"Have you forgotten you have to take me back to the train?\"\n\n\"Can't you come with me for a few minutes?\" he pleaded. \"It would have\nsuch a good effect if you did.\"\n\n\"I can't go into that crowd,\" she answered; and suddenly her voice\ntrembled, and the tears came into her sweet brown eyes. \"Don't you know,\nHal, that I couldn't stand such terrible sights? This poor girl--she is\nused to them--she is hardened! But I--I--oh, take me away, take me away,\ndear Hal!\" This cry of a woman for protection came with a familiar echo\nto Hal's mind. He did not stop to think--he was moved by it\ninstinctively. Yes, he had exposed the girl he loved to suffering! He\nhad meant it for her own good, but even so, it was cruel!\n\nHe stood close to her, and saw the love-light in her eyes; he saw the\ntears, the trembling of her sensitive chin. She swayed to him, and he\ncaught her in his arms--and there, before these witnesses, she let him\npress her to him, while she sobbed and whispered her distress. She had\nbeen shy of caresses hitherto, watched and admonished by an experienced\nmother; certainly she had never before made what could by the remotest\nstretch of the imagination be considered an advance towards him. But now\nshe made it, and there was a cry of triumph in her soul as she saw that\nhe responded to it. He was still hers--and these low people should know\nit, this \"other girl\" should know it!\n\nYet, in the midst of this very exultation, Jessie Arthur really felt the\ngrief she expressed for the women of North Valley; she really felt\nhorror at the story of Mrs. Zamboni's \"man\": so intricate is the soul of\nwoman, so puzzling that faculty, older than the ages, which enables her\nto be hysterical, and at the same time to be guided in the use of that\nhysteria by deep and infallible calculation.\n\nBut she made Hal realise that it was necessary for him to take her away.\nHe turned to Mary Burke and said, \"Miss Arthur's train is leaving in a\nshort time. I'll have to take her hack, and then I'll go to the\npit-mouth with you and see what I can do.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" Mary answered; and her voice was hard and cold. But Hal did\nnot notice this. He was a man, and not able to keep up with the emotions\nof one woman--to say nothing of two women at the same time.\n\nHe took Jessie out, and all the way hack to the train she fought a\ndesperate fight to get him away from here. She no longer even suggested\nthat he get decent clothing; she was willing for him to come as he was,\nin his coal-stained mining-jumpers, in the private train of the Coal\nKing's son. She besought him in the name of their affection. She\nthreatened him that if he did not come, this might be the last time they\nwould meet. She even broke down in the middle of the street, and let him\nstand there in plain sight of miners' wives and children, and of\npossible newspaper reporters, holding her in his arms and comforting\nher.\n\nHal was much puzzled; but he would not give way. The idea of going off\nin Percy Harrigan's train had come to seem morally repulsive to him; he\nhated Percy Harrigan's train, and Percy Harrigan also, he declared. And\nJessie saw that she was only making him unreasonable--that before long\nhe might be hating her. With her instinctive _savoir faire_, she brought\nup his suggestion that she might find some one to chaperon her, and stay\nwith him at North Valley until he was ready to come away.\n\nHal's heart leaped at that; he had no idea what was in her mind--the\ncertainty that no one of the ladies of the Harrigan party would run the\nrisk of offending her host by staying under such circumstances.\n\n\"You mean it, sweetheart?\" he cried, happily.\n\nShe answered, \"I mean that I love you, Hal.\"\n\n\"All right, dear!\" he said. \"We'll see if we can arrange it.\"\n\nBut as they walked on, she managed, without his realising it, to cause\nhim to reflect upon the effect of her staying. She was willing to do it,\nif it was what he wanted; but it would injure, perhaps irrevocably, his\nstanding with her parents. They would telegraph her to come at once; and\nif she did not obey, they would come by the next train. So on, until at\nlast Hal was moved to withdraw his own suggestion. After all, what was\nthe use of her staying, if her mind was on the people at home, if she\nwould simply keep him in hot water? Before the conversation was over Hal\nhad become clear in his mind that North Valley was no place for Jessie\nArthur, and that he had been a fool to think he could bring the two\ntogether.\n\nShe tried to get him to promise to leave as soon as the last man had\nbeen brought out of the mine. He answered that he intended to leave\nthen, unless some new emergency should arise. She tried to get an\nunqualified promise; and failing in that, when they had nearly got to\nthe train she suddenly made a complete surrender. Let him do what he\npleased--but let him remember that she loved him, that she needed him,\nthat she could not do without him. No matter what he might do, no matter\nwhat people might say about him, she believed in him, she would stand by\nhim. Hal was deeply touched, and took her in his arms again and kissed\nher tenderly under the umbrella, in the presence of the wondering stares\nof several urchins with coal-smutted faces. He pledged anew his love for\nher, assuring her that no amount of interest in mining-camps should ever\nsteal him from her.\n\nThen he put her on the train, and shook hands with the departing guests.\nHe was so very sombre and harassed-looking that the young men forbore to\n\"kid\" him as they would otherwise have done. He stood on the\nstation-platform and saw the train roll away--and felt, to his own\ndesperate bewilderment, that he hated these friends of his boyhood and\nyouth. His reason protested against it; he told himself there was\nnothing they could do, no reason on earth for them to stay--and yet he\nhated them. They were hurrying off to dance and flirt at the country\nclub--while he was going back to the pit-mouth, to try to get Mrs.\nZamboni the right to inspect the pieces of her \"man\"!\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FOUR\n\nTHE WILL OF KING COAL\n\n\n\n\nSECTION 1.\n\nThe pit of death was giving up its secrets. The hoist was busy, and\ncage-load after cage-load came up, with bodies dead and bodies living\nand bodies only to be classified after machines had pumped air into them\nfor a while. Hal stood in the rain and watched the crowd and thought\nthat he had never witnessed a scene so compelling to pity and terror.\nThe silence that would fall when any one appeared who might have news to\ntell! The sudden shriek of anguish from some woman whose hopes were\nstruck dead! The moans of sympathy that ran through the crowd,\nalternating with cheers at some good tidings, shaking the souls of the\nmultitude as a storm of wind shakes a reed-field!\n\nAnd the stories that ran through the camp--brought up from the\nunderground world--stories of incredible sufferings, and of still more\nincredible heroisms! Men who had been four days without food or water,\nyet had resisted being carried out of the mine, proposing to stay and\nhelp rescue others! Men who had lain together in the darkness and\nsilence, keeping themselves alive by the water which seeped from the\nrocks overhead, taking turns lying face upwards where the drops fell, or\nwetting pieces of their clothing and sucking out the moisture! Members\nof the rescue parties would tell how they knocked upon the barriers, and\nheard the faint answering signals of the imprisoned men; how madly they\ntoiled to cut through, and how, when at last a little hole appeared,\nthey heard the cries of joy, and saw the eyes of men shining from the\ndarkness, while they waited, gasping, for the hole to grow bigger, so\nthat water and food might be passed in!\n\nIn some places they were fighting the fire. Long lines of hose had been\nsent down, and men were moving forward foot by foot, as the smoke and\nsteam were sucked out ahead of them by the fan. Those who did this work\nwere taking their lives in their hands, yet they went without\nhesitation. There was always hope of finding men in barricaded rooms\nbeyond.\n\nHal sought out Jeff Cotton at the entrance to the tipple-room, which had\nbeen turned into a temporary hospital. It was the first time the two had\nmet since the revelation in Percy's car, and the camp-marshal's face\ntook on a rather sheepish grin. \"Well, Mr. Warner, you win,\" he\nremarked; and after a little arguing he agreed to permit a couple of\nwomen to go into the tipple-room and make a list of the injured, and go\nout and give the news to the crowd. Hal went to the Minettis to ask Mary\nBurke to attend to this; but Rosa said that Mary had gone out after he\nand Miss Arthur had left, and no one knew where she was. So Hal went to\nMrs. David, who consented to get a couple of friends, and do the work\nwithout being called a \"committee.\" \"I won't have any damned\ncommittees!\" the camp-marshal had declared.\n\nSo the night passed, and part of another day. A clerk from the office\ncame to Hal with a sealed envelope, containing a telegram, addressed in\ncare of Cartwright. \"I most urgently beg of you to come home at once. It\nwill be distressing to Dad if he hears what has happened, and it will\nnot be possible to keep the matter from him for long.\"\n\nAs Hal read, he frowned; evidently the Harrigans had got busy without\ndelay! He went to the office and telephoned his answer. \"Am planning to\nleave in a day or two. Trust you will make an effort to spare Dad until\nyou have heard my story.\"\n\nThis message troubled Hal. It started in his mind long arguments with\nhis brother, and explanations and apologies to his father. He loved the\nold man tenderly. What a shame if some emissary of the Harrigans were to\nget to him to upset him with misrepresentations!\n\nAlso these ideas had a tendency to make Hal homesick; they brought more\nvividly to his thoughts the outside world, with its physical\nallurements--there being a limit to the amount of unwholesome meals and\ndirty beds and repulsive sights a man of refinement can force himself to\nendure. Hal found himself obsessed by a vision of a club dining-room,\nwith odours of grilled steaks and hot rolls, and the colours of salads\nand fresh fruits and cream. The conviction grew suddenly strong in him\nthat his work in North Valley was nearly done!\n\nAnother night passed, and another day. The last of the bodies had been\nbrought out, and the corpses shipped down to Pedro for one of those big\nwholesale funerals which are a feature of mine-life. The fire was out,\nand the rescue-crews had given place to a swarm of carpenters and\ntimbermen, repairing the damage and making the mine safe. The reporters\nhad gone; Billy Keating having clasped Hal's hand, and promised to meet\nhim for luncheon at the club. An agent of the \"Red Cross\" was on hand,\nand was feeding the hungry out of Mrs. Curtis's subscription-list. What\nmore was there for Hal to do--except to bid good-bye to his friends, and\nassure them of his help in the future?\n\nFirst among these friends was Mary Burke, whom he had had no chance to\ntalk to since the meeting with Jessie. He realised that Mary had been\ndeliberately avoiding him. She was not in her home, and he went to\ninquire at the Rafferties', and stopped for a good-bye chat with the old\nwoman whose husband he had saved.\n\nRafferty was going to pull through. His wife had been allowed in to see\nhim, and tears rolled down her shrunken cheeks as she told about it. He\nhad been four days and nights blocked up in a little tunnel, with no\nfood or water, save for a few drops of coffee which he had shared with\nother men. He could still not speak, he could hardly move a hand; but\nthere was life in his eyes, and his look had been a greeting from the\nsoul she had loved and served these thirty years and more. Mrs. Rafferty\nsang praises to the Rafferty God, who had brought him safely through\nthese perils; it seemed obvious that He must be more efficient than the\nProtestant God of Johannson, the giant Swede, who had lain by Rafferty's\nside and given up the ghost.\n\nBut the doctor had stated that the old Irishman would never be good to\nwork again; and Hal saw a shadow of terror cross the sunshine of Mrs.\nRafferty's rejoicing. How could a doctor say a thing like that? Rafferty\nwas old, to be sure; but he was tough--and could any doctor imagine how\nhard a man would try who had a family looking to him? Sure, he was not\nthe one to give up for a bit of pain now and then! Besides him, there\nwas only Tim who was earning; and though Tim was a good lad, and worked\nsteady, any doctor ought to know that a big family could not be kept\ngoing on the wages of one eighteen-year-old pit-boy. As for the other\nlads, there was a law that said they were too young to work. Mrs.\nRafferty thought there should be some one to put a little sense into the\nheads of them that made the laws--for if they wanted to forbid children\nto work in coal-mines, they should surely provide some other way to feed\nthe children.\n\nHal listened, agreeing sympathetically, and meantime watching her, and\nlearning more from her actions than from her words. She had been\nobedient to the teachings of her religion, to be fruitful and multiply;\nshe had fed three grown sons into the maw of industry, and had still\neight children and a man to care for. Hal wondered if she had ever\nrested a single minute of daylight in all her fifty-four years.\nCertainly not while he had been in her house! Even now, while praising\nthe Rafferty God and blaming the capitalist law-makers, she was getting\na supper, moving swiftly, silently, like a machine. She was lean as an\nold horse that has toiled across a desert; the skin over her cheek-bones\nwas tight as stretched rubber, and cords stood out in her wrists like\npiano-wires.\n\nAnd now she was cringing before the spectre of destitution. He asked\nwhat she would do about it, and saw the shadow of terror cross her face\nagain. There was one recourse from starvation, it seemed--to have her\nchildren taken from her, and put in some institution! At the mention of\nthis, one of the special nightmares of the poor, the old woman began to\nsob and cry again that the doctor was wrong; he would see, and Hal would\nsee--Old Rafferty would be back at his job in a week or two!\n\n\n\nSECTION 2.\n\nHal went out on the street again. It was the hour which would have been\nsunset in a level region; the tops of the mountains were touched with a\npurple light, and the air was fresh and chill with early fall. Down the\ndarkening streets he saw a gathering of men; there was shouting, and\npeople running towards the place, so he hurried up, with the thought in\nhis mind, \"What's the matter now?\" There were perhaps a hundred men\ncrying out, their voices mingling like the sound of waves on the sea. He\ncould make out words: \"Go on! Go on! We've had enough of it! Hurrah!\"\n\n\"What's happened?\" he asked, of some one on the outskirts; and the man,\nrecognising him, raised a cry which ran through the throng: \"Joe Smith!\nHe's the boy for us! Come in here, Joe! Give us a speech!\"\n\nBut even while Hal was asking questions, trying to get the situation\nclear, other shouts had drowned out his name. \"We've had enough of them\nwalking over us!\" And somebody cried, more loudly, \"Tell us about it!\nTell it again! Go on!\"\n\nA man was standing upon the steps of a building at one side. Hal stared\nin amazement; it was Tim Rafferty. Of all people in the world--Tim, the\nlight-hearted and simple, Tim of the laughing face and the merry Irish\nblue eyes! Now his sandy hair was tousled and his features distorted\nwith rage. \"Him near dead!\" he yelled. \"Him with his voice gone, and\ncouldn't move his hand! Eleven years he's slaved for them, and near\nkilled in an accident that's their own fault--every man in this crowd\nknows it's their own fault, by God!\"\n\n\"Sure thing! You're right!\" cried a chorus of voices \"Tell it all!\"\n\n\"They give him twenty-five dollars and his hospital expenses--and\nwhat'll his hospital expenses be? They'll have him out on the street\nagain before he's able to stand. You know that--they done it to Pete\nCullen!\"\n\n\"You bet they did!\"\n\n\"Them damned lawyers in there--gettin' 'em to sign papers when they\ndon't know what they're doin'. An' me that might help him can't get\nnear! By Christ, I say it's too much! Are we slaves, or are we dogs,\nthat we have to stand such things?\"\n\n\"We'll stand no more of it!\" shouted one. \"We'll go in there and see to\nit ourselves!\"\n\n\"Come on!\" shouted another. \"To hell with their gunmen!\"\n\nHal pushed his way into the crowd. \"Tim!\" he cried. \"How do you know\nthis?\"\n\n\"There's a fellow in there seen it.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"I can't tell you--they'd fire him; but it's somebody you know as well\nas me. He come and told me. They're beatin' me old father out of\ndamages!\"\n\n\"They do it all the time!\" shouted Wauchope, an English miner at Hal's\nside. \"That's why they won't let us in there.\"\n\n\"They done the same thing to my father!\" put in another voice. Hal\nrecognised Andy, the Greek boy.\n\n\"And they want to start Number Two in the mornin'!\" yelled Tim. \"Who'll\ngo down there again? And with Alec Stone, him that damns the men and\nsaves the mules!\"\n\n\"We'll not go back in them mines till they're safe!\" shouted Wauchope.\n\"Let them sprinkle them--or I'm done with the whole business.\"\n\n\"And let 'em give us our weights!\" cried another. \"We'll have a\ncheck-weighman, and we'll get what we earn!\"\n\nSo again came the cry, \"Joe Smith! Give us a speech, Joe! Soak it to\n'em! You're the boy!\"\n\nHal stood helpless, dismayed. He had counted his fight won--and here was\nanother beginning! The men were looking to him, calling upon him as the\nboldest of the rebels. Only a few of them knew about the sudden change\nin his fortunes.\n\nEven while he hesitated, the line of battle had swept past him; the\nEnglishman, Wauchope, sprang upon the steps and began to address the\nthrong. He was one of the bowed and stunted men, but in this emergency\nhe developed sudden lung-power. Hal listened in astonishment; this\nsilent and dull-looking fellow was the last he would have picked for a\nfighter. Tom Olson had sounded him out, and reported that he would hear\nnothing, so they had dismissed him from mind. And here he was, shouting\nterrible defiance!\n\n\"They're a set of robbers and murderers! They rob us everywhere we turn!\nFor my part, I've had enough of it! Have you?\"\n\nThere was a roar from every one within reach of his voice. They had all\nhad enough.\n\n\"All right, then--we'll fight them!\"\n\n\"Hurrah! Hurrah! We'll have our rights!\"\n\nJeff Cotton came up on the run, with \"Bud\" Adams and two or three of the\ngunmen at his heels. The crowd turned upon them, the men on the\noutskirts clenching their fists, showing their teeth like angry dogs.\nCotton's face was red with rage, but he saw that he had a serious matter\nin hand; he turned and went for more help--and the mob roared with\ndelight. Already they had begun their fight! Already they had won their\nfirst victory!\n\n\n\nSECTION 3.\n\nThe crowd moved down the street, shouting and cursing as it went. Some\none started to sing the Marseillaise, and others took it up, and the\nwords mounted to a frenzy:\n\n  \"To arms! To arms, ye brave!\n  March on, march on, all hearts resolved\n  On victory or death!\"\n\nThere were the oppressed of many nations in this crowd; they sang in a\nscore of languages, but it was the same song. They would sing a few\nbars, and the yells of others would drown them out. \"March on! March on!\nAll hearts resolved!\" Some rushed away in different directions to spread\nthe news, and very soon the whole population of the village was on the\nspot; the men waving their caps, the women lifting up their hands and\nshrieking--or standing terrified, realising that babies could not be fed\nupon revolutionary singing.\n\nTim Rafferty was raised up on the shoulders of the crowd and made to\ntell his story once more. While he was telling it, his old mother came\nrunning, and her shrieks rang above the clamour: \"Tim! Tim! Come down\nfrom there! What's the matter wid ye?\" She was twisting her hands\ntogether in an agony of fright; seeing Hal, she rushed up to him. \"Get\nhim out of there, Joe! Sure, the lad's gone crazy! They'll turn us out\nof the camp, they'll give us nothin' at all--and what'll become of us?\nMother of God, what's the matter with the b'y?\" She called to Tim again;\nbut Tim paid no attention, if he heard her. Tim was on the march to\nVersailles!\n\nSome one shouted that they would go to the hospital to protect the\ninjured men from the \"damned lawyers.\" Here was something definite, and\nthe crowd moved in that direction, Hal following with the stragglers,\nthe women and children, and the less bold among the men. He noticed some\nof the clerks and salaried employ\u00c3\u00a9s of the company; presently he saw\nJeff Cotton again, and heard him ordering these men to the office to get\nrevolvers.\n\n\"Big Jack\" David came along with Jerry Minetti, and Hal drew back to\nconsult with them. Jerry was on fire. It had come--the revolt he had\nbeen looking forward to for years! Why were they not making speeches,\ngetting control of the men and organising them?\n\nJack David voiced uncertainty. They had to consider if this outburst\ncould mean anything permanent.\n\nJerry answered that it would mean what they chose to make it mean. If\nthey took charge, they could guide the men and hold them together.\nWasn't that what Tom Olson had wanted?\n\nNo, said the big Welshman, Olson had been trying to organise the men\nsecretly, as preliminary to a revolt in all the camps. That was quite\nanother thing from an open movement, limited to one camp. Was there any\nhope of success for such a movement? If not, they would be foolish to\nstart, they would only be making sure of their own expulsion.\n\nJerry turned to Hal. What did he think?\n\nAnd so at last Hal had to speak. It was hard for him to judge, he said.\nHe knew so little about labour matters. It was to learn about them that\nhe had come to North Valley. It was a hard thing to advise men to submit\nto such treatment as they had been getting; but on the other hand, any\none could see that a futile outbreak would discourage everybody, and\nmake it harder than ever to organise them.\n\nSo much Hal spoke; but there was more in his mind, which he could not\nspeak. He could not say to these men, \"I am a friend of yours, but I am\nalso a friend of your enemy, and in this crisis I cannot make up my mind\nto which side I owe allegiance. I'm bound by a duty of politeness to the\nmasters of your lives; also, I'm anxious not to distress the girl I am\nto marry!\" No, he could not say such things. He felt himself a traitor\nfor having them in his mind, and he could hardly bring himself to look\nthese men in the eye. Jerry knew that he was in some way connected with\nthe Harrigans; probably he had told the rest of Hal's friends, and they\nhad been discussing it and speculating about the meaning of it. Suppose\nthey should think he was a spy?\n\nSo Hal was relieved when Jack David spoke firmly. They would only be\nplaying the game of the enemy if they let themselves be drawn in\nprematurely. They ought to have the advice of Tom Olson.\n\nWhere was Olson? Hal asked; and David explained that on the day when Hal\nhad been thrown out of camp, Olson had got his \"time\" and set out for\nSheridan, the local headquarters of the union, to report the situation.\nHe would probably not come back; he had got his little group together,\nhe had planted the seed of revolt in North Valley.\n\nThey discussed back and forth the problem of getting advice. It was\nimpossible to telephone from North Valley without everything they said\nbeing listened to; but the evening train for Pedro left in a few\nminutes, and \"Big Jack\" declared that some one ought to take it. The\ntown of Sheridan was only fifteen or twenty miles from Pedro, and there\nwould be a union official there to advise them; or they might use the\nlong distance telephone, and persuade one of the union leaders in\nWestern City to take the midnight train, and be in Pedro next morning.\n\nHal, still hoping to withdraw himself, put this task off on Jack David.\nThey emptied out the contents of their pockets, so that he might have\nfunds enough, and the big Welshman darted off to catch the train. In the\nmeantime Jerry and Hal agreed to keep in the background, and to seek out\nthe other members of their group and warn them to do the same.\n\n\n\nSECTION 4.\n\nThis programme was a convenient one for Hal; but as he was to find\nalmost at once, it had been adopted too late. He and Jerry started after\nthe crowd, which had stopped in front of one of the company buildings;\nand as they came nearer they heard some one making a speech. It was the\nvoice of a woman, the tones rising clear and compelling. They could not\nsee the speaker, because of the throng, but Hal recognised her voice,\nand caught his companion by the arm. \"It's Mary Burke!\"\n\nMary Burke it was, for a fact; and she seemed to have the crowd in a\nkind of frenzy. She would speak one sentence, and there would come a\nroar from the throng; she would speak another sentence, and there would\ncome another roar. Hal and Jerry pushed their way in, to where they\ncould make out the words of this litany of rage.\n\n\"Would they go down into the pit themselves, do ye think?\"\n\n\"They would not!\"\n\n\"Would they be dressed in silks and laces, do ye think?\"\n\n\"They would not!\"\n\n\"Would they have such fine soft hands, do ye think?\"\n\n\"They would not!\"\n\n\"Would they hold themselves too good to look at ye?\"\n\n\"They would not! They would not!\"\n\nAnd Mary swept on: \"If only ye'd stand together, they'd come to ye on\ntheir knees to ask for terms! But ye're cowards, and they play on your\nfears! Ye're traitors, and they buy ye out! They break ye into pieces,\nthey do what they please with ye--and then ride off in their private\ncars, and leave gunmen to beat ye down and trample on your faces! How\nlong will ye stand it? How long?\"\n\nThe roar of the mob rolled down the street and back again. \"We'll not\nstand it! We'll not stand it!\" Men shook their clenched fists, women\nshrieked, even children shouted curses. \"We'll fight them! We'll slave\nno more for them!\"\n\nAnd Mary found a magic word. \"We'll have a union!\" she shouted. \"We'll\nget together and stay together! If they refuse us our rights, we'll know\nwhat to answer--we'll have a _strike!_\"\n\nThere was a roar like the crashing of thunder in the mountains. Yes,\nMary had found the word! For many years it had not been spoken aloud in\nNorth Valley, but now it ran like a flash of gunpowder through the\nthrong. \"Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!\" It seemed as if they would\nnever have enough of it. Not all of them had understood Mary's speech,\nbut they knew this word, \"Strike!\" They translated and proclaimed it in\nPolish and Bohemian and Italian and Greek. Men waved their caps, women\nwaved their aprons--in the semi-darkness it was like some strange kind\nof vegetation tossed by a storm. Men clasped one another's hands, the\nmore demonstrative of the foreigners fell upon one another's necks.\n\"Strike! Strike! Strike!\"\n\n\"We're no longer slaves!\" cried the speaker. \"We're men--and we'll live\nas men! We'll work as men--or we'll not work at all! We'll no longer be\na herd of cattle, that they can drive about as they please! We'll\norganise, we'll stand together--shoulder to shoulder! Either we'll win\ntogether, or we'll starve and die together! And not a man of us will\nyield, not a man of us will turn traitor! Is there anybody here who'll\nscab on his fellows?\"\n\nThere was a howl, which might have come from a pack of wolves. Let the\nman who would scab on his fellows show his dirty face in that crowd!\n\n\"Ye'll stand by the union?\"\n\n\"We'll stand by it!\"\n\n\"Ye'll swear?\"\n\n\"We'll swear!\"\n\nShe flung her arms to heaven with a gesture of passionate adjuration.\n\"Swear it on your lives! To stick to the rest of us, and never a man of\nye give way till ye've won! Swear! _Swear!_\"\n\nMen stood, imitating her gesture, their hands stretched up to the sky.\n\"We swear! We swear!\"\n\n\"Ye'll not let them break ye! Ye'll not let them frighten ye!\"\n\n\"No! No!\"\n\n\"Stand by your word, men! Stand by it! 'Tis the one chance for your\nwives and childer!\" The girl rushed on--exhorting with leaping words and\npassionate out-flung arms--a tall, swaying figure of furious rebellion.\nHal listened to the speech and watched the speaker, marvelling. Here was\na miracle of the human soul, here was hope born of despair! And the\ncrowd around her--they were sharing the wonderful rebirth; their waving\narms, their swaying forms responded to Mary as an orchestra to the baton\nof a leader.\n\nA thrill shook Hal--a thrill of triumph! He had been beaten down\nhimself, he had wanted to run from this place of torment; but now there\nwas hope in North Valley--now there would be victory, freedom!\n\nEver since he had come to the coal-country, the knowledge had been\ngrowing in Hal that the real tragedy of these people's lives was not\ntheir physical suffering, but their mental depression--the dull,\nhopeless misery in their minds. This had been driven into his\nconsciousness day by day, both by what he saw and by what others told\nhim. Tom Olson had first put it into words: \"Your worst troubles are\ninside the heads of the fellows you're trying to help!\" How could hope\nbe given to men in this environment of terrorism? Even Hal himself,\nyoung and free as he was, had been brought to despair. He came from a\nclass which is accustomed to say, \"Do this,\" or \"Do that,\" and it will\nbe done. But these mine-slaves had never known that sense of power, of\ncertainty; on the contrary, they were accustomed to having their efforts\nbalked at every turn, their every impulse to happiness or achievement\ncrushed by another's will.\n\nBut here was this miracle of the human soul! Here was hope in North\nValley! Here were the people rising--and Mary Burke at their head! It\nwas his vision come true--Mary Burke with a glory in her face, and her\nhair shining like a crown of gold! Mary Burke mounted upon a snow-white\nhorse, wearing a robe of white, soft and lustrous--like Joan of Arc, or\na leader in a suffrage parade! Yes, and she was at the head of a host,\nhe had the music of its marching in his ears!\n\nUnderneath Hal's jesting words had been a real vision, a real faith in\nthis girl. Since that day when he had first discovered her, a wild rose\nof the mining-camp taking in the family wash, he had realised that she\nwas no pretty young working-girl, but a woman with a mind and a\npersonality. She saw farther, she felt more deeply than the average of\nthese wage-slaves. Her problem was the same as theirs, yet more complex.\nWhen he had wanted to help her and had offered to get her a job, she had\nmade clear that what she craved was not merely relief from drudgery, but\na life with intellectual interest. So then the idea had come to him that\nMary should become a teacher, a leader of her people. She loved them,\nshe suffered for them and with them, and at the same time she had a mind\nthat was capable of seeking out the causes of their misery. But when he\nhad gone to her with plans of leadership, he had been met by her\ncorroding despair; her pessimism had seemed to mock his dreams, her\ncontempt for these mine-slaves had belittled his efforts in their behalf\nand in hers.\n\nAnd now, here she was taking up the role he had planned for her! Her\nvery soul was in this shouting throng, he thought. She had lived the\nlives of these people, shared their every wrong, been driven to\nrebellion with them. Being a mere man, Hal missed one important point\nabout this startling development; he did not realise that Mary's\neloquence was addressed, not merely to the Rafferties and the Wauchopes,\nand the rest of the North Valley mine-slaves, but to a certain\nmagazine-cover girl, clad in a mackintosh and a pale green hat and a\nsoft and filmy and horribly expensive motoring veil!\n\n\n\nSECTION 5.\n\nMary's speech was brought to a sudden end. A group of the men had moved\ndown the street, and there arose a disturbance there. The noise of it\nswelled louder, and more people began to move in that direction. Mary\nturned to look, and all at once the whole throng surged down the street.\n\nThe trouble was at the hospital. In front of this building was a porch,\nand on it Cartwright and Alec Stone were standing, with a group of the\nclerks and office-employ\u00c3\u00a9s, among whom Hal saw Predovich, Johnson, the\npostmaster, and Si Adams. At the foot of the steps stood Tim Rafferty,\nwith a swarm of determined men at his back. He was shouting, \"We want\nthem lawyers out of there!\"\n\nThe superintendent himself had undertaken to parley with him. \"There are\nno lawyers in here, Rafferty.\"\n\n\"We don't trust you!\" And the crowd took up the cry: \"We'll see for\nourselves!\"\n\n\"You can't go into this building,\" declared Cartwright.\n\n\"I'm goin' to see my father!\" shouted Tim. \"I've got a right to see my\nfather, ain't I?\"\n\n\"You can see him in the morning. You can take him away, if you want to.\nWe've no desire to keep him. But he's asleep now, and you can't disturb\nthe others.\"\n\n\"You weren't afraid to disturb them with your damned lawyers!\" And there\nwas a roar of approval--so loud that Cartwright's denial could hardly be\nheard.\n\n\"There have been no lawyers near him, I tell you.\"\n\n\"It's a lie!\" shouted Wauchope. \"They been in there all day, and you\nknow it. We mean to have them out.\"\n\n\"Go on, Tim!\" cried Andy, the Greek boy, pushing his way to the front.\n\"Go on!\" cried the others; and thus encouraged, Rafferty started up the\nsteps.\n\n\"I mean to see my father!\" As Cartwright caught him by the shoulder, he\nyelled, \"Let me go, I say!\"\n\nIt was evident that the superintendent was trying his best not to use\nviolence; he was ordering his own followers back at the same time that\nhe was holding the boy. But Tim's blood was up; he shoved forward, and\nthe superintendent, either striking him or trying to ward off a blow,\nthrew him backwards down the steps. There was an uproar of rage from the\nthrong; they surged forward, and at the same time some of the men on the\nporch drew revolvers.\n\nThe meaning of that situation was plain enough. In a moment more the mob\nwould be up the steps, and there would be shooting. And if once that\nhappened, who could guess the end? Wrought up as the crowd was, it might\nnot stop till it had fired every company building, perhaps not until it\nhad murdered every company representative.\n\nHal had resolved to keep in the back-ground, but he saw that to keep in\nthe back-ground at that moment would be an act of cowardice, almost a\ncrime. He sprang forward, his cry rising above the clamour. \"Stop, men!\nStop!\"\n\nThere was probably no other man in North Valley who could have got\nhimself heeded at that moment. But Hal had their confidence, he had\nearned the right to be heard. Had he not been to prison for them, had\nthey not seen him behind the bars? \"Joe Smith!\" The cry ran from one end\nof the excited throng to the other.\n\nHal was fighting his way forward, shoving men to one side, imploring,\ncommanding silence. \"Tim Rafferty! Wait!\" And Tim, recognising the\nvoice, obeyed.\n\nOnce clear of the press, Hal sprang upon the porch, where Cartwright did\nnot attempt to interfere with him.\n\n\"Men!\" he cried. \"Hold on a moment! This isn't what you want! You don't\nwant a fight!\" He paused for an instant; but he knew that no mere\nnegative would hold them at that moment. They must be told what they did\nwant. Just now he had learned the particular words that would carry, and\nhe proclaimed them at the top of his voice: \"What you want is a union! A\n_strike!_\"\n\nHe was answered by a roar from the crowd, the loudest yet. Yes, that was\nwhat they wanted! A strike! And they wanted Joe Smith to organise it, to\nlead it. He had been their leader once, he had been thrown out of camp\nfor it. How he had got back they were not quite clear--but here he was,\nand he was their darling. Hurrah for him! They would follow him to hell\nand back!\n\nAnd wasn't he the boy with the nerve! Standing there on the porch of the\nhospital, right under the very noses of the bosses, making a union\nspeech to them, and the bosses never daring to touch him! The crowd,\nrealising this situation, went wild with delight. The English-speaking\nmen shouted assent to his words; and those who could not understand,\nshouted because the others did.\n\nThey did not want fighting--of course not! Fighting would not help them!\nWhat would help them was to get together, and stand a solid body of free\nmen. There would be a union committee, able to speak for all of them, to\nsay that no man would go to work any more until justice was secured!\nThey would have an end to the business of discharging men because they\nasked for their rights, of blacklisting men and driving them out of the\ndistrict because they presumed to want what the laws of the state\nawarded them!\n\n\n\nSECTION 6.\n\nHow long could a man expect to stand on the steps of a company building,\nwith a super and a pit-boss at his back, and organise a union of\nmine-workers? Hal realised that he must move the crowd from that\nperilous place.\n\n\"You'll do what I say, now?\" he demanded; and when they agreed in\nchorus, he added the warning: \"There'll be no fighting! And no drinking!\nIf you see any man drunk to-night, sit on him and hold him down!\"\n\nThey laughed and cheered. Yes, they would keep straight. Here was a job\nfor sober men, you bet!\n\n\"And now,\" Hal continued, \"the people in the hospital. We'll have a\ncommittee go in and see about them. No noise--we don't want to disturb\nthe sick men. We only want to make sure nobody else is disturbing them.\nSome one will go in and stay with them. Does that suit you?\"\n\nYes, that suited them.\n\n\"All right,\" said Hal. \"Keep quiet for a moment.\"\n\nAnd he turned to the superintendent. \"Cartwright,\" said he, \"we want a\ncommittee to go in and stay with our people.\" Then, as the\nsuperintendent started to expostulate, he added, in a low voice, \"Don't\nbe a fool, man! Don't you see I'm trying to save your life?\"\n\nThe superintendent knew how bad it would be for discipline to let Hal\ncarry his point with the crowd; but also he saw the immediate\ndanger--and he was not sure of the courage and shooting ability of\nbook-keepers and stenographers.\n\n\"Be quick, man!\" exclaimed Hal. \"I can't hold these people long. If you\ndon't want hell breaking loose, come to your senses.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Cartwright, swallowing his dignity.\n\nAnd Hal turned to the men and announced the concession. There was a\nshout of triumph.\n\n\"Now, who's to go?\" said Hal, when he could be heard again; and he\nlooked about at the upturned faces. There Were Tim and Wauchope, the\nmost obvious ones; but Hal decided to keep them under his eye. He\nthought of Jerry Minetti and of Mrs. David--but remembered his agreement\nwith \"Big Jack,\" to keep their own little group in the back-ground. Then\nhe thought of Mary Burke; she had already done herself all the harm she\ncould do, and she was a person the crowd would trust. He called her, and\ncalled Mrs. Ferris, an American woman in the crowd. The two came up the\nsteps, and Hal turned to Cartwright.\n\n\"Now, let's have an understanding,\" he said. \"These people are going in\nto stay with the sick men, and to talk to them if they want to, and\nnobody's going to give them any orders but the doctors and nurses. Is\nthat right?\"\n\n\"All right,\" said the superintendent, sullenly.\n\n\"Good!\" said Hal. \"And for God's sake have a little sense and stand by\nyour word; this crowd has had all it can endure, and if you do any more\nto provoke it, the consequences will be on you. And while you're about\nit, see that the saloons are closed and kept closed until this trouble\nis settled. And keep your people out of the way--don't let them go about\nshowing their guns and making faces.\"\n\nWithout waiting to hear the superintendent's reply, Hal turned to the\nthrong, and held up his hand for silence. \"Men,\" he said, \"we have a big\njob to do--we're going to organise a union. And we can't do it here in\nfront of the hospital. We've made too much noise already. Let's go off\nquietly, and have our meeting on the dump in back of the power-house.\nDoes that suit you?\"\n\nThey answered that it suited them; and Hal, having seen the two women\npassed safely into the hospital, sprang down from the porch to lead the\nway. Jerry Minetti came to his side, trembling with delight; and Hal\nclutched him by the arm and whispered, excitedly, \"Sing, Jerry! Sing\nthem some Dago song!\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 7.\n\nThey got to the place appointed without any fighting. And meantime Hal\nhad worked out in his mind a plan for communicating with this polyglot\nhorde. He knew that half the men could not understand a word of English,\nand that half the remainder understood very little. Obviously, if he was\nto make matters clear to them, they must be sorted out according to\nnationality, and a reliable interpreter found for each group.\n\nThe process of sorting proved a slow one, involving no end of shouting\nand good-natured jostling--Polish here, Bohemian here, Greek here,\nItalian here! When this job had been done, and a man found from each\nnationality who understood enough English to translate to his fellows,\nHal started in to make a speech. But before he had spoken many\nsentences, pandemonium broke loose. All the interpreters started\ninterpreting at the same time--and at the top of their lungs; it was\nlike a parade with the bands close together! Hal was struck dumb; then\nhe began to laugh, and the various audiences began to laugh; the orators\nstopped, perplexed--then they too began to laugh. So wave after wave of\nmerriment rolled over the throng; the mood of the assembly was changed\nall at once, from rage and determination to the wildest hilarity. Hal\nlearned his first lesson in the handling of these hordes of child-like\npeople, whose moods were quick, whose tempers were balanced upon a fine\npoint.\n\nIt was necessary for him to make his speech through to the end, and then\nmove the various audiences apart, to be addressed by the various\ninterpreters. But then arose a new difficulty. How could any one control\nthese floods of eloquence? How be sure that the message was not being\ndistorted? Hal had been warned by Olson of company detectives who posed\nas workers, gaining the confidence of men in order to incite them to\nviolence. And certainly some of these interpreters were violent-looking,\nand one's remarks sounded strange in their translations!\n\nThere was the Greek orator, for example; a wild man, with wild hair and\neyes, who tore all his passions to tatters. He stood upon a barrel-head,\nwith the light of two pit-lamps upon him, and some two score of his\ncompatriots at his feet; he waved his arms, he shook his fists, he\nshrieked, he bellowed. But when Hal, becoming uneasy, went over and\nasked another English-speaking Greek what the orator was saying, the\nanswer was that he was promising that the law should be enforced in\nNorth Valley!\n\nHal stood watching this perfervid little man, a study in the\npossibilities of gesture. He drew back his shoulders and puffed out his\nchest, almost throwing himself backwards off the barrel-head; he was\nsaying that the miners would be able to live like men. He crouched down\nand bowed his head, moaning; he was telling them what would happen if\nthey gave up. He fastened his fingers in his long black hair and began\ntugging desperately; he pulled, and then stretched out his empty hands;\nhe pulled again, so hard that it almost made one cry out with pain to\nwatch him. Hal asked what that was for; and the answer was, \"He say,\n'Stand by union! Pull one hair, he come out; pull all hairs, no come\nout'!\" It carried one back to the days of Aesop and his fables!\n\nTom Olson had told Hal something about the technique of an organiser,\nwho wished to drill these ignorant hordes. He had to repeat and repeat,\nuntil the dullest in his audience had grasped his meaning, had got into\nhis head the all-saving idea of solidarity. When the various orators had\ntalked themselves out, and the audiences had come back to the\ncinder-heap, Hal made his speech all over again, in words of one\nsyllable, in the kind of pidgin-English which does duty in the camps.\nSometimes he would stop to reinforce it with Greek or Italian or Slavish\nwords he had picked up. Or perhaps his eloquence would inflame some one\nof the interpreters afresh, and he would wait while the man shouted a\nfew sentences to his compatriots. It was not necessary to consider the\npossibility of boring any one, for these were patient and long-suffering\nmen, and now desperately in earnest.\n\nThey were going to have a union; they were going to do the thing in\nregular form, with membership cards and officials chosen by ballot. So\nHal explained to them, step by step. There was no use organising unless\nthey meant to stay organised. They would choose leaders, one from each\nof the principal language groups; and these leaders would meet and draw\nup a set of demands, which would be submitted in mass-meeting, and\nratified, and then presented to the bosses with the announcement that\nuntil these terms were granted, not a single North Valley worker would\ngo back into the pits.\n\nJerry Minetti, who knew all about unions, advised Hal to enroll the men\nat once; he counted on the psychological effect of having each man come\nforward and give in his name. But here at once they met a difficulty\nencountered by all would-be organisers--lack of funds. There must be\npencils and paper for the enrollment; and Hal had emptied his pockets\nfor Jack David! He was forced to borrow a quarter, and send a messenger\noff to the store. It was voted by the delegates that each member as he\njoined the union should be assessed a dime. There would have to be some\ntelegraphing and telephoning if they were going to get help from the\noutside world.\n\nA temporary committee was named, consisting of Tim Rafferty, Wauchope\nand Hal, to keep the lists and the funds, and to run things until\nanother meeting could be held on the morrow; also a body-guard of a\ndozen of the sturdiest and most reliable men were named to stay by the\ncommittee. The messenger came back with pads and pencils, and sitting on\nthe ground by the light of pit-lamps, the interpreters wrote down the\nnames of the men who wished to join the union, each man in turn pledging\nhis word for solidarity and discipline. Then the meeting was declared\nadjourned till daylight of the morrow, and the workers scattered to\ntheir homes to sleep, with a joy and sense of power such as few of them\nhad ever known in their lives before.\n\n\n\nSECTION 8.\n\nThe committee and its body-guard repaired to the dining-room of\nReminitsky's, where they stretched themselves out on the floor; no one\nattempted to interfere with them, and while the majority snored\npeacefully, Hal and a small group sat writing out the list of demands\nwhich were to be submitted to the bosses in the morning. It was arranged\nthat Jerry should go down to Pedro by the early morning train, to get\ninto touch with Jack David and the union officials, and report to them\nthe latest developments. Because the officials were sure to have\ndetectives following them, Hal warned Jerry to go to MacKellar's house,\nand have MacKellar bring \"Big Jack\" to meet him there. Also Jerry must\nhave MacKellar get the _Gazette_ on the long distance phone, and tell\nBilly Keating about the strike.\n\nA hundred things like this Hal had to think of; his head was a-buzz with\nthem, so that when he lay down to sleep he could not. He thought about\nthe bosses, and what they might be doing. The bosses would not be\nsleeping, he felt sure!\n\nAnd then came thoughts about his private-car friends; about the\nstrangeness of this plight into which he had got himself! He laughed\naloud in a kind of desperation as he recalled Percy's efforts to get him\naway from here. And poor Jessie! What could he say to her now?\n\nThe bosses made no move that night; and when morning came, the strikers\nhurried to the meeting-place, some of them without even stopping for\nbreakfast. They came tousled and unkempt, looking anxiously at their\nfellows, as if unable to credit the memory of the bold thing they had\ndone on the night before. But finding the committee and its body-guard\non hand and ready for business, their courage revived, they felt again\nthe wonderful sentiment of solidarity which had made men of them. Pretty\nsoon speech-making began, and cheering and singing, which brought out\nthe laggards and the cowards. So in a short while the movement was in\nfull swing, with practically every man, woman and child among the\nworkers present.\n\nMary Burke came from the hospital, where she had spent the night. She\nlooked weary and bedraggled, but her spirit of battle had not slumped.\nShe reported that she had talked with some of the injured men, and that\nmany of them had signed \"releases,\" whereby the company protected itself\nagainst even the threat of a lawsuit. Others had refused to sign, and\nMary had been vehement in warning them to stand out. Two other women\nvolunteered to go to the hospital, in order that she might have a chance\nto rest; but Mary did not wish to rest, she did not feel as if she could\never rest again.\n\nThe members of the newly-organised union proceeded to elect officers.\nThey sought to make Hal president, but he was shy of binding himself in\nthat irrevocable way, and succeeded in putting the honour off on\nWauchope. Tim Rafferty was made treasurer and secretary. Then a\ncommittee was chosen to go to Cartwright with the demands of the men. It\nincluded Hal, Wauchope, and Tim; an Italian named Marcelli, whom Jerry\nhad vouched for; a representative of the Slavs and one of the\nGreeks--Rusick and Zammakis, both of them solid and faithful men.\nFinally, with a good deal of laughter and cheering, the meeting voted to\nadd Mary Burke to this committee. It was a new thing to have a woman in\nsuch a role, but Mary was the daughter of a miner and the sister of a\nbreaker-boy, and had as good a right to speak as any one in North\nValley.\n\n\n\nSECTION 9.\n\nHal read the document which had been prepared the night before. They\ndemanded the right to have a union without being discharged for it. They\ndemanded a check-weighman, to be elected by the men themselves. They\ndemanded that the mines should be sprinkled to prevent explosions, and\nproperly timbered to prevent falls. They demanded the right to trade at\nany store they pleased. Hal called attention to the fact that every one\nof these demands was for a right guaranteed by the laws of the state;\nthis was a significant fact, and he urged the men not to include other\ndemands. After some argument they voted down the proposition of the\nradicals, who wanted a ten per cent. increase in wages. Also they voted\ndown the proposition of a syndicalist-anarchist, who explained to them\nin a jumble of English and Italian that the mines belonged to them, and\nthat they should refuse all compromise and turn the bosses out\nforthwith.\n\nWhile this speech was being delivered, young Rovetta pushed his way\nthrough the crowd and drew Hal to one side. He had been down by the\nrailroad-station and seen the morning train come in. From it had\ndescended a crowd of thirty or forty men, of that \"hard citizen\" type\nwhich every miner in the district could recognise at the first glance.\nEvidently the company officials had been keeping the telephone-wires\nbusy that night; they were bringing in, not merely this train-load of\nguards, but automobile loads from other camps--from the Northeastern\ndown the canyon, and from Barela, in a side canyon over the mountain.\n\nHal told this news to the meeting, which received it with howls of rage.\nSo that was the bosses' plan! Hot-heads sprang upon the cinder-heap,\nhalf a dozen of them trying to make speeches at once. The leaders had to\nsuppress these too impetuous ones by main force; once more Hal gave the\nwarning of \"No fighting!\" They were going to have faith in their union;\nthey were going to present a solid front to the company, and the company\nwould learn the lesson that intimidation would not win a strike.\n\nSo it was agreed, and the committee set out for the company's office,\nWauchope carrying in his hand the written demands of the meeting. Behind\nthe committee marched the crowd in a solid mass; they packed the street\nin front of the office, while the heroic seven went up the steps and\npassed into the building. Wauchope made inquiry for Mr. Cartwright, and\na clerk took in the message.\n\nThey stood waiting; and meanwhile, one of the office-people, coming in\nfrom the street, beckoned to Hal. He had an envelope in his hand, and\ngave it over without a word. It was addressed, \"Joe Smith,\" and Hal\nopened it, and found within a small visiting card, at which he stared.\n\"Edward S. Warner, Jr.\"!\n\nFor a moment Hal could hardly believe the evidence of his eyesight.\nEdward in North Valley! Then, turning the card over, he read, in his\nbrother's familiar handwriting, \"I am at Cartwright's house. I must see\nyou. The matter concerns Dad. Come instantly.\"\n\nFear leaped into Hal's heart. What could such a message mean?\n\nHe turned quickly to the committee and explained. \"My father's an old\nman, and had a stroke of apoplexy three years ago. I'm afraid he may be\ndead, or very ill. I must go.\"\n\n\"It's a trick!\" cried Wauchope excitedly.\n\n\"No, not possibly,\" answered Hal. \"I know my brother's handwriting. I\nmust see him.\"\n\n\"Well,\" declared the other, \"we'll wait. We'll not see Cartwright until\nyou get back.\"\n\nHal considered this. \"I don't think that's wise,\" he said. \"You can do\nwhat you have to do just as well without me.\"\n\n\"But I wanted you to do the talking!\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Hal, \"that's your business, Wauchope. You are the\npresident of the union. You know what the men want, as well as I do; you\nknow what they complain of. And besides, there's not going to be any\nneed of talking with Cartwright. Either he's going to grant our demands\nor he isn't.\"\n\nThey discussed the matter back and forth. Mary Burke insisted that they\nwere pulling Hal away just at the critical moment! He laughed as he\nanswered. She was as good as any man when it came to an argument. If\nWauchope showed signs of weakening, let her speak up!\n\n\n\nSECTION 10.\n\nSo Hal hurried off, and climbed the street which led to the\nsuperintendent's house, a concrete bungalow set upon a little elevation\noverlooking the camp. He rang the bell, and the door opened, and in the\nentrance stood his brother.\n\nEdward Warner was eight years older than Hal; the perfect type of the\nyoung American business man. His figure was erect and athletic, his\nfeatures were regular and strong, his voice, his manner, everything\nabout him spoke of quiet decision, of energy precisely directed. As a\nrule, he was a model of what the tailor's art could do, but just now\nthere was something abnormal about his attire as well as his manner.\n\nHal's anxiety had been increasing all the way up the street. \"What's the\nmatter with Dad?\" he cried.\n\n\"Dad's all right,\" was the answer--\"that is, for the moment.\"\n\n\"Then what--?\"\n\n\"Peter Harrigan's on his way back from the East. He's due in Western\nCity to-morrow. You can see that something will be the matter with Dad\nunless you quit this business at once.\"\n\nHal had a sudden reaction from his fear. \"So that's all!\" he exclaimed.\n\nHis brother was gazing at the young miner, dressed in sooty blue\noveralls, his face streaked with black, his wavy hair all mussed. \"You\nwired me you were going to leave here, Hal!\"\n\n\"So I was; but things happened that I couldn't foresee. There's a\nstrike.\"\n\n\"Yes; but what's that got to do with it?\" Then, with exasperation in his\nvoice, \"For God's sake, Hal, how much farther do you expect to go?\"\n\nHal stood for a few moments, looking at his brother. Even in a tension\nas he was, he could not help laughing. \"I know how all this must seem to\nyou, Edward. It's a long story; I hardly know how to begin.\"\n\n\"No, I suppose not,\" said Edward, drily.\n\nAnd Hal laughed again. \"Well, we agree that far, at any rate. What I was\nhoping was that we could talk it all over quietly, after the excitement\nwas past. When I explain to you about conditions in this place--\"\n\nBut Edward interrupted. \"Really, Hal, there's no use of such an\nargument. I have nothing to do with conditions in Peter Harrigan's\ncamps.\"\n\nThe smile left Hal's face. \"Would you have preferred to have me\ninvestigate conditions in the Warner camps?\" Hal had tried to suppress\nhis irritation, but there was simply no way these two could get along.\n\"We've had our arguments about these things, Edward, and you've always\nhad the best of me--you could tell me I was a child, it was presumptuous\nof me to dispute your assertions. But now--well, I'm a child no longer,\nand we'll have to meet on a new basis.\"\n\nHal's tone, more than his words, made an impression. Edward thought\nbefore he spoke. \"Well, what's your new basis?\"\n\n\"Just now I'm in the midst of a strike, and I can hardly stop to\nexplain.\"\n\n\"You don't think of Dad in all this madness?\"\n\n\"I think of Dad, and of you too, Edward; but this is hardly the time--\"\n\n\"If ever in the world there was a time, this is it!\"\n\nHal groaned inwardly. \"All right,\" he said, \"sit down. I'll try to give\nyou some idea how I got swept into this.\"\n\nHe began to tell about the conditions he had found in this stronghold of\nthe \"G. F. C.\" As usual, when he talked about it, he became absorbed in\nits human aspects; a fervour came into his tone, he was carried on, as\nhe had been when he tried to argue with the officials in Pedro. But his\neloquence was interrupted, even as it had been then; he discovered that\nhis brother was in such a state of exasperation that he could not listen\nto a consecutive argument.\n\nIt was the old, old story; it had been thus as far back as Hal could\nremember. It seemed one of the mysteries of nature, how she could have\nbrought two such different temperaments out of the same parentage.\nEdward was practical and positive; he knew what he wanted in the world,\nand he knew how to get it; he was never troubled with doubts, nor with\nself-questioning, nor with any other superfluous emotions; he could not\nunderstand people who allowed that sort of waste in their mental\nprocesses. He could not understand people who got \"swept into things.\"\n\nIn the beginning, he had had with Hal the prestige of the elder brother.\nHe was handsome as a young Greek god, he was strong and masterful;\nwhether he was flying over the ice with sure, strong strokes, or cutting\nthe water with his glistening shoulders, or bringing down a partridge\nwith the certainty and swiftness of a lightning stroke, Edward was the\nincarnation of Success. When he said that one's ideas were \"rot,\" when\nhe spoke with contempt of \"mollycoddles\"--then indeed one suffered in\nsoul, and had to go back to Shelley and Ruskin to renew one's courage.\n\nThe questioning of life had begun very early with Hal; there seemed to\nbe something in his nature which forced him to go to the roots of\nthings; and much as he looked up to his wonderful brother, he had been\nmade to realise that there were sides of life to which this brother was\nblind. To begin with, there were religious doubts; the distresses of\nmind which plague a young man when first it dawns upon him that the\nfaith he has been brought up in is a higher kind of fairy-tale. Edward\nhad never asked such questions, apparently. He went to church, because\nit was the thing to do; more especially because it was pleasing to the\nyoung lady he wished to marry to have him put on stately clothes, and\nescort her to a beautiful place of music and flowers and perfumes, where\nshe would meet her friends, also in stately clothes. How abnormal it\nseemed to Edward that a young man should give up this pleasant custom,\nmerely because he could not be sure that Jonah had swallowed a whale!\n\nBut it was when Hal's doubts attacked his brother's week-day\nreligion--the religion of the profit-system--that the controversy\nbetween them had become deadly. At first Hal had known nothing about\npractical affairs, and it had been Edward's duty to answer his\nquestions. The prosperity of the country had been built up by strong\nmen; and these men had enemies--evil-minded persons, animated by\njealousy and other base passions, seeking to tear down the mighty\nstructure. At first this devil-theory had satisfied the boy; but later\non, as he had come to read and observe, he had been plagued by doubts.\nIn the end, listening to his brother's conversation, and reading the\nwritings of so-called \"muck-rakers,\" the realisation was forced upon him\nthat there were two types of mind in the controversy--those who thought\nof profits, and those who thought of human beings.\n\nEdward was alarmed at the books Hal was reading; he was still more\nalarmed when he saw the ideas Hal was bringing home from college. There\nmust have been some strange change in Harrigan in a few years; no one\nhad dreamed of such ideas when Edward was there! No one had written\nsatiric songs about the faculty, or the endowments of eminent\nphilanthropists!\n\nIn the meantime Edward Warner Senior had had a paralytic stroke, and\nEdward Junior had taken charge of the company. Three years of this had\ngiven him the point of view of a coal-operator, hard and set for a\nlife-time. The business of a coal-operator was to buy his labour cheap,\nto turn out the maximum product in the shortest time, and to sell the\nproduct at the market price to parties whose credit was satisfactory. If\na concern was doing that, it was a successful concern; for any one to\nmention that it was making wrecks of the people who dug the coal, was to\nbe guilty of sentimentality and impertinence.\n\nEdward had heard with dismay his brother's announcement that he meant to\nstudy industry by spending his vacation as a common labourer. However,\nwhen he considered it, he was inclined to think that the idea might not\nbe such a bad one. Perhaps Hal would not find what he was looking for;\nperhaps, working with his hands, he might get some of the nonsense\nknocked out of his head!\n\nBut now the experiment had been made, and the revelation had burst upon\nEdward that it had been a ghastly failure. Hal had not come to realise\nthat labour was turbulent and lazy and incompetent, needing a strong\nhand to rule it; on the contrary, he had become one of these turbulent\nones himself! A champion of the lazy and incompetent, an agitator, a\nfomenter of class-prejudice, an enemy of his own friends, and of his\nbrother's business associates!\n\nNever had Hal seen Edward in such a state of excitement. There was\nsomething really abnormal about him, Hal realised; it puzzled him\nvaguely while he talked, but he did not understand it until his brother\ntold how he had come to be here. He had been attending a dinner-dance at\nthe home of a friend, and Percy Harrigan had got him on the telephone at\nhalf past eleven o'clock at night. Percy had had a message from\nCartwright, to the effect that Hal was leading a riot in North Valley;\nPercy had painted the situation in such lurid colours that Edward had\nmade a dash and caught the midnight train, wearing his evening clothes,\nand without so much as a tooth-brush with him!\n\nHal could hardly keep from bursting out laughing. His brother, his\npunctilious and dignified brother, alighting from a sleeping-car at\nseven o'clock in the morning, wearing a dress suit and a silk hat! And\nhere he was, Edward Warner Junior, the fastidious, who never paid less\nthan a hundred and fifty dollars for a suit of clothes, clad in a\n\"hand-me-down\" for which he had expended twelve dollars and forty-eight\ncents in a \"Jew-store\" in a coal-town!\n\n\n\nSECTION 11.\n\nBut Edward would not stop for a single smile; his every faculty was\nabsorbed in the task he had before him, to get his brother out of this\npredicament, so dangerous and so humiliating. Hal had come to a town\nowned by Edward's business friends, and had proceeded to meddle in their\naffairs, to stir up their labouring people and imperil their property.\nThat North Valley was the property of the General Fuel Company--not\nmerely the mines and the houses, but likewise the people who lived in\nthem--Edward seemed to have no doubt whatever; Hal got only exclamations\nof annoyance when he suggested any other point of view. Would there have\nbeen any town of North Valley, if it had not been for the capital and\nenergy of the General Fuel Company? If the people of North Valley did\nnot like the conditions which the General Fuel Company offered them,\nthey had one simple and obvious remedy--to go somewhere else to work.\nBut they stayed; they got out the General Fuel Company's coal, they took\nthe General Fuel Company's wages--\n\n\"Well, they've stopped taking them now,\" put in Hal.\n\nAll right, that was their affair, replied Edward. But let them stop\nbecause they wanted to--not because outside agitators put them up to it.\nAt any rate, let the agitators not include a member of the Warner\nfamily!\n\nThe elder brother pictured old Peter Harrigan on his way back from the\nEast; the state of unutterable fury in which he would arrive, the storm\nhe would raise in the business world of Western City. Why, it was\nunimaginable, such a thing had never been heard of! \"And right when\nwe're opening up a new mine--when we need every dollar of credit we can\nget!\"\n\n\"Aren't we big enough to stand off Peter Harrigan?\" inquired Hal.\n\n\"We have plenty of other people to stand off,\" was the answer. \"We don't\nhave to go out of our way to make enemies.\"\n\nEdward spoke, not merely as the elder brother, but also as the money-man\nof the family. When the father had broken down from over-work, and had\nbeen changed in one terrible hour from a driving man of affairs into a\nchildish and pathetic invalid, Hal had been glad enough that there was\none member of the family who was practical; he had been perfectly\nwilling to see his brother shoulder these burdens, while he went off to\ncollege, to amuse himself with satiric songs. Hal had no\nresponsibilities, no one asked anything of him--except that he would not\nthrow sticks into the wheels of the machine his brother was running.\n\"You are living by the coal industry! Every dollar you spend comes from\nit--\"\n\n\"I know it! I know it!\" cried Hal. \"That's the thing that torments me!\nThe fact that I'm living upon the bounty of such wage-slaves--\"\n\n\"Oh, cut it out!\" cried Edward. \"That's not what I mean!\"\n\n\"I know--but it's what _I_ mean! From now on I mean to know about the\npeople who work for me, and what sort of treatment they get. I'm no\nlonger your kid-brother, to be put off with platitudes.\"\n\n\"You know ours are union mines, Hal--\"\n\n\"Yes, but what does that mean? How do we work it? Do we give the men\ntheir weights?\"\n\n\"Of course! They have their check-weighmen.\"\n\n\"But then, how do we compete with the operators in this district, who\npay for a ton of three thousand pounds?\"\n\n\"We manage it--by economy.\"\n\n\"Economy? I don't see Peter Harrigan wasting anything here!\" Hal paused\nfor an answer, but none came. \"Do we buy the check-weighmen? Do we bribe\nthe labour leaders?\"\n\nEdward coloured slightly. \"What's the use of being nasty, Hal? You know\nI don't do dirty work.\"\n\n\"I don't mean to be nasty, Edward; but you must know that many a\nbusiness-man can say he doesn't do dirty work, because he has others do\nit for him. What about politics, for instance? Do we run a machine, and\nput our clerks and bosses into the local offices?\"\n\nEdward did not answer, and Hal persisted, \"I mean to know these things!\nI'm not going to be blind any more!\"\n\n\"All right, Hal--you can know anything you want; but for God's sake, not\nnow! If you want to be taken for a man, show a man's common sense!\nHere's Old Peter getting back to Western City to-morrow night! Don't you\nknow that he'll be after me, raging like a mad bull? Don't you know that\nif I tell him I can do nothing--that I've been down here and tried to\npull you away--don't you know he'll go after Dad?\"\n\nEdward had tried all the arguments, and this was the only one that\ncounted. \"You must keep him away from Dad!\" exclaimed Hal.\n\n\"You tell me that!\" retorted the other. \"And when you know Old Peter!\nDon't you know he'll get at him, if he has to break down the door of the\nhouse? He'll throw the burden of his rage on that poor old man! You've\nbeen warned about it clearly; you know it may be a matter of life and\ndeath to keep Dad from getting excited. I don't know what he'd do; maybe\nhe'd fly into a rage with you, maybe he'd defend you. He's old and weak,\nhe's lost his grip on things. Anyhow, he'd not let Peter abuse you--and\nlike as not he'd drop dead in the midst of the dispute! Do you want to\nhave that on your conscience, along with the troubles of your workingmen\nfriends?\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 12.\n\nHal sat staring in front of him, silent. Was it a fact that every man\nhad something in his life which palsied his arm, and struck him helpless\nin the battle for social justice?\n\nWhen he spoke again, it was in a low voice. \"Edward, I'm thinking about\na young Irish boy who works in these mines. He, too, has a father; and\nthis father was caught in the explosion. He's an old man, with a wife\nand seven other children. He's a good man, the boy's a good boy. Let me\ntell you what Peter Harrigan has done to them!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Edward, \"whatever it is, it's all right, you can help them.\nThey won't need to starve.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Hal, \"but there are so many others; I can't help them\nall. And besides, can't you see, Edward--what I'm thinking about is not\ncharity, but _justice_. I'm sure this boy, Tim Rafferty, loves his\nfather just exactly as much as I love my father; and there are other old\nmen here, with sons who love them--\"\n\n\"Oh, Hal, for Christ's sake!\" exclaimed Edward, in a sort of explosion.\nHe had no other words to express his impatience. \"Do you expect to take\nall the troubles in the world on your shoulders?\" And he sprang up and\ncaught the other by the arm. \"Boy, you've got to come away from here!\"\n\nHal got up, without answering. He seemed irresolute, and his brother\nstarted to draw him towards the door. \"I've got a car here. We can get a\ntrain in an hour--\"\n\nHal saw that he had to speak firmly. \"No, Edward,\" he said. \"I can't\ncome just yet.\"\n\n\"I tell you you _must_ come!\"\n\n\"I can't. I made these men a promise!\"\n\n\"In God's name--what are these men to you? Compared with your own\nfather!\"\n\n\"I can't explain it, Edward. I've talked for half an hour, and I don't\nthink you've even heard me. Suffice it to say that I see these people\ncaught in a trap--and one that my whole life has helped to make. I can't\nleave them in it. What's more, I don't believe Dad would want me to do\nit, if he understood.\"\n\nThe other made a last effort at self-control. \"I'm not going to call you\na sentimental fool. Only, let me ask you one plain question. What do you\nthink you can _do_ for these people?\"\n\n\"I think I can help to win decent conditions for them.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" cried Edward; he sighed, in his agony of exasperation. \"In\nPeter Harrigan's mines! Don't you realise that he'll pick them up and\nthrow them out of here, neck and crop--the whole crew, every man in the\ntown, if necessary?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" answered Hal; \"but if the men in the other mines should join\nthem--if the big union outside should stand by them--\"\n\n\"You're dreaming, Hal! You're talking like a child! I talked to the\nsuperintendent here; he had telegraphed the situation to Old Peter, and\nhad just got an answer. Already he's acted, no doubt.\"\n\n\"Acted?\" echoed Hal. \"How do you mean?\" He was staring at his brother in\nsudden anxiety.\n\n\"They were going to turn the agitators out, of course.\"\n\n\"_What?_ And while I'm here talking!\"\n\nHal turned toward the door. \"You knew it all the time!\" he exclaimed.\n\"You kept me here deliberately!\"\n\nHe was starting away, but Edward sprang and caught him. \"What could you\nhave done?\"\n\n\"Turn me loose!\" cried Hal, angrily.\n\n\"Don't be a fool, Hal! I've been trying to keep you out of the trouble.\nThere may be fighting.\"\n\nEdward threw himself between Hal and the door, and there was a sharp\nstruggle. But the elder man was no longer the athlete, the young bronzed\ngod; he had been sitting at a desk in an office, while Hal had been\ndoing hard labour. Hal threw him to one side, and in a moment more had\nsprung out of the door, and was running down the slope.\n\n\n\nSECTION 13.\n\nComing to the main street of the village, Hal saw the crowd in front of\nthe office. One glance told him that something had happened. Men were\nrunning this way and that, gesticulating, shouting. Some were coming in\nhis direction, and when they saw him they began to yell to him. The\nfirst to reach him was Klowoski, the little Pole, breathless; gasping\nwith excitement. \"They fire our committee!\"\n\n\"Fire them?\"\n\n\"Fire 'em out! Down canyon!\" The little man was waving his arms in wild\ngestures; his eyes seemed about to start out of his head. \"Take 'em off!\nWhole bunch fellers--gunmen! People see them--come out back door. Got\never'body's arm tied. Gunmen fellers hold 'em, don't let 'em holler,\ncan't do nothin'! Got them cars waitin'--what you call?--\"\n\n\"Automobiles?\"\n\n\"Sure, got three! Put ever'body in, quick like that--they go down road\nlike wind! Go down canyon, all gone! They bust our strike!\" And the\nlittle Pole's voice ended in a howl of despair.\n\n\"No, they won't bust our strike!\" exclaimed Hal. \"Not yet!\"\n\nSuddenly he was reminded of the fact that his brother had followed\nhim--puffing hard, for the run had been strenuous. He caught Hal by the\narm, exclaiming, \"Keep out of this, I tell you!\"\n\nThus while Hal was questioning Klowoski, he was struggling\nhalf-unconsciously, to free himself from his brother's grasp. Suddenly\nthe matter was forced to an issue, for the little Polack emitted a cry\nlike an angry cat, and went at Edward with fingers outstretched like\nclaws. Hal's dignified brother would have had to part with his dignity,\nif Hal had not caught Klowoski's onrush with his other arm. \"Let him\nalone!\" he said. \"It's my brother!\" Whereupon the little man fell back\nand stood watching in bewilderment.\n\nHal saw Androkulos running to him. The Greek boy had been in the street\nback of the office, and had seen the committee carried off; nine people\nhad been taken--Wauchope, Tim Rafferty, and Mary Burke, Marcelli,\nZammakis and Rusick, and three others who had served as interpreters on\nthe night before. It had all been done so quickly that the crowd had\nscarcely realised what was happening.\n\nNow, having grasped the meaning of it, the men were beside themselves\nwith rage. They shook their fists, shouting defiance to a group of\nofficials and guards who were visible upon the porch of the\noffice-building. There was a clamour of shouts for revenge.\n\nHal could see instantly the dangers of the situation; he was like a man\nwatching the burning fuse of a bomb. Now, if ever, this polyglot horde\nmust have leadership--wise and cool and resourceful leadership.\n\nThe crowd, discovering his presence, surged down upon him like a wave.\nThey gathered round him, howling. They had lost the rest of their\ncommittee, but they still had Joe Smith. Joe Smith! Hurrah for Joe! Let\nthe gunmen take him, if they could! They waved their caps, they tried to\nlift him upon their shoulders, so that all could see him.\n\nThere was clamour for a speech, and Hal started to make his way to the\nsteps of the nearest building, with Edward holding on to his coat.\nEdward was jostled; he had to part with his dignity--but he did not part\nwith his brother. And when Hal was about to mount the steps, Edward made\na last desperate effort, shouting into his ear, \"Wait a minute! Wait!\nAre you going to try to talk to this mob?\"\n\n\"Of course. Don't you see there'll be trouble if I don't?\"\n\n\"You'll get yourself killed! You'll start a fight, and get a lot of\nthese poor devils shot! Use your common sense, Hal; the company has\nbrought in guards, and they are armed, and your people aren't.\"\n\n\"That's exactly why I have to speak!\"\n\nThe discussion was carried on under difficulties, the elder brother\nclinging to the younger's arm, while the younger sought to pull free,\nand the mob shouted with a single voice, \"Speech! Speech!\" There were\nsome near by who, like Klowoski, did not relish having this stranger\ninterfering with their champion, and showed signs of a disposition to\n\"mix in\"; so at last Edward gave up the struggle, and the orator mounted\nthe steps and faced the throng.\n\n\n\nSECTION 14.\n\nHal raised his arms as a signal for silence.\n\n\"Boys,\" he cried, \"they've kidnapped our committee. They think they'll\nbreak our strike that way--but they'll find they've made a mistake!\"\n\n\"They will! Right you are!\" roared a score of voices.\n\n\"They forget that we've got a union. Hurrah for our North Valley union!\"\n\n\"Hurrah! Hurrah!\" The cry echoed to the canyon-walls.\n\n\"And hurrah for the big union that will back us--the United Mine-Workers\nof America!\"\n\nAgain the yell rang out; again and again. \"Hurrah for the union! Hurrah\nfor the United Mine-Workers!\" A big American miner, Ferris, was in the\nfront of the throng, and his voice beat in Hal's ears like a\nsteam-siren.\n\n\"Boys,\" Hal resumed, when at last he could be heard, \"use your brains a\nmoment. I warned you they would try to provoke you! They would like\nnothing better than to start a scrap here, and get a chance to smash our\nunion! Don't forget that, boys, if they can make you fight, they'll\nsmash the union, and the union is our only hope!\"\n\nAgain came the cry: \"Hurrah for the union!\" Hal let them shout it in\ntwenty languages, until they were satisfied.\n\n\"Now, boys,\" he went on, at last, \"they've shipped out our committee.\nThey may ship me out in the same way--\"\n\n\"No, they won't!\" shouted voices in the crowd. And there was a bellow of\nrage from Ferris. \"Let them try it! We'll burn them in their beds!\"\n\n\"But they _can_ ship me out!\" argued Hal. \"You _know_ they can beat us\nat that game! They can call on the sheriff, they can get the soldiers,\nif necessary! We can't oppose them by force--they can turn out every\nman, woman and child in the village, if they choose. What we have to get\nclear is that even that won't crush our union! Nor the big union\noutside, that will be backing us! We can hold out, and make them take us\nback in the end!\"\n\nSome of Hal's friends, seeing what he was trying to do, came to his\nsupport. \"No fighting! No violence! Stand by the union!\" And he went on\nto drive the lesson home; even though the company might evict them, the\nbig union of the four hundred and fifty thousand mine-workers of the\ncountry would feed them, it would call out the rest of the workers in\nthe district in sympathy. So the bosses, who thought to starve and cow\nthem into submission, would find their mines lying permanently idle.\nThey would be forced to give way, and the tactics of solidarity would\ntriumph.\n\nSo Hal went on, recalling the things Olson had told him, and putting\nthem into practice. He saw hope in their faces again, dispelling the\nmood of resentment and rage.\n\n\"Now, boys,\" said he, \"I'm going in to see the superintendent for you.\nI'll be your committee, since they've shipped out the rest.\"\n\nThe steam-siren of Ferris bellowed again: \"You're the boy! Joe Smith!\"\n\n\"All right, men--now mind what I say! I'll see the super, and then I'll\ngo down to Pedro, where there'll be some officers of the United\nMine-workers this morning. I'll tell them the situation, and ask them to\nback you. That's what you want, is it?\"\n\nThat was what they wanted. \"Big union!\"\n\n\"All right. I'll do the best I can for you, and I'll find some way to\nget word to you. And meantime you stand firm. The bosses will tell you\nlies, they'll try to deceive you, they'll send spies and trouble-makers\namong you--but you hold fast, and wait for the big union.\"\n\nHal stood looking at the cheering crowd. He had time to note some of the\nfaces upturned to him. Pitiful, toil-worn faces they were, each making\nits separate appeal, telling its individual story of deprivation and\ndefeat. Once more they were transfigured, shining with that wonderful\nnew light which he had seen for the first time the previous evening. It\nhad been crushed for a moment, but it flamed up again; it would never\ndie in the hearts of men--once they had learned the power it gave.\nNothing Hal had yet seen moved him so much as this new birth of\nenthusiasm. A beautiful, a terrible thing it was!\n\nHal looked at his brother, to see how he had been moved. What he saw on\nhis brother's face was satisfaction, boundless relief. The matter had\nturned out all right! Hal was coming away!\n\nHal turned again to the men; somehow, after his glance at Edward, they\nseemed more pitiful than ever. For Edward typified the power they were\nfacing--the unseeing, uncomprehending power that meant to crush them.\nThe possibility of failure was revealed to Hal in a flash of emotion,\noverwhelming him. He saw them as they would be, when no leader was at\nhand to make speeches to them. He saw them waiting, their life-long\nhabit of obedience striving to reassert itself; a thousand fears\nbesetting them, a thousand rumours preying upon them--wild beasts set on\nthem by their cunning enemies. They would suffer, not merely for\nthemselves, but for their wives and children--the very same pangs of\ndread that Hal suffered when he thought of one old man up in Western\nCity, whose doctors had warned him to avoid excitement.\n\nIf they stood firm, if they kept their bargain with their leader, they\nwould be evicted from their homes, they would face the cold of the\ncoming winter, they would face hunger and the black-list. And he,\nmeantime--what would he be doing? What was his part of the bargain? He\nwould interview the superintendent for them, he would turn them over to\nthe \"big union\"--and then he would go off to his own life of ease and\npleasure. To eat grilled steaks and hot rolls in a perfectly appointed\nclub, with suave and softly-moving servitors at his beck! To dance at\nthe country club with exquisite creatures of chiffon and satin, of\nperfume and sweet smiles and careless, happy charms! No, it was too\neasy! He might call that his duty to his father and brother, but he\nwould know in his heart that it was treason to life; it was the devil,\ntaking him onto a high mountain and showing him all the kingdoms of the\nearth!\n\nMoved by a sudden impulse, Hal raised his hands once more. \"Boys,\" he\nsaid, \"we understand each other now. You'll not go back to work till the\nbig union tells you. And I, for my part, will stand by you. Your cause\nis my cause, I'll go on fighting for you till you have your rights, till\nyou can live and work as men! Is that right?\"\n\n\"That's right! That's right!\"\n\n\"Very good, then--we'll swear to it!\" And Hal raised his hands, and the\nmen raised theirs, and amid a storm of shouts, and a frantic waving of\ncaps, he made them the pledge which he knew would bind his own\nconscience. He made it deliberately, there in his brother's presence.\nThis was no mere charge on a trench, it was enlisting for a war! But\neven in that moment of fervour, Hal would have been frightened had he\nrealised the period of that enlistment, the years of weary and desperate\nconflict to which he was pledging his life.\n\n\n\nSECTION 15.\n\nHal descended from his rostrum, and the crowds made way for him, and\nwith his brother at his side he went down the street to the office\nbuilding, upon the porch of which the guards were standing. His progress\nwas a triumphal one; rough voices shouted words of encouragement in his\nears, men jostled and fought to shake his hand or to pat him on the\nback; they even patted Edward and tried to shake his hand, because he\nwas with Hal, and seemed to have his confidence. Afterwards Hal thought\nit over and was merry. Such an adventure for Edward!\n\nThe younger man went up the steps of the building and spoke to the\nguards. \"I want to see Mr. Cartwright.\"\n\n\"He's inside,\" answered one, not cordially. With Edward following, Hal\nentered, and was ushered into the private office of the superintendent.\n\nHaving been a working-man, and class-conscious, Hal was observant of the\nmanners of mine-superintendents; he noted that Cartwright bowed politely\nto Edward, but did not include Edward's brother. \"Mr. Cartwright,\" he\nsaid, \"I have come to you as a deputation from the workers of this\ncamp.\"\n\nThe superintendent did not appear impressed by the announcement.\n\n\"I am instructed to say that the men demand the redress of four\ngrievances before they return to work. First--\"\n\nHere Cartwright spoke, in his quick, sharp way. \"There's no use going\non, sir. This company will deal only with its men as individuals. It\nwill recognise no deputations.\"\n\nHal's answer was equally quick. \"Very well, Mr. Cartwright. In that\ncase, I come to you as an individual.\"\n\nFor a moment the superintendent seemed nonplussed.\n\n\"I wish to ask four rights which are granted to me by the laws of this\nstate. First, the right to belong to a union, without being discharged\nfor it.\"\n\nThe other had recovered his manner of quiet mastery. \"You have that\nright, sir; you have always had it. You know perfectly well that the\ncompany has never discharged any one for belonging to a union.\"\n\nThe man was looking at Hal, and there was a duel of the eyes between\nthem. A cold anger moved Hal. His ability to endure this sort of thing\nwas at an end. \"Mr. Cartwright,\" he said, \"you are the servant of one of\nthe world's greatest actors; and you support him ably.\"\n\nThe other flushed and drew back; Edward put in quickly: \"Hal, there's\nnothing to be gained by such talk!\"\n\n\"He has all the world for an audience,\" persisted Hal. \"He plays the\nmost stupendous farce--and he and all his actors wearing such solemn\nfaces!\"\n\n\"Mr. Cartwright,\" said Edward, with dignity, \"I trust you understand\nthat I have done everything I can to restrain my brother.\"\n\n\"Of course, Mr. Warner,\" replied the superintendent. \"And you must know\nthat I, for my part, have done everything to show your brother\nconsideration.\"\n\n\"Again!\" exclaimed Hal. \"This actor is a genius!\"\n\n\"Hal, if you have business with Mr. Cartwright--\"\n\n\"He showed me consideration by sending his gunmen to seize me at night,\ndrag me out of a cabin, and nearly twist the arm off me! Such humour\nnever was!\"\n\nCartwright attempted to speak--but looking at Edward, not at Hal. \"At\nthat time--\"\n\n\"He showed me consideration by having me locked up in jail and fed on\nbread and water for two nights and a day! Can you beat that humour?\"\n\n\"At that time I did not know--\"\n\n\"By forging my name to a letter and having it circulated in the camp!\nFinally--most considerate of all--by telling a newspaper man that I had\nseduced a girl here!\"\n\nThe superintendent flushed still redder. \"_No!_\" he declared.\n\n\"_What?_\" cried Hal. \"You didn't tell Billy Keating of the _Gazette_\nthat I had seduced a girl in North Valley? You didn't describe the girl\nto him--a red-haired Irish girl?\"\n\n\"I merely said, Mr. Warner, that I had heard certain rumours--\"\n\n\"_Certain_ rumours, Mr. Cartwright? The certainty was all of your\nmaking! You made a definite and explicit statement to Mr. Keating--\"\n\n\"I did not!\" declared the other.\n\n\"I'll soon prove it!\" And Hal started towards the telephone on\nCartwright's desk.\n\n\"What are you going to do, Hal?\"\n\n\"I am going to get Billy Keating on the wire, and let you hear his\nstatement.\"\n\n\"Oh, rot, Hal!\" cried Edward. \"I don't care anything about Keating's\nstatement. You know that at that time Mr. Cartwright had no means of\nknowing who you were.\"\n\nCartwright was quick to grasp this support. \"Of course not, Mr. Warner!\nYour brother came here, pretending to be a working boy--\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Hal. \"So that's it! You think it proper to circulate\nslanders about working boys in your camp?\"\n\n\"You have been here long enough to know what the morals of such boys\nare.\"\n\n\"I have been here long enough, Mr. Cartwright, to know that if you want\nto go into the question of morals in North Valley, the place for you to\nbegin is with the bosses and guards you put in authority, and allow to\nprey upon women.\"\n\nEdward broke in: \"Hal, there's nothing to be gained by pursuing this\nconversation. If you have any business here, get it over with, for God's\nsake!\"\n\nHal made an effort to recover his self-possession. He came back to the\ndemands of the strike--but only to find that he had used up the\nsuperintendent's self-possession. \"I have given you my answer,\" declared\nCartwright, \"I absolutely decline any further discussion.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Hal, \"since you decline to permit a deputation of your men\nto deal with you in plain, business-like fashion, I have to inform you\nas an individual that every other individual in your camp refuses to\nwork for you.\"\n\nThe superintendent did not let himself be impressed by this elaborate\nsarcasm. \"All I have to tell you, sir, is that Number Two mine will\nresume work in the morning, and that any one who refuses to work will be\nsent down the canyon before night.\"\n\n\"So quickly, Mr. Cartwright? They have rented their homes from the\ncompany, and you know that according to the company's own lease they are\nentitled to three days' notice before being evicted!\"\n\nCartwright was so unwise as to argue. He knew that Edward was hearing,\nand he wished to clear himself. \"They will not be evicted by the\ncompany. They will be dealt with by the town authorities.\"\n\n\"Of which you yourself are the head?\"\n\n\"I happen to have been elected mayor of North Valley.\"\n\n\"As mayor of North Valley, you gave my brother to understand that you\nwould put me out, did you not?\"\n\n\"I asked your brother to persuade you to leave.\"\n\n\"But you made clear that if he could not do this, you would put me out?\"\n\n\"Yes, that is true.\"\n\n\"And the reason you gave was that you had had instructions by telegraph\nfrom Mr. Peter Harrigan. May I ask to what office Mr. Harrigan has been\nelected in your town?\"\n\nCartwright saw his difficulty. \"Your brother misunderstood me,\" he said,\ncrossly.\n\n\"Did you misunderstand him, Edward?\"\n\nEdward had walked to the window in disgust; he was looking at\ntomato-cans and cinder-heaps, and did not see fit to turn around. But\nthe superintendent knew that he was hearing, and considered it necessary\nto cover the flaw in his argument. \"Young man,\" said he, \"you have\nviolated several of the ordinances of this town.\"\n\n\"Is there an ordinance against organising a union of the miners?\"\n\n\"No; but there is one against speaking on the streets.\"\n\n\"Who passed that ordinance, if I may ask?\"\n\n\"The town council.\"\n\n\"Consisting of Johnson, postmaster and company-store clerk; Ellison,\ncompany book-keeper; Strauss, company pit-boss; O'Callahan, company\nsaloon-keeper. Have I the list correct?\"\n\nCartwright did not answer.\n\n\"And the fifth member of the town council is yourself, ex-officio--Mr.\nEnos Cartwright, mayor and company-superintendent.\"\n\nAgain there was no answer.\n\n\"You have an ordinance against street-speaking; and at the same time\nyour company owns the saloon-buildings, the boarding-houses, the church\nand the school. Where do you expect the citizens to do their speaking?\"\n\n\"You would make a good lawyer, young man. But we who have charge here\nknow perfectly well what you mean by 'speaking'!\"\n\n\"You don't approve, then, of the citizens holding meetings?\"\n\n\"I mean that we don't consider it necessary to provide agitators with\nopportunity to incite our employ\u00c3\u00a9s.\"\n\n\"May I ask, Mr. Cartwright, are you speaking as mayor of an American\ncommunity, or as superintendent of a coal-mine?\"\n\nCartwright's face had been growing continually redder. Addressing\nEdward's back, he said, \"I don't see any reason why this should\ncontinue.\"\n\nAnd Edward was of the same opinion. He turned. \"Really, Hal--\"\n\n\"But, Edward! A man accuses your brother of being a law-breaker! Have\nyou hitherto known of any criminal tendencies in our family?\"\n\nEdward turned to the window again and resumed his study of the\ncinder-heaps and tomato-cans. It was a vulgar and stupid quarrel, but he\nhad seen enough of Hal's mood to realise that he would go on and on, so\nlong as any one was indiscreet enough to answer him.\n\n\"You say, Mr. Cartwright, that I have violated the ordinance against\nspeaking on the street. May I ask what penalty this ordinance carries?\"\n\n\"You will find out when the penalty is exacted of you.\"\n\nHal laughed. \"From what you said just now, I gather that the penalty is\nexpulsion from the town! If I understand legal procedure, I should have\nbeen brought before the justice of the peace--who happens to be another\ncompany store-clerk. Instead of that, I am sentenced by the mayor--or is\nit the company superintendent? May I ask how that comes to be?\"\n\n\"It is because of my consideration--\"\n\n\"When did I ask consideration?\"\n\n\"Consideration for your brother, I mean.\"\n\n\"Oh! Then your ordinance provides that the mayor--or is it the\nsuperintendent?--may show consideration for the brother of a\nlaw-breaker, by changing his penalty to expulsion from the town. Was it\nconsideration for Tommie Burke that caused you to have his sister sent\ndown the canyon?\"\n\nCartwright clenched his hands. \"I've had all I'll stand of this!\"\n\nHe was again addressing Edward's back; and Edward turned and answered,\n\"I don't blame you, sir.\" Then to Hal, \"I really think you've said\nenough!\"\n\n\"I hope I've said enough,\" replied Hal--\"to convince you that the\npretence of American law in this coal-camp is a silly farce, an insult\nand a humiliation to any man who respects the institutions of his\ncountry.\"\n\n\"You, Mr. Warner,\" said the superintendent, to Edward, \"have had\nexperience in managing coal-mines. You know what it means to deal with\nignorant foreigners, who have no understanding of American law--\"\n\nHal burst out laughing. \"So you're teaching them American law! You're\nteaching them by setting at naught every law of your town and state,\nevery constitutional guarantee--and substituting the instructions you\nget by telegraph from Peter Harrigan!\"\n\nCartwright turned and walked to the door. \"Young man,\" said he, over his\nshoulder, \"it will be necessary for you to leave North Valley this\nmorning. I only hope your brother will be able to persuade you to leave\nwithout trouble.\" And the bang of the door behind him was the\nsuperintendent's only farewell.\n\n\n\nSECTION 17.\n\nEdward turned upon his brother. \"Now what the devil did you want to put\nme through a scene like that for? So undignified! So utterly uncalled\nfor! A quarrel with a man so far beneath you!\"\n\nHal stood where the superintendent had left him. He was looking at his\nbrother's angry face. \"Was that all you got out of it, Edward?\"\n\n\"All that stuff about your private character! What do you care what a\nfellow like Cartwright thinks about you?\"\n\n\"I care nothing at all what he thinks, but I care about having him use\nsuch a slander. That's one of their regular procedures, so Billy Keating\nsays.\"\n\nEdward answered, coldly, \"Take my advice, and realise that when you deny\na scandal, you only give it circulation.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" answered Hal. \"That's what makes me so angry. Think of the\ngirl, the harm done to her!\"\n\n\"It's not up to you to worry about the girl.\"\n\n\"Suppose that Cartwright had slandered some woman friend of yours. Would\nyou have felt the same indifference?\"\n\n\"He'd not have slandered any friend of mine; I choose my friends more\ncarefully.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course. What that means is that you choose them among the rich.\nBut I happen to be more democratic in my tastes--\"\n\n\"Oh, for heaven's sake!\" cried Edward. \"You reformers are all alike--you\ntalk and talk and talk!\"\n\n\"I can tell you the reason for that, Edward--a man like you can shut his\neyes, but he can't shut his ears!\"\n\n\"Well, can't you let up on me for awhile--long enough to get out of this\nplace? I feel as if I were sitting on the top of a volcano, and I've no\nidea when it may break out again.\"\n\nHal began to laugh. \"All right,\" he said; \"I guess I haven't shown much\nappreciation of your visit. I'll be more sociable now. My next business\nis in Pedro, so I'll go that far with you. There's one thing more--\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"The company owes me money--\"\n\n\"What money?\"\n\n\"Some I've earned.\"\n\nIt was Edward's turn to laugh. \"Enough to buy you a shave and a bath?\"\n\nHe took out his wallet, and pulled off several bills; and Hal, watching\nhim, realised suddenly a change which had taken place in his own\npsychology. Not merely had he acquired the class-consciousness of the\nworking-man, he had acquired the money-consciousness as well. He was\nactually concerned about the dollars the company owed him! He had earned\nthose dollars by back- and heart-breaking toil, lifting lumps of coal\ninto cars; the sum was enough to keep the whole Rafferty family alive\nfor a week or two. And here was Edward, with a smooth brown leather\nwallet full of ten- and twenty-dollar bills, which he peeled off without\ncounting, exactly as if money grew on trees, or as if coal came out of\nthe earth and walked into furnaces to the sound of a fiddle and a flute!\n\nEdward had of course no idea of these abnormal processes going on in his\nbrother's mind. He was holding out the bills. \"Get yourself some decent\nthings,\" he said. \"I hope you don't have to stay dirty in order to feel\ndemocratic?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Hal; and then, \"How are we going?\"\n\n\"I've a car waiting, back of the office.\"\n\n\"So you had everything ready!\" But Edward made no answer; afraid of\nsetting off the volcano again.\n\n\n\nSECTION 18.\n\nThey went out by the rear door of the office, entered the car, and sped\nout of the village, unseen by the crowd. And all the way down the canyon\nEdward pleaded with Hal to drop the controversy and come home at once.\nHe brought up the tragic question of Dad again; when that did not avail,\nhe began to threaten. Suppose Hal's money-resources were to be cut off,\nsuppose he were to find himself left out of his father's will--what\nwould he do then? Hal answered, without a smile, \"I can always get a job\nas organiser for the United Mine-Workers.\"\n\nSo Edward gave up that line of attack. \"If you won't come,\" he declared,\n\"I'm going to stay by you till you do!\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Hal. He could not help smiling at this dire threat.\n\"But if I take you about and introduce you to my friends, you must agree\nthat what you hear shall be confidential.\"\n\nThe other made a face of disgust. \"What the devil would I want to talk\nabout your friends for?\"\n\n\"I don't know what might happen,\" said Hal. \"You're going to meet Peter\nHarrigan and take his side, and I can't tell what you might conceive it\nyour duty to do.\"\n\nThe other exclaimed, with sudden passion, \"I'll tell you right now! If\nyou try to go back to that coal-camp, I swear to God I'll apply to the\ncourts and have you shut up in a sanitarium. I don't think I'd have much\ntrouble in persuading a judge that you're insane.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Hal, with a laugh--\"not a judge in this part of the world!\"\n\nThen, after studying his brother's face for a moment, it occurred to him\nthat it might be well not to let such an idea rest unimpeached in\nEdward's mind. \"Wait,\" said he, \"till you meet my friend Billy Keating,\nof the _Gazette_, and hear what he would do with such a story! Billy is\ncrazy to have me turn him loose to 'play up' my fight with Old Peter!\"\nThe conversation went no farther--but Hal was sure that Edward would\n\"put that in his pipe and smoke it.\"\n\nThey came to the MacKellar home in Pedro, and Edward waited in the\nautomobile while Hal went inside. The old Scotchman welcomed him warmly,\nand told him what news he had. Jerry Minetti had been there that\nmorning, and MacKellar at his request had telephoned to the office of\nthe union in Sheridan, and ascertained that Jack David had brought word\nabout the strike on the previous evening. All parties had been careful\nnot to mention names, for \"leaks\" in the telephone were notorious, but\nit was clear who the messenger had been. As a result of the message,\nJohann Hartman, president of the local union of the miners, was now at\nthe American Hotel in Pedro, together with James Moylan, secretary of\nthe district organisation--the latter having come down from Western City\non the same train as Edward.\n\nThis was all satisfactory; but MacKellar added a bit of information of\ndesperate import--the officers of the union declared that they could not\nsupport a strike at the present time! It was premature, it could lead to\nnothing but failure and discouragement to the larger movement they were\nplanning.\n\nSuch a possibility Hal had himself realised at the outset. But he had\nwitnessed the new birth of freedom at North Valley, he had seen the\nhungry, toil-worn faces of men looking up to him for support; he had\nbeen moved by it, and had come to feel that the union officials must be\nmoved in the same way. \"They've simply got to back it!\" he exclaimed.\n\"Those men must not be disappointed! They'll lose all hope, they'll sink\ninto utter despair! The labour men must realise that--I must make them!\"\n\nThe old Scotchman answered that Minetti had felt the same way. He had\nflung caution to the winds, and rushed over to the hotel to see Hartman\nand Moylan. Hal decided to follow, and went out to the automobile.\n\nHe explained matters to his brother, whose comment was, Of course! It\nwas what he had foretold. The poor, mis-guided miners would go back to\ntheir work, and their would-be leader would have to admit the folly of\nhis course. There was a train for Western City in a couple of hours; it\nwould be a great favour if Hal would arrange to take it.\n\nHal answered shortly that he was going to the American Hotel. His\nbrother might take him there, if he chose. So Edward gave the order to\nthe driver of the car. Incidentally, Edward began asking about\nclothing-stores in Pedro. While Hal was in the hotel, pleading for the\nlife of his newly-born labour union, Edward would seek a costume in\nwhich he could \"feel like a human being.\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 19.\n\nHal found Jerry Minetti with the two officials in their hotel-room: Jim\nMoylan, district secretary, a long, towering Irish boy, black-eyed and\nblack-haired, quick and sensitive, the sort of person one trusted and\nliked at the first moment; and Johann Hartman, local president, a\ngrey-haired miner of German birth, reserved and slow-spoken, evidently a\nman of much strength, both physical and moral. He had need of it, any\none could realise, having charge of a union headquarters in the heart of\nthis \"Empire of Raymond\"!\n\nHal first told of the kidnapping of the committee. This did not surprise\nthe officials, he found; it was the thing the companies regularly did\nwhen there was threat of rebellion in the camps. That was why efforts to\norganise openly were so utterly hopeless. There was no chance for\nanything but a secret propaganda, maintained until every camp had the\nnucleus of an organisation.\n\n\"So you can't back this strike!\" exclaimed Hal.\n\nNot possibly, was Moylan's reply. It would be lost as soon as it was\nbegun. There was no slightest hope of success until a lot of\norganisation work had been done.\n\n\"But meantime,\" argued Hal, \"the union at North Valley will go to\npieces!\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" was the reply. \"We'll only have to start another. That's what\nthe labour movement is like.\"\n\nJim Moylan was young, and saw Hal's mood. \"Don't misunderstand us!\" he\ncried. \"It's heartbreaking--but it's not in our power to help. We are\ncharged with building up the union, and we know that if we supported\neverything that looked like a strike, we'd be bankrupt the first year.\nYou can't imagine how often this same thing happens--hardly a month\nwe're not called on to handle such a situation.\"\n\n\"I can see what you mean,\" said Hal. \"But I thought that in this case,\nright after the disaster, with the men so stirred--\"\n\nThe young Irishman smiled, rather sadly. \"You're new at this game,\" he\nsaid. \"If a mine-disaster was enough to win a strike, God knows our job\nwould be easy. In Barela, just down the canyon from you, they've had\nthree big explosions--they've killed over five hundred men in the past\nyear!\"\n\nHal began to see how, in his inexperience, he had lost his sense of\nproportion.\n\nHe looked at the two labour leaders, and recalled the picture of such a\nperson which he had brought with him to North Valley--a hot headed and\nfiery agitator, luring honest workingmen from their jobs. But here was\nthe situation exactly reversed! Here was he in a blaze of\nexcitement--and two labour leaders turning the fire-hose on him! They\nsat quiet and business-like, pronouncing a doom upon the slaves of North\nValley. Back to their black dungeons with them!\n\n\"What can we tell the men?\" he asked, making an effort to repress his\nchagrin.\n\n\"We can only tell them what I'm telling you--that we're helpless, till\nwe've got the whole district organised. Meantime, they have to stand the\ngaff; they must do what they can to keep an organisation.\"\n\n\"But all the active men will be fired!\"\n\n\"No, not quite all--they seldom get them all.\"\n\nHere the stolid old German put in. In the last year the company had\nturned out more than six thousand men because of union activity or\nsuspicion of it.\n\n\"_Six thousand!_\" echoed Hal. \"You mean from this one district?\"\n\n\"That's what I mean.\"\n\n\"But there aren't more than twelve or fifteen thousand men in the\ndistrict!\"\n\n\"I know that.\"\n\n\"Then how can you ever keep an organisation?\"\n\nThe other answered, quietly, \"They treat the new men the same as they\ntreated the old.\"\n\nHal thought suddenly of John Edstrom's ants! Here they were--building\ntheir bridge, building it again and again, as often as floods might\ndestroy it! They had not the swift impatience of a youth of the\nleisure-class, accustomed to having his own way, accustomed to thinking\nof freedom and decency and justice as necessities of life. Much as Hal\nlearned from the conversation of these men, he learned more from their\nsilences--the quiet, matter-of-fact way they took things which had\ndriven him beside himself with indignation. He began to realise what it\nwould mean to stand by his pledge to those poor devils in North Valley.\nHe would need more than one blaze of excitement; he would need brains\nand patience and discipline, he would need years of study and hard work!\n\n\n\nSECTION 20.\n\nHal found himself forced to accept the decision of the labour-leaders.\nThey had had experience, they could judge the situation. The miners\nwould have to go back to work, and Cartwright and Alec Stone and Jeff\nCotton would drive them as before! All that the rebels could do was to\ntry to keep a secret organisation in the camp.\n\nJerry Minetti mentioned Jack David. He had gone back this morning,\nwithout having seen the labour-leaders. So he might escape suspicion,\nand keep his job, and help the union work.\n\n\"How about you?\" asked Hal. \"I suppose you've cooked your goose.\"\n\nJerry had never heard this phrase, but he got its meaning. \"Sure thing!\"\nsaid he. \"Cooked him plenty!\"\n\n\"Didn't you see the 'dicks' down stairs in the lobby?\" inquired Hartman.\n\n\"I haven't learned to recognise them yet.\"\n\n\"Well, you will, if you stay at this business. There hasn't been a\nminute since our office was opened that we haven't had half a dozen on\nthe other side of the street. Every man that comes to see us is followed\nback to his camp and fired that same day. They've broken into my desk at\nnight and stolen my letters and papers; they've threatened us with death\na hundred times.\"\n\n\"I don't see how you make any headway at all!\"\n\n\"They can never stop us. They thought when they broke into my desk,\nthey'd get a list of our organisers. But you see, I carry the lists in\nmy head!\"\n\n\"No small task, either,\" put in Moylan. \"Would you like to know how many\norganisers we have at work? Ninety-seven. And they haven't caught a\nsingle one of them!\"\n\nHal heard him, amazed. Here was a new aspect of the labour movement!\nThis quiet, resolute old \"Dutchy,\" whom you might have taken for a\ndelicatessen-proprietor; this merry-eyed Irish boy, whom you would have\nexpected to be escorting a lady to a firemen's ball----they were\ncaptains of an army of sappers who were undermining the towers of Peter\nHarrigan's fortress of greed!\n\nHartman suggested that Jerry might take a chance at this sort of work.\nHe would surely be fired from North Valley, so he might as well send\nword to his family to come to Pedro. In this way he might save himself\nto work as an organiser; because it was the custom of these company\n\"spotters\" to follow a man back to his camp and there identify him. If\nJerry took a train for Western City, they would be thrown off the track,\nand he might get into some new camp and do organising among the\nItalians. Jerry accepted this proposition with alacrity; it would put\noff the evil day when Rosa and her little ones would be left to the\nmercy of chance.\n\nThey were still talking when the telephone rang. It was Hartman's\nsecretary in Sheridan, reporting that he had just heard from the\nkidnapped committee. The entire party, eight men and Mary Burke, had\nbeen taken to Horton, a station not far up the line, and put on the\ntrain with many dire threats. But they had left the train at the next\nstop, and declared their intention of coming to Pedro. They were due at\nthe hotel very soon.\n\nHal desired to be present at this meeting, and went downstairs to tell\nhis brother. There was another dispute, of course. Edward reminded Hal\nthat the scenery of Pedro had a tendency to monotony; to which Hal could\nonly answer by offering to introduce his brother to his friends. They\nwere men who could teach Edward much, if he would consent to learn. He\nmight attend the session with the committee--eight men and a woman who\nhad ventured an act of heroism and been made the victims of a crime. Nor\nwere they bores, as Edward might be thinking! There was blue-eyed Tim\nRafferty, for example, a silent, smutty-faced gnome who had broken out\nof his black cavern and spread unexpected golden wings of oratory; and\nMary Burke, of whom Edward might read in that afternoon's edition of the\nWestern City _Gazette_--a \"Joan of Arc of the coal-camps,\" or something\nequally picturesque. But Edward's mood was not to be enlivened. He had a\nvision of his brother's appearance in the paper as the companion of this\nHibernian Joan!\n\nHal went off with Jerry Minetti to what his brother described as a\n\"hash-house,\" while Edward proceeded in solitary state to the\ndining-room of the American Hotel. But he was not left in solitary\nstate; pretty soon a sharp-faced young man was ushered to a seat beside\nhim, and started up a conversation. He was a \"drummer,\" he said; his\n\"line\" was hardware, what was Edward's? Edward answered coldly that he\nhad no \"line,\" but the young man was not rebuffed--apparently his \"line\"\nhad hardened his sensibilities. Perhaps Edward was interested in\ncoal-mines? Had he been visiting the camps? He questioned so\npersistently, and came back so often to the subject, that at last it\ndawned over Edward what this meant--he was receiving the attention of a\n\"spotter!\" Strange to say, the circumstance caused Edward more\nirritation against Peter Harrigan's regime than all his brother's\neloquence about oppression at North Valley.\n\n\n\nSECTION 21.\n\nSoon after dinner the kidnapped committee arrived, bedraggled in body\nand weary in soul. They inquired for Johann Hartman, and were sent up to\nthe room, where there followed a painful scene. Eight men and a woman\nwho had ventured an act of heroism and been made the victims of a crime\ncould not easily be persuaded to see their efforts and sacrifices thrown\non the dump-heap, nor were they timid in expressing their opinions of\nthose who were betraying them.\n\n\"You been tryin' to get us out!\" cried Tim Rafferty. \"Ever since I can\nremember you been at my old man to help you--an' here, when we do what\nyou ask, you throw us down!\"\n\n\"We never asked you to go on strike,\" said Moylan.\n\n\"No, that's true. You only asked us to pay dues, so you fellows could\nhave fat salaries.\"\n\n\"Our salaries aren't very fat,\" replied the young leader, patiently.\n\"You'd find that out if you investigated.\"\n\n\"Well, whatever they are, they go on, while ours stop. We're on the\nstreets, we're done for. Look at us--and most of us has got families,\ntoo! I got an old mother an' a lot of brothers and sisters, an' my old\nman done up an' can't work. What do you think's to become of us?\"\n\n\"We'll help you out a little, Rafferty--\"\n\n\"To hell with you!\" cried Tim. \"I don't want your help! When I need\ncharity, I'll go to the county. They're another bunch of grafters, but\nthey don't pretend to be friends to the workin' man.\"\n\nHere was the thing Tom Olson had told Hal at the outset--the workingmen\nbedevilled, not knowing whom to trust, suspecting the very people who\nmost desired to help them. \"Tim,\" he put in, \"there's no use talking\nlike that. We have to learn patience--\"\n\nAnd the boy turned upon Hal. \"What do you know about it? It's all a joke\nto you. You can go off and forget it when you get ready. You've got\nmoney, they tell me!\"\n\nHal felt no resentment at this; it was what he heard from his own\nconscience. \"It isn't so easy for me as you think, Tim. There are other\nways of suffering besides not having money--\"\n\n\"Much sufferin' you'll do--with your rich folks!\" sneered Tim.\n\nThere was a murmur of protest from others of the committee.\n\n\"Good God, Rafferty!\" broke in Moylan. \"We can't help it, man--we're\njust as helpless as you!\"\n\n\"You say you're helpless--but you don't even try!\"\n\n\"_Try?_ Do you want us to back a strike that we know hasn't a chance?\nYou might as well ask us to lie down and let a load of coal run over us.\nWe can't win, man! I tell you we can't _win_! We'd only be throwing away\nour organisation!\"\n\nMoylan became suddenly impassioned. He had seen a dozen sporadic strikes\nin this district, and many a dozen young strikers, homeless, desolate,\nembittered, turning their disappointment on him. \"We might support you\nwith our funds, you say--we might go on doing it, even while the company\nran the mine with scabs. But where would that land us, Rafferty? I seen\nmany a union on the rocks--and I ain't so old either! If we had a bank,\nwe'd support all the miners of the country, they'd never need to work\nagain till they got their rights. But this money we spend is the money\nthat other miners are earnin'--right now, down in the pits, Rafferty,\nthe same as you and your old man. They give us this money, and they say,\n'Use it to build up the union. Use it to help the men that aren't\norganised--take them in, so they won't beat down our wages and scab on\nus. But don't waste it, for God's sake; we have to work hard to make it,\nand if we don't see results, you'll get no more out of us.' Don't you\nsee how that is, man? And how it weighs on us, worse even then the fear\nthat maybe we'll lose our poor salaries--though you might refuse to\nbelieve anything so good of us? You don't need to talk to me like I was\nPeter Harrigan's son. I was a spragger when I was ten years old, and I\nain't been out of the pits so long that I've forgot the feeling. I\nassure you, the thing that keeps me awake at night ain't the fear of not\ngettin' a living, for I give myself a bit of education, working nights,\nand I know I could always turn out and earn what I need; but it's\nwondering whether I'm spending the miners' money the best way, whether\nmaybe I mightn't save them a little misery if I hadn't 'a' done this or\nhad 'a' done that. When I come down on that sleeper last night, here's\nwhat I was thinking, Tim Rafferty--all the time I listened to the train\nbumping--'Now I got to see some more of the suffering, I got to let some\ngood men turn against us, because they can't see why we should get\nsalaries while they get the sack. How am I going to show them that I'm\nworking for them--working as hard as I know how--and that I'm not to\nblame for their trouble?'\"\n\nHere Wauchope broke in. \"There's no use talking any more. I see we're up\nagainst it. We'll not trouble you, Moylan.\"\n\n\"You trouble me,\" cried Moylan, \"unless you stand by the movement!\"\n\nThe other laughed bitterly. \"You'll never know what I do. It's the road\nfor me--and you know it!\"\n\n\"Well, wherever you go, it'll be the same; either you'll be fighting for\nthe union, or you'll be a weight that we have to carry.\"\n\nThe young leader turned from one to another of the committee, pleading\nwith them not to be embittered by this failure, but to turn it to their\nprofit, going on with the work of building up the solidarity of the\nminers. Every man had to make his sacrifices, to pay his part of the\nprice. The thing of importance was that every man who was discharged\nshould be a spark of unionism, carrying the flame of revolt to a new\npart of the country. Let each one do his part, and there would soon be\nno place to which the masters could send for \"scabs.\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 22.\n\nThere was one member of this committee whom Hal watched with especial\nanxiety----Mary Burke. She had not yet said a word; while the others\nargued and protested, she sat with her lips set and her hands clenched.\nHal knew what rage this failure must bring to her. She had risen and\nstruggled and hoped, and the result was what she had always said it\nwould be--nothing! Now he saw her, with eyes large and dark with\nfatigue, fixed on this fiery young labour-leader. He knew that a war\nmust be going on within her. Would she drop out entirely now? It was the\ntest of her character--as it was the test of the characters of all of\nthem.\n\n\"If only we're strong enough and brave enough,\" Jim Moylan was saying,\n\"we can use our defeats to educate our people and bring them together.\nRight now, if we can make the men at North Valley see what we're doing,\nthey won't go back beaten, they won't be bitter against the union,\nthey'll only go back to wait. And ain't that a way to beat the\nbosses--to hold our jobs, and keep the union alive, till we've got into\nall the camps, and can strike and win?\"\n\nThere was a pause; then Mary spoke. \"How're you meanin' to tell the\nmen?\" Her voice was without emotion, but nevertheless, Hal's heart\nleaped. Whether Mary had any hope or not, she was going to stay in line\nwith the rest of the ants!\n\nJohann Hartman explained his idea. He would have circulars printed in\nseveral languages and distributed secretly in the camp, ordering the men\nback to work. But Jerry met this suggestion with a prompt no. The people\nwould not believe the circulars, they would suspect the bosses of having\nthem printed. Hadn't the bosses done worse than that, \"framing up\" a\nletter from Joe Smith to balk the check-weighman movement? The only\nthing that would help would be for some of the committee to get into the\ncamp and see the men face to face.\n\n\"And it got to be quick!\" Jerry insisted. \"They get notice to work in\nmorning, and them that don't be fired. They be the best men, too--men we\nwant to save.\"\n\nOther members of the committee spoke up, agreeing with this. Said\nRusick, the Slav, slow-witted and slow-spoken, \"Them fellers get mighty\ndamn sore if they lose their job and don't got no strike.\" And Zammakis,\nthe Greek, quick and nervous, \"We say strike; we got to say no strike.\"\n\nWhat could they do? There was, in the first place, the difficulty of\ngetting away from the hotel, which was being watched by the \"spotters.\"\nHartman suggested that if they went out all together and scattered, the\ndetectives could not follow all of them. Those who escaped might get\ninto North Valley by hiding in the \"empties\" which went up to the mine.\n\nBut Moylan pointed out that the company would be anticipating this; and\nRusick, who had once been a hobo, put in: \"They sure search them cars.\nThey give us plenty hell, too, when they catch us.\"\n\nYes, it would be a dangerous mission. Mary spoke again. \"Maybe a lady\ncould do it better.\"\n\n\"They'd beat a lady,\" said Minetti.\n\n\"I know, but maybe a lady might fool them. There's some widows that came\nto Pedro for the funerals, and they're wearin' veils that hide their\nfaces. I might pretend to be one of them and get into the camp.\"\n\nThe men looked at one another. There was an idea! The scowl which had\nstayed upon the face of Tim Rafferty ever since his quarrel with Moylan,\ngave place suddenly to a broad grin.\n\n\"I seen Mrs. Zamboni on the street,\" said he. \"She had on black veils\nenough to hide the lot of us.\"\n\nAnd here Hal spoke, for the first time since Tim Rafferty had silenced\nhim. \"Does anybody know where to find Mrs. Zamboni?\"\n\n\"She stay with my friend, Mrs. Swajka,\" said Rusick.\n\n\"Well,\" said Hal, \"there's something you people don't know about this\nsituation. After they had fired you, I made another speech to the men,\nand made them swear they'd stay on strike. So now I've got to go back\nand eat my words. If we're relying on veils and things, a man can be\nfixed up as well as a woman.\"\n\nThey were staring at him. \"They'll beat you to death if they catch you!\"\nsaid Wauchope.\n\n\"No,\" said Hal, \"I don't think so. Anyhow, it's up to me\"--he glanced at\nTim Rafferty--\"because I'm the only one who doesn't have to suffer for\nthe failure of our strike.\"\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\"I'm sorry I said that!\" cried Tim, impulsively.\n\n\"That's all right, old man,\" replied Hal. \"What you said is true, and\nI'd like to do something to ease my conscience.\" He rose to his feet,\nlaughing. \"I'll make a peach of a widow!\" he said. \"I'm going up and\nhave a tea-party with my friend Jeff Cotton!\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 23.\n\nHal proposed going to find Mrs. Zamboni at the place where she was\nstaying; but Moylan interposed, objecting that the detectives would\nsurely follow him. Even though they should all go out of the hotel at\nonce, the one person the detective would surely stick to was the\narch-rebel and trouble-maker, Joe Smith. Finally they decided to bring\nMrs. Zamboni to the room. Let her come with Mrs. Swajka or some other\nwoman who spoke English, and go to the desk and ask for Mary Burke,\nexplaining that Mary had borrowed money from her, and that she had to\nhave it to pay the undertaker for the burial of her man. The hotel-clerk\nmight not know who Mary Burke was; but the watchful \"spotters\" would\ngather about and listen, and if it was mentioned that Mary was from\nNorth Valley, some one would connect her with the kidnapped committee.\n\nThis was made clear to Rusick, who hurried off, and in the course of\nhalf an hour returned with the announcement that the women were on the\nway. A few minutes later came a tap on the door, and there stood the\nblack-garbed old widow with her friend. She came in; and then came looks\nof dismay and horrified exclamations. Rusick was requesting her to give\nup her weeds to Joe Smith!\n\n\"She say she don't got nothing else,\" explained the Slav.\n\n\"Tell her I give her plenty money buy more,\" said Hal.\n\n\"Ai! Jesu!\" cried Mrs. Zamboni, pouring out a sputtering torrent.\n\n\"She say she don't got nothing to put on. She say it ain't good to go no\nclothes!\"\n\n\"Hasn't she got on a petticoat?\"\n\n\"She say petticoat got holes!\"\n\nThere was a burst of laughter from the company, and the old woman turned\nscarlet from her forehead to her ample throat. \"Tell her she wrap up in\nblankets,\" said Hal. \"Mary Burke buy her new things.\"\n\nIt proved surprisingly difficult to separate Mrs. Zamboni from her\nwidow's weeds, which she had purchased with so great an expenditure of\ntime and tears. Never had a respectable lady who had borne sixteen\nchildren received such a proposition; to sell the insignia of her\ngrief--and here in a hotel room, crowded with a dozen men! Nor was the\ntask made easier by the unseemly merriment of the men. \"Ai! Jesu!\" cried\nMrs. Zamboni again.\n\n\"Tell her it's very, very important,\" said Hal. \"Tell her I must have\nthem.\" And then, seeing that Rusick was making poor headway, he joined\nin, in the compromise-English one learns in the camps. \"Got to have!\nSure thing! Got to hide! Quick! Get away from boss! See? Get killed if\nno go!\"\n\nSo at last the frightened old woman gave way. \"She say all turn backs,\"\nsaid Rusick. And everybody turned, laughing in hilarious whispers,\nwhile, with Mary Burke and Mrs. Swajka for a shield, Mrs. Zamboni got\nout of her waist and skirt, putting a blanket round her red shoulders\nfor modesty's sake. When Hal put the garments on, there was a foot to\nspare all round; but after they had stuffed two bed pillows down in the\nfront of him, and drawn them tight at the waist-line, the disguise was\njudged more satisfactory. He put on the old lady's ample if ragged\nshoes, and Mary Burke set the widow's bonnet on his head and adjusted\nthe many veils; after that Mrs. Zamboni's own brood of children would\nnot have suspected the disguise.\n\nIt was a merry party for a few minutes; worn and hopeless as Mary had\nseemed, she was possessed now by the spirit of fun. But then quickly the\nlaughter died. The time for action had come. Mary Burke said that she\nwould stay with what was left of Mrs. Zamboni, to answer the door in\ncase any of the hotel people or the detectives should come. Hal asked\nJim Moylan to see Edward, and say that Hal was writing a manifesto to\nthe North Valley workers, and would not be ready to leave until the\nmidnight train.\n\nThese things agreed upon, Hal shook hands all round, and the eleven men\nleft the room at once, going down stairs and through the lobby,\nscattering in every direction on the streets. Mrs. Swajka and the\npseudo-Mrs. Zamboni followed a minute later--and, as they anticipated,\nfound the lobby swept clear of detectives.\n\n\n\nSECTION 24.\n\nBidding Mrs. Swajka farewell, Hal set out for the railroad station. But\nbefore he had gone a block from the hotel, he ran into his brother,\ncoming straight towards him.\n\nEdward's face wore a bored look; his very manner of carrying the\nmagazine under his arm said that he had selected it in a last hopeless\neffort against the monotony of Pedro. Such a trick of fate, to take a\nman of important affairs, and immure him at the mercy of a maniac in a\nGod-forsaken coal-town! What did people do in such a hole? Pay a nickel\nto look at moving pictures of cow-boys and counterfeiters?\n\nEdward's aspect was too much for Hal's sense of humour. Besides, he had\na good excuse; was it not proper to make a test of his disguise, before\nfacing the real danger in North Valley?\n\nHe placed himself in the path of his brother's progress, and in Mrs.\nZamboni's high, complaining tones, began, \"Mister!\"\n\nEdward stared at the interrupting black figure. \"Mister, you Joe Smith's\nbrother, hey?\"\n\nThe question had to be repeated before Edward gave his grudging answer.\nHe was not proud of the relationship.\n\n\"Mister,\" continued the whining voice, \"my old man got blow up in mine.\nI get five pieces from my man what I got to bury yesterday in\ngrave-yard. I got to pay thirty dollar for bury them pieces and I don't\ngot no more money left. I don't got no money from them company fellers.\nThey come lawyer feller and he say maybe I get money for bury my man, if\nI don't jay too much. But, Mister, I got eleven children I got to feed,\nand I don't got no more man, and I don't find no new man for old woman\nlike me. When I go home I hear them children crying and I don't got no\nfood, and them company-stores don't give me no food. I think maybe you\nJoe Smith's brother you good man, maybe you sorry for poor widow-woman,\nyou maybe give me some money, Mister, so I buy some food for them\nchildren.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Edward. He pulled out his wallet and extracted a bill,\nwhich happened to be for ten dollars. His manner seemed to say, \"For\nheaven's sake, here!\"\n\nMrs. Zamboni clutched the bill with greedy fingers, but was not\nappeased. \"You got plenty money, Mister! You rich man, hey! You maybe\ngive me all them moneys, so I got plenty feed them children? You don't\nknow them company-stores, Mister, them prices is way up high like\nmountains; them children is hungry, they cry all day and night, and one\npiece money don't last so long. You give me some more piece moneys,\nMister----hey?\"\n\n\"I'll give you one more,\" said Edward. \"I need some for myself.\" He\npulled off another bill.\n\n\"What you need so much, Mister? You don't got so many children, hey? And\nyou got plenty more money home, maybe!\"\n\n\"That's all I can give you,\" said the man. He took a step to one side,\nto get round the obstruction in his path.\n\nBut the obstruction took a step also--and with surprising agility.\n\"Mister, I thank you for them moneys. I tell them children I get moneys\nfrom good man. I like you, Mister Smith, you give money for poor\nwidow-woman--you nice man.\"\n\nAnd the dreadful creature actually stuck out one of her paws, as if\nexpecting to pat Edward on the cheek, or to chuck him under the chin. He\nrecoiled, as from a contagion; but she followed him, determined to do\nsomething to him, he could not be sure what. He had heard that these\nforeigners had strange customs!\n\n\"It's all right! It's nothing!\" he insisted, and fell back--at the same\ntime glancing nervously about, to see if there were spectators of this\nscene.\n\n\"Nice man, Mister! Nice man!\" cried the old woman, with increasing\ncordiality. \"Maybe some day I find man like you, Mr. Edward Smith--so I\ndon't stay widow-woman no more. You think maybe you like to marry nice\nSlavish woman, got plenty nice children?\"\n\nEdward, perceiving that the matter was getting desperate, sprang to one\nside. It was a spring which should have carried him to safety; but to\nhis dismay the Slavish widow sprang also--her claws caught him under the\narm-pit, and fastening in his ribs, gave him a ferocious pinch. After\nwhich the owner of the claws went down the street, not looking back, but\nmaking strange gobbling noises, which might have been the weeping of a\nbereaved widow in Slavish, or might have been almost anything else.\n\n\n\nSECTION 25.\n\nThe train up to North Valley left very soon, and Hal figured that there\nwould be just time to accomplish his errand and catch the last train\nback. He took his seat in the car without attracting attention, and sat\nin his place until they were approaching their destination, the last\nstop up the canyon. There were several of the miners' women in the car,\nand Hal picked out one who belonged to Mrs. Zamboni's nationality, and\nmoved over beside her. She made place, with some remark; but Hal merely\nsobbed softly, and the woman felt for his hand to comfort him. As his\nhands were clasped together under the veils, she patted him reassuringly\non the knee.\n\nAt the boundary of the stockaded village the train stopped, and Bud\nAdams came through the car, scrutinising every passenger. Seeing this,\nHal began to sob again, and murmured something indistinct to his\ncompanion--which caused her to lean towards him, speaking volubly in her\nnative language. \"Bud\" passed by.\n\nWhen Hal came to leave the train, he took his companion's arm; he sobbed\nsome more, and she talked some more, and so they went down the platform,\nunder the very eyes of Pete Hanun, the \"breaker of teeth.\" Another woman\njoined them, and they walked down the street, the women conversing in\nSlavish, apparently without a suspicion of Hal.\n\nHe had worked out his plan of action. He would not try to talk with the\nmen secretly--it would take too long, and he might be betrayed before he\nhad talked with a sufficient number. One bold stroke was the thing. In\nhalf an hour it would be supper-time, and the feeders would gather in\nReminitsky's dining-room. He would give his message there!\n\nHal's two companions were puzzled that he passed the Zamboni cabin,\nwhere presumably the Zamboni brood were being cared for by neighbours.\nBut he let them make what they could of this, and went on to the Minetti\nhome. To the astonished Rosa he revealed himself, and gave her husband's\nmessage--that she should take herself and the children down to Pedro,\nand wait quietly until she heard from him. She hurried out and brought\nin Jack David, to whom Hal explained matters. \"Big Jack's\" part in the\nrecent disturbance had apparently not been suspected; he and his wife,\nwith Rovetta, Wresmak, and Klowoski, would remain as a nucleus through\nwhich the union could work upon the men.\n\nThe supper-hour was at hand, and the pseudo-Mrs. Zamboni emerged and\ntoddled down the street. As she passed into the dining-room of the\nboarding-house, men looked at her, but no one spoke. It was the stage of\nthe meal where everybody was grabbing and devouring, in the effort to\nget the best of his grabbing and devouring neighbours. The black-clad\nfigure went to the far end of the room; there was a vacant chair, and\nthe figure pulled it back from the table and climbed upon it. Then a\nshout rang through the room: \"Boys! Boys!\"\n\nThe feeders looked up, and saw the widow's weeds thrown back, and their\nleader, Joe Smith, gazing out at them. \"Boys! I've come with a message\nfrom the union!\"\n\nThere was a yell; men leaped to their feet, chairs were flung back,\nfalling with a crash to the floor. Then, almost instantly, came silence;\nyou could have heard the movement of any man's jaws, had any man\ncontinued to move them.\n\n\"Boys! I've been down to Pedro and seen the union people. I knew the\nbosses wouldn't let me come back, so I dressed up, and here I am!\"\n\nIt dawned upon them, the meaning of this fantastic costume; there were\ncheers, laughter, yells of delight.\n\nBut Hal stretched out his hands, and silence fell again. \"Listen to me!\nThe bosses won't let me talk long, and I've something important to say.\nThe union leaders say we can't win a strike now.\"\n\nConsternation came into the faces before him. There were cries of\ndismay. He went on:\n\n\"We are only one camp, and the bosses would turn us out, they'd get in\nscabs and run the mines without us. What we must have is a strike of all\nthe camps at once. One big union and one big strike! If we walked out\nnow, it would please the bosses; but we'll fool them--we'll keep our\njobs, and keep our union too! You are members of the union, you'll go on\nworking for the union! Hooray for the North Valley union!\"\n\nFor a moment there was no response. It was hard for men to cheer over\nsuch a prospect! Hal saw that he must touch a different chord.\n\n\"We mustn't be cowards, boys! We've got to keep our nerve! I'm doing my\npart--it took nerve to get in here! In Mrs. Zamboni's clothes, and with\ntwo pillows stuffed in front of me!\"\n\nHe thumped the pillows, and there was a burst of laughter. Many in the\ncrowd knew Mrs. Zamboni--it was what comedians call a \"local gag.\" The\nlaughter spread, and became a gale of merriment. Men began to cheer:\n\"Hurrah for Joe! You're the girl! Will you marry me, Joe?\" And so, of\ncourse, it was easy for Hal to get a response when he shouted, \"Hurrah\nfor the North Valley union!\"\n\nAgain he raised his hands for silence, and went on again. \"Listen, men.\nThey'll turn me out, and you're not going to resist them. You're going\nto work and keep your jobs, and get ready for the big strike. And you'll\ntell the other men what I say. I can't talk to them all, but you tell\nthem about the union. Remember, there are people outside planning and\nfighting for you. We're going to stand by the union, all of us, till\nwe've brought these coal-camps back into America!\" There was a cheer\nthat shook the walls of the room. Yes, that was what they wanted--to\nlive in America!\n\nA crowd of men had gathered in the doorway, attracted by the uproar; Hal\nnoticed confusion and pushing, and saw the head and burly shoulders of\nhis enemy, Pete Hanun, come into sight.\n\n\"Here come the gunmen, boys!\" he cried; and there was a roar of anger\nfrom the crowd. Men turned, clenching their fists, glaring at the guard.\nBut Hal rushed on, quickly:\n\n\"Boys, hear what I say! Keep your heads! I can't stay in North Valley,\nand you know it! But I've done the thing I came to do, I've brought you\nthe message from the union. And you'll tell the other men--tell them to\nstand by the union!\"\n\nHal went on, repeating his message over and over. Looking from one to\nanother of these toil-worn faces, he remembered the pledge he had made\nthem, and he made it anew: \"I'm going to stand by you! I'm going on with\nthe fight, boys!\"\n\nThere came more disturbance at the door, and suddenly Jeff Cotton\nappeared, with a couple of additional guards, shoving their way into the\nroom, breathless and red in the face from running.\n\n\"Ah, there's the marshal!\" cried Hal. \"You needn't push, Cotton, there's\nnot going to be any trouble. We are union men here, we know how to\ncontrol ourselves. Now, boys, we're not giving up, we're not beaten,\nwe're only waiting for the men in the other camps! We have a union, and\nwe mean to keep it! Three cheers for the union!\"\n\nThe cheers rang out with a will: cheers for the union, cheers for Joe\nSmith, cheers for the widow and her weeds!\n\n\"You belong to the union! You stand by it, no matter what happens! If\nthey fire you, you take it on to the next place! You teach it to the new\nmen, you never let it die in your hearts! In union there is strength, in\nunion there is hope! Never forget it, men--_Union_!\"\n\nThe voice of the camp-marshal rang out. \"If you're coming, young woman,\ncome now!\"\n\nHal dropped a shy curtsey. \"Oh, Mr. Cotton! This is so sudden!\" The\ncrowd howled; and Hal descended from his platform. With coquettish\ngesturing he replaced the widow's veils about his face, and tripped\nmincingly across the dining-room. When he reached the camp-marshal, he\ndaintily took that worthy's arm, and with the \"breaker of teeth\" on the\nother side, and Bud Adams bringing up the rear, he toddled out of the\ndining-room and down the street.\n\nHungry men gave up their suppers to behold that sight. They poured out\nof the building, they followed, laughing, shouting, jeering. Others came\nfrom every direction--by the time the party had reached the depot, a\ngood part of the population of the village was on hand; and everywhere\nwent the word, \"It's Joe Smith! Come back with a message from the\nunion!\" Big, coal-grimed miners laughed till the tears made streaks on\ntheir faces; they fell on one another's necks for delight at this trick\nwhich had been played upon their oppressors.\n\nEven Jeff Cotton could not withhold his tribute. \"By God, you're the\nlimit!\" he muttered. He accepted the \"tea-party\" aspect of the affair,\nas the easiest way to get rid of his recurrent guest, and avert the\npossibilities of danger. He escorted the widow to the train and helped\nher up the steps, posting escorts at the doors of her car; nor did the\nattentions of these gallants cease until the train had moved down the\ncanyon and passed the limits of the North Valley stockade!\n\n\n\nSECTION 26.\n\nHal took off his widow's weeds; and with them he shed the merriment he\nhad worn for the benefit of the men. There came a sudden reaction; he\nrealised that he was tired.\n\nFor ten days he had lived in a whirl of excitement, scarcely stopping to\nsleep. Now he lay back in the car-seat, pale, exhausted; his head ached,\nand he realised that the sum-total of his North Valley experience was\nfailure. There was left in him no trace of that spirit of adventure with\nwhich he had set out upon his \"summer course in practical sociology.\" He\nhad studied his lessons, tried to recite them, and been \"flunked.\" He\nsmiled a bitter smile, recollecting the careless jesting that had been\non his lips as he came up that same canyon:\n\n  \"He keeps them a-roll, that merry old soul--\n    The wheels of industree;\n  A-roll and a-roll, for his pipe and his bowl\n    And his college facultee!\"\n\nThe train arrived in Pedro, and Hal took a hack at the station and drove\nto the hotel. He still carried the widow's weeds rolled into a bundle.\nHe might have left them in the train, but the impulse to economy which\nhe had acquired during the last ten weeks had become a habit. He would\nreturn them to Mrs. Zamboni. The money he had promised her might better\nbe used to feed her young ones. The two pillows he would leave in the\ncar; the hotel might endure the loss!\n\nEntering the lobby, the first person Hal saw was his brother, and the\nsight of that patrician face made human by disgust relieved Hal's\nheadache in part. Life was harsh, life was cruel; but here was weary,\nwaiting Edward, that boon of comic relief!\n\nEdward demanded to know where the devil he had been; and Hal answered,\n\"I've been visiting the widows and orphans.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Edward. \"And while I sit in this hole and stew! What's that\nyou've got under your arm?\"\n\nHal looked at the bundle. \"It's a souvenir of one of the widows,\" he\nsaid, and unrolled the garments and spread them out before his brother's\npuzzled eyes. \"A lady named Mrs. Swajka gave them to me. They belonged\nto another lady, Mrs. Zamboni, but she doesn't need them any more.\"\n\n\"What have _you_ got to do with them?\"\n\n\"It seems that Mrs. Zamboni is going to get married again.\" Hal lowered\nhis voice, confidentially. \"It's a romance, Edward--it may interest you\nas an illustration of the manners of these foreign races. She met a man\non the street, a fine, fine man, she says--and he gave her a lot of\nmoney. So she went and bought herself some new clothes, and she wants to\ngive these widow's weeds to the new man. That's the custom in her\ncountry, it seems--her sign that she accepts him as a suitor.\"\n\nSeeing the look of wonderment growing on his brother's face, Hal had to\nstop for a moment to keep his own face straight. \"If that man wasn't\nserious in his intention, Edward, he'll have trouble, for I know Mrs.\nZamboni's emotional nature. She'll follow him about everywhere--\"\n\n\"Hal, that creature is insane!\" And Edward looked about him nervously,\nas if he thought the Slavish widow might appear suddenly in the hotel\nlobby to demonstrate her emotional nature.\n\n\"No,\" replied Hal, \"it's just one of those differences in national\ncustoms.\" And suddenly Hal's face gave way. He began to laugh; he\nlaughed, perhaps more loudly than good form permitted.\n\nEdward was much annoyed. There were people in the lobby, and they were\nstaring at him. \"Cut it out, Hal!\" he exclaimed. \"Your fool jokes bore\nme!\" But nevertheless, Hal could see uncertainty in his brother's face.\nEdward recognised those widow's weeds. And how could he be sure about\nthe \"national customs\" of that grotesque creature who had pinched him in\nthe ribs on the street?\n\n\"Cut it out!\" he cried again.\n\nHal, changing his voice suddenly to the Zamboni key, exclaimed: \"Mister,\nI got eight children I got to feed, and I don't got no more man, and I\ndon't find no new man for old woman like me!\"\n\nSo at last the truth in its full enormity began to dawn upon Edward. His\nconsternation and disgust poured themselves out; and Hal listened, his\nlaughter dying. \"Edward,\" he said, \"you don't take me seriously even\nyet!\"\n\n\"Good God!\" cried the other. \"I believe you're really insane!\"\n\n\"You were up there, Edward! You heard what I said to those poor devils!\nAnd you actually thought I'd go off with you and forget about them!\"\n\nEdward ignored this. \"You're really insane!\" he repeated. \"You'll get\nyourself killed, in spite of all I can do!\"\n\nBut Hal only laughed. \"Not a chance of it! You should have seen the\ntea-party manners of the camp-marshal!\"\n\n\n\nSECTION 27.\n\nEdward would have endeavoured to carry his brother away forthwith, but\nthere was no train until late at night; so Hal went upstairs, where he\nfound Moylan and Hartman with Mary Burke and Mrs. Zamboni, all eager to\nhear his story. As the members of the committee, who had been out to\nsupper, came straggling in, the story was told again, and yet again.\nThey were almost as much delighted as the men in Reminitsky's. If only\nall strikes that had to be called off could be called off as neatly as\nthat!\n\nBetween these outbursts of satisfaction, they discussed their future.\nMoylan was going back to Western City, Hartman to his office in\nSheridan, from which he would arrange to send new organisers into North\nValley. No doubt Cartwright would turn off many men--those who had made\nthemselves conspicuous during the strike, those who continued to talk\nunion out loud. But such men would have to be replaced, and the union\nknew through what agencies the company got its hands. The North Valley\nminers would find themselves mysteriously provided with union literature\nin their various languages; it would be slipped under their pillows, or\ninto their dinner-pails, or the pockets of their coats while they were\nat work.\n\nAlso there was propaganda to be carried on among those who were turned\naway; so that, wherever they went, they would take the message of\nunionism. There had been a sympathetic outburst in Barela, Hal\nlearned--starting quite spontaneously that morning, when the men heard\nwhat had happened at North Valley. A score of workers had been fired,\nand more would probably follow in the morning. Here was a job for the\nmembers of the kidnapped committee; Tim Rafferty, for example--would he\ncare to stay in Pedro for a week or two, to meet such men, and give them\nliterature and arguments?\n\nThis offer was welcome; for life looked desolate to the Irish boy at\nthis moment. He was out of a job, his father was a wreck, his family\ndestitute and helpless. They would have to leave their home, of course;\nthere would be no place for any Rafferty in North Valley. Where they\nwould go, God only knew; Tim would become a wanderer, living away from\nhis people, starving himself and sending home his pitiful savings.\n\nHal was watching the boy, and reading these thoughts. He, Hal Warner,\nwould play the god out of a machine in this case, and in several others\nequally pitiful. He had the right to sign his father's name to checks, a\nprivilege which he believed he could retain, even while undertaking the\nrole of Haroun al Raschid in a mine-disaster. But what about the\nmine-disasters and abortive strikes where there did not happen to be any\nHaroun al Raschid at hand? What about those people, right in North\nValley, who did not happen to have told Hal of their affairs? He\nperceived that it was only by turning his back and running that he would\nescape from his adventure with any portion of his self-possession.\nTruly, this fair-seeming and wonderful civilisation was like the floor\nof a charnel-house or a field of battle; anywhere one drove a spade\nbeneath its surface, he uncovered horrors, sights for the eyes and\nstenches for the nostrils that caused him to turn sick!\n\nThere was Rusick, for example; he had a wife and two children, and not a\ndollar in the world. In the year and more that he had worked, faithfully\nand persistently, to get out coal for Peter Harrigan, he had never once\nbeen able to get ahead of his bill for the necessities of life at Old\nPeter's store. All his belongings in the world could be carried in a\nbundle on his back, and whether he ever saw these again would depend\nupon the whim of old Peter's camp-marshal and guards. Rusick would take\nto the road, with a ticket purchased by the union. Perhaps he would find\na job and perhaps not; in any case, the best he could hope for in life\nwas to work for some other Harrigan, and run into debt at some other\ncompany-store.\n\nThere was Hobianish, a Serbian, and Hernandez, a Mexican, of whom the\nsame things were true, except that one had four children and the other\nsix. Bill Wauchope had only a wife--their babies had died, thank heaven,\nhe said. He did not seem to have been much moved by Jim Moylan's\npleadings; he was down and out; he would take to the road, and beat his\nway to the East and back to England. They called this a free country! By\nGod, if he were to tell what had happened to him, he could not get an\nEnglish miner to believe it!\n\nHal gave these men his real name and address, and made them promise to\nlet him know how they got along. He would help a little, he said; in his\nmind he was figuring how much he ought to do. How far shall a man go in\nrelieving the starvation about him, before he can enjoy his meals in a\nwell-appointed club? What casuist will work out this problem--telling\nhim the percentage he shall relieve of the starvation he happens\npersonally to know about, the percentage of that which he sees on the\nstreets, the percentage of that about which he reads in government\nreports on the rise in the cost of living. To what extent is he\npermitted to close his eyes, as he walks along the streets on his way to\nthe club? To what extent is he permitted to avoid reading government\nreports before going out to dinner-dances with his fianc\u00c3\u00a9e? Problems\nsuch as these the masters of the higher mathematics have neglected to\nsolve; the wise men of the academies and the holy men of the churches\nhave likewise failed to work out the formulas; and Hal, trying to obtain\nthem by his crude mental arithmetic, found no satisfaction in the\nresults.\n\n\n\nSECTION 28.\n\nHal wanted a chance to talk to Mary Burke; they had had no intimate talk\nsince the meeting with Jessie Arthur, and now he was going away, for a\nlong time. He wanted to find out what plans Mary had for the future,\nand--more important yet--what was her state of mind. If he had been able\nto lift this girl from despair, his summer course in practical sociology\nhad not been all a failure!\n\nHe asked her to go with him to say good-bye to John Edstrom, whom he had\nnot seen since their unceremonious parting at MacKellar's, when Hal had\nfled to Percy Harrigan's train. Downstairs in the lobby Hal explained\nhis errand to his waiting brother, who made no comment, but merely\nremarked that he would follow, if Hal had no objection. He did not care\nto make the acquaintance of the Hibernian Joan of Arc, and would not\ncome close enough to interfere with Hal's conversation with the lady;\nbut he wished to do what he could for his brother's protection. So there\nset out a moon-light procession--first Hal and Mary, then Edward, and\nthen Edward's dinner-table companion, the \"hardware-drummer!\"\n\nHal was embarrassed in beginning his farewell talk with Mary. He had no\nidea how she felt towards him, and he admitted with a guilty pang that\nhe was a little afraid to find out! He thought it best to be cheerful,\nso he started to tell her how fine he thought her conduct during the\nstrike. But she did not respond to his remarks, and at last he realised\nthat she was labouring with some thoughts of her own.\n\n\"There's somethin' I got to say to ye!\" she began, suddenly. \"A couple\nof days ago I knew how I meant to say it, but now I don't.\"\n\n\"Well,\" he laughed, \"say it as you meant to.\"\n\n\"No; 'twas bitter--and now I'm on my knees before ye.\"\n\n\"Not that I want you to be bitter,\" said Hal, still laughing, \"but it's\nI that ought to be on my knees before you. I didn't accomplish anything,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"Ye did all ye could--and more than the rest of us. I want ye to know\nI'll never forget it. But I want ye to hear the other thing, too!\"\n\nShe walked on, staring before her, doubling up her hands in agitation.\n\"Well?\" said he, still trying to keep a cheerful tone.\n\n\"Ye remember that day just after the explosion? Ye remember what I said\nabout--about goin' away with ye? I take it back.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course!\" said he, quickly. \"You were distracted, Mary--you\ndidn't know what you were saying.\"\n\n\"No, no! That's not it! But I've changed my mind; I don't mean to throw\nmeself away.\"\n\n\"I told you you'd see it that way,\" he said. \"No man is worth it.\"\n\n\"Ah, lad!\" said she. \"'Tis the fine soothin' tongue ye have--but I'd\nrather ye knew the truth. 'Tis that I've seen the other girl; and I hate\nher!\"\n\nThey walked for a bit in silence. Hal had sense enough to realise that\nhere was a difficult subject. \"I don't want to be a prig, Mary,\" he said\ngently; \"but you'll change your mind about that, too. You'll not hate\nher; you'll be sorry for her.\"\n\nShe laughed--a raw, harsh laugh. \"What kind of a joke is that?\"\n\n\"I know--it may seem like one. But it'll come to you some day. You have\na wonderful thing to live and fight for; while she\"--he hesitated a\nmoment, for he was not sure of his own ideas on this subject--\"she has\nso many things to learn; and she may never learn them. She'll miss some\nfine things.\"\n\n\"I know one of the fine things she does not mean to miss,\" said Mary,\ngrimly; \"that's Mr. Hal Warner.\" Then, after they had walked again in\nsilence: \"I want ye to understand me, Mr. Warner--\"\n\n\"Ah, Mary!\" he pleaded. \"Don't treat me that way! I'm Joe.\"\n\n\"All right,\" she said, \"Joe ye shall be. 'Twill remind ye of a pretty\nadventure--bein' a workin' man for a few weeks. Well, that's a part of\nwhat I have to tell ye. I've got my pride, even if I'm only a poor\nminer's daughter; and the other day I found out me place.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\" he asked.\n\n\"Ye don't understand? Honest?\"\n\n\"No, honest,\" he said.\n\n\"Ye're stupid with women, Joe. Ye didn't see what the girl did to me!\n'Twas some kind of a bug I was to her. She was not sure if I was the\nkind that bites, but she took no chances--she threw me off, like that.\"\nAnd Mary snapped her hand, as one does when troubled with a bug.\n\n\"Ah, now!\" pleaded Hal. \"You're not being fair!\"\n\n\"I'm bein' just as fair as I've got it in me to be, Joe. I been off and\nhad it all out. I can see this much--'tis not her fault, maybe--'tis her\nclass; 'tis all of ye--the very best of ye, even yeself, Joe Smith!\"\n\n\"Yea,\" he replied, \"Tim Rafferty said that.\"\n\n\"Tim said too much--but a part of it was true. Ye think ye've come here\nand been one of us workin' people. But don't your own sense tell you\nthe difference, as if it was a canyon a million miles across--between a\npoor ignorant creature in a minin' camp, and a rich man's daughter, a\nlady? Ye'd tell me not to be ashamed of poverty; but would ye ever put\nme by the side of her--for all your fine feelin's of friendship for them\nthat's beneath ye? Didn't ye show that at the Minettis'?\"\n\n\"But don't you see, Mary--\" He made an effort to laugh. \"I got used to\nobeying Jessie! I knew her a long time before I knew you.\"\n\n\"Ah, Joe! Ye've a kind heart, and a pleasant way of speakin'. But\nwouldn't it interest ye to know the real truth? Ye said ye'd come out\nhere to learn the truth!\"\n\nAnd Hal answered, in a low voice, \"Yes,\" and did not interrupt again.\n\n\n\nSECTION 29.\n\nMary's voice had dropped low, and Hal thought how rich and warm it was\nwhen she was deeply moved. She went on:\n\n\"I lived all me life in minin' camps, Joe Smith, and I seen men robbed\nand beaten, and women cryin' and childer hungry. I seen the company,\nlike some great wicked beast that eat them up. But I never knew why, or\nwhat it meant--till that day, there at the Minettis'. I'd read about\nfine ladies in books, ye see; but I'd never been spoke to by one, I'd\nnever had to swallow one, as ye might say. But there I did--and all at\nonce I seemed to know where the money goes that's wrung out of the\nminers. I saw why people were robbin' us, grindin' the life out of\nus--for fine ladies like that, to keep them so shinin' and soft! 'Twould\nnot have been so bad, if she'd not come just then, with all the men and\nboys dyin' down in the pits--dyin' for that soft, white skin, and those\nsoft, white hands, and all those silky things she swished round in. My\nGod, Joe--d'ye know what she seemed to me like? Like a smooth, sleek cat\nthat has just eat up a whole nest full of baby mice, and has the blood\nof them all over her cheeks!\"\n\nMary paused, breathing hard. Hal kept silence, and she went on again: \"I\nhad it out with meself, Joe! I don't want ye to think I'm any better\nthan I am, and I asked meself this question--Is it for the men in the\npits that ye hate her with such black murder? Or is it for the one man\nye want, and that she's got? And I knew the answer to that! But then I\nasked meself another question, too--Would ye be like her if ye could?\nWould ye do what she's doin' right now--would ye have it on your soul?\nAnd as God hears me, Joe, 'tis the truth I speak--I'd not do it! No, not\nfor the love of any man that ever walked on this earth!\"\n\nShe had lifted her clenched fist as she spoke. She let it fall again,\nand strode on, not even glancing at him. \"Ye might try a thousand years,\nJoe, and ye'd not realise the feelin's that come to me there at the\nMinettis'. The shame of it--not what she done to me, but what she made\nme in me own eyes! Me, the daughter of a drunken old miner, and her--I\ndon't know what her father is, but she's some sort of princess, and she\nknows it. And that's the thing that counts, Joe! 'Tis not that she has\nso much money, and so many fine things; that she knows how to talk, and\nI don't, and that her voice is sweet, and mine is ugly, when I'm ragin'\nas I am now. No--'tis that she's so _sure!_ That's the word I found to\nsay it; she's sure--sure--_sure!_ She has the fine things, she's always\nhad them, she has a right to have them! And I have a right to nothin'\nbut trouble, I'm hunted all day by misery and fear, I've lost even the\nroof over me head! Joe, ye know I've got some temper--I'm not easy to\nbeat down; but when I'd got through bein' taught me place, I went off\nand hid meself, I ground me face in the dirt, for the black rage of it!\nI said to meself, 'Tis true! There's somethin' in her better than me!\nShe's some kind of finer creature.--Look at these hands!\" She held them\nout in the moonlight, with a swift, passionate gesture. \"So she's a\nright to her man, and I'm a fool to have ever raised me eyes to him! I\nhave to see him go away, and crawl back into me leaky old shack! Yes,\nthat's the truth! And when I point it out to the man, what d'ye think he\nsays? Why, he tells me gently and kindly that I ought to be sorry for\nher! Christ! did ye ever hear the like of that?\"\n\nThere was a long silence. Hal could not have said anything now, if he\nhad wished to. He knew that this was what he had come to seek! This was\nthe naked soul of the class-war!\n\n\"Now,\" concluded Mary, with clenched hands, and a voice that\ncorresponded, \"now, I've had it out. I'm no slave; I've just as good a\nright to life as any lady. I know I'll never have it, of course; I'll\nnever wear good clothes, nor live in a decent home, nor have the man I\nwant; but I'll know that I've done somethin' to help free the workin'\npeople from the shame that's put on them. That's what the strike done\nfor me, Joe! The strike showed me the way. We're beat this time, but\nsomehow it hasn't made the difference ye might think. I'm goin' to make\nmore strikes before I quit, and they won't all of them be beat!\"\n\nShe stopped speaking; and Hal walked beside her, stirred by a conflict\nof emotions. His vision of her was indeed true; she would make more\nstrikes! He was glad and proud of that; but then came the thought that\nwhile she, a girl, was going on with the bitter war, he, a man, would be\neating grilled beefsteaks at the club!\n\n\"Mary,\" he said, \"I'm ashamed of myself--\"\n\n\"That's not it, Joe! Ye've no call to be ashamed. Ye can't help it where\nye were born--\"\n\n\"Perhaps not, Mary. But when a man knows he's never paid for any of the\nthings he's enjoyed all his life, surely the least he can do is to be\nashamed. I hope you'll try not to hate me as you do the others.\"\n\n\"I never hated ye, Joe! Not for one moment! I tell ye fair and true, I\nlove ye as much as ever. I can say it, because I'd not have ye now; I've\nseen the other girl, and I know ye'd never be satisfied with me. I don't\nknow if I ought to say it, but I'm thinkin' ye'll not be altogether\nsatisfied with her, either. Ye'll be unhappy either way--God help ye!\"\n\nThe girl had read deeply into his soul in this last speech; so deeply\nthat Hal could not trust himself to answer. They were passing a\nstreet-lamp, and she looked at him, for the first time since they had\nstarted on their walk, and saw harassment in his face. A sudden\ntenderness came into her voice. \"Joe,\" she said; \"ye're lookin' bad.\n'Tis good ye're goin' away from this place!\"\n\nHe tried to smile, but the effort was feeble.\n\n\"Joe,\" she went on, \"ye asked me to be your friend. Well, I'll be that!\"\nAnd she held out the big, rough hand.\n\nHe took it. \"We'll not forget each other, Mary,\" he said. There was a\ncatch in his voice.\n\n\"Sure, lad!\" she exclaimed. \"We'll make another strike some day, just\nlike we did at North Valley!\"\n\nHal pressed the big hand; but then suddenly, remembering his brother\nstalking solemnly in the rear, he relinquished the clasp, and failed to\nsay all the fine things he had in his mind. He called himself a rebel,\nbut not enough to be sentimental before Edward!\n\n\n\nSECTION 30.\n\nThey came to the house where John Edstrom was staying. The labouring\nman's wife opened the door. In answer to Hal's question, she said, \"The\nold gentleman's pretty bad.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with him?\"\n\n\"Didn't you know he was hurt?\"\n\n\"No. How?\"\n\n\"They beat him up, sir. Broke his arm, and nearly broke his head.\"\n\nHal and Mary exclaimed in chorus, \"Who did it? When?\"\n\n\"We don't know who did it. It was four nights ago.\"\n\nHal realised it must have happened while he was escaping from\nMacKellar's. \"Have you had a doctor for him?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; but we can't do much, because my man is out of work, and I\nhave the children and the boarders to look after.\"\n\nHal and Mary ran upstairs. Their old friend lay in darkness, but he\nrecognised their voices and greeted them with a feeble cry. The woman\nbrought a lamp, and they saw him lying on his back, his head done up in\nbandages, and one arm bound in splints. He looked really desperately\nbad, his kindly old eyes deep-sunken and haggard, and his face--Hal\nremembered what Jeff Cotton had called him, \"that dough-faced old\npreacher!\"\n\nThey got the story of what had happened at the time of Hal's flight to\nPercy's train. Edstrom had shouted a warning to the fugitives, and set\nout to run after them; when one of the mine-guards, running past him,\nhad fetched him a blow over the eye, knocking him down. He had struck\nhis head upon the pavement, and lain there unconscious for many hours.\nWhen finally some one had come upon him, and summoned a policeman, they\nhad gone through his pockets, and found the address of this place where\nhe was staying written on a scrap of paper. That was all there was to\nthe story--except that Edstrom had refrained from sending to MacKellar\nfor help, because he had felt sure they were all working to get the mine\nopen, and he did not feel he had the right to put his troubles upon\nthem.\n\nHal listened to the old man's feeble statements, and there came back to\nhim a surge of that fury which his North Valley experience had generated\nin him. It was foolish, perhaps; for to knock down an old man who had\nbeen making trouble was a comparatively slight exercise of the functions\nof a mine-guard. But to Hal it seemed the most characteristic of all the\noutrages he had seen; it was an expression of the company's utter\nblindness to all that was best in life. This old man, who was so gentle,\nso patient, who had suffered so much, and not learned to hate, who had\nkept his faith so true! What did his faith mean to the thugs of the\nGeneral Fuel Company? What had his philosophy availed him, his\nsaintliness, his hopes for mankind? They had fetched him one swipe as\nthey passed him, and left him lying--alive or dead, it was all the same.\n\nHal had got some satisfaction out of his little adventure in widowhood,\nand some out of Mary's self-victory; but there, listening to the old\nman's whispered story, his satisfaction died. He realised again the grim\ntruth about his summer's experience--that the issue of it had been\ndefeat. Utter, unqualified defeat! He had caused the bosses a momentary\nchagrin; but it would not take them many hours to realise that he had\nreally done them a service in calling off the strike for them. They\nwould start the wheels of industry again, and the workers would be just\nwhere they had been before Joe Smith came to be stableman and buddy\namong them. What was all the talk about solidarity, about hope for the\nfuture; what would it amount to in the long run, the daily rolling of\nthe wheels of industry? The workers of North Valley would have exactly\nthe right they had always had--the right to be slaves, and if they did\nnot care for that, the right to be martyrs!\n\nMary sat holding the old man's hand and whispering words of passionate\nsympathy, while Hal got up and paced the tiny attic, all ablaze with\nanger. He resolved suddenly that he would not go back to Western City;\nhe would stay here, and get an honest lawyer to come, and set out to\npunish the men who were guilty of this outrage. He would test out the\nlaw to the limit; if necessary, he would begin a political fight, to put\nan end to coal-company rule in this community. He would find some one to\nwrite up these conditions, he would raise the money and publish a paper\nto make them known! Before his surging wrath had spent itself, Hal\nWarner had actually come out as a candidate for governor, and was\noverturning the Republican machine--all because an unidentified\ncoal-company detective had knocked a dough-faced old miner into the\ngutter and broken his arm!\n\n\n\nSECTION 31.\n\nIn the end, of course, Hal had to come down to practical matters. He sat\nby the bed and told the old man tactfully that his brother had come to\nsee him and had given him some money. This brother had plenty of money,\nso Edstrom could be taken to the hospital; or, if he preferred, Mary\ncould stay near here and take care of him. They turned to the landlady,\nwho had been standing in the doorway; she had three boarders in her\nlittle home, it seemed, but if Mary could share a bed with the\nlandlady's two children, they might make out. In spite of Hal's protest,\nMary accepted this offer; he saw what was in her mind--she would take\nsome of his money, because of old Edstrom's need, but she would take\njust as little as she possibly could.\n\nJohn Edstrom of course knew nothing of events since his injury, so Hal\ntold him the story briefly--though without mentioning the transformation\nwhich had taken place in the miner's buddy. He told about the part Mary\nhad played in the strike; trying to entertain the poor old man, he told\nhow he had seen her mounted upon a snow-white horse, and wearing a robe\nof white, soft and lustrous, like Joan of Arc, or the leader of a\nsuffrage parade.\n\n\"Sure,\" said Mary, \"he's forever callin' attention to this old dress!\"\n\nHal looked; she was wearing the same blue calico. \"There's something\nmysterious about that dress,\" said he. \"It's one of those that you read\nabout in fairy-stories, that forever patch themselves, and keep\nthemselves new and starchy. A body only needs one dress like that!\"\n\n\"Sure, lad,\" she answered. \"There's no fairies in coal-camps--unless\n'tis meself, that washes it at night, and dries it over the stove, and\nirons it next mornin'.\"\n\nShe said this with unwavering cheerfulness; but even the old miner lying\nin pain on the cot could realise the tragedy of a young girl's having\nonly one old dress in her love-hunting season. He looked at the young\ncouple, and saw their evident interest in each other; after the fashion\nof the old, he was disposed to help along the romance. \"She may need\nsome orange blossoms,\" he ventured, feebly.\n\n\"Go along with ye!\" laughed Mary, still unwavering.\n\n\"Sure,\" put in Hal, with hasty gallantry, \"'tis a blossom she is\nherself! A rose in a mining-camp--and there's a dispute about her in the\npoetry-books. One tells you to leave her on her stalk, and another says\nto gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old time is still a-flying!\"\n\n\"Ye're mixin' me up,\" said Mary. \"A while back I was ridin' on a white\nhorse.\"\n\n\"I remember,\" said Old Edstrom, \"not so far back, you were an ant,\nMary.\"\n\nHer face became grave. To jest about her personal tragedy was one thing,\nto jest about the strike was another. \"Yes, I remember. Ye said I'd stay\nin the line! Ye were wiser than me, Mr. Edstrom.\"\n\n\"That's one of the things that come with being old, Mary.\" He moved his\ngnarled old hand toward hers. \"You're going on, now?\" he asked. \"You're\na unionist now, Mary?\"\n\n\"I am that!\" she answered, promptly, her grey eyes shining.\n\n\"There's a saying,\" said he--\"once a striker, always a striker. Find a\nway to get some education for yourself, Mary, and when the big strike\ncomes you'll be one of those the miners look to. I'll not be here, I\nknow--the young people must take my place.\"\n\n\"I'll do my part,\" she answered. Her voice was low; it was a kind of\nbenediction the old man was giving her.\n\nThe woman had gone downstairs to attend to her children; she came back\nnow to say that there was a gentleman at the door, who wanted to know\nwhen his brother was coming. Hal remembered suddenly--Edward had been\npacing up and down all this while, with no company but a \"hardware\ndrummer!\" The younger brother's resolve to stay in Pedro had already\nbegun to weaken somewhat, and now it weakened still further; he realised\nthat life is complex, that duties conflict! He assured the old miner\nagain of his ability to see that he did not suffer from want, and then\nhe bade him farewell for a while.\n\nHe started out, and Mary went as far as the head of the stairway with\nhim. He took the girl's big, rough hand in his--this time with no one to\nsee. \"Mary,\" he said, \"I want you to know that nothing will make me\nforget you; and nothing will make me forget the miners.\"\n\n\"Ah, Joe!\" she cried. \"Don't let them win ye away from us! We need ye so\nbad!\"\n\n\"I'm going back home for a while,\" he answered, \"but you can be sure\nthat no matter what happens in my life, I'm going to fight for the\nworking people. When the big strike comes, as we know it's coming in\nthis coal-country, I'll be here to do my share.\"\n\n\"Sure lad,\" she said, looking him bravely in the eye, \"and good-bye to\nye, Joe Smith.\" Her eyes did not waver; but Hal noted a catch in her\nvoice, and he found himself with an impulse to take her in his arms. It\nwas very puzzling. He knew he loved Jessie Arthur; he remembered the\nquestion Mary had once asked him--could he be in love with two girls at\nthe same time? It was not in accord with any moral code that had been\nimpressed upon him, but apparently he could!\n\n\n\nSECTION 32.\n\nHe went out to the street, where his brother was pacing up and down in a\nferment. The \"hardware drummer\" had made another effort to start a\nconversation, and had been told to go to hell--no less!\n\n\"Well, are you through now?\" Edward demanded, taking out his irritation\non Hal.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the other. \"I suppose so.\" He realised that Edward would\nnot be concerned about Edstrom's broken arm.\n\n\"Then, for God's sake, get some clothes on and let's have some food.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Hal. But his answer was listless, and the other looked\nat him sharply. Even by the moonlight Edward could see the lines in the\nface of his younger brother, and the hollows around his eyes. For the\nfirst time he realised how deeply these experiences were cutting into\nthe boy's soul. \"You poor kid!\" he exclaimed, with sudden feeling. But\nHal did not answer; he did not want sympathy, he did not want anything!\n\nEdward made a gesture of despair. \"God knows, I don't know what to do\nfor you!\"\n\nThey started back to the hotel, and on the way Edward cast about in his\nmind for a harmless subject of conversation. He mentioned that he had\nforeseen the shutting up of the stores, and had purchased an outfit for\nhis brother. There was no need to thank him, he added grimly; he had no\nintention of travelling to Western City in company with a hobo.\n\nSo the young miner had a bath, the first real one in a long time. (Never\nagain would it be possible for ladies to say in Hal Warner's presence\nthat the poor might at least keep clean!) He had a shave; he trimmed his\nfinger-nails, and brushed his hair, and dressed himself as a gentleman.\nIn spite of himself he found his cheerfulness partly restored. A strange\nand wonderful sensation--to be dressed once more as a gentleman. He\nthought of the saying of the old negro, who liked to stub his toe,\nbecause it felt so good when it stopped hurting!\n\nThey went out to find a restaurant, and on the way one last misadventure\nbefell Edward. Hal saw an old miner walking past, and stopped with a\ncry: \"Mike!\" He forgot all at once that he was a gentleman; the old\nminer forgot it also. He stared for one bewildered moment, then he\nrushed at Hal and seized him in the hug of a mountain grizzly.\n\n\"My buddy! My buddy!\" he cried, and gave Hal a prodigious thump on the\nback. \"By Judas!\" And he gave him a thump with the other hand. \"Hey! you\nold son-of-a-gun!\" And he gave him a hairy kiss!\n\nBut in the very midst of these raptures it dawned over him that there\nwas something wrong about his buddy. He drew back, staring. \"You got\ngood clothes! You got rich, hey?\"\n\nEvidently the old fellow had heard no rumour concerning Hal's secret.\n\"I've been doing pretty well,\" Hal said.\n\n\"What you work at, hey?\"\n\n\"I been working at a strike in North Valley.\"\n\n\"What's that? You make money working at strike?\"\n\nHal laughed, but did not explain. \"What you working at?\"\n\n\"I work at strike too--all alone strike.\"\n\n\"No job?\"\n\n\"I work two days on railroad. Got busted track up there. Pay me\ntwo-twenty-five a day. Then no more job.\"\n\n\"Have you tried the mines?\"\n\n\"What? Me? They got me all right! I go up to San Jos\u00c3\u00a9. Pit-boss say,\n'Get the hell out of here, you old groucher! You don't get no more jobs\nin this district!'\"\n\nHal looked Mike over, and saw that his dirty old face was drawn and\nwhite, belying the feeble cheerfulness of his words. \"We're going to\nhave something to eat,\" he said. \"Won't you come with us?\"\n\n\"Sure thing!\" said Mike, with alacrity. \"I go easy on grub now.\"\n\nHal introduced \"Mr. Edward Warner,\" who said \"How do you do?\" He\naccepted gingerly the calloused paw which the old Slovak held out to\nhim, but he could not keep the look of irritation from his face. His\npatience was utterly exhausted. He had hoped to find a decent restaurant\nand have some real food; but now, of course, he could not enjoy\nanything, with this old gobbler in front of him.\n\nThey entered an all-night lunch-room, where Hal and Mike ordered\ncheese-sandwiches and milk, and Edward sat and wondered at his brother's\nability to eat such food. Meantime the two cronies told each other their\nstories, and Old Mike slapped his knee and cried out with delight over\nHal's exploits. \"Oh, you buddy!\" he exclaimed; then, to Edward, \"Ain't\nhe a daisy, hey?\" And he gave Edward a thump on the shoulder. \"By Judas,\nthey don't beat my buddy!\"\n\nMike Sikoria had last been seen by Hal from the window of the North\nValley jail, when he had been distributing the copies of Hal's\nsignature, and Bud Adams had taken him in charge. The mine-guard had\nmarched him into a shed in back of the power-house, where he had found\nKauser and Kalovac, two other fellows who had been arrested while\nhelping in the distribution.\n\nMike detailed the experience with his usual animation. \"'Hey, Mister\nBud,' I say, 'if you going to send me down canyon, I want to get my\nthings.' 'You go to hell for your things,' says he. And then I say,\n'Mister Bud, I want to get my time.' And he says, 'I give you plenty\ntime right here!' And he punch me and throw me over. Then he grab me up'\nagain and pull me outside, and I see big automobile waiting, and I say,\n'Holy Judas! I get ride in automobile! Here I am, old fellow fifty-seven\nyears old, never been in automobile ride all my days. I think always I\ndie and never get in automobile ride!' We go down canyon, and I look\nround and see them mountains, and feel nice cool wind in my face, and I\nsay, 'Bully for you, Mister Bud, I don't never forget this automobile. I\ndon't have such good time any day all my life.' And he say, 'Shut your\nface, you old wop!' Then we come out on prairie, we go up in Black\nHills, and they stop, and say, 'Get out here, you sons o' guns.' And\nthey leave us there all alone. They say, 'You come back again, we catch\nyou and we rip the guts out of you!' They go away fast, and we got to\nwalk seven hours, us fellers, before we come to a house! But I don't\nmind that, I begged some grub, and then I got job mending track; only I\ndon't find out if you get out of jail, and I think maybe I lose my buddy\nand never see him no more.\"\n\nHere the old man stopped, gazing affectionately at Hal. \"I write you\nletter to North Valley, but I don't hear nothing, and I got to walk all\nthe way on railroad track to look for you.\"\n\nHow was it? Hal wondered. He had encountered naked horror in this\ncoal-country--yet here he was, not entirely glad at the thought of\nleaving it! He would miss Old Mike Sikoria, his hairy kiss and his\ngrizzly-bear hug!\n\nHe struck the old man dumb by pressing a twenty-dollar bill into his\nhand. Also he gave him the address of Edstrom and Mary, and a note to\nJohann Hartman, who might use him to work among the Slovaks who came\ndown into the town. Hal explained that he had to go back to Western City\nthat night, but that he would never forget his old friend, and would see\nthat he had a good job. He was trying to figure out some occupation for\nthe old man on his father's country-place. A pet grizzly!\n\nTrain-time came, and the long line of dark sleepers rolled in by the\ndepot-platform. It was late--after midnight; but, nevertheless, there\nwas Old Mike. He was in awe of Hal now, with his fine clothes and his\ntwenty-dollar bills; but, nevertheless, under stress of his emotion, he\ngave him one more hug, and one more hairy kiss. \"Good-bye, my buddy!\" he\ncried. \"You come back, my buddy! I don't forget my buddy!\" And when the\ntrain began to move, he waved his ragged cap, and ran along the platform\nto get a last glimpse, to call a last farewell. When Hal turned into the\ncar, it was with more than a trace of moisture in his eyes.\n\n\n\n\nPOSTSCRIPT\n\n\nFrom previous experiences the writer has learned that many people,\nreading a novel such as \"King Coal,\" desire to be informed as to whether\nit is true to fact. They write to ask if the book is meant to be so\ntaken; they ask for evidence to convince themselves and others. Having\nanswered thousands of such letters in the course of his life, it seems\nto the author the part of common-sense to answer some of them in\nadvance.\n\n\"King Coal\" is a picture of the life of the workers in unorganised\nlabour-camps in many parts of America, The writer has avoided naming a\ndefinite place, for the reason that such conditions are to be found as\nfar apart as West Virginia, Alabama, Michigan, Minnesota, and Colorado.\nMost of the details of his picture were gathered in the last-named\nstate, which the writer visited on three occasions during and just after\nthe great coal-strike of 1913-14. The book gives a true picture of\nconditions and events observed by him at this time. Practically all the\ncharacters are real persons, and every incident which has social\nsignificance is not merely a true incident, but a typical one. The life\nportrayed in \"King Coal\" is the life that is lived to-day by hundreds of\nthousands of men, women and children in this \"land of the free.\"\n\nThe reader who wishes evidence may be accommodated. There was never a\nstrike more investigated than the Colorado coal-strike. The material\nabout it in the writer's possession cannot be less than eight million\nwords, the greater part of it sworn testimony taken under government\nsupervision. There is, first, the report of the Congressional Committee,\na government document of three thousand closely printed pages, about two\nmillion words; an equal amount of testimony given before the U. S.\nCommission on Industrial Relations, also a government document; a\nspecial report on the Colorado strike, prepared for the same commission,\na book of 189 pages, supporting every contention of this story; about\nfour hundred thousand words of testimony given before a committee\nappointed at the suggestion of the Governor of Colorado; a report made\nby the Rev. Henry A. Atkinson, who investigated the strike as\nrepresentative of the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in\nAmerica, and of the Social Service Commission of the Congregational\nChurches; the report of an elaborate investigation by the Colorado state\nmilitia; the bulletins issued by both sides during the controversy; the\ntestimony given at various coroners' inquests; and, finally, articles by\ndifferent writers to be found in the files of _Everybody's Magazine_,\nthe _Metropolitan Magazine_, the _Survey_, _Harper's Weekly_, and\n_Collier's Weekly_, all during the year 1914.\n\nThe writer prepared a collection of extracts from these various sources,\nmeaning to publish them in this place; but while the manuscript was in\nthe hands of the publishers, there appeared one document, which, in the\nweight of its authority, seemed to discount all others. A decision was\nrendered by the Supreme Court of the State of Colorado, in a case which\nincluded the most fundamental of the many issues raised in \"King Coal.\"\nIt is not often that the writer of a novel of contemporary life is so\nfortunate as to have the truth of his work passed upon and established\nby the highest judicial tribunal of the community!\n\nIn the elections of November, 1914, in Huerfano County, Colorado, J. B.\nFarr, Republican candidate for re-election as sheriff, a person known\nthroughout the coal-country as \"the King of Huerfano County,\" was\nreturned as elected by a majority of 329 votes. His rival, the\nDemocratic candidate, contested the election, alleging \"malconduct,\nfraud and corruption.\" The district court found in Farr's favour, and\nthe case was appealed on error to the Supreme Court of the State. On\nJune 21st, 1916, after Farr had served nearly the whole of his term of\noffice, the Supreme Court handed down a decision which unseated him and\nthe entire ticket elected with him, finding in favour of the opposition\nticket in all cases and upon all grounds charged.\n\nThe decision is long--about ten thousand words, and its legal\ntechnicalities would not interest the reader. It will suffice to reprint\nthe essential paragraphs. The reader is asked to give these paragraphs\ncareful study, considering, not merely the specific offence denounced by\nthe court, but its wider implications. The offence was one so\nunprecedented that the justices of the court, men chosen for their\nlearning in the history of offences, were moved to say: \"We find no such\nexample of fraud within the books, and must seek the letter and spirit\nof the law in a free government, as a scale in which to weigh such\nconduct.\" And let it be noted, this \"crime without a name\" was not a\ncrime of passion, but of policy; it was a crime deliberately planned and\ncarried out by profit-seeking corporations of enormous power. Let the\nreader imagine the psychology of the men of great wealth who ordered\nthis crime, as a means of keeping and increasing their wealth; let him\nrealise what must be the attitude of such men to their helpless workers;\nand then let him ask himself whether there is any act portrayed in \"King\nCoal\" which men of such character would shrink from ordering.\n\nThe Court decision first gives an outline of the case, using for the\nmost part the statements of the counsel for the defendant, Farr; so that\nfor practical purposes the following may be taken as the coal companies'\nown account of their domain: \"Round the shaft of each mine are clustered\nthe tipple, the mine office, the shops, sheds and outbuildings; and\nhuddled close by, within a stone's throw, cottages of the miners built\non the land of, and owned by, the mining company. All the dwellers in\nthe camp are employ\u00c3\u00a9s of the mine. There is no other industry. This is\n'the camp.' Of the eight 'closed camps' it appears that practically the\nsame conditions existed in all of them, and those conditions were in\ngeneral that members of the United Mine Workers of America, their\norganisers or agitators, were prevented from coming into the camps, so\nfar as it was possible to keep them out, and to this end guards were\nstationed about them. Of the eight 'closed camps' one of them, 'Walsen,'\nwas, and at the time of the trial still was, enclosed by a fence erected\nat the beginning of the strike in October, 1913: Rouse and Cameron were\npartly, but never entirely, enclosed by fences. It is admitted that all\npersons entering these camps and precincts were required by the\ncompanies to have passes, and it is contended that this was an\n'industrial necessity.'\"\n\nThe Court then goes on as follows:\n\n\"The Federal troops entered the district in May of 1914, and the\ntestimony is in agreement that no serious acts of violence occurred\nthereafter, and that order was preserved up to and subsequent to the\nelection, and to the time of this trial.\n\n\"It was under this condition that in July, 1914, the Board of County\nCommissioners changed certain of the election precincts so as to\nconstitute each of such camps an election precinct, and with but one\nexception where a few ranches were included, these precincts were made\nto conform to the fences and lines around each camp, protected by fences\nin some instances and with armed guards in all cases. Thus each election\nprecinct by this unparalleled act of the commissioners was placed\nexclusively within and upon the private grounds and under the private\ncontrol of a coal corporation, which autocratically declared who should\nand who should not enter upon the territory of this political entity of\nthe state, so purposely bounded by the county commissioners.\n\n\"With but one exception all the lands and buildings within each of these\nelection precincts as so created, were owned or controlled by the coal\ncorporations; every person resident within such precincts was an employ\u00c3\u00a9\nof these private corporations or their allied companies, with the single\nexception: every judge, clerk or officer of election with the exception\nof a saloon keeper, and partner of Farr, was an employ\u00c3\u00a9 of the\ncoal-companies.\n\n\"The polling places were upon the grounds, and in the buildings of these\ncompanies; the registration lists were kept within the private offices\nor buildings of such companies, and used and treated as their private\nproperty.\n\n\"Thus were the public election districts and the public election\nmachinery turned over to the absolute domination and imperial control of\nprivate coal corporations, and used by them as absolutely and privately\nas were their mines, to and for their own private purposes, and upon\nwhich public territory no man might enter for either public or private\npurpose, save and except by the express permission of these private\ncorporations.\n\n\"This right to determine who should enter such so called election\nprecincts, appears from the record to have been exercised as against all\nclasses; merchants, tradesmen or what not, and whether the business of\nsuch person was public or private. Indeed, it appears that in one\ninstance the governor and adjutant general of the state while on\nofficial business, were denied admission to one of these closed camps.\nAnd that on the day of election, the Democratic watchers and challengers\nfor Walsen Mine precinct, one of which was Neelley, the Democratic\ncandidate for sheriff, were forced to seek and secure a detail of\nFederal soldiers to escort them into the precinct and to the polls, and\nthat such soldiers remained as such guard during the day and a part of\nthe night....\n\n\"But if there was any doubt concerning the condition of the closed camps\nand precincts, and the exclusion of representatives of the Democratic\nparty from discussing the issues of the campaign within the precincts\ncomprising the closed camps, it is entirely removed by the testimony of\nthe witness Weitzel, for contestee (Farr). He testified that he was a\nresident of Pueblo, and was manager of the Colorado Fuel and Iron\nCompany; that Rouse, Lester, Ideal, Cameron, Walsen, Pictou and McNally\nare camps under his jurisdiction. That he had general charge of the\ncamps and that there was no company official in Colorado superior to him\nin this respect except the president; that the superintendent and other\nemploy\u00c3\u00a9s are under his supervision; that the Federal troops came about\nthe 1st of May, 1914, and continued until January, 1915. That in all\nthose camps he tried to keep out the people who were antagonistic to the\ncompany's interests; that it was private property and so treated by his\ncompany; that through him the company and its officials assumed to\nexercise authority as to who might or who might not enter; that if\npersons could assure or satisfy the man at the gate, or the\nsuperintendent that they were not connected with the United Mine\nWorkers, or in their employ as agitators, they were let into the camp.\nThat 'no one we were fighting against got in for social intercourse or\nany other'; that he and officials under him assumed to pass upon the\nquestion of whether or not any person coming there came for the purpose\nof agitation. That Mr. Mitchell, the chairman of the Democratic\ncommittee, as he recalled it, was identified with the agitators, ran a\nnewspaper and was connected either directly or indirectly with the\nUnited Mine Workers; that Mr. Neelley, Democratic candidate for sheriff,\nwas identified with the strikers, and that he would be considered as an\nobjectionable character. That when the Federal troops came, they\nrestored peace and normal conditions; there was no rioting after that,\nthere was no fear on the part of the company when the Federal soldiers\nwere here, except fear of agitation. Asked if he guarded the camp\nagainst discussion, against the espousal of the cause of the company, he\nreplied, 'We didn't encourage it.' The company would not encourage\norganisers to come into the camp, no matter how peacefully they\nconducted themselves; that the company did not permit men to come into\nthe camp to discuss with the employ\u00c3\u00a9s certain principles, or to carry on\narguments with them or to appeal to their reason, or to discuss with\nthem things along reasonable lines, because it was known from experience\nthat if they were allowed to come in they would resort to threats of\nviolence. They might not resort to any violence at the time, but it\nmight result in the people becoming frightened and leaving, and they\nwere anxious to hold their employ\u00c3\u00a9s. He was asked whether or not one had\nbusiness there depended upon the decision of the official in charge; he\nreplied that the superintendent probably would inquire of him what his\nbusiness was. That any one that Farr asked for a permit to enter the\ncamp would likely get it....\n\n\"There was but one attempt to hold a political meeting in the closed\nprecincts. Joseph Patterson, who attempted to hold this meeting,\ntestifies concerning it as follows:\n\n\"Was at a political meeting at Oakview. Had been a warm, personal friend\nof Mr. Jones, the assistant superintendent of the Oakview mine, and had\nwritten him a letter asking the courtesy of holding a political meeting.\nOn Saturday evening received a letter that he could hold such meeting.\nOn the day previous to the meeting witness received a 'phone message\nfrom the assistant superintendent, in which the latter inquired whether\nwitness was coming up there to cause any trouble, and witness replied,\ncertainly not, and if the superintendent felt that way they would not\ncome. Had advised the superintendent that he and others were going to\nhold a political meeting for the Democratic party. Jones, the\nsuperintendent, stated that witness should come to the office that night\nbefore he went to the school house for the purpose of the meeting; when\nwitness arrived at the meeting there were about six or eight English\nspeaking people and a dozen to fourteen Mexicans. The superintendent,\nMr. Morgan, and Mr. Price, were outside of the door most of the time.\nWitness noticed that the first few fellows that came toward the school\nhouse, the superintendent stopped and talked with them and they turned\nback to the camp. This happened several times: as soon as they talked\nwith Morgan they turned back. After he saw that, witness went into the\nschool house and said that it was no use to hold any meeting; that it\nseemed that nobody was allowed to come. This meeting was supposed to be\nin a public school house on the company property. Had to get permission\nfrom the superintendent of the Oakview mining Company to hold said\npolitical meeting.\"....\n\n\"It appears that the number of registered voters in the closed precincts\nwas very largely in excess of the number of votes cast, and this of\nitself was sufficient to demand an open and fair investigation as to the\nqualifications of the alleged voters.\n\n\"It appears from the testimony that in these closed precincts many of\nthose who voted were unable to speak or read the English language, and\nthat in numerous instances, the election judges assisted such, by\nmarking the ballots for them in violation of the law. Again, it appears\nthat the ballots were printed so that.... (The decision here goes on to\nexplain in detail a device whereby the ballot was so printed that voting\ncould be controlled with the help of a card device.) Thus such voters\nwere not choosing candidates, but, under the direction of the companies,\nwere simply placing the cross where they found the particular letter R\non the ballot, so that the ballot was not an expression of opinion or\njudgment, not an intelligent exercise of suffrage, but plainly a\ndictated coal company vote, as much so as if the agents of these\ncompanies had marked the ballots without the intervention of the voter.\nNo more fraudulent and infamous prostitution of the ballot is\nconceivable....\n\n\"Counsel contend that the closed precincts were an 'industrial\nnecessity,' and for such reason the conduct of the coal companies during\nthe campaign was justified. However such conduct may be viewed when\nconfined to the private property of such corporations in their private\noperation, the fact remains that there is no justification when they\nwere dealing with such territory after it had been dedicated to a public\nuse, and particularly involving the right of the people to exercise\ntheir duties and powers as electors in a popular government.\n\n\"The fact appears that the members of the board of county commissioners\nand all other county officers were Republicans, and as stated by counsel\nfor the contestees, the success of the Republican candidates was\nconsidered by the coal companies, vital to their interests. The close\nrelationship of the coal companies and the Republican officials and\ncandidates appears to have been so marked both before and during the\ncampaign, as to justify the conclusion that such officers regarded their\nduty to the coal companies as paramount to their duty to the public\nservice. To say that the closed precincts were not so created to suit\nthe convenience and interests of these corporations, or that they were\nnot so formed with the advice and consent of these corporations, is to\ndiscredit human intelligence, and to deny human experience. The plain\npurpose of the formation of the new precincts was that the coal\ncompanies might have opportunity to conduct and control the elections\ntherein, just as such elections were conducted. The irresistible\nconclusion is that these close precincts were so formed by the county\ncommissioners with the connivance of the representatives of the coal\ncompanies, if not by their express command.\n\n\"There can be no free, open and fair election as contemplated by the\nconstitution, where private industrial corporations so throttle public\nopinion, deny the free exercise of choice by sovereign electors, dictate\nand control all election officers, prohibit public discussion of public\nquestions, and imperially command what citizens may and what citizens\nmay not, peacefully and for lawful purposes, enter upon election or\npublic territory....\n\n\"We find no such example of fraud within the books, and must seek the\nletter and spirit of the law in a free government, as a scale in which\nto weigh such conduct....\n\n\"The denial of the right of peaceful assemblage, can have been for no\nother purpose than to influence the election. There was no disturbance\nin any of these precincts after they were created, up to the time of the\nelection, and up to the time of this trial. The Federal troops were\npresent at all times to preserve the peace and to protect life and\nproperty. There was no reason to anticipate any disturbance. Therefore\nthis bold denial was an inexcusable and corrupt violation of the natural\nand inalienable rights of the citizens.\n\n\"The defence relies not upon conflicting evidence, but upon the\ncontention that the conduct of the election was justified as an\n'industrial necessity.'\n\n\"We have heard much in this state in recent years as to the denial of\ninherent and constitutional rights of citizens being justified by\n'military necessity,' but this we believe is the first time in our\nexperience when the violation of the fundamental rights of freemen has\nbeen attempted to be justified by the plea of 'industrial necessity.'\n\n\"Even if we were to concede that there may be some palliation in the\nplea of military necessity on the theory that such acts purport to be\nacts of the government itself, through its military arm and with the\npurpose of preserving the public peace and safety: yet that a private\ncorporation, with its privately armed forces, may violate the most\nsacred right of the citizenship of the state and find lawful excuse in\nthe plea of private 'industrial necessity' savours too much of anarchy\nto find approval by courts of justice.\n\n\"This case clearly comes within another exception to the rule, in that\nit is plain that the findings were influenced by the bias and prejudice\nof the trial judge.\n\n\"A careful reading of the record discloses the rejection by the court of\nso much palpably pertinent and competent testimony offered by the\ncontestors, as to force the conclusion that the trial judge was\ninfluenced by bias and prejudice, to the extent at least, charged in the\napplication for a change of venue, and sufficient in itself to justify a\nreversal of judgment....\n\n\"For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the court in each case before\nus, is reversed, and the entire poll in the said precincts of\nNiggerhead, Ravenwood, Walsen Mine, Oakview, Pryor, Rouse and Cameron is\nannulled, and held for naught, and the election in each of said\nprecincts is hereby set aside. This leaves a substantial and\nunquestioned majority for each of the contestors in the county, and\nwhich entitles each contestor to be declared elected to the office for\nwhich he was a candidate.\n\n\"We find further, that J. B. Farr, the defendant in error, was not and\nis not the duly elected sheriff of Huerfano county, and that E. L.\nNeelley, the plaintiff in error, was and is the duly elected sheriff of\nsaid county. It is therefore ordered that the said county, and that the\nsaid E. L. Neelley, immediately and upon qualification as required by\nlaw, enter and discharge the duties of the said office of sheriff of\nHuerfano county....\"\n\nSo much for the court opinion upon coal-camp politics. In relation\nthereto, the writer has only one comment to offer. Let the reader not\ndrop the matter with the idea that because one set of corrupt officials\nhave been turned out of office in one American county, therefore justice\nhas been vindicated, and there is no longer need to be concerned about\nthe conditions portrayed in \"King Coal.\" The defeat of the \"King of\nHuerfano County\" is but one step in a long road which the miners of\nColorado have to travel if ever they are to be free men. The industrial\npower of the great corporations remains untouched by this decision; and\nthis power is greater than any political power ever wielded by the\ngovernment of Huerfano County, or even of the state of Colorado. This\nindustrial power is a deep, far-spreading root; and so long as it is\nallowed to thrive, it will send up again and again the poisonous plant\nof political \"malconduct, fraud and corruption.\" The citizens and\nworkers of such industrial communities, whether in Colorado, in West\nVirginia, Alabama, Michigan or Minnesota, in the Chicago stock-yards,\nthe steel-mills of Pittsburg, the woollen-mills of Lawrence or the\nsilk-mills of Paterson, will find that they have neither peace nor\nfreedom, until they have abolished the system of production for profit,\nand established in the field of industry what they are supposed to have\nalready in the field of politics--a government of the people, by the\npeople, for the people.\n\nNOTE: On the day that the author finished the reading of the proofs of\n\"King Coal,\" the following item appeared in his daily newspaper:\n\nCOLORADO MINE WORKERS ASK LEAVE TO STRIKE\n\n[BY A. P. NIGHT WIRE]\n\nDENVER (Colo.), June 14.--Officers of the United Mine Workers\nrepresenting members of that organisation employed by the Colorado Fuel\nand Iron Company, have telegraphed their national officers asking\npermission to strike.\n\nAt the morning session a resolution was adopted expressing\ndisapprobation of the action of J. F. Welborn, president of the fuel\ncompany, for failure to attend the meeting, which was a part of the\n\"peace programme\" to prevent industrial differences in the State during\nthe war.\n\nThe grievances of the men, according to John McLennan, spokesman for\nthem, centre about the operation of the so-called \"Rockefeller plan\" at\nthe mines. McLennan said the failure of Mr. Welborn to attend the\nmeeting and discuss these grievances with the men precipitated the\nstrike agitation.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of King Coal, by Upton Sinclair\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK KING COAL ***\n\n***** This file should be named 7522-8.txt or 7522-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/7\/5\/2\/7522\/\n\nProduced by Eric Eldred, Beth Trapaga and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":111,"split":"train"}
