Julio turns out to be a spoiled, lazy young man who avoids commitments and flirts with a married woman named Marguerite Laurier.\nMeanwhile, Madariaga's younger daughter has married a German man named Karl Hartrott, and the Hartrotts move back to Germany. The Desnoyers family and the Hartrott family are thus set against each other with the onset of World War I.

The change of\nthe seasons was at this time greatly confused in his mind, and evidently\ndemanded some readjustment.\n\nFive months had passed since their last interview in this square had\nafforded the wandering lovers the refuge of a damp, depressing calmness\nnear a boulevard of continual movement close to a great railroad\nstation. The hour of the appointment was always five and Julio was\naccustomed to see his beloved approaching by the reflection of the\nrecently lit street lamps, her figure enveloped in furs, and holding\nher muff before her face as if it were a half-mask. Her sweet voice,\ngreeting him, had breathed forth a cloud of vapor, white and tenuous,\ncongealed by the cold. After various hesitating interviews, they had\nabandoned the garden. Their love had acquired the majestic importance of\nacknowledged fact, and from five to seven had taken refuge in the fifth\nfloor of the rue de la Pompe where Julio had an artist's studio. The\ncurtains well drawn over the double glass windows, the cosy hearth-fire\nsending forth its ruddy flame as the only light of the room, the\nmonotonous song of the samovar bubbling near the cups of tea--all\nthe seclusion of life isolated by an idolizing love--had dulled their\nperceptions to the fact that the afternoons were growing longer, that\noutside the sun was shining later and later into the pearl-covered\ndepths of the clouds, and that a timid and pallid Spring was beginning\nto show its green finger tips in the buds of the branches suffering the\nlast nips of Winter--that wild, black boar who so often turned on his\ntracks.\n\nThen Julio had made his trip to Buenos Aires, encountering in the other\nhemisphere the last smile of Autumn and the first icy winds from the\npampas. And just as his mind was becoming reconciled to the fact that\nfor him Winter was an eternal season--since it always came to meet\nhim in his change of domicile from one extreme of the planet to the\nother--lo, Summer was unexpectedly confronting him in this dreary\ngarden!\n\nA swarm of children was racing and screaming through the short avenues\naround the monument. On entering the place, the first thing that Julio\nencountered was a hoop which came rolling toward his legs, trundled by\na childish hand. Then he stumbled over a ball. Around the chestnut\ntrees was gathering the usual warm-weather crowd, seeking the blue shade\nperforated with points of light. Many nurse-maids from the neighboring\nhouses were working and chattering here, following with indifferent\nglances the rough games of the children confided to their care. Near\nthem were the men who had brought their papers down into the garden\nunder the impression that they could read them in the midst of peaceful\ngroves. All of the benches were full. A few women were occupying camp\nstools with that feeling of superiority which ownership always confers.\nThe iron chairs, \"pay-seats,\" were serving as resting places for\nvarious suburban dames, loaded down with packages, who were waiting for\nstraggling members of their families in order to take the train in the\nGare Saint Lazare. . . .\n\nAnd Julio, in his special delivery letter, had proposed meeting in this\nplace, supposing that it would be as little frequented as in former\ntimes. She, too, with the same thoughtlessness, had in her reply, set\nthe usual hour of five o'clock, believing that after passing a few\nminutes in the Printemps or the Galeries on the pretext of shopping, she\nwould be able to slip over to the unfrequented garden without risk of\nbeing seen by any of her numerous acquaintances.\n\nDesnoyers was enjoying an almost forgotten sensation, that of strolling\nthrough vast spaces, crushing as he walked the grains of sand under\nhis feet. For the past twenty days his rovings had been upon planks,\nfollowing with the automatic precision of a riding school the oval\npromenade on the deck of a ship. His feet accustomed to insecure\nground, still were keeping on terra firma a certain sensation of elastic\nunsteadiness. His goings and comings were not awakening the curiosity of\nthe people seated in the open, for a common preoccupation seemed to\nbe monopolizing all the men and women. The groups were exchanging\nimpressions. Those who happened to have a paper in their hands, saw\ntheir neighbors approaching them with a smile of interrogation. There\nhad suddenly disappeared that distrust and suspicion which impels the\ninhabitants of large cities mutually to ignore one another, taking each\nother's measure at a glance as though they were enemies.\n\n\"They are talking about the war,\" said Desnoyers to himself. \"At this\ntime, all Paris speaks of nothing but the possibility of war.\"\n\nOutside of the garden he could see also the same anxiety which was\nmaking those around him so fraternal and sociable. The venders of\nnewspapers were passing through the boulevard crying the evening\neditions, their furious speed repeatedly slackened by the eager hands\nof the passers-by contending for the papers. Every reader was instantly\nsurrounded by a group begging for news or trying to decipher over his\nshoulder the great headlines at the top of the sheet. In the rue des\nMathurins, on the other side of the square, a circle of workmen under\nthe awning of a tavern were listening to the comments of a friend who\naccompanied his words with oratorical gestures and wavings of the paper.\nThe traffic in the streets, the general bustle of the city was the same\nas in other days, but it seemed to Julio that the vehicles were whirling\npast more rapidly, that there was a feverish agitation in the air and\nthat people were speaking and smiling in a different way. The women of\nthe garden were looking even at him as if they had seen him in former\ndays. He was able to approach them and begin a conversation without\nexperiencing the slightest strangeness.\n\n\"They are talking of the war,\" he said again but with the commiseration\nof a superior intelligence which foresees the future and feels above the\nimpressions of the vulgar crowd.\n\nHe knew exactly what course he was going to follow. He had disembarked\nat ten o'clock the night before, and as it was not yet twenty-four hours\nsince he had touched land, his mentality was still that of a man who\ncomes from afar, across oceanic immensities, from boundless horizons,\nand is surprised at finding himself in touch with the preoccupations\nwhich govern human communities. After disembarking he had spent two\nhours in a cafe in Boulogne, listlessly watching the middle-class\nfamilies who passed their time in the monotonous placidity of a life\nwithout dangers. Then the special train for the passengers from South\nAmerica had brought him to Paris, leaving him at four in the morning\non a platform of the Gare du Nord in the embrace of Pepe Argensola, the\nyoung Spaniard whom he sometimes called \"my secretary\" or \"my valet\"\nbecause it was difficult to define exactly the relationship between\nthem. In reality, he was a mixture of friend and parasite, the poor\ncomrade, complacent and capable in his companionship with a rich youth\non bad terms with his family, sharing with him the ups and downs\nof fortune, picking up the crumbs of prosperous days, or inventing\nexpedients to keep up appearances in the hours of poverty.\n\n\"What about the war?\" Argensola had asked him before inquiring about the\nresult of his trip. \"You have come a long ways and should know much.\"\n\nSoon he was sound asleep in his dear old bed while his \"secretary\" was\npacing up and down the studio talking of Servia, Russia and the Kaiser.\nThis youth, too, skeptical as he generally was about everything not\nconnected with his own interests, appeared infected by the general\nexcitement.\n\nWhen Desnoyers awoke he found her note awaiting him, setting their\nmeeting at five that afternoon and also containing a few words about the\nthreatened danger which was claiming the attention of all Paris. Upon\ngoing out in search of lunch the concierge, on the pretext of welcoming\nhim back, had asked him the war news. And in the restaurant, the cafe\nand the street, always war . . . the possibility of war with\nGermany. . . .\n\nJulio was an optimist. What did all this restlessness signify to a man\nwho had just been living more than twenty days among Germans, crossing\nthe Atlantic under the flag of the Empire?\n\nHe had sailed from Buenos Aires in a steamer of the Hamburg line, the\nKoenig Frederic August. The world was in blessed tranquillity when\nthe boat left port. Only the whites and half-breeds of Mexico were\nexterminating each other in conflicts in order that nobody might believe\nthat man is an animal degenerated by peace. On the rest of the\nplanet, the people were displaying unusual prudence. Even aboard the\ntransatlantic liner, the little world of passengers of most diverse\nnationalities appeared a fragment of future society implanted by way of\nexperiment in modern times--a sketch of the hereafter, without frontiers\nor race antagonisms.\n\nOne morning the ship band which every Sunday had sounded the Choral of\nLuther, awoke those sleeping in the first-class cabins with the most\nunheard-of serenade. Desnoyers rubbed his eyes believing himself\nunder the hallucinations of a dream. The German horns were playing the\nMarseillaise through the corridors and decks. The steward, smiling at\nhis astonishment, said, \"The fourteenth of July!\" On the German steamers\nthey celebrate as their own the great festivals of all the nations\nrepresented by their cargo and passengers. Their captains are careful\nto observe scrupulously the rites of this religion of the flag and its\nhistoric commemoration. The most insignificant republic saw the ship\ndecked in its honor, affording one more diversion to help combat the\nmonotony of the voyage and further the lofty ends of the Germanic\npropaganda. For the first time the great festival of France was being\ncelebrated on a German vessel, and whilst the musicians continued\nescorting a racy Marseillaise in double quick time through the different\nfloors, the morning groups were commenting on the event.\n\n\"What finesse!\" exclaimed the South American ladies. \"These Germans are\nnot so phlegmatic as they seem. It is an attention . . . something very\ndistinguished. . . . And is it possible that some still believe that\nthey and the French might come to blows?\"\n\nThe very few Frenchmen who were travelling on the steamer found\nthemselves admired as though they had increased immeasurably in public\nesteem. There were only three;--an old jeweller who had been visiting\nhis branch shops in America, and two demi-mondaines from the rue de\nla Paix, the most timid and well-behaved persons aboard, vestals with\nbright eyes and disdainful noses who held themselves stiffly aloof in\nthis uncongenial atmosphere.\n\nAt night there was a gala banquet in the dining room at the end of which\nthe French flag and that of the Empire formed a flaunting, conspicuous\ndrapery. All the German passengers were in dress suits, and their wives\nwere wearing low-necked gowns. The uniforms of the attendants were as\nresplendent as on a day of a grand review.\n\nDuring dessert the tapping of a knife upon a glass reduced the table\nto sudden silence. The Commandant was going to speak. And this brave\nmariner who united to his nautical functions the obligation of making\nharangues at banquets and opening the dance with the lady of most\nimportance, began unrolling a string of words like the noise of clappers\nbetween long intervals of silence. Desnoyers knew a little German as\na souvenir of a visit to some relatives in Berlin, and so was able\nto catch a few words. The Commandant was repeating every few minutes\n\"peace\" and \"friends.\" A table neighbor, a commercial commissioner,\noffered his services as interpreter to Julio, with that obsequiousness\nwhich lives on advertisement.\n\n\"The Commandant asks God to maintain peace between Germany and France\nand hopes that the two peoples will become increasingly friendly.\"\n\nAnother orator arose at the same table. He was the most influential of\nthe German passengers, a rich manufacturer from Dusseldorf who had just\nbeen visiting his agents in America. He was never mentioned by name. He\nbore the title of Commercial Counsellor, and among his countrymen was\nalways Herr Comerzienrath and his wife was entitled Frau Rath. The\nCounsellor's Lady, much younger than her important husband, had from\nthe first attracted the attention of Desnoyers. She, too, had made an\nexception in favor of this young Argentinian, abdicating her title from\ntheir first conversation. \"Call me Bertha,\" she said as condescendingly\nas a duchess of Versailles might have spoken to a handsome abbot seated\nat her feet. Her husband, also protested upon hearing Desnoyers call him\n\"Counsellor,\" like his compatriots.\n\n\"My friends,\" he said, \"call me 'Captain.' I command a company of the\nLandsturm.\" And the air with which the manufacturer accompanied these\nwords, revealed the melancholy of an unappreciated man scorning the\nhonors he has in order to think only of those he does not possess.\n\nWhile he was delivering his discourse, Julio was examining his small\nhead and thick neck which gave him a certain resemblance to a bull dog.\nIn imagination he saw the high and oppressive collar of a uniform making\na double roll of fat above its stiff edge. The waxed, upright moustaches\nwere bristling aggressively. His voice was sharp and dry as though\nhe were shaking out his words. . . . Thus the Emperor would utter his\nharangues, so the martial burgher, with instinctive imitation, was\ncontracting his left arm, supporting his hand upon the hilt of an\ninvisible sword.\n\nIn spite of his fierce and oratorical gesture of command, all the\nlistening Germans laughed uproariously at his first words, like men who\nknew how to appreciate the sacrifice of a Herr Comerzienrath when he\ndeigns to divert a festivity.\n\n\"He is saying very witty things about the French,\" volunteered the\ninterpreter in a low voice, \"but they are not offensive.\"\n\nJulio had guessed as much upon hearing repeatedly the word Franzosen.\nHe almost understood what the orator was saying--\"Franzosen--great\nchildren, light-hearted, amusing, improvident. The things that they\nmight do together if they would only forget past grudges!\" The attentive\nGermans were no longer laughing. The Counsellor was laying aside his\nirony, that grandiloquent, crushing irony, weighing many tons, as\nenormous as a ship. Then he began unrolling the serious part of his\nharangue, so that he himself, was also greatly affected.\n\n\"He says, sir,\" reported Julio's neighbor, \"that he wishes France\nto become a very great nation so that some day we may march together\nagainst other enemies . . . against OTHERS!\"\n\nAnd he winked one eye, smiling maliciously with that smile of common\nintelligence which this allusion to the mysterious enemy always\nawakened.\n\nFinally the Captain-Counsellor raised his glass in a toast to France.\n\"Hoch!\" he yelled as though he were commanding an evolution of his\nsoldierly Reserves. Three times he sounded the cry and all the German\ncontingent springing to their feet, responded with a lusty Hoch while\nthe band in the corridor blared forth the Marseillaise.\n\nDesnoyers was greatly moved. Thrills of enthusiasm were coursing up\nand down his spine. His eyes became so moist that, when drinking his\nchampagne, he almost believed that he had swallowed some tears. He\nbore a French name. He had French blood in his veins, and this that the\ngringoes were doing--although generally they seemed to him ridiculous\nand ordinary--was really worth acknowledging. The subjects of the Kaiser\ncelebrating the great date of the Revolution! He believed that he was\nwitnessing a great historic event.\n\n\"Very well done!\" he said to the other South Americans at the near\ntables. \"We must admit that they have done the handsome thing.\"\n\nThen with the vehemence of his twenty-seven years, he accosted the\njeweller in the passage way, reproaching him for his silence. He was\nthe only French citizen aboard. He should have made a few words of\nacknowledgment. The fiesta was ending awkwardly through his fault.\n\n\"And why have you not spoken as a son of France?\" retorted the jeweller.\n\n\"I am an Argentinian citizen,\" replied Julio.\n\nAnd he left the older man believing that he ought to have spoken and\nmaking explanations to those around him. It was a very dangerous thing,\nhe protested, to meddle in diplomatic affairs. Furthermore, he had not\ninstructions from his government. And for a few hours he believed that\nhe had been on the point of playing a great role in history.\n\nDesnoyers passed the rest of the evening in the smoking room attracted\nthither by the presence of the Counsellor's Lady. The Captain of the\nLandsturm, sticking a preposterous cigar between his moustachios, was\nplaying poker with his countrymen ranking next to him in dignity and\nriches. His wife stayed beside him most of the time, watching the goings\nand comings of the stewards carrying great bocks, without daring to\nshare in this tremendous consumption of beer. Her special preoccupation\nwas to keep vacant near her a seat which Desnoyers might occupy. She\nconsidered him the most distinguished man on board because he was\naccustomed to taking champagne with all his meals. He was of medium\nheight, a decided brunette, with a small foot, which obliged her to tuck\nhers under her skirts, and a triangular face under two masses of hair,\nstraight, black and glossy as lacquer, the very opposite of the type of\nmen about her. Besides, he was living in Paris, in the city which she\nhad never seen after numerous trips in both hemispheres.\n\n\"Oh, Paris! Paris!\" she sighed, opening her eyes and pursing her lips\nin order to express her admiration when she was speaking alone to the\nArgentinian. \"How I should love to go there!\"\n\nAnd in order that he might feel free to tell her things about Paris, she\npermitted herself certain confidences about the pleasures of Berlin, but\nwith a blushing modesty, admitting in advance that in the world there\nwas more--much more--that she wished to become acquainted with.\n\nWhile pacing around the Chapelle Expiatoire, Julio recalled with a\ncertain remorse the wife of Counsellor Erckmann. He who had made the\ntrip to America for a woman's sake, in order to collect money and marry\nher! Then he immediately began making excuses for his conduct. Nobody\nwas going to know. Furthermore he did not pretend to be an ascetic, and\nBertha Erckmann was certainly a tempting adventure in mid ocean. Upon\nrecalling her, his imagination always saw a race horse--large, spare,\nroan colored, and with a long stride. She was an up-to-date German who\nadmitted no defect in her country except the excessive weight of its\nwomen, combating in her person this national menace with every known\nsystem of dieting. For her every meal was a species of torment, and\nthe procession of bocks in the smoking room a tantalizing agony.\nThe slenderness achieved and maintained by will power only made more\nprominent the size of her frame, the powerful skeleton with heavy jaws\nand large teeth, strong and dazzling, which perhaps suggested Desnoyers'\ndisrespectful comparison. \"She is thin, but enormous, nevertheless!\" was\nalways his conclusion.\n\nBut then, he considered her, notwithstanding, the most distinguished\nwoman on board--distinguished for the sea--elegant in the style of\nMunich, with clothes of indescribable colors that suggested Persian art\nand the vignettes of mediaeval manuscripts. The husband admired Bertha's\nelegance, lamenting her childlessness in secret, almost as though it\nwere a crime of high treason. Germany was magnificent because of the\nfertility of its women. The Kaiser, with his artistic hyperbole, had\nproclaimed that the true German beauty should have a waist measure of at\nleast a yard and a half.\n\nWhen Desnoyers entered into the smoking room in order to take the\nseat which Bertha had reserved for him, her husband and his wealthy\nhangers-on had their pack of cards lying idle upon the green felt. Herr\nRath was continuing his discourse and his listeners, taking their cigars\nfrom their mouths, were emitting grunts of approbation. The arrival of\nJulio provoked a general smile of amiability. Here was France coming\nto fraternize with them. They knew that his father was French, and\nthat fact made him as welcome as though he came in direct line from the\npalace of the Quai d'Orsay, representing the highest diplomacy of the\nRepublic. The craze for proselyting made them all promptly concede to\nhim unlimited importance.\n\n\"We,\" continued the Counsellor looking fixedly at Desnoyers as if he\nwere expecting a solemn declaration from him, \"we wish to live on good\nterms with France.\"\n\nThe youth nodded his head so as not to appear inattentive. It appeared\nto him a very good thing that these peoples should not be enemies, and\nas far as he was concerned, they might affirm this relationship as often\nas they wished: the only thing that was interesting him just at\nthat time was a certain knee that was seeking his under the table,\ntransmitting its gentle warmth through a double curtain of silk.\n\n\"But France,\" complained the manufacturer, \"is most unresponsive towards\nus. For many years past, our Emperor has been holding out his hand with\nnoble loyalty, but she pretends not to see it. . . . That, you must\nadmit, is not as it should be.\"\n\nJust here Desnoyers believed that he ought to say something in order\nthat the spokesman might not divine his more engrossing occupation.\n\n\"Perhaps you are not doing enough. If, first of all, you would return\nthat which you took away from France!\" . . .\n\nStupefied silence followed this remark, as if the alarm signal had\nsounded through the boat. Some of those who were about putting their\ncigars in their mouths, remained with hands immovable within two inches\nof their lips, their eyes almost popping out of their heads. But the\nCaptain of the Landsturm was there to formulate their mute protest.\n\n\"Return!\" he said in a voice almost extinguished by the sudden swelling\nof his neck. \"We have nothing to return, for we have taken nothing. That\nwhich we possess, we acquire by our heroism.\"\n\nThe hidden knee with its agreeable friction made itself more\ninsinuating, as though counselling the youth to greater prudence.\n\n\"Do not say such things,\" breathed Bertha, \"thus only the republicans,\ncorrupted by Paris, talk. A youth so distinguished who has been in\nBerlin, and has relatives in Germany!\" . . .\n\nBut Desnoyers felt a hereditary impulse of aggressiveness before each\nof her husband's statements, enunciated in haughty tones, and responded\ncoldly:--\n\n\"It is as if I should take your watch and then propose that we should be\nfriends, forgetting the occurrence. Although you might forget, the first\nthing for me to do would be to return the watch.\"\n\nCounsellor Erckmann wished to retort with so many things at once that he\nstuttered horribly, leaping from one idea to the other. To compare the\nreconquest of Alsace to a robbery. A German country! The race . . . the\nlanguage . . . the history! . . .\n\n\"But when did they announce their wish to be German?\" asked the youth\nwithout losing his calmness. \"When have you consulted their opinion?\"\n\nThe Counsellor hesitated, not knowing whether to argue with this\ninsolent fellow or crush him with his scorn.\n\n\"Young man, you do not know what you are talking about,\" he finally\nblustered with withering contempt. \"You are an Argentinian and do not\nunderstand the affairs of Europe.\"\n\nAnd the others agreed, suddenly repudiating the citizenship which\nthey had attributed to him a little while before. The Counsellor, with\nmilitary rudeness, brusquely turned his back upon him, and taking up\nthe pack, distributed the cards. The game was renewed. Desnoyers, seeing\nhimself isolated by the scornful silence, felt greatly tempted to break\nup the playing by violence; but the hidden knee continued counselling\nself-control, and an invisible hand had sought his right, pressing\nit sweetly. That was enough to make him recover his serenity. The\nCounsellor's Lady seemed to be absorbed in the progress of the game. He\nalso looked on, a malignant smile contracting slightly the lines of his\nmouth as he was mentally ejaculating by way of consolation, \"Captain,\nCaptain! . . . You little know what is awaiting you!\"\n\nOn terra firma, he would never again have approached these men; but life\non a transatlantic liner, with its inevitable promiscuousness, obliges\nforgetfulness. The following day the Counsellor and his friends came in\nsearch of him, flattering his sensibilities by erasing every irritating\nmemory. He was a distinguished youth belonging to a wealthy family, and\nall of them had shops and business in his country. The only thing was\nthat he should be careful not to mention his French origin. He was an\nArgentinian; and thereupon, the entire chorus interested itself in the\ngrandeur of his country and all the nations of South America where they\nhad agencies or investments--exaggerating its importance as though its\npetty republics were great powers, commenting with gravity upon the\ndeeds and words of its political leaders and giving him to understand\nthat in Germany there was no one who was not concerned about the\nfuture of South America, predicting for all its divisions most glorious\nprosperity--a reflex of the Empire, always, provided, of course, that\nthey kept under Germanic influence.\n\nIn spite of these flatteries, Desnoyers was no longer presenting himself\nwith his former assiduity at the hour of poker. The Counsellor's wife\nwas retiring to her stateroom earlier than usual--their approach to the\nEquator inducing such an irresistible desire for sleep, that she had\nto abandon her husband to his card playing. Julio also had mysterious\noccupations which prevented his appearance on deck until after midnight.\nWith the precipitation of a man who desires to be seen in order to avoid\nsuspicion, he was accustomed to enter the smoking room talking loudly as\nhe seated himself near the husband and his boon companions.\n\nThe game had ended, and an orgy of beer and fat cigars from Hamburg\nwas celebrating the success of the winners. It was the hour of Teutonic\nexpansion, of intimacy among men, of heavy, sluggish jokes, of off-color\nstories. The Counsellor was presiding with much majesty over the\ndiableries of his chums, prudent business men from the Hanseatic ports\nwho had big accounts in the Deutsche Bank or were shopkeepers installed\nin the republic of the La Plata, with an innumerable family. He was a\nwarrior, a captain, and on applauding every heavy jest with a laugh that\ndistended his fat neck, he fancied that he was among his comrades at\narms.\n\nIn honor of the South Americans who, tired of pacing the deck, had\ndropped in to hear what the gringoes were saying, they were turning into\nSpanish the witticisms and licentious anecdotes awakened in the memory\nby a superabundance of beer. Julio was marvelling at the ready laugh of\nall these men. While the foreigners were remaining unmoved, they would\nbreak forth into loud horse-laughs throwing themselves back in their\nseats. And when the German audience was growing cold, the story-teller\nwould resort to an infallible expedient to remedy his lack of success:--\n\n\"They told this yarn to the Kaiser, and when the Kaiser heard it he\nlaughed heartily.\"\n\nIt was not necessary to say more. They all laughed then. Ha, ha, ha!\nwith a spontaneous roar but a short one, a laugh in three blows, since\nto prolong it, might be interpreted as a lack of respect to His Majesty.\n\nAs they neared Europe, a batch of news came to meet the boat. The\nemployees in the wireless telegraphy office were working incessantly.\nOne night, on entering the smoking room, Desnoyers saw the German\nnotables gesticulating with animated countenances. They were no longer\ndrinking beer. They had had bottles of champagne uncorked, and the\nCounsellor's Lady, much impressed, had not retired to her stateroom.\nCaptain Erckmann, spying the young Argentinian, offered him a glass.\n\n\"It is war,\" he shouted with enthusiasm. \"War at last. . . . The hour\nhas come!\"\n\nDesnoyers made a gesture of astonishment. War! . . . What war? . . .\nLike all the others, he had read on the news bulletin outside\na radiogram stating that the Austrian government had just sent an\nultimatum to Servia; but it made not the slightest impression on him,\nfor he was not at all interested in the Balkan affairs. Those were but\nthe quarrels of a miserable little nation monopolizing the attention of\nthe world, distracting it from more worthwhile matters. How could this\nevent concern the martial Counsellor? The two nations would soon come to\nan understanding. Diplomacy sometimes amounted to something.\n\n\"No,\" insisted the German ferociously. \"It is war, blessed war. Russia\nwill sustain Servia, and we will support our ally. . . . What will\nFrance do? Do you know what France will do?\" . . .\n\nJulio shrugged his shoulders testily as though asking to be left out of\nall international discussions.\n\n\"It is war,\" asserted the Counsellor, \"the preventive war that we need.\nRussia is growing too fast, and is preparing to fight us. Four years\nmore of peace and she will have finished her strategic railroads, and\nher military power, united to that of her allies, will be worth as much\nas ours. It is better to strike a powerful blow now. It is necessary to\ntake advantage of this opportunity. . . . War. Preventive war!\"\n\nAll his clan were listening in silence. Some did not appear to feel the\ncontagion of his enthusiasm. War! . . . In imagination they saw their\nbusiness paralyzed, their agencies bankrupt, the banks cutting down\ncredit . . . a catastrophe more frightful to them than the slaughters\nof battles. But they applauded with nods and grunts all of Erckmann's\nferocious demonstrations. He was a Herr Rath, and an officer besides.\nHe must be in the secrets of the destiny of his country, and that was\nenough to make them drink silently to the success of the war.\n\nJulio thought that the Counsellor and his admirers must be drunk. \"Look\nhere, Captain,\" he said in a conciliatory tone, \"what you say lacks\nlogic. How could war possibly be acceptable to industrial Germany? Every\nmoment its business is increasing, every month it conquers a new\nmarket and every year its commercial balance soars upward in unheard of\nproportions. Sixty years ago, it had to man its boats with Berlin\nhack drivers arrested by the police. Now its commercial fleets and war\nvessels cross all oceans, and there is no port where the German merchant\nmarine does not occupy the greatest part of the docks. It would only be\nnecessary to continue living in this way, to put yourselves beyond the\nexigencies of war! Twenty years more of peace, and the Germans would be\nlords of the world's commerce, conquering England, the former mistress\nof the seas, in a bloodless struggle. And are they going to risk all\nthis--like a gambler who stakes his entire fortune on a single card--in\na struggle that might result unfavorably?\" . . .\n\n\"No, war,\" insisted the Counsellor furiously, \"preventive war. We live\nsurrounded by our enemies, and this state of things cannot go on. It is\nbest to end it at once. Either they or we! Germany feels herself strong\nenough to challenge the world. We've got to put an end to this Russian\nmenace! And if France doesn't keep herself quiet, so much the worse for\nher! . . . And if anyone else . . . ANYONE dares to come in against us,\nso much the worse for him! When I set up a new machine in my shops, it\nis to make it produce unceasingly. We possess the finest army in the\nworld, and it is necessary to give it exercise that it may not rust\nout.\"\n\nHe then continued with heavy emphasis, \"They have put a band of iron\naround us in order to throttle us. But Germany has a strong chest and\nhas only to expand in order to burst its bands. We must awake before\nthey manacle us in our sleep. Woe to those who then oppose us! . . .\"\n\nDesnoyers felt obliged to reply to this arrogance. He had never seen\nthe iron circle of which the Germans were complaining. The nations were\nmerely unwilling to continue living, unsuspecting and inactive,\nbefore boundless German ambition. They were simply preparing to defend\nthemselves against an almost certain attack. They wished to maintain\ntheir dignity, repeatedly violated under most absurd pretexts.\n\n\"I wonder if it is not the others,\" he concluded, \"who are obliged to\ndefend themselves because you represent a menace to the world!\"\n\nAn invisible hand sought his under the table, as it had some nights\nbefore, to recommend prudence; but now he clasped it forcibly with the\nauthority of a right acquired.\n\n\"Oh, sir!\" sighed the sweet Bertha, \"to talk like that, a youth so\ndistinguished who has . . .\"\n\nShe was not able to finish, for her husband interrupted. They were no\nlonger in American waters, and the Counsellor expressed himself with the\nrudeness of a master of his house.\n\n\"I have the honor to inform you, young man,\" he said, imitating the\ncutting coldness of the diplomats, \"that you are merely a South American\nand know nothing of the affairs of Europe.\"\n\nHe did not call him an \"Indian,\" but Julio heard the implication as\nthough he had used the word itself. Ah, if that hidden handclasp had not\nheld him with its sentimental thrills! . . . But this contact kept him\ncalm and even made him smile. \"Thanks, Captain,\" he said to himself. \"It\nis the least you can do to get even with me!\"\n\nHere his relations with the German and his clientele came to an end. The\nmerchants, as they approached nearer and nearer to their native land,\nbegan casting off that servile desire of ingratiating themselves which\nthey had assumed in all their trips to the new world. They now had more\nimportant things to occupy them. The telegraphic service was working\nwithout cessation. The Commandant of the vessel was conferring in his\napartment with the Counsellor as his compatriot of most importance.\nHis friends were hunting out the most obscure places in order to\ntalk confidentially with one another. Even Bertha commenced to avoid\nDesnoyers. She was still smiling distantly at him, but that smile was\nmore of a souvenir than a reality.\n\nBetween Lisbon and the coast of England, Julio spoke with her husband\nfor the last time. Every morning was appearing on the bulletin board the\nalarming news transmitted by radiograph. The Empire was arming itself\nagainst its enemies. God would punish them, making all manner of\ntroubles fall upon them. Desnoyers was motionless with astonishment\nbefore the last piece of news--\"Three hundred thousand revolutionists\nare now besieging Paris. The suburbs are beginning to burn. The horrors\nof the Commune have broken out again.\"\n\n\"My, but these Germans have gone mad!\" exclaimed the disgusted youth to\nthe curious group surrounding the radio-sheet. \"We are going to lose\nthe little sense that we have left! . . . What revolutionists are they\ntalking about? How could a revolution break out in Paris if the men of\nthe government are not reactionary?\"\n\nA gruff voice sounded behind him, rude, authoritative, as if trying to\nbanish the doubts of the audience. It was the Herr Comerzienrath who was\nspeaking.\n\n\"Young man, these notices are sent us by the first agencies of Germany\n. . . and Germany never lies.\"\n\nAfter this affirmation, he turned his back upon them and they saw him no\nmore.\n\nOn the following morning, the last day of the voyage. Desnoyers' steward\nawoke him in great excitement. \"Herr, come up on deck! a most beautiful\nspectacle!\"\n\nThe sea was veiled by the fog, but behind its hazy curtains could be\ndistinguished some silhouettes like islands with great towers and sharp,\npointed minarets. The islands were advancing over the oily waters slowly\nand majestically, with impressive dignity. Julio counted eighteen. They\nappeared to fill the ocean. It was the Channel Fleet which had just left\nthe English coast by Government order, sailing around simply to show\nits strength. Seeing this procession of dreadnoughts for the first\ntime, Desnoyers was reminded of a flock of marine monsters, and gained\na better idea of the British power. The German ship passed among them,\nshrinking, humiliated, quickening its speed. \"One might suppose,\" mused\nthe youth, \"that she had an uneasy conscience and wished to scud to\nsafety.\" A South American passenger near him was jesting with one of\nthe Germans, \"What if they have already declared war! . . . What if they\nshould make us prisoners!\"\n\nAfter midday, they entered Southampton roads. The Frederic August\nhurried to get away as soon as possible, and transacted business with\ndizzying celerity. The cargo of passengers and baggage was enormous.\nTwo launches approached the transatlantic and discharged an avalanche of\nGermans residents in England who invaded the decks with the joy of those\nwho tread friendly soil, desiring to see Hamburg as soon as possible.\nThen the boat sailed through the Channel with a speed most unusual in\nthese places.\n\nThe people, leaning on the railing, were commenting on the extraordinary\nencounters in this marine boulevard, usually frequented by ships of\npeace. Certain smoke lines on the horizon were from the French squadron\ncarrying President Poincare who was returning from Russia. The European\nalarm had interrupted his trip. Then they saw more English vessels\npatrolling the coast line like aggressive and vigilant dogs. Two North\nAmerican battleships could be distinguished by their mast-heads in the\nform of baskets. Then a Russian battleship, white and glistening, passed\nat full steam on its way to the Baltic. \"Bad!\" said the South American\npassengers regretfully. \"Very bad! It looks this time as if it were\ngoing to be serious!\" and they glanced uneasily at the neighboring\ncoasts on both sides. Although they presented the usual appearance,\nbehind them, perhaps, a new period of history was in the making.\n\nThe transatlantic was due at Boulogne at midnight where it was supposed\nto wait until daybreak to discharge its passengers comfortably. It\narrived, nevertheless, at ten, dropped anchor outside the harbor, and\nthe Commandant gave orders that the disembarkation should take place\nin less than an hour. For this reason they had quickened their speed,\nconsuming a vast amount of extra coal. It was necessary to get away\nas soon as possible, seeking the refuge of Hamburg. The radiographic\napparatus had evidently been working to some purpose.\n\nBy the glare of the bluish searchlights which were spreading a livid\nclearness over the sea, began the unloading of passengers and baggage\nfor Paris, from the transatlantic into the tenders. \"Hurry! Hurry!\" The\nseamen were pushing forward the ladies of slow step who were recounting\ntheir valises, believing that they had lost some. The stewards loaded\nthemselves up with babies as though they were bundles. The general\nprecipitation dissipated the usual exaggerated and oily Teutonic\namiability. \"They are regular bootlickers,\" thought Desnoyers. \"They\nbelieve that their hour of triumph has come, and do not think it\nnecessary to pretend any longer.\" . . .\n\nHe was soon in a launch that was bobbing up and down on the waves\nnear the black and immovable hulk of the great liner, dotted with many\ncircles of light and filled with people waving handkerchiefs. Julio\nrecognized Bertha who was waving her hand without seeing him, without\nknowing in which tender he was, but feeling obliged to show her\ngratefulness for the sweet memories that now were being lost in the\nmystery of the sea and the night. \"Adieu, Frau Rath!\"\n\nThe distance between the departing transatlantic and the lighters was\nwidening. As though it had been awaiting this moment with impunity, a\nstentorian voice on the upper deck shouted with a noisy guffaw, \"See you\nlater! Soon we shall meet you in Paris!\" And the marine band, the very\nsame band that three days before had astonished Desnoyers with its\nunexpected Marseillaise, burst forth into a military march of the time\nof Frederick the Great--a march of grenadiers with an accompaniment of\ntrumpets.\n\nThat had been the night before. Although twenty-four hours had not yet\npassed by, Desnoyers was already considering it as a distant event of\nshadowy reality. His thoughts, always disposed to take the opposite\nside, did not share in the general alarm. The insolence of the\nCounsellor now appeared to him but the boastings of a burgher turned\ninto a soldier. The disquietude of the people of Paris, was but the\nnervous agitation of a city which lived placidly and became alarmed at\nthe first hint of danger to its comfort. So many times they had spoken\nof an immediate war, always settling things peacefully at the last\nmoment! . . . Furthermore he did not want war to come because it would\nupset all his plans for the future; and the man accepted as logical\nand reasonable everything that suited his selfishness, placing it above\nreality.\n\n\"No, there will not be war,\" he repeated as he continued pacing up and\ndown the garden. \"These people are beside themselves. How could a war\npossibly break out in these days?\" . . .\n\nAnd after disposing of his doubts, which certainly would in a short\ntime come up again, he thought of the joy of the moment, consulting his\nwatch. Five o'clock! She might come now at any minute! He thought that\nhe recognized her afar off in a lady who was passing through the grating\nby the rue Pasquier. She seemed to him a little different, but it\noccurred to him that possibly the Summer fashions might have altered\nher appearance. But soon he saw that he had made a mistake. She was not\nalone, another lady was with her. They were perhaps English or North\nAmerican women who worshipped the memory of Marie Antoinette and wished\nto visit the Chapelle Expiatoire, the old tomb of the executed queen.\nJulio watched them as they climbed the flights of steps and crossed the\ninterior patio in which were interred the eight hundred Swiss soldiers\nkilled in the attack of the Tenth of August, with other victims of\nrevolutionary fury.\n\nDisgusted at his error, he continued his tramp. His ill humor made the\nmonument with which the Bourbon restoration had adorned the old cemetery\nof the Madeleine, appear uglier than ever to him. Time was passing, but\nshe did not come. Every time that he turned, he looked hungrily at the\nentrances of the garden. And then it happened as in all their meetings.\nShe suddenly appeared as if she had fallen from the sky or risen up from\nthe ground, like an apparition. A cough, a slight rustling of footsteps,\nand as he turned, Julio almost collided with her.\n\n\"Marguerite! Oh, Marguerite!\" . . .\n\nIt was she, and yet he was slow to recognize her. He felt a certain\nstrangeness in seeing in full reality the countenance which had occupied\nhis imagination for three months, each time more spirituelle and shadowy\nwith the idealism of absence. But his doubts were of short duration.\nThen it seemed as though time and space were eliminated, that he had\nnot made any voyage, and but a few hours had intervened since their last\ninterview.\n\nMarguerite divined the expansion which might follow Julio's\nexclamations, the vehement hand-clasp, perhaps something more, so she\nkept herself calm and serene.\n\n\"No; not here,\" she said with a grimace of repugnance. \"What a\nridiculous idea for us to have met here!\"\n\nThey were about to seat themselves on the iron chairs, in the shadow of\nsome shrubbery, when she rose suddenly. Those who were passing along the\nboulevard might see them by merely casting their eyes toward the\ngarden. At this time, many of her friends might be passing through the\nneighborhood because of its proximity to the big shops. . . . They,\ntherefore, sought refuge at a corner of the monument, placing themselves\nbetween it and the rue des Mathurins. Desnoyers brought two chairs near\nthe hedge, so that when seated they were invisible to those passing on\nthe other side of the railing. But this was not solitude. A few steps\naway, a fat, nearsighted man was reading his paper, and a group of\nwomen were chatting and embroidering. A woman with a red wig and two\ndogs--some housekeeper who had come down into the garden in order to\ngive her pets an airing--passed several times near the amorous pair,\nsmiling discreetly.\n\n\"How annoying!\" groaned Marguerite. \"Why did we ever come to this\nplace!\"\n\nThe two scrutinized each other carefully, wishing to see exactly what\ntransformation Time had wrought.\n\n\"You are darker than ever,\" she said. \"You look like a man of the sea.\"\n\nJulio was finding her even lovelier than before, and felt sure that\npossessing her was well worth all the contrarieties which had brought\nabout his trip to South America. She was taller than he, with an\nelegantly proportioned slenderness. \"She has the musical step,\"\nDesnoyers had told himself, when seeing her in his imagination; and now,\non beholding her again, the first thing that he admired was her rhythmic\ntread, light and graceful as she passed through the garden seeking\nanother seat. Her features were not regular but they had a piquant\nfascination--a true Parisian face. Everything that had been invented for\nthe embellishment of feminine charm was used about her person with the\nmost exquisite fastidiousness. She had always lived for herself. Only\na few months before had she abdicated a part of this sweet selfishness,\nsacrificing reunions, teas, and calls in order to give Desnoyers some of\nthe afternoon hours.\n\nStylish and painted like a priceless doll, with no loftier ambition\nthan to be a model, interpreting with personal elegance the latest\nconfections of the modistes, she was at last experiencing the same\npreoccupations and joys as other women, creating for herself an inner\nlife. The nucleus of this new life, hidden under her former frivolity,\nwas Desnoyers. Just as she was imagining that she had reorganized\nher existence--adjusting the satisfactions of worldly elegance to the\ndelights of love in intimate secrecy--a fulminating catastrophe (the\nintervention of her husband whose possible appearance she seemed to\nhave overlooked) had disturbed her thoughtless happiness. She who was\naccustomed to think herself the centre of the universe, imagining that\nevents ought to revolve around her desires and tastes, had suffered this\ncruel surprise with more astonishment than grief.\n\n\"And you, how do you think I look?\" Marguerite queried.\n\n\"I must tell you that the fashion has changed. The sheath skirt has\npassed away. Now it is worn short and with more fullness.\"\n\nDesnoyers had to interest himself in her apparel with the same devotion,\nmixing his appreciation of the latest freak of the fashion-monger with\nhis eulogies of Marguerite's beauty.\n\n\"Have you thought much about me?\" she continued. \"You have not been\nunfaithful to me a single time? Not even once? . . . Tell me the truth;\nyou know I can always tell when you are lying.\"\n\n\"I have always thought of you,\" he said putting his hand on his heart,\nas if he were swearing before a judge.\n\nAnd he said it roundly, with an accent of truth, since in his\ninfidelities--now completely forgotten--the memory of Marguerite had\nalways been present.\n\n\"But let us talk about you!\" added Julio. \"What have you been doing all\nthe time?\"\n\nHe had brought his chair nearer to hers, and their knees touched. He\ntook one of her hands, patting it and putting his finger in the glove\nopening. Oh, that accursed garden which would not permit greater\nintimacy and obliged them to speak in a low tone, after three months'\nabsence! . . . In spite of his discretion, the man who was reading his\npaper raised his head and looked irritably at them over his spectacles\nas though a fly were distracting him with its buzzing. . . . The very\nidea of talking love-nonsense in a public garden when all Europe was\nthreatened with calamity!\n\nRepelling the audacious hand, Marguerite spoke tranquilly of her\nexistence during the last months.\n\n\"I have passed my life the best I could, but I have been greatly bored.\nYou know that I am now living with mama, and mama is a lady of the old\nregime who does not understand our tastes. I have been to the theatres\nwith my brother. I have made many calls on the lawyer in order to learn\nthe progress of my divorce and hurry it along . . . and nothing else.\"\n\n\"And your husband?\"\n\n\"Don't let's talk about him. Do you want to? I pity the poor man!\nSo good . . . so correct. The lawyer assures me that he agrees to\neverything and will not impose any obstacles. They tell me that he does\nnot come to Paris, that he lives in his factory. Our old home is closed.\nThere are times when I feel remorseful over the way I have treated him.\"\n\n\"And I?\" queried Julio, withdrawing his hand.\n\n\"You are right,\" she returned smiling. \"You are Life. It is cruel but\nit is human. We have to live our lives without taking others into\nconsideration. It is necessary to be selfish in order to be happy.\"\n\nThe two remained silent. The remembrance of the husband had swept across\nthem like a glacial blast. Julio was the first to brighten up.\n\n\"And you have not danced in all this time?\"\n\n\"No, how could I? The very idea, a woman in divorce proceedings! . . .\nI have not been to a single chic party since you went away. I wanted to\npreserve a certain decorous mourning fiesta. How horrible it was! . . .\nIt needed you, the Master!\"\n\nThey had again clasped hands and were smiling. Memories of the previous\nmonths were passing before their eyes, visions of their life from five\nto seven in the afternoon, dancing in the hotels of the Champs Elysees\nwhere the tango had been inexorably associated with a cup of tea.\n\nShe appeared to tear herself away from these recollections, impelled\nby a tenacious obsession which had slipped from her mind in the first\nmoments of their meeting.\n\n\"Do you know much about what's happening? Tell me all. People talk so\nmuch. . . . Do you really believe that there will be war? Don't you\nthink that it will all end in some kind of settlement?\"\n\nDesnoyers comforted her with his optimism. He did not believe in the\npossibility of a war. That was ridiculous.\n\n\"I say so, too! Ours is not the epoch of savages. I have known some\nGermans, chic and well-educated persons who surely must think exactly as\nwe do. An old professor who comes to the house was explaining yesterday\nto mama that wars are no longer possible in these progressive times. In\ntwo months' time, there would scarcely be any men left, in three, the\nworld would find itself without money to continue the struggle. I do not\nrecall exactly how it was, but he explained it all very clearly, in a\nmanner most delightful to hear.\"\n\nShe reflected in silence, trying to co-ordinate her confused\nrecollections, but dismayed by the effort required, added on her own\naccount.\n\n\"Just imagine what war would mean--how horrible! Society life paralyzed.\nNo more parties, nor clothes, nor theatres! Why, it is even possible\nthat they might not design any more fashions! All the women in mourning.\nCan you imagine it? . . . And Paris deserted. . . . How beautiful it\nseemed as I came to meet you this afternoon! . . . No, no, it cannot\nbe! Next month, you know, we go to Vichy. Mama needs the waters. Then to\nBiarritz. After that, I shall go to a castle on the Loire. And besides\nthere are our affairs, my divorce, our marriage which may take place the\nnext year. . . . And is war to hinder and cut short all this! No, no,\nit is not possible. My brother and others like him are foolish enough\nto dream of danger from Germany. I am sure that my husband, too, who is\nonly interested in serious and bothersome matters, is among those\nwho believe that war is imminent and prepare to take part in it. What\nnonsense! Tell me that it is all nonsense. I need to hear you say it.\"\n\nTranquilized by the affirmations of her lover, she then changed the\ntrend of the conversation. The possibility of their approaching marriage\nbrought to mind the object of the voyage which Desnoyers had just made.\nThere had not been time for them to write to each other during their\nbrief separation.\n\n\"Did you succeed in getting the money? The joy of seeing you made me\nforget all about such things. . . .\"\n\nAdopting the air of a business expert, he replied that he had brought\nback less than he expected, for he had found the country in the throes\nof one of its periodical panics; but still he had managed to get\ntogether about four hundred thousand francs. In his purse he had a check\nfor that amount. Later on, they would send him further remittances.\nA ranchman in Argentina, a sort of relative, was looking after his\naffairs. Marguerite appeared satisfied, and in spite of her frivolity,\nadopted the air of a serious woman.\n\n\"Money, money!\" she exclaimed sententiously. \"And yet there is no\nhappiness without it! With your four hundred thousand and what I have,\nwe shall be able to get along. . . . I told you that my husband wishes\nto give me back my dowry. He has told my brother so. But the state of\nhis business, and the increased size of his factory do not permit him to\nreturn it as quickly as he would like. I can't help but feel sorry for\nthe poor man . . . so honorable and so upright in every way. If he only\nwere not so commonplace! . . .\"\n\nAgain Marguerite seemed to regret these tardy spontaneous eulogies which\nwere chilling their interview. So again she changed the trend of her\nchatter.\n\n\"And your family? Have you seen them?\" . . .\n\nDesnoyers had been to his father's home before starting for the Chapelle\nExpiatoire. A stealthy entrance into the great house on the avenue\nVictor Hugo, and then up to the first floor like a tradesman. Then he\nhad slipt into the kitchen like a soldier sweetheart of the maids.\nHis mother had come there to embrace him, poor Dona Luisa, weeping and\nkissing him frantically as though she had feared to lose him forever.\nClose behind her mother had come Luisita, nicknamed Chichi, who always\nsurveyed him with sympathetic curiosity as if she wished to know better\na brother so bad and adorable who had led decent women from the paths\nof virtue, and committed all kinds of follies. Then Desnoyers had been\ngreatly surprised to see entering the kitchen with the air of a tragedy\nqueen, a noble mother of the drama, his Aunt Elena, the one who had\nmarried a German and was living in Berlin surrounded with innumerable\nchildren.\n\n\"She has been in Paris a month. She is going to make a little visit to\nour castle. And it appears that her eldest son--my cousin, 'The Sage,'\nwhom I have not seen for years--is also coming here.\"\n\nThe home interview had several times been interrupted by fear. \"Your\nfather is at home, be careful,\" his mother had said to him each time\nthat he had spoken above a whisper. And his Aunt Elena had stationed\nherself at the door with a dramatic air, like a stage heroine resolved\nto plunge a dagger into the tyrant who should dare to cross the\nthreshold. The entire family was accustomed to submit to the rigid\nauthority of Don Marcelo Desnoyers. \"Oh, that old man!\" exclaimed Julio,\nreferring to his father. \"He may live many years yet, but how he weighs\nupon us all!\"\n\nHis mother, who had never wearied of looking at him, finally had to\nbring the interview to an end, frightened by certain approaching sounds.\n\"Go, he might surprise us, and he would be furious.\" So Julio had fled\nthe paternal home, caressed by the tears of the two ladies and the\nadmiring glances of Chichi, by turns ashamed and proud of a brother who\nhad caused such enthusiasm and scandal among her friends.\n\nMarguerite also spoke of Senor Desnoyers. A terrible tyrant of the old\nschool with whom they could never come to an understanding.\n\nThe two remained silent, looking fixedly at each other. Now that they\nhad said the things of greatest urgency, present interests became more\nabsorbing. More immediate things, unspoken, seemed to well up in their\ntimid and vacillating eyes, before escaping in the form of words.\nThey did not dare to talk like lovers here. Every minute the cloud of\nwitnesses seemed increasing around them. The woman with the dogs and the\nred wig was passing with greater frequency, shortening her turns through\nthe square in order to greet them with a smile of complicity. The\nreader of the daily paper was now exchanging views with a friend on a\nneighboring bench regarding the possibilities of war. The garden\nhad become a thoroughfare. The modistes upon going out from their\nestablishments, and the ladies returning from shopping, were crossing\nthrough the square in order to shorten their walk. The little avenue was\na popular short-cut. All the pedestrians were casting curious glances at\nthe elegant lady and her companion seated in the shadow of the shrubbery\nwith the timid yet would-be natural look of those who desire to hide\nthemselves, yet at the same time feign a casual air.\n\n\"How exasperating!\" sighed Marguerite. \"They are going to find us out!\"\n\nA girl looked at her so searchingly that she thought she recognized in\nher an employee of a celebrated modiste. Besides, some of her personal\nfriends who had met her in the crowded shops but an hour ago might be\nreturning home by way of the garden.\n\n\"Let us go,\" she said rising hurriedly. \"If they should spy us here\ntogether, just think what they might say! . . . and just when they are\nbecoming a little forgetful!\"\n\nDesnoyers protested crossly. Go away? . . . Paris had become a shrunken\nplace for them nowadays because Marguerite refused to go to a single\nplace where there was a possibility of their being surprised. In another\nsquare, in a restaurant, wherever they might go--they would run the same\nrisk of being recognized. She would only consider meetings in public\nplaces, and yet at the same time, dreaded the curiosity of the people.\nIf Marguerite would like to go to his studio of such sweet\nmemories! . . .\n\n\"To your home? No! no indeed!\" she replied emphatically \"I cannot forget\nthe last time I was there.\"\n\nBut Julio insisted, foreseeing a break in that firm negative. Where\ncould they be more comfortable? Besides, weren't they going to marry as\nsoon as possible? . . .\n\n\"I tell you no,\" she repeated. \"Who knows but my husband may be watching\nme! What a complication for my divorce if he should surprise us in your\nhouse!\"\n\nNow it was he who eulogized the husband, insisting that such\nwatchfulness was incompatible with his character. The engineer had\naccepted the facts, considering them irreparable and was now thinking\nonly of reconstructing his life.\n\n\"No, it is better for us to separate,\" she continued. \"Tomorrow we shall\nsee each other again. You will hunt a more favorable place. Think it\nover, and you will find a solution for it all.\"\n\nBut he wished an immediate solution. They had abandoned their seats,\ngoing slowly toward the rue des Mathurins. Julio was speaking with a\ntrembling and persuasive eloquence. To-morrow? No, now. They had only to\ncall a taxicab. It would be only a matter of a few minutes, and then the\nisolation, the mystery, the return to a sweet past--to that intimacy\nin the studio where they had passed their happiest hours. They would\nbelieve that no time had elapsed since their first meetings.\n\n\"No,\" she faltered with a weakening accent, seeking a last resistance.\n\"Besides, your secretary might be there, that Spaniard who lives with\nyou. How ashamed I would be to meet him again!\"\n\nJulio laughed. . . . Argensola! How could that comrade who knew all\nabout their past be an obstacle? If they should happen to meet him in\nthe house, he would be sure to leave immediately. More than once, he had\nhad to go out so as not to be in the way. His discretion was such that\nhe had foreseen events. Probably he had already left, conjecturing that\na near visit would be the most logical thing. His chum would simply go\nwandering through the streets in search of news.\n\nMarguerite was silent, as though yielding on seeing her pretexts\nexhausted. Desnoyers was silent, too, construing her stillness as\nassent. They had left the garden and she was looking around uneasily,\nterrified to find herself in the open street beside her lover, and\nseeking a hiding-place. Suddenly she saw before her the little red door\nof an automobile, opened by the hand of her adorer.\n\n\"Get in,\" ordered Julio.\n\nAnd she climbed in hastily, anxious to hide herself as soon as possible.\nThe vehicle started at great speed. Marguerite immediately pulled down\nthe shade of the window on her side, but, before she had finished and\ncould turn her head, she felt a hungry mouth kissing the nape of her\nneck.\n\n\"No, not here,\" she said in a pleading tone. \"Let us be sensible!\"\n\nAnd while he, rebellious at these exhortations, persisted in his\nadvances, the voice of Marguerite again sounded above the noise of the\nrattling machinery of the automobile as it bounded over the pavement.\n\n\"Do you really believe that there will be no war? Do you believe that we\nwill be able to marry? . . . Tell me again. I want you to encourage me\n. . . I need to hear it from your lips.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nMADARIAGA, THE CENTAUR\n\n\nIn 1870 Marcelo Desnoyers was nineteen years old. He was born in the\nsuburbs of Paris, an only child; his father, interested in little\nbuilding speculations, maintained his family in modest comfort. The\nmason wished to make an architect of his son, and Marcelo was in the\nmidst of his preparatory studies when his father suddenly died, leaving\nhis affairs greatly involved. In a few months, he and his mother\ndescended the slopes of ruin, and were obliged to give up their snug,\nmiddle-class quarters and live like laborers.\n\nWhen the fourteen-year-old boy had to choose a trade, he learned wood\ncarving. This craft was an art related to the tastes awakened in Marcelo\nby his abandoned studies. His mother retired to the country, living with\nsome relatives while the lad advanced rapidly in the shops, aiding his\nmaster in all the important orders which he received from the provinces.\nThe first news of the war with Prussia surprised him in Marseilles,\nworking on the decorations of a theatre.\n\nMarcelo was opposed to the Empire like all the youths of his generation.\nHe was also much influenced by the older workmen who had taken part in\nthe Republic of '48, and who still retained vivid recollections of the\nCoup d'Etat of the second of December.\n\nOne day he saw in the streets of Marseilles a popular manifestation in\nfavor of peace which was practically a protest against the government.\nThe old republicans in their implacable struggle with the Emperor, the\ncompanies of the International which had just been organized, and a\ngreat number of Italians and Spaniards who had fled their countries on\naccount of recent insurrections, composed the procession. A long-haired,\nconsumptive student was carrying the flag. \"It is peace that we want--a\npeace which may unite all mankind,\" chanted the paraders. But on this\nearth, the noblest propositions are seldom heard, since Destiny amuses\nherself in perverting them and turning them aside.\n\nScarcely had the friends of peace entered the rue Cannebiere with their\nhymn and standard, when war came to meet them, obliging them to resort\nto fist and club. The day before, some battalions of Zouaves from\nAlgiers had disembarked in order to reinforce the army on the\nfrontier, and these veterans, accustomed to colonial existence and\nundiscriminating as to the cause of disturbances, seized the opportunity\nto intervene in this manifestation, some with bayonets and others with\nungirded belts. \"Hurrah for War!\" and a rain of lashes and blows\nfell upon the unarmed singers. Marcelo saw the innocent student, the\nstandard-bearer of peace, knocked down wrapped in his flag, by the\nmerry kicks of the Zouaves. Then he knew no more, since he had received\nvarious blows with a leather strap, and a knife thrust in his shoulder;\nhe had to run the same as the others.\n\nThat day developed for the first time, his fiery, stubborn character,\nirritable before contradiction, even to the point of adopting the most\nextreme resolution. \"Down with War!\" Since it was not possible for him\nto protest in any other way, he would leave the country. The Emperor\nmight arrange his affairs as best he could. The struggle was going to\nbe long and disastrous, according to the enemies of the Empire. If he\nstayed, he would in a few months be drawn for the soldiery. Desnoyers\nrenounced the honor of serving the Emperor. He hesitated a little when\nhe thought of his mother. But his country relatives would not turn her\nout, and he planned to work very hard and send her money. Who knew what\nriches might be waiting for him, on the other side of the sea! . . .\nGood-bye, France!\n\nThanks to his savings, a harbor official found it to his interest to\noffer him the choice of three boats. One was sailing to Egypt, another\nto Australia, another to Montevideo and Buenos Aires, which made the\nstrongest appeal to him? . . . Desnoyers, remembering his readings,\nwished to consult the wind and follow the course that it indicated, as\nhe had seen various heroes of novels do. But that day the wind blew from\nthe sea toward France. He also wished to toss up a coin in order to test\nhis fate. Finally he decided upon the vessel sailing first. Not until,\nwith his scanty baggage, he was actually on the deck of the next boat\nto anchor, did he take any interest in its course--\"For the Rio de la\nPlata.\" . . . And he accepted these words with a fatalistic shrug. \"Very\nwell, let it be South America!\" The country was not distasteful to him,\nsince he knew it by certain travel publications whose illustrations\nrepresented herds of cattle at liberty, half-naked, plumed Indians, and\nhairy cowboys whirling over their heads serpentine lassos tipped with\nballs.\n\nThe millionaire Desnoyers never forgot that trip to America--forty-three\ndays navigating in a little worn-out steamer that rattled like a heap\nof old iron, groaned in all its joints at the slightest roughness of the\nsea, and had to stop four times for repairs, at the mercy of the winds\nand waves.\n\nIn Montevideo, he learned of the reverses suffered by his country and\nthat the French Empire no longer existed. He felt a little ashamed\nwhen he heard that the nation was now self-governing, defending itself\ngallantly behind the walls of Paris. And he had fled! . . . Months\nafterwards, the events of the Commune consoled him for his flight. If\nhe had remained, wrath at the national downfall, his relations with his\nco-laborers, the air in which he lived--everything would surely have\ndragged him along to revolt. In that case, he would have been shot or\nconsigned to a colonial prison like so many of his former comrades.\n\nSo his determination crystallized, and he stopped thinking about the\naffairs of his mother-country. The necessities of existence in a foreign\nland whose language he was beginning to pick up made him think only\nof himself. The turbulent and adventurous life of these new nations\ncompelled him to most absurd expedients and varied occupations. Yet he\nfelt himself strong with an audacity and self-reliance which he never\nhad in the old world. \"I am equal to everything,\" he said, \"if they\nonly give me time to prove it!\" Although he had fled from his country\nin order not to take up arms, he even led a soldier's life for a\nbrief period in his adopted land, receiving a wound in one of the many\nhostilities between the whites and reds in the unsettled districts.\n\nIn Buenos Aires, he again worked as a woodcarver. The city was beginning\nto expand, breaking its shell as a large village. Desnoyers spent many\nyears ornamenting salons and facades. It was a laborious existence,\nsedentary and remunerative. But one day he became tired of this slow\nsaving which could only bring him a mediocre fortune after a long time.\nHe had gone to the new world to become rich like so many others. And\nat twenty-seven, he started forth again, a full-fledged adventurer,\navoiding the cities, wishing to snatch money from untapped, natural\nsources. He worked farms in the forests of the North, but the locusts\nobliterated his crops in a few hours. He was a cattle-driver, with the\naid of only two peons, driving a herd of oxen and mules over the snowy\nsolitudes of the Andes to Bolivia and Chile. In this life, making\njourneys of many months' duration, across interminable plains, he lost\nexact account of time and space. Just as he thought himself on the verge\nof winning a fortune, he lost it all by an unfortunate speculation.\nAnd in a moment of failure and despair, being now thirty years old, he\nbecame an employee of Julio Madariaga.\n\nHe knew of this rustic millionaire through his purchases of flocks--a\nSpaniard who had come to the country when very young, adapting himself\nvery easily to its customs, and living like a cowboy after he had\nacquired enormous properties. The country folk, wishing to put a title\nof respect before his name, called him Don Madariaga.\n\n\"Comrade,\" he said to Desnoyers one day when he happened to be in a good\nhumor--a very rare thing for him--\"you must have passed through many ups\nand downs. Your lack of silver may be smelled a long ways off. Why lead\nsuch a dog's life? Trust in me, Frenchy, and remain here! I am growing\nold, and I need a man.\"\n\nAfter the Frenchman had arranged to stay with Madariaga, every landed\nproprietor living within fifteen or twenty leagues of the ranch, stopped\nthe new employee on the road to prophesy all sorts of misfortune.\n\n\"You will not stay long. Nobody can get along with Don Madariaga. We\nhave lost count of his overseers. He is a man who must be killed or\ndeserted. Soon you will go, too!\"\n\nDesnoyers did not doubt but that there was some truth in all this.\nMadariaga was an impossible character, but feeling a certain sympathy\nwith the Frenchman, had tried not to annoy him with his irritability.\n\n\"He's a regular pearl, this Frenchy,\" said the plainsman as though\ntrying to excuse himself for his considerate treatment of his latest\nacquisition. \"I like him because he is very serious. . . . That is the\nway I like a man.\"\n\nDesnoyers did not know exactly what this much-admired seriousness could\nbe, but he felt a secret pride in seeing him aggressive with everybody\nelse, even his family, whilst he took with him a tone of paternal\nbluffness.\n\nThe family consisted of his wife Misia Petrona (whom he always called\nthe China) and two grown daughters who had gone to school in Buenos\nAires, but on returning to the ranch had reverted somewhat to their\noriginal rusticity.\n\nMadariaga's fortune was enormous. He had lived in the field since his\narrival in America, when the white race had not dared to settle outside\nthe towns for fear of the Indians. He had gained his first money as a\nfearless trader, taking merchandise in a cart from fort to fort. He had\nkilled Indians, was twice wounded by them, and for a while had lived as\na captive with an Indian chief whom he finally succeeded in making his\nstaunch friend. With his earnings, he had bought land, much land, almost\nworthless because of its insecurity, devoting it to the raising of\ncattle that he had to defend, gun in hand, from the pirates of the\nplains.\n\nThen he had married his China, a young half-breed who was running around\nbarefoot, but owned many of her forefathers' fields. They had lived in\nan almost savage poverty on their property which would have taken many a\nday's journey to go around. Afterwards, when the government was pushing\nthe Indians towards the frontiers, and offering the abandoned lands\nfor sale, considering it a patriotic sacrifice on the part of any one\nwishing to acquire them, Madariaga bought and bought at the lowest\nfigure and longest terms. To get possession of vast tracts and populate\nit with blooded stock became the mission of his life. At times,\ngalloping with Desnoyers through his boundless fields, he was not able\nto repress his pride.\n\n\"Tell me something, Frenchy! They say that further up the country, there\nare some nations about the size of my ranches. Is that so?\" . . .\n\nThe Frenchman agreed. . . . The lands of Madariaga were indeed greater\nthan many principalities. This put the old plainsman in rare good humor\nand he exclaimed in the cowboy vernacular which had become second nature\nto him--\"Then it wouldn't be absurd to proclaim myself king some day?\nJust imagine it, Frenchy;--Don Madariaga, the First. . . . The worst of\nit all is that I would also be the last, for the China will not give me\na son. . . . She is a weak cow!\"\n\nThe fame of his vast territories and his wealth in stock reached even to\nBuenos Aires. Every one knew of Madariaga by name, although very few had\nseen him. When he went to the Capital, he passed unnoticed because of\nhis country aspect--the same leggings that he was used to wearing in the\nfields, his poncho wrapped around him like a muffler above which rose\nthe aggressive points of a necktie, a tormenting ornament imposed by his\ndaughters, who in vain arranged it with loving hands that he might look\na little more respectable.\n\nOne day he entered the office of the richest merchant of the capital.\n\n\"Sir, I know that you need some young bulls for the European market, and\nI have come to sell you a few.\"\n\nThe man of affairs looked haughtily at the poor cowboy. He might explain\nhis errand to one of the employees, he could not waste his time on such\nsmall matters. But the malicious grin on the rustic's face awoke his\ncuriosity.\n\n\"And how many are you able to sell, my good man?\"\n\n\"About thirty thousand, sir.\"\n\nIt was not necessary to hear more. The supercilious merchant sprang from\nhis desk, and obsequiously offered him a seat.\n\n\"You can be no other than Don Madariaga.\"\n\n\"At the service of God and yourself, sir,\" he responded in the manner of\na Spanish countryman.\n\nThat was the most glorious moment of his existence.\n\nIn the outer office of the Directors of the Bank, the clerks offered him\na seat until the personage the other side of the door should deign to\nreceive him. But scarcely was his name announced than that same director\nran to admit him, and the employee was stupefied to hear the ranchman\nsay, by way of greeting, \"I have come to draw out three hundred thousand\ndollars. I have abundant pasturage, and I wish to buy a ranch or two in\norder to stock them.\"\n\nHis arbitrary and contradictory character weighed upon the inhabitants\nof his lands with both cruel and good-natured tyranny. No vagabond ever\npassed by the ranch without being rudely assailed by its owner from the\noutset.\n\n\"Don't tell me any of your hard-luck stories, friend,\" he would yell as\nif he were going to beat him. \"Under the shed is a skinned beast;\ncut and eat as much as you wish and so help yourself to continue your\njourney. . . . But no more of your yarns!\"\n\nAnd he would turn his back upon the tramp, after giving him a few\ndollars.\n\nOne day he became infuriated because a peon was nailing the wire fencing\ntoo deliberately on the posts. Everybody was robbing him! The following\nday he spoke of a large sum of money that he would have to pay for\nhaving endorsed the note of an acquaintance, completely bankrupt. \"Poor\nfellow! His luck is worse than mine!\"\n\nUpon finding in the road the skeleton of a recently killed sheep, he was\nbeside himself with indignation. It was not because of the loss of the\nmeat. \"Hunger knows no law, and God has made meat for mankind to eat.\nBut they might at least have left the skin!\" . . . And he would rage\nagainst such wickedness, always repeating, \"Lack of religion and good\nhabits!\" The next time, the bandits stripped the flesh off of three\ncows, leaving the skins in full view, and the ranchman said, smiling,\n\"That is the way I like people, honorable and doing no wrong.\"\n\nHis vigor as a tireless centaur had helped him powerfully in his task\nof populating his lands. He was capricious, despotic and with the\nsame paternal instincts as his compatriots who, centuries before when\nconquering the new world, had clarified its native blood. Like the\nCastilian conquistadors, he had a fancy for copper-colored beauty with\noblique eyes and straight hair. When Desnoyers saw him going off on some\nsudden pretext, putting his horse at full gallop toward a neighboring\nranch, he would say to himself, smilingly, \"He is going in search of a\nnew peon who will help work his land fifteen years from now.\"\n\nThe personnel of the ranch often used to comment on the resemblance of\ncertain youths laboring here the same as the others, galloping from the\nfirst streak of dawn over the fields, attending to the various duties\nof pasturing. The overseer, Celedonio, a half-breed thirty years old,\ngenerally detested for his hard and avaricious character, also bore a\ndistant resemblance to the patron.\n\nAlmost every year, some woman from a great distance, dirty and\nbad-faced, presented herself at the ranch, leading by the hand a little\nmongrel with eyes like live coals. She would ask to speak with the\nproprietor alone, and upon being confronted with her, he usually\nrecalled a trip made ten or twelve years before in order to buy a herd\nof cattle.\n\n\"You remember, Patron, that you passed the night on my ranch because the\nriver had risen?\"\n\nThe Patron did not remember anything about it. But a vague instinct\nwarned him that the woman was probably telling the truth. \"Well, what of\nit?\"\n\n\"Patron, here he is. . . . It is better for him to grow to manhood by\nyour side than in any other place.\"\n\nAnd she presented him with the little hybrid. One more, and offered with\nsuch simplicity! . . . \"Lack of religion and good habits!\" Then with\nsudden modesty, he doubted the woman's veracity. Why must it necessarily\nbe his? . . . But his wavering was generally short-lived.\n\n\"If it's mine, put it with the others.\"\n\nThe mother went away tranquilly, seeing the youngster's future assured,\nbecause this man so lavish in violence was equally so in generosity.\nIn time there would be a bit of land and a good flock of sheep for the\nurchin.\n\nThese adoptions at first aroused in Misia Petrona a little\nrebellion--the only ones of her life; but the centaur soon reduced her\nto terrified silence.\n\n\"And you dare to complain of me, you weak cow! . . . A woman who has\nonly given me daughters. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.\"\n\nThe same hand that negligently extracted from his pocket a wad of bills\nrolled into a ball, giving them away capriciously without knowing just\nhow much, also wore a lash hanging from the wrist. It was supposed to be\nfor his horse, but it was used with equal facility when any of his peons\nincurred his wrath.\n\n\"I strike because I can,\" he would say to pacify himself.\n\nOne day, the man receiving the blow, took a step backward, hunting for\nthe knife in his belt.\n\n\"You are not going to beat me, Patron. I was not born in these parts.\n. . . I come from Corrientes.\"\n\nThe Patron remained with upraised thong. \"Is it true that you were not\nborn here? . . . Then you are right; I cannot beat you. Here are five\ndollars for you.\"\n\nWhen Desnoyers came on the place, Madariaga was beginning to lose count\nof those who were under his dominion in the old Latin sense, and could\ntake his blows. There were so many that confusion often reigned.\n\nThe Frenchman admired the Patron's expert eye for his business. It was\nenough for him to contemplate for a few moments a herd of cattle, to\nknow its exact number. He would go galloping along with an indifferent\nair, around an immense group of horned and stamping beasts, and\nthen would suddenly begin to separate the different animals. He had\ndiscovered that they were sick. With a buyer like Madariaga, all the\ntricks and sharp practice of the drovers came to naught.\n\nHis serenity before trouble was also admirable. A drought suddenly\nstrewed his plains with dead cattle, making the land seem like an\nabandoned battlefield. Everywhere great black hulks. In the air, great\nspirals of crows coming from leagues away. At other times, it was the\ncold; an unexpected drop in the thermometer would cover the ground with\ndead bodies. Ten thousand animals, fifteen thousand, perhaps more, all\nperished!\n\n\"WHAT a knock-out!\" Madariaga would exclaim with resignation. \"Without\nsuch troubles, this earth would be a paradise. . . . Now, the thing to\ndo is to save the skins!\"\n\nAnd he would rail against the false pride of the emigrants, against the\nnew customs among the poor which prevented his securing enough hands to\nstrip the victims quickly, so that thousands of hides had to be lost.\nTheir bones whitened the earth like heaps of snow. The peoncitos (little\npeons) went around putting the skulls of cows with crumpled horns on\nthe posts of the wire fences--a rustic decoration which suggested a\nprocession of Grecian lyres.\n\n\"It is lucky that the land is left, anyway!\" added the ranchman.\n\nHe loved to race around his immense fields when they were beginning to\nturn green in the late rains. He had been among the first to convert\nthese virgin wastes into rich meadow-lands, supplementing the natural\npasturage with alfalfa. Where one beast had found sustenance before, he\nnow had three. \"The table is set,\" he would chuckle, \"we must now go\nin search of the guests.\" And he kept on buying, at ridiculous prices,\nherds dying of hunger in others' uncultivated fields, constantly\nincreasing his opulent lands and stock.\n\nOne morning Desnoyers saved his life. The old ranchman had raised his\nlash against a recently arrived peon who returned the attack, knife in\nhand. Madariaga was defending himself as best he could, convinced\nfrom one minute to another that he was going to receive the deadly\nknife-thrust--when Desnoyers arrived and, drawing his revolver, overcame\nand disarmed the adversary.\n\n\"Thanks, Frenchy,\" said the ranchman, much touched. \"You are an\nall-round man, and I am going to reward you. From this day I shall speak\nto you as I do to my family.\"\n\nDesnoyers did not know just what this familiar talk might amount to,\nfor his employer was so peculiar. Certain personal favors, nevertheless,\nimmediately began to improve his position. He was no longer allowed to\neat in the administration building, the proprietor insisting imperiously\nthat henceforth Desnoyers should sit at his own table, and thus he was\nadmitted into the intimate life of the Madariaga family.\n\nThe wife was always silent when her husband was present. She was used to\nrising in the middle of the night in order to oversee the breakfasts\nof the peons, the distribution of biscuit, and the boiling of the great\nblack kettles of coffee or shrub tea. She looked after the chattering\nand lazy maids who so easily managed to get lost in the nearby groves.\nIn the kitchen, too, she made her authority felt like a regular\nhouse-mistress, but the minute that she heard her husband's voice she\nshrank into a respectful and timorous silence. Upon sitting down at\ntable, the China would look at him with devoted submission, her great,\nround eyes fixed on him, like an owl's. Desnoyers felt that in this mute\nadmiration was mingled great astonishment at the energy with which the\nranchman, already over seventy, was continuing to bring new occupants to\nlive on his demesne.\n\nThe two daughters, Luisa and Elena, accepted with enthusiasm the new\narrival who came to enliven the monotonous conversations in the dining\nroom, so often cut short by their father's wrathful outbursts. Besides,\nhe was from Paris. \"Paris!\" sighed Elena, the younger one, rolling her\neyes. And Desnoyers was henceforth consulted in all matters of style\nevery time they ordered any \"confections\" from the shops of Buenos\nAires.\n\nThe interior of the house reflected the different tastes of the two\ngenerations. The girls had a parlor with a few handsome pieces of\nfurniture placed against the cracked walls, and some showy lamps that\nwere never lighted. The father, with his boorishness, often invaded this\nroom so cherished and admired by the two sisters, making the carpets\nlook shabby and faded under his muddy boot-tracks. Upon the gilt\ncentre-table, he loved to lay his lash. Samples of maize scattered\nits grains over a silk sofa which the young ladies tried to keep very\nchoice, as though they feared it might break.\n\nNear the entrance to the dining room was a weighing machine, and\nMadariaga became furious when his daughters asked him to remove it to\nthe offices. He was not going to trouble himself to go outside every\ntime that he wanted to know the weight of a leather skin! . . . A piano\ncame into the ranch, and Elena passed the hours practising exercises\nwith desperate good will. \"Heavens and earth! She might at least play\nthe Jota or the Perican, or some other lively Spanish dance!\" And\nthe irate father, at the hour of siesta, betook himself to the nearby\neucalyptus trees, to sleep upon his poncho.\n\nThis younger daughter whom he dubbed La Romantica, was the special\nvictim of his wrath and ridicule. Where had she picked up so many tastes\nwhich he and his good China never had had? Music books were piled on the\npiano. In a corner of the absurd parlor were some wooden boxes that had\nheld preserves, which the ranch carpenter had been made to press into\nservice as a bookcase.\n\n\"Look here, Frenchy,\" scoffed Madariaga. \"All these are novels and\npoems! Pure lies! . . . Hot air!\"\n\nHe had his private library, vastly more important and glorious, and\noccupying less space. In his desk, adorned with guns, thongs, and chaps\nstudded with silver, was a little compartment containing deeds and\nvarious legal documents which the ranchman surveyed with great pride.\n\n\"Pay attention, now and hear marvellous things,\" announced the master to\nDesnoyers, as he took out one of his memorandum books.\n\nThis volume contained the pedigree of the famous animals which had\nimproved his breeds of stock, the genealogical trees, the patents of\nnobility of his aristocratic beasts. He would have to read its contents\nto him since he did not permit even his family to touch these records.\nAnd with his spectacles on the end of his nose, he would spell out the\ncredentials of each animal celebrity. \"Diamond III, grandson of Diamond\nI, owned by the King of England, son of Diamond II, winner in the\nraces.\" His Diamond had cost him many thousands, but the finest horses\non the ranch, those which brought the most marvellous prices, were his\ndescendants.\n\n\"That horse had more sense than most people. He only lacked the power\nto talk. He's the one that's stuffed, near the door of the parlor. The\ngirls wanted him thrown out. . . . Just let them dare to touch him! I'd\nchuck them out first!\"\n\nThen he would continue reading the history of a dynasty of bulls\nwith distinctive names and a succession of Roman numbers, the same as\nkings--animals acquired by the stubborn ranchman in the great cattle\nfairs of England. He had never been there, but he had used the cable in\norder to compete in pounds sterling with the British owners who wished\nto keep such valuable stock in their own country. Thanks to these\nblue-blooded sires that had crossed the ocean with all the luxury of\nmillionaire passengers, he had been able to exhibit in the concourses\nof Buenos Aires animals which were veritable towers of meat, edible\nelephants with their sides as fit and sleek as a table.\n\n\"That book amounts to something! Don't you think so, Frenchy? It is\nworth more than all those pictures of moons, lakes, lovers and other\ngewgaws that my Romantica puts on the walls to catch the dust.\"\n\nAnd he would point out, in contrast, the precious diplomas which were\nadorning his desk, the metal vases and other trophies won in the fairs\nby the descendants of his blooded stock.\n\nLuisa, the elder daughter, called Chicha, in the South American fashion,\nwas much more respected by her father. \"She is my poor China right over\nagain,\" he said, \"the same good nature, and the same faculty for work,\nbut more of a lady.\" Desnoyers entirely agreed with him, and yet the\nfather's description seemed to him weak and incomplete. He could not\nadmit that the pale, modest girl with the great black eyes and smile\nof childish mischief bore the slightest resemblance to the respectable\nmatron who had brought her into existence.\n\nThe great fiesta for Chicha was the Sunday mass. It represented a\njourney of three leagues to the nearest village, a weekly contact with\npeople unlike those of the ranch. A carriage drawn by four horses took\nthe senora and the two senoritas in the latest suits and hats arrived,\nvia Buenos Aires, from Europe. At the suggestion of Chicha, Desnoyers\naccompanied them in the capacity of driver.\n\nThe father remained at home, taking advantage of this opportunity\nto survey his fields in their Sunday solitude, thus keeping a\ncloser oversight on the shiftlessness of his hands. He was very\nreligious--\"Religion and good manners, you know.\" But had he not given\nthousands of dollars toward building the neighboring church? A man\nof his fortune should not be submitted to the same obligations as\nragamuffins!\n\nDuring the Sunday lunch the young ladies were apt to make comments upon\nthe persons and merits of the young men of the village and neighboring\nranches, who had lingered at the church door in order to chat with them.\n\n\"Don't fool yourselves, girls!\" observed the father shrewdly. \"You\nbelieve that they want you for your elegance, don't you? . . . What\nthose shameless fellows really want are the dollars of old Madariaga,\nand once they had them, they would probably give you a daily beating.\"\n\nFor a while the ranch received numerous visitors. Some were young men of\nthe neighborhood who arrived on spirited steeds, performing all kinds of\ntricks of fancy horsemanship. They wanted to see Don Julio on the most\nabsurd pretexts, and at the same time improved the opportunity to chat\nwith Chicha and Luisa. At other times they were youths from Buenos Aires\nasking for a lodging at the ranch, as they were just passing by. Don\nMadariaga would growl--\n\n\"Another good-for-nothing scamp who comes in search of the Spanish\nranchman! If he doesn't move on soon . . . I'll kick him out!\"\n\nBut the suitor did not stand long on the order of his going, intimidated\nby the ominous silence of the Patron. This silence, of late, had\npersisted in an alarming manner, in spite of the fact that the ranch was\nno longer receiving visitors. Madariaga appeared abstracted, and all the\nfamily, including Desnoyers, respected and feared this taciturnity.\nHe ate, scowling, with lowered head. Suddenly he would raise his eyes,\nlooking at Chicha, then at Desnoyers, finally fixing them upon his wife\nas though asking her to give an account of things.\n\nHis Romantica simply did not exist for him. The only notice that he ever\ntook of her was to give an ironical snort when he happened to see\nher leaning at sunset against the doorway, looking at the reddening\nglow--one elbow on the door frame and her cheek in her hand, in\nimitation of the posture of a certain white lady that she had seen in a\nchromo, awaiting the knight of her dreams.\n\nDesnoyers had been five years in the house when one day he entered his\nmaster's private office with the brusque air of a timid person who has\nsuddenly reached a decision.\n\n\"Don Julio, I am going to leave and I would like our accounts settled.\"\n\nMadariaga looked at him slyly. \"Going to leave, eh? . . . What for?\" But\nin vain he repeated his questions. The Frenchman was floundering through\na series of incoherent explanations--\"I'm going; I've got to go.\"\n\n\"Ah, you thief, you false prophet!\" shouted the ranchman in stentorian\ntones.\n\nBut Desnoyers did not quail before the insults. He had often heard his\nPatron use these same words when holding somebody up to ridicule, or\nhaggling with certain cattle drovers.\n\n\"Ah, you thief, you false prophet! Do you suppose that I do not know\nwhy you are going? Do you suppose old Madariaga has not seen your\nlanguishing looks and those of my dead fly of a daughter, clasping\neach others' hands in the presence of poor China who is blinded in her\njudgment? . . . It's not such a bad stroke, Frenchy. By it, you would be\nable to get possession of half of the old Spaniard's dollars, and then\nsay that you had made it in America.\"\n\nAnd while he was storming, or rather howling, all this, he had grasped\nhis lash and with the butt end kept poking his manager in the stomach\nwith such insistence that it might be construed in an affectionate or\nhostile way.\n\n\"For this reason I have come to bid you good-bye,\" said Desnoyers\nhaughtily. \"I know that my love is absurd, and I wish to leave.\"\n\n\"The gentleman would go away,\" the ranchman continued spluttering. \"The\ngentleman believes that here one can do what one pleases! No, siree!\nHere nobody commands but old Madariaga, and I order you to stay. . . .\nAh, these women! They only serve to antagonize men. And yet we can't\nlive without them!\" . . .\n\nHe took several turns up and down the room, as though his last words\nwere making him think of something very different from what he had just\nbeen saying. Desnoyers looked uneasily at the thong which was still\nhanging from his wrist. Suppose he should attempt to whip him as he did\nthe peons? . . . He was still undecided whether to hold his own against\na man who had always treated him with benevolence or, while his back\nwas turned, to take refuge in discreet flight, when the ranchman planted\nhimself before him.\n\n\"You really love her, really?\" he asked. \"Are you sure that she loves\nyou? Be careful what you say, for love is blind and deceitful. I, too,\nwhen I married my China was crazy about her. Do you love her, honestly\nand truly? . . . Well then, take her, you devilish Frenchy. Somebody has\nto take her, and may she not turn out a weak cow like her mother! . . .\nLet us have the ranch full of grandchildren!\"\n\nIn voicing this stock-raiser's wish, again appeared the great breeder of\nbeasts and men. And as though he considered it necessary to explain his\nconcession, he added--\"I do all this because I like you; and I like you\nbecause you are serious.\"\n\nAgain the Frenchman was plunged in doubt, not knowing in just what this\ngreatly appreciated seriousness consisted.\n\nAt his wedding, Desnoyers thought much of his mother. If only the poor\nold woman could witness this extraordinary stroke of good fortune! But\nshe had died the year before, believing her son enormously rich because\nhe had been sending her sixty dollars every month, taken from the wages\nthat he had earned on the ranch.\n\nDesnoyers' entrance into the family made his father-in-law pay less\nattention to business.\n\nCity life, with all its untried enchantments and snares, now attracted\nMadariaga, and he began to speak with contempt of country women, poorly\ngroomed and inspiring him with disgust. He had given up his cowboy\nattire, and was displaying with childish satisfaction, the new suits\nin which a tailor of the Capital was trying to disguise him. When Elena\nwished to accompany him to Buenos Aires, he would wriggle out of it,\ntrumping up some absorbing business. \"No; you go with your mother.\"\n\nThe fate of his fields and flocks gave him no uneasiness. His fortune,\nmanaged by Desnoyers, was in good hands.\n\n\"He is very serious,\" again affirmed the old Spaniard to his family\nassembled in the dining roam--\"as serious as I am. . . . Nobody can make\na fool of him!\"\n\nAnd finally the Frenchman concluded that when his father-in-law spoke of\nseriousness he was referring to his strength of character. According to\nthe spontaneous declaration of Madariaga, he had, from the very first\nday that he had dealings with Desnoyers, perceived in him a nature\nlike his own, more hard and firm perhaps, but without splurges\nof eccentricities. On this account he had treated him with such\nextraordinary circumspection, foreseeing that a clash between the\ntwo could never be adjusted. Their only disagreements were about\nthe expenses established by Madariaga during his regime. Since the\nson-in-law was managing the ranches, the work was costing less, and\nthe people working more diligently;--and that, too, without yells, and\nwithout strong words and deeds, with only his presence and brief orders.\n\nThe old man was the only one defending the capricious system of a\nblow followed by a gift. He revolted against a minute and mechanical\nadministration, always the same, without any arbitrary extravagance or\ngood-natured tyranny. Very frequently some of the half-breed peons whom\na malicious public supposed to be closely related to the ranchman, would\npresent themselves before Desnoyers with, \"Senor Manager, the old Patron\nsay that you are to give me five dollars.\" The Senor Manager would\nrefuse, and soon after Madariaga would rush in in a furious temper, but\nmeasuring his words, nevertheless, remembering that his son-in-law's\ndisposition was as serious as his own.\n\n\"I like you very much, my son, but here no one overrules me. . . . Ah,\nFrenchy, you are like all the rest of your countrymen! Once you get your\nclaws on a penny, it goes into your stocking, and nevermore sees\nthe light of day, even though they crucify you. . . ! Did I say five\ndollars? Give him ten. I command it and that is enough.\"\n\nThe Frenchman paid, shrugging his shoulders, whilst his father-in-law,\nsatisfied with his triumph, fled to Buenos Aires. It was a good thing to\nhave it well understood that the ranch still belonged to Madariaga, the\nSpaniard.\n\nFrom one of these trips, he returned with a companion, a young German\nwho, according to him, knew everything and could do everything. His\nson-in-law was working too hard. This Karl Hartrott would assist him\nin the bookkeeping. Desnoyers accepted the situation, and in a few days\nfelt increasing esteem for the new incumbent.\n\nAlthough they belonged to two unfriendly nations, it didn't matter.\nThere are good people everywhere, and this Karl was a subordinate worth\nconsidering. He kept his distance from his equals, and was hard and\ninflexible toward his inferiors. All his faculties seemed concentrated\nin service and admiration for those above him. Scarcely would Madariaga\nopen his lips before the German's head began nodding in agreement,\nanticipating his words. If he said anything funny, his clerk's laugh\nwould break forth in scandalous roars. With Desnoyers he appeared more\ntaciturn, working without stopping for hours at a time. As soon as he\nsaw the manager entering the office he would leap from his seat,\nholding himself erect with military precision. He was always ready to\ndo anything whatever. Unasked, he spied on the workmen, reporting their\ncarelessness and mistakes. This last service did not especially please\nhis superior officer, but he appreciated it as a sign of interest in the\nestablishment.\n\nThe old man bragged triumphantly of the new acquisition, urging his\nson-in-law also to rejoice.\n\n\"A very useful fellow, isn't he? . . . These gringoes from Germany\nwork well, know a good many things and cost little. Then, too, so\ndisciplined! so servile! . . . I am sorry to praise him so to you\nbecause you are a Frenchy, and your nation has in them a very powerful\nenemy. His people are a hard-shelled race.\"\n\nDesnoyers replied with a shrug of indifference. His country was far\naway, and so was Germany. Who knew if they would ever return! . . . They\nwere both Argentinians now, and ought to interest themselves in present\naffairs and not bother about the past.\n\n\"And how little pride they have!\" sneered Madariaga in an ironical tone.\n\"Every one of these gringoes when he is a clerk at the Capital sweeps\nthe shop, prepares the meals, keeps the books, sells to the customers,\nworks the typewriter, translates four or five languages, and dances\nattendance on the proprietor's lady friend, as though she were a grand\nsenora . . . all for twenty-five dollars a month. Who can compete with\nsuch people! You, Frenchy, you are like me, very serious, and would die\nof hunger before passing through certain things. But, mark my words, on\nthis very account they are going to become a terrible people!\"\n\nAfter brief reflection, the ranchman added:\n\n\"Perhaps they are not so good as they seem. Just see how they treat\nthose under them! It may be that they affect this simplicity without\nhaving it, and when they grin at receiving a kick, they are saying\ninside, 'Just wait till my turn comes, and I'll give you three!'\"\n\nThen he suddenly seemed to repent of his suspicions.\n\n\"At any rate, this Karl is a poor fellow, a mealy-mouthed simpleton who\nthe minute I say anything opens his jaws like a fly-catcher. He insists\nthat he comes of a great family, but who knows anything about these\ngringoes? . . . All of us, dead with hunger when we reach America, claim\nto be sons of princes.\"\n\nMadariaga had placed himself on a familiar footing with his Teutonic\ntreasure, not through gratitude as with Desnoyers, but in order to make\nhim feel his inferiority. He had also introduced him on an equal footing\nin his home, but only that he might give piano lessons to his younger\ndaughter. The Romantica was no longer framing herself in the doorway--in\nthe gloaming watching the sunset reflections. When Karl had finished his\nwork in the office, he was now coming to the house and seating himself\nbeside Elena, who was tinkling away with a persistence worthy of a\nbetter fate. At the end of the hour the German, accompanying himself on\nthe piano, would sing fragments from Wagner in such a way that it\nput Madariaga to sleep in his armchair with his great Paraguay cigar\nsticking out of his mouth.\n\nElena meanwhile was contemplating with increasing interest the singing\ngringo. He was not the knight of her dreams awaited by the fair lady. He\nwas almost a servant, a blond immigrant with reddish hair, fat, heavy,\nand with bovine eyes that reflected an eternal fear of disagreeing\nwith his chiefs. But day by day, she was finding in him something which\nrather modified these impressions--his feminine fairness, except\nwhere he was burned by the sun, the increasingly martial aspect of his\nmoustachios, the agility with which he mounted his horse, his air of a\ntroubadour, intoning with a rather weak tenor voluptuous romances whose\nwords she did not understand.\n\nOne night, just before supper, the impressionable girl announced with a\nfeverish excitement which she could no longer repress that she had made\na grand discovery.\n\n\"Papa, Karl is of noble birth! He belongs to a great family.\"\n\nThe plainsman made a gesture of indifference. Other things were vexing\nhim in those days. But during the evening, feeling the necessity of\nventing on somebody the wrath which had been gnawing at his vitals since\nhis last trip to Buenos Aires, he interrupted the singer.\n\n\"See here, gringo, what is all this nonsense about nobility which you\nhave been telling my girl?\"\n\nKarl left the piano that he might draw himself up to the approved\nmilitary position before responding. Under the influence of his recent\nsong, his pose suggested Lohengrin about to reveal the secret of his\nlife. His father had been General von Hartrott, one of the commanders\nin the war of '70. The Emperor had rewarded his services by giving him\na title. One of his uncles was an intimate councillor of the King\nof Prussia. His older brothers were conspicuous in the most select\nregiments. He had carried a sword as a lieutenant.\n\nBored with all this grandeur, Madariaga interrupted him. \"Lies . . .\nnonsense . . . hot air!\" The very idea of a gringo talking to him about\nnobility! . . . He had left Europe when very young in order to cast in\nhis lot with the revolting democracies of America, and although nobility\nnow seemed to him something out-of-date and incomprehensible, still\nhe stoutly maintained that the only true nobility was that of his own\ncountry. He would yield first place to the gringoes for the invention\nof machinery and ships, and for breeding priceless animals, but all the\nCounts and Marquises of Gringo-land appeared to him to be fictitious\ncharacters.\n\n\"All tomfoolery!\" he blustered. \"There isn't any nobility in your\ncountry, nor have you five dollars all told to rub against each other.\nIf you had, you wouldn't come over here to play the gallant to women who\nare . . . you know what they are as well as I do.\"\n\nTo the astonishment of Desnoyers, the German received this onslaught\nwith much humility, nodding his head in agreement with the Patron's last\nwords.\n\n\"If there's any truth in all this twaddle about titles,\" continued\nMadariaga implacably, \"swords and uniforms, what did you come here for?\nWhat in the devil did you do in your own country that you had to leave\nit?\"\n\nNow Karl hung his head, confused and stuttering.\n\n\"Papa, papa,\" pleaded Elena. \"The poor little fellow! How can you\nhumiliate him so just because he is poor?\"\n\nAnd she felt a deep gratitude toward her brother-in-law when he broke\nthrough his usual reserve in order to come to the rescue of the German.\n\n\"Oh, yes, of course, he's a good-enough fellow,\" said Madariaga,\nexcusing himself. \"But he comes from a land that I detest.\"\n\nWhen Desnoyers made a trip to Buenos Aires a few days afterward, the\ncause of the old man's wrath was explained. It appeared that for some\nmonths past Madariaga had been the financial guarantor and devoted swain\nof a German prima donna stranded in South America with an Italian opera\ncompany. It was she who had recommended Karl--an unfortunate countryman,\nwho after wandering through many parts of the continent, was now\nliving with her as a sort of gentlemanly singer. Madariaga had joyously\nexpended upon this courtesan many thousands of dollars. A childish\nenthusiasm had accompanied him in this novel existence midst urban\ndissipations until he happened to discover that his Fraulein was leading\nanother life during his absence, laughing at him with the parasites of\nher retinue; whereupon he arose in his wrath and bade her farewell to\nthe accompaniment of blows and broken furniture.\n\nThe last adventure of his life! . . . Desnoyers suspected his abdication\nupon hearing him admit his age, for the first time. He did not intend\nto return to the capital. It was all false glitter. Existence in the\ncountry, surrounded by all his family and doing good to the poor was\nthe only sure thing. And the terrible centaur expressed himself with\nthe idyllic tenderness and firm virtue of seventy-five years, already\ninsensible to temptation.\n\nAfter his scene with Karl, he had increased the German's salary, trying\nas usual, to counteract the effects of his violent outbreaks with\ngenerosity. That which he could not forget was his dependent's nobility,\nconstantly making it the subject of new jests. That glorious boast had\nbrought to his mind the genealogical trees of the illustrious ancestry\nof his prize cattle. The German was a pedigreed fellow, and thenceforth\nhe called him by that nickname.\n\nSeated on summer nights under the awning, he surveyed his family around\nhim with a sort of patriarchal ecstasy. In the evening hush could be\nheard the buzzing of insects and the croaking of the frogs. From the\ndistant ranches floated the songs of the peons as they prepared their\nsuppers. It was harvest time, and great bands of immigrants were\nencamped in the fields for the extra work.\n\nMadariaga had known many of the hard old days of wars and violence. Upon\nhis arrival in South America, he had witnessed the last years of the\ntyranny of Rosas. He loved to enumerate the different provincial and\nnational revolutions in which he had taken part. But all this had\ndisappeared and would never return. These were the times of peace, work\nand abundance.\n\n\"Just think of it, Frenchy,\" he said, driving away the mosquitoes with\nthe puffs of his cigar. \"I am Spanish, you French, Karl German, my\ndaughters Argentinians, the cook Russian, his assistant Greek, the\nstable boy English, the kitchen servants Chinas (natives), Galicians or\nItalians, and among the peons there are many castes and laws. . . . And\nyet we all live in peace. In Europe, we would have probably been in a\ngrand fight by this time, but here we are all friends.\"\n\nHe took much pleasure in listening to the music of the laborers--laments\nfrom Italian songs to the accompaniment of the accordion, Spanish\nguitars and Creole choruses, wild voices chanting of love and death.\n\n\"This is a regular Noah's ark,\" exulted the vainglorious patriarch.\n\n\"He means the tower of Babel,\" thought Desnoyers to himself, \"but it's\nall the same thing to the old man.\"\n\n\"I believe,\" he rambled on, \"that we live thus because in this part\nof the world there are no kings and a very small army--and mankind is\nthinking only of enjoying itself as much as possible, thanks to its\nwork. But I also believe that we live so peacefully because there is\nsuch abundance that everyone gets his share. . . . How quickly we would\nspring to arms if the rations were less than the people!\"\n\nAgain he fell into reflective silence, shortly after announcing the\nresult of his meditations.\n\n\"Be that as it may be, we must recognize that here life is more tranquil\nthan in the other world. Men are taken for what they are worth, and\nmingle together without thinking whether they came from one country or\nanother. Over here, fellows do not come in droves to kill other fellows\nwhom they do not know and whose only crime is that they were born in an\nunfriendly country. . . . Man is a bad beast everywhere, I know that;\nbut here he eats, owns more land than he needs so that he can stretch\nhimself, and he is good with the goodness of a well-fed dog. Over there,\nthere are too many; they live in heaps getting in each other's way, and\neasily run amuck. Hurrah for Peace, Frenchy, and the simple life! Where\na man can live comfortably and runs no danger of being killed for things\nhe doesn't understand--there is his real homeland!\"\n\nAnd as though an echo of the rustic's reflections, Karl seated at the\npiano, began chanting in a low voice one of Beethoven's hymns--\n\n     \"We sing the joy of life,\n          We sing of liberty,\n     We'll ne'er betray our fellow-man,\n          Though great the guerdon be.\"\n\nPeace! . . . A few days afterward Desnoyers recalled bitterly the old\nman's illusion, for war--domestic war--broke loose in this idyllic\nstage-setting of ranch life.\n\n\"Run, Senor Manager, the old Patron has unsheathed his knife and is\ngoing to kill the German!\" And Desnoyers had hurried from his office,\nwarned by the peon's summons. Madariaga was chasing Karl, knife in hand,\nstumbling over everything that blocked his way. Only his son-in-law\ndared to stop him and disarm him.\n\n\"That shameless pedigreed fellow!\" bellowed the livid old man as he\nwrithed in Desnoyers' firm clutch. \"Half famished, all he thinks he has\nto do is to come to my house and take away my daughters and dollars.\n. . . Let me go, I tell you! Let me loose that I may kill him.\"\n\nAnd in order to free himself from Desnoyers, he tried further to explain\nthe difficulty. He had accepted the Frenchman as a husband for his\ndaughter because he was to his liking, modest, honest . . . and serious.\nBut this singing Pedigreed Fellow, with all his airs! . . . He was a man\nthat he had gotten from . . . well, he didn't wish to say just where!\nAnd the Frenchman, though knowing perfectly well what his introduction\nto Karl had been, pretended not to understand him.\n\nAs the German had, by this time, made good his escape, the ranchman\nconsented to being pushed toward his house, talking all the time about\ngiving a beating to the Romantica and another to the China for not\nhaving informed him of the courtship. He had surprised his daughter\nand the Gringo holding hands and exchanging kisses in a grove near the\nhouse.\n\n\"He's after my dollars,\" howled the irate father. \"He wants America to\nenrich him quickly at the expense of the old Spaniard, and that is\nthe reason for so much truckling, so much psalm-singing and so much\nnobility! Imposter! . . . Musician!\"\n\nAnd he repeated the word \"musician\" with contempt, as though it were the\nsum and substance of everything vile.\n\nVery firmly and with few words, Desnoyers brought the wrangling to an\nend. While her brother-in-law protected her retreat, the Romantica,\nclinging to her mother, had taken refuge in the top of the house,\nsobbing and moaning, \"Oh, the poor little fellow! Everybody against\nhim!\" Her sister meanwhile was exerting all the powers of a discreet\ndaughter with the rampageous old man in the office, and Desnoyers had\ngone in search of Karl. Finding that he had not yet recovered from the\nshock of his terrible surprise, he gave him a horse, advising him to\nbetake himself as quickly as possible to the nearest railway station.\n\nAlthough the German was soon far from the ranch, he did not long remain\nalone. In a few days, the Romantica followed him. . . . Iseult of the\nwhite hands went in search of Tristan, the knight.\n\nThis event did not cause Madariaga's desperation to break out as\nviolently as his son-in-law had expected. For the first time, he saw him\nweep. His gay and robust old age had suddenly fallen from him, the news\nhaving clapped ten years on to his four score. Like a child, whimpering\nand tremulous, he threw his arms around Desnoyers, moistening his neck\nwith tears.\n\n\"He has taken her away! That son of a great flea . . . has taken her\naway!\"\n\nThis time he did not lay all the blame on his China. He wept with her,\nand as if trying to console her by a public confession, kept saying over\nand over:\n\n\"It is my fault. . . . It has all been because of my very, very great\nsins.\"\n\nNow began for Desnoyers a period of difficulties and conflicts. The\nfugitives, on one of his visits to the Capital, threw themselves on his\nmercy, imploring his protection. The Romantica wept, declaring that only\nher brother-in-law, \"the most knightly man in the world,\" could save\nher. Karl gazed at him like a faithful hound trusting in his master.\nThese trying interviews were repeated on all his trips. Then, on\nreturning to the ranch, he would find the old man ill-humored, moody,\nlooking fixedly ahead of him as though seeing invisible power and\nwailing, \"It is my punishment--the punishment for my sins.\"\n\nThe memory of the discreditable circumstances under which he had made\nKarl's acquaintance, before bringing him into his home, tormented\nthe old centaur with remorse. Some afternoons, he would have a horse\nsaddled, going full gallop toward the neighboring village. But he was\nno longer hunting hospitable ranches. He needed to pass some time in\nthe church, speaking alone with the images that were there only for\nhim--since he had footed the bills for them. . . . \"Through my sin,\nthrough my very great sin!\"\n\nBut in spite of his self-reproach, Desnoyers had to work very hard\nto get any kind of a settlement out of the old penitent. Whenever he\nsuggested legalizing the situation and making the necessary arrangements\nfor their marriage, the old tyrant would not let him go on. \"Do what you\nthink best, but don't say anything to me about it.\"\n\nSeveral months passed by. One day the Frenchman approached him with a\ncertain air of mystery. \"Elena has a son and has named him 'Julio' after\nyou.\"\n\n\"And you, you great useless hulk,\" stormed the ranchman, \"and that weak\ncow of a wife of yours, you dare to live tranquilly on without giving\nme a grandson! . . . Ah, Frenchy, that is why the Germans will finally\noverwhelm you. You see it, right here. That bandit has a son, while you,\nafter four years of marriage . . . nothing. I want a grandson!--do you\nunderstand THAT?\"\n\nAnd in order to console himself for this lack of little ones around his\nown hearth, he betook himself to the ranch of his overseer, Celedonio,\nwhere a band of little half-breeds gathered tremblingly and hopefully\nabout him.\n\nSuddenly China died. The poor Misia Petrona passed away as discreetly as\nshe had lived, trying even in her last hours to avoid all annoyance for\nher husband, asking his pardon with an imploring look for any trouble\nwhich her death might cause him. Elena came to the ranch in order to see\nher mother's body for the last time, and Desnoyers who for more than\na year had been supporting them behind his father-in-law's back, took\nadvantage of this occasion to overcome the old man's resentment.\n\n\"Well, I'll forgive her,\" said the ranchman finally. \"I'll do it for the\nsake of my poor wife and for you. She may remain on the ranch, and that\nshameless gringo may come with her.\"\n\nBut he would have nothing to do with him. The German was to be an\nemployee under Desnoyers, and they could live in the office building as\nthough they did not belong to the family. He would never say a word to\nKarl.\n\nBut scarcely had the German returned before he began giving him orders\nrudely as though he were a perfect stranger. At other times he would\npass by him as though he did not know him. Upon finding Elena in the\nhouse with his older daughter, he would go on without speaking to her.\n\nIn vain his Romantica transfigured by maternity, improved all\nopportunities for putting her child in his way, calling him loudly by\nname: \"Julio . . . Julio!\"\n\n\"They want that brat of a singing gringo, that carrot top with a face\nlike a skinned kid to be my grandson? . . . I prefer Celedonio's.\"\n\nAnd by way of emphasizing his protest, he entered the dwelling of his\noverseer, scattering among his dusky brood handfuls of dollars.\n\nAfter seven years of marriage, the wife of Desnoyers found that she,\ntoo, was going to become a mother. Her sister already had three sons.\nBut what were they worth to Madariaga compared to the grandson that was\ngoing to come? \"It will be a boy,\" he announced positively, \"because I\nneed one so. It shall be named Julio, and I hope that it will look like\nmy poor dead wife.\"\n\nSince the death of his wife he no longer called her the China, feeling\nsomething of a posthumous love for the poor woman who in her lifetime\nhad endured so much, so timidly and silently. Now \"my poor dead wife\"\ncropped out every other instant in the conversation of the remorseful\nranchman.\n\nHis desires were fulfilled. Luisa gave birth to a boy who bore the name\nof Julio, and although he did not show in his somewhat sketchy features\nany striking resemblance to his grandmother, still he had the black\nhair and eyes and olive skin of a brunette. Welcome! . . . This WAS a\ngrandson!\n\nIn the generosity of his joy, he even permitted the German to enter the\nhouse for the baptismal ceremony.\n\nWhen Julio Desnoyers was two years old, his grandfather made the rounds\nof his estates, holding him on the saddle in front of him. He went from\nranch to ranch in order to show him to the copper-colored populace, like\nan ancient monarch presenting his heir. Later on, when the child was\nable to say a few words, he entertained himself for hours at a time\ntalking with the tot under the shade of the eucalyptus tree. A certain\nmental failing was beginning to be noticed in the old man. Although not\nexactly in his dotage, his aggressiveness was becoming very childish.\nEven in his most affectionate moments, he used to contradict everybody,\nand hunt up ways of annoying his relatives.\n\n\"Come here, you false prophet,\" he would say to Julio. \"You are a\nFrenchy.\"\n\nThe grandchild protested as though he had been insulted. His mother had\ntaught him that he was an Argentinian, and his father had suggested that\nshe also add Spanish, in order to please the grandfather.\n\n\"Very well, then; if you are not a Frenchy, shout, 'Down with\nNapoleon!'\"\n\nAnd he looked around him to see if Desnoyers might be near, believing\nthat this would displease him greatly. But his son-in-law pursued the\neven tenor of his way, shrugging his shoulders.\n\n\"Down with Napoleon!\" repeated Julio.\n\nAnd he instantly held out his hand while his grandfather went through\nhis pockets.\n\nKarl's sons, now four in number, used to circle around their grandparent\nlike a humble chorus kept at a distance, and stare enviously at these\ngifts. In order to win his favor, they one day when they saw him alone,\ncame boldly up to him, shouting in unison, \"Down with Napoleon!\"\n\n\"You insolent gringoes!\" ranted the old man. \"That's what that shameless\nfather has taught you! If you say that again, I'll chase you with a\ncat-o-nine-tails. . . . The very idea of insulting a great man in that\nway!\"\n\nWhile he tolerated this blond brood, he never would permit the slightest\nintimacy. Desnoyers and his wife often had to come to their rescue,\naccusing the grandfather of injustice. And in order to pour the vials of\nhis wrath out on someone, the old plainsman would hunt up Celedonio, the\nbest of his listeners, who invariably replied, \"Yes, Patron. That's so,\nPatron.\"\n\n\"They're not to blame,\" agreed the old man, \"but I can't abide them!\nBesides, they are so like their father, so fair, with hair like a\nshredded carrot, and the two oldest wearing specs as if they were court\nclerks! . . . They don't seem like folks with those glasses; they look\nlike sharks.\"\n\nMadariaga had never seen any sharks, but he imagined them, without\nknowing why, with round, glassy eyes, like the bottoms of bottles.\n\nBy the time he was eight years old, Julio was a famous little\nequestrian. \"To horse, peoncito,\" his grandfather would cry, and away\nthey would race, streaking like lightning across the fields, midst\nthousands and thousands of horned herds. The \"peoncito,\" proud of his\ntitle, obeyed the master in everything, and so learned to whirl the\nlasso over the steers, leaving them bound and conquered. Upon making\nhis pony take a deep ditch or creep along the edge of the cliffs, he\nsometimes fell under his mount, but clambered up gamely.\n\n\"Ah, fine cowboy!\" exclaimed the grandfather bursting with pride in his\nexploits. \"Here are five dollars for you to give a handkerchief to some\nchina.\"\n\nThe old man, in his increasing mental confusion, did not gauge his gifts\nexactly with the lad's years; and the infantile horseman, while keeping\nthe money, was wondering what china was referred to, and why he should\nmake her a present.\n\nDesnoyers finally had to drag his son away from the baleful teachings\nof his grandfather. It was simply useless to have masters come to the\nhouse, or to send Julio to the country school. Madariaga would always\nsteal his grandson away, and then they would scour the plains together.\nSo when the boy was eleven years old, his father placed him in a big\nschool in the Capital.\n\nThe grandfather then turned his attention to Julio's three-year-old\nsister, exhibiting her before him as he had her brother, as he took her\nfrom ranch to ranch. Everybody called Chicha's little girl Chichi, but\nthe grandfather bestowed on her the same nickname that he had given her\nbrother, the \"peoncito.\" And Chichi, who was growing up wild, vigorous\nand wilful, breakfasting on meat and talking in her sleep of roast beef,\nreadily fell in with the old man's tastes. She was dressed like a boy,\nrode astride like a man, and in order to win her grandfather's praises\nas \"fine cowboy,\" carried a knife in the back of her belt. The two raced\nthe fields from sun to sun, Madariaga following the flying pigtail of\nthe little Amazon as though it were a flag. When nine years old she,\ntoo, could lasso the cattle with much dexterity.\n\nWhat most irritated the ranchman was that his family would remember his\nage. He received as insults his son-in-law's counsels to remain quietly\nat home, becoming more aggressive and reckless as he advanced in years,\nexaggerating his activity, as if he wished to drive Death away. He\naccepted no help except from his harum-scarum \"Peoncito.\" When Karl's\nchildren, great hulking youngsters, hastened to his assistance and\noffered to hold his stirrup, he would repel them with snorts of\nindignation.\n\n\"So you think I am no longer able to help myself, eh! . . . There's\nstill enough life in me to make those who are waiting for me to die, so\nas to grab my dollars, chew their disappointment a long while yet!\"\n\nSince the German and his wife were kept pointedly apart from the family\nlife, they had to put up with these allusions in silence. Karl,\nneeding protection, constantly shadowed the Frenchman, improving every\nopportunity to overwhelm him with his eulogies. He never could thank him\nenough for all that he had done for him. He was his only champion. He\nlonged for a chance to prove his gratitude, to die for him if necessary.\nHis wife admired him with enthusiasm as \"the most gifted knight in the\nworld.\" And Desnoyers received their devotion in gratified silence,\naccepting the German as an excellent comrade. As he controlled\nabsolutely the family fortune, he aided Karl very generously without\narousing the resentment of the old man. He also took the initiative in\nbringing about the realization of Karl's pet ambition--a visit to the\nFatherland. So many years in America! . . . For the very reason that\nDesnoyers himself had no desire to return to Europe, he wished to\nfacilitate Karl's trip, and gave him the means to make the journey with\nhis entire family. The father-in-law had no curiosity as to who paid the\nexpenses. \"Let them go!\" he said gleefully, \"and may they never return!\"\n\nTheir absence was not a very long one, for they spent their year's\nallowance in three months. Karl, who had apprised his parents of the\ngreat fortune which his marriage had brought him, wished to make an\nimpression as a millionaire, in full enjoyment of his riches. Elena\nreturned radiant, speaking with pride of her relatives--of the baron,\nColonel of Hussars, of the Captain of the Guard, of the Councillor\nat Court--asserting that all countries were most insignificant when\ncompared with her husband's. She even affected a certain condescension\ntoward Desnoyers, praising him as \"a very worthy man, but without\nancient lineage or distinguished family--and French, besides.\"\n\nKarl, on the other hand, showed the same devotion as before, keeping\nhimself submissively in the background when with his brother-in-law\nwho had the keys of the cash box and was his only defense against the\nbrowbeating old Patron. . . . He had left his two older sons in a school\nin Germany. Years afterwards they reached an equal footing with the\nother grandchildren of the Spaniard who always begrudged them their\nexistence, \"perfect frights, with carroty hair, and eyes like a shark.\"\n\nSuddenly the old man became very lonely, for they had also carried off\nhis second \"Peoncito.\" The good Chicha could not tolerate her daughter's\ngrowing up like a boy, parading 'round on horseback all the time, and\nglibly repeating her grandfather's vulgarities. So she was now in a\nconvent in the Capital, where the Sisters had to battle valiantly in\norder to tame the mischievous rebellion of their wild little pupil.\n\nWhen Julio and Chichi returned to the ranch for their vacations, the\ngrandfather again concentrated his fondness on the first, as though the\ngirl had merely been a substitute. Desnoyers was becoming indignant\nat his son's dissipated life. He was no longer at college, and his\nexistence was that of a student in a rich family who makes up for\nparental parsimony with all sorts of imprudent borrowings.\n\nBut Madariaga came to the defense of his grandson. \"Ah, the fine\ncowboy!\" . . . Seeing him again on the ranch, he admired the dash of the\ngood looking youth, testing his muscles in order to convince himself\nof their strength, and making him to recount his nightly escapades as\nringleader of a band of toughs in the Capital. He longed to go to Buenos\nAires himself, just to see the youngster in the midst of this gay, wild\nlife. But alas! he was not seventeen like his grandson; he had already\npassed eighty.\n\n\"Come here, you false prophet! Tell me how many children you have. . . .\nYou must have a great many children, you know!\"\n\n\"Father!\" protested Chicha who was always hanging around, fearing her\nparent's bad teachings.\n\n\"Stop nagging at me!\" yelled the irate old fellow in a towering temper.\n\"I know what I'm saying.\"\n\nPaternity figured largely in all his amorous fancies. He was almost\nblind, and the loss of his sight was accompanied by an increasing mental\nupset. His crazy senility took on a lewd character, expressing itself in\nlanguage which scandalized or amused the community.\n\n\"Oh, you rascal, what a pretty fellow you are!\" he said, leering at\nJulio with eyes which could no longer distinguish things except in a\nshadowy way. \"You are the living image of my poor dead wife. . . . Have\na good time, for Grandpa is always here with his money! If you could\nonly count on what your father gives you, you would live like a hermit.\nThese Frenchies are a close-fisted lot! But I am looking out for you.\nPeoncito! Spend and enjoy yourself--that's what your Granddaddy has\npiled up the silver for!\"\n\nWhen the Desnoyers children returned to the Capital, he spent his\nlonesome hours in going from ranch to ranch. A young half-breed would\nset the water for his shrub-tea to boiling on the hearth, and the old\nman would wonder confusedly if she were his daughter. Another, fifteen\nyears old, would offer him a gourd filled with the bitter liquid and a\nsilver pipe with which to sip it. . . . A grandchild, perhaps--he wasn't\nsure. And so he passed the afternoons, silent and sluggish, drinking\ngourd after gourd of shrub tea, surrounded by families who stared at him\nwith admiration and fear.\n\nEvery time he mounted his horse for these excursions, his older daughter\nwould protest. \"At eighty-four years! Would it not be better for him to\nremain quietly at home. . . .\" Some day something terrible would happen.\n. . . And the terrible thing did happen. One evening the Patron's\nhorse came slowly home without its rider. The old man had fallen on the\nsloping highway, and when they found him, he was dead. Thus died the\ncentaur as he had lived, with the lash hanging from his wrist, with his\nlegs bowed by the saddle.\n\nA Spanish notary, almost as old as he, produced the will. The family\nwas somewhat alarmed at seeing what a voluminous document it was. What\nterrible bequests had Madariaga dictated? The reading of the first part\ntranquilized Karl and Elena. The old father had left considerable more\nto the wife of Desnoyers, but there still remained an enormous share for\nthe Romantica and her children. \"I do this,\" he said, \"in memory of my\npoor dead wife, and so that people won't talk.\"\n\nAfter this, came eighty-six legacies. Eighty-five dark-hued individuals\n(women and men), who had lived on the ranch for many years as tenants\nand retainers, were to receive the last paternal munificence of the old\npatriarch. At the head of these was Celedonio whom Madariaga had greatly\nenriched in his lifetime for no heavier work than listening to him and\nrepeating, \"That's so, Patron, that's true!\" More than a million dollars\nwere represented by these bequests in lands and herds. The one who\ncompleted the list of beneficiaries was Julio Desnoyers. The grandfather\nhad made special mention of this namesake, leaving him a plantation \"to\nmeet his private expenses, making up for that which his father would not\ngive him.\"\n\n\"But that represents hundreds of thousands of dollars!\" protested Karl,\nwho had been making himself almost obnoxious in his efforts to assure\nhimself that his wife had not been overlooked in the will.\n\nThe days following the reading of this will were very trying ones for\nthe family. Elena and her children kept looking at the other group as\nthough they had just waked up, contemplating them in an entirely new\nlight. They seemed to forget what they were going to receive in their\nenvy of the much larger share of their relatives.\n\nDesnoyers, benevolent and conciliatory, had a plan. An expert in\nadministrative affairs, he realized that the distribution among the\nheirs was going to double the expenses without increasing the income. He\nwas calculating, besides, the complications and disbursements necessary\nfor a judicial division of nine immense ranches, hundreds of thousands\nof cattle, deposits in the banks, houses in the city, and debts to\ncollect. Would it not be better for them all to continue living as\nbefore? . . . Had they not lived most peaceably as a united family? . . .\n\nThe German received this suggestion by drawing himself up haughtily.\nNo; to each one should be given what was his. Let each live in his own\nsphere. He wished to establish himself in Europe, spending his wealth\nfreely there. It was necessary for him to return to \"his world.\"\n\nAs they looked squarely at each other, Desnoyers saw an unknown Karl,\na Karl whose existence he had never suspected when he was under his\nprotection, timid and servile. The Frenchman, too, was beginning to see\nthings in a new light.\n\n\"Very well,\" he assented. \"Let each take his own. That seems fair to\nme.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE DESNOYERS FAMILY\n\n\nThe \"Madariagan succession,\" as it was called in the language of\nthe legal men interested in prolonging it in order to augment their\nfees--was divided into two groups, separated by the ocean. The Desnoyers\nmoved to Buenos Aires. The Hartrotts moved to Berlin as soon as Karl\ncould sell all the legacy, to re-invest it in lands and industrial\nenterprises in his own country.\n\nDesnoyers no longer cared to live in the country. For twenty years,\nnow, he had been the head of an enormous agricultural and stock raising\nbusiness, overseeing hundreds of men in the various ranches. The\nparcelling out of the old man's fortune among Elena and the other\nlegatees had considerably constricted the radius of his authority,\nand it angered him to see established on the neighboring lands so many\nforeigners, almost all Germans, who had bought of Karl. Furthermore,\nhe was getting old, his wife's inheritance amounted to about twenty\nmillions of dollars, and perhaps his brother-in-law was showing the\nbetter judgment in returning to Europe.\n\nSo he leased some of the plantations, handed over the superintendence\nof others to those mentioned in the will who considered themselves\nleft-handed members of the family--of which Desnoyers as the Patron\nreceived their submissive allegiance--and moved to Buenos Aires.\n\nBy this move, he was able to keep an eye on his son who continued living\na dissipated life without making any headway in his engineering studies.\nThen, too, Chichi was now almost a woman--her robust development making\nher look older than she was--and it was not expedient to keep her on the\nestate to become a rustic senorita like her mother.\n\nDona Luisa had also tired of ranch life, the social triumphs of her\nsister making her a little restless. She was incapable of feeling\njealous, but material ambitions made her anxious that her children\nshould not bring up the rear of the procession in which the other\ngrandchildren were cutting such a dashing figure.\n\nDuring the year, most wonderful reports from Germany were finding their\nway to the Desnoyers home in the Capital. \"The aunt from Berlin,\" as the\nchildren called her, kept sending long letters filled with accounts\nof dances, dinners, hunting parties and titles--many high-sounding and\nmilitary titles;--\"our brother, the Colonel,\" \"our cousin, the Baron,\"\n\"our uncle, the Intimate Councillor,\" \"our great-uncle, the Truly\nIntimate.\" All the extravagances of the German social ladder, which\nincessantly manufactures new titles in order to satisfy the thirst for\nhonors of a people divided into castes, were enumerated with delight by\nthe old Romantica. She even mentioned her husband's secretary (a nobody)\nwho, through working in the public offices, had acquired the title of\nRechnungarath, Councillor of Calculations. She also referred with much\npride to the retired Oberpedell which she had in her house, explaining\nthat that meant \"Superior Porter.\"\n\nThe news about her children was no less glorious. The oldest was the\nwise one of the family. He was devoted to philology and the historical\nsciences, but his sight was growing weaker all the time because of his\nomnivorous reading. Soon he would be a Doctor, and before he was\nthirty, a Herr Professor. The mother lamented that he had not military\naspirations, considering that his tastes had somewhat distorted the\nlofty destinies of the family. Professorships, sciences and literature\nwere more properly the perquisites of the Jews, unable, because of their\nrace, to obtain preferment in the army; but she was trying to console\nherself by keeping in mind that a celebrated professor could, in time,\nacquire a social rank almost equal to that of a colonel.\n\nHer other four sons would become officers. Their father was preparing\nthe ground so that they might enter the Guard or some aristocratic\nregiment without any of the members being able to vote against their\nadmission. The two daughters would surely marry, when they had reached\na suitable age with officers of the Hussars whose names bore the magic\n\"von\" of petty nobility, haughty and charming gentlemen about whom the\ndaughter of Misia Petrona waxed most enthusiastic.\n\nThe establishment of the Hartrotts was in keeping with these new\nrelationships. In the home in Berlin, the servants wore knee-breeches\nand white wigs on the nights of great banquets. Karl had bought an old\ncastle with pointed towers, ghosts in the cellars, and various legends\nof assassinations, assaults and abductions which enlivened its history\nin an interesting way. An architect, decorated with many foreign orders,\nand bearing the title of \"Councillor of Construction,\" was engaged\nto modernize the mediaeval edifice without sacrificing its terrifying\naspect. The Romantica described in anticipation the receptions in the\ngloomy salon, the light diffused by electricity, simulating torches,\nthe crackling of the emblazoned hearth with its imitation logs bristling\nwith flames of gas, all the splendor of modern luxury combined with the\nsouvenirs of an epoch of omnipotent nobility--the best, according to\nher, in history. And the hunting parties, the future hunting parties!\n. . . in an annex of sandy and loose soil with pine woods--in no way\ncomparable to the rich ground of their native ranch, but which had the\nhonor of being trodden centuries ago by the Princes of Brandenburg,\nfounders of the reigning house of Prussia. And all this advancement in a\nsingle year! . . .\n\nThey had, of course, to compete with other oversea families who had\namassed enormous fortunes in the United States, Brazil or the Pacific\ncoast; but these were Germans \"without lineage,\" coarse plebeians who\nwere struggling in vain to force themselves into the great world by\nmaking donations to the imperial works. With all their millions, the\nvery most that they could ever hope to attain would be to marry their\ndaughters with ordinary soldiers. Whilst Karl! . . . The relatives of\nKarl! . . . and the Romantica let her pen run on, glorifying a family in\nwhose bosom she fancied she had been born.\n\nFrom time to time were enclosed with Elena's effusions brief, crisp\nnotes directed to Desnoyers. The brother-in-law continued giving an\naccount of his operations the same as when living on the ranch under\nhis protection. But with this deference was now mixed a badly concealed\npride, an evident desire to retaliate for his times of voluntary\nhumiliation. Everything that he was doing was grand and glorious. He had\ninvested his millions in the industrial enterprises of modern Germany.\nHe was stockholder of munition factories as big as towns, and of\nnavigation companies launching a ship every half year. The Emperor was\ninteresting himself in these works, looking benevolently on all those\nwho wished to aid him. Besides this, Karl was buying land. At first\nsight, it seemed foolish to have sold the fertile fields of their\ninheritance in order to acquire sandy Prussian wastes that yielded only\nto much artificial fertilizing; but by becoming a land owner, he now\nbelonged to the \"Agrarian Party,\" the aristocratic and conservative\ngroup par excellence, and thus he was living in two different but\nequally distinguished worlds--that of the great industrial friends\nof the Emperor, and that of the Junkers, knights of the countryside,\nguardians of the old traditions and the supply-source of the officials\nof the King of Prussia.\n\nOn hearing of these social strides, Desnoyers could not but think of the\npecuniary sacrifices which they must represent. He knew Karl's past,\nfor on the ranch, under an impulse of gratitude, the German had one day\nrevealed to the Frenchman the cause of his coming to America. He was\na former officer in the German army, but the desire of living\nostentatiously without other resources than his salary, had dragged him\ninto committing such reprehensible acts as abstracting funds belonging\nto the regiment, incurring debts of honor and paying for them with\nforged signatures. These crimes had not been officially prosecuted\nthrough consideration of his father's memory, but the members of his\ndivision had submitted him to a tribunal of honor. His brothers and\nfriends had advised him to shoot himself as the only remedy; but\nhe loved life and had fled to South America where, in spite of\nhumiliations, he had finally triumphed.\n\nWealth effaces the spots of the past even more rapidly than Time. The\nnews of his fortune on the other side of the ocean made his family give\nhim a warm reception on his first voyage home; introducing him again\ninto their world. Nobody could remember shameful stories about a few\nhundred marks concerning a man who was talking about his father-in-law's\nlands, more extensive than many German principalities. Now, upon\ninstalling himself definitely in his country, all was forgotten. But,\noh, the contributions levied upon his vanity . . . Desnoyers shrewdly\nguessed at the thousands of marks poured with both hands into the\ncharitable works of the Empress, into the imperialistic propagandas,\ninto the societies of veterans, into the clubs of aggression and\nexpansion organized by German ambition.\n\nThe frugal Frenchman, thrifty in his expenditures and free from social\nambitions, smiled at the grandeurs of his brother-in-law. He considered\nKarl an excellent companion although of a childish pride. He recalled\nwith satisfaction the years that they had passed together in the\ncountry. He could not forget the German who was always hovering around\nhim, affectionate and submissive as a younger brother. When his family\ncommented with a somewhat envious vivacity upon the glories of their\nBerlin relatives, Desnoyers would say smilingly, \"Leave them in peace;\nthey are paying very dear for their whistle.\"\n\nBut the enthusiasm which the letters from Germany breathed finally\ncreated an atmosphere of disquietude and rebellion. Chichi led the\nattack. Why were they not going to Europe like other folks? all their\nfriends had been there. Even the Italian and Spanish shopkeepers were\nmaking the voyage, while she, the daughter of a Frenchman, had never\nseen Paris! . . . Oh, Paris. The doctors in attendance on melancholy\nladies were announcing the existence of a new and terrible disease, \"the\nmania for Paris.\" Dona Luisa supported her daughter. Why had she not\ngone to live in Europe like her sister, since she was the richer of the\ntwo? Even Julio gravely declared that in the old world he could study to\nbetter advantage. America is not the land of the learned.\n\nInfected by the general unrest, the father finally began to wonder\nwhy the idea of going to Europe had not occurred to him long before.\nThirty-four years without going to that country which was not his!\n. . . It was high time to start! He was living too near to his business. In\nvain the retired ranchman had tried to keep himself indifferent to the\nmoney market. Everybody was coining money around him. In the club, in\nthe theatre, wherever he went, the people were talking about purchases\nof lands, of sales of stock, of quick negotiations with a triple profit,\nof portentous balances. The amount of money that he was keeping idle in\nthe banks was beginning to weigh upon him. He finally ended by involving\nhimself in some speculation; like a gambler who cannot see the roulette\nwheel without putting his hand in his pocket.\n\nHis family was right. \"To Paris!\" For in the Desnoyers' mind, to go to\nEurope meant, of course, to go to Paris. Let the \"aunt from Berlin\" keep\non chanting the glories of her husband's country! \"It's sheer nonsense!\"\nexclaimed Julio who had made grave geographical and ethnic comparisons\nin his nightly forays. \"There is no place but Paris!\" Chichi saluted\nwith an ironical smile the slightest doubt of it--\"Perhaps they make as\nelegant fashions in Germany as in Paris? . . . Bah!\" Dona Luisa took up\nher children's cry. \"Paris!\" . . . Never had it even occurred to her to\ngo to a Lutheran land to be protected by her sister.\n\n\"Let it be Paris, then!\" said the Frenchman, as though he were speaking\nof an unknown city.\n\nHe had accustomed himself to believe that he would never return to it.\nDuring the first years of his life in America, the trip would have been\nan impossibility because of the military service which he had evaded.\nThen he had vague news of different amnesties. After the time for\nconscription had long since passed, an inertness of will had made him\nconsider a return to his country as somewhat absurd and useless. On the\nother side, nothing remained to attract him. He had even lost track of\nthose country relatives with whom his mother had lived. In his heaviest\nhours he had tried to occupy his activity by planning an enormous\nmausoleum, all of marble, in La Recoleta, the cemetery of the rich,\nin order to move thither the remains of Madariaga as founder of the\ndynasty, following him with all his own when their hour should come.\nHe was beginning to feel the weight of age. He was nearly seventy years\nold, and the rude life of the country, the horseback rides in the rain,\nthe rivers forded upon his swimming horse, the nights passed in the open\nair, had brought on a rheumatism that was torturing his best days.\n\nHis family, however, reawakened his enthusiasm. \"To Paris!\" . . . He\nbegan to fancy that he was twenty again, and forgetting his habitual\nparsimony, wished his household to travel like royalty, in the most\nluxurious staterooms, and with personal servants. Two copper-hued\ncountry girls, born on the ranch and elevated to the rank of maids\nto the senora and her daughter, accompanied them on the voyage, their\noblique eyes betraying not the slightest astonishment before the\ngreatest novelties.\n\nOnce in Paris, Desnoyers found himself quite bewildered. He confused\nthe names of streets, proposed visits to buildings which had long since\ndisappeared, and all his attempts to prove himself an expert authority\non Paris were attended with disappointment. His children, guided by\nrecent reading up, knew Paris better than he. He was considered\na foreigner in his own country. At first, he even felt a certain\nstrangeness in using his native tongue, for he had remained on the ranch\nwithout speaking a word of his language for years at a time. He was used\nto thinking in Spanish, and translating his ideas into the speech of his\nancestors spattered his French with all kinds of Creole dialect.\n\n\"Where a man makes his fortune and raises his family, there is his true\ncountry,\" he said sententiously, remembering Madariaga.\n\nThe image of that distant country dominated him with insistent obsession\nas soon as the impressions of the voyage had worn off. He had no French\nfriends, and upon going into the street, his feet instinctively took him\nto the places where the Argentinians gathered together. It was the same\nwith them. They had left their country only to feel, with increasing\nintensity, the desire to talk about it all the time. There he read the\npapers, commenting on the rising prices in the fields, on the prospects\nfor the next harvests and on the sales of cattle. Returning home, his\nthoughts were still in America, and he chuckled with delight as he\nrecalled the way in which the two chinas had defied the professional\ndignity of the French cook, preparing their native stews and other\ndishes in Creole style.\n\nHe had settled the family in an ostentatious house in the avenida Victor\nHugo, for which he paid a rental of twenty-eight thousand francs. Dona\nLuisa had to go and come many times before she could accustom herself to\nthe imposing aspect of the concierges--he, decorated with gold trimmings\non his black uniform and wearing white whiskers like a notary in a\ncomedy, she with a chain of gold upon her exuberant bosom, and receiving\nthe tenants in a red and gold salon. In the rooms above was ultra-modern\nluxury, gilded and glacial, with white walls and glass doors with\ntiny panes which exasperated Desnoyers, who longed for the complicated\ncarvings and rich furniture in vogue during his youth. He himself\ndirected the arrangement and furnishings of the various rooms which\nalways seemed empty.\n\nChichi protested against her father's avarice when she saw him buying\nslowly and with much calculation and hesitation. \"Avarice, no!\" he\nretorted, \"it is because I know the worth of things.\"\n\nNothing pleased him that he had not acquired at one-third of its value.\nBeating down those who overcharged but proved the superiority of the\nbuyer. Paris offered him one delightful spot which he could not find\nanywhere else in the world--the Hotel Drouot. He would go there every\nafternoon that he did not find other important auctions advertised in\nthe papers. For many years, there was no famous failure in Parisian\nlife, with its consequent liquidation, from which he did not carry\nsomething away. The use and need of these prizes were matters of\nsecondary interest, the great thing was to get them for ridiculous\nprices. So the trophies from the auction-rooms now began to inundate\nthe apartment which, at the beginning, he had been furnishing with such\ndesperate slowness.\n\nHis daughter now complained that the home was getting overcrowded. The\nfurnishings and ornaments were handsome, but too many . . . far too\nmany! The white walls seemed to scowl at the magnificent sets of chairs\nand the overflowing glass cabinets. Rich and velvety carpets over\nwhich had passed many generations, covered all the compartments. Showy\ncurtains, not finding a vacant frame in the salons, adorned the doors\nleading into the kitchen. The wall mouldings gradually disappeared\nunder an overlay of pictures, placed close together like the scales of\na cuirass. Who now could accuse Desnoyers of avarice? . . . He was\ninvesting far more than a fashionable contractor would have dreamed of\nspending.\n\nThe underlying idea still was to acquire all this for a fourth of its\nprice--an exciting bait which lured the economical man into continuous\ndissipation. He could sleep well only when he had driven a good bargain\nduring the day. He bought at auction thousands of bottles of wine\nconsigned by bankrupt firms, and he who scarcely ever drank, packed his\nwine cellars to overflowing, advising his family to use the champagne as\nfreely as ordinary wine. The failure of a furrier induced him to buy for\nfourteen thousand francs pelts worth ninety thousand. In consequence,\nthe entire Desnoyers family seemed suddenly to be suffering as\nfrightfully from cold as though a polar iceberg had invaded the avenida\nVictor Hugo. The father kept only one fur coat for himself but ordered\nthree for his son. Chichi and Dona Luisa appeared arrayed in all kinds\nof silky and luxurious skins--one day chinchilla, other days blue fox,\nmarten or seal.\n\nThe enraptured buyer would permit no one but himself to adorn the\nwalls with his new acquisitions, using the hammer from the top of a\nstep-ladder in order to save the expense of a professional picture\nhanger. He wished to set his children the example of economy. In his\nidle hours, he would change the position of the heaviest pieces of\nfurniture, trying every kind of combination. This employment reminded\nhim of those happy days when he handled great sacks of wheat and bundles\nof hides on the ranch. Whenever his son noticed that he was looking\nthoughtfully at a monumental sideboard or heavy piece, he prudently\nbetook himself to other haunts.\n\nDesnoyers stood a little in awe of the two house-men, very solemn,\ncorrect creatures always in dress suit, who could not hide their\nastonishment at seeing a man with an income of more than a million\nfrancs engaged in such work. Finally it was the two coppery maids\nwho aided their Patron, the three working contentedly together like\ncompanions in exile.\n\nFour automobiles completed the luxuriousness of the family. The children\nwould have been more content with one--small and dashing, in the very\nlatest style. But Desnoyers was not the man to let a bargain slip past\nhim, so one after the other, he had picked up the four, tempted by the\nprice. They were as enormous and majestic as coaches of state. Their\nentrance into a street made the passers-by turn and stare. The chauffeur\nneeded two assistants to help him keep this flock of mastodons in order,\nbut the proud owner thought only of the skill with which he had gotten\nthe best of the salesmen, anxious to get such monuments out of their\nsight.\n\nTo his children he was always recommending simplicity and economy. \"We\nare not as rich as you suppose. We own a good deal of property, but it\nproduces a scanty income.\"\n\nAnd then, after refusing a domestic expenditure of two hundred francs,\nhe would put five thousand into an unnecessary purchase just because\nit would mean a great loss to the seller. Julio and his sister kept\nprotesting to their mother, Dona Luisa--Chichi even going so far as to\nannounce that she would never marry a man like her father.\n\n\"Hush, hush!\" exclaimed the scandalized Creole. \"He has his little\npeculiarities, but he is very good. Never has he given me any cause for\ncomplaint. I only hope that you may be lucky enough to find his equal.\"\n\nHer husband's quarrelsomeness, his irritable character and his masterful\nwill all sank into insignificance when she thought of his unvarying\nfidelity. In so many years of married life . . . nothing! His\nfaithfulness had been unexceptional even in the country where many,\nsurrounded by beasts, and intent on increasing their flocks, had seemed\nto become contaminated by the general animalism. She remembered her\nfather only too well! . . . Even her sister was obliged to live\nin apparent calmness with the vainglorious Karl, quite capable of\ndisloyalty not because of any special lust, but just to imitate the\ndoings of his superiors.\n\nDesnoyers and his wife were plodding through life in a routine\naffection, reminding Dona Luisa, in her limited imagination, of the\nyokes of oxen on the ranch who refused to budge whenever another animal\nwas substituted for the regular companion. Her husband certainly was\nquick tempered, holding her responsible for all the whims with which he\nexasperated his children, yet he could never bear to have her out of his\nsight. The afternoons at the hotel Drouot would be most insipid for him\nunless she was at his side, the confidante of his plans and wrathful\noutbursts.\n\n\"To-day there is to be a sale of jewels; shall we go?\"\n\nHe would make this proposition in such a gentle and coaxing voice--the\nvoice that Dona Luisa remembered in their first talks around the old\nhome. And so they would go together, but by different routes;--she in\none of the monumental vehicles because, accustomed to the leisurely\ncarriage rides of the ranch, she no longer cared to walk; and\nDesnoyers--although owner of the four automobiles, heartily abominating\nthem because he was conservative and uneasy with the complications of\nnew machinery--on foot under the pretext that, through lack of work, his\nbody needed the exercise. When they met in the crowded salesrooms, they\nproceeded to examine the jewels together, fixing beforehand, the price\nthey would offer. But he, quick to become exasperated by opposition,\nalways went further, hurling numbers at his competitors as though they\nwere blows. After such excursions, the senora would appear as majestic\nand dazzling as a basilica of Byzantium--ears and neck decorated\nwith great pearls, her bosom a constellation of brilliants, her hands\nradiating points of light of all colors of the rainbow.\n\n\"Too much, mama,\" Chichi would protest. \"They will take you for a\npawnbroker's lady!\" But the Creole, satisfied with her splendor, the\ncrowning glory of a humble life, attributed her daughter's faultfinding\nto envy. Chichi was only a girl now, but later on she would thank her\nfor having collected all these gems for her.\n\nAlready the home was unable to accommodate so many purchases. In\nthe cellars were piled up enough paintings, furniture, statues, and\ndraperies to equip several other dwellings. Don Marcelo began to\ncomplain of the cramped space in an apartment costing twenty-eight\nthousand francs a year--in reality large enough for a family four times\nthe size of his. He was beginning to deplore being obliged to renounce\nsome very tempting furniture bargains when a real estate agent smelled\nout the foreigner and relieved him of his embarrassment. Why not buy a\ncastle? . . .\n\nThe entire family was delighted with the idea. An historic castle, the\nmost historic that could be found, would supplement their luxurious\nestablishment. Chichi paled with pride. Some of her friends had castles.\nOthers, of old colonial family, who were accustomed to look down upon\nher for her country bringing up, would now cry with envy upon learning\nof this acquisition which was almost a patent of nobility. The mother\nsmiled in the hope of months in the country which would recall the\nsimple and happy life of her youth. Julio was less enthusiastic. The\n\"old man\" would expect him to spend much time away from Paris, but he\nconsoled himself by reflecting that the suburban place would provide\nexcuse for frequent automobile trips.\n\nDesnoyers thought of the relatives in Berlin. Why should he not have\nhis castle like the others? . . . The bargains were alluring. Historic\nmansions by the dozen were offered him. Their owners, exhausted by\nthe expense of maintaining them, were more than anxious to sell. So he\nbought the castle of Villeblanche-sur-Marne, built in the time of\nthe religious wars--a mixture of palace and fortress with an Italian\nRenaissance facade, gloomy towers with pointed hoods, and moats in which\nswans were swimming.\n\nHe could now live with some tracts of land over which to exercise his\nauthority, struggling again with the resistance of men and things.\nBesides, the vast proportions of the rooms of the castle were very\ntempting and bare of furniture. This opportunity for placing the\noverflow from his cellars plunged him again into buying. With this\natmosphere of lordly gloom, the antiques would harmonize beautifully,\nwithout that cry of protest which they always seemed to make when placed\nin contact with the glaring white walls of modern habitations. The\nhistoric residence required an endless outlay; on that account it had\nchanged owners so many times.\n\nBut he and the land understood each other beautifully. . . . So at the\nsame time that he was filling the salons, he was going to begin farming\nand stock-raising in the extensive parks--a reproduction in miniature\nof his enterprises in South America. The property ought to be made\nself-supporting. Not that he had any fear of the expenses, but he did\nnot intend to lose money on the proposition.\n\nThe acquisition of the castle brought Desnoyers a true friendship--the\nchief advantage in the transaction. He became acquainted with a\nneighbor, Senator Lacour, who twice had been Minister of State, and was\nnow vegetating in the senate, silent during its sessions, but restless\nand voluble in the corridors in order to maintain his influence. He was\na prominent figure of the republican nobility, an aristocrat of the new\nregime that had sprung from the agitations of the Revolution, just\nas the titled nobility had won their spurs in the Crusades. His\ngreat-grandfather had belonged to the Convention. His father had figured\nin the Republic of 1848. He, as the son of an exile who had died in\nbanishment, had when very young marched behind the grandiloquent figure\nof Gambetta, and always spoke in glowing terms of the Master, in the\nhope that some of his rays might be reflected on his disciple. His son\nRene, a pupil of the Ecole Centrale regarded his father as \"a rare\nold sport,\" laughing a little at his romantic and humanitarian\nrepublicanism. He, nevertheless, was counting much on that same official\nprotection treasured by four generations of Lacours dedicated to the\nservice of the Republic, to assist him when he became an engineer.\n\nDon Marcelo who used to look uneasily upon any new friendship, fearing a\ndemand for a loan, gave himself up with enthusiasm to intimacy with this\n\"grand man.\" The personage admired riches and recognized, besides,\na certain genius in this millionaire from the other side of the sea\naccustomed to speaking of limitless pastures and immense herds.\nTheir intercourse was more than the mere friendliness of a country\nneighborhood, and continued on after their return to Paris. Finally Rene\nvisited the home on the avenida Victor Hugo as though it were his own.\n\nThe only disappointments in Desnoyers' new life came from his children.\nChichi irritated him because of the independence of her tastes. She did\nnot like antiques, no matter how substantial and magnificent they might\nbe, much preferring the frivolities of the latest fashion. She accepted\nall her father's gifts with great indifference. Before an exquisite\nblonde piece of lace, centuries old, picked up at auction, she made\na wry face, saying, \"I would much rather have had a new dress costing\nthree hundred francs.\" She and her brother were solidly opposed to\neverything old.\n\nNow that his daughter was already a woman, he had confided her\nabsolutely to the care of Dona Luisa. But the former \"Peoncito\" was not\nshowing much respect for the advice and commands of the good natured\nCreole. She had taken up roller-skating with enthusiasm, regarding it as\nthe most elegant of diversions. She would go every afternoon to the Ice\nPalace, Dona Luisa chaperoning her, although to do this she was obliged\nto give up accompanying her husband to his sales. Oh, the hours of\ndeadly weariness before that frozen oval ring, watching the white circle\nof balancing human monkeys gliding by on runners to the sound of an\norgan! . . . Her daughter would pass and repass before her tired eyes,\nrosy from the exercise, spirals of hair escaped from her hat, streaming\nout behind, the folds of her skirt swinging above her skates--handsome,\nathletic and Amazonian, with the rude health of a child who, according\nto her father, \"had been weaned on beefsteaks.\"\n\nFinally Dona Luisa rebelled against this troublesome vigilance,\npreferring to accompany her husband on his hunt for underpriced riches.\nChichi went to the skating rink with one of the dark-skinned maids,\npassing the afternoons with her sporty friends of the new world.\nTogether they ventilated their ideas under the glare of the easy life\nof Paris, freed from the scruples and conventions of their native land.\nThey all thought themselves older than they were, delighting to discover\nin each other unsuspected charms. The change from the other hemisphere\nhad altered their sense of values. Some were even writing verses in\nFrench. And Desnoyers became alarmed, giving free rein to his bad humor,\nwhen Chichi of evenings, would bring forth as aphorisms that which she\nand her friends had been discussing, as a summary of their readings and\nobservations.--\"Life is life, and one must live! . . . I will marry the\nman I love, no matter who he may be. . . .\"\n\nBut the daughter's independence was as nothing compared to the worry\nwhich the other child gave the Desnoyers. Ay, that other one! . . .\nJulio, upon arriving in Paris, had changed the bent of his aspirations.\nHe no longer thought of becoming an engineer; he wished to become\nan artist. Don Marcelo objected in great consternation, but finally\nyielded. Let it be painting! The important thing was to have some\nregular profession. The father, while he considered property and wealth\nas sacred rights, felt that no one should enjoy them who had not worked\nto acquire them.\n\nRecalling his apprenticeship as a wood carver, he began to hope that the\nartistic instincts which poverty had extinguished in him were, perhaps,\nreappearing in his son. What if this lazy boy, this lively genius,\nhesitating before taking up his walk in life, should turn out to be\na famous painter, after all! . . . So he agreed to all of Julio's\ncaprices, the budding artist insisting that for his first efforts in\ndrawing and coloring, he needed a separate apartment where he could work\nwith more freedom. His father, therefore, established him near his home,\nin the rue de la Pompe in the former studio of a well-known foreign\npainter. The workroom and its annexes were far too large for an amateur,\nbut the owner had died, and Desnoyers improved the opportunity offered\nby the heirs, and bought at a remarkable bargain, the entire plant,\npictures and furnishings.\n\nDona Luisa at first visited the studio daily like a good mother, caring\nfor the well-being of her son that he may work to better advantage.\nTaking off her gloves, she emptied the brass trays filled with cigar\nstubs and dusted the furniture powdered with the ashes fallen from the\npipes. Julio's visitors, long-haired young men who spoke of things\nthat she could not understand, seemed to her rather careless in their\nmanners. . . . Later on she also met there women, very lightly clad, and\nwas received with scowls by her son. Wasn't his mother ever going to let\nhim work in peace? . . . So the poor lady, starting out in the morning\ntoward the rue de la Pompe, stopped midway and went instead to the\nchurch of Saint Honore d'Eylau.\n\nThe father displayed more prudence. A man of his years could not expect\nto mingle with the chums of a young artist. In a few months' time, Julio\npassed entire weeks without going to sleep under the paternal roof.\nFinally he installed himself permanently in his studio, occasionally\nmaking a flying trip home that his family might know that he was still\nin existence. . . . Some mornings, Desnoyers would arrive at the rue de\nla Pompe in order to ask a few questions of the concierge. It was ten\no'clock; the artist was sleeping. Upon returning at midday, he learned\nthat the heavy sleep still continued. Soon after lunch, another visit\nto get better news. It was two o'clock, the young gentleman was just\narising. So the father would retire, muttering stormily--\"But when does\nthis painter ever paint?\" . . .\n\nAt first Julio had tried to win renown with his brush, believing that\nit would prove an easy task. In true artist fashion, he collected his\nfriends around him, South American boys with nothing to do but enjoy\nlife, scattering money ostentatiously so that everybody might know\nof their generosity. With serene audacity, the young canvas-dauber\nundertook to paint portraits. He loved good painting, \"distinctive\"\npainting, with the cloying sweetness of a romance, that copied only the\nforms of women. He had money, a good studio, his father was standing\nbehind him ready to help--why shouldn't he accomplish as much as many\nothers who lacked his opportunities? . . .\n\nSo he began his work by coloring a canvas entitled, \"The Dance of the\nHours,\" a mere pretext for copying pretty girls and selecting buxom\nmodels. These he would sketch at a mad speed, filling in the outlines\nwith blobs of multi-colored paint, and up to this point all went well.\nThen he would begin to vacillate, remaining idle before the picture only\nto put it in the corner in hope of later inspiration. It was the same\nway with his various studies of feminine heads. Finding that he was\nnever able to finish anything, he soon became resigned, like one\nwho pants with fatigue before an obstacle waiting for a providential\ninterposition to save him. The important thing was to be a painter . . .\neven though he might not paint anything. This afforded him the\nopportunity, on the plea of lofty aestheticism, of sending out cards\nof invitation and asking light women to his studio. He lived during\nthe night. Don Marcelo, upon investigating the artist's work, could not\ncontain his indignation. Every morning the two Desnoyers were accustomed\nto greet the first hours of dawn--the father leaping from his bed, the\nson, on his way home to his studio to throw himself upon his couch not\nto wake till midday.\n\nThe credulous Dona Luisa would invent the most absurd explanations to\ndefend her son. Who could tell? Perhaps he had the habit of painting\nduring the night, utilizing it for original work. Men resort to so many\ndevilish things! . . .\n\nDesnoyers knew very well what these nocturnal gusts of genius were\namounting to--scandals in the restaurants of Montmartre, and scrimmages,\nmany scrimmages. He and his gang, who believed that at seven a full\ndress or Tuxedo was indispensable, were like a band of Indians, bringing\nto Paris the wild customs of the plains. Champagne always made them\nquarrelsome. So they broke and paid, but their generosities were almost\ninvariably followed by a scuffle. No one could surpass Julio in the\nquick slap and the ready card. His father heard with a heavy heart the\nnews brought him by some friends thinking to flatter his vanity--his\nson was always victorious in these gentlemanly encounters; he it was who\nalways scratched the enemy's skin. The painter knew more about fencing\nthan art. He was a champion with various weapons; he could box, and was\neven skilled in the favorite blows of the prize fighters of the slums.\n\"Useless as a drone, and as dangerous, too,\" fretted his father. And\nyet in the back of his troubled mind fluttered an irresistible\nsatisfaction--an animal pride in the thought that this hare-brained\nterror was his own.\n\nFor a while, he thought that he had hit upon a way of withdrawing his\nson from such an existence. The relatives in Berlin had visited\nthe Desnoyers in their castle of Villeblanche. With good-natured\nsuperiority, Karl von Hartrott had appreciated the rich and rather\nabsurd accumulations of his brother-in-law. They were not bad; he\nadmitted that they gave a certain cachet to the home in Paris and to the\ncastle. They smacked of the possessions of titled nobility. But Germany!\n. . . The comforts and luxuries in his country! . . . He just wished his\nbrother-in-law to admire the way he lived and the noble friendships that\nembellished his opulence. And so he insisted in his letters that the\nDesnoyers family should return their visit. This change of environment\nmight tone Julio down a little. Perhaps his ambition might waken on\nseeing the diligence of his cousins, each with a career. The Frenchman\nhad, besides, an underlying belief in the more corrupt influence of\nParis as compared with the purity of the customs in Patriarchal Germany.\n\nThey were there four months. In a little while Desnoyers felt ready to\nretreat. Each to his own kind; he would never be able to understand\nsuch people. Exceedingly amiable, with an abject amiability and evident\ndesire to please, but constantly blundering through a tactless desire to\nmake their grandeur felt. The high-toned friends of Hartrott emphasized\ntheir love for France, but it was the pious love that a weak and\nmischievous child inspires, needing protection. And they would accompany\ntheir affability with all manner of inopportune memories of the wars in\nwhich France had been conquered. Everything in Germany--a monument, a\nrailroad station, a simple dining-room device, instantly gave rise to\nglorious comparisons. \"In France, you do not have this,\" \"Of course, you\nnever saw anything like this in America.\"\n\nDon Marcelo came away fatigued by so much condescension, and his wife\nand daughter refused to be convinced that the elegance of Berlin could\nbe superior to Paris. Chichi, with audacious sacrilege, scandalized her\ncousins by declaring that she could not abide the corseted officers with\nimmovable monocle, who bowed to the women with such automatic rigidity,\nblending their gallantries with an air of superiority.\n\nJulio, guided by his cousins, was saturated in the virtuous atmosphere\nof Berlin. With the oldest, \"The Sage,\" he had nothing to do. He was a\npoor creature devoted to his books who patronized all the family with\na protecting air. It was the others, the sub-lieutenants or military\nstudents, who proudly showed him the rounds of German joy.\n\nJulio was accordingly introduced to all the night\nrestaurants--imitations of those in Paris, but on a much larger scale.\nThe women who in Paris might be counted by the dozens appeared here\nin hundreds. The scandalous drunkenness here never came by chance,\nbut always by design as an indispensable part of the gaiety. All was\ngrandiose, glittering, colossal. The libertines diverted themselves\nin platoons, the public got drunk in companies, the harlots presented\nthemselves in regiments. He felt a sensation of disgust before these\ntimid and servile females, accustomed to blows, who were so eagerly\ntrying to reimburse themselves for the losses and exposures of their\nbusiness. For him, it was impossible to celebrate with hoarse ha-has,\nlike his cousins, the discomfiture of these women when they realized\nthat they had wasted so many hours without accomplishing more than\nabundant drinking. The gross obscenity, so public and noisy, like a\nparade of riches, was loathsome to Julio. \"There is nothing like this\nin Paris,\" his cousins repeatedly exulted as they admired the stupendous\nsalons, the hundreds of men and women in pairs, the thousands of\ntipplers. \"No, there certainly was nothing like that in Paris.\" He was\nsick of such boundless pretension. He seemed to be attending a fiesta\nof hungry mariners anxious at one swoop to make amends for all former\nprivations. Like his father, he longed to get away. It offended his\naesthetic sense.\n\nDon Marcelo returned from this visit with melancholy resignation. Those\npeople had undoubtedly made great strides. He was not such a blind\npatriot that he could not admit what was so evident. Within a few years\nthey had transformed their country, and their industry was astonishing\n. . . but, well . . . it was simply impossible to have anything to do\nwith them. Each to his own, but may they never take a notion to envy\ntheir neighbor! . . . Then he immediately repelled this last suspicion\nwith the optimism of a business man.\n\n\"They are going to be very rich,\" he thought. \"Their affairs are\nprospering, and he that is rich does not hunt quarrels. That war of\nwhich some crazy fools are always dreaming would be an impossible\nthing.\"\n\nYoung Desnoyers renewed his Parisian existence, living entirely in the\nstudio and going less and less to his father's home. Dona Luisa began to\nspeak of a certain Argensola, a very learned young Spaniard, believing\nthat his counsels might prove most helpful to Julio. She did not know\nexactly whether this new companion was friend, master or servant. The\nstudio habitues also had their doubts. The literary ones always spoke\nof Argensola as a painter. The painters recognized only his ability as a\nman of letters. He was among those who used to come up to the studio\nof winter afternoons, attracted by the ruddy glow of the stove and the\nwines secretly provided by the mother, holding forth authoritatively\nbefore the often-renewed bottle and the box of cigars lying open on the\ntable. One night, he slept on the divan, as he had no regular quarters.\nAfter that first night, he lived entirely in the studio.\n\nJulio soon discovered in him an admirable reflex of his own personality.\nHe knew that Argensola had come third-class from Madrid with twenty\nfrancs in his pocket, in order to \"capture glory,\" to use his own words.\nUpon observing that the Spaniard was painting with as much difficulty\nas himself, with the same wooden and childish strokes, which are so\ncharacteristic of the make-believe artists and pot-boilers, the routine\nworkers concerned themselves with color and other rank fads. Argensola\nwas a psychological artist, a painter of souls. And his disciple, felt\nastonished and almost displeased on learning what a comparatively simple\nthing it was to paint a soul. Upon a bloodless countenance, with a chin\nas sharp as a dagger, the gifted Spaniard would trace a pair of nearly\nround eyes, and at the centre of each pupil he would aim a white brush\nstroke, a point of light . . . the soul. Then, planting himself\nbefore the canvas, he would proceed to classify this soul with his\ninexhaustible imagination, attributing to it almost every kind of stress\nand extremity. So great was the sway of his rapture that Julio, too, was\nable to see all that the artist flattered himself into believing that he\nhad put into the owlish eyes. He, also, would paint souls . . . souls of\nwomen.\n\nIn spite of the ease with which he developed his psychological\ncreations, Argensola preferred to talk, stretched on a divan, or to\nread, hugging the fire while his friend and protector was outside.\nAnother advantage this fondness for reading gave young Desnoyers was\nthat he was no longer obliged to open a volume, scanning the index and\nlast pages \"just to get the idea.\" Formerly when frequenting society\nfunctions, he had been guilty of coolly asking an author which was his\nbest book--his smile of a clever man--giving the writer to understand\nthat he merely enquired so as not to waste time on the other volumes.\nNow it was no longer necessary to do this; Argensola would read for him.\nAs soon as Julio would see him absorbed in a book, he would demand an\nimmediate share: \"Tell me the story.\" So the \"secretary,\" not only gave\nhim the plots of comedies and novels, but also detailed the argument of\nSchopenhauer or of Nietzsche . . . Dona Luisa almost wept on hearing her\nvisitors--with that benevolence which wealth always inspires--speak of\nher son as \"a rather gay young man, but wonderfully well read!\"\n\nIn exchange for his lessons, Argensola received, much the same treatment\nas did the Greek slaves who taught rhetoric to the young patricians of\ndecadent Rome. In the midst of a dissertation, his lord and friend would\ninterrupt him with--\"Get my dress suit ready. I am invited out this\nevening.\"\n\nAt other times, when the instructor was luxuriating in bodily comfort,\nwith a book in one hand near the roaring stove, seeing through the\nwindows the gray and rainy afternoon, his disciple would suddenly appear\nsaying, \"Quick, get out! . . . There's a woman coming!\"\n\nAnd Argensola, like a dog who gets up and shakes himself, would\ndisappear to continue his reading in some miserable little coffee house\nin the neighborhood.\n\nIn his official capacity, this widely gifted man often descended from\nthe peaks of intellectuality to the vulgarities of everyday life. He\nwas the steward of the lord of the manor, the intermediary between the\npocketbook and those who appeared bill in hand. \"Money!\" he would say\nlaconically at the end of the month, and Desnoyers would break out into\ncomplaints and curses. Where on earth was he to get it, he would like to\nknow. His father was as regular as a machine, and would never allow the\nslightest advance upon the following month. He had to submit to a rule\nof misery. Three thousand francs a month!--what could any decent person\ndo with that? . . . He was even trying to cut THAT down, to tighten the\nband, interfering in the running of his house, so that Dona Luisa could\nnot make presents to her son. In vain he had appealed to the various\nusurers of Paris, telling them of his property beyond the ocean. These\ngentlemen had the youth of their own country in the hollow of their hand\nand were not obliged to risk their capital in other lands. The same hard\nluck pursued him when, with sudden demonstrations of affection, he had\ntried to convince Don Marcelo that three thousand francs a month was but\na niggardly trifle.\n\nThe millionaire fairly snorted with indignation. \"Three thousand francs\na trifle!\" And the debts besides, that he often had to pay for his son!\n. . .\n\n\"Why, when I was your age,\" . . . he would begin saying--but Julio would\nsuddenly bring the dialogue to a close. He had heard his father's story\ntoo many times. Ah, the stingy old miser! What he had been giving him\nall these months was no more than the interest on his grandfather's\nlegacy. . . . And by the advice of Argensola he ventured to get control\nof the field. He was planning to hand over the management of his land to\nCeledonio, the old overseer, who was now such a grandee in his country\nthat Julio ironically called him \"my uncle.\"\n\nDesnoyers accepted this rebellion coldly. \"It appears just to me. You\nare now of age!\" Then he promptly reduced to extremes his oversight\nof his home, forbidding Dona Luisa to handle any money. Henceforth he\nregarded his son as an adversary, treating him during his lightning\napparitions at the avenue Victor Hugo with glacial courtesy as though he\nwere a stranger.\n\nFor a while a transitory opulence enlivened the studio. Julio had\nincreased his expenses, considering himself rich. But the letters from\nhis uncle in America soon dissipated these illusions. At first the\nremittances exceeded very slightly the monthly allowance that his father\nhad made him. Then it began to diminish in an alarming manner. According\nto Celedonio, all the calamities on earth seemed to be falling upon his\nplantation. The pasture land was yielding scantily, sometimes for lack\nof rain, sometimes because of floods, and the herds were perishing by\nhundreds. Julio required more income, and the crafty half-breed sent him\nwhat he asked for, but simply as a loan, reserving the return until they\nshould adjust their accounts.\n\nIn spite of such aid, young Desnoyers was suffering great want. He was\ngambling now in an elegant circle, thinking thus to compensate for his\nperiodical scrimpings; but this resort was only making the remittances\nfrom America disappear with greater rapidity. . . . That such a man as\nhe was should be tormented so for the lack of a few thousand francs!\nWhat else was a millionaire father for?\n\nIf the creditors began threatening, the poor youth had to bring the\nsecretary into play, ordering him to see the mother immediately; he\nhimself wished to avoid her tears and reproaches. So Argensola would\nslip like a pickpocket up the service stairway of the great house on the\navenue Victor Hugo. The place in which he transacted his ambassadorial\nbusiness was the kitchen, with great danger that the terrible Desnoyers\nmight happen in there, on one of his perambulations as a laboring man,\nand surprise the intruder.\n\nDona Luisa would weep, touched by the heartrending tales of the\nmessenger. What could she do! She was as poor as her maids; she had\njewels, many jewels, but not a franc. Then Argensola came to the rescue\nwith a solution worthy of his experience. He would smooth the way for\nthe good mother, leaving some of her jewels at the Mont-de-Piete. He\nknew the way to raise money on them. So the lady accepted his advice,\ngiving him, however, only jewels of medium value as she suspected that\nshe might never see them again. Later scruples made her at times refuse\nflatly. Suppose Don Marcelo should ever find it out, what a scene! . . .\nBut the Spaniard deemed it unseemly to return empty-handed, and always\nbore away a basket of bottles from the well-stocked wine-cellar of the\nDesnoyers.\n\nEvery morning Dona Luisa went to Saint-Honore-d'Eylau to pray for her\nson. She felt that this was her own church. It was a hospitable and\nfamiliar island in the unexplored ocean of Paris. Here she could\nexchange discreet salutations with her neighbors from the different\nrepublics of the new world. She felt nearer to God and the saints when\nshe could hear in the vestibule conversations in her language.\n\nIt was, moreover, a sort of salon in which took place the great events\nof the South American colony. One day was a wedding with flowers,\norchestra and chanting chorals. With Chichi beside her, she greeted\nthose she knew, congratulating the bride and groom. Another day it was\nthe funeral of an ex-president of some republic, or some other foreign\ndignitary ending in Paris his turbulent existence. Poor President! Poor\nGeneral! . . .\n\nDona Luisa remembered the dead man. She had seen him many times in that\nchurch devoutly attending mass and she was indignant at the evil tongues\nwhich, under the cover of a funeral oration, recalled the shootings and\nbank failures in his country. Such a good and religious gentleman! May\nGod receive his soul in glory! . . . And upon going out into the\nsquare, she would look with tender eyes upon the young men and women on\nhorseback going to the Bois de Boulogne, the luxurious automobiles, the\nmorning radiant in the sunshine, all the primeval freshness of the early\nhours--realizing what a beautiful thing it is to live.\n\nHer devout expression of gratitude for mere existence usually included\nthe monument in the centre of the square, all bristling with wings as if\nabout to fly away from the ground. Victor Hugo! . . . It was enough\nfor her to have heard this name on the lips of her son to make her\ncontemplate the statue with a family interest. The only thing that she\nknew about the poet was that he had died. Of this she was almost sure,\nand she imagined that in life, he was a great friend of Julio's because\nshe had so often heard her son repeat his name.\n\nAy, her son! . . . All her thoughts, her conjectures, her desires,\nconverged on him and her strong-willed husband. She longed for the men\nto come to an understanding and put an end to a struggle in which she\nwas the principal victim. Would not God work this miracle? . . . Like\nan invalid who goes from one sanitarium to another in pursuit of health,\nshe gave up the church on her street to attend the Spanish chapel on the\navenue Friedland. Here she considered herself even more among her own.\n\nIn the midst of the fine and elegant South American ladies who looked\nas if they had just escaped from a fashion sheet, her eyes sought other\nwomen, not so well dressed, fat, with theatrical ermine and antique\njewelry. When these high-born dames met each other in the vestibule,\nthey spoke with heavy voices and expressive gestures, emphasizing their\nwords energetically. The daughter of the ranch ventured to salute them\nbecause she had subscribed to all their pet charities, and upon\nseeing her greeting returned, she felt a satisfaction which made her\nmomentarily forget her woes. They belonged to those families which her\nfather had so greatly admired without knowing why. They came from the\n\"mother country,\" and to the good Chicha were all Excelentisimas or\nAltisimas, related to kings. She did not know whether to give them her\nhand or bend the knee, as she had vaguely heard was the custom at court.\nBut soon she recalled her preoccupation and went forward to wrestle\nin prayer with God. Ay, that he would mercifully remember her! That he\nwould not long forget her son! . . .\n\nIt was Glory that remembered Julio, stretching out to him her arms of\nlight, so that he suddenly awoke to find himself surrounded by all the\nhonors and advantages of celebrity. Fame cunningly surprises mankind on\nthe most crooked and unexpected of roads. Neither the painting of souls\nnor a fitful existence full of extravagant love affairs and complicated\nduels had brought Desnoyers this renown. It was Glory that put him on\nhis feet.\n\nA new pleasure for the delight of humanity had come from the other side\nof the seas. People were asking one another in the mysterious tones of\nthe initiated who wish to recognize a familiar spirit, \"Do you know how\nto tango? . . .\" The tango had taken possession of the world. It was\nthe heroic hymn of a humanity that was suddenly concentrating its\naspirations on the harmonious rhythm of the thigh joints, measuring its\nintelligence by the agility of its feet. An incoherent and monotonous\nmusic of African inspiration was satisfying the artistic ideals of\na society that required nothing better. The world was dancing . . .\ndancing . . . dancing.\n\nA negro dance from Cuba introduced into South America by mariners who\nshipped jerked beef to the Antilles, conquered the entire earth in a few\nmonths, completely encircling it, bounding victoriously from nation to\nnation . . . like the Marseillaise. It was even penetrating into the\nmost ceremonious courts, overturning all traditions of conservation and\netiquette like a song of the Revolution--the revolution of frivolity.\nThe Pope even had to become a master of the dance, recommending the\n\"Furlana\" instead of the \"Tango,\" since all the Christian world,\nregardless of sects, was united in the common desire to agitate its feet\nwith the tireless frenzy of the \"possessed\" of the Middle Ages.\n\nJulio Desnoyers, upon meeting this dance of his childhood in full swing\nin Paris, devoted himself to it with the confidence that an old love\ninspires. Who could have foretold that when as a student, he was\nfrequenting the lowest dance halls in Buenos Aires, watched by the\npolice, that he was really serving an apprenticeship to Glory? . . .\n\nFrom five to seven, in the salons of the Champs d'Elysees where it cost\nfive francs for a cup of tea and the privilege of joining in the sacred\ndance, hundreds of eyes followed him with admiration. \"He has the key,\"\nsaid the women, appraising his slender elegance, medium stature, and\nmuscular springs. And he, in abbreviated jacket and expansive shirt\nbosom, with his small, girlish feet encased in high-heeled patent\nleathers with white tops, danced gravely, thoughtfully, silently, like\na mathematician working out a problem, under the lights that shed bluish\ntones upon his plastered, glossy locks. Ladies asked to be presented\nto him in the sweet hope that their friends might envy them when they\nbeheld them in the arms of the master. Invitations simply rained upon\nJulio. The most exclusive salons were thrown open to him so that every\nafternoon he made a dozen new acquaintances. The fashion had brought\nover professors from the other side of the sea, compatriots from the\nslums of Buenos Aires, haughty and confused at being applauded like\nfamous lecturers or tenors; but Julio triumphed over these vulgarians\nwho danced for money, and the incidents of his former life were\nconsidered by the women as deeds of romantic gallantry.\n\n\"You are killing yourself,\" Argensola would say. \"You are dancing too\nmuch.\"\n\nThe glory of his friend and master was only making more trouble for\nhim. His placid readings before the fire were now subject to daily\ninterruptions. It was impossible to read more than a chapter. The\ncelebrated man was continually ordering him to betake himself to the\nstreet. \"A new lesson,\" sighed the parasite. And when he was alone in\nthe studio numerous callers--all women, some inquisitive and aggressive,\nothers sad, with a deserted air--were constantly interrupting his\nthoughtful pursuits.\n\nOne of them terrified the occupants of the studio with her insistence.\nShe was a North American of uncertain age, somewhere between thirty-two\nand fifty-nine, with short skirts that whenever she sat down, seemed\nto fly up as if moved by a spring. Various dances with Desnoyers and\na visit to the rue de la Pompe she seemed to consider as her sacred\nrights, and she pursued the master with the desperation of an abandoned\nzealot. Julio had made good his escape upon learning that this beauty\nof youthful elegance--when seen from the back--had two grandchildren.\n\"MASTER Desnoyers has gone out,\" Argensola would invariably say upon\nreceiving her. And, thereupon she would burst into tears and threats,\nlonging to kill herself then and there that her corpse might frighten\naway those other women who would come to rob her of what she considered\nher special privilege. Now it was Argensola who sped his companion to\nthe street when he wished to be alone. He had only to remark casually,\n\"I believe that Yankee is coming,\" and the great man would beat a hasty\nretreat, oftentimes in his desperate flight availing himself of the back\nstairs.\n\nAt this time began to develop the most important event in Julio's\nexistence. The Desnoyers family was to be united with that of Senator\nLacour. Rene, his only son, had succeeded in awakening in Chichi a\ncertain interest that was almost love. The dignitary enjoyed thinking\nof his son allied to the boundless plains and immense herds whose\ndescription always affected him like a marvellous tale. He was a\nwidower, but he enjoyed giving at his home famous banquets and parties.\nEvery new celebrity immediately suggested to him the idea of giving a\ndinner. No illustrious person passing through Paris, polar explorer\nor famous singer, could escape being exhibited in the dining room\nof Lacour. The son of Desnoyers--at whom he had scarcely glanced\nbefore--now inspired him with sudden interest. The senator was a\nthoroughly up-to-date man who did not classify glory nor distinguish\nreputations. It was enough for him that a name should be on everybody's\nlips for him to accept it with enthusiasm. When Julio responded to his\ninvitation, he presented him with pride to his friends, and came very\nnear to calling him \"dear master.\" The tango was monopolizing all\nconversation nowadays. Even in the Academy they were taking it up in\norder to demonstrate that the youth of ancient Athens had diverted\nitself in a somewhat similar way. . . . And Lacour had dreamed all his\nlife of an Athenian republic.\n\nAt these reunions, Desnoyers became acquainted with the Lauriers. He was\nan engineer who owned a motor-factory for automobiles in the outskirts\nof Paris--a man about thirty-five, tall, rather heavy and silent, with\na deliberate air as though he wished to see deeply into men and\nthings. She was of a light, frivolous character, loving life for the\nsatisfactions and pleasures which it brought her, appearing to accept\nwith smiling conformity the silent and grave adoration of her husband.\nShe could not well do less with a man of his merits. Besides, she had\nbrought to the marriage a dowry of three hundred thousand francs, a\ncapital which had enabled the engineer to enlarge his business. The\nsenator had been instrumental in arranging this marriage. He was\ninterested in Laurier because he was the son of an old friend.\n\nUpon Marguerite Laurier the presence of Julio flashed like a ray of\nsunlight in the tiresome salon of Lacour. She was dancing the fad of the\nhour and frequenting the tango teas where reigned the adored Desnoyers.\nAnd to think that she was being entertained with this celebrated and\ninteresting man that the other women were raving about! . . . In order\nthat he might not take her for a mere middle-class woman like the other\nguests at the senator's party, she spoke of her modistes, all from the\nrue de la Paix, declaring gravely that no woman who had any self-respect\ncould possibly walk through the streets wearing a gown costing less than\neight hundred francs, and that the hat of a thousand francs--but a few\nyears ago, an astonishing novelty--was nowadays a very ordinary affair.\n\nThis acquaintanceship made the \"little Laurier,\" as her friends called\nher notwithstanding her tallness, much sought by the master of the\ndance, in spite of the looks of wrath and envy hurled at her by the\nothers. What a triumph for the wife of a simple engineer who was used\nto going everywhere in her mother's automobile! . . . Julio at first\nhad supposed her like all the others who were languishing in his arms,\nfollowing the rhythmic complications of the dance, but he soon found\nthat she was very different. Her coquetry after the first confidential\nwords, but increased his admiration. He really had never before been\nthrown with a woman of her class. Those of his first social period were\nthe habituees of the night restaurants paid for their witchery. Now\nGlory was tossing into his arms ladies of high position but with an\nunconfessable past, anxious for novelties although exceedingly mature.\nThis middle class woman who would advance so confidently toward him and\nthen retreat with such capricious outbursts of modesty, was a new type\nfor him.\n\nThe tango salons soon began to suffer a great loss. Desnoyers was\npermitting himself to be seen there with less frequency, handing Glory\nover to the professionals. Sometimes entire weeks slipped by without the\nfive-to-seven devotees being able to admire his black locks and his tiny\npatent leathers twinkling under the lights in time with his graceful\nmovements.\n\nMarguerite was also avoiding these places. The meetings of the two were\ntaking place in accordance with what she had read in the love stories\nof Paris. She was going in search of Julio, fearing to be recognized,\ntremulous with emotion, selecting her most inconspicuous suit, and\ncovering her face with a close veil--\"the veil of adultery,\" as her\nfriends called it. They had their trysts in the least-frequented squares\nof the district, frequently changing the places, like timid birds\nthat at the slightest disturbance fly to perch a little further away.\nSometimes they would meet in the Buttes Chaumont, at others they\npreferred the gardens on the left bank of the Seine, the Luxembourg, and\neven the distant Parc de Montsouris. She was always in tremors of terror\nlest her husband might surprise them, although she well knew that the\nindustrious engineer was in his factory a great distance away. Her\nagitated aspect, her excessive precautions in order to slip by unseen,\nonly served to attract the attention of the passers-by. Although Julio\nwas waxing impatient with the annoyance of this wandering love affair\nwhich only amounted to a few fugitive kisses, he finally held his peace,\ndominated by Marguerite's pleadings.\n\nShe did not wish merely to be one in the procession of his sweethearts;\nit was necessary to convince herself first that this love was going to\nlast forever. It was her first slip and she wanted it to be the last.\nAy, her former spotless reputation! . . . What would people say! . . .\nThe two returned to their adolescent period, loving each other as they\nhad never loved before, with the confident and childish passion of\nfifteen-year-olds.\n\nJulio had leaped from childhood to libertinism, taking his initiation\ninto life at a single bound. She had desired marriage in order to\nacquire the respect and liberty of a married woman, but feeling towards\nher husband only a vague gratitude. \"We end where others begin,\" she had\nsaid to Desnoyers.\n\nTheir passion took the form of an intense, reciprocal and vulgar love.\nThey felt a romantic sentimentality in clasping hands or exchanging\nkisses on a garden bench in the twilight. He was treasuring a ringlet\nof Marguerite's--although he doubted its genuineness, with a vague\nsuspicion that it might be one of the latest wisps of fashion. She\nwould cuddle down with her head on his shoulder, as though imploring\nhis protection, although always in the open air. If Julio ever attempted\ngreater intimacy in a carriage, madame would repel him most vigorously.\nA contradictory duality appeared to inspire her actions. Every morning,\non awaking, she would decide to yield, but then when near him, her\nmiddle-class respectability, jealous of its reputation, kept her\nfaithful to her mother's teachings.\n\nOne day she agreed to visit his studio with the interest that the\nhaunts of the loved one always inspires. \"Promise that you will not take\nadvantage of me.\" He readily promised, swearing that everything should\nbe as Marguerite wished. . . . But from that day they were no longer\nseen in the gardens, nor wandering around persecuted by the winter\nwinds. They preferred the studio, and Argensola had to rearrange his\nexistence, seeking the stove of another artist friend, in order to\ncontinue his reading.\n\nThis state of things lasted two months. They never knew what secret\nforce suddenly disturbed their tranquility. Perhaps one of her friends,\nguessing at the truth, had told the husband anonymously. Perhaps it was\nshe herself unconsciously, with her inexpressible happiness, her tardy\nreturns home when dinner was already served, and the sudden aversion\nwhich she showed toward the engineer in their hours alone, trying to\nkeep her heart faithful to her lover. To divide her interest between her\nlegal companion and the man she loved was a torment that her simple and\nvehement enthusiasm could not tolerate.\n\nWhile she was hurrying one night through the rue de la Pompe, looking at\nher watch and trembling with impatience at not finding an automobile\nor even a cab, a man stood in front of her. . . . Etienne Laurier! She\nalways shuddered with fear on recalling that hour. For a moment\nshe believed that he was going to kill her. Serious men, quiet and\ndiffident, are most terrible in their explosions of wrath. Her husband\nknew everything. With the same patience that he employed in solving his\nindustrial problems, he had been studying her day by day, without her\never suspecting the watchfulness behind that impassive countenance. Then\nhe had followed her in order to complete the evidence of his misfortune.\n\nMarguerite had never supposed that he could be so common and noisy in\nhis anger. She had expected that he would accept the facts coldly with\nthat slight tinge of philosophical irony usually shown by distinguished\nmen, as the husbands of her friends had done. But the poor engineer\nwho, outside of his work, saw only his wife, loving her as a woman,\nand adoring her as a dainty and superior being, a model of grace and\nelegance, could not endure the thought of her downfall, and cried and\nthreatened without reserve, so that the scandal became known throughout\ntheir entire circle of friends. The senator felt greatly annoyed in\nremembering that it was in his exclusive home that the guilty ones had\nbecome acquainted; but his displeasure was visited upon the husband.\nWhat lack of good taste! . . . Women will be women, and everything\nis capable of adjustment. But before the imprudent outbursts of this\nfrantic devil no elegant solution was possible, and there was now\nnothing to do but to begin divorce proceedings.\n\nDesnoyers, senior, was very indignant upon learning of this last\nescapade of his son. He had always had a great liking for Laurier.\nThat instinctive bond which exists between men of industry, patient and\nsilent, had made them very congenial. At the senator's receptions he\nhad always talked with the engineer about the progress of his business,\ninteresting himself in the development of that factory of which he\nalways spoke with the affection of a father. The millionaire, in\nspite of his reputation for miserliness, had even volunteered his\ndisinterested support if at any time it should become necessary to\nenlarge the plant. And it was this good man's happiness that his son, a\nfrivolous and useless dancer, was going to steal! . . .\n\nAt first Laurier spoke of a duel. His wrath was that of a work horse who\nbreaks the tight reins of his laboring outfit, tosses his mane, neighs\nwildly and bites. The father was greatly distressed at the possibility\nof such an outcome. . . . One scandal more! Julio had dedicated the\ngreater part of his existence to the handling of arms.\n\n\"He will kill the poor man!\" he said to the senator. \"I am sure that he\nwill kill him. It is the logic of life; the good-for-nothing always kill\nthose who amount to anything.\"\n\nBut there was no killing. The Father of the Republic knew how to handle\nthe clashing parties, with the same skill that he always employed in\nthe corridors of the Senate during a ministerial crisis. The scandal was\nhushed up. Marguerite went to live with her mother and took the first\nsteps for a divorce.\n\nSome evenings, when the studio clock was striking seven, she would yawn\nand say sadly: \"I must go. . . . I have to go, although this is my true\nhome. . . . Ah, what a pity that we are not married!\"\n\nAnd he, feeling a whole garden of bourgeois virtues, hitherto ignored,\nbursting into bloom, repeated in a tone of conviction:\n\n\"That's so; why are we not married!\"\n\nTheir wishes could be realized. The husband was facilitating the step\nby his unexpected intervention. So young Desnoyers set forth for South\nAmerica in order to raise the money and marry Marguerite.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE COUSIN FROM BERLIN\n\n\nThe studio of Julio Desnoyers was on the top floor, both the stairway\nand the elevator stopping before his door. The two tiny apartments\nat the back were lighted by an interior court, their only means of\ncommunication being the service stairway which went on up to the\ngarrets.\n\nWhile his comrade was away, Argensola had made the acquaintance of those\nin the neighboring lodgings. The largest of the apartments was empty\nduring the day, its occupants not returning till after they had taken\ntheir evening meal in a restaurant. As both husband and wife were\nemployed outside, they could not remain at home except on holidays.\nThe man, vigorous and of a martial aspect, was superintendent in a big\ndepartment store. . . . He had been a soldier in Africa, wore a military\ndecoration, and had the rank of sub-lieutenant in the Reserves. She was\na blonde, heavy and rather anaemic, with bright eyes and a sentimental\nexpression. On holidays she spent long hours at the piano, playing\nmusical reveries, always the same. At other times Argensola saw\nher through the interior window working in the kitchen aided by her\ncompanion, the two laughing over their clumsiness and inexperience in\npreparing the Sunday dinner.\n\nThe concierge thought that this woman was a German, but she herself said\nthat she was Swiss. She was a cashier in a shop--not the one in which\nher husband was employed. In the mornings they left home together,\nseparating in the Place d'Etoile. At seven in the evening they met here,\ngreeting each other with a kiss, like lovers who meet for the first\ntime; and then after supper, they returned to their nest in the rue de\nla Pompe. All Argensola's attempts at friendliness with these neighbors\nwere repulsed because of their self-centredness. They responded with\nfreezing courtesy; they lived only for themselves.\n\nThe other apartment of two rooms was occupied by a single man. He was a\nRussian or Pole who almost always returned with a package of books, and\npassed many hours writing near the patio window. From the very first the\nSpaniard took him to be a mysterious man, probably a very distinguished\none--a true hero of a novel. The foreign appearance of this Tchernoff\nmade a great impression upon him--his dishevelled beard, and oily\nlocks, his spectacles upon a large nose that seemed deformed by a\ndagger-thrust. There emanated from him, like an invisible nimbus, an\nodor of cheap wine and soiled clothing.\n\nWhen Argensola caught a glimpse of him through the service door he would\nsay to himself, \"Ah, Friend Tchernoff is returning,\" and thereupon\nhe would saunter out to the stairway in order to have a chat with his\nneighbor. For a long time the stranger discouraged all approach to his\nquarters, which fact led the Spaniard to infer that he devoted himself\nto alchemy and kindred mysteries. When he finally was allowed to enter\nhe saw only books, many books, books everywhere--scattered on the floor,\nheaped upon benches, piled in corners, overflowing on to broken-down\nchairs, old tables, and a bed that was only made up now and then when\nthe owner, alarmed by the increasing invasion of dust and cobwebs, was\nobliged to call in the aid of his friend, the concierge.\n\nArgensola finally realized, not without a certain disenchantment, that\nthere was nothing mysterious in the life of the man. What he was writing\nnear the window were merely translations, some of them ordered, others\nvolunteer work for the socialist periodicals. The only marvellous thing\nabout him was the quantity of languages that he knew.\n\n\"He knows them all,\" said the Spaniard, when describing their neighbor\nto Desnoyers. \"He has only to hear of a new one to master it. He\nholds the key, the secret of all languages, living or dead. He\nspeaks Castilian as well as we do, and yet he has never been in a\nSpanish-speaking country.\"\n\nArgensola again felt a thrill of mystery upon reading the titles of many\nof the volumes. The majority were old books, many of them in languages\nthat he was not able to decipher, picked up for a song at second-hand\nshops or on the book stands installed upon the parapets of the Seine.\nOnly a man holding the key of tongues could get together such volumes.\nAn atmosphere of mysticism, of superhuman insight, of secrets intact\nfor many centuries appeared to emanate from these heaps of dusty volumes\nwith worm-eaten leaves. And mixed with these ancient tomes were others\nred and conspicuous, pamphlets of socialistic propaganda, leaflets in\nall the languages of Europe and periodicals--many periodicals, with\nrevolutionary titles.\n\nTchernoff did not appear to enjoy visits and conversation. He would\nsmile enigmatically into his black beard, and was very sparing with his\nwords so as to shorten the interview. But Argensola possessed the means\nof winning over this sullen personage. It was only necessary for him\nto wink one eye with the expressive invitation, \"Do we go?\" and the two\nwould soon be settled on a bench in the kitchen of Desnoyers' studio,\nopposite a bottle which had come from the avenue Victor Hugo. The costly\nwines of Don Marcelo made the Russian more communicative, although, in\nspite of this aid, the Spaniard learned little of his neighbor's real\nexistence. Sometimes he would mention Jaures and other socialistic\norators. His surest means of existence was the translation of\nperiodicals or party papers. On various occasions the name of Siberia\nescaped from his lips, and he admitted that he had been there a long\ntime; but he did not care to talk about a country visited against his\nwill. He would merely smile modestly, showing plainly that he did not\nwish to make any further revelations.\n\nThe morning after the return of Julio Desnoyers, while Argensola was\ntalking on the stairway with Tchernoff, the bell rang. How annoying! The\nRussian, who was well up in advanced politics, was just explaining the\nplans advanced by Jaures. There were still many who hoped that war might\nbe averted. He had his motives for doubting it. . . . He, Tchernoff, was\ncommenting on these illusions with the smile of a flat-nosed sphinx when\nthe bell rang for a second time, so that Argensola was obliged to break\naway from his interesting friend, and run to open the main door.\n\nA gentleman wished to see Julio. He spoke very correct French, though\nhis accent was a revelation for Argensola. Upon going into the bedroom\nin search of his master, who was just arising, he said confidently,\n\"It's the cousin from Berlin who has come to say good-bye. It could not\nbe anyone else.\"\n\nWhen the three came together in the studio, Desnoyers presented his\ncomrade, in order that the visitor might not make any mistake in regard\nto his social status.\n\n\"I have heard him spoken of. The gentleman is Argensola, a very\ndeserving youth.\"\n\nDoctor Julius von Hartrott said this with the self-sufficiency of a\nman who knows everything and wishes to be agreeable to an inferior,\nconceding him the alms of his attention.\n\nThe two cousins confronted each other with a curiosity not altogether\nfree from distrust. Although closely related, they knew each other very\nslightly, tacitly admitting complete divergence in opinions and tastes.\n\nAfter slowly examining the Sage, Argensola came to the conclusion that\nhe looked like an officer dressed as a civilian. He noticed in his\nperson an effort to imitate the soldierly when occasionally discarding\nuniform--the ambition of every German burgher wishing to be taken for\nthe superior class. His trousers were narrow, as though intended to be\ntucked into cavalry boots. His coat with two rows of buttons had the\ncontracted waist with very full skirt and upstanding lapels, suggesting\nvaguely a military great coat. The reddish moustachios, strong jaw and\nshaved head completed his would-be martial appearance; but his eyes,\nlarge, dark-circled and near-sighted, were the eyes of a student taking\nrefuge behind great thick glasses which gave him the aspect of a man of\npeace.\n\nDesnoyers knew that he was an assistant professor of the University,\nthat he had published a few volumes, fat and heavy as bricks, and that\nhe was a member of an academic society collaborating in documentary\nresearch directed by a famous historian. In his lapel he was wearing the\nbadge of a foreign order.\n\nJulio's respect for the learned member of the family was not unmixed\nwith contempt. He and his sister Chichi had from childhood felt an\ninstinctive hostility toward the cousins from Berlin. It annoyed him,\ntoo, to have his family everlastingly holding up as a model this\npedant who only knew life as it is in books, and passed his existence\ninvestigating what men had done in other epochs, in order to draw\nconclusions in harmony with Germany's views. While young Desnoyers\nhad great facility for admiration, and reverenced all those whose\n\"arguments\" Argensola had doled out to him, he drew the line at\naccepting the intellectual grandeur of this illustrious relative.\n\nDuring his stay in Berlin, a German word of vulgar invention had enabled\nhim to classify this prig. Heavy books of minute investigation were\nevery month being published by the dozens in the Fatherland. There was\nnot a professor who could resist the temptation of constructing from the\nsimplest detail an enormous volume written in a dull, involved style.\nThe people, therefore, appreciating that these near-sighted authors were\nincapable of any genial vision of comradeship, called them Sitzfleisch\nhaben, because of the very long sittings which their works represented.\nThat was what this cousin was for him, a mere Sitzfleisch haben.\n\nDoctor von Hartrott, on explaining his visit, spoke in Spanish.\nHe availed himself of this language used by the family during his\nchildhood, as a precaution, looking around repeatedly as if he feared\nto be heard. He had come to bid his cousin farewell. His mother had told\nhim of his return, and he had not wished to leave Paris without seeing\nhim. He was leaving in a few hours, since matters were growing more\nstrained.\n\n\"But do you really believe that there will be war?\" asked Desnoyers.\n\n\"War will be declared to-morrow or the day after. Nothing can prevent it\nnow. It is necessary for the welfare of humanity.\"\n\nSilence followed this speech, Julio and Argensola looking with\nastonishment at this peaceable-looking man who had just spoken with such\nmartial arrogance. The two suspected that the professor was making this\nvisit in order to give vent to his opinions and enthusiasms. At the same\ntime, perhaps, he was trying to find out what they might think and know,\nas one of the many viewpoints of the people in Paris.\n\n\"You are not French,\" he added looking at his cousin. \"You were born in\nArgentina, so before you I may speak the truth.\"\n\n\"And were you not born there?\" asked Julio smiling.\n\nThe Doctor made a gesture of protest, as though he had just heard\nsomething insulting. \"No, I am a German. No matter where a German may\nbe born, he always belongs to his mother country.\" Then turning to\nArgensola--\"This gentleman, too, is a foreigner. He comes from noble\nSpain, which owes to us the best that it has--the worship of honor, the\nknightly spirit.\"\n\nThe Spaniard wished to remonstrate, but the Sage would not permit,\nadding in an oracular tone:\n\n\"You were miserable Celts, sunk in the vileness of an inferior and\nmongrel race whose domination by Rome but made your situation worse.\nFortunately you were conquered by the Goths and others of our race who\nimplanted in you a sense of personal dignity. Do not forget, young man,\nthat the Vandals were the ancestors of the Prussians of to-day.\"\n\nAgain Argensola tried to speak, but his friend signed to him not to\ninterrupt the professor who appeared to have forgotten his former\nreserve and was working up to an enthusiastic pitch with his own words.\n\n\"We are going to witness great events,\" he continued. \"Fortunate are\nthose born in this epoch, the most interesting in history! At this\nvery moment, humanity is changing its course. Now the true civilization\nbegins.\"\n\nThe war, according to him, was going to be of a brevity hitherto unseen.\nGermany had been preparing herself to bring about this event without\nany long, economic world-disturbance. A single month would be enough\nto crush France, the most to be feared of their adversaries. Then they\nwould march against Russia, who with her slow, clumsy movements could\nnot oppose an immediate defense. Finally they would attack haughty\nEngland, so isolated in its archipelago that it could not obstruct the\nsweep of German progress. This would make a series of rapid blows and\noverwhelming victories, requiring only a summer in which to play this\nmagnificent role. The fall of the leaves in the following autumn would\ngreet the definite triumph of Germany.\n\nWith the assurance of a professor who does not expect his dictum to be\nrefuted by his hearers, he explained the superiority of the German\nrace. All mankind was divided into two groups--dolicephalous and the\nbrachicephalous, according to the shape of the skull. Another scientific\nclassification divided men into the light-haired and dark-haired. The\ndolicephalous (arched heads) represented purity of race and superior\nmentality. The brachicephalous (flat heads) were mongrels with all the\nstigma of degeneration. The German, dolicephalous par excellence, was\nthe only descendant of the primitive Aryans. All the other nations,\nespecially those of the south of Europe called \"latins,\" belonged to a\ndegenerate humanity.\n\nThe Spaniard could not contain himself any longer. \"But no person with\nany intelligence believes any more in those antique theories of race!\nWhat if there no longer existed a people of absolutely pure blood, owing\nto thousands of admixtures due to historical conquests!\" . . . Many\nGermans bore the identical ethnic marks which the professor was\nattributing to the inferior races.\n\n\"There is something in that,\" admitted Hartrott, \"but although the\nGerman race may not be perfectly pure, it is the least impure of all\nraces and, therefore, should have dominion over the world.\"\n\nHis voice took on an ironic and cutting edge when speaking of the Celts,\ninhabitants of the lands of the South. They had retarded the progress\nof Humanity, deflecting it in the wrong direction. The Celt is\nindividualistic and consequently an ungovernable revolutionary who tends\nto socialism. Furthermore, he is a humanitarian and makes a virtue\nof mercy, defending the existence of the weak who do not amount to\nanything.\n\nThe illustrious German places above everything else, Method and Power.\nElected by Nature to command the impotent races, he possesses all\nthe qualifications that distinguish the superior leader. The French\nRevolution was merely a clash between Teutons and Celts. The nobility of\nFrance were descended from Germanic warriors established in the country\nafter the so-called invasion of the barbarians. The middle and lower\nclasses were the Gallic-Celtic element. The inferior race had conquered\nthe superior, disorganizing the country and perturbing the world.\nCeltism was the inventor of Democracy, of the doctrines of Socialism and\nAnarchy. Now the hour of Germanic retaliation was about to strike, and\nthe Northern race would re-establish order, since God had favored it by\ndemonstrating its indisputable superiority.\n\n\"A nation,\" he added, \"can aspire to great destinies only when it is\nfundamentally Teutonic. The less German it is, the less its civilization\namounts to. We represent 'the aristocracy of humanity,' 'the salt of the\nearth,' as our William said.\"\n\nArgensola was listening with astonishment to this outpouring of conceit.\nAll the great nations had passed through the fever of Imperialism. The\nGreeks aspired to world-rule because they were the most civilized and\nbelieved themselves the most fit to give civilization to the rest of\nmankind. The Romans, upon conquering countries, implanted law and the\nrule of justice. The French of the Revolution and the Empire justified\ntheir invasions on the plea that they wished to liberate mankind and\nspread abroad new ideas. Even the Spaniards of the sixteenth century,\nwhen battling with half of Europe for religious unity and the\nextermination of heresy, were working toward their ideals obscure and\nperhaps erroneous, but disinterested.\n\nAll the nations of history had been struggling for something which they\nhad considered generous and above their own interests. Germany alone,\naccording to this professor, was trying to impose itself upon the\nworld in the name of racial superiority--a superiority that nobody had\nrecognized, that she was arrogating to herself, coating her affirmations\nwith a varnish of false science.\n\n\"Until now wars have been carried on by the soldiery,\" continued\nHartrott. \"That which is now going to begin will be waged by a\ncombination of soldiers and professors. In its preparation the\nUniversity has taken as much part as the military staff. German\nscience, leader of all sciences, is united forever with what the Latin\nrevolutionists disdainfully term militarism. Force, mistress of the\nworld, is what creates right, that which our truly unique civilization\nimposes. Our armies are the representatives of our culture, and in a\nfew weeks we shall free the world from its decadence, completely\nrejuvenating it.\"\n\nThe vision of the immense future of his race was leading him on to\nexpose himself with lyrical enthusiasm. William I, Bismarck, all the\nheroes of past victories, inspired his veneration, but he spoke of them\nas dying gods whose hour had passed. They were glorious ancestors of\nmodest pretensions who had confined their activities to enlarging the\nfrontiers, and to establishing the unity of the Empire, afterwards\nopposing themselves with the prudence of valetudinarians to the\ndaring of the new generation. Their ambitions went no further than a\ncontinental hegemony . . . but now William II had leaped into the arena,\nthe complex hero that the country required.\n\n\"Lamprecht, my master, has pictured his greatness. It is tradition and\nthe future, method and audacity. Like his grandfather, the Emperor holds\nthe conviction of what monarchy by the grace of God represents, but his\nvivid and modern intelligence recognizes and accepts modern conditions.\nAt the same time that he is romantic, feudal and a supporter of the\nagrarian conservatives, he is also an up-to-date man who seeks practical\nsolutions and shows a utilitarian spirit. In him are correctly balanced\ninstinct and reason.\"\n\nGermany, guided by this hero, had, according to Hartrott, been\nconcentrating its strength, and recognizing its true path. The\nUniversities supported him even more unanimously than the army. Why\nstore up so much power and maintain it without employment? . . . The\nempire of the world belongs to the German people. The historians and\nphilosophers, disciples of Treitschke, were taking it upon themselves\nto frame the rights that would justify this universal domination. And\nLamprecht, the psychological historian, like the other professors, was\nlaunching the belief in the absolute superiority of the Germanic race.\nIt was just that it should rule the world, since it only had the power\nto do so. This \"telurian germanization\" was to be of immense benefit\nto mankind. The earth was going to be happy under the dictatorship of a\npeople born for mastery. The German state, \"tentacular potency,\" would\neclipse with its glory the most imposing empire of the past and present.\nGott mit uns!\n\n\"Who will be able to deny, as my master says, that there exists a\nChristian, German God, the 'Great Ally,' who is showing himself to our\nenemies, the foreigners, as a strong and jealous divinity?\" . . .\n\nDesnoyers was listening to his cousin with astonishment and at the same\ntime looking at Argensola who, with a flutter of his eyes, seemed to be\nsaying to him, \"He is mad! These Germans are simply mad with pride.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the professor, unable to curb his enthusiasm, continued\nexpounding the grandeur of his race. From his viewpoint, the\nprovidential Kaiser had shown inexplicable weakenings. He was too good\nand too kind. \"Deliciae generis humani,\" as had said Professor Lasson,\nanother of Hartrott's masters. Able to overthrow everything with\nhis annihilating power, the Emperor was limiting himself merely to\nmaintaining peace. But the nation did not wish to stop there, and was\npushing its leader until it had him started. It was useless now to put\non the brakes. \"He who does not advance recedes\";--that was the cry of\nPanGermanism to the Emperor. He must press on in order to conquer the\nentire world.\n\n\"And now war comes,\" continued the pedant. \"We need the colonies of the\nothers, even though Bismarck, through an error of his stubborn old age,\nexacted nothing at the time of universal distribution, letting England\nand France get possession of the best lands. We must control all\ncountries that have Germanic blood and have been civilized by our\nforbears.\"\n\nHartrott enumerated these countries. Holland and Belgium were German.\nFrance, through the Franks, was one-third Teutonic blood. Italy. . . .\nHere the professor hesitated, recalling the fact that this nation\nwas still an ally, certainly a little insecure, but still united by\ndiplomatic bonds. He mentioned, nevertheless, the Longobards and other\nraces coming from the North. Spain and Portugal had been populated by\nthe ruddy Goth and also belonged to the dominant race. And since the\nmajority of the nations of America were of Spanish and Portuguese\norigin, they should also be included in this recovery.\n\n\"It is a little premature to think of these last nations just yet,\"\nadded the Doctor modestly, \"but some day the hour of justice will sound.\nAfter our continental triumph, we shall have time to think of their\nfate. . . . North America also should receive our civilizing influence,\nfor there are living millions of Germans who have created its\ngreatness.\"\n\nHe was talking of the future conquests as though they were marks of\ndistinction with which his country was going to favor other countries.\nThese were to continue living politically the same as before with\ntheir individual governments, but subject to the Teutons, like minors\nrequiring the strong hand of a master. They would form the Universal\nUnited States, with an hereditary and all-powerful president--the\nEmperor of Germany--receiving all the benefits of Germanic culture,\nworking disciplined under his industrial direction. . . . But the world\nis ungrateful, and human badness always opposes itself to progress.\n\n\"We have no illusions,\" sighed the professor, with lofty sadness. \"We\nhave no friends. All look upon us with jealousy, as dangerous beings,\nbecause we are the most intelligent, the most active, and have proved\nourselves superior to all others. . . . But since they no longer love\nus, let them fear us! As my friend Mann says, although Kultur is the\nspiritual organization of the world, it does not exclude bloody savagery\nwhen that becomes necessary. Kultur sanctifies the demon within us, and\nis above morality, reason and science. We are going to impose Kultur by\nforce of the cannon.\"\n\nArgensola continued, saying with his eyes, \"They are crazy, crazy with\npride! . . . What can the world expect of such people!\"\n\nDesnoyers here intervened in order to brighten this gloomy monologue\nwith a little optimism. War had not yet been positively declared. The\ndiplomats were still trying to arrange matters. Perhaps it might all\nturn out peaceably at the last minute, as had so often happened before.\nHis cousin was seeing things entirely distorted by an aggressive\nenthusiasm.\n\nOh, the ironical, ferocious and cutting smile of the Doctor! Argensola\nhad never known old Madariaga, but it, nevertheless, occurred to him\nthat in this fashion sharks must smile, although he, too, had never seen\na shark.\n\n\"It is war,\" boomed Hartrott. \"When I left Germany, fifteen days ago, I\nknew that war was inevitable.\"\n\nThe certainty with which he said this dissipated all Julio's hope.\nMoreover, this man's trip, on the pretext of seeing his mother,\ndisquieted him. . . . On what mission had Doctor Julius von Hartrott\ncome to Paris? . . .\n\n\"Well, then,\" asked Desnoyers, \"why so many diplomatic interviews? Why\ndoes the German government intervene at all--although in such a lukewarm\nway--in the struggle between Austria and Servia. . . . Would it not be\nbetter to declare war right out?\"\n\nThe professor replied with simplicity: \"Our government undoubtedly\nwishes that the others should declare the war. The role of outraged\ndignity is always the most pleasing one and justifies all ulterior\nresolutions, however extreme they may seem. There are some of our people\nwho are living comfortably and do not desire war. It is expedient to\nmake them believe that those who impose it upon us are our enemies so\nthat they may feel the necessity of defending themselves. Only superior\nminds reach the conviction of the great advancement that can be\naccomplished by the sword alone, and that war, as our grand Treitschke\nsays, is the highest form of progress.\"\n\nAgain he smiled with a ferocious expression. Morality, from his point of\nview, should exist among individuals only to make them more obedient\nand disciplined, for morality per se impedes governments and should be\nsuppressed as a useless obstacle. For the State there exists neither\ntruth nor falsehood; it only recognizes the utility of things. The\nglorious Bismarck, in order to consummate the war with France, the base\nof German grandeur, had not hesitated to falsify a telegraphic despatch.\n\n\"And remember, that he is the most glorious hero of our time! History\nlooks leniently upon his heroic feat. Who would accuse the one who\ntriumphs? . . . Professor Hans Delbruck has written with reason,\n'Blessed be the hand that falsified the telegram of Ems!'\"\n\nIt was convenient to have the war break out immediately, in order that\nevents might result favorably for Germany, whose enemies are totally\nunprepared. Preventive war was recommended by General Bernhardi and\nother illustrious patriots. It would be dangerous indeed to defer the\ndeclaration of war until the enemies had fortified themselves so that\nthey should be the ones to make war. Besides, to the Germans what kind\nof deterrents could law and other fictions invented by weak nations\npossibly be? . . . No; they had the Power, and Power creates new laws.\nIf they proved to be the victors, History would not investigate too\nclosely the means by which they had conquered. It was Germany that was\ngoing to win, and the priests of all cults would finally sanctify with\ntheir chants the blessed war--if it led to triumph.\n\n\"We are not making war in order to punish the Servian regicides, nor to\nfree the Poles, nor the others oppressed by Russia, stopping there in\nadmiration of our disinterested magnanimity. We wish to wage it because\nwe are the first people of the earth and should extend our activity over\nthe entire planet. Germany's hour has sounded. We are going to take\nour place as the powerful Mistress of the World, the place which Spain\noccupied in former centuries, afterwards France, and England to-day.\nWhat those people accomplished in a struggle of many years we are going\nto bring about in four months. The storm-flag of the Empire is now going\nto wave over nations and oceans; the sun is going to shine on a great\nslaughter. . . .\n\n\"Old Rome, sick unto death, called 'barbarians' the Germans who opened\nthe grave. The world to-day also smells death and will surely call us\nbarbarians. . . . So be it! When Tangiers and Toulouse, Amberes and\nCalais have become submissive to German barbarism . . . then we will\nspeak further of this matter. We have the power, and who has that\nneeds neither to hesitate nor to argue. . . . Power! . . . That is the\nbeautiful word--the only word that rings true and clear. . . . Power!\nOne sure stab and all argument is answered forever!\"\n\n\"But are you so sure of victory?\" asked Desnoyers. \"Sometimes Destiny\ngives us great surprises. There are hidden forces that we must take into\nconsideration or they may overturn the best-laid plans.\"\n\nThe smile of the Doctor became increasingly scornful and arrogant.\nEverything had been foreseen and studied out long ago with the most\nminute Germanic method. What had they to fear? . . . The enemy most to\nbe reckoned with was France, incapable of resisting the enervating moral\ninfluences, the sufferings, the strain and the privations of war;--a\nnation physically debilitated and so poisoned by revolutionary spirit\nthat it had laid aside the use of arms through an exaggerated love of\ncomfort.\n\n\"Our generals,\" he announced, \"are going to leave her in such a state\nthat she will never again cross our path.\"\n\nThere was Russia, too, to consider, but her amorphous masses were slow\nto assemble and unwieldy to move. The Executive Staff of Berlin had\ntimed everything by measure for crushing France in four weeks, and would\nthen lead its enormous forces against the Russian empire before it could\nbegin action.\n\n\"We shall finish with the bear after killing the cock,\" affirmed the\nprofessor triumphantly.\n\nBut guessing at some objection from his cousin, he hastened on--\"I know\nwhat you are going to tell me. There remains another enemy, one that has\nnot yet leaped into the lists but which all the Germans are waiting for.\nThat one inspires more hatred than all the others put together, because\nit is of our blood, because it is a traitor to the race. . . . Ah, how\nwe loathe it!\"\n\nAnd in the tone in which these words were uttered throbbed an expression\nof hatred and a thirst for vengeance which astonished both listeners.\n\n\"Even though England attack us,\" continued Hartrott, \"we shall conquer,\nnotwithstanding. This adversary is not more terrible than the others.\nFor the past century she has ruled the world. Upon the fall of Napoleon\nshe seized the continental hegemony, and will fight to keep it. But\nwhat does her energy amount to? . . . As our Bernhardi says, the English\npeople are merely a nation of renters and sportsmen. Their army is\nformed from the dregs of the nation. The country lacks military spirit.\nWe are a people of warriors, and it will be an easy thing for us to\nconquer the English, debilitated by a false conception of life.\"\n\nThe Doctor paused and then added: \"We are counting on the internal\ncorruption of our enemies, on their lack of unity. God will aid us by\nsowing confusion among these detested people. In a few days you will see\nHis hand. Revolution is going to break out in France at the same time\nas war. The people of Paris will build barricades in the streets and\nthe scenes of the Commune will repeat themselves. Tunis, Algiers and all\ntheir other possessions are about to rise against the metropolis.\"\n\nArgensola seized the opportunity to smile with an aggressive\nincredulity.\n\n\"I repeat it,\" insisted Hartrott, \"that this country is going to have\ninternal revolution and colonial insurrection. I know perfectly\nwell what I am talking about. . . . Russia also will break out into\nrevolution with a red flag that will force the Czar to beg for mercy on\nhis knees. You have only to read in the papers of the recent strikes\nin Saint Petersburg, and the manifestations of the strikers with the\npretext of President Poincare's visit. . . . England will see her\nappeals to her colonies completely ignored. India is going to rise\nagainst her, and Egypt, too, will seize this opportunity for her\nemancipation.\"\n\nJulio was beginning to be impressed by these affirmations enunciated\nwith such oracular certainty, and he felt almost irritated at the\nincredulous Argensola, who continued looking insolently at the seer,\nrepeating with his winking eyes, \"He is insane--insane with pride.\" The\nman certainly must have strong reasons for making such awful prophecies.\nHis presence in Paris just at this time was difficult for Desnoyers to\nunderstand, and gave to his words a mysterious authority.\n\n\"But the nations will defend themselves,\" he protested to his cousin.\n\"Victory will not be such a very simple thing as you imagine.\"\n\n\"Yes, they will defend themselves, and the struggle will be fiercely\ncontested. It appears that, of late years, France has been paying some\nattention to her army. We shall undoubtedly encounter some resistance;\ntriumph may be somewhat difficult, but we are going to prevail. . . .\nYou have no idea to what extent the offensive power of Germany has\nattained. Nobody knows with certainty beyond the frontiers. If our foes\nshould comprehend it in all its immensity, they would fall on their\nknees beforehand to beg for mercy, thus obviating the necessity for\nuseless sacrifices.\"\n\nThere was a long silence. Julius von Hartrott appeared lost in reverie.\nThe very thought of the accumulated strength of his race submerged him\nin a species of mystic adoration.\n\n\"The preliminary victory,\" he suddenly exclaimed, \"we gained some time\nago. Our enemies, therefore, hate us, and yet they imitate us. All that\nbears the stamp of Germany is in demand throughout the world. The very\ncountries that are trying to resist our arms copy our methods in their\nuniversities and admire our theories, even those which do not attain\nsuccess in Germany. Oftentimes we laugh among ourselves, like the Roman\naugurs, upon seeing the servility with which they follow us! . . . And\nyet they will not admit our superiority!\"\n\nFor the first time, Argensola's eyes and general expression approved the\nwords of Hartrott. What he had just said was only too true--the world\nwas a victim of \"the German superstition.\" An intellectual cowardice,\nthe fear of Force had made it admire en masse and indiscriminately,\neverything of Teutonic origin, just because of the intensity of its\nglitter--gold mixed with talcum. The so-called Latins, dazed with\nadmiration, were, with unreasonable pessimism, becoming doubtful of\ntheir ability, and thus were the first to decree their own death. And\nthe conceited Germans merely had to repeat the words of these pessimists\nin order to strengthen their belief in their own superiority.\n\nWith that Southern temperament, which leaps rapidly from one extreme\nto another, many Latins had proclaimed that in the world of the\nfuture, there would be no place for the Latin peoples, now in their\ndeath-agony--adding that Germany alone preserved the latent forces\nof civilization. The French who declaimed among themselves, with the\ngreatest exaggeration, unconscious that folks were listening the other\nside of the door, had proclaimed repeatedly for many years past, that\nFrance was degenerating rapidly and would soon vanish from the earth.\n. . . Then why should they resent the scorn of their enemies. . . . Why\nshouldn't the Germans share in their beliefs?\n\nThe professor, misinterpreting the silent agreement of the Spaniard who\nuntil then had been listening with such a hostile smile, added:\n\n\"Now is the time to try out in France the German culture, implanting it\nthere as conquerors.\"\n\nHere Argensola interrupted, \"And what if there is no such thing as\nGerman culture, as a celebrated Teuton says?\" It had become necessary\nto contradict this pedant who had become insufferable with his egotism.\nHartrott almost jumped from his chair on hearing such a doubt.\n\n\"What German is that?\"\n\n\"Nietzsche.\"\n\nThe professor looked at him pityingly. Nietzsche had said to mankind,\n\"Be harsh!\" affirming that \"a righteous war sanctifies every cause.\"\nHe had exalted Bismarck; he had taken part in the war of '70; he was\nglorifying Germany when he spoke of \"the smiling lion,\" and \"the blond\nbeast.\" But Argensola listened with the tranquillity of one sure of his\nground. Oh, hours of placid reading near the studio chimney, listening\nto the rain beating against the pane! . . .\n\n\"The philosopher did say that,\" he admitted, \"and he said many other\nvery different things, like all great thinkers. His doctrine is one of\npride, but of individual pride, not that of a nation or race. He always\nspoke against 'the insidious fallacy of race.'\"\n\nArgensola recalled his philosophy word for word. Culture, according\nto Nietzsche, was \"unity of style in all the manifestations of life.\"\nScience did not necessarily include culture. Great knowledge might be\naccompanied with great barbarity, by the absence of style or by the\nchaotic confusion of all styles. Germany, according to the philosopher,\nhad no genuine culture owing to its lack of style. \"The French,\" he had\nsaid, \"were at the head of an authentic and fruitful culture, whatever\ntheir valor might be, and until now everybody had drawn upon it.\" Their\nhatreds were concentrated within their own country. \"I cannot endure\nGermany. The spirit of servility and pettiness penetrates everywhere.\n. . . I believe only in French culture, and what the rest of Europe calls\nculture appears to me to be a mistake. The few individual cases of lofty\nculture that I met in Germany were of French origin.\"\n\n\"You know,\" continued Argensola, \"that in quarrelling with Wagner about\nthe excess of Germanism in his art, Nietzsche proclaimed the necessity\nof mediterraneanizing music. His ideal was a culture for all Europe, but\nwith a Latin base.\"\n\nJulius von Hartrott replied most disdainfully to this, repeating the\nSpaniard's very words. Men who thought much said many things. Besides,\nNietzsche was a poet, completely demented at his death, and was no\nauthority among the University sages. His fame had only been recognized\nin foreign lands. . . . And he paid no further attention to the youth,\nignoring him as though he had evaporated into thin air after his\npresumption. All the professor's attention was now concentrated on\nDesnoyers.\n\n\"This country,\" he resumed, \"is dying from within. How can you doubt\nthat revolution will break out the minute war is declared? . . .\nHave you not noticed the agitation of the boulevard on account of the\nCaillaux trial? Reactionaries and revolutionists have been assaulting\neach other for the past three days. I have seen them challenging one\nanother with shouts and songs as if they were going to come to blows\nright in the middle of the street. This division of opinion will become\naccentuated when our troops cross the frontier. It will then be civil\nwar. The anti-militarists are clamoring mournfully, believing that it\nis in the power of the government to prevent the clash. . . . A country\ndegenerated by democracy and by the inferiority of the triumphant Celt,\ngreedy for full liberty! . . . We are the only free people on earth\nbecause we know how to obey.\"\n\nThis paradox made Julio smile. Germany the only free people! . . .\n\n\"It is so,\" persisted Hartrott energetically. \"We have the liberty best\nsuited to a great people--economical and intellectual liberty.\"\n\n\"And political liberty?\"\n\nThe professor received this question with a scornful shrug.\n\n\"Political liberty! . . . Only decadent and ungovernable people,\ninferior races anxious for equality and democratic confusion, talk about\npolitical liberty. We Germans do not need it. We are a nation of masters\nwho recognize the sacredness of government, and we wish to be commanded\nby those of superior birth. We possess the genius of organization.\"\n\nThat, according to the Doctor, was the grand German secret, and the\nTeutonic race upon taking possession of the world, would share its\ndiscovery with all. The nations would then be so organized that each\nindividual would give the maximum of service to society. Humanity,\nbanded in regiments for every class of production, obeying a superior\nofficer, like machines contributing the greatest possible output of\nlabor--there you have the perfect state! Liberty was a purely negative\nidea if not accompanied with a positive concept which would make it\nuseful.\n\nThe two friends listened with astonishment to this description of the\nfuture which Teutonic superiority was offering to the world. Every\nindividual submitted to intensive production, the same as a bit of land\nfrom which its owner wishes to get the greatest number of vegetables.\n. . . Mankind reduced to mechanics. . . . No useless operations that would\nnot produce immediate results. . . . And the people who heralded this\nawful idea were the very philosophers and idealists who had once given\ncontemplation and reflection the first place in their existence! . . .\n\nHartrott again harked back to the inferiority of their racial enemies.\nIn order to combat successfully, it required self-assurance, an\nunquenchable confidence in the superiority of their own powers.\n\n\"At this very hour in Berlin, everyone is accepting war, everyone is\nbelieving that victory is sure, while HERE! . . . I do not say that\nthe French are afraid; they have a brave past that galvanizes them at\ncertain times--but they are so depressed that it is easy to guess that\nthey will make almost any sacrifices in order to evade what is coming\nupon them. The people first will shout with enthusiasm, as it always\ncheers that which carries it to perdition. The upper classes have no\nfaith in the future; they are keeping quiet, but the presentiment of\ndisaster may easily be conjectured. Yesterday I was talking with your\nfather. He is French, and he is rich. He was indignant against the\ngovernment of his country for involving the nation in the European\nconflict in order to defend a distant and uninteresting people. He\ncomplains of the exalted patriots who have opened the abyss between\nGermany and France, preventing a reconciliation. He says that Alsace and\nLorraine are not worth what a war would cost in men and money. . . .\nHe recognizes our greatness and is convinced that we have progressed so\nrapidly that the other countries cannot come up to us. . . . And as your\nfather thinks, so do many others--all those who are wrapped in creature\ncomfort, and fear to lose it. Believe me, a country that hesitates and\nfears war is conquered before the first battle.\"\n\nJulio evinced a certain disquietude, as though he would like to cut\nshort the conversation.\n\n\"Just leave my father out of it! He speaks that way to-day because war\nis not yet an accomplished fact, and he has to contradict and vent his\nindignation on whoever comes near him. To-morrow he will say just the\nopposite. . . . My father is a Latin.\"\n\nThe professor looked at his watch. He must go; there were still many\nthings which he had to do before going to the station. The Germans\nliving in Paris had fled in great bands as though a secret order had\nbeen circulating among them. That afternoon the last of those who had\nbeen living ostensibly in the Capital would depart.\n\n\"I have come to see you because of our family interest, because it was\nmy duty to give you fair warning. You are a foreigner, and nothing holds\nyou here. If you are desirous of witnessing a great historic event,\nremain--but it will be better for you to go. The war is going to be\nruthless, very ruthless, and if Paris attempts resistance, as formerly,\nwe shall see terrible things. Modes of offense have greatly changed.\"\n\nDesnoyers made a gesture of indifference.\n\n\"The same as your father,\" observed the professor. \"Last night he and\nall your family responded in the same way. Even my mother prefers to\nremain with her sister, saying that the Germans are very good, very\ncivilized and there is nothing to apprehend in their triumph.\"\n\nThis good opinion seemed to be troubling the Doctor.\n\n\"They don't understand what modern warfare means. They ignore the fact\nthat our generals have studied the art of overcoming the enemy and they\nwill apply it mercilessly. Ruthlessness is the only means, since\nit perturbs the intelligence of the enemy, paralyzes his action and\npulverizes his resistance. The more ferocious the war, the more\nquickly it is concluded. To punish with cruelty is to proceed humanely.\nTherefore, Germany is going to be cruel with a cruelty hitherto unseen,\nin order that the conflict may not be prolonged.\"\n\nHe had risen and was standing, cane and straw hat in hand. Argensola was\nlooking at him with frank hostility. The professor, obliged to pass near\nhim, did so with a stiff and disdainful nod.\n\nThen he started toward the door, accompanied by his cousin. The farewell\nwas brief.\n\n\"I repeat my counsel. If you do not like danger, go! It may be that I am\nmistaken, and that this nation, convinced of the uselessness of defense,\nmay give itself up voluntarily. . . . At any rate, we shall soon see.\nI shall take great pleasure in returning to Paris when the flag of the\nEmpire is floating over the Eiffel Tower, a mere matter of three or four\nweeks, certainly by the beginning of September.\"\n\nFrance was going to disappear from the map. To the Doctor, her death was\na foregone conclusion.\n\n\"Paris will remain,\" he admitted benevolently, \"the French will remain,\nbecause a nation is not easily suppressed; but they will not retain\ntheir former place. We shall govern the world; they will continue to\noccupy themselves in inventing fashions, in making life agreeable for\nvisiting foreigners; and in the intellectual world, we shall encourage\nthem to educate good actresses, to produce entertaining novels and to\nwrite witty comedies. . . . Nothing more.\"\n\nDesnoyers laughed as he shook his cousin's hand, pretending to take his\nwords as a paradox.\n\n\"I mean it,\" insisted Hartrott. \"The last hour of the French Republic as\nan important nation has sounded. I have studied it at close range,\nand it deserves no better fate. License and lack of confidence\nabove--sterile enthusiasm below.\"\n\nUpon turning his head, he again caught Argensola's malicious smile.\n\n\"We know all about that kind of study,\" he added aggressively. \"We are\naccustomed to examine the nations of the past, to dissect them fibre by\nfibre, so that we recognize at a glance the psychology of the living.\"\n\nThe Bohemian fancied that he saw a surgeon talking self-sufficiently\nabout the mysteries of the will before a corpse. What did this pedantic\ninterpreter of dead documents know about life? . . .\n\nWhen the door closed, he approached his friend who was returning\nsomewhat dismayed. Argensola no longer considered Doctor Julius von\nHartrott crazy.\n\n\"What a brute!\" he exclaimed, throwing up his hands. \"And to think that\nthey are at large, these originators of gloomy errors! . . . Who would\never believe that they belong to the same land that produced Kant, the\npacifist, the serene Goethe and Beethoven! . . . To think that for so\nmany years, we have believed that they were forming a nation of dreamers\nand philosophers occupied in working disinterestedly for all\nmankind! . . .\"\n\nThe sentence of a German geographer recurred to him: \"The German is\nbicephalous; with one head he dreams and poetizes while with the other\nhe thinks and executes.\"\n\nDesnoyers was now beginning to feel depressed at the certainty of war.\nThis professor seemed to him even worse than the Herr Counsellor and the\nother Germans that he had met on the steamer. His distress was not only\nbecause of his selfish thought as to how the catastrophe was going to\naffect his plans with Marguerite. He was suddenly discovering that\nin this hour of uncertainty he loved France. He recognized it as his\nfather's native land and the scene of the great Revolution. . . .\nAlthough he had never mixed in political campaigns, he was a republican\nat heart, and had often ridiculed certain of his friends who adored\nkings and emperors, thinking it a great sign of distinction.\n\nArgensola tried to cheer him up.\n\n\"Who knows? . . . This is a country of surprises. One must see the\nFrenchman when he tries to remedy his want of foresight. Let that\nbarbarian of a cousin of yours say what he will--there is order, there\nis enthusiasm. . . . Worse off than we were those who lived in the days\nbefore Valmy. Entirely disorganized, their only defense battalions of\nlaborers and countrymen handling a gun for the first time. . . . But,\nnevertheless, the Europe of the old monarchies could not for twenty\nyears free themselves from these improvised warriors!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nIN WHICH APPEAR THE FOUR HORSEMEN\n\n\nThe two friends now lived a feverish life, considerably accelerated by\nthe rapidity with which events succeeded each other. Every hour brought\nforth an astonishing bit of news--generally false--which changed\nopinions very suddenly. As soon as the danger of war seemed arrested,\nthe report would spread that mobilization was going to be ordered within\na few minutes.\n\nWithin each twenty-four hours were compressed the disquietude, anxiety\nand nervous waste of a normal year. And that which was aggravating the\nsituation still more was the uncertainty, the expectation of the\nevent, feared but still invisible, the distress on account of a danger\ncontinually threatening but never arriving.\n\nHistory in the making was like a stream overflowing its banks, events\noverlapping each other like the waves of an inundation. Austria was\ndeclaring war with Servia while the diplomats of the great powers were\ncontinuing their efforts to stem the tide. The electric web girdling the\nplanet was vibrating incessantly in the depths of the ocean and on the\npeaks of the continents, transmitting alternate hopes and fears.\n\nRussia was mobilizing a part of its army. Germany, with its troops in\nreadiness under the pretext of manoeuvres, was decreeing the state of\n\"threatened war.\" The Austrians, regardless of the efforts of diplomacy,\nwere beginning the bombardment of Belgrade. William II, fearing that the\nintervention of the Powers might settle the differences between the\nCzar and the Emperor of Austria, was forcing the course of events by\ndeclaring war upon Russia. Then Germany began isolating herself, cutting\noff railroad and telegraphic communications in order to shroud in\nmystery her invading forces.\n\nFrance was watching this avalanche of events, temperate in its words and\nenthusiasm. A cool and grave resolution was noticeable everywhere. Two\ngenerations had come into the world, informed as soon as they reached\na reasonable age, that some day there would undoubtedly be war. Nobody\nwanted it; the adversary imposed it. . . . But all were accepting it\nwith the firm intention of fulfilling their duty.\n\nDuring the daytime Paris was very quiet, concentrating the mind on\nthe work in hand. Only a few groups of exalted patriots, following the\ntricolored flag, were passing through the place de la Concorde, in order\nto salute the statue of Strasbourg. The people were accosting each other\nin a friendly way in the streets. Everybody seemed to know everybody\nelse, although they might not have met before. Eye attracted eye,\nand smiles appeared to broaden mutually with the sympathy of a common\ninterest. The women were sad but speaking cheerily in order to hide\ntheir emotions. In the long summer twilight, the boulevards were filling\nwith crowds. Those from the outlying districts were converging toward\nthe centre of the city, as in the remote revolutionary days, banding\ntogether in groups, forming an endless multitude from which came shouts\nand songs. These manifestations were passing through the centre under\nthe electric lights that were just being turned on, the processions\ngenerally lasting until midnight, with the national banner floating\nabove the walking crowds, escorted by the flags of other nations.\n\nIt was on one of these nights of sincere enthusiasm that the two friends\nheard an unexpected, astonishing piece of news. \"They have killed\nJaures!\" The groups were repeating it from one to another with an\namazement which seemed to overpower their grief. \"Jaures assassinated!\nAnd what for?\" The best popular element, which instinctively seeks an\nexplanation of every proceeding, remained in suspense, not knowing\nwhich way to turn. The tribune dead, at the very moment that his word as\nwelder of the people was most needed! . . .\n\nArgensola thought immediately of Tchernoff. \"What will our neighbors\nsay?\" . . . The quiet, orderly people of Paris were fearing a\nrevolution, and for a few moments Desnoyers believed that his cousin's\nauguries were about to be fulfilled. This assassination, with its\nretaliations, might be the signal for civil war. But the masses of the\npeople, worn out with grief at the death of their hero, were waiting in\ntragic silence. All were seeing, beyond his dead body, the image of the\ncountry.\n\nBy the following morning, the danger had vanished. The laboring classes\nwere talking of generals and war, showing each other their little\nmilitary memorandums, announcing the date of their departure as soon as\nthe order of mobilization should be published. \"I go the second day.\" \"I\nthe first.\" Those of the standing army who were on leave were recalled\nindividually to the barracks. All these events were tending in the same\ndirection--war.\n\nThe Germans were invading Luxembourg; the Germans were ordering their\narmies to invade the French frontier when their ambassador was still in\nParis making promises of peace. On the day after the death of Jaures,\nthe first of August, the people were crowding around some pieces of\npaper, written by hand and in evident haste. These papers were copies of\nother larger printed sheets, headed by two crossed flags. \"It has come;\nit is now a fact!\". . . It was the order for general mobilization. All\nFrance was about to take up arms, and chests seemed to expand with a\nsigh of relief. Eyes were sparkling with excitement. The nightmare was\nat last over! . . . Cruel reality was preferable to the uncertainty of\ndays and days, each as long as a week.\n\nIn vain President Poincare, animated by a last hope, was explaining to\nthe French that \"mobilization is not necessarily war, that a call to\narms may be simply a preventive measure.\" \"It is war, inevitable war,\"\nsaid the populace with a fatalistic expression. And those who were going\nto start that very night or the following day were the most eager and\nenthusiastic.--\"Now those who seek us are going to find us! Vive la\nFrance!\" The Chant du Depart, the martial hymn of the volunteers of the\nfirst Republic, had been exhumed by the instinct of a people which\nseek the voice of Art in its most critical moments. The stanzas of the\nconservative Chenier, adapted to a music of warlike solemnity, were\nresounding through the streets, at the same time as the Marseillaise:\n\n     La Republique nous appelle.\n     Sachons vaincre ou sachons perir;\n     Un francais doit vivre pour elle.\n     Pour elle un francais doit mourir.\n\nThe mobilization began at midnight to the minute. At dusk, groups of men\nbegan moving through the streets towards the stations. Their families\nwere walking beside them, carrying the valise or bundle of clothes.\nThey were escorted by the friends of their district, the tricolored flag\nborne aloft at the head of these platoons. The Reserves were donning\ntheir old uniforms which presented all the difficulties of suits long\nago forgotten. With new leather belts and their revolvers at their\nsides, they were betaking themselves to the railway which was to carry\nthem to the point of concentration. One of their children was carrying\nthe old sword in its cloth sheath. The wife was hanging on his arm,\nsad and proud at the same time, giving her last counsels in a loving\nwhisper.\n\nStreet cars, automobiles and cabs rolled by with crazy velocity. Nobody\nhad ever seen so many vehicles in the Paris streets, yet if anybody\nneeded one, he called in vain to the conductors, for none wished to\nserve mere civilians. All means of transportation were for military\nmen, all roads ended at the railroad stations. The heavy trucks of the\nadministration, filled with sacks, were saluted with general enthusiasm.\n\"Hurrah for the army!\" The soldiers in mechanic's garb, on top of the\nswaying pyramid, replied to the cheers, waving their arms and uttering\nshouts that nobody pretended to understand.\n\nFraternity had created a tolerance hitherto unknown. The crowds were\npressing forward, but in their encounters, invariably preserved good\norder. Vehicles were running into each other, and when the conductors\nresorted to the customary threats, the crowds would intervene and make\nthem shake hands. \"Three cheers for France!\" The pedestrians, escaping\nbetween the wheels of the automobiles were laughing and good-naturedly\nreproaching the chauffeur with, \"Would you kill a Frenchman on his way\nto his regiment?\" and the conductor would reply, \"I, too, am going in\na few hours. This is my last trip.\" As night approached, cars and cabs\nwere running with increasing irregularity, many of the employees having\nabandoned their posts to take leave of their families and make the\ntrain. All the life of Paris was concentrating itself in a half-dozen\nhuman rivers emptying in the stations.\n\nDesnoyers and Argensola met in a boulevard cafe toward midnight. Both\nwere exhausted by the day's emotions and under that nervous depression\nwhich follows noisy and violent spectacles. They needed to rest. War\nwas a fact, and now that it was a certainty, they felt no anxiety to get\nfurther news. Remaining in the cafe proved impossible. In the hot and\nsmoky atmosphere, the occupants were singing and shouting and waving\ntiny flags. All the battle hymns of the past and present were here\nintoned in chorus, to an accompaniment of glasses and plates. The\nrather cosmopolitan clientele was reviewing the European nations. All,\nabsolutely all, were going to enroll themselves on the side of France.\n\"Hurrah! . . . Hurrah!\" . . . An old man and his wife were seated at a\ntable near the two friends. They were tenants, of an orderly, humdrum\nwalk in life, who perhaps in all their existence had never been awake at\nsuch an hour. In the general enthusiasm they had come to the boulevards\n\"in order to see war a little closer.\" The foreign tongue used by his\nneighbors gave the husband a lofty idea of their importance.\n\n\"Do you believe that England is going to join us?\" . . .\n\nArgensola knew as much about it as he, but he replied authoritatively,\n\"Of course she will. That's a sure thing!\" The old man rose to his feet:\n\"Hurrah for England!\" and he began chanting a forgotten patriotic song,\nmarking time with his arms in a spirited way, to the great admiration\nof his old wife, and urging all to join in the chorus that very few were\nable to follow.\n\nThe two friends had to take themselves home on foot. They could not find\na vehicle that would stop for them; all were hurrying in the opposite\ndirection toward the stations. They were both in a bad humor, but\nArgensola couldn't keep his to himself.\n\n\"Ah, these women!\" Desnoyers knew all about his relations (so far\nhonorable) with a midinette from the rue Taitbout. Sunday strolls in the\nsuburbs of Paris, various trips to the moving picture shows, comments\nupon the fine points of the latest novel published in the sheets of a\npopular paper, kisses of farewell when she took the night train from\nBois Colombes in order to sleep at home--that was all. But Argensola was\nwickedly counting on Father Time to mellow the sharpest virtues. That\nevening they had taken some refreshment with a French friend who was\ngoing the next morning to join his regiment. The girl had sometimes\nseen him with Argensola without noticing him particularly, but now she\nsuddenly began admiring him as though he were another person. She had\ngiven up the idea of returning home that night; she wanted to see how\na war begins. The three had dined together, and all her interest had\ncentred upon the one who was going away. She even took offense, with\nsudden modesty, when Argensola tried as he had often done before, to\nsqueeze her hand under the table. Meanwhile she was almost leaning her\nhead on the shoulder of the future hero, enveloping him with admiring\ngaze.\n\n\"And they have gone. . . . They have gone away together!\" said the\nSpaniard bitterly. \"I had to leave them in order not to make my hard\nluck any worse. To have worked so long . . . for another!\"\n\nHe was silent for a few minutes, then changing the trend of his ideas,\nhe added: \"I recognize, nevertheless, that her behavior is beautiful.\nThe generosity of these women when they believe that the moment for\nsacrifice has come! She is terribly afraid of her father, and yet she\nstays away from home all night with a person whom she hardly knows, and\nwhom she was not even thinking of in the middle of the afternoon! . . .\nThe entire nation feels gratitude toward those who are going to imperil\ntheir lives, and she, poor child, wishing to do something, too, for\nthose destined for death, to give them a little pleasure in their last\nhour . . . is giving the best she has, that which she can never recover.\nI have sketched her role poorly, perhaps. . . . Laugh at me if you want\nto, but admit that it is beautiful.\"\n\nDesnoyers laughed heartily at his friend's discomfiture, in spite of the\nfact that he, too, was suffering a good deal of secret annoyance. He had\nseen Marguerite but once since the day of his return. The only news of\nher that he had received was by letter. . . . This cursed war! What an\nupset for happy people! Marguerite's mother was ill. She was brooding\nover the departure of her son, an officer, on the first day of the\nmobilization. Marguerite, too, was uneasy about her brother and did not\nthink it expedient to come to the studio while her mother was grieving\nat home. When was this situation ever to end? . . .\n\nThat check for four hundred thousand francs which he had brought from\nAmerica was also worrying him. The day before, the bank had declined to\npay it for lack of the customary official advice. Afterward they said\nthat they had received the advice, but did not give him the money. That\nvery afternoon, when the trust companies had closed their doors, the\ngovernment had already declared a moratorium, in order to prevent a\ngeneral bankruptcy due to the general panic. When would they pay him?\n. . . Perhaps when the war which had not yet begun was ended--perhaps\nnever. He had no other money available except the two thousand francs\nleft over from his travelling expenses. All of his friends were in the\nsame distressing situation, unable to draw on the sums which they had in\nthe banks. Those who had any money were obliged to go from shop to shop,\nor form in line at the bank doors, in order to get a bill changed. Oh,\nthis war! This stupid war!\n\nIn the Champs Elysees, they saw a man with a broad-brimmed hat who\nwas walking slowly ahead of them and talking to himself. Argensola\nrecognized him as he passed near the street lamp, \"Friend Tchernoff.\"\nUpon returning their greeting, the Russian betrayed a slight odor of\nwine. Uninvited, he had adjusted his steps to theirs, accompanying them\ntoward the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nJulio had merely exchanged silent nods with Argensola's new acquaintance\nwhen encountering him in the vestibule; but sadness softens the heart\nand makes us seek the friendship of the humble as a refreshing shelter.\nTchernoff, on the contrary, looked at Desnoyers as though he had known\nhim all his life.\n\nThe man had interrupted his monologue, heard only by the black masses\nof vegetation, the blue shadows perforated by the reddish tremors of\nthe street lights, the summer night with its cupola of warm breezes and\ntwinkling stars. He took a few steps without saying anything, as a mark\nof consideration to his companions, and then renewed his arguments,\ntaking them up where he had broken off, without offering any\nexplanation, as though he were still talking to himself. . . .\n\n\"And at this very minute, they are shouting with enthusiasm the same as\nthey are doing here, honestly believing that they are going to defend\ntheir outraged country, wishing to die for their families and firesides\nthat nobody has threatened.\"\n\n\"Who are 'they,' Tchernoff?\" asked Argensola.\n\nThe Russian stared at him as though surprised at such a question.\n\n\"They,\" he said laconically.\n\nThe two understood. . . . THEY! It could not be anyone else.\n\n\"I have lived ten years in Germany,\" he continued, connecting up his\nwords, now that he found himself listened to. \"I was daily correspondent\nfor a paper in Berlin and I know these people. Passing along these\nthronged boulevards, I have been seeing in my imagination what must be\nhappening there at this hour. They, too, are singing and shouting with\nenthusiasm as they wave their flags. On the outside, they seem just\nalike--but oh, what a difference within! . . . Last night the people\nbeset a few babblers in the boulevard who were yelling, 'To Berlin!'--a\nslogan of bad memories and worse taste. France does not wish\nconquests; her only desire is to be respected, to live in peace without\nhumiliations or disturbances. To-night two of the mobilized men said on\nleaving, 'When we enter Germany we are going to make it a republic!'\n. . . A republic is not a perfect thing, but it is better than living\nunder an irresponsible monarchy by the grace of God. It at least\npresupposes tranquillity and absence of the personal ambitions that\ndisturb life. I was impressed by the generous thought of these laboring\nmen who, instead of wishing to exterminate their enemies, were planning\nto give them something better.\"\n\nTchernoff remained silent a few minutes, smiling ironically at the\npicture which his imagination was calling forth.\n\n\"In Berlin, the masses are expressing their enthusiasm in the lofty\nphraseology befitting a superior people. Those in the lowest classes,\naccustomed to console themselves for humiliations with a gross\nmaterialism, are now crying 'Nach Paris! We are going to drink champagne\ngratis!' The pietistic burgher, ready to do anything to attain a new\nhonor, and the aristocracy which has given the world the greatest\nscandals of recent years, are also shouting, 'Nach Paris!' To them Paris\nis the Babylon of the deadly sin, the city of the Moulin Rouge and the\nrestaurants of Montmartre, the only places that they know. . . . And my\ncomrades of the Social-Democracy, they are also cheering, but to another\ntune.--'To-morrow! To St. Petersburg! Russian ascendency, the menace\nof civilization, must be obliterated!' The Kaiser waving the tyranny of\nanother country as a scarecrow to his people! . . . What a joke!\"\n\nAnd the loud laugh of the Russian sounded through the night like the\nnoise of wooden clappers.\n\n\"We are more civilized than the Germans,\" he said, regaining his\nself-control.\n\nDesnoyers, who had been listening with great interest, now gave a start\nof surprise, saying to himself, \"This Tchernoff has been drinking.\"\n\n\"Civilization,\" continued the Socialist, \"does not consist merely in\ngreat industry, in many ships, armies and numerous universities that\nonly teach science. That is material civilization. There is another, a\nsuperior one, that elevates the soul and does not permit human dignity\nto suffer without protesting against continual humiliations. A Swiss\nliving in his wooden chalet and considering himself the equal of the\nother men of his country, is more civilized than the Herr Professor who\ngives precedence to a lieutenant, or to a Hamburg millionaire who, in\nturn, bends his neck like a lackey before those whose names are prefixed\nby a von.\"\n\nHere the Spaniard assented as though he could guess what Tchernoff was\ngoing to say.\n\n\"We Russians endure great tyranny. I know something about that. I know\nthe hunger and cold of Siberia. . . . But opposed to our tyranny\nhas always existed a revolutionary protest. Part of the nation is\nhalf-barbarian, but the rest has a superior mentality, a lofty moral\nspirit which faces danger and sacrifice because of liberty and truth.\n. . . And Germany? Who there has ever raised a protest in order to defend\nhuman rights? What revolutions have ever broken out in Prussia, the land\nof the great despots?\n\n\"Frederick William, the founder of militarism, when he was tired of\nbeating his wife and spitting in his children's plates, used to sally\nforth, thong in hand, in order to cowhide those subjects who did not get\nout of his way in time. His son, Frederick the Great, declared that he\ndied, bored to death with governing a nation of slaves. In two centuries\nof Prussian history, one single revolution--the barricades of 1848--a\nbad Berlinish copy of the Paris revolution, and without any result.\nBismarck corrected with a heavy hand so as to crush completely the last\nattempts at protest--if such ever really existed. And when his friends\nwere threatening him with revolution, the ferocious Junker, merely put\nhis hands on his hips and roared with the most insolent of horse laughs.\nA revolution in Prussia! . . . Nothing at all, as he knew his people!\"\n\nTchernoff was not a patriot. Many a time Argensola had heard him railing\nagainst his country, but now he was indignant in view of the contempt\nwith which Teutonic haughtiness was treating the Russian nation.\nWhere, in the last forty years of imperial grandeur, was that universal\nsupremacy of which the Germans were everlastingly boasting? . . .\n\nExcellent workers in science; tenacious and short-sighted academicians,\neach wrapped in his specialty!--Benedictines of the laboratory who\nexperimented painstakingly and occasionally hit upon something, in spite\nof enormous blunders given out as truths, because they were their own\n. . . that was all! And side by side with such patient laboriosity, really\nworthy of respect--what charlatanism! What great names exploited as a\nshop sample! How many sages turned into proprietors of sanatoriums!\n. . . A Herr Professor discovers the cure of tuberculosis, and the\ntubercular keep on dying as before. Another labels with a number the\ninvincible remedy for the most unconfessable of diseases, and the\ngenital scourge continues afflicting the world. And all these errors\nwere representing great fortunes, each saving panacea bringing into\nexistence an industrial corporation selling its products at high\nprices--as though suffering were a privilege of the rich. How different\nfrom the bluff Pasteur and other clever men of the inferior races who\nhave given their discoveries to the world without stooping to form\nmonopolies!\n\n\"German science,\" continued Tchernoff, \"has given much to humanity, I\nadmit that; but the science of other nations has done as much. Only a\nnation puffed up with conceit could imagine that it has done everything\nfor civilization, and the others nothing. . . . Apart from their learned\nspecialists, what genius has been produced in our day by this Germany\nwhich believes itself so transcendent? Wagner, the last of the\nromanticists, closes an epoch and belongs to the past. Nietzsche took\npains to proclaim his Polish origin and abominated Germany, a country,\naccording to him, of middle-class pedants. His Slavism was so pronounced\nthat he even prophesied the overthrow of the Prussians by the Slavs.\n. . . And there are others. We, although a savage people, have given\nthe world of modern times an admirable moral grandeur. Tolstoi and\nDostoievsky are world-geniuses. What names can the Germany of William II\nput ahead of these? . . . His country was the country of music, but the\nRussian musicians of to-day are more original than the mere followers\nof Wagner, the copyists who take refuge in orchestral exasperations in\norder to hide their mediocrity. . . . In its time of stress the German\nnation had men of genius, before Pan-Germanism had been born, when\nthe Empire did not exist. Goethe, Schiller, Beethoven were subjects of\nlittle principalities. They received influence from other countries and\ncontributed their share to the universal civilization like citizens of\nthe world, without insisting that the world should, therefore, become\nGermanized.\"\n\nCzarism had committed atrocities. Tchernoff knew that by experience, and\ndid not need the Germans to assure him of it. But all the illustrious\nclasses of Russia were enemies of that tyranny and were protesting\nagainst it. Where in Germany were the intellectual enemies of Prussian\nCzarism? They were either holding their peace, or breaking forth into\nadulation of the anointed of the Lord--a musician and comedian like\nNero, of a sharp and superficial intelligence, who believed that by\nmerely skimming through anything he knew it all. Eager to strike a\nspectacular pose in history, he had finally afflicted the world with the\ngreatest of calamities.\n\n\"Why must the tyranny that weighs upon my country necessarily be\nRussian? The worst Czars were imitators of Prussia. Every time that the\nRussian people of our day have attempted to revindicate their rights,\nthe reactionaries have used the Kaiser as a threat, proclaiming that he\nwould come to their aid. One-half of the Russian aristocracy is German;\nthe functionaries who advise and support despotism are Germans; German,\ntoo, are the generals who have distinguished themselves by massacring\nthe people; German are the officials who undertake to punish the\nlaborers' strikes and the rebellion of their allies. The reactionary\nSlav is brutal, but he has the fine sensibility of a race in which many\nprinces have become Nihilists. He raises the lash with facility, but\nthen he repents and oftentimes weeps. I have seen Russian officials kill\nthemselves rather than march against the people, or through remorse\nfor slaughter committed. The German in the service of the Czar feels no\nscruples, nor laments his conduct. He kills coldly, with the minuteness\nand exactitude with which he does everything. The Russian is a barbarian\nwho strikes and regrets; German civilization shoots without hesitation.\nOur Slav Czar, in a humanitarian dream, favored the Utopian idea of\nuniversal peace, organizing the Conference of The Hague. The Kaiser of\nculture, meanwhile, has been working years and years in the erection and\nestablishment of a destructive organ of an immensity heretofore unknown,\nin order to crush all Europe. The Russian is a humble Christian,\nsocialistic, democratic, thirsting for justice; the German prides\nhimself upon his Christianity, but is an idolator like the German of\nother centuries. His religion loves blood and maintains castes; his true\nworship is that of Odin;--only that nowadays, the god of slaughter has\nchanged his name and calls himself, 'The State'!\"\n\nTchernoff paused an instant--perhaps in order to increase the wonder of\nhis companions--and then said with simplicity:\n\n\"I am a Christian.\"\n\nArgensola, who already knew the ideas and history of the Russian,\nstarted with astonishment, and Julio persisted in his suspicion, \"Surely\nTchernoff is drunk.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" declared the Russian earnestly, \"that I do not worry about\nGod, nor do I believe in dogmas, but my soul is Christian as is that\nof all revolutionists. The philosophy of modern democracy is lay\nChristianity. We Socialists love the humble, the needy, the weak. We\ndefend their right to life and well-being, as did the greatest lights\nof the religious world who saw a brother in every unfortunate. We exact\nrespect for the poor in the name of justice; the others ask for it in\nthe name of charity. That only separates us. But we strive that\nmankind may, by common consent, lead a better life, that the strong may\nsacrifice for the weak, the lofty for the lowly, and the world be ruled\nby brotherliness, seeking the greatest equality possible.\"\n\nThe Slav reviewed the history of human aspirations. Greek thought had\nbrought comfort, a sense of well-being on the earth--but only for the\nfew, for the citizens of the little democracies, for the free men,\nleaving the slaves and barbarians who constituted the majority, in their\nmisery. Christianity, the religion of the lowly, had recognized the\nright of happiness for all mankind, but this happiness was placed in\nheaven, far from this world, this \"vale of tears.\" The Revolution\nand its heirs, the Socialists, were trying to place happiness in the\nimmediate realities of earth, like the ancients, but making all humanity\nparticipants in it like the Christians.\n\n\"Where is the 'Christianity of modern Germany? . . . There is far more\ngenuine Christian spirit in the fraternal laity of the French Republic,\ndefender of the weak, than in the religiosity of the conservative\nJunkers. Germany has made a god in her own image, believing that she\nadores it, but in reality adoring her own image. The German God is a\nreflex of the German State which considers war as the first activity of\na nation and the noblest of occupations. Other Christian peoples, when\nthey have to go to war, feel the contradiction that exists between\ntheir conduct and the teachings of the Gospel, and excuse themselves by\nshowing the cruel necessity which impels them. Germany declares that war\nis acceptable to God. I have heard German sermons proving that Jesus was\nin favor of Militarism.\n\n\"Teutonic pride, the conviction that its race is providentially destined\nto dominate the world, brings into working unity their Protestants,\nCatholics and Jews.\n\n\"Far above their differences of dogma is that God of the State which\nis German--the Warrior God to whom William is probably referring as 'my\nworthy Ally.' Religions always tend toward universality. Their aim is to\nplace humanity in relationship with God, and to sustain these relations\namong mankind. Prussia has retrograded to barbarism, creating for its\npersonal use a second Jehovah, a divinity hostile to the greater part of\nthe human race who makes his own the grudges and ambitions of the German\npeople.\"\n\nTchernoff then explained in his own way the creation of this Teutonic\nGod, ambitious, cruel and vengeful. The Germans were comparatively\nrecent Christians. Their Christianity was not more than six centuries\nold. When the Crusades were drawing to a close, the Prussians were still\nliving in paganism. Pride of race, impelling them to war, had revived\nthese dead divinities. The God of the Gospel was now adorned by the\nGermans with lance and shield like the old Teutonic god who was a\nmilitary chief.\n\n\"Christianity in Berlin wears helmet and riding boots. God at this\nmoment is seeing Himself mobilized the same as Otto, Fritz and Franz,\nin order to punish the enemies of His chosen people. That the Lord has\ncommanded, 'Thou shalt not kill,' and His Son has said to the world,\n'Blessed are the peacemakers,' no longer matters. Christianity,\naccording to its German priests of all creeds, can only influence the\nindividual betterment of mankind, and should not mix itself in affairs\nof state. The Prussian God of the State is 'the old German God,' the\nlineal descendant of the ferocious Germanic mythology, a mixture of\ndivinities hungry for war.\"\n\nIn the silence of the avenue, the Russian evoked the ruddy figures of\nthe implacable gods, that were going to awake that night upon hearing\nthe hum of arms and smelling the acrid odor of blood. Thor, the brutal\ngod with the little head, was stretching his biceps and clutching the\nhammer that crushed cities. Wotan was sharpening his lance which had the\nlightning for its handle, the thunder for its blade. Odin, the one-eyed,\nwas gaping with gluttony on the mountain-tops, awaiting the dead\nwarriors that would crowd around his throne. The dishevelled Valkyries,\nfat and perspiring, were beginning to gallop from cloud to cloud,\nhallooing to humanity that they might carry off the corpses doubled like\nsaddle bags, over the haunches of their flying nags.\n\n\"German religiosity,\" continued the Russian, \"is the disavowal of\nChristianity. In its eyes, men are no longer equal before God. Their God\nis interested only in the strong, and favors them with his support\nso that they may dare anything. Those born weak must either submit or\ndisappear. Neither are nations equal, but are divided into leaders and\ninferior races whose destiny is to be sifted out and absorbed by their\nsuperiors. Since God has thus ordained, it is unnecessary to state that\nthe grand world-leader is Germany.\"\n\nArgensola here interrupted to observe that German pride believed itself\nchampioned not only by God but by science, too.\n\n\"I know that,\" interposed the Russian without letting him\nfinish--\"generalization, inequality, selection, the struggle for life,\nand all that. . . . The Germans, so conceited about their special worth,\nerect upon distant ground their intellectual monuments, borrowing of the\nforeigner their foundation material whenever they undertake a new line\nof work. A Frenchman and an Englishman, Gobineau and Chamberlain, have\ngiven them the arguments with which to defend the superiority of their\nrace. With the rubbish left over from Darwin and Spencer, their\nold Haeckel has built up his doctrine of 'Monism' which, applied to\npolitics, scientifically consecrates Prussian pride and recognizes its\nright to rule the world by force.\"\n\n\"No, a thousand times no!\" he exclaimed after a brief silence. \"The\nstruggle for existence with its procession of cruelties may be\ntrue among the lower species, but it should not be true among human\ncreatures. We are rational beings and ought to free ourselves from the\nfatality of environment, moulding it to our convenience. The animal does\nnot know law, justice or compassion; he lives enslaved in the obscurity\nof his instincts. We think, and thought signifies liberty. Force does\nnot necessarily have to be cruel; it is strongest when it does not take\nadvantage of its power, and is kindly. All have a right to the life into\nwhich they are born, and since among individuals there exist the haughty\nand the humble, the mighty and the weak, so should exist nations, large\nand small, old and young. The end of our existence is not combat nor\nkilling in order that others may afterwards kill us, and, perhaps, be\nkilled themselves. Civilized peoples ought unanimously to adopt the idea\nof southern Europe, striving for the most peaceful and sweetest form of\nlife possible.\"\n\nA cruel smile played over the Russian's beard.\n\n\"But there exists that Kultur, diametrically opposed to civilization,\nwhich the Germans wish to palm off upon us. Civilization is refinement\nof spirit, respect of one's neighbor, tolerance of foreign opinion,\ncourtesy of manner. Kultur is the action of a State that organizes and\nassimilates individuals and communities in order to utilize them for\nits own ends; and these ends consist mainly in placing 'The State' above\nother states, overwhelming them with their grandeur--or what is the same\nthing--with their haughty and violent pride.\"\n\nBy this time, the three had reached the place de l'Etoile. The dark\noutline of the Arc de Triomphe stood forth clearly in the starry\nexpanse. The avenues extended in all directions, a double file of\nlights. Those around the monument illuminated its gigantic bases and the\nfeet of the sculptured groups. Further up, the vaulted spaces were so\nlocked in shadow that they had the black density of ebony.\n\nUpon passing under the Arch, which greatly intensified the echo of their\nfootsteps, they came to a standstill. The night breeze had a wintry\nchill as it whistled past, and the curved masses seemed melting into the\ndiffused blue of space. Instinctively the three turned to glance back\nat the Champs Elysees. They saw only a river of shadow on which were\nfloating rosaries of red stars among the two long, black scarfs formed\nby the buildings. But they were so well acquainted with this panorama\nthat in imagination they mentally saw the majestic sweep of the avenue,\nthe double row of palaces, the place de la Concorde in the background\nwith the Egyptian obelisk, and the trees of the Tuileries.\n\n\"How beautiful it is!\" exclaimed Tchernoff who was seeing something\nbeyond the shadows. \"An entire civilization, loving peace and pleasure,\nhas passed through here.\"\n\nA memory greatly affected the Russian. Many an afternoon, after lunch,\nhe had met in this very spot a robust man, stocky, with reddish beard\nand kindly eyes--a man who looked like a giant who had just stopped\ngrowing. He was always accompanied by a dog. It was Jaures, his friend\nJaures, who before going to the senate was accustomed to taking a walk\ntoward the Arch from his home in Passy.\n\n\"He liked to come just where we are now! He loved to look at the\navenues, the distant gardens, all of Paris which can be seen from this\nheight; and filled with admiration, he would often say to me, 'This is\nmagnificent--one of the most beautiful perspectives that can be found in\nthe entire world.' . . . Poor Jaures!\"\n\nThrough association of ideas, the Russian evoked the image of his\ncompatriot, Michael Bakounine, another revolutionist, the father of\nanarchy, weeping with emotion at a concert after hearing the symphony\nwith Beethoven chorals directed by a young friend of his, named Richard\nWagner. \"When our revolution comes,\" he cried, clasping the hand of the\nmaster, \"whatever else may perish, this must be saved at any cost!\"\n\nTchernoff roused himself from his reveries to look around him and say\nwith sadness:\n\n\"THEY have passed through here!\"\n\nEvery time that he walked through the Arch, the same vision would spring\nup in his mind. THEY were thousands of helmets glistening in the sun,\nthousands of heavy boots lifted with mechanical rigidity at the same\ntime; horns, fifes, drums large and small, clashing against the majestic\nsilence of these stones--the warlike march from Lohengrin sounding in\nthe deserted avenues before the closed houses.\n\nHe, who was a foreigner, always felt attracted by the spell exerted by\nvenerable buildings guarding the glory of a bygone day. He did not wish\nto know who had erected it. As soon as its pride is flattered, mankind\ntries immediately to solidify it. Then Humanity intervenes with a\nbroader vision that changes the original significance of the work,\nenlarges it and strips it of its first egotistical import. The Greek\nstatues, models of the highest beauty, had been originally mere images\nof the temple, donated by the piety of the devotees of those times.\nUpon evoking Roman grandeur, everybody sees in imagination the enormous\nColiseum, circle of butcheries, or the arches erected to the glory\nof the inept Caesars. The representative works of nations have two\nsignifications--the interior or immediate one which their creators gave\nthem, and the exterior or universal interest, the symbolic value which\nthe centuries have given them.\n\n\"This Arch,\" continued Tchernoff, \"is French within, with its names\nof battles and generals open to criticism. On the outside, it is the\nmonument of the people who carried through the greatest revolution\nfor liberty ever known. The glorification of man is there below in\nthe column of the place Vendome. Here there is nothing individual. Its\nbuilders erected it to the memory of la Grande Armee and that Grand\nArmy was the people in arms who spread revolution throughout Europe. The\nartists, great inventors, foresaw the true significance of this work.\nThe warriors of Rude who are chanting the Marseillaise in the group\nat the left are not professional soldiers, they are armed citizens,\nmarching to work out their sublime and violent mission. Their nudity\nmakes them appear to me like sans-culottes in Grecian helmets. . . .\nHere there is more than the glory and egoism of a great nation. All\nEurope is awake to new life, thanks to these Crusaders of Liberty. . . .\nThe nations call to mind certain images. If I think of Greece, I see the\ncolumns of the Parthenon; Rome, Mistress of the World, is the Coliseum\nand the Arch of Trajan; and revolutionary France is the Arc de\nTriomphe.\"\n\nThe Arch was even more, according to the Russian. It represented a\ngreat historical retaliation; the nations of the South, called the\nLatin races, replying, after many centuries, to the invasion which had\ndestroyed the Roman jurisdiction--the Mediterranean peoples spreading\nthemselves as conquerors through the lands of the ancient barbarians.\nRetreating immediately, they had swept away the past like a tidal\nwave--the great surf depositing all that it contained. Like the waters\nof certain rivers which fructify by overflowing, this recession of the\nhuman tide had left the soil enriched with new and generous ideas.\n\n\"If THEY should return!\" added Tchernoff with a look of uneasiness.\n\"If they again should tread these stones! . . . Before, they were\nsimple-minded folk, stunned by their rapid good-fortune, who passed\nthrough here like a farmer through a salon. They were content with money\nfor the pocket and two provinces which should perpetuate the memory\nof their victory. . . . But now they will not be the soldiers only\nwho march against Paris. At the tail of the armies come the maddened\ncanteen-keepers, the Herr Professors, carrying at the side the little\nkeg of wine with the powder which crazes the barbarian, the wine\nof Kultur. And in the vans come also an enormous load of scientific\nsavagery, a new philosophy which glorifies Force as a principle and\nsanctifier of everything, denies liberty, suppresses the weak and places\nthe entire world under the charge of a minority chosen by God, just\nbecause it possesses the surest and most rapid methods of slaughter.\nHumanity may well tremble for the future if again resounds under this\narchway the tramp of boots following a march of Wagner or any other\nKapellmeister.\"\n\nThey left the Arch, following the avenue Victor Hugo. Tchernoff\nwalking along in dogged silence as though the vision of this imaginary\nprocession had overwhelmed him. Suddenly he continued aloud the course\nof his reflections.\n\n\"And if they should enter, what does it matter? . . . On that account,\nthe cause of Right will not die. It suffers eclipses, but is born again;\nit may be ignored and trampled under foot, but it does not, therefore,\ncease to exist, and all good souls recognize it as the only rule of\nlife. A nation of madmen wishes to place might upon the pedestal that\nothers have raised to Right. Useless endeavor! The eternal hope\nof mankind will ever be the increasing power of more liberty, more\nbrotherliness, more justice.\"\n\nThe Russian appeared to calm himself with this statement. He and\nhis friends spoke of the spectacle which Paris was presenting in its\npreparation for war. Tchernoff bemoaned the great suffering produced by\nthe catastrophe, the thousands and thousands of domestic tragedies that\nwere unrolling at that moment. Apparently nothing had changed. In the\ncentre of the city and around the stations, there was unusual agitation,\nbut the rest of the immense city did not appear affected by the great\noverthrow of its existence. The solitary street was presenting its usual\naspect, the breeze was gently moving the leaves. A solemn peace seemed\nto be spreading itself through space. The houses appeared wrapped in\nslumber, but behind the closed windows might be surmised the insomnia\nof the reddened eyes, the sighs from hearts anguished by the threatened\ndanger, the tremulous agility of the hands preparing the war outfit,\nperhaps the last loving greetings exchanged without pleasure, with\nkisses ending in sobs.\n\nTchernoff thought of his neighbors, the husband and wife who occupied\nthe other interior apartment behind the studio. She was no longer\nplaying the piano. The Russian had overheard disputes, the banging of\ndoors locked with violence, and the footsteps of a man in the middle of\nthe night, fleeing from a woman's cries. There had begun to develop on\nthe other side of the wall a regulation drama--a repetition of hundreds\nof others, all taking place at the same time.\n\n\"She is a German,\" volunteered the Russian. \"Our concierge has ferreted\nout her nationality. He must have gone by this time to join his\nregiment. Last night I could hardly sleep. I heard the lamentations\nthrough the thin wall partition, the steady, desperate weeping of an\nabandoned child, and the voice of a man who was vainly trying to quiet\nher! . . . Ah, what a rain of sorrows is now falling upon the world!\"\n\nThat same evening, on leaving the house, he had met her by her door.\nShe appeared like another woman, with an old look as though in these\nagonizing hours she had been suffering for fifteen years. In vain the\nkindly Tchernoff had tried to cheer her up, urging her to accept quietly\nher husband's absence so as not to harm the little one who was coming.\n\n\"For the unhappy creature is going to be a mother,\" he said sadly. \"She\nhides her condition with a certain modesty, but from my window, I have\noften seen her making the dainty layette.\"\n\nThe woman had listened to him as though she did not understand. Words\nwere useless before her desperation. She could only sob as though\ntalking to herself, \"I am a German. . . . He has gone; he has to go\naway. . . . Alone! . . . Alone forever!\" . . .\n\n\"She is thinking all the time of her nationality which is separating\nher from her husband; she is thinking of the concentration camp to\nwhich they will take her with her compatriots. She is fearful of being\nabandoned in the enemy's country obliged to defend itself against the\nattack of her own country. . . . And all this when she is about to\nbecome a mother. What miseries! What agonies!\"\n\nThe three reached the rue de la Pompe and on entering the house,\nTchernoff began to take leave of his companions in order to climb the\nservice stairs; but Desnoyers wished to prolong the conversation. He\ndreaded being alone with his friend, still chagrined over the evening's\nevents. The conversation with the Russian interested him, so they all\nwent up in the elevator together. Argensola suggested that this would\nbe a good opportunity to uncork one of the many bottles which he was\nkeeping in the kitchen. Tchernoff could go home through the studio door\nthat opened on the stairway.\n\nThe great window had its glass doors wide open; the transoms on the\npatio side were also open; a breeze kept the curtains swaying, moving,\ntoo, the old lanterns, moth-eaten flags and other adornments of the\nromantic studio. They seated themselves around the table, near a window\nsome distance from the light which was illuminating the other end of\nthe big room. They were in the shadow, with their backs to the interior\ncourt. Opposite them were tiled roofs and an enormous rectangle of blue\nshadow, perforated by the sharp-pointed stars. The city lights were\ncoloring the shadowy space with a bloody reflection.\n\nTchernoff drank two glasses, testifying to the excellence of the liquid\nby smacking his lips. The three were silent with the wondering and\nthoughtful silence which the grandeur of the night imposes. Their\neyes were glancing from star to star, grouping them in fanciful lines,\nforming them into triangles or squares of varying irregularity. At\ntimes, the twinkling radiance of a heavenly body appeared to broaden the\nrays of light, almost hypnotizing them.\n\nThe Russian, without coming out of his revery, availed himself of\nanother glass. Then he smiled with cruel irony, his bearded face taking\non the semblance of a tragic mask peeping between the curtains of the\nnight.\n\n\"I wonder what those men up there are thinking!\" he muttered. \"I wonder\nif any star knows that Bismarck ever existed! . . . I wonder if the\nplanets are aware of the divine mission of the German nation!\"\n\nAnd he continued laughing.\n\nSome far-away and uncertain noise disturbed the stillness of the night,\nslipping through some of the chinks that cut the immense plain of roofs.\nThe three turned their heads so as to hear better. . . . The sound\nof voices cut through the thick silence of night--a masculine chorus\nchanting a hymn, simple, monotonous and solemn. They guessed at what it\nmust be, although they could not hear very well. Various single notes\nfloating with greater intensity on the night wind, enabled Argensola to\npiece together the short song, ending in a melodious, triumphant yell--a\ntrue war song:\n\n     C'est l'Alsace et la Lorraine,\n     C'est l'Alsace qu'il nous faut,\n     Oh, oh, oh, oh.\n\nA new band of men was going away through the streets below, toward the\nrailway station, the gateway of the war. They must be from the outlying\ndistricts, perhaps from the country, and passing through silence-wrapped\nParis, they felt like singing of the great national hope, that those who\nwere watching behind the dark facades might feel comforted, knowing that\nthey were not alone.\n\n\"Just as it is in the opera,\" said Julio listening to the last notes of\nthe invisible chorus dying away into the night.\n\nTchernoff continued drinking, but with a distracted air, his eyes fixed\non the red cloud that floated over the roofs.\n\nThe two friends conjectured his mental labor from his concentrated look,\nand the low exclamations which were escaping him like the echoes of an\ninterior monologue. Suddenly he leaped from thought to word without any\nforewarning, continuing aloud the course of his reasoning.\n\n\"And when the sun arises in a few hours, the world will see coursing\nthrough its fields the four horsemen, enemies of mankind. . . . Already\ntheir wild steeds are pawing the ground with impatience; already the\nill-omened riders have come together and are exchanging the last words\nbefore leaping into the saddle.\"\n\n\"What horsemen are these?\" asked Argensola.\n\n\"Those which go before the Beast.\"\n\nThe two friends thought this reply as unintelligible as the preceding\nwords. Desnoyers again said mentally, \"He is drunk,\" but his curiosity\nforced him to ask, \"What beast is that?\"\n\n\"That of the Apocalypse.\"\n\nThere was a brief silence, but the Russian's terseness of speech did not\nlast long. He felt the necessity of expressing his enthusiasm for the\ndreamer on the island rock of Patmos. The poet of great and mystic\nvision was exerting, across two thousand years, his influence over this\nmysterious revolutionary, tucked away on the top floor of a house in\nParis. John had foreseen it all. His visions, unintelligible to the\nmasses, nevertheless held within them the mystery of great human events.\n\nTchernoff described the Apocalyptic beast rising from the depths of the\nsea. He was like a leopard, his feet like those of a bear, his mouth\nlike the snout of a lion. He had seven heads and ten horns. And upon\nthe horns were ten crowns, and upon each of his heads the name of a\nblasphemy. The evangelist did not say just what these blasphemies were,\nperhaps they differed according to the epochs, modified every thousand\nyears when the beast made a new apparition. The Russian seemed to be\nreading those that were flaming on the heads of the monster--blasphemies\nagainst humanity, against justice, against all that makes life sweet\nand bearable. \"Might is superior to Right!\" . . . \"The weak should not\nexist.\" . . . \"Be harsh in order to be great.\" . . . And the Beast in\nall its hideousness was attempting to govern the world and make mankind\nrender him homage!\n\n\"But the four horsemen?\" persisted Desnoyers.\n\nThe four horsemen were preceding the appearance of the monster in John's\nvision.\n\nThe seven seals of the book of mystery were broken by the Lamb in the\npresence of the great throne where was seated one who shone like jasper.\nThe rainbow round about the throne was in sight like unto an emerald.\nTwenty-four thrones were in a semicircle around the great throne, and\nupon them twenty-four elders with white robes and crowns of gold. Four\nenormous animals, covered with eyes and each having six wings, seemed\nto be guarding the throne. The sounding of trumpets was greeting the\nbreaking of the first seal.\n\n\"Come and see,\" cried one of the beasts in a stentorian tone to the\nvision-seeing poet. . . . And the first horseman appeared on a white\nhorse. In his hand he carried a bow, and a crown was given unto him.\nHe was Conquest, according to some, the Plague according to others. He\nmight be both things at the same time. He wore a crown, and that was\nenough for Tchernoff.\n\n\"Come forth,\" shouted the second animal, removing his thousand eyes. And\nfrom the broken seal leaped a flame-colored steed. His rider brandished\nover his head an enormous sword. He was War. Peace fled from the world\nbefore his furious gallop; humanity was going to be exterminated.\n\nAnd when the third seal was broken, another of the winged animals\nbellowed like a thunder clap, \"Come and see!\" And John saw a black\nhorse. He who mounted it held in his hand a scale in order to weigh the\nmaintenance of mankind. He was Famine.\n\nThe fourth animal saluted the breaking of the fourth seal with a great\nroaring--\"Come and see!\" And there appeared a pale-colored horse. His\nrider was called Death, and power was given him to destroy with the\nsword and with hunger and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.\n\nThe four horsemen were beginning their mad, desolating course over the\nheads of terrified humanity.\n\nTchernoff was describing the four scourges of the earth exactly as\nthough he were seeing them. The horseman on the white horse was clad in\na showy and barbarous attire. His Oriental countenance was contracted\nwith hatred as if smelling out his victims. While his horse continued\ngalloping, he was bending his bow in order to spread pestilence\nabroad. At his back swung the brass quiver filled with poisoned arrows,\ncontaining the germs of all diseases--those of private life as well as\nthose which envenom the wounded soldier on the battlefield.\n\nThe second horseman on the red steed was waving the enormous, two-edged\nsword over his hair bristling with the swiftness of his course. He was\nyoung, but the fierce scowl and the scornful mouth gave him a look of\nimplacable ferocity. His garments, blown open by the motion of his wild\nrace, disclosed the form of a muscular athlete.\n\nBald, old and horribly skinny was the third horseman bouncing up and\ndown on the rawboned back of his black steed. His shrunken legs clanked\nagainst the thin flanks of the lean beast. In one withered hand he was\nholding the scales, symbol of the scarcity of food that was going to\nbecome as valuable as gold.\n\nThe knees of the fourth horseman, sharp as spurs, were pricking the\nribs of the pale horse. His parchment-like skin betrayed the lines and\nhollows of his skeleton. The front of his skull-like face was twisted\nwith the sardonic laugh of destruction. His cane-like arms were whirling\naloft a gigantic sickle. From his angular shoulders was hanging a\nragged, filthy shroud.\n\nAnd the furious cavalcade was passing like a hurricane over the immense\nassemblage of human beings. The heavens showed above their heads, a\nlivid, dark-edged cloud from the west. Horrible monsters and deformities\nwere swarming in spirals above the furious horde, like a repulsive\nescort. Poor Humanity, crazed with fear, was fleeing in all directions\non hearing the thundering pace of the Plague, War, Hunger and Death. Men\nand women, young and old, were knocking each other down and falling to\nthe ground overwhelmed by terror, astonishment and desperation. And the\nwhite horse, the red, the black and the pale, were crushing all with\ntheir relentless, iron tread--the athletic man was hearing the crashing\nof his broken ribs, the nursing babe was writhing at its mother's\nbreast, and the aged and feeble were closing their eyes forever with a\nchildlike sob.\n\n\"God is asleep, forgetting the world,\" continued the Russian. \"It will\nbe a long time before he awakes, and while he sleeps the four feudal\nhorsemen of the Beast will course through the land as its only lords.\"\n\nTchernoff was overpowered by the intensity of his dramatic vision.\nSpringing from his seat, he paced up and down with great strides; but\nhis picture of the fourfold catastrophe revealed by the gloomy poet's\ntrance, seemed to him very weak indeed. A great painter had given\ncorporeal form to these terrible dreams.\n\n\"I have a book,\" he murmured, \"a rare book.\" . . .\n\nAnd suddenly he left the studio and went to his own quarters. He wanted\nto bring the book to show to his friends. Argensola accompanied him, and\nthey returned in a few minutes with the volume, leaving the doors open\nbehind them, so as to make a stronger current of air among the hollows\nof the facades and the interior patio.\n\nTchernoff placed his precious book under the light. It was a volume\nprinted in 1511, with Latin text and engravings. Desnoyers read the\ntitle, \"The Apocalypse Illustrated.\" The engravings were by Albert\nDurer, a youthful effort, when the master was only twenty-seven years\nold. The three were fascinated by the picture portraying the wild career\nof the Apocalyptic horsemen. The quadruple scourge, on fantastic mounts,\nseemed to be precipitating itself with a realistic sweep, crushing\npanic-stricken humanity.\n\nSuddenly something happened which startled the three men from their\ncontemplative admiration--something unusual, indefinable, a dreadful\nsound which seemed to enter directly into their brains without passing\nthrough their ears--a clutch at the heart. Instinctively they knew that\nsomething very grave had just happened.\n\nThey stared at each other silently for a few interminable seconds.\n\nThrough the open door, a cry of alarm came up from the patio.\n\nWith a common impulse, the three ran to the interior window, but before\nreaching them, the Russian had a presentiment.\n\n\"My neighbor! . . . It must be my neighbor. Perhaps she has killed\nherself!\"\n\nLooking down, they could see lights below, people moving around a form\nstretched out on the tiled floor. The alarm had instantly filled all\nthe court windows, for it was a sleepless night--a night of nervous\napprehension when everyone was keeping a sad vigil.\n\n\"She has killed herself,\" said a voice which seemed to come up from a\nwell. \"The German woman has committed suicide.\"\n\nThe explanation of the concierge leaped from window to window up to the\ntop floor.\n\nThe Russian was shaking his head with a fatalistic expression. The\nunhappy woman had not taken the death-leap of her own accord. Someone\nhad intensified her desperation, someone had pushed her. . . . The\nhorsemen! The four horsemen of the Apocalypse! . . . Already they were\nin the saddle! Already they were beginning their merciless gallop of\ndestruction!\n\nThe blind forces of evil were about to be let loose throughout the\nworld.\n\nThe agony of humanity, under the brutal sweep of the four horsemen, was\nalready begun!\n\n\n\n\nPART II\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nWHAT DON MARCELO ENVIED\n\n\nUpon being convinced that war really was inevitable, the elder Desnoyers\nwas filled with amazement. Humanity had gone crazy. Was it possible that\nwar could happen in these days of so many railroads, so many merchant\nmarines, so many inventions, so much activity developed above and below\nthe earth? . . . The nations would ruin themselves forever. They were\nnow accustomed to luxuries and necessities unknown a century ago.\nCapital was master of the world, and war was going to wipe it out. In\nits turn, war would be wiped out in a few months' time through lack\nof funds to sustain it. His soul of a business man revolted before the\nhundreds of thousands of millions that this foolhardy event was going to\nconvert into smoke and slaughter.\n\nAs his indignation had to fix upon something close at hand, he made his\nown countrymen responsible for this insanity. Too much talk about la\nrevanche! The very idea of worrying for forty-four years over the two\nlost provinces when the nation was mistress of enormous and undeveloped\nlands in other countries! . . . Now they were going to pay the penalty\nfor such exasperating and clamorous foolishness.\n\nFor him war meant disaster writ large. He had no faith in his country.\nFrance's day had passed. Now the victors were of the Northern peoples,\nand especially that Germany which he had seen so close, admiring with a\ncertain terror its discipline and its rigorous organization. The former\nworking-man felt the conservative and selfish instinct of all those who\nhave amassed millions. He scorned political ideals, but through class\ninterest he had of late years accepted the declarations against the\nscandals of the government. What could a corrupt and disorganized\nRepublic do against the solidest and strongest empire in the\nworld? . . .\n\n\"We are going to our deaths,\" he said to himself. \"Worse than '70! . . .\nWe are going to see horrible things!\"\n\nThe good order and enthusiasm with which the French responded to their\ncountry's call and transformed themselves into soldiers were most\nastonishing to him. This moral shock made his national faith begin to\nrevive. The great majority of Frenchmen were good after all; the nation\nwas as valiant as in former times. Forty-four years of suffering and\nalarm had developed their old bravery. But the leaders? Where were they\ngoing to get leaders to march to victory? . . .\n\nMany others were asking themselves the same question. The silence of the\ndemocratic government was keeping the country in complete ignorance of\ntheir future commanders. Everybody saw the army increasing from hour to\nhour: very few knew the generals. One name was beginning to be repeated\nfrom mouth to mouth, \"Joffre . . . Joffre.\" His first pictures made the\ncurious crowds struggle to get a glimpse of them. Desnoyers studied them\nvery carefully. \"He looks like a very capable person.\" His methodical\ninstincts were gratified by the grave and confident look of the\ngeneral of the Republic. Suddenly he felt the great confidence that\nefficient-looking bank directors always inspired in him. He could\nentrust his interests to this gentleman, sure that he would not act\nimpulsively.\n\nFinally, against his will, Desnoyers was drawn into the whirlpool of\nenthusiasm and emotion. Like everyone around him, he lived minutes that\nwere hours, and hours that were years. Events kept on overlapping each\nother; within a week the world seemed to have made up for its long\nperiod of peace.\n\nThe old man fairly lived in the street, attracted by the spectacle\nof the multitude of civilians saluting the multitude of uniformed men\ndeparting for the seat of war.\n\nAt night he saw the processions passing through the boulevards. The\ntricolored flag was fluttering its colors under the electric lights. The\ncafes were overflowing with people, sending forth from doors and windows\nthe excited, musical notes of patriotic songs. Suddenly, amidst applause\nand cheers, the crowd would make an opening in the street. All Europe\nwas passing here; all Europe--less the arrogant enemy--and was saluting\nFrance in her hour of danger with hearty spontaneity. Flags of different\nnations were filing by, of all tints of the rainbow, and behind them\nwere the Russians with bright and mystical eyes; the English, with\nheads uncovered, intoning songs of religious gravity; the Greeks and\nRoumanians of aquiline profile; the Scandinavians, white and red; the\nNorth Americans, with the noisiness of a somewhat puerile enthusiasm;\nthe Hebrews without a country, friends of the nation of socialistic\nrevolutions; the Italians, as spirited as a choir of heroic tenors;\nthe Spanish and South Americans, tireless in their huzzas. They were\nstudents and apprentices who were completing their courses in the\nschools and workshops, and refugees who, like shipwrecked mariners, had\nsought shelter on the hospitable strand of Paris. Their cheers had no\nspecial significance, but they were all moved by their desire to show\ntheir love for the Republic. And Desnoyers, touched by the sight,\nfelt that France was still of some account in the world, that she yet\nexercised a moral force among the nations, and that her joys and sorrows\nwere still of interest to humanity.\n\n\"In Berlin and Vienna, too,\" he said to himself, \"they must also be\ncheering enthusiastically at this moment . . . but Germans only, no\nothers. Assuredly no foreigner is joining in their demonstrations.\"\n\nThe nation of the Revolution, legislator of the rights of mankind, was\nharvesting the gratitude of the throngs, but was beginning to feel\na certain remorse before the enthusiasm of the foreigners who were\noffering their blood for France. Many were lamenting that the government\nshould delay twenty days, until after they had finished the operations\nof mobilization, in admitting the volunteers. And he, a Frenchman born,\na few hours before, had been mistrusting his country! . . .\n\nIn the daytime the popular current was running toward the Gare de l'Est.\nCrowded against the gratings was a surging mass of humanity stretching\nits tentacles through the nearby streets. The station that was acquiring\nthe importance of a historic spot appeared like a narrow tunnel\nthrough which a great human river was trying to flow with many rippling\nencounters and much heavy pressure against its banks. A large part of\nFrance in arms was coursing through this exit from Paris toward the\nbattlefields at the frontier.\n\nDesnoyers had been in the station only twice, when going and coming from\nGermany. Others were now taking the same road. The crowds were swarming\nin from the environs of the city in order to see the masses of human\nbeings in geometric bodies, uniformly clad, disappearing within the\nentrance with flash of steel and the rhythm of clanking metal. The\ncrystal archways that were glistening in the sun like fiery mouths were\nswallowing and swallowing people. When night fell the processions were\nstill coming on, by light of the electric lamps. Through the iron grills\nwere passing thousands and thousands of draught horses; men with their\nbreasts crossed with metal and bunches of horsehair hanging from their\nhelmets, like paladins of bygone centuries; enormous cases that were\nserving as cages for the aeronautic condors; strings of cannon, long\nand narrow, painted grey and protected, by metal screens, more like\nastronomical instruments than mouths of death; masses and masses of\nred kepis (military caps) moving in marching rhythm, rows and rows of\nmuskets, some black and stark like reed plantations, others ending in\nbayonets like shining spikes. And over all these restless fields of\nseething throngs, the flags of the regiments were fluttering in the air\nlike colored birds; a white body, a blue wing, or a red one, a cravat of\ngold on the neck, and above, the metal tip pointing toward the clouds.\n\nDon Marcelo would return home from these send-offs vibrating with\nnervous fatigue, as one who had just participated in a scene of racking\nemotion. In spite of his tenacious character which always stood out\nagainst admitting a mistake, the old man began to feel ashamed of his\nformer doubts. The nation was quivering with life; France was a grand\nnation; appearances had deceived him as well as many others. Perhaps the\nmost of his countrymen were of a light and flippant character, given to\nexcessive interest in the sensuous side of life; but when danger came\nthey were fulfilling their duty simply, without the necessity of the\nharsh force to which the iron-clad organizations were submitting their\npeople.\n\nOn leaving home on the morning of the fourth day of the mobilization\nDesnoyers, instead of betaking himself to the centre of the city, went\nin the opposite direction toward the rue de la Pompe. Some imprudent\nwords dropped by Chichi, and the uneasy looks of his wife and\nsister-in-law made him suspect that Julio had returned from his trip. He\nfelt the necessity of seeing at least the outside of the studio windows,\nas if they might give him news. And in order to justify a trip so at\nvariance with his policy of ignoring his son, he remembered that the\ncarpenter lived in the same street.\n\n\"I must hunt up Robert. He promised a week ago that he would come here.\"\n\nThis Robert was a husky young fellow who, to use his own words, was\n\"emancipated from boss tyranny,\" and was working independently in his\nown home. A tiny, almost subterranean room was serving him for dwelling\nand workshop. A woman he called \"my affinity\" was looking carefully\nafter his hearth and home, with a baby boy clinging to her skirts.\nDesnoyers was accustomed to humor Robert's tirades against his fellow\ncitizens because the man had always humored his whimseys about the\nincessant rearrangement of his furniture. In the luxurious apartment in\nthe avenue Victor Hugo the carpenter would sing La Internacional while\nusing hammer and saw, and his employer would overlook his audacity of\nspeech because of the cheapness of his work.\n\nUpon arriving at the shop he found the man with cap over one ear, broad\ntrousers like a mameluke's, hobnailed boots and various pennants and\nrosettes fastened to the lapels of his jacket.\n\n\"You've come too late, Boss,\" he said cheerily. \"I am just going to\nclose the factory. The Proprietor has been mobilized, and in a few hours\nwill join his regiment.\"\n\nAnd he pointed to a written paper posted on the door of his dwelling\nlike the printed cards on all establishments, signifying that employer\nand employees had obeyed the order of mobilization.\n\nIt had never occurred to Desnoyers that his carpenter might become a\nsoldier, since he was so opposed to all kinds of authority. He hated\nthe flics, the Paris police, with whom he had, more than once, exchanged\nfisticuffs and clubbings. Militarism was his special aversion. In the\nmeetings against the despotism of the barracks he had always been one\nof the noisiest participants. And was this revolutionary fellow going to\nwar naturally and voluntarily? . . .\n\nRobert spoke enthusiastically of his regiment, of life among comrades\nwith Death but four steps away.\n\n\"I believe in my ideas, Boss, the same as before,\" he explained as\nthough guessing the other's thought. \"But war is war and teaches many\nthings--among others that Liberty must be accompanied with order\nand authority. It is necessary that someone direct that the rest may\nfollow--willingly, by common consent . . . but they must follow. When\nwar actually comes one sees things very differently from when living at\nhome doing as one pleases.\"\n\nThe night that they assassinated Jaures he howled with rage, announcing\nthat the following morning the murder would be avenged. He had hunted up\nhis associates in the district in order to inform them what retaliation\nwas being planned against the malefactors. But war was about to break\nout. There was something in the air that was opposing civil strife, that\nwas placing private grievances in momentary abeyance, concentrating all\nminds on the common weal.\n\n\"A week ago,\" he exclaimed, \"I was an anti-militarist! How far away that\nseems now--as if a year had gone by! I keep thinking as before! I\nlove peace and hate war like all my comrades. But the French have not\noffended anybody, and yet they threaten us, wishing to enslave us. . . .\nBut we French can be fierce, since they oblige us to be, and in order\nto defend ourselves it is just that nobody should shirk, that all should\nobey. Discipline does not quarrel with Revolution. Remember the armies\nof the first Republic--all citizens, Generals as well as soldiers, but\nHoche, Kleber and the others were rough-hewn, unpolished benefactors who\nknew how to command and exact obedience.\"\n\nThe carpenter was well read. Besides the papers and pamphlets of \"the\nIdea,\" he had also read on stray sheets the views of Michelet and other\nliberal actors on the stage of history.\n\n\"We are going to make war on War,\" he added. \"We are going to fight so\nthat this war will be the last.\"\n\nThis statement did not seem to be expressed with sufficient clearness,\nso he recast his thought.\n\n\"We are going to fight for the future; we are going to die in order\nthat our grandchildren may not have to endure a similar calamity. If\nthe enemy triumphs, the war-habit will triumph, and conquest will be the\nonly means of growth. First they will overcome Europe, then the rest of\nthe world. Later on, those who have been pillaged will rise up in their\nwrath. More wars! . . . We do not want conquests. We desire to regain\nAlsace and Lorraine, for their inhabitants wish to return to us . . .\nand nothing more. We shall not imitate the enemy, appropriating\nterritory and jeopardizing the peace of the world. We had enough of that\nwith Napoleon; we must not repeat that experience. We are going to fight\nfor our immediate security, and at the same time for the security of\nthe world--for the life of the weaker nations. If this were a war\nof aggression, of mere vanity, of conquest, then we Socialists would\nbethink ourselves of our anti-militarism. But this is self-defense, and\nthe government has not been at fault. Since we are attacked, we must be\nunited in our defensive.\"\n\nThe carpenter, who was also anti-clerical, was now showing a more\ngenerous tolerance, an amplitude of ideas that embraced all mankind. The\nday before he had met at the administration office a Reservist who was\njust leaving to join his regiment. At a glance he saw that this man was\na priest.\n\n\"I am a carpenter,\" he had said to him, by way of introduction, \"and\nyou, comrade, are working in the churches?\"\n\nHe employed this figure of speech in order that the priest might not\nsuspect him of anything offensive. The two had clasped hands.\n\n\"I do not take much stock in the clerical cowl,\" Robert explained\nto Desnoyers. \"For some time I have not been on friendly terms with\nreligion. But in every walk of life there must be good people, and the\ngood people ought to understand each other in a crisis like this. Don't\nyou think so, Boss?\"\n\nThe war coincided with his socialistic tendencies. Before this,\nwhen speaking of future revolution, he had felt a malign pleasure in\nimagining all the rich deprived of their fortunes and having to work in\norder to exist. Now he was equally enthusiastic at the thought that all\nFrenchmen would share the same fate without class distinction.\n\n\"All with knapsacks on their backs and eating at mess.\"\n\nAnd he was even extending this military sobriety to those who remained\nbehind the army. War was going to cause great scarcity of provisions,\nand all would have to come down to very plain fare.\n\n\"You, too, Boss, who are too old to go to war--you, with all your\nmillions, will have to eat the same as I. . . . Admit that it is a\nbeautiful thing.\"\n\nDesnoyers was not offended by the malicious satisfaction that his future\nprivations seemed to inspire in the carpenter. He was very thoughtful.\nA man of his stamp, an enemy of existing conditions, who had no property\nto defend, was going to war--to death, perhaps--because of a generous\nand distant ideal, in order that future generations might never know\nthe actual horrors of war! To do this, he was not hesitating at the\nsacrifice of his former cherished beliefs, all that he had held sacred\ntill now. . . . And he who belonged to the privileged class, who\npossessed so many tempting things, requiring defense, had given himself\nup to doubt and criticism! . . .\n\nHours after, he again saw the carpenter, near the Arc de Triomphe. He\nwas one of a group of workmen looking much as he did, and this group\nwas joining others and still others that represented every social\nclass--well-dressed citizens, stylish and anaemic young men, graduate\nstudents with worn jackets, pale faces and thick glasses, and youthful\npriests who were smiling rather shamefacedly as though they had been\ncaught at some ridiculous escapade. At the head of this human herd was\na sergeant, and as a rear guard, various soldiers with guns on their\nshoulders. Forward march, Reservists! . . .\n\nAnd a musical cry, a solemn harmony like a Greek chant, menacing and\nmonotonous, surged up from this mass with open mouths, swinging arms,\nand legs that were opening and shutting like compasses.\n\nRobert was singing the martial chorus with such great\n\nenergy that his eyes and Gallic moustachios were fairly trembling. In\nspite of his corduroy suit and his bulging linen hand bag, he had\nthe same grand and heroic aspect as the figures by Rude in the Arc de\nTriomphe. The \"affinity\" and the boy were trudging along the sidewalk so\nas to accompany him to the station. For a moment he took his eyes from\nthem to speak with a companion in the line, shaven and serious-looking,\nundoubtedly the priest whom he had met the day before. Now they were\ntalking confidentially, intimately, with that brotherliness which\ncontact with death inspires in mankind.\n\nThe millionaire followed the carpenter with a look of respect,\nimmeasurably increased since he had taken his part in this human\navalanche. And this respect had in it something of envy, the envy that\nsprings from an uneasy conscience.\n\nWhenever Don Marcelo passed a bad night, suffering from nightmare, a\ncertain terrible thing--always the same--would torment his imagination.\nRarely did he dream of mortal peril to his family or self. The frightful\nvision was always that certain notes bearing his signature were\npresented for collection which he, Marcelo Desnoyers, the man always\nfaithful to his bond, with a past of immaculate probity, was not able\nto pay. Such a possibility made him tremble, and long after waking his\nheart would be oppressed with terror. To his imagination this was the\ngreatest disgrace that a man could suffer.\n\nNow that war was overturning his existence with its agitations, the\nsame agonies were reappearing. Completely awake, with full powers of\nreasoning, he was suffering exactly the same distress as when in his\nhorrible dreams he saw his dishonored signature on a protested document.\n\nAll his past was looming up before his eyes with such extraordinary\nclearness that it seemed as though until then his mind must have been\nin hopeless confusion. The threatened land of France was his native\ncountry. Fifteen centuries of history had been working for him, in\norder that his opening eyes might survey progress and comforts that his\nancestors did not even know. Many generations of Desnoyers had prepared\nfor his advent into life by struggling with the land and defending it\nthat he might be born into a free family and fireside. . . . And when\nhis turn had come for continuing this effort, when his time had arrived\nin the rosary of generations--he had fled like a debtor evading payment!\n. . . On coming into his fatherland he had contracted obligations with\nthe human group to whom he owed his existence. This obligation should be\npaid with his arms, with any sacrifice that would repel danger . . . and\nhe had eluded the acknowledgment of his signature, fleeing his country\nand betraying his trust to his forefathers! Ah, miserable coward! The\nmaterial success of his life, the riches acquired in a remote country,\nwere comparatively of no importance. There are failures that millions\ncannot blot out. The uneasiness of his conscience was proving it now.\nProof, too, was in the envy and respect inspired by this poor mechanic\nmarching to meet his death with others equally humble, all kindled with\nthe satisfaction of duty fulfilled, of sacrifice accepted.\n\nThe memory of Madariaga came to his memory.\n\n\"Where we make our riches, and found a family--there is our country.\"\n\nNo, the statement of the centaur was not correct. In normal times,\nperhaps. Far from one's native land when it is not exposed to danger,\none may forget it for a few years. But he was living now in France, and\nFrance was being obliged to defend herself against enemies wishing to\noverpower her. The sight of all her people rising en masse was becoming\nan increasingly shameful torture for Desnoyers, making him think all the\ntime of what he should have done in his youth, of what he had dodged.\n\nThe veterans of '70 were passing through the streets, with the green and\nblack ribbon in their lapel, souvenirs of the privations of the Siege of\nParis, and of heroic and disastrous campaigns. The sight of these men,\nsatisfied with their past, made him turn pale. Nobody was recalling his,\nbut he knew it, and that was enough. In vain his reason would try to\nlull this interior tempest. . . . Those times were different; then\nthere was none of the present unanimity; the Empire was unpopular . . .\neverything was lost. . . . But the recollection of a celebrated sentence\nwas fixing itself in his mind as an obsession--\"France still remained!\"\nMany had thought as he did in his youth, but they had not, therefore,\nevaded military service. They had stood by their country in a last and\ndesperate resistance.\n\nUseless was his excuse-making reasoning. Nobler thoughts showed him the\nfallacy of this beating around the bush. Explanations and demonstrations\nare unnecessary to the understanding of patriotic and religious ideals;\ntrue patriotism does not need them. One's country . . . is one's\ncountry. And the laboring man, skeptical and jesting, the self-centred\nfarmer, the solitary pastor, all had sprung to action at the sound\nof this conjuring word, comprehending it instantly, without previous\ninstruction.\n\n\"It is necessary to pay,\" Don Marcelo kept repeating mentally. \"I ought\nto pay my debt.\"\n\nAs in his dreams, he was constantly feeling the anguish of an upright\nand desperate man who wishes to meet his obligations.\n\nPay! . . . and how? It was now very late. For a moment the heroic\nresolution came into his head of offering himself as a volunteer, of\nmarching with his bag at his side in some one of the groups of future\ncombatants, the same as the carpenter. But the uselessness of the\nsacrifice came immediately into his mind. Of what use would it be?\n. . . He looked robust and was well-preserved for his age, but he was\nover seventy, and only the young make good soldiers. Combat is but\none incident in the struggle. Equally necessary are the hardship\nand self-denial in the form of interminable marches, extremes of\ntemperature, nights in the open air, shoveling earth, digging trenches,\nloading carts, suffering hunger. . . . No; it was too late. He could not\neven leave an illustrious name that might serve as an example.\n\nInstinctively he glanced behind. He was not alone in the world; he had a\nson who could assume his father's debt . . . but that hope only lasted\na minute. His son was not French; he belonged to another people; half\nof his blood was from another source. Besides, how could the boy be\nexpected to feel as he did? Would he even understand if his father\nshould explain it to him? . . . It was useless to expect anything from\nthis lady-killing, dancing clown, from this fellow of senseless bravado,\nwho was constantly exposing his life in duels in order to satisfy a\nsilly sense of honor.\n\nOh, the meekness of the bluff Senor Desnoyers after these reflections!\n. . . His family felt alarmed at seeing the humility and gentleness with\nwhich he moved around the house. The two men-servants had gone to\njoin their regiments, and to them the most surprising result of\nthe declaration of war was the sudden kindness of their master, the\nlavishness of his farewell gifts, the paternal care with which he\nsupervised their preparations for departure. The terrible Don Marcelo\nembraced them with moist eyes, and the two had to exert themselves to\nprevent his accompanying them to the station.\n\nOutside of his home he was slipping about humbly as though mutely asking\npardon of the many people around him. To him they all appeared his\nsuperiors. It was a period of economic crisis; for the time being, the\nrich also were experiencing what it was to be poor and worried; the\nbanks had suspended operations and were paying only a small part of\ntheir deposits. For some weeks the millionaire was deprived of his\nwealth, and felt restless before the uncertain future. How long would it\nbe before they could send him money from South America? Was war going to\ntake away fortunes as well as lives? . . . And yet Desnoyers had never\nappreciated money less, nor disposed of it with greater generosity.\n\nNumberless mobilized men of the lower classes who were going alone\ntoward the station met a gentleman who would timidly stop them, put\nhis hand in his pocket and leave in their right hand a bill of\ntwenty francs, fleeing immediately before their astonished eyes. The\nworking-women who were returning weeping from saying good-bye to their\nhusbands saw this same gentleman smiling at the children who were with\nthem, patting their cheeks and hastening away, leaving a five-franc\npiece in their hands.\n\nDon Marcelo, who had never smoked, was now frequenting the tobacco\nshops, coming out with hands and pockets filled in order that he might,\nwith lavish generosity, press the packages upon the first soldier he\nmet. At times the recipient, smiling courteously, would thank him with a\nfew words, revealing his superior breeding--afterwards passing the gift\non to others clad in cloaks as coarse and badly cut as his own. The\nmobilization, universally obligatory, often caused him to make these\nmistakes.\n\nThe rough hands pressing his with a grateful clasp, left him satisfied\nfor a few moments. Ah, if he could only do more! . . . The Government\nin mobilizing its vehicles had appropriated three of his monumental\nautomobiles, and Desnoyers felt very sorry that they were not also\ntaking the fourth mastodon. Of what use were they to him? The shepherds\nof this monstrous herd, the chauffeur and his assistants, were now in\nthe army. Everybody was marching away. Finally he and his son would be\nthe only ones left--two useless creatures.\n\nHe roared with wrath on learning of the enemy's entrance into Belgium,\nconsidering this the most unheard-of treason in history. He suffered\nagonies of shame at remembering that at first he had held the exalted\npatriots of his country responsible for the war. . . . What perfidy,\nmethodically carried out after long years of preparation! The accounts\nof the sackings, fires and butcheries made him turn pale and gnash his\nteeth. To him, to Marcelo Desnoyers, might happen the very same thing\nthat Belgium was enduring, if the barbarians should invade France. He\nhad a home in the city, a castle in the country, and a family. Through\nassociation of ideas, the women assaulted by the soldiery, made him\nthink of Chichi and the dear Dona Luisa. The mansions in flames called\nto his mind the rare and costly furnishings accumulated in his expensive\ndwellings--the armorial bearings of his social elevation. The old folk\nthat were shot, the women foully mutilated, the children with their\nhands cut off, all the horrors of a war of terror, aroused the violence\nof his character.\n\nAnd such things could happen with impunity in this day and\ngeneration! . . .\n\nIn order to convince himself that punishment was near, that vengeance\nwas overtaking the guilty ones, he felt the necessity of mingling daily\nwith the people crowding around the Gare de l'Est.\n\nAlthough the greater part of the troops were operating on the frontiers,\nthat was not diminishing the activity in Paris. Entire battalions were\nno longer going off, but day and night soldiers were coming to the\nstation singly or in groups. These were Reserves without uniform on\ntheir way to enroll themselves with their companies, officials who until\nthen had been busy with the work of the mobilization, platoons in arms\ndestined to fill the great gaps opened by death.\n\nThe multitude, pressed against the railing, was greeting those who were\ngoing off, following them with their eyes while they were crossing the\nlarge square. The latest editions of the daily papers were announced\nwith hoarse yells, and instantly the dark throng would be spotted with\nwhite, all reading with avidity the printed sheets. Good news: \"Vive\nla France!\" A doubtful despatch, foreshadowing calamity: \"No matter! We\nmust press on at all costs! The Russians will close in behind them!\" And\nwhile these dialogues, inspired by the latest news were taking place,\nmany young girls were going among the groups offering little flags and\ntricolored cockades--and passing through the patio, men and still more\nmen were disappearing behind the glass doors, on their way to the war.\n\nA sub-lieutenant of the Reserves, with his bag on his shoulder, was\naccompanied by his father toward the file of policemen keeping the\ncrowds back. Desnoyers saw in the young officer a certain resemblance to\nhis son. The father was wearing in his lapel the black and green ribbon\nof 1870--a decoration which always filled Desnoyers with remorse. He was\ntall and gaunt, but was still trying to hold himself erect, with a heavy\nfrown. He wanted to show himself fierce, inhuman, in order to hide his\nemotion.\n\n\"Good-bye, my boy! Do your best.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, father.\"\n\nThey did not clasp hands, and each was avoiding looking at the other.\nThe official was smiling like an automaton. The father turned his back\nbrusquely, and threading his way through the throng, entered a cafe,\nwhere for some time he needed the most retired seat in the darkest\nearner to hide his emotion.\n\nAND DON MARCELO ENVIED HIS GRIEF.\n\nSome of the Reservists came along singing, preceded by a flag. They were\njoking and jostling each other, betraying in excited actions, long halts\nat all the taverns along the way. One of them, without interrupting\nhis song, was pressing the hand of an old woman marching beside him,\ncheerful and dry-eyed. The mother was concentrating all her strength in\norder, with feigned happiness, to accompany this strapping lad to the\nlast minute.\n\nOthers were coming along singly, separated from their companies, but not\non that account alone. The gun was hanging from the shoulder, the back\noverlaid by the hump of the knapsack, the red legs shooting in and out\nof the turned-back folds of the blue cloak, and the smoke of a pipe\nunder the visor of the kepis. In front of one of these men, four\nchildren were walking along, lined up according to size. They kept\nturning their heads to admire their father, suddenly glorified by his\nmilitary trappings. At his side was marching his wife, affable and\nresigned, feeling in her simple soul a revival of love, an ephemeral\nSpring, born of the contact with danger. The man, a laborer of Paris,\nwho a few months before was singing La Internacional, demanding the\nabolishment of armies and the brotherhood of all mankind, was now going\nin quest of death. His wife, choking back her sobs, was admiring him\ngreatly. Affection and commiseration made her insist upon giving him a\nfew last counsels. In his knapsack she had put his best handkerchiefs,\nthe few provisions in the house and all the money. Her man was not to be\nuneasy about her and the children; they would get along all right. The\ngovernment and kind neighbors would look after them.\n\nThe soldier in reply was jesting over the somewhat misshapen figure of\nhis wife, saluting the coming citizen, and prophesying that he would\nbe born in a time of great victory. A kiss to the wife, an affectionate\nhair-pull for his offspring, and then he had joined his comrades. . . .\nNo tears. Courage! . . . Vive la France!\n\nThe final injunctions of the departing were now heard. Nobody was\ncrying. But as the last red pantaloons disappeared, many hands grasped\nthe iron railing convulsively, many handkerchiefs were bitten with\ngnashing teeth, many faces were hidden in the arms with sobs of anguish.\n\nAND DON MARCELO ENVIED THESE TEARS.\n\nThe old woman, on losing the warm contact of her son's hand from her\nwithered one, turned in the direction which she believed to be that of\nthe hostile country, waving her arms with threatening fury.\n\n\"Ah, the assassin! . . . the bandit!\"\n\nIn her wrathful imagination she was again seeing the countenance so\noften displayed in the illustrated pages of the periodicals--moustaches\ninsolently aggressive, a mouth with the jaw and teeth of a wolf, that\nlaughed . . . and laughed as men must have laughed in the time of the\ncave-men.\n\nAND DON MARCELO ENVIED THIS WRATH!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nNEW LIFE\n\n\nWhen Marguerite was able to return to the studio in the rue de la Pompe,\nJulio, who had been living in a perpetual bad humor, seeing everything\nin the blackest colors, suddenly felt a return of his old optimism.\n\nThe war was not going to be so cruel as they all had at first imagined.\nThe days had passed by, and the movements of the troops were beginning\nto be less noticeable. As the number of men diminished in the streets,\nthe feminine population seemed to have increased. Although there was\ngreat scarcity of money, the banks still remaining closed, the necessity\nfor it was increasingly great, in order to secure provisions. Memories\nof the famine of the siege of '70 tormented the imagination. Since war\nhad broken out with the same enemy, it seemed but logical to everybody\nto expect a repetition of the same happenings. The storehouses were\nbesieged by women who were securing stale food at exorbitant prices\nin order to store it in their homes. Future hunger was producing more\nterror than immediate dangers.\n\nFor young Desnoyers these were about all the transformations that war\nwas creating around him. People would finally become accustomed to the\nnew existence. Humanity has a certain reserve force of adaptation which\nenables it to mould itself to circumstances and continue existing. He\nwas hoping to continue his life as though nothing had happened. It was\nenough for him that Marguerite should continue faithful to their\npast. Together they would see events slipping by them with the cruel\nluxuriousness of those who, from an inaccessible height, contemplate a\nflood without the slightest risk to themselves.\n\nThis selfish attitude had also become habitual to Argensola.\n\n\"Let us be neutral,\" the Bohemian would say. \"Neutrality does not\nnecessarily mean indifference. Let us enjoy the great spectacle, since\nnothing like it will ever happen again in our lifetime.\"\n\nIt was unfortunate that war should happen to come when they had so\nlittle money. Argensola was hating the banks even more than the Central\nPowers, distinguishing with special antipathy the trust company which\nwas delaying payment of Julio's check. How lovely it would have been\nwith this sum available, to have forestalled events by laying in every\nclass of commodity! In order to supplement the domestic scrimping,\nhe again had to solicit the aid of Dona Luisa. War had lessened Don\nMarcelo's precautions, and the family was now living in generous\nunconcern. The mother, like other house mistresses, had stored up\nprovisions for months and months to come, buying whatever eatables she\nwas able to lay hands on. Argensola took advantage of this abundance,\nrepeating his visits to the home in the avenue Victor Hugo, descending\nits service stairway with great packages which were swelling the\nsupplies in the studio.\n\nHe felt all the joys of a good housekeeper in surveying the treasures\npiled up in the kitchen--great tins of canned meat, pyramids of butter\ncrocks, and bags of dried vegetables. He had accumulated enough there to\nmaintain a large family. The war had now offered a new pretext for him\nto visit Don Marcelo's wine-vaults.\n\n\"Let them come!\" he would say with a heroic gesture as he took stock\nof his treasure trove. \"Let them come when they will! We are ready for\nthem!\"\n\nThe care and increase of his provisions, and the investigation of news\nwere the two functions of his existence. It seemed necessary to procure\nten, twelve, fifteen papers a day; some because they were reactionary,\nand the novelty of seeing all the French united filled him with\nenthusiasm; others because they were radical and must be better informed\nof the news received from the government. They generally appeared at\nmidday, at three, at four and at five in the afternoon. An half hour's\ndelay in the publication of the sheet raised great hopes in the public,\non the qui vive for stupendous news. All the last supplements were\nsnatched up; everybody had his pockets stuffed with papers, waiting\nanxiously the issue of extras in order to buy them, too. Yet all the\nsheets were saying approximately the same thing.\n\nArgensola was developing a credulous, enthusiastic soul, capable of\nadmitting many improbable things. He presumed that this same spirit\nwas probably animating everybody around him. At times, his old critical\nattitude would threaten to rebel, but doubt was repulsed as something\ndishonorable. He was living in a new world, and it was but natural that\nextraordinary things should occur that could be neither measured nor\nexplained by the old processes of reasoning. So he commented with\ninfantile joy on the marvellous accounts in the daily papers--of combats\nbetween a single Belgian platoon and entire regiments of enemies,\nputting them to disorderly flight; of the German fear of the bayonet\nthat made them run like hares the instant that the charge sounded; of\nthe inefficiency of the German artillery whose projectiles always missed\nfire.\n\nIt was logical and natural that little Belgium should conquer gigantic\nGermany--a repetition of David and Goliath--with all the metaphors and\nimages that this unequal contest had inspired across so many centuries.\nLike the greater part of the nation, he had the mentality of a reader\nof tales of chivalry who feels himself defrauded if the hero,\nsingle-handed, fails to cleave a thousand enemies with one fell stroke.\nHe purposely chose the most sensational papers, those which published\nmany stories of single encounters, of individual deeds about which\nnobody could know with any degree of certainty.\n\nThe intervention of England on the seas made him imagine a frightful\nfamine, coming providentially like a thunder-clap to torture the enemy.\nHe honestly believed that ten days of this maritime blockade would\nconvert Germany into a group of shipwrecked sailors floating on a raft.\nThis vision made him repeat his visits to the kitchen to gloat over his\npackages of provisions.\n\n\"Ah, what they would give in Berlin for my treasures!\" . . .\n\nNever had Argensola eaten with greater avidity. Consideration of the\ngreat privations suffered by the adversary was sharpening his appetite\nto a monstrous capacity. White bread, golden brown and crusty, was\nstimulating him to an almost religious ecstasy.\n\n\"If friend William could only get his claws on this!\" he would chuckle\nto his companion.\n\nSo he chewed and swallowed with increasing relish; solids and liquids on\npassing through his mouth seemed to be acquiring a new flavor, rare\nand divine. Distant hunger for him was a stimulant, a sauce of endless\ndelight.\n\nWhile France was inspiring his enthusiasm, he was conceding greater\ncredit to Russia. \"Ah, those Cossacks!\" . . . He was accustomed to speak\nof them as intimate friends. He loved to describe the unbridled gallop\nof the wild horsemen, impalpable as phantoms, and so terrible in their\nwrath that the enemy could not look them in the face. The concierge and\nthe stay-at-homes used to listen to him with all the respect due to a\nforeign gentleman, knowing much of the great outside world with which\nthey were not familiar.\n\n\"The Cossacks will adjust the accounts of these bandits!\" he would\nconclude with absolute assurance. \"Within a month they will have entered\nBerlin.\"\n\nAnd his public composed of women--wives and mothers of those who had\ngone to war--would modestly agree with him, with that irresistible\ndesire which we all feel of placing our hopes on something distant and\nmysterious. The French would defend the country, reconquering, besides\nthe lost territories, but the Cossacks--of whom so many were speaking\nbut so few had seen--were going to give the death blow. The only\nperson who knew them at first hand was Tchernoff, and to Argensola's\nastonishment, he listened to his words without showing any enthusiasm.\nThe Cossacks were for him simply one body of the Russian army--good\nenough soldiers, but incapable of working the miracles that everybody\nwas expecting from them.\n\n\"That Tchernoff!\" exclaimed Argensola. \"Since he hates the Czar, he\nthinks the entire country mad. He is a revolutionary fanatic. . . . And\nI am opposed to all fanaticisms.\"\n\nJulio was listening absent-mindedly to the news brought by his\ncompanion, the vibrating statements recited in declamatory tones, the\nplans of the campaign traced out on an enormous map fastened to the wall\nof the studio and bristling with tiny flags that marked the camps of the\nbelligerent armies. Every issue of the papers obliged the Spaniard to\narrange a new dance of the pins on the map, followed by his comments of\nbomb-proof optimism.\n\n\"We have entered into Alsace; very good! . . . It appears now that we\nabandon Alsace. Splendid! I suspect the cause. It is in order to enter\nagain in a better place, getting at the enemy from behind. . . . They\nsay that Liege has fallen. What a lie! . . . And if it does fall, it\ndoesn't matter. Just an incident, nothing more! The others remain . . .\nthe others! . . . that are advancing on the Eastern side, and are going\nto enter Berlin.\"\n\nThe news from the Russian front was his favorite, but obliged him to\nremain in suspense every time that he tried to find on the map the\nobscure names of the places where the admired Cossacks were exhibiting\ntheir wonderful exploits.\n\nMeanwhile Julio was continuing the course of his own reflections.\nMarguerite! . . . She had come back at last, and yet each time seemed to\nbe drifting further away from him. . . .\n\nIn the first days of the mobilization, he had haunted her neighborhood,\ntrying to appease his longing by this illusory proximity. Marguerite\nhad written to him, urging patience. How fortunate it was that he was a\nforeigner and would not have to endure the hardship of war! Her brother,\nan officer in the artillery Reserves, was going at almost any minute.\nHer mother, who made her home with this bachelor son, had kept an\nastonishing serenity up to the last minute, although she had wept much\nwhile the war was still but a possibility. She herself had prepared the\nsoldier's outfit so that the small valise might contain all that was\nindispensable for campaign life. But Marguerite had divined her poor\nmother's secret struggles not to reveal her despair, in moist eyes and\ntrembling hands. It was impossible to leave her alone at such a time.\n. . . Then had come the farewell. \"God be with you, my son! Do your duty,\nbut be prudent.\" Not a tear nor a sign of weakness. All her family had\nadvised her not to accompany her son to the railway station, so his\nsister had gone with him. And upon returning home, Marguerite had found\nher mother rigid in her arm chair, with a set face, avoiding all mention\nof her son, speaking of the friends who also had sent their boys to the\nwar, as if they only could comprehend her torture. \"Poor Mama! I ought\nto be with her now more than ever. . . . To-morrow, if I can, I shall\ncome to see you.\"\n\nWhen at last she returned to the rue de la Pompe, her first care was to\nexplain to Julio the conservatism of her tailored suit, the absence of\njewels in the adornment of her person. \"The war, my dear! Now it is the\nchic thing to adapt oneself to the depressing conditions, to be frugal\nand inconspicuous like soldiers. Who knows what we may expect!\" Her\ninfatuation with dress still accompanied her in every moment of her\nlife.\n\nJulio noticed a persistent absent-mindedness about her. It seemed\nas though her spirit, abandoning her body, was wandering to far-away\nplaces. Her eyes were looking at him, but she seldom saw him. She would\nspeak very slowly, as though wishing to weigh every word, fearful of\nbetraying some secret. This spiritual alienation did not, however,\nprevent her slipping bodily along the smooth path of custom, although\nafterwards she would seem to feel a vague remorse. \"I wonder if it is\nright to do this! . . . Is it not wrong to live like this when so many\nsorrows are falling on the world?\" Julio hushed her scruples with:\n\n\"But if we are going to marry as soon as possible! . . . If we are\nalready the same as husband and wife!\"\n\nShe replied with a gesture of strangeness and dismay. To marry! . . .\nTen days ago she had had no other wish. Now the possibility of marriage\nwas recurring less and less in her thoughts. Why think about such remote\nand uncertain events? More immediate things were occupying her mind.\n\nThe farewell to her brother in the station was a scene which had fixed\nitself ineradicably in her memory. Upon going to the studio she had\nplanned not to speak about it, foreseeing that she might annoy her lover\nwith this account; but alas, she had only to vow not to mention a thing,\nto feel an irresistible impulse to talk about it.\n\nShe had never suspected that she could love her brother so dearly. Her\nformer affection for him had been mingled with a silent sentiment of\njealousy because her mother had preferred the older child. Besides,\nhe was the one who had introduced Laurier to his home; the two held\ndiplomas as industrial engineers and had been close friends from their\nschool days. . . . But upon seeing the boy ready to depart, Marguerite\nsuddenly discovered that this brother, who had always been of\nsecondary interest to her, was now occupying a pre-eminent place in her\naffections.\n\n\"He was so handsome, so interesting in his lieutenant's uniform! . . .\nHe looked like another person. I will admit to you that I was very proud\nto walk beside him, leaning on his arm. People thought that we were\nmarried. Seeing me weep, some poor women tried to console me saying,\n'Courage, Madame. . . . Your man will come back.' He just laughed at\nhearing these mistakes. The only thing that was really saddening him was\nthinking about our mother.\"\n\nThey had separated at the door of the station. The sentries would not\nlet her go any further, so she had handed over his sword that she had\nwished to carry till the last moment.\n\n\"It is lovely to be a man!\" she exclaimed enthusiastically. \"I would\nlove to wear a uniform, to go to war, to be of some real use!\"\n\nShe tried not to say more about it, as though she suddenly realized\nthe inopportuneness of her last words. Perhaps she noticed the scowl on\nJulio's face.\n\nShe was, however, so wrought up by the memory of that farewell that,\nafter a long pause, she was unable to resist the temptation of again\nputting her thought into words.\n\nAt the station entrance, while she was kissing her brother for the last\ntime, she had an encounter, a great surprise. \"He\" had approached, also\nclad as an artillery officer, but alone, having to entrust his valise to\na good-natured man from the crowd.\n\nJulio shot her a questioning look. Who was \"he\"? He suspected, but\nfeigned ignorance, as though fearing to learn the truth.\n\n\"Laurier,\" she replied laconically, \"my former husband.\"\n\nThe lover displayed a cruel irony. It was a cowardly thing to ridicule\nthis man who had responded to the call of duty. He recognized his\nvileness, but a malign and irresistible instinct made him keep on with\nhis sneers in order to discredit the man before Marguerite. Laurier a\nsoldier!--He must cut a pretty figure dressed in uniform!\n\n\"Laurier, the warrior!\" he continued in a voice so sarcastic and strange\nthat it seemed to be coming from somebody else. . . . \"Poor creature!\"\n\nShe hesitated in her response, not wishing to exasperate Desnoyers any\nfurther. But the truth was uppermost in her mind, and she said simply:\n\n\"No . . . no, he didn't look so bad. Quite the contrary. Perhaps it was\nthe uniform, perhaps it was his sadness at going away alone, completely\nalone, without a single hand to clasp his. I didn't recognize him at\nfirst. Seeing my brother, he started toward us; but then when he saw me,\nhe went his own way . . . Poor man! I feel sorry for him!\"\n\nHer feminine instinct must have told her that she was talking too much,\nand she cut her chatter suddenly short. The same instinct warned her\nthat Julio's countenance was growing more and more saturnine, and his\nmouth taking a very bitter curve. She wanted to console him and added:\n\n\"What luck that you are a foreigner and will not have to go to the war!\nHow horrible it would be for me to lose you!\" . . .\n\nShe said it sincerely. . . . A few moments before she had been envying\nmen, admiring the gallantry with which they were exposing their lives,\nand now she was trembling before the idea that her lover might have been\none of these.\n\nThis did not please his amorous egoism--to be placed apart from the\nrest as a delicate and fragile being only fit for feminine adoration. He\npreferred to inspire the envy that she had felt on beholding her brother\ndecked out in his warlike accoutrement. It seemed to him that something\nwas coming between him and Marguerite that would never disappear, that\nwould go on expanding, repelling them in contrary directions . . . far\n. . . very far, even to the point of not recognizing each other when\ntheir glances met.\n\nHe continued to be conscious of this impalpable obstacle in their\nfollowing interviews. Marguerite was extremely affectionate in her\nspeech, and would look at him with moist and loving eyes. But her\ncaressing hands appeared more like those of a mother than a lover, and\nher tenderness was accompanied with a certain disinterestedness and\nextraordinary modesty. She seemed to prefer remaining obstinately in the\nstudio, declining to go into the other rooms.\n\n\"We are so comfortable here. . . . I would rather not. . . . It is not\nworth while. I should feel remorse afterwards. . . . Why think of such\nthings in these anxious times!\"\n\nThe world around her seemed saturated with love, but it was a new\nlove--a love for the man who is suffering, desire for abnegation, for\nsacrifice. This love called forth visions of white caps, of tremulous\nhands healing shell-riddled and bleeding flesh.\n\nEvery advance on Julio's part but aroused in Marguerite a vehement and\nmodest protest as though they were meeting for the first time.\n\n\"It is impossible,\" she protested. \"I keep thinking of my brother, and\nof so many that I know that may be dying at this very minute.\"\n\nNews of battles were beginning to arrive, and blood was beginning to\nflow in great quantities.\n\n\"No, no, I cannot,\" she kept repeating.\n\nAnd when Julio finally triumphed, he found that her thoughts were still\nfollowing independently the same line of mental stress.\n\nOne afternoon, Marguerite announced that henceforth she would see him\nless frequently. She was attending classes now, and had only two free\ndays.\n\nDesnoyers listened, dumbfounded. Classes? . . . What were her\nstudies? . . .\n\nShe seemed a little irritated at his mocking expression. . . . Yes, she\nwas studying; for the past week she had been attending classes. Now the\nlessons were going to be more regular; the course of instruction had\nbeen fully organized, and there were many more instructors.\n\n\"I wish to be a trained nurse. I am distressed over my uselessness.\n. . . Of what good have I ever been till now?\" . . .\n\nShe was silent for a few moments as though reviewing her past.\n\n\"At times I almost think,\" she mused, \"that war, with all its horrors,\nstill has some good in it. It helps to make us useful to our fellowmen.\nWe look at life more seriously; trouble makes us realize that we have\ncome into the world for some purpose. . . . I believe that we must not\nlove life only for the pleasures that it brings us. We ought to find\nsatisfaction in sacrifice, in dedicating ourselves to others, and this\nsatisfaction--I don't know just why, perhaps because it is new--appears\nto me superior to all other things.\"\n\nJulio looked at her in surprise, trying to imagine what was going on in\nthat idolized and frivolous head. What ideas were forming back of that\nthoughtful forehead which until then had merely reflected the slightest\nshadow of thoughts as swift and flitting as birds? . . .\n\nBut the former Marguerite was still alive. He saw her constantly\nreappearing in a funny way among the sombre preoccupations with which\nwar was overshadowing all lives.\n\n\"We have to study very hard in order to earn our diplomas as nurses.\nHave you noticed our uniform? . . . It is most distinctive, and the\nwhite is so becoming both to blondes and brunettes. Then the cap which\nallows little curls over the ears--the fashionable coiffure--and the\nblue cape over the white suit, make a splendid contrast. With this\noutfit, a woman well shod, and with few jewels, may present a truly\nchic appearance. It is a mixture of nun and great lady which is vastly\nbecoming.\"\n\nShe was going to study with a regular fury in order to become really\nuseful . . . and sooner to wear the admired uniform.\n\nPoor Desnoyers! . . . The longing to see her, and the lack of occupation\nin these interminable afternoons which hitherto had been employed so\ndelightfully, compelled him to haunt the neighborhood of the unoccupied\npalace where the government had just established the training school for\nnurses. Stationing himself at the corner, watching the fluttering skirts\nand quick steps of the feminine feet on the sidewalk, he imagined that\nthe course of time must have turned backward, and that he was still but\neighteen--the same as when he used to hang around the establishments of\nsome celebrated modiste. The groups of women that at certain hours\ncame out of the palace suggested these former days. They were dressed\nextremely quietly, the aspect of many of them as humble as that of the\nseamstresses. But they were ladies of the well-to-do class, some even\ncoming in automobiles driven by chauffeurs in military uniform, because\nthey were ministerial vehicles.\n\nThese long waits often brought him unexpected encounters with the\nelegant students who were going and coming.\n\n\"Desnoyers!\" some feminine voices would exclaim behind him. \"Isn't it\nDesnoyers?\"\n\nAnd he would find himself obliged to relieve their doubts, saluting\nthe ladies who were looking at him as though he were a ghost. They were\nfriends of a remote epoch, of six months ago--ladies who had admired\nand pursued him, trusting sweetly to his masterly wisdom to guide them\nthrough the seven circles of the science of the tango. They were now\nscrutinizing him as if between their last encounter and the present\nmoment had occurred a great cataclysm, transforming all the laws of\nexistence--as if he were the sole survivor of a vanished race.\n\nEventually they all asked the same questions--\"Are you not going to the\nwar? . . . How is it that you are not wearing a uniform?\"\n\nHe would attempt to explain, but at his first words, they would\ninterrupt him:\n\n\"That's so. . . . You are a foreigner.\"\n\nThey would say it with a certain envy, doubtless thinking of their loved\nones now suffering the privations and dangers of war. . . . But the fact\nthat he was a foreigner would instantly create a vague atmosphere of\nspiritual aloofness, an alienation that Julio had not known in the good\nold days when people sought each other without considering nationality,\nwithout feeling that disavowal of danger which isolates and concentrates\nhuman groups.\n\nThe ladies generally bade him adieu with malicious suspicion. What was\nhe doing hanging around there? In search of his usual lucky adventure?\n. . . And their smiles were rather grave, the smiles of older folk who\nknow the true significance of life and commiserate the deluded ones\nstill seeking diversion in frivolities.\n\nThis attitude was as annoying to Julio as though it were a manifestation\nof pity. They were supposing him still exercising the only function of\nwhich he was capable; he wasn't good for anything else. On the\nother hand, these empty heads, still keeping something of their\nold appearance, now appeared animated by the grand sentiment of\nmaternity--an abstract maternity which seemed to be extending to all the\nmen of the nation--a desire for self-sacrifice, of knowing first-hand\nthe privations of the lowly, and aiding all the ills that flesh is heir\nto.\n\nThis same yearning was inspiring Marguerite when she came away from\nher lessons. She was advancing from one overpowering dread to another,\naccepting the first rudiments of surgery as the greatest of scientific\nmarvels. At the same time, she was astonished at the avidity with which\nshe was assimilating these hitherto unsuspected mysteries. Sometimes\nwith a funny assumption of assurance, she would even believe she had\nmistaken her vocation.\n\n\"Who knows but what I was born to be a famous doctor?\" she would\nexclaim.\n\nHer great fear was that she might lose her self-control when the time\ncame to put her newly acquired knowledge into practice. To see herself\nbefore the foul odors of decomposing flesh, to contemplate the flow\nof blood--a horrible thing for her who had always felt an invincible\nrepugnance toward all the unpleasant conditions of ordinary life! But\nthese hesitations were short, and she was suddenly animated by a dashing\nenergy. These were times of sacrifice. Were not the men snatched every\nday from the comforts of sensuous existence to endure the rude life of\na soldier? . . . She would be, a soldier in petticoats, facing pain,\nbattling with it, plunging her hands into putrefaction, flashing like\na ray of sunlight into the places where soldiers were expecting the\napproach of death.\n\nShe proudly narrated to Desnoyers all the progress that she was making\nin the training school, the complicated bandages that she was learning\nto adjust, sometimes over a mannikin, at others over the flesh of an\nemployee, trying to play the part of a sorely wounded patient. She, so\ndainty, so incapable in her own home of the slightest physical effort,\nwas learning the most skilful ways of lifting a human body from the\nground and carrying it on her back. Who knew but that she might render\nthis very service some day on the battlefield! She was ready for the\ngreatest risks, with the ignorant audacity of women impelled by flashes\nof heroism. All her admiration was for the English army nurses, slender\nwomen of nervous vigor whose photographs were appearing in the papers,\nwearing pantaloons, riding boots and white helmets.\n\nJulio listened to her with astonishment. Was this woman really\nMarguerite? . . . War was obliterating all her winning vanities. She was\nno longer fluttering about in bird-like fashion. Her feet were treading\nthe earth with resolute firmness, calm and secure in the new strength\nwhich was developing within. When one of his caresses would remind her\nthat she was a woman, she would always say the same thing,\n\n\"What luck that you are a foreigner! . . . What happiness to know that\nyou do not have to go to war!\"\n\nIn her anxiety for sacrifice, she wanted to go to the battlefields, and\nyet at the same time, she was rejoicing to see her lover exempt from\nmilitary duty. This preposterous lack of logic was not gratefully\nreceived by Julio but irritated him as an unconscious offense.\n\n\"One might suppose that she was protecting me!\" he thought. \"She is\nthe man and rejoices that I, the weak comrade, should be protected from\ndanger. . . . What a grotesque situation!\" . . .\n\nFortunately, at times when Marguerite presented herself at the studio,\nshe was again her old self, making him temporarily forget his annoyance.\nShe would arrive with the same joy in a vacation that the college\nstudent or the employee feels on a holiday. Responsibility was teaching\nher to know the value of time.\n\n\"No classes to-day!\" she would call out on entering; and tossing her\nhat on a divan, she would begin a dance-step, retreating with infantile\ncoquetry from the arms of her lover.\n\nBut in a few minutes she would recover her customary gravity, the\nserious look that had become habitual with her since the outbreak of\nhostilities. She spoke often of her mother, always sad, but striving to\nhide her grief and keeping herself up in the hope of a letter from her\nson; she spoke, too, of the war, commenting on the latest events with\nthe rhetorical optimism of the official dispatches. She could describe\nthe first flag taken from the enemy as minutely as though it were\na garment of unparalleled elegance. From a window, she had seen the\nMinister of War. She was very much affected when repeating the story of\nsome fugitive Belgians recently arrived at the hospital. They were the\nonly patients that she had been able to assist until now. Paris was not\nreceiving the soldiers wounded in battle; by order of the Government,\nthey were being sent from the front to the hospitals in the South.\n\nShe no longer evinced toward Julio the resistance of the first few days.\nHer training as a nurse was giving her a certain passivity. She seemed\nto be ignoring material attractions, stripping them of the spiritual\nimportance which she had hitherto attributed to them. She wanted to make\nJulio happy, although her mind was concentrated on other matters.\n\nOne afternoon, she felt the necessity of communicating certain news\nwhich had been filling her mind since the day before. Springing up from\nthe couch, she hunted for her handbag which contained a letter. She\nwanted to read it again to tell its contents to somebody with that\nirresistible impulse which forestalls confession.\n\nIt was a letter which her brother had sent her from the Vosges. In it\nhe spoke of Laurier more than of himself. They belonged to different\nbatteries, but were in the same division and had taken part in the\nsame combats. The officer was filled with admiration for his former\nbrother-in-law. Who could have guessed that a future hero was hidden\nwithin that silent and tranquil engineer! . . . But he was a genuine\nhero, just the same! All the officials had agreed with Marguerite's\nbrother on seeing how calmly he fulfilled his duty, facing death with\nthe same coolness as though he were in his factory near Paris.\n\nHe had asked for the dangerous post of lookout, slipping as near as\npossible to the enemy's lines in order to verify the exactitude of the\nartillery discharge, rectifying it by telephone. A German shell had\ndemolished the house on the roof of which he was concealed, and Laurier,\non crawling out unhurt from the ruins, had readjusted his telephone and\ngone tranquilly on, continuing the same work in the shelter of a nearby\ngrove. His battery, picked out by the enemy's aeroplanes, had received\nthe concentrated fire of the artillery opposite. In a few minutes all\nthe force were rolling on the ground--the captain and many soldiers\ndead, officers wounded and almost all the gunners. There only remained\nas chief, Laurier, the Impassive (as his comrades nicknamed him), and\naided by the few artillerymen still on their feet, he continued\nfiring under a rain of iron and fire, so as to cover the retreat of a\nbattalion.\n\n\"He has been mentioned twice in dispatches,\" Marguerite continued\nreading. \"I do not believe that it will be long before they give him the\ncross. He is valiant in every way. Who would have supposed all this a\nfew weeks ago?\" . . .\n\nShe did not share the general astonishment. Living with Laurier had\nmany times shown her the intrepidity of his character, the fearlessness\nconcealed under that placid exterior. On that account, her instincts had\nwarned her against rousing her husband's wrath in the first days of\nher infidelity. She still remembered the way he looked the night he\nsurprised her leaving Julio's home. His was the passion that kills, and,\nnevertheless, he had not attempted the least violence with her. . . .\nThe memory of his consideration was awakening in Marguerite a sentiment\nof gratitude. Perhaps he had loved her as no other man had.\n\nHer eyes, with an irresistible desire for comparison, sought Julio's,\nadmiring his youthful grace and distinction. The image of Laurier, heavy\nand ordinary, came into her mind as a consolation. Certainly the officer\nwhom she had seen at the station when saying good-bye to her brother,\ndid not seem to her like her old husband. But Marguerite wished to\nforget the pallid lieutenant with the sad countenance who had passed\nbefore her eyes, preferring to remember him only as the manufacturer\npreoccupied with profits and incapable of comprehending what she was\naccustomed to call \"the delicate refinements of a chic woman.\" Decidedly\nJulio was the more fascinating. She did not repent of her past. She did\nnot wish to repent of it.\n\nAnd her loving selfishness made her repeat once more the same old\nexclamation--\"How fortunate that you are a foreigner! . . . What a\nrelief to know that you are safe from the dangers of war!\"\n\nJulio felt the usual exasperation at hearing this. He came very near to\nclosing his beloved's mouth with his hand. Was she trying to make fun of\nhim? . . . It was fairly insulting to place him apart from other men.\n\nMeanwhile, with blind irrelevance, she persisted in talking about\nLaurier, commenting upon his achievements.\n\n\"I do not love him, I never have loved him. Do not look so cross! How\ncould the poor man ever be compared with you? You must admit, though,\nthat his new existence is rather interesting. I rejoice in his brave\ndeeds as though an old friend had done them, a family visitor whom I had\nnot seen for a long time. . . . The poor man deserved a better fate. He\nought to have married some other woman, some companion more on a level\nwith his ideals. . . . I tell you that I really pity him!\"\n\nAnd this pity was so intense that her eyes filled with tears, awakening\nthe tortures of jealousy in her lover. After these interviews, Desnoyers\nwas more ill-tempered and despondent than ever.\n\n\"I am beginning to realize that we are in a false position,\" he said one\nmorning to Argensola. \"Life is going to become increasingly painful. It\nis difficult to remain tranquil, continuing the same old existence in\nthe midst of a people at war.\"\n\nHis companion had about come to the same conclusion. He, too, was\nbeginning to feel that the life of a young foreigner in Paris was\ninsufferable, now that it was so upset by war.\n\n\"One has to keep showing passports all the time in order that the police\nmay be sure that they have not discovered a deserter. In the street\ncar, the other afternoon, I had to explain that I was a Spaniard to some\ngirls who were wondering why I was not at the front. . . . One of them,\nas soon as she learned my nationality, asked me with great simplicity\nwhy I did not offer myself as a volunteer. . . . Now they have invented\na word for the stay-at-homes, calling them Les Embusques, the hidden\nones. . . . I am sick and tired of the ironical looks shot at me\nwherever I go; it makes me wild to be taken for an Embusque.\"\n\nA flash of heroism was galvanizing the impressionable Bohemian. Now that\neverybody was going to the war, he was wishing to do the same thing. He\nwas not afraid of death; the only thing that was disturbing him was the\nmilitary service, the uniform, the mechanical obedience to bugle-call,\nthe blind subservience to the chiefs. Fighting was not offering any\ndifficulties for him but his nature capriciously resented everything\nin the form of discipline. The foreign groups in Paris were trying to\norganize each its own legion of volunteers and he, too, was planning\nhis--a battalion of Spaniards and South Americans, reserving naturally\nthe presidency of the organizing committee for himself, and later the\ncommand of the body.\n\nHe had inserted notices in the papers, making the studio in the rue\nde la Pompe the recruiting office. In ten days, two volunteers had\npresented themselves; a clerk, shivering in midsummer, who stipulated\nthat he should be an officer because he was wearing a suitable jacket,\nand a Spanish tavern-keeper who at the very outset had wished to rob\nArgensola of his command on the futile pretext that he was a soldier\nin his youth while the Bohemian was only an artist. Twenty Spanish\nbattalions were attempted with the same result in different parts of\nParis. Each enthusiast wished to be commander of the others, with the\nindividual haughtiness and aversion to discipline so characteristic of\nthe race. Finally the future generalissimos, decided to enlist as simple\nvolunteers . . . but in a French regiment.\n\n\"I am waiting to see what the Garibaldis do,\" said Argensola modestly.\n\"Perhaps I may go with them.\"\n\nThis glorious name made military service conceivable to him. But then\nhe vacillated; he would certainly have to obey somebody in this body of\nvolunteers, and he did not believe in an obedience that was not preceded\nby long discussions. . . . What next!\n\n\"Life has changed in a fortnight,\" he continued. \"It seems as if we were\nliving in another planet; our former achievements are not appreciated.\nOthers, most obscure and poor, those who formerly had the least\nconsideration, are now promoted to the first ranks. The refined man of\ncomplex spirituality has disappeared for who knows how many years!\n. . . Now the simple-minded man climbs triumphantly to the top, because,\nthough his ideas are limited, they are sure and he knows how to obey. We\nare no longer the style.\"\n\nDesnoyers assented. It was so; they were no longer fashionable. None\nknew that better than he, for he who was once the sensation of the day,\nwas now passing as a stranger among the very people who a few months\nbefore had raved over him.\n\n\"Your reign is over,\" laughed Argensola. \"The fact that you are a\nhandsome fellow doesn't help you one bit nowadays. In a uniform and with\na cross on my breast, I could soon get the best of you in a rival\nlove affair. In times of peace, the officers only set the girls of the\nprovinces to dreaming; but now that we are at war, there has awakened in\nevery woman the ancestral enthusiasm that her remote grandmothers used\nto feel for the strong and aggressive beast. . . . The high-born dames\nwho a few months ago were complicating their desires with psychological\nsubtleties, are now admiring the military man with the same simplicity\nthat the maid has for the common soldier. Before a uniform, they feel\nthe humble and servile enthusiasm of the female of the lower animals\nbefore the crests, foretops and gay plumes of the fighting males. Look\nout, master! . . . We shall have to follow the new course of events or\nresign ourselves to everlasting obscurity. The tango is dead.\"\n\nAnd Desnoyers agreed that truly they were two beings on the other side\nof the river of life which at one bound had changed its course. There\nwas no longer any place in the new existence for that poor painter of\nsouls, nor for that hero of a frivolous life who, from five to seven\nevery afternoon, had attained the triumphs most envied by mankind.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE RETREAT\n\n\nWar had extended one of its antennae even to the avenue Victor Hugo. It\nwas a silent war in which the enemy, bland, shapeless and gelatinous,\nseemed constantly to be escaping from the hands only to renew\nhostilities a little later on.\n\n\"I have Germany in my own house,\" growled Marcelo Desnoyers.\n\n\"Germany\" was Dona Elena, the wife of von Hartrott. Why had not her\nson--that professor of inexhaustible sufficiency whom he now believed to\nhave been a spy--taken her home with him? For what sentimental caprice\nhad she wished to stay with her sister, losing the opportunity of\nreturning to Berlin before the frontiers were closed?\n\nThe presence of this woman in his home was the cause of many\ncompunctions and alarms. Fortunately, the chauffeur and all the\nmen-servants were in the army. The two chinas received an order in a\nthreatening tone. They must be very careful when talking to the French\nmaids--not the slightest allusion to the nationality of Dona Elena's\nhusband nor to the residence of her family. Dona Elena was an\nArgentinian. But in spite of the silence of the maids, Don Marcelo was\nalways in fear of some outburst of exalted patriotism, and that his\nwife's sister might suddenly find herself confined in a concentration\ncamp under suspicion of having dealings with the enemy.\n\nFrau von Hartrott made his uneasiness worse. Instead of keeping a\ndiscreet silence, she was constantly introducing discord into the home\nwith her opinions.\n\nDuring the first days of the war, she kept herself locked in her room,\njoining the family only when summoned to the dining room. With tightly\npuckered mouth and an absent-minded air, she would then seat herself at\nthe table, pretending not to hear Don Marcelo's verbal outpourings\nof enthusiasm. He enjoyed describing the departure of the troops, the\nmoving scenes in the streets and at the stations, commenting on events\nwith an optimism sure of the first news of the war. Two things were\nbeyond all discussion. The bayonet was the secret of the French, and the\nGermans were shuddering with terror before its fatal, glistening point.\n. . . The '75 cannon had proved itself a unique jewel, its shots being\nabsolutely sure. He was really feeling sorry for the enemy's artillery\nsince its projectiles so seldom exploded even when well aimed. . . .\nFurthermore, the French troops had entered victoriously into Alsace;\nmany little towns were already theirs.\n\n\"Now it is as it was in the '70's,\" he would exult, brandishing his fork\nand waving his napkin. \"We are going to kick them back to the other side\nof the Rhine--kick them! . . . That's the word.\"\n\nChichi always agreed gleefully while Dona Elena was raising her eyes to\nheaven, as though silently calling upon somebody hidden in the ceiling\nto bear witness to such errors and blasphemies.\n\nThe kind Dona Luisa always sought her out afterwards in the retirement\nof her room, believing it necessary to give sisterly counsel to one\nliving so far from home. The Romantica did not maintain her austere\nsilence before the sister who had always venerated her superior\ninstruction; so now the poor lady was overwhelmed with accounts of the\nstupendous forces of Germany, enunciated with all the authority of a\nwife of a great Teutonic patriot, and a mother of an almost celebrated\nprofessor. According to her graphic picture, millions of men were now\nsurging forth in enormous streams, thousands of cannons were filing by,\nand tremendous mortars like monstrous turrets. And towering above all\nthis vast machinery of destruction was a man who alone was worth an\narmy, a being who knew everything and could do everything, handsome,\nintelligent, and infallible as a god--the Emperor.\n\n\"The French just don't know what's ahead of them,\" declared Dona Elena.\n\"We are going to annihilate them. It is merely a matter of two weeks.\nBefore August is ended, the Emperor will have entered Paris.\"\n\nSenora Desnoyers was so greatly impressed by these dire prophecies that\nshe could not hide them from her family. Chichi waxed indignant at her\nmother's credulity and her aunt's Germanism. Martial fervor was flaming\nup in the former Peoncito. Ay, if the women could only go to war! . . .\nShe enjoyed picturing herself on horseback in command of a regiment of\ndragoons, charging the enemy with other Amazons as dashing and buxom as\nshe. Then her fondness for skating would predominate over her tastes for\nthe cavalry, and she would long to be an Alpine hunter, a diable bleu\namong those who slid on long runners, with musket slung across the back\nand alpenstock in hand, over the snowy slopes of the Vosges.\n\nBut the government did not appreciate the valorous women, and she\ncould obtain no other part in the war but to admire the uniform of her\ntrue-love, Rene Lacour, converted into a soldier. The senator's son\ncertainly looked beautiful. He was tall and fair, of a rather feminine\ntype recalling his dead mother. In his fiancee's opinion, Rene was just\n\"a little sugar soldier.\" At first she had been very proud to walk the\nstreets by the side of this warrior, believing that his uniform had\ngreatly augmented his personal charm, but little by little a revulsion\nof feeling was clouding her joy. The senatorial prince was nothing but\na common soldier. His illustrious father, fearful that the war might cut\noff forever the dynasty of the Lacours, indispensable to the welfare of\nthe State, had had his son mustered into the auxiliary service of the\narmy. By this arrangement, his heir need not leave Paris, ranking about\nas high as those who were kneading the bread or mending the soldiers'\ncloaks. Only by going to the front could he claim--as a student of the\nEcole Centrale--his title of sub-lieutenant in the Artillery Reserves.\n\n\"What happiness for me that you have to stay in Paris! How delighted I\nam that you are just a private! . . .\"\n\nAnd yet, at the same time, Chichi was thinking enviously of her friends\nwhose lovers and brothers were officers. They could parade the streets,\nescorted by a gold-trimmed kepis that attracted the notice of the\npassers-by and the respectful salute of the lower ranks.\n\nEach time that Dona Luisa, terrified by the forecasts of her sister,\nundertook to communicate her dismay to her daughter, the girl would rage\nup and down, exclaiming:--\n\n\"What lies my aunt tells you! . . . Since her husband is a German, she\nsees everything as he wishes it to be. Papa knows more; Rene's father is\nbetter informed about these things. We are going to give them a thorough\nhiding! What fun it will be when they hit my uncle and all my snippy\ncousins in Berlin! . . .\"\n\n\"Hush,\" groaned her mother. \"Do not talk such nonsense. The war has\nturned you as crazy as your father.\"\n\nThe good lady was scandalized at hearing the outburst of savage desires\nthat the mere mention of the Kaiser always aroused in her daughter. In\ntimes of peace, Chichi had rather admired this personage. \"He's not so\nbad-looking,\" she had commented, \"but with a very ordinary smile.\" Now\nall her wrath was concentrated upon him. The thousands of women that\nwere weeping through his fault! The mothers without sons, the wives\nwithout husbands, the poor children left in the burning towns! . . .\nAh, the vile wretch! . . . And she would brandish her knife of the old\nPeoncito days--a dagger with silver handle and sheath richly chased, a\ngift that her grandfather had exhumed from some forgotten souvenirs\nof his childhood in an old valise. The very first German that she\ncame across was doomed to death. Dona Luisa was terrified to find her\nflourishing this weapon before her dressing mirror. She was no longer\nyearning to be a cavalryman nor a diable bleu. She would be entirely\ncontent if they would leave her, alone in some closed space with the\ndetested monster. In just five minutes she would settle the universal\nconflict.\n\n\"Defend yourself, Boche,\" she would shriek, standing at guard as in her\nchildhood she had seen the peons doing on the ranch.\n\nAnd with a knife-thrust above and below, she would pierce his imperial\nvitals. Immediately there resounded in her imagination, shouts of joy,\nthe gigantic sigh of millions of women freed at last from the bloody\nnightmare--thanks to her playing the role of Judith or Charlotte Corday,\nor a blend of all the heroic women who had killed for the common weal.\nHer savage fury made her continue her imaginary slaughter, dagger in\nhand. Second stroke!--the Crown Prince rolling to one side and his head\nto the other. A rain of dagger thrusts!--all the invincible generals\nof whom her aunt had been boasting fleeing with their insides in their\nhands--and bringing up the rear, that fawning lackey who wished to\nreceive the same things as those of highest rank--the uncle from Berlin.\n. . . Ay, if she could only get the chance to make these longings a\nreality!\n\n\"You are mad,\" protested her mother. \"Completely mad! How can a ladylike\ngirl talk in such a way?\" . . .\n\nSurprising her niece in the ecstasy of these delirious ravings, Dona\nElena would raise her eyes to heaven, abstaining thenceforth from\ncommunicating her opinions, reserving them wholly for the mother.\n\nDon Marcelo's indignation took another bound when his wife repeated to\nhim the news from her sister. All a lie! . . . The war was progressing\nfinely. On the Eastern frontier the French troops had advanced through\nthe interior of Alsace and Lorraine.\n\n\"But--Belgium is invaded, isn't it?\" asked Dona Luisa. \"And those poor\nBelgians?\"\n\nDesnoyers retorted indignantly.\n\n\"That invasion of Belgium is treason. . . . And a treason never amounts\nto anything among decent people.\"\n\nHe said it in all good faith as though war were a duel in which the\ntraitor was henceforth ruled out and unable to continue his outrages.\nBesides, the heroic resistance of Belgium was nourishing the most absurd\nillusions in his heart. The Belgians were certainly supernatural men\ndestined to the most stupendous achievements. . . . And to think that\nheretofore he had never taken this plucky little nation into account!\n. . . For several days, he considered Liege a holy city before whose\nwalls the Teutonic power would be completely confounded. Upon the fall\nof Liege, his unquenchable faith sought another handle. There were still\nremaining many other Lieges in the interior. The Germans might force\ntheir way further in; then we would see how many of them ever succeeded\nin getting out. The entry into Brussels did not disquiet him. An\nunprotected city! . . . Its surrender was a foregone conclusion. Now the\nBelgians would be better able to defend Antwerp. Neither did the advance\nof the Germans toward the French frontier alarm him at all. In vain his\nsister-in-law, with malicious brevity, mentioned in the dining-room the\nprogress of the invasion, so confusedly outlined in the daily papers.\nThe Germans were already at the frontier.\n\n\"And what of that?\" yelled Don Marcelo. \"Soon they will meet someone to\ntalk to! Joffre is going to meet them. Our armies are in the East, in\nthe very place where they ought to be, on the true frontier, at the door\nof their home. But they have to deal with a treacherous and cowardly\nopponent that instead of marching face to face, leaps the walls of the\ncorral like sheep-stealers. . . . Their underhand tricks won't do them\nany good, though! The French are already in Belgium and adjusting the\naccounts of the Germans. We shall smash them so effectually that never\nagain will they be able to disturb the peace of the world. And that\naccursed individual with the rampant moustache we are going to put in a\ncage, and exhibit in the place de la Concorde!\"\n\nInspired by the paternal braggadocio, Chichi also launched forth\nexultingly an imaginary series of avenging torments and insults as a\ncomplement to this Imperial Exhibition.\n\nThese allusions to the Emperor aggravated Frau von Hartrott more than\nanything else. In the first days of the war, her sister had surprised\nher weeping before the newspaper caricatures and leaflets sold in the\nstreets.\n\n\"Such an excellent man . . . so knightly . . . such a good father to his\nfamily! He wasn't to blame for anything. It was his enemies who forced\nhim to assume the offensive.\"\n\nHer veneration for exalted personages was making her take the attacks\nupon this admired grandee as though they were directed against her own\nfamily.\n\nOne night in the dining room, she abandoned her tragic silence. Certain\nsarcasms, shot by Desnoyers at her hero, brought the tears to her eyes,\nand this sentimental indulgence turned her thoughts upon her sons who\nwere undoubtedly taking part in the invasion.\n\nHer brother-in-law was longing for the extermination of all the enemy.\n\"May every barbarian be exterminated! . . . every one of the bandits in\npointed helmets who have just burned Louvain and other towns, shooting\ndefenceless peasants, old men, women and children!\"\n\n\"You forget that I am a mother,\" sobbed Frau von Hartrott. \"You forget\nthat among those whose extermination you are imploring, are my sons.\"\n\nHer violent weeping made Desnoyers realize more than ever the abyss\nyawning between him and this woman lodged in his own house. His\nresentment, however, overleapt family considerations. . . . She might\nweep for her sons all she wanted to; that was her right. But these sons\nwere aggressors and wantonly doing evil. It was the other mothers who\nwere inspiring his pity--those who were living tranquilly in their\nsmiling little Belgian towns when their sons were suddenly shot down,\ntheir daughters violated and their houses burned to the ground.\n\nAs though this description of the horrors of war were a fresh insult to\nher, Dona Elena wept harder than ever. What falsehoods! The Kaiser was\nan excellent man. His soldiers were gentlemen, the German army was a\nmodel of civilization and goodness. Her husband had belonged to\nthis army, her sons were marching in its ranks. And she knew her\nsons--well-bred and incapable of wrong-doing. These Belgian calumnies\nshe could no longer listen to . . . and, with dramatic abandon, she\nflung herself into the arms of her sister.\n\nSenor Desnoyers raged against the fate that condemned him to live under\nthe same roof with this woman. What an unfortunate complication for the\nfamily! . . . and the frontiers were closed, making it impossible to get\nrid of her!\n\n\"Very well, then,\" he thundered. \"Let us talk no more about it. We shall\nnever reach an understanding, for we belong to two different worlds.\nIt's a great pity that you can't go back to your own people.\"\n\nAfter that, he refrained from mentioning the war in his sister-in-law's\npresence. Chichi was the only one keeping up her aggressive and noisy\nenthusiasm. Upon reading in the papers the news of the shootings,\nsackings, burning of cities, and the dolorous flight of those who\nhad seen their all reduced to ashes, she again felt the necessity of\nassuming the role of lady-assassin. Ay, if she could only once get her\nhands on one of those bandits! . . . What did the men amount to anyway\nif they couldn't exterminate the whole lot? . . .\n\nThen she would look at Rene in his exquisitely fresh uniform,\nsweet-mannered and smiling as though all war meant to him was a mere\nchange of attire, and she would exclaim enigmatically:\n\n\"What luck that you will never have to go to the front! . . . How fine\nthat you don't run any risks!\"\n\nAnd her lover would accept these words as but another proof of her\naffectionate interest.\n\nOne day Don Marcelo was able to appreciate the horrors of the war\nwithout leaving Paris. Three thousand Belgian refugees were quartered\nprovisionally in the circus before being distributed among the\nprovinces. When Desnoyers entered this place, he saw in the vestibule\nthe same posters which had been flaunting their spectacular gayeties\nwhen he had visited it a few months before with his family.\n\nNow he noticed the odor from a sick and miserable multitude crowded\ntogether--like the exhalation from a prison or poorhouse infirmary. He\nsaw a throng that seemed crazy or stupefied with grief. They did not\nknow exactly where they were; they had come thither, they didn't know\nhow. The terrible spectacle of the invasion was still so persistent in\ntheir minds that it left room for no other impression. They were still\nseeing the helmeted men in their peaceful hamlets, their homes in\nflames, the soldiery firing upon those who were fleeing, the mutilated\nwomen done to death by incessant adulterous assault, the old men burned\nalive, the children stabbed in their cradles by human beasts inflamed\nby alcohol and license. . . . Some of the octogenarians were weeping as\nthey told how the soldiers of a civilized nation were cutting off the\nbreasts from the women in order to nail them to the doors, how they had\npassed around as a trophy a new-born babe spiked on a bayonet, how they\nhad shot aged men in the very armchair in which they were huddled in\ntheir sorrowful weakness, torturing them first with their jests and\ntaunts.\n\nThey had fled blindly, pursued by fire and shot, as crazed with terror\nas the people of the middle ages trying not to be ridden down by the\nhordes of galloping Huns and Mongols. And this flight had been across\nthe country in its loveliest festal array, in the most productive of\nmonths, when the earth was bristling with ears of grain, when the August\nsky was most brilliant, and when the birds were greeting the opulent\nharvest with their glad songs!\n\nIn that circus, filled with the wandering crowds, the immense crime was\nliving again. The children were crying with a sound like the bleating\nof lambs; the men were looking wildly around with terrified eyes;\nthe frenzied women were howling like the insane. Families had become\nseparated in the terror of flight. A mother of five little ones now had\nbut one. The parents, as they realized the number missing, were thinking\nwith anguish of those who had disappeared. Would they ever find them\nagain? . . . Or were they already dead? . . .\n\nDon Marcelo returned home, grinding his teeth and waving his cane in an\nalarming manner. Ah, the bandits! . . . If only his sister-in-law could\nchange her sex! Why wasn't she a man? . . . It would be better still if\nshe could suddenly assume the form of her husband, von Hartrott. What an\ninteresting interview the two brothers-in-law would have! . . .\n\nThe war was awakening religious sentiment in the men and increasing\nthe devotion of the women. The churches were filled. Dona Luisa was no\nlonger confining herself to those of her neighborhood. With the courage\ninduced by extraordinary events, she was traversing Paris afoot and\ngoing from the Madeleine to Notre Dame, or to the Sacre Coeur on the\nheights of Montmartre. Religious festivals were now thronged like\npopular assemblies. The preachers were tribunes. Patriotic enthusiasm\ninterrupted many sermon with applause.\n\nEach morning on opening the papers, before reading the war news, Senora\nDesnoyers would hunt other notices. \"Where was Father Amette going to\nbe to-day?\" Then, under the arched vaultings of that temple, would\nshe unite her voice with the devout chorus imploring supernatural\nintervention. \"Lord, save France!\" Patriotic religiosity was putting\nSainte Genevieve at the head of the favored ones, so from all these\nfiestas, Dona Luisa, tremulous with faith, would return in expectation\nof a miracle similar to that which the patron saint of Paris had worked\nbefore the invading hordes of Attila.\n\nDona Elena was also visiting the churches, but those nearest the house.\nHer brother-in-law saw her one afternoon entering Saint-Honoree d'Eylau.\nThe building was filled with the faithful, and on the altar was a sheaf\nof flags--France and the allied nations. The imploring crowd was not\ncomposed entirely of women. Desnoyers saw men of his age, pompous and\ngrave, moving their lips and fixing steadfast eyes on the altar on which\nwere reflected like lost stars, the flames of the candles. And again he\nfelt envy. They were fathers who were recalling their childhood prayers,\nthinking of their sons in battle. Don Marcelo, who had always considered\nreligion with indifference, suddenly recognized the necessity of\nfaith. He wanted to pray like the others, with a vague, indefinite\nsupplication, including all beings who were struggling and dying for a\nland that he had not tried to defend.\n\nHe was scandalized to see von Hartrott's wife kneeling among these\npeople raising her eyes to the cross in a look of anguished entreaty.\nShe was begging heaven to protect her husband, the German who perhaps\nat this moment was concentrating all his devilish faculties on the\nbest organization for crushing the weak; she was praying for her sons,\nofficers of the King of Prussia, who revolver in hand were entering\nvillages and farmlands, driving before them a horror-stricken crowd,\nleaving behind them fire and death. And these orisons were going to\nmingle with those of the mothers who were praying for the youth trying\nto check the onslaught of the barbarians--with the petitions of these\nearnest men, rigid in their tragic grief! . . .\n\nHe had to make a great effort not to protest aloud, and he left the\nchurch. His sister-in-law had no right to kneel there among those\npeople.\n\n\"They ought to put her out!\" he growled indignantly. \"She is\ncompromising God with her absurd entreaties.\"\n\nBut in spite of his annoyance, he had to endure her living in his\nhousehold, and at the same time had taken great pains to prevent her\nnationality being known outside.\n\nIt was a severe trial for Don Marcelo to be obliged to keep silent\nwhen at table with his family. He had to avoid the hysterics of his\nsister-in-law who promptly burst into sighs and sobs at the slightest\nallusion to her hero; and he feared equally the complaints of his wife,\nalways ready to defend her sister, as though she were the victim. . . .\nThat a man in his own home should have to curb his tongue and speak\ntactfully! . . .\n\nThe only satisfaction permitted him was to announce the military moves.\nThe French had entered Belgium. \"It appears that the Boches have had a\ngood set-back.\" The slightest clash of cavalry, a simple encounter\nwith the advance troops, he would glorify as a decisive victory. \"In\nLorraine, too, we are making great headway!\" . . . But suddenly the\nfountain of his bubbling optimism seemed to become choked up. To\njudge from the periodicals, nothing extraordinary was occurring. They\ncontinued publishing war-stories so as to keep enthusiasm at fever-heat,\nbut nothing definite. The Government, too, was issuing communications of\nvague and rhetorical verbosity. Desnoyers became alarmed, his instinct\nwarning him of danger. \"There is something wrong,\" he thought. \"There's\na spring broken somewhere!\"\n\nThis lack of encouraging news coincided exactly with the sudden rise in\nDona Elena's spirits. With whom had that woman been talking? Whom did\nshe meet when she was on the street? . . . Without dropping her pose\nas a martyr, with the same woebegone look and drooping mouth, she was\ntalking, and talking treacherously. The torment of Don Marcelo in being\nobliged to listen to the enemy harbored within his gates! . . . The\nFrench had been vanquished in Lorraine and in Belgium at the same time.\nA body of the army had deserted the colors; many prisoners, many cannon\nwere captured. \"Lies! German exaggerations!\" howled Desnoyers. And\nChichi with the derisive ha-ha's of an insolent girl, drowned out the\ntriumphant communications of the aunt from Berlin. \"I don't know, of\ncourse,\" said the unwelcome lodger with mock humility. \"Perhaps it is\nnot authentic. I have heard it said.\" Her host was furious. Where had\nshe heard it said? Who was giving her such news? . . .\n\nAnd in order to ventilate his wrath, he broke forth into tirades against\nthe enemy's espionage, against the carelessness of the police force in\npermitting so many Germans to remain hidden in Paris. Then he suddenly\nbecame quiet, thinking of his own behavior in this line. He, too, was\ninvoluntarily contributing toward the maintenance and support of the\nfoe.\n\nThe fall of the ministry and the constitution of a government of\nnational defense made it apparent that something very important must\nhave taken place. The alarms and tears of Dona Luisa increased his\nnervousness. The good lady was no longer returning from the churches,\ncheered and strengthened. Her confidential talks with her sister were\nfilling her with a terror that she tried in vain to communicate to\nher husband. \"All is lost. . . . Elena is the only one that knows the\ntruth.\"\n\nDesnoyers went in search of Senator Lacour. He would know all the\nministers; no one could be better informed. \"Yes, my friend,\" said the\nimportant man sadly. \"Two great losses at Morhange and Charleroi, at the\nEast and the North. The enemy is going to invade French soil! . . . But\nour army is intact, and will retreat in good order. Good fortune may\nstill be ours. A great calamity, but all is not lost.\"\n\nPreparations for the defense of Paris were being pushed forward . . .\nrather late. The forts were supplying themselves with new cannon.\nHouses, built in the danger zone in the piping times of peace, were now\ndisappearing under the blows of the official demolition. The trees on\nthe outer avenues were being felled in order to enlarge the horizon.\nBarricades of sacks of earth and tree trunks were heaped at the doors of\nthe old walls. The curious were skirting the suburbs in order to gaze\nat the recently dug trenches and the barbed wire fences. The Bois de\nBoulogne was filled with herds of cattle. Near heaps of dry alfalfa\nsteers and sheep were grouped in the green meadows. Protection against\nfamine was uppermost in the minds of a people still remembering the\nsuffering of 1870. Every night, the street lighting was less and less.\nThe sky, on the other hand, was streaked incessantly by the shafts from\nthe searchlights. Fear of aerial invasion was increasing the public\nuneasiness. Timid people were speaking of Zeppelins, attributing to\nthem irresistible powers, with all the exaggeration that accompanies\nmysterious dangers.\n\nIn her panic, Dona Luisa greatly distressed her husband, who was passing\nthe days in continual alarm, yet trying to put heart into his trembling\nand anxious wife. \"They are going to come, Marcelo; my heart tells\nme so. The girl! . . . the girl!\" She was accepting blindly all the\nstatements made by her sister, the only thing that comforted her\nbeing the chivalry and discipline of those troops to which her nephews\nbelonged. The news of the atrocities committed against the women of\nBelgium were received with the same credulity as the enemy's advances\nannounced by Elena. \"Our girl, Marcelo. . . . Our girl!\" And the girl,\nobject of so much solicitude, would laugh with the assurance of vigorous\nyouth on hearing of her mother's anxiety. \"Just let the shameless\nfellows come! I shall take great pleasure in seeing them face to face!\"\nAnd she clenched her right hand as though it already clutched the\navenging knife.\n\nThe father became tired of this situation. He still had one of his\nmonumental automobiles that an outside chauffeur could manage. Senator\nLacour obtained the necessary passports and Desnoyers gave his wife\nher orders in a tone that admitted of no remonstrance. They must go to\nBiarritz or to some of the summer resorts in the north of Spain. Almost\nall the South American families had already gone in the same direction.\nDona Luisa tried to object. It was impossible for her to separate\nherself from her husband. Never before, in their many years of married\nlife, had they once been separated. But a harsh negative from Don\nMarcelo cut her pleadings short. He would remain. Then the poor senora\nran to the rue de la Pompe. Her son! . . . Julio scarcely listened to\nhis mother. Ay! he, too, would stay. So finally the imposing automobile\nlumbered toward the South carrying Dona Luisa, her sister who hailed\nwith delight this withdrawal before the admired troops of the Emperor,\nand Chichi, pleased that the war was necessitating an excursion to the\nfashionable beaches frequented by her friends.\n\nDon Marcelo was at last alone. The two coppery maids had followed by\nrail the flight of their mistresses. At first the old man felt a little\nbewildered by this solitude, which obliged him to eat uncomfortable\nmeals in a restaurant and pass the nights in enormous and deserted rooms\nstill bearing traces of their former occupants. The other apartments in\nthe building had also been vacated. All the tenants were foreigners, who\nhad discreetly decamped, or French families surprised by the war when\nsummering at their country seats.\n\nInstinctively he turned his steps toward the rue de la Pompe gazing from\nafar at the studio windows. What was his son doing? . . . Undoubtedly\ncontinuing his gay and useless life. Such men only existed for their own\nselfish folly.\n\nDesnoyers felt satisfied with the stand he had taken. To follow the\nfamily would be sheer cowardice. The memory of his youthful flight to\nSouth America was sufficient martyrdom; he would finish his life with\nall the compensating bravery that he could muster. \"No, they will not\ncome,\" he said repeatedly, with the optimism of enthusiasm. \"I have\na presentiment that they will never reach Paris. And even if they DO\ncome!\" . . . The absence of his family brought him a joyous valor and a\nsense of bold youthfulness. Although his age might prevent his going to\nwar in the open air, he could still fire a gun, immovable in a trench,\nwithout fear of death. Let them come! . . . He was longing for the\nstruggle with the anxiety of a punctilious business man wishing to\ncancel a former debt as soon as possible.\n\nIn the streets of Paris he met many groups of fugitives. They were from\nthe North and East of France, and had escaped before the German advance.\nOf all the tales told by this despondent crowd--not knowing where to go\nand dependent upon the charity of the people--he was most impressed\nwith those dealing with the disregard of property. Shootings and\nassassinations made him clench his fists, with threats of vengeance;\nbut the robberies authorized by the heads, the wholesale sackings by\nsuperior order, followed by fire, appeared to him so unheard-of that\nhe was silent with stupefaction, his speech seeming to be temporarily\nparalyzed. And a people with laws could wage war in this fashion, like a\ntribe of Indians going to combat in order to rob! . . . His adoration of\nproperty rights made him beside himself with wrath at these sacrileges.\n\nHe began to worry about his castle at Villeblanche. All that he owned in\nParis suddenly seemed to him of slight importance to what he had in his\nhistoric mansion. His best paintings were there, adorning the gloomy\nsalons; there, too, the furnishings captured from the antiquarians after\nan auctioneering battle, and the crystal cabinets, the tapestries, the\nsilver services.\n\nHe mentally reviewed all of these objects, not letting a single one\nescape his inventory. Things that he had forgotten came surging up in\nhis memory, and the fear of losing them seemed to give them greater\nlustre, increasing their size, and intensifying their value. All the\nriches of Villeblanche were concentrated in one certain acquisition\nwhich Desnoyers admired most of all; for, to his mind, it stood for\nall the glory of his immense fortune--in fact, the most luxurious\nappointment that even a millionaire could possess.\n\n\"My golden bath,\" he thought. \"I have there my tub of gold.\"\n\nThis bath of priceless metal he had procured, after much financial\nwrestling, from an auction, and he considered the purchase the\nculminating achievement of his wealth. No one knew exactly its origin;\nperhaps it had been the property of luxurious princes; perhaps it owed\nits existence to the caprice of a demi-mondaine fond of display. He and\nhis had woven a legend around this golden cavity adorned with lions'\nclaws, dolphins and busts of naiads. Undoubtedly it was once a king's!\nChichi gravely affirmed that it had been Marie Antoinette's, and the\nentire family thought that the home on the avenue Victor Hugo was\naltogether too modest and plebeian to enshrine such a jewel. They\ntherefore agreed to put it in the castle, where it was greatly\nvenerated, although it was useless and solemn as a museum piece. . . .\nAnd was he to permit the enemy in their advance toward the Marne to\ncarry off this priceless treasure, as well as the other gorgeous things\nwhich he had accumulated with such patience Ah, no! His soul of a\ncollector would be capable of the greatest heroism before he would let\nthat go.\n\nEach day was bringing a fresh sheaf of bad news. The papers were saying\nlittle, and the Government was so veiling its communications that\nthe mind was left in great perplexity. Nevertheless, the truth\nwas mysteriously forcing its way, impelled by the pessimism of the\nalarmists, and the manipulation of the enemy's spies who were remaining\nhidden in Paris. The fatal news was being passed along in whispers.\n\"They have already crossed the frontier. . . .\" \"They are already in\nLille.\" . . . They were advancing at the rate of thirty-five miles\na day. The name of von Kluck was beginning to have a familiar ring.\nEnglish and French were retreating before the enveloping progression of\nthe invaders. Some were expecting another Sedan. Desnoyers was following\nthe advance of the Germans, going daily to the Gare du Nord. Every\ntwenty-four hours was lessening the radius of travel. Bulletins\nannouncing that tickets would not be sold for the Northern districts\nserved to indicate how these places were falling, one after the other,\ninto the power of the invader. The shrinkage of national territory was\ngoing on with such methodical regularity that, with watch in hand, and\nallowing an advance of thirty-five miles daily, one might gauge the hour\nwhen the lances of the first Uhlans would salute the Eiffel tower. The\ntrains were running full, great bunches of people overflowing from their\ncoaches.\n\nIn this time of greatest anxiety, Desnoyers again visited his friend,\nSenator Lacour, in order to astound him with the most unheard-of\npetitions. He wished to go immediately to his castle. While everybody\nelse was fleeing toward Paris he earnestly desired to go in the opposite\ndirection. The senator couldn't believe his ears.\n\n\"You are beside yourself!\" he exclaimed. \"It is necessary to leave\nParis, but toward the South. I will tell you confidentially, and you\nmust not tell because it is a secret--we are leaving at any minute; we\nare all going, the President, the Government, the Chambers. We are\ngoing to establish ourselves at Bordeaux as in 1870. The enemy is surely\napproaching; it is only a matter of days . . . of hours. We know little\nof just what is happening, but all the news is bad. The army still\nholds firm, is yet intact, but retreating . . . retreating, all the time\nyielding ground. . . . Believe me, it will be better for you to leave\nParis. Gallieni will defend it, but the defense is going to be hard\nand horrible. . . . Although Paris may surrender, France will not\nnecessarily surrender. The war will go on if necessary even to the\nfrontiers of Spain . . . but it is sad . . . very sad!\"\n\nAnd he offered to take his friend with him in that flight to Bordeaux of\nwhich so few yet knew. Desnoyers shook his head. No; he wanted to go the\ncastle of Villeblanche. His furniture . . . his riches . . . his parks.\n\n\"But you will be taken prisoner!\" protested the senator. \"Perhaps they\nwill kill you!\"\n\nA shrug of indifference was the only response. He considered himself\nenergetic enough to struggle against the entire German army in the\ndefense of his property. The important thing was to get there, and\nthen--just let anybody dare to touch his things! . . . The senator\nlooked with astonishment at this civilian infuriated by the lust of\npossession. It reminded him of some Arab merchants that he had once\nknown, ordinarily mild and pacific, who quarrelled and killed like wild\nbeasts when Bedouin thieves seized their wares. This was not the moment\nfor discussion, and each must map out his own course. So the influential\nsenator finally yielded to the desire of his friend. If such was\nhis pleasure, let him carry it through! So he arranged that his mad\npetitioner should depart that very night on a military train that was\ngoing to meet the army.\n\nThat journey put Don Marcelo in touch with the extraordinary movement\nwhich the war had developed on the railroads. His train took fourteen\nhours to cover the distance normally made in two. It was made up of\nfreight cars filled with provisions and cartridges, with the doors\nstamped and sealed. A third-class car was occupied by the train escort,\na detachment of provincial guards. He was installed in a second-class\ncompartment with the lieutenant in command of this guard and certain\nofficials on their way to join their regiments after having completed\nthe business of mobilization in the small towns in which they were\nstationed before the war. The crowd, habituated to long detentions,\nwas accustomed to getting out and settling down before the motionless\nlocomotive, or scattering through the nearby fields.\n\nIn the stations of any importance all the tracks were occupied by rows\nof cars. High-pressure engines were whistling, impatient to be off.\nGroups of soldiers were hesitating before the different trains, making\nmistakes, getting out of one coach to enter others. The employees, calm\nbut weary-looking, were going from side to side, giving explanations\nabout mountains of all sorts of freight and arranging them for\ntransport. In the convoy in which Desnoyers was placed the Territorials\nwere sleeping, accustomed to the monotony of acting as guard. Those in\ncharge of the horses had opened the sliding doors, seating themselves\non the floor with their legs hanging over the edge. The train went very\nslowly during the night, across shadowy fields, stopping here and there\nbefore red lanterns and announcing its presence by prolonged whistling.\n\nIn some stations appeared young girls clad in white with cockades and\npennants on their breasts. Day and night they were there, in relays,\nso that no train should pass through without a visit. They offered, in\nbaskets and trays, their gifts to the soldiers--bread, chocolate, fruit.\nMany, already surfeited, tried to resist, but had to yield eventually\nbefore the pleading countenance of the maidens. Even Desnoyers was laden\ndown with these gifts of patriotic enthusiasm.\n\nHe passed a great part of the night talking with his travelling\ncompanions. Only the officers had vague directions as to where they were\nto meet their regiments, for the operations of war were daily changing\nthe situation. Faithful to duty, they were passing on, hoping to arrive\nin time for the decisive combat. The Chief of the Guard had been\nover the ground, and was the only one able to give any account of\nthe retreat. After each stop the train made less progress. Everybody\nappeared confused. Why the retreat? . . . The army had undoubtedly\nsuffered reverses, but it was still united and, in his opinion, ought to\nseek an engagement where it was. The retreat was leaving the advance\nof the enemy unopposed. To what point were they going to retreat? . . .\nThey who two weeks before were discussing in their garrisons the place\nin Belgium where their adversaries were going to receive their death\nblow and through what places their victorious troops would invade\nGermany! . . .\n\nTheir admission of the change of tactics did not reveal the slightest\ndiscouragement. An indefinite but firm hope was hovering triumphantly\nabove their vacillations. The Generalissimo was the only one who\npossessed the secret of events. And Desnoyers approved with the blind\nenthusiasm inspired by those in whom we have confidence. Joffre! . . .\nThat serious and calm leader would finally bring things out all right.\nNobody ought to doubt his ability; he was the kind of man who always\nsays the decisive word.\n\nAt daybreak Don Marcelo left the train. \"Good luck to you!\" And he\nclasped the hands of the brave young fellows who were going to die,\nperhaps in a very short time. Finding the road unexpectedly open, the\ntrain started immediately and Desnoyers found himself alone in the\nstation. In normal times a branch road would have taken him on to\nVilleblanche, but the service was now suspended for lack of a train\ncrew. The employees had been transferred to the lines crowded with the\nwar transportation.\n\nIn vain he sought, with most generous offers, a horse, a simple cart\ndrawn by any kind of old beast, in order to continue his trip.\nThe mobilization had appropriated the best, and all other means of\ntransportation had disappeared with the flight of the terrified. He\nwould have to walk the eight miles. The old man did not hesitate.\nForward March! And he began his course along the dusty, straight, white\nhighway running between an endless succession of plains. Some groups\nof trees, some green hedges and the roofs of various farms broke the\nmonotony of the countryside. The fields were covered with stubble from\nthe recent harvest. The haycocks dotted the ground with their yellowish\ncones, now beginning to darken and take on a tone of oxidized gold. In\nthe valleys the birds were flitting about, shaking off the dew of dawn.\n\nThe first rays of the sun announced a very hot day. Around the hay\nstacks Desnoyers saw knots of people who were getting up, shaking out\ntheir clothes, and awaking those who were still sleeping. They were\nfugitives camping near the station in the hope that some train would\ncarry them further on, they knew not where. Some had come from far-away\ndistricts; they had heard the cannon, had seen war approaching, and\nfor several days had been going forward, directed by chance. Others,\ninfected with the contagion of panic, had fled, fearing to know the same\nhorrors. . . . Among them he saw mothers with their little ones in their\narms, and old men who could only walk with a cane in one hand and the\nother arm in that of some member of the family, and a few old women,\nwithered and motionless as mummies, who were sleeping as they were\ntrundled along in wheelbarrows. When the sun awoke this miserable band\nthey gathered themselves together with heavy step, still stiffened by\nthe night. Many were going toward the station in the hope of a train\nwhich never came, thinking that, perhaps, they might have better luck\nduring the day that was just dawning. Some were continuing their way\ndown the track, hoping that fate might be more propitious in some other\nplace.\n\nDon Marcelo walked all the morning long. The white, rectilinear ribbon\nof roadway was spotted with approaching groups that on the horizon line\nlooked like a file of ants. He did not see a single person going in his\ndirection. All were fleeing toward the South, and on meeting this city\ngentleman, well-shod, with walking stick and straw hat, going on alone\ntoward the country which they were abandoning in terror, they showed the\ngreatest astonishment. They concluded that he must be some functionary,\nsome celebrity from the Government.\n\nAt midday he was able to get a bit of bread, a little cheese and a\nbottle of white wine from a tavern near the road. The proprietor was at\nthe front, his wife sick and moaning in her bed. The mother, a rather\ndeaf old woman surrounded by her grandchildren, was watching from the\ndoorway the procession of fugitives which had been filing by for the\nlast three days. \"Monsieur, why do they flee?\" she said to Desnoyers.\n\"War only concerns the soldiers. We countryfolk have done no wrong to\nanybody, and we ought not to be afraid.\"\n\nFour hours later, on descending one of the hills that bounded the valley\nof the Marne, he saw afar the roofs of Villeblanche clustered around the\nchurch, and further on, beyond a little grove, the slatey points of the\nround towers of his castle.\n\nThe streets of the village were deserted. Only on the outer edges of the\nsquare did he see some old women sitting as in the placid evenings\nof bygone summers. Half of the neighborhood had fled; the others were\nstaying by their firesides through sedentary routine, or deceiving\nthemselves with a blind optimism. If the Prussians should approach,\nwhat could they do to them? . . . They would obey their orders without\nattempting any resistance, and it is impossible to punish people who\nobey. . . . Anything would be preferable to losing the homes built by\ntheir forefathers which they had never left.\n\nIn the square he saw the mayor and the principal inhabitants grouped\ntogether. Like the women, they all stared in astonishment at the owner\nof the castle. He was the most unexpected of apparitions. While so many\nwere fleeing toward Paris, this Parisian had come to join them and share\nin their fate. A smile of affection, a look of sympathy began to appear\non the rough, bark-like countenances of the suspicious rustics. For a\nlong time Desnoyers had been on bad terms with the entire village. He\nhad harshly insisted on his rights, showing no tolerance in matters\ntouching his property. He had spoken many times of bringing suit against\nthe mayor and sending half of the neighborhood to prison, so his enemies\nhad retaliated by treacherously invading his lands, poaching in his\nhunting preserves, and causing him great trouble with counter-suits and\ninvolved claims. His hatred of the community had even united him with\nthe priest because he was on terms of permanent hostility with the\nmayor. But his relations with the Church turned out as fruitless as his\nstruggles with the State. The priest was a kindly old soul who bore a\ncertain resemblance to Renan, and seemed interested only in getting alms\nfor his poor out of Don Marcelo, even carrying his good-natured boldness\nso far as to try to excuse the marauders on his property.\n\nHow remote these struggles of a few months ago now seemed to him! . . .\nThe millionaire was greatly surprised to see the priest, on leaving his\nhouse to enter the church, greet the mayor as he passed, with a friendly\nsmile.\n\nAfter long years of hostile silence they had met on the evening of\nAugust first at the foot of the church tower. The bell was ringing the\nalarm, announcing the mobilization to the men who were in the field--and\nthe two enemies had instinctively clasped hands. All French! This\naffectionate unanimity also came to meet the detested owner of the\ncastle. He had to exchange greetings first on one side, then on the\nother, grasping many a horny hand. Behind his back the people broke\nout into kindly excuses--\"A good man, with no fault except a little bad\ntemper. . . .\" And in a few minutes Monsieur Desnoyers was basking in\nthe delightful atmosphere of popularity.\n\nAs the iron-willed old gentleman approached his castle he concluded\nthat, although the fatigue of the long walk was making his knees\ntremble, the trip had been well worth while. Never had his park appeared\nto him so extensive and so majestic as in that summer twilight, never\nso glistening white the swans that were gliding double over the quiet\nwaters, never so imposing the great group of towers whose inverted\nimages were repeated in the glassy green of the moats. He felt eager to\nsee at once the stables with their herds of animals; then a brief glance\nshowed him that the stalls were comparatively empty. Mobilization had\ncarried off his best work horses; the driving and riding horses also had\ndisappeared. Those in charge of the grounds and the various stable\nboys were also in the army. The Warden, a man upwards of fifty and\nconsumptive, was the only one of the personnel left at the castle. With\nhis wife and daughter he was keeping the mangers filled, and from time\nto time was milking the neglected cows.\n\nWithin the noble edifice he again congratulated himself on the\nadamantine will which had brought him thither. How could he ever give\nup such riches! . . . He gloated over the paintings, the crystals, the\ndraperies, all bathed in gold by the splendor of the dying day, and he\nfelt more than proud to be their possessor. This pride awakened in him\nan absurd, impossible courage, as though he were a gigantic being from\nanother planet, and all humanity merely an ant hill that he could grind\nunder foot. Just let the enemy come! He could hold his own against the\nwhole lot! . . . Then, when his common sense brought him out of his\nheroic delirium, he tried to calm himself with an equally illogical\noptimism. They would not come. He did not know why it was, but his heart\ntold him that they would not get that far.\n\nHe passed the following morning reconnoitering the artificial meadows\nthat he had made behind the park, lamenting their neglected condition\ndue to the departure of the men, trying himself to open the sluice gates\nso as to give some water to the pasture lands which were beginning to\ndry up. The grape vines were extending their branches the length of\ntheir supports, and the full bunches, nearly ripe, were beginning to\nshow their triangular lusciousness among the leaves. Ay, who would\ngather this abundant fruit! . . .\n\nBy afternoon he noted an extraordinary amount of movement in the\nvillage. Georgette, the Warden's daughter, brought the news that many\nenormous automobiles and soldiers, French soldiers, were beginning\nto pass through the main street. In a little while a procession began\nfiling past on the high road near the castle, leading to the bridge\nover the Marne. This was composed of motor trucks, open and closed, that\nstill had their old commercial signs under their covering of dust and\nspots of mud. Many of them displayed the names of business firms\nin Paris, others the names of provincial establishments. With these\nindustrial vehicles requisitioned by mobilization were others from the\npublic service which produced in Desnoyers the same effect as a familiar\nface in a throng of strangers. On their upper parts were the names of\ntheir old routes:--\"Madeleine-Bastille, Passy-Bourne,\" etc. Probably he\nhad travelled many times in these very vehicles, now shabby and aged by\ntwenty days of intense activity, with dented planks and twisted metal,\nperforated like sieves, but rattling crazily on.\n\nSome of the conveyances displayed white discs with a red cross in the\ncenter; others had certain letters and figures comprehensible only to\nthose initiates in the secrets of military administration. Within\nthese vehicles--the only new and strong motors--he saw soldiers, many\nsoldiers, but all wounded, with head and legs bandaged, ashy faces made\nstill more tragic by their growing beards, feverish eyes looking fixedly\nahead, mouths so sadly immobile that they seemed carven by agonizing\ngroans. Doctors and nurses were occupying various carriages in this\nconvoy escorted by several platoons of horsemen. And mingled with\nthe slowly moving horses and automobiles were marching groups of\nfoot-soldiers, with cloaks unbuttoned or hanging from their shoulders\nlike capes--wounded men who were able to walk and joke and sing, some\nwith arms in splints across their breasts, others with bandaged heads\nwith clotted blood showing through the thin white strips.\n\nThe millionaire longed to do something for these brave fellows, but he\nhad hardly begun to distribute some bottles of wine and loaves of bread\nbefore a doctor interposed, upbraiding him as though he had committed\na crime. His gifts might result fatally. So he had to stand beside the\nroad, sad and helpless, looking after the sorrowful convoy. . . . By\nnightfall the vehicles filled with the sick were no longer filing by.\n\nHe now saw hundreds of drays, some hermetically sealed with the prudence\nthat explosive material requires, others with bundles and boxes that\nwere sending out a stale odor of provisions. Then came great herds of\ncattle raising thick, whirling clouds of dust in the narrow parts of the\nroad, prodded on by the sticks and yells of the shepherds in kepis.\n\nHis thoughts kept him wakeful all night. This, then, was the retreat of\nwhich the people of Paris were talking, but in which many wished not to\nbelieve--the retreat reaching even there and continuing its indefinite\nretirement, since nobody knew what its end might be. . . . His optimism\naroused a ridiculous hope. Perhaps this was only the retreat of the\nhospitals and stores which always follows an army. The troops, wishing\nto be rid of impedimenta, were sending them forward by railway and\nhighway. That must be it. So all through the night, he interpreted the\nincessant bustle as the passing of vehicles filled with the wounded,\nwith munitions and eatables, like those which had filed by in the\nafternoon.\n\nToward morning he fell asleep through sheer weariness, and when he awoke\nlate in the day his first glance was toward the road. He saw it filled\nwith men and horses dragging some rolling objects. But these men were\ncarrying guns and were formed in battalions and regiments. The animals\nwere pulling the pieces of artillery. It was an army. . . . It was the\nretreat!\n\nDesnoyers ran to the edge of the road to be more convinced of the truth.\n\nAlas, they were regiments such as he had seen leaving the stations of\nParis. . . . But with what a very different aspect! The blue cloaks were\nnow ragged and yellowing garments, the trousers faded to the color of\na half-baked brick, the shoes great cakes of mud. The faces had a\ndesperate expression, with layers of dust and sweat in all their grooves\nand openings, with beards of recent growth, sharp as spikes, with an air\nof great weariness showing the longing to drop down somewhere forever,\nkilling or dying, but without going a step further. They were tramping\n. . . tramping . . . tramping! Some marches had lasted thirty hours at\na stretch. The enemy was on their tracks, and the order was to go on\nand not to fight, freeing themselves by their fleet-footedness from the\ninvolved movements of the invader.\n\nThe chiefs suspected the discouraged exhaustion of their men. They might\nexact of them complete sacrifice of life--but to order them to march day\nand night, forever fleeing before the enemy when they did not consider\nthemselves vanquished, when they were animated by that ferocious wrath\nwhich is the mother of heroism! . . . Their despairing expressions\nmutely sought the nearest officers, the leaders, even the colonel. They\nsimply could go no further! Such a long, devastating march in such a few\ndays, and what for? . . . The superior officers, who knew no more\nthan their men, seemed to be replying with their eyes, as though they\npossessed a secret--\"Courage! One more effort! . . . This is going to\ncome to an end very soon.\"\n\nThe vigorous beasts, having no imagination, were resisting less than the\nmen, but their aspect was deplorable. How could these be the same strong\nhorses with glossy coats that he had seen in the Paris processions at\nthe beginning of the previous month? A campaign of twenty days had aged\nand exhausted them; their dull gaze seemed to be imploring pity. They\nwere weak and emaciated, the outline of their skeletons so plainly\napparent that it made their eyes look larger. Their harness, as they\nmoved, showed the skin raw and bleeding. Yet they were pushing on with a\nmighty effort, concentrating their last powers, as though human demands\nwere beyond their obscure instincts. Some could go no further and\nsuddenly collapsed from sheer fatigue. Desnoyers noticed that the\nartillerymen rapidly unharnessed them, pushing them out of the road\nso as to leave the way open for the rest. There lay the skeleton-like\nframes with stiffened legs and glassy eyes staring fixedly at the first\nflies already attracted by their miserable carrion.\n\nThe cannons painted gray, the gun-carriages, the artillery equipment,\nall that Don Marcelo had seen clean and shining with the enthusiastic\nfriction that man has given to arms from remote epochs--even more\npersistent than that which woman gives to household utensils--were now\ndirty, overlaid with the marks of endless use, with the wreckage of\nunavoidable neglect. The wheels were deformed with mud, the metal\ndarkened by the smoke of explosion, the gray paint spotted with mossy\ndampness.\n\nIn the free spaces in this file, in the parentheses opened between\nbattery and regiment, were sandwiched crowds of civilians--miserable\ngroups driven on by the invasion, populations of entire towns that had\ndisintegrated, following the army in its retreat. The approach of a new\ndivision would make them leave the road temporarily, continuing their\nmarch in the adjoining fields. Then at the slightest opening in the\ntroops they would again slip along the white and even surface of the\nhighway. They were mothers who were pushing hand-carts heaped high with\npyramids of furniture and tiny babies, the sick who could hardly drag\nthemselves along, old men carried on the shoulders of their grandsons,\nold women with little children clinging to their skirts--a pitiful,\nsilent brood.\n\nNobody now opposed the liberality of the owner of the castle. His entire\nvintage seemed to be overflowing on the highway. Casks from the last\ngrape-gathering were rolled out to the roadside, and the soldiers filled\nthe metal ladles hanging from their belts with the red stream. Then\nthe bottled wine began making its appearance by order of date, and was\ninstantly lost in the river of men continually flowing by. Desnoyers\nobserved with much satisfaction the effects of his munificence. The\nsmiles were reappearing on the despairing faces, the French jest was\nleaping from row to row, and on resuming their march the groups began to\nsing.\n\nThen he went to see the officers who in the village square were giving\ntheir horses a brief rest before rejoining their columns. With perplexed\ncountenances and heavy eyes they were talking among themselves about\nthis retreat, so incomprehensible to them all. Days before in Guise they\nhad routed their pursuers, and yet now they were continually withdrawing\nin obedience to a severe and endless order. \"We do not understand it,\"\nthey were saying. \"We do not understand.\" An ordered and methodical tide\nwas dragging back these men who wanted to fight, yet had to retreat. All\nwere suffering the same cruel doubt. \"We do not understand.\"\n\nAnd doubt was making still more distressing this day-and-night march\nwith only the briefest rests--because the heads of the divisions were\nin hourly fear of being cut off from the rest of the army. \"One\neffort more, boys! Courage! Soon we shall rest!\" The columns in their\nretirement were extending hundreds of miles. Desnoyers was seeing only\none division. Others and still others were doing exactly this same thing\nat that very hour, their recessional extending across half of France.\nAll, with the same disheartened obedience, were falling back, the men\nexclaiming the same as the officials, \"We don't understand. We don't\nunderstand!\"\n\nDon Marcelo soon felt the same sadness and bewilderment as these\nsoldiers. He didn't understand, either. He saw the obvious thing,\nwhat all were able to see--the territory invaded without the Germans\nencountering any stubborn resistance;--entire counties, cities,\nvillages, hamlets remaining in the power of the enemy, at the back of an\narmy that was constantly withdrawing. His enthusiasm suddenly collapsed\nlike a pricked balloon, and all his former pessimism returned. The\ntroops were displaying energy and discipline; but what did that amount\nto if they had to keep retreating all the time, unable on account\nof strict orders to fight or defend the land? \"Just as it was in the\n'70's,\" he sighed. \"Outwardly there is more order, but the result is\ngoing to be the same.\"\n\nAs though a negative reply to his faint-heartedness, he overheard the\nvoice of a soldier reassuring a farmer: \"We are retreating, yes--only\nthat we may pounce upon the Boches with more strength. Grandpa Joffre is\ngoing to put them in his pocket when and where he will.\"\n\nThe mere sound of the Marshal's name revived Don Marcelo's hope.\nPerhaps this soldier, who was keeping his faith intact in spite of the\ninterminable and demoralizing marches, was nearer the truth than the\nreasoning and studious officers.\n\nHe passed the rest of the day making presents to the last detachments of\nthe column. His wine cellars were gradually emptying. By order of\ndates, he continued distributing thousands of bottles stored in the\nsubterranean parts of the castle. By evening he was giving to those who\nappeared weakest bottles covered with the dust of many years. As the\nlines filed by the men seemed weaker and more exhausted. Stragglers were\nnow passing, painfully drawing their raw and bleeding feet from their\nshoes. Some had already freed themselves from these torture cases\nand were marching barefoot, with their heavy boots hanging from their\nshoulders, and staining the highway with drops of blood. Although\nstaggering with deadly fatigue, they kept their arms and outfits,\nbelieving that the enemy was near.\n\nDesnoyers' liberality stupefied many of them. They were accustomed to\ncrossing their native soil, having to struggle with the selfishness of\nthe producer. Nobody had been offering anything. Fear of danger had made\nthe country folk hide their eatables and refuse to lend the slightest\naid to their compatriots who were fighting for them.\n\nThe millionaire slept badly this second night in his pompous bed with\ncolumns and plushes that had belonged to Henry IV--according to the\ndeclarations of the salesmen. The troops no longer were marching past.\nFrom time to time there straggled by a single battalion, a battery,\na group of horsemen--the last forces of the rear guard that had taken\ntheir position on the outskirts of the village in order to cover\nthe retreat. The profound silence that followed the turmoil of\ntransportation awoke in his mind a sense of doubt and disquietude.\nWhat was he doing there when the soldiers had gone? Was he not crazy to\nremain there? . . . But immediately there came galloping into his mind\nthe great riches which the castle contained. If he could only take it\nall away! . . . That was impossible now through want of means and\ntime. Besides, his stubborn will looked upon such flight as a shameful\nconcession. \"We must finish what we have begun!\" he said to himself. He\nhad made the trip on purpose to guard his own, and he must not flee at\nthe approach of danger. . . .\n\nThe following morning, when he went down into the village, he saw hardly\nany soldiers. Only a single detachment of dragoons was still in the\nneighborhood; the horsemen were scouring the woods and pushing forward\nthe stragglers at the same time that they were opposing the advance of\nthe enemy. The troopers had obstructed the street with a barricade\nof carts and furniture. Standing behind this crude barrier, they were\nwatching the white strip of roadway which ran between the two hills\ncovered with trees. Occasionally there sounded stray shots like the\nsnapping of cords. \"Ours,\" said the troopers. These were the last\ndetachments of sharpshooters firing at the advancing Uhlans. The cavalry\nof the rear guard had the task of opposing a continual resistance to the\nenemy, repelling the squads of Germans who were trying to work their way\nalong to the retreating columns.\n\nDesnoyers saw approaching along the highroad the last stragglers from\nthe infantry. They were not walking, they rather appeared to be dragging\nthemselves forward, with the firm intention of advancing, but were\nbetrayed by emaciated legs and bleeding feet. Some had sunk down for\na moment by the roadside, agonized with weariness, in order to breathe\nwithout the weight of their knapsacks, and draw their swollen feet from\ntheir leather prisons, and wipe off the sweat; but upon trying to renew\ntheir march, they found it impossible to rise. Their bodies seemed made\nof stone. Fatigue had brought them to a condition bordering on catalepsy\nso, unable to move, they were seeing dimly the rest of the army passing\non as a fantastic file--battalions, more battalions, batteries, troops\nof horses. Then the silence, the night, the sleep on the stones and\ndust, shaken by most terrible nightmare. At daybreak they were awakened\nby bodies of horsemen exploring the ground, rounding up the remnants of\nthe retreat. Ay, it was impossible to move! The dragoons, revolver\nin hand, had to resort to threats in order to rouse them! Only the\ncertainty that the pursuer was near and might make them prisoners gave\nthem a momentary vigor. So they were forcing themselves up by superhuman\neffort, staggering, dragging their legs, and supporting themselves on\ntheir guns as though they were canes.\n\nMany of these were young men who had aged in an hour and changed into\nconfirmed invalids. Poor fellows! They would not go very far! Their\nintention was to follow on, to join the column, but on entering the\nvillage they looked at the houses with supplicating eyes, desiring to\nenter them, feeling such a craving for immediate relief that they forgot\neven the nearness of the enemy.\n\nVilleblanche was now more military than before the arrival of the\ntroops. The night before a great part of the inhabitants had fled,\nhaving become infected with the same fear that was driving on the crowds\nfollowing the army. The mayor and the priest remained. Reconciled with\nthe owner of the castle through his unexpected presence in their midst,\nand admiring his liberality, the municipal official approached to give\nhim some news. The engineers were mining the bridge over the Marne. They\nwere only waiting for the dragoons to cross before blowing it up. If he\nwished to go, there was still time.\n\nAgain Desnoyers hesitated. Certainly it was foolhardy to remain there.\nBut a glance at the woods over whose branches rose the towers of his\ncastle, settled his doubts. No, no. . . . \"We must finish what we have\nbegun!\"\n\nThe very last band of troopers now made their appearance, coming out of\nthe woods by different paths. They were riding their horses slowly, as\nthough they deplored this retreat. They kept looking behind, carbine\nin hand, ready to halt and shoot. The others who had been occupying\nthe barricade were already on their mounts. The division reformed, the\ncommands of the officers were heard and a quick trot, accompanied by the\nclanking of metal, told Don Marcelo that the last of the army had left.\n\nHe remained near the barricade in a solitude of intense silence, as\nthough the world were suddenly depopulated. Two dogs, abandoned by the\nflight of their masters, leaped and sniffed around him, coaxing him\nfor protection. They were unable to get the desired scent in that land\ntrodden down and disfigured by the transit of thousands of men. A\nfamily cat was watching the birds that were beginning to return to their\nhaunts. With timid flutterings they were picking at what the horses had\nleft, and an ownerless hen was disputing the banquet with the winged\nband, until then hidden in the trees and roofs. The silence intensified\nthe rustling of the leaves, the hum of the insects, the summer\nrespiration of the sunburnt soil which appeared to have contracted\ntimorously under the weight of the men in arms.\n\nDesnoyers was losing exact track of the passing of time. He was\nbeginning to believe that all which had gone before must have been a bad\ndream. The calm surrounding him made what had been happening here seem\nmost improbable.\n\nSuddenly he saw something moving at the far end of the road, at the very\nhighest point where the white ribbon of the highway touched the blue of\nthe horizon. There were two men on horseback, two little tin soldiers\nwho appeared to have escaped from a box of toys. He had brought with\nhim a pair of field glasses that had often surprised marauders on his\nproperty, and by their aid he saw more clearly the two riders clad in\ngreenish gray! They were carrying lances and wearing helmets ending in a\nhorizontal plate . . . They! He could not doubt it: before his eyes were\nthe first Uhlans!\n\nFor some time they remained motionless, as though exploring the horizon.\nThen, from the obscure masses of vegetation that bordered the roadside,\nothers and still others came sallying forth in groups. The little tin\nsoldiers no longer were showing their silhouettes against the horizon's\nblue; the whiteness of the highway was now making their background,\nascending behind their heads. They came slowly down, like a band that\nfears ambush, examining carefully everything around.\n\nThe advisability of prompt retirement made Don Marcelo bring his\ninvestigations to a close. It would be most disastrous for him if they\nsurprised him here. But on lowering his glasses something extraordinary\npassed across his field of vision. A short distance away, so that he\ncould almost touch them with his hand, he saw many men skulking along\nin the shadow of the trees on both sides of the road. His surprise\nincreased as he became convinced that they were Frenchmen, wearing\nkepis. Where were they coming from? . . . He examined more closely with\nhis spy glass. They were stragglers in a lamentable state of body and\na picturesque variety of uniforms--infantry, Zouaves, dragoons without\ntheir horses. And with them were forest guards and officers from the\nvillages that had received too late the news of the retreat--altogether\nabout fifty. A few were fresh and vigorous, others were keeping\nthemselves up by supernatural effort. All were carrying arms.\n\nThey finally made the barricade, looking continually behind them, in\norder to watch, in the shelter of the trees, the slow advance of the\nUhlans. At the head of this heterogeneous troop was an official of the\npolice, old and fat, with a revolver in his right hand, his moustache\nbristling with excitement, and a murderous glitter in his heavy-lidded\nblue eyes. The band was continuing its advance through the village,\nslipping over to the other side of the barricade of carts without paying\nmuch attention to their curious countryman, when suddenly sounded a loud\ndetonation, making the horizon vibrate and the houses tremble.\n\n\"What is that?\" asked the officer, looking at Desnoyers for the first\ntime. He explained that it was the bridge which had just been blown up.\nThe leader received the news with an oath, but his confused followers,\nbrought together by chance, remained as indifferent as though they had\nlost all contact with reality.\n\n\"Might as well die here as anywhere,\" continued the official. Many of\nthe fugitives acknowledged this decision with prompt obedience, since\nit saved them the torture of continuing their march. They were\nalmost rejoicing at the explosion which had cut off their progress.\nInstinctively they were gathering in the places most sheltered by the\nbarricade. Some entered the abandoned houses whose doors the dragoons\nhad forced in order to utilize the upper floors. All seemed satisfied to\nbe able to rest, even though they might soon have to fight. The officer\nwent from group to group giving his orders. They must not fire till he\ngave the word.\n\nDon Marcelo watched these preparations with the immovability of\nsurprise. So rapid and noiseless had been the apparition of the\nstragglers that he imagined he must still be dreaming. There could be\nno danger in this unreal situation; it was all a lie. And he remained\nin his place without understanding the deputy who was ordering his\ndeparture with roughest words. Obstinate civilian! . . .\n\nThe reverberation of the explosion had filled the highway with horsemen.\nThey were coming from all directions, forming themselves into the\nadvance group. The Uhlans were galloping around under the impression\nthat the village was abandoned.\n\n\"Fire!\"\n\nDesnoyers was enveloped in a rain of crackling noises, as though the\ntrunks of all the trees had split before his eyes.\n\nThe impetuous band halted suddenly. Some of their men were rolling on\nthe ground. Some were bending themselves double, trying to get across\nthe road without being seen. Others remained stretched out on their\nbacks or face downward with their arms in front. The riderless horses\nwere racing wildly across the fields with reins dragging, urged on by\nthe loose stirrups.\n\nAnd after this rude shock which had brought them surprise and death, the\nband disappeared, instantly swallowed up by the trees.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nNEAR THE SACRED GROTTO\n\n\nArgensola had found a new occupation even more exciting than marking out\non the map the manoeuvres of the armies.\n\n\"I am now devoting myself to the taube,\" he announced. \"It appears from\nfour to five with the precision a punctilious guest coming to take tea.\"\n\nEvery afternoon at the appointed hour, a German aeroplane was flying\nover Paris dropping bombs. This would-be intimidation was producing\nno terror, the people accepting the visit as an interesting and\nextraordinary spectacle. In vain the aviators were flinging in the city\nstreets German flags bearing ironic messages, giving accounts of the\ndefeat of the retreating army and the failures of the Russian offensive.\nLies, all lies! In vain they were dropping bombs, destroying garrets,\nkilling or wounding old men, women and babes. \"Ah, the bandits!\" The\ncrowds would threaten with their fists the malign mosquito, scarcely\nvisible 6,000 feet above them, and after this outburst, they would\nfollow it with straining eyes from street to street, or stand motionless\nin the square in order to study its evolutions.\n\nThe most punctual of all the spectators was Argensola. At four o'clock\nhe was in the place de la Concorde with upturned face and wide-open\neyes, in most cordial good-fellowship with all the bystanders. It was\nas though they were holding season tickets at the same theatre, becoming\nacquainted through seeing each other so often. \"Will it come? . . . Will\nit not come to-day?\" The women appeared to be the most vehement, some\nof them rushing up, flushed and breathless, fearing that they might have\narrived too late for the show. . . . A great cry--\"There it comes! . . .\nThere it is!\" And thousands of hands were pointing to a vague spot on\nthe horizon. With field glasses and telescopes they were aiding their\nvision, the popular venders offering every kind of optical instruments\nand for an hour the thrilling spectacle of an aerial hunt was played\nout, noisy and useless.\n\nThe great insect was trying to reach the Eiffel Tower, and from its base\nwould come sharp reports, at the same time that the different platforms\nspit out a fierce stream of shrapnel. As it zigzagged over the city, the\ndischarge of rifles would crackle from roof and street. Everyone that\nhad arms in his house was firing--the soldiers of the guard, and the\nEnglish and Belgians on their way through Paris. They knew that their\nshots were perfectly useless, but they were firing for the fun of\nretorting, hoping at the same time that one of their chance shots might\nachieve a miracle; but the only miracle was that the shooters did not\nkill each other with their precipitate and ineffectual fire. As it was,\na few passers-by did fall, wounded by balls from unknown sources.\n\nArgensola would tear from street to street following the evolutions of\nthe inimical bird, trying to guess where its projectiles would fall,\nanxious to be the first to reach the bombarded house, excited by the\nshots that were answering from below. And to think that he had no gun\nlike those khaki-clad Englishmen or those Belgians in barrick cap, with\ntassel over the front! . . . Finally the taube tired of manoeuvering,\nwould disappear. \"Until to-morrow!\" ejaculated the Spaniard. \"Perhaps\nto-morrow's show may be even more interesting!\"\n\nHe employed his free hours between his geographical observations and his\naerial contemplations in making the rounds of the stations, watching the\ncrowds of travellers making their escape from Paris. The sudden vision\nof the truth--after the illusion which the Government had been creating\nwith its optimistic dispatches, the certainty that the Germans were\nactually near when a week before they had imagined them completely\nrouted, the taubes flying over Paris, the mysterious threat of the\nZeppelins--all these dangerous signs were filling a part of the\ncommunity with frenzied desperation. The railroad stations, guarded\nby the soldiery, were only admitting those who had secured tickets in\nadvance. Some had been waiting entire days for their turn to depart. The\nmost impatient were starting to walk, eager to get outside of the city\nas soon as possible. The roads were black with the crowds all going in\nthe same directions. Toward the South they were fleeing by automobile,\nin carriages, in gardeners' carts, on foot.\n\nArgensola surveyed this hegira with serenity. He would remain because he\nhad always admired those men who witnessed the Siege of Paris in 1870.\nNow it was going to be his good fortune to observe an historical drama,\nperhaps even more interesting. The wonders that he would be able to\nrelate in the future! . . . But the distraction and indifference of his\npresent audience were annoying him greatly. He would hasten back to the\nstudio, in feverish excitement, to communicate the latest gratifying\nnews to Desnoyers who would listen as though he did not hear him.\nThe night that he informed him that the Government, the Chambers, the\nDiplomatic Corps, and even the actors of the Comedie Francaise were\ngoing that very hour on special trains for Bordeaux, his companion\nmerely replied with a shrug of indifference.\n\nDesnoyers was worrying about other things. That morning he had received\na note from Marguerite--only two lines scrawled in great haste. She was\nleaving, starting immediately, accompanied by her mother. Adieu! . . .\nand nothing more. The panic had caused many love-affairs to be\nforgotten, had broken off long intimacies, but Marguerite's temperament\nwas above such incoherencies from mere flight. Julio felt that her\nterseness was very ominous. Why not mention the place to which she was\ngoing? . . .\n\nIn the afternoon, he took a bold step which she had always forbidden. He\nwent to her home and talked a long time with the concierge in order\nto get some news. The good woman was delighted to work off on him the\nloquacity so brusquely cut short by the flight of tenants and servants.\nThe lady on the first floor (Marguerite's mother) had been the last to\nabandon the house in spite of the fact that she was really sick over her\nson's departure. They had left the day before without saying where they\nwere going. The only thing that she knew was that they took the train in\nthe Gare d'Orsay. They were going toward the South like all the rest of\nthe rich.\n\nAnd she supplemented her revelations with the vague news that the\ndaughter had seemed very much upset by the information that she had\nreceived from the front. Someone in the family was wounded. Perhaps it\nwas the brother, but she really didn't know. With so many surprises and\nstrange things happening, it was difficult to keep track of everything.\nHer husband, too, was in the army and she had her own affairs to worry\nabout.\n\n\"Where can she have gone?\" Julio asked himself all day long. \"Why does\nshe wish to keep me in ignorance of her whereabouts?\"\n\nWhen his comrade told him that night about the transfer of the seat of\ngovernment, with all the mystery of news not yet made public, Desnoyers\nmerely replied:\n\n\"They are doing the best thing. . . . I, too, will go tomorrow if I\ncan.\"\n\nWhy remain longer in Paris? His family was away. His father, according\nto Argensola's investigations, also had gone off without saying whither.\nNow Marguerite's mysterious flight was leaving him entirely alone, in a\nsolitude that was filling him with remorse.\n\nThat afternoon, when strolling through the boulevards, he had stumbled\nacross a friend considerably older than himself, an acquaintance in the\nfencing club which he used to frequent. This was the first time they had\nmet since the beginning of the war, and they ran over the list of their\ncompanions in the army. Desnoyers' inquiries were answered by the older\nman. So-and-so? . . . He had been wounded in Lorraine and was now in\na hospital in the South. Another friend? . . . Dead in the Vosges.\nAnother? . . . Disappeared at Charleroi. And thus had continued the\nheroic and mournful roll-call. The others were still living, doing brave\nthings. The members of foreign birth, young Poles, English residents in\nParis and South Americans, had finally enlisted as volunteers. The club\nmight well be proud of its young men who had practised arms in times of\npeace, for now they were all jeopardizing their existence at the front.\nDesnoyers turned his face away as though he feared to meet in the eyes\nof his friend, an ironical and questioning expression. Why had he not\ngone with the others to defend the land in which he was living? . . .\n\n\"To-morrow I will go,\" repeated Julio, depressed by this recollection.\n\nBut he went toward the South like all those who were fleeing from the\nwar. The following morning Argensola was charged to get him a railroad\nticket for Bordeaux. The value of money had greatly increased, but fifty\nfrancs, opportunely bestowed, wrought the miracle and procured a bit of\nnumbered cardboard whose conquest represented many days of waiting.\n\n\"It is good only for to-day,\" said the Spaniard, \"you will have to take\nthe night train.\"\n\nPacking was not a very serious matter, as the trains were refusing to\nadmit anything more than hand-luggage. Argensola did not wish to accept\nthe liberality of Julio who tried to leave all his money with him.\nHeroes need very little and the painter of souls was inspired with\nheroic resolution, The brief harangue of Gallieni in taking charge of\nthe defense of Paris, he had adopted as his own. He intended to keep up\nhis courage to the last, just like the hardy general.\n\n\"Let them come,\" he exclaimed with a tragic expression. \"They will find\nme at my post!\" . . .\n\nHis post was the studio from which he could witness the happenings which\nhe proposed relating to coming generations. He would entrench himself\nthere with the eatables and wines. Besides he had the plan--just as\nsoon as his partner should disappear--of bringing to live there with\nhim certain lady-friends who were wandering around in search of a\nproblematical dinner, and feeling timid in the solitude of their own\nquarters. Danger often gathers congenial folk together and adds a new\nattractiveness to the pleasures of a community. The tender affections of\nthe prisoners of the Terror, when they were expecting momentarily to\nbe conducted to the guillotine, flashed through his mind. Let us drain\nLife's goblet at one draught since we have to die! . . . The studio of\nthe rue de la Pompe was about to witness the mad and desperate revels of\na castaway bark well-stocked with provisions.\n\nDesnoyers left the Gare d'Orsay in a first-class compartment, mentally\npraising the good order with which the authorities had arranged\neverything, so that every traveller could have his own seat. At the\nAusterlitz station, however, a human avalanche assaulted the train.\nThe doors were broken open, packages and children came in through the\nwindows like projectiles. The people pushed with the unreason of a crowd\nfleeing before a fire. In the space reserved for eight persons, fourteen\ninstalled themselves; the passageways were heaped with mountains of\nbags and valises that served later travellers for seats. All class\ndistinctions had disappeared. The villagers invaded by preference the\nbest coaches, believing that they would there find more room. Those\nholding first-class tickets hunted up the plainer coaches in the vain\nhope of travelling without being crowded. On the cross roads were\nwaiting from the day before long trains made up of cattle cars. All the\nstables on wheels were filled with people seated on the wooden floor or\nin chairs brought from their homes. Every train load was an encampment\neager to take up its march; whenever it halted, layers of greasy papers,\nhulls and fruit skins collected along its entire length.\n\nThe invaders, pushing their way in, put up with many annoyances and\npardoned one another in a brotherly way. \"In war times, war measures,\"\nthey would always say as a last excuse. And each one was pressing closer\nto his neighbor in order to make a few more inches of room, and helping\nto wedge his scanty baggage among the other bundles swaying most\nprecariously above. Little by little, Desnoyers was losing all his\nadvantage as a first comer. These poor people who had been waiting for\nthe train from four in the morning till eight at night, awakened\nhis pity. The women, groaning with weariness, were standing in the\ncorridors, looking with ferocious envy at those who had seats. The\nchildren were bleating like hungry kids. Julio finally gave up his\nplace, sharing with the needy and improvident the bountiful supply of\neatables with which Argensola had provided him. The station restaurants\nhad all been emptied of food.\n\nDuring the train's long wait, soldiers only were seen on the platform,\nsoldiers who were hastening at the call of the trumpet, to take their\nplaces again in the strings of cars which were constantly steaming\ntoward Paris. At the signal stations, long war trains were waiting\nfor the road to be clear that they might continue their journey. The\ncuirassiers, wearing a yellow vest over their steel breastplate, were\nseated with hanging legs in the doorways of the stable cars, from whose\ninterior came repeated neighing. Upon the flat cars were rows of gun\ncarriages. The slender throats of the cannon of '75 were pointed upwards\nlike telescopes.\n\nYoung Desnoyers passed the night in the aisle, seated on a valise,\nnoting the sodden sleep of those around him, worn out by weariness and\nexhaustion. It was a cruel and endless night of jerks, shrieks and\nstops punctuated by snores. At every station, the trumpets were sounding\nprecipitously as though the enemy were right upon them. The soldiers\nfrom the South were hurrying to their posts, and at brief intervals\nanother detachment of men was dragged along the rails toward Paris. They\nall appeared gay, and anxious to reach the scene of slaughter as soon\nas possible. Many were regretting the delays, fearing that they might\narrive too late. Leaning out of the window, Julio heard the dialogues\nand shouts on the platforms impregnated with the acrid odor of men and\nmules. All were evincing an unquenchable confidence. \"The Boches! very\nnumerous, with huge cannons, with many mitrailleuse . . . but we only\nhave to charge with our bayonets to make them run like rabbits!\"\n\nThe attitude of those going to meet death was in sharp contrast to\nthe panic and doubt of those who were deserting Paris. An old\nand much-decorated gentleman, type of a jubilee functionary, kept\nquestioning Desnoyers whenever the train started on again--\"Do you\nbelieve that they will get as far as Tours?\" Before receiving his reply,\nhe would fall asleep. Brutish sleep was marching down the aisles with\nleaden feet. At every junction, the old man would start up and suddenly\nask, \"Do you believe that we will get as far as Bordeaux?\" . . . And\nhis great desire not to halt until, with his family, he had reached\nan absolutely secure refuge, made him accept as oracles all the vague\nresponses.\n\nAt daybreak, they saw the Territorialists guarding the roads. They were\narmed with old muskets, and were wearing the red kepis as their only\nmilitary distinction. They were following the opposite course of the\nmilitary trains.\n\nIn the station at Bordeaux, the civilian crowds struggling to get out\nor to enter other cars, were mingling with the troops. The trumpets were\nincessantly sounding their brazen notes, calling the soldiers together.\nMany were men of darkest coloring, natives with wide gray breeches and\nred caps above their black or bronzed faces.\n\nJulio saw a train bearing wounded from the battles of Flanders and\nLorraine. Their worn and dirty uniforms were enlivened by the whiteness\nof the bandages sustaining the wounded limbs or protecting the broken\nheads. All were trying to smile, although with livid mouths and feverish\neyes, at their first glimpse of the land of the South as it emerged from\nthe mist bathed in the sunlight, and covered with the regal vestures of\nits vineyards. The men from the North stretched out their hands for the\nfruit that the women were offering them, tasting with delight the sweet\ngrapes of the country.\n\nFor four days the distracted lover lived in Bordeaux, stunned and\nbewildered by the agitation of a provincial city suddenly converted\ninto a capital. The hotels were overcrowded, many notables contenting\nthemselves with servants' quarters. There was not a vacant seat in the\ncafes; the sidewalks could not accommodate the extraordinary assemblage.\nThe President was installed in the Prefecture; the State Departments\nwere established in the schools and museums; two theatres were fitted up\nfor the future reunions of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. Julio\nwas lodged in a filthy, disreputable hotel at the end of a foul-smelling\nalley. A little Cupid adorned the crystals of the door, and the\nlooking-glass in his room was scratched with names and unspeakable\nphrases--souvenirs of the occupants of an hour . . . and yet many grand\nladies, hunting in vain for temporary residence, would have envied him\nhis good fortune.\n\nAll his investigations proved fruitless. The friends whom he encountered\nin the fugitive crowd were thinking only of their own affairs. They\ncould talk of nothing but incidents of the installation, repeating the\nnews gathered from the ministers with whom they were living on familiar\nterms, or mentioning with a mysterious air, the great battle which was\ngoing on stretching from the vicinity of Paris to Verdun. A pupil of his\ndays of glory, whose former elegance was now attired in the uniform of a\nnurse, gave him some vague information. \"The little Madame Laurier?\n. . . I remember hearing that she was living somewhere near here. . . .\nPerhaps in Biarritz.\" Julio needed no more than this to continue his\njourney. To Biarritz!\n\nThe first person that he encountered on his arrival was Chichi. She\ndeclared that the town was impossible because of the families of rich\nSpaniards who were summering there. \"The Boches are in the majority,\nand I pass a miserable existence quarrelling with them. . . . I shall\nfinally have to live alone.\" Then he met his mother--embraces and tears.\nAfterwards he saw his Aunt Elena in the hotel parlors, most enthusiastic\nover the country and the summer colony.\n\nShe could talk at great length with many of them about the decadence of\nFrance. They were all expecting to receive the news from one moment to\nanother, that the Kaiser had entered the Capital. Ponderous men who had\nnever done anything in all their lives, were criticizing the defects\nand indolence of the Republic. Young men whose aristocracy aroused Dona\nElena's enthusiasm, broke forth into apostrophes against the corruption\nof Paris, corruption that they had studied thoroughly, from sunset to\nsunrise, in the virtuous schools of Montmartre. They all adored Germany\nwhere they had never been, or which they knew only through the reels\nof the moving picture films. They criticized events as though they were\nwitnessing a bull fight. \"The Germans have the snap! You can't fool with\nthem! They are fine brutes!\" And they appeared to admire this inhumanity\nas the most admirable characteristic. \"Why will they not say that in\ntheir own home on the other side of the frontier?\" Chichi would\nprotest. \"Why do they come into their neighbor's country to ridicule\nhis troubles? . . . Possibly they consider it a sign of their wonderful\ngood-breeding!\"\n\nBut Julio had not gone to Biarritz to live with his family. . . . The\nvery day of his arrival, he saw Marguerite's mother in the distance. She\nwas alone. His inquiries developed the information that her daughter was\nliving in Pau. She was a trained nurse taking care of a wounded member\nof the family. \"Her brother . . . undoubtedly it is her brother,\"\nthought Julio. And he again continued his trip, this time going to Pau.\n\nHis visits to the hospitals there were also unavailing. Nobody seemed\nto know Marguerite. Every day a train was arriving with a new load of\nbleeding flesh, but her brother was not among the wounded. A Sister of\nCharity, believing that he was in search of someone of his family, took\npity on him and gave him some helpful directions. He ought to go to\nLourdes; there were many of the wounded there and many of the military\nnurses. So Desnoyers immediately took the short cut between Pau and\nLourdes.\n\nHe had never visited the sacred city whose name was so frequently on\nhis mother's lips. For Dona Luisa, the French nation was Lourdes. In her\ndiscussions with her sister and other foreign ladies who were praying\nthat France might be exterminated for its impiety, the good senora\nalways summed up her opinions in the same words:--\"When the Virgin\nwished to make her appearance in our day, she chose France. This\ncountry, therefore, cannot be as bad as you say. . . . When I see that\nshe appears in Berlin, we will then re-discuss the matter.\"\n\nBut Desnoyers was not there to confirm his mother's artless opinions.\nJust as soon as he had found a room in a hotel near the river, he had\nhastened to the big hostelry, now converted into a hospital. The guard\ntold him that he could not speak to the Director until the afternoon. In\norder to curb his impatience he walked through the street leading to\nthe basilica, past all the booths and shops with pictures and pious\nsouvenirs which have converted the place into a big bazaar. Here and\nin the gardens adjoining the church, he saw wounded convalescents with\nuniforms stained with traces of the combat. Their cloaks were greatly\nsoiled in spite of repeated brushings. The mud, the blood and the rain\nhad left indelible spots and made them as stiff as cardboard. Some of\nthe wounded had cut their sleeves in order to avoid the cruel friction\non their shattered arms, others still showed on their trousers the rents\nmade by the devastating shells.\n\nThey were fighters of all ranks and of many races--infantry, cavalry,\nartillerymen; soldiers from the metropolis and from the colonies; French\nfarmers and African sharpshooters; red heads, faces of Mohammedan olive\nand the black countenances of the Sengalese, with eyes of fire, and\nthick, bluish blubber lips; some showing the good-nature and sedentary\nobesity of the middle-class man suddenly converted into a warrior;\nothers sinewy, alert, with the aggressive profile of men born to fight,\nand experienced in foreign fields.\n\nThe city, formerly visited by the hopeful, Catholic sick, was now\ninvaded by a crowd no less dolorous but clad in carnival colors. All,\nin spite of their physical distress, had a certain air of good cheer and\nsatisfaction. They had seen Death very near, slipping out from his bony\nclaws into a new joy and zest in life. With their cloaks adorned with\nmedals, their theatrical Moorish garments, their kepis and their African\nheaddresses, this heroic band presented, nevertheless, a lamentable\naspect.\n\nVery few still preserved the noble vertical carriage, the pride of\nthe superior human being. They were walking along bent almost double,\nlimping, dragging themselves forward by the help of a staff or friendly\narm. Others had to let themselves be pushed along, stretched out on the\nhand-carts which had so often conducted the devout sick from the station\nto the Grotto of the Virgin. Some were feeling their way along, blindly,\nleaning on a child or nurse. The first encounters in Belgium and in\nthe East, a mere half-dozen battles, had been enough to produce these\nphysical wrecks still showing a manly nobility in spite of the most\nhorrible outrages. These organisms, struggling so tenaciously to regain\ntheir hold on life, bringing their reviving energies out into the\nsunlight, represented but the most minute part of the number mowed down\nby the scythe of Death. Back of them were thousands and thousands of\ncomrades groaning on hospital beds from which they would probably never\nrise. Thousands and thousands were hidden forever in the bosom of the\nEarth moistened by their death agony--fatal land which, upon receiving a\nhail of projectiles, brought forth a harvest of bristling crosses!\n\nWar now showed itself to Desnoyers with all its cruel hideousness. He\nhad been accustomed to speak of it heretofore as those in robust health\nspeak of death, knowing that it exists and is horrible, but seeing it\nafar off . . . so far off that it arouses no real emotion. The explosion\nof the shells were accompanying their destructive brutality with a\nferocious mockery, grotesquely disfiguring the human body. He saw\nwounded objects just beginning to recover their vital force who were but\nrough skeletons of men, frightful caricatures, human rags, saved from\nthe tomb by the audacities of science--trunks with heads which were\ndragged along on wheeled platforms; fragments of skulls whose brains\nwere throbbing under an artificial cap; beings without arms and without\nlegs, resting in the bottom of little wagons, like bits of plaster\nmodels or scraps from the dissecting room; faces without noses that\nlooked like skulls with great, black nasal openings. And these half-men\nwere talking, smoking, laughing, satisfied to see the sky, to feel\nthe caress of the sun, to have come back to life, dominated by that\nsovereign desire to live which trustingly forgets present misery in the\nconfident hope of something better.\n\nSo strongly was Julio impressed that for a little while he forgot the\npurpose which had brought him thither. . . . If those who provoke war\nfrom diplomatic chambers or from the tables of the Military Staff could\nbut see it--not in the field of battle fired with the enthusiasm which\nprejudices judgments--but in cold blood, as it is seen in the hospitals\nand cemeteries, in the wrecks left in its trail! . . .\n\nTo Julio's imagination this terrestrial globe appeared like an enormous\nship sailing through infinity. Its crews--poor humanity--had spent\ncentury after century in exterminating each other on the deck. They did\nnot even know what existed under their feet, in the hold of the vessel.\nTo occupy the same portion of the surface in the sunlight seemed to be\nthe ruling desire of each group. Men, considered superior human beings,\nwere pushing these masses to extermination in order to scale the last\nbridge and hold the helm, controlling the course of the boat. And all\nthose who felt the overmastering ambition for absolute command knew the\nsame thing . . . nothing. Not one of them could say with certainty what\nlay beyond the visible horizon, nor whither the ship was drifting.\nThe sullen hostility of mystery surrounded them all; their life was\nprecarious, necessitating incessant care in order to maintain it, yet in\nspite of that, the crew for ages and ages, had never known an instant\nof agreement, of team work, of clear reason. Periodically half of them\nwould clash with the other half. They killed each other that they might\nenslave the vanquished on the rolling deck floating over the abyss; they\nfought that they might cast their victims from the vessel, filling\nits wake with cadavers. And from the demented throng there were still\nspringing up gloomy sophistries to prove that a state of war was the\nperfect state, that it ought to go on forever, that it was a bad dream\non the part of the crew to wish to regard each other as brothers with a\ncommon destiny, enveloped in the same unsteady environment of mystery.\n. . . Ah, human misery!\n\nJulio was drawn out of these pessimistic reflections by the childish\nglee which many of the convalescents were evincing. Some were\nMussulmans, sharpshooters from Algeria and Morocco. In Lourdes, as they\nmight be anywhere, they were interested only in the gifts which the\npeople were showering upon them with patriotic affection. They all\nsurveyed with indifference the basilica inhabited by \"the white lady,\"\ntheir only preoccupation being to beg for cigars and sweets.\n\nFinding themselves regaled by the dominant race, they became greatly\npuffed up, daring everything like mischievous children. What pleased\nthem most was the fact that the ladies would take them by the hand.\nBlessed war that permitted them to approach and touch these white women,\nperfumed and smiling as they appeared in their dreams of the paradise\nof the blest! \"Lady . . . Lady,\" they would sigh, looking at them with\ndark, sparkling eyes. And not content with the hand, their dark paws\nwould venture the length of the entire arm while the ladies laughed at\nthis tremulous adoration. Others would go through the crowds, offering\ntheir right hand to all the women. \"We touch hands.\" . . . And then they\nwould go away satisfied after receiving the hand clasp.\n\nDesnoyers wandered a long time around the basilica where, in the shadow\nof the trees, were long rows of wheeled chairs occupied by the wounded.\nOfficers and soldiers rested many hours in the blue shade, watching\ntheir comrades who were able to use their legs. The sacred grotto was\nresplendent with the lights from hundreds of candles. Devout crowds\nwere kneeling in the open air, fixing their eyes in supplication on the\nsacred stones whilst their thoughts were flying far away to the fields\nof battle, making their petitions with that confidence in divinity which\naccompanies every distress. Among the kneeling mass were many soldiers\nwith bandaged heads, kepis in hand and tearful eyes.\n\nUp and down the double staircase of the basilica were flitting women,\nclad in white, with spotless headdresses that fluttered in such a way\nthat they appeared like flying doves. These were the nurses and Sisters\nof Charity guiding the steps of the injured. Desnoyers thought he\nrecognized Marguerite in every one of them, but the prompt disillusion\nfollowing each of these discoveries soon made him doubtful about the\noutcome of his journey. She was not in Lourdes, either. He would never\nfind her in that France so immeasurably expanded by the war that it had\nconverted every town into a hospital.\n\nHis afternoon explorations were no more successful. The employees\nlistened to his interrogations with a distraught air. He could come back\nagain; just now they were taken up with the announcement that another\nhospital train was on the way. The great battle was still going on\nnear Paris. They had to improvise lodgings for the new consignment of\nmutilated humanity. In order to pass away the time until his return,\nDesnoyers went back to the garden near the grotto. He was planning to\nreturn to Pau that night; there was evidently nothing more to do at\nLourdes. In what direction should he now continue his search?\n\nSuddenly he felt a thrill down his back--the same indefinable sensation\nwhich used to warn him of her presence when they were meeting in the\ngardens of Paris. Marguerite was going to present herself unexpectedly\nas in the old days without his knowing from exactly what spot--as though\nshe came up out of the earth or descended from the clouds.\n\nAfter a second's thought he smiled bitterly. Mere tricks of his desire!\nIllusions! . . . Upon turning his head he recognized the falsity of his\nhope. Nobody was following his footsteps; he was the only being going\ndown the center of the avenue. Near him, in the diaphanous white of a\nguardian angel, was a nurse. Poor blind man! . . . Desnoyers was passing\non when a quick movement on the part of the white-clad woman, an evident\ndesire to escape notice, to hide her face by looking at the plants,\nattracted his attention. He was slow in recognizing her. Two little\nringlets escaping from the band of her cap made him guess the hidden\nhead of hair; the feet shod in white were the signs which enabled him\nto reconstruct the person somewhat disfigured by the severe uniform.\nHer face was pale and sad. There wasn't a trace left in it of the old\nvanities that used to give it its childish, doll-like beauty. In the\ndepths of those great, dark-circled eyes life seemed to be reflected in\nnew forms. . . . Marguerite!\n\nThey stared at one another for a long while, as though hypnotized with\nsurprise. She looked alarmed when Desnoyers advanced a step toward her.\nNo . . . No! Her eyes, her hands, her entire body seemed to protest, to\nrepel his approach, to hold him motionless. Fear that he might come near\nher, made her go toward him. She said a few words to the soldier who\nremained on the bench, receiving across the bandage on his face a ray of\nsunlight which he did not appear to feel. Then she rose, going to meet\nJulio, and continued forward, indicating by a gesture that they must\nfind some place further on where the wounded man could not hear them.\n\nShe led the way to a side path from which she could see the blind man\nconfided to her care. They stood motionless, face to face. Desnoyers\nwished to say many things; many . . . but he hesitated, not knowing how\nto frame his complaints, his pleadings, his endearments. Far above all\nthese thoughts towered one, fatal, dominant and wrathful.\n\n\"Who is that man?\"\n\nThe spiteful accent, the harsh voice with which he said these words\nsurprised him as though they came from someone else's mouth.\n\nThe nurse looked at him with her great limpid eyes, eyes that seemed\nforever freed from contractions of surprise or fear. Her response\nslipped from her with equal directness.\n\n\"It is Laurier. . . . It is my husband.\"\n\nLaurier! . . . Julio looked doubtfully and for a long time at the\nsoldier before he could be convinced. That blind officer motionless\non the bench, that figure of heroic grief, was Laurier! . . . At first\nglance, he appeared prematurely old with roughened and bronzed skin\nso furrowed with lines that they converged like rays around all the\nopenings of his face. His hair was beginning to whiten on the temples\nand in the beard which covered his cheeks. He had lived twenty years\nin that one month. . . . At the same time he appeared younger, with a\nyouthfulness that was radiating an inward vigor, with the strength of a\nsoul which has suffered the most violent emotions and, firm and serene\nin the satisfaction of duty fulfilled, can no longer know fear.\n\nAs Desnoyers contemplated him, he felt both admiration and jealousy. He\nwas ashamed to admit the aversion inspired by the wounded man, so sorely\nwounded that he was unable to see what was going on around him. His\nhatred was a form of cowardice, terrifying in its persistence. How\npensive were Marguerite's eyes if she took them off her patient for a\nfew seconds! . . . She had never looked at him in that way. He knew all\nthe amorous gradations of her glance, but her fixed gaze at this injured\nman was something entirely different, something that he had never seen\nbefore.\n\nHe spoke with the fury of a lover who discovers an infidelity.\n\n\"And for this thing you have run away without warning, without a word!\n. . . You have abandoned me in order to go in search of him. . . . Tell\nme, why did you come? . . . Why did you come?\". . .\n\n\"I came because it was my duty.\"\n\nThen she spoke like a mother who takes advantage of a parenthesis\nof surprise in an irascible child's temper, in order to counsel\nself-control, and explained how it had all happened. She had received\nthe news of Laurier's wounding just as she and her mother were preparing\nto leave Paris. She had not hesitated an instant; her duty was to hasten\nto the aid of this man. She had been doing a great deal of thinking in\nthe last few weeks; the war had made her ponder much on the values in\nlife. Her eyes had been getting glimpses of new horizons; our destiny is\nnot mere pleasure and selfish satisfaction; we ought to take our part in\npain and sacrifice.\n\nShe had wanted to work for her country, to share the general stress, to\nserve as other women did; and since she was disposed to devote herself\nto strangers, was it not natural that she should prefer to help this man\nwhom she had so greatly wronged? . . . There still lived in her memory\nthe moment in which she had seen him approach the station, completely\nalone among so many who had the consolation of loving arms when\ndeparting in search of death. Her pity had become still more acute on\nhearing of his misfortune. A shell had exploded near him, killing all\nthose around him. Of his many wounds, the only serious one was that on\nhis face. He had completely lost the sight of one eye; and the doctors\nwere keeping the other bound up hoping to save it. But she was very\ndoubtful about it; she was almost sure that Laurier would be blind.\n\nMarguerite's voice trembled when saying this as if she were going\nto cry, although her eyes were tearless. They did not now feel\nthe irresistible necessity for tears. Weeping had become something\nsuperfluous, like many other luxuries of peaceful days. Her eyes had\nseen so much in so few days! . . .\n\n\"How you love him!\" exclaimed Julio.\n\nFearing that they might be overheard and in order to keep him at a\ndistance, she had been speaking as though to a friend. But her lover's\nsadness broke down her reserve.\n\n\"No, I love you. . . . I shall always love you.\"\n\nThe simplicity with which she said this and her sudden tenderness of\ntone revived Desnoyers' hopes.\n\n\"And the other one?\" he asked anxiously.\n\nUpon receiving her reply, it seemed to him as though something had just\npassed across the sun, veiling its light temporarily. It was as though\na cloud had drifted over the land and over his thoughts, enveloping them\nin an unbearable chill.\n\n\"I love him, too.\"\n\nShe said it with a look that seemed to implore pardon, with the sad\nsincerity of one who has given up lying and weeps in foreseeing the\ninjury that the truth must inflict.\n\nHe felt his hard wrath suddenly dwindling like a crumbling mountain. Ah,\nMarguerite! His voice was tremulous and despairing. Could it be possible\nthat everything between these two was going to end thus simply? Were her\nformer vows mere lies? . . . They had been attracted to each other by an\nirresistible affinity in order to be together forever, to be one. . . .\nAnd now, suddenly hardened by indifference, were they to drift apart\nlike two unfriendly bodies? . . . What did this absurdity about loving\nhim at the same time that she loved her former husband mean, anyway?\n\nMarguerite hung her head, murmuring desperately:\n\n\"You are a man, I am a woman. You would never understand me, no\nmatter what I might say. Men are not able to comprehend certain of\nour mysteries. . . . A woman would be better able to appreciate the\ncomplexity.\"\n\nDesnoyers felt that he must know his fate in all its cruelty. She might\nspeak without fear. He felt strong enough to bear the blow. . . . What\nhad Laurier said when he found that he was being so tenderly cared for\nby Marguerite? . . .\n\n\"He does not know who I am. . . . He believes me to be a war-nurse, like\nthe rest, who pities him seeing him alone and blind with no relatives\nto write to him or visit him. . . . At certain times, I have almost\nsuspected that he guesses the truth. My voice, the touch of my hands\nmade him shiver at first, as though with an unpleasant sensation. I have\ntold him that I am a Beigian lady who has lost her loved ones and is\nalone in the world. He has told me his life story very sketchily, as\nif he desired to forget a hated past. . . . Never one disagreeable word\nabout his former wife. There are nights when I think that he knows me,\nthat he takes advantage of his blindness in order to prolong his feigned\nignorance, and that distresses me. I long for him to recover his sight,\nfor the doctors to save that doubtful eye--and yet at the same time, I\nfeel afraid. What will he say when he recognizes me? . . . But no; it\nis better that he should see, no matter what may result. You cannot\nunderstand my anxiety, you cannot know what I am suffering.\"\n\nShe was silent for an instant, trying to regain her self-control, again\ntortured with the agony of her soul.\n\n\"Oh, the war!\" she resumed. \"What changes in our life! Two months ago,\nmy present situation would have appeared impossible, unimaginable. . . .\nI caring for my husband, fearing that he would discover my identity and\nleave me, yet at the same time, wishing that he would recognize me\nand pardon me. . . . It is only one week that I have been with him. I\ndisguise my voice when I can, and avoid words that may reveal the truth\n. . . but this cannot keep up much longer. It is only in novels that\nsuch painful situations turn out happily.\"\n\nDoubt suddenly overwhelmed her.\n\n\"I believe,\" she continued, \"that he has recognized me from the first.\n. . . He is silent and feigns ignorance because he despises me . . .\nbecause he can never bring himself to pardon me. I have been so bad!\n. . . I have wronged him so!\". . .\n\nShe was recalling the long and reflective silences of the wounded man\nafter she had dropped some imprudent words. After two days of submission\nto her care, he had been somewhat rebellious, avoiding going out with\nher for a walk. Because of his blind helplessness, and comprehending\nthe uselessness of his resistance, he had finally yielded in passive\nsilence.\n\n\"Let him think what he will!\" concluded Marguerite courageously. \"Let\nhim despise me! I am here where I ought to be. I need his forgiveness,\nbut if he does not pardon me, I shall stay with him just the same.\n. . . There are moments when I wish that he may never recover his sight,\nso that he may always need me, so that I may pass my life at his side,\nsacrificing everything for him.\"\n\n\"And I?\" said Desnoyers.\n\nMarguerite looked at him with clouded eyes as though she were just\nawaking. It was true--and the other one? . . . Kindled by the proposed\nsacrifice which was to be her expiation, she had forgotten the man\nbefore her.\n\n\"You!\" she said after a long pause. \"You must leave me. . . . Life is\nnot what we have thought it. Had it not been for the war, we might,\nperhaps, have realized our dream, but now! . . . Listen carefully and\ntry to understand. For the remainder of my life, I shall carry the\nheaviest burden, and yet at the same time it will be sweet, since the\nmore it weighs me down the greater will my atonement be. Never will I\nleave this man whom I have so grievously wronged, now that he is more\nalone in the world and will need protection like a child. Why do you\ncome to share my fate? How could it be possible for you to live with\na nurse constantly at the side of a blind and worthy man whom we would\nconstantly offend with our passion? . . . No, it is better for us to\npart. Go your way, alone and untrammelled. Leave me; you will meet other\nwomen who will make you more happy than I. Yours is the temperament that\nfinds new pleasures at every step.\"\n\nShe stood firmly to her decision. Her voice was calm, but back of it\ntrembled the emotion of a last farewell to a joy which was going from\nher forever. The man would be loved by others . . . and she was giving\nhim up! . . . But the noble sadness of the sacrifice restored her\ncourage. Only by this renunciation could she expiate her sins.\n\nJulio dropped his eyes, vanquished and perplexed. The picture of the\nfuture outlined by Marguerite terrified him. To live with her as a nurse\ntaking advantage of her patient's blindness would be to offer him fresh\ninsult every day. . . . Ah, no! That would be villainy, indeed! He was\nnow ashamed to recall the malignity with which, a little while before,\nhe had regarded this innocent unfortunate. He realized that he was\npowerless to contend with him. Weak and helpless as he was sitting there\non the garden bench, he was stronger and more deserving of respect than\nJulio Desnoyers with all his youth and elegance. The victim had amounted\nto something in his life; he had done what Julio had not dared to do.\n\nThis sudden conviction of his inferiority made him cry out like an\nabandoned child, \"What will become of me?\" . . .\n\nMarguerite, too--contemplating the love which was going from her\nforever, her vanished hopes, the future illumined by the satisfaction of\nduty fulfilled but monotonous and painful--cried out:\n\n\"And I. . . . What will become of me?\" . . .\n\nAs though he had suddenly found a solution which was reviving his\ncourage, Desnoyers said:\n\n\"Listen, Marguerite: I can read your soul. You love this man, and you\ndo well. He is superior to me, and women are always attracted by\nsuperiority. . . . I am a coward. Yes, do not protest, I am a coward\nwith all my youth, with all my strength. Why should you not have been\nimpressed by the conduct of this man! . . . But I will atone for past\nwrongs. This country is yours, Marguerite; I will fight for it. Do not\nsay no. . . .\"\n\nAnd moved by his hasty heroism, he outlined the plan more definitely. He\nwas going to be a soldier. Soon she would hear him well spoken of.\nHis idea was either to be stretched on the battlefield in his first\nencounter, or to astound the world by his bravery. In this way the\nimpossible situation would settle itself--either the oblivion of death\nor glory.\n\n\"No, no!\" interrupted Marguerite in an anguished tone. \"You, no! One\nis enough. . . . How horrible! You, too, wounded, mutilated forever,\nperhaps dead! . . . No, you must live. I want you to live, even though\nyou might belong to another. . . . Let me know that you exist, let me\nsee you sometimes, even though you may have forgotten me, even though\nyou may pass me with indifference, as if you did not know me.\"\n\nIn this outburst her deep love for him rang true--her heroic and\ninflexible love which would accept all penalties for herself, if only\nthe beloved one might continue to live.\n\nBut then, in order that Julio might not feel any false hopes, she\nadded:--\"Live; you must not die; that would be for me another torment.\n. . . But live without me. No matter how much we may talk about it, my\ndestiny beside the other one is marked out forever.\"\n\n\"Ah, how you love him! . . . How you have deceived me!\"\n\nIn a last desperate attempt at explanation she again repeated what she\nhad said at the beginning of their interview. She loved Julio . . . and\nshe loved her husband. They were different kinds of love. She could not\nsay which was the stronger, but misfortune was forcing her to choose\nbetween the two, and she was accepting the most difficult, the one\ndemanding the greatest sacrifices.\n\n\"You are a man, and you will never be able to understand me. . . . A\nwoman would comprehend me.\"\n\nIt seemed to Julio, as he looked around him, as though the afternoon\nwere undergoing some celestial phenomenon. The garden was still\nilluminated by the sun, but the green of the trees, the yellow of the\nground, the blue of the sky, all appeared to him as dark and shadowy as\nthough a rain of ashes were falling.\n\n\"Then . . . all is over between us?\"\n\nHis pleading, trembling voice charged with tears made her turn her head\nto hide her emotion. Then in the painful silence the two despairs formed\none and the same question, as if interrogating the shades of the future:\n\"What will become of me?\" murmured the man. And like an echo her lips\nrepeated, \"What will become of me?\"\n\nAll had been said. Hopeless words came between the two like an obstacle\nmomentarily increasing in size, impelling them in opposite directions.\nWhy prolong the painful interview? . . . Marguerite showed the ready and\nenergetic decision of a woman who wishes to bring a scene to a close.\n\"Good-bye!\" Her face had assumed a yellowish cast, her pupils had become\ndull and clouded like the glass of a lantern when the light dies out.\n\"Good-bye!\" She must go to her patient.\n\nShe went away without looking at him, and Desnoyers instinctively went\nin the opposite direction. As he became more self-controlled and turned\nto look at her again, he saw her moving on and giving her arm to the\nblind man, without once turning her head.\n\nHe now felt convinced that he should never see her again, and became\noppressed by an almost suffocating agony. And could two beings, who had\nformerly considered the universe concentrated in their persons, thus\neasily be separated forever? . . .\n\nHis desperation at finding himself alone made him accuse himself\nof stupidity. Now his thoughts came tumbling over each other in a\ntumultuous throng, and each one of them seemed to him sufficient to have\nconvinced Marguerite. He certainly had not known how to express himself.\nHe would have to talk with her again . . . and he decided to remain in\nLourdes.\n\nHe passed a night of torture in the hotel, listening to the ripple of\nthe river among its stones. Insomnia had him in his fierce jaws, gnawing\nhim with interminable agony. He turned on the light several times, but\nwas not able to read. His eyes looked with stupid fixity at the patterns\nof the wall paper and the pious pictures around the room which had\nevidently served as the lodging place of some rich traveller. He\nremained motionless and as abstracted as an Oriental who thinks himself\ninto an absolute lack of thought. One idea only was dancing in the\nvacuum in his skull--\"I shall never see her again. . . . Can such a\nthing be possible?\"\n\nHe drowsed for a few seconds, only to be awakened with the sensation\nthat some horrible explosion was sending him through the air. And so,\nwith sweats of anguish, he wakefully passed the hours until in the gloom\nof his room the dawn showed a milky rectangle of light, and began to be\nreflected on the window curtains.\n\nThe velvet-like caress of day finally closed his eyes. Upon awaking he\nfound that the morning was well advanced, and he hurried to the garden\nof the grotto. . . . Oh, the hours of tremulous and unavailing waiting,\nbelieving that he recognized Marguerite in every white-clad lady that\ncame along, guiding a wounded patient!\n\nBy afternoon, after a lunch whose dishes filed past him untouched, he\nreturned to the garden in search of her. Beholding her in the distance\nwith the blind man leaning on her arm, a feeling of faintness came over\nhim. She looked to him taller, thinner, her face sharper, with two dark\nhollows in her cheeks and her eyes bright with fever, the lids drawn\nwith weariness. He suspected that she, too, had passed an anguished\nnight of tenacious, self-centred thought, of grievous stupefaction like\nhis own, in the room of her hotel. Suddenly he felt all the weight\nof insomnia and listlessness, all the depressing emotion of the cruel\nsensations experienced in the last few hours. Oh, how miserable they\nboth were! . . .\n\nShe was walking warily, looking from one side to the other, as though\nforeseeing danger. Upon discovering him she clung to her charge, casting\nupon her former lover a look of entreaty, of desperation, imploring\npity. . . Ay, that look!\n\nHe felt ashamed of himself; his personality appeared to be unrolling\nitself before him, and he surveyed himself with the eyes of a judge.\nWhat was this seduced and useless man, called Julio Desnoyers, doing\nthere, tormenting with his presence a poor woman, trying to turn her\nfrom her righteous repentance, insisting on his selfish and petty\ndesires when all humanity was thinking of other things? . . . His\ncowardice angered him. Like a thief taking advantage of the sleep of his\nvictim, he was stalking around this brave and true man who could not\nsee him, who could not defend himself, in order to rob him of the only\naffection that he had in the world which had so miraculously returned to\nhim! Very well, Gentleman Desnoyers! . . . Ah, what a scoundrel he was!\n\nSuch subconscious insults made him draw himself erect, in haughty, cruel\nand inexorable defiance against that other I who so richly deserved the\njudge's scorn.\n\nHe turned his head away; he could not meet Marguerite's piteous eyes; he\nfeared their mute reproach. Neither did he dare to look at the blind man\nin his shabby and heroic uniform, with his countenance aged by duty and\nglory. He feared him like remorse.\n\nSo the vanquished lover turned his back on the two and went away with a\nfirm step. Good-bye, Love! Goodbye, Happiness! . . . He marched quickly\nand bravely on; a miracle had just taken place within him! he had found\nthe right road at last!\n\nTo Paris! . . . A new impetus was going to fill the vacuum of his\nobjectless existence.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE INVASION\n\n\nDon Marcelo was fleeing to take refuge in his castle when he met the\nmayor of Villeblanche. The noise of the firing had made him hurry to the\nbarricade. When he learned of the apparition of the group of stragglers\nhe threw up his hands in despair. They were crazy. Their resistance was\ngoing to be fatal for the village, and he ran on to beg them to cease.\n\nFor some time nothing happened to disturb the morning calm. Desnoyers\nhad climbed to the top of his towers and was surveying the country with\nhis field glasses. He couldn't make out the highway through the nearest\ngroup of trees, but he suspected that underneath their branches great\nactivity was going on--masses of men on guard, troops preparing for the\nattack. The unexpected defense of the fugitives had upset the advance\nof the invasion. Desnoyers thought despairingly of that handful of mad\nfellows and their stubborn chief. What was their fate going to be? . . .\n\nFocussing his glasses on the village, he saw the red spots of kepis\nwaving like poppies over the green of the meadows. They were the\nretreating men, now convinced of the uselessness of their resistance.\nPerhaps they had found a ford or forgotten boat by which they might\ncross the Maine, and so were continuing their retreat toward the river.\nAt any minute now the Germans were going to enter Villeblanche.\n\nHalf an hour of profound silence passed by. The village lay silhouetted\nagainst a background of hills--a mass of roofs beneath the church tower\nfinished with its cross and iron weather cock. Everything seemed as\ntranquil as in the best days of peace. Suddenly he noticed that the\ngrove was vomiting forth something noisy and penetrating--a bubble of\nvapor accompanied by a deafening report. Something was hurtling through\nthe air with a strident curve. Then a roof in the village opened like\na crater, vomiting forth flying wood, fragments of plaster and broken\nfurniture. All the interior of the house seemed to be escaping in a\nstream of smoke, dirt and splinters.\n\nThe invaders were bombarding Villeblanche before attempting attack, as\nthough fearing to encounter persistent resistance in its streets. More\nprojectiles fell. Some passed over the houses, exploding between\nthe hamlet and the castle. The towers of the Desnoyers property\nwere beginning to attract the aim of the artillerymen. The owner\nwas therefore about to abandon his dangerous observatory when he saw\nsomething white like a tablecloth or sheet floating from the church\ntower. His neighbors had hoisted this signal of peace in order to avoid\nbombardment. A few more missiles fell and then there was silence.\n\nWhen Don Marcelo reached his park he found the Warden burying at the\nfoot of a tree the sporting rifles still remaining in his castle. Then\nhe went toward the great iron gates. The enemies were going to come,\nand he had to receive them. While uneasily awaiting their arrival his\ncompunctions again tormented him. What was he doing there? Why had he\nremained? . . . But his obstinate temperament immediately put aside\nthe promptings of fear. He was there because he had to guard his own.\nBesides, it was too late now to think about such things.\n\nSuddenly the morning stillness was broken by a sound like the deafening\ntearing of strong cloth. \"Shots, Master,\" said the Warden. \"Firing! It\nmust be in the square.\"\n\nA few minutes after they saw running toward them a woman from the\nvillage, an old soul, dried up and darkened by age, who was panting\nfrom her great exertion, and looking wildly around her. She was fleeing\nblindly, trying to escape from danger and shut out horrible visions.\nDesnoyers and the Keeper's family listened to her explanations\ninterrupted with hiccoughs of terror.\n\nThe Germans were in Villeblanche. They had entered first in an\nautomobile driven at full speed from one end of the village to the\nother. Its mitrailleuse was firing at random against closed houses and\nopen doors, knocking down all the people in sight. The old woman flung\nup her arms with a gesture of terror. . . . Dead . . . many dead . . .\nwounded . . . blood! Then other iron-plated vehicles had stopped in\nthe square, and behind them cavalrymen, battalions of infantry, many\nbattalions coming from everywhere. The helmeted men seemed furious; they\naccused the villagers of having fired at them. In the square they had\nstruck the mayor and villagers who had come forward to meet them. The\npriest, bending over some of the dying, had also been trodden under\nfoot. . . . All prisoners! The Germans were talking of shooting them.\n\nThe old dame's words were cut short by the rumble of approaching\nautomobiles.\n\n\"Open the gates,\" commanded the owner to the Warden. The massive iron\ngrill work swung open, and was never again closed. All property rights\nwere at an end.\n\nAn enormous automobile, covered with dust and filled with men, stopped\nat the entrance. Behind them sounded the horns of other vehicles that\nwere putting on the brakes. Desnoyers saw soldiers leaping out, all\nwearing the greenish-gray uniform with a sheath of the same tone\ncovering the pointed casque. The one who marched at their head put his\nrevolver to the millionaire's forehead.\n\n\"Where are the sharpshooters?\" he asked.\n\nHe was pale with the pallor of wrath, vengeance and fear. His face\nwas trembling under the influence of his triple emotion. Don Marcelo\nexplained slowly, contemplating at a short distance from his eyes the\nblack circle of the threatening tube. He had not seen any sharpshooters.\nThe only inhabitants of the castle were the Warden with his family and\nhimself, the owner of the castle.\n\nThe officer surveyed the edifice and then examined Desnoyers\nwith evident astonishment as though he thought his appearance too\nunpretentious for a proprietor. He had taken him for a simple employee,\nand his respect for social rank made him lower his revolver.\n\nHe did not, however, alter his haughty attitude. He pressed Don Marcelo\ninto the service as a guide, making him search ahead of him while forty\nsoldiers grouped themselves at his back. They advanced in two files to\nthe shelter of the trees which bordered the central avenue, with their\nguns ready to shoot, and looking uneasily at the castle windows as\nthough expecting to receive from them hidden shots. Desnoyers marched\ntranquilly through the centre, and the official, who had been imitating\nthe precautions of his men, finally joined him when he was crossing the\ndrawbridge.\n\nThe armed men scattered through the rooms in search of the enemy.\nThey ran their bayonets through beds and divans. Some, with automatic\ndestructiveness, slit the draperies and the rich bed coverings. The\nowner protested; what was the sense in such useless destruction?\n. . . He was suffering unbearable torture at seeing the enormous boots\nspotting the rugs with mud, on hearing the clash of guns and knapsacks\nagainst the most fragile, choicest pieces of furniture. Poor historic\nmansion! . . .\n\nThe officer looked amazed that he should protest for such trifling\ncause, but he gave orders in German and his men ceased their rude\nexplorations. Then, in justification of this extraordinary respect, he\nadded in French:\n\n\"I believe that you are going to have the honor of entertaining here the\ngeneral of our division.\"\n\nThe certainty that the castle did not hold any hidden enemies made\nhim more amiable. He, nevertheless, persisted in his wrath against the\nsharpshooters. A group of the villagers had opened fire upon the Uhlans\nwhen they were entering unsuspiciously after the retreat of the French.\n\nDesnoyers felt it necessary to protest. They were neither inhabitants\nnor sharpshooters; they were French soldiers. He took good care to be\nsilent about their presence at the barricade, but he insisted that he\nhad distinguished their uniforms from a tower of the castle.\n\nThe official made a threatening face.\n\n\"You, too? . . . You, who appear a reasonable man, can repeat such yarns\nas these?\" And in order to close the conversation, he said, arrogantly:\n\"They were wearing uniforms, then, if you persist in saying so, but they\nwere sharpshooters just the same. The French Government has distributed\narms and uniforms among the farmers that they may assassinate us. . . .\nBelgium did the same thing. . . . But we know their tricks, and we know\nhow to punish them, too!\"\n\nThe village was going to be burned. It was necessary to avenge the four\nGerman dead lying on the outskirts of Villeblanche, near the barricade.\nThe mayor, the priest, the principal inhabitants would all be shot.\n\nBy the time they reached the top floor Desnoyers could see floating\nabove the boughs of his park dark clouds whose outlines were reddened\nby the sun. The top of the bell tower was the only thing that he could\ndistinguish at that distance. Around the iron weathercock were flying\nlong thin fringes like black cobwebs lifted by the breeze. An odor of\nburning wood came toward the castle.\n\nThe German greeted this spectacle with a cruel smile. Then on descending\nto the park, he ordered Desnoyers to follow him. His liberty and his\ndignity had come to an end. Henceforth he was going to be an underling\nat the beck and call of these men who would dispose of him as their\nwhims directed. Ay, why had he remained? . . . He obeyed, climbing into\nan automobile beside the officer, who was still carrying his revolver\nin his right hand. His men distributed themselves through the castle and\noutbuildings, in order to prevent the flight of an imaginary enemy. The\nWarden and his family seemed to be saying good-bye to him with their\neyes. Perhaps they were taking him to his death. . . .\n\nBeyond the castle woods a new world was coming into existence. The short\ncut to Villeblanche seemed to Desnoyers a leap of millions of leagues,\na fall into a red planet where men and things were covered with the film\nof smoke and the glare of fire. He saw the village under a dark canopy\nspotted with sparks and glowing embers. The bell tower was burning like\nan enormous torch; the roof of the church was breaking into flames with\na crashing fury. The glare of the holocaust seemed to shrivel and grow\npale in the impassive light of the sun.\n\nRunning across the fields with the haste of desperation were shrieking\nwomen and children. The animals had escaped from the stables, and driven\nforth by the flames were racing wildly across the country. The cow and\nthe work horse were dragging their halters broken by their flight. Their\nflanks were smoking and smelt of burnt hair. The pigs, the sheep and the\nchickens were all tearing along mingled with the cats and the dogs. All\nthe domestic animals were returning to a brute existence, fleeing\nfrom civilized man. Shots were heard and hellish ha-ha's. The soldiers\noutside of the village were making themselves merry in this hunt for\nfugitives. Their guns were aimed at beasts and were hitting people.\n\nDesnoyers saw men, many men, men everywhere. They were like gray ants,\nmarching in endless files towards the South, coming out from the woods,\nfilling the roads, crossing the fields. The green of vegetation was\ndisappearing under their tread; the dust was rising in spirals behind\nthe dull roll of the cannons and the measured trot of thousands of\nhorses. On the roadside several battalions had halted, with their\naccompaniment of vehicles and draw horses. They were resting before\nrenewing their march. He knew this army. He had seen it in Berlin on\nparade, and yet it seemed to have changed its former appearance. There\nnow remained very little of the heavy and imposing glitter, of the mute\nand vainglorious haughtiness which had made his relatives-in-law weep\nwith admiration. War, with its realism, had wiped out all that was\ntheatrical about this formidable organization of death. The soldiers\nappeared dirty and tired, out. The respiration of fat and sweaty bodies,\nmixed with the strong smell of leather, floated over the regiments. All\nthe men had hungry faces.\n\nFor days and nights they had been following the heels of an enemy\nwhich was always just eluding their grasp. In this forced advance the\nprovisions of the administration would often arrive so late at the\ncantonments that they could depend only on what they happened to have\nin their knapsacks. Desnoyers saw them lined up near the road devouring\nhunks of black bread and mouldy sausages. Some had scattered through\nthe fields to dig up beet roots and other tubers, chewing with loud\ncrunchings the hard pulp to which the grit still adhered. An ensign was\nshaking the fruit trees using as a catch-all the flag of his regiment.\nThat glorious standard, adorned with souvenirs of 1870, was serving as\na receptacle for green plums. Those who were seated on the ground were\nimproving this rest by drawing their perspiring, swollen feet from high\nboots which were sending out an insufferable smell.\n\nThe regiments of infantry which Desnoyers had seen in Berlin reflecting\nthe light on metal and leather straps, the magnificent and terrifying\nHussars, the Cuirassiers in pure white uniform like the paladins of the\nHoly Grail, the artillerymen with breasts crossed with white bands, all\nthe military variations that on parade had drawn forth the Hartrotts'\nsighs of admiration--these were now all unified and mixed together,\nof uniform color, all in greenish mustard like the dusty lizards that,\nslipping along, try to be confounded with the earth.\n\nThe persistency of the iron discipline was easily discernible. A word\nfrom the chiefs, the sound of a whistle, and they all grouped themselves\ntogether, the human being disappearing in the throngs of automatons; but\ndanger, weariness, and the uncertainty of triumph had for the time\nbeing brought officers and men nearer together, obliterating caste\ndistinction. The officers were coming part way out of their overbearing,\nhaughty seclusion, and were condescending to talk with the lower orders\nso as to revive their courage. One effort more and they would overwhelm\nboth French and English, repeating the triumph of Sedan, whose\nanniversary they were going to celebrate in a few days! They were going\nto enter Paris; it was only a matter of a week. Paris! Great shops\nfilled with luxurious things, famous restaurants, women, champagne,\nmoney. . . . And the men, flattered that their commanders were stooping\nto chat with them, forgot fatigue and hunger, reviving like the throngs\nof the Crusade before the image of Jerusalem. \"Nach Paris!\" The joyous\nshout circulated from the head to the tail of the marching columns. \"To\nParis! To Paris!\"\n\nThe scarcity of their food supply was here supplemented by the products\nof a country rich in wines. When sacking houses they rarely found\neatables, but invariably a wine cellar. The humble German, the perpetual\nbeer drinker, who had always looked upon wine as a privilege of the\nrich, could now open up casks with blows from his weapons, even bathing\nhis feet in the stream of precious liquid. Every battalion left as a\nsouvenir of its passing a wake of empty bottles; a halt in camp sowed\nthe land with glass cylinders. The regimental trucks, unable to renew\ntheir stores of provisions, were accustomed to seize the wine in all the\ntowns. The soldier, lacking bread, would receive alcohol. . . .\n\nThis donation was always accompanied by the good counsels of the\nofficers--War is war; no pity toward our adversaries who do not deserve\nit. The French were shooting their prisoners, and their women were\nputting out the eyes of the wounded. Every dwelling was a den of traps.\nThe simple-hearted and innocent German entering therein was going to\ncertain death. The beds were made over subterranean caves, the wardrobes\nwere make-believe doors, in every corner was lurking an assassin. This\ntraitorous nation, which was arranging its ground like the scenario of\na melodrama, would have to be chastised. The municipal officers,\nthe priests, the schoolmasters were directing and protecting the\nsharpshooters.\n\nDesnoyers was shocked at the indifference with which these men were\nstalking around the burning village. They did not appear to see the fire\nand destruction; it was just an ordinary spectacle, not worth looking\nat. Ever since they had crossed the frontier, smoldering and blasted\nvillages, fired by the advance guard, had marked their halting places on\nBelgian and French soil.\n\nWhen entering Villeblanche the automobile had to lower its speed. Burned\nwalls were bulging out over the street and half-charred beams were\nobstructing the way, obliging the vehicle to zigzag through the smoking\nrubbish. The vacant lots were burning like fire pans between the houses\nstill standing, with doors broken, but not yet in flames. Desnoyers saw\nwithin these rectangular spaces partly burned wood, chairs, beds,\nsewing machines, iron stoves, all the household goods of the well-to-do\ncountryman, being consumed or twisted into shapeless masses. Sometimes\nhe would spy an arm sticking out of the ruins, beginning to burn like a\nlong wax candle. No, it could not be possible . . . and then the\nsmell of cooking flesh began to mingle with that of the soot, wood and\nplaster.\n\nHe closed his eyes, not able to look any longer. He thought for a moment\nhe must be dreaming. It was unbelievable that such horrors could\ntake place in less than an hour. Human wickedness at its worst he had\nsupposed incapable of changing the aspect of a village in such a short\ntime.\n\nAn abrupt stoppage of the motor made him look around involuntarily. This\ntime the obstruction was the dead bodies in the street--two men and\na woman. They had probably fallen under the rain of bullets from the\nmachine gun which had passed through the town preceding the invasion.\nSome soldiers were seated a little beyond them, with their backs to the\nvictims, as though ignoring their presence. The chauffeur yelled to\nthem to clear the track; with their guns and feet they pushed aside the\nbodies still warm, at every turn leaving a trail of blood. The space was\nhardly opened before the vehicle shot through . . . a thud, a leap--the\nback wheels had evidently crushed some very fragile obstacle.\n\nDesnoyers was still huddled in his seat, benumbed and with closed eyes.\nThe horror around him made him think of his own fate. Whither was this\nlieutenant taking him? . . .\n\nHe soon saw the town hall flaming in the square; the church was now\nnothing but a stone shell, bristling with flames. The houses of the\nprosperous villagers had had their doors and windows chopped out by\naxe-blows. Within them soldiers were moving about methodically. They\nentered empty-handed and came out loaded with furniture and clothing.\nOthers, in the upper stories, were flinging out various objects;\naccompanying their trophies with jests and guffaws. Suddenly they had\nto come out flying, for fire was breaking out with the violence and\nrapidity of an explosion. Following their footsteps was a group of men\nwith big boxes and metal cylinders. Someone at their head was pointing\nout the buildings into whose broken windows were to be thrown the\nlozenges and liquid streams which would produce catastrophe with\nlightning rapidity.\n\nOut of one of these flaming buildings two men, who seemed but bundles\nof rags, were being dragged by some Germans. Above the blue sleeves of\ntheir military cloaks Don Marcelo could distinguish blanched faces and\neyes immeasurably distended with suffering. Their legs were dragging on\nthe ground, sticking out between the tatters of their red pantaloons.\nOne of them still had on his kepis. Blood was gushing from different\nparts of their bodies and behind them, like white serpents, were\ntrailing their loosened bandages. They were wounded Frenchmen,\nstragglers who had remained in the village because too weak to keep up\nwith the retreat. Perhaps they had joined the group which, finding its\nescape cut off, had attempted that insane resistance.\n\nWishing to make that matter more clearly understood, Desnoyers looked at\nthe official beside him, attempting to speak; but the officer silenced\nhim instantly: \"French sharpshooters in disguise who are going to get\nthe punishment they deserve.\" The German bayonets were sunk deep into\ntheir bodies. Then blows with the guns fell on the head of one of them\n. . . and these blows were repeated with dull thumps upon their skulls,\ncrackling as they burst open.\n\nAgain the old man wondered what his fate would be. Where was this\nlieutenant taking him across such visions of horror? . . .\n\nThey had reached the outskirts of the village, where the dragoons had\nbuilt their barricade. The carts were still there, but at one side of\nthe road. They climbed out of the automobile, and he saw a group of\nofficers in gray, with sheathed helmets like the others. The one who had\nbrought him to this place was standing rigidly erect with one hand to\nhis visor, speaking to a military man standing a few paces in front of\nthe others. He looked at this man, who was scrutinizing him with his\nlittle hard blue eyes that had carved his spare, furrowed countenance\nwith lines. He must be the general. His arrogant and piercing gaze was\nsweeping him from head to foot. Don Marcelo felt a presentiment that his\nlife was hanging on this examination; should an evil suggestion, a\ncruel caprice flash across this brain, he was surely lost. The general\nshrugged his shoulders and said a few words in a contemptuous tone, then\nentered his automobile with two of his aids, and the group disbanded.\n\nThe cruel uncertainty, the interminable moments before the official\nreturned to his side, filled Desnoyers with dread.\n\n\"His Excellency is very gracious,\" announced the lieutenant. \"He might\nhave shot you, but he pardons you and yet you people say that we are\nsavages!\" . . .\n\nWith involuntary contempt, he further explained that he had conducted\nhim thither fully expecting that he would be shot. The General was\nplanning to punish all the prominent residents of Villeblanche, and he\nhad inferred, on his own initiative, that the owner of the castle must\nbe one of them.\n\n\"Military duty, sir. . . . War exacts it.\"\n\nAfter this excuse the petty official renewed his eulogies of His\nExcellency. He was going to make his headquarters in Don Marcelo's\nproperty, and on that account granted him his life. He ought to thank\nhim. . . . Then again his face trembled with wrath. He pointed to some\nbodies lying near the road. They were the corpses of Uhlans, covered\nwith some cloaks from which were protruding the enormous soles of their\nboots.\n\n\"Plain murder!\" he exclaimed. \"A crime for which the guilty are going to\npay dearly!\"\n\nHis indignation made him consider the death of four soldiers as an\nunheard-of and monstrous outrage--as though in was only the enemy ought\nto fall, keeping safe and sound the lives of his compatriots.\n\nA band of infantry commanded by an officer approached. As their ranks\nopened, Desnoyers saw the gray uniforms roughly pushing forward some of\nthe inhabitants. Their clothes were torn and some had blood on face and\nhands. He recognized them one by one as they were lined up against the\nmud wall, at twenty paces from the firing squad of soldiers--the mayor,\nthe priest, the forest guard, and some rich villagers whose houses he\nhad seen falling in flames.\n\n\"They are going to shoot them . . . in order to prevent any doubt about\nit,\" the lieutenant explained. \"I wanted you to see this. It will serve\nas an object lesson. In this way, you will feel more appreciative of the\nleniency of His Excellency.\"\n\nThe prisoners were mute. Their voices had been exhausted in vain\nprotest. All their life was concentrated in their eyes, looking around\nthem in stupefaction. . . . And was it possible that they would kill\nthem in cold blood without hearing their testimony, without admitting\nthe proofs of their innocence!\n\nThe certainty of approaching death soon gave almost all of them a noble\nserenity. It was useless to complain. Only one rich countryman, famous\nfor his avarice, was whimpering desperately, saying over and over, \"I do\nnot wish to die. . . . I do not want to die!\"\n\nTrembling and with eyes overflowing with tears, Desnoyers hid himself\nbehind his implacable guide. He knew them all, he had battled with them\nall, and repented now of his former wrangling. The mayor had a red stain\non his forehead from a long skin wound. Upon his breast fluttered a\ntattered tricolor; the municipality had placed it there that he might\nreceive the invaders who had torn most of it away. The priest was\nholding his little round body as erect as possible, wishing to embrace\nin a look of resignation the victims, the executioners, earth and\nheaven. He appeared larger than usual and more imposing. His black\ngirdle, broken by the roughness of the soldiers, left his cassock loose\nand floating. His waving, silvery hair was dripping blood, spotting with\nits red drops the white clerical collar.\n\nUpon seeing him cross the fatal field with unsteady step, because of his\nobesity, a savage roar cut the tragic silence. The unarmed soldiers,\nwho had hastened to witness the execution, greeted the venerable old man\nwith shouts of laughter. \"Death to the priest!\" . . . The fanaticism of\nthe religious wars vibrated through their mockery. Almost all of them\nwere devout Catholics or fervent Protestants, but they believed only\nin the priests of their own country. Outside of Germany, everything was\ndespicable--even their own religion.\n\nThe mayor and the priest changed their places in the file, seeking one\nanother. Each, with solemn courtesy, was offering the other the central\nplace in the group.\n\n\"Here, your Honor, is your place as mayor--at the head of all.\"\n\n\"No, after you, Monsieur le cure.\"\n\nThey were disputing for the last time, but in this supreme moment each\none was wishing to yield precedence to the other.\n\nInstinctively they had clasped hands, looking straight ahead at the\nfiring squad, that had lowered its guns in a rigid, horizontal line.\nBehind them sounded laments--\"Good-bye, my children. . . . Adieu, life!\n. . . I do not wish to die! . . . I do not want to die! . . .\"\n\nThe two principal men felt the necessity of saying something, of closing\nthe page of their existence with an affirmation.\n\n\"Vive la Republique!\" cried the mayor.\n\n\"Vive la France!\" said the priest.\n\nDesnoyers thought that both had said the same thing. Two uprights\nflashed up above their heads--the arm of the priest making the sign of\nthe cross, and the sabre of the commander of the shooters, glistening\nat the same instant. . . . A dry, dull thunderclap, followed by some\nscattering, tardy shots.\n\nDon Marcelo's compassion for that forlorn cluster of massacred humanity\nwas intensified on beholding the grotesque forms which many assumed\nin the moment of death. Some collapsed like half-emptied sacks; others\nrebounded from the ground like balls; some leaped like gymnasts, with\nupraised arms, falling on their backs, or face downward, like a swimmer.\nIn that human heap, he saw limbs writhing in the agony of death. Some\nsoldiers advanced like hunters bagging their prey. From the palpitating\nmass fluttered locks of white hair, and a feeble hand, trying to repeat\nthe sacred sign. A few more shots and blows on the livid, mangled mass\n. . . and the last tremors of life were extinguished forever.\n\nThe officer had lit a cigar.\n\n\"Whenever you wish,\" he said to Desnoyers with ironical courtesy.\n\nThey re-entered the automobile in order to return to the castle by the\nway of Villeblanche. The increasing number of fires and the dead bodies\nin the streets no longer impressed the old man. He had seen so much!\nWhat could now affect his sensibilities? . . . He was longing to get\nout of the village as soon as possible to try to find the peace of the\ncountry. But the country had disappeared under the invasion--soldier's,\nhorses, cannons everywhere. Wherever they stopped to rest, they were\ndestroying all that they came in contact with. The marching battalions,\nnoisy and automatic as a machine were preceded by the fifes and drums,\nand every now and then, in order to cheer their drooping spirits, were\nbreaking into their joyous cry, \"Nach Paris!\"\n\nThe castle, too, had been disfigured by the invasion. The number of\nguards had greatly increased during the owner's absence. He saw an\nentire regiment of infantry encamped in the park. Thousands of men\nwere moving about under the trees, preparing the dinner in the movable\nkitchens. The flower borders of the gardens, the exotic plants, the\ncarefully swept and gravelled avenues were all broken and spoiled by\nthis avalanche of men, beasts and vehicles.\n\nA chief wearing on his sleeve the band of the military administration\nwas giving orders as though he were the proprietor. He did not even\ncondescend to look at this civilian walking beside the lieutenant with\nthe downcast look of a prisoner. The stables were vacant. Desnoyers saw\nhis last animals being driven off with sticks by the helmeted shepherds.\nThe costly progenitors of his herds were all beheaded in the park like\nmere slaughter-house animals. In the chicken houses and dovecotes, there\nwas not a single bird left. The stables were filled with thin horses who\nwere gorging themselves before overflowing mangers. The feed from the\nbarns was being lavishly distributed through the avenue, much of it lost\nbefore it could be used. The cavalry horses of various divisions were\nturned loose in the meadows, destroying with their hoofs the canals,\nthe edges of the slopes, the level of the ground, all the work of\nmany months. The dry wood was uselessly burning in the park. Through\ncarelessness or mischief, someone had set the wood piles on fire. The\ntrees, with the bark dried by the summer heat, were crackling on being\nlicked by the flame.\n\nThe building was likewise occupied by a multitude of men under this same\nsuperintendent. The open windows showed a continual shifting through the\nrooms. Desnoyers heard great blows that re-echoed within his breast. Ay,\nhis historic mansion! . . . The General was going to establish himself\nin it, after having examined on the banks of the Marne, the works of the\npontoon builders, who had been constructing several military bridges\nfor the troops. Don Marcelo's outraged sense of ownership forced him to\nspeak. He feared that they would break the doors of the locked rooms--he\nwould like to go for the keys in order to give them up to those in\ncharge. The commissary would not listen to him but continued ignoring\nhis existence. The lieutenant replied with cutting amiability:\n\n\"It is not necessary; do not trouble yourself!\"\n\nAfter this considerate remark, he started to rejoin his regiment but\ndeemed it prudent before losing sight of Desnoyers to give him a little\nadvice. He must remain quietly at the castle; outside, he might be taken\nfor a spy, and he already knew how promptly the soldiers of the Emperor\nsettled all such little matters.\n\nHe could not remain in the garden looking at his dwelling from any\ndistance, because the Germans who were going and coming were diverting\nthemselves by playing practical jokes upon him. They would march toward\nhim in a straight line, as though they did not see him, and he would\nhave to hurry out of their way to avoid being thrown down by their\nmechanical and rigid advance.\n\nFinally he sought refuge in the lodge of the Keeper, whose good wife\nstared with astonishment at seeing him drop into a kitchen chair\nbreathless and downcast, suddenly aged by losing the remarkable energy\nthat had been the wonder of his advanced years.\n\n\"Ah, Master. . . . Poor Master!\"\n\nOf all the events attending the invasion, the most unbelievable for this\npoor woman was seeing her employer take refuge in her cottage.\n\n\"What is ever going to become of us!\" she groaned.\n\nHer husband was in constant demand by the invaders. His Excellency's\nassistants, installed in the basement apartments of the castle were\nincessantly calling him to tell them the whereabouts of things which\nthey could not find. From every trip, he would return humiliated, his\neyes filled with tears. On his forehead was the black and blue mark of\na blow, and his jacket was badly torn. These were souvenirs of a futile\nattempt at opposition, during his master's absence, to the German\nplundering of stables and castle rooms.\n\nThe millionaire felt himself linked by misfortune to these people,\nconsidered until then with indifference. He was very grateful for the\nloyalty of this sick and humble man, and the poor woman's interest in\nthe castle as though it were her own, touched him greatly. The presence\nof their daughter brought Chichi to his mind. He had passed near her\nwithout noting the transformation in her, seeing her just the same\nas when, with her little dog trot, she had accompanied the Master's\ndaughter on her rounds through the parks and grounds. Now she was a\nwoman, slender and full grown, with the first feminine graces showing\nsubtly in her fourteen-year-old figure. Her mother would not let her\nleave the lodge, fearing the soldiery which was invading every other\nspot with its overflowing current, filtering into all open places,\nbreaking every obstacle which impeded their course.\n\nDesnoyers broke his despairing silence to admit that he was feeling\nhungry. He was ashamed of this bodily want, but the emotions of the day,\nthe executions seen so near, the danger still threatening, had awakened\nin him a nervous appetite. The fact that he was so impotent in the midst\nof his riches and unable to avail himself of anything on his estate but\naggravated his necessity.\n\n\"Poor Master!\" again exclaimed the faithful soul.\n\nAnd the woman looked with astonishment at the millionaire devouring a\nbit of bread and a triangle of cheese, the only food that she could find\nin her humble dwelling. The certainty that he would not be able to find\nany other nourishment, no matter how much he might seek it, greatly\nsharpened his cravings. To have acquired an enormous fortune only to\nperish with hunger at the end of his existence! . . . The good wife, as\nthough guessing his thoughts, sighed, raising her eyes beseechingly to\nheaven. Since the early morning hours, the world had completely changed\nits course. Ay, this war! . . .\n\nThe rest of the afternoon and a part of the night, the proprietor kept\nreceiving news from the Keeper after his visits to the castle. The\nGeneral and numerous officers were now occupying the rooms. Not a single\ndoor was locked, all having been opened with blows of the axe or gun.\nMany things had completely disappeared; the man did not know exactly\nhow, but they had vanished--perhaps destroyed, or perhaps carried off\nby those who were coming and going. The chief with the banded sleeve was\ngoing from room to room examining everything, dictating in German to a\nsoldier who was writing down his orders. Meanwhile the General and his\nstaff were in the dining room drinking heavily, consulting the maps\nspread out on the floor, and ordering the Warden to go down into the\nvaults for the very best wines.\n\nBy nightfall, an onward movement was noticeable in the human tide that\nhad been overflowing the fields as far as the eye could reach. Some\nbridges had been constructed across the Marne and the invasion had\nrenewed its march, shouting enthusiastically. \"Nach Paris!\" Those left\nbehind till the following day were to live in the ruined houses or\nthe open air. Desnoyers heard songs. Under the splendor of the evening\nstars, the soldiers had grouped themselves in musical knots, chanting\na sweet and solemn chorus of religious gravity. Above the trees was\nfloating a red cloud, intensified by the dusk--a reflection of the\nstill burning village. Afar off were bonfires of farms and homesteads,\ntwinkling in the night with their blood-colored lights.\n\nThe bewildered proprietor of the castle finally fell asleep in a bed\nin the lodge, made mercifully unconscious by the heavy and stupefying\nslumber of exhaustion, without fright nor nightmare. He seemed to be\nfalling, falling into a bottomless pit, and on awaking fancied that he\nhad slept but a few minutes. The sun was turning the window shades to an\norange hue, spattered with shadows of waving boughs and birds fluttering\nand twittering among the leaves. He shared their joy in the cool\nrefreshing dawn of the summer day. It certainly was a fine morning--but\nwhose dwelling was this? . . . He gazed dumbfounded at his bed and\nsurroundings. Suddenly the reality assaulted his brain that had been so\nsweetly dulled by the first splendors of the day. Step by step, the host\nof emotions compressed into the preceding day, came climbing up the long\nstairway of his memory to the last black and red landing of the night\nbefore. And he had slept tranquilly surrounded by enemies, under the\nsurveillance of an arbitrary power which might destroy him in one of its\ncaprices!\n\nWhen he went into the kitchen, the Warden gave him some news. The\nGermans were departing. The regiment encamped in the park had left at\ndaybreak, and after them others, and still others. In the village there\nwas still one regiment occupying the few houses yet standing and the\nruins of the charred ones. The General had gone also with his numerous\nstaff. There was nobody in the castle now but the head of a Reserve\nbrigade whom his aide called \"The Count,\" and a few officials.\n\nUpon receiving this information, the proprietor ventured to leave the\nlodge. He saw his gardens destroyed, but still beautiful. The trees were\nstill stately in spite of the damage done to their trunks. The birds\nwere flying about excitedly, rejoicing to find themselves again in\npossession of the spaces so recently flooded by the human inundation.\n\nSuddenly Desnoyers regretted having sallied forth. Five huge trucks were\nlined up near the moat before the castle bridge. Gangs of soldiers were\ncoming out carrying on their shoulders enormous pieces of furniture,\nlike peons conducting a moving. A bulky object wrapped in damask\ncurtains--an excellent substitute for sacking--was being pushed by four\nmen toward one of the drays. The owner suspected immediately what it\nmust be. His bath! The famous tub of gold! . . . Then with an abrupt\nrevulsion of feeling, he felt no grief at his loss. He now detested the\nostentatious thing, attributing to it a fatal influence. On account of\nit he was here. But, ay! . . . the other furnishings piled up in the\ndrays! . . . In that moment he suffered the extreme agony of misery and\nimpotence. It was impossible for him to defend his property, to dispute\nwith the head thief who was sacking his castle, tranquilly ignoring the\nvery existence of the owner. \"Robbers! thieves!\" and he fled back to the\nlodge.\n\nHe passed the remainder of the morning with his elbow on the table, his\nhead in his hands, the same as the day before, letting the hours grind\nslowly by, trying not to hear the rolling of the vehicles that were\nbearing away these credentials of his wealth.\n\nToward midday, the Keeper announced that an officer who had arrived a\nfew hours before in an automobile was inquiring for him.\n\nResponding to this summons, Desnoyers encountered outside the lodge,\na captain arrayed like the others in sheathed and pointed helmet,\nin mustard-colored uniform, red leather boots, sword, revolver,\nfield-glasses and geographic map hanging in a case from his belt. He\nappeared young; on his sleeve was the staff emblem.\n\n\"Do you know me? . . . I did not wish to pass through here without\nseeing you.\"\n\nHe spoke in Castilian, and Don Marcelo felt greater surprise at this\nthan at the many things which he had been experiencing so painfully\nduring the last twenty-four hours.\n\n\"You really do not know me?\" queried the German, always in Spanish. \"I\nam Otto. . . . Captain Otto von Hartrott.\"\n\nThe old man's mind went painfully down the staircase of memory, stopping\nthis time at a far-distant landing. There he saw the old ranch, and his\nbrother-in-law announcing the birth of his second son. \"I shall give\nhim Bismarck's name,\" Karl had said. Then, climbing back past many other\nplatforms, Desnoyers saw himself in Berlin during his visit to the\nvon Hartrott home where they were speaking proudly of Otto, almost\nas learned as the older brother, but devoting his talents entirely to\nmartial matters. He was then a lieutenant and studying for admission to\nthe General Staff. \"Who knows but he may turn out to be another Moltke?\"\nsaid the proud father . . . and the charming Chichi had thereupon\npromptly bestowed upon the warlike wonder a nickname, accepted through\nthe family. From that time, Otto was Moltkecito (the baby Moltke) to his\nParisian relatives.\n\nDesnoyers was astounded by the transformation which had meanwhile taken\nplace in the youth. This vigorous captain with the insolent air who\nmight shoot him at any minute was the same urchin whom he had seen\nrunning around the ranch, the beardless Moltkecito who had been the butt\nof his daughter's ridicule. . . .\n\nThe soldier, meanwhile, was explaining his presence there. He belonged\nto another division. There were many . . . many! They were advancing\nrapidly, forming an extensive and solid wall from Verdun to Paris. His\ngeneral had sent him to maintain the contact with the next division, but\nfinding himself near the castle, he had wished to visit it. A family tie\nwas not a mere word. He still remembered the days that he had spent at\nVilleblanche when the Hartrott family had paid a long visit to their\nrelatives in France. The officials now occupying the edifice had\ndetained him that he might lunch with them. One of them had casually\nmentioned that the owner of the castle was somewhere about although\nnobody knew exactly where. This had been a great surprise to Captain von\nHartrott who had tried to find him, regretting to see him taking refuge\nin the Warden's quarters.\n\n\"You must leave this hut; you are my uncle,\" he said haughtily. \"Return\nto your castle where you belong. My comrades will be much pleased to\nmake your acquaintance; they are very distinguished men.\"\n\nHe very much regretted whatever the old gentleman might have suffered.\n. . . He did not know exactly in what that suffering had consisted, but\nsurmised that the first moments of the invasion had been cruel ones for\nhim.\n\n\"But what else can you expect?\" he repeated several times. \"That is\nwar.\"\n\nAt the same time he approved of his having remained on his property.\nThey had special orders to seize the goods of the fugitives. Germany\nwished the inhabitants to remain in their dwellings as though nothing\nextraordinary had occurred. . . . Desnoyers protested. . . . \"But if the\ninvaders were shooting the innocent ones and burning their homes!\" . . .\nHis nephew prevented his saying more. He turned pale, an ashy hue\nspreading over his face; his eyes snapped and his face trembled like\nthat of the lieutenant who had taken possession of the castle.\n\n\"You refer to the execution of the mayor and the others. My comrades\nhave just been telling me about it; yet that castigation was very mild;\nthey should have completely destroyed the entire village. They should\nhave killed even the women and children. We've got to put an end to\nthese sharpshooters.\"\n\nHis uncle looked at him in amazement. His Moltkecito was as formidable\nand ferocious as the others. . . . But the captain brought the\nconversation to an abrupt close by repeating the monstrous and\neverlasting excuse.\n\n\"Very horrible, but what else can you expect! . . . That is war.\"\n\nHe then inquired after his mother, rejoicing to learn that she was in\nthe South. He had been uneasy at the idea of her remaining in Paris\n. . . especially with all those revolutions which had been breaking out\nthere lately! . . . Desnoyers looked doubtful as if he could not have\nheard correctly. What revolutions were those? . . . But the officer,\nwithout further explanation, resumed his conversation about his family,\ntaking it for granted that his relative would be impatient to learn the\nfate of his German kin.\n\nThey were all in magnificent state. Their illustrious father was\npresident of various patriotic societies (since his years no longer\npermitted him to go to war) and was besides organizing future industrial\nenterprises to improve the conquered countries. His brother, \"the Sage,\"\nwas giving lectures about the nations that the imperial victory\nwas bound to annex, censuring severely those whose ambitions were\nunpretending or weak. The remaining brothers were distinguishing\nthemselves in the army, one of them having been presented with a medal\nat Lorraine. The two sisters, although somewhat depressed by the absence\nof their fiances, lieutenants of the Hussars, were employing their\ntime in visiting the hospitals and begging God to chastise traitorous\nEngland.\n\nCaptain von Hartrott was slowly conducting his uncle toward the castle.\nThe gray and unbending soldiers who, until then, had been ignoring the\nexistence of Don Marcelo, looked at him with interest, now that he\nwas in intimate conversation with a member of the General Staff. He\nperceived that these men were about to humanize themselves by casting\naside temporarily their inexorable and aggressive automatonism.\n\nUpon entering his mansion something in his heart contracted with an\nagonizing shudder. Everywhere he could see dreadful vacancies, which\nmade him recall the objects which had formerly been there. Rectangular\nspots of stronger color announced the theft of furniture and paintings.\nWith what despatch and system the gentleman of the armlet had been doing\nhis work! . . . To the sadness that the cold and orderly spoliation\ncaused was added his indignation as an economical man, gazing upon the\nslashed curtains, spotted rugs, broken crystal and porcelain--all the\ndebris from a ruthless and unscrupulous occupation.\n\nHis nephew, divining his thoughts, could only offer the same old\nexcuse--\"What a mess! . . . But that is war!\"\n\nWith Moltkecito, he did not have to subside into the respectful\ncivilities of fear.\n\n\"That is NOT war!\" he thundered bitterly. \"It is an expedition of\nbandits. . . . Your comrades are nothing less than highwaymen.\"\n\nCaptain von Hartrott swelled up with a jerk. Separating himself from the\ncomplainant and looking fixedly at him, he spoke in a low voice, hissing\nwith wrath. \"Look here, uncle! It is a lucky thing for you that you have\nexpressed yourself in Spanish, and those around you could not understand\nyou. If you persist in such comments you will probably receive a bullet\nby way of an answer. The Emperor's officials permit no insults.\" And\nhis threatening attitude demonstrated the facility with which he could\nforget his relationship if he should receive orders to proceed against\nDon Marcelo.\n\nThus silenced, the vanquished proprietor hung his head. What was he\ngoing to do? . . . The Captain now renewed his affability as though he\nhad forgotten what he had just said. He wished to present him to his\ncompanions-at-arms. His Excellency, Count Meinbourg, the Major General,\nupon learning that he was a relative of the von Hartrotts, had done him\nthe honor of inviting him to his table.\n\nInvited into his own demesne, he finally reached the dining room, filled\nwith men in mustard color and high boots. Instinctively, he made\nan inventory of the room. All in good order, nothing broken--walls,\ndraperies and furniture still intact; but an appraising glance within\nthe sideboard again caused a clutch at his heart. Two entire table\nservices of silver, and another of old porcelain had disappeared without\nleaving the most insignificant of their pieces. He was obliged to\nrespond gravely to the presentations which his nephew was making, and\ntake the hand which the Count was extending with aristocratic languor.\nThe adversary began considering him with benevolence, on learning that\nhe was a millionaire from a distant land where riches were acquired very\nrapidly.\n\nSoon he was seated as a stranger at his own table, eating from the same\ndishes that his family were accustomed to use, served by men with shaved\nheads, wearing coarse, striped aprons over their uniforms. That which he\nwas eating was his, the wine was from his vaults; all that adorned\nthe room he had bought: the trees whose boughs were waving outside the\nwindow also belonged to him. . . . And yet he felt as though he were in\nthis place for the first time, with all the discomfort and diffidence of\na total stranger. He ate because he was hungry, but the food and wines\nseemed to have come from another planet.\n\nHe continued looking with consternation at those occupying the places of\nhis wife, children and the Lacours. . . .\n\nThey were speaking in German among themselves, but those having a\nlimited knowledge of French frequently availed themselves of that\nlanguage in order that their guest might understand them. Those who\ncould only mumble a few words, repeated them to an accompaniment of\namiable smiles. All were displaying an amicable desire to propitiate the\nowner of the castle.\n\n\"You are going to lunch with the barbarians,\" said the Count, offering\nhim a seat at his side. \"Aren't you afraid that we may eat you alive?\"\n\nThe Germans burst into roars of laughter at the wit of His Excellency.\nThey all took great pains to demonstrate by word and manner that\nbarbarity was wrongly attributed to them by their enemies.\n\nDon Marcelo looked from one to another. The fatigues of war, especially\nthe forced march of the last days, were very apparent in their persons.\nSome were tall and slender with an angular slimness; others were stocky\nand corpulent with short neck and head sunk between the shoulders.\nThese had lost much of their fat in a month's campaign, the wrinkled and\nflabby skin hanging in folds in various parts of their bodies. All had\nshaved heads, the same as the soldiers. Around the table shone two rows\nof cranial spheres, reddish or dark. Their ears stood out grotesquely,\nand their jaw bones were in strong relief owing to their thinness. Some\nhad preserved the upright moustache in the style of the Emperor; the\nmost of them were shaved or had a stubby tuft like a brush.\n\nA golden bracelet glistened on the wrist of the Count, stretched on\nthe table. He was the oldest of them all and the only one that kept\nhis hair, of a frosty red, carefully combed and glistening with pomade.\nAlthough about fifty years old, he still maintained a youthful\nvigor cultivated by exercise. Wrinkled, bony and strong, he tried\nto dissimulate his uncouthness as a man of battle under a suave and\nindolent laziness. The officers treated him with the greatest respect.\nHartrott told his uncle that the Count was a great artist, musician\nand poet. The Emperor was his friend; they had known each other from\nboyhood. Before the war, certain scandals concerning his private\nlife had exiled him from Court--mere lampoons of the socialists and\nscandal-mongers. The Kaiser had always kept a secret affection for\nhis former chum. Everybody remembered his dance, \"The Caprices of\nScheherazade,\" represented with the greatest luxury in Berlin through\nthe endorsement of his powerful friend, William II. The Count had lived\nmany years in the Orient. In fact, he was a great gentleman and an\nartist of exquisite sensibility as well as a soldier.\n\nSince Desnoyers was now his guest, the Count could not permit him\nto remain silent, so he made an opportunity of bringing him into the\nconversation.\n\n\"Did you see any of the insurrections? . . . Did the troops have to kill\nmany people? How about the assassination of Poincare? . . .\"\n\nHe asked these questions in quick succession and Don Marcelo, bewildered\nby their absurdity, did not know how to reply. He believed that he must\nhave fallen in with a feast of fools. Then he suspected that they were\nmaking fun of him. Uprisings? Assassinations of the President? . . .\n\nSome gazed at him with pity because of his ignorance, others with\nsuspicion, believing that he was merely pretending not to know of these\nevents which had happened so near him.\n\nHis nephew insisted. \"The daily papers in Germany have been full\nof accounts of these matters. Fifteen days ago, the people of Paris\nrevolted against the Government, bombarding the Palais de l'Elysee, and\nassassinating the President. The army had to resort to the machine guns\nbefore order could be restored. . . . Everybody knows that.\"\n\nBut Desnoyers insisted that he did not know it, that nobody had\nseen such things. And as his words were received in an atmosphere of\nmalicious doubt, he preferred to be silent. His Excellency, superior\nspirit, incapable of being associated with the popular credulity, here\nintervened to set matters straight. The report of the assassination was,\nperhaps, not certain; the German periodicals might have unconsciously\nexaggerated it. Just a few hours ago, the General of the Staff had\ntold him of the flight of the French Government to Bordeaux, and the\nstatement about the revolution in Paris and the firing of the French\ntroops was indisputable. \"The gentleman has seen it all without doubt,\nbut does not wish to admit it.\" Desnoyers felt obliged to contradict\nthis lordling, but his negative was not even listened to.\n\nParis! This name made all eyes glisten and everybody talkative. As soon\nas possible they wished to reach the Eiffel Tower, to enter victorious\ninto the city, to receive their recompense for the privations and\nfatigues of a month's campaign. They were devotees of military glory,\nthey considered war necessary to existence, and yet they were bewailing\nthe hardship that it was imposing upon them. The Count exhaled the\nplaint of the craftsmaster.\n\n\"Oh, the havoc that this war has brought in my plans!\" he sighed. \"This\nwinter they were going to bring out my dance in Paris!\"\n\nThey all protested at his sadness; his work would surely be presented\nafter the triumph, and the French would have to recognize it.\n\n\"It will not be the same thing,\" complained the Count. \"I confess that I\nadore Paris. . . . What a pity that these people have never wished to\nbe on familiar terms with us!\" . . . And he relapsed into the silence of\nthe unappreciated man.\n\nDesnoyers suddenly recognized in one of the officers who was talking,\nwith eyes bulging with covetousness, of the riches of Paris, the Chief\nThief with the band on his arm. He it was who so methodically had\nsacked the castle. As though divining the old Frenchman's thought, the\ncommissary began excusing himself.\n\n\"It is war, monsieur. . . .\"\n\nThe same as the others! . . . War had to be paid with the treasures of\nthe conquered. That was the new German system; the healthy return to\nthe wars of ancient days; tributes imposed on the cities, and each house\nsacked separately. In this way, the enemy's resistance would be more\neffectually overcome and the war soon brought to a close. He ought\nnot to be downcast over the appropriations, for his furnishings and\nornaments would all be sold in Germany. After the French defeat, he\ncould place a remonstrance claim with his government, petitioning it to\nindemnify his loss; his relatives in Berlin would support his demand.\n\nDesnoyers listened in consternation to his counsels. What kind of\nmentality had these men, anyway? Were they insane, or were they trying\nto have some fun at his expense? . . .\n\nWhen the lunch was at last ended, the officers arose and adjusted their\nswords for service. Captain von Hartrott rose, too; it was necessary for\nhim to return to his general; he had already dedicated too much time\nto family expansion. His uncle accompanied him to the automobile where\nMoltkecito once more justified the ruin and plunder of the castle.\n\n\"It is war. . . . We have to be very ruthless that it may not last long.\nTrue kindness consists in being cruel, because then the terror-stricken\nenemy gives in sooner, and so the world suffers less.\"\n\nDon Marcelo shrugged his shoulders before this sophistry. In the\ndoorway, the captain gave some orders to a soldier who soon returned\nwith a bit of chalk which had been used to number the lodging places.\nVon Hartrott wished to protect his uncle and began tracing on the wall\nnear the door:--\"Bitte, nicht plundern. Es sind freundliche Leute.\"\n\nIn response to the old man's repeated questions, he then translated the\ninscription. \"It means, 'Please do not sack this house. Its occupants\nare kind people . . . friendly people.'\"\n\nAh, no! . . . Desnoyers repelled this protection vehemently. He did not\nwish to be kind. He was silent because he could not be anything else.\n. . . But a friend of the invaders of his country! . . . No, NO, NO!\n\nHis nephew rubbed out part of the lettering, leaving the first words,\n\"Bitte, nicht plundern.\" Then he repeated the scrawled request at the\nentrance of the park. He thought this notice advisable because His\nExcellency might go away and other officials might be installed in the\ncastle. Von Hartrott had seen much and his smile seemed to imply that\nnothing could surprise him, no matter how outrageous it might be. But\nhis relative continued scorning his protection, and laughing bitterly at\nthe impromptu signboard. What more could they carry off? . . . Had they\nnot already stolen the best?\n\n\"Good-bye, uncle! Soon we shall meet in Paris.\"\n\nAnd the captain climbed into his automobile, extending a soft, cold hand\nthat seemed to repel the old man with its flabbiness.\n\nUpon returning to his castle, he saw a table and some chairs in the\nshadow of a group of trees. His Excellency was taking his coffee in the\nopen air, and obliged him to take a seat beside him. Only three officers\nwere keeping him company. . . . There was here a grand consumption of\nliquors from his wine cellars. They were talking together in German, and\nfor an hour Don Marcelo remained there, anxious to go but never finding\nthe opportune moment to leave his seat and disappear.\n\nHe employed his time in imagining the great stir among the troops hidden\nby the trees. Another division of the army was passing by with the\nincessant, deafening roar of the sea. An inexplicable phenomenon kept\nthe luminous calm of the afternoon in a continuous state of vibration.\nA constant thundering sounded afar off as though an invisible storm were\nalways approaching from beyond the blue horizon line.\n\nThe Count, noticing his evident interest in the noise, interrupted his\nGerman chat to explain.\n\n\"It is the cannon. A battle is going on. Soon we shall join in the\ndance.\"\n\nThe possibility of having to give up his quarters here, the most\ncomfortable that he had found in all the campaign, put His Excellency in\na bad humor.\n\n\"War,\" he sighed, \"a glorious life, but dirty and deadening! In an\nentire month--to-day is the first that I have lived as a gentleman.\"\n\nAnd as though attracted by the luxuries that he might shortly have to\nabandon, he rose and went toward the castle. Two of the Germans betook\nthemselves toward the village, and Desnoyers remained with the other\nofficer who was delightfully sampling his liquors. He was the chief of\nthe battalion encamped in the village.\n\n\"This is a sad war, Monsieur!\" he said in French.\n\nOf all the inimical group, this man was the only one for whom Don\nMarcelo felt a vague attraction. \"Although a German, he appears a good\nsort,\" meditated the old man, eyeing him carefully. In times of peace,\nhe must have been stout, but now he showed the loose and flaccid\nexterior of one who has just lost much in weight. Desnoyers surmised\nthat the man had formerly lived in tranquil and vulgar sensuousness, in\na middle-class happiness suddenly cut short by war.\n\n\"What a life, Monsieur!\" the officer rambled on. \"May God punish well\nthose who have provoked this catastrophe!\"\n\nThe Frenchman was almost affected. This man represented the Germany that\nhe had many times imagined, a sweet and tranquil Germany composed of\nburghers, a little heavy and slow perhaps, but atoning for their natural\nuncouthness by an innocent and poetic sentimentalism. This Blumhardt\nwhom his companions called Bataillon-Kommandeur, was undoubtedly the\ngood father of a large family. He fancied him walking with his wife and\nchildren under the lindens of a provincial square, all listening with\nreligious unction to the melodies played by a military band. Then he\nsaw him in the beer gardens with his friends, discussing metaphysical\nproblems between business conversations. He was a man from old Germany,\na character from a romance by Goethe. Perhaps the glory of the Empire\nhad modified his existence, and instead of going to the beer gardens,\nhe was now accustomed to frequent the officers' casino, while his family\nmaintained a separate existence--separated from the civilians by the\nsuperciliousness of military caste; but at heart, he was always the good\nGerman, ready to weep copiously before an affecting family scene or a\nfragment of good music.\n\nCommandant Blumhardt, meanwhile, was thinking of his family living in\nCassel.\n\n\"There are eight children, Monsieur,\" he said with a visible effort to\ncontrol emotion. \"The two eldest are preparing to become officers. The\nyoungest is starting school this year. . . . He is just so high.\"\n\nAnd with his right hand he measured off the child's diminutive stature.\nHe trembled with laughter and grief at recalling the little chap. Then\nhe broke forth into eulogies about his wife--excellent manager of the\nhome, a mother who was always modestly sacrificing herself for her\nchildren and husband. Ay, the sweet Augusta! . . . After twenty years of\nmarried life, he adored her as on the day he first saw her. In a pocket\nof his uniform, he was keeping all the letters that she had written him\nsince the beginning of the campaign.\n\n\"Look at her, Monsieur. . . . There are my children.\"\n\nFrom his breast pocket, he had drawn forth a silver medallion, adorned\nwith the art of Munich, and touching a spring, he displayed the pictures\nof all the family--the Frau Kommandeur, of an austere and frigid beauty,\nimitating the air and coiffure of the Empress; the Frauleine Kommandeur,\nclad in white, with uplifted eyes as though they were singing a musical\nromance; and at the end, the children in the uniforms of the army\nschools or private institutions. And to think that he might lose these\nbeloved beings if a bit of iron should hit him! . . . And he had to live\nfar from them now that it was such fine weather for long walks in the\ncountry! . . .\n\n\"Sad war!\" he again said. \"May God punish the English!\"\n\nWith a solicitude that Don Marcelo greatly appreciated, he in turn\ninquired about the Frenchman's family. He pitied him for having so few\nchildren, and smiled a little over the enthusiasm with which the old\ngentleman spoke of his daughter, saluting Fraulein Chichi as a witty\nsprite, and expressing great sympathy on learning that the only son was\ncausing his parents great sorrow by his conduct.\n\nTender-hearted Commandant! . . . He was the first rational and human\nbeing that he had met in this hell of an invasion. \"There are good\npeople everywhere,\" he told himself. He hoped that this new acquaintance\nwould not be moved from the castle; for if the Germans had to stay\nthere, it would better be this man than the others.\n\nAn orderly came to summon Don Marcelo to the presence of His Excellency.\nAfter passing through the salons with closed eyes so as to avoid useless\ndistress and wrath, he found the Count in his own bedroom. The doors had\nbeen forced open, the floors stripped of carpet and the window frames of\ncurtains. Only the pieces of furniture broken in the first moments now\noccupied their former places. The sleeping rooms had been stripped more\nmethodically, everything having been taken that was not required for\nimmediate use. Because the General with his suite had been lodging there\nthe night before, this apartment had escaped the arbitrary destruction.\n\nThe Count received him with the civility of a grandee who wishes to be\nattentive to his guests. He could not consent that HERR Desnoyers--a\nrelative of a von Hartrott--whom he vaguely remembered having seen at\nCourt, should be staying in the Keeper's lodge. He must return to his\nown room, occupying that bed, solemn as a catafalque with columns and\nplumes, which had had the honor, a few hours before, of serving as the\nresting-place of an illustrious General of the Empire.\n\n\"I myself prefer to sleep here,\" he added condescendingly. \"This other\nhabitation accords better with my tastes.\"\n\nWhile saying this, he was entering Dona Luisa's rooms, admiring its\nLouis Quinze furniture of genuine value, with its dull golds and\ntapestries mellowed by time. It was one of the most successful purchases\nthat Don Marcelo had made. The Count smiled with an artist's scorn as he\nrecalled the man who had superintended the official sacking.\n\n\"What an ass! . . . To think that he left this behind, supposing that it\nwas old and ugly!\"\n\nThen he looked the owner of the castle squarely in the face.\n\n\"Monsieur Desnoyers, I do not believe that I am committing any\nindiscretion, and even imagine that I am interpreting your desires when\nI inform you that I intend taking this set of furniture with me. It will\nserve as a souvenir of our acquaintance, a testimony to the friendship\nspringing up between us. . . . If it remains here, it will run the risk\nof being destroyed. Warriors, of course, are not obliged to be artists.\nI will guard these excellent treasures in Germany where you may see them\nwhenever you wish. We are all going to be one nation, you know. . . . My\nfriend, the Emperor, is soon to be proclaimed sovereign of the French.\"\n\nDesnoyers remained silent. How could he reply to that look of cruel\nirony, to the grimace with which the noble lord was underscoring his\nwords? . . .\n\n\"When the war is ended, I will send you a gift from Berlin,\" he added in\na patronizing tone.\n\nThe old collector could say nothing to that, either. He was looking\nat the vacant spots which many small pictures had left on the walls,\npaintings by famous masters of the XVIII century. The banded brigand\nmust also have passed these by as too insignificant to carry off,\nbut the smirk illuminating the Count's face revealed their ultimate\ndestination.\n\nHe had carefully scrutinized the entire apartment--the adjoining\nbedroom, Chichi's, the bathroom, even the feminine robe-room of the\nfamily, which still contained some of the daughter's gowns. The warrior\nfondled with delight the fine silky folds of the materials, gloating\nover their cool softness.\n\nThis contact made him think of Paris, of the fashions, of the\nestablishments of the great modistes. The rue de la Paix was the spot\nwhich he most admired in his visits to the enemy's city.\n\nDon Marcelo noticed the strong mixture of perfumes which came from\nhis hair, his moustache, his entire body. Various little jars from the\ndressing table were on the mantel.\n\n\"What a filthy thing war is!\" exclaimed the German. \"This morning I was\nat last able to take a bath after a week's abstinence; at noon I shall\ntake another. By the way, my dear sir, these perfumes are good, but\nthey are not elegant. When I have the pleasure of being presented to the\nladies, I shall give them the addresses of my source of supply. . . . I\nuse in my home essences from Turkey. I have many friends there. . . . At\nthe close of the war, I will send a consignment to the family.\"\n\nWhile speaking the Count's eyes had been fixed upon some photographs\nupon the table. Examining the portrait of Madame Desnoyers, he\nguessed that she must be Dona Luisa. He smiled before the bewitchingly\nmischievous face of Mademoiselle Chichi. Very enchanting; he specially\nadmired her militant, boyish expression; but he scrutinized the\nphotograph of Julio with special interest.\n\n\"Splendid type of youth,\" he murmured. \"An interesting head, and\nartistic, too. He would create a great sensation in a fancy-dress ball.\nWhat a Persian prince he would make! . . . A white aigrette on his head,\nfastened with a great jewel, the breast bared, a black tunic with golden\nbirds. . . .\"\n\nAnd he continued seeing in his mind's eye the heir of the Desnoyers\narrayed in all the gorgeous raiment of an Oriental monarch. The proud\nfather, because of the interest which his son was inspiring, began to\nfeel a glimmer of sympathy with the man. A pity that he should select so\nunerringly and appropriate the choicest things in the castle!\n\nNear the head of the bed, Don Marcelo saw lying upon a book of devotions\nforgotten by his wife, a medallion containing another photograph. It did\nnot belong to his family, and the Count, following the direction of his\neyes, wished to show it to him. The hands of this son of Mars trembled.\n. . . His disdainful haughtiness had suddenly disappeared. An official\nof the Hussars of Death was smiling from the case; his sharp profile\nwith a beak curved like a bird of prey, was surmounted by a cap adorned\nwith skull and cross-bones.\n\n\"My best friend,\" said the Count in tremulous tones. \"The being that I\nlove most in all the world. . . . And to think that at this moment he\nmay be fighting, and they may kill him! . . . To think that I, too, may\ndie!\"\n\nDesnoyers believed that he must be getting a glimpse into a romance of\nthe nobleman's past. That Hussar was undoubtedly his natural son. His\nsimplicity of mind could not conceive of anything else. Only a father's\ntenderness could so express itself . . . and he was almost touched by\nthis tenderness.\n\nHere the interview came to an end, the warrior turning his back as he\nleft the room in order to hide his emotion. A few minutes after was\nheard on the floor below the sound of a grand piano which the Commissary\nhad not been able to carry off, owing to the general's interposition.\nHis voice was soon heard above the chords that he was playing. It was\nrather a lifeless baritone, but he managed to impart an impassioned\ntremolo to his romance. The listening old man was now really affected;\nhe did not understand the words, but the tears came into his eyes. He\nthought of his family, of the sorrows and dangers about them and of the\ndifficulties surrounding his return to them. . . . As though under the\nspell of the melody, little by little, he descended the stairs. What\nan artist's soul that haughty scoffer had! . . . At first sight, the\nGermans with their rough exterior and their discipline which made them\ncommit the greatest atrocities, gave one a wrong impression. One had to\nlive intimately with them to appreciate their true worth.\n\nBy the time the music had ceased, he had reached the castle bridge. A\nsub-officer was watching the graceful movements of the swans gliding\ndouble over the waters of the moat. He was a young Doctor of Laws who\njust now was serving as secretary to His Excellency--a university man\nmobilized by the war.\n\nOn speaking with Don Marcelo, he immediately revealed his academic\ntraining. The order for departure had surprised the professor in a\nprivate institute; he was just about to be married and all his plans had\nbeen upset.\n\n\"What a calamity, sir! . . . What an overturning for the world! . . .\nYet many of us have foreseen that this catastrophe simply had to come.\nWe have felt strongly that it might break out any day. Capital, accursed\nCapital is to blame.\"\n\nThe speaker was a Socialist. He did not hesitate to admit his\nco-operation in certain acts of his party that had brought persecutions\nand set-backs to his career. But the Social-Democracy was now being\naccepted by the Emperor and flattered by the most reactionary Junkers.\nAll were now one. The deputies of his party were forming in the\nReichstag the group most obedient to the government. . . . The only\nbelief that it retained from its former creed, was its anathematization\nof Capital--responsible for the war.\n\nDesnoyers ventured to disagree with this enemy who appeared of an\namiable and tolerant character. \"Did he not think that the real\nresponsibility rested with German militarism? Had it not sought and\nprepared this conflict, by its arrogance preventing any settlement?\"\n\nThe Socialist denied this roundly. His deputies were supporting the war\nand, therefore, must have good reason. Everything that he said showed an\nabsolute submission to discipline--the eternal German discipline, blind\nand obedient, which was dominating even the most advanced parties. In\nvain the Frenchman repeated arguments and facts which everybody had read\nfrom the beginning of the war. His words simply slid over the calloused\nbrains of this revolutionist, accustomed to delegating all his reasoning\nfunctions to others.\n\n\"Who can tell?\" he finally said. \"Perhaps we have made a mistake. But\njust at this moment all is confused; the premises which would enable us\nto draw exact conclusions are lacking. When the conflict ends, we shall\nknow the truly guilty parties, and if they are ours we shall throw the\nresponsibility upon them.\"\n\nDesnoyers could hardly keep from laughing at his simplicity. To wait\ntill the end of the war to know who was to blame! . . . And if the\nEmpire should come out conqueror, what responsibility could the\nSocialists exact in the full pride of victory, they who always confined\nthemselves to electoral battles, without the slightest attempt at\nrebellion?\n\n\"Whatever the cause may be,\" concluded the Socialist, \"this war is very\nsad. How many dead! . . . I was at Charleroi. One has to see modern\nwarfare close by. . . . We shall conquer; we are going to enter Paris,\nso they say, but many of our men must fall before obtaining the final\nvictory.\"\n\nAnd as though wishing to put these visions of death out of his mind, he\nresumed his diversion of watching the swans, offering them bits of bread\nso as to make them swing around in their slow and majestic course.\n\nThe Keeper and his family were continually crossing and recrossing the\nbridge. Seeing their master on such friendly terms with the invaders,\nthey had lost some of the fear which had kept them shut up in their\ncottage. To the woman it seemed but natural that Don Marcelo's authority\nshould be recognized by these people; the master is always the master.\nAnd as though she had received a part of this authority, she was\nentering the castle fearlessly, followed by her daughter, in order to\nput in order her master's sleeping room. They had decided to pass the\nnight in rooms near his, that he might not feel so lonely among the\nGermans.\n\nThe two women were carrying bedding and mattresses from the lodge to\nthe top floor. The Keeper was occupied in heating a second bath for His\nExcellency while his wife was bemoaning with gestures of despair the\nsacking of the castle. How many exquisite things had disappeared! . . .\nDesirous of saving the remainder, she besought her master to make\ncomplaints, as though he could prevent the individual and stealthy\nrobberies. The orderlies and followers of the Count were pocketing\neverything they could lay their hands on, saying smilingly that\nthey were souvenirs. Later on the woman approached Desnoyers with a\nmysterious air to impart a new revelation. She had seen a head officer\nforce open the chiffoniers where her mistress was accustomed to keep her\nlingerie, and he was making up a package of the finest pieces, including\na great quantity of blonde lace.\n\n\"That's the one, Master,\" she said soon after, pointing to a German\nwho was writing in the garden, where an oblique ray of sunlight was\nfiltering through the branches upon his table.\n\nDon Marcelo recognized him with surprise. Commandant Blumhardt, too!\n. . . But immediately he excused the act. He supposed it was only\nnatural that this official should want to take something away from the\ncastle, since the Count had set the example. Besides, he took into\naccount the quality of the objects which he was appropriating. They were\nnot for himself; they were for the wife, for the daughters. . . . A good\nfather of his family! For more than an hour now, he had been sitting\nbefore that table writing incessantly, conversing, pen in hand, with his\nAugusta and all the family in Cassel. Better that this good man should\ncarry off his stuff than those other domineering officers with cutting\nvoices and insolent stiffness.\n\nDesnoyers noticed, too, that the writer raised his head every time that\nGeorgette, the Warden's daughter, passed by, following her with his\neyes. The poor father! . . . Undoubtedly he was comparing her with his\ntwo girls home in Germany, with all their thoughts on the war. He, too,\nwas thinking of Chichi, fearing sometimes, that he might never see her\nagain. In one of her trips from the castle to her home, Blumhardt called\nthe child to him. She stopped before the table, timid and shrinking as\nthough she felt a presentiment of danger, but making an effort to smile.\nThe Prussian father meanwhile chatted with her, and patted her cheeks\nwith his great paws--a sight which touched Desnoyers deeply. The\nmemories of a pacific and virtuous life were rising above the horrors of\nwar. Decidedly this one enemy was a good man, anyway.\n\nBecause of his conclusion, the millionaire smiled indulgently when the\nCommandant, leaving the table, came toward him--after delivering\nhis letter and a bulky package to a soldier to take to the battalion\npost-office in the village.\n\n\"It is for my family,\" he explained. \"I do not let a day pass without\nsending them a letter. Theirs are so precious to me! . . . I am also\nsending them a few remembrances.\"\n\nDesnoyers was on the point of protesting. . . . But with a shrug of\nindifference, he concluded to keep silence as if he did not object. The\nCommandant continued talking of the sweet Augusta and their children\nwhile the invisible tempest kept on thundering beyond the serene\ntwilight horizon. Each time the cannonading was more intense.\n\n\"The battle,\" continued Blumhardt. \"Always a battle! . . . Surely it is\nthe last and we are going to win. Within the week, we shall be entering\nParis. . . . But how many will never see it! So many dead! . . . I\nunderstand that to-morrow we shall not be here. All the Reserves are to\ncombine with the attack so as to overcome the last resistance. . . . If\nonly I do not fall!\" . . .\n\nThoughts of the possibility of death the following day contracted his\nforehead in a scowl of hatred. A deep, vertical line was parting his\neyebrows. He frowned ferociously at Desnoyers as though making him\nresponsible for his death and the trouble of his family. For a few\nmoments Don Marcelo could hardly recognize this man, transformed by\nwarlike passions, as the sweet-natured and friendly Blumhardt of a\nlittle while before.\n\nThe sun was beginning to set when a sub-officer, the one of the\nSocial-Democracy, came running in search of the Commandant. Desnoyers\ncould not understand what was the matter because they were speaking\nin German, but following the direction of the messenger's continual\npointing, he saw beyond the iron gates a group of country people and\nsome soldiers with guns. Blumhardt, after a brief reflection, started\ntoward the group and Don Marcelo behind him.\n\nSoon he saw a village lad in the charge of some Germans who were holding\ntheir bayonets to his breast. His face was colorless, with the whiteness\nof a wax candle. His shirt, blackened with soot, was so badly torn that\nit told of a hand-to-hand struggle. On one temple was a gash, bleeding\nbadly. A short distance away was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding\na baby, and surrounded by four children all covered with black grime as\nthough coming from a coal mine.\n\nThe woman was pleading desperately, raising her hands appealingly, her\nsobs interrupting her story which she was uselessly trying to tell the\nsoldiers, incapable of understanding her. The petty officer convoying\nthe band spoke in German with the Commandant while the woman besought\nthe intervention of Desnoyers. When she recognized the owner of the\ncastle, she suddenly regained her serenity, believing that he could\nintercede for her.\n\nThat husky young boy was her son. They had all been hiding since the\nday before in the cellar of their burned house. Hunger and the danger\nof death from asphyxiation had forced them finally to venture forth. As\nsoon as the Germans had seen her son, they had beaten him and were going\nto shoot him as they were shooting all the young men. They believed that\nthe lad was twenty years old, the age of a soldier, and in order that he\nmight not join the French army, they were going to kill him.\n\n\"It's a lie!\" shrieked the mother. \"He is not more than eighteen . . .\nnot eighteen . . . a little less--he's only seventeen.\"\n\nShe turned to those who were following behind, in order to implore their\ntestimony--sad women, equally dirty, their ragged garments smelling of\nfire, poverty and death. All assented, adding their outcries to those of\nthe mother. Some even went so far as to say that the overgrown boy was\nonly sixteen . . . fifteen! And to this feminine chorus was added the\nwailing of the little ones looking at their brother with eyes distended\nwith terror.\n\nThe Commandant examined the prisoner while he listened to the official.\nAn employee of the township had said carelessly that the child was about\ntwenty, never dreaming that with this inaccuracy he was causing his\ndeath.\n\n\"It was a lie!\" repeated the mother guessing instinctively what they\nwere saying. \"That man made a mistake. My boy is robust and, therefore,\nlooks older than he is, but he is not twenty. . . . The gentleman\nfrom the castle who knows him can tell you so. Is it not so, Monsieur\nDesnoyers?\"\n\nSince, in her maternal desperation, she had appealed to his protection,\nDon Marcelo believed that he ought to intervene, and so he spoke to\nthe Commandant. He knew this youth very well (he did not ever remember\nhaving seen him before) and believed that he really was under twenty.\n\n\"And even if he were of age,\" he added, \"is that a crime to shoot a man\nfor?\"\n\nBlumhardt did not reply. Since he had recovered his functions of\ncommand, he ignored absolutely Don Marcelo's existence. He was about to\nsay something, to give an order, but hesitated. It might be better to\nconsult His Excellency . . . and seeing that he was going toward the\ncastle, Desnoyers marched by his side.\n\n\"Commandant, this cannot be,\" he commenced saying. \"This lacks common\nsense. To shoot a man on the suspicion that he may be twenty years old!\"\n\nBut the Commandant remained silent and continued on his way. As they\ncrossed the bridge, they heard the sound of the piano--a good omen,\nDesnoyers thought. The aesthete who had so touched him with his\nimpassioned voice, was going to say the saving word.\n\nOn entering the salon, he did not at first recognize His Excellency.\nHe saw a man sitting at the piano wearing no clothing but a Japanese\ndressing gown--a woman's rose-colored kimono, embroidered with golden\nbirds, belonging to Chichi. At any other time, he would have burst into\nroars of laughter at beholding this scrawny, bony warrior with the\ncruel eyes, with his brawny braceleted arms appearing through the loose\nsleeves. After taking his bath, the Count had delayed putting on his\nuniform, luxuriating in the silky contact of the feminine tunic so like\nhis Oriental garments in Berlin. Blumhardt did not betray the slightest\nastonishment at the aspect of his general. In the customary attitude\nof military erectness, he spoke in his own language while the Count\nlistened with a bored air, meanwhile passing his fingers idly over the\nkeys.\n\nA shaft of sunlight from a nearby window was enveloping the piano and\nmusician in a halo of gold. Through the window, too, was wafting the\npoetry of the sunset--the rustling of the leaves, the hushed song of the\nbirds and the hum of the insects whose transparent wings were glowing\nlike sparks in the last rays of the sun. The General, annoyed that his\ndreaming melancholy should be interrupted by this inopportune visit, cut\nshort the Commandant's story with a gesture of command and a word . . .\none word only. He said no more. He took two puffs from a Turkish\ncigarette that was slowly scorching the wood of the piano, and again\nran his hands over the ivory keys, catching up the broken threads of the\nvague and tender improvisation inspired by the gloaming.\n\n\"Thanks, Your Excellency,\" said the gratified Desnoyers, surmising his\nmagnanimous response.\n\nThe Commandant had disappeared, nor could the Frenchman find him outside\nthe castle. A soldier was pacing up and down near the iron gates in\norder to transmit commands, and the guards were pushing back with blows\nfrom their guns, a screaming group of women and tiny children. The\nentrance was entirely cleared! undoubtedly the crowds were returning\nto the village after the General's pardon. . . . Desnoyers was half way\ndown the avenue when he heard a howling sound composed of many voices, a\nhair-raising shriek such as only womanly desperation can send forth. At\nthe same time, the air was vibrating with snaps, the loud cracking sound\nthat he knew from the day before. Shots! . . . He imagined that on\nthe other side of the iron railing there were some writhing bodies\nstruggling to escape from powerful arms, and others fleeing with bounds\nof fear. He saw running toward him a horror-stricken, sobbing woman with\nher hands to her head. It was the wife of the Keeper who a little while\nbefore had joined the desperate group of women.\n\n\"Oh, don't go on, Master,\" she called stopping his hurried step. \"They\nhave killed him. . . . They have just shot him.\"\n\nDon Marcelo stood rooted to the ground. Shot! . . . and after the\nGeneral's pardon! . . . Suddenly he ran back to the castle, hardly\nknowing what he was doing, and soon reached the salon. His Excellency\nwas still at the piano humming in low tones, his eyes moistened by the\npoesy of his dreams. But the breathless old gentleman did not stop to\nlisten.\n\n\"They have shot him, Your Excellency. . . . They have just killed him in\nspite of your order.\"\n\nThe smile which crossed the Count's face immediately informed him of his\nmistake.\n\n\"That is war, my dear sir,\" said the player, pausing for a moment. \"War\nwith its cruel necessities. . . . It is always expedient to destroy the\nenemy of to-morrow.\"\n\nAnd with a pedantic air as though he were giving a lesson, he discoursed\nabout the Orientals, great masters of the art of living. One of the\npersonages most admired by him was a certain Sultan of the Turkish\nconquest who, with his own hands, had strangled the sons of the\nadversary. \"Our foes do not come into the world on horseback and\nbrandishing the lance,\" said that hero. \"All are born as children, and\nit is advisable to wipe them from the face of the earth before they grow\nup.\"\n\nDesnoyers listened without taking it in. One thought only was occupying\nhis mind. . . . That man that he had supposed just, that sentimentalist\nso affected by his own singing, had, between two arpeggios, coldly given\nthe order for death! . . .\n\nThe Count made a gesture of impatience. He might retire now, and he\ncounselled him to be more discreet in the future, avoiding mixing\nhimself up in the affairs of the service. Then he turned his back,\nrunning his hands over the piano, and giving himself up to harmonious\nmelancholy.\n\nFor Don Marcelo there now began an absurd life of the most extraordinary\nevents, an experience which was going to last four days. In his life\nhistory, this period represented a long parenthesis of stupefaction,\nslashed by the most horrible visions.\n\nNot wishing to meet these men again, he abandoned his own bedroom,\ntaking refuge on the top floor in the servants' quarters, near the\nroom selected by the Warden and his family. In vain the good woman kept\noffering him things to eat as the night came on--he had no appetite. He\nlay stretched out on the bed, preferring to be alone with his thoughts\nin the dark. When would this martyrdom ever come to an end? . . .\n\nThere came into his mind the recollection of a trip which he had made\nto London some years ago. In his imagination he again saw the British\nMuseum and certain Assyrian bas-reliefs--relics of bestial humanity,\nwhich had filled him with terror. The warriors were represented as\nburning the towns; the prisoners were beheaded in heaps; the pacific\ncountrymen were marching in lines with chains on their necks, forming\nstrings of slaves. Until that moment he had never realized the advance\nwhich civilization had made through the centuries. Wars were still\nbreaking out now and then, but they had been regulated by the march of\nprogress. The life of the prisoner was now held sacred; the captured\ntowns must be respected; there existed a complete code of international\nlaw to regulate how men should be killed and nations should combat,\ncausing the least possible harm. . . . But now he had just seen the\nprimitive realities of war. The same as that of thousands of years ago!\nThe men with the helmets were proceeding in exactly the same way as\nthose ferocious and perfumed satraps with blue mitre and curled beard.\nThe adversary was shot although not carrying arms; the prisoner died of\nshot or blow from the gun; the civilian captives were sent in crowds\nto Germany like those of other centuries. Of what avail was all our\nso-called Progress? Where was our boasted civilization? . . .\n\nHe was awakened by the light of a candle in his eyes. The Warden's wife\nhad come up again to see if he needed anything.\n\n\"Oh, what a night, Master! Just hear them yelling and singing! The\nbottles that they have emptied! . . . They are in the dining room. You\nbetter not see them. Now they are amusing themselves by breaking the\nfurniture. Even the Count is drunk; drunk, too, is that Commandant that\nyou were talking with, and all the rest. . . . Some of them are dancing\nhalf-naked.\"\n\nShe evidently wished to keep quiet about certain details, but her love\nof talking got the better of her discretion. Some of the officers had\ndressed themselves up in the hats and gowns of her mistress and were\ndancing and shouting, imitating feminine seductiveness and affectations.\n. . . One of them had been greeted with roars of enthusiasm upon\npresenting himself with no other clothing than a \"combination\" of\nMademoiselle Chichi's. Many were taking obscene delight in soiling the\nrugs and filling the sideboard drawers with indescribable filth, using\nthe finest linens that they could lay their hands on.\n\nHer master silenced her peremptorily. Why tell him such vile, disgusting\nthings? . . .\n\n\"And we are obliged to wait on them!\" wailed the woman. \"They are beside\nthemselves; they appear like different beings. The soldiers are saying\nthat they are going to resume their march at daybreak. There is a\ngreat battle on, and they are going to win it; but it is necessary that\neveryone of them should fight in it. . . . My poor, sick husband just\ncan't stand it any longer. So many humiliations . . . and my little girl\n. . . . My little girl!\"\n\nThe child was her greatest anxiety. She had her well hidden away, but\nshe was watching uneasily the goings and comings of some of these\nmen maddened with alcohol. The most terrible of them all was that fat\nofficer who had patted Georgette so paternally.\n\nApprehension for her daughter's safety made her hurry restlessly away,\nsaying over and over:\n\n\"God has forgotten the world. . . . Ay, what is ever going to become of\nus!\"\n\nDon Marcelo was now tinglingly awake. Through the open window was\nblowing the clear night air. The cannonading was still going on,\nprolonging the conflict way into the night. Below the castle the\nsoldiers were intoning a slow and melodious chant that sounded like a\npsalm. From the interior of the edifice rose the whoopings of brutal\nlaughter, the crash of breaking furniture, and the mad chase of\ndissolute pursuit. When would this diabolical orgy ever wear itself\ndown? . . . For a long time he was not at all sleepy, but was gradually\nlosing consciousness of what was going on around him when he was roused\nwith a start. Near him, on the same floor, a door had fallen with a\ncrash, unable to resist a succession of formidable batterings. This\nwas followed immediately by the screams of a woman, weeping, desperate\nsupplications, the noise of a struggle, reeling steps, and the thud of\nbodies against the wall. He had a presentiment that it was Georgette\nshrieking and trying to defend herself. Before he could put his feet to\nthe floor he heard a man's voice, which he was sure was the Keeper's;\nshe was safe.\n\n\"Ah, you villain!\" . . .\n\nThen the outbreak of a second struggle . . . a shot . . . silence!\n\nRushing down the hallway that ended at the stairway Desnoyers saw\nlights, and many men who came trooping up the stairs, bounding over\nseveral steps at a time. He almost fell over a body from which escaped a\ngroan of agony. At his feet lay the Warden, his chest moving like a pair\nof bellows, his eyes glassy and unnaturally distended, his mouth covered\nwith blood. . . . Near him glistened a kitchen knife. Then he saw a man\nwith a revolver in one hand, and holding shut with the other a broken\ndoor that someone was trying to open from within. Don Marcelo\nrecognized him, in spite of his greenish pallor and wild look. It was\nBlumhardt--another Blumhardt with a bestial expression of terrifying\nferocity and lust.\n\nDon Marcelo could see clearly how it had all happened--the debauchee\nrushing through the castle in search of his prey, the anxious father in\nclose pursuit, the cries of the girl, the unequal struggle between the\nconsumptive with his emergency weapon and the warrior triumphant. The\nfury of his youth awoke in the old Frenchman, sweeping everything before\nit. What did it matter if he did die? . . .\n\n\"Ah, you villain!\" he yelled, as the poor father had done.\n\nAnd with clenched fists he marched up to the German, who smiled coldly\nand held his revolver to his eyes. He was just going to shoot him . . .\nbut at that instant Desnoyers fell to the floor, knocked down by those\nwho were leaping up the stairs. He received many blows, the heavy boots\nof the invaders hammering him with their heels. He felt a hot stream\npouring over his face. Blood! . . . He did not know whether it was his\nown or that of the palpitating mortal slowly dying beside him. Then\nhe found himself lifted from the floor by many hands which pushed him\ntoward a man. It was His Excellency, with his uniform burst open and\nsmelling of wine. Eyes and voice were both trembling.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" he stuttered, trying to recover this suave irony, \"I\nwarned you not to interfere in our affairs and you have not obeyed me.\nYou may now take the consequences of your lack of discretion.\"\n\nHe gave an order, and the old man felt himself pushed downstairs to the\ncellars underneath the castle. Those conducting him were soldiers under\nthe command of a petty officer whom he recognized as the Socialist. This\nyoung professor was the only one sober, but he maintained himself erect\nand unapproachable with the ferocity of discipline.\n\nHe put his prisoner into an arched vault without any breathing-place\nexcept a tiny window on a level with the floor. Many broken bottles and\nchests with some straw were all that was in the cave.\n\n\"You have insulted a head officer!\" said the official roughly, \"and\nthey will probably shoot you to-morrow. Your only salvation lies in the\ncontinuance of the revels, in which case they may forget you.\"\n\nAs the door of this sub-cellar was broken, like all the others in the\nbuilding, a pile of boxes and furniture was heaped in the entrance way.\n\nDon Marcelo passed the rest of the night tormented with the cold--the\nonly thing which worried him just then. He had abandoned all hope of\nlife; even the images of his family seemed blotted from his memory.\nHe worked in the dark in order to make himself more comfortable on the\nchests, burrowing down into the straw for the sake of its heat. When the\nmorning breeze began to sift in through the little window he fell slowly\ninto a heavy, overpowering sleep, like that of criminals condemned to\ndeath, or duellists before the fatal morning. He thought he heard\nshouts in German, the galloping of horses, a distant sound of tattoo and\nwhistle such as the battalions of the invaders made with their fifes and\ndrums. . . . Then he lost all consciousness of his surroundings.\n\nOn opening his eyes again a ray of sunlight, slipping through the\nwindow, was tracing a little golden square on the wall, giving a regal\nsplendor to the hanging cobwebs. Somebody was removing the barricade\nbefore the door. A woman's voice, timid and distressed, was calling\nrepeatedly:\n\n\"Master, are you here?\"\n\nHe sprang up quickly, wishing to aid the worker outside, and pushing\nvigorously. He thought that the invaders must have left. In no other way\ncould he imagine the Warden's wife daring to try to get him out of his\ncell.\n\n\"Yes, they have gone,\" she said. \"Nobody is left in the castle.\"\n\nAs soon as he was able to get out Don Marcelo looked inquiringly at the\nwoman with her bloodshot eyes, dishevelled hair and sorrow-drawn face.\nThe night had weighed her down pitilessly with the pressure of many\nyears. All the energy with which she had been working to free Desnoyers\ndisappeared on seeing him again. \"Oh, Master . . . Master,\" she moaned\nconvulsively; and she flung herself into his arms, bursting into tears.\n\nDon Marcelo did not need to ask anything further; he dreaded to know the\ntruth. Nevertheless, he asked after her husband. Now that he was awake\nand free, he cherished the fleeting hope that what he had gone through\nthe night before was but another of his nightmares. Perhaps the poor man\nwas still living. . . .\n\n\"They killed him, Monsieur. That man who seemed so good murdered him.\n. . . And I don't know where his body is; nobody will tell me.\"\n\nShe had a suspicion that the corpse was in the fosse. The green and\ntranquil waters had closed mysteriously over this victim of the night.\n. . . Desnoyers suspected that another sorrow was troubling the mother\nstill more, but he kept modestly silent. It was she who finally spoke,\nbetween outbursts of grief. . . . Georgette was now in the lodge.\nHorror-stricken and shuddering, she had fled there when the invaders had\nleft the castle. They had kept her in their power until the last minute.\n\n\"Oh, Master, don't look at her. . . . She is trembling and sobbing at\nthe thought that you may speak with her about what she has gone through.\nShe is almost out of her mind. She longs to die! Ay, my little girl!\n. . . And is there no one who will punish these monsters?\"\n\nThey had come up from the cellars and crossed the bridge, the woman\nlooking fixedly into the silent waters. The dead body of a swan was\nfloating upon them. Before their departure, while their horses were\nbeing saddled, two officers had amused themselves by chasing with\nrevolver shots the birds swimming in the moat. The aquatic plants were\nspotted with blood; among the leaves were floating some tufts of\nlimp white plumage like a bit of washing escaped from the hands of a\nlaundress.\n\nDon Marcelo and the woman exchanged a compassionate glance, and then\nlooked pityingly at each other as the sunlight brought out more strongly\ntheir aging, wan appearance.\n\nThe passing of these people had destroyed everything. There was no food\nleft in the castle except some crusts of dry bread forgotten in the\nkitchen. \"And we have to live, Monsieur!\" exclaimed the woman with\nreviving energy as she thought of her daughter's need. \"We have to\nlive, if only to see how God punishes them!\" The old man shrugged his\nshoulders in despair; God? . . . But the woman was right; they had to\nlive.\n\nWith the famished audacity of his early youth, when he was travelling\nover boundless tracts of land, driving his herds of cattle, he now\nrushed outside the park, hunting for some form of sustenance. He saw\nthe valley, fair and green, basking in the sun; the groups of trees, the\nplots of yellowish soil with the hard spikes of stubble; the hedges in\nwhich the birds were singing--all the summer splendor of a countryside\ndeveloped and cultivated during fifteen centuries by dozens and dozens\nof generations. And yet--here he was alone at the mercy of chance,\nlikely to perish with hunger--more alone than when he was crossing the\ntowering heights of the Andes--those irregular slopes of rocks and\nsnow wrapped in endless silence, only broken from time to time by\nthe flapping of the condor's wings. Nobody. . . . His gaze could not\ndistinguish a single movable point--everything fixed, motionless,\ncrystallized, as though contracted with fear before the peals of thunder\nwhich were still rumbling around the horizon.\n\nHe went on toward the village--a mass of black walls with a few houses\nstill intact, and a roofless bell tower with its cross twisted by fire.\nNobody in the streets sown with bottles, charred chunks of wood, and\nsoot-covered rubbish. The dead bodies had disappeared, but a nauseating\nsmell of decomposing and burned flesh assailed his nostrils. He saw\na mound of earth where the shooting had taken place, and from it were\nprotruding two feet and a hand. At his approach several black forms flew\nup into the air from a trench so shallow that the bodies within were\nexposed to view. A whirring of stiff wings beat the air above him,\nflying off with the croakings of wrath. He explored every nook and\ncorner, even approaching the place where the troopers had erected their\nbarricade. The carts were still by the roadside.\n\nHe then retraced his steps, calling out before the least injured\nhouses, and putting his head through the doors and windows that were\nunobstructed or but half consumed. Was nobody left in Villeblanche? He\ndescried among the ruins something advancing on all fours, a species of\nreptile that stopped its crawling with movements of hesitation and fear,\nready to retreat or slip into its hole under the ruins. Suddenly the\ncreature stopped and stood up. It was a man, an old man. Other human\nlarvae were coming forth conjured by his shouts--poor beings who hours\nago had given up the standing position which would have attracted\nthe bullets of the enemy, and had been enviously imitating the lower\norganisms, squirming through the dirt as fast as they could scurry into\nthe bosom of the earth. They were mostly women and children, all filthy\nand black, with snarled hair, the fierceness of animal appetite in their\neyes--the faintness of the weak animal in their hanging jaws. They\nwere all living hidden in the ruins of their homes. Fear had made them\ntemporarily forget their hunger, but finding that the enemy had gone,\nthey were suddenly assailed by all necessitous demands, intensified by\nhours of anguish.\n\nDesnoyers felt as though he were surrounded by a tribe of brutalized\nand famished Indians like those he had often seen in his adventurous\nvoyages. He had brought with him from Paris a quantity of gold pieces,\nand he pulled out a coin which glittered in the sun. Bread was needed,\neverything eatable was needed; he would pay without haggling.\n\nThe flash of gold aroused looks of enthusiasm and greediness, but this\nimpression was short-lived, all eyes contemplating the yellow discs\nwith indifference. Don Marcelo was himself convinced that the miraculous\ncharm had lost its power. They all chanted a chorus of sorrow and\nhorrors with slow and plaintive voice, as though they stood weeping\nbefore a bier: \"Monsieur, they have killed my husband.\" . . . \"Monsieur,\nmy sons! Two of them are missing.\" . . . \"Monsieur, they have taken all\nthe men prisoners: they say it is to work the land in Germany.\" . . .\n\"Monsieur, bread! . . . My little ones are dying of hunger!\"\n\nOne woman was lamenting something worse than death. \"My girl! . . . My\npoor girl!\" Her look of hatred and wild desperation revealed the secret\ntragedy; her outcries and tears recalled that other mother who was\nsobbing in the same way up at the castle. In the depths of some cave,\nwas lying the victim, half-dead with fatigue, shaken with a wild\ndelirium in which she still saw the succession of brutal faces, inflamed\nwith simian passion.\n\nThe miserable group, forming themselves into a circle around him,\nstretched out their hands beseechingly toward the man whom they knew to\nbe so very rich. The women showed him the death-pallor on the faces\nof their scarcely breathing babies, their eyes glazed with starvation.\n\"Bread! . . . bread!\" they implored, as though he could work a miracle.\nHe gave to one mother the gold piece that he had in his hand and\ndistributed more to the others. They took them without looking at them,\nand continued their lament, \"Bread! . . . Bread!\" And he had gone to the\nvillage to make the same supplication! . . . He fled, recognizing the\nuselessness of his efforts.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE BANNER OF THE RED CROSS\n\n\nReturning in desperation to his estate, Don Marcelo Desnoyers saw\nhuge automobiles and men on horseback, forming a very long convoy and\ncompletely filling the road. They were all going in his direction. At\nthe entrance to the park a band of Germans was putting up the wires for\na telephone line. They had just been reconnoitering the rooms befouled\nwith the night's saturnalia, and were ha-haing boisterously over Captain\nvon Hartrott's inscription, \"Bitte, nicht plundern.\" To them it seemed\nthe acme of wit--truly Teutonic.\n\nThe convoy now invaded the park with its automobiles and trucks bearing\na red cross. A war hospital was going to be established in the castle.\nThe doctors were dressed in grayish green and armed the same as the\nofficers; they also imitated their freezing hauteur and repellent\nunapproachableness. There came out of the drays hundreds of folding\ncots, which were placed in rows in the different rooms. The furniture\nthat still remained was thrown out in a heap under the trees. Squads\nof soldiers were obeying with mechanical promptitude the brief and\nimperious orders. An odor of an apothecary shop, of concentrated\ndrugs, now pervaded the quarters, mixed with the strong smell of the\nantiseptics with which they were sprinkling the walls in order to\ndisinfect the filthy remains of the nocturnal orgy.\n\nThen he saw women clad in white, buxom girls with blue eyes and flaxen\nhair. They were grave, bland, austere and implacable in appearance.\nSeveral times they pushed Desnoyers out of their way as if they did not\nsee him. They looked like nuns, but with revolvers under their habits.\n\nAt midday other automobiles began to arrive, attracted by the enormous\nwhite flag with the red cross, which was now waving from the castle\ntower. They came from the division battling beyond the Marne. Their\nmetal fittings were dented by projectiles, their wind-shields broken by\nstar-shaped holes. From their interiors appeared men and more men; some\non foot, others on canvas stretchers--faces pale and rubicund, profiles\naquiline and snubby, red heads and skulls wrapped in white turbans stiff\nwith blood; mouths that laughed with bravado and mouths that groaned\nwith bluish lips; jaws supported with mummy-like bandages; giants in\nagony whose wounds were not apparent; shapeless forms ending in a head\nthat talked and smoked; legs with hanging flesh that was dyeing the\nFirst Aid wrappings with their red moisture; arms that hung as inert\nas dead boughs; torn uniforms in which were conspicuous the tragic\nvacancies of absent members.\n\nThis avalanche of suffering was quickly distributed throughout the\ncastle. In a few hours it was so completely filled that there was not a\nvacant bed--the last arrivals being laid in the shadow of the trees. The\ntelephones were ringing incessantly; the surgeons in coarse aprons\nwere going from one side to the other, working rapidly; human life was\nsubmitted to savage proceedings with roughness and celerity. Those who\ndied under it simply left one more cot free for the others that kept\non coming. Desnoyers saw bloody baskets filled with shapeless masses of\nflesh, strips of skin, broken bones, entire limbs. The orderlies were\ncarrying these terrible remnants to the foot of the park in order to\nbury them in a little plot which had been Chichi's favorite reading\nnook.\n\nPairs of soldiers were carrying out objects wrapped in sheets which\nthe owner recognized as his. These were the dead, and the park was soon\nconverted into a cemetery. No longer was the little retreat large enough\nto hold the corpses and the severed remains from the operations. New\ngrave trenches were being opened near by. The Germans armed with shovels\nwere pressing into service a dozen of the farmer-prisoners to aid in\nunloading the dead. Now they were bringing them down by the cartload,\ndumping them in like the rubbish from some demolished building. Don\nMarcelo felt an abnormal delight in contemplating this increasing\nnumber of vanquished enemies, yet he grieved at the same time that this\nprecipitation of intruders should be deposited forever on his property.\n\nAt nightfall, overwhelmed by so many emotions, he again suffered the\ntorments of hunger. All day long he had eaten nothing but the crust of\nbread found in the kitchen by the Warden's wife. The rest he had left\nfor her and her daughter. A distress as harrowing to him as his hunger\nwas the sight of poor Georgette's shocked despondency. She was always\ntrying to escape from his presence in an agony of shame.\n\n\"Don't let the Master see me!\" she would cry, hiding her face. Since\nhis presence seemed to recall more vividly the memory of her assaults,\nDesnoyers tried, while in the lodge, to avoid going near her.\n\nDesperate with the gnawings of his empty stomach, he accosted several\ndoctors who were speaking French, but all in vain. They would not listen\nto him, and when he repeated his petitions they pushed him roughly out\nof their way. . . . He was not going to perish with hunger in the midst\nof his riches! Those people were eating; the indifferent nurses had\nestablished themselves in his kitchen. . . . But the time passed\non without encountering anybody who would take pity on this old man\ndragging himself weakly from one place to another, in the misery of an\nold age intensified by despair, and suffering in every part of the body,\nthe results of the blows of the night before. He now knew the gnawings\nof a hunger far worse than that which he had suffered when journeying\nover the desert plains--a hunger among men, in a civilized country,\nwearing a belt filled with gold, surrounded with towers and castle halls\nwhich were his, but in the control of others who would not condescend\nto listen to him. And for this piteous ending of his life he had amassed\nmillions and returned to Europe! . . . Ah, the irony of fate! . . .\n\nHe saw a doctor's assistant leaning up against a tree, about to devour\na slab of bread and sausage. His envious eyes scrutinized this fellow,\ntall, thick-set, his jaws bristling with a great red beard. The\ntrembling old man staggered up to him, begging for the food by signs and\nholding out a piece of money. The German's eyes glistened at the sight\nof the gold, and a beatific smile stretched his mouth from ear to ear.\n\n\"Ya,\" he responded, and grabbing the money, he handed over the food.\n\nDon Marcelo commenced to swallow it with avidity. Never had he so\nappreciated the sheer ecstasy of eating as at that instant--in the midst\nof his gardens converted into a cemetery, before his despoiled castle\nwhere hundreds of human beings were groaning in agony. A grayish arm\npassed before his eyes; it belonged to the German, who had returned\nwith two slices of bread and a bit of meat snatched from the kitchen. He\nrepeated his smirking \"Ya?\" . . . and after his victim had secured it\nby means of another gold coin, he was able to take it to the two women\nhidden in the cottage.\n\nDuring the night--a night of painful watching, cut with visions of\nhorror, it seemed to him that the roar of the artillery was coming\nnearer. It was a scarcely perceptible difference, perhaps the effect of\nthe silence of the night which always intensifies sound. The ambulances\ncontinued coming from the front, discharging their cargoes of riddled\nhumanity and going back for more. Desnoyers surmised that his castle was\nbut one of the many hospitals established in a line of more than eighty\nmiles, and that on the other side, behind the French, were many similar\nones in which the same activity was going on--the consignments of\ndying men succeeding each other with terrifying frequency. Many of the\ncombatants were not even having the satisfaction of being taken from\nthe battle field, but were lying groaning on the ground, burying their\nbleeding members in the dust or mud, and weltering in the ooze from\ntheir wounds. . . . And Don Marcelo, who a few hours before had been\nconsidering himself the unhappiest of mortals, now experienced a cruel\njoy in reflecting that so many thousands of vigorous men at the point of\ndeath could well envy him for his hale old age, and for the tranquillity\nwith which he was reposing on that humble bed.\n\nThe next morning the orderly was waiting for him in the same place,\nholding out a napkin filled with eatables. Good red-bearded man, helpful\nand kind! . . . and he offered him the piece of gold.\n\n\"Nein,\" replied the fellow, with a broad, malicious grin. Two gleaming\ngold pieces appeared between Don Marcelo's fingers. Another leering\n\"Nein\" and a shake of the head. Ah, the robber! How he was taking\nadvantage of his necessity! . . . And not until he had produced five\ngold coins was he able to secure the package.\n\nHe soon began to notice all around him a silent and sly conspiracy\nto get possession of his money. A giant in a sergeant's uniform put a\nshovel in his hand pushing him roughly forward. He soon found himself\nin a corner of the park that had been transformed into a graveyard, near\nthe cart of cadavers; there he had to shovel dirt on his own ground in\ncompany with the indignant prisoners.\n\nHe averted his eyes so as not to look at the rigid and grotesque bodies\npiled above him at the edge of the pit, ready to be tumbled in. The\nground was sending forth an insufferable odor, for decomposition had\nalready set in in the nearby trenches. The persistence with which his\noverseers accosted him, and the crafty smile of the sergeant made him\nsee through the deep-laid scheme. The red-beard must be at the bottom\nof all this. Putting his hand in his pocket he dropped the shovel with\na look of interrogation. \"Ya,\" replied the sergeant. After handing\nover the required sum, the tormented old man was permitted to stop\ngrave-digging and wander around at his pleasure; he knew, however, what\nwas probably in store for him--those men were going to submit him to a\nmerciless exploitation.\n\nAnother day passed by, like its predecessor. In the morning of the\nfollowing day his perceptions, sharpened by apprehension, made him\nconjecture that something extraordinary had occurred. The automobiles\nwere arriving and departing with greater rapidity, and there was greater\ndisorder and confusion among the executive force. The telephone was\nringing with mad precipitation; and the wounded arrivals seemed more\ndepressed. The day before they had been singing when taken from the\nvehicles, hiding their woe with laughter and bravado, all talking of the\nnear victory and regretting that they would not be able to witness the\ntriumphal entry into Paris. Now they were all very silent, with furrowed\nbrows, thinking no longer about what was going on behind them, wondering\nonly about their own fate.\n\nOutside the park was the buzz of the approaching throng which was\nblackening the roads. The invasion was beginning again, but with a\nrefluent movement. For hours at a time great strings of gray trucks went\npuffing by; then regiments of infantry, squadrons, rolling stock. They\nwere marching very slowly with a deliberation that puzzled Desnoyers,\nwho could not make out whether this recessional meant flight or change\nof position. The only thing that gave him any satisfaction was the\nstupefied and downcast appearance of the soldiers, the gloomy sulks of\nthe officers. Nobody was shouting; they all appeared to have forgotten\ntheir \"Nach Paris!\" The greenish gray monster still had its armed head\nstretched across the other side of the Marne, but its tail was beginning\nto uncoil with uneasy wrigglings.\n\nAfter night had settled down the troops were still continuing to\nfall back. The cannonading was certainly coming nearer. Some of the\nthunderous claps sounded so close that they made the glass tremble in\nthe windows. A fugitive farmer, trying to find refuge in the park,\ngave Don Marcelo some news. The Germans were in full retreat. They had\ninstalled some of their batteries on the banks of the Marne in order\nto attempt a new resistance. . . . And the new arrival remained without\nattracting the attention of the invaders who, a few days before, would\nhave shot him on the slightest suspicion.\n\nThe mechanical workings of discipline were evidently out of gear.\nDoctors and nurses were running from place to place, shouting orders and\nbreaking out into a volley of curses every time a fresh ambulance load\narrived. The drivers were commanded to take their patients on ahead\nto another hospital near the rear-guard. Orders had been received to\nevacuate the castle that very night.\n\nIn spite of this prohibition, one of the ambulances unloaded its relay\nof wounded men. So deplorable was their state that the doctors accepted\nthem, judging it useless for them to continue their journey. They\nremained in the garden, lying on the same stretchers that they had\noccupied within the vehicle. By the light of the lanterns Desnoyers\nrecognized one of the dying. It was the secretary to His Excellency, the\nSocialist professor who had shut him in the cellar vaults.\n\nAt the sight of the owner of the castle he smiled as though he had met a\ncomrade. His was the only familiar face among all those people who were\nspeaking his language. He was ghastly in hue, with sunken features and\nan impalpable glaze spreading over his eyes. He had no visible wounds,\nbut from under the cloak spread over his abdomen his torn intestines\nexhaled a fatal warning. The presence of Don Marcelo made him guess\nwhere they had brought him, and little by little he co-ordinated his\nrecollections. As though the old gentleman might be interested in the\nwhereabouts of his comrades, he told him all he knew in a weak and\nstrained voice. . . . Bad luck for their brigade! They had reached the\nfront at a critical moment for the reserve troops. Commandant Blumhardt\nhad died at the very first, a shell of '75 taking off his head. Dead,\ntoo, were all the officers who had lodged in the castle. His Excellency\nhad had his jaw bone torn off by a fragment of shell. He had seen him\non the ground, howling with pain, drawing a portrait from his breast and\ntrying to kiss it with his broken mouth. He had himself been hit in\nthe stomach by the same shell. He had lain forty-two hours on the field\nbefore he was picked up by the ambulance corps. . . .\n\nAnd with the mania of the University man, whose hobby is to see\neverything reasoned out and logically explained, he added in that\nsupreme moment, with the tenacity of those who die talking:\n\n\"Sad war, sir. . . . Many premises are lacking in order to decide who is\nthe culpable party. . . . When the war is ended they will have to . . .\nwill have to . . .\" And he closed his eyes overcome by the effort.\nDesnoyers left the dead man, thinking to himself. Poor fellow! He was\nplacing the hour of justice at the termination of the war, and meanwhile\nhundreds like him were dying, disappearing with all their scruples of\nponderous and disciplined reasoning.\n\nThat night there was no sleep on the place. The walls of the lodge\nwere creaking, the glass crashing and breaking, the two women in the\nadjoining room crying out nervously. The noise of the German fire was\nbeginning to mingle with that of other explosives close at hand. He\nsurmised that this was the smashing of the French projectiles which were\ncoming in search of the enemy's artillery above the Marne.\n\nFor a few minutes his hopes revived as the possibility of victory\nflashed into his mind, but he was so depressed by his forlorn situation\nthat such a hope evaporated as quickly as it had come. His own troops\nwere advancing, but this advance did not, perhaps, represent more than\na local gain. The line of battle was so extensive! . . . It was going to\nbe as in 1870; the French would achieve partial victories, modified at\nthe last moment by the strategy of the enemies until they were turned\ninto complete defeat.\n\nAfter midnight the cannonading ceased, but silence was by no means\nre-established. Automobiles were rolling around the lodge midst hoarse\nshouts of command. It must be the hospital convoy that was evacuating\nthe castle. Then near daybreak the thudding of horses' hoofs and the\nwheels of chugging machines thundered through the gates, making the\nground tremble. Half an hour afterwards sounded the tramp of multitudes\nmoving at a quick pace, dying away in the depths of the park.\n\nAt dawn the old gentleman leaped from his bed, and the first thing\nhe spied from the cottage window was the flag of the Red Cross still\nfloating from the top of the castle. There were no more cots under the\ntrees. On the bridge he met one of the doctors and several assistants.\nThe hospital force had gone with all its transportable patients. There\nonly remained in the castle, under the care of a company, those most\ngravely wounded. The Valkyries of the health department had also\ndisappeared.\n\nThe red-bearded Shylock was among those left behind, and on seeing Don\nMarcelo afar off, he smiled and immediately vanished. A few minutes\nafter he returned with full hands. Never before had he been so generous.\nForeseeing pressing necessity, the hungry man put his hands in his\npockets as usual, but was astonished to learn from the orderly's\nemphatic gestures that he did not wish any money.\n\n\"Nein. . . . Nein!\"\n\nWhat generosity was this! . . . The German persisted in his negatives.\nHis enormous mouth expanded in an ingratiating grin as he laid his heavy\npaws on Marcelo's shoulders. He appeared like a good dog, a meek dog,\nfawning and licking the hands of the passer-by, coaxing to be taken\nalong with him. \"Franzosen. . . . Franzosen.\" He did not know how to\nsay any more, but the Frenchman read in his words the desire to make him\nunderstand that he had always been in great sympathy with the French.\nSomething very important was evidently transpiring--the ill-humored air\nof those left behind in the castle, and the sudden servility of this\nplowman in uniform, made it very apparent. . . .\n\nSome distance beyond the castle he saw soldiers, many soldiers. A\nbattalion of infantry had spread itself along the walls with trucks,\ndraught horses and swift mounts. With their pikes the soldiers were\nmaking small openings in the mud walls, shaping them into a border of\nlittle pinnacles. Others were kneeling or sitting near the apertures,\ntaking off their knapsacks in order that they might be less hampered.\nAfar off the cannon were booming, and in the intervals between their\ndetonations could be heard the bursting of shrapnel, the bubbling of\nfrying oil, the grinding of a coffee-mill, and the incessant crackling\nof rifle-fire. Fleecy clouds were floating over the fields, giving to\nnear objects the indefinite lines of unreality. The sun was a faint spot\nseen between curtains of mist. The trees were weeping fog moisture from\nall the cracks in their bark.\n\nA thunderclap rent the air so forcibly that it seemed very near the\ncastle. Desnoyers trembled, believing that he had received a blow in\nthe chest. The other men remained impassive with their customary\nindifference. A cannon had just been discharged but a few feet away\nfrom him, and not till then did he realize that two batteries had been\ninstalled in the park. The pieces of artillery were hidden under mounds\nof branches, the gunners having felled trees in order to mask their\nmonsters more perfectly. He saw them arranging the last; with shovels,\nthey were forming a border of earth, a foot in width, around each\npiece. This border guarded the feet of the operators whose bodies were\nprotected by steel shields on both sides of them. Then they raised\na breastwork of trunks and boughs, leaving only the mouth of the\ncylindrical mortar visible.\n\nBy degrees Don Marcelo became accustomed to the firing which seemed\nto be creating a vacuum within his cranium. He ground his teeth and\nclenched his fists at every detonation, but stood stock-still with no\ndesire to leave, dominated by the violence of the explosions, admiring\nthe serenity of these men who were giving orders, erect and coolly, or\nmoving like humble menials around their roaring metal beasts.\n\nAll his ideas seemed to have been snatched away by that first discharge\nof cannon. His brain was living in the present moment only. He turned\nhis eyes insistently toward the white and red banner which was waving\nfrom the mansion.\n\n\"That is treachery,\" he thought, \"a breach of faith.\"\n\nFar away, on the other side of the Marne, the French artillery were\nbelching forth their deadly fire. He could imagine their handiwork\nfrom the little yellowish clouds that were floating in the air, and\nthe columns of smoke which were spouting forth at various points of\nthe landscape where the German troops were hidden, forming a line which\nappeared to lose itself in infinity. An atmosphere of protection and\nrespect seemed to be enveloping the castle.\n\nThe morning mists had dissolved; the sun was finally showing its bright\nand limpid light, lengthening the shadows of men and trees to fantastic\ndimensions. Hills and woods came forth from the haze, fresh and dripping\nafter their morning bath. The entire valley was now completely exposed,\nand Desnoyers was surprised to see the river from the spot to which he\nhad been rooted--the cannon having opened great windows in the woods\nthat had hid it from view. What most astonished him in looking over this\nlandscape, smiling and lovely in the morning light, was that nobody was\nto be seen--absolutely nobody. Mountain tops and forests were bellowing\nwithout anyone's being in evidence. There must be more than a hundred\nthousand men in the space swept by his piercing gaze, and yet not a\nhuman being was visible. The deadly boom of arms was causing the air to\nvibrate without leaving any optical trace. There was no other smoke but\nthat of the explosions, the black spirals that were flinging their\ngreat shells to burst on the ground. These were rising on all sides,\nencircling the castle like a ring of giant tops, but not one of that\norderly circle ventured to touch the edifice. Don Marcelo again stared\nat the Red Cross flag. \"It is treachery!\" he kept repeating; yet at the\nsame time he was selfishly rejoicing in the base expedient, since it\nserved to defend his property.\n\nThe battalion was at last completely installed the entire length of the\nwall, opposite the river. The soldiers, kneeling, were supporting their\nguns on the newly made turrets and grooves, and seemed satisfied with\nthis rest after a night of battling retreat. They all appeared sleeping\nwith their eyes open. Little by little they were letting themselves drop\nback on their heels, or seeking the support of their knapsacks. Snores\nwere heard in the brief spaces between the artillery fire. The officials\nstanding behind them were examining the country with their field\nglasses, or talking in knots. Some appeared disheartened, others furious\nat the backward flight that had been going on since the day before.\nThe majority appeared calm, with the passivity of obedience. The battle\nfront was immense; who could foresee the outcome? . . . There they were\nin full retreat, but in other places, perhaps, their comrades might be\nadvancing with decided gains. Until the very last moment, no soldier\nknows certainly the fate of the struggle. What was most grieving this\ndetachment was the fact that it was all the time getting further away\nfrom Paris.\n\nDon Marcelo's eye was caught by a sparkling circle of glass, a monocle\nfixed upon him with aggressive insistence. A lank lieutenant with the\ncorseted waist of the officers that he had seen in Berlin, a genuine\nJunker, was a few feet away, sword in hand behind his men, like a\nwrathful and glowering shepherd.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" he said gruffly.\n\nDesnoyers explained that he was the owner of the castle. \"French?\"\ncontinued the lieutenant. \"Yes, French.\" . . . The official scowled in\nhostile meditation, feeling the necessity of saying something against\nthe enemy. The shouts and antics of his companions-at-arms put a summary\nend to his reflections. They were all staring upward, and the old man\nfollowed their gaze.\n\nFor an hour past, there had been streaking through the air frightful\nroarings enveloped in yellowish vapors, strips of cloud which seemed\nto contain wheels revolving with frenzied rotation. They were the\nprojectiles of the heavy German artillery which, fired from various\ndistances, threw their great shells over the castle. Certainly that\ncould not be what was interesting the officials!\n\nHe half shut his eyes in order to see better, and finally near the\nedge of a cloud, he distinguished a species of mosquito flashing in\nthe sunlight. Between brief intervals of silence, could be heard the\ndistant, faint buzz announcing its presence. The officers nodded their\nheads. \"Franzosen!\" Desnoyers thought so, too. He could not believe that\nthe enemy's two black crosses were between those wings. Instead he saw\nwith his mind's eye, two tricolored rings like the circular spots which\ncolor the fluttering wings of butterflies.\n\nThis explained the agitation of the Germans. The French air-bird\nremained motionless for a few seconds over the castle, regardless of\nthe white bubbles exploding underneath and around it. In vain the cannon\nnearest hurled their deadly fire. It wheeled rapidly, and returned to\nthe place from which it came.\n\n\"It must have taken in the whole situation,\" thought the old Frenchman.\n\"It has found them out; it knows what is going on here.\"\n\nHe guessed rightly that this information would swiftly change the course\nof events. Everything which had been happening in the early morning\nhours was going to sink into insignificance compared with what was\ncoming now. He shuddered with fear, the irresistible fear of the\nunknown, and yet at the same time, he was filled with curiosity,\nimpatience and nervous dread before a danger that threatened and would\nnot stay its relentless course.\n\nOutside the park, but a short distance from the mud wall, sounded a\nstrident explosion like a stupendous blow from a gigantic axe--an axe as\nbig as his castle. There began flying through the air entire treetops,\ntrunks split in two, great chunks of earth with the vegetation still\nclinging, a rain of dirt that obscured the heavens. Some stones fell\ndown from the wall. The Germans crouched but with no visible emotion.\nThey knew what it meant; they had been expecting it as something\ninevitable after seeing the French aeroplane. The Red Cross flag could\nno longer deceive the enemy's artillery.\n\nDon Marcelo had not time to recover from his surprise before there came\na second explosion nearer the mud wall . . . a third inside the park.\nIt seemed to him that he had been suddenly flung into another world from\nwhich he was seeing men and things across a fantastic atmosphere which\nroared and rocked and destroyed with the violence of its reverberations.\nHe was stunned with the awfulness of it all, and yet he was not afraid.\nUntil then, he had imagined fear in a very different form. He felt an\nagonizing vacuum in his stomach. He staggered violently all the time, as\nthough some force were pushing him about, giving him first a blow on the\nchest, and then another on the back to straighten him up.\n\nA strong smell of acids penetrated the atmosphere, making respiration\nvery difficult, and filling his eyes with smarting tears. On the other\nhand, the uproar no longer disturbed him, it did not exist for him. He\nsupposed it was still going on from the trembling air, the shaking of\nthings around him, in the whirlwind which was bending men double but was\nnot reacting within his body. He had lost the faculty of hearing; all\nthe strength of his senses had concentrated themselves in looking. His\neyes appeared to have acquired multiple facets like those of certain\ninsects. He saw what was happening before, beside, behind him,\nsimultaneously witnessing extraordinary things as though all the laws of\nlife had been capriciously overthrown.\n\nAn official a few feet away suddenly took an inexplicable flight. He\nbegan to rise without losing his military rigidity, still helmeted, with\nfurrowed brow, moustache blond and short, mustard-colored chest,\nand gloved hands still holding field-glasses and map--but there his\nindividuality stopped. The lower extremities, in their grayish leggings\nremained on the ground, inanimate as reddening, empty moulds. The\ntrunk, in its violent ascent, spread its contents abroad like a bursting\nrocket. Further on, some gunners, standing upright, were suddenly\nstretched full length, converted into a motionless row, bathed in blood.\n\nThe line of infantry was lying close to the ground. The men had huddled\nthemselves together near the loopholes through which they aimed their\nguns, trying to make themselves less visible. Many had placed their\nknapsacks over their heads or at their backs to defend themselves from\nthe flying bits of shell. If they moved at all, it was only to worm\ntheir way further into the earth, trying to hollow it out with their\nstomachs. Many of them had changed position with mysterious rapidity,\nnow lying stretched on their backs as though asleep. One had his uniform\ntorn open across the abdomen, showing between the rents of the cloth,\nslabs of flesh, blue and red that protruded and swelled up with a\nbubbling expansion. Another had his legs shot away, and was looking\naround with surprised eyes and a black mouth rounded into an effort to\nhowl, but from which no sound ever came.\n\nDesnoyers had lost all notion of time. He could not tell whether he had\nbeen rooted to that spot for many hours or for a single moment. The only\nthing that caused him anxiety was the persistent trembling of his legs\nwhich were refusing to sustain him. . . .\n\nSomething fell behind him. It was raining ruin. Turning his head, he\nsaw his castle completely transformed. Half of the tower had just been\ncarried off. The pieces of slate were scattered everywhere in tiny\nchips; the walls were crumbling; loose window frames were balancing on\nedge like fragments of stage scenery, and the old wood of the tower hood\nwas beginning to burn like a torch.\n\nThe spectacle of this instantaneous change in his property impressed him\nmore than the ravages of death, making him realize the Cyclopean power\nof the blind, avenging forces raging around him. The vital force that\nhad been concentrated in his eyes, now spread to his feet . . . and he\nstarted to run without knowing whither, feeling the same necessity to\nhide himself as had those men enchained by discipline who were trying to\nflatten themselves into the earth in imitation of the reptile's pliant\ninvisibility.\n\nHis instinct was pushing him toward the lodge, but half way up the\navenue, he was stopped by another lot of astounding transformations. An\nunseen hand had just snatched away half of the cottage roof. The entire\nside wall doubled over, forming a cascade of bricks and dust. The\ninterior rooms were now exposed to view like a theatrical setting--the\nkitchen where he had eaten, the upper floor with the room in which he\ndescried his still unmade bed. The poor women! . . .\n\nHe turned around, running now toward the castle, trying to make the\nsub-cellar in which he had been fastened for the night; and when he\nfinally found himself under those dusty cobwebs, he felt as though\nhe were in the most luxurious salon, and he devoutly blessed the good\nworkmanship of the castle builders.\n\nThe subterranean silence began gradually to bring back his sense of\nhearing. The cannonading of the Germans and the bursting of the French\nshells sounded from his retreat like a distant tempest. There came into\nhis mind the eulogies which he had been accustomed to lavish upon the\ncannon of '75 without knowing anything about it except by hearsay. Now\nhe had witnessed its effects. \"It shoots TOO well!\" he muttered. In a\nshort time it would finish destroying his castle--he was finding such\nperfection excessive.\n\nBut he soon repented of these selfish lamentations. An idea, tenacious\nas remorse, had fastened itself in his brain. It now seemed to him that\nall he was passing through was an expiation for the great mistake of\nhis youth. He had evaded the service of his country, and now he was\nenveloped in all the horrors of war, with the humiliation of a passive\nand defenseless being, without any of the soldier's satisfaction of\nbeing able to return the blows. He was going to die--he was sure of\nthat--but a shameful death, unknown and inglorious. The ruins of his\nmansion were going to become his sepulchre. . . . And the certainty of\ndying there in the darkness, like a rat that sees the openings of his\nhole being closed up, made this refuge intolerable.\n\nAbove him the tornado was still raging. A peal like thunder boomed above\nhis head, and then came the crash of a landslide. Another projectile\nmust have fallen upon the building. He heard shrieks of agony, yells\nand precipitous steps on the floor above him. Perhaps the shell, in its\nblind fury, had blown to pieces many of the dying in the salons.\n\nFearing to remain buried in his retreat, he bounded up the cellar stairs\ntwo steps at a time. As he scudded across the first floor, he saw the\nsky through the shattered roofs. Along the edges were hanging sections\nof wood, fragments of swinging tile and furniture stopped halfway in\nits flight. Crossing the hall, he had to clamber over much rubbish. He\nstumbled over broken and twisted iron, parts of beds rained from the\nupper rooms into the mountain of debris in which he saw convulsed limbs\nand heard anguished voices that he could not understand.\n\nHe leaped as he ran, feeling the same longing for light and free air as\nthose who rush from the hold to the deck of a shipwreck. While sheltered\nin the darkness more time had elapsed than he had supposed. The sun was\nnow very high. He saw in the garden more corpses in tragic and grotesque\npostures. The wounded were doubled over with pain or lying on the ground\nor propping themselves against the trees in painful silence. Some had\nopened their knapsacks and drawn out their sanitary kits and were trying\nto care for their cuts. The infantry was now firing incessantly. The\nnumber of riflemen had increased. New bands of soldiers were entering\nthe park--some with a sergeant at their head, others followed by an\nofficer carrying a revolver at his breast as though guiding his men\nwith it. This must be the infantry expelled from their position near\nthe river which had come to reinforce the second line of defense. The\nmitrailleuses were adding their tac-tac to the cracks of the fusileers.\n\nThe hum of the invisible swarms was buzzing incessantly. Thousands of\nsticky horse-flies were droning around Desnoyers without his even seeing\nthem. The bark of the trees was being stripped by unseen hands; the\nleaves were falling in torrents; the boughs were shaken by opposing\nforces, the stones on the ground were being crushed by a mysterious\nfoot. All inanimate objects seemed to have acquired a fantastic life.\nThe zinc spoons of the soldiers, the metallic parts of their outfit, the\npails of the artillery were all clanking as though in an imperceptible\nhailstorm. He saw a cannon lying on its side with the wheels broken\nand turned over among many men who appeared asleep; he saw soldiers\nwho stretched themselves out without a contraction, without a sound, as\nthough overcome by sudden drowsiness. Others were howling and dragging\nthemselves forward in a sitting position.\n\nThe old man felt an extreme sensation of heat. The pungent perfume of\nexplosive drugs brought the tears to his eyes and clawed at his throat.\nAt the same time he was chilly and felt his forehead freezing in a\nglacial sweat.\n\nHe had to leave the bridge. Several soldiers were passing bearing the\nwounded to the edifice in spite of the fact that it was falling in\nruins. Suddenly he was sprinkled from head to foot, as if the earth had\nopened to make way for a waterspout. A shell had fallen into the moat,\nthrowing up an enormous column of water, making the carp sleeping in\nthe mud fly into fragments, breaking a part of the edges and grinding to\npowder the white balustrades with their great urns of flowers.\n\nHe started to run on with the blindness of terror, when he suddenly saw\nbefore him the same little round crystal, examining him coolly. It\nwas the Junker, the officer of the monocle. . . . With the end of\nhis revolver, the German pointed to two pails a short distance away,\nordering Desnoyers to fill them from the lagoon and give the water to\nthe men overcome by the sun. Although the imperious tone admitted of no\nreply, Don Marcelo tried, nevertheless, to resist. He received a blow\nfrom the revolver on his chest at the same time that the lieutenant\nslapped him in the face. The old man doubled over, longing to weep,\nlonging to perish; but no tears came, nor did life escape from his body\nunder this affront, as he wished. . . . With the two buckets in his\nhands, he found himself dipping up water from the canal, carrying it the\nlength of the file, giving it to men who, each in his turn, dropped his\ngun to gulp the liquid with the avidity of panting beasts.\n\nHe was no longer afraid of the shrill shrieks of invisible bodies. His\none great longing was to die. He was strongly convinced that he was\ngoing to die; his sufferings were too great; there was no longer any\nplace in the world for him.\n\nHe had to pass by breaches opened in the wall by the bursting shells.\nThere was no natural object to arrest the eye looking through these\ngaps. Hedges and groves had been swept away or blotted out by the\nfire of the artillery. He descried at the foot of the highway near his\ncastle, several of the attacking columns which had crossed the Marne.\nThe advancing forces were coming doggedly on, apparently unmoved by the\nsteady, deadly fire of the Germans. Soon they were rushing forward with\nleaps and bounds, by companies, shielding themselves behind bits of\nupland in bends of the road, in order to send forth their blasts of\ndeath.\n\nThe old man was now fired with a desperate resolution;--since he had to\ndie, let a French ball kill him! And he advanced very erect with his two\npails among those men shooting, lying down. Then, with a sudden fear,\nhe stood still hanging his head; a second thought had told him that the\nbullet which he might receive would be one danger less for the enemy.\nIt would be better for them to kill the Germans . . . and he began to\ncherish the hope that he might get possession of some weapon from those\ndying around him, and fall upon that Junker who had struck him.\n\nHe was filling his pails for the third time, and murderously\ncontemplating the lieutenant's back when something occurred so absurd\nand unnatural that it reminded him of the fantastic flash of the\ncinematograph;--the officer's head suddenly disappeared; two jets of\nblood spurted from his severed neck and his body collapsed like an empty\nsack.\n\nAt the same time, a cyclone was sweeping the length of the wall, tearing\nup groves, overturning cannon and carrying away people in a whirlwind as\nthough they were dry leaves. He inferred that Death was now blowing from\nanother direction. Until then, it had come from the front on the river\nside, battling with the enemy's line ensconced behind the walls. Now,\nwith the swiftness of an atmospheric change, it was blustering from the\ndepths of the park. A skillful manoeuver of the aggressors, the use of a\ndistant road, a chance bend in the German line had enabled the French to\ncollect their cannon in a new position, attacking the occupants of the\ncastle with a flank movement.\n\nIt was a lucky thing for Don Marcelo that he had lingered a few moments\non the bank of the fosse, sheltered by the bulk of the edifice. The fire\nof the hidden battery passed the length of the avenue, carrying off the\nliving, destroying for a second time the dead, killing horses, breaking\nthe wheels of vehicles and making the gun carriages fly through the air\nwith the flames of a volcano in whose red and bluish depths black bodies\nwere leaping. He saw hundreds of fallen men; he saw disembowelled horses\ntrampling on their entrails. The death harvest was not being reaped in\nsheaves; the entire field was being mowed down with a single flash\nof the sickle. And as though the batteries opposite divined the\ncatastrophe, they redoubled their fire, sending down a torrent of\nshells. They fell on all sides. Beyond the castle, at the end of the\npark, craters were opening in the woods, vomiting forth the entire\ntrunks of trees. The projectiles were hurling from their pits the bodies\ninterred the night before.\n\nThose still alive were firing through the gaps in the walls. Then they\nsprang up with the greatest haste. Some grasped their bayonets, pale,\nwith clamped lips and a mad glare in their eyes; others turned their\nbacks, running toward the exit from the park, regardless of the shouts\nof their officers and the revolver shots sent after the fugitives.\n\nAll this occurred with dizzying rapidity, like a nightmare. On the other\nside of the wall came a murmur, swelling in volume, like that of the\nsea. Desnoyers heard shouts, and it seemed to him that some hoarse,\ndiscordant voices were singing the Marseillaise. The machine-guns were\nworking with the swift steadiness of sewing machines. The attack was\ngoing to be opposed with furious resistance. The Germans, crazed\nwith fury, shot and shot. In one of the breaches appeared a red kepis\nfollowed by legs of the same color trying to clamber over the ruins. But\nthis vision was instantly blotted out by the sprinkling from the machine\nguns, making the invaders fall in great heaps on the other side of the\nwall. Don Marcelo never knew exactly how the change took place. Suddenly\nhe saw the red trousers within the park. With irresistible bounds they\nwere springing over the wall, slipping through the yawning gaps, and\ndarting out from the depths of the woods by invisible paths. They were\nlittle soldiers, husky, panting, perspiring, with torn cloaks; and\nmingled with them, in the disorder of the charge, African marksmen with\ndevilish eyes and foaming mouths, Zouaves in wide breeches and chasseurs\nin blue uniforms.\n\nThe German officers wanted to die. With upraised swords, after having\nexhausted the shots in their revolvers, they advanced upon their\nassailants followed by the soldiers who still obeyed them. There was a\nscuffle, a wild melee. To the trembling spectator, it seemed as though\nthe world had fallen into profound silence. The yells of the combatants,\nthe thud of colliding bodies, the clang of arms seemed as nothing after\nthe cannon had quieted down. He saw men pierced through the middle by\ngun points whose reddened ends came out through their kidneys; muskets\nraining hammer-like blows, adversaries that grappled in hand-to-hand\ntussles, rolling over and over on the ground, trying to gain the\nadvantage by kicks and bites.\n\nThe mustard-colored fronts had entirely disappeared, and he now saw only\nbacks of that color fleeing toward the exit, filtering among the trees,\nfalling midway in their flight when hit by the pursuing balls. Many\nof the invaders were unable to chase the fugitives because they were\noccupied in repelling with rude thrusts of their bayonets the bodies\nfalling upon them in agonizing convulsions.\n\nDon Marcelo suddenly found himself in the very thick of these mortal\ncombats, jumping up and down like a child, waving his hands and shouting\nwith all his might. When he came to himself again, he was hugging\nthe grimy head of a young French officer who was looking at him in\nastonishment. He probably thought him crazy on receiving his kisses, on\nhearing his incoherent torrent of words. Emotionally exhausted, the worn\nold man continued to weep after the officer had freed himself with a\njerk. . . . He needed to give vent to his feelings after so many days of\nanguished self-control. Vive la France! . . .\n\nHis beloved French were already within the park gates. They were\nrunning, bayonets in hand, in pursuit of the last remnants of the German\nbattalion trying to escape toward the village. A group of horsemen\npassed along the road. They were dragoons coming to complete the rout.\nBut their horses were fagged out; nothing but the fever of victory\ntransmitted from man to beast had sustained their painful pace. One\nof the equestrians came to a stop near the entrance of the park, the\nfamished horse eagerly devouring the herbage while his rider settled\ndown in the saddle as though asleep. Desnoyers touched him on the hip in\norder to waken him, but he immediately rolled off on the opposite side.\nHe was dead, with his entrails protruding from his body, but swept on\nwith the others, he had been brought thus far on his steady steed.\n\nEnormous tops of iron and smoke now began falling in the neighborhood.\nThe German artillery was opening a retaliatory fire against its\nlost positions. The advance continued. There passed toward the North\nbattalions, squadrons and batteries, worn, weary and grimy, covered with\ndust and mud, but kindled with an ardor that galvanized their flagging\nenergy.\n\nThe French cannon began thundering on the village side. Bands of\nsoldiers were exploring the castle and the nearest woods. From the\nruined rooms, from the depths of the cellars, from the clumps of\nshrubbery in the park, from the stables and burned garage, came surging\nforth men dressed in greenish gray and pointed helmets. They all threw\nup their arms, extending their open hands:--\"Kamarades . . . kamarades,\nnon kaput.\" With the restlessness of remorse, they were in dread of\nimmediate execution. They had suddenly lost all their haughtiness on\nfinding that they no longer had any official powers and were free from\ndiscipline. Some of those who knew a little French, spoke of their wives\nand children, in order to soften the enemies that were threatening them\nwith their bayonets. A brawny Teuton came up to Desnoyers and clapped\nhim on the back. It was Redbeard. He pressed his heart and then pointed\nto the owner of the castle. \"Franzosen . . . great friend of the\nFranzosen\" . . . and he grinned ingratiatingly at his protector.\n\nDon Marcelo remained at the castle until the following morning, and was\nastounded to see Georgette and her mother emerge unexpectedly from the\ndepths of the ruined lodge. They were weeping at the sight of the French\nuniforms.\n\n\"It could not go on,\" sobbed the widow. \"God does not die.\"\n\nAfter a bad night among the ruins, the owner decided to leave\nVilleblanche. What was there for him to do now in the destroyed castle?\n. . . The presence of so many dead was racking his nerves. There were\nhundreds, there were thousands. The soldiers and the farmers were\ninterring great heaps of them wherever he went, digging burial trenches\nclose to the castle, in all the avenues of the park, in the garden\npaths, around the outbuildings. Even the depths of the circular lagoon\nwere filled with corpses. How could he ever live again in that tragic\ncommunity composed mostly of his enemies? . . . Farewell forever, castle\nof Villeblanche!\n\nHe turned his steps toward Paris, planning to get there the best way\nhe could. He came upon corpses everywhere, but they were not all the\ngray-green uniform. Many of his countrymen had fallen in the gallant\noffensive. Many would still fall in the last throes of the battle that\nwas going on behind them, agitating the horizon with its incessant\nuproar. Everywhere red pantaloons were sticking up out of the stubble,\nhobnailed boots glistening in upright position near the roadside,\nlivid heads, amputated bodies, stray limbs--and, scattered through this\nfunereal medley, red kepis and Oriental caps, helmets with tufts of\nhorse hair, twisted swords, broken bayonets, guns and great mounds\nof cannon cartridges. Dead horses were strewing the plain with their\nswollen carcasses. Artillery wagons with their charred wood and bent\niron frames revealed the tragic moment of the explosion. Rectangles of\noverturned earth marked the situation of the enemy's batteries before\ntheir retreat. Amidst the broken cannons and trucks were cones of\ncarbonized material, the remains of men and horses burned by the Germans\non the night before their withdrawal.\n\nIn spite of these barbarian holocausts corpses were every where in\ninfinite numbers. There seemed to be no end to their number; it seemed\nas though the earth had expelled all the bodies that it had received\nsince the beginning of the world. The sun was impassively flooding the\nfields of death with its waves of light. In its yellowish glow, the\npieces of the bayonets, the metal plates, the fittings of the guns were\nsparkling like bits of crystal. The damp night, the rain, the rust of\ntime had not yet modified with their corrosive action these relics of\ncombat.\n\nBut decomposition had begun to set in. Graveyard odors were all along\nthe road, increasing in intensity as Desnoyers plodded on toward Paris.\nEvery half hour, the evidence of corruption became more pronounced--many\nof the dead on this side of the river having lain there for three or\nfour days. Bands of crows, at the sound of his footsteps, rose up,\nlazily flapping their wings, but returning soon to blacken the earth,\nsurfeited but not satisfied, having lost all fear of mankind.\n\nFrom time to time, the sad pedestrian met living bands of men--platoons\nof cavalry, gendarmes, Zouaves and chasseurs encamped around the ruined\nfarmsteads, exploring the country in pursuit of German fugitives. Don\nMarcelo had to explain his business there, showing the passport that\nLacour had given him in order to make his trip on the military train.\nOnly in this way, could he continue his journey. These soldiers--many\nof them slightly wounded--were still stimulated by victory. They were\nlaughing, telling stories, and narrating the great dangers which they\nhad escaped a few days before, always ending with, \"We are going to kick\nthem across the frontier!\" . . .\n\nTheir indignation broke forth afresh as they looked around at the\nblasted towns--farms and single houses, all burned. Like skeletons\nof prehistoric beasts, many steel frames twisted by the flames were\nscattered over the plains. The brick chimneys of the factories were\neither levelled to the ground or, pierced with the round holes made\nby shells, were standing up like giant pastoral flutes forced into the\nearth.\n\nNear the ruined villages, the women were removing the earth and trying\nto dig burial trenches, but their labor was almost useless because it\nrequired an immense force to inter so many dead. \"We are all going to\ndie after gaining the victory,\" mused the old man. \"The plague is going\nto break out among us.\"\n\nThe water of the river must also be contaminated by this contagion;\nso when his thirst became intolerable he drank, in preference, from a\nnearby pond. . . . But, alas, on raising his head, he saw some greenish\nlegs on the surface of the shallow water, the boots sunk in the muddy\nbanks. The head of the German was in the depths of the pool.\n\nHe had been trudging on for several hours when he stopped before a\nruined house which he believed that he recognized. Yes, it was the\ntavern where he had lunched a few days ago on his way to the castle. He\nforced his way in among the blackened walls where a persistent swarm of\nflies came buzzing around him. The smell of decomposing flesh attracted\nhis attention; a leg which looked like a piece of charred cardboard was\nwedged in the ruins. Looking at it bitterly he seemed to hear again the\nold woman with her grandchildren clinging to her skirts--\"Monsieur, why\nare the people fleeing? War only concerns the soldiers. We countryfolk\nhave done no wrong to anybody, and we ought not to be afraid.\"\n\nHalf an hour later, on descending a hilly path, the traveller had the\nmost unexpected of encounters. He saw there a taxicab, an automobile\nfrom Paris. The chauffeur was walking tranquilly around the vehicle as\nif it were at the cab stand, and he promptly entered into conversation\nwith this gentleman who appeared to him as downcast and dirty as a\ntramp, with half of his livid face discolored from a blow. He had\nbrought out here in his machine some Parisians who had wanted to see the\nbattlefield; they were reporters; and he was waiting there to take them\nback at nightfall.\n\nDon Marcelo buried his right hand in his pocket. Two hundred francs\nif the man would drive him to Paris. The chauffeur declined with the\ngravity of a man faithful to his obligations. . . . \"Five hundred?\"\n. . . and he showed his fist bulging with gold coins. The man's only\nresponse was a twirl of the handle which started the machine to\nsnorting, and away they sped. There was not a battle in the neighborhood\nof Paris every day in the year! His other clients could just wait.\n\nAnd settling back into the motor-car, Desnoyers saw the horrors of the\nbattle field flying past at a dizzying speed and disappearing behind\nhim. He was rolling toward human life . . . he was returning to\ncivilization!\n\nAs they came into Paris, the nearly empty streets seemed to him to be\ncrowded with people. Never had he seen the city so beautiful. He whirled\nthrough the avenue de l'Opera, whizzed past the place de la Concorde,\nand thought he must be dreaming as he realized the gigantic leap that he\nhad taken within the hour. He compared all that was now around him with\nthe sights on that plain of death but a few miles away. No; no, it was\nnot possible. One of the extremes of this contrast must certainly be\nfalse!\n\nThe automobile was beginning to slow down; he must be now in the avenue\nVictor Hugo. . . . He couldn't wake up. Was that really his home? . . .\n\nThe majestic concierge, unable to understand his forlorn appearance,\ngreeted him with amazed consternation. \"Ah. Monsieur! . . . Where has\nMonsieur been?\" . . .\n\n\"In hell!\" muttered Don Marcelo.\n\nHis wonderment continued when he found himself actually in his own\napartment, going through its various rooms. He was somebody once more.\nThe sight of the fruits of his riches and the enjoyment of home comforts\nrestored his self-respect at the same time that the contrast recalled to\nhis mind the recollection of all the humiliations and outrages that he\nhad suffered. . . . Ah, the scoundrels! . . .\n\nTwo mornings later, the door bell rang. A visitor!\n\nThere came toward him a soldier--a little soldier of the infantry,\ntimid, with his kepis in his hand, stuttering excuses in Spanish:--\"I\nknew that you were here . . . I come to . . .\"\n\nThat voice? . . . Dragging him from the dark hallway, Don Marcelo\nconducted him to the balcony. . . . How handsome he looked! . . . The\nkepis was red, but darkened with wear; the cloak, too large, was torn\nand darned; the great shoes had a strong smell of leather. Yet never\nhad his son appeared to him so elegant, so distinguished-looking as now,\nfitted out in these rough ready-made clothes.\n\n\"You! . . . You! . . .\"\n\nThe father embraced him convulsively, crying like a child, and trembling\nso that he could no longer stand.\n\nHe had always hoped that they would finally understand each other. His\nblood was coursing through the boy's veins; he was good, with no other\ndefect than a certain obstinacy. He was excusing him now for all the\npast, blaming himself for a great part of it. He had been too hard.\n\n\"You a soldier!\" he kept exclaiming over and over. \"You defending my\ncountry, when it is not yours!\" . . .\n\nAnd he kissed him again, receding a few steps so as to get a better look\nat him. Decidedly he was more fascinating now in his grotesque uniform,\nthan when he was so celebrated for his skill as a dancer and idolized by\nthe women.\n\nWhen the delighted father was finally able to control his emotion, his\neyes, still filled with tears, glowed with a malignant light. A spasm of\nhatred furrowed his face.\n\n\"Go,\" he said simply. \"You do not know what war is; I have just come\nfrom it; I have seen it close by. This is not a war like other wars,\nwith rational enemies; it is a hunt of wild beasts. . . . Shoot without\na scruple against them all. . . . Every one that you overcome, rids\nhumanity of a dangerous menace.\"\n\nHe hesitated a few seconds, and then added with tragic calm:\n\n\"Perhaps you may encounter familiar faces. Family ties are not always\nformed to our tastes. Men of your blood are on the other side. If you\nsee any one of them . . . do not hesitate. Shoot! He is your enemy. Kill\nhim! . . . Kill him!\"\n\n\n\n\nPART III\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nAFTER THE MARNE\n\n\nAt the end of October, the Desnoyers family returned to Paris. Dona\nLuisa could no longer live in Biarritz, so far from her husband. In vain\nla Romantica discoursed on the dangers of a return. The Government was\nstill in Bordeaux, the President of the Republic and the Ministry making\nonly the most hurried apparitions in the Capital. The course of the war\nmight change at any minute; that little affair of the Marne was but\na momentary relief. . . . But the good senora, after having read\nDon Marcelo's letters, opposed an adamantine will to all contrary\nsuggestions. Besides, she was thinking of her son, her Julio, now a\nsoldier. . . . She believed that, by returning to Paris, she might in\nsome ways be more in touch with him than at this seaside resort near the\nSpanish frontier.\n\nChichi also wished to return because Rene was now filling the greater\npart of her thoughts. Absence had shown her that she was really in love\nwith him. Such a long time without seeing her little sugar soldier!\n. . . So the family abandoned their hotel life and returned to the\navenue Victor Hugo.\n\nSince the shock of the first September days, Paris had been gradually\nchanging its aspect. The nearly two million inhabitants who had been\nliving quietly in their homes without letting themselves be drawn into\nthe panic, had accepted the victory with grave serenity. None of them\ncould explain the exact course of the battle; they would learn all about\nit when it was entirely finished.\n\nOne September Sunday, at the hour when the Parisians are accustomed\nto take advantage of the lovely twilight, they had learned from the\nnewspapers of the great triumph of the Allies and of the great danger\nwhich they had so narrowly escaped. The people were delighted, but\ndid not, however, abandon their calm demeanor. Six weeks of war had\nradically changed the temperament of turbulent and impressionable Paris.\n\nThe victory was slowly restoring the Capital to its former aspect. A\nstreet that was practically deserted a few weeks before was now filled\nwith transients. The shops were reopening. The neighbors accustomed to\nthe conventional silence of their deserted apartment houses, again heard\nsounds of returning life in the homes above and below them.\n\nDon Marcelo's satisfaction in welcoming his family home was considerably\nclouded by the presence of Dona Elena. She was Germany returning to the\nencounter, the enemy again established within his tents. Would he never\nbe able to free himself from this bondage? . . . She was silent in her\nbrother-in-law's presence because recent events had rather bewildered\nher. Her countenance was stamped with a wondering expression as though\nshe were gazing at the upsetting of the most elemental physical laws.\nIn reflective silence she was puzzling over the Marne enigma, unable to\nunderstand how it was that the Germans had not conquered the ground\non which she was treading; and in order to explain this failure, she\nresorted to the most absurd suppositions.\n\nOne especially engrossing matter was increasing her sadness. Her sons.\n. . . What would become of her sons! Don Marcelo had never told her of\nhis meeting with Captain von Hartrott. He was maintaining absolute\nsilence about his sojourn at Villeblanche. He had no desire to recount\nhis adventures at the battle of the Marne. What was the use of saddening\nhis loved ones with such miseries? . . . He simply told Dona Luisa, who\nwas alarmed about the possible fate of the castle, that they would not\nbe able to go there for many years to come, because the hostilities had\nrendered it uninhabitable. A covering of zinc sheeting had been\nsubstituted for the ancient roof in order to prevent further injury from\nwind and rain to the wrecked interior. Later on, after peace had been\ndeclared, they would think about its renovation. Just now it had too\nmany inhabitants. And all the ladies, including Dona Elena, shuddered in\nimagining the thousands of buried bodies forming their ghastly circle\naround the building. This vision made Frau von Hartrott again groan,\n\"Ay, my sons!\"\n\nFinally, for humanity's sake, her brother-in-law set her mind at rest\nregarding the fate of one of them, the Captain von Hartrott. He was in\nperfect health at the beginning of the battle. He knew that this was so\nfrom a friend who had conversed with him . . . and he did not wish to\ntalk further about him.\n\nDona Luisa was spending a part of each day in the churches, trying to\nquiet her uneasiness with prayer. These petitions were no longer vague\nand generous for the fate of millions of unknown men, for the victory of\nan entire people. With maternal self-centredness they were focussed\non one single person--her son, who was a soldier like the others, and\nperhaps at this very moment was exposed to the greatest danger. The\ntears that he had cost her! . . . She had implored that he and his\nfather might come to understand each other, and finally just as God was\nmiraculously granting her supplication, Julio had taken himself off to\nthe field of death.\n\nHer entreaties never went alone to the throne of grace. Someone was\npraying near her, formulating identical requests. The tearful eyes of\nher sister were raised at the same time as hers to the figure of the\ncrucified Savior. \"Lord, save my son!\" . . . When uttering these words,\nDona Luisa always saw Julio as he looked in a pale photograph which he\nhad sent his father from the trenches--with kepis and military cloak, a\ngun in his right hand, and his face shadowed by a growing beard. \"O\nLord have mercy upon us!\" . . . and Dona Elena was at the same time\ncontemplating a group of officers with helmets and reseda uniforms\nreinforced with leather pouches for the revolver, field glasses and\nmaps, with sword-belt of the same material.\n\nOftentimes when Don Marcelo saw them setting forth together toward Saint\nHonore d'Eylau, he would wax very indignant.\n\n\"They are juggling with God. . . . This is most unreasonable! How could\nHe grant such contrary petitions? . . . Ah, these women!\"\n\nAnd then, with that superstition which danger awakens, he began to\nfear that his sister-in-law might cause some grave disaster to his son.\nDivinity, fatigued with so many contradictory prayers was going to turn\nHis back and not listen to any of them. Why did not this fatal woman\ntake herself off? . . .\n\nHe felt as exasperated at her presence in his home as he had at the\nbeginning of hostilities. Dona Luisa was still innocently repeating her\nsister's statements, submitting them to the superior criticism of her\nhusband. In this way, Don Marcelo had learned that the victory of the\nMarne had never really happened; it was an invention of the allies.\nThe German generals had deemed it prudent to retire through profound\nstrategic foresight, deferring till a little later the conquest of\nParis, and the French had done nothing but follow them over the ground\nwhich they had left free. That was all. She knew the opinions of\nmilitary men of neutral countries; she had been talking in Biarritz with\nsome people of unusual intelligence; she knew what the German papers\nwere saying about it. Nobody over there believed that yarn about the\nMarne. The people did not even know that there had been such a battle.\n\n\"Your sister said that?\" interrupted Desnoyers, pale with wrath and\namazement.\n\nBut he could do nothing but keep on longing for the bodily\ntransformation of this enemy planted under his roof. Ay, if she could\nonly be changed into a man! If only the evil genius of her husband could\nbut take her place for a brief half hour! . . .\n\n\"But the war still goes on,\" said Dona Luisa in artless perplexity. \"The\nenemy is still in France. . . . What good did the battle of the Marne\ndo?\"\n\nShe accepted his explanations with intelligent noddings of the head,\nseeming to take them all in, and an hour afterwards would be repeating\nthe same doubts.\n\nShe, nevertheless, began to evince a mute hostility toward her sister.\nUntil now, she had been tolerating her enthusiasms in favor of her\nhusband's country because she always considered family ties of more\nimportance than the rivalries of nations. Just because Desnoyers\nhappened to be a Frenchman and Karl a German, she was not going to\nquarrel with Elena. But suddenly this forbearance had vanished. Her son\nwas now in danger. . . . Better that all the von Hartrotts should die\nthan that Julio should receive the most insignificant wound! . . . She\nbegan to share the bellicose sentiments of her daughter, recognizing in\nher an exceptional talent for appraising events, and now desiring all of\nChichi's dagger thrusts to be converted into reality.\n\nFortunately La Romantica took herself off before this antipathy\ncrystallized. She was accustomed to pass the afternoons somewhere\noutside, and on her return would repeat the news gleaned from friends\nunknown to the rest of the family.\n\nThis made Don Marcelo wax very indignant because of the spies\nstill hidden in Paris. What mysterious world was his sister-in-law\nfrequenting? . . .\n\nSuddenly she announced that she was leaving the following morning; she\nhad obtained a passport to Switzerland, and from there she would go to\nGermany. It was high time for her to be returning to her own; she was\nmost appreciative of the hospitality shown her by the family. . . . And\nDesnoyers bade her good-bye with aggressive irony. His regards to\nvon Hartrott; he was hoping to pay him a visit in Berlin as soon as\npossible.\n\nOne morning Dona Luisa, instead of entering the neighboring church as\nusual, continued on to the rue de la Pompe, pleased at the thought of\nseeing the studio once more. It seemed to her that in this way she might\nput herself more closely in touch with her son. This would be a new\npleasure, even greater than poring over his photograph or re-reading his\nlast letter.\n\nShe was hoping to meet Argensola, the friend of good counsels, for she\nknew that he was still living in the studio. Twice he had come to see\nher by the service stairway as in the old days, but she had been out.\n\nAs she went up in the elevator, her heart was palpitating with pleasure\nand distress. It occurred to the good lady that the \"foolish virgins\"\nmust have had feelings like this when for the first time they fell from\nthe heights of virtue.\n\nThe tears came to her eyes when she beheld the room whose furnishings\nand pictures so vividly recalled the absent. Argensola hastened from the\ndoor at the end of the room, agitated, confused, and greeting her with\nexpressions of welcome at the same time that he was putting sundry\nobjects out of sight. A woman's sweater lying on the divan, he covered\nwith a piece of Oriental drapery--a hat trimmed with flowers, he sent\nflying into a far-away corner. Dona Luisa fancied that she saw a bit of\ngauzy feminine negligee embroidered in pink, flitting past the window\nframe. Upon the divan were two big coffee cups and bits of toast\nevidently left from a double breakfast. These artists! . . . The same\nas her son! And she was moved to compassion over the bad life of Julio's\ncounsellor.\n\n\"My honored Dona Luisa. . . . My DEAR Madame Desnoyers. . . .\"\n\nHe was speaking in French and at the top of his voice, looking\nfrantically at the door through which the white and rosy garments had\nflitted. He was trembling at the thought that his hidden companion, not\nunderstanding the situation, might in a jealous fit, compromise him by a\nsudden apparition.\n\nThen he spoke to his unexpected guest about the soldier, exchanging news\nwith her. Dona Luisa repeated almost word for word the paragraphs of his\nletters so frequently read. Argensola modestly refrained from displaying\nhis; the two friends were accustomed to an epistolary style which would\nhave made the good lady blush.\n\n\"A valiant man!\" affirmed the Spaniard proudly, looking upon the deeds\nof his comrade as though they were his own. \"A true hero! and I, Madame\nDesnoyers, know something about what that means. . . . His chiefs know\nhow to appreciate him.\" . . .\n\nJulio was a sergeant after having been only two months in the campaign.\nThe captain of his company and the other officials of the regiment\nbelonged to the fencing club in which he had had so many triumphs.\n\n\"What a career!\" he enthused. \"He is one of those who in youth reach\nthe highest ranks, like the Generals of the Revolution. . . . And what\nwonders he has accomplished!\"\n\nThe budding officer had merely referred in the most casual way to some\nof exploits, with the indifference of one accustomed to danger and\nexpecting the same attitude from his comrades; but his chum exaggerated\nthem, enlarging upon them as though they were the culminating events of\nthe war. He had carried an order across an infernal fire, after three\nmessengers, trying to accomplish the same feat, had fallen dead. He\nhad been the first to attack many trenches and had saved many of\nhis comrades by means of the blows from his bayonet and hand to hand\nencounters. Whenever his superior officers needed a reliable man, they\ninvariably said, \"Let Sergeant Desnoyers be called!\"\n\nHe rattled off all this as though he had witnessed it, as if he had\njust come from the seat of war, making Dona Luisa tremble and pour forth\ntears of joy mingled with fear over the glories and dangers of her son.\nThat Argensola certainly possessed the gift of affecting his hearers by\nthe realism with which he told his stories!\n\nIn gratitude for these eulogies, she felt that she ought to show some\ninterest in his affairs. . . . What had he been doing of late?\n\n\"I, Madame, have been where I ought to be. I have not budged from this\nspot. I have witnessed the siege of Paris.\"\n\nIn vain, his reason protested against the inexactitude of that word,\n\"siege.\" Under the influence of his readings about the war of 1870, he\nhad classed as a siege all those events which had developed near Paris\nduring the course of the battle of the Marne.\n\nHe pointed modestly to a diploma in a gold frame hanging above the piano\nagainst a tricolored flag. It was one of the papers sold in the streets,\na certificate of residence in the Capital during the week of danger. He\nhad filled in the blanks with his name and description of his person;\nand at the foot were very conspicuous the signatures of two residents of\nthe rue de la Pompe--a tavern-keeper, and a friend of the concierge. The\ndistrict Commissary of Police, with stamp and seal, had guaranteed the\nrespectability of these honorable witnesses. Nobody could remain in\ndoubt, after such precautions, as to whether he had or had not witnessed\nthe siege of Paris. He had such incredulous friends! . . .\n\nIn order to bring the scene more dramatically before his amiable\nlistener, he recalled the most striking of his impressions for her\nspecial benefit. Once, in broad daylight, he had seen a flock of sheep\nin the boulevard near the Madeleine. Their tread had resounded through\nthe deserted streets like echoes from the city of the dead. He was the\nonly pedestrian on the sidewalks thronged with cats and dogs.\n\nHis military recollections excited him like tales of glory.\n\n\"I have seen the march of the soldiers from Morocco. . . . I have seen\nthe Zouaves in automobiles!\"\n\nThe very night that Julio had gone to Bordeaux, he had wandered around\ntill sunrise, traversing half of Paris, from the Lion of Belfort, to\nthe Gare de l'Est. Twenty thousand men, with all their campaign outfit,\ncoming from Morocco, had disembarked at Marseilles and arrived at the\nCapital, making part of the trip by rail and the rest afoot. They had\ncome to take part in the great battle then beginning. They were troops\ncomposed of Europeans and Africans. The vanguard, on entering through\nthe Orleans gate, had swung into rhythmic pace, thus crossing half Paris\ntoward the Gare de l'Est where the trains were waiting for them.\n\nThe people of Paris had seen squadrons from Tunis with theatrical\nuniforms, mounted on horses, nervous and fleet, Moors with yellow\nturbans, Senegalese with black faces and scarlet caps, colonial\nartillerymen, and light infantry from Africa. These were professional\nwarriors, soldiers who in times of peace, led a life of continual\nfighting in the colonies--men with energetic profiles, bronzed faces and\nthe eyes of beasts of prey. They had remained motionlesss in the streets\nfor hours at a time, until room could be found for them in the military\ntrains. . . . And Argensola had followed this armed, impassive mass of\nhumanity from the boulevards, talking with the officials, and listening\nto the primitive cries of the African warriors who had never seen Paris,\nand who passed through it without curiosity, asking where the enemy was.\n\nThey had arrived in time to attack von Kluck on the banks of the Ourq,\nobliging him to fall back or be completely overwhelmed.\n\nA fact which Argensola did not relate to his sympathetic guest was that\nhis nocturnal excursion the entire length of this division of the\narmy had been accompanied by the amiable damsel within, and two other\nfriends--an enthusiastic and generous coterie, distributing flowers and\nkisses to the swarthy soldiers, and laughing at their consternation and\ngleaming white teeth.\n\nAnother day he had seen the most extraordinary of all the spectacles\nof the war. All the taxicabs, some two thousand vehicles, conveying\nbattalions of Zouaves, eight men to a motor car, had gone rolling past\nhim at full speed, bristling with guns and red caps. They had presented\na most picturesque train in the boulevards, like a kind of interminable\nwedding procession. And these soldiers got out of the automobiles on the\nvery edge of the battle field, opening fire the instant that they leaped\nfrom the steps. Gallieni had launched all the men who knew how to handle\na gun against the extreme right of the adversary at the supreme moment\nwhen the most insignificant weight might tip the scales in favor of the\nvictory which was hanging in the balance. The clerks and secretaries\nof the military offices, the orderlies of the government and the civil\npolice, all had marched to give that final push, forming a mass of\nheterogenous colors.\n\nAnd one Sunday afternoon when, with his three companions of the \"siege\"\nhe was strolling with thousands of other Parisians through the Bois\nde Boulogne, he had learned from the extras that the combat which\nhad developed so near to the city was turning into a great battle, a\nvictory.\n\n\"I have seen much, Madame Desnoyers. . . . I can relate great events.\"\n\nAnd she agreed with him. Of course Argensola had seen much! . . . And on\ntaking her departure, she offered him all the assistance in her power.\nHe was the friend of her son, and she was used to his petitions. Times\nhad changed; Don Marcelo's generosity now knew no bounds . . . but the\nBohemian interrupted her with a lordly gesture; he was living in luxury.\nJulio had made him his trustee. The draft from America had been\nhonored by the bank as a deposit, and he had the use of the interest\nin accordance with the regulations of the moratorium. His friend was\nsending him regularly whatever money was needed for household expenses.\nNever had he been in such prosperous condition. War had its good side,\ntoo . . . but not wishing to break away from old customs, he announced\nthat once more he would mount the service stairs in order to bear away a\nbasket of bottles.\n\nAfter her sister's departure, Dona Luisa went alone to the churches\nuntil Chichi in an outburst of devotional ardor, suddenly surprised her\nwith the announcement:\n\n\"Mama, I am going with you!\"\n\nThe new devotee was no longer agitating the household by her rollicking,\nboyish joy; she was no longer threatening the enemy with imaginary\ndagger thrusts. She was pale, and with dark circles under her eyes. Her\nhead was drooping as though weighed down with a set of serious, entirely\nnew thoughts on the other side of her forehead.\n\nDona Luisa observed her in the church with an almost indignant jealousy.\nHer headstrong child's eyes were moist, and she was praying as fervently\nas the mother . . . but it was surely not for her brother. Julio\nhad passed to second place in her remembrance. Another man was now\ncompletely filling her thoughts.\n\nThe last of the Lacours was no longer a simple soldier, nor was he now\nin Paris. Upon her return from Biarritz, Chichi had listened anxiously\nto the reports from her little sugar soldier. Throbbing with eagerness,\nshe wanted to know all about the dangers which he had been experiencing;\nand the young warrior \"in the auxiliary service\" told her of his\nrestlessness in the office during the interminable days in which the\ntroops were battling around Paris, hearing afar off the boom of the\nartillery. His father had wished to take him with him to Bordeaux,\nbut the administrative confusion of the last hour had kept him in the\ncapital.\n\nHe had done something more. On the day of the great crisis, when the\nacting governor had sent out all the available men in automobiles, he\nhad, unasked, seized a gun and occupied a motor with others from his\noffice. He had not seen anything more than smoke, burning houses, and\nwounded men. Not a single German had passed before his eyes, excepting a\nband of Uhlan prisoners, but for some hours he had been shooting on the\nedge of the road . . . and nothing more.\n\nFor a while, that was enough for Chichi. She felt very proud to be\nthe betrothed of a hero of the Marne, even though his intervention had\nlasted but a few hours. In a few days, however, her enthusiasm became\nrather clouded.\n\nIt was becoming annoying to stroll through the streets with Rene, a\nsimple soldier and in the auxiliary service, besides. . . . The women\nof the town, excited by the recollection of their men fighting at the\nfront, or clad in mourning because of the death of some loved one, would\nlook at them with aggressive insolence. The refinement and elegance\nof the Republican Prince seemed to irritate them. Several times, she\noverheard uncomplimentary words hurled against the \"embusques.\"\n\nThe fact that her brother who was not French was in the thick of the\nfighting, made the Lacour situation still more intolerable. She had an\n\"embusque\" for a lover. How her friends would laugh at her! . . .\n\nThe senator's son soon read her thoughts and began to lose some of\nhis smiling serenity. For three days he did not present himself at the\nDesnoyers' home, and they all supposed that he was detained by work at\nthe office.\n\nOne morning as Chichi was going toward the Bois de Boulogne, escorted by\none of the nut-brown maids, she noticed a soldier coming toward her. He\nwas wearing a bright uniform of the new gray-blue, the \"horizon blue\"\njust adopted by the French army. The chin strap of his kepi was gilt,\nand on his sleeve there was a little strip of gold. His smile, his\noutstretched hands, the confidence with which he advanced toward her\nmade her recognize him. Rene an officer! Her betrothed a sub-lieutenant!\n\n\"Yes, of course! I could do nothing else. . . . I had heard enough!\"\n\nWithout his father's knowledge, and assisted by his friends, he had in\na few days, wrought this wonderful transformation. As a graduate of\nthe Ecole Centrale, he held the rank of a sub-lieutenant of the Reserve\nArtillery, and he had requested to be sent to the front. Good-bye to the\nauxiliary service! . . . Within two days, he was going to start for the\nwar.\n\n\"You have done this!\" exclaimed Chichi. \"You have done this!\"\n\nAlthough very pale, she gazed fondly at him with her great eyes--eyes\nthat seemed to devour him with admiration.\n\n\"Come here, my poor boy. . . . Come here, my sweet little soldier! . . .\nI owe you something.\"\n\nAnd turning her back on the maid, she asked him to come with her round\nthe corner. It was just the same there. The cross street was just as\nthronged as the avenue. But what did she care for the stare of the\ncurious! Rapturously she flung her arms around his neck, blind and\ninsensible to everything and everybody but him.\n\n\"There. . . . There!\" And she planted on his face two vehement,\nsonorous, aggressive kisses.\n\nThen, trembling and shuddering, she suddenly weakened, and fumbling for\nher handkerchief, broke down in desperate weeping.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nIN THE STUDIO\n\n\nUpon opening the studio door one afternoon, Argensola stood motionless\nwith surprise, as though rooted to the ground.\n\nAn old gentleman was greeting him with an amiable smile.\n\n\"I am the father of Julio.\"\n\nAnd he walked into the apartment with the confidence of a man entirely\nfamiliar with his surroundings.\n\nBy good luck, the artist was alone, and was not obliged to tear\nfrantically from one end of the room to the other, hiding the traces\nof convivial company; but he was a little slow in regaining his\nself-control. He had heard so much about Don Marcelo and his bad temper,\nthat he was very uncomfortable at this unexpected appearance in the\nstudio. . . . What could the fearful man want?\n\nHis tranquillity was restored after a furtive, appraising glance. His\nfriend's father had aged greatly since the beginning of the war. He\nno longer had that air of tenacity and ill-humor that had made him\nunapproachable. His eyes were sparkling with childish glee; his hands\nwere trembling slightly, and his back was bent. Argensola, who had\nalways dodged him in the street and had thrilled with fear when sneaking\nup the stairway in the avenue home, now felt a sudden confidence.\nThe transformed old man was beaming on him like a comrade, and making\nexcuses to justify his visit.\n\nHe had wished to see his son's home. Poor old man! He was drawn thither\nby the same attraction which leads the lover to lessen his solitude by\nhaunting the places that his beloved has frequented. The letters from\nJulio were not enough; he needed to see his old abode, to be on familiar\nterms with the objects which had surrounded him, to breathe the same\nair, to chat with the young man who was his boon companion.\n\nHis fatherly glance now included Argensola. . . . \"A very interesting\nfellow, that Argensola!\" And as he thought this, he forgot completely\nthat, without knowing him, he had been accustomed to refer to him as\n\"shameless,\" just because he was sharing his son's prodigal life.\n\nDesnoyers' glance roamed delightedly around the studio. He knew well\nthese tapestries and furnishings, all the decorations of the former\nowner. He easily remembered everything that he had ever bought, in spite\nof the fact that they were so many. His eyes then sought the personal\neffects, everything that would call the absent occupant to mind; and he\npored over the miserably executed paintings, the unfinished dabs which\nfilled all the corners.\n\nWere they all Julio's? . . . Many of the canvases belonged to Argensola,\nbut affected by the old man's emotion, the artist displayed a marvellous\ngenerosity. Yes, everything was Julio's handiwork . . . and the father\nwent from canvas to canvas, halting admiringly before the vaguest daubs\nas though he could almost detect signs of genius in their nebulous\nconfusion.\n\n\"You think he has talent, really?\" he asked in a tone that implored a\nfavorable reply. \"I always thought him very intelligent . . . a little\nof the diable, perhaps, but character changes with years. . . . Now he\nis an altogether different man.\"\n\nAnd he almost wept at hearing the Spaniard, with his ready, enthusiastic\nspeech, lauding the departed \"diable,\" graphically setting forth the\nway in which his great genius was going to take the world when his turn\nshould come.\n\nThe painter of souls finally worked himself up into feeling as much\naffected as the father, and began to admire this old Frenchman with a\ncertain remorse, not wishing to remember how he had ranted against him\nnot so very long ago. What injustice! . . .\n\nDon Marcelo clasped his hand like an old comrade. All of his son's\nfriends were his friends. He knew the life that young men lived.\n. . . If at any time, he should be in any difficulties, if he needed an\nallowance so as to keep on with his painting--there he was, anxious to\nhelp him! He then and there invited him to dine at his home that very\nnight, and if he would care to come every evening, so much the better.\nHe would eat a family dinner, entirely informal. War had brought about a\ngreat many changes, but he would always be as welcome to the intimacy of\nthe hearth as though he were in his father's home.\n\nThen he spoke of Spain, in order to place himself on a more congenial\nfooting with the artist. He had never been there but once, and then only\nfor a short time; but after the war, he was going to know it better.\nHis father-in-law was a Spaniard, his wife had Spanish blood, and in\nhis home the language of the family was always Castilian. Ah, Spain, the\ncountry with a noble past and illustrious men! . . .\n\nArgensola had a strong suspicion that if he had been a native of any\nother land, the old gentleman would have praised it in the same way. All\nthis affection was but a reflex of his love for his absent son, but it\nso pleased the impressionable fellow that he almost embraced Don Marcelo\nwhen he took his departure.\n\nAfter that, his visits to the studio were very frequent. The artist was\nobliged to recommend his friends to take a good long walk after lunch,\nabstaining from reappearing in the rue de la Pompe until nightfall.\nSometimes, however, Don Marcelo would unexpectedly present himself in\nthe morning, and then the soulful impressionist would have to scurry\nfrom place to place, hiding here, concealing there, in order that his\nworkroom should preserve its appearance of virtuous labor.\n\n\"Youth . . . youth!\" the visitor would murmur with a smile of tolerance.\n\nAnd he actually had to make an effort to recall the dignity of his\nyears, in order not to ask Argensola to present him to the fair\nfugitives whose presence he suspected in the interior rooms. Perhaps\nthey had been his boy's friends, too. They represented a part of his\npast, anyway, and that was enough to make him presume that they had\ngreat charms which made them interesting.\n\nThese surprises, with their upsetting consequences, finally made the\npainter rather regret this new friendship; and the invitations to dinner\nwhich he was constantly receiving bored him, too. He found the Desnoyers\ntable most excellent, but too tedious--for the father and mother could\ntalk of nothing but their absent son. Chichi scarcely looked at her\nbrother's friend. Her attention was entirely concentrated on the war.\nThe irregularity in the mails was exasperating her so that she began\ncomposing protests to the government whenever a few days passed by\nwithout bringing any letter from sub-Lieutenant Lacour.\n\nArgensola excused himself on various pretexts from continuing to dine\nin the avenue Victor Hugo. It pleased him far more to haunt the cheap\nrestaurants with his female flock. His host accepted his negatives with\ngood-natured resignation.\n\n\"Not to-day, either?\"\n\nAnd in order to compensate for his guest's non-appearance, he would\npresent himself at the studio earlier than ever on the day following.\n\nIt was an exquisite pleasure for the doting father to let the time slip\nby seated on the divan which still seemed to guard the very hollow made\nby Julio's body, gazing at the canvases covered with color by his brush,\ntoasting his toes by the beat of a stove which roared so cosily in the\nprofound, conventual silence. It certainly was an agreeable refuge, full\nof memories in the midst of monotonous Paris so saddened by the war\nthat he could not meet a friend who was not preoccupied with his own\ntroubles.\n\nHis former purchasing dissipations had now lost all charm for him. The\nHotel Drouot no longer tempted him. At that time, the goods of German\nresidents, seized by the government, were being auctioned off;--a\nfelicitous retaliation for the enforced journey which the fittings of\nthe castle of Villeblanche had taken on the road to Berlin; but the\nagents told him in vain of the few competitors which he would now meet.\nHe no longer felt attracted by these extraordinary bargains. Why buy\nanything more? . . . Of what use was such useless stuff? Whenever he\nthought of the hard life of millions of men in the open field, he felt\na longing to lead an ascetic life. He was beginning to hate the\nostentatious splendors of his home on the avenue Victor Hugo. He now\nrecalled without a regretful pang, the destruction of the castle. No,\nhe was far better off there . . . and \"there\" was always the studio of\nJulio.\n\nArgensola began to form the habit of working in the presence of Don\nMarcelo. He knew that the resolute soul abominated inactive people, so,\nunder the contagious influence of dominant will-power, he began several\nnew pieces. Desnoyers would follow with interest the motions of his\nbrush and accept all the explanations of the soulful delineator. For\nhimself, he always preferred the old masters, and in his bargains had\nacquired the work of many a dead artist; but the fact that Julio had\nthought as his partner did was now enough for the devotee of the antique\nand made him admit humbly all the Spaniard's superior theories.\n\nThe artist's laborious zeal was always of short duration. After a few\nmoments, he always found that he preferred to rest on the divan and\nconverse with his guest.\n\nThe first subject, of course, was the absentee. They would repeat\nfragments of the letters they had received, and would speak of the past\nwith the most discreet allusions. The painter described Julio's life\nbefore the war as an existence dedicated completely to art. The father\nignored the inexactitude of such words, and gratefully accepted the lie\nas a proof of friendship. Argensola was such a clever comrade, never,\nin his loftiest verbal flights, making the slightest reference to Madame\nLaurier.\n\nThe old gentleman was often thinking about her nowadays, for he had seen\nher in the street giving her arm to her husband, now recovered from his\nwounds. The illustrious Lacour had informed him with great satisfaction\nof their reconciliation. The engineer had lost but one eye. Now he was\nagain at the head of his factory requisitioned by the government for the\nmanufacture of shells. He was a Captain, and was wearing two decorations\nof honor. The senator did not know exactly how this unexpected agreement\nhad come about. He had one day seen them coming home together, looking\naffectionately at each other, in complete oblivion of the past.\n\n\"Who remembers things that happened before the war,\" said the politic\nsage. \"They and their friends have completely forgotten all about their\ndivorce. Nowadays we are all living a new existence. . . . I believe\nthat the two are happier than ever before.\"\n\nDesnoyers had had a presentiment of this happiness when he saw them\ntogether. And the man of inflexible morality who was, the year before,\nanathematizing his son's behavior toward Laurier, considering it the\nmost unpardonable of his adventures, now felt a certain indignation in\nseeing Marguerite devoted to her husband, and talking to him with such\naffectionate interest. This matrimonial felicity seemed to him like the\nbasest ingratitude. A woman who had had such an influence over the life\nof Julio! . . . Could she thus easily forget her love? . . .\n\nThe two had passed on as though they did not recognize him. Perhaps\nCaptain Laurier did not see very clearly, but she had looked at him\nfrankly and then hastily averted her eyes so as to evade his greeting.\n. . . The old man felt sad over such indifference, not on his own\naccount, but on his son's. Poor Julio! . . . The unbending parent, in\ncomplete mental immorality, found himself lamenting this indifference as\nsomething monstrous.\n\nThe war was the other topic of conversation during the afternoons passed\nin the studio. Argensola was not now stuffing his pockets with printed\nsheets as at the beginning of hostilities. A serene and resigned calm\nhad succeeded the excitement of those first moments when the people were\ndaily looking for miraculous interventions. All the periodicals were\nsaying about the same thing. He was content with the official report,\nand he had learned to wait for that document without impatience,\nforeseeing that with but few exceptions, it would say the same thing as\nthe day before.\n\nThe fever of the first months, with its illusions and optimisms, now\nappeared to Argensola somewhat chimerical. Those not actually engaged in\nthe war were returning gradually to their habitual occupations. Life had\nrecovered its regular rhythm. \"One must live!\" said the people, and the\nstruggle for existence filled their thoughts with its immediate urgency.\nThose whose relatives were in the army, were still thinking of them, but\ntheir occupations were so blunting the edge of memory, that they were\nbecoming accustomed to their absence, regarding the unusual as the\nnormal condition. At first, the war made sleep out of the question, food\nimpossible to swallow, and embittered every pleasure with its funereal\npall. Now the shops were slowly opening, money was in circulation, and\npeople were able to laugh; they talked of the great calamity, but only\nat certain hours, as something that was going to be long, very long and\nwould exact great resignation to its inevitable fatalism.\n\n\"Humanity accustoms itself easily to trouble,\" said Argensola, \"provided\nthat the trouble lasts long enough. . . . In this lies our strength.\"\n\nDon Marcelo was not in sympathy with the general resignation. The\nwar was going to be much shorter than they were all imagining. His\nenthusiasm had settled on a speedy termination;--within the next three\nmonths, the next Spring probably; if peace were not declared in the\nSpring, it surely would be in the Summer.\n\nA new talker took part in these conversations. Desnoyers had become\nacquainted with the Russian neighbor of whom Argensola had so frequently\nspoken. Since this odd personage had also known his son, that was enough\nto make Tchernoff arouse his interest.\n\nIn normal times, he would have kept him at a distance. The millionaire\nwas a great believer in law and order. He abominated revolutionists,\nwith the instinctive fear of all the rich who have built up a fortune\nand remember their humble beginnings. Tchernoff's socialism and\nnationality brought vividly to his mind a series of feverish\nimages--bombs, daggers, stabbings, deserved expiations on the gallows,\nand exile to Siberia. No, he was not desirable as a friend. . . .\n\nBut now Don Marcelo was experiencing an abrupt reversal of his\nconvictions regarding alien ideas. He had seen so much! . . . The\nrevolting proceedings of the invasion, the unscrupulous methods of the\nGerman chiefs, the tranquillity with which their submarines were sinking\nboats filled with defenseless passengers, the deeds of the aviators\nwho were hurling bombs upon unguarded cities, destroying women and\nchildren--all this was causing the events of revolutionary terrorism\nwhich, years ago, used to arouse his wrath, to sink into relative\nunimportance.\n\n\"And to think,\" he said \"that we used to be as infuriated as though\nthe world were coming to an end, just because someone threw a bomb at a\ngrandee!\"\n\nThose titled victims had had certain reprehensible qualities which had\njustified their execution. They had died in consequence of acts which\nthey undertook, knowing well what the punishment would be. They had\nbrought retribution on themselves without trying to evade it, rarely\ntaking any precautions. While the terrorists of this war! . . .\n\nWith the violence of his imperious character, the old conservative now\nswung to the opposite extreme.\n\n\"The true anarchists are yet on top,\" he said with an ironical laugh.\n\"Those who terrified us formerly, all put together, were but a few\nmiserable creatures. . . . In a few seconds, these of our day kill more\ninnocent people than those others did in thirty years.\"\n\nThe gentleness of Tchernoff, his original ideas, his incoherencies\nof thought, bounding from reflection to word without any preparation,\nfinally won Don Marcelo so completely over that he formed the habit\nof consulting him about all his doubts. His admiration made him, too,\noverlook the source of certain bottles with which Argensola sometimes\ntreated his neighbor. He was delighted to have Tchernoff consume these\nsouvenirs of the time when he was living at swords' points with his son.\n\nAfter sampling the wine from the avenue Victor Hugo, the Russian would\nindulge in a visionary loquacity similar to that of the night when he\nevoked the fantastic cavalcade of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse.\n\nWhat his new convert most admired was his facility for making things\nclear, and fixing them in the imagination. The battle of the Marne with\nits subsequent combats and the course of both armies were events easily\nexplained. . . . If the French only had not been so fatigued after their\ntriumph of the Marne! . . .\n\n\"But human powers,\" continued Tchernoff, \"have their limits, and the\nFrench soldier, with all his enthusiasm, is a man like the rest. In the\nfirst place, the most rapid of marches from the East to the North, in\norder to resist the invasion of Belgium; then the combats; then the\nswift retreat that they might not be surrounded; finally a seven days'\nbattle--and all this in a period of three weeks, no more. . . . In\ntheir moment of triumph, the victors lacked the legs to follow up their\nadvantage, and they lacked the cavalry to pursue the fugitives. Their\nbeasts were even more exhausted than the men. When those who were\nretreating found that they were being spurred on with lessening\ntenacity, they had stretched themselves, half-dead with fatigue, on the\nfield, excavating the ground and forming a refuge for themselves. The\nFrench also flung themselves down, scraping the soil together so as not\nto lose what they had gained. . . . And in this way began the war of the\ntrenches.\"\n\nThen each line, with the intention of wrapping itself around that of\nthe enemy, had gone on prolonging itself toward the Northeast, and from\nthese successive stretchings had resulted the double course toward the\nsea--forming the greatest battle front ever known to history.\n\nWhen Don Marcelo with optimistic enthusiasm announced the end of the war\nin the following Spring or Summer--in four months at the outside--the\nRussian shook his head.\n\n\"It will be long . . . very long. It is a new war, the genuine modern\nwarfare. The Germans began hostilities in the old way as though they had\nobserved nothing since 1870--a war of involved movements, of battles\nin the open field, the same as Moltke might have planned, imitating\nNapoleon. They were desirous of bringing it to a speedy conclusion, and\nwere sure of triumph. Why employ new methods? . . . But the encounter of\nthe Marne twisted their plans, making them shift from the aggressive to\nthe defensive. They then brought into service all that the war staff had\nlearned in the campaigns of the Japanese and Russians, beginning the war\nof the trenches, the subterranean struggle which is the logical outcome\nof the reach and number of shots of the modern armament. The conquest of\nhalf a mile of territory to-day stands for more than did the assault\nof a stone fortress a century ago. Neither side is going to make any\nheadway for a long time. Perhaps they may never make a definite advance.\nThe war is bound to be long and tedious, like the athletic conquests\nbetween opponents who are equally matched.\"\n\n\"But it will have to come to an end, sometime,\" interpolated Desnoyers.\n\n\"Undoubtedly, but who knows when? . . . And in what condition will they\nboth be when it is all over?\" . . .\n\nHe was counting upon a rapid finale when it was least expected, through\nthe exhaustion of one of the contestants, carefully dissimulated until\nthe last moment.\n\n\"Germany will be vanquished,\" he added with firm conviction. \"I do\nnot know when nor how, but she will fall logically. She failed in her\nmaster-stroke in not entering Paris and overcoming its opposition. All\nthe trumps in her pack of cards were then played. She did not win, but\ncontinues playing the game because she holds many cards, and she will\nprolong it for a long time to come. . . . But what she could not do at\nfirst, she will never be able to do.\"\n\nFor Tchernoff, the final defeat did not mean the destruction of Germany\nnor the annihilation of the German people.\n\n\"Excessive patriotism irritates me,\" he pursued. \"Hearing people form\nplans for the definite extinction of Germany seems to me like listening\nto the Pan-Germanists of Berlin when they talk of dividing up the\ncontinents.\"\n\nThen he summed up his opinion.\n\n\"Imperialism will have to be crushed for the sake of the tranquillity of\nthe world; the great war machine which menaces the peace of nations will\nhave to be suppressed. Since 1870, we have all been living in dread of\nit. For forty years, the war has been averted, but in all that time,\nwhat apprehension!\" . . .\n\nWhat was most irritating Tchernoff was the moral lesson born of this\nsituation which had ended by overwhelming the world--the glorification\nof power, the sanctification of success, the triumph of materialism, the\nrespect for the accomplished fact, the mockery of the noblest sentiments\nas though they were merely sonorous and absurd phrases, the reversal\nof moral values . . . a philosophy of bandits which pretended to be\nthe last word of progress, and was no more than a return to despotism,\nviolence, and the barbarity of the most primitive epochs of history.\n\nWhile he was longing for the suppression of the representatives of\nthis tendency, he would not, therefore, demand the extermination of the\nGerman people.\n\n\"This nation has great merits jumbled with bad conditions inherited\nfrom a not far-distant, barbarous past. It possesses the genius of\norganization and work, and is able to lend great service to humanity.\n. . . But first it is necessary to give it a douche--the douche of\ndownfall. The Germans are mad with pride and their madness threatens\nthe security of the world. When those who have poisoned them with the\nillusion of universal hegemony have disappeared, when misfortune has\nfreshened their imagination and transformed them into a community of\nhumans, neither superior nor inferior to the rest of mankind, they will\nbecome a tolerant people, useful . . . and who knows but they may even\nprove sympathetic!\"\n\nAccording to Tchernoff, there was not in existence to-day a more\ndangerous nation. Its political organization was converting it into a\nwarrior horde, educated by kicks and submitted to continual humiliations\nin order that the willpower which always resists discipline might be\ncompletely nullified.\n\n\"It is a nation where all receive blows and desire to give them to those\nlower down. The kick that the Kaiser gives is transmitted from back to\nback down to the lowest rung of the social ladder. The blows begin\nin the school and are continued in the barracks, forming part of the\neducation. The apprenticeship of the Prussian Crown Princes has always\nconsisted in receiving fisticuffs and cowhidings from their progenitor,\nthe king. The Kaiser beats his children, the officer his soldiers, the\nfather his wife and children, the schoolmaster his pupils, and when the\nsuperior is not able to give blows, he subjects those under him to the\ntorment of moral insult.\"\n\nOn this account, when they abandoned their ordinary avocations, taking\nup arms in order to fall upon another human group, they did so with\nimplacable ferocity.\n\n\"Each one of them,\" continued the Russian, \"carries on his back the\nmarks of kicks, and when his turn comes, he seeks consolation in passing\nthem on to the unhappy creatures whom war puts into his power. This\nnation of war-lords, as they love to call themselves, aspires to\nlordship, but outside of the country. Within it, are the ones who least\nappreciate human dignity and, therefore, long vehemently to spread\ntheir dominant will over the face of the earth, passing from lackeys to\nlords.\"\n\nSuddenly Don Marcelo stopped going with such frequency to the studio. He\nwas now haunting the home and office of the senator, because this friend\nhad upset his tranquillity. Lacour had been much depressed since the\nheir to the family glory had broken through the protecting paternal net\nin order to go to war.\n\nOne night, while dining with the Desnoyers family, an idea popped into\nhis head which filled him with delight. \"Would you like to see your\nson?\" He needed to see Rene and had begun negotiating for a permit from\nheadquarters which would allow him to visit the front. His son belonged\nto the same army division as Julio; perhaps their camps were rather far\napart, but an automobile makes many revolutions before it reaches the\nend of its journey.\n\nIt was not necessary to say more. Desnoyers instantly felt the most\novermastering desire to see his boy, since, for so many months, he had\nhad to content himself with reading his letters and studying the snap\nshot which one of his comrades had made of his soldier son.\n\nFrom that time on, he besieged the senator as though he were a political\nsupporter desiring an office. He visited him in the mornings in his\nhome, invited him to dinner every evening, and hunted him down in the\nsalons of the Luxembourg. Before the first word of greeting could be\nexchanged, his eyes were formulating the same interrogation. . . . \"When\nwill you get that permit?\"\n\nThe great man could only reply by lamenting the indifference of the\nmilitary department toward the civilian element; it always had been\ninimical toward parliamentarism.\n\n\"Besides, Joffre is showing himself most unapproachable; he does not\nencourage the curious. . . . To-morrow I will see the President.\"\n\nA few days later, he arrived at the house in the avenue Victor Hugo,\nwith an expression of radiant satisfaction that filled Don Marcelo with\njoy.\n\n\"It has come?\"\n\n\"It has come. . . . We start the day after to-morrow.\"\n\nDesnoyers went the following afternoon to the studio in the rue de la\nPompe.\n\n\"I am going to-morrow!\"\n\nThe artist was very eager to accompany him. Would it not be possible for\nhim to go, too, as secretary to the senator? . . . Don Marcelo smiled\nbenevolently. The authorization was only for Lacour and one companion.\nHe was the one who was going to pose as secretary, valet or utility man\nto his future relative-in-law.\n\nAt the end of the afternoon, he left the studio, accompanied to the\nelevator by the lamentations of Argensola. To think that he could not\njoin that expedition! . . . He believed that he had lost the opportunity\nto paint his masterpiece.\n\nJust outside of his home, he met Tchernoff. Don Marcelo was in high good\nhumor. The certainty that he was soon going to see his son filled him\nwith boyish good spirits. He almost embraced the Russian in spite of his\nslovenly aspect, his tragic beard and his enormous hat which made every\none turn to look after him.\n\nAt the end of the avenue, the Arc de Triomphe stood forth against a sky\ncrimsoned by the sunset. A red cloud was floating around the monument,\nreflected on its whiteness with purpling palpitations.\n\nDesnoyers recalled the four horsemen, and all that Argensola had told\nhim before presenting him to the Russian.\n\n\"Blood!\" shouted jubilantly. \"All the sky seems to be blood-red. . . .\nIt is the apocalyptic beast who has received his death-wound. Soon we\nshall see him die.\"\n\nTchernoff smiled, too, but his was a melancholy smile.\n\n\"No; the beast does not die. It is the eternal companion of man. It\nhides, spouting blood, forty . . . sixty . . . a hundred years, but\neventually it reappears. All that we can hope is that its wound may be\nlong and deep, that it may remain hidden so long that the generation\nthat now remembers it may never see it again.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nWAR\n\n\nDon Marcelo was climbing up a mountain covered with woods.\n\nThe forest presented a tragic desolation. A silent tempest had installed\nitself therein, placing everything in violent unnatural positions. Not a\nsingle tree still preserved its upright form and abundant foliage as in\nthe days of peace. The groups of pines recalled the columns of ruined\ntemples. Some were still standing erect, but without their crowns, like\nshafts that might have lost their capitals; others were pierced like the\nmouthpiece of a flute, or like pillars struck by a thunderbolt. Some had\nsplintery threads hanging around their cuts like used toothpicks.\n\nA sinister force of destruction had been raging among these beeches,\nspruce and oaks. Great tangles of their cut boughs were cluttering the\nground, as though a band of gigantic woodcutters had just passed by. The\ntrunks had been severed a little distance from the ground with a clean\nand glistening stroke, as though with a single blow of the axe. Around\nthe disinterred roots were quantities of stones mixed with sod, stones\nthat had been sleeping in the recesses of the earth and had been brought\nto the surface by explosions.\n\nAt intervals--gleaming among the trees or blocking the roadway with an\nimportunity which required some zigzagging--was a series of pools, all\nalike, of regular geometrical circles. To Desnoyers, they seemed like\nsunken basins for the use of the invisible Titans who had been hewing\nthe forest. Their great depth extended to their very edges. A swimmer\nmight dive into these lagoons without ever touching bottom. Their\nwater was greenish, still water--rain water with a scum of vegetation\nperforated by the respiratory bubbles of the little organisms coming to\nlife in its vitals.\n\nBordering the hilly pathway through the pines, were many mounds with\ncrosses of wood--tombs of French soldiers topped with little tricolored\nflags. Upon these moss-covered graves were the old kepis of the gunners.\nThe ferocious wood-chopper, in destroying this woods, had also blindly\ndemolished many of the ants swarming around the trunks.\n\nDon Marcelo was wearing leggings, a broad hat, and on his shoulders,\na fine poncho arranged like a shawl--garments which recalled his\nfar-distant life on the ranch. Behind him came Lacour trying to preserve\nhis senatorial dignity in spite of his gasps and puffs of fatigue.\nHe also was wearing high boots and a soft hat, but he had kept to his\nsolemn frock-coat in order not to abandon entirely his parliamentary\nuniform. Before them marched two captains as guides.\n\nThey were on a mountain occupied by the French artillery, and were\nclimbing to the top where were hidden cannons and cannons, forming a\nline some miles in length. The German artillery had caused the woodland\nruin around the visitors, in their return of the French fire. The\ncircular pools were the hollows dug by the German shells in the limy,\nnon-porous soil which preserved all the runnels of rain.\n\nThe visiting party had left their automobile at the foot of the\nmountain. One of the officers, a former artilleryman, explained\nthis precaution to them. It was necessary to climb this roadway very\ncautiously. They were within reach of the enemy, and an automobile might\nattract the attention of their gunners.\n\n\"A little fatiguing, this climb,\" he continued. \"Courage, Senator\nLacour! . . . We are almost there.\"\n\nThey began to meet artillerymen, many of them not in uniform but wearing\nthe military kepis. They looked like workmen from a metal factory,\nfoundrymen with jackets and pantaloons of corduroy. Their arms were\nbare, and some had put on wooden shoes in order to get over the mud with\ngreater security. They were former iron laborers, mobilized into the\nartillery reserves. Their sergeants had been factory overseers, and many\nof them officials, engineers and proprietors of big workshops.\n\nSuddenly the excursionists stumbled upon the iron inmates of the woods.\nWhen these spoke, the earth trembled, the air shuddered, and the native\ninhabitants of the forest, the crows, rabbits, butterflies and ants,\nfled in terrified flight, trying to hide themselves from the fearful\nconvulsion which seemed to be bringing the world to an end. Just at\npresent, the bellowing monsters were silent, so that they came upon them\nunexpectedly. Something was sticking up out of the greenery like a gray\nbeam; at other times, this apparition would emerge from a conglomeration\nof dry trunks. Around this obstacle was cleared ground occupied by men\nwho lived, slept and worked about this huge manufactory on wheels.\n\nThe senator, who had written verse in his youth and composed oratorical\npoetry when dedicating various monuments in his district, saw in these\nsolitary men on the mountain side, blackened by the sun and smoke,\nwith naked breasts and bare arms, a species of priests dedicated to\nthe service of a fatal divinity that was receiving from their hands\nofferings of enormous explosive capsules, hurling them forth in\nthunderclaps.\n\nHidden under the branches, in order to escape the observation of the\nenemy's birdmen, the French cannon were scattered among the hills\nand hollows of the highland range. In this herd of steel, there were\nenormous pieces with wheels reinforced by metal plates, somewhat like\nthe farming engines which Desnoyers had used on his ranch for plowing.\nLike smaller beasts, more agile and playful in their incessant yelping,\nthe groups of '75 were mingled with the terrific monsters.\n\nThe two captains had received from the general of their division orders\nto show Senator Lacour minutely the workings of the artillery, and\nLacour was accepting their observations with corresponding gravity while\nhis eyes roved from side to side in the hope of recognizing his son.\nThe interesting thing for him was to see Rene . . . but recollecting the\nofficial pretext of his journey, he followed submissively from cannon to\ncannon, listening patiently to all explanations.\n\nThe operators next showed him the servants of these pieces, great oval\ncylinders extracted from subterranean storehouses called shelters. These\nstorage places were deep burrows, oblique wells reinforced with sacks of\nstones and wood. They served as a refuge to those off duty, and kept\nthe munitions away from the enemy's shell. An artilleryman exhibited two\npouches of white cloth, joined together and very full. They looked like\na double sausage and were the charge for one of the large cannons. The\nopen packet showed some rose-colored leaves, and the senator greatly\nadmired this dainty paste which looked like an article for the dressing\ntable instead of one of the most terrible explosives of modern warfare.\n\n\"I am sure,\" said Lacour, \"that if I had found one of these delicate\npackets on the street, I should have thought that it had been dropped\nfrom some lady's vanity bag, or by some careless clerk from a perfumery\nshop . . . anything but an explosive! And with this trifle that looks as\nif it were made for the lips, it is possible to blow up an\nedifice!\" . . .\n\nAs they continued their visit of investigation, they came upon a\npartially destroyed round tower in the highest part of the mountain.\nThis was the most dangerous post. From it, an officer was examining\nthe enemy's line in order to gauge the correctness of the aim of the\ngunners. While his comrades were under the ground or hidden by the\nbranches, he was fulfilling his mission from this visible point.\n\nA short distance from the tower a subterranean passageway opened before\ntheir eyes. They descended through its murky recesses until they found\nthe various rooms excavated in the ground. One side of the mountain cut\nin points formed its exterior facade. Narrow little windows, cut in the\nstone, gave light and air to these quarters.\n\nAn old commandant in charge of the section came out to meet them.\nDesnoyers thought that he must be the floorwalker of some big department\nstore in Paris. His manners were so exquisite and his voice so suave\nthat he seemed to be imploring pardon at every word, or addressing a\ngroup of ladies, offering them goods of the latest novelty. But this\nimpression only lasted a moment. This soldier with gray hair and\nnear-sighted glasses who, in the midst of war, was retaining his\ncustomary manner of a building director receiving his clients, showed\non moving his arms, some bandages and surgical dressings within his\nsleeves, He was wounded in both wrists by the explosion of a shell, but\nhe was, nevertheless, sticking to his post.\n\n\"A devil of a honey-tongued, syrupy gentleman!\" mused Don Marcelo. \"Yet\nhe is undoubtedly an exceptional person!\"\n\nBy this time, they had entered into the main office, a vast room which\nreceived its light through a horizontal window about ten feet wide and\nonly a palm and a half high, reminding one of the open space between the\nslats of a Venetian blind. Below it was a pine table filled with papers\nand surrounded by stools. When occupying one of these seats, one's eyes\ncould sweep the entire plain. On the walls were electric apparatus,\nacoustic tubes and telephones--many telephones.\n\nThe Commandant sorted and piled up the papers, offering the stools with\ndrawing-room punctilio.\n\n\"Here, Senator Lacour.\"\n\nDesnoyers, humble attendant, took a seat at his side. The Commandant\nnow appeared to be the manager of a theatre, preparing to exhibit an\nextraordinary show. He spread upon the table an enormous paper which\nreproduced all the features of the plain extended before them--roads,\ntowns, fields, heights and valleys. Upon this map was a triangular group\nof red lines in the form of an open fan; the vertex represented the\nplace where they were, and the broad part of the triangle was the limit\nof the horizon which they were sweeping with their eyes.\n\n\"We are going to fire at that grove,\" said the artilleryman, pointing\nto one end of the map. \"There it is,\" he continued, designating a little\ndark line. \"Take your glasses.\"\n\nBut before they could adjust the binoculars, the Commandant placed a new\npaper on top of the map. It was an enormous and somewhat hazy photograph\nupon whose plan appeared a fan of red lines like the other one.\n\n\"Our aviators,\" explained the gunner courteously, \"have taken this\nmorning some views of the enemy's positions. This is an enlargement from\nour photographic laboratory. . . . According to this information, there\nare two German regiments encamped in that wood.\"\n\nDon Marcelo saw on the print the spot of woods, and within it white\nlines which represented roads, and groups of little squares which were\nblocks of houses in a village. He believed he must be in an aeroplane\ncontemplating the earth from a height of three thousand feet. Then he\nraised the glasses to his eyes, following the direction of one of the\nred lines, and saw enlarged in the circle of the glass a black bar,\nsomewhat like a heavy line of ink--the grove, the refuge of the foe.\n\n\"Whenever you say, Senator Lacour, we will begin,\" said the Commandant,\nreaching the topmost notch of his courtesy. \"Are you ready?\"\n\nDesnoyers smiled slightly. For what was his illustrious friend to\nmake himself ready? What difference could it possibly make to a mere\nspectator, much interested in the novelty of the show? . . .\n\nThere sounded behind them numberless bells, gongs that called and gongs\nthat answered. The acoustic tubes seemed to swell out with the gallop\nof words. The electric wire filled the silence of the room with the\npalpitations of its mysterious life. The bland Chief was no longer\noccupied with his guests. They conjectured that he was behind them, his\nmouth at the telephone, conversing with various officials some distance\noff. Yet the urbane and well-spoken hero was not abandoning for one\nmoment his candied courtesy.\n\n\"Will you be kind enough to tell me when you are ready to begin?\" they\nheard him saying to a distant officer. \"I shall be much pleased to\ntransmit the order.\"\n\nDon Marcelo felt a slight nervous tremor near one of his legs; it was\nLecour, on the qui vive over the approaching novelty. They were going\nto begin firing; something was going to happen that he had never seen\nbefore. The cannons were above their heads; the roughly vaulted roof\nwas going to tremble like the deck of a ship when they shot over it. The\nroom with its acoustic tubes and its vibrations from the telephones was\nlike the bridge of a vessel at the moment of clearing for action. The\nnoise that it was going to make! . . . A few seconds flitted by that\nto them seemed unusually long . . . and then suddenly a sound like\na distant peal of thunder which appeared to come from the clouds.\nDesnoyers no longer felt the nervous twitter against his knee. The\nsenator seemed surprised; his expression seemed to say, \"And is that\nall?\" . . . The heaps of earth above them had deadened the report, so\nthat the discharge of the great machine seemed no more than the blow\nof a club upon a mattress. Far more impressive was the scream of the\nprojectile sounding at a great height but displacing the air with such\nviolence that its waves reached even to the window.\n\nIt went flying . . . flying, its roar lessening. Some time passed before\nthey noticed its effects, and the two friends began to believe that\nit must have been lost in space. \"It will not strike . . . it will not\nstrike,\" they were thinking. Suddenly there surged up on the horizon,\nexactly in the spot indicated over the blur of the woods, a tremendous\ncolumn of smoke, a whirling tower of black vapor followed by a volcanic\nexplosion.\n\n\"How dreadful it must be to be there!\" said the senator.\n\nHe and Desnoyers were experiencing a sensation of animal joy, a selfish\nhilarity in seeing themselves in such a safe place several yards\nunderground.\n\n\"The Germans are going to reply at any moment,\" said Don Marcelo to his\nfriend.\n\nThe senator was of the same opinion. Undoubtedly they would retaliate,\ncarrying on an artillery duel.\n\nAll of the French batteries had opened fire. The mountain was\nthundering, the shell whining, the horizon, still tranquil, was\nbristling with black, spiral columns. The two realized more and more how\nsnug they were in this retreat, like a box at the theatre.\n\nSomeone touched Lacour on the shoulder. It was one of the captains who\nwas conducting them through the front.\n\n\"We are going above,\" he said simply. \"You must see close by how our\ncannons are working. The sight will be well worth the trouble.\"\n\nAbove? . . . The illustrious man was as perplexed, as astonished as\nthough he had suggested an interplanetary trip. Above, when the enemy\nwas going to reply from one minute to another? . . .\n\nThe captain explained that sub-Lieutenant Lacour was perhaps awaiting\nhis father. By telephone they had advised his battery stationed a little\nfurther on; it would be necessary to go now in order to see him. So\nthey again climbed up to the light through the mouth of the tunnel. The\nsenator then drew himself up, majestically erect.\n\n\"They are going to fire at us,\" said a voice in his interior, \"The foe\nis going to reply.\"\n\nBut he adjusted his coat like a tragic mantle and advanced at a\ncircumspect and solemn pace. If those military men, adversaries of\nparliamentarism, fancied that they were going to laugh up their sleeve\nat the timidity of a civilian, he would show them their mistake!\n\nDesnoyers could not but admire the resolution with which the great man\nmade his exit from the shelter, exactly as if he were going to march\nagainst the foe.\n\nAt a little distance, the atmosphere was rent into tumultuous waves,\nmaking their legs tremble, their ears hum, and their necks feel as\nthough they had just been struck. They both thought that the Germans\nhad begun to return the fire, but it was the French who were shooting.\nA feathery stream of vapor came up out of the woods a dozen yards away,\ndissolving instantly. One of the largest pieces, hidden in the nearby\nthicket, had just been discharged. The captains continued their\nexplanations without stopping their journey. It was necessary to pass\ndirectly in front of the spitting monster, in spite of the violence of\nits reports, so as not to venture out into the open woods near the watch\ntower. They were expecting from one second to another now, the response\nfrom their neighbors across the way. The guide accompanying Don Marcelo\ncongratulated him on the fearlessness with which he was enduring the\ncannonading.\n\n\"My friend is well acquainted with it,\" remarked the senator proudly.\n\"He was in the battle of the Marne.\"\n\nThe two soldiers evidently thought this very strange, considering\nDesnoyers' advanced age. To what section had he belonged? In what\ncapacity had he served? . . .\n\n\"Merely as a victim,\" was the modest reply.\n\nAn officer came running toward them from the tower side, across the\ncleared space. He waved his kepi several times that they might see him\nbetter. Lacour trembled for him. The enemy might descry him; he was\nsimply making a target of himself by cutting across that open space in\norder to reach them the sooner. . . . And he trembled still more as he\ncame nearer. . . . It was Rene!\n\nHis hands returned with some astonishment the strong, muscular grasp.\nHe noticed that the outlines of his son's face were more pronounced, and\ndarkened with the tan of camp life. An air of resolution, of confidence\nin his own powers, appeared to emanate from his person. Six months of\nintense life had transformed him. He was the same but broader-chested\nand more stalwart. The gentle and sweet features of his mother were lost\nunder the virile mask. . . . Lacour recognized with pride that he now\nresembled himself.\n\nAfter greetings had been exchanged, Rene paid more attention to Don\nMarcelo than to his father, because he reminded him of Chichi. He\ninquired after her, wishing to know all the details of her life, in\nspite of their ardent and constant correspondence.\n\nThe senator, meanwhile, still under the influence of his recent emotion,\nhad adopted a somewhat oratorical air toward his son. He forthwith\nimprovised a fragment of discourse in honor of that soldier of the\nRepublic bearing the glorious name of Lacour, deeming this an opportune\ntime to make known to these professional soldiers the lofty lineage of\nhis family.\n\n\"Do your duty, my son. The Lacours inherit warrior traditions. Remember\nour ancestor, the Deputy of the Convention who covered himself with\nglory in the defense of Mayence!\"\n\nWhile he was discoursing, they had started forward, doubling a point of\nthe greenwood in order to get behind the cannons.\n\nHere the racket was less violent. The great engines, after each\ndischarge, were letting escape through the rear chambers little clouds\nof smoke like those from a pipe. The sergeants were dictating numbers,\ncommunicated in a low voice by another gunner who had a telephone\nreceiver at his ear. The workmen around the cannon were obeying\nsilently. They would touch a little wheel and the monster would raise\nits grey snout, moving it from side to side with the intelligent\nexpression and agility of an elephant's trunk. At the foot of the\nnearest piece, stood the operator, rod in hand, and with impassive\nface. He must be deaf, yet his facial inertia was stamped with a\ncertain authority. For him, life was no more than a series of shots and\ndetonations. He knew his importance. He was the servant of the tempest,\nthe guardian of the thunderbolt.\n\n\"Fire!\" shouted the sergeant.\n\nAnd the thunder broke forth in fury. Everything appeared to be\ntrembling, but the two visitors were by this time so accustomed to the\ndin that the present uproar seemed but a secondary affair.\n\nLacour was about to take up the thread of his discourse about his\nglorious forefather in the convention when something interfered.\n\n\"They are firing,\" said the man at the telephone simply.\n\nThe two officers repeated to the senator this news from the watch tower.\nHad he not said that the enemy was going to fire? . . . Obeying a sane\ninstinct of preservation, and pushed at the same time by his son, he\nfound himself in the refuge of the battery. He certainly did not wish\nto hide himself in this cave, so he remained near the entrance, with a\ncuriosity which got the best of his disquietude.\n\nHe felt the approach of the invisible projectile, in spite of the\nroar of the neighboring cannon. He perceived with rare sensibility\nits passage through the air, above the other closer and more powerful\nsounds. It was a squealing howl that was swelling in intensity, that was\nopening out as it advanced, filling all space. Soon it ceased to be a\nshriek, becoming a rude roar formed by divers collisions and frictions,\nlike the descent of an electric tram through a hillside road, or the\ncourse of a train which passes through a station without stopping.\n\nHe saw it approach in the form of a cloud, bulging as though it were\ngoing to explode over the battery. Without knowing just how it happened,\nthe senator suddenly found himself in the bottom of the shelter, his\nhands in cold contact with a heap of steel cylinders lined up like\nbottles. They were projectiles.\n\n\"If a German shell,\" he thought, \"should explode above this burrow . . .\nwhat a frightful blowing up!\" . . .\n\nBut he calmed himself by reflecting on the solidity of the arched vault\nwith its beams and sacks of earth several yards thick. Suddenly he\nwas in absolute darkness. Another had sought refuge in the shelter,\nobstructing the light with his body; perhaps his friend Desnoyers.\n\nA year passed by while his watch was registering a single second, then\na century at the same rate . . . and finally the awaited thunder burst\nforth, making the refuge vibrate, but with a kind of dull elasticity,\nas though it were made of rubber. In spite of its thud, the explosion\nwrought horrible damage. Other minor explosions, playful and whistling,\nfollowed behind the first. In his imagination, Lacour saw the\ncataclysm--a writhing serpent, vomiting sparks and smoke, a species of\nWagnerian monster that upon striking the ground was disgorging thousands\nof fiery little snakes, that were covering the earth with their deadly\ncontortions. . . . The shell must have burst nearby, perhaps in the very\nsquare occupied by this battery.\n\nHe came out of the shelter, expecting to encounter a sickening display\nof dismembered bodies, and he saw his son smiling, smoking a cigar and\ntalking with Desnoyers. . . . That was a mere nothing! The gunners were\ntranquilly finishing the charging of a huge piece. They had raised their\neyes for a moment as the enemy's shell went screaming by, and then had\ncontinued their work.\n\n\"It must have fallen about three hundred yards away,\" said Rene\ncheerfully.\n\nThe senator, impressionable soul, felt suddenly filled with heroic\nconfidence. It was not worth while to bother about his personal safety\nwhen other men--just like him, only differently dressed--were not paying\nthe slightest attention to the danger.\n\nAnd as the other projectiles soared over his head to lose themselves\nin the woods with the explosions of a volcano, he remained by his son's\nside, with no other sign of tension than a slight trembling of\nthe knees. It seemed to him now that it was only the French\nmissiles--because they were on his side--that were hitting the bull's\neye. The others must be going up in the air and losing themselves in\nuseless noise. Of just such illusions is valor often compounded! . . .\n\"And is that all?\" his eyes seemed to be asking.\n\nHe now recalled rather shamefacedly his retreat to the shelter; he was\nbeginning to feel that he could live in the open, the same as Rene.\n\nThe German missiles were getting considerably more frequent. They were\nno longer lost in the wood, and their detonations were sounding nearer\nand nearer. The two officials exchanged glances. They were responsible\nfor the safety of their distinguished charge.\n\n\"Now they are warming up,\" said one of them.\n\nRene, as though reading their thoughts, prepared to go. \"Good-bye,\nfather!\" They were needing him in his battery. The senator tried to\nresist; he wished to prolong the interview, but found that he was\nhitting against something hard and inflexible that repelled all his\ninfluence. A senator amounted to very little with people accustomed to\ndiscipline. \"Farewell, my boy! . . . All success to you! . . . Remember\nwho you are!\"\n\nThe father wept as he embraced his son, lamenting the brevity of the\ninterview, and thinking of the dangers awaiting him.\n\nWhen Rene had disappeared, the captains again recommended their\ndeparture. It was getting late; they ought to reach a certain cantonment\nbefore nightfall. So they went down the hill in the shelter of a cut in\nthe mountain, seeing the enemy's shells flying high above them.\n\nIn a hollow, they came upon several groups of the famed seventy-fives\nspread about through the woods, hidden by piles of underbrush, like\nsnapping dogs, howling and sticking up their gray muzzles. The great\ncannon were roaring only at intervals, while the steel pack of hounds\nwere yelping incessantly without the slightest break in their noisy\nwrath--like the endless tearing of a piece of cloth. The pieces were\nmany, the volleys dizzying, and the shots uniting in one prolonged\nshriek, as a series of dots unite to form a single line.\n\nThe chiefs, stimulated by the din, were giving their orders in yells,\nand waving their arms from behind the pieces. The cannon were sliding\nover the motionless gun carriages, advancing and receding like automatic\npistols. Each charge dropped an empty shell, and introduced a fresh one\ninto the smoking chamber.\n\nBehind the battery, the air was racking in furious waves. With every\nshot, Lacour and his companion received a blow on the breast, the\nviolent contact with an invisible hand, pushing them backward and\nforward. They had to adjust their breathing to the rhythm of the\nconcussions. During the hundredth part of a second, between the passing\nof one aerial wave and the advance of the next, their chests felt the\nagony of vacuum. Desnoyers admired the baying of those gray dogs. He\nknew well their bite, extending across many kilometres. Now they were\nfresh and at home in their own kennels.\n\nTo Lacour it seemed as though the rows of cannon were chanting a\nmeasure, monotonous and fiercely impassioned that must be the martial\nhymn of the humanity of prehistoric times. This music of dry, deafening,\ndelirious notes was awakening in the two what is sleeping in the depths\nof every soul--the savagery of a remote ancestry. The air was hot with\nacrid odors, pungent and brutishly intoxicating. The perfumes from the\nexplosions were penetrating to the brain through the mouth, the eyes and\nthe ears.\n\nThey began to be infected with the same ardor as the directors, shouting\nand swinging their arms in the midst of the thundering. The empty\ncapsules were mounting up in thick layers behind the cannon. Fire! . . .\nalways, fire!\n\n\"We must sprinkle them well,\" yelled the chiefs. \"We must give a good\nsoaking to the groves where the Boches are hidden.\"\n\nSo the mouths of '75 rained without interruption, inundating the remote\nthickets with their shells.\n\nInflamed by this deadly activity, frenzied by the destructive celerity,\ndominated by the dizzying sway of the ruby leaves, Lacour and Desnoyers\nfound themselves waving their hats, leaping from one side to another as\nthough they were dancing the sacred dance of death, and shouting with\nmouths dry from the acrid vapor of the powder. . . . \"Hurrah! . . .\nHurrah!\"\n\nThe automobile rode all the afternoon long, stopping only when it met\nlong files of convoys. It traversed uncultivated fields with skeletons\nof dwellings, and ran through burned towns which were no more than a\nsuccession of blackened facades.\n\n\"Now it is your turn,\" said the senator to Desnoyers. \"We are going to\nsee your son.\"\n\nAt nightfall, they ran across groups of infantry, soldiers with long\nbeards and blue uniforms discolored by the inclemency of the weather.\nThey were returning from the intrenchments, carrying over the hump of\ntheir knapsacks, spades, picks and other implements for removing the\nground, that had acquired the importance of arms of combat. They were\ncovered with mud from head to foot. All looked old in full youth. Their\njoy at returning to the cantonment after a week in the trenches, made\nthem fill the silence of the plain with songs in time to the tramp\nof their nailed boots. Through the violet twilight drifted the winged\nstrophes of the Marseillaise, or the heroic affirmations of the Chant du\nDepart.\n\n\"They are the soldiers of the Revolution,\" exclaimed Lacour with\nenthusiasm. \"France has returned to 1792.\"\n\nThe two captains established their charges for the night in a\nhalf-ruined town where one of their divisions had its headquarters, and\nthen took their leave. Others would act as their escort the following\nmorning.\n\nThe two friends were lodging in the Hotel de la Siren, an old inn with\nits front gnawed by shell-fire. The proprietor showed them with pride\na window broken in the form of a crater. This window had made the\nold tavern sign--a woman of iron with the tail of a fish--sink into\ninsignificance. As Desnoyers was occupying the room next to the one that\nhad received the mark of the shell, the inn-keeper was anxious to point\nit out to them before they went to bed.\n\nEverything was broken--walls, floor, roof. The furniture, a pile of\nsplinters in the corner; the flowered wall paper, a fringe of tatters\nhanging from the walls. Through an enormous hole they could see the\nstars and feel the chill of the night. The owner stated that this\ndestruction was not the work of the Germans, but was caused by a\nprojectile from one of the seventy-fives when repelling the invaders\nfrom the village. And he beamed on the ruin with patriotic pride,\nrepeating:\n\n\"There's a sample of French marksmanship for you! How do you like the\nworkings of the seventy-fives? . . . What do you think of that\nnow? . . .\"\n\nIn spite of the fatigue of the journey, Don Marcelo slept badly, excited\nby the thought that his son was not far away.\n\nAn hour before daybreak, they left the village, in an automobile, guided\nby another official. On both sides of the road, they saw camps and\ncamps. They left behind the parks of munitions, passed the third line\nof troops, and then the second. Thousands and thousands of men were\nbivouacking there in the open, improvising as best they could their\nhabitations. These human ant-hills seemed vaguely to recall, with the\nvariety of uniforms and races, some of the mighty invasions of history;\nbut it was not a nation en marche. The exodus of people takes with it\nthe women and children. Here there were nothing but men, men everywhere.\n\nAll kinds of housing ever used by humanity were here utilized, these\nmilitary assemblages beginning with the cave. Caverns and quarries were\nserving as barracks. Some low huts recalled the American ranch; others,\nhigh and conical, were facsimiles of the gurbi of Africa. Many of the\nsoldiers had come from the colonies; some had been living as business\nmen in the new world, and upon having to provide a house more stable\nthan the canvas tent, had recalled the architecture of the tribes with\nwhich they had had dealings. In this conglomerate of combatants, there\nwere also Moors, blacks and Asiatics who were accustomed to live outside\nthe cities and had acquired in the open a physical superiority which\nmade them more masterful than the civilized peoples.\n\nNear the river beds was flapping white clothing hung out to dry. Rows of\nmen with bared breasts were out in the morning freshness, leaning\nover the streams, washing themselves with noisy ablutions followed by\nvigorous rubbings. . . . On a bridge was a soldier writing, utilizing\na parapet as a table. . . . The cooks were moving around their savory\nkettles, and a warm exhalation of morning soup was mixed with the\nresinous perfume of the trees and the smell of the damp earth.\n\nLong, low barracks of wood and zinc served the cavalry and artillery for\ntheir animals and stores. In the open air, the soldiers were currying\nand shoeing the glossy, plump horses which the trench-war was\nmaintaining in placid obesity.\n\n\"If they had only been like that at the battle of the Marne!\" sighed\nDesnoyers to his friend.\n\nNow the cavalry was leading an existence of interminable rest. The\ntroopers were fighting on foot, and finding it necessary to exercise\ntheir steeds to keep them from getting sick with their full mangers.\n\nThere were spread over the fields several aeroplanes, like great, gray\ndragon flies, poised for the flight. Many of the men were grouped around\nthem. The farmers, transformed into soldiers, were watching with great\nadmiration their comrade charged with the management of these machines.\nThey looked upon him as one of the wizards so venerated and feared in\nall the countryside.\n\nDon Marcelo was struck by the general transformation in the French\nuniforms. All were now clad in gray-blue, from head to foot. The\ntrousers of bright scarlet cloth, the red kepis which he had hailed with\nsuch joy in the expedition of the Marne, no longer existed. All the\nmen passing along the roads were soldiers. All the vehicles, even the\nox-carts, were guided by military men.\n\nSuddenly the automobile stopped before some ruined houses blackened by\nfire.\n\n\"Here we are,\" announced the official. \"Now we shall have to walk a\nlittle.\"\n\nThe senator and his friend started along the highway.\n\n\"Not that way, no!\" the guide turned to say grimly. \"That road is bad\nfor the health. We must keep out of the currents of air.\"\n\nHe further explained that the Germans had their cannon and intrenchments\nat the end of this highroad which sloped suddenly and again appeared as\na white ribbon on the horizon line between two rows of trees and burned\nhouses. The pale morning light with its hazy mist was sheltering them\nfrom the enemy's fire. On a sunny day, the arrival of their automobile\nwould have been saluted with a shell. \"That is war,\" he concluded. \"One\nis always near to death without seeing it.\"\n\nThe two recalled the warning of the general with whom they had dined the\nday before: \"Be very careful! The war of the trenches is treacherous.\"\n\nIn the sweep of plains unrolled before them, not a man was visible. It\nseemed like a country Sunday, when the farmers are in their homes, and\nthe land scene lying in silent meditation. Some shapeless objects could\nbe seen in the fields, like agricultural implements deserted for a day\nof rest. Perhaps they were broken automobiles, or artillery carriages\ndestroyed by the force of their volleys.\n\n\"This way,\" said the officer who had added four soldiers to the party to\ncarry the various bags and packages which Desnoyers had brought out on\nthe roof of the automobile.\n\nThey proceeded in a single file the length of a wall of blackened\nbricks, down a steep hill. After a few steps the surface of the ground\nwas about to their knees; further on, up to their waists, and thus they\ndisappeared within the earth, seeing above their heads, only a narrow\nstrip of sky. They were now under the open field, having left behind\nthem the mass of ruins that hid the entrance of the road. They were\nadvancing in an absurd way, as though they scorned direct lines--in\nzig-zags, in curves, in angles. Other pathways, no less complicated,\nbranched off from this ditch which was the central avenue of an immense\nsubterranean cavity. They walked . . . and walked . . . and walked.\nA quarter of an hour went by, a half, an entire hour. Lacour and his\nfriend thought longingly of the roadways flanked with trees, of their\ntramp in the open air where they could see the sky and meadows. They\nwere not going twenty steps in the same direction. The official marching\nahead was every moment vanishing around a new bend. Those who were\ncoming behind were panting and talking unseen, having to quicken their\nsteps in order not to lose sight of the party. Every now and then they\nhad to halt in order to unite and count the little band, to make sure\nthat no one had been lost in a transverse gallery. The ground was\nexceedingly slippery, in some places almost liquid mud, white and\ncaustic like the drip from the scaffolding of a house in the course of\nconstruction.\n\nThe thump of their footsteps, and the friction of their shoulders,\nbrought down chunks of earth and smooth stones from the sides. Little by\nlittle they climbed through the main artery of this underground body and\nthe veins connected with it. Again they were near the surface where it\nrequired but little effort to see the blue above the earth-works. But\nhere the fields were uncultivated, surrounded with wire fences, yet with\nthe same appearance of Sabbath calm. Knowing by sad experience, what\ncuriosity oftentimes cost, the official would not permit them to linger\nhere. \"Keep right ahead! Forward march!\"\n\nFor an hour and a half the party kept doggedly on until the senior\nmembers became greatly bewildered and fatigued by their serpentine\nmeanderings. They could no longer tell whether they were advancing or\nreceding, the sudden steeps and the continual turning bringing on an\nattack of vertigo.\n\n\"Have we much further to go?\" asked the senator.\n\n\"There!\" responded the guide pointing to some heaps of earth above them.\n\"There\" was a bell tower surrounded by a few charred houses that could\nbe seen a long ways off--the remains of a hamlet which had been taken\nand retaken by both sides.\n\nBy going in a direct line on the surface they would have compassed\nthis distance in half an hour. To the angles of the underground road,\narranged to impede the advance of an enemy, there had been added the\nobstacles of campaign fortification, tunnels cut with wire lattice work,\nlarge hanging cages of wire which, on falling, could block the passage\nand enable the defenders to open fire across their gratings.\n\nThey began to meet soldiers with packs and pails of water who were soon\nlost in the tortuous cross roads. Some, seated on piles of wood, were\nsmiling as they read a little periodical published in the trenches.\n\nThe soldiers stepped aside to make way for the visiting procession,\nbearded and curious faces peeping out of the alleyways. Afar off sounded\na crackling of short snaps as though at the end of the winding lanes\nwere a shooting lodge where a group of sportsmen were killing pigeons.\n\nThe morning was still cloudy and cold. In spite of the humid atmosphere,\na buzzing like that of a horsefly, hummed several times above the two\nvisitors.\n\n\"Bullets!\" said their conductor laconically.\n\nDesnoyers meanwhile had lowered his head a little, he knew perfectly\nwell that insectivorous sound. The senator walked on more briskly,\ntemporarily forgetting his weariness.\n\nThey came to a halt before a lieutenant-colonel who received them like\nan engineer exhibiting his workshops, like a naval officer showing off\nthe batteries and turrets of his battleships. He was the Chief of the\nbattalion occupying this section of the trenches. Don Marcelo studied\nhim with special interest, knowing that his son was under his orders.\n\nTo the two friends, these subterranean fortifications bore a certain\nresemblance to the lower parts of a vessel. They passed from trench\nto trench of the last line, the oldest--dark galleries into which\npenetrated streaks of light across the loopholes and broad, low windows\nof the mitrailleuse. The long line of defense formed a tunnel cut by\nshort, open spaces. They had to go stumbling from light to darkness, and\nfrom darkness to light with a visual suddenness very fatiguing to\nthe eyes. The ground was higher in the open spaces. There were wooden\nbenches placed against the sides so that the observers could put out the\nhead or examine the landscape by means of the periscope. The enclosed\nspace answered both for batteries and sleeping quarters.\n\nAs the enemy had been repelled and more ground had been gained, the\ncombatants who had been living all winter in these first quarters, had\ntried to make themselves more comfortable. Over the trenches in the open\nair, they had laid beams from the ruined houses; over the beams, planks,\ndoors and windows, and on top of the wood, layers of sacks of earth.\nThese sacks were covered by a top of fertile soil from which sprouted\ngrass and herbs, giving the roofs of the trenches, an appearance of\npastoral placidity. The temporary arches could thus resist the shock\nof the abuses which went ploughing into the earth without causing any\nspecial damage. When an explosion was pounding too noisily and weakening\nthe structure, the troglodytes would swarm out in the night like\nwatchful ants, and skilfully readjust the roof of their primitive\ndwellings.\n\nEverything appeared clean with that simple and rather clumsy cleanliness\nexercised by men living far from women and thrown upon their own\nresources. The galleries were something like the cloisters of a\nmonastery, the corridors of a prison, and the middle sections of a ship.\nTheir floors were a half yard lower than that of the open spaces which\njoined the trenches together. In order that the officers might avoid\nso many ups and downs, some planks had been laid, forming a sort of\nscaffolding from doorway to doorway.\n\nUpon the approach of their Chief, the soldiers formed themselves in\nline, their heads being on a level with the waist of those passing over\nthe planks. Desnoyers ran his eye hungrily over the file of men. Where\ncould Julio be? . . .\n\nHe noticed the individual contour of the different redoubts. They\nall seemed to have been constructed in about the same way, but their\noccupants had modified them with their special personal decorations.\nThe exteriors were always cut with loopholes in which there were\nguns pointed toward the enemy, and windows for the mitrailleuses. The\nwatchers near these openings were looking over the lonely landscape\nlike quartermasters surveying the sea from the bridge. Within were the\narmories and the sleeping rooms--three rows of berths made with planks\nlike the beds of seamen. The desire for artistic ornamentation which\neven the simplest souls always feel, had led to the embellishment of\nthe underground dwellings. Each soldier had a private museum made with\nprints from the papers and colored postcards. Photographs of soubrettes\nand dancers with their painted mouths smiled from the shiny cardboard,\nenlivening the chaste aspect of the redoubt.\n\nDon Marcelo was growing more and more impatient at seeing so many\nhundreds of men, but no Julio. The senator, complying with his imploring\nglance, spoke a few words to the chief preceding him with an aspect of\ngreat deference. The official had at first to think very hard to\nrecall Julio to mind, but he soon remembered the exploits of Sergeant\nDesnoyers. \"An excellent soldier,\" he said. \"He will be sent for\nimmediately, Senator Lacour. . . . He is on duty now with his section in\nthe first line trenches.\"\n\nThe father, in his anxiety to see him, proposed that they betake\nthemselves to that advanced site, but his petition made the Chief and\nthe others smile. Those open trenches within a hundred or fifty yards\nfrom the enemy, with no other defence but barbed wire and sacks of\nearth, were not for the visits of civilians. They were always filled\nwith mud; the visitors would have to crawl around exposed to bullets and\nunder the dropping chunks of earth loosened by the shells. None but the\ncombatants could get around in these outposts.\n\n\"It is always dangerous there,\" said the Chief. \"There is always random\nshooting. . . . Just listen to the firing!\"\n\nDesnoyers indeed perceived a distant crackling that he had not noted\nbefore, and he felt an added anguish at the thought that his son must be\nin the thick of it. Realization of the dangers to which he must be daily\nexposed, now stood forth in high relief. What if he should die in the\nintervening moments, before he could see him? . . .\n\nTime dragged by with desperate sluggishness for Don Marcelo. It seemed\nto him that the messenger who had been despatched for him would never\narrive. He paid scarcely any attention to the affairs which the Chief\nwas so courteously showing them--the caverns which served the soldiers\nas toilet rooms and bathrooms of most primitive arrangement, the cave\nwith the sign, \"Cafe de la Victoire,\" another in fanciful lettering,\n\"Theatre.\" . . . Lacour was taking a lively interest in all this,\nlauding the French gaiety which laughs and sings in the presence of\ndanger, while his friend continued brooding about Julio. When would he\never see him?\n\nThey stopped near one of the embrasures of a machine-gun position\nstationing themselves at the recommendations of the soldiers, on both\nsides of the horizontal opening, keeping their bodies well back, but\nputting their heads far enough forward to look out with one eye. They\nsaw a very deep excavation and the opposite edge of ground. A short\ndistance away were several rows of X's of wood united by barbed wire,\nforming a compact fence. About three hundred feet further on, was a\nsecond wire fence. There reigned a profound silence here, a silence of\nabsolute loneliness as though the world was asleep.\n\n\"There are the trenches of the Boches,\" said the Commandant, in a low\ntone.\n\n\"Where?\" asked the senator, making an effort to see.\n\nThe Chief pointed to the second wire fence which Lacour and his friend\nhad supposed belonged to the French. It was the German intrenchment\nline.\n\n\"We are only a hundred yards away from them,\" he continued, \"but for\nsome time they have not been attacking from this side.\"\n\nThe visitors were greatly moved at learning that the foe was such a\nshort distance off, hidden in the ground in a mysterious invisibility\nwhich made it all the more terrible. What if they should pop out now\nwith their saw-edged bayonets, fire-breathing liquids and asphyxiating\nbombs to assault this stronghold! . . .\n\nFrom this window they could observe more clearly the intensity of the\nfiring on the outer line. The shots appeared to be coming nearer. The\nCommandant brusquely ordered them to leave their observatory, fearing\nthat the fire might become general. The soldiers, with their customary\npromptitude, without receiving any orders, approached their guns which\nwere in horizontal position, pointing through the loopholes.\n\nAgain the visitors walked in single file, going down into cavernous\nspaces that had been the old wine-cellars of former houses. The officers\nhad taken up their abode in these dens, utilizing all the residue of\nthe ruins. A street door on two wooden horses served as a table;\nthe ceilings and walls were covered with cretonnes from the Paris\nwarehouses; photographs of women and children adorned the side wall\nbetween the nickeled glitter of telegraphic and telephonic instruments.\n\nDesnoyers saw above one door an ivory crucifix, yellowed with years,\nprobably with centuries, transmitted from generation to generation, that\nmust have witnessed many agonies of soul. In another den he noticed in\na conspicuous place, a horseshoe with seven holes. Religious creeds\nwere spreading their wings very widely in this atmosphere of danger and\ndeath, and yet at the same time, the most grotesque superstitions were\nacquiring new values without any one laughing at them.\n\nUpon leaving one of the cells, in the middle of an open space, the\nyearning father met his son. He knew that it must be Julio by the\nChief's gesture and because the smiling soldier was coming toward him,\nholding out his hands; but this time his paternal instinct which he had\nheretofore considered an infallible thing, had given him no warning. How\ncould he recognize Julio in that sergeant whose feet were two cakes of\nmoist earth, whose faded cloak was a mass of tatters covered with mud,\neven up to the shoulders, smelling of damp wool and leather? . . . After\nthe first embrace, he drew back his head in order to get a good look at\nhim without letting go of him. His olive pallor had turned to a bronze\ntone. He was growing a beard, a beard black and curly, which reminded\nDon Marcelo of his father-in-law. The centaur, Madariaga, had certainly\ncome to life in this warrior hardened by camping in the open air. At\nfirst, the father grieved over his dirty and tired aspect, but a second\nglance made him sure that he was now far more handsome and interesting\nthan in his days of society glory.\n\n\"What do you need? . . . What do you want?\"\n\nHis voice was trembling with tenderness. He was speaking to the tanned\nand robust combatant in the same tone that he was wont to use twenty\nyears ago when, holding the child by the hand, he had halted before the\npreserve cupboards of Buenos Aires.\n\n\"Would you like money? . . .\"\n\nHe had brought a large sum with him to give to his son, but the soldier\ngave a shrug of indifference as though he had offered him a plaything.\nHe had never been so rich as at this moment; he had a lot of money in\nParis and he didn't know what to do with it--he didn't need anything.\n\n\"Send me some cigars . . . for me and my comrades.\"\n\nHe was constantly receiving from his mother great baskets full of choice\ngoodies, tobacco and clothing. But he never kept anything; all was\npassed on to his fellow-warriors, sons of poor families or alone in the\nworld. His munificence had spread from his intimates to the company,\nand from that to the entire battalion. Don Marcelo divined his great\npopularity in the glances and smiles of the soldiers passing near them.\nHe was the generous son of a millionaire, and this popularity seemed to\ninclude even him when the news went around that the father of Sergeant\nDesnoyers had arrived--a potentate who possessed fabulous wealth on the\nother side of the sea.\n\n\"I guessed that you would want cigars,\" chuckled the old man.\n\nAnd his gaze sought the bags brought from the automobile through the\nwindings of the underground road.\n\nAll of the son's valorous deeds, extolled and magnified by Argensola,\nnow came trooping into his mind. He had the original hero before his\nvery eyes.\n\n\"Are you content, satisfied? . . . You do not repent of your decision?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am content, father . . . very content.\"\n\nJulio spoke without boasting, modestly. His life was very hard, but just\nlike that of millions of other men. In his section of a few dozens\nof soldiers there were many superior to him in intelligence, in\nstudiousness, in character; but they were all courageously undergoing\nthe test, experiencing the satisfaction of duty fulfilled. The common\ndanger was helping to develop the noblest virtues of these men. Never,\nin times of peace, had he known such comradeship. What magnificent\nsacrifices he had witnessed!\n\n\"When all this is over, men will be better . . . more generous. Those\nwho survive will do great things.\"\n\nYes, of course, he was content. For the first time in his life he was\ntasting the delights of knowing that he was a useful being, that he\nwas good for something, that his passing through the world would not be\nfruitless. He recalled with pity that Desnoyers who had not known how to\noccupy his empty life, and had filled it with every kind of frivolity.\nNow he had obligations that were taxing all his powers; he was\ncollaborating in the formation of a future. He was a man at last!\n\n\"I am content,\" he repeated with conviction.\n\nHis father believed him, yet he fancied that, in a corner of that\nfrank glance, he detected something sorrowful, a memory of a past which\nperhaps often forced its way among his present emotions. There flitted\nthrough his mind the lovely figure of Madame Laurier. Her charm was,\ndoubtless, still haunting his son. And to think that he could not bring\nher here! . . . The austere father of the preceding year contemplated\nhimself with astonishment as he caught himself formulating this immoral\nregret.\n\nThey passed a quarter of an hour without loosening hands, looking\ninto each other's eyes. Julio asked after his mother and Chichi. He\nfrequently received letters from them, but that was not enough for his\ncuriosity. He laughed heartily at hearing of Argensola's amplified and\nabundant life. These interesting bits of news came from a world not much\nmore than sixty miles distant in a direct line . . . but so far, so very\nfar away!\n\nSuddenly the father noticed that his boy was listening with less\nattention. His senses, sharpened by a life of alarms and ambushed\nattacks, appeared to be withdrawing itself from the company, attracted\nby the firing. Those were no longer scattered shots; they had combined\ninto a continual crackling.\n\nThe senator, who had left father and son together that they might talk\nmore freely, now reappeared.\n\n\"We are dismissed from here, my friend,\" he announced. \"We have no luck\nin our visits.\"\n\nSoldiers were no longer passing to and fro. All had hastened to their\nposts, like the crew of a ship which clears for action. While Julio was\ntaking up the rifle which he had left against the wall, a bit of dust\nwhirled above his father's head and a little hole appeared in the\nground.\n\n\"Quick, get out of here!\" he said pushing Don Marcelo.\n\nThen, in the shelter of a covered trench, came the nervous, very brief\nfarewell. \"Good-bye, father,\" a kiss, and he was gone. He had to return\nas quickly as possible to the side of his men.\n\nThe firing had become general all along the line. The soldiers were\nshooting serenely, as though fulfilling an ordinary function. It was a\ncombat that took place every day without anybody's knowing exactly who\nstarted it--in consequence of the two armies being installed face to\nface, and such a short distance apart. . . . The Chief of the battalion\nwas also obliged to desert his guests, fearing a counter-attack.\n\nAgain the officer charged with their safe conduct put himself at the\nhead of the file, and they began to retrace their steps through\nthe slippery maze. Desnoyers was tramping sullenly on, angry at the\nintervention of the enemy which had cut short his happiness.\n\nBefore his inward gaze fluttered the vision of Julio with his black,\ncurly beard which to him was the greatest novelty of the trip. He heard\nagain his grave voice, that of a man who has taken up life from a new\nviewpoint.\n\n\"I am content, father . . . I am content.\"\n\nThe firing, growing constantly more distant, gave the father great\nuneasiness. Then he felt an instinctive faith, absurd, very firm. He\nsaw his son beautiful and immortal as a god. He had a conviction that he\nwould come out safe and sound from all dangers. That others should die\nwas but natural, but Julio! . . .\n\nAs they got further and further away from the soldier boy, Hope appeared\nto be singing in his ears; and as an echo of his pleasing musings, the\nfather kept repeating mentally:\n\n\"No one will kill him. My heart which never deceives me, tells me so.\n. . . No one will kill him!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\"NO ONE WILL KILL HIM\"\n\n\nFour months later, Don Marcelo's confidence received a rude shock. Julio\nwas wounded. But at the same time that Lacour bought him this news,\nlamentably delayed, he tranquilized him with the result of his\ninvestigations in the war ministry. Sergeant Desnoyers was now\na sub-lieutenant, his wound was almost healed and, thanks to the\nwire-pulling of the senator, he was coming to pass a fortnight with his\nfamily while convalescing.\n\n\"An exceptionally brave fellow,\" concluded the influential man. \"I\nhave read what his chiefs say about him. At the head of his platoon, he\nattacked a German company; he killed the captain with his own hand; he\ndid I don't know how many more brave things besides. . . . They have\npresented him with the military medal and have made him an officer.\n. . . A regular hero!\"\n\nAnd the rapidly aging father, weeping with emotion, but with increasing\nenthusiasm, shook his head and trembled. He repented now of his\nmomentary lack of faith when the first news of his wounded boy reached\nhim. How absurd! . . . No one would kill Julio; his heart told him so.\n\nSoon after, he saw him coming home amid the cries and delighted\nexclamations of the women. Poor Dona Luisa wept as she embraced him,\nhanging on his neck with sobs of emotion. Chichi contemplated him with\ngrave reflection, putting half of her mind on the recent arrival while\nthe rest flew far away in search of the other warrior. The dusky,\nSouth American maids fought each other for the opening in the curtains,\npeering through the crack with the gaze of an antelope.\n\nThe father admired the little scrap of gold on the sleeve of the gray\ncloak, with the skirts buttoning behind, examining afterwards the dark\nblue cap with its low brim, adopted by the French for the war in the\ntrenches. The traditional kepi had disappeared. A suitable visor, like\nthat of the men in the Spanish infantry, now shadowed Julio's face. Don\nMarcelo noted, too, the short and well-cared-for beard, very different\nfrom the one he had seen in the trenches. The boy was coming home,\ngroomed and polished from his recent stay in the hospital.\n\n\"Isn't it true that he looks like me?\" queried the old man proudly.\n\nDona Luisa responded with the inconsequence that mothers always show in\nmatters of resemblance.\n\n\"He has always been the living image of you!\"\n\nHaving made sure that he was well and happy, the entire family suddenly\nfelt a certain disquietude. They wished to examine his wound so as to\nconvince themselves that he was completely out of danger.\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing at all,\" protested the sub-lieutenant. \"A bullet wound\nin the shoulder. The doctor feared at first that I might lose my left\narm, but it has healed well and it isn't worth while to think any more\nabout it.\"\n\nChichi's appraising glance swept Julio from head to foot; taking in all\nthe details of his military elegance. His cloak was worn thin and dirty;\nthe leggings were spatter-dashed with mud; he smelled of leather, sweaty\ncloth and strong tobacco; but on one wrist he was wearing a watch, and\non the other, his identity medal fastened with a gold chain. She had\nalways admired her brother for his natural good taste, so she stowed\naway all these little details in her memory in order to pass them on to\nRene. Then she surprised her mother with a demand for a loan that she\nmight send a little gift to her artilleryman.\n\nDon Marcelo gloated over the fifteen days of satisfaction ahead of him.\nSub-lieutenant Desnoyers found it impossible to go out alone, for his\nfather was always pacing up and down the reception hall before the\nmilitary cap which was shedding modest splendor and glory upon the hat\nrack. Scarcely had Julio put it on his head before his sire appeared,\nalso with hat and cane, ready to sally forth.\n\n\"Will you permit me to accompany you? . . . I will not bother you.\"\n\nThis would be said so humbly, with such an evident desire to have his\nrequest granted, that his son had not the heart to refuse him. In order\nto take a walk with Argensola, he had to scurry down the back stairs, or\nresort to other schoolboy tricks.\n\nNever had the elder Desnoyers promenaded the streets of Paris with\nsuch solid satisfaction as by the side of this muscular youth in\nhis gloriously worn cloak, on whose breast were glistening his two\ndecorations--the cross of war and the military medal. He was a hero,\nand this hero was his son. He accepted as homage to them both the\nsympathetic glances of the public in the street cars and subways. The\ninterest with which the women regarded the fine-looking youth tickled\nhim immensely. All the other military men that they met, no matter how\nmany bands and crosses they displayed, appeared to the doting father\nmere embusques, unworthy of comparison with his Julio. . . . The\nwounded men who got out of the coaches by the aid of staffs and crutches\ninspired him with the greatest pity. Poor fellows! . . . They did not\nbear the charmed life of his son. Nobody could kill him; and when, by\nchance, he had received a wound, the scars had immediately disappeared\nwithout detriment to his handsome person.\n\nSometimes, especially at night, Desnoyers senior would show an\nunexpected magnanimity, letting Julio fare forth alone. Since before the\nwar, his son had led a life filled with triumphant love-affairs, what\nmight he not achieve now with the added prestige of a distinguished\nofficer! . . .\n\nPassing through his room on his way to bed, the father imagined the hero\nin the charming company of some aristocratic lady. None but a feminine\ncelebrity was worthy of him; his paternal pride could accept nothing\nless. . . . And it never occurred to him that Julio might be with\nArgensola in a music-hall or in a moving-picture show, enjoying the\nsimple and monotonous diversions of a Paris sobered by war, with the\nhomely tastes of a sub-lieutenant whose amorous conquests were no more\nthan the renewal of some old friendships.\n\nOne evening as Don Marcelo was accompanying his son down the Champs\nElysees, he started at recognizing a lady approaching from the opposite\ndirection. It was Madame Laurier. . . . Would she recognize Julio? He\nnoted that the youth turned pale and began looking at the other people\nwith feigned interest. She continued straight ahead, erect, unseeing.\nThe old gentleman was almost irritated at such coldness. To pass by his\nson without feeling his presence instinctively! Ah, these women! . . .\nHe turned his head involuntarily to look after her, but had to avert his\ninquisitive glance immediately. He had surprised Marguerite motionless\nbehind them, pallid with surprise, and fixing her gaze earnestly on the\nsoldier who was separating himself from her. Don Marcelo read in her\neyes admiration, love, all of the past that was suddenly surging up in\nher memory. Poor woman! . . . He felt for her a paternal affection as\nthough she were the wife of Julio. His friend Lacour had again spoken\nto him about the Lauriers. He knew that Marguerite was going to become a\nmother, and the old man, without taking into account the reconciliation\nnor the passage of time, felt as much moved at the thought of this\napproaching maternity as though the child were going to be Julio's.\n\nMeanwhile Julio was marching right on, without turning his head, without\nbeing conscious of the burning gaze fixed upon him, colorless, but\nhumming a tune to hide his emotion. He always believed that Marguerite\nhad passed near him without recognizing him, since his father did not\nbetray her.\n\nOne of Don Marcelo's pet occupations was to make his son tell about the\nencounter in which he had been hurt. No visitor ever came to see the\nsub-lieutenant but the father always made the same petition.\n\n\"Tell us how you were wounded. . . . Explain how you killed that German\ncaptain.\"\n\nJulio tried to excuse himself with visible annoyance. He was already\nsurfeited with his own history. To please his father, he had related the\nfacts to the senator, to Argensola and to Tchernoff in his studio, and\nto other family friends. . . . He simply could not do it again.\n\nSo the father began the narration on his own account, giving the relief\nand details of the deed as though seen with his own eyes. . . .\n\nHe had to take possession of the ruins of a sugar refinery in front\nof the trench. The Germans had been expelled by the French cannon.\nA reconnoitring survey under the charge of a trusty man was then\nnecessary. And the heads, as usual, had selected Sergeant Desnoyers.\n\nAt daybreak, the platoon had advanced stealthily without encountering\nany difficulty. The soldiers scattered among the ruins. Julio then went\non alone, examining the positions of the enemy; on turning around a\ncorner of the wall, he had the most unexpected of encounters. A German\ncaptain was standing in front of him. They had almost bumped into each\nother. They looked into each other's eyes with more suspense than hate,\nyet at the same time, they were trying instinctively to kill each other,\neach one trying to get the advantage by his swiftness. The captain\nhad dropped the map that he was carrying. His right hand sought his\nrevolver, trying to draw it from its case without once taking his eyes\noff his enemy. Then he had to give this up as useless--it was too late.\nWith his eyes distended by the proximity of death, he kept his gaze\nfixed upon the Frenchman who had raised his gun to his face. A shot,\nfrom a barrel almost touching him . . . and the German fell dead.\n\nNot till then did the victor notice the captain's orderly who was but a\nfew steps behind. He shot Desnoyers, wounding him in the shoulder. The\nFrench hurried to the spot, killing the corporal. Then there was a sharp\ncross-fire with the enemy's company which had halted a little ways off\nwhile their commander was exploring the ground. Julio, in spite of\nhis wound, continued at the head of his section, defending the factory\nagainst superior forces until supports arrived, and the land remained\ndefinitely in the power of the French.\n\n\"Wasn't that about the way of it?\" Don Marcelo would always wind up.\n\nThe son assented, desirous that his annoyance with the persistent story\nshould come to an end as soon as possible. Yes, that was the way of it.\nBut what the father didn't know, what Julio would never tell, was the\ndiscovery that he had made after killing the captain.\n\nThe two men, during the interminable second in which they had confronted\neach other, had showed in their eyes something more than the surprise\nof an encounter, and the wish to overcome the other. Desnoyers knew that\nman. The captain knew him, too. He guessed it from his expression. . . .\nBut self-preservation was more insistent than recollection and prevented\nthem both from co-ordinating their thoughts.\n\nDesnoyers had fired with the certainty that he was killing someone that\nhe knew. Afterwards, while directing the defense of the position and\nguarding against the approach of reinforcements, he had a suspicion that\nthe enemy whose corpse was lying a few feet away might possibly be a\nmember of the von Hartrott family. No, he looked much older than his\ncousins, yet younger than his Uncle Karl who at his age, would be no\nmere captain of infantry.\n\nWhen, weakened by the loss of blood, they were about to carry him to\nthe trenches, the sergeant expressed a wish to see again the body of\nhis victim. His doubt continued before the face blanched by death. The\nwide-open eyes still seemed to retain their startled expression. The man\nhad undoubtedly recognized him. His face was familiar. Who was he? . . .\nSuddenly in his mind's eye, Julio saw the heaving ocean, a great\nsteamer, a tall, blonde woman looking at him with half-closed eyes of\ninvitation, a corpulent, moustached man making speeches in the style of\nthe Kaiser. \"Rest in peace, Captain Erckmann!\" . . . Thus culminated in\na corner of France the discussions started at table in mid-ocean.\n\nHe excused himself mentally as though he were in the presence of the\nsweet Bertha. He had had to kill, in order not to be killed. Such is\nwar. He tried to console himself by thinking that Erckmann, perhaps,\nhad failed to identify him, without realizing that his slayer was the\nshipmate of the summer. . . . And he kept carefully hidden in the depths\nof his memory this encounter arranged by Fate. He did not even tell\nArgensola who knew of the incidents of the trans-atlantic passage.\n\nWhen he least expected it, Don Marcelo found himself at the end of that\ndelightful and proud existence which his son's presence had brought him.\nThe fortnight had flown by so swiftly! The sub-lieutenant had returned\nto his post, and all the family, after this period of reality, had\nhad to fall back on the fond illusions of hope, watching again for the\narrival of his letters, making conjectures about the silence of the\nabsent one, sending him packet after packet of everything that the\nmarket was offering for the soldiery--for the most part, useless and\nabsurd things.\n\nThe mother became very despondent. Julio's visit home but made her feel\nhis absence with greater intensity. Seeing him, hearing those tales of\ndeath that her husband was so fond of repeating, made her realize all\nthe more clearly the dangers constantly surrounding her son. Fatality\nappeared to be warning her with funereal presentiments.\n\n\"They are going to kill him,\" she kept saying to Desnoyers. \"That wound\nwas a forewarning from heaven.\"\n\nWhen passing through the streets, she trembled with emotion at sight of\nthe invalid soldiers. The convalescents of energetic appearance, filled\nher with the greatest pity. They made her think of a certain trip with\nher husband to San Sebastian where a bull fight had made her cry out\nwith indignation and compassion, pitying the fate of the poor, gored\nhorses. With entrails hanging, they were taken to the corrals, and\nsubmitted to a hurried adjustment in order that they might return to the\narena stimulated by a false energy. Again and again they were reduced to\nthis makeshift cobbling until finally a fatal goring finished them.\n. . . These recently cured men continually brought to her mind those poor\nbeasts. Some had been wounded three times since the beginning of the\nwar, and were returning surgically patched together and re-galvanized to\ntake another chance in the lottery of Fate, always in the expectation of\nthe supreme blow. . . . Ay, her son!\n\nDesnoyers waxed very indignant over his wife's low spirits, retorting:\n\n\"But I tell you that Nobody will kill Julio! . . . He is my son. In my\nyouth I, too, passed through great dangers. They wounded me, too, in the\nwars in the other world, and nevertheless, here I am at a ripe old age.\"\n\nEvents seemed to reinforce his blind faith. Calamities were raining\naround the family and saddening his relatives, yet not one grazed the\nintrepid sub-lieutenant who was persisting in his daring deeds with the\nheroic nerve of a musketeer.\n\nDona Luisa received a letter from Germany. Her sister wrote from Berlin,\ntransmitting her letters through the kindness of a South American in\nSwitzerland. This time, the good lady wept for some one besides her son;\nshe wept for Elena and the enemies. In Germany there were mothers, too,\nand she put the sentiment of maternity above all patriotic differences.\n\nPoor Frau von Hartrott! Her letter written a month before, had contained\nnothing but death notices and words of despair. Captain Otto was dead.\nDead, too, was one of his younger brothers. The fact that the latter\nhad fallen in a territory dominated by their nation, at least gave the\nmother the sad comfort of being able to weep near his grave. But the\nCaptain was buried on French soil, nobody knew where, and she would\nnever be able to find his remains, mingled with hundreds of others.\nA third son was wounded in Poland. Her two daughters had lost their\npromised lovers, and the sight of their silent grief, was intensifying\nthe mother's suffering. Von Hartrott continued presiding over patriotic\nsocieties and making plans of expansion after the near victory, but he\nhad aged greatly in the last few months. The \"sage\" was the only one\nstill holding his own. The family afflictions were aggravating the\nferocity of Professor Julius von Hartrott. He was calculating, in a book\nhe was writing, the hundreds of thousands of millions that Germany must\nexact after her triumph, and the various nations that she would have to\nannex to the Fatherland.\n\nDona Luisa imagined that in the avenue Victor Hugo, she could hear the\nmother's tears falling in her home in Berlin. \"You will understand,\nLuisa, my despair. . . . We were all so happy! May God punish those\nwho have brought such sorrow on the world! The Emperor is innocent. His\nadversaries are to blame for it all . . .\"\n\nDon Marcelo was silent about the letter in his wife's presence. He\npitied Elena for her losses, so he overlooked her political connections.\nHe was touched, too, at Dona Luisa's distress about Otto. She had been\nhis godmother and Desnoyers his godfather. That was so--Don Marcelo had\nforgotten all about it; and the fact recalled to his mental vision the\nplacid life of the ranch, and the play of the blonde children that he\nhad petted behind their grandfather's back, before Julio was born. For\nmany years, he had lavished great affection on these youngsters, when\ndismayed at Julio's delayed arrival. He was really affected at thinking\nof what must be Karl's despair.\n\nBut then, as soon as he was alone, a selfish coldness would blot out\nthis compassion. War was war, and the Germans had sought it. France had\nto defend herself, and the more enemies fell the better. . . . The only\nsoldier who interested him now was Julio. And his faith in the destiny\nof his son made him feel a brutal joy, a paternal satisfaction almost\namounting to ferocity.\n\n\"No one will kill HIM! . . . My heart tells me so.\"\n\nA nearer trouble shook his peace of mind. When he returned to his home\none evening, he found Dona Luisa with a terrified aspect holding her\nhands to her head.\n\n\"The daughter, Marcelo . . . our daughter!\"\n\nChichi was stretched out on a sofa in the salon, pale, with an olive\ntinge, looking fixedly ahead of her as if she could see somebody in the\nempty air. She was not crying, but a slight palpitation was making her\nswollen eyes tremble spasmodically.\n\n\"I want to see him,\" she was saying hoarsely. \"I must see him!\"\n\nThe father conjectured that something terrible must have happened to\nLacour's son. That was the only thing that could make Chichi show such\ndesperation. His wife was telling him the sad news. Rene was wounded,\nvery seriously wounded. A shell had exploded over his battery, killing\nmany of his comrades. The young officer had been dragged out from a\nmountain of dead, one hand was gone, he had injuries in the legs, chest\nand head.\n\n\"I've got to see him!\" reiterated Chichi.\n\nAnd Don Marcelo had to concentrate all his efforts in making his\ndaughter give up this dolorous insistence which made her exact an\nimmediate journey to the front, trampling down all obstacles, in order\nto reach her wounded lover. The senator finally convinced her of the\nuselessness of it all. She would simply have to wait; he, the father,\nhad to be patient. He was negotiating for Rene to be transferred to a\nhospital in Paris.\n\nThe great man moved Desnoyers to pity. He was making such heroic efforts\nto preserve the stoic serenity of ancient days by recalling his glorious\nancestors and all the illustrious figures of the Roman Republic. But\nthese oratorical illusions had suddenly fallen flat, and his old friend\nsurprised him weeping more than once. An only child, and he might\nhave to lose him! . . . Chichi's dumb woe made him feel even greater\ncommiseration. Her grief was without tears or faintings. Her sallow\nface, the feverish brilliancy of her eyes, and the rigidity that made\nher move like an automaton were the only signs of her emotion. She was\nliving with her thoughts far away, with no knowledge of what was going\non around her.\n\nWhen the patient arrived in Paris, his father and fiancee were\ntransfigured. They were going to see him, and that was enough to make\nthem imagine that he was already recuperated.\n\nChichi hastened to the hospital with her mother and the senator. Then\nshe went alone and insisted on remaining there, on living at the wounded\nman's side, waging war on all regulations and clashing with Sisters\nof Charity, trained nurses, and all who roused in her the hatred of\nrivalry. Soon realizing that all her violence accomplished nothing, she\nhumiliated herself and became suddenly very submissive, trying with her\nwiles, to win the women over one by one. Finally, she was permitted to\nspend the greater part of the day with Rene.\n\nWhen Desnoyers first saw the wounded artilleryman in bed, he had to make\na great effort to keep the tears back. . . . Ay, his son, too, might be\nbrought to this sad pass! . . . The man looked to him like an Egyptian\nmummy, because of his complete envelopment in tight bandage wrappings.\nThe sharp hulls of the shell had fairly riddled him. There could only\nbe seen a pair of sweet eyes and a blond bit of moustache sticking up\nbetween white bands. The poor fellow was trying to smile at Chichi, who\nwas hovering around him with a certain authority as though she were in\nher own home.\n\nTwo months rolled by. Rene was better, almost well. His betrothed had\nnever doubted his recovery from the moment that they permitted her to\nremain with him.\n\n\"No one that I love, ever dies,\" she asserted with a ring of her\nfather's self-confidence. \"As if I would ever permit the Boches to leave\nme without a husband!\"\n\nShe had her little sugar soldier back again, but, oh, in what\na lamentable state! . . . Never had Don Marcelo realized the\nde-personalizing horrors of war as when he saw entering his home this\nconvalescent whom he had known months before--elegant and slender, with\na delicate and somewhat feminine beauty. His face was now furrowed by\na network of scars that had transformed it into a purplish arabesque.\nWithin his body were hidden many such. His left hand had disappeared\nwith a part of the forearm, the empty sleeve hanging over the remainder.\nThe other hand was supported on a cane, a necessary aid in order to be\nable to move a leg that would never recover its elasticity.\n\nBut Chichi was content. She surveyed her dear little soldier with more\nenthusiasm than ever--a little deformed, perhaps, but very interesting.\nWith her mother, she accompanied the convalescent in his constitutionals\nthrough the Bois de Boulogne. When, in crossing a street, automobilists\nor coachmen failed to stop their vehicles in order to give the invalid\nthe right of way, her eyes shot lightning shafts, as she thundered,\n\"Shameless embusques!\" . . . She was now feeling the same fiery\nresentment as those women of former days who used to insult her Rene\nwhen he was well and happy. She trembled with satisfaction and pride\nwhen returning the greetings of her friends. Her eloquent eyes seemed\nto be saying, \"Yes, he is my betrothed . . . a hero!\" She was constantly\narranging the war cross on his blouse of \"horizon blue,\" taking pains\nto place it as conspicuously as possible. She also spent much time in\nprolonging the life of his shabby uniform--always the same one, the\nold one which he was wearing when wounded. A new one would give him the\nofficery look of the soldiers who never left Paris.\n\nAs he grew stronger, Rene vainly tried to emancipate himself from her\ndominant supervision. It was simply useless to try to walk with more\ncelerity or freedom.\n\n\"Lean on me!\"\n\nAnd he had to take his fiancee's arm. All her plans for the future were\nbased on the devotion with which she was going to protect her husband,\non the solicitude that she was going to dedicate to his crippled\ncondition.\n\n\"My poor, dear invalid,\" she would murmur lovingly. \"So ugly and so\nhelpless those blackguards have left you! . . . But luckily you have\nme, and I adore you! . . . It makes no difference to me that one of your\nhands is gone. I will care for you; you shall be my little son. You will\njust see, after we are married, how elegant and stylish I am going to\nkeep you. But don't you dare to look at any of the other women! The very\nfirst moment that you do, my precious little invalid, I'll leave you\nalone in your helplessness!\"\n\nDesnoyers and the senator were also concerned about their future, but in\na very definite way. They must be married as soon as possible. What was\nthe use of waiting? . . . The war was no longer an obstacle. They would\nbe married as quietly as possible. This was no time for wedding pomp.\n\nSo Rene Lacour remained permanently in the house on the avenida Victor\nHugo, after the nuptial ceremony witnessed by a dozen people.\n\nDon Marcelo had had dreams of other things for his daughter--a grand\nwedding to which the daily papers would devote much space, a son-in-law\nwith a brilliant future . . . but ay, this war! Everybody was having his\nfondest hopes dashed to pieces every few hours.\n\nHe took what comfort he could out of the situation. What more did they\nwant? Chichi was happy--with a rollicking and selfish happiness which\ntook no interest in anything but her own love-affairs. The Desnoyers\nbusiness returns could not be improved upon;--after the first crisis\nhad passed, the necessities of the belligerents had begun utilizing\nthe output of his ranches, and never before had meat brought such high\nprices. Money was flowing in with greater volume than formerly, while\nthe expenses were diminishing. . . . Julio was in daily danger of death,\nbut the old ranchman was buoyed up by his conviction that his son led\na charmed life--no harm could touch him. His chief preoccupation,\ntherefore, was to keep himself tranquil, avoiding all emotional storms.\nHe had been reading with considerable alarm of the frequency with which\nwell-known persons, politicians, artists and writers, were dying in\nParis. War was not doing all its killing at the front; its shocks were\nfalling like arrows over the land, causing the fall of the weak, the\ncrushed and the exhausted who, in normal times, would probably have\nlived to a far greater age.\n\n\"Attention, Marcelo!\" he said to himself with grim humor. \"Keep cool\nnow! . . . You must avoid Friend Tchernoff's four horsemen, you know!\"\n\nHe spent an afternoon in the studio going over the war news in the\npapers. The French had begun an offensive in Champagne with great\nadvances and many prisoners.\n\nDesnoyers could not but think of the loss of life that this must\nrepresent. Julio's fate, however, gave him no uneasiness, for his son\nwas not in that part of the front. But yesterday he had received a\nletter from him, dated the week before; they all took about that\nlength of time to reach him. Sub-lieutenant Desnoyers was as blithe and\nreckless as ever. They were going to promote him again--he was among\nthose proposed for the Legion d'Honneur. These facts intensified Don\nMarcelo's vision of himself as the father of a general as young as those\nof the revolution; and as he contemplated the daubs and sketches around\nhim, he marvelled at the extraordinary way in which the war had twisted\nhis son's career.\n\nOn his way home, he passed Marguerite Laurier dressed in mourning.\nThe senator had told him a few days before that her brother, the\nartilleryman, had just been killed at Verdun.\n\n\"How many are falling!\" he said mournfully to himself. \"How hard it will\nbe for his poor mother!\"\n\nBut he smiled immediately after at the thought of those to be born.\nNever before had the people been so occupied in accelerating their\nreproduction. Even Madame Laurier now showed with pride the very visible\ncurves of her approaching maternity, and Desnoyers noted sympathetically\nthe vital volume apparent beneath her long mourning veil. Again he\nthought of Julio, without taking into account the flight of time. He\nfelt as interested in the little newcomer as though he were in some way\nrelated to it, and he promised himself to aid generously the Laurier\nbaby if he ever had the opportunity.\n\nOn entering his house, he was met in the hall by Dona Luisa, who told\nhim that Lacour was waiting for him.\n\n\"Very good!\" he responded gaily. \"Let us see what our illustrious\nfather-in-law has to say.\"\n\nHis good wife was uneasy. She had felt alarmed without knowing exactly\nwhy at the senator's solemn appearance; with that feminine instinct\nwhich perforates all masculine precautions, she surmised some hidden\nmission. She had noticed, too, that Rene and his father were talking\ntogether in a low tone, with repressed emotion.\n\nMoved by an irresistible impulse, she hovered near the closed door,\nhoping to hear something definite. Her wait was not long.\n\nSuddenly a cry . . . a groan . . . the groan that can come only from a\nbody from which all vitality is escaping.\n\nAnd Dona Luisa rushed in just in time to support her husband as he was\nfalling to the floor.\n\nThe senator was excusing himself confusedly to the walls, the furniture,\nand turning his back in his agitation on the dismayed Rene, the only one\nwho could have listened to him.\n\n\"He did not let me finish. . . . He guessed from the very first\nword. . . .\"\n\nHearing the outcry, Chichi hastened in in time to see her father\nslipping from his wife's arms to the sofa, and from there to the floor,\nwith glassy, staring eyes, and foaming at the mouth.\n\nFrom the luxurious rooms came forth the world-old cry, always the same\nfrom the humblest home to the highest and loneliest:--\n\n\"Oh, Julio! . . . Oh, my son, my son! . . .\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE BURIAL FIELDS\n\n\nThe automobile was going slowly forward under the colorless sky of a\nwinter morning.\n\nIn the distance, the earth's surface seemed trembling with white,\nfluttering things resembling a band of butterflies poised on the\nfurrows. On one of the fields the swarm was of great size, on others, it\nwas broken into small groups.\n\nAs the machine approached these white butterflies, they seemed to\nbe taking on other colors. One wing was turning blue, another\nflesh-colored. . . . They were little flags, by the hundreds, by the\nthousands which palpitated night and day, in the mild, sunny, morning\nbreeze, in the damp drip of the dull mornings, in the biting cold of the\ninterminable nights. The rains had washed and re-washed them, stealing\naway the most of their color. Some of the borders of the restless little\nstrips were mildewed by the dampness while others were scorched by the\nsun, like insects which have just grazed the flames.\n\nIn the midst of the fluttering flags could be seen the black crosses\nof wood. On these were hanging dark kepis, red caps, and helmets topped\nwith tufts of horsehair, slowly disintegrating and weeping atmospheric\ntears at every point.\n\n\"How many are dead!\" sighed Don Marcelo's voice from the automobile.\n\nAnd Rene, who was seated in front of him, sadly nodded his head. Dona\nLuisa was looking at the mournful plain while her lips trembled slightly\nin constant prayer. Chichi turned her great eyes in astonishment from\none side to the other. She appeared larger, more capable in spite of the\npallor which blanched her olive skin.\n\nThe two ladies were dressed in deepest mourning. The father, too, was\nin mourning, huddled down in the seat in a crushed attitude, his legs\ncarefully covered with the great fur rugs. Rene was wearing his campaign\nuniform under his storm coat. In spite of his injuries, he had not\nwished to retire from the army. He had been transferred to a technical\noffice till the termination of the war.\n\nThe Desnoyers family were on the way to carry out their long-cherished\nhope.\n\nUpon recovering consciousness after the fatal news, the father had\nconcentrated all his will power in one petition.\n\n\"I must see him. . . . Oh, my son! . . . My son!\"\n\nVain were the senator's efforts to show him the impossibility of such\na journey. The fighting was still going on in the zone where Julio had\nfallen. Later on, perhaps, it might be possible to visit it. \"I want to\nsee it!\" persisted the broken-hearted old man. It was necessary for\nhim to see his son's grave before dying himself, and Lacour had to\nrequisition all his powers, for four long months formulating requests\nand overcoming much opposition, in order that Don Marcelo might be\npermitted to make the trip.\n\nFinally a military automobile came one morning for the entire Desnoyers\nfamily. The senator could not accompany them. Rumors of an approaching\nchange in the cabinet were floating about, and he felt obliged to show\nhimself in the senate in case the Republic should again wish to avail\nitself of his unappreciated services.\n\nThey passed the night in a provincial city where there was a military\npost, and Rene collected considerable information from officers who had\nwitnessed the great combat. With his map before him, he followed the\nexplanations until he thought he could recognize the very plot of ground\nwhich Julio's regiment had occupied.\n\nThe following morning they renewed their expedition. A soldier who\nhad taken part in the battle acted as their guide, seated beside the\nchauffeur. From time to time, Rene consulted the map spread out on his\nknees, and asked questions of the soldier whose regiment had fought\nvery close to that of Desnoyers', but he could not remember exactly the\nground which they had gone over so many months before. The landscape\nhad undergone many transformations and had presented a very different\nappearance when covered with men. Its deserted aspect bewildered him\n. . . and the motor had to go very slowly, veering to the north of the\nline of graves, following the central highway, level and white, entering\ncrossroads and winding through ditches muddied with deep pools through\nwhich they splashed with great bounds and jar on the springs. At times,\nthey drove across fields from one plot of crosses to another, their\npneumatic tires crushing flat from the furrows opened by the plowman.\n\nTombs . . . tombs on all sides! The white locusts of death were swarming\nover the entire countryside. There was no corner free from their\nquivering wings. The recently plowed earth, the yellowing roads, the\ndark woodland, everything was pulsating in weariless undulation. The\nsoil seemed to be clamoring, and its words were the vibrations of the\nrestless little flags. And the thousands of cries, endlessly repeated\nacross the days and nights, were intoning in rhythmic chant the terrible\nonslaught which this earth had witnessed and from which it still felt\ntragic shudderings.\n\n\"Dead . . . dead,\" murmured Chichi, following the rows of crosses\nincessantly slipping past the sides of the automobile.\n\n\"O Lord, for them! . . . for their mothers,\" moaned Dona Luisa, renewing\nher prayers.\n\nHere had taken place the fiercest part of the battle--the fight in the\nold way, man to man outside of the trenches, with bayonets, with guns,\nwith fists, with teeth.\n\nThe guide who was beginning to get his bearings was pointing out\nthe various points on the desolate horizon. There were the African\nsharpshooters; further on, the chasseurs. The very large groups of\ngraves were where the light infantry had charged with their bayonets on\nthe sides of the road.\n\nThe automobile came to a stop. Rene climbed out after the soldier in\norder to examine the inscriptions on a few of the crosses. Perhaps\nthese might have belonged to the regiment they were seeking. Chichi\nalso alighted mechanically with the irresistible desire of aiding her\nhusband.\n\nEach grave contained several men. The number of bodies within could be\ntold by the mouldering kepis or rusting helmets hanging on the arms of\nthe cross; the number of the regiments could still be deciphered\nbetween the rows of ants crawling over the caps. The wreaths with which\naffection had adorned some of the sepulchres were blackened and stripped\nof their leaves. On some of the crucifixes, the names of the dead were\nstill clear, but others were beginning to fade out and soon would be\nentirely illegible.\n\n\"What a horrible death! . . . What glory!\" thought Chichi sadly.\n\nNot even the names of the greater part of these vigorous men cut down in\nthe strength of their youth were going to survive! Nothing would\nremain but the memory which would from time to time overwhelm some old\ncountrywoman driving her cow along the French highway, murmuring between\nher sobs. \"My little one! . . . I wonder where they buried my little\none!\" Or, perhaps, it would live in the heart of the village woman clad\nin mourning who did not know how to solve the problem of existence; or\nin the minds of the children going to school in black blouses and saying\nwith ferocious energy--\"When I grow up I am going to kill the Boches to\navenge my father's death!\"\n\nAnd Dona Luisa, motionless in her seat, followed with her eyes\nChichi's course among the graves, while returning to her interrupted\nprayer--\"Lord, for the mothers without sons . . . for the little ones\nwithout fathers! . . . May thy wrath not be turned against us, and may\nthy smile shine upon us once more!\"\n\nHer husband, shrunken in his seat, was also looking over the funereal\nfields, but his eyes were fixed most tenaciously on some mounds without\nwreaths or flags, simple crosses with a little board bearing the\nbriefest inscription. These were the German bodies which seemed to have\na page to themselves in the Book of Death. On one side, the\ninnumerable French tombs with inscriptions as small as possible, simple\nnumbers--one, two, three dead. On the other, in each of the spacious,\nunadorned sepulchres, great quantities of soldiers, with a number\nof terrifying terseness. Fences of wooden strips, narrow and wide,\nsurrounded these latter ditches filled to the top with bodies. The earth\nwas as bleached as though covered with snow or saltpetre. This was the\nlime returning to mix with the land. The crosses raised above these huge\nmounds bore each an inscription stating that it contained Germans, and\nthen a number--200 . . . 300 . . . 400.\n\nSuch appalling figures obliged Desnoyers to exert his imagination.\nIt was not easy to evoke with exactitude the vision of three hundred\ncarcasses in helmets, boots and cloaks, in all the revolting aspects of\ndeath, piled in rows as though they were bricks, locked forever in the\ndepths of a great trench. . . . And this funereal alignment was repeated\nat intervals all over the great immensity of the plain!\n\nThe mere sight of them filled Don Marcelo with a kind of savage joy, as\nhis mourning fatherhood tasted the fleeting consolation of vengeance.\nJulio had died, and he was going to die, too, not having strength to\nsurvive his bitter woe; but how many hundreds of the enemy wasting in\nthese awful trenches were also leaving in the world loved beings who\nwould remember them as he was remembering his son! . . .\n\nHe imagined them as they must have been before the death call sounded,\nas he had seen them in the advance around his castle.\n\nSome of them, the most prominent and terrifying, probably still showed\non their faces the theatrical cicatrices of their university duels. They\nwere the soldiers who carried books in their knapsacks, and after the\nfusillade of a lot of country folk, or the sacking and burning of a\nhamlet, devoted themselves to reading the poets and philosophers by\nthe glare of the blaze which they had kindled. They were bloated with\nscience as with the puffiness of a toad, proud of their pedantic and\nall-sufficient intellectuality. Sons of sophistry and grandsons of\ncant, they had considered themselves capable of proving the greatest\nabsurdities by the mental capers to which they had accustomed their\nacrobatic intellects.\n\nThey had employed the favorite method of the thesis, antithesis and\nsynthesis in order to demonstrate that Germany ought to be the Mistress\nof the World; that Belgium was guilty of her own ruin because she had\ndefended herself; that true happiness consisted in having all humanity\ndominated by Prussia; that the supreme idea of existence consisted in\na clean stable and a full manger; that Liberty and Justice were nothing\nmore than illusions of the romanticism of the French; that every deed\naccomplished became virtuous from the moment it triumphed, and that\nRight was simply a derivative of Might. These metaphysical athletes with\nguns and sabres were accustomed to consider themselves the paladins of\na crusade of civilization. They wished the blond type to triumph\ndefinitely over the brunette; they wished to enslave the worthless man\nof the South, consigning him forever to a world regulated by \"the salt\nof the earth,\" \"the aristocracy of humanity.\" Everything on the page of\nhistory that had amounted to anything was German. The ancient Greeks had\nbeen of Germanic origin; German, too, the great artists of the Italian\nRenaissance. The men of the Mediterranean countries, with the inherent\nbadness of their extraction, had falsified history. . . .\n\n\"That's the best place for you. . . You are better where you are buried,\nyou pitiless pedants!\" thought Desnoyers, recalling his conversations\nwith his friend, the Russian.\n\nWhat a shame that there were not here, too, all the Herr Professors of\nthe German universities--those wise men so unquestionably skilful\nin altering the trademarks of intellectual products and changing the\nterminology of things! Those men with flowing beards and gold-rimmed\nspectacles, pacific rabbits of the laboratory and the professor's\nchair that had been preparing the ground for the present war with their\nsophistries and their unblushing effrontery! Their guilt was far greater\nthan that of the Herr Lieutenant of the tight corset and the gleaming\nmonocle, who in his thirst for strife and slaughter was simply and\nlogically working out the professional charts.\n\nWhile the German soldier of the lower classes was plundering what he\ncould and drunkenly shooting whatever crossed his path, the warrior\nstudent was reading by the camp glow, Hegel and Nietzsche. He was too\nenlightened to execute with his own hands these acts of \"historical\njustice,\" but he, with the professors, was rousing all the bad\ninstincts of the Teutonic beast and giving them a varnish of scientific\njustification.\n\n\"Lie there, in your sepulchre, you intellectual scourge!\" continued\nDesnoyers mentally.\n\nThe fierce Moors, the negroes of infantile intelligence, the sullen\nHindus, appeared to him more deserving of respect than all the\nermine-bordered togas parading haughtily and aggressively through the\ncloisters of the German universities. What peacefulness for the world\nif their wearers should disappear forever! He preferred the simple\nand primitive barbarity of the savage to the refined, deliberate and\nmerciless barbarity of the greedy sage;--it did less harm and was not so\nhypocritical.\n\nFor this reason, the only ones in the enemy's ranks who awakened his\ncommiseration were the lowly and unlettered dead interred beneath the\nsod. They had been peasants, factory hands, business clerks, German\ngluttons of measureless (intestinal) capacity, who had seen in the war\nan opportunity for satisfying their appetites, for beating somebody and\nordering them about after having passed their lives in their country,\nobeying and receiving kicks.\n\nThe history of their country was nothing more than a series of\nraids--like the Indian forays, in order to plunder the property of those\nwho lived in the mild Mediterranean climes. The Herr Professors\nhad proved to their countrymen that such sacking incursions were\nindispensable to the highest civilization, and that the German was\nmarching onward with the enthusiasm of a good father sacrificing himself\nin order to secure bread for his family.\n\nHundreds of thousands of letters, written by their relatives with\ntremulous hands, were following the great Germanic horde across the\ninvaded countries. Desnoyers had overheard the reading of some of these,\nat nightfall before his ruined castle. These were some of the messages\nfound in the pockets of the imprisoned or dead:--\"Don't show any pity\nfor the red pantaloons. Kill WHOMEVER YOU CAN, and show no mercy even to\nthe little ones.\" . . . \"We would thank you for the shoes, but the girl\ncannot get them on. Those French have such ridiculously small feet!\"\n. . . \"Try to get hold of a piano.\". . . \"I would very much like a good\nwatch.\" . . . \"Our neighbor, the Captain, has sent his wife a necklace\nof pearls. . . . And you send only such insignificant things!\"\n\nThe virtuous German had been advancing heroically with the double desire\nof enlarging his country and of making valuable gifts to his offspring.\n\"Deutschland uber alles!\" But their most cherished illusions had fallen\ninto the burial ditch in company with thousands of comrades-at-arms fed\non the same dreams.\n\nDesnoyers could imagine the impatience on the other side of the Rhine,\nthe pitiful women who were waiting and waiting. The lists of the dead\nhad, perhaps, overlooked the missing ones; and the letters kept coming\nand coming to the German lines, many of them never reaching their\ndestination. \"Why don't you answer! Perhaps you are not writing so as to\ngive us a great surprise. Don't forget the necklace! Send us a piano.\nA carved china cabinet for the dining room would please us greatly. The\nFrench have so many beautiful things!\" . . .\n\nThe bare cross rose stark and motionless above the lime-blanched land.\nNear it the little flags were fluttering their wings, moving from side\nto side like a head shaking out a smiling, ironical protest--No! . . .\nNo!\n\nThe automobile continued on its painful way. The guide was now pointing\nto a distant group of graves. That was undoubtedly the place where the\nregiment had been fighting. So the vehicle left the main road, sinking\nits wheels in the soft earth, having to make wide detours in order to\navoid the mounds scattered about so capriciously by the casualties of\nthe combat.\n\nAlmost all of the fields were ploughed. The work of the farmer extended\nfrom tomb to tomb, making them more prominent as the morning sun forced\nits way through the enshrouding mists.\n\nNature, blind, unfeeling and silent, ignoring individual existence and\ntaking to her bosom with equal indifference, a poor little animal or a\nmillion corpses, was beginning to smile under the late winter suns.\n\nThe fountains were still crusted with their beards of ice; the earth\nsnapped as the feet weighed down its hidden crystals; the trees, black\nand sleeping, were still retaining the coat of metallic green in which\nthe winter had clothed them; from the depths of the earth still issued\nan acute, deadly chill, like that of burned-out planets. . . . But\nSpring had already girded herself with flowers in her palace in the\ntropics, and was saddling with green her trusty steed, neighing with\nimpatience. Soon they would race through the fields, driving before them\nin disordered flight the black goblins of winter, and leaving in their\nwake green growing things and tender, subtle perfumes. The wayside\ngreenery, robing itself in tiny buds, was already heralding their\narrival. The birds were venturing forth from their retreats in order\nto wing their way among the crows croaking wrathfully above the closed\ntombs. The landscape was beginning to smile in the sunlight with the\nartless, deceptive smile of a child who looks candidly around while his\npockets are stuffed with stolen goodies.\n\nThe husbandmen had ploughed the fields and filled the furrows with seed.\nMen might go on killing each other as much as they liked; the soil had\nno concern with their hatreds, and on that account, did not propose to\nalter its course. As every year, the metal cutter had opened its\nusual lines, obliterating with its ridges the traces of man and beast,\nundismayed and with stubborn diligence filling up the tunnels which the\nbombs had made.\n\nSometimes the ploughshare had struck against an obstacle underground\n. . . an unknown, unburied man; but the cultivator had continued on its\nway without pity. Every now and then, it was stopped by less yielding\nobstructions, projectiles which had sunk into the ground intact. The\nrustic had dug up these instruments of death which occasionally had\nexploded their delayed charge in his hands.\n\nBut the man of the soil knows no fear when in search of sustenance, and\nso was doggedly continuing his rectilinear advance, swerving only before\nthe visible tombs; there the furrows had curved mercifully, making\nlittle islands of the mounds surmounted by crosses and flags. The seeds\nof future bread were preparing to extend their tentacles like devil\nfish among those who, but a short time before, were animated by such\nmonstrous ambition. Life was about to renew itself once more.\n\nThe automobile came to a standstill. The guide was running about among\nthe crosses, stooping over in order to examine their weather-stained\ninscriptions.\n\n\"Here we are!\"\n\nHe had found above one grave the number of the regiment.\n\nChichi and her husband promptly dismounted again. Then Dona Luisa, with\nsad resolution, biting her lips to keep the tears back. Then the three\ndevoted themselves to assisting the father who had thrown off his fur\nlap-robe. Poor Desnoyers! On touching the ground, he swayed back and\nforth, moving forward with the greatest effort, lifting his feet with\ndifficulty, and sinking his staff in the hollows.\n\n\"Lean on me, my poor dear,\" said the old wife, offering her arm.\n\nThe masterful head of the family could no longer take a single step\nwithout their aid.\n\nThen began their slow, painful pilgrimage among the graves.\n\nThe guide was still exploring the spot bristling with crosses, spelling\nout the names, and hesitating before the faded lettering. Rene was doing\nthe same on the other side of the road. Chichi went on alone, the wind\nwhirling her black veil around her, and making the little curls escape\nfrom under her mourning hat every time she leaned over to decipher a\nname. Her daintily shod feet sunk deep into the ruts, and she had to\ngather her skirts about her in order to move more comfortably--revealing\nthus at every step evidences of the joy of living, of hidden beauty,\nof consummated love following her course through this land of death and\ndesolation.\n\nIn the distance sounded feebly her father's voice:\n\n\"Not yet?\"\n\nThe two elders were growing impatient, anxious to find their son's\nresting place as soon as possible.\n\nA half hour thus dragged by without any result--always unfamiliar names,\nanonymous crosses or the numbers of other regiments. Don Marcelo was\nno longer able to stand. Their passage across the irregularities of the\nsoft earth had been torment for him. He was beginning to despair. . . .\nAy, they would never find Julio's remains! The parents, too, had been\nscrutinizing the plots nearest them, bending sadly before cross after\ncross. They stopped before a long, narrow hillock, and read the name.\n. . . No, he was not there, either; and they continued desperately along\nthe painful path of alternate hopes and disappointments.\n\nIt was Chichi who notified them with a cry, \"Here. . . . Here it is!\"\nThe old folks tried to run, almost falling at every step. All the family\nwere soon grouped around a heap of earth in the vague outline of a bier,\nand beginning to be covered with herbage. At the head was a cross with\nletters cut in deep with the point of a knife, the kind deed of some of\nhis comrades-at-arms--\"DESNOYERS.\" . . . Then in military abbreviations,\nthe rank, regiment and company.\n\nA long silence. Dona Luisa had knelt instantly, with her eyes fixed on\nthe cross--those great, bloodshot eyes that could no longer weep. Till\nthen, tears had been constantly in her eyes, but now they deserted her\nas though overcome by the immensity of a grief incapable of expressing\nitself in the usual ways.\n\nThe father was staring at the rustic grave in dumb amazement. His son\nwas there, there forever! . . . and he would never see him again! He\nimagined him sleeping unshrouded below, in direct contact with the\nearth, just as Death had surprised him in his miserable and heroic old\nuniform. He recalled the exquisite care which the lad had always given\nhis body--the long bath, the massage, the invigorating exercise of\nboxing and fencing, the cold shower, the elegant and subtle perfume\n. . . all that he might come to this! . . . that he might be interred\njust where he had fallen in his tracks, like a wornout beast of burden!\n\nThe bereaved father wished to transfer his son immediately from the\nofficial burial fields, but he could not do it yet. As soon as possible\nit should be done, and he would erect for him a mausoleum fit for a\nking. . . . And what good would that do? He would merely be changing the\nlocation of a mass of bones, but his body, his physical semblance--all\nthat had contributed to the charm of his personality would be mixed\nwith the earth. The son of the rich Desnoyers would have become an\ninseparable part of a poor field in Champagne. Ah, the pity of it\nall! And for this, had he worked so hard and so long to accumulate his\nmillions? . . .\n\nHe could never know how Julio's death had happened. Nobody could tell\nhim his last words. He was ignorant as to whether his end had been\ninstantaneous, overwhelming--his idol going out of the world with his\nusual gay smile on his lips, or whether he had endured long hours of\nagony abandoned in the field, writhing like a reptile or passing through\nphases of hellish torment before collapsing in merciful oblivion. He was\nalso ignorant of just how much was beneath this mound--whether an\nentire body discreetly touched by the hand of Death, or an assemblage of\nshapeless remnants from the devastating hurricane of steel! . . . And\nhe would never see him again! And that Julio who had been filling his\nthoughts would become simply a memory, a name that would live while\nhis parents lived, fading away, little by little, after they had\ndisappeared! . . .\n\nHe was startled to hear a moan, a sob. . . . Then he recognized dully\nthat they were his own, that he had been accompanying his reflections\nwith groans of grief.\n\nHis wife was still at his feet, kneeling, alone with her heartbreak,\nfixing her dry eyes on the cross with a gaze of hypnotic tenacity.\n. . . There was her son near her knees, lying stretched out as she had\nso often watched him when sleeping in his cradle! . . . The father's\nsobs were wringing her heart, too, but with an unbearable depression,\nwithout his wrathful exasperation. And she would never see him again!\n. . . Could it be possible! . . .\n\nChichi's presence interrupted the despairing thoughts of her parents.\nShe had run to the automobile, and was returning with an armful of\nflowers. She hung a wreath on the cross and placed a great spray of\nblossoms at the foot. Then she scattered a shower of petals over the\nentire surface of the grave, sadly, intensely, as though performing\na religious rite, accompanying the offering with her outspoken\nthoughts--\"For you who so loved life for its beauties and pleasures!\n. . . for you who knew so well how to make yourself beloved!\" . . . And\nas her tears fell, her affectionate memories were as full of admiration\nas of grief. Had she not been his sister, she would have liked to have\nbeen his beloved.\n\nAnd having exhausted the rain of flower-petals, she wandered away so as\nnot to disturb the lamentations of her parents.\n\nBefore the uselessness of his bitter plaints, Don Marcelo's former\ndominant character had come to life, raging against destiny.\n\nHe looked at the horizon where so often he had imagined the adversary\nto be, and clenched his fists in a paroxysm of fury. His disordered mind\nbelieved that it saw the Beast, the Nemesis of humanity. And how much\nlonger would the evil be allowed to go unpunished? . . .\n\nThere was no justice; the world was ruled by blind chance;--all lies,\nmere words of consolation in order that mankind might exist unterrified\nby the hopeless abandon in which it lived!\n\nIt appeared to him that from afar was echoing the gallop of the four\nApocalyptic horsemen, riding rough-shod over all his fellow-creatures.\nHe saw the strong and brutal giant with the sword of War, the archer\nwith his repulsive smile, shooting his pestilential arrows, the\nbald-headed miser with the scales of Famine, the hard-riding spectre\nwith the scythe of Death. He recognized them as only divinities,\nfamiliar and terrible-which had made their presence felt by mankind. All\nthe rest was a dream. The four horsemen were the reality. . . .\n\nSuddenly, by the mysterious process of telepathy, he seemed to read the\nthoughts of the one grieving at his feet.\n\nThe mother, impelled by her own sorrow, was thinking of that of others.\nShe, too, was looking toward the distant horizon. There she seemed to\nsee a procession of the enemy, grieving in the same way as were her\nfamily. She saw Elena with her daughters going in and out among the\nburial grounds, seeking a loved one, falling on their knees before a\ncross. Ay, this mournful satisfaction, she could never know completely!\nIt would be forever impossible for her to pass to the opposite side in\nsearch of the other grave, for, even after some time had passed by, she\ncould never find it. The beloved body of Otto would have disappeared\nforever in one of the nameless pits which they had just passed.\n\n\"O Lord, why did we ever come to these lands? Why did we not continue\nliving in the land where we were born?\" . . .\n\nDesnoyers, too, uniting his thoughts with hers, was seeing again the\npampas, the immense green plains of the ranch where he had become\nacquainted with his wife. Again he could hear the tread of the herds. He\nrecalled Madariaga on tranquil nights proclaiming, under the splendor of\nthe stars, the joys of peace, the sacred brotherhood of these people\nof most diverse extraction, united by labor, abundance and the lack of\npolitical ambition.\n\nAnd as his thoughts swung back to the lost son he, too, exclaimed with\nhis wife, \"Oh, why did we ever come? . . .\" He, too, with the solidarity\nof grief, began to sympathize with those on the other side of the battle\nfront. They were suffering just as he was; they had lost their sons.\nHuman grief is the same everywhere.\n\nBut then he revolted against his commiseration. Karl had been an\nadvocate of this war. He was among those who had looked upon war as the\nperfect state for mankind, who had prepared it with their provocations.\nIt was just that War should devour his sons; he ought not to bewail\ntheir loss. . . . But he who had always loved Peace! He who had only one\nson, only one! . . . and now he was losing him forever! . . .\n\nHe was going to die; he was sure that he was going to die. . . . Only a\nfew months of life were left in him. And his pitiful, devoted companion\nkneeling at his feet, she, too, would soon pass away. She could not long\nsurvive the blow which they had just received. There was nothing further\nfor them to do; nobody needed them any longer.\n\nTheir daughter was thinking only of herself, of founding a separate\nhome interest--with the hard instinct of independence which separates\nchildren from their parents in order that humanity may continue its work\nof renovation.\n\nJulio was the only one who would have prolonged the family, passing\non the name. The Desnoyers had died; his daughter's children would be\nLacour. . . . All was ended.\n\nDon Marcelo even felt a certain satisfaction in thinking of his\napproaching death. More than anything else, he wished to pass out of the\nworld. He no longer had any curiosity as to the end of this war in which\nhe had been so interested. Whatever the end might be, it would be sure\nto turn out badly. Although the Beast might be mutilated, it would again\ncome forth years afterward, as the eternal curse of mankind. . . . For\nhim the only important thing now was that the war had robbed him of his\nson. All was gloomy, all was black. The world was going to its ruin.\n. . . He was going to rest.\n\nChichi had clambered up on the hillock which contained, perhaps, more\nthan their dead. With furrowed brow, she was contemplating the plain.\nGraves . . . graves everywhere! The recollection of Julio had already\npassed to second place in her mind. She could not bring him back, no\nmatter how much she might weep.\n\nThis vision of the fields of death made her think all the more of the\nliving. As her eyes roved from side to side, she tried, with her hands,\nto keep down the whirling of her wind-tossed skirts. Rene was standing\nat the foot of the knoll, and several times after a sweeping glance at\nthe numberless mounds around them, she looked thoughtfully at him, as\nthough trying to establish a relationship between her husband and those\nbelow. And he had exposed his life in combats just as these men had\ndone! . . .\n\n\"And you, my poor darling,\" she continued aloud. \"At this very moment\nyou, too, might be lying here under a heap of earth with a wooden cross\nat your head, just like these poor unfortunates!\"\n\nThe sub-lieutenant smiled sadly. Yes, it was so.\n\n\"Come here; climb up here!\" said Chichi impetuously. \"I want to give you\nsomething!\"\n\nAs soon as he approached her, she flung her arms around his neck,\npressed him against the warm softness of her breast, exhaling a perfume\nof life and love, and kissed him passionately without a thought of her\nbrother, without seeing her aged parents grieving below them and longing\nto die. . . . And her skirts, freed by the breeze, molded her figure in\nthe superb sweep of the curves of a Grecian vase.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, by \nVicente Blasco Ibanez\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE FOUR HORSEMEN ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1484.txt or 1484.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/4\/8\/1484\/\n\nProduced by Donald Lainson\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":578,"split":"train"}
