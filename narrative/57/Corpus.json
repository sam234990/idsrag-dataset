{"ori_id":"0d6f958d03124c4176549fce64ed4e7849e351f9","title":"Emmeline","context":"Emmeline\n Emmeline is set in Pembroke, Wales and centres around the eponymous heroine. Her parents are both dead and she has been supported by her father's brother, Lord Montreville, at Mowbray Castle. It is suggested at the beginning of the novel that Emmeline's parents were not married when she was born, making her illegitimate; on these grounds, Lord Montreville has claimed Mowbray Castle for himself and his family. Emmeline has been left to be raised by servants, but through reading, she has become educated and accomplished and catches the eye of Lord Montreville's son, Lord Delamere. Delamere falls in love with her and proposes but Emmeline refuses him because his father does not approve and she feels only sisterly affection for him. To escape Delamere's protestations of love, Emmeline leaves Mowbray Castle and lives first with Mrs. Stafford and then Mrs. Ashwood, where Delamere continues to pursue her. Emmeline also rejects the suits of other rich men, confounding the people around her.\nThe Croft family, lawyers who are trying to rise in society, have influence over and control Lord Montreville. The younger Croft son secretly marries the eldest Montreville daughter to secure a fortune\u2014a most unfortunate match from Lord Montreville's perspective.\nDelamere abducts Emmeline: he attempts to take her to Scotland and to force her to marry him. However, after falling ill of a fever, she convinces him to abandon his plans. When Delamere\u2019s mother, Lady Montreville, becomes ill, he is compelled to visit his family. To help her recover, he promises not to see Emmeline for a year. If, after that period, he still loves her, his parents promise to allow him to marry her and she reluctantly agrees.\nEmmeline becomes friends with Augusta, Delamere\u2019s sister. Augusta marries Lord Westhaven, who by happenstance, is the brother of Emmeline\u2019s new acquaintance in the country\u2014Adelina. Adelina left her dissipated husband for a lover who abandoned her with a child. She is so distraught that when she sees her brother, Lord Westhaven, she fears his chastisement so much that she briefly goes insane. Emmeline nurses her and her baby; while doing so, she meets Adelina's other brother, Godolphin.\nThe Crofts circulate rumours of Emmeline\u2019s infidelity to Delamere and when he visits her and sees her with Adelina\u2019s child, he assumes the child is hers and abandons her. Emmeline then travels to France with Mrs. Stafford and Augusta, where she discovers her parents were actually married and that she deserves to inherit Mowbray Castle. Lord Montreville hands the estate over to her, after discovering he was duped by the Crofts. Delamere becomes ill upon discovering that Emmeline was never unfaithful to him. She nurses him, but refuses to marry him. His mother dies in her anxiety over his condition and he dies fighting a duel over his sister\u2019s lover. In the end, Emmeline marries Godolphin.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, Emmeline, by Charlotte Turner Smith\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

A few rooms only had been\noccasionally repaired to accommodate the proprietor, when he found it\nnecessary to come thither to receive his rents, or to inspect the\ncondition of the estate; which however happened so seldom, that during\nthe twelve years he had been master of it, he had only once visited the\ncastle for a few days. The business that related to the property round\nit (which was very considerable) was conducted by a steward grown grey\nin the service of the family, and by an attorney from London, who came\nto hold the courts. And an old housekeeper, a servant who waited on her,\nthe steward, and a labourer who was kept to look after his horse and\nwork in that part of the garden which yet bore the vestige of\ncultivation, were now all its inhabitants; except a little girl, of whom\nthe housekeeper had the care, and who was believed to be the natural\ndaughter of that elder brother, by whose death Lord Montreville, the\npresent possessor, became entitled to the estate.\n\nThis nobleman, while yet a younger son, was (by the partiality of his\nmother, who had been an heiress, and that of some other female\nrelations) master of a property nearly equal to what he inherited by the\ndeath of his brother, Mr. Mowbray.\n\nHe had been originally designed for the law; but in consequence of being\nentitled to the large estate which had been his mother's, and heir, by\nwill, to all her opulent family, he had quitted that profession, and at\nthe age of about four and twenty, had married Lady Eleonore Delamere, by\nwhom he had a son and two daughters.\n\nThe illustrious family from which Lady Eleonore descended, became\nextinct in the male line by the premature death of her two brothers; and\nher Ladyship becoming sole heiress, her husband took the name of\nDelamere; and obtaining one of the titles of the lady's father, was, at\nhis death, created Viscount Montreville. Mr. Mowbray died before he was\nthirty, in Italy; and Lord Montreville, on taking possession of Mowbray\nCastle, found there his infant daughter.\n\nHer mother had died soon after her birth; and she had been sent from\nFrance, where she was born, and put under the care of Mrs. Carey, the\nhousekeeper, who was tenderly attached to her, having been the attendant\nof Mr. Mowbray from his earliest infancy.\n\nLord Montreville suffered her to remain in the situation in which he\nfound her, and to go by the name of Mowbray: he allowed for the trifling\ncharge of her board and necessary cloaths in the steward's account, the\nexamination of which was for some years the only circumstance that\nreminded him of the existence of the unfortunate orphan.\n\nWith no other notice from her father's family, Emmeline had attained her\ntwelfth year; an age at which she would have been left in the most\nprofound ignorance, if her uncommon understanding, and unwearied\napplication, had not supplied the deficiency of her instructors, and\nconquered the disadvantages of her situation.\n\nMrs. Carey could indeed read with tolerable fluency, and write an hand\nhardly legible: and Mr. Williamson, the old steward, had been formerly a\ngood penman, and was still a proficient in accounts. Both were anxious\nto give their little charge all the instruction they could: but without\nthe quickness and attention she shewed to whatever they attempted to\nteach, such preceptors could have done little.\n\nEmmeline had a kind of intuitive knowledge; and comprehended every thing\nwith a facility that soon left her instructors behind her. The\nprecarious and neglected situation in which she lived, troubled not the\ninnocent Emmeline. Having never experienced any other, she felt no\nuneasiness at her present lot; and on the future she was not yet old\nenough to reflect.\n\nMrs. Carey was to her in place of the mother she had never known; and\nthe old steward, she was accustomed to call father. The death of this\nvenerable servant was the first sorrow Emmeline ever felt: returning\nlate one evening, in the winter, from a neighbouring town, he attempted\nto cross a ford, where the waters being extremely out, he was carried\ndown by the rapidity of the current. His horse was drowned; and tho' he\nwas himself rescued from the flood by some peasants who knew him, and\ncarried to the castle, he was so much bruised, and had suffered so much\nfrom cold, that he was taken up speechless, and continued so for the few\nhours he survived the accident.\n\nMrs. Carey, who had lived in the same house with him near forty years,\nfelt the sincerest concern at his death; with which it was necessary for\nher immediately to acquaint Lord Montreville.\n\nHis Lordship directed his attorney in London to replace him with\nanother; to whom Mrs. Carey, with an aching heart, delivered the keys of\nthe steward's room and drawers.\n\nHer health, which was before declining, received a rude shock from the\nmelancholy death of Mr. Williamson; and she and her little ward had soon\nthe mortification of seeing he was forgotten by all but themselves.\n\nFrequent and severe attacks of the gout now made daily ravages in the\nconstitution of Mrs. Carey; and her illness recurred so often, that\nEmmeline, now almost fourteen, began to reflect on what she should do,\nif Mrs. Carey died: and these reflections occasionally gave her pain.\nBut she was not yet of an age to consider deeply, or to dwell long on\ngloomy subjects. Her mind, however, gradually expanded, and her judgment\nimproved: for among the deserted rooms of this once noble edifice, was a\nlibrary, which had been well furnished with the books of those ages in\nwhich they had been collected. Many of them were in black letter; and so\ninjured by time, that the most indefatigable antiquary could have made\nnothing of them.\n\nFrom these, Emmeline turned in despair to some others of more modern\nappearance; which, tho' they also had suffered from the dampness of the\nroom, and in some parts were almost effaced with mould, were yet\ngenerally legible. Among them, were Spencer and Milton, two or three\nvolumes of the Spectator, an old edition of Shakespeare, and an odd\nvolume or two of Pope.\n\nThese, together with some tracts of devotion, which she knew would be\nvery acceptable to Mrs. Carey, she cleaned by degrees from the dust with\nwhich they were covered, and removed into the housekeeper's room; where\nthe village carpenter accommodated her with a shelf, on which, with\ngreat pride of heart, she placed her new acquisitions.\n\nThe dismantled windows, and broken floor of the library, prevented her\ncontinuing there long together: but she frequently renewed her search,\nand with infinite pains examined all the piles of books, some of which\nlay tumbled in heaps on the floor, others promiscuously placed on the\nshelves, where the swallow, the sparrow, and the daw, had found\nhabitations for many years: for as the present proprietor had determined\nto lay out no more than was absolutely necessary to keep one end of the\ncastle habitable, the library, which was in the most deserted part of\nit, was in a ruinous state, and had long been entirely forsaken.\n\nEmmeline, however, by her unwearied researches, nearly completed several\nsets of books, in which instruction and amusement were happily blended.\nFrom them she acquired a taste for poetry, and the more ornamental parts\nof literature; as well as the grounds of that elegant and useful\nknowledge, which, if it rendered not her life happier, enabled her to\nsupport, with the dignity of conscious worth, those undeserved evils\nwith which many of her years were embittered.\n\nMrs. Carey, now far advanced in life, found her infirmities daily\nincrease. She was often incapable of leaving her chamber for many weeks;\nduring which Emmeline attended her with the solicitude and affection of\na daughter; scorned not to perform the most humble offices that\ncontributed to her relief; and sat by her whole days, or watched her\nwhole nights, with the tenderest and most unwearied assiduity.\n\nOn those evenings in summer, when her attendance could for a few hours\nbe dispensed with, she delighted to wander among the rocks that formed\nthe bold and magnificent boundary of the ocean, which spread its immense\nexpanse of water within half a mile of the castle. Simply dressed, and\nwith no other protection than Providence, she often rambled several\nmiles into the country, visiting the remote huts of the shepherds, among\nthe wildest mountains.\n\nDuring the life of Mrs. Mowbray, a small stipend had been annually\nallowed for the use of the poor: this had not yet been withdrawn; and\nit now passed thro' the hands of Mrs. Carey, whose enquiries into the\nimmediate necessities of the cottagers in the neighbourhood of the\ncastle, devolved to Emmeline, when she was herself unable to make them.\n\nThe ignorant rustics, who had seen Emmeline grow up among them from her\nearliest infancy, and who now beheld her with the compassion as well as\nthe beauty of an angel, administering to their necessities and\nalleviating their misfortunes, looked upon her as a superior being, and\nthroughout the country she was almost adored.\n\nPerfectly unconscious of those attractions which now began to charm\nevery other eye, Emmeline had entered her sixteenth year; and the\nprogress of her understanding was equal to the improvement of her\nperson; which, tho' she was not perfectly handsome, could not be beheld\nat first without pleasure, and which the more it was seen became more\ninteresting and engaging.\n\nHer figure was elegant and graceful; somewhat exceeding the middling\nheight. Her eyes were blue; and her hair brown. Her features not very\nregular; yet there was a sweetness in her countenance, when she smiled,\nmore charming than the effect of the most regular features could have\ngiven. Her countenance, open and ingenuous, expressed every emotion of\nher mind: it had assumed rather a pensive cast; and tho' it occasionally\nwas lighted up by vivacity, had been lately frequently overclouded; when\nthe sufferings of her only friend called forth all the generous sympathy\nof her nature.\n\nAnd now the first severe misfortune she had known was about to overtake\nher. Early in the spring of that year, which was the sixteenth from her\nbirth, Mrs. Carey had felt an attack of the gout, which however was\nshort; and her health seemed for some time afterwards more settled than\nit had been for many months. She was one evening preparing to go down to\nthe village, leaning on the arm of Emmeline, when she suddenly\ncomplained of an acute pain in her head, and fell back into a chair. The\naffrighted girl called for assistance, and endeavoured by every means in\nher power to recover her, but it was impossible; the gout had seized her\nhead; and casting on Emmeline a look which seemed to express all she\nfelt at leaving her thus desolate and friendless, her venerable friend,\nafter a short struggle, breathed her last.\n\nWhat should Emmeline now do? In this distress (the first she had ever\nknown) how should she act? She saw, in the lifeless corpse before her,\nthe person on whom she had, from her first recollection, been accustomed\nto rely; who had provided for all her wants, and prevented every care\nfor herself. And now she was left to perform for this dear friend the\nlast sad offices, and knew not what would hereafter be her own lot.\n\nIn strong and excellent understandings there is, in every period of\nlife, a force which distress enables them to exert, and which prevents\ntheir sinking under the pressure of those evils which overwhelm and\nsubdue minds more feeble and unequal.\n\nThe spirits of Emmeline were yet unbroken by affliction, and her\nunderstanding was of the first rank. She possessed this native firmness\nin a degree very unusual to her age and sex. Instead therefore of giving\nway to tears and exclamations, she considered how she should best\nperform all she now could do for her deceased friend; and having seen\nevery proper care taken of her remains, and given orders for every thing\nrelative to them, with the solemn serenity of settled sorrow, she\nretired to her room, where she began to reflect on her irreparable loss,\nand the melancholy situation in which she was left; which she never had\ncourage to consider closely till it was actually before her.\n\nPainful indeed were the thoughts that now crouded on her mind;\nencreasing the anguish of her spirit for her recent misfortune. She\nconsidered herself as a being belonging to nobody; as having no right to\nclaim the protection of any one; no power to procure for herself the\nnecessaries of life. On the steward Maloney she had long looked with\ndisgust, from the assured and forward manner in which he thought proper\nto treat her. The freedom of his behaviour, which she could with\ndifficulty repress while Mrs. Carey lived, might now, she feared,\napproach to more insulting familiarity; to be exposed to which, entirely\nin his power, and without any female companion, filled her with the most\nalarming apprehensions: and the more her mind dwelt on that circumstance\nthe more she was terrified at the prospect before her; insomuch, that\nshe would immediately have quitted the house--But whither could she go?\n\nBy abruptly leaving the asylum Lord Montreville had hitherto allowed\nher, she feared she might forfeit all claim to his future protection:\nand, unknown as she was to the principal inhabitants of the country, who\nwere few, and their houses at a great distance, she could hardly hope to\nbe received by any of them.\n\nShe had therefore no choice left but to remain at the castle till she\nheard from Lord Montreville: and she determined to acquaint his Lordship\nof the death of Mrs. Carey, and desire to receive his commands as to\nherself.\n\nFatigued and oppressed, she retired to bed, but not to sleep. The image\nof her expiring protectress was still before her eyes; and if exhausted\nnature forced her to give way to a momentary forgetfulness, she soon\nstarted from her imperfect slumber, and fancied she heard the voice of\nMrs. Carey, calling on her for help; and her last groan still vibrated\nin her ears!--while the stillness of the night, interrupted only by the\ncries of the owls which haunted the ruins, added to the gloomy and\nmournful sensations of her mind.\n\nAt length however the sun arose--the surrounding objects lost the horror\nthat darkness and silence had lent them--and Emmeline fell into a short\nbut refreshing repose.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nAs soon as Emmeline arose the next morning, she addressed the following\nletter to Lord Montreville.\n\n\n  'My Lord,\n\n    'In the utmost affliction, I address myself to your\n  Lordship, to acquaint you with the death of Mrs. Carey, after an\n  illness of a very few moments: by which unhappy event I have lost a\n  friend who has indeed been a mother to me; and am now left at the\n  castle, ignorant of your Lordship's pleasure as to my future\n  residence.\n\n    'You will, my Lord, I doubt not, recollect that it is, at my time\n  of life, improper for me to reside here with Mr. Maloney; and if it\n  be your Lordship's intention for me to continue here, I hope you\n  will have the goodness to send down some proper person to fill the\n  place of the worthy woman I have lost.\n\n    'On your Lordship's humanity and consideration I depend for an\n  early answer: in which hope I have the honor to remain,\n\n                                                   your Lordship's\n                                    dutiful and most humble servant,\n                                                    EMMELINE MOWBRAY.'\n\n  _Mowbray Castle,_\n    _21st May._\n\n\nThe same post carried a letter from Mr. Maloney, informing Lord\nMontreville of the housekeeper's death, and desiring directions about\n_Miss_, as he elegantly termed Emmeline.\n\nTo these letters no answers were returned for upwards of a fortnight:\nduring which melancholy interval, Emmeline followed to the grave the\nremains of the friend of her infancy, and took a last farewel of the\nonly person who seemed interested for her welfare. Then returning with\nstreaming eyes to her own room, she threw herself on the bed, and gave\nway to a torrent of tears; for her spirits were overcome by the mournful\nscene to which she had just been a witness, and by the heavy forebodings\nof future sorrow which oppressed her heart.\n\nThe troublesome civilities of the steward Maloney, she soon found the\ndifficulty of evading. Fearful of offending him from whom she could not\nescape; yet unable to keep up an intercourse of civility with a man who\nwould interpret it into an encouragement of his presumptuous attentions,\nshe was compelled to make use of an artifice; and to plead ill health as\nan excuse for not dining as usual in the steward's room: and indeed her\nuneasiness and grief were such as hardly made it a pretence.\n\nAfter many days of anxious expectation, the following letter arrived\nfrom the house-steward of Lord Montreville; as on such an occasion his\nLordship did not think it necessary to write himself.\n\n\n                                   _Berkeley-Square_, _June_ 17, 17--\n\n  'Miss,\n    'My Lord orders me to acquaint you, that in consequence of your's\n  of the 21st ult. informing his Lordship of the old housekeeper's,\n  Mrs. Carey's, decease, he has directed Mrs. Grant, his Lordship's\n  town housekeeper, to look out for another; and Mrs. Grant has agreed\n  with a gentlewoman accordingly, who will be down at the castle\n  forthwith. My Lord is gone to Essex; but has directed me to let Mr.\n  Maloney know, that he is to furnish you with all things needful same\n  as before. By my Lord's command, from, Miss,\n\n                                           your very humble servant,\n                                                       RICHARD MADDOX.'\n\n\nWhile Emmeline waited the expected arrival of the person to whose care\nshe was now to be consigned, the sister of Mrs. Carey, who was the only\nrelation she had, sent a nephew of her husband's to take possession of\nwhat effects had belonged to her; in doing which, a will was found, in\nwhich she bequeathed fifty pounds as a testimony of her tender affection\nto 'Miss Emmeline Mowbray, the daughter of her late dear master;'\ntogether with all the contents of a small chest of drawers, which stood\nin her room.\n\nThe rest of her property, which consisted of her cloaths and about two\nhundred pounds, which she had saved in service, became her sister's, and\nwere delivered by Maloney to the young man commissioned to receive them.\n\nIn the drawers given to her, Emmeline found some fine linen and laces,\nwhich had belonged to her mother; and two little silk boxes covered with\nnuns embroidery, which seemed not to have been opened for many years.\n\nEmmeline saw that they were filled with letters: some of them in a hand\nwhich she had been shewn as her father's. But she left them uninspected,\nand fastened up the caskets; her mind being yet too much affected with\nher loss to be able to examine any thing which brought to her\nrecollection the fond solicitude of her departed friend.\n\nThe cold and mechanical terms in which the steward's letter was written,\nencreased all her uneasy fears as to her future prospects.\n\nLord Montreville seemed to feel no kindness for her; nor to give any\nconsideration to her forlorn and comfortless situation. The officious\nfreedoms of Maloney encreased so much, that she was obliged to confine\nherself almost entirely to her own room to avoid him; and she\ndetermined, that if after the arrival of the companion she expected, he\ncontinued to besiege her with so much impertinent familiarity, she would\nquit the house, tho' compelled to accept the meanest service for a\nsubsistence.\n\nAfter a fortnight of expectation, notice was received at the castle,\nthat Mrs. Garnet, the housekeeper, was arrived at the market town. The\nlabourer, with an horse, was dispatched for her, and towards evening she\nmade her entry.\n\nTo Emmeline, who had from her earliest remembrance been accustomed only\nto the plainest dress, and the most simple and sober manners, the figure\nand deportment of this woman appeared equally extraordinary.\n\nShe wore a travelling dress of tawdry-coloured silk, trimmed with bright\ngreen ribbands; and her head was covered with an immense black silk hat,\nfrom which depended many yellow streamers; while the plumage, with\nwhich it was plentifully adorned, hung dripping over her face, from the\neffects of a thunder shower thro' which she had passed. Her hair, tho'\ncarefully curled and powdered on her leaving London, had been also\ngreatly deranged in her journey, and descended, in knotty tufts of a\ndirty yellow, over her cheeks and forehead; adding to the vulgar\nferocity of a harsh countenance and a coarse complexion. Her figure was\nuncommonly tall and boney; and her voice so discordant and shrill, as to\npierce the ear with the most unpleasant sensation, and compleat the\ndisagreeable idea her person impressed.\n\nEmmeline saw her enter, handed by the officious Maloney; and repressing\nher astonishment, she arose, and attempted to speak to her: but the\ncontrast between the dirty, tawdry, and disgusting figure before her,\nand the sober plainness and neat simplicity of her lost friend, struck\nso forcibly on her imagination, that she burst into tears, and was\naltogether unable to command her emotion.\n\nThe steward having with great gallantry handed in the newly arrived\nlady, she thus began:\n\n'Oh! Lord a marcy on me!--to be shore I be got here at last! But indeed\nif I had a known whereabout I was a coming to, 'tis not a double the\nwagers as should a hired me. Lord! why what a ramshakel ould place it\nis!--and then such a monstrous long way from London! I suppose, Sir,'\n(to Maloney) 'as you be the steward; and you Miss, I reckon, be the\nyoung Miss as I be to have the care on. Why to be sure I did'nt much\nexpect to see a christian face in such an out of the way place. I don't\nb'leve I shall stay; howsomdever do let me have some tea; and do you,\nMiss, shew me whereabout I be to sleep.'\n\nEmmeline, struggling with her dislike, or at least desirous of\nconcealing it, did not venture to trust her voice with an answer; for\nher heart was too full; but stepping to the door, she called to the\nfemale servant, and ordered her to shew the lady her room. She had\nherself been used to share that appropriated to Mrs. Carey; but she now\nresolved to remove her bed into an apartment in one of the turrets of\nthe castle, which was the only unoccupied room not wholly exposed to the\nweather.\n\nThis little room had been sashed by Mrs. Mowbray on account of the\nbeautiful prospect it commanded between the hills, where suddenly\nsinking to the South West, they made way through a long narrow valley,\nfringed with copses, for a small but rapid river; which hurrying among\nimmense stones, and pieces of rock that seemed to have been torn from\nthe mountains by its violence, rushed into the sea at the distance of a\nmile from the castle.\n\nThis room, now for many years neglected, was much out of repair, but\nstill habitable; and tho' it was at a great distance from the rooms yet\noccupied, Emmeline chose rather to take up her abode in it, than partake\nof the apartment which was now to belong to Mrs. Garnet: and she found\nreason to applaud herself for this determination when she heard the\nexclamation Mrs. Garnet made on entering it--\n\n'Lord! why 'tis but a shabbyish place; and here is two beds I see. But\nthat won't suit me I asshore you. I chuses to have a room to myself, if\nit be ever so.'\n\n'Be not in any pain on that account, Madam,' said Emmeline, who had now\ncollected her thoughts; 'it is my intention to remove my bed, and I have\ndirected a person to do it immediately.'\n\nShe then returned into the steward's room, where Maloney thus addressed\nher--\n\n'Sarvent again, pretty Miss! Pray how d'ye like our new housekeeper? A\nsmartish piece of goods upon my word for Pembrokeshire; quite a London\nlady, eh, Miss?'\n\n'It is impossible for me, Sir, to judge of her yet.'\n\n'Why ay, Miss, as you justly observes, 'tis full early to know what\npeople be; but I hope we shall find her quite the thing; and if so be as\nshe's but good tempered, and agreeable, and the like, why I warrant we\nshall pass this here summer as pleasant as any thing can be. And now my\ndear Miss, perhaps, may'nt be so shy and distant, as she have got\nanother woman body to keep her company.'\n\nThis eloquent harangue was interrupted by the return of Mrs. Garnet,\nfull of anxiety for her tea; and in the bustle created by the desire of\nthe maid and Maloney to accommodate her, Emmeline retired to her new\napartment, where she was obliged to attend to the removal of her bed and\nother things; and excusing herself, under the pretence of fatigue, from\nreturning to the steward's room, she passed some time in melancholy\nrecollection and more melancholy anticipation, and then retired to rest.\n\nSome days passed in murmurs on the part of Mrs. Garnet, and in silence\non that of Emmeline; who, as soon as she had finished her short repasts,\nalways went to her own room.\n\nAfter a few weeks, she discovered that the lady grew every day more\nreconciled to her situation; and from the pleasures she apparently took\nin the gallantries of Maloney, and his constant assiduities to her, the\ninnocent Emmeline supposed there was really an attachment forming\nbetween them, which would certainly deliver her from the displeasing\nattentions of the steward.\n\nOccupied almost entirely by her books, of which she every day became\nmore enamoured, she never willingly broke in upon a t\u00c3\u00aate \u00c3\u00a0 t\u00c3\u00aate which\nshe fancied was equally agreeable to all parties; and she saw with\nsatisfaction that they regretted not her absence.\n\nBut the motives of Maloney's attention were misunderstood. Insensible as\nsuch a man must be supposed to the charms of the elegant and\nself-cultivated mind of Emmeline, her personal beauty had made a deep\nimpression on his heart; and he had formed a design of marrying her,\nbefore the death of Mrs. Carey, to whom he had once or twice mentioned\nsomething like a hint of his wishes: but she had received all his\ndiscourse on that topic with so much coldness, and ever so carefully\navoided any conversation that might again lead to it, that he had been\ndeterred from entirely explaining himself. Now, however, he thought the\ntime was arrived, when he might make a more successful application; for\nhe never doubted but that Mrs. Garnet would obtain, over the tender and\ningenuous mind of Emmeline, an influence as great as had been possessed\nby Mrs. Carey.\n\nNor did he apprehend that a friendless orphan, without fortune or\nconnections, would want much persuasion to marry a young man of handsome\nfigure (as he conceived himself to be,) who was established in a\nprofitable place, and had some dependance of his own.\n\nThe distance which Emmeline had always obliged him to observe, he\nimputed to the timidity of her nature; which he hoped would be lessened\nby the free and familiar manners of her present companion, whose\nconversation was very unlike what she had before been accustomed to hear\nfrom Mrs. Carey.\n\nImpressed with these ideas, he paid his court most assiduously to the\nhousekeeper, who put down all his compliments to the account of her own\nattractions; and was extremely pleased with her conquest; which she\nexhausted all her eloquence and all her wardrobe to secure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nIn this situation were the inhabitants of Mowbray Castle; when, in the\nbeginning of July, orders were received from Lord Montreville to set\nworkmen immediately about repairing the whole end of the castle which\nwas yet habitable; as his son, Mr. Delamere, intended to come down early\nin the Autumn, to shoot, for some weeks, in Wales. His Lordship added,\nthat it was possible he might himself be there also for a few weeks; and\ntherefore directed several bed-chambers to be repaired, for which he\nwould send down furniture from London.\n\nNo time was lost in obeying these directions. Workmen were immediately\nprocured, and the utmost expedition used to put the place in a situation\nto receive its master: while Emmeline, who foresaw that the arrival of\nLord Montreville would probably occasion some change in regard to\nherself, and who thought that every change must be for the better,\nbeheld these preparations with pleasure.\n\nAll had been ready some weeks, and the time fixed for Mr. Delamere's\njourney elapsed, but he had yet given no notice of his arrival.\n\nAt length, towards the middle of September, they were one evening\nalarmed by the noise of horses on the ascent to the castle.\n\nEmmeline retired to her own room, fearful of she knew not what; while\nMrs. Garnet and Maloney flew eagerly to the door; where a French valet,\nand an English groom with a led horse, presented themselves, and were\nushered into the old kitchen; the dimensions of which, blackened as it\nwas with the smoke of ages, and provided with the immense utensils of\nancient hospitality, failed not to amaze them both.\n\nThe Frenchman expressed his wonder and dislike by several grimaces; and\nthen addressing himself to Mrs. Garnet, exclaimed--'Peste! Milor\ncroit'il qu'on peut subsister dans cette espece d'enfer? Montr\u00c3\u00a9 moi les\napartements de Monsieur.'\n\n'Oh, your name is Mounseer, is it?' answered she--'Aye, I thought\nso--What would you please to have, Mounseer?'\n\n'Diable!' cried the distressed valet; 'voici une femme aussi sauvage que\nle lieu qu'elle habite. Com, com, you Jean Groom, speak littel to dis\nvoman pour moi.'\n\nWith the help of John, who had been some time used to his mode of\nexplaining himself, Mrs. Garnet understood that Mounseer desired to be\nshewn the apartments destined for his master, which he assiduously\nassisted in preparing; and then seeing the women busied in following his\ndirections, he attempted to return to his companion; but by missing a\nturning which should have carried him to the kitchen, he was bewildered\namong the long galleries and obscure passages of the castle, and after\nseveral efforts, could neither find his way back to the women, nor into\nthe kitchen; but continued to blunder about till the encreasing gloom,\nwhich approaching night threw over the arched and obscure apartments,\nthrough windows dim with painted glass, filled him with apprehension and\ndismay, and he believed he should wander there the whole night; in which\nfear he began to make a strange noise for assistance; to which nobody\nattended, for indeed nobody for some time heard him. His terror\nencreasing, he continued to traverse one of the passages, when a door at\nthe corner of it opened, and Emmeline came out.\n\nThe man, whose imagination was by this time filled with ideas of\nspectres, flew back at her sudden appearance, and added the contortions\nof fear to his otherwise grotesque appearance, in a travelling jacket of\nwhite cloth, laced, and his hair in papillotes.\n\nEmmeline, immediately comprehending that it was one of Mr. Delamere's\nservants, enquired what he wanted; and the man, reassured by her voice\nand figure, which there was yet light enough to discern, approached her,\nand endeavoured to explain that he had lost himself; in a language,\nwhich, though Emmeline did not understand, she knew to be French.\n\nShe walked with him therefore to the gallery which opened to the great\nstaircase, from whence he could hardly mistake his way; where having\npointed it to him, she turned back towards her own room.\n\nBut Millefleur, who had now had an opportunity to contemplate the person\nof his conductress, was not disposed so easily to part with her.\n\nBy the extreme simplicity of her dress, he believed her to be only some\nfair villager, or an assistant to the housekeeper; and therefore without\nceremony he began in broken English to protest his admiration, and\nseized her hand with an impertinent freedom extremely shocking to\nEmmeline.\n\nShe snatched it from him; and flying hastily back through those passages\nwhich all his courage did not suffice to make him attempt exploring\nagain, she regained her turret, the door of which she instantly locked\nand bolted; then breathless with fear and anger, she reflected on the\nstrange and unpleasant scene she had passed through, and felt greatly\nhumbled, to find that she was now likely to be exposed to the insolent\nfamiliarity of servants, from which she knew not whether the presence of\nthe master would protect her.\n\nWhile she suffered the anguish these thoughts brought with them,\nMillefleur travelled back to the kitchen; where he began an oration in\nhis own language on the beauty of the young woman he had met with.\n\nNeither Mrs. Garnet nor Maloney understood what he was saying; but John,\nwho had been in France, and knew a good deal of the language, told them\nthat he had seen a very pretty girl, in whose praise he was holding\nforth.\n\n'Why, Lord,' exclaimed Mrs. Garnet, 'tis our Miss as Mounseer means; I\nhad a quite forgot the child; I'll go call her; but howsomdever Mounseer\nwon't be able to get a word out of her; if she's a beauty I asshore you\n'tis a dumb beauty.'\n\nMaloney, by no means pleased with Millefleur's discovery, would\nwillingly have prevented the housekeeper's complaisance; but not knowing\nhow to do it, he was obliged to let her ascend to Emmeline, whose door\nshe found locked.\n\n'Miss! Miss!' cried she, rapping loudly, 'you must come down.'\n\n'Is my Lord or Mr. Delamere arrived?' enquired Emmeline.\n\n'No,' replied Mrs. Garnet, 'neither of em be'nt come yet; but here's my\nLord's waley de sham, and another sarvent, and you'll come down to tea\nto be sure.'\n\n'No,' said Emmeline, 'you must excuse me, Mrs. Garnet. I am not very\nwell; and if I were, should decline appearing to these people, with\nwhom, perhaps, it may not be my Lord's design that I should associate.'\n\n'People!' exclaimed Mrs. Garnet; 'as to people, I do suppose that for\nall one of them is a Frenchman, they be as good as other folks; and if I\nam agreeable to let them drink tea in my room, sure you, Miss, mid'nt be\nso squeamish. But do as you please; for my part I shan't court\nbeauties.'\n\nSo saying, the angry housekeeper descended to her companions, to whom\nshe complained of the pride and ill manners of Miss; while Maloney\nrejoiced at a reserve so favourable to the hopes he entertained.\n\nEmmeline determined to remain as much as possible in her own room, 'till\nLord Montreville or Mr. Delamere came, and then to solicit her removal.\n\nShe therefore continued positively to refuse to appear to the party\nbelow; and ordered the maid servant to bring her dinner into her own\nroom, which she never quitted 'till towards evening, to pursue her usual\nwalks.\n\nOn the third afternoon subsequent to the arrival of Mr. Delamere's\navant-couriers, Emmeline went down to the sea side, and seating herself\non a fragment of rock, fixed her eyes insensibly on the restless waves\nthat broke at her feet. The low murmurs of the tide retiring on the\nsands; the sighing of the wind among the rocks which hung over her head,\ncloathed with long grass and marine plants; the noise of the sea fowl\ngoing to their nests among the cliffs; threw her into a profound\nreverie.\n\nShe forgot awhile all her apprehended misfortunes, a sort of stupor took\npossession of her senses, and she no longer remembered how the time had\npassed there, which already exceeded two hours; though the moon, yet in\nits encrease, was arisen, and threw a long line of radience on the\nwater.\n\nThus lost in indistinct reflections, she was unconscious of the\nsurrounding objects, when the hasty tread of somebody on the pebbles\nbehind her, made her suddenly recollect herself; and though accustomed\nto be so much alone, she started in some alarm in remembering the late\nhour, and the solitary place where she was.\n\nA man approached her, in whom with satisfaction she recollected a young\npeasant of the village, who was frequently employed in messages from the\ncastle.\n\n'Miss Emmy,' said the lad, 'you are wanted at home; for there is my Lord\nhis own self, and the young Lord, and more gentlefolks come; so Madam\nGarnet sent me to look for you all about.'\n\nEmmeline, hurried by this intelligence, walked hastily away with the\nyoung villager, and soon arrived at the castle.\n\nThe wind had blown her beautiful hair about her face, and the glow of\nher cheeks was heightened by exercise and apprehension. A more lovely\nfigure than she now appeared could hardly be imagined. She had no time\nto reflect on the interview; but hastened immediately into the parlour\nwhere Lord Montreville was sitting with his son; Mr. Fitz-Edward, who\nwas a young officer, his friend, distantly related to the family; and\nMr. Headly, a man celebrated for his knowledge of rural improvements,\nwhom Lord Montreville had brought down to have his opinion of the\npossibility of rendering Mowbray Castle a residence fit for his family\nfor a few months in the year.\n\nLord Montreville was about five and forty years old. His general\ncharacter was respectable. He had acquitted himself with honor in the\nsenate; and in private life had shewn great regularity and good conduct.\nBut he had basked perpetually in the sunshine of prosperity; and his\nfeelings, not naturally very acute, were blunted by having never\nsuffered in his own person any uneasiness which might have taught him\nsensibility for that of others.\n\nTo this cause it was probably owing, that he never reflected on the\nimpropriety of receiving his niece before strangers; and that he ordered\nEmmeline to be introduced into the room where they were all sitting\ntogether.\n\nHaving once seen Emmeline a child of five or six years old; he still\nformed an idea of her as a child; and adverted not to the change that\nalmost nine years had made in her person and manners; it was therefore\nwith some degree of surprize, that instead of the child he expected, he\nsaw a tall, elegant young woman, whose air, though timidity was the most\nconspicuous in it, had yet much of dignity and grace, and in whose face\nhe saw the features of his brother, softened into feminine beauty.\n\nThe apathy which prosperity had taught him, gave way for a moment to his\nsurprize at the enchanting figure of his niece.\n\nHe arose, and approached her. 'Miss Mowbray! how amazingly you are\ngrown! I am glad to see you.' He took her hand; while Emmeline,\ntrembling and blushing, endeavoured to recollect herself, and said--\n\n'I thank you, my Lord, and I am happy in having an opportunity of paying\nmy respects to your Lordship.'\n\nHe led her to a seat, and again repeated his wonder to find her so much\ngrown.\n\nDelamere, who had been standing at the fire conversing with Fitz-Edward,\nnow advanced, and desired his father to introduce him; which ceremony\nbeing passed, he drew a chair close to that in which Emmeline was\nplaced; and fixing his eyes on her face with a look of admiration and\nenquiry that extremely abashed her, he seemed to be examining the\nbeauties of that lovely and interesting countenance which had so\nimmediately dazzled and surprized him.\n\nFitz-Edward, a young soldier, related to the family of Lady Montreville,\nwas almost constantly the companion of Delamere, and had expectations\nthat the interest Lord Montreville possessed would be exerted to advance\nhim in his profession. His manner was very insinuating, and his person\nuncommonly elegant. He affected to be a judge as well as an admirer of\nbeauty, and seemed to behold with approbation the fair inhabitant of the\ncastle; who, with heightened blushes, and averted looks, waited in\nsilence 'till Lord Montreville should again address her, which he at\nlength did.\n\n'I was sorry, Miss Mowbray, to hear of the death of old Carey.'\n\nThe tears started into the eyes of Emmeline.\n\n'She was an excellent servant, and served the family faithfully many\nyears.'\n\nPoor Emmeline felt the tears fall on her bosom.\n\n'But however she was old; and had been, I suppose, long infirm. I hope\nthe person who now fills her place has supplied it to your\nsatisfaction?'\n\n'Ye--s, yes, my lord;' inarticulately sobbed Emmeline, quite overcome by\nthe mention of her old friend.\n\n'I dare say she does,' resumed his Lordship; 'for Grant, of whom Lady\nMontreville has a very high opinion, assured her Ladyship she was well\nrecommended.'\n\nEmmeline now found her emotion very painful; she therefore rose to go,\nand curtseying to Lord Montreville, tried to wish him good night.\n\n'A good night to you, Miss Mowbray,' said he, rising. Delamere started\nfrom his chair; and taking her hand, desired to have the honor of\nconducting her to her room. But this was a gallantry his father by no\nmeans approved. 'No, Frederic,' said he, taking himself the hand he\nheld, 'you will give _me_ leave to see Miss Mowbray to the door.' He led\nher thither, and then bowing, wished her again good night.\n\nEmmeline hurried to her room; where she endeavoured to recollect her\ndissipated spirits, and to consider in what way it would be proper for\nher to address Lord Montreville the next day, to urge her request of a\nremoval from the castle.\n\nMrs. Carey had a sister who resided at Swansea in Glamorganshire; where\nher husband had a little place in the excise, and where she had a small\nhouse, part of which she had been accustomed to let to those who\nfrequented the place for the benefit of sea-bathing.\n\nShe was old, and without any family of her own; and Emmeline, to whom\nshe was the more agreeable as being the sister of Mrs. Carey, thought\nshe might reside with her with propriety and comfort, if Lord\nMontreville would allow her a small annual stipend for her cloaths and\nboard.\n\nWhile she was considering in what manner to address herself to his\nLordship the next day, the gentlemen were talking of the perfections of\nthe nymph of the castle; by which name Delamere toasted her at supper.\n\nLord Montreville, who did not seem particularly delighted with the\npraise his son so warmly bestowed, said--\n\n'Why surely, Frederic, you are uncommonly eloquent on behalf of your\nWelch cousin.'\n\n'Faith, my Lord,' answered Delamere, 'I like her so well that I think\nit's a little unlucky I did not come alone. My Welch cousin is the very\nthing for a t\u00c3\u00aate \u00c3\u00a0 t\u00c3\u00aate.'\n\n'Yes,' said Lord Montreville, carelessly, 'she is really grown a good\nfine young woman. Don't you think so, George?' addressing himself to\nFitz-Edward.\n\n'I do indeed, my Lord,' answered he; 'and here's Mr. Headly, tho' an old\nmarried man, absolutely petrified with admiration.'\n\n'Upon my soul, Headly,' continued Delamere, 'I already begin to see\ngreat capabilities about this venerable mansion. I think I shall take to\nit, as my father offers it me; especially as I suppose Miss Emmeline is\nto be included in the inventory.'\n\n'Come, come, Frederic,' said Lord Montreville, gravely, 'no light\nconversation on the subject of Miss Mowbray. She is under my care; and I\nmust have her treated with propriety.'\n\nHis Lordship immediately changed the discourse, and soon after\ncomplaining of being fatigued, retired to his chamber.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nLord Montreville, whose first object was his son, had observed, with\nsome alarm, the immediate impression he seemed to have received from the\nbeauty of Emmeline.\n\nThe next day, he made some farther remarks on his attention to her when\nthey met at dinner, which gave him still more uneasiness; and he accused\nhimself of great indiscretion in having thrown an object, whose\nloveliness he could not help acknowledging, in the way of Delamere,\nwhose ardent and impetuous temper he knew so well. This gave his\nbehaviour to Emmeline an air of coldness, and even of displeasure, which\nprevented her summoning courage to speak to him in the morning of the\nday after his arrival: and the evening afforded her no opportunity; for\nLord Montreville, determined to keep her as much as possible out of the\nsight of Delamere, did not send for her down to supper, and had\nprivately resolved to remove her as soon as possible to some other\nresidence.\n\nThus his apprehensions lest his son should form an attachment\nprejudicial to his ambitious views, produced in his Lordship's mind a\nresolution in regard to placing more properly his orphan niece, which no\nconsideration, had it related merely to herself, would probably have\neffected.\n\nAt supper, Delamere enquired eagerly for his 'lovely cousin.' To which\nLord Montreville drily answered, 'that she did not, he believed, sup\nbelow.'\n\nBut the manner of this enquiry, and the anxious looks Delamere directed\ntowards the door, together with his repeated questions, increased all\nLord Montreville's fears.\n\nHe went to bed out of humour rather with himself than his son; and\nrising early the next morning, enquired for Miss Mowbray.\n\nMiss Mowbray was walked out, as was her custom, very early, no one knew\nwhither.\n\nHe learned also that Mr. Delamere was gone out with his gun without\nFitz-Edward; who not being very fond of field sports, had agreed to join\nhim at a later hour.\n\nHe immediately fancied that Delamere and Emmeline might meet; and the\npain such a suspicion brought with it, was by him, who had hardly ever\nfelt an hour's uneasiness, considered as so great an evil, that he\ndetermined to put an end to it as soon as possible.\n\nAfter an hasty breakfast in his own room, he summoned Maloney to attend\nhim, and went over the accounts of the estates entrusted to him, with\nthe state of which his Lordship declared himself well contented. And not\nknowing to whom else he could apply, to enquire for a situation for\nEmmeline, he told Maloney, that as Miss Mowbray was now of an age to\nrequire some alteration in her mode of life, he was desirous of finding\nfor her a reputable house in some town in Wales, where she might lodge\nand board.\n\nMaloney, encouraged by being thus consulted by his Lord, ventured, with\nmany bows, blushes, and stammering apologies, to disclose to Lord\nMontreville his partiality to Miss Mowbray.\n\nAnd this communication he so contrived to word, that his Lordship had no\ndoubt of Emmeline's having allowed him to make it.\n\nLord Montreville listened therefore in silence, and without any marks of\ndisapprobation, to the account Maloney proceeded to give of his\nprospects and property.\n\nWhile he was doing so, family pride made a faint struggle in his\nLordship's breast on behalf of his deserted ward. He felt some pain in\ndetermining, that a creature boasting a portion of the Mowbray blood,\nshould sink into the wife of a man of such inferior birth as Maloney.\n\nBut when the advantages of so easily providing for her were recollected;\nwhen he considered that Maloney would be happy to take her with a few\nhundred pounds, and that all apprehensions in regard to his son would by\nthat means for ever be at an end; avarice and ambition, two passions\nwhich too much influenced Lord Montreville, joined to persuade him of\nthe propriety of the match; and became infinitely too powerful to let\nhim listen to his regard to the memory of his brother or his pity for\nhis deserted ward.\n\nHe thought, that as the existence of Emmeline was hardly known beyond\nthe walls of the castle, he should incur no censure from the world if he\nconsigned her to that obscurity to which the disadvantages of her birth\nseemed originally to have condemned her.\n\nThese reflections arose while Maloney, charmed to find himself listened\nto, was proceeding in his discourse.\n\nLord Montreville, tho' too much used to the manners of politicians to be\nable to give a direct answer, at length put an end to it, by telling him\nhe would consider of what he had said, and talk to him farther in a few\ndays.\n\nIn the mean time his Lordship desired that no part of their conversation\nmight transpire.\n\nMaloney, transported at a reception which seemed to prognosticate the\ncompletion of his wishes, retired elated with his prospects; and Lord\nMontreville summoning Mr. Headly to attend him, mounted his horse to\nsurvey the ground on which he meditated improvements round the castle.\n\nThe cold and almost stern civility of Lord Montreville, for the little\ntime Emmeline had seen him, had created despondence and uneasiness in\nher bosom.\n\nShe fancied he disliked her, unoffending as she was, and would take the\nfirst opportunity of shaking her off: an idea which, together with the\nawe she could not help feeling in his presence, made her determine as\nmuch as possible to avoid it, 'till he should give her a proper\nopportunity to speak to him, or 'till she could acquire courage to seek\nit.\n\nAt seven in the morning, she arose, after an uneasy night, and having\ntaken an early breakfast, betook herself to her usual walk, carrying\nwith her a book.\n\nThe sun was hot, and she went to a wood which partly cloathed an high\nhill near the boundary of the estate, where, intent only on her own\nsorrows, she could not beguile them by attending to the fictitious and\nimprobable calamities of the heroine of a novel, which Mrs. Garnet\n(probably forgetting to restore it to the library of some former\nmistress,) had brought down among her cloaths, and which had been seized\nby Emmeline as something new, at least to her.\n\nBut her mind, overwhelmed with its own anxiety, refused its attention:\nand tired with her walk, she sat down on a tree that had been felled,\nreflecting on what had passed since Lord Montreville's arrival, and\nconsidering how she might most effectually interest him in her behalf.\n\nDelamere, attended by a servant, had gone upon the hills in pursuit of\nhis game; and having had great success for some hours, he came down\nabout eleven o'clock into the woods, to avoid the excessive heat, which\nwas uncommon for the season.\n\nThe noise he made in brushing through the underwood with his gun, and\nrustling among the fading leaves, alarmed her.\n\nHe stepped over the timber, and seating himself by her, seized her\nhands.\n\n'Oh! my charming cousin,' cried he, 'I think myself one of the most\nfortunate fellows on earth, thus to meet you.'\n\nEmmeline would have risen.\n\n'Oh! no,' continued he, 'indeed you do not go, 'till we have had a\nlittle conversation.'\n\n'I cannot stay, indeed Sir,' said Emmeline--. 'I must immediately go\nhome.'\n\n'By no means; I cannot part with you.--Come, come, sit down and hear\nwhat I have to say.'\n\nIt was to no purpose to resist. The impetuous vehemence of Delamere was\ntoo much for the timid civility of Emmeline; and not believing that any\nthing more than common conversation or a few unmeaning compliments would\npass, she sat down with as much composure as she could command.\n\nBut Delamere, who was really captivated at the first, and who now\nthought her more beautiful than he had done in their former interviews,\nhesitated not to pour forth the most extravagant professions of\nadmiration, in a style so unequivocal, that Emmeline, believing he meant\nto insult her, burst into a passion of tears, and besought him, in a\ntremulous and broken voice, not to be so cruel as to affront her, but to\nsuffer her to return home.\n\nDelamere could not see her terror without being affected. He protested,\nthat so far from meaning to give her pain, he should think himself too\nhappy if she would allow him to dedicate his whole life to her service.\n\nPoor Emmeline, however, continued to weep, and to beseech him to let her\ngo; to which, as her distress arose almost to agony, he at length\nconsented: and taking her arm within his, he said he would walk home\nwith her himself.\n\nTo this Emmeline in vain objected. To escape was impossible. To prevail\non him to leave her equally so. She was therefore compelled to follow\nhim. Which she did with reluctance; while he still continued to profess\nto her the most violent and serious attachment. They proceeded in this\nmanner along the nearest path to the castle, which lay principally among\ncopses that fringed the banks of the river. They had just passed through\nthe last, and entered the meadows which lay immediately under the castle\nwalls, when Lord Montreville and Headly, on horseback, appeared from a\nwoody lane just before them.\n\nAt the noise of horses so near them, Emmeline looked up, and seeing\nLord Montreville, again struggled, but without success, to disengage her\nhand.\n\nDelamere continued to walk on, and his Lordship soon came up to them. He\nchecked his horse, and said, somewhat sternly, 'So, Sir, where have you\nbeen?'\n\nDelamere, without the least hesitation, answered--'Shooting, my Lord,\nthe early part of the morning; and since that, making love to my cousin,\nwho was so good as to sit and wait for me under a tree.'\n\n'For mercy's sake, Mr. Delamere,' cried Emmeline, 'consider what you\nsay.'\n\n'Waiting for you under a tree!' cried Lord Montreville, in amazement.\n'Do Miss Mowbray be so good as to return home.--And you, Frederic, will,\nI suppose, be back by dinner time.'\n\n'Yes,' answered Delamere, 'when I have conducted my cousin home, I shall\ngo out again, perhaps, for an hour before dinner.'\n\nHe was then walking on, without noticing the stern and displeased looks\nof his father, or the terror of poor Emmeline, who saw too evidently\nthat Lord Montreville was extremely angry.\n\nHis Lordship, after a moment's pause, dismounted, gave his horse to a\nservant, and joined them, telling Delamere he had some business with\nMiss Mowbray, and would therefore walk with her towards the castle\nhimself.\n\nDelamere kissed her hand gayly, and assuring his father that for the\nfirst time in his life he felt an inclination to take his business off\nhis hands, he beckoned to his servant to follow with his dogs, and then\nleaping over the hedge that separated the meadow from the hollow lane,\nhe disappeared.\n\nEmmeline, trembling with apprehension, walked with faultering steps by\nthe side of Lord Montreville, who for some time was silent. He at length\nsaid--'Your having been brought up in retirement, Miss Mowbray, has,\nperhaps, prevented your being acquainted with the decorums of the world,\nand the reserve which a young woman should ever strictly maintain. You\nhave done a very improper thing in meeting my son; and I must desire\nthat while you are at the castle, no such appointments may take place in\nfuture.'\n\nTho' she saw, from the first moment of his meeting them, that he had\nconceived this idea, and was confirmed in it by Delamere's speech; yet\nshe was so much shocked and hurt by the address, that as she attempted\nto answer, her voice failed her.\n\nThe tears however, which streamed from her eyes, having a little\nrelieved her, she endeavoured to assure his Lordship, that till she met\nMr. Delamere in the wood that morning, she did not know even of his\nhaving left the castle.\n\n'And how happened you to be where he found you, Miss Mowbray?'\n\n'I went thither, my Lord, with a book which I was eager to finish.'\n\n'Oh! I remember that Maloney told me you was a great reader; and from\nsome other discourse he held relative to you, I own I was the more\nsurprised at your indiscretion in regard to my son.'\n\nThey were by this time arrived at the castle, and Lord Montreville\ndesired Emmeline to follow him into the parlour, where they both sat\ndown.\n\nHis Lordship renewed the discourse.\n\n'This morning Maloney has been talking to me about you; and from what he\nsaid, I concluded you had formed with him engagements which should have\nprevented you from listening to the boyish and improper conversation of\nMr. Delamere.'\n\n'Engagements with Mr. Maloney, my Lord? Surely he could never assert\nthat I have ever formed engagements with him?'\n\n'Why not absolutely so.--I think he did not say that. But I understood\nthat you was by no means averse to his informing me of his attachment,\nand was willing, if my consent was obtained, to become his wife. Perhaps\nhe has no very great advantages; yet considering your situation, which\nis, you know, entirely dependent, I really think you do perfectly right\nin designing to accept of the establishment he offers you.'\n\n'To become the wife of Maloney!--to accept of the establishment _he_\noffers me! I am humbled, I am lost indeed! No, my Lord! unhappy as I am,\nI can _claim_ nothing, it is true; but if the support of an unfortunate\norphan, thrown by Providence into your care, is too troublesome, suffer\nme to be myself a servant; and believe I have a mind, which tho' it will\nnot recoil from any situation where I can earn my bread by honest\nlabour, is infinitely superior to any advantages such a man as Maloney\ncan offer me!'\n\nShe wept too much to be able to proceed; and sat, overwhelmed with grief\nand mortification, while Lord Montreville continued to speak.\n\n'Why distress yourself in this manner, Miss Mowbray? I cannot see any\nthing which ought to offend you, if Maloney _has_ misrepresented the\nmatter, and if he has not, your extraordinary emotion must look like a\nconsciousness of having altered your mind.\n\n'Your motive for doing so cannot be mistaken; but let me speak to you\nexplicitly.--To Mr. Delamere, _my_ son, the heir to a title and estate\nwhich makes him a desirable match for the daughters of the first houses\nin the kingdom, _you_ can have no pretensions; therefore never do\nyourself so much prejudice as to let your mind glance that way.\n\n'Maloney tells me he has some property, and still better expectations.\nHe is established here in an excellent place; and should he marry you,\nit shall be still more advantageous. You are (I am sorry to be obliged\nto repeat it) without any dependance, but on my favour. You will\ntherefore do wisely to embrace a situation in which that favour may be\nmost effectually exerted on your behalf.\n\n'As you have undoubtedly encouraged Maloney, the aversion you now\npretend towards him, is artifice or coquetry. Consider before you\ndecide, consider thoroughly what is your situation and what your\nexpectations; and recollect, that as my son now means to be very\nfrequently at Mowbray Castle, _you_ cannot remain with propriety but as\nthe wife of Maloney.'\n\n'Neither as the wife of Maloney, nor as Emmeline Mowbray, will I stay,\nmy Lord, another day!' answered she, assuming more spirit than she had\nyet shewn. 'I wished for an interview to entreat your Lordship would\nallow me to go to some place less improper for my abode than Mowbray\nCastle has long been.'\n\n'And whither would you go, Miss Mowbray?'\n\n'On that, my Lord, I wished to consult you. But since it is perhaps a\nmatter unworthy your attention; since it seems to signify little what\nbecomes of me; I must determine to hazard going to Mrs. Watkins's, who\nwill probably give me an asylum at least 'till I can find some one who\nwill receive me, or some means of providing for myself the necessaries\nof life.'\n\n'You then positively reject the overtures of Maloney?'\n\n'Positively, my Lord--and for ever! I beg it may not be mentioned to me\nagain!'\n\n'And who is Mrs. Watkins?'\n\n'The sister of Mrs. Carey, my Lord.'\n\n'Where does she live?'\n\n'At Swansea in Glamorganshire; where she is accustomed to take in\nboarders. She would, I believe, receive me.'\n\nAfter a moment's consideration, Lord Montreville said, 'that perhaps may\ndo, since you absolutely refuse the other plan; I would have you\ntherefore prepare to go thither; but I must insist on no more morning\ninterviews with Mr. Delamere, and that whither you are going may be kept\nunknown to him. But tell me,' continued he, 'what I am to say to poor\nMaloney?'\n\n'That you are astonished at his insolence in daring to lift his eyes to\na person bearing the name of Mowbray; and shocked at his falsehood in\npresuming to assert that I ever encouraged his impertinent pretensions!'\n\nThis effort of spirit exhausted all the courage Emmeline had been able\nto raise. She arose, and attempted to reach the door; but overcome by\nthe violence of her agitation, was obliged to sit down in a chair near\nit.\n\nShe could no longer restrain the tears which were extorted from her by\nthe mortifying scene she had passed through: and her deep sighs, which\nseemed ready to burst her heart, excited the compassion of Lord\nMontreville; who, where his ambition was not in question, was not void\nof humanity. The violent and artless sorrow of a beautiful young woman,\nwhose fate seemed to be in his power, affected him.\n\nHe took her hand with kindness, and told her 'he was sorry to have said\nany thing that appeared harsh.'\n\nHis Lordship added, 'that he would have her write to Mrs. Watkins; that\na servant should be sent with the letter; and that on condition of her\nconcealing her abode from Delamere, she should be supplied with an\nannual income equal to all her wants.'\n\nThen hearing Delamere's gun, which he always discharged before he\nentered the house, he hastened Emmeline away, desiring she would remain\nin her own apartment; where every thing necessary should be sent to\nher.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nDelamere and Fitz-Edward soon after entered the parlour where Lord\nMontreville remained. He received his son with a coldness to which, tho'\nlittle accustomed to it, Delamere paid no attention.\n\nDespotic as this beloved son had always been in the family, he felt not\nthe least apprehension that he had really offended his father; or\nfeeling it, knew that his displeasure would be so short liv'd that it\nwas not worth any concern.\n\n'Here, Fitz-Edward,' said he--'here is my father angry with me for\nmaking love to my cousin Emmy. Faith, Sir,' (turning to Lord\nMontreville,) 'I think I have the most reason to be angry at being\nbrought into such dangerous company; tho' your Lordship well knows how\ndevilishly susceptible I am, and that ever since I was ten years old I\nhave been dying for some nymph or other.'\n\n'I know that you are a strange inconsiderate boy,' answered Lord\nMontreville, very gravely;--'but I must beg, Frederic, to hear no more\nidle raillery on the subject of Miss Mowbray.'\n\nTo this, Delamere gave some slight answer; and the discourse was led by\nhis Lordship to some other topic.\n\nFitz-Edward, who was about five years older than Delamere, concealed,\nunder the appearance of candour and non-chalance, the libertinism of his\ncharacter. He had entered very young into the army; the younger son of\nan Irish peer; and had contracted his loose morals by being thrown too\nearly into the world; for his heart was not originally bad.\n\nWith a very handsome person, he had the most insinuating manners, and an\naddress so truly that of a man of fashion, as immediately prejudiced in\nhis favour those by whom he wished to be thought well of. Where he\ndesired to please, he seldom failed of pleasing extremely; and his\nconversation was, in the general commerce of the world, elegant and\nattractive.\n\nDelamere was very fond of his company; and Lord Montreville encouraged\nthe intimacy: for of whatever fashionable vices Fitz-Edward was guilty,\nhe contrived, by a sort of sentimental hypocrisy, to prevent their being\nknown to, or at least offensive to those, whose good opinion it was his\ninterest to cultivate.\n\nDelamere was of a character very opposite. Accustomed from his infancy\nto the most boundless indulgences, he never formed a wish, the\ngratification of which he expected to be denied: and if such a\ndisappointment happened, he gave way to an impetuosity of disposition\nthat he had never been taught to restrain, and which gave an appearance\nof ferocity to a temper not otherwise bad.\n\nHe was generous, candid, and humane; and possessed many other good\nqualities, but the defects of his education had obscured them.\n\nLady Montreville, who beheld in her only son the last male heir of a\nvery ancient and illustrious house, and who hoped to see all its glories\nrevive in him, could never be prevailed upon to part with him. He had\ntherefore a tutor in the house; and his parents themselves accompanied\nhim abroad. And the weakness of Lady Montreville in regard to her son,\nencreased rather than diminished with his encreasing years.\n\nHer fondness was gratified in seeing the perfections of his person,\n(which was a very fine one) while to the imperfections of his temper she\nwas entirely blind.\n\nHis father was equally fond of him; and looked up to the accumulated\ntitles and united fortunes of his own and his wife's families, as the\npoint where all his ambitious views would attain their consummation.\n\nTo watch over the conduct of this only son, seemed now to be the sole\nbusiness of his Lordship's life: and 'till now, he had no reason to fear\nthat his solicitude for his final establishment would be attended with\nso little effect. Except a few youthful indiscretions, which were\noverlooked or forgiven, Delamere had shewn no inclinations that seemed\ninimical to his father's views; and Lord Montreville hoped that his\npresent passion for Emmeline would be forgotten as easily as many other\ntransient attachments which his youth, and warmth of temper, had led him\ninto.\n\nAt dinner, Delamere enquired 'whether his charming cousin was always to\nremain a prisoner in her own room?'\n\nTo which Lord Montreville answered, 'that it had been her custom; and as\nthere was no lady with them, it was better she should continue it.'\n\nHe then changed the discourse; and contrived to keep Delamere in sight\nthe whole afternoon; and by that means prevented any further enquiries\nafter Emmeline; who now, entirely confined to her turret, impatiently\nawaited the return of the messenger who had been sent to Swansea.\n\nDelamere, in the mean time, had lingered frequently about the\nhousekeeper's room, in hopes of seeing Emmeline; but she never appeared.\n\nHe applied to Mrs. Garnet for intelligence of her: but she had received\norders from Lord Montreville not to satisfy his enquiries. He employed\nhis servants therefore to discover where she was usually to be found,\nand by their means was at length informed in what part of the castle her\napartment lay; and that there was a design actually on foot to send her\naway, but whither he could not learn.\n\nThe answer brought from Mrs. Watkins, by the man who had been sent to\nSwansea, expressed her readiness to take the boarder offered her.\n\nThis intelligence Lord Montreville communicated himself to Emmeline; who\nreceived it with such artless satisfaction, that his Lordship, who had\nbefore doubted whether some degree of coquetry was not concealed under\nthe apparent ingenuous innocence of his niece, now believed he had\njudged too hastily.\n\nIt remained to be considered how she could be conveyed from Mowbray\nCastle without the knowledge of Delamere. She was herself ignorant of\nevery thing beyond its walls, and could therefore be of no use in the\nconsultation. His Lordship had, however, entrusted Fitz-Edward with his\nuneasiness about Delamere; at which the former only laughed; and said he\nby no means believed that any serious consequences were to be\napprehended: that it was mere badinage; of which he was sure Delamere\nwould think no more after they left Mowbray Castle; and that it was not\na matter which his Lordship should allow to make him uneasy.\n\nLord Montreville however, who thought he could not too soon remedy his\nown indiscretion in introducing Emmeline to his son, determined to\nembrace the opportunity of putting an end to any future correspondence\nbetween them: he therefore insisted on a promise of secresy from\nFitz-Edward; and had recourse to Headly, who from a frequent residence\namong the great was the most accommodating and obsequious of their\nservants.\n\nAs he was about to leave the castle in a few days, he offered his\nservices to convey Miss Mowbray from thence, in a chaise of which he was\nmaster. This proposal was eagerly accepted by Lord Montreville. And\nenjoining Mr. Headly also to secresy, it was fixed that their journey\nshould begin the next morning save one.\n\nEmmeline had notice of this arrangement, which she received with the\nliveliest joy. She immediately set about such preparations as were\nnecessary for her journey, in which she employed that and the remaining\nday; which had been destined by Lord Montreville to visit another estate\nthat he possessed, at the distance of about twelve miles; whither\nDelamere and the whole party accompanied him.\n\nDelamere had discovered, by his servants, that to remove Emmeline was in\nagitation; and he determined to see her again in spite of his father's\nprecaution (which in fact only served to encrease his desire of\ndeclaring his sentiments); but he had no idea that she was to depart so\nsoon, and therefore was content to go with his father, at his particular\nrequest.\n\nIt was late in the evening preceding that on which Emmeline was to leave\nthe castle, before they returned to it; and she was still busied in\nproviding for her journey; in doing which, she was obliged to open one\nof the caskets left her by Mrs. Carey. It contained miniatures of her\nfather and her mother, which had been drawn at Paris before her birth;\nand several letters written by Mrs. Mowbray, her grandmother, to her\nmother, in consequence of the fatal step she had taken in quitting the\nprotection of that lady, who had brought her up, to accompany Mr.\nMowbray abroad.\n\nThese, Emmeline had never yet seen; nor had she now courage entirely to\nperuse them. The little she read, however, filled her heart with the\nmost painful sensations and her eyes with tears.\n\nWhile she was employed in her little arrangements, time passed\ninsensibly away. She heard the hollow sound of shutting the great doors\nat the other end of the castle, as was usual before the servants retired\nfor the night: but attentive only to what was at present her greatest\nconcern, (making room for some favourite books in the box she meant to\ntake with her,) she heeded not the hour.\n\nA total silence had long reigned in the castle, and her almost\nextinguished candle told her it was time to take some repose, when, as\nshe was preparing to do so, she thought she heard a rustling, and\nindistinct footsteps in the passage near her room.\n\nShe started--listened--but all was again profoundly silent; and she\nsupposed it had been only one of those unaccountable noises which she\nhad been used to hear along the dreary avenues of the castle. She began\nanew to unpin her hair, when a second time the same noise in the passage\nalarmed her. She listened again; and while she continued attentive, the\ngreat clock struck two.\n\nAmazed to find it so late, her terror encreased; yet she endeavoured to\nreason herself out of it, and to believe that it was the effect of\nfancy: she heard it no more; and had almost determined to go out into\nthe passage to satisfy herself that her fears were groundless, when just\nas she approached the door, the whispers were renewed; she saw the lock\nmove, and heard a violent push against it.\n\nThe door, however, was locked. Which was no sooner perceived by the\nassailant, than a violent effort with his foot forced the rusty decayed\nwork to give way, and Mr. Delamere burst into the room!\n\nEmmeline was infinitely too much terrified to speak: nor could her\ntrembling limbs support her. She sat down;--the colour forsook her\ncheeks;--and she was not sensible that Delamere had thrown himself at\nher feet, and was pouring forth the most vehement and incoherent\nexpressions that frantic passion could dictate.\n\nRecovering her recollection, she beheld Delamere kneeling before her,\nholding her hands in his; and Millefleur standing behind him with a\ncandle. She attempted to speak; but the words died away on her lips:\nwhile Delamere, shocked at the situation into which he had thrown her,\nprotested that he meant her not the smallest offence; but that having\nlearnt, by means of his valet, that she was to go the next morning, and\nthat his father intended to keep him ignorant of her future destiny, he\ncould not bear to reflect that he might lose her for ever; and had\ntherefore taken the only means in his power to speak to her, in hopes of\nengaging her pity, for which he would hazard every thing.\n\n'Leave me, Sir! leave me!' said Emmeline, in a voice scarcely\narticulate. 'Leave me instantly, or I will alarm the house!'\n\n'That is almost impossible!' replied Delamere; 'but I will not terrify\nyou more than I have done already. No, Emmeline, I wish not to alarm\nyou, and will quit you instantly if you will tell me that wheresoever\nyou are, you will permit me to see you; and will remember me with pity\nand regard! My father shall not--cannot controul my conduct; nor shall\nall the power on earth prevent my following you, if you will yourself\npermit me. Tell me, Emmeline,--tell me you will not forget me!'\n\n'As what, Sir, should I remember you, but as my persecutor? as one who\nhas injured me beyond reparation by your wild and cruel conduct; and who\nhas now dared to insult me by a most unparallelled outrage.--Leave me,\nSir! I repeat to you that you must instantly quit the room!'\n\nShe arose, and walked with tottering steps to the end of it. Delamere\nfollowed her. She turned; and came towards the door, which was still\nopen, and then recollected, that as she knew the passages of the castle,\nwhich she was convinced neither Delamere or his servant did, she might\npossibly escape, and find Lord Montreville's room, which she knew to be\nat the end of the East gallery.\n\nDelamere was a few steps behind her when she reached the door; which\nhastily throwing quite open, she ran lightly thro' the passage, which\nwas very long and dark.\n\nHe pursued her, imploring her to hear him but a moment; and the\nFrenchman as hastily followed his master with the candle. But at the end\nof the passage, a flight of broken steps led to a brick hall, which\nopened to other stair-cases and galleries.\n\nA gust of wind blew out the candle; and Emmeline, gliding down the\nsteps, turned to the right, and opening a heavy nailed door, which led\nby a narrow stairs to the East gallery, she let it fall after her.\n\nDelamere, now in total darkness, tried in vain to follow the sound. He\nlistened--but no longer heard the footsteps of the trembling fugitive;\nand cursing his fate, and the stupidity of Millefleur, he endeavoured to\nfind his way back to Emmeline's room, where he thought a candle was\nstill burning. But his attempt was vain. He walked round the hall only\nto puzzle himself; for the door by which he had entered it, he could not\nregain.\n\nIn the mean time Emmeline, breathless with fear, had reached the\ngallery, and feeling her way 'till she came as she supposed to the door\nof the room where Lord Montreville slept, she tapped lightly at it.\n\nA man's voice asked who it was?\n\n'It is I, my Lord,' cried Emmeline, hardly able to make herself\nheard.--'Mr. Delamere pursues me.'\n\nSomebody opened the door.--But there was no light; and Emmeline retiring\na step from it, the person again asked who it was?\n\n'It is Emmeline,' replied she; who now first recollected that the voice\nwas not that of Lord Montreville.--She flew therefore towards the next\ndoor, with exclamations of encreased terror; but Lord Montreville, who\nwas now awakened, appeared at it with a lamp in his hand; and Emmeline,\nin answer to his question of what is the matter? endeavoured to say that\nshe was pursued by Mr. Delamere; but fear had so entirely overcome her,\nthat she could only sigh out his name; and gasping like a dying person,\nsat down on a bench which was near the door.\n\nFitz-Edward, who was the person she had first spoken to, had by this\ntime dressed himself, and came to her with a glass of water out of his\nroom; while Lord Montreville, hearing his son's name so inarticulately\npronounced, and seeing the speechless affright in which Emmeline sat\nbefore him, conceived the most alarming apprehensions, and believed that\nhis son was either dead or dying.\n\nWith great difficulty he summoned up courage enough, again to beg for\nheaven's sake she would tell him what had occasioned her to leave her\nroom at such an hour?\n\nShe again exclaimed, 'it is Mr. Delamere, my Lord!'\n\n'What of Mr. Delamere?--what of my son?' cried he, with infinite\nagitation.\n\n'Save me from him my Lord!' answered Emmeline, a little recovered by the\nwater she had drank.\n\n'Where is he then?' said his Lordship.\n\n'I know not,' replied Emmeline; 'but he came to my room with his\nservant, and I flew hither to implore your protection.'\n\nFitz-Edward intreated Lord Montreville to be more calm, and to give Miss\nMowbray time to recollect herself. He offered to go in search of\nDelamere; but his Lordship was in too much anxiety to be satisfied with\nany enquiries but his own.\n\nHe therefore said he would go down himself; but Emmeline catching his\nhand, entreated him not to leave her.\n\nAt this moment the voices of Delamere and his man were heard echoing\nthrough the whole side of the castle; for wearied with their fruitless\nattempts to escape, they both called for lights in no very gentle tone.\n\nLord Montreville easily distinguished from whence the noise came; and\nfollowed by Emmeline, whom Fitz-Edward supported, he descended into the\nbrick hall from whence Emmeline had effected her escape, where he found\nDelamere trembling with passion, and Millefleur with fear.\n\nLord Montreville could not conceal his anger and resentment.--\n\n'How comes it, Sir,' cried he, addressing himself to his son, 'that you\ndare thus to insult a person who is under my protection? What excess of\nmadness and folly has tempted you to violate the retirement of Miss\nMowbray?'\n\n'I mean not, my Lord,' answered Delamere, 'to attempt a concealment of\nmy sentiments. I love Miss Mowbray; passionately love her; and scorn to\ndissimulate. I know you had a design to send her from hence;\nclandestinely to send her; and I determined that she should not go 'till\nI had declared my attachment to her, which I found you endeavoured\nassiduously to prevent. You may certainly remove her from hence; but I\nprotest to you, that wherever she is, there I will endeavour to see her,\nin spite of the universe.'\n\nLord Montreville now felt all the force of the error he had committed in\nthat boundless indulgence to which he had accustomed his son. In the\nfirst instance of any consequence in which their wishes differed, he saw\nhim ready to throw off the restraint of paternal authority, and daring\nto avow his resolution to act as he pleased.\n\nThis mortifying reflection arose in his mind, while, with a look of\nmingled anger and amazement, he beheld Delamere, who having ordered\nMillefleur to light his candle, snatched it from him, and hastily\nretired.\n\nEmmeline, who had stood trembling the whole time behind Lord\nMontreville, besought him to ring up the housekeeper, and direct her to\nstay with her for the rest of the night; for she declared she would on\nno account remain in her own room alone.\n\nHis Lordship recommending her to the care of Fitz-Edward, went himself\nin search of the housekeeper; and Emmeline refusing to seek a more\ncommodious apartment, sat down in one of the windows of the hall to wait\nhis return.\n\nFitz-Edward, to whom she had yet hardly spoken, now entertained her with\na profusion of compliments, almost as warm as those she had heard from\nDelamere; but her spirits, quite exhausted by the terror which had so\nlately possessed them, could no longer support her; she was unable to\ngive an answer of common civility, and was very glad to see Lord\nMontreville return with Mrs. Garnet; who, extremely discomposed at being\ndisturbed and obliged to appear in her night-cap, followed her,\ngrumbling, into her room; where, as Emmeline refused to go to it\nherself, she took possession of her bed, and soon falling into a\nprofound sleep, left its melancholy owner to her sad reflections.\n\nShe had not been many minutes indulging them, and wishing for the return\nof light, before somebody was again at the door. Emmeline still\napprehending Delamere, stepped to it; and was astonished to see Lord\nMontreville himself.\n\nHe entered the room; and told her, that as his son knew of her journey\nin the morning, he would probably try some means to prevent it, or at\nleast to trace out her abode; that it was therefore absolutely necessary\nfor her to be ready by day break or before, for which he had prepared\nMr. Headly; who was up, and getting ready to set out as soon as there\nwas light enough to make it safe.\n\nEmmeline, who thought she could not be gone too soon, now hastily\nfinished the remainder of her packing; and having dressed herself for\nher journey, which notwithstanding her sleepless night she rejoiced to\nfind so near, she waited with impatience 'till Mr. Headly summoned her\nto go.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nThe sun no sooner appeared above the horizon, than her conductor was\nready with his one-horse chair: and Emmeline being seated in it, and her\nlittle baggage adjusted, she left the door of the castle; where Maloney,\nwho saw his favourite hopes vanish as he feared for ever, stood with a\nrueful countenance to behold her departure.\n\nHowever desirous she was of quitting a residence which had long been\nuneasy to her, and which was now become so extremely improper, such is\nthe force of early habit, that she could not bid it adieu without being\ngreatly affected.\n\nThere she had passed her earliest infancy, and had known, in that period\nof unconscious happiness, many delightful hours which would return no\nmore.\n\nIt was endeared to her by the memory of that good friend who had\nsupplied to her the place of a parent; from whom alone she had ever\nheard the soothing voice of maternal solicitude. And as she passed by\nthe village church, which had been formerly the chapel of the monastery,\nand joined the castle walls, she turned her eyes, filled with tears,\ntowards the spot where the remains of Mrs. Carey were deposited, and\nsighed deeply; a thousand tender and painful recollections crouding on\nher heart.\n\nAs she left the village, several women and children, who had heard she\nwas going that day, were already waiting to bid her farewell;\nconsidering her as the last of that family, by whom they had been\nemployed when in health, and relieved when in sickness; they lamented\nher departure as their greatest misfortune.\n\nThe present possessor of the castle bore not the name of Mowbray, and\nwas not at all interested for the peasantry, among whom he was a\nstranger; they therefore, in losing Emmeline, seemed to lose the last of\nthe race of their ancient benefactors.\n\nEmmeline, affected by their simple expressions of regret, returned their\ngood wishes with tears; and as soon as the chaise drove out of the\nvillage, again fixed her eyes on the habitation she had quitted.\n\nIts venerable towers rising above the wood in which it was almost\nembosomed, made one of the most magnificent features of a landscape,\nwhich now appeared in sight.\n\nThe road lay along the side of what would in England be called a\nmountain; at its feet rolled the rapid stream that washed the castle\nwalls, foaming over fragments of rock; and bounded by a wood of oak and\npine; among which the ruins of the monastery, once an appendage to the\ncastle, reared its broken arches; and marked by grey and mouldering\nwalls, and mounds covered with slight vegetation, it was traced to its\nconnection with the castle itself, still frowning in gothic\nmagnificence; and stretching over several acres of ground: the citadel,\nwhich was totally in ruins and covered with ivy, crowning the whole.\nFarther to the West, beyond a bold and rocky shore, appeared the sea;\nand to the East, a chain of mountains which seemed to meet the clouds;\nwhile on the other side, a rich and beautiful vale, now variegated with\nthe mellowed tints of the declining year, spread its enclosures, 'till\nit was lost again among the blue and barren hills.\n\nHeadly declaimed eloquently on the charms of the prospect, which\ngradually unveiled itself as the autumnal mist disappeared. But\nEmmeline, tho' ever alive to the beauties of nature, was too much\noccupied by her own melancholy reflections to attend to the\nanimadversions of her companion.\n\n_She_ saw nothing but the castle, of which she believed she was now\ntaking an eternal adieu; and her looks were fixed on it, 'till the road\nwinding down the hill on the other side, concealed it from her sight.\n\nHeadly imputed her sadness to a very different cause than that of an\nearly and long attachment to a particular spot. He supposed that regret\nat being obliged to leave Delamere, to whose passion he could not\nbelieve her insensible, occasioned the melancholy that overwhelmed her.\nHe spoke to her of him, and affected to lament the uneasiness which so\nviolent and ungovernable a temper in an only son, might occasion to his\nfamily. He then talked of the two young ladies, his sisters, whom he\ndescribed as the finest young women in the country, and as highly\naccomplished. Emmeline sighed at the comparison between _their_\nsituation and her own.\n\nAfter some hours travelling through roads which made it very fatigueing,\nthey arrived at a little obscure house of entertainment, and after some\nrefreshment, continued their journey unmolested.\n\nDelamere arose early, and calling for Millefleur, enquired at what hour\nMiss Mowbray was to go. On hearing that she had left the castle more\nthan an hour, his rage and vexation broke through all the respect he\nowed his father; who being acquainted by his valet of his resolution\nimmediately to follow the chaise, entered the room. He remonstrated with\nhim at first with great warmth; but Delamere, irritated by\ncontradiction, obstinately adhered to his resolution of immediately\npursuing the travellers.\n\nLord Montreville, finding that opposition rather encreased than remedied\nthe violence of his son's passionate sallies, determined to try what\npersuasion would do; and Delamere, whose temper was insensible to the\nthreats of anger, yielded to remonstrance when softened by paternal\naffection; and consented to forego his intention if Lord Montreville\nwould tell him where Emmeline was gone.\n\nHis Lordship, who probably thought this one of those instances in which\nfalsehood is excuseable if not meritorious, told him, with affected\nreluctance, that she was gone to board at Bridgenorth, with Mrs.\nWatkins, the sister of old Carey.\n\nAs this account was extremely probable, Delamere readily believed it;\nand having with some difficulty been prevailed upon to pass his word\nthat he would not immediately take any steps to see her, tranquillity\nwas for the present restored to the castle.\n\nEmmeline in the mean time, after a long and weary journey, arrived at\nSwansea. Mrs. Watkins, who expected her, received her in a little but\nvery neat habitation, which consisted of a small room by way of\nparlour, not unlike the cabin of a packet boat, and a bed-chamber over\nit of the same dimensions. Of these apartments, Emmeline took\npossession. Her conductor took leave of her; and she now wished to be\nable to form some opinion of her new hostess; whose countenance, which\nextremely resembled that of Mrs. Carey, had immediately prejudiced her\nin her favour.\n\nBeing assured by Lord Montreville of every liberal payment for the board\nand lodging of Miss Mowbray, she received her with a degree of civility\nalmost oppressive: but Emmeline, who soon found that she possessed none\nof that warmth of heart and lively interest in the happiness of others\nwhich so much endeared to her the memory of her former friend, was very\nglad when after a few days the good woman returned with her usual\navidity to the regulation of her domestic matters, and suffered Emmeline\nto enjoy that solitude which she knew so well how to employ.\n\nDelamere, still lingering at the castle, where he seemed to stay for no\nother reason than because he had there seen Emmeline, was pensive,\nrestless, and absent; and Lord Montreville saw with great alarm that\nthis impression was less likely to be effaced by time and absence than\nhe had supposed.\n\nFitz-Edward, obliged to go to Ireland to his regiment for some time, had\ntaken leave of them; and the impatience of Lord Montreville to return to\ntown was encreased by repeated letters from his wife.\n\nDelamere however still evaded it; hoping that his father would set out\nwithout him, and that he should by that means have an opportunity of\ngoing to Bridgenorth, where he determined to solicit Emmeline to consent\nto a Scottish expedition, and persuaded himself he should not meet a\nrefusal.\n\nAt length Lady Montreville, yet more alarmed at the delay, directed her\neldest daughter to write to his Lordship, and to give such an account of\nher health as should immediately oblige the father and son to return.\n\nDelamere, after such a letter, could not refuse to depart; and\ncomforting himself that he might be able soon to escape from the\nobservation of his family, and put his project in execution, he\nconsented to begin his journey. He determined, however, to write to Miss\nMowbray, and to desire her to direct her answer under cover to a friend\nin London.\n\nHe did so; and addressed it to her at Mrs. Watkins's, at Bridgenorth:\nbut soon after his arrival in town, the letter was returned to the place\nfrom which it was dated; having been opened at the office in consequence\nof no such person as Miss Mowbray or Mrs. Watkins being to be found\nthere.\n\nDelamere saw he had been deceived; but to complain was fruitless: he had\ntherefore no hope of discovering where Emmeline was, but by lying in\nwait for some accidental intelligence.\n\nThe family usually passed the Christmas recess at their seat in Norfolk;\nwhither Delamere, who at first tried to avoid being of the party, at\nlength agreed to accompany them, on condition of his being allowed to\nperform an engagement he had made with Mr. Percival for a fortnight.\nPart of this time he determined to employ in seeing Headly, who did not\nlive above thirty miles from thence; hoping from him to obtain\nintelligence of Emmeline's abode. And that no suspicion might remain on\nthe mind of his father, he affected to reassume his usual gaiety, and\nwas to all appearance as volatile and dissipated as ever.\n\nWhile the family were in Norfolk, their acquaintance was warmly renewed\nwith that of Sir Francis Devereux, who was lately returned from a\nresidence on the Continent, whither he had been to compleat the\neducation of his two daughters, heiresses to his fortune, on the\nembellishment of whose persons and manners all the modern elegancies of\neducation had been lavished.\n\nThey were rather pretty women; and of a family almost as ancient and\nillustrious as that of Mr. Delamere. Their fortunes were to be immense;\nand either of them would have been a wife for Delamere, the choice of\nwhom would greatly have gratified the families on both sides.\n\nInfinite pains were taken to bring the young people frequently together;\nand both the ladies seemed to allow that Delamere was a conquest worthy\ntheir ambition.\n\nAs he never refused to entertain them with every appearance of gallantry\nand vivacity, Lord Montreville flattered himself that at length Emmeline\nwas forgotten; and ventured to propose to his son, a marriage with\nwhichever of the Miss Devereux's he should prefer.\n\nTo which, Delamere, who had long foreseen the proposal, answered coldly,\n'that he was not inclined to marry at all; or if he did, it should not\nbe one of those over-educated puppets.'\n\nSo far were their acquisitions from having made any impression on his\nheart, that the frivolous turn of their minds, the studied ornaments of\ntheir persons, and the affected refinement of their manners, made him\nonly recollect with more passionate admiration, that native elegance of\nperson and mind which he had seen only in the Orphan of Mowbray Castle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nThere was, in the person and manner of Emmeline, something so\ninteresting, that those who were little accustomed to attach themselves\nto any one, were insensibly disposed to love her, and to become\nsolicitous for her welfare.\n\nEven the insensibility with which long and uninterrupted prosperity had\nencased the heart of Lord Montreville, was not entirely proof against\nher attractive powers; and when he no longer apprehended the effect of\nher encreasing charms on his son, he suffered himself to feel a degree\nof pity and even of affection for her.\n\nHe therefore heard with pleasure that she was contented in her present\nsituation; and was convinced she had kept her word in not giving any\nintelligence of her residence to Delamere. To shew his approbation of\nher conduct, he directed a person in town to send her down a small\ncollection of books; some materials for drawing; and other trifles which\nhe thought would be acceptable.\n\nEmmeline, charmed with such acquisitions, felt the most lively gratitude\nfor her benefactor; and having fitted up her little cabin extremely to\nher satisfaction; she found, in the occupation these presents afforded\nher, all that she wished, to engage her attention; and gratify her\ntaste.\n\nSensible of the defects of her education, she applied incessantly to her\nbooks; for of every useful and ornamental feminine employment she had\nlong since made herself mistress without any instruction.\n\nShe endeavoured to cultivate a genius for drawing, which she inherited\nfrom her father; but for want of knowing a few general rules, what she\nproduced had more of elegance and neatness than correctness and\nknowledge.\n\nShe knew nothing of the science of music; but her voice was soft and\nsweet, and her ear exquisite. The simple songs, therefore, she had\nacquired by it, she sung with a pathos which made more impression on her\nhearers than those studied graces learned by long application, which\nexcite wonder rather than pleasure.\n\nTime, thus occupied, passed lightly away; Spring arrived almost\nimperceptibly, and brought again weather which enabled Emmeline to\nreassume her walks along the shore or among the rocks, and to indulge\nthat contemplative turn of mind which she had acquired in the solitude\nof Mowbray Castle.\n\nIt was on a beautiful morning of the month of April, that, taking a book\nwith her as usual, she went down to the sea side, and sat reading for\nsome hours; when, just as she was about to return home, she saw a lovely\nlittle boy, about five years old, wandering towards the place where she\nwas, picking up shells and sea weeds, and appearing to be so deeply\nengaged in his infantine pursuit, that he did not see her 'till she\nspoke to him.\n\n'Whose sweet little boy are you, my love?' said she.\n\nThe child looked at her with surprise.\n\n'I am my mamma's boy,' said he, 'and so is Henry,' pointing towards\nanother who now approached, and who seemed hardly a year younger.\n\nThe second running up to his brother, caught his hand, and they both\nwalked away together, looking behind at the strange lady with some\ndegree of alarm.\n\nTheir dress convinced Emmeline that they belonged to a stranger; and as\nthey seemed to have nobody with them, she was under some apprehension\nfor their safety, and therefore arose to follow them, when on turning\nround the point of a rock whose projection had concealed the shore to\nthe left, she saw a lady walking slowly before her, whom the two little\nboys had now rejoined. In her hand she held a little girl, who seemed\nonly learning to walk; and she was followed by a nursery maid, who held\nin her arms another, yet an infant at the breast.\n\nThe stranger, near whom Emmeline was obliged to pass, curtsyed to her as\nshe went by. And if Emmeline was surprised at the early appearance of\ncompany at a time when she knew it to be so unusual, the stranger was\nmuch more so at the uncommon elegance of her form and manner: she was\nalmost tempted to believe the fable of the sea nymphs, and to fancy her\none of them.\n\nEmmeline, on regaining her apartment, heard from the hostess, whom she\nfound with another neighbour, that the lady she had seen arrived the\nevening before, and had taken lodgings at the house of the latter, with\nan intention of staying great part of the summer.\n\nThe next day Emmeline again met the stranger; who accosting the fair\norphan with all that ease which characterises the address of those who\nhave lived much in good company, they soon entered into conversation,\nand Emmeline almost as soon discovered that her new acquaintance\npossessed an understanding as excellent as her person and address were\ncaptivating.\n\nShe appeared to be not more than five or six and twenty: but her person\nseemed to have suffered from sorrow that diminution of its charms, which\ntime could not yet have effected. Her complexion was faded and wan; her\neyes had lost their lustre; and a pensive and languid expression sat on\nher countenance.\n\nAfter the first conversation, the two ladies found they liked each other\nso well, that they met by agreement every day. Emmeline generally went\nearly to the lodgings of Mrs. Stafford, and stayed the whole day with\nher; charmed to have found in her new friend, one who could supply to\nher all the deficiencies of her former instructors.\n\nTo a very superior understanding, Mrs. Stafford added the advantages of\na polished education, and all that ease of manner, which the commerce of\nfashion can supply. She had read a great deal; and her mind, originally\nelegant and refined, was highly cultivated, and embellished with all the\nknowledge that could be acquired from the best authors in the modern\nlanguages. Her disposition seemed to have been naturally chearful; for a\nray of vivacity would frequently light up her countenance, and a lively\nand agreeable conversation call forth all its animated gaiety. But it\nseldom lasted long. Some settled uneasiness lay lurking in her heart;\nand when it recurred forcibly to her, as it frequently did in the midst\nof the most interesting discourse, a cloud of sorrow obscured the\nbrilliancy of her countenance and language, and she became pensive,\nsilent, and absent.\n\nEmmeline observed this with concern; but was not yet intimate enough\nwith her to enquire or discover the cause.\n\nSometimes, when she was herself occupied in drawing, or some other\npursuit in which Mrs. Stafford delighted to instruct her, she saw that\nher friend, believing herself unobserved, gave way to all the melancholy\nthat oppressed her heart; and as her children were playing round her,\nshe would gaze mournfully on them 'till the tears streamed down her\ncheeks.\n\nBy degrees the utmost confidence took place between them on every\nsubject but one: Mrs. Stafford never dwelt on the cause, whatever it\nwas, which occasioned her to be so frequently uneasy; nor did she ever\ncomplain of being so: but she listened with the warmest interest to the\nlittle tale Emmeline had to relate, and told her in return as much of\nher own history as she thought it necessary for her to know.\n\nEmmeline found that she was not a widow, as she had at first supposed;\nfor she spoke sometimes of her husband, and said she expected him at\nSwansea. She had been married at a very early age; and they now\ngenerally resided at an house which Mr. Stafford's father, who was still\nliving, had purchased for them in Dorsetshire.\n\n'I came hither,' said she, 'thus early in the year, at Mr. Stafford's\nrequest, who is fond of improvements and alterations, and who intends\nthis summer to add considerably to our house; which is already too\nlarge, I think, for our present fortune. I was glad to get away from the\nconfusion of workmen, to which I have an aversion; and anxious to let\nCharles and Henry, who had the measles in the Autumn and who have been\nfrequently ill since, have a long course of sea-bathing. I might indeed\nhave gone to Weymouth or some nearer place; but I wish to avoid general\ncompany, which I could not have done where I am sure of meeting so many\nof my acquaintance. I rejoice now at my preference of Swansea, since it\nhas been the means of my knowing you, my dear Emmeline.'\n\n'And I, Madam,' returned Emmeline, 'have reason to consider the\nconcurrence of circumstances that brought you here as the most fortunate\nfor me. Yet I own to you, that the charm of such society is accompanied\nwith great pain, in anticipating the hour when I must again return to\nthat solitude I have 'till now considered as my greatest enjoyment.'\n\n'Ah! my dear girl!' replied Mrs. Stafford, 'check in its first\nappearance a propensity which I see you frequently betray, to anticipate\ndispleasing or unfortunate events. When you have lived a few years\nlonger, you will, I fear, learn, that every day has evils enough of its\nown, and that it is well for us we know nothing of those which are yet\nto come. I speak from experience; for I, when not older than you now\nare, had a perpetual tendency to fancy future calamities, and embittered\nby that means many of those hours which would otherwise have been really\nhappy. Yet has not my pre-sentiments, tho' most of them have been\nunhappily verified, enabled me to avoid one of those thorns with which\nmy path has been thickly strewn.'\n\nEmmeline hoped now to hear what hand had strewn them.\n\nMrs. Stafford, sighing deeply, fell into a reverie; and continuing long\nsilent, Emmeline could not resolve to renew a conversation so evidently\npainful to her.\n\nIt was now six weeks since she had first seen Mrs. Stafford, and the\nhours had passed in a series of felicity of which she had 'till then\nformed no idea.\n\nMrs. Stafford, delighted with the lively attachment of her young friend,\nwas charmed to find herself capable of adorning her ingenuous and tender\nmind with all that knowledge which books or the world had qualified her\nto impart.\n\nThey read together every day: Emmeline, under the tuition of her\ncharming preceptress, had made some progress in French and Italian; and\nshe was amazed at her own success in drawing since she had received from\nMrs. Stafford rules of which she was before ignorant.\n\nAs the summer advanced, a few stragglers came in, and it was no longer\nwonderful to see a stranger. But Mrs. Stafford and Miss Mowbray,\nperfectly satisfied with each other, sought not to enlarge their\nsociety. They sometimes held short conversations with the transient\nvisitants of the place, but more usually avoided those walks where it\nwas likely they should meet them.\n\nEarly one morning, they were returning from the bathing place together,\nmuffled up in their morning dresses. They had seen at a distance two\ngentlemen, whom they did not particularly notice; and Emmeline, leaning\non the arm of her friend, was again anticipating all she should suffer\nwhen the hour came which would separate them, and recollecting the\ndifferent company and conversation to which she had been condemned from\nthe death of Mrs. Carey to her quitting Mowbray Castle--\n\n'You have not only taught me, my dear Mrs. Stafford,' said she, 'to\ndread more than ever being thrown back into such company; but you have\nalso made me fear that I shall never relish the general conversation of\nthe world. As I disliked the manners of an inferior description of\npeople when I first knew them, because they did not resemble those of\nthe dear good woman who brought me up; so I shall undoubtedly be\ndisappointed and dissatisfied with the generality of those acquaintance\nI may meet with; for I am afraid there are as few Mrs. Staffords in your\nrank of life as there were Mrs. Careys in hers. However, there is no\ngreat likelihood, I believe, at present, of my being convinced how\nlittle they resemble you; for it is not probable I shall be taken from\nhence.'\n\n'Perhaps,' answered Mrs. Stafford, 'you might be permitted to stay some\nmonths next winter with me. I shall pass the whole of it in the country;\nthe greatest part of it probably alone; and such a companion would\nassist in charming away many of those hours, which now, tho' I have more\nresources than most people, sometimes are heavy and melancholy. My\nchildren are not yet old enough to be my companions; and I know not how\nit is, but I have often more pain than pleasure in being with them. When\nI remember, or when I feel, how little happiness there is in the world,\nI tremble for their future destiny; and in the excess of affection,\nregret having introduced them into a scene of so much pain as I have\nhitherto found it. But tell me, Emmeline, do you think if I apply to\nLord Montreville he will allow you to pass some time with me?'\n\n'Dear Madam,' said Emmeline, eagerly, 'what happiness do you offer me!\nLord Montreville would certainly think me highly honoured by such an\ninvitation.'\n\n'Shall I answer for Lord Montreville,' said a voice behind them, 'as his\nimmediate representative?'\n\nEmmeline started; and turning quickly, beheld Mr. Delamere and\nFitz-Edward.\n\nDelamere caught her hands in his.\n\n'Have I then found you, my lovely cousin?' cried he.--'Oh! happiness\nunexpected!'\n\nHe was proceeding with even more than his usual vehemence; but\nFitz-Edward thought it necessary to stop him.\n\n'You promised, Frederic, before I consented to come with you, that you\nwould desist from these extravagant flights. Come, I beg Miss Mowbray\nmay be permitted to speak to her other acquaintance; and that she will\ndo us both the honour to introduce us to her friend.'\n\nEmmeline had lost all courage and recollection on the appearance of\nDelamere. Mrs. Stafford saw her distress; and assuming a cold and\ndistant manner, she said--'Miss Mowbray, I apprehend from what this\ngentleman has said, that he has a message to you from Lord Montreville.'\n\n'Has my Lord, Sir,' said Emmeline to Delamere,--'has my Lord Montreville\nbeen so good as to honour me with any commands?'\n\n'Cruel girl!' answered he; 'you know too well that my father is not\nacquainted with my being here.'\n\n'Then you certainly ought not to be here,' said Emmeline, coolly; 'and\nyou must excuse me, Sir, if I beg the favor of you not to detain me, nor\nattempt to renew a conversation so very improper, indeed so cruelly\ninjurious to me.'\n\nMrs. Stafford had Emmeline's arm within her own, from the commencement\nof this conversation; and she now walked hastily on with her.\n\nDelamere followed them, intreating to be heard; and Fitz-Edward,\naddressing himself on the other side to Mrs. Stafford, besought her in a\nhalf whisper to allow his friend only a few moments to explain himself\nto Miss Mowbray.\n\n'No, Sir, I must be excused,' answered she--'If Miss Mowbray does me the\nhonour to consult me, I shall certainly advise her against committing\nsuch an indiscretion as listening to Mr. Delamere.'\n\n'Ah! Madam!' said the colonel, throwing into his eyes and manner all\nthat insinuation of which he was so perfect a master, 'is it possible,\nthat with a countenance where softness and compassion seem to invite the\nunhappy to trust you with their sorrows, you have a cruel and unfeeling\nheart? Lay by for a moment your barbarous prudence, in favour of my\nunfortunate friend; upon my honour, nothing but the conviction that his\nlife was at stake, would have induced me to accompany him hither; and I\npledge myself for the propriety of his conduct. He only begs to be\nforgiven by Miss Mowbray for his improper treatment of her at Mowbray\nCastle; to be assured she is in health and safety; and to hear that she\ndoes not hate him for all the uneasiness he has given her; and having\ndone so, he promises to return to his family. Upon my soul,' continued\nhe, laying his hand upon his breast, 'I know not what would have been\nthe consequence, had I not consented to assist him in deceiving his\nfamily and coming hither: but I have reason to think he would have made\nsome wild attempt to secure to himself more frequent interviews with\nMiss Mowbray; and that a total disappointment of the project he had\nformed for seeing her, would have been attended with a violence of\npassion arising even to phrenzy.--Madness or death would perhaps have\nbeen the event.'\n\nMrs. Stafford turned her eyes on Fitz-Edward, with a look sufficiently\nexpressive of incredulity--'Does a modern man of fashion pretend to talk\nof madness and death? You certainly imagine, Sir, that you are speaking\nto some romantic inhabitant of a Welch provincial town, whose ideas are\ndrawn from a circulating library, and confirmed by the conversation of\nthe captain in quarters.'\n\n'Ah, madam,' said he, 'I know not to whom I have the honour of\naddressing myself,' (though he knew perfectly well;) 'but I feel too\ncertainly that madness and death would be preferable to the misery such\ncoldness and cruelty as your's would inflict on me, was it my misfortune\nto love as violently as Delamere; and indeed I tremble, lest in\nendeavouring to assist my friend I have endangered myself.'\n\nOf this speech, Mrs. Stafford, who believed he did not know her, took\nvery little notice; and turning towards Emmeline, who had in the mean\ntime been listening in trembling apprehension to the ardent declarations\nof Delamere, said it was time to return home.\n\nDelamere, without attending to her hint, renewed his importunities for\nher friendship and interest with Miss Mowbray; to which, as soon as he\nwould allow her to answer, she said very gravely--'Sir, as Miss Mowbray\nseems so much alarmed at your pursuing her hither, and as you must be\nyourself sensible of it's extreme impropriety, I hope you will not\nlengthen an interview which can only produce uneasiness for you both.'\n\n'Let us go home, for heaven's sake!' whispered Emmeline.\n\n'They are determined, you see, to follow us,' replied her friend; 'we\nwill however go.'\n\nBy this time they were near the door; and Mrs. Stafford wishing the two\ngentlemen a good morning, was hurrying with Emmeline into the house; but\nFitz-Edward took hold of her arm.\n\n'One word, only, madam, and we will intrude upon you no farther at\npresent: say that you will suffer us to see you again to-morrow.'\n\n'Not if I can help it, be assured, Sir.'\n\n'Then, madam,' said Delamere, 'you must allow me to finish now what I\nhave to say to Miss Mowbray.'\n\n'Good heaven! Sir,' exclaimed Emmeline, 'why will you thus persist in\ndistressing me? You are perhaps known to Mrs. Watkins; your name will be\nat least known to her; and intelligence of your being here will be\ninstantly sent to Lord Montreville.'\n\nEmmeline, by no means aware that this speech implied a desire of\nconcealment, the motives of which might appear highly flattering to\nDelamere, was soon made sensible of it's import by his answer.\n\n'Enough, my adorable Emmeline!' cried he eagerly, 'if I am worthy of a\nthought of that sort, I am less wretched than I believed myself. I will\nnot now insist on a longer audience; but to-morrow I must see you\nagain.--Your amiable friend here will intercede for me.--I must not be\nrefused; and will wish you a good day before you can form so cruel a\nresolution.'\n\nSo saying, he bowed to Mrs. Stafford, kissed Emmeline's hand, and\ndeparted with Fitz-Edward from the door.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nThe two fair friends no sooner entered the house, than Emmeline threw\nherself into a chair, and burst into tears.\n\n'Ah! my dear madam,' said she, sobbing, 'what will now become of me?\nLord Montreville will believe I have corresponded with his son; he will\nwithdraw all favour and confidence from me; and I shall be undone!'\n\n'Do not thus distress yourself,' said Mrs. Stafford, tenderly taking her\nhand--'I hope the rash and cruel conduct of this young man will not have\nthe consequences you apprehend. Lord Montreville, from your former\nconduct, will easily credit your not having encouraged this visit.'\n\n'Ah! my dear Mrs. Stafford,' replied Emmeline, 'you do not know Lord\nMontreville. He hastily formed a notion that I made an appointment with\nMr. Delamere at Mowbray Castle, when I had not even seen him above once;\nand though, from my eagerness to leave it, I believe he afterwards\nthought he had been too hasty, yet so strong was that first impression,\nthat the slightest circumstance would, I know, renew it as forcibly as\never: for he has one of those tempers, which having once entertained an\nidea of a person's conduct or character, never really alters it, though\nthey see the most convincing evidence of it's fallacy. Having once\nsupposed I favoured the addresses of Mr. Delamere, as you know he did,\nat Mowbray Castle, the present visit will convince him he was right, and\nthat I am the most artful as well as the most ungrateful of beings.'\n\nMrs. Stafford hesitated a moment, and then said, 'I see all the evil you\napprehend. To convince Lord Montreville of your ignorance of Delamere's\ndesign, and your total rejection of his clandestine addresses, suppose I\nwere to write to him? He must be prejudiced and uncandid indeed, if\nafter such information he is not convinced of your innocence.'\n\nTo this proposal, Emmeline consented, with assurances of the liveliest\ngratitude; and Mrs. Stafford returning to her lodgings, wrote the\nfollowing letter to Lord Montreville:\n\n\n                                                   _Swansea, June 20._\n\n  'My Lord,\n\n    'A short abode at this place, has given me the pleasure of knowing\n  Miss Mowbray, to whose worth and prudence I am happy to bear\n  testimony. At the request of this amiable young woman, I am now to\n  address your Lordship with information that Mr. Delamere came hither\n  yesterday with Mr. Fitz-Edward, and has again renewed those\n  addresses to Miss Mowbray which she knows to be so disagreeable to\n  your Lordship, and which cannot but be extremely prejudicial to her.\n  Circumstanced as she is at this place, she cannot entirely avoid\n  him; but she hopes your Lordship will be convinced how truly she\n  laments the pain this improper conduct of Mr. Delamere will give\n  you, and she loses not a moment in beseeching you to write to him,\n  or otherwise to interfere, in prevailing on him to quit Swansea; and\n  to prevent his continuing to distress her by a pursuit so unwelcome\n  to you, and so injurious to her honour and repose.\n\n                                       I have the honour to be,\n                                                         my Lord,\n                                                    your Lordship's\n                                               most obedient servant,\n                                                          C. STAFFORD.'\n\n\nThis letter being extremely approved of by Emmeline, was put into the\nnext day's post; and the two ladies set out for their walk at a very\nearly hour, flattering themselves they should return before Delamere and\nFitz-Edward (who was lately raised to the rank of lieutenant-colonel)\nwere abroad. But in this they deceived themselves. They were again\novertaken by their importunate pursuers, who had now agreed to vary the\nmode of their attack. Fitz-Edward, who knew the power of his insidious\neloquence over the female heart, undertook to plead for his friend to\nEmmeline, while Delamere was to try to interest Mrs. Stafford, and\nengage her good offices in his behalf.\n\nThey no sooner joined the ladies, than Delamere said to the\nlatter--'After the discouraging reception of yesterday, nothing but\nbeing persuaded that your heart will refuse to confirm the rigour you\nthink yourself obliged to adopt, could make me venture, Madam, to\nsolicit your favour with Miss Mowbray. I now warmly implore it; and\nsurely'----\n\n'Can you believe, Sir,' said Mrs. Stafford, interrupting him, 'that _I_\nshall ever influence Miss Mowbray to listen to you; knowing, as I do,\nthe aversion of your family to your entertaining any honourable views?\nand having reason to believe you have yourself formed those that are\nvery different?'\n\n'You have no reason to believe so, Madam,' interrupted Delamere in his\nturn; 'and must wilfully mistake me, as an excuse for your cold and\nunkind manner of treating me. By heaven! I love Emmeline with a passion\nas pure as it is violent; and if she would but consent to it, will marry\nher in opposition to all the world. Assist me then, dear and amiable\nMrs. Stafford! assist me to conquer the unreasonable prejudice she has\nconceived against a secret marriage!'\n\n'Never, Sir, will I counsel Miss Mowbray to accept such a proposal!\nnever will I advise her to unite herself with one whose family disdain\nto receive her! and by clandestinely stealing into it, either disturb\nit's peace, or undergo the humiliation of living the wife of a man who\ndares not own her!'\n\n'And who, Madam, has said that I dare not own her? Does not the same\nblood run in our veins? Is she not worthy, from her personal merit, of a\nthrone if I had a throne to offer her? And do you suppose I mean to\nsacrifice the happiness of my whole life to the narrow policy or selfish\nambition of my father?'\n\n'Wait then, Sir, 'till time shall produce some alteration in your\nfavour. Emmeline is yet very young, too young indeed to marry. Perhaps,\nwhen Lord and Lady Montreville are convinced that she only can make you\nhappy, they may consent to your union.'\n\n'You little know, Madam, the hopelessness of such an expectation. Were\nit possible that any arguments, any motives could engage my father to\nforego all the projects of aggrandizing his family by splendid and rich\nalliances, my mother will, I know, ever be inexorable. She will not hear\nthe name of Emmeline. Last winter she incessantly persecuted me with\nproposals of marriage, and is now bent upon persuading me to engage my\nhand to Miss Otley, a relation of her own, who possesses indeed an\nimmense fortune, and is of rank; but who of all women living would make\nme the most miserable. The fatigueing arguments I have heard about this\nmatch, and the fruitless and incessant solicitude of my mother, convince\nme I cannot, for both our sakes, too soon put an end to it.'\n\nMrs. Stafford, notwithstanding the vehement plausibility of Delamere,\nstill declined giving to Emmeline such advice as he wished to engage her\nto offer; and tho' aware of all the advantages such a marriage would\nprocure her friend, she would not influence her to a determination her\nheart could not approve.\n\nWhile Delamere therefore was pleading vainly to her, Fitz-Edward was\nexhausting in his discourse with Emmeline, all that rhetoric on behalf\nof his friend, which had already succeeded so frequently for himself.\nTho' he had given way to Delamere's eagerness, and had accompanied him\nin pursuit of Miss Mowbray, after a few feeble arguments against it, he\nnever intended to encourage him in his resolution of marrying her; which\nhe thought a boyish and romantic plan, and one, of which he would\nprobably be weary before it could be executed. But as it was a military\nmaxim, that in love and war all stratagems are allowable, he failed not\nto lay as much stress on the honourable intentions of Delamere, as if he\nhad really meant to assist in carrying them into effect.\n\nEmmeline heard him in silence: or when an answer of some kind seemed to\nbe extorted from her, she told him that she referred herself entirely to\nMrs. Stafford, and would not even speak upon the subject but before her,\nand as she should dictate.\n\nIn this way several meetings passed between Delamere, the colonel, and\nthe two ladies; for unless the latter had wholly confined themselves,\nthere was no possible way of avoiding the importunate assiduity of the\ngentlemen. Fitz-Edward had a servant who was an adept in such\ncommissions, and who was kept constantly on the watch; so that they were\ntraced and followed, in spite of all their endeavours to avoid it.\n\nMrs. Stafford, however, persuaded Emmeline to be less uneasy at it, as\nshe assured her she would never leave her; and that there could be no\nmisrepresentation of her conduct while they were together.\n\nEvery day they expected some consequence from Mrs. Stafford's letter to\nLord Montreville; but for ten days, though they had heard nothing, they\nsatisfied themselves with conjectures.\n\nTen days more insensibly passed by; and they began to think it very\nextraordinary that his Lordship should give no attention to an affair,\nwhich only a few months before seemed to have occasioned him so much\nserious alarm.\n\nIn this interval, Delamere saw Emmeline every day; and Fitz-Edward, on\nbehalf of his friend's views, attached himself to Mrs. Stafford with an\nattention as marked and as warm as that of Delamere towards Miss\nMowbray.\n\nHe was well aware of the power a woman of her understanding must have\nover an heart like Emmeline's; so new to the world, so ingenuous, and so\nmuch inclined to indulge all the delicious enthusiasm of early\nfriendship.\n\nHe had had a slight acquaintance with Mrs. Stafford when she was first\nmarried; and knew enough of her husband to be informed of the source of\nthat dejection, which, through all her endeavours to conceal it,\nfrequently appeared; and having lived always among those who consider\nattachments to married women as allowable gallantries, and having had\nbut too much success among them, Fitz-Edward thought he could take\nadvantage of Mrs. Stafford's situation, to entangle her in a connection\nwhich would make her more indulgent to the weakness of her friend for\nDelamere.\n\nBut such was the awful, yet simple dignity of her manner, and so sacred\nthe purity of unaffected virtue, that he dared not hazard offending her;\nwhile aware of the tendency of his flattering and incessant assiduity,\nshe was always watchful to prevent any diminution of the respect she had\na right to exact; and without affecting to shun his society, which was\nextremely agreeable, she never suffered him to assume, in his\nconversation with her, those freedoms which often made him admired by\nothers; nor allowed him to avow that libertinism of principle which she\nlamented that he possessed.\n\nFitz-Edward, who had at first undertaken to entertain her merely with a\nview of favouring Delamere's conversation with Emmeline, almost\nimperceptibly found that it had charms on his own account. He could not\nbe insensible of the graces of a mind so highly cultivated; and he felt\nhis admiration mingled with a reverence and esteem of which he had never\nbefore been sensible: but his vanity was piqued at the coldness with\nwhich she received his studied and delicate adulation; and, for the\nfirst time in his life, he was obliged to acknowledge to himself, that\nthere might be a woman whose mind was superior to it's influence.\n\nNot being disposed very tranquilly to submit to this mortifying\nconviction, he became more anxious to secure that partiality from Mrs.\nStafford, which, since he found it so hard to acquire, became necessary\nto his happiness; and, in the hope of obtaining it, he would probably\nlong have persisted, had not his attention been soon afterwards diverted\nto another object.\n\nIt wanted only a few days of a month since Mrs. Stafford's letter was\ndispatched to Lord Montreville. But the carelessness of the servant who\nwas left in charge of the house in Berkley-square was the only reason of\nhis not noticing it.\n\nImmediately after the birth-day, his Lordship had quitted London on a\nvisit to a nobleman in Buckinghamshire, whither his son had attended\nhim, and where they parted. Delamere, under pretence of seeing his\nfriend Percival, really went into Berkshire; and Lord Montreville,\nhaving insisted on Delamere's joining him at the house of Lady Mary\nOtley, beyond Durham, where Lady Montreville and her two daughters were\nalready gone, set out himself for that place, where they intended to\npass the months of July and August. He had many friends to visit on the\nroad; and when his Lordship arrived there, he found all his letters had,\ninstead of following him as he had directed, been sent immediately\nthither; and instead of finding his son, or an account of his intended\narrival, he had the mortification of reading Mrs. Stafford's\ninformation.\n\nDelamere had, indeed, passed a few days with Mr. Percival, and had\nwritten to his father from thence; but he had also seen Headly, from\nwhom he had extorted the secret of Emmeline's residence.\n\nFitz-Edward, to whose sister Mr. Percival was lately married, had joined\nDelamere at the house of his brother-in-law: and Delamere persisting in\nhis resolution of seeing Emmeline, had, without much difficulty,\nprevailed on Fitz-Edward, (who had some weeks on his hands before he was\nto join his regiment in Ireland, and who had no aversion to any plan\nthat looked like an intrigue) to accompany him.\n\nThey contrived to gain Mr. Percival: and Delamere, by inclosing letters\nto him, which were forwarded to his father as if he had been still\nthere, imagined that he had prevented all probability of discovery.\nCould he have persuaded Emmeline to a Scottish marriage, (which he very\nfirmly believed he should) he intended as soon as they were married, to\nhave taken her to the house of Lady Mary Otley, and to have presented\nher to his father, his mother, his sisters, and Lady Mary and her\ndaughter, who were also his relations, as his wife.\n\nLord Montreville, on reading Mrs. Stafford's letter, shut himself up in\nhis own apartment to consider what was to be done.\n\nHe knew Delamere too well to believe that writing, or the agency of any\nother person, would have on him the least effect.\n\nHe was convinced therefore he must go himself; yet to return\nimmediately, without giving Lady Montreville some very good reason, was\nimpossible; nor could he think of any that would content her, but the\ntruth. Though he would very willingly have concealed from her what had\nhappened, he was obliged to send for her, and communicate to her the\nintelligence received from Mrs. Stafford.\n\nHer Ladyship, whose pride was, if possible, more than adequate to her\nhigh blood, and whose passions were as strong as her reason was feeble,\nreceived this information with all those expressions of rage and\ncontempt which Lord Montreville had foreseen.\n\nThough the conduct of Emmeline was such as all her prejudice could not\nmisunderstand, she loaded her with harsh and injurious appellations, and\nblamed his Lordship for having fostered a little reptile, who was now\nlikely to disgrace and ruin the family to which she pretended to belong.\nShe protested, that if Delamere dared to harbour so degrading an idea as\nthat of marrying her, she would blot him for ever from her affection,\nand if possible from her memory.\n\nLord Montreville was obliged to wait 'till the violence of her first\nemotion had subsided, before he ventured to propose going himself to\nrecall Delamere. To this proposal, however, her Ladyship agreed; and\nwhen she became a little cooler, consented readily to conceal, if\npossible, from Lady Mary Otley, the reason of Lord Montreville's abrupt\ndeparture, which was fixed for the next day; for the knowledge of it\ncould not have any good effect on the sentiments of Lady Mary and her\ndaughter; the former of whom was at present as anxious as Lady\nMontreville for an union of their families.\n\nAfter some farther reflection, Lord Montreville thought that as Delamere\nwas extremely fond of his youngest sister, her influence might be of\ngreat use in detaching him from his pursuit. It was therefore settled\nthat she should accompany his Lordship; making the most plausible story\nthey could, to account for a departure so unexpected; and leaving Lady\nMontreville and Miss Delamere as pledges of their intended return, Lord\nMontreville and his daughter Augusta set out post for London, in their\nway to Swansea.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nEmmeline had, for some days, complained of a slight indisposition; and\nbeing somewhat better, had determined to walk out in the evening; but\nhaving rather favoured and indulged her illness, as it gave her a\npretext for avoiding Delamere, whose long and vehement assiduities began\nto give great uneasiness to both the ladies, she still answered to their\nenquiries that she was too ill to leave her room, and in consequence of\nthis message, she and Mrs. Stafford, who came to sit with her, soon\nafterwards saw the Colonel and Delamere ride by as if for their evening\nairing. They kissed their hands as they passed; and as soon as the\nladies believed them quite out of sight, and had observed the way they\nhad gone, Emmeline, who had confined herself three days to her room, and\nwho languished for air, proposed a short walk the opposite way, to which\nMrs. Stafford consented; and as soon as the heat was a little abated,\nthey set out, and enjoyed a comfortable and quiet walk for near an hour;\nfrom which they were returning, when they saw Delamere and Fitz-Edward\nriding towards them.\n\nThey dismounted, and giving their horses to their servants, joined them;\nDelamere reproaching Emmeline for the artifice she had used, yet\ncongratulating himself on seeing her again. But his eyes eagerly running\nover her person, betrayed his extreme anxiety and concern at observing\nher pale and languid looks, and the lassitude of her whole frame.\n\nFitz-Edward, in a whisper, made the same remarks on her appearance to\nMrs. Stafford; who answered, 'that if Mr. Delamere persisted in pursuing\nher, she did not doubt but that it would end in her going into a\ndecline.'\n\n'Say rather,' answered Fitz-Edward artfully, 'that the interesting\nlanguor on the charming countenance of your friend, arises from the\nsensibility of her heart. She cannot surely see Delamere, dying for her\nas he is, without feeling some disposition to answer a passion so ardent\nand sincere: I know it is impossible she should. It is only your Stoic\nprudence, your cold and unfeeling bosom, which can arm itself against\nall the enthusiasm of love, all the tenderness of friendship. Miss\nMowbray's heart is made of softer materials; and were it not for the\ninhuman reserve you have taught her, poor Delamere had long since met a\nmore suitable return to an attachment, of which, almost any other woman\nwould glory in being the object.'\n\nThere was something in this speech particularly displeasing to Mrs.\nStafford; who answered, 'that he could not pay her a compliment more\ngratifying, than when he told her she had been the means of saving Miss\nMowbray from indiscretion; though she was well convinced, that her own\nexcellent understanding, and purity of heart, made any monitor\nunnecessary.'\n\n'However,' continued she, 'if you think that _my_ influence has\nprevented her entering into all the wild projects of Mr. Delamere,\ncontinue to believe, that while I am with her the same influence will\ninvariably be exerted to the same purpose.'\n\nDelamere and Emmeline, who were a few paces before them while this\ndialogue was passing, were now met by Parkinson, the colonel's servant,\nwho addressing himself to Delamere, told him that Lord Montreville and\none of the young ladies were that moment alighted from their carriage at\nthe inn, and had sent to his lodgings to enquire for him.\n\nMrs. Stafford advancing, heard the intelligence, and looked anxiously at\nEmmeline, who turned paler than death at the thoughts of Lord\nMontreville.\n\nDelamere was alternately red and pale. He hesitated, and tried to\nflatter himself that Parkinson was mistaken; while Fitz-Edward, who\nfound he should be awkwardly situated between the father and son,\nsilently meditated his defence.\n\nMrs. Stafford, who saw Emmeline ready to sink with the apprehension of\nbeing seen walking with Delamere, intreated the gentlemen to leave them\nand go to Lord Montreville; which she at length prevailed on them to do;\nDelamere pressing Emmeline's hand to his lips, and protesting, with a\nvehemence of manner particularly his own, that no power on earth should\noblige him to relinquish her.\n\nMrs. Stafford got the trembling Emmeline home as well as she could;\nwhere she endeavoured to strengthen her resolution and restore her\nspirits, by representing to her the perfect rectitude with which she had\nacted.\n\nBut poor Delamere, who had no such consolatory reflections, felt very\nuneasy, and would willingly have avoided the immediate explanation which\nhe saw must now take place with his father.\n\nHe determined, however, to temporize no longer; but being absolutely\nfixed in his resolution of marrying Emmeline, to tell his father so, and\nto meet all the effects of his anger at once.\n\nIn this disposition, he desired Fitz-Edward to leave him; and he entered\nalone the parlour of the inn where Lord Montreville waited for him. His\ncountenance expressed a mixture of anger and confusion; while that of\nhis Lordship betrayed yet sterner symptoms of the state of his mind.\n\nAugusta Delamere, her eyes red with weeping, and her voice faultering\nthrough agitation, arose, and met her brother half-way.\n\n'My dear brother!' said she, taking his hand.\n\nHe kissed her cheek; and bowing to his father, sat down.\n\n'I have taken the trouble to come hither, Sir,' said Lord Montreville,\n'in consequence of having received information of the wicked and\nunworthy pursuit in which you have engaged. I command you, upon your\nduty, instantly to return with me, and renounce for ever the scandalous\nproject of seducing an innocent young woman, whom _you_ ought rather to\nrespect and whom _I_ will protect.'\n\n'I intend ever to do both, Sir; and when she is my wife, you will be\nreleased from the task of protecting her, and will only have to love her\nas much as her merit deserves. Be assured, my Lord, I have no such\ndesigns against the honour of Miss Mowbray as you impute to me. It is my\ndetermined and unalterable intention to marry her. Would to God your\nLordship would conquer the unreasonable prejudice which you have\nconceived against the only union which will secure the happiness of your\nson, and endeavour to reconcile my mother to a marriage on which I am\nresolved.'\n\nHaving pronounced these words in a resolute tone, he arose from his\nseat, bowed slightly to his father, and waving his hand to his sister,\nas if to prevent her following him, he walked indignantly out of the\nroom.\n\nLord Montreville made no effort to stop him. But the recollection of the\nfatal indulgence with which he had been brought up recurred forcibly to\nhis Lordship's mind; and he felt his anger against his son half subdued\nby the reproaches he had to make himself. The very sight of this darling\nson, was so gratifying, that he almost forgot his errors when he beheld\nhim.\n\nAfter a moment's pause, Lord Montreville said to his daughter, 'You see,\nAugusta, the disposition your brother is in. Violent measures will, I\nfear, only make him desperate. We must try what can be done by Miss\nMowbray herself, who will undoubtedly consent to elude his pursuit, and\ntime may perhaps detach him from it entirely. For this purpose, I would\nhave _you_ see Emmeline to-morrow early; and having talked to her, we\ncan consider on what to determine. To night, try to recover your\nfatigue.'\n\n'Let me go to night, Sir,' said his daughter.--'It is not yet more than\neight o'clock, and I am sensible of no fatigue that should prevent my\nseeing the young lady immediately.'\n\nLord Montreville assenting, Miss Delamere, attended by a servant, walked\nto the house of Mrs. Watkins.\n\nThe door was opened by the good woman herself; and on enquiry for Miss\nMowbray, she desired the lady to walk in, and sit down in her little\nroom, while she went up to let Miss know.--'For I can't tell,' said she,\n(folding up a stocking she was knitting) 'whether she be well enough to\nsee a strange gentlewoman. She have been but poorly for this week; and\nto night, after she came from walking, she was in such a taking, poor\nthing, we thought she'd a had a fit; and so Madam Stafford, who is just\ngone, bid her she should lie down a little and keep quiet.'\n\nThis account, added to the disquiet of the fair mediatrix; who fancied\nthe heart of Emmeline could hardly fail of being of Delamere's party,\nand that uneasiness at his father's arrival occasioned the agitation of\nher spirits which Mrs. Watkins described.\n\nMrs. Watkins returned immediately, saying that Miss Emmy would be down\nin a moment.\n\nEmmeline instantly guessed who it was, by the description of the young\nLady and the livery of the servant who attended her: and now, with a\nbeating heart and uncertain step, she entered the room.\n\nMiss Delamere had been prepared to see a very beautiful person: but the\nfair figure whom she now beheld, though less dazlingly handsome than she\nexpected, was yet more interesting and attractive than she would have\nappeared in the highest bloom of luxuriant beauty. Her late illness had\nrobbed her cheeks of that tender bloom they usually boasted; timidity\nand apprehension deprived her of much of the native dignity of her\nmanner; yet there was something in her face and deportment that\ninstantly prejudiced Miss Delamere in her favour, and made her\nacknowledge that her brother's passion had at least personal charms for\nit's excuse.\n\nA silent curtsey passed between the two ladies--and both being seated,\nMiss Delamere began.--\n\n'I believe, Miss Mowbray, you know that my father, Lord Montreville, in\nconsequence of a letter received from Mrs. Stafford, who is, he\nunderstands, a friend of your's, arrived here this morning.'\n\n'The letter, madam, was written at my particular request; that my Lord\ndid not notice it sooner, has, believe me, given me great concern.'\n\n'I do sincerely believe it; and every body must applaud your conduct in\nthis affair. My father was, by accident, prevented receiving the letter\nfor some weeks: as soon as it reached him, we set out, and he has now\nsent me to you, my dear cousin (for be assured I am delighted with the\nrelationship) to consult with you on what we ought to do.'\n\nEmmeline, consoled yet affected by this considerate speech, found\nherself relieved by tears.\n\n'Though I am unable, madam,' said she, recovering herself, 'to advise,\nbe assured I am ready to do whatever you and Lord Montreville shall\ndictate, to put an end to the projects your brother so perseveringly\nattempts. Ah! Miss Delamere; my situation is singularly distressing. It\ndemands all your pity; all your father's protection!'\n\n'You have, you shall have both, my dear Emmeline! as well as our\nadmiration for your noble and heroic conduct; and I beg you will not, by\nbeing thus uneasy, injure your health and depress your spirits.'\n\nThis and many other consoling speeches, delivered in the persuasive\nvoice of friendly sympathy, almost restored Emmeline to her usual\ncomposure; and after being together near an hour, Miss Delamere took her\nleave, charmed with her new acquaintance, and convinced that she would\ncontinue to act with the most exact obedience to the wishes of Lord\nMontreville.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nLord Montreville, on hearing from his daughter what had passed between\nher and Emmeline, was disposed to hope, that since she was so willing to\nassist in terminating for ever the views of Delamere, they should be\nable to prevail on him to relinquish them.\n\nWhile Miss Delamere was with Emmeline, his Lordship had himself waited\non Mrs. Stafford, to whom he thought himself obliged.\n\nHe thanked her for the letter with which she had favoured him; and said,\n'that having heard of the great regard with which she honoured Miss\nMowbray, he waited on her to beg her advice in the present difficult\ncircumstance. Since Mr. Delamere has pursued her hither,' said his\nLordship, 'she cannot remain here; but to find a situation that will be\nproper for her, and concealed from him, I own appears so difficult, that\nI know not on what to determine.'\n\n'My Lord,' answered Mrs. Stafford, 'I intended to have asked your\nLordship's permission to have been favoured with Miss Mowbray's company\nfor some months; and still hope to be indulged with it when I return\nhome. But could I go thither now, which I cannot, (my house not being in\na condition to receive me,) it would be impossible to prevent Mr.\nDelamere's knowledge of her abode, if she was with me. But surely Mr.\nDelamere will leave this place with you, and will not oblige Miss\nMowbray to quit her home to avoid him.'\n\n'Ah, madam!' answered Lord Montreville, 'you do not yet know my son. The\nimpetuosity of his temper, which has never been restrained, it is now\nout of my power to check; whatever he determines on he will execute, and\nI have too much reason to fear that opposition only serves to strengthen\nhis resolution. While Emmeline is here, it will be impossible to prevail\non him to quit the place: and though her behaviour has hitherto been\nirreproachable and meritorious, how can I flatter myself that so young a\nwoman will continue steadily to refuse a marriage, which would not only\nrelieve her at once from the difficulties and dependance of her\nsituation, but raise her to an elevated rank, and a splendid fortune.'\n\n'To which,' said Mrs. Stafford, 'she would do honour. I do not, however,\npresume to offer my opinion to your Lordship. You have, undoubtedly,\nvery strong reasons for your opposition to Mr. Delamere's wishes: and\nhis affluent fortune and future rank certainly give him a right to\nexpect both the one and the other in whoever he shall marry. But a more\nlovely person, a better heart, a more pure and elegant mind, he will no\nwhere meet with. Miss Mowbray will reflect as much credit as she can\nborrow, on any family to which she may be allied.'\n\n'I acknowledge, madam, that Miss Mowbray is a very amiable young woman;\nbut she never can be the wife of my son; and you I am sure are too\nconsiderate to give any encouragement to so impossible an idea.'\n\nAfter some farther conversation, Mrs. Stafford promised to endeavour to\nrecollect a proper situation for Miss Mowbray, where she might be\nsecured from the importunities of Delamere; and his Lordship took his\nleave.\n\nBy six o'clock the next morning, Delamere was at Mrs. Watkins's door;\nand nobody being visible but the maid servant, he entered the parlour,\nand told her he wanted to speak with Miss Mowbray; but would wait until\nshe arose.\n\nThe maid told her mistress, who immediately descended; and Delamere, who\nwas known to her as a young Lord who was in love with Miss Emmy, was\ncourteously invited to her own parlour, and she offered to go up with\nany message he should be pleased to send.\n\nHe begged she would only say to Miss Mowbray that a gentleman desired to\nspeak to her on business of consequence.\n\nBut the good woman, who thought she could do more justice to her\nemployer, told Emmeline, who was dressing herself, that 'the handsome\nyoung Lord, as used to walk every night with her and Madam Stafford, was\nbelow, and wanted to speak to her directly.'\n\nAt this information, Emmeline was extremely alarmed. She considered\nherself as particularly bound by what had passed the evening before\nbetween her and Augusta Delamere, to avoid her brother; and such an\ninterview as he now demanded must have an appearance to Lord Montreville\nof which she could not bear to think. She desired Mrs. Watkins,\ntherefore, to let the gentleman know that she was not well, and could\nnot see any body.\n\n'Why, Lord, Miss!' exclaimed the officious landlady, 'what can you mean\nnow by that? What! go for to refuse seeing such an handsome young man,\nwho is a Lord, and the like of that? I am sure it is so foolish, that I\nshan't carry no such message.'\n\n'Send Betty with it then,' answered Emmeline coldly; 'let her inform the\ngentleman I cannot be seen.'\n\n'Well,' said Mrs. Watkins, as she descended, 'it is strange nonsense, to\nmy fancy; but some folks never knows what they would be at.'\n\nShe then returned to the parlour, and very reluctantly delivered the\nanswer to Mr. Delamere; who asked if Emmeline was really ill?\n\n'Ill,' said the complaisant hostess, 'I see nothing that ails her: last\nnight, indeed, she was in a desperate taking, and we had much ado to\nhinder her from going into a fit; but to day I am sure she looks as if\nshe was as well as ever.'\n\nDelamere asked for a pen and ink, with which she immediately furnished\nhim; and as she officiously offered to get him some breakfast, he\naccepted it to gain time. While it was preparing he sent up to Emmeline\nthe following note:\n\n\n    'I came hither to entreat only one quarter of an hour's\n  conversation, which you cruelly deny me! You determine then,\n  Emmeline, to drive me to despair!\n\n    'You may certainly still refuse to see me; but you cannot oblige\n  me to quit this place, or to lose sight of your abode. My father\n  will, therefore, gain nothing by his ill-judged journey hither.\n\n    'But if you will allow me the interview I solicit, and after it\n  still continue to desire my absence, I will give you my promise to\n  go from hence to-morrow.\n\n                                                        F. DELAMERE.'\n\n\nThe maid was sent up with this billet to Emmeline; who, after a moment's\nconsideration, determined to send it to Miss Delamere, and to tell her,\nin an envelope, how she was situated.\n\nHaving enclosed it therefore, and desired the maid to go with it without\nsaying whither she was going, she bid her, as she went through the\nhouse, deliver to Mr. Delamere another note, which was as follows:\n\n\n  'Sir,\n\n    'Your request of an interview, I think myself obliged on every\n  account to refuse. I am extremely sorry you determine to persevere\n  in offering me proposals, to which, though they do me a very high\n  and undeserved honour, I never ought to listen; and excuse me if I\n  add, that I never will.\n\n                                                  EMMELINE MOWBRAY.'\n\n\nEmmeline had not before so positively expressed her rejection of\nDelamere's addresses. The peremptory stile, therefore, of this billet,\nadded to his extreme vexation at being overtaken by his father, and the\nlittle hope that seemed to remain for him any way, operated altogether\non his rash and passionate disposition, and seemed to affect him with a\ntemporary phrenzy. He stamped about the room, dashed his head against\nthe wainscot, and seizing Mrs. Watkins by the arm, swore, with the most\nfrightful vehemence, that he would see Miss Mowbray though death were in\nthe way.\n\nThe woman concluding he was mad, screamed out to her husband, who\ndescending from his chamber in astonishment, put himself between his\nwife and the stranger, demanding his business?\n\n'Alack-a-day!' cried Mrs. Watkins, 'tis the young Lord. He is gone mad,\nto be sure, for the love of Miss up stairs!'\n\nEmmeline, who in so small a house could not avoid hearing all that\npassed, now thought it better to go down; for she knew enough of\nDelamere to fear that the effects of his fit of passion might be very\nserious; and was certain that nothing could be more improper than so\nmuch confusion.\n\nShe therefore descended the stairs, with trembling feet, and entered\nMrs. Watkins's parlour; where she saw Delamere, his eyes flashing fire\nand his hands clenched, storming round the room, while Watkins followed\nhim, and bowing in his awkward way, 'begged his Honour would only please\nto be pacified.'\n\nThere was something so terrifying in the wild looks of the young man,\nthat Emmeline having only half opened the door, retreated again from it,\nand was hastening away. But Delamere had seen her; and darting out after\nher, caught her before she could escape out of the passage, and she was\ncompelled to return into the room with him; where, on condition of his\nbeing more composed, she agreed to sit down and listen to him.\n\nWatkins and his wife having left the room, Delamere again renewed his\nsolicitations for a Scottish expedition. 'However averse,' said he, 'my\nfather and mother may at present be to our marriage, I know they will be\nimmediately reconciled when it is irrevocable. But if you continue to\nharden your heart against me, of what advantage will it be to them?\nTheir ambition will still suffer; for I here swear by all that is\nsacred, that then I never will marry at all; and by my dying without\nposterity, their views will for ever be abortive, and their projects\ndisappointed.'\n\nTo this, and every other argument Delamere used, Emmeline answered,\n'that having determined never to accept of his hand, situated as she at\npresent was, nothing should induce her to break through a determination\nwhich alone could secure her the approbation of her own heart.'\n\nHe then asked her, 'whether, if the consent of Lord and Lady Montreville\ncould be obtained, she would continue averse to him?'\n\nThis question she evaded, by saying, 'that it was to no purpose to\nconsider how she should act in an event so unlikely to happen.'\n\nHe then again exerted all the eloquence which love rather than reason\nlent him. But Emmeline combated his arguments with those of rectitude\nand honour, by which she was resolutely bent to abide.\n\nThis steadiness, originating from principles he could not controvert or\ndeny, seemed, while it shewed him all its hopelessness, to give new\nforce to his passion. He became again almost frantic, and was anew\nacting the part of a madman, when Mrs. Stafford and Miss Delamere\nentered the house, and enquiring for Miss Mowbray, were shewn into the\nroom where she was with Delamere; who, almost exhausted by the violence\nof those emotions he had so boundlessly indulged, had now thrown himself\ninto a chair, with his head leaning against the wainscot; his hair was\ndishevelled, his eyes swoln, and his countenance expressed so much\npassionate sorrow, that Augusta Delamere, extremely shocked, feared to\nspeak to him; while Emmeline, on the opposite side of the room, sat with\nher handkerchief to her eyes; and as soon as she saw Mrs. Stafford, she\nthrew herself into her arms and sobbed aloud.\n\nDelamere looked at Mrs. Stafford and his sister, but spoke to neither;\ntill Augusta approaching him, would have taken his hand; but he turned\nfrom her.\n\n'Oh, Frederic!' cried she, 'I beseech you to consider the consequence of\nall this.'\n\n'I consider nothing!' said he, starting up and going to the window.\n\nHis sister followed him.\n\n'Go, go,' said he, turning angrily from her--'Go, leave me, leave me!\nassist Lord Montreville to destroy his only son! go, and be a party in\nthe cruel policy that will make you and Fanny heiresses!'\n\nThe poor girl, who really loved her brother better than any thing on\nearth, was quite overwhelmed by this speech; and her tears now flowed as\nfast as those of Emmeline, who continued to weep on the bosom of Mrs.\nStafford.\n\nDelamere looked at them both with a stern and angry countenance; then\nsuddenly catching his sister by the hand, which he eagerly grasped, he\nsaid, in a low but resolute voice--'Tears, Augusta, are of no use. Do\nnot lament me, but try to help me. I am now going out for the whole day;\nfor I will not see my father only to repeat to him what I have already\nsaid. Before I return, see what you can do towards persuading him to\nconsent to my marriage with Miss Mowbray; for be assured that if he does\nnot, the next meeting, in which I expect his answer, will be the last we\nshall have.'\n\nHe then snatched up his hat, and disengaging himself from his sister,\nwho attempted to detain him, he went hastily out of the house; leaving\nMrs. Stafford, Miss Mowbray, and his sister, under great uneasiness and\nalarm.\n\nThey thought it necessary immediately to inform Lord Montreville of the\nwhole conversation, and Miss Delamere dispatched a note to Fitz-Edward,\ndesiring him to attend to the motions of his friend.\n\nFitz-Edward was at breakfast with Lord Montreville; who took the first\nopportunity of their being alone, to reproach him with some severity for\nwhat he had done.\n\nThe Colonel heard him with great serenity; and then began to justify\nhimself, by assuring his Lordship that he had accompanied Delamere only\nin hopes of being able to detach him from his pursuit, and because he\nthought it preferable to his being left wholly to himself. He declared\nthat he meant to have given Lord Montreville information, if there had\nappeared the least probability of Delamere's marriage; but that being\nperfectly convinced, from the character of Emmeline, that there was\nnothing to apprehend, he had every day hoped his friend would have\nquitted a project in which there seemed not the least likelihood of\nsuccess, and would have returned to his family cured of his passion.\n\nThough this was not all strictly true, Fitz-Edward possessed a sort of\nplausible and insinuating eloquence, which hardly ever failed of\nremoving every impression, however strong, against him; and Lord\nMontreville was conversing with him with his usual confidence and\nfriendship, when the note from Miss Delamere was brought in.\n\nHis Lordship, ever anxious for his son, gazed eagerly at it while\nFitz-Edward read it; and trembling, asked from whom it came?\n\nFitz-Edward put it into his hand; and having ran it over in breathless\nterror, his Lordship hurried out, directing all his servants to go\nseveral ways in search of Delamere; while he entreated Fitz-Edward to\nrun to whatever place he was likely to be in; and went himself to Mrs.\nStafford's lodging, who was by this time returned home.\n\nWhat he heard from her of the scene of the morning, contributed to\nencrease his alarm. The image of his son in all the wildness of\nungovernable passion, shook his nerves so much, that he seemed ready to\nfaint, yet unable to move to enquire where he was. As he could attend to\nnothing else, Mrs. Stafford told him how anxiously she had thought of a\nsituation for Emmeline, and that she believed she had at length found\none that would do, 'if,' said she, 'your Lordship cannot prevail on him\nto quit Swansea, which I think you had better attempt, though from the\nscene of this morning I own I despair of it more than ever.\n\n'The person with whom I hope to be able to place Miss Mowbray is Mrs.\nAshwood, the sister of Mr. Stafford. She has been two years a widow,\nwith three children, and resides at a village near London. She has a\nvery good fortune; and would be happy to have with her such a companion\nas Miss Mowbray, 'till I am so fortunate as to be enabled to take her\nmyself. As her connections and acquaintance lie in a different set of\npeople, and in a remote part of the country from those of Mr. Delamere,\nit is improbable, that with the precaution we shall take, he will ever\ndiscover her residence.'\n\nLord Montreville expressed his sense of Mrs. Stafford's kindness in the\nwarmest terms. He assured her that he should never forget the friendly\npart she had taken, and that if ever it was in his power to shew his\ngratitude by being so happy as to have the ability to serve her or her\nfamily, he should consider it as the most fortunate event of his life.\n\nMrs. Stafford heard this as matter of course; and would have felt great\ncompassion for Lord Montreville, whose state of mind was truly\ndeplorable, but she reflected that he had really been the author of his\nown misery: first, by bringing up his son in a manner that had given\nsuch boundless scope to his passions; and now, by refusing to gratify\nhim in marrying a young woman, who was, in the eye of unprejudiced\nreason, so perfectly unexceptionable. She advised him to try once more\nto prevail on his son to leave Swansea with him; and he left her to\nenquire whether Fitz-Edward had yet found Delamere, whose absence gave\nhim the most cruel uneasiness.\n\nFitz-Edward, after a long search, had overtaken Delamere on an\nunfrequented common, about a mile from the town, where he was walking\nwith a quick pace; and seeing Fitz-Edward, endeavoured to escape him.\nBut when he found he could not avoid him, he turned fiercely towards\nhim--'Why do you follow me, Sir? Is it not enough that you have broken\nthrough the ties of honour and friendship in betraying me to my father?\nmust you still persecute me with your insidious friendship?'\n\nFitz-Edward heard him with great coolness; and without much difficulty\nconvinced him that Miss Mowbray herself had given the information to\nLord Montreville by means of Mrs. Stafford.\n\nThis conviction, while it added to the pain and mortification of\nDelamere, greatly reconciled him to Fitz-Edward, whom he had before\nsuspected; and after a long conversation, which Fitz-Edward so managed\nas to regain some degree of power over the passions of his impetuous\nfriend, he persuaded him to go and dine with Lord Montreville; having\nfirst undertaken for his Lordship that nothing should be said on the\nsubject which occupied the thoughts of the father; on which condition\nonly the son consented to meet him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nNotwithstanding the steadiness Emmeline had hitherto shewn in rejecting\nthe clandestine addresses of Delamere, he still hoped they would\nsucceed. A degree of vanity, pardonable in a young man possessing so\nmany advantages of person and fortune, made him trust to those\nadvantages, and to his unwearied assiduity, to conquer her reluctance.\nHe determined therefore to persevere; and did not imagine it was likely\nhe could again lose sight of her by a stratagem, against which he was\nnow on his guard.\n\nAs he fancied Lord Montreville and his sister designed to carry her with\nthem when they went, he kept a constant eye on their motions, and set\nhis own servant, and Fitz-Edward's valet, to watch the servants of Lord\nMontreville.\n\nFitz-Edward, who had been so near losing the confidence of both the\nfather and son, found it expedient to observe a neutrality, which it\nrequired all his address to support; being constantly appealed to by\nthem both.\n\nLord Montreville, he advised to adhere to moderate measures and gentle\npersuasions, and to trust to Emmeline's own strength of mind and good\nconduct; while to Delamere he recommended dissimulation; and advised him\nto quit Swansea at present, which would prevent Emmeline's being removed\nfrom thence, and leave it in his power at any time to see her again.\n\nLord Montreville, on cooler reflection, was by no means satisfied with\nFitz-Edward. To encourage his son's project, and even to accompany him\nin it, in the vain hope of detaching him from Emmeline before an\nirrevocable engagement could be formed, seemed to be at least very\nblameable; and if he had seen the connection likely to take place on a\nless honourable footing, his conduct was more immoral, if not so\nimpolitic.\n\nEither way, Lord Montreville felt it so displeasing, that he determined\nnot to trust Fitz-Edward in what he now meditated, which was, to remove\nEmmeline from Swansea before he and his daughter quitted it, and to\nplace her with the sister of Mr. Stafford; who being now arrived, had\nengaged to obtain his sister's concurrence with their plan.\n\nA female council therefore was held on the means of Emmeline's removal;\nand it was settled that a post-chaise should, on the night fixed, be in\nwaiting at the distance of half a mile from the town; where Emmeline\nshould meet it; and that a servant of Mr. Stafford should accompany her\nto London, who was from thence to return to his master's house in\nDorsetshire.\n\nThis arrangement being made three days after the arrival of Lord\nMontreville, and his faithful old valet being employed to procure the\nchaise, the hour arrived when poor Emmeline was again to abandon her\nlittle home, where she had passed many tranquil and some delightful\ndays; and where she was to bid adieu to her two beloved friends,\nuncertain when she should see them again.\n\nHer friendship for Mrs. Stafford was enlivened by the warmest gratitude.\nTo her she owed the acquisition of much useful knowledge, as well as\ninstruction in those elegant accomplishments to which she was naturally\nso much attached, but which she had no former opportunity of acquiring.\nThe charms of her conversation, the purity of her heart, and the\nsoftness of her temper, made her altogether a character which could not\nbe known without being beloved; and Emmeline, whose heart was open to\nall the enchanting impressions of early friendship, loved her with the\ntruest affection. The little she had seen of Augusta Delamere, had given\nthat young lady the second place in her heart. They were of the same\nage, within a few weeks. Augusta Delamere extremely resembled the\nMowbray family: and there was, in figure and voice, a very striking\nsimilitude between her and Emmeline Mowbray.\n\nLady Montreville, passionately attached to her son, as the heir and\nrepresentative of her family, and partial to her eldest daughter for her\ngreat resemblance to herself, seemed on them to have exhausted all her\nmaternal tenderness, and to have felt for Augusta but a very inferior\nshare of affection.\n\nOf the haughty and supercilious manners which made Lady Montreville\nfeared and disliked, she had communicated no portion to her younger\ndaughter; and if she had acquired something of the family pride, her\ngood sense, and the sweetness of her temper, had so much corrected it,\nthat it was by no means displeasing.\n\nElegantly formed as she was, and with a face, which, tho' less fair than\nthat of Emmeline was almost as interesting, her mother had yet always\nexpressed a disapprobation of her person; and she had therefore herself\nconceived an indifferent opinion of it; and being taught to consider\nherself inferior in every thing to her elder sister, she never fancied\nshe was superior to others; nor, though highly accomplished, and\nparticularly skilled in music, did she ever obtrude her acquisitions on\nher friends, or anxiously seek opportunities of displaying them.\n\nHer heart was benevolent and tender; and her affection for her brother,\nthe first of it's passions. She could never discover that he had a\nfault; and the error in regard to Emmeline, which his father so much\ndreaded, appeared to his sister a virtue.\n\nShe was deeply read in novels, (almost the only reading that young women\nof fashion are taught to engage in;) and having from them acquired many\nof her ideas, she imagined that Delamere and Emmeline were born for each\nother; though she dared not appear to encourage hopes so totally\nopposite to those of her family, she found, after she had once seen and\nconversed with Emmeline, that she never could warmly oppose an union\nwhich she was convinced would make her brother happy.\n\nShe fancied that Emmeline could not be insensible to Delamere's love;\nshe even believed she saw many symptoms of regard for him in her manner,\nand that she made the most heroic sacrifice of her love to her duty,\nwhen she resigned him: a sacrifice which heightened, almost to\nenthusiasm, the pity and esteem felt for her by Augusta Delamere; and\nthough they had known each other only a few days, a sisterly affection\nhad taken place between them.\n\nBut from these two friends, so tenderly and justly beloved, Emmeline was\nnow to depart, and to be thrown among strangers, where it was improbable\nshe would meet with any who would supply the loss of them. Her duty\nhowever demanded this painful effort; and she determined to execute it\nwith courage and resolution.\n\nDelamere was so perpetually about his father, that it was judged\nimproper for him to hold any private conference with Emmeline, lest\nsomething should be suspected.\n\nHis Lordship therefore sent her by Mrs. Stafford a bank note of fifty\npounds; with his thanks for the propriety of her conduct, and an\nassurance, that while she continued to merit his protection, he should\nconsider her as his daughter, and take care to supply her with money,\nand every thing else she might wish for. He desired she would not write;\nlest her hand should be known, and her abode traced; but said, that in a\nfew weeks he would see her himself, and wished her all possible health\nand happiness.\n\nOn the night of her departure, instead of retiring to rest at the usual\nhour, Emmeline dressed herself in a travelling dress, and passed some\nmelancholy hours waiting for the signal of her departure.\n\nAt half past two in the morning, every thing being profoundly quiet, she\nsaw, from her window, her two friends, who had declared they would not\nleave her 'till they saw her in the chaise.\n\nShe took with her only a small parcel of linen, Mrs. Stafford having\nengaged to forward the rest to an address agreed upon; and softly\ndescending the stairs for fear of alarming Mrs. Watkins, she opened the\ndoor; and each of her friends taking an arm, they passed over two\nfields, into a lane where the chaise was waiting with the servant who\nwas to go with her.\n\nThe tears had streamed from her eyes during the little walk, and she was\nunable to speak. The servant now opened the chaise door and let down the\nstep; and Emmeline kissing the hand of Mrs. Stafford, and then that of\nAugusta Delamere, went hastily into it--'God bless you both!' said she,\nin a faint and inarticulate voice. The servant shut the door, mounted a\npost horse, and the chaise was in an instant out of sight; while the two\nladies, who at any other time would have been alarmed at being obliged\nto take so late a walk, thought not of themselves; but full of concern\nfor poor Emmeline, went back in tears; and Miss Delamere, who had agreed\nto remain the rest of that night at the lodgings of Mrs. Stafford,\nretired not to rest, but to weep for the departure of her friend and the\ndistress of her brother.\n\nEmmeline, thus separated from every body she loved, pursued her journey\nmelancholy and repining.\n\nThe first hour, she wept bitterly, and accused her destiny of caprice\nand cruelty. But tho' to the unfortunate passion of Delamere she owed\nall the inconvenience she had lately experienced, she could not resolve\nto hate him; but found a degree of pity and regard perpetually mingled\nitself with his idea in her heart. Yet she was not in love; and had\nrather the friendship of a sister for him than any wish to be his wife.\n\nHad there been no impediments to their union, she would have married\nhim, rather to make him happy than because she thought it would make\nherself so; but she would have seen him married to another, and have\nrejoiced at it, if he had found felicity.\n\nAn attachment like his, which had resisted long absence, and was\nundiminished by insuperable difficulties, could hardly fail of having\nit's effect on the tender and susceptible mind of Emmeline. But whatever\naffection she felt, it by no means arose to what a romantic girl would\nhave perhaps fancied it; and she was much more unhappy at quitting the\ndear Augusta than at the uncertainty she was in whether she should ever\nagain see Delamere.\n\nThe parting was extremely embittered by the prohibition she had received\nin regard to writing to her. But painful as it was, she determined to\nforbear; and steadily to adhere to that line of duty, however difficult\nto practice, that only could secure the peace of her mind, by the\nacquittal of her conscience; which, as she had learned from Mrs.\nStafford, as well as from her own experience, short as it was, could\nalone support her in every trial to which she might be exposed.\n\nShe reflected on her present situation, compared to what it would have\nbeen had she been prevailed upon to become the wife of Delamere against\nthe consent of his family.\n\nSplendid as his fortune was, and high as his rank would raise her above\nher present lot of life, she thought that neither would reconcile her to\nthe painful circumstance of carrying uneasiness and contention into his\nfamily; of being thrown from them with contempt, as the disgrace of\ntheir rank and the ruin of their hopes; and of living in perpetual\napprehension lest the subsiding fondness of her husband should render\nher the object of his repentance and regret.\n\nThe regard she was sensible of for Delamere did not make her blind to\nhis faults; and she saw, with pain, that the ungovernable violence of\nhis temper frequently obscured all his good qualities, and gave his\ncharacter an appearance of ferocity, which offered no very flattering\nprospect to whosoever should be his wife.\n\nBy thus reasoning with herself, she soon became more calm, and more\nreconciled to that destiny which seemed not to design her for Delamere.\n\nShe met with no remarkable occurrence in her journey; and on the evening\nof the third day arrived in town; where the servant who attended her was\nordered to dismiss the chaise, and to procure her an hackney coach, in\nwhich she proceeded to the house of Mrs. Ashwood.\n\nThis residence, situated in a populous village three miles from London,\nbore the appearance of wealth and prosperity. The iron gate, which gave\nentrance into a large court, was opened by a servant in a laced livery,\nto whom Emmeline delivered the letter she had brought from Mrs.\nStafford, and after a moment's waiting the lady herself came out to\nreceive her.\n\nEmmeline, by the splendour of her dress, concluded she had left a large\ncompany: but being ushered into a parlour, found she had been drinking\ntea alone; of which, or of any other refreshment, Miss Mowbray was\ndesired to partake.\n\nHer reception of her visitor was perfectly cordial; and Emmeline soon\nrecovering her easy and composed manner, Mrs. Ashwood seemed very much\npleased with her guest; for there was in her countenance a passport to\nall hearts.\n\nMrs. Ashwood, tho' not in the bloom of life, and tho' she never had been\nhandsome, was so unconscious of her personal disadvantages, that she\nimagined herself the object of admiration of one sex and of the\nimitation of the other. With the most perfect reliance on the graces of\na figure which never struck any other person as being at all remarkable,\nshe dressed with an exuberance of expence; and kept all the company her\nneighbourhood afforded.\n\nWhere her ruling passions, (the love of admiration and excessive vanity)\ndid not interfere, she was sometimes generous and sometimes friendly.\nBut her ideas of her own perfections, both of person and mind, far\nexceeding the truth, she had often the mortification to find that others\nby no means thought of them as she did; and then her good humour was far\nfrom invincible.\n\nThough Emmeline soon found her conversation very inferior to what she\nhad of late been accustomed to, she thought herself fortunate in having\nfound an asylum, the mistress of which seemed desirous of making it\nagreeable; and to which she was introduced by the kindness of her\nbeloved Mrs. Stafford.\n\nBut while serenity was returning to the bosom of Emmeline, that of poor\nDelamere was torn with the cruellest tempest. The morning after\nEmmeline's departure, Delamere, who expected no such thing, arose at his\nusual hour and rode out alone, as he had frequently done. As he passed\nher window, he looked up to it, and seeing it open, concluded she was in\nher room.\n\nOn his return, his father met him, and asked him to breakfast; but he\ndesigned to attend the tea-table of Mrs. Stafford, where he thought he\nshould meet Emmeline, and therefore excused himself; and Lord\nMontreville, who wished the discovery to be delayed to as late an hour\nof the day as possible, let him go thither, where he breakfasted; and\nthen proposed a walk to Mrs. Stafford, which he hoped would include a\nvisit to Emmeline, or at least that Mrs. Stafford would not walk without\nher. She excused herself, however, on pretence of having letters to\nwrite; and Delamere went in search of Fitz-Edward, whom he could not\nfind.\n\nIt was now noon, and he grew impatient at not having had even a glimpse\nof Emmeline the whole morning, when he met Fitz-Edward's man, and asked\nhim hastily where his master was?\n\nThe man hesitated, and looked as if he had a secret which he contained\nwith some uneasiness. 'Sir,' said he, 'have you seen Miss Mowbray\nto-day?'\n\n'No--why do you ask?'\n\n'Because, Sir,' said the fellow, 'I shrewdly suspect that she went away\nfrom here last night. I can't tell your Honour why I thinks so; but you\nmay soon know the truth on't.'\n\nThe ardent imagination of Delamere instantly caught fire. He took it for\ngranted that Fitz-Edward had carried her off: and without staying to\nreflect a moment, he flew to the inn where his horses were, and ordered\nthem to be saddled; then rushing into the room where his father and\nsister were sitting together, he exclaimed--'she is gone, Sir--Emmeline\nis gone!--but I will soon overtake her; and the infamous villain who has\ntorn her from me!'\n\nLord Montreville scorned to dissimulate. He answered, 'I know she is\ngone, and it was by my directions she went. You cannot overtake her; nor\nis it probable you will ever see her again. Endeavour therefore to\nrecollect yourself, and do not forget what you owe to your family and\nyourself.'\n\nDelamere attended but little to this remonstrance; but still\nprepossessed with the idea of Fitz-Edward's being gone with her, he\nswore perpetual vengeance against him, and that he would pursue him\nthrough the world.\n\nWith this resolution on his lips, and fury in his eyes, he quitted his\nfather's apartment, and at the door met Fitz-Edward himself, coming to\nenquire after him.\n\nHe was somewhat ashamed of the hasty conclusion he had made, and was\ntherefore more disposed to hear what Fitz-Edward had to say, who\npresently convinced him that he was entirely ignorant of the flight of\nEmmeline.\n\nDelamere now insisted, that as a proof of his friendship he would\ninstantly set out with him in pursuit of her.\n\nFitz-Edward knew not what to do; but however seemed to consent; and\nsaying he would order his servant to get his horse, left him, and went\nto Lord Montreville, to whom he represented the impracticability of\nstopping Delamere.\n\nHis Lordship, almost certain that Emmeline was out of the possibility of\nhis overtaking her, as she had now been gone thirteen hours, thought it\nbetter for Fitz-Edward, if he could not prevent his departure, to go\nwith him: but he desired him to make as many artificial delays as\npossible.\n\nDelamere, in the mean time, had been to Mrs. Stafford, and tried to\nforce from her the secret of Emmeline's route. But she was inexorable;\nand proof against his phrenzy as well as his persuasion. She held him,\nhowever, as long as she could, in discourse. But when he found she only\ntried to make him lose time, he left her, in an agony of passion, and\nmounting his horse, while his trembling servants were ordered to follow\nhim on pain of instant dismission, he rode out of the town without\nseeing his father, leaving a message for Fitz-Edward that he had taken\nthe London road, and expected he would come after him instantly.\n\nLord Montreville intreated Fitz-Edward to lose not a moment; and bidding\nan hasty adieu to his Lordship, he ordered his horses to the door of\nMrs. Stafford, where he took a formal leave of her and her husband,\nentreating permission to renew his acquaintance hereafter. Then getting\non horseback, he made as much speed as possible after Delamere; whom\nwith difficulty he overtook some miles forward on the London road.\n\nThis way Delamere had taken on conjecture only; but after proceeding\nsome time, he had met a waggoner, whom he questioned. The man told him\nof a post chaise he had met at four o'clock in the morning; and\nencouraged by that to proceed, he soon heard from others enough to make\nhim believe he was right.\n\nThe horses, however, at the end of forty miles, were too much fatigued\nto keep pace with Delamere's impatience. He was obliged to wait three\nhours before post horses could be found for himself and Fitz-Edward. His\nservants were obliged to remain yet longer; and the horses which were\nat length procured, were so lame and inadequate to the journey, that it\nwas six hours before they reached the next stage; where the same\ndifficulty occurred; and Delamere, between the fatigue of his body and\nanxiety of his mind, found himself compelled to take some rest.\n\nThe next day he still traced Emmeline from stage to stage, and imagined\nhimself very near her: but the miserable horse on which he rode, being\nunable to execute his wish as to speed, and urged beyond his strength,\nfell with him in a stage about sixty miles from London; by which\naccident he received a contusion on his breast, and was bruised so much\nthat Fitz-Edward insisted on his being blooded and put to bed; and then\nwent to the apothecary of the village near which the accident happened,\nand procuring a phial of laudanum, infused it into the wine and water\nwhich Delamere drank, and by that artifice obtained for him the repose\nhe otherwise would not have been prevailed on to take.\n\nAfter having slept several hours, he desired to pursue his journey in a\npost chaise; but Fitz-Edward had taken care that none should be\nimmediately to be had. By these delays only it was that Emmeline reached\nLondon some hours before him.\n\nHowever, when he renewed his journey, he still continued to trace her\nfrom stage to stage, till the last postillion who drove her was found.\n\nHe said, that he was ordered to stop at the first stand of coaches, into\none of which the lady went, and, with the servant behind, drove away;\nbut the lad neither knew the number of the coach, or recollected the\ncoachman, or did he remember whither the coach was ordered to go.\n\nDelamere passed two days, questioning all the coachmen on the stand; and\nin consequence of information pretended to be given by some of them, he\ngot into two or three quarrels by going to houses they pointed out to\nhim. And after offering and giving rewards which only seemed to redouble\nhis difficulties, he appeared to be farther than ever from any\nprobability of finding the fair fugitive he so anxiously sought.\n\nLord Montreville and his daughter staid only two days at Swansea after\nhis departure. They travelled in very indifferent spirits to London;\nwhere they found Delamere ill at the lodgings of Fitz-Edward in\nHill-street.\n\nLord Montreville found there was nothing alarming in his son's\nindisposition; but could not persuade him to accompany him to Lady Mary\nOtley's.\n\nHis Lordship and Miss Augusta Delamere set out therefore for that place;\nleaving Delamere to the care of Fitz-Edward, who promised not to quit\nhim 'till he had agreed either to go to the Norfolk estate or to Mr.\nPercival's.\n\nLord Montreville was tolerably satisfied that he could not discover\nEmmeline; and Delamere having for above a fortnight attended at all\npublic places without seeing her, and having found every other effort to\nmeet her fruitless, reluctantly agreed to go to his father's estate in\nNorfolk.\n\nIt was now almost the end of August; and Fitz-Edward, after seeing him\npart of the way, took his leave of him, and again went to attend his\nduty in the North of Ireland.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nWhile Delamere, in the deepest despondence, which he could neither\nconquer or conceal, made a vain effort to divert his mind with those\namusements for which he no longer had any relish, Emmeline, at her new\nresidence, attracted the attention of many of Mrs. Ashwood's visitors.\n\nA widow, in possession of an handsome jointure, and her children amply\nprovided for, Mrs. Ashwood was believed to entertain no aversion to a\nsecond marriage: and her house being so near London, was frequented by a\ngreat number of single men; many of whom came there because it was a\npleasant jaunt from the city, where most of them resided; and others,\nwith hopes of amending their fortunes by an alliance with the lady\nherself.\n\nThese latter, however, were chiefly the younger sons of merchants; and\nthough pleased with their flattery and assiduity, Mrs. Ashwood, who had\nan almost equal share of vanity and ambition, had yet given no very\ndecided preference to any; for she imagined her personal attractions, of\nwhich she had a very high idea, added to the advantages of a good\nincome, good expectations, and opulent connections, entitled her to\nmarry into an higher line of life than that in which her father had\nfirst engaged her.\n\nHer acquaintance, however, was yet very limited among persons of\nfashion; and it was not wholly without hopes of encreasing it that she\nhad consented to receive Miss Mowbray, whose relationship to Lord\nMontreville would, she imagined, be the means of introducing her to his\nLordship's notice and to that of his family.\n\nHer civility and kindness to Emmeline were unbounded for some time. And\nas she was not easily convinced of her own want of beauty, she never\napprehended that she ran some risk of becoming a foil, instead of the\nfirst figure, as she expected generally to be.\n\nThe extreme simplicity of Emmeline's appearance, who notwithstanding the\nremonstrances of Mrs. Ashwood continued to dress nearly as she did in\nWales; and her perfect ignorance of fashionable life and fashionable\naccomplishments, gave her, in the eyes of many of Mrs. Ashwood's\nvisitors, the air of a dependant; and those who visited with a view to\nthe fortune of the latter, carefully avoided every appearance of\npreference to Emmeline, and kept her friend in good humour with herself.\n\nBut there were, among those who frequented her house, some men of\nbusiness; who being rather in middle life, and immensely rich, had no\nother views in going thither than to pass a few hours in the country,\nwhen their mercantile engagements prevented their leaving London\nentirely; and who loved pleasure better than any thing but money.\n\nWith one or two of these, Mrs. Ashwood and her father had at different\ntimes encouraged overtures of marriage. But they knew and enjoyed the\npleasure their fortune and single state afforded them too well to give\nthose indulgences up for the advantage of increasing their incomes,\nunless the object had possessed greater attractions than fell to the\nshare of Mrs. Ashwood; and her father could not be prevailed upon to\ngive her (at least while he lived) a sum of money large enough to tempt\ntheir avarice. These overtures therefore had ended in nothing more than\nan intercourse of civility.\n\nBut Emmeline no sooner appeared, than one of these gentlemen renewed his\nvisits with more than his original assiduity.\n\nThe extreme beauty of her person, and the _naivet\u00c3\u00a8_ of her manners, gave\nher, to him, the attractive charms of novelty; while the mystery there\nseemed to be about her, piqued his curiosity.\n\nIt was known that she was related to a noble family; but Mrs. Ashwood\nhad been so earnestly entreated to conceal as much as possible her real\nhistory, lest Delamere should hear of and discover her, that she only\ntold it to a few friends, and it had not yet reached the knowledge of\nMr. Rochely, who had become the attendant of Mrs. Ashwood's tea table\nfrom the first introduction of Emmeline.\n\nMr. Rochely was nearer fifty than forty. His person, heavy and badly\nproportioned, was not relieved by his countenance, which was dull and\nill-formed. His voice, monotonous and guttural, was fatiguing to the\near; and the singularity of his manners, as well as the oddness of his\nfigure, often excited a degree of ridicule, which the respect his riches\ndemanded could not always stifle.\n\nWith a person so ill calculated to inspire affection, he was very\ndesirous of being a favourite with the ladies; and extremely sensible of\ntheir attractions. In the inferior ranks of life, his money had procured\nhim many conquests, tho' he was by no means lavish of it; and much of\nthe early part of his time had been passed in low amours; which did not,\nhowever, impede his progress to the great wealth he possessed. He had\nalways intended to marry: but as he required many qualifications in a\nwife which are hardly ever united, he had hesitated till he had long\nbeen looked upon as an old bachelor.\n\nHe was determined to chuse beauty, but expected also fortune. He desired\nto marry a woman of family, yet feared the expensive turn of those\nbrought up in high life; and had a great veneration for wit and\naccomplishments, but dreaded, lest in marrying a woman who possessed\nthem, he should be liable to be governed by superior abilities, or be\ndespised for the mediocrity of his own understanding.\n\nWith such ideas, his relations saw him perpetually pursuing some\nmatrimonial project; but so easily frightened from his pursuit, that\nthey relied on his succession with the most perfect confidence.\n\nWhen first he beheld Emmeline, he was charmed with her person; her\nconversation, at once innocent and lively, impressed him with the most\nfavourable ideas of her heart and understanding; and, brought up at a\ngreat distance from London, she had acquired no taste for expences, no\nrage for those amusements and dissipations which he so much apprehended\nin a wife.\n\nWhen he came to Mrs. Ashwood's, (which was almost every afternoon)\nEmmeline, who was generally at work, or drawing in the dressing-room,\nnever discomposed herself; but sat quietly to what she was doing;\nlistening with the most patient complaisance to the long and\nuninteresting stories with which he endeavoured to entertain her; an\nattention which greatly contributed to win the heart of Rochely; and he\nwas as much in love as so prudent a man could be, before he ventured to\nask himself what he intended? or what was the family and what the\nfortune of the person who now occupied most of his time and a great\nportion of his thoughts?\n\nMrs. Ashwood, frequently engaged at the neighbouring card-tables, from\nwhich Emmeline almost always excused herself, often left her and Mr.\nRochely to drink tea together; and when she was at home, would sometimes\nmake her party in another room, where the subject of laughter with her\nown admirers, was the growing passion of the rich banker for the fair\nstranger.\n\nEmmeline did not, when present, escape ridicule on this subject: but as\nshe had not the least idea that a man so much older than herself had any\nintention of offering himself as an husband, she bore it with great\ntranquillity, and continued to behave to Mr. Rochely with the attentive\ncivility dictated by natural good breeding; while she heard, without any\nconcern but on his account, the perpetual mirth and loud bursts of\nlaughter which followed his compliments and attentions to her.\n\nIf he was absent a few days, the door of Mrs. Ashwood was crouded with\nservants and porters with game from Mr. Rochely. And his assiduities\nbecame at every visit more marked.\n\nAs it was now late in the autumn, Mrs. Ashwood was desirous of shewing\nMiss Mowbray some of those public places she had not yet seen; and\nEmmeline (not apprehending there was any reason to fear meeting Mr.\nDelamere at a season when she knew field sports kept him altogether in\nthe country) made no difficulty to accompany her.\n\nMr. Rochely no sooner heard a party to the play proposed, than he\ndesired to join it; and Mrs. Ashwood, Miss Galton, (an intimate friend\nof her's), with Miss Mowbray, Mr. Hanbury, (one of Mrs. Ashwood's\nadmirers), and Mr. Rochely, met at Drury-Lane Theatre; where Emmeline\nwas extremely well entertained.\n\nWhen the play was over, the box was filled with several of Mrs.\nAshwood's acquaintance, who talked to _her_, while their eyes were fixed\non her young friend; an observation that did not greatly lighten up her\ncountenance.\n\nThe most conspicuous among these was a tall, thin, but extremely awkward\nfigure, which in a most fashionable undress, and with a glass held to\nhis eye, strided into the box, and bowing with a strange gesture to Mrs.\nAshwood, exclaimed--'Oh! my dear Mrs. A!--here I am!--returned from Spa\nonly last night; and already at your feet. So here you are? and not yet\nenchained by that villainous fellow Hymen? You are a good soul, not to\ngive yourself away while I was at Spa. I was horridly afraid, my dear\nwidow! you would not have waited even to have given me a wedding\nfavour.'\n\nTo this speech, as it required no answer, Mrs. Ashwood gave very little;\nfor besides that she was not pleased with the matter, the manner\ndelighted her still less. The speaker had, during the whole of it,\nleaned almost across the person who was next to him, to bring his glass\nnearly close to Emmeline's face.\n\nEmmeline, extremely discomposed, drew back; and Mr. Rochely, who sat\nnear her, putting away the glass softly with his hand, said very calmly\nto the leaning beau--'Sir, is there any occasion to take an account of\nthis lady's features?'\n\n'Ah! my friend Rochely!' answered he familiarly, 'what are you the\nlady's Cicisbeo? as we say in Italy. Here is indeed beauty enough to\ndraw you from the contemplation of three per cent. consols, India bonds,\nomnium, scrip, and douceurs. But prithee, my old friend, is this young\nlady your ward?'\n\n'My ward! no,' answered Rochely, 'how came you to think she was?'\n\nMr. Elkerton, who fancied he had vastly the advantage in point of wit,\nas well as of figure, over his antagonist, now desired to know, 'whether\nthe lady was his niece? though if I had not recollected' said he, 'that\nyou never was married, I should have taken her for your grand daughter.'\n\nThis sarcasm had, on the features of Rochely, all the effect the\ntravelled man expected. But while he was preparing an answer, at which\nhe was never very prompt, the coach was announced to be ready, and\nEmmeline, extremely weary of her situation, and disgusted even to\nimpatience with her new acquaintance, hastily arose to go.\n\nElkerton offered to take her hand; which she drew from him without\nattempting to conceal her dislike; and accepting the arm of Rochely,\nfollowed Mrs. Ashwood; while Elkerton, determined not to lose sight of\nher, seized the hand of Miss Galton, who being neither young, handsome,\nor rich, had been left to go out alone: they followed the rest of the\nparty to the coach, where Mrs. Ashwood and Miss Mowbray were already\nseated, with Mr. Hanbury; who, as he resided with his mother in the\nvillage where Mrs. Ashwood lived, was to accompany them home.\n\nThe coach being full, seemed to preclude all possibility of Elkerton's\nadmittance. But he was not so easily put off: and telling Mrs. Ashwood\nhe intended to go home to sup with her, he stepped immediately in, and\nordered his servant, who waited at the coach door with a flambeau, to\ndirect his vis-a-vis to follow.\n\nRochely, who meant to have wished them a good night after seeing them to\ntheir carriage, was too much hurt by this happy essay of assurance not\nto resolve to counteract it's consequences. Elkerton, though not a\nvery young man, was near twenty years younger than Rochely; besides the\nincome of his business (for he was in trade) he had a large independent\nfortune, of which he was extremely lavish; his equipages were splendid;\nhis house most magnificently furnished; and his cloaths the most\nexpensive that could be bought.\n\nRochely, whose ideas of elegance, manners, or taste, were not very\nrefined, had no notion that the absurdity of Elkerton, or his\ndisagreeable person, would prevent his being a very formidable rival. He\ntherefore saw him with great pain accompany Emmeline home; and though he\nhad formed no positive designs himself, he could not bear to suppose\nthat another might form them with success.\n\nDirecting therefore his chariot to follow the coach, he was set down at\nthe door a few minutes after Mrs. Ashwood and her party; where Emmeline,\nstill more displeased with Elkerton, and having been teized by his\nimpertinent admiration the whole way, looked as if she could have burst\ninto tears.\n\nMrs. Ashwood, in a very ill humour, hardly attended to his flourishing\nspeeches with common civility; he had therefore recourse to Miss Galton,\nto whom he was giving the history of his travels, which seemed to take\nup much of his thoughts.\n\nMiss Galton, who by long dependance and repeated disappointments had\nacquired the qualifications necessary for a patient hearer, acquiesced\nin smiling silence to all his assertions; looked amazed in the right\nplace; and heard, with great complacency, his wonderful success at\ncards, and the favour he was in with women of the first fashion at Spa.\n\nThe entrance of Mr. Rochely gave no interruption to his discourse. He\nbowed slightly to him without rising, and then went on, observing that\nhe had now seen every part of Europe worth seeing, and meant, at least\nfor some years, to remain in England; the ladies of which country he\npreferred to every other, and therefore intended taking a wife among\nthem. Fortune was, he declared, to him no object; but he was determined\nto marry the handsomest woman he could meet with, for whom he was now\nlooking out.\n\nAs he said this, he turned his eyes towards Emmeline; who affecting not\nto hear him, tho' he spoke in so loud a tone as to make it unavoidable,\nwas talking in a low voice to Mr. Rochely.\n\nRochely placing himself close to her, had thrown his arm over the back\nof her chair; and leaning forward, attended to her with an expression in\nhis countenance of something between apprehension and hope, that gave it\nthe most grotesque look imaginable.\n\nMrs. Ashwood, who had been entertained apart by Mr. Hanbury, now hurried\nover the supper; during which Elkerton, still full of himself, engrossed\nalmost all the conversation; gave a detail of the purchases he had made\nabroad, and the trouble he had to land them; interspersed with _bon\nmots_ of French Marquises and German Barons, and witty remarks of an\nEnglish Duke with whom he had crossed the water on his return. But\nwhatever story he told, himself was still forwardest in the picture; his\nproject of marrying an handsome wife was again repeated; and he told the\nparty how charming a house he had bought in Kent, and how he had\nfurnished his library.\n\nRochely, who lay in wait to revenge himself for all the mortifications\nhe had suffered from him during the evening, took occasion to say, in\nhis grave, cold manner, 'to be sure a man of your taste and erudition,\nMr. Elkerton, cannot do without a library; but for my part, I think you\nwill find no books can say so much to the purpose as those kept by your\nlate father in Milk-street, Cheapside.'\n\nElkerton turned pale at this sneer; but forcing a smile of contempt,\nanswered, 'You bankers have no ideas out of your compting-houses; and\nrich as ye are, will never be any thing but _des bourgeois les plus\ngrossieres_! For my part I see no reason why--why a man's being in\nbusiness, should prevent his enjoying the _elegancies_ and _agr\u00c3\u00a9ments_\nof life, especially if he can _afford_ it; as it is well known, I\nbelieve, even to _you_, Sir, _that I can_.'\n\n'Oh! Sir,' replied Rochely, 'I know your late father was _reputed_ to\nhave died rich, and that no body has made a better _figure about town_\nthan _you_ have, ever since.'\n\n'As to figure, Sir,' returned the other, 'it is true I like to have\nevery thing about me _comme il faut_. And though I don't make fifty per\ncent. of money, as _some_ gentlemen do in _your_ way of business, I\nassure you, Sir, I do nothing that I cannot very well afford.'\n\nMrs. Ashwood, who thought it very likely a quarrel might ensue, here\nendeavoured to put an end to such very unpleasant discourse; and\nprevented Mr. Hanbury, who equally hated them both, from trying to\nirritate them farther, to which he maliciously inclined.\n\nThe hints, however, of fatigue, given by her and Miss Mowbray, obliged\nMr. Rochely to ring that his chariot might be called, which had waited\nat the door; while Elkerton, who had a pair of beautiful pied horses in\nhis vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis, desired to have them sent for from a neighbouring\ninn--'for _I_' said he, rising and strutting round the room, 'never\nsuffer _my_ people or _my_ horses to wait in the streets.'\n\nHe then leant over Emmeline's chair, and began in a court tone to renew\nhis compliments. But she suddenly arose; and begging Mrs. Ashwood would\ngive her leave to retire, wished Mr. Rochely and ladies a good night;\nand slightly curtseying to Elkerton, who was putting himself into the\nattitude for a speech and a bow, she tripped away.\n\nRochely, as soon as she was gone, hastened to his chariot; and Elkerton,\nwhose people were in no haste to leave the ale-house, begged to sit down\n'till they came.\n\nMrs. Ashwood had been the whole evening particularly out of humour, and\nbeing no longer able to command it, answered peevishly, 'that her house\nwas much at his service, but that she was really so much fatigued she\nmust retire--however,' said she, 'Miss Galton, you will be so good as to\nstay with Mr. Elkerton--good night to you, Sir!'\n\nHe was no sooner alone with Miss Galton, than he desired her, after a\nspeech (which he endeavoured to season with as much flattery as it would\nbear) to tell him who Emmeline was?\n\n'Upon my word, Sir,' answered she, 'it is more than I know. Her name is\nMowbray; and she is somehow connected with the family of Lord\nMontreville; but _what_ relation,' (sneeringly answered she) 'I really\ncannot pretend even to guess.'\n\n'A relation of Lord Montreville!' cried Elkerton; 'why I knew his\nLordship intimately when I was abroad three or four years ago. He was at\nNaples with his son, his lady, and two daughters; and I was\ndomesticated, absolutely domesticated, among them. But pray what\nrelation to them can this Miss Mowbray be?'\n\n'Probably,' said Miss Galton, 'as you know his Lordship, you may know\nwhat connections and family he has. I suppose she may be his cousin--or\nhis niece--or his----.'\n\nHere she hesitated and smiled; and Elkerton, whose carriage was now at\nthe door, and who had a clue which he thought would procure him all the\ninformation he wanted, took leave of Miss Galton; desiring her to tell\nMrs. Ashwood that he should wait upon her again in a few days.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nDelamere continued in Norfolk only a few weeks after his father and the\nfamily came thither. During that time, he appeared restless and\ndissatisfied; his former vivacity was quite lost; he shunned society;\nand passed almost all his time in the fields, under pretence of hunting\nor shooting, tho' the greatest satisfaction those amusements now\nafforded him was the opportunity they gave him of absenting himself from\nhome. He seldom returned thither 'till six or seven o'clock; dined alone\nin his own apartment; and affected to be too much fatigued to be able to\nmeet the party who assembled to cards in the evening.\n\nLady Mary Otley and her daughter, a widow lady of small fortune in the\nneighbourhood, with Lord and Lady Montreville and their eldest daughter,\nmade up a party without him. Augusta Delamere had been left in their way\nfrom the North, with a relation of his Lordship's who lived near\nScarborough, with whom she was to remain two months.\n\nThe party at Audley-Hall was soon encreased by Sir Richard Crofts and\nhis eldest son, who came every autumn on a visit to Lord Montreville,\nand who was his most intimate friend.\n\nLord Montreville, during the short time he studied at the Temple, became\nacquainted with Sir Richard, then clerk to an attorney in the city; who,\ntho' there was a great difference in their rank, had contrived to gain\nthe regard and esteem of his Lordship (then Mr. Frederic Mowbray) and\nwas, when he came to his estate, entrusted with it's management; a trust\nwhich he appeared to execute with such diligence and integrity, that he\nsoon obtained the entire confidence of his patron; and by possessing\ngreat ductility and great activity, he was soon introduced into a higher\nline of life, and saw himself the companion and friend of those, to\nwhom, at his setting out, he appeared only an humble retainer.\n\nBorn in Scotland, he boasted of his ancestry, tho' his immediate\npredecessors were known to be indigent and obscure; and tho' he had\nneither eminent talents, nor any other education than what he had\nacquired at a free-school in his native town, he had, by dint of a very\ncommon understanding, steadily applied to the pursuit of one point; and\nassisted by the friendship of Lord Montreville, acquired not only a\nconsiderable fortune, but a seat in Parliament and a great deal of\npolitical interest, together with the title of a Baronet.\n\nHe had less understanding than cunning; less honesty than industry; and\ntho' he knew how to talk warmly and plausibly of honour, justice, and\nintegrity, he was generally contented only to talk of them, seldom so\nimprudent as to practice them when he could get place or profit by their\nsacrifice.\n\nHe had that sort of sagacity which enabled him to enter into the\ncharacters of those with whom he conversed: he knew how to humour their\nprejudices, and lay in wait for their foibles to turn them to his own\nadvantage.\n\nTo his superiors, the cringing parasite; to those whom he thought his\ninferiors, proud, supercilious, and insulting; and his heart hardening\nas his prosperity encreased, he threw off, as much as he could, every\nconnection that reminded him of the transactions of his early life, and\naffected to live only among the great, whose luxuries he could now\nreach, and whose manners he tried to imitate.\n\nHe had two sons by an early marriage with a woman of small fortune, who\nwas fortunately dead; for had she lived, she would probably have been\nconcealed, lest she should disgrace him.\n\nTo his sons, however, he had given that sort of education which was\nlikely to fit them for places under government; and he had long secretly\nintended the eldest for one of the Miss Delameres.\n\nDelamere, all warmth and openness himself, detested the narrow-minded\nand selfish father; and had shewn so much coolness towards the sons,\nthat Sir Richard foresaw he would be a great impediment to his designs,\nand had therefore the strongest motive for trying to persuade Lord\nMontreville, that to send him on another tour to the Continent, would be\nthe best means of curing him of what this deep politician termed 'a\nridiculous and boyish whim, which his Lordship ought at all events to\nput an end to before it grew of a more dangerous consequence.'\n\nMr. Crofts, as he was no sportsman, passed his mornings in riding out\nwith Miss Delamere and Miss Otley, or attending on the elder ladies in\ntheir airings: while Delamere, who wished equally to shun Miss Otley,\nwhom he determined never to marry, and Crofts, whom he despised and\nhated, lived almost alone, notwithstanding the entreaties of his father\nand the anger of his mother.\n\nHer Ladyship, who had never any command over her passions, harrassed\nhim, whenever they met, with sarcasms and reflections. Lady Mary,\nscorning _to_ talk to a young man who was blind to the merits of her\ndaughter, talked _at_ him whenever she found an opportunity; and\nexclaimed against the disobedience, dissipation, and ill-breeding of\nmodern young men: while Miss Otley affected a pretty disdain; and\nflirted violently with Mr. Crofts, as if to shew him that she was\ntotally indifferent to his neglect.\n\nThe temper of Delamere was eager and irritable; and he bore the\nunpleasantness of this society, whenever he was forced to mix in it,\nwith a sort of impatient contempt. But as he hourly found it more\nirksome, and the idea of Emmeline press every day more intensely on his\nheart, he determined, at the end of the third week, to go to London.\n\nNot chusing to have any altercation with either Lord or Lady\nMontreville, he one evening ordered his man to have his horses ready at\nfive o'clock the next day, saying he was to meet the foxhounds at some\ndistance from home; and having written a letter to his Lordship, in\nwhich he told him he was going to London for a fortnight, (which letter\nhe left on the table in his dressing-room) he mounted his horse, and was\nsoon in town; but instead of going to the house of his father in\nBerkley-square, he took lodgings in Pall-Mall.\n\nEvery night he frequented those public places which were yet open, in\nhopes of finding Emmeline; and his servant was constantly employed for\nthe same purpose; but as he had no trace of her, all his enquiries were\nfruitless.\n\nOn the night that Emmeline was at the play, he had been at Covent-garden\nTheatre, and meant to have looked into the other house; but was detained\nby meeting a young foreigner from whom he had received civilities at\nTurin, 'till the house was empty. So narrowly did he miss finding her he\nso anxiously sought.\n\nElkerton, in looking about for the happy woman who was worthy the\nexalted situation of being his wife, had yet seen none whom he thought\nso likely to succeed to that honour as Miss Mowbray; and if she was, on\nenquiry, found to be as she was represented, (related to Lord\nMontreville) it would be so great an additional advantage, that he\ndetermined in that case to lay himself and his pied horses, his house in\nKent, his library, and his fortune, all at her feet immediately. Nor did\nhe once suffer himself to suspect that there was a woman on earth who\ncould withstand such a torrent of good fortune.\n\nIn pursuance therefore of this resolution, he determined to make enquiry\nof Lord Montreville himself; of whom he had just known so much at Naples\nas to receive cards of invitation to Lady Montreville's\n_conversationes_.\n\nThere, he mingled with the croud; and was slightly noticed as an\nEnglishman of fortune; smiled at for his affectation of company and\nmanners, which seemed foreign to his original line of life; and then\nforgotten.\n\nBut Elkerton conceived this to be more than introduction enough; and\ndressing himself in what he thought _un disabille la plus imposante_,\nand with his servants in their morning liveries, he stopped at the door\nof Lord Montreville.\n\n'Lord Montreville was not at home.'\n\n'When was he expected?'\n\n'It was uncertain: his Lordship was at Audley-hall, and might be in town\nin a fortnight; or might not come up till the meeting of Parliament.'\n\n'And are all the family there?' enquired Elkerton of the porter.\n\n'No, Sir; Mr. Delamere is in town.'\n\n'And when can I see Mr. Delamere?'\n\nThe porter could not tell, as he did not live in Berkley-square.\n\n'Where, then, is he?'\n\n'At lodgings in Pall-Mall:' (for Delamere had left his direction with\nhis father's servants.)\n\nElkerton therefore took the address with a pencil; and determined,\nwithout farther reflection, to drive thither.\n\nIt was about four o'clock, and in the middle of November, when Delamere\nhad just returned to his lodgings, to dress before he met his foreign\nfriend, and some other young men, to dine at a tavern in St.\nJames's-street, when a loud rap at the door announced a visitor.\n\nMillefleur having no orders to the contrary, and being dazzled with the\nsplendour of Elkerton's equipage, let him in; and he was humming an\nItalian air out of tune, in Delamere's drawing-room, when the latter\ncame out in his dressing-gown and slippers to receive him.\n\nDelamere, on seeing the very odd figure and baboonish face of Elkerton,\ninstead of that of somebody he knew, stopped short and made a grave bow.\n\nElkerton advancing towards him, bowed also profoundly, and said, 'I am\ncharmed, Sir, with being permitted the honour of paying you my devoirs.'\n\nDelamere concluded from his look and bow, as well as from a foreign\naccent, (which Elkerton had affected 'till it was become habitual) that\nthe man was either a dancing master or a quack doctor, sent to him by\nsome of his companions, who frequently exercised on each other such\nefforts of practical wit. He therefore being not without humour, bowed\nagain more profoundly than before; and answered, 'that the honour was\nentirely his, tho' he did not know how he had deserved it.'\n\n'I was so fortunate, Sir,' resumed Elkerton, 'so fortunate as to--have\nthe honour--the happiness--of knowing Lord Montreville and Lady\nMontreville a few years ago at Naples.'\n\nDelamere, still confirmed in his first idea, answered, 'very probably,\nSir.'\n\n'And, Sir,' continued Elkerton, 'I now waited upon _you_, as his\nLordship is not in town.'\n\n'Indeed, Sir, you are too obliging.'\n\n'To ask, Sir, a question, which I hope will not be deemed--be\ndeemed--' (a word did not immediately occur) 'be\ndeemed--improper--intrusive--impertinent--inquisitive--presuming----'\n\n'I dare say, Sir, nothing improper, intrusive, impertinent, inquisitive,\nor presuming, is to be apprehended from a gentleman of your appearance.'\n\nDelamere expected something very ridiculous to follow this ridiculous\nintroduction, and with some difficulty forbore laughing.\n\nElkerton went on----\n\n'It relates, Sir, to a Lady.'\n\n'Pray, Sir, proceed. I am really impatient where a lady is concerned.'\n\n'You are acquainted, Sir, with a lady of the name of Ashwood, who lives\nat Clapham?'\n\n'No, really Sir, I am not so happy.'\n\n'I fancy then, Sir, I have been misinformed, and beg pardon for the\ntrouble I have presumed to give: but I understood that the young lady\nwho lives with her was a relation of Lord Montreville.'\n\nA ray of fire seemed to flash across the imagination of Delamere, and to\ninflame all his hopes. He blushed deeply, and his voice faultering with\nanxiety, he cried--\n\n'What?--who, Sir?--a young lady?--what young lady?'\n\n'Miss Mowbray, they tell me, is her name; and I understand, Sir--but I\ndare say from mistake--that she is of your family.'\n\nDelamere could hardly breathe. He seemed as if he was in a dream, and\ndared not speak for fear of awaking.\n\nElkerton, led on by the questions Delamere at length summoned resolution\nto ask, proceeded to inform him of all he knew; how, where, and how\noften, he had seen Emmeline, and of his intentions to offer himself a\ncandidate for her favour--'for notwithstanding, Sir,' said he, 'that Mr.\nRochely seems to be _fort avant en ses bon graces_, I think--I hope--I\nbelieve, that his fortune--(and yet his fortune does not perhaps so much\nexceed mine as many suppose)--his fortune will hardly turn the balance\nagainst _me_; especially if I have the sanction of Lord Montreville; to\nwhom I suppose (as you seem to acknowledge some affinity between Miss\nMowbray and his Lordship) it will be no harm if I apply.'\n\nThro' the mind of Delamere, a thousand confused ideas rapidly passed. He\nwas divided between his joy at having found Emmeline, his vexation at\nknowing she was surrounded by rivals, and his fear that his father\nmight, by the application of Elkerton to him, know that Emmeline's abode\nwas no longer a secret: and amidst these various sensations, he was able\nonly to express his dislike of Elkerton, whose presumption in thinking\nof Emmeline appeared to cancel the casual obligation he owed to him for\ndiscovering her.\n\n'Sir,' said he haughtily, as soon as he could a little recover his\nrecollection, 'I am very well assured that Lord Montreville will not\nhear any proposals for Miss Mowbray. His Lordship has, in fact, no\nauthority over her; and besides he is at present about to leave his\nhouse in Norfolk, and I know not when he will be in town; perhaps not\nthe whole winter; he is now going to visit some friends, and it will be\nimpossible you can have any access to him for some months. As to myself,\nyou will excuse me; I am engaged to dine out.'\n\nHe rang the bell, and ordered the servant who entered to enquire for the\ngentleman's carriage. Then bowing coolly to him, he went into his\ndressing room, and left the mortified Elkerton to regret the little\nsuccess of an attempt which he doubted not would have excited, in the\nhearts of all those related to Miss Mowbray, admiration at his\ngenerosity, and joy for the good fortune of Emmeline: for he concluded,\nby her being a companion to Mrs. Ashwood, that she had no fortune, or\nany dependance but on the bounty of Lord Montreville.\n\nDelamere, whose ardent inclinations, whatever turn they took, were never\nto be a moment restrained, rang for his servants; and dispatching one of\nthem with an excuse to his friends, he sent a second for an\nhackney-coach. Then ordering up a cold dinner, which he hardly staid to\neat, he got into the coach, and directed it to be driven as fast as\npossible to Clapham Common; where he asked for the house of Mrs.\nAshwood, and was presently at the door.\n\nThe servant had that moment opened the iron gate, to let out a person\nwho had been to his mistress upon business. Delamere therefore enquiring\nif Miss Mowbray was at home, entered without ringing, and telling the\nservant that he had occasion to speak to Miss Mowbray only, the man\nanswered, 'that she was alone in the dressing room.' Thither therefore\nhe desired to be shewn; and without being announced, he entered the\nroom.\n\nInstead of finding her alone, he saw her sit at work by a little table,\non which were two wax candles; and by her side, with his arm, as usual,\nover the back of her chair, and gazing earnestly on her face, sat Mr.\nRochely.\n\nEmmeline did not look up when he came in, supposing it was the servant\nwith tea. Delamere therefore was close to the table when she saw him.\nThe work dropped from her hands; she grew pale, and trembled; but not\nbeing able to rise, she only clasped her hands together, and said\nfaintly, 'Oh! heaven!--Mr. Delamere!'\n\n'Yes, Emmeline, it is Mr. Delamere! and what is there so extraordinary\nin that? I was told you were alone: may I beg the favour of a few\nminutes conversation?'\n\nEmmeline knew not what to reply. She saw him dart an angry and\ndisdainful look at poor Rochely; who, alarmed by the entrance of a\nstranger that appeared on such a footing of familiarity, and who\npossessed the advantages of youth and a handsome person, had retreated\nslowly towards the fire, and now surveyed Delamere with scrutinizing and\ndispleased looks; while Delamere said to Emmeline--'if you have no\nparticular business with this gentleman, will you go into some other\nroom, that I may speak to you on an affair of consequence?'\n\n'Sit down' said Emmeline, recovering her surprize; 'sit down, and I will\nattend you presently. Tell me, how is your sister Augusta?'\n\n'I know not. She is in Yorkshire.'\n\n'And Lord Montreville?'\n\n'Well, I believe. But what is all this to the purpose? can I not speak\nto you, but in the presence of a third person?'\n\nUnequivocal as this hint was, Rochely seemed determined not to go, and\nDelamere as resolutely bent to affront him, if he did not.\n\nEmmeline therefore, who knew not what else to do, was going to comply\nwith his request of a private audience, when she was luckily relieved by\nthe entrance of Mrs. Ashwood and the tea table.\n\nMrs. Ashwood, surprized at seeing a stranger, and a stranger whose\nappearance had more fashion than the generality of her visitors, was\nintroduced to Mr. Delamere; a ceremony he would willingly have dispensed\nwith; and having made his bow, and muttered something about having taken\nthe liberty to call on his relation, he sat down by Emmeline, and in a\nwhisper told her he must and would speak to her alone before he went.\n\nEmmeline, to whose care the tea table was allotted when Miss Galton\nhappened not to be at Mrs. Ashwood's, now excused herself under pretence\nof being obliged to make tea; and while it was passing, Mrs. Ashwood\nmade two or three attempts to introduce general conversation; but it\nwent no farther than a few insignificant sentences between her and Mr.\nRochely.\n\nDelamere, wholly engrossed by the tumultuous delight of having recovered\nEmmeline, and by contriving how to speak to her alone, thought nothing\nelse worthy his attention; and sat looking at her with eyes so\nexpressive of his love, that Rochely, who anxiously watched him, was\nconvinced his solicitude was infinitely stronger than his relationship\nonly would have produced.\n\nHe had at length learned, by constant attention to every hint and every\ncircumstance that related to Emmeline, who she was; and had even got\nfrom Mrs. Ashwood a confused idea of Delamere's attachment to her, which\nthe present scene at once elucidated.\n\nRochely saw in him not only a rival, but a rival so dangerous that all\nhis hopes seemed to vanish at once. Unconscious, 'till then, how very\nindiscreetly he was in love, he was amazed at the pain he felt from this\ndiscovery; and with a most rueful countenance, sat silent and\ndisconcerted.\n\nMrs. Ashwood, used to be flattered and attended to, was in no good\nhumour with Mr. Delamere, who gave her so little of his notice: and\nnever perhaps were a party more uncomfortable, 'till they were enlivened\nby the entrance of Miss Galton and Mr. Hanbury, with another gentleman.\n\nThey were hardly placed, and had their tea sent round, before a loud\nring was heard, and the servant announced 'Mr. Elkerton.'\n\nMr. Elkerton came dancing into the room; and having spoken to Mrs.\nAshwood and Emmeline, he slightly surveyed the company, and sat down.\n\nHe was very near sighted, and affected to be still more so; and Delamere\nhaving drawn his chair out of the circle, sat almost behind Emmeline;\nwhile the portly citizen who had accompanied Mr. Hanbury sat forward,\nnear the table; Delamere was therefore hardly seen.\n\nElkerton began to tell them how immoderately he was fatigued. 'I have\nbeen over the whole town,' said he, 'to-day. In the morning I was\nobliged to attend a boring appointment upon business relative to my\nestate in Kent; and to meet my tenants, who disagreed with my steward;\nand then, I went to call upon my old friend Delamere, Lord Montreville's\nson, in Pall-Mall; we passed a very chearful hour discoursing of former\noccurrences when we were together at Turin. Upon my word, he is a good\nsensible young man. We have renewed our intimacy; and he has insisted\nupon my going down with him to his father's house in Norfolk.'\n\nEmmeline suspended her tea making, and looked astonished.\n\nMrs. Ashwood seemed surprized.\n\nBut Delamere, who had at first felt inclined to be angry at the folly\nand forwardness of Elkerton, was now so struck with the ridicule of the\ncircumstance, that he broke into a loud laugh.\n\nThe eyes of the company were turned towards _him_, and Elkerton with\ngreat indignation took his glass to survey who it was that had thus\nviolated the rules of good breeding; but great was his dismay and\nastonishment, when he beheld the very Delamere, of whom he had spoken\nwith so much assurance, rise up, and advancing towards him, make a grave\nbow.--\n\n'Sir,' said Delamere, very solemnly, 'I cannot sufficiently express my\ngratitude for your good opinion of me; nor my happiness to hear you\nintend to honour me with a visit at Audley Hall. Upon my word you are\n_too_ obliging, and I know not how I shall shew my gratitude!'\n\nThe ironical tone in which this was delivered, and the discomposed looks\nof the distressed Elkerton, explained the matter to the whole company;\nand the laugh became general.\n\nElkerton, tho' not easily disconcerted, could not stand it. After a sort\nof apology to Delamere, he endeavoured to reassume his consequence. But\nhe had been too severely mortified; and in a few minutes arose, and\nunder pretence of being engaged to a rout in town, went away, nobody\nattempting to stop him.\n\nRochely, who hated Elkerton, could not forbear to triumph in this\ndiscomfiture. He spoke very severely of him as a forward, impertinent,\nsilly fellow, who was dissipating his fortune.\n\nThe old citizen heartily joined in exclaiming against such apostates\nfrom the frugality of their ancestors. 'Sir,' said he to Rochely, 'we\nall know that _you_ are a prudent man; and that cash at your house is,\nas it were, in the Bank. Sir, you do honour to the city; but as to that\nthere Mr. Elkerton, one must be cautious; but for _my_ part, I wonder\nhow some people go on. To my certain knowledge his father didn't die so\nrich as was supposed--no--not by a many thousands. Sir, I remember\nhim--(and I am not ashamed to say it, for every body knows _I_ have got\nmy money honestly, and that it's all of my own getting)--but, Sir, I\nremember that man's father, and not a many years ago neither, carrying\nout parcels, and sweeping the shop for old Jonathan Huggins. You knew\nold Jonathan Huggins: he did not die, I think, 'till about the year\nforty-one or two. You remember him, to be sure?'\n\nRochely, ever tremblingly alive when his age was called in question, yet\nfearing to deny a fact which he apprehended the other would enter into a\nconvincing detail to prove, answered that 'he slightly remembered him\nwhen he was quite a boy.'\n\nBut his evasion availed him nothing. The old citizen, Mr. Rugby, was now\ngot upon his own ground; and most inhumanly for the feelings of poor\nRochely, began to relate in whose mayoralty old Jonathan Huggins was\nsheriff, and when he was mayor; who he married; who married his\ndaughters; and how he acquired an immense fortune, all by frugality at\nsetting out; and how one of his daughters, who had married a Lord\nagainst the old man's will, had spent more in _one_ night than his\nfather did in a twelvemonth.\n\nDelamere, who sat execrating both Jonathan Huggins and his historian, at\nlength lost all patience; and said to Emmeline, in an half whisper, 'I\ncan bear this no longer: leave these tedious old fools, and let me speak\nto you for two minutes only.'\n\nEmmeline knew not how to refuse, without hazarding some extravagance on\nthe part of Delamere. But as she did not like the appearance of leaving\nthe room abruptly, she desired Mrs. Ashwood would give her permission to\norder candles in the parlour, as Mr. Delamere wished to speak with her\nalone.\n\nAs soon as the servant informed her they were ready, she went down: and\nDelamere followed her, having first wished Mrs. Ashwood a good night;\nwho was too much displeased with the little attention he had shewn her,\nto ask him to supper, tho' she was very desirous of having a man of his\nfashion in the list of her acquaintance.\n\nDelamere and Emmeline were no sooner alone, than he began to renew, with\nevery argument he thought likely to move her, his entreaties for a\nprivate marriage. He swore that he neither could or would live without\nher, and that her refusal would drive him to some act of desperation.\n\nEmmeline feared her resolution would give way; for the comparison\nbetween the people she had lately been among, and Delamere, was\ninfinitely favourable to him. Such unabated love, in a man who might\nchuse among the fairest and most fortunate of women, was very seducing;\nand the advantages of being his wife, instead of continuing in the\nprecarious situation she was now in, would have determined at once a\nmind more attentive to pecuniary or selfish motives.\n\nBut Emmeline, unshaken by such considerations, was liable to err only\nfrom the softness of her heart.\n\nDelamere unhappy--Delamere wearing out in hopeless solicitude the bloom\nof life, was the object she found it most difficult to contend with: and\nfeeble would have been her defence, had she not considered herself as\nengaged in honour to Lord Montreville to refuse his son, and still more\nengaged to respect the peace of the family of her dear Augusta.\n\nStrengthened by these reflections, she refused, tho' in the gentlest\nmanner, to listen to such proposals; reproached him, tho' with more\ntenderness in her voice and manner than she had yet shewn, for having\nleft Audley Hall without the concurrence of Lord Montreville; and\nentreated him to return, and try to forget her.\n\n'Let me perish if I do!' eagerly answered Delamere. 'No, Emmeline; if\nyou determine to push me to extremities, to you only will be the misery\nimputable, when my mistaken parents, in vain repentance, hang over the\ntomb of their only son, and see the last of his family in an early\ngrave. It is in your power only to save me--You refuse--farewel, then--I\nwish no future regret may embitter your life, and that you may find\nconsolation in being the wife of some one of those persons who are, I\nsee, offering you all that riches can bestow. Farewel, lovely, inhuman\ngirl! be happy if you can--after having sacrificed to a mistaken point\nof honour, the repose and the life of him who lived only to adore you.'\n\nSo saying, he suddenly opened the door, and was leaving the room. But\nEmmeline, who shuddered at the picture he had drawn of his despair, and\nsaw such traces of its reality on his countenance, caught his arm.\n\n'Stay! Mr. Delamere,' cried she, 'stay yet a moment!'\n\n'For what purpose?' answered he, 'since you refuse to hear me?'\n\nHe turned back, however, into the room; and Emmeline, who fancied she\nsaw him the victim of his unfortunate love, could no longer command her\ntears.\n\nDelamere threw himself at her feet, and embraced her knees.\n\n'Oh Emmeline!' cried he, weeping also, 'hear me for the last time.\nEither consent to be mine, or let me take an eternal adieu!'\n\n'What would you have me do? good God! what is it you expect of me?'\n\n'To go with me to Scotland to-morrow--to night--directly!'\n\n'Oh, no! no!--Does not Lord Montreville depend upon my honour?--can I\nbetray a trust reposed in me?'\n\n'Chimeras all; founded in tyranny on his part, and weakness on yours.\n_He_ had no right to exact such a promise; _you_ had no right to give\nit. But however, send to him again to say I have seen you--summons him\nhither to divide us--you may certainly do so if you please; but Lord\nMontreville will no longer have a son; at least England, nor Europe,\nwill contain him no longer--I will go where my father shall hear no more\nof me.'\n\n'Will it content you if I promise you _not_ to write to Lord\nMontreville, nor to cause him to be written to; and to see you again?'\n\n'When?'\n\n'To-morrow--whenever you please.'\n\nDelamere, catching at this faint ray of hope, promised, if she would\nallow him to come thither when he would, he would endeavour to be calm.\nHe made her solemnly protest that she would neither write to Lord\nMontreville, or procure another to do it; and that she would not leave\nMrs. Ashwood without letting him know when and whither she went; and if\nby any accident his father heard of his having found her, that she would\nenter into no new engagements to conceal herself from him.\n\nHaving procured from her these assurances, which he knew she would not\nviolate, and having obtained her consent to see him early the next\nmorning, he at her request agreed to take his leave; which he did with\nless pain than he had ever before felt at quitting her; carrying with\nhim the delightful hope that he had made an impression on her heart, and\nsecure of seeing her the next day, he went home comparatively happy.\n\nEmmeline, who had wept excessively, was very unfit to return to the\ncompany; but she thought her not appearing again among them would be yet\nmore singular. She therefore composed herself as well as she could; and\nafter staying a few minutes to recollect her scattered spirits, she\nentered the room where they were at cards.\n\nRochely, who was playing at whist with Mrs. Ashwood, Mr. Rugby, and Mr.\nHanbury, looked anxiously at her eyes; and presently losing all\nattention to what he was about, and forgetting his game, he played so\nextremely ill, that he lost the rubber.\n\nThe old cit, who had three half crowns depending, and who was a\ndetermined grumbler at cards, fell upon him without mercy; and said so\nmany rude things, that Rochely could not help retorting; and it was with\nsome difficulty Mrs. Ashwood prevented the grossest abuse being lavished\nfrom the enraged Rugby on the enamoured banker; who desiring to give his\ncards to Miss Galton, got up and ordered his carriage.\n\nEmmeline sat near the fire, with her handkerchief in her hand, which was\nyet wet with tears.\n\nRochely, with a privilege he had been used to, and which Emmeline, from\na man old enough to be her father, thought very inconsequential, took\nher hand and the handkerchief it held.\n\n'So, Miss Mowbray,' said he, 'Mr. Delamere is your near relation?'\n\n'Yes, Sir.'\n\n'And he has brought you, I fear, some ill news of your family?'\n\n'No, Sir,' sighed Emmeline.\n\n'No death, I hope?'\n\n'No, Sir.'\n\n'Whence then, these tears?'\n\nEmmeline drew her hand away.\n\n'What a strange young man this is, to make you cry. What has he been\nsaying to you?'\n\n'Nothing, Sir.'\n\n'Ah! Miss Mowbray; such a lad as that is but an indifferent guardian;\npray where does his father live?'\n\nMiss Mowbray, not aware of the purpose of this enquiry, and glad of any\nthing that looked like common conversation, answered 'at Audley Hall, in\nNorfolk; and in Berkley-Square.'\n\nSome other questions, which seemed of no consequence, Rochely asked, and\nEmmeline answered; 'till hearing his carriage was at the door, he went\naway.\n\n'_I_ don't like your Mr. Delamere at all, Miss Mowbray,' said Mrs.\nAshwood, as soon as the game ended. 'I never saw a prouder, more\ndisagreeable young man in my life.'\n\nEmmeline smiled faintly, and said she was sorry he did not please her.\n\n'No, nor me neither,' said Miss Galton. 'Such haughtiness indeed!--yet I\nwas glad he mortified that puppy Elkerton.'\n\nEmmeline, who found the two friends disposed to indulge their good\nnature at the expence of the company of the evening, complained of being\nfatigued, and asked for a glass of wine and water: which having drank,\nshe retired to bed, leaving the lady of the house, who had invited Mr.\nHanbury and his friend to supper, to enjoy more stories of Jonathan\nHuggins, and the pretty satyrical efforts of Miss Galton, who made her\ncourt most effectually by ridiculing and villifying all their\nacquaintance whenever it was in her power.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nWhen Rochely got home, he set about examining the state of his heart\nexactly as he would have examined the check book of one of his\ncustomers.\n\nHe found himself most miserably in love. But avarice said, Miss Mowbray\nhad no fortune.\n\nBy what had passed in his bosom that evening, he had discovered that he\nshould be wretched to see her married to another.\n\nBut avarice enquired how he could offer to marry a woman without a\nshilling?\n\nLove, represented that her modest, reserved, and unambitious turn, would\nperhaps make her, in the end, a more profitable match than a woman\neducated in expence, who might dissipate more than she brought.\n\nAvarice asked whether he could depend on modesty, reserve, and a retired\nturn, in a girl not yet eighteen?\n\nAfter a long discussion, Love very unexpectedly put to flight the agent\nof Plutus, who had, with very little interruption, reigned despoticly\nover all his thoughts and actions for many years; and Rochely determined\nto write to Lord Montreville, to lay his circumstances before him, and\nmake a formal proposal to marry Miss Mowbray.\n\nIn pursuance of this resolution, he composed, with great pains, (for he\nwas remarkably slow in whatever he undertook) the following epistle.--\n\n\n  'My Lord,\n\n    'This serves to inform your Lordship, that I have seen Miss\n  Mowbray, and like her well enough to be willing to marry her, if\n  you, my Lord, have not any other views for her; and as to fortune, I\n  will just give your Lordship a memorandum of mine.\n\n    'I have sixty thousand pounds in the stocks; viz. eighteen in the\n  three per cent. consols. twenty in Bank stock: ten in East India\n  stock; and twelve in South Sea annuities.\n\n    'I have about forty thousand on different mortgages; all good, as\n  I will be ready at any time to shew you. I have houses worth about\n  five more. And after the death of my mother, who is near eighty, I\n  shall have an estate in Middlesex worth ten more. The income of my\n  business is near three thousand pounds a year; and my whole income\n  near ten thousand.\n\n    'My character, my Lord, is well known: and you will find, if we\n  agree, that I shall not limit Miss Mowbray's settlement to the\n  proportion of what your Lordship may please to give her, (for I\n  suppose you will give her something) but to what she ought to have\n  as my widow, if it should so happen that she survives me.\n\n    'I have reason to believe Miss Mowbray has no dislike to this\n  proposal; and hope to hear from your Lordship thereon by return of\n  post.\n\n                                                   I am, my Lord,\n                               your Lordship's very humble servant,\n                                                   HUMPHREY ROCHELY.'\n\n  _Lombard-street,\n  Nov. 20th. 17--._\n\n\nThis was going to the point at once. The letter arrived in due time at\nAudley-Hall; and was received by Lord Montreville with surprise and\nsatisfaction. The hint of Miss Mowbray's approbation made him hope she\nwas yet concealed from Delamere; and as he determined to give the\nearliest and strongest encouragement to this overture, from a man worth\nabove an hundred thousand pounds, he called a council with Sir Richard\nCrofts, who knew Rochely, and who kept cash with him; and it was\ndetermined that Lord Montreville should go to town, not only to close at\nonce with the opulent banker, but to get Delamere out of the way while\nthe marriage was in agitation, which it would otherwise be impossible to\nconceal from him. To persuade him to another continental tour was what\nSir Richard advised: and agreed to go to town with his Lordship, in\norder to assist in this arduous undertaking.\n\nLord Montreville, however, failed not immediately to answer the letter\nhe had received from Mr. Rochely, in these terms--\n\n\n  'Sir,\n\n    'This day's post brought me the honour of your letter.\n\n    'If Miss Mowbray is as sensible as she ought to be, of so\n  flattering a distinction, be assured it will be one of the most\n  satisfactory events of my life to see her form a connection with a\n  gentleman truly worthy and respectable.\n\n    'To hasten the completion of an event so desirable, I fully intend\n  being in town in a very few days; when I will, with your permission,\n  wait on you in Lombard-street.\n\n    'I have the honour to be, with great esteem,\n\n                                              Sir,\n                                                 your most devoted,\n                                           and most obedient servant,\n                                                          MONTREVILLE.'\n\n  _Audley-Hall, Nov. 23._\n\n\nThe haughty Peer, who derived his blood from the most antient of the\nBritish Nobility, thus condescended to flatter opulence and to court the\nalliance of riches. Nor did he think any advances he could make, beneath\nhim, when he hoped at once to marry his niece to advantage, and what was\nyet more material, put an invincible bar between her and his son.\n\nWhile this correspondence, so inimical to Delamere's hopes, was passing\nbetween his father and Mr. Rochely, he was every hour with Emmeline;\nintoxicated with his passion, indulging the most delightful hopes, and\nforgetting every thing else in the world.\n\nHe had found it his interest to gain (by a little more attention, and\nsome fine speeches about elegance and grace,) the good opinion of Mrs.\nAshwood; who now declared she had been mistaken in her first idea of\nhim, and that he was not only quite a man of fashion, but possessed an\nexcellent understanding and very refined sentiments.\n\nThe sudden death of her father had obliged her to leave home some days\nbefore: but as soon as she was gone, Emmeline, who foresaw that Delamere\nwould be constantly with her, sent for Miss Galton.\n\nNo remonstrance of her's could prevent his passing every day at the\nhouse, from breakfast 'till a late hour in the evening.\n\nOn the last of these days, he was there as usual; and it was past eight\nat night, when Emmeline, who had learned to play on the harp, by being\npresent when Mrs. Ashwood received lessons on that instrument, was\nsinging to Delamere a little simple air of which he was particularly\nfond, and into which she threw so much pathos, that lost in fond\nadmiration, he 'hung over her, enamoured,' when she was interrupted by\nthe entrance of a servant, who said that a Lord, but he forgot the name,\nwas below, and desired to speak with Miss Mowbray.\n\nIf Emmeline was alarmed at the sight of Lord Montreville at Swansea,\nwhen she had acted with the strictest attention to his wishes, she had\nnow much more reason to be so, when she felt herself conscious of having\ngiven encouragement to Delamere, and had reason to fear her motives for\ndoing so would be misbelieved or misunderstood.\n\nTho' the servant had forgotten his name, Emmeline doubted not but it was\nLord Montreville; and she had hardly time to think how she should\nreceive him, before his Lordship (who had impatiently followed the\nservant up stairs) entered the room.\n\nDelamere, immovable behind Emmeline's chair, was the first object that\nstruck him.\n\nHe had hoped that her residence was yet unknown to his son; and\nsurprise, vexation, and anger, were marked in his countenance and\nattitude.\n\n'Miss Mowbray!' (advancing towards her) 'is it thus you fulfil the\npromise you gave me? And you, Mr. Delamere--do you still obstinately\npersist in this ridiculous, this unworthy attachment?'\n\n'I left you, my Lord,' answered Delamere, 'without deceiving you as to\nmy motives for doing so. I came in search of Miss Mowbray. By a\nfortunate accident I found her. I have never dissimulated; nor ever mean\nit in whatever relates to her. Nothing has prevented my making her\nirrevocably mine, but her too scrupulous adherence to a promise _she_\nought never to have given, and which your _Lordship_ ought never to have\nextorted.'\n\nEmmeline, gentle as she was, had yet that proper spirit which conscious\nworth seldom fails of inspiring: and knowing that she had already\nsacrificed much to the respect she thought Lord Montreville entitled to,\nshe was hurt at finding, from his angry and contemptuous tone, as well\nas words, that she was condemned unheard, and treated with harshness\nwhere she deserved only kindness and gratitude.\n\nThe courage of which her first surprise had deprived her, was restored\nby these sensations; and she said, with great coolness, yet with less\ntimidity than usual, 'my Lord, I have yet done nothing in violation of\nthe promise I gave you. But the moment your Lordship doubts my adherence\nto it, from that moment I consider it as dissolved.'\n\nDelamere, encouraged by an answer so flattering to his hopes, now\naddressed himself to his father, who was by this time seated; and spoke\nso forcibly of his invincible attachment, and his determined purpose\nnever to marry any other woman, that the resolution of Lord Montreville\nwas shaken, and would perhaps have given way, if the violent and\nclamorous opposition of his wife on one hand, and the ambitious projects\nand artful advice of Sir Richard Crofts on the other, had not occurred\nto him. He commanded himself so far as not to irritate Delamere farther,\nby reflections on the conduct of Emmeline, which he found would not be\nendured; and trying to stifle his feelings under the dissimulation of\nthe courtier, he heard with patience all he had to urge. He even\nanswered him with temper; made an apology to Emmeline for any\nexpressions that might have given her offence; and at length threw into\nhis manner a composure that elated Delamere to a degree of hope hitherto\nunfelt. He fancied that his father, weary of hopeless opposition, and\nconvinced of the merit of Emmeline, would consent to his marriage: and\nhis quick spirit seizing with avidity on an idea so flattering,\nconverted into a confirmation of it, all Lord Montreville's discourse\nfor the remainder of the visit: in which, by dissimulation on one part,\nand favourable expectations on the other, they both seemed to return to\nsome degree of good humour.\n\nDelamere agreed to go home with his father; and Lord Montreville having\ndetermined to return the next day to speak to Emmeline on the proposals\nof Rochely, they parted; his Lordship meditating as he went home how to\nprevent Delamere's interrupting the conference he wished to have on a\nsubject which was so near his heart.\n\nOn his arrival at his own house, he found Sir Richard Crofts waiting for\nhim, whom he detained to supper. Delamere, as soon as it was over, went\nto his lodgings; which Lord Montreville did not oppose, as he wished to\nbe alone with Sir Richard; but he desired, that after that evening\nDelamere would return to his apartments in Berkley-square; which he\npartly promised to do.\n\nLord Montreville related to Sir Richard what had passed, and the\nuneasiness he was under to find that Delamere, far from relaxing in his\ndetermination, had openly renewed his addresses; and that Emmeline\nseemed much less disposed to sacrifice his wishes to those of his\nfamily, than he had yet found her.\n\nSir Richard, himself wholly insensible to the feelings of a father,\ndiscouraged in Lord Montreville every tendency to forgive or indulge\nthis indiscreet passion. And equally incapable of the generous\nsentiments of a gentleman towards a woman, young, helpless, dependant,\nand unfortunate, he tried to harden the heart of Lord Montreville\nagainst his orphan niece, and advised him peremptorily to insist on her\nmarrying Rochely immediately, or, as the alternative, to declare to her\nthat from the moment of her refusal she must expect from him neither\nsupport or countenance.\n\nThis threat on one hand, and the affluence offered her by Rochely on the\nother, must, he thought, oblige her to embrace his proposals. The\ngreatest difficulty seemed to be, to prevent Delamere's impetuosity from\nsnatching her at once out of the power of his father, by an elopement;\nto which, if she preferred him to Rochely, it was very probable she\nmight be driven by harsh measures to consent; and that Delamere must\nhave in her heart a decided preference, there could be little doubt.\n\nLord Montreville was apprehensive that Delamere, who had, he found, for\nmany days lived entirely at Mrs. Ashwood's, would be there before him in\nthe morning, and preclude all possibility of a private conversation with\nEmmeline.\n\nFitz-Edward, who could, and from the duplicity of his character would\nperhaps have made a diversion in his favour, was not in town; and to\nboth the Mr. Crofts Delamere had an antipathy, which he took very little\npains to conceal; they therefore could not be employed to engage him.\n\nIn this difficulty, Sir Richard offered to go himself to Miss Mowbray,\nthat Lord Montreville might be at liberty to detain his son; pretences\nfor which could not be wanting.\n\nHis Lordship closed with this offer with pleasure; and felt himself\nrelieved from a painful task. His heart, though greatly changed by a\nlong course of good fortune, and by the habit of living among the great,\nwas yet not quite lost to the feelings of nature.\n\nHis brother, than whom he was only a year younger, and whom he had loved\nthro' childhood and youth with singular attachment, was not wholly\nforgotten; and the softened likeness, in the countenance of Emmeline, to\none whom he had so long been used to look up to with tenderness,\nfrequently said as much for her to his affection, as her unprotected and\nhelpless state did to his honour and his compassion. Nor, whatever pains\nhe took to stifle his pity for his son, could he entirely reconcile to\nhis own heart the part he was acting.\n\nBut of these feelings, meritorious as they were, he was ashamed, and\ndared not avow them even to himself; while he was intimidated by the\nsupercilious spirit and unconquerable pride of Lady Montreville, and\ntempted by the visions of encreasing splendour and accumulated riches\nwhich Sir Richard perpetually presented to his imagination, and which\nthere was indeed but little doubt of realizing.\n\nThe Mowbray family were known to possess abilities. Those of the\ndeceased Mr. Mowbray were remarkably great, tho' he had thrown away his\ntime and health in a course of dissipation which had made them useless.\n\nThe talents of Lord Montreville, tho' less brilliant, were more solid.\nAnd now in the meridian of life, with powerful connections and extensive\ninterest, he was courted to accept an eminent post in administration,\nwith a promise of a Marquisate being restored to him, which had long\nlain dormant in his own family, and of the revival of which he was\nextremely ambitious.\n\nTo support such a dignity, his son's future fortune, ample as it must\nbe, would not, he thought, be adequate; and could only be made so by his\nmarrying Miss Otley or some woman of equal fortune.\n\nThis, therefore, was the weight which entirely over-balanced all his\nkindness for his niece, and confirmed his resolution to tear her from\nDelamere at whatever price.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nIt was much earlier than the usual hour for morning visits, when Sir\nRichard Crofts was at the door of Mrs. Ashwood.\n\nMiss Mowbray had given no orders to be denied; and he was, on enquiring\nfor her, shewn into the parlour.\n\nAs soon as the servant informed her a gentleman was below whom she found\nwas not Delamere, she concluded it was Lord Montreville; and with a\nfearful and beating heart, went down.\n\nShe saw, with some surprise, a middle-aged man, of no very pleasant\ncountenance and person, to whom she was an entire stranger; and\nconcluding his business was with Mrs. Ashwood, she was about to retreat,\nwhen the gentleman advancing towards her, told her he waited on her,\ncommissioned by Lord Montreville.\n\nEmmeline sat down in silence, and Sir Richard began.\n\n'Miss Mowbray, I have the honour to be connected with Lord Montreville,\nand entirely in his Lordship's confidence: you will please therefore to\nconsider what I shall say to you as coming immediately, directly, and\nabsolutely, from himself; and as his Lordship's decided, and\nunalterable, and irrevocable intentions.'\n\nThe abruptness of this speech shocked and distressed Emmeline. She grew\nvery pale; but bowing slightly to the speaker, he went on.\n\n'My Lord Montreville hopes and supposes, and is willing to believe, that\nyou have not, in direct violation of your promise solemnly given,\nencouraged Mr. Delamere in the absurd, and impossible, and impracticable\nproject of marrying you. But however that may have been, as it is his\nLordship's firm resolution and determination never to suffer such a\nconnection, you have, I suppose, too much sense not to see the mischief\nyou must occasion, and bring on, and cause to yourself, by encouraging a\ngiddy, and infatuated, and ignorant, and rash young man, to resist\npaternal authority.'\n\nEmmeline was still silent.\n\n'Now here is an opportunity of establishing yourself in affluence, and\nreputation, and fortune, beyond what your most sanguine hopes could\noffer you; and I am persuaded you will eagerly, and readily, and\nimmediately embrace it. Lord Montreville insists upon it; the world\nexpects it; and Mr. Delamere's family demand it of you.'\n\n'Sir!' said Emmeline, astonished at the peremptory tone and strange\npurport of these words.\n\n'It is my custom,' resumed Sir Richard, 'when I am upon business, to\nspeak plainly, and straitly, and to the point. This then is what I have\nto propose--You are acquainted with Mr. Rochely, the great banker?'\n\n'Yes, Sir.'\n\n'He offers to my Lord Montreville to marry you; and to make settlements\non you equal to what you might have claimed, had you a right to be\nconsidered as a daughter of the house of Mowbray. His real fortune is\nvery great; his annual income superior to that of many of the nobility;\nand there _can_ be no reason, indeed none will be allowed, or listened\nto, or heard of, why you should not eagerly, and instantly, and joyfully\naccept a proposal so infinitely superior to what you have any claim, or\nright, or pretence to.'\n\nThis was almost too much for poor Emmeline. Anger and disdain, which she\nfound fast rising in her bosom, restrained her tears: but her eyes\nflashed indignantly on the unfeeling politician who thus so indelicately\naddressed her.\n\nHe would not give her time to speak; but seemed determined to overwhelm\nher imagination at once with the contrast he placed before her.\n\n'If,' continued he, 'you will agree to become the wife of Mr. Rochely,\nas soon as settlements can be prepared, my Lord Montreville, of whose\ngenerosity, and greatness of mind, and liberality, too much cannot be\nsaid, offers to consider you as being really his niece; as being really\na daughter of the Mowbray family; and, that being so considered, you may\nnot be taken by any man portionless, he will, on the day of marriage,\npresent, and settle on, and give you, three thousand pounds.\n\n'Now, Miss Mowbray, consider, and weigh, and reflect on this well: and\ngive me leave, in order that you may form a just judgment, to tell you\nthe consequence of your refusal.\n\n'My Lord Montreville, who is not obliged to give you the least\nassistance, or support, or countenance, does by me declare, that if you\nare so weak (to call it by no harsher name) as to refuse this\nastonishing, and amazing, and singular good fortune, he shall consider\nyou as throwing off all duty, and regard, and attention to him; and as\none, with whose fate it will be no longer worth his while to embarrass,\nperplex, and concern himself. From that moment, therefore, you must drop\nthe name of Mowbray, to which in fact you have no right, and take that\nof your mother, whatever it be; and you must never expect from my Lord\nMontreville, or the Mowbray-Delamere family, either countenance, or\nsupport, or protection.\n\n'Now, Miss Mowbray, your answer. The proposition cannot admit of\ndeliberation, or doubt, or hesitation, and my Lord expects it by me.'\n\nThe presence of mind which a very excellent understanding and a very\ninnocent heart gave to Emmeline, was never more requisite than on this\noccasion. The rude and peremptory manner of the speaker; the dreadful\nalternative of Rochely on one side, and indigence on the other, thus\nsuddenly and unexpectedly brought before her; was altogether so\novercoming, that she could not for a moment collect her spirits enough\nto speak at all. She sighed; but her agitation was too great for tears;\nand at length summoning all her courage, she replied--\n\n'My Lord Montreville, Sir, would have been kinder, had he delivered\nhimself his wishes and commands. Such, however, as I now receive them,\nthey require no deliberation. _I will not_ marry Mr. Rochely, tho'\ninstead of the fortune you describe, he could offer me the world.--Lord\nMontreville _may_ abandon me, but he _shall not_ make me wretched. Tell\nhim therefore, Sir,' (her spirit rose as she spoke) 'that the daughter\nof his brother, unhappy as she is, yet boasts that nobleness of mind\nwhich her father possessed, and disclaims the mercenary views of\nbecoming, from pecuniary motives, the wife of a man whom she cannot\neither love or esteem. Tell him too, that if she had not inherited a\nstrong sense of honour, of which at least her birth does not deprive\nher, she might now have been the wife of Mr. Delamere, and independant\nof his Lordship's authority; and it is improbable, that one who has\nsacrificed so much to integrity, should now be compelled by threats of\nindigence to the basest of all actions, that of selling her person and\nher happiness for a subsistence. I beg that _you, Sir_, who seem to have\ndelivered Lord Montreville's message, with such scrupulous exactness,\nwill take the trouble to be as precise in my answer; and that his\nLordship will consider it as final.'\n\nHaving said this, with a firmness of voice and manner which resentment,\nas well as a noble pride, supplied; she arose, curtseyed composedly to\nSir Richard, and went out of the room; leaving the unsuccessful\nambassador astonished at that strength of mind, and dignity of manner,\nwhich he did not expect in so young a woman, and somewhat mortified,\nthat his masculine eloquence, on which he was accustomed to pride\nhimself, and which he thought generally unanswerable, had so entirely\nfallen short of the effect he expected.\n\nUnwilling however to return to Lord Montreville without hopes of\nsuccess, he thought he might obtain at least some information from Mrs.\nAshwood of the likeliest means to move her untractable and high spirited\nfriend. He therefore rang the bell, and desired to speak with that lady.\nBut as she was not yet returned from the house of her father, where a\nfamily meeting was held to inspect his will, Sir Richard failed of\nattempting to secure her agency; and was obliged, however reluctantly,\nto depart.\n\nEmmeline, whose command of herself was exerted with too much violence\nnot to shake her whole frame with it's effects, no sooner reached her\nown chamber than she found all her courage gone, and a violent passion\nof tears succeeded.\n\nHer deep convulsive sighs reached the ears of Miss Galton; who entered\nthe room, and began, in the common mode of consolation, first to enquire\nwhy she wept?\n\nEmmeline answered only by weeping the more.\n\nMiss Galton enquired if that gentleman was Lord Montreville.\n\nEmmeline was unable to reply; and Miss Galton finding no gratification\nto her curiosity, which, mingled with envious malignity, had long been\nher ruling passion, was obliged to quit the unhappy Emmeline; which was\nindeed the only favour she could do her.\n\nThe whole morning had passed before Miss Mowbray was able to come down\nstairs, and when she did, her languor and dejection were excessive. Miss\nGalton only dined with her; if it might be called dining, for she eat\nnothing; but just as the cloth was removed, a coach stopped, and Mrs.\nAshwood appeared, led by her brother, Mr. Stafford.\n\nEmmeline, who had not very lately heard from her beloved friend, now\neagerly enquired after her, and learned that the illness of one of her\nchildren had, together with her being far advanced in her pregnancy,\nprevented her coming to London with Mr. Stafford; who, tho' summoned\nthither immediately on his father's death, had only arrived the evening\nbefore; the messenger that went having missed him at his own house, and\nhaving been obliged to follow him into another county.\n\nHe delivered to Miss Mowbray a letter from Mrs. Stafford, with which\nEmmeline, eager to read it, retired--\n\n\n    'Trust me, Emmeline, no abatement in my tender regard, has\n  occasioned my omitting to write to you: but anxiety of mind so\n  great, as to deprive me of all power to attend to any thing but\n  it's immediate object.--Your poor little friend Harry, who looked\n  so much recovered, and so full of health and spirits, when you left\n  him at Swansea, was three weeks ago seized again with one of those\n  fevers to which he has so repeatedly been liable, and for many days\n  his life appeared to be in the most immediate danger. You know how\n  far we are from a physician; and you know my anxiety for this first\n  darling of my heart; judge then, my Emmeline, of the miserable\n  hours I have known, between hope and fear, and the sleepless nights\n  I have passed at the bed side of my suffering cherub; and in my\n  present state I doubly feel all this anxiety and fatigue, and am\n  very much otherwise than well. Of myself, however, I think not,\n  since Harry is out of danger, and Dr. Farnaby thinks will soon be\n  entirely restored; but he is still so very weak, that I never quit\n  him even a moment. The rest of my children are well; and all who\n  are capable of recollection, remember and love you.\n\n    'And now, my dear Miss Mowbray, as the visitors who have been with\n  me ever since my return from Swansea, are happily departed and no\n  others expected, and as Mr. Stafford will be engaged in town almost\n  all the winter, in consequence of his father's death, will you not\n  come to me? _You_ only can alleviate and share a thousand anxieties\n  that prey on my spirits; _you_ only can sweeten the hour of my\n  confinement, which will happen in January; and before _you_ only I\n  can sigh at liberty and be forgiven.\n\n    'Ah! Emmeline--the death of Mr. Stafford's father, far from\n  producing satisfaction as increasing our fortune, brings to me only\n  regret and sorrow. He loved me with great affection; and I owe him a\n  thousand obligations. The family will have reason to regret his\n  loss; tho' the infirmities of the latter part of his life were not\n  much alleviated by their attendance or attention.\n\n    'Come to me, Emmeline, if possible; come, if you can, with Mr.\n    Stafford; or if he is detained long in town, come without him. I\n  will send my post-chaise to meet you at Basingstoke. Lord\n  Montreville cannot object to it; and Delamere, whom you have never\n  mentioned, has, I conclude, given way to the peremptory commands of\n  his father, and has determined to forget my Emmeline.\n\n    'Is it then probable any one can forget her? I know not of what\n  the volatile and thoughtless Delamere may be capable; but I know\n  that of all things it would be the most impossible to her truly\n  attached and affectionate,\n\n                                                        C. STAFFORD.'\n\n  _Woodfield, Nov. 30._\n\n\nThis letter gave great relief to the mind of the dejected Emmeline. That\nher first and dearest friend, opened at this painful crisis her\nconsolatory bosom to receive and pity her; and that she should have the\npower to share her fatigue, and lessen the weight of her anxiety during\nthe slow recovery of her child; seemed to be considerations which\nsoftened all the anguish she had endured during the day.\n\nShe was however too much disordered to go down to tea; and told Mrs.\nAshwood, who civilly came up to enquire after her, that she had a\nviolent pain in her head and would go to bed.\n\nMrs. Ashwood, full of her increased fortune, and busied in studying to\nmake her deep mourning as becoming as possible, let her do as she would,\nand thought no more about her.\n\nShe had therefore time to meditate at leisure on her wayward fate: and\nsome surprise that Delamere had not appeared the whole day, mingled\nitself with her reflections.\n\nPoor Delamere was not to blame. Lord Montreville had sent him very early\nin the morning to desire to see him for five minutes on business of\nconsequence.\n\nDelamere, who from what had passed the evening before had indulged,\nduring the night, the fondest dreams of happiness, obeyed the summons\nnot without some hopes that he should hear all his favourable presages\nconfirmed. When he came, however, his father, waving all discourse that\nrelated to Emmeline or himself, affected to consult him on a proposal he\nhad received for his eldest sister, which the family were disposed to\npromote; and after detaining him as long as he could on this and on\nother subjects, he desired him to send to his lodgings for Millefleur,\nand to dress as expeditiously as possible, in order to accompany him to\ndine at Lord Dornock's, a Scottish nobleman, with whom his Lordship was\ndeeply engaged in the depending negociation with Ministry; and who was\nat his seat, about nine miles from London.\n\nDelamere reluctantly engaged in such a party. But however short his\nfather's discourse fell of what he hoped, he yet determined to get the\nbetter of his repugnance and obey him; still flattering himself that\nLord Montreville would lead to the subject nearest his heart, or that in\nthe course of the day he should at least have an opportunity of\nintroducing it.\n\nThey therefore set out together, on the most amicable terms, in Lord\nMontreville's coach. But as they had taken up on their way a gentleman\nwho held a place under Lord Dornock, his presence prevented any\nconversation but on general subjects, during their short journey.\n\nThe dinner passed as such dinners generally do--too much in the secret\nto touch on politics, all such discourse was carefully avoided at the\ntable of Lord Dornock.\n\nIn literature they had no resource; and therefore the conversation\nchiefly turned on the pleasure they were then enjoying--that of the\nluxuries of the table. They determined on the merits of the venison of\nthe past season; settled what was the best way of preparing certain\ndishes; and whose domain produced the most exquisite materials for\nothers. And on these topics a society of cooks could not have more\nlearnedly descanted.\n\nDelamere, not yet of an age to be initiated into the noble science of\neating, and among whose ideas of happiness the delights of gratifying\nhis palate had not yet been numbered, heard them with impatience and\ndisgust.\n\nHe was obliged, however, to stay while the wines were criticised as\neloquently as the meats had been; and to endure a long harangue from the\nmaster of the house, on _cote roti_ and _lacryma Christi_; and after the\nelder part of the company had adjusted their various merits and\nswallowed a sufficient quantity, the two noblemen retired to a private\nconference; and Delamere, obliged to move into a circle of insipid\nwomen, took refuge in cards, which he detested almost as much as the\nentertainment he had just quitted.\n\nThe hours, however slowly, wore away, and his patience was almost\nexhausted: soon after ten o'clock he ventured to send to his father, to\nknow whether he was ready to return to town? but he received a message\nin reply, 'that he had determined to stay all night where he was.'\n\nVexed and angry, Delamere began to suspect that his father had some\ndesign in thus detaining him at a distance from Emmeline; and fired by\nindignation at this idea, equally scorning to submit to restraint or to\nbe detained by finesse, he disengaged himself from the card table,\nfetched his hat, and without speaking to any body, walked to the next\nvillage, where he got into a post-chaise and was presently in London;\nbut as it was almost twelve o'clock, he forbore to visit Emmeline that\nnight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nAs soon as there was any probability of Emmeline's being visible the\nnext morning, Delamere was at Clapham.\n\nThe servant of whom he enquired for her, told him, that Miss Mowbray had\nnot yet rung her bell, and that as it was later than her usual hour, she\nwas afraid it was owing to her being ill.\n\nAlarmed at this intelligence, Delamere eagerly questioned her further;\nand learned that the preceding morning, a gentleman who had never been\nthere before, had been to see Miss Mowbray, and had staid with her about\nthree quarters of an hour, during which he had talked very loud; and\nthat after he was gone, she had hastened to her own room, crying sadly,\nand had seemed very much vexed the whole day afterwards. That when she\nwent to bed, which was early in the evening, she had sighed bitterly,\nand said she was not well. The servants, won by the sweetness and\nhumanity with which Emmeline treated them, all seemed to consider her\nhealth and happiness as their own concern; and the girl who delivered\nthis intelligence to Delamere, had been very much about her, and knowing\nher better, loved her more than the others.\n\nDelamere could not doubt the truth of this account; yet he could not\nconjecture who the stranger could be, in whose power it was thus to\ndistress Emmeline. But dreading lest some scheme was in agitation to\ntake her from him, he sat in insupportable anxiety 'till she should\nsummons the maid.\n\nHer music book lay open on a _piano forte_ in the breakfast parlour. A\nsong which he had a few days before desired her to learn, as being one\nwhich particularly charmed him, seemed to have been just copied into it,\nand he fancied the notes and the writing were executed with more than\nher usual elegance. Under it was a little _porte feuille_ of red\nmorocco. Delamere took it up. It was untied; and two or three small\ntinted drawings fell out. He saw the likeness of Mrs. Stafford, done\nfrom memory; one yet more striking of his sister Augusta; and two or\nthree unfinished resemblances of persons he did not know, touched with\nless spirit than the other two. A piece of silver paper doubled together\nenclosed another; he opened it--it was a drawing of himself, done with a\npencil, and slightly tinged with a crayon; strikingly like; but it\nseemed unfinished, and somewhat effaced.\n\nThough among so many other portraits, this could not be considered as a\nvery flattering distinction, Delamere, on seeing it, was not master of\nhis transports. He now believed Emmeline (whom he could never induce to\nown that her partiality for him exceeded the bounds of friendship) yet\ncherished in her heart a passion she would not avow.\n\nWhile he was indulging these sanguine and delicious hopes, he heard a\nbell ring, and flew to enquire if it was that of Emmeline?\n\nThe maid, who crossed the hall to attend it's summons, told him it was.\nHe stepped softly up stairs behind the servant, and waited at the door\nof the chamber while she went in.\n\nTo the question, from the maid, 'how she did?' Emmeline answered, 'much\nbetter.'\n\n'Mr. Delamere is here, Madam, and begs to know whether he may see you?'\n\nEmmeline had expected him all the day before, and was not at all\nsurprised at his coming now. But she knew not what she should say to\nhim. To dissimulate was to her almost impossible; yet to tell him what\nhad passed between her and Sir Richard Crofts was to create dissentions\nof the most alarming nature between him and his father; for she knew\nDelamere would immediately and warmly resent the harshness of Lord\nMontreville.\n\nShe could not however determine to avoid seeing Delamere; and she\nthought his Lordship was not entitled to much consideration, after the\nindelicate and needless shock he had given her, by employing the\nperemptory, insolent, and unfeeling Sir Richard Crofts.\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation, she told Nanny to let Mr. Delamere know\nthat as soon as she was dressed she would be with him in the parlour.\n\nDelamere, who heard the message, stepped softly down stairs, replaced\nthe drawings, and waited the entrance of Emmeline; who neither requiring\nor accustoming herself to borrow any advantage from art or ornament, was\nsoon dressed in her usual simple undress.\n\nBut to give some appearance of truth to what she intended to alledge, a\ncold, in excuse for her swollen eyes and languid looks, she wrapt a\ngauze hood over her head, and tied a black ribband round her throat; for\ntho' she could not wholly conceal the truth from Delamere, she wished to\nprevent his seeing how much it had affected her.\n\nWhen she entered the room, Delamere, who was at the door to meet her,\nwas astonished at the alteration he saw in her countenance.\n\n'You are ill, Emmeline?' said he, taking her hand.\n\n'I am not quite well--I have a violent cold coming.'\n\n'A cold?' eagerly answered Delamere, 'you have been crying--who was the\nperson who called on you yesterday?'\n\nIt was now in vain to attempt concealment if she had intended it.\n\n'He did not tell me his name, for our conversation was very short; but\nhis servants told those of Mrs. Ashwood that his name is Sir Richard\nCrofts.'\n\n'And what business could Sir Richard Crofts possibly have with you?'\n\nEmmeline related the conversation with great fidelity and without\ncomment.\n\nDelamere had hardly patience to hear her out. He protested he would\nimmediately go to Sir Richard Crofts, and not only force him to\napologize for what had passed, but promise never again to interfere\nbetween Lord Montreville and his family.\n\nFrom executing this violent measure, Emmeline by earnest entreaty\ndiverted him. She had not yet recovered the shock given her by the\nunwelcome interview of the preceding day; and though she had a very\nexcellent constitution, her sensibility of mind was so great, that when\nshe suffered any poignant uneasiness, it immediately affected her frame.\nIn the present state of her spirits, she could not hear Delamere's\nvehement and passionate exclamations without tears; and when he saw how\nmuch she was hurt, he commanded himself; spoke more calmly; and by a\nrapid transition from rage to tenderness, he wept also, and bathed her\nhands with his tears.\n\nHe was not without hopes that this last effort of Lord Montreville would\neffect a change in his favour; and he pleaded again for an elopement\nwith the warmest eloquence of love.\n\nBut Emmeline, though she felt all the force of his arguments, had still\nthe courage to resist them; and all he could obtain from her was a\nrenewal of her former promise, neither to leave Mrs. Ashwood unknown to\nhim or to conceal the place of her residence; to consent to see him\nwherever she should be, and positively to reject Mr. Rochely's offer.\n\nIn return, she expected from Delamere some concessions which nothing but\nthe sight of her uneasiness would have induced him to grant. At length\nshe persuaded him to promise that he would not insult Sir Richard\nCrofts, or commit any other rashness which might irritate Lord\nMontreville.\n\nNothing was a stronger proof of the deep root which his passion had\ntaken in his heart, than the influence Emmeline had obtained over his\nungovernable and violent spirit, hitherto unused to controul, and\naccustomed from his infancy to exert over his own family the most\nboundless despotism.\n\nEmmeline, tranquillized and consoled by his promises, then entreated him\nto go; as the state of Mrs. Ashwood's family made visitors improper. In\nthis, too, he obeyed her. And as soon as he was gone, Emmeline sat down\nto write to Mrs. Stafford, related briefly what had lately happened, and\ntold her, that as soon as Lord Montreville could be induced to settle\nsome yearly sum for her support, (which notwithstanding his threats she\nstill thought he would do, on condition of her engaging never, without\nhis consent, to marry Delamere,) she would set out for Woodfield.\n\nLord Montreville, absorbed in politics and in a negociation with\nministry, had, on the evening when he and his son were at Lord\nDornock's, forgotten the impatient temper and particular situation of\nDelamere. His non appearance at supper occasioned an enquiry, and it was\nfound he had left the house. It was too late for Lord Montreville to\nfollow him that night, and would, indeed, have been useless; but early\nthe next morning he was in Berkley-square, where he heard nothing of his\nson.\n\nHe received a letter from Sir Richard Crofts, relating the ill success\nof his embassy; but adding, that he would bring Rochely to his Lordship\nthe next day, to consider together what was next to be done. A letter\nalso soon after arrived from Lady Montreville, to let his Lordship know\nthat herself and her daughter, with Lady Mary and Miss Otley, were\ncoming to town the next evening.\n\nDelamere, the tumult of whose spirits was too great immediately to\nsubside, took, for the first time in his life, some pains to conquer\ntheir violence, in consideration of Emmeline.\n\nHe sent his servants to Berkley-square, to enquire among the domestics\nwhat had passed. He thence learned that his father had returned in the\nmorning from Lord Dornock's in very ill humour, and that his mother was\nexpected in town. An interview with either, would, he was conscious,\nonly be the occasion of that dissention he had promised Emmeline to\navoid. His mother, he knew, came to town determined to keep no terms\nwith him; and that she would incessantly harrass him with reproaches or\nteize him with entreaties. He therefore determined to avoid entirely all\nconversation with both; and after a short reflection on the best means\nto do so, he ordered Millefleur to discharge the lodgings; told him and\nhis other two servants that he was going out of town, and should not\ntake either them or his horses; therefore would have them go to\nBerkley-square, and wait there his return. He bade his valet tell Lord\nMontreville that he should be absent ten days or a fortnight. Then\nordering an hackney coach, he directed it to drive to Westminster\nBridge, as if he meant there to take post: instead of which he dismissed\nit at the end of Bridge-street; and walking over to the Surry side, he\npresently provided himself with lodgings under the name of Mr. Oswald, a\ngentleman just come from Ireland; and all traces of Mr. Delamere were\nlost.\n\n\n    END OF THE FIRST VOLUME\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME II\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nSir Richard Crofts brought Mr. Rochely to Lord Montreville at the time\nappointed; and in consequence of the conversation then held, his\nLordship was confirmed in his resolution of persisting in the plan Sir\nRichard had laid down, to force Emmeline to accept the good fortune\noffered her. Lord Montreville had sent as soon as he got to town to\nDelamere's lodgings, whose servants said that he had slept there, but\nwas then gone out. His Lordship concluded he was gone to Clapham; but as\nhe could not remedy his uneasiness on that head, he was obliged to\nendure it. About twelve o'clock Delamere had arranged matters for his\nconcealment; and about three, as Lord Montreville was dressing to go\nout, Millefleur, together with Delamere's footman and groom, came as\nthey had been ordered to Berkley-square. This circumstance was no sooner\nrelated to Lord Montreville by his valet de chambre, than he ordered\nMillefleur to be sent up. The Frenchman related to his Lordship, that\nhis master was certainly gone to Mr. Percival's; but Lord Montreville\nconcluded he was gone to Scotland, and, in a tempest of anger and\nvexation, cursed the hour when he had listened to the advice of Sir\nRichard Crofts, the harshness of whose proceedings had, he imagined,\nprecipitated the event he had so long dreaded. He was so entirely\npersuaded that this conjecture was the truth, that he first gave orders\nfor a post-chaise and four to be ready directly; then recollecting that\nif he overtook his son he had no power to force him back, he thought it\nbetter to take with him some one who could influence Emmeline. His\nyoungest daughter was still in Yorkshire; Mrs. Stafford he knew not\nwhere to find; but he supposed that Mrs. Ashwood, with whom she had\nlived some months, might have power to persuade her; and not knowing\nwhat else to do, indeed hardly knowing what he expected from the visit,\nhe ordered his coachman to be as expeditious as possible in conveying\nhim to the house of that lady.\n\nMrs. Ashwood, her brother, and four or five other persons related to the\nfamily, were at dinner. Lord Montreville entered the room; spoke to\nthose he knew with as much civility as he could; but not seeing Emmeline\namong them, his apprehensions were confirmed. He desired they would not\ndisturb themselves; and declined sharing their repast; but being unable\nto conceal his emotion till it was over, he said to Mrs. Ashwood--'I am\nsorry, Madam, to trouble you on this unhappy business. I did hope you\nwould have had the goodness at least to inform me of it. What can I do?'\nexclaimed he, breaking suddenly from his discourse and rising--'Good\nGod, what can I do?'\n\nThe company were silent, and amazed.\n\nMrs. Ashwood, however, said, 'I am sorry that any thing, my Lord, has\ndisturbed your Lordship. I am sure I should have been happy, my Lord,\ncould I have been of any service to your Lordship in whatever it is.'\n\n'Disturbed!' cried he, striking his forehead with his hand, 'I am\ndistracted! When did she go? How long has she been gone?'\n\n'Who, my Lord?'\n\n'Miss Mowbray--Emmeline--Oh! it will be impossible to overtake them!'\n\n'Gone! my Lord?'\n\n'Gone with Delamere!--Gone to Scotland!'\n\n'Miss Mowbray was however in the house not an hour ago,' said Miss\nGalton; 'I saw her myself go up the garden just as we sat down to\ndinner.'\n\n'Then she went to meet him!--then they went together!'--exclaimed Lord\nMontreville, walking round the room.\n\nAn assertion so positive staggered every one. They rose from table in\nconfusion.\n\n'Let us go up,' said Mrs. Ashwood; 'I can hardly think it possible, my\nLord, that Miss Mowbray is gone, unless your Lordship absolutely saw\nthem.'\n\nYet Mrs. Ashwood remembered that Delamere had been there in the morning,\nand that Emmeline had dined early alone, and had remained by herself all\nthe rest of the day, under pretence of sickness; and she began to\nbelieve that all this was done to give her time to elope with Delamere.\n\nShe went up stairs; and Lord Montreville, without knowing what he did,\nfollowed her. The stairs were carpetted; any one ascending was hardly\nheard; and Mrs. Ashwood suddenly throwing open the door of her chamber,\nLord Montreville saw her, with her handkerchief held to her face,\nhanging over a packet of papers which lay on the table before her.\n\nEmmeline did not immediately look up--an exclamation from Lord\nMontreville made her take her handkerchief from her eyes.\n\nShe arose; tried to conceal the sorrow visible in her countenance yet\nwet with tears, and assuming as much as she could her native ease and\nsweetness, she advanced towards his Lordship, who still stood at the\ndoor, amazed, and asked him if he would pardon her for desiring him to\nsit down in a bed-chamber; if not, she would wait on him below. She then\nwent back to the table; threw the papers into the casket that was on it;\nand placing a chair between that and the fire, again asked him if he\nwould do her the honour to sit down.\n\nLord Montreville did so, but said nothing. He was ashamed of his\nprecipitancy; yet as Emmeline did not know it, he would not mention it;\nand was yet too full of the idea to speak of any thing else.\n\nMrs. Ashwood had left them--Emmeline continued silent.\n\nLord Montreville, after a long pause, at length said, with a stern and\ndispleased countenance, 'I understand, Miss Mowbray, that my son was\nhere this morning.'\n\n'Yes, my Lord.'\n\n'Pray, do you know where he now is?'\n\n'I do not, indeed. Is he not at your Lordship's house?'\n\n'No; I am told by his servants that he is gone to Mr. Percival's--But\n_you_--'(continued he, laying a strong emphasis on the word) '_you_,\nMiss Mowbray, are I dare say better informed of his intentions than any\none else.'\n\n'Upon my word, my Lord,' answered Emmeline, astonished, 'I do _not_\nknow. He said nothing to me of an intention to go any where; on the\ncontrary, he told me he should be here again to-morrow.'\n\n'And is it possible you are ignorant of his having left London this\nmorning, immediately after he returned from visiting you?'\n\n'My Lord, I have never yet stooped to the meanness of a falsehood. Why\nshould your Lordship now suppose me guilty of it? I repeat--and I hope\nyou will do me the justice to believe me--upon my honour I do _not_\nknow whither Mr. Delamere is gone--nor do I know that he has left\nLondon.'\n\nLord Montreville could not but believe her. But while his fears were\nrelieved as to the elopement, they were awakened anew by the uncertainty\nof what was become of his son, and what his motive could be for this\nsudden disappearance.\n\nHe thought however the present opportunity of speaking to Emmeline of\nhis resolution was not to be neglected.\n\n'However ignorant you may be, Miss Mowbray,' said he, 'of the reason of\nhis having quitted his lodgings, you are not to learn that his motive\nfor estranging himself from his family, and becoming a stranger to his\nfather's house, originates in his inconsiderate attachment to you.\nContrary to the assurances you gave me at Swansea, you have encouraged\nthis attachment; and, as I understand from Sir Richard Crofts, you\nperemptorily and even rudely refuse the opportunity now offered you of\nestablishing yourself in rank and affluence, which no other young woman\nwould a moment hesitate to accept. Such a refusal cannot be owing to\nmere caprice; nor could it possibly happen had you not determined, in\ndespite of every objection, and of bringing discord into my family, to\nlisten to that infatuated and rash young man.'\n\n'Your Lordship does not treat me with your usual candour. I have\npromised you, voluntarily promised you, not to marry Mr. Delamere\nwithout your Lordship's consent. To prevent his coming here was out of\nmy power; but if I really aspired to the honour of which your Lordship\nthinks me ambitious, _what_ has prevented me from engaging at once with\nMr. Delamere? who has, I own to you, pressed me repeatedly to elope. My\nLord, while I am treated with kindness and confidence, I can rely upon\nmy own resolution to deserve it; _but_ when your Lordship, on suspicion\nor misrepresentation, is induced to withdraw that kindness and\nconfidence--why should _I_ make a point of honour, where _you_ no longer\nseem to expect it?'\n\nThe truth of this answer, as well as it's spirit, at once hurt and\nirritated Lord Montreville.\n\nDetermined to separate Emmeline from his son, he was mortified to be\nforced to acknowledge in his own breast that she merited all his\naffection, and angry that she should be in the right when he wished to\nhave found something to blame in her conduct. Pride and self-love seemed\nto resent that a little weak girl should pretend to a sense of\nrectitude, and a force of understanding greater than his own.\n\n'Miss Mowbray,' said his Lordship sharply, 'I will be very explicit with\nyou--either consent to marry Mr. Rochely, whose affection does you so\nmuch honour, or expect from me no farther kindness.'\n\n'Your Lordship knows,' answered Emmeline, 'that I have no friend on whom\nI have the least claim but you. If you abandon me--but, my Lord, ought\nyou to do it?----I am indeed most friendless!'\n\nShe could no longer command her tears--sobs obliged her to cease\nspeaking.\n\nLord Montreville thought her resolution would give way; and trying to\ndivest himself of all feeling, with an effort truly political, he\ndetermined to press his point.\n\n'It is in your power,' resumed he, 'not only to place yourself above all\nfear of such desertion, but to engage my affection and that of my whole\nfamily. You will be in a situation of life which I should hardly refuse\nfor one of the Miss Delameres. You will possess the most unbounded\naffluence, and a husband who adores you. A man unexceptionable in\ncharacter; of a mature age; and whose immense fortune is every day\nencreasing. You will be considered by me, and by Lady Montreville, as a\ndaughter of the house of Mowbray. The blemish of your birth will be\nwiped off and forgotten.'\n\nEmmeline wept more than before.\n\nAnd his Lordship continued, 'If you absurdly refuse an offer so\ninfinitely above your expectations, I shall consider myself as having\nmore than done my duty in putting it in your way; and that your folly\nand imprudence dissolve all obligation on my part. You must no longer\ncall yourself Mowbray; and you must forget that you ever were allowed to\nbe numbered among the relations of my family. Nor shall I think myself\nobliged in any manner to provide for a person, who in scorn of\ngratitude, prudence and reputation, throws from her an opportunity of\nproviding for herself.'\n\nEmmeline regained some degree of resolution. She looked up, her eyes\nstreaming with tears, and said, 'Well, my Lord! to the lowest indigence\nI must then submit; for to marry Mr. Rochely is not in my power.'\n\n'We will suppose for a moment,' resumed Lord Montreville, 'that you\ncould realize the visionary hopes you have presumed to indulge of\nuniting yourself to Mr. Delamere. Dear as he is to me and his mother, we\nare determined from that moment to renounce him--never shall the\nrebellious son who has dared to disobey us, be again admitted to our\npresence!--never will we acknowledge as his wife, a person forced upon\nus and introduced into our family in despite of our commands, and in\nviolation of duty, honour, and affection. _You_ will be the occasion of\nhis being loaded with the curses of both his parents, and of introducing\nmisery and discord into his family. Can you yourself be happy under such\ncircumstances? In point of fortune too you will find yourself\ndeceived--while _we_ live, Mr. Delamere can have but a very slender\nincome; and of every thing in our power we shall certainly deprive him,\nboth while we live, and at our decease. Consider well what I have said;\nand make use of your reason. Begin by giving up to me the ridiculous\nwitnesses of a ridiculous and boyish passion, which must be no longer\nindulged; to keep a picture of Delamere is discreditable and\nindelicate--you will not refuse to relinquish it?'\n\nHe reached over the table, and took from among two or three loose\npapers, which yet lay before Emmeline, a little blue enamelled case,\nwhich he concluded contained a miniature of Delamere, of whom several\nhad been drawn. Emmeline, absorbed in tears, did not oppose it. The\nspring of the case was defective. It opened in his hand; and presented\nto his view, not a portrait of his son, but of his brother, drawn when\nhe was about twenty, and at a period when he was more than a\nbrother--when he was the dearest friend Lord Montreville had on earth. A\nlikeness so striking, which he had not seen for many years, had an\nimmediate effect upon him.\n\nHis brother seemed to look at him mournfully. A melancholy cast about\nthe eye-brows diminished the vivacity of the countenance, and the faded\ncolour (for the picture had been painted seven and twenty years) gave it\na look of languor and ill health; such perhaps as the original wore\nbefore his death, when a ruined constitution threatened him for some\nmonths, tho' his life terminated by a malignant fever in a few hours.\n\nThe poor distrest Emmeline was the only memorial left of him; and Lord\nMontreville felt her tears a reproach for his cruelty in thus\nthreatening to abandon to her fate, the unhappy daughter of this once\nloved brother.\n\nSir Richard Crofts and Lady Montreville were not by, to intercept these\nsentiments of returning humanity. He found the tears fill his eyes as he\ngazed on the picture.\n\nEmmeline, insensible of every thing, saw it not; and not conscious that\nhe had taken it, the purport of his last words she believed to relate to\na sketch she had herself made of Delamere. She was therefore surprized,\nwhen Lord Montreville arising, took her hand, and in a voice that\nwitnessed the emotion of his soul, said--'Come, my dear Emmeline, pardon\nme for thus distressing you, you shall _not_ be compelled to marry Mr.\nRochely if you have so great a dislike to him. You shall still have an\nadequate support; and I trust I shall have nothing to fear from your\nindiscretion in regard to Delamere.'\n\n'Your Lordship,' answered Emmeline, without taking her handkerchief from\nher eyes, 'has never yet found me capable of falsehood: I will repeat,\nif you desire it, the promise I gave you--I will even take the most\nsolemn oath you shall dictate, never to be the wife of Mr. Delamere,\nunless your Lordship and Lady Montreville consent.'\n\n'I take your promise,' answered his Lordship, 'and shall rely firmly\nupon it. But Emmeline, you must go from hence for your own sake; your\npeace and reputation require it; Delamere must not frequent the house\nwhere you are: you must conceal from him the place of your abode.'\n\n'My Lord, I will be ingenuous with you. To go from hence is what I\nintend, and with your Lordship's permission I will set out immediately\nfor Mrs. Stafford's. But to conceal from Mr. Delamere where I am, is not\nin my power; for I have given him a solemn promise to see him if he\ndesires it, wherever I shall be: and as I hope you depend on my honour,\nit must be equally sacred whether given to him or you. You will\ntherefore not insist on my breaking this engagement, and I promise you\nagain never to violate the other.'\n\nWith this compromise, Lord Montreville was obliged to be content. He\nentreated Emmeline to see Rochely again, and hear his offers. But she\nabsolutely refused; assuring Lord Montreville, that were his fortune\ninfinitely greater, she would not marry him, tho' servitude should be\nthe alternative.\n\nHis Lordship therefore forbore to press her farther. He desired, that if\nDelamere wrote to her, or saw her, she would let him know, which she\nreadily agreed to; and he told her, that so long as she was single, and\ndid nothing to disoblige him, he would pay her an hundred guineas a year\nin quarterly payments. He gave her a bank note of fifty pounds; and\nrecommending it to her to go as soon as possible to Mrs. Stafford's, he\nkissed her cheek with an appearance of affection greater than he had yet\nshewn, and then went home to prepare for the reception of Lady\nMontreville, whose arrival he did not greatly wish for; dreading lest\nher violence and ill-temper should drive his son into some new\nextravagance. But as her will was not to be disputed, he submitted\nwithout remonstrance to the alteration of the plan he had proposed;\nwhich was, that his family should pass their Christmas in Norfolk,\nwhither he intended to have returned.\n\nThe next day Delamere was again at Clapham, very early.\n\nEmmeline, the additional agitation of whose mind had prevented her\nsleeping during the night, appeared more indisposed than she had done\nthe day before.\n\nDelamere, very much alarmed at her altered looks, anxiously enquired the\ncause? And without hesitation she told him simply all that had passed;\nthe promise she had given to his father, to which she intended strictly\nto adhere, and the arrangement she had agreed to on condition of being\npersecuted no more on the score of Mr. Rochely.\n\nIt is impossible to describe the grief and indignation of Delamere, at\nhearing this relation. He saw all the hopes frustrated which he had been\nso long indulging; he saw between him and all he loved, a barrier which\ntime only could remove; he dared not hope that Emmeline would ever be\ninduced to break an engagement which she considered as binding; he dared\nnot flatter himself with the most distant prospect of procuring the\nconsent of Lord and Lady Montreville, and therefore by their deaths only\ncould he obtain her; which if he had been unnatural enough to wish, was\nyet in all probability very distant; as Lord Montreville was not more\nthan seven and forty, and of an excellent constitution; and Lady\nMontreville three years younger.\n\nPassion and resentment for some moments stifled every other sentiment in\nthe heart of Delamere. But the impediments that thus arose to his wishes\nwere very far from diminishing their violence.\n\nThe more impossible his union with Emmeline seemed to be, the more\nardently he desired it. The difficulties that might have checked, or\nconquered an inferior degree of passion, served only to strengthen his,\nand to render it insurmountable--\n\nIt was some moments before Emmeline could prevail upon him to listen to\nher. She then enquired why he had concealed himself from his father, and\nwhere he had been?\n\nHe answered, that he had avoided Lord Montreville, because, had he met\nhim, he found himself incapable of commanding his temper and of\nforbearing to resent his sending Sir Richard Crofts to her, which he had\npromised her not to do. That therefore he had taken other lodgings in\nanother part of the town, where he intended to remain.\n\nEmmeline exhorted and implored him to return to Berkley-square. He\npositively refused. He refused also to tell her where he lodged. And\ncomplaining loudly of her cruelty and coldness, yet tenderly entreating\nher to take care of her health, he left her; having first procured\npermission to see her the next day, and every day till she set out for\nWoodfield.\n\nWhen he was gone, Miss Mowbray wrote to Lord Montreville--\n\n\n    'My Lord,\n\n    'In pursuance of the word I passed to your Lordship, I have the\n  honour to acquaint you that Mr. Delamere has just left me. I\n  endeavoured to prevail on him to inform me where he lodges; but he\n  refuses to give me the least information. If it be your Lordship's\n  wish to see him, you will probably have an opportunity of doing it\n  here, as he proposed being here to-morrow; but refused to name the\n  hour, apprehending perhaps that you might meet him, as I did not\n  conceal from him that I should acquaint you with my having seen him.\n\n                                      I have the honour to be,\n                                                        my Lord,\n                                                   your Lordship's\n                                              most obedient servant,\n                                                    EMMELINE MOWBRAY.'\n  _Clapham, Dec. 3._\n\n\nLord Montreville received this letter in her Ladyship's dressing-room.\nThe servant who brought it in, said it came from Clapham; and Lady\nMontreville insisted on seeing its contents. She had been before\nacquainted with what had passed; and bestowed on her son the severest\ninvectives for his obstinacy and folly. Poor Emmeline however, who was\nthe cause of it, was the principal object of her resentment and disdain.\nEven this last instance of her rectitude, could not diminish the\nprejudice which embittered the mind of Lady Montreville against her. She\nlamented, whenever she deigned to speak of her, that the laws of this\ncountry, unlike those of better regulated kingdoms, did not give people\nof fashion power to remove effectually those who interfered with their\nhappiness, or were inimical to their views. 'If this little wretch,'\nsaid she, 'was in France, it would not be difficult to put an end to the\ntrouble she has dared to give us. A _letter de cachet_ would cure the\ncreature of her presumption, and place her where her art and affectation\nshould not disturb the peace of families of high rank.'\n\nLord Montreville heard these invectives without reply, but not without\npain.\n\nAugusta Delamere, who arrived in Berkley-square the same morning that\nLady Montreville did, felt still more hurt by her mother's determined\nhatred to Emmeline, whom she languished to see, and had never ceased to\nlove.\n\nMiss Delamere inheriting all the pride of her mother, and adding to it a\nsufficient share of vanity and affectation of her own, had taken a\ndislike to the persecuted Emmeline, if possible more inveterate than\nthat of Lady Montreville. Tho' she had never seen her, she detested her;\nand exerted all her influence on her mother to prevent her being\nreceived into the family as her father's relation. Fitz-Edward had\npraised her as the most interesting woman he had ever seen. Miss\nDelamere had no aversion to Fitz-Edward; and tho' he had never seemed\nsensible of the honour she did him, she could not divest herself wholly\nof that partiality towards him, which made her heartily abhor any woman\nhe seemed to admire. When to this cause of dislike was added, what she\ncalled the insolent presumption of the animal in daring to attempt\ninveigling _her_ brother into the folly of marrying, she thought she\nmight indulge all the rancour, envy, and malignity of her heart.\n\nWhen Lady Montreville had read the letter, she threw it down on the\ntable contemptuously.\n\n'It requires no answer,' said she to the servant who waited.\n\nThe man left the room.\n\n'Well, my Lord,' continued she, addressing herself to her husband, 'what\ndo you intend to do about this unhappy, infatuated boy?'\n\n'I really know not,' answered his Lordship.\n\n'I will tell you then,' resumed she--'Go to this girl, and let her know\nthat you will abandon her pennyless; force her to accept the honour Mr.\nRochely offers her; and, by shewing a little strength of mind and\nresolution, break these unworthy chains with which your own want of\nprudence has fettered your son.'\n\n'It has already been tried, Madam, without success. Consider that if I\nam bound by no obligations to support this young person, I am also\nwithout any power over her. To force her to marry Mr. Rochely is\nimpossible. I have however her promise that she will not enter into any\nclandestine engagement with Delamere.'\n\n'Her promise!' exclaimed Lady Montreville.--'And are you weak enough, my\nLord, to trust to the promise of an artful, designing creature, who\nseems to me to have already won over your Lordship to her party? What\nwant of common sense is this! If you will not again speak to her, and\nthat most decisively, I will do it myself! Send her to me! I will force\nher not only to tell me where Delamere has had the meanness to conceal\nhimself, but also oblige her to relinquish the hopes she has the\ninsolence to indulge.'\n\nMiss Delamere, who wanted to see the wonderful creature that had turned\nher brother's head, and who was charmed to think she should see her\nhumbled and mortified, promoted this plan as much as possible. Augusta,\ndreading her brother's violence, dared not, and Lord Montreville would\nnot oppose it, as he believed her Ladyship's overwhelming rhetoric, to\nwhich he was himself frequently accustomed to give way, might produce on\nEmmeline the effect he had vainly attempted. He therefore asked Lady\nMontreville, whether she really wished to see Miss Mowbray, and when?\n\n'I am engaged to-morrow,' answered she, 'all day. But however, as she is\na sort of person whom it will be improper to admit at any other time,\nlet her be here at ten o'clock in the morning. She may come up, before I\nbreakfast, into my dressing-room.'\n\n'Shall I send one of the carriages for her?' enquired his Lordship.\n\n'By no means,' replied the Lady. 'They will be all wanted. Let her\nborrow a coach of the people she lives with. I suppose all city people\nnow keep coaches. Or if she cannot do that, a hack may be had.' Then\nturning to her woman, who had just brought her her snuff-box,\n'Brackley,' said she, 'don't forget to order the porter to admit a\nyoung woman who will be here to-morrow, at ten o'clock; tho' she may\nperhaps come in a hack.'\n\nLord Montreville, who grew every hour more uneasy at Delamere's absence,\nnow set out in search of him himself. He called at Fitz-Edward's\nlodgings; but he was not yet come to town, tho' hourly expected. His\nLordship then went to Clapham, where he hoped to meet his son; but\ninstead of doing so, Emmeline put into his hands the following letter--\n\n\n    'I intended to have seen you again to-day; but the pain I felt\n  after our interview yesterday, has so much disordered me, that it\n  is better not to repeat it. Cruel Emmeline!--to gratify my father\n  you throw me from you without remorse, without pity. I shall be the\n  victim of his ambition, and of your false and mistaken ideas of\n  honour.\n\n    'Ah! Emmeline! will the satisfaction that you fancy will arise\n  from this chimerical honour make you amends for the loss of such an\n  heart as mine! Yet think not I can withdraw it from you, cold and\n  cruel as you are. Alas! it is no longer in my power. But my\n  passions, the violence of which I cannot mitigate, prey on my frame,\n  and will conduct to the grave, this unhappy son, who is to be\n  sacrificed to the cursed politics of his family.\n\n    'I cannot see you, Emmeline, without a renewal of all those\n  sensations which tear me to pieces, and which I know affect you,\n  though you try to conceal it. For a day or two I will go into the\n  country. _Remember your promise_ not to remove any where but to Mrs.\n  Stafford's; and to let me know the day and hour when you set out.\n  You plead to me, that your promise to my father is _sacred_. I\n  expect that those you have passed to me shall be at least equally\n  so. Farewel! till we meet again. You know that seeing you, and being\n  permitted to love you, is all that renders supportable the existence\n  of your unhappy\n\n                                                                 F. D.'\n\n\n'This letter, my Lord,' said Emmeline, was delivered by a porter. I\nspoke to the man, and asked him from whence he brought it? He said from\na coffee-house at Charing-cross.'\n\n'Did you answer it?'\n\n'No, my Lord,' said Emmeline, blushing; 'I think it required no\nanswer.'\n\nHe then told her that Lady Montreville expected to see her the next day;\nand named the hour.\n\nEmmeline, terrified as she was at the idea of such an interview, was\nforced to assure him she would be punctual to it; and his Lordship took\nan hasty leave, still hoping he might meet his son. He was hardly gone,\nbefore another porter brought to Emmeline a second letter: it was from\nAugusta Delamere.\n\n\n    'At length, my dear Emmeline, I am near you, and can tell you I\n  still love you; tho' even that satisfaction I am forced to snatch\n  unknown to my mother. Oh, Emmeline! I tremble for your situation\n  to-morrow. The dislike that both my mother and sister have taken to\n  you, is inconceivable; and I am afraid that you will have a great\n  deal of rudeness and unkindness to encounter. I write this to\n  prepare you for it; and hope that your conscious innocence, and the\n  generosity with which you have acted, will support you. I have been\n  taken to task most severely by my mother for my partiality to you;\n  and my sister, in her contemptuous way, calls you my sweet\n  sentimental friend. To be sure my brother's absence is a dreadful\n  thing; and great allowances are to be made for my mother's\n  vexation; tho' I own I do not see why it should prevent her being\n  just. I will try to be in the room to-morrow, tho' perhaps I shall\n  not be permitted. Don't say you have heard from me, for the world;\n  but be assured I shall always love you as you deserve, and be most\n  truly\n\n                                    your affectionate and faithful,\n                                                        A. DELAMERE.'\n\n  _Berkley-square, Dec. 5._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nEmmeline had the convenience of Mrs. Ashwood's carriage, who agreed to\nset her down in Berkley-square. She was herself sitting for her picture;\nand told Miss Mowbray she would send the chariot back for her when she\ngot to the house of the painter.\n\nExactly at ten o'clock they arrived at the door of Lord Montreville; and\nEmmeline, who had been arguing herself into some degree of resolution as\nshe went along, yet found her courage much less than she thought she\nshould have occasion for; and with faultering steps and trembling nerves\nshe went up stairs. The man who conducted her, told her that his Lady\nwas not yet up, and desired her to wait in an anti-room, which was\nsuperbly furnished and covered with glasses, in which Emmeline had\nleisure to contemplate her pale and affrighted countenance.\n\nThe longer the interview was delayed the more dreadful it appeared. She\ndared not ask for Miss Augusta; yet, at every noise she heard, hoped\nthat amiable girl was coming to console and befriend her. But no Augusta\nappeared. A servant came in, mended the fire, and went down again; then\nMiss Delamere's maid, under pretence of fetching something, took a\nsurvey of her in order to make a report to her mistress; and Emmeline\nfound that she was an object of curiosity to the domesticks, who had\nheard from Millefleur, and from the other servants who had been at\nSwansea, that this was the young woman Mr. Delamere was dying for.\n\nAn hour and a half was now elapsed; and poor Emmeline, whose imagination\nhad been busied the whole time in representing every form of insult and\ncontempt with which she expected to be received, began to hope that Lady\nMontreville had altered her intention of seeing her.\n\nAt length, however, Mrs. Brackley, her Ladyship's woman, was heard\nspeaking aloud to a footman--Walter, tell that young woman she may be\nadmitted to see my Lady, and shew her up.\n\nWalter delivered his message; and the trembling Emmeline with some\ndifficulty followed him.\n\nShe entered the dressing-room. Her Ladyship, in a morning dress, sat at\na table, on which was a salver with coffee. Her back was to the door,\nwhere stood Mrs. Brackley; who, as Emmeline, hesitating, seemed ready to\nshrink back, said, with a sort of condescending nod, 'There, you may go\nin, Miss.'\n\nEmmeline entered; but did not advance.\n\nLady Montreville, without rising or speaking, turned her head, and\nlooked at her with a scowling and disdainful countenance.\n\n'Humph!' said she, looking at her eldest daughter, who sat by the fire\nwith a newspaper in her hand--'humph!' as much as to say, I see no such\ngreat beauty in this creature.\n\nMiss Delamere, whose countenance wore a sort of disdainful sneer,\nsmiled in answer to her mother's humph! and said, 'Would you have her\nsit down, Madam?'\n\n'Aye,' said Lady Montreville, turning again her head towards\nEmmeline--'You may sit down.'\n\nThere was a sofa near the door. Emmeline, hardly able to stand, went to\nit.\n\nA silence ensued. Lady Montreville sipped her coffee; and Miss Delamere\nseemed intent upon the newspaper.\n\n'So!' cried her Ladyship, 'my son has absented himself! Upon my word,\nMiss What-d'ye-call-it, (for Mowbray I don't allow that your name is)\nyou have a great deal to answer for. Pray what amends can you ever hope\nto make to my Lord, and me, for the trouble you have been the cause of?'\n\n'I sincerely lament it, Madam,' answered Emmeline, forcing herself to\nspeak; 'and do assure you it has been on my part involuntary.'\n\n'Oh, no doubt on't. Your wonderful beauty is the fatal cause. You have\nused no art, I dare say; no pretty finesse, learned from novels, to\ninveigle a silly boy to his undoing.'\n\n'If I had been disposed, Madam, to take advantage of Mr. Delamere's\nunhappy partiality for me--'\n\n'Oh dear! What you was coy? You knew your subject, no doubt, and now\nmake a merit of what was merely a piece of art. I detest such demure\nhypocrites! Tell me,--why, if you are _not_ disposed to take advantage\nof Mr. Delamere's folly, you do not accept the noble offer made you by\nthis banker, or whatever he is, that my Lord says is worth above an\nhundred thousand pounds? The reason is evident. A little obscure\ncreature, bred on the Welch mountains, and who was born nobody knows\nhow, does not so easily refuse a man of fortune unless she has some\nother views. You would like a handsome young man with a title! Yes! you\nwould like to hide your own obscurity in the brilliant pedigree of one\nof the first families in Europe. But know, presumptuous girl, that the\nwhole house shall perish ere it shall thus be contaminated--know'----\nShe grew inarticulate with passion; pride and malignity seemed to choak\nher; and she stopped, as if to recover breath to give vent to her rage.\n\nMiss Delamere took the opportunity to speak--\n\n'Indeed, child,' said she, 'it is hurting yourself extremely; and I am\nreally sorry you should be so deceived. _My_ brother can never marry\n_you_; and as Lord Montreville has brought you up, under the notion of\nyour belonging to a part of his family, we are really interested, my\nmother and I, in your not going into a bad course of life. If you do not\nmarry this rich city-man, what do you think is to become of you?'\n\n'My Lord Montreville has been so good as to assure me,' said\nEmmeline--her words were so faint, that they died away upon her lips.\n\n'What does she say, Fanny?' asked Lady Montreville.\n\n'Something of my father's having assured her, Madam.'\n\n'Don't flatter yourself, girl,' resumed her Ladyship, 'don't deceive\nyourself. If you refuse to marry this man who offers to take you, not\none shilling shall you ever receive from this family; determine\ntherefore at once; send to the person in question; let him come here,\nand let an agreement for a settlement be directly signed between Lord\nMontreville and him. Lord Montreville will in that case give you a\nfortune. I will hear no objection! I _will_ have the affair closed this\nmorning! I _will_ have it so!'\n\nLady Montreville, accustomed to undisputed power in her own family,\nexpected from every body an acquiescence as blind as she found from her\ntradesmen and servants, who endured her ill-humour and gave way to her\ncaprices. But she forgot that Emmeline was equally unaccustomed to her\ncommands, and free from the necessity of obeying them. The gentlest and\nmildest temper will revolt against insolence and oppression: and the\ncruelty and unfeminine insults she had received, concluded by this\nperemptory way of forcing her into a marriage from which her whole soul\nrecoiled, at length restored to her some portion of that proper spirit\nand presence of mind which had been frightened from her. Conscious that\nshe deserved none of these ungenerous insults, and feeling herself\nsuperior to her who could cruelly and wantonly inflict them, she\nregained her courage.\n\n'If your Ladyship has nothing more to say,' said she, rising, 'I shall\nhave the honour to wish you a good morning; for I believe Mrs. Ashwood\nhas been waiting for me some time.'\n\n'Don't tell me of Mrs. Ashwood--but tell me where is my son? Where is\nDelamere?'\n\n'I know not,' answered Emmeline. 'I have already told my Lord\nMontreville that I am entirely ignorant.'\n\n'Nobody believes it!' said Miss Delamere.\n\n'I am sorry for it,' replied Emmeline, coolly. 'If, however, I did know,\nit is not such treatment, Madam, that should compel me to give any\ninformation.' She then opened the door and walked down stairs. A footman\nmet her, whom she desired to enquire for Mrs. Ashwood's carriage. Before\nthe man could descend to obey her, a violent ringing was heard. The\nfootman said it was his Lady's bell, and ran up to answer it; while\nEmmeline still descending, heard somebody softly calling her. She looked\nup, and saw Augusta Delamere leaning over the bannisters; she put up her\nfinger as if to prevent Emmeline's speaking, threw her a letter, and\nimmediately disappeared.\n\nThe spirits of Emmeline were again greatly hurried by this transient\nview of her friend. She put the letter hastily into her pocket, and was\ngot down into the hall, where she spoke to another footman to see for\nher carriage; but the man whom she had met on the stairs, now came to\nsay his Lady must see her again. Emmeline answered that she had already\nmade her friend wait, and must beg to be excused returning to her\nLadyship this morning. The man however said, that he dared not disobey\nhis Lady, nor call up the chariot.\n\nEmmeline, alarmed at the idea of being detained, advanced towards the\ndoor, told the porter (who had not heard this dialogue,) to open it, and\nwalked resolutely into the street.\n\nThe two footmen followed her to the door; but contented themselves with\nlooking after her, without attempting to stop her.\n\n'She is pretty enough, however,' said one to the other, 'to excuse our\nyoung Lord.'\n\n'The devil's in't if she is not,' answered the other.\n\nEmmeline heard this; and between vexation at their impertinence, and\nfear of their following her, she found her whole strength again forsake\nher.\n\nShe walked on however towards Charles-street, looking round for Mrs.\nAshwood's carriage, but could not see it. She was totally unacquainted\nwith the streets, where she had never been on foot before; but\nrecollected that she might get an hackney-coach, which was the more\nnecessary, as snow was falling fast, and her muslin cloaths were already\nwet almost through.\n\nShe was picking her way, still in some hopes of seeing the carriage,\nwhen an hackney-coach passed empty. Emmeline looked wishfully towards\nit. The man stopped, and asked if she wanted a coach? She answered yes,\nas eagerly as if she had been afraid of a disappointment; and hurrying\ninto it, told the man to drive to Clapham.\n\nJust as he was mounting the box, another hack passed, and a young\nofficer who was in it looked earnestly into that where Emmeline sat;\nthen calling to his driver to stop, he leaped out, and Emmeline saw\nFitz-Edward at the door of her coach.\n\n'Miss Mowbray!' said he--'Is it possible! alone and in this equipage, in\nBerkley-square! Where is Delamere?'\n\nBefore Emmeline had time to answer him he had opened the coach door.\n\n'It snows too much,' said he, 'for a comfortable conference, unless you\nwill give me leave to sit by you; where are you going to?'\n\n'To Clapham,' answered Emmeline.\n\n'Oh! take me with you,' said he. 'I have a thousand things to say to\nyou.'\n\nHe gave her no time to refuse: but flinging half a crown to the man who\nhad driven him, he got into the coach which she was in, and ordered the\nman to shut the door and go where he had been directed.\n\nEmmeline was vexed at this incident, as she was too uneasy to wish for\nthe presence of any one, and impatient to open the letter in her pocket.\nBut Fitz-Edward was not easily discouraged; and possessed, together with\nperfect good breeding, a fortunate sort of assurance with which nobody\nwas ever long displeased.\n\nHe enquired after Mrs. Stafford with a degree of interest for which\nEmmeline felt inclined to love him. She related all she knew of her; and\nher eyes reassumed their lustre, while she told him how soon she was\nlikely to see her. He then renewed his questions about Delamere.\n\nEmmeline could not dissemble; and indeed saw in this case no reason why\nshe should. She therefore told him ingenuously all that had happened\nsince they met at Swansea; most of which he already knew from Delamere.\nHe watched her looks however while she was speaking; and by her blushes,\nher manner, and the softness of her eyes, he thought he saw evidently\nenough that Delamere was no longer indifferent to her. Her indignation\nat the treatment she had just received from his mother and sister, dyed\nher cheeks with crimson while she related it; but when she returned to\nspeak of Delamere, she forgot her anger, and seemed to feel only pity\nand tenderness.\n\nFitz-Edward, a most perfect judge of female hearts, made his\nobservations on all this, with which he knew he should most effectually\ngratify his friend; and in his insinuating way, he said all he could\nthink of to encrease her compassion for her lover, and inflame her\nresentment against those who impeded a union, which he was pretty sure\nEmmeline now wished for, as well as Delamere.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nWhen they arrived at Clapham, Emmeline found Mrs. Ashwood was not yet\nreturned. Fitz-Edward entreated her to sing to him; and either was, or\npretended to be, in raptures at her improvement since they had met in\nthe summer.\n\nAbout half an hour after four, Mrs. Ashwood came in; and throwing open\nthe parlour door, asked Emmeline, in no very sweet accent, 'Why she had\ngiven her the trouble to go in her carriage to Berkley-square, if she\nintended going home by any other conveyance?'\n\nMrs. Ashwood was subject to causeless fits of ill-humour, to which\nEmmeline was a good deal accustomed; and concluding she was now seized\nwith some sudden discomposure of temper, mildly answered, 'That she\nsupposed there had been a mistake; for that the chariot did not come for\nher at the appointed time.'\n\n'Mistake!' replied the other lady, sharply; 'I don't know as to mistake;\nbut if you had chosen it, you might have staid dinner with Lady\nMontreville.'\n\nEmmeline, without seeming to attend to the asperity of the address,\ndesired to introduce Colonel Fitz-Edward.\n\nAs this short dialogue had passed without Mrs. Ashwood's having entered\nthe room, she had not seen the stranger, who now advanced towards her.\n\nThe title of Colonel, added to his military air and handsome figure,\nseemed to gain at once her favourable opinion; and her countenance\nlosing the unpleasing expression of ill-temper, immediately put on its\nbest smile, and an affectation of softness and complacency with which\nshe frequently adorned it.\n\nShe seemed to consider the handsome young soldier as a conquest worthy\nall her ambition; and finding he was the most intimate friend of\nDelamere, had no apprehension that his admiration would be diverted by\nthe youth and attractions of Emmeline.\n\nFitz-Edward presently understood her character; and with admirable\nadroitness acted the part of a man afraid of being too much charmed. He\ncast an arch look at Emmeline; then made to the Lady of the house some\ncompliments so extravagant, that only the weakest vanity could prevent\nher seeing its ridicule. But Fitz-Edward, who found in a moment that\nnothing was too gross to be believed, fearlessly repeated the dose; and\nbefore dinner came in, she was in the best humour imaginable, and\npressed him so earnestly to partake of it, that, after an apology for\nsitting down in his morning dishabille, he consented.\n\nThe same unlimited flattery was continued during dinner by Fitz-Edward,\nand received by the lady with the same avidity; and Emmeline, tho'\nhalf-angry with him for the pleasure he seemed to take in making Mrs.\nAshwood absurd, could not help being amused with the scene.\n\nBefore their repast ended, she was so much charmed with her new\nacquaintance, and so much longed to shew him to her female friends, and\nher other admirers, that she could not forbear pressing him to stay to a\ncard party, which she was to have in the evening.\n\nHe loved the ridiculous; and, influenced by a vanity as silly as that he\ndelighted to expose, he took pleasure in shewing how extremely absurd he\ncould make women appear, who were not on other occasions void of\nunderstanding. Tho' he had really business with Lord Montreville, who\nhad left several messages at his lodgings desiring to see him, and was\ngoing thither when Emmeline met him, yet he accepted Mrs. Ashwood's\ninvitation, on condition of being allowed to go home to dress.\n\nHe was no sooner gone than she flew to her toilet, and Emmeline to a\nsecond perusal of the letter she had received from Augusta Delamere.\n\n\n    'I am forbidden to see you, my dearest Emmeline; and perhaps may\n  not have an opportunity of giving you this. My heart bleeds for\n  you, my sweet friend. I fear my father will be prevailed upon\n  wholly to abandon you. They are all inventing schemes to force you\n  into a marriage with that odd-looking old Rochely. He has been here\n  once or twice, and closetted with my father; and part\n  of the scheme of to-day is, to persuade you to dine here with\n  him. But I am almost sure you will not stay; for unless my mother\n  can command herself more before you than she does when she is\n  talking about you, I think you will be frightened away. I am\n  certain, my dear Emmeline, from what I have heard, tho' they say\n  but little before me, that no endeavours will be omitted to drive\n  you to marry Rochely; and that they will persecute you every way,\n  both by persuasions, and by distressing you. But be assured, that\n  while Augusta Delamere has any thing, you shall share it. Indeed I\n  love you, not only as if you were my sister, but, I think, better.\n  Ah! why are there such unhappy impediments to your being really so?\n  At present I foresee nothing but perplexity; and have no dependance\n  but on you. I know you will act as you ought to do; and that you\n  will at last prevail with Delamere to act right too. Whoever loves\n  you, cannot long persist in doing ill; and surely it is very ill\n  done, and very cruel, for Delamere to make us all so unhappy. I\n  need not tell you to arm yourself with fortitude against the\n  attacks that will be made upon you. You have more fortitude and\n  resolution than I have. Situated as you have been, I know not what\n  _I_ should have done; but I fear it would not have been so worthy\n  of praise as the noble and disinterested part you have acted;\n  which, tho' unaccompanied with the thousand amiable qualities of\n  heart and understanding you possess, would ever command the esteem\n  and admiration of your faithful and affectionate\n\n                                                    AUGUSTA DELAMERE.'\n\n    'Do not write to me till you hear from me again; as I should incur\n  great displeasure if known to correspond with you.\n\n                                                                A. D.'\n\n\nCharmed as Emmeline was by the tender solicitude and affectionate\nsimplicity of her beloved friend, the pleasure this letter gave her was\nvery much abated by learning that the domestic infelicity of Lord\nMontreville's family fell particularly heavy on her. She now recollected\nwhat Mrs. Ashwood had said on her first entrance into the room, when she\nreturned home; and concluded from thence that she had seen Lady\nMontreville, tho' her whole attention was so immediately engrossed by\nthe Colonel, that she had no more named it. She therefore grew anxious\nto hear what had been said; and her own toilet being very soon over, she\nsent to desire admittance to that of Mrs. Ashwood; on receiving which,\nshe attended her, and begged to know whether she had seen Lady\nMontreville, and what had passed?\n\nMrs. Ashwood was in so happy a disposition, that she hesitated not to\noblige her; and while she finished the important business of\naccommodating a pile of black feathers, jet and crape, upon her head,\n'the mockery of woe' which she did not even affect to feel, she gave\nEmmeline the following account, interlarded with directions to her\nwoman.\n\n'Why, my dear, you must know that when I got to Gainsborough's [_more to\nthe left_] he had unluckily a frightful old judge, or a bishop, or some\ntedious old man with him, and I was forced to wait: I cannot tell what\npossessed me, but I entirely forgot that I was to send the chariot back\nfor you. So the chariot [_put it a little forwarder_] staid. I thought\nthe tiresome man, whoever he was, would never have gone; however he went\nat last [_raise the lower curl_] and then I _sot_. You cannot think how\nmuch the likeness is improved! So when I had done [_give me the scraper;\nhere is some powder on my eye-brow_] I went away, thinking to call on\nyou; but as I went by Butler's, I remembered that I wanted some\npearl-coloured twist to finish the purse I am doing for Hanbury. I was\nalmost an hour matching it. Well, then I thought as I was so near\nFrivolit\u00c3\u00a9's door, I might as well call and see whether she had put the\ntrimming on the white bombazeen, as you know we agreed would be most the\nthing. There were a thousand people in the house; you know there is\nnever any possibility of getting out of that creature's room under an\nhour.' [Oh! heaven! thought Emmeline, nor is there any end to the\nimportance you affix to trifles which interest nobody else.] 'So,\nhowever, at last I got to Berkley-square, and stopped at the door. The\nman at the door said you was gone. I thought that very odd, and desired\nanother servant go up and see, for I concluded it was some mistake.\nAfter a moment or two, the footman came down again, and said if I was\nthe Lady Miss Mowbray lived with, his Lady desired I would walk up. Upon\nmy word it is a noble house! When I got into the room, there was Lady\nMontreville and her daughters. Her Ladyship was extremely polite,\nindeed; and after some discourse, \"Mrs. Ashwood,\" said she, \"you know\nMiss Mowbray's situation: I assure you I sent for her to-day with no\nother view in the world but for her own good, and you know, [_dear me!\nhere is a pimple on my chin that is quite hideous; give me a patch._]\nyou know that for her to refuse Mr. Rochely is being absolutely blind to\nher own interest; because you must suppose, Mrs. Ashwood, that she is\nonly deceiving herself when she entertains any thoughts of my son; for\nthat is a thing that never can happen, nor ever shall happen; and\nbesides, to give my Lord and me all this trouble, is a very ungrateful\nreturn to us for having brought her up, and many other obligations she\nhas received at our hands; and will be the ruin of herself; and the\ngreatest perverseness in the world. You, Mrs. Ashwood, are, I hear, a\nvery sensible woman [_where is the rouge box?_] and I dare say, now you\nknow how agreeable it would be to me and my Lord to have Miss Emmeline\ncome to her senses about Mr. Rochely, you will do your endeavours to\npersuade her to act reasonably; and then, tho' she has behaved very\ndisrespectful and very ill, which is only to be forgiven on account of\nher knowing no better, I shall countenance her, and so will my Lord.\"\nThis was, as near as I remember, Emmeline, what my Lady said to me. You\nknow [_the milk of roses is almost out_] you know I could not refuse to\ntell her I would certainly talk to you. I was surprised to find her\nLadyship so obliging and affable, as you had told me she is reckoned so\nvery proud. She ordered her gentleman to give me a ticket for a rout and\na supper her Ladyship gives on Tuesday three weeks; and she said, that\nas she did not doubt but that you would discover your own interest by\nthat time, I should take one for you. Look you, here it is.'\n\n'I shall be in Dorsetshire, I hope, long before Tuesday se'nnight,' said\nEmmeline, laying the card coolly on the toilet. She found Mrs. Ashwood\nhad nothing more material to say; and being apprehensive that she\nimpeded the last finish which her dress and person required, she thanked\nher, and went back into her own room.\n\nThe eagerness and resolution with which Lady Montreville opposed her\nson's marriage, appeared from nothing more evidently, than from her thus\nendeavouring to solicit the assistance of Mrs. Ashwood, and humbling\nherself to use flattery and insinuation towards a person to whom it is\nprobable nothing else could have induced her to speak. With persons in\ntrade, or their connections, or even with gentlemen, unless of very\nancient and honourable families, she seldom deigned to hold any\ncommunication; and if she had occasion to speak to them individually, it\nwas generally under the appellation of 'Mr. or Mrs. I forget the name;'\nfor to remember the particular distinctions of such inferior beings, was\na task too heavy for Right Honourable intellects. When she spoke of such\ncollectively, it was under the denomination of 'the people, or the\nfolks.'\n\nWith that sort of condescension that seems to say, 'I will humble myself\nto your level,' and which is in fact more insolent than the most\noffensive haughtiness, her Ladyship had behaved to Mrs. Ashwood; who\ntook it for extreme politeness, and was charmed on any terms to obtain\nadmission to the house of a woman of such high fashion, and who was\nknown to be so very nice in the choice of her company.\n\nIn return for so much favour, she had been lavish of her assurances that\nshe would influence Miss Mowbray; and came home, fully determined to\ntalk to her sharply; believing too, that to make her feel the present\ndependance and uncertainty of her situation by forcing her to bear a fit\nof ill-humour, might help to determine her to embrace the affluent\nfortune that would set her above it. This it was that occasioned her\nharsh address to Emmeline; which would have been followed by acrimonious\nreflections and rude remonstrances, under the denomination of 'necessary\ntruths and friendly advice,' had not the presence of Fitz-Edward, and\nhis subsequent enchanting conversation, driven all that Lady Montreville\nhad said out of her mind, and left it open only to the delightful\nprospect which his compliments and praises afforded her.\n\nThe company assembled to cards at the usual hour. Rochely was among\nthem; who had not seen Emmeline since the rejection of his proposal,\nwith which Sir Richard Crofts was obliged to acquaint him, tho' he had\nsoftened the peremptory terms in which it had been given. He had this\nevening adorned himself in a superb suit of cut velvet of many colours,\nlined with sables; which tho' not in the very newest mode, had been\nreckoned very magnificent at several city assemblies; and he had put it\non as well in honour of Lord Montreville, with whom he had dined, as in\nhopes of moving the perverse beauty for whom he languished. But so far\nwas this display of clumsy affluence from having any effect on the hard\nheart of Emmeline, that it rather excited her mirth. And when with a\ngrave and solemn aspect he advanced towards her, she felt herself so\nmuch disposed to laugh at his figure, that she was forced to avoid him,\nand took refuge at the table, round which the younger part of the\ncompany assembled to play.\n\nMrs. Ashwood had fixed Fitz-Edward to that where she herself presided;\nand where she sat triumphantly enjoying his high-seasoned flattery;\nwhile her female competitors, hearing he was the son of an Irish Earl,\nand within three of being a Peer himself, contemplated her supposed\nconquest with envy and vexation, which they could not conceal, and which\ngreatly added to her satisfaction.\n\nSeveral persons were invited to stay supper; among whom were Fitz-Edward\nand Rochely. About half an hour before the card-tables broke up, a\nservant brought a note to Emmeline, and told her that it required an\nanswer. The hand was Delamere's.\n\n\n    'For two days I have forborne to see you, Emmeline, and have\n  endeavoured to argue myself into a calmer state of mind; but it\n  avails nothing; hopeless when with you, yet wretched without you, I\n  see no end to my sufferings. I have been about the door all the\n  evening; but find, by the carriages, that you are surrounded by\n  fools and coxcombs. Ah! Emmeline! that time you owe only to me;\n  those smiles to which only I have a right, are lavished on them;\n  and I am left to darkness and despair.\n\n    'There is a door from the garden into the stable-yard, which opens\n  into the fields. As I cannot come to the house (where I find there\n  are people who would inform Lord Montreville that I am still about\n  London,) for pity's sake come down to that door and speak to me. I\n  ask only _one_ moment; surely you will not deny me so small a\n  favour, and add to the anguish which consumes me. I write this from\n  the neighbouring public-house, and wait your answer.\n\n                                                         F. DELAMERE.'\n\n\nEmmeline shuddered at this note. It was more incoherent than usual, and\nseemed to be written with a trembling and uncertain hand. She had left\nthe card-table to read it, and was alone in the anti-room; where, while\nshe hesitated over it, Rochely, whose eyes were ever in search of her,\nfollowed her. She saw him not: but wholly occupied by the purport of the\nnote, he approached close to her unheeded.\n\n'Are you determined, Miss Mowbray,' said he, 'to give me no other answer\nthan you sent somewhat hastily to Lord Montreville, by my friend Sir\nRichard Crofts? May I ask, are you quite determined?'\n\n'Quite, Sir!' replied she, starting, without considering and hardly\nknowing what she said; but feeling he was at that moment more odious to\nher than ever, she snatched away the hand he attempted to take, and flew\nout of the room like a lapwing.\n\nThe dismayed lover shook his head, surveyed his cut velvet in the glass,\nand stroaked his point ruffles, while he was trying to recollect his\nscattered ideas.\n\nEmmeline, who had taken refuge in her bed-chamber, sat there in\nbreathless uncertainty, and unable to determine what to do about\nDelamere. At length, she concluded on desiring Fitz-Edward to go down to\nhim; but knew not how to speak to the colonel on such a subject before\nso many witnesses, nor did she like to send for him out of the room. She\nrung for a candle, and wrote on a slip of paper.\n\n'Delamere is waiting at a door which opens into the fields, and insists\nupon speaking to me. Pray go down to him, and endeavour to prevail on\nhim to return to his father. I can think of no other expedient to\nprevent his engaging in some rash and improper attempt; therefore I\nbeseech you to go down.'\n\nWhen she had written this, she knew not how to deliver it; and for the\nfirst time in her life had recourse to an expedient which bore the\nappearance of art and dissimulation. She did not chuse to send it to\nFitz-Edward by a servant; but went down with it herself; and approaching\nthe table where he was settling his winnings--\n\n'Here, colonel,' said she, 'is the _charade_ you desired me to write out\nfor you.'\n\n'Oh! read it colonel; pray read it;' cried Mrs. Ashwood, 'I doat upon a\n_charade_ of all things in nature.'\n\nHe answered, that 'he would reserve it for a _bon bouche_ after supper.'\nThen looking significantly at Emmeline, to say he understood and would\noblige her, he strolled into the anti-room; Emmeline saying to him, as\nhe passed her, that she would wait his return in the parlour below.\n\nFitz-Edward disappeared; and Emmeline, in hopes of escaping observation,\njoined the party of some young ladies who were playing at a large table,\nand affected to enter into their conversation. But she really knew\nnothing that was passing; and as soon as they rose on finishing their\ngame, she escaped in the bustle, and ran down into the parlour, where in\nfive or six minutes Fitz-Edward found her.\n\nHe wore a look of great concern; and laid down his hat as he came in,\nwithout seeming to know what he did.\n\n'Have you seen Mr. Delamere, Sir?' said Emmeline.\n\n'Seen him!' answered he; 'I have seen him; but to no manner of purpose;\nhis intellects are certainly deranged; he raves like a madman, and\nabsolutely refuses to leave the place till he has spoken to you.'\n\n'Why will he not come in, then?' said Emmeline.\n\n'Because,' said Fitz-Edward, 'Rochely is here, who will relate it to\nthat meddling fellow, Sir Richard Crofts, and by that means it will get\nto his father. I said every thing likely to prevail on him to be more\ncalm; but he will hear nothing. I know not what to do,' continued he,\nrising, and walking about the room. 'I am convinced he has something in\nhis head of fatal consequence to himself. He protests he will stay all\nnight where he is. In short, he is in an absolute frenzy with the idea\nof Rochely's success and his own despair.'\n\n'You frighten me to death,' said Emmeline. 'Tell me, colonel, what ought\nI to do?'\n\n'Go to him,' returned Fitz-Edward; 'speak to him only a moment, and I am\npersuaded he will be calm. I will go with you; and then there can be\nnothing wrong in it.'\n\n'I _will_ go, then,' said she, rising and giving Fitz-Edward her hand,\nwhich trembled extremely.\n\n'But it is very cold,' remarked he: 'had not you better take a cloak?'\n\n'There is my long _pelisse_ in the back parlour,' answered she.\n\nFitz-Edward fetched it, wrapt her in it, and led her down stairs; and by\na garden door, they reached a sort of back stable-yard, where rubbish\nand stable-litter was usually thrown, and which opened into a bye-lane,\nwhere the garden-wall formed a sudden angle. Delamere received her with\ntransport, which he tried to check; and reproached her for refusing to\ncome down to him.\n\nSeizing the opportunity, as soon as he would give her leave to speak,\nshe very forcibly represented to him the distress of his family at his\nabsence, and the particular uneasiness it inflicted on his sister\nAugusta.\n\n'I knew not,' said Delamere, 'that she was come home.'\n\nEmmeline told him she was, and related the purport of her letter, and\nagain besought him to put an end to the uncertainty and anxiety of his\nfamily.\n\nDelamere heard her with some impatience; and holding her hands in his,\nvehemently answered--'It is to no purpose that my father either\nthreatens or persuades me. He has long known my resolution; and the\nunhappiness which you so warmly describe arises solely from his and my\nmother's own unreasonable and capricious prejudice--prejudice founded in\npride and avarice. I do not think myself accountable for distress to\nwhich they may so easily put an end. But as to Augusta, who really loves\nme, I will write to her to make her easy. Now Emmeline, since I have\nlistened to you, and answered all you have to urge, hear my final\ndetermination--_If you_ still continue firm in your chimerical and\nromantic obstinacy, which you call honour, _I_ go from hence this\nevening, never to return--you condemn me to perpetual exile--you give me\nup to despair!'\n\nHe called aloud, and a post-chaise and four, which had been concealed by\nthe projection of the wall, attended by two servants, drove round.\n'There,' continued Delamere, 'there is the vehicle which I have prepared\nto carry me from hence. You know whether I easily relinquish a\nresolution once formed. If then you wish to save my father and mother\nfrom the anguish of repentance when there will be no remedy--if you\ndesire to save from the frenzy of desperation the brother of your\nAugusta, and to snatch from the extremity of wretchedness the man who\nlives but to adore you, go with me--go with me to Scotland!'\n\nAstonished and terrified at the impetuosity with which he pressed this\nunexpected proposal, Emmeline would have replied, but words were a\nmoment wanting. Fitz-Edward taking advantage of her silence, used every\nargument which Delamere had omitted, to determine her.\n\n'No! no!' cried she--'never! never! I have passed my honour to Lord\nMontreville. It is sacred--I cannot, I will not forfeit it!'\n\n'The time will come,' said Fitz-Edward, 'believe me it will, when Lord\nMontreville will not only be reconciled to you, but'----\n\n'And what shall reconcile me to myself? Let me go back to the house, Mr.\nDelamere; or from this moment I shall consider you as having taken\nadvantage of my unprotected state, and even of my indiscreet confidence,\nto offer me the grossest outrage. Let me go, Sir!' (struggling to get\nher hand from Fitz-Edward) 'Let me go! Mr. Delamere.'\n\n'What! to be driven into the arms of Rochely? No, never, Emmeline!\nnever! I _know_ I am _not_ indifferent to you. I feel that I cannot live\nwithout you; nay, by heaven I will not! But if I suffer this opportunity\nto escape, I deserve indeed to lose you.'\n\nThey all this while approached the chaise. Delamere had hired servants,\nwhom he had instructed what to do. They were ready at the door of the\ncarriage. Emmeline attempted in vain to retreat. Delamere threw his arms\naround her; and assisted by Fitz-Edward, lifted her into it with a sort\nof gentle violence. He leaped in after her, and the chaise was driven\naway instantly.\n\nFitz-Edward, to whom this scene was wholly unexpected, returned to the\ncompany he had left with Mrs. Ashwood. He had not any notion of\nDelamere's design when he went to him, but heartily concurred in its\nexecution; and tho' he did not believe Delamere intended to marry\nEmmeline, yet his morals were such, that he congratulated himself on the\nshare he had had in putting her into his power, and went back with the\nair of a man vastly satisfied with the success of his exploit.\n\n'Goodness! colonel,' exclaimed Mrs. Ashwood, 'supper has been waiting\nfor you this half hour. Upon my word we began to suspect that you and\nMiss Mowbray were gone together. But pray where is she?'\n\n'Miss Mowbray, Madam! I really have not been so happy as to be of her\nparty.'\n\n'Why, where in the world can she be?' continued Mrs. Ashwood. 'However,\nas the colonel is come we will go to supper. [_The company were standing\nround the table._] I suppose Miss Mowbray will come presently; she has a\npretty romantic notion of contemplation by moonlight.'\n\nSupper, however, was almost over, and Miss Mowbray did not appear. Mrs.\nAshwood, engaged wholly by the gallant colonel, thought not of her; but\nRochely remarked that her absence was somewhat singular.\n\n'So it is I declare,' said Miss Galton; 'do Mrs. Ashwood send and\nenquire for her again.'\n\nThe chambers, the drawing-room, dressing-room, closets, and garden were\nagain searched. Miss Mowbray was not to be found! Mrs. Ashwood was\nalarmed--Rochely in dismay--and the whole company confusedly broke up;\neach retiring with their several conjectures on the sudden disappearance\nof the fair Emmeline.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nFor some moments after Emmeline found herself in the chaise,\nastonishment and terror deprived her of speech and even of recollection.\nWhile Delamere, no longer able to command his transports at having at\nlength as he hoped secured her, gave way to the wildest joy, and\ncongratulated himself that he had thus forced her to break a promise\nwhich only injustice he said could have extorted, and only timidity and\nill-grounded prejudice have induced her to keep.\n\n'Do you then hope, Sir,' said Emmeline, 'that I shall patiently become\nthe victim of your rashness? Is this the respect you have sworn ever to\nobserve towards me? Is this the protection you have so often told me I\nshould find from you? And is it thus you intend to atone for all the\ninsults of your family which you have so repeatedly protested you would\nnever forgive? by inflicting a far greater insult; by ruining my\ncharacter; by degrading me in my own eyes; and forcing me either to\nviolate my word solemnly given to your father, or be looked upon as a\nlost and abandoned creature, undone by your inhuman art. I must now,\nindeed, seem to _deserve_ your mother's anger, and the scorn of your\nsister; and must be supposed every way wretched and contemptible.'\n\nA shower of tears fell from her eyes, and her heart seemed bursting with\nthe pain these cruel reflections gave her.\n\nDelamere, by all the soothing tenderness of persuasion, by all the\nrhetoric of ardent passion, tried to subdue her anger, and silence her\nscruples; but the more her mind dwelt on the circumstances of her\nsituation, the more it recoiled from the necessity of entering under\nsuch compulsion into an indissoluble engagement. The rash violence of\nthe measure which had put her in Delamere's power, while it convinced\nher of his passion, yet told her, that a man who would hazard every\nthing for his own gratification now, would hardly hereafter submit to\nany restraint; and that the bonds in which he was so eager to engage,\nwould with equal violence be broken, when any new face should make a\nnew impression, or when time had diminished the influence of those\nattractions that now enchanted him.\n\nFormed of the softer elements, and with a mind calculated for select\nfriendship and domestic felicity, rather than for the tumult of\nfashionable life and the parade of titled magnificence, Emmeline coveted\nnot his rank, nor valued his riches. No woman perhaps can help having\nsome regard for a man, who she knows ardently and sincerely loves her;\nand Emmeline had felt all that sort of weakness for Delamere; who in the\nbloom of life, with fortune, title, person and talents that might have\ncommanded the loveliest and most affluent daughter of prosperity, had\nforsaken every thing for her, and even secluded himself from the\ncompanions of his former pleasures, and the indulgences his fortune and\nrank afforded him, to pass his youth in unsuccessful endeavours to\nobtain her.\n\nThe partiality this consideration gave her towards him, and the\nfavourable comparison she was perpetually making between him and the men\nshe had seen since her residence near London, had created in her bosom a\nsentiment warmer perhaps than friendship; yet it was not that violent\nlove, which carrying every thing before it, leaves the mind no longer at\nliberty to see any fault in the beloved object, or any impropriety in\nwhatever can secure it's success, and which, scorning future\nconsequences, risks every thing for it's present indulgence.\n\nStill artless and ingenuous as when she first left the remote castle\nwhere she had been brought up, Emmeline had not been able to conceal\nthis affection from Delamere. Her eyes, her manner, the circumstance of\nthe picture, and a thousand nameless inadvertences, had told it him\nrepeatedly; but now, when he seemed to have taken an ungenerous\nadvantage of that regard, it lost much of it's force, and resentment and\ndisdain succeeded.\n\nDelamere tried to appease her by protestations of inviolable respect, of\neternal esteem, and unalterable love. But there was something of triumph\neven in his humblest entreaties, that served but to encrease the anger\nEmmeline felt; and she told him that the only way to convince her he had\nfor her those sentiments he pretended, was to carry her back immediately\nto Mrs. Ashwood's, or rather to Lord Montreville, there to acknowledge\nthe attempt he had made, and that it's failure had been solely owing to\nher determined adherence to her word.\n\nDelamere, presuming on his ascendancy over her, attempted to interest\nher passions rather than tranquillize her reason. He represented to her\nhow great would be her triumph when he presented her as his wife to the\nimperious Lady Montreville, who had treated her with so much unmerited\nscorn, and set her above the haughty Fanny Delamere, who had insulted\nher with fancied superiority.\n\nBut Emmeline had in her breast none of those passions that find their\ngratification in humbling an enemy. Too generous for revenge; too gentle\nfor premeditated resentment; she saw these circumstances in a very\ndifferent light, and felt that she should be rather mortified than\nelated by being forced into a family who wished to reject her.\n\nSir Richard Crofts, the object of Delamere's hatred and detestation, was\nthe subject of those acrimonious reflections that his respect for his\nfather and mother prevented his throwing on them. The influence of this\nman had, he said, made Lord Montreville deaf to the voice of nature, and\nforgetful of his own honour; while he was plunged into the dark and\ndiscreditable labyrinth of political intrigue, and acquired an habit of\nsubterfuge and duplicity unworthy a nobleman, a gentleman, or a man.\n\nEmmeline cared nothing about Sir Richard Crofts, and could not enter\ninto the bitterness of his resentment towards him. Nothing he had yet\nbeen able to urge had shaken her resolution not to become his wife, even\ntho' he should oblige her to go with him into Scotland.\n\nThe ruder passions of anger and resentment had no influence over her\nmind. While he argued with warmth, or ran into reproaches, Emmeline\nfound she had nothing to fear. But tho' he could not rouse her pride, or\nawaken her dislike against his family, but rather found them recoil on\nhimself; he hoped in that sensibility of temper and that softness of\nheart to which he owed all the attention she had ever shewn him, he\nshould find a sure resource. In her pity, an advocate for his fault--in\nher love, an inducement not only to forgive but to reward him.\n\nAnd when he pleaded for compassion and forgiveness, the heart of\nEmmeline felt itself no longer invulnerable. But against this dangerous\nattack she endeavoured to fortify that sensible heart, by considering\nthe probable event of her yielding to it.\n\n'If I marry Delamere contrary to the consent of his family, who shall\nassure me that his violent and haughty spirit will bear without anguish\nand regret, that inferior and confined fortune to which his father's\ndispleasure will condemn him? His love, too ardent perhaps to last, will\ndecline; while the inconveniences of a narrow fortune will encrease; and\nI, who shall be the cause of these inconveniences, shall also be the\nvictim. He will lament the infatuation which has estranged him from his\nfamily, and thrown him, for some years at least, out of the rank in\nwhich he has been used to appear; and recovered from the delirium of\nlove, will behold with coldness, perhaps with hatred, her to whom he\nwill impute his distresses. To whom can I then appeal? Not to my _own_\nheart, for it will condemn me for suffering myself to be precipitated\ninto a measure against my judgment; nor to _his_ family, who may answer,\n\"thy folly be upon thine own head;\" and _I_ have _no_ father, _no_\nbrother to console and receive me, if he should drive me from him as\nimpetuously as now he would force me to be his. I shall be deprived even\nof the melancholy consolation of knowing I have not _deserved_ the\nneglect which I fear I shall never be able to _bear_. But if my steady\nrefusal now, induces him to return, it is possible that Lord\nMontreville, convinced at once of my adherence to the promise given him,\nand of the improbability of Delamere's desisting, may consent to receive\nme into his family; or if the inveterate prejudice of his wife still\nprevents his doing so, I shall surely regain his confidence and esteem.\nHe will not refuse to consider me as his brother's daughter, and as\nsuch, he will enable me to pass my days in easy competence with Mrs.\nStafford; a prospect infinitely preferable in my eyes to the splendid\nvisions offered me by Delamere, if they cannot be realized but at the\nexpence of truth and integrity.'\n\nConfirmed in her determination by reflections like these, Emmeline was\nable to hear, without betraying any symptoms of the emotion she felt,\nthe animated and passionate protestations of her lover. She assumed all\nthe coldness and reserve which his headlong and inconsiderate attempt\ndeserved. She told him that his want of respect and consideration had\nforfeited all the claim he might otherwise have had to her regard and\nesteem; that she certainly would quit him the moment she was able; and\nthat tho' she might not be fortunate enough to do so before they reached\nScotland, yet it would not be in his power to compel her to be his wife.\n\nDelamere for some time imputed this language to sudden resentment; and\nagain by the humblest submissions sought to obtain her forgiveness and\nto excite her pity. But having nearly exhausted her spirits by what she\nhad already said, she gave very little reply to his entreaties. Her\nsilence was however more expressive than her words. She took from him\nher hand, as often as he attempted to hold it, and would not suffer him\nto wipe away the tears that fell from her eyes; while to his arguments\nand persuasions she coldly answered, when she answered at all, '_that\nshe was determined_:' and they arrived at Barnet before he had obtained\nthe smallest concession in his favour.\n\nDelamere had undertaken this enterprize rather in despair, than from any\nhope of it's success, since he did not believe Emmeline would come out\nto him when he requested it; and had she been either alone, or only with\nMrs. Ashwood, she certainly had not done it. Chance had befriended him\nin collecting a room full of company, and still more in sending Rochely\namong them. His abrupt approach while she read Delamere's note, had\nhurried her out of her usual presence of mind; and Fitz-Edward, whom\nmere accident had brought to Mrs. Ashwood's house, and whom she had\ntaken with her in hopes of his influencing Delamere to return to his\nfather, had contributed to her involuntary error.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nDelamere had taken no precaution to secure horses on the road; and it\nwas not till after waiting some hours that he procured four from Barnet.\nWhen they arrived there, it was past one o'clock; and Emmeline, who had\ngone thro' a very fatigueing day, and was now overcome with the terror\nand alarm of being thus hastily snatched away, could hardly sit up. She\nwas without an hat; and having no change of cloaths, urged the\ninconvenience she must endure by being forced to go a long journey so\nsituated. She wished to have stopped at the first stage; but Delamere\nthought, that in her present temper to hesitate was to lose her. He\nconsented however to go for a moment into the house, where, while he\ngave a servant orders to go on to Hatfield to bespeak four horses, she\ndrank a glass of water; and then Delamere intreating her to return to\nthe chaise, she complied, for there was nobody visible at the inn but\nthe maid and ostler; and she saw no likelihood of any assistance, had\nshe applied for it.\n\nThey hastened with great expedition to Stevenage; but before they\nreached that place, Emmeline, who had ceased either to remonstrate or\ncomplain, was so entirely overwhelmed and exhausted, that she could no\nlonger support herself.\n\nHis fears for her health now exceeded his fears for losing her, and he\ndetermined to stop for some hours; but when she made an effort to leave\nthe chaise she was unable, and he was obliged to lift her out of it. He\nthen ordered the female servants to be called up, recommended her to\ntheir care, and entreated her to go to bed for some hours.\n\nLong darkness and excessive weeping had almost deprived her of sight;\nher whole frame was sinking under the fatigue she had undergone both of\nbody and mind; and unable to struggle longer against it, she lay down in\nher cloaths, desiring one of the maids to sit by her.\n\nDelamere came to the door of the room to enquire how she did. The woman\ntold him what she had requested; and desiring they would obey her in\nevery thing, and keep her as quiet as possible, he went not to repose\nhimself, but to write to Fitz-Edward.\n\n\n  'Dear George,\n\n    'While my angelic Emmeline sleeps, I, who am too happy to sleep\n  myself, write to desire you will go to Berkley-square and keep the\n  good folks there from exposing themselves, or making a great bustle\n  about what has happened, which they will soon know. As my Lord has\n  long been prepossessed with the idea of a Scottish jaunt, it is very\n  likely he may attempt to pursue us. Say what you will to put such\n  plans out of his head. I shall be in London again, in a very short\n  time. Farewell, dear George.\n\n                                                        Your's, ever,\n                                                                 F. D.'\n\n\nEmmeline in the mean time fell into a sleep, but it was broken and\ninterrupted. Her spirits had been so thoroughly discomposed, that rest\nwas driven from her. She dozed a moment; then suddenly started up,\nforgot where she was, and looked wildly round the room. An half-formed\nrecollection of the events of the preceding day then seemed to recur,\nand she besought the maid who sat by her to go to Mr. Delamere and tell\nhim she must be directly carried to Mrs. Stafford's; and having said\nthis, and sighed deeply, she sunk again into short insensibility.\n\nThus past the remainder of the night; and before seven in the morning\nDelamere was at the door, impatient to know how she had rested.\n\nThe maid admitted him, and told him, in a low voice, that the Lady was\nin a quieter sleep than she had been the whole night. He softly\napproached the bed, and started in terror when he saw how ill she\nlooked. Her cheek, robbed of it's bloom, rested on her arm, which\nappeared more bloodless than her cheek; her hair, which had been dressed\nwithout powder, had escaped from the form in which it had been adjusted,\nand half concealed her face in disordered luxuriance; her lips were\npale, and her respiration short and laborious. He stood gazing on her a\nmoment, and then, shocked at these symptoms of indisposition, his rapid\nimagination immediately magnified them all. He concluded she was dying;\nand in an agony of fear, which deprived him of every other idea, he took\nup in breathless apprehension her other hand, which lay on the quilt. It\nwas hot, and dry; and her pulse seemed rather to flutter, than to beat\nagainst his pressure.\n\nHis moving her hand awakened her. She opened her eyes; but they had lost\ntheir lustre, and were turned mournfully towards him.\n\n'Delamere,' said she, in a low and tremulous voice, 'Delamere, why is\nall this? I believe you have destroyed me; my head is so extremely\npainful. Oh! Delamere--this is cruel!--very cruel!'\n\n'Let me go for advice,' cried he, eagerly. 'Wretch that I am, what will\nnow become of me!'\n\nHe ran down stairs; and Emmeline making an effort to recover her\nrecollection, tried to sit up; but her head was so giddy and confused\nthat it was not till after several attempts she left the bed, even with\nthe assistance of the servant. She then drank a glass of water; and\ndesiring to have more air, would have gone to the window, but could only\nreach a chair near it, where she sat down, and throwing her arm on a\ntable, rested her head upon it.\n\nIn a few moments Delamere returned up stairs. His wild looks, and quick,\nhalf-formed questions, explained what passed in his mind.\n\nShe told him faintly she was better.\n\n'Shall I bring up a gentleman to see you who I am assured is able in his\nprofession? I fear you are very ill.'\n\nShe answered, 'no!'\n\n'Pray suffer him to come; he will give you something to relieve your\nhead.'\n\n'No!'\n\n'Do not, Emmeline--do not, I conjure you, refuse me this favour?'\n\nHe took her hand; but when he found how feverish she was, he started\naway, crying--'Oh! let him, let him come!'\n\nHe ran down stairs to fetch him, and returned instantly with the\napothecary; a sensible, well-behaved man, of fifty, whose appearance\nindicated feeling and judgement. He approached Emmeline, who still sat\nwith her head reclined on the table, and felt her pulse.\n\n'Here is too much fever indeed, Sir,' said he; 'the young lady has been\ngreatly hurried.'\n\n'But what--what is to be done, Sir?' said Delamere, eagerly interrupting\nhim.\n\n'Quiet seems absolutely necessary. Pardon me, Sir; but unless I know\nyour situation in regard to her, I cannot possibly advise.'\n\n'Sir,' said Emmeline, who had been silent rather from inability to\ncontend than from unconsciousness of what was passing round her--'if you\ncould prevail with Mr. Delamere to restore me to my friends'--\n\n'Come with me, Sir,' cried Delamere; 'let me speak to you in another\nroom.'\n\nWhen they were alone, he conjured Mr. Lawson to tell him what he thought\nof the lady?\n\n'Upon my word, Sir, she is in a very high fever, and it seems to be\noccasioned by extreme perturbation of spirits and great fatigue.\nForgive, Sir, if I ask what particular circumstance has been the cause\nof the uneasiness under which she appears to labour? If it is any little\nlove quarrel you cannot too soon adjust it.'\n\nDelamere stopped his conjectures, by telling him who he was; and gave\nhim in a few words the history of their expedition.\n\nMr. Lawson protested to him that if she was hurried on in her present\nstate, it would be surprising if she survived the journey.\n\n'She shall stay here then,' replied Delamere, 'till she recovers her\nfatigue.'\n\n'But, Sir,' enquired Mr. Lawson, 'after what you have told me of your\nfather, have you no apprehension of a pursuit?'\n\nHis terror at Emmeline's immediate danger had obliterated for a moment\nevery other fear. It now recurred with redoubled violence. He remembered\nthat Rochely was at Mrs. Ashwood's on the evening of Emmeline's\ndeparture; and he knew that from him Sir Richard Crofts, and\nconsequently Lord Montreville, would have immediate intelligence.\n\nHe struck his hands together, exclaiming, 'She will be every way\nlost!--lost irretrievably! If my father overtakes us, she will return\nwith him, and I shall see her no more!'\n\nHe now gave way to such unbounded passion, walking about the room, and\nstriking his forehead, that Lawson began to believe his intellects were\nas much deranged as the frame of the fair sufferer he had left. For some\nmoments he attended to nothing; but Mr. Lawson, accustomed to make\nallowances for the diseases of the mind as well as those of the body,\ndid not lose his patience; and at length persuaded him to be calmer, by\nrepresenting that he wasted in fruitless exclamation the time which\nmight be employed in providing against the apprehended evil.\n\n'Good God! Sir,' cried he at length, 'what would you have me do?'\n\n'What I would earnestly recommend, Sir, is, that you quiet the young\nlady's mind by telling her you will carry her whither she desires to go;\nand at present desist from this journey, which I really believe you\ncannot prosecute but at the hazard of her life; at present, farther\nagitation may, and probably will be fatal.'\n\n'And so you advise me to let her stay till my father comes to tear her\nfrom me for ever! or carry her back by the same road, where it is\nprobable he will meet me? Impossible! impossible!--but is she really so\nvery ill?'\n\n'Upon my life she is at this moment in a high fever. Why should I\ndeceive you? Trust me, it would in my opinion be the height of\ninhumanity to carry her into Scotland in such a situation, _if_ you love\nher'----\n\n'_If_ I love her, Sir!' cried Delamere, half frantic--'talk not of _if_\nI love her! Merciful heaven!--you have no idea, Mr. Lawson, of what I\nsuffer at this moment!'\n\n'I have a perfect idea of your distress, Sir; and wish I knew how to\nrelieve it. Give me a moment's time to consider; if indeed the young\nlady could'--\n\n'What, Sir? speak!--think of something!'\n\n'Why I was thinking, that if she is better in a few hours, it might be\npossible for you to take her to Hertford, where she may remain a day or\ntwo, till she is able to go farther. There you would be no longer in\ndanger of pursuit; and if she should grow worse, which when her mind is\neasier I hope will not happen, you will have excellent advice. Perhaps,\nwhen the hurry of her spirits subsides, she may, since this _has_\nhappened, consent to pursue the journey to the North; or if not, you can\nfrom thence carry her to the friends she is so desirous of being with,\nand avoid the risk of meeting on the road those you are so anxious to\nshun.'\n\nTho' Delamere could not think, without extreme reluctance, of\nrelinquishing a scheme in which he had thought himself secure of\nsuccess; yet, as there was no alternative but what would be so hazardous\nto the health of Emmeline, he was compelled to accede to any which had a\nprobability of restoring it without putting her into the hands of his\nfather.\n\nMr. Lawson told him it was only fifteen miles from Stevenage to\nHertford--'But how,' said he, 'will you, Sir, prevent your father's\nfollowing you thither, if he should learn at this place that you are\ngone there?'\n\nDelamere was wholly at a loss. But Mr. Lawson, who seemed to be sent by\nhis good genius, said--'We must get you from hence immediately, if Miss\nMowbray is able to go. You shall pass here as my visitors. You shall\ndirectly go to my house, and there be supplied with horses from another\ninn. This will at least make it more difficult to trace your route; and\nif any enquiry should be made of me, I shall know what to say.'\n\nDelamere, catching at any thing that promised to secure Emmeline from\nthe pursuit of Lord Montreville, went to her to enquire whether she was\nwell enough to walk to Mr. Lawson's house.\n\nHe found her trying to adjust her hair; but her hands trembled so much,\nit was with difficulty she could do it. He desired her to dismiss the\nmaid who was in the room; then throwing himself on his knees before her,\nand taking her burning hands in his, he said--'Arbitress of my\ndestiny--my Emmeline! thou for whom only I exist! be tranquil--I beseech\nyou be tranquil! Since you determine to abide by your cruel resolution,\nI will not, I dare not persist in asking you to break it. No, Emmeline!\nI come only to entreat that you would quiet your too delicate mind; and\ndispose of _me_ as you please. Since you cannot resolve to be mine now,\nI will learn to submit--I will try to bear any thing but the seeing you\nunhappy, or losing you entirely! Tell me only that you pardon what is\npast, and you shall go to Mrs. Stafford's, or whithersoever you will.'\n\nEmmeline beheld and heard him with astonishment. But at length\ncomprehending that he repented of his wild attempt, and would go back,\nshe said hastily, as she arose from her chair--'Let us go, then,\nDelamere; let us instantly go. Thank God, your heart is changed! but\nevery hour I continue with you, is an additional wound to my character\nand my peace.'\n\nShe attempted to reach her cloak, but could not; her strength forsook\nher; her head became more giddy; she staggered, and would have fallen,\nhad not Delamere caught her in his arms, and supported her to the chair\nshe had left.\n\n'Hurry not yourself thus, my Emmeline,' cried he; 'in mercy to me try to\ncompose yourself, and spare me the sight of all this terror, for which\nbelieve me you have no reason.'\n\nHe sat down by her; and drawing her gently towards him, her languid head\nreposed on his shoulder, and he contemplated, in silent anguish, the\nravage which only a few hours severe anxiety had made on that beauteous\nand expressive countenance.\n\nHe called to the maid, who waited in the next room, and desired her to\nsend up Mr. Lawson; before whose entrance a shower of tears, the first\nshe had shed for some hours, a little relieved the full heart of\nEmmeline.\n\nMr. Lawson desired Delamere would not check her tears; and in a friendly\nand consolatory manner told her what Delamere proposed to do. Emmeline,\nafter this explanation, was still more anxious to depart; but Mr. Lawson\ngreatly doubted whether she was able.\n\n'I can walk, indeed I can,' said she, 'if you will each lend me an arm.'\n\nMr. Lawson then gave her a few drops in a glass of water, which seemed\nto revive her; and Delamere wrapping her carefully in her cloak, they\nled her between them to a neat brick house in the town, where Mrs.\nLawson, a matron-like and well-behaved woman, and her daughter, a\ngenteel girl of twenty, who had been apprized of Emmeline's situation,\nreceived her with great kindness and respect.\n\nBreakfast was prepared for her, but she could eat nothing. The heaviness\nof her eyes, her pallid countenance, and the tenseness across her\ntemples, seemed to threaten the most alarming consequences. Mrs. Lawson\nendeavoured to persuade her to go to bed; but her eagerness to be gone\nfrom thence was so great, that she evidently encreased the difficulty by\nendeavouring to surmount it. She had indeed considered, that if Lord\nMontreville overtook them, which was not only possible but probable, all\nthe merit of her conduct would be lost.--She would appear to be carried\nback, not by her strict adherence to her promise, but by the authority\nof his Lordship; and instead of the pride and credit of a laudable and\nvirtuous action, would be liable to bear all the imputation of\nintentional guilt. This reflection, added to the sense she could not\nfail to have of her improper situation in being so long alone with\nDelamere under the appearance of having voluntarily gone off with him,\nmade her so impatient to be gone, that she declined any repose however\nnecessary; and Mr. Lawson thought there was less to be feared from\nindulging than from opposing her.\n\nLawson therefore went himself to hasten the horses; and while he was\nabsent, Emmeline, who remained with his wife, expressed so much fear\nthat Delamere might alter his intentions of returning, and so much\nuneasiness at the thoughts of being seen at another inn, in the\ndisordered dress she now wore, with a young man of Delamere's\nappearance, that Mrs. Lawson was truly concerned for her, and\ncommunicated to Delamere the source of the extreme anxiety she appeared\nto suffer.\n\nHe came to her; and she gently reproached him for all the inconvenience\nand uneasiness he had brought upon her. Her soft complaints, and the\ndistress pictured on her speaking face, he felt with a degree of anguish\nand self-reproach that made him happy to agree to a plan proposed by\nMrs. Lawson, which was, that she should be accommodated with cloaths of\nMiss Lawson's, and that Miss Lawson herself should accompany her to\nHertford.\n\nThis latter offer, Emmeline eagerly accepted; and Delamere, who saw how\nmuch it soothed and relieved her, did not object to it. She was\ntherefore immediately equipped with a morning dress, and her agitation\nof mind seemed to subside; but changing her cloaths, trifling as the\nexertion was, fatigued her so much, that Mr. Lawson on his return looked\nvery grave; and Delamere, who watched his looks as if his existence\ndepended upon his opinion, was wild with apprehension. The chaises (for\nDelamere had ordered one for himself, that the ladies might suffer no\ninconvenience by being crouded) were ready, and Lawson recollecting that\nEmmeline would require a more quiet situation than an inn could afford,\ntold her that he had a sister at Hertford who would receive her with\npleasure, and accommodate her at her house as long as she would\nstay--'And remember,' added he, 'that Lissy is to continue with you till\nyou leave Hertford.'\n\nEmmeline, extremely sensible of all she owed to this excellent man,\ncould only sigh her thanks; and to shorten them, Mr. Lawson put her and\nhis daughter into the travelling chaise which Delamere had bought for\nthis expedition. Delamere followed in another; and between one and two\no'clock they arrived at Hertford, and were set down at the door of an\nelegant house; where Mrs. Champness, the wife of a man of fortune,\nreceived her niece with great affection; and having heard in another\nroom the history of the young lady she had with her, immediately gave\norders to have a bed-chamber prepared, and shewed the utmost solicitude\nfor her accommodation.\n\nDelamere, seeing her so well situated for the night, and happy to find\nshe bore her short journey with less increase of fatigue than he\napprehended, consented at her request to leave her, and went to the inn,\nwhere he dined, and soon afterwards returned to enquire after her.\n\nMiss Lawson came down to him, and told him Miss Mowbray was in bed, and\nhad taken a medicine Mr. Lawson had sent to compose her; but that it was\nyet impossible to say much of her situation. She told him he must by no\nmeans attempt to see her for the remaining part of the day, and begged\nhe would himself try to take some repose: to which salutary advice\nDelamere at length consented; his haggard looks and exhausted spirits\nsufficiently testifying how much he wanted it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nThe evening on which Emmeline had been so suddenly missing from the\nhouse of Mrs. Ashwood, Rochely had left it in as much anguish as his\nnature was capable of feeling.\n\nHe had not for many years so seriously thought of matrimony as since he\nhad seen Miss Mowbray. Her beauty first attracted him: the natural\ncivility of her manner was by him, who had frequently met only contempt\nand derision from the young and beautiful, construed into encouragement;\nand though his hopes had been greatly damped by his knowledge of\nDelamere's attachment to her, yet they were almost as quickly revived by\nthe great encouragement to persevere, which he had received from Lord\nMontreville. He fancied that the barriers between her and Delamere being\ninsurmountable, she could not fail of being dazzled by so splendid a\nfortune as he could himself offer her. That evening, she looked more\nthan usually lovely, and he determined with new ardour to pursue her.\nBut her disappearance put an end to all his brilliant visions; and\nconvinced him that his wealth, on which he had so long been accustomed\nto value himself, had failed of procuring him the favour of the only\nwoman with whom he was disposed to share it. He was too well convinced\nthat Delamere had carried her off: and though deprived of all hope for\nhimself, he was too angry at the good fortune of his rival to forbear an\nattempt to disturb him in it's possession. He drove therefore from\nClapham to the house of Sir Richard Crofts, where he had the\nmortification of hearing that Sir Richard was gone with Lord Montreville\nto the country house of Lord Dornock, and was not expected to return\n'till the next day.\n\nRochely, aware that the only possible chance of preventing Delamere's\nmarriage was by an immediate pursuit, was greatly chagrined at this\nunavoidable delay. He sat down, however, and with his usual laboured\nprecision wrote to Sir Richard Crofts, informing him of what had\nhappened. This was the operation of near an hour; and he then sent off a\nman on horseback with it, who arriving at Lord Dornock's about three in\nthe morning, roused the family with some difficulty, and delivered to\nSir Richard the intelligence, which was immediately conveyed to Lord\nMontreville; who having read Mr. Rochely's letter, could not flatter\nhimself with any hope that this alarm might be as groundless as one he\nhad before had on the same subject.\n\nThe disobedience of his son; the broken faith of Emmeline; and the rage,\ncomplaints, and reproaches of Lady Montreville, all arose together in\nhis imagination; and anger, vexation, and regret, took possession of his\nheart.\n\nHe had recourse in this, as in all other emergences, to Sir Richard\nCrofts, who advised him immediately to pursue them.\n\nAs soon therefore as the sleeping servants could be collected, and the\ncarriage prepared, his Lordship and Sir Richard set out for London\ntogether.--Lord Montreville determining to follow the fugitives as\nexpeditiously as possible, though he hoped but little success from the\npursuit.\n\nSuch was his apprehension of the clamours and passions of his wife, that\nhe could not determine to see her 'till he had at least done all that\nwas possible to recover her son. He therefore wrote to her a short\nletter, stating briefly what had happened, and giving her hopes that he\nshould be able to overtake the parties before they were married. This he\nordered to be delivered to her in the morning; and directed his servant\nto hasten to him with his travelling chaise and four post horses.\n\nThe man, however, who had the care of the carriages, believing his Lord\nwould stay out all night, had gone out also, and taken with him the\nkeys.\n\nBy this delay, and the blunders of the affrighted servants, who in their\nhaste only impeded each other, it was near nine o'clock before his\nLordship and Sir Richard left London. At Barnet, they heard of the\nfugitives, and easily traced them from thence to Hatfield; after which\nbelieving all farther enquiries useless, they passed through Stevenage\n(having sent on before for horses,) without asking any questions which\nmight have led them to discover that Delamere and Emmeline had gone from\nthence towards Hertford only an hour and an half before their arrival.\n\nThis was fortunate for the pursued; for an enquiry would probably have\nled to questions which Mr. Lawson would have found it very difficult to\nevade.\n\nLord Montreville, however, and Sir Richard, hurried on to Buckden; where\nbeing obliged to get out for some refreshment for themselves and their\nservants, his Lordship renewed the question--'At what time did a young\ngentleman and lady' (describing Delamere and Emmeline) 'pass by?'\n\nThe people told him they remembered no such persons about the time he\nnamed.\n\nLord Montreville then applied at the other houses, and made several\nother enquiries; but received only a general assertion that no such\npersons had been that way within the last four and twenty hours, or even\nwithin a week.\n\nSir Richard Crofts, who piqued himself upon his sagacity, told his\nLordship that stupidity, the love of falsehood, or Delamere's bribes,\nmight occasion this failure of intelligence; but there could be no doubt\nof their being gratified with better information when they got to\nStilton. To Stilton therefore they went, but heard exactly the same\nanswers as they had done at the last stage.\n\nSir Richard was now again to seek for some plausible conjecture that\nmight quiet the apprehensive anxiety of Lord Montreville, who guessed\nand dreaded he knew not what.\n\nHe now said, that as there could be no doubt of the young people's\nhaving gone _towards_ Scotland, from the information they had obtained\nat Barnet and Hatfield, it was most likely that in the apprehension of a\npursuit they had afterwards quitted the high road, and were advancing to\nthe borders of Scotland across the country, which must considerably\nlengthen and impede their journey; therefore if they themselves\nproceeded directly to the town where these marriages are usually\ncelebrated, the probability was that they should arrive before Delamere\nand Miss Mowbray; and by such a circumstance the connection would be as\neffectually prevented as it could be by their overtaking them on the\nroad.\n\nLord Montreville, despairing of being able by any means to obstruct a\nmarriage on which his son seemed to be so determined, and harrassed in\nmind as much as he was fatigued in body, suffered himself to be carried\nforward merely through inability to determine what he could do better;\nand though quite hopeless of it's success, pursued his journey.\n\nThe innocent cause of all this trouble and anxiety remained in the mean\ntime at the hospitable house of Mrs. Champness; where Miss Lawson\nattended her with all possible kindness and solicitude. It was indeed\nimpossible to be with her without loving her; unless to an heart\ninsensible, like that of Mrs. Ashwood, to all but her own ideal\nperfections; or steeled by pride, like that of Lady Montreville.\n\nA night passed in quiet sleep had greatly restored her; and her fever,\nthough not gone, was considerably abated. Every noise, however trifling,\nstill made her start; her nerves were by no means restored to their\ntone, and her spirits continued to be greatly affected. The idea which\nseemed to press most painfully on her mind, was the blemish which the\npurity of her character must sustain by her being so long absent with\nDelamere--a blemish which she knew could hardly ever be removed but by\nher returning as his wife.\n\nBut to break her promise to Lord Montreville; a promise so solemnly\ngiven; and to be compelled into a marriage which, however advantageous\nand fortunate it would appear under other circumstances, would now bring\nwith it a severe alloy of mortification in the displeasure of his\nfamily; was a measure which she could not determine to pursue.\n\nHer resentment towards Delamere for what was passed was not yet enough\nsubdued by his reluctant repentance, to reconcile her to the thoughts of\nputting herself again into his power. Yet she could not suppose he would\nsuffer her to return to London alone, if she had courage to attempt it;\nor was she sure that when there, Mrs. Ashwood would receive her.\n\nThese reflections made her so restless and uneasy that she could not\nconceal their source from Miss Lawson; who, tho' possessed of a very\ngood understanding, was too young and too little acquainted with the\nworld to be able to advise her.\n\nThe handsome person and high rank of Delamere, and his violent love and\nconcern for Emmeline, made her suppose it impossible that she could help\nreturning it, or be long able to resist his importunity. She concluded\ntherefore that finally it would be a match; and was impressed with a\nsentiment that amounted almost to veneration for Miss Mowbray, whom she\nconsidered as a prodigy of female virtue and resolution.\n\nDelamere had been several times to speak to Miss Lawson; and he had\npleaded the violence of his passion with so much effect, that the\nsoft-hearted girl became his warm advocate with Emmeline, and\nrepresented his tenderness and his contrition, 'till she consented (as\nshe was now able to sit up) to admit him.\n\nOn his entrance, he said something, he hardly knew what, to Emmeline.\nShe held out her hand to him in token of forgiveness. He seized it\neagerly, and pressed it to his heart, while he gazed on her face as if\nto enquire there what passed in hers.\n\n'Remember, Delamere,' said she, 'remember I am content to forgive your\nlate rash and absurd attempt, only on condition of your giving me the\nmost positive assurance that you will carry me directly to Mrs.\nStafford's, and there leave me.'\n\nHard as these terms appeared, after the hopes he had entertained on\nundertaking the journey, he was forced to submit; but it was evidently\nwith reluctance.\n\n'I do promise then,' said he, 'to take you to Mrs. Stafford's; but'----\n\n'But what?' asked Emmeline.\n\n'Do you not mean, when you are there, to exclude me for ever?--Mrs.\nStafford is no friend of mine.'\n\n'I have already told you, Mr. Delamere, that I will see you wherever I\nam, under certain restrictions: and tho' your late conduct might, and\nindeed ought to induce me to withdraw that promise, yet I now repeat it.\nBut do not believe that I will therefore be persecuted as I have been;\nrecollect that I have already been driven from Mowbray Castle, from\nSwansea, and from Mrs. Ashwood's, wholly on your account.'\n\n'Your remedy, my Emmeline, is, to consent to inhabit a house of your\nown, and suffer me to be the first of your servants.'\n\nThe varying colour of her complexion, to which the emotions of her mind\nrestored for a moment the faint tints of returning health, made Delamere\nhope that her resolution was shaken; and seizing with his usual\nvehemence on an idea so flattering, he was instantly on his knees before\nher imploring her consent to prosecute their journey, and intreating\nMiss Lawson's assistance, to move her inexorable friend.\n\nEmmeline was too weak to bear an address of this sort. The feebleness of\nher frame ill seconded the resolution of her mind; which,\nnotwithstanding the struggles of pity and regard for Delamere, which she\ncould not entirely silence, was immoveably determined. Rallying\ntherefore her spirits, and summoning her fortitude to answer him, she\nsaid--'How _can_ you, Sir, solicit a woman, whom you wish to make your\nwife, to break a promise so solemn as that I have given to your father?\nCould you hereafter have any dependance on one, who holds her integrity\nso lightly? and should you not with great reason suspect that with her,\nfalsehood and deception might become habitual?'\n\n'Not at all,' answered Delamere. 'Your promise to my father is nugatory;\nfor it ought never to have been given. He took an unfair advantage of\nyour candour and your timidity; and all that you said ought not to bind\n_you_; since it was extorted from you by _him_ who had no right to make\nsuch conditions.'\n\n'What! has a father no right to decide to whom he will entrust the\nhappiness of his son, and the honour of his posterity? Alas! Delamere,\nyou argue against yourself; you only convince me that I ought not to put\nthe whole happiness of my life into the hands of a man, who will so\nreadily break thro' his first duties. The same impatient, pardon me, if\nI say the same selfish spirit, which now urges you to set paternal\nauthority at defiance, will perhaps hereafter impel you, with as little\ndifficulty, to quit a wife of whom you may be weary, for any other\nperson whom caprice or novelty may dress in the perfections you now\nfancy I possess. Ah! Delamere! shall I have a right to expect tenderness\nand faith from a man whom I have assisted in making his parents unhappy;\nand who has by my means embittered the evening of their lives to whom he\nowes his own? Do you think that a rebellious and unfeeling son is likely\nto make a good husband, a good father?'\n\n'Death and madness!' cried Delamere, relapsing into all the violence of\nhis nature--'what do you mean by all this! Selfish! rebellious!\nunfeeling!--am I then _so_ worthless, _so_ detestable in your eyes?'\n\nHis extravagant expressions of passion always terrified Emmeline; but\nthe paroxysm to which he now yielded, alarmed her less than it did Miss\nLawson, who never having seen such frantic behaviour before, thought him\nreally mad. She tremblingly besought him to sit down and be calm; while\nthe pale countenance of Emmeline which she shewed him, convinced him he\nmust subdue the violence of his transports, or hazard seeing her relapse\ninto that alarming state which had forced him to relinquish his project.\nThis observation restored his senses for a moment.--He besought her\npardon, with tears; then again cursed his own folly, and seemed on the\npoint of renouncing the contrition he had just assured her he felt. The\nscene lasted till Emmeline, quite overcome with it, grew so faint that\nshe said she must go to bed; and then Delamere, again terrified at an\nidea which he had forgot but the moment before, consented to retire if\nshe would again repeat her forgiveness.\n\nShe gave him her hand languidly, and in silence. He kissed it; and half\nin resentment, half in sorrow, left her, and returned to the inn, in a\nhumour which equally unfitted him for society or solitude. Obliged,\nhowever, to remain in the latter, he brooded gloomily over his\ndisappointment; and believing Emmeline's life no longer in danger, he\nfancied that his fears had magnified her illness. He again deprecated\nhis folly for having consented to relinquish the prosecution of his\njourney, and for having agreed to carry her where he feared access to\nher would be rendered rare and difficult, by the inflexible prudence and\nwatchful friendship of Mrs. Stafford. Sometimes he formed vague projects\nto deceive her, and carry her again towards Scotland; then relinquished\nthem and formed others. He passed the night however nearly without\nsleep, and the morning found him still irresolute.\n\nAt eight o'clock, he went to the house of Mrs. Champness; and Miss\nLawson came down to him, but with a countenance in which uneasiness was\nso visible, that Delamere was almost afraid of asking how Miss Mowbray\ndid.\n\nShe told him that she had passed a restless and uncomfortable night, and\nthat the conversation he had held the evening before had been the cause\nof an access of fever quite as high as the first attack; and, that tho'\nshe tried to conquer her weakness, and affected ability to prosecute a\njourney for which she hourly grew more eager, it was easy to see that\nshe was as unfit for it as ever. Miss Lawson added, that if in a few\nhours she was not better, she should send to Mr. Lawson to come from\nStevenage to see her. This account renewed with extreme violence all the\nformer terrors of Delamere, which a few hours before he had been trying\nto persuade himself were groundless.\n\nHe now reproached himself for his thoughtless cruelty; and Miss Lawson\nseized this opportunity to exhort him to be more cautious for the\nfuture, which he readily and warmly protested he would be. He promised\nnever again to give way to such extravagant transports, and pressed to\nbe admitted to see Emmeline; but Miss Lawson would by no means suffer\nhim to see her 'till she was more recovered from the effects of his\nfrenzy.\n\nIn the afternoon, he was allowed to drink tea in Emmeline's room, and\nexpressed his sincere concern for his indiscretion of the evening\nbefore. He tried, by shewing a disposition to comply with all her\nwishes, to obliterate the memory of his former indiscretion. Emmeline\nwas willing to forget the offence, and pardon the offender, on his\nrenewing his promise to take her the next day towards London, on her\nroute into Dorsetshire; if she should be well enough to undertake the\njourney.\n\nThe spirit and fortitude of Emmeline, fatal as they were to his hopes,\ncommanded the respect, esteem, and almost the adoration of Delamere;\nwhile her gentleness and kindness oppressed his heart with fondness so\nextreme, that he was equally undone by the one and the other, and felt\nthat it every hour became more and more impossible for him to live\nwithout her.\n\nIt was agreed, that as it would be impossible to reach Woodfield from\nHertford, without stopping one night on the road, they would proceed\nthro' London to Staines the first day, and from thence go on early the\nnext to the house of Mrs. Stafford.\n\nAfter lingering with her as long as he could, Delamere took his leave\nfor the evening, determined to observe the promises he had made her, and\nnever again to attempt to obtain her but by her own consent. When he\nmade these resolves, he really intended to adhere to them; and was\nconfirmed in his good resolutions when he the next morning found her\nready to trust herself with him, calm, chearful, full of confidence in\nhis promises, and of gentleness and kindness towards him.\n\nEmmeline took an affectionate leave of her amiable acquaintance, Miss\nLawson, whose uncommon kindness, on so short a knowledge of her, filled\nher heart with gratitude. She promised to write to her as soon as she\ngot to Woodfield, and to return the cloaths she had borrowed, to which\nshe secretly purposed adding some present, to testify her sense of the\ncivilities she had received.\n\nDelamere enclosed, in a letter which he sent by Miss Lawson to her\nfather, a bank note, as an acknowledgment of his extraordinary kindness.\n\nThey quickly arrived in London; and as Emmeline still remained in the\nresolution of avoiding a return to Mrs. Ashwood, they changed horses in\nPiccadilly to go on.\n\nTho' by going to her former residence she might have escaped a longer\ncontinuation, and farther journey, with Delamere, of the impropriety of\nwhich she was very sensible; yet she declined it, because she knew that\nas her adventure might be explained several ways, Mrs. Ashwood and Miss\nGalton were very likely to put on it the construction least in her\nfavour; and she was very unwilling to be exposed to their questions and\ncomments, till she could, in concert with Mrs. Stafford, and with her\nadvice, give such an account of the affair as would put it out of their\npower to indulge that malignity of remark at her expence of which she\nknew they were capable.\n\nShe therefore dispatched a servant to Mrs. Ashwood with a note for her\ncloaths, whom Delamere directed to rejoin them at Staines.\n\nAt that place they arrived early in the evening; and Emmeline, to whom\nDelamere had behaved with the utmost tenderness and respect, bore her\njourney without suffering any other inconvenience than some remaining\nlanguor, which was now more visible in her looks than in her spirits.\nCharmed with the thoughts of so soon seeing Mrs. Stafford, and feeling\nall that delight which a consciousness of rectitude inspires, she was\nmore than usually chearful, and conversed with Delamere with all that\nenchanting frankness and sweetness which made her general conversation\nso desireable.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nAs they had an hour or two on their hands, which Emmeline wished to\nemploy in something that might prevent Delamere from entertaining her on\nthe only subject he was ever willing to talk of when they were together,\nshe desired him to enquire for a book. He went out, and returned with\nsome volumes of novels, which he had borrowed of the landlord's\ndaughter; of which Emmeline read in some a page, and in others a\nchapter, but found nothing in any, that tempted her to go regularly\nthrough the whole.\n\nWhile she was reading, Delamere, equally unable to occupy himself with\nany other object whether she was absent or present, sat looking at her\nover the table which was between them. After some time passed in this\nmanner, their supper was brought in, and common conversation took place\nwhile it was passing. When it was removed, Emmeline returned again to\nthe books, and took up one she had not before opened.--It was the\nsecond volume of the Sorrows of Werter. She laid it down again with a\nsmile, saying--'That will not do for me to-night.'\n\n'What is it?' cried Delamere, taking it from her.--'O, I have read\nit--and if _you_ have, Emmeline, you might have learned the danger of\ntrifling with violent and incurable passions. Tell me--could you ever be\nreconciled to yourself if you should be the cause of a catastrophe\nequally fatal?'\n\nStill meaning to turn the conversation, she answered gaily--'O, I fancy\nthere is very little danger of that--you know the value of your\nexistence too well to throw it inconsiderately away.'\n\n'Do not be too certain of that, Emmeline. Without you, my life is no\nlonger valuable--if indeed it be supportable; and should I ever be in\nthe situation this melancholy tale describes, how do I know that my\nreason would be strong enough to preserve me from equal rashness.\nBeware, Miss Mowbray--beware of the consequence of finding an Albert at\nWoodfield.'\n\n'It is very unlikely I should find any lover there. I assure you I\ndesire none; nor have I any other wish than to pass the remainder of the\nwinter tranquilly with my friend.'\n\n'If then you really never wish to encourage another, and if you have any\nsensibility for the pain I feel from uncertainty, why will you not\nsolemnly engage yourself to me, by a promise which cannot be broken but\nby mutual consent?'\n\n'Because we are both too young to form such an engagement.--You are not\nyet quite one and twenty; a time of life in which it is impossible you\ncan be a competent judge of what will make you really happy. I am more\nthan two years younger: but short as has been my knowledge of the world,\nI have already seen two or three instances of marriages made in\nconsequence of early engagements, which have proved so little fortunate\nthat they have determined me never to try the experiment. Should you\nbind yourself by this promise, which you now think would make you easy,\nand should you hereafter repent it, which I know to be far from\nimprobable, pride, obstinacy, the shame of retracting your opinion,\nwould perhaps concur to prevent your withdrawing it; and I should\nreceive your hand while your heart might be attached to another. The\nchains which you had yourself put on, in opposition to the wishes of\nyour family, you would, rather than own your error, rivet, tho' your\ninclination prompted you to break them; and we should then be both\nmiserable.--No, Delamere--let us remain at liberty, and perhaps----'\n\n'It is impossible, Madam!' cried Delamere, suddenly and vehemently\ninterrupting her--'It is absolutely impossible you could argue thus\ncalmly, if you had any regard for me--Cold--cruel--insensible--unfeeling\ngirl! Oh! fool, fool that I am, to persist in loving a woman without an\nheart, and to be unable to tear from my soul a passion that serves only\nto make me perpetually wretched. Cursed be the hour I first indulged it,\nand cursed the weakness of mind that cannot conquer it!'\n\nThis new instance of ungovernable temper, so contrary to the promises he\nhad given her at Hertford, extremely provoked Emmeline, who answered\nvery gravely--\n\n'If you desire, Sir, to divest yourself of this unfortunate passion, the\ntask is already half accomplished. Resolve, then, to conquer it wholly:\nrestore me to that tranquillity you have destroyed--vindicate my injured\nreputation, which your headlong ardour has blemished--give me back to\nthe kindness and protection of your father--and determine to see me no\nmore.'\n\nThis spirited and severe answer, immediately convinced Delamere he had\ngone too far. He had never before seen Emmeline so much piqued, and he\nhastened to appease her.\n\n'Pardon me!--forgive me, Emmeline! I am not master of myself when I\nthink of losing you! But you, who feel not any portion of the flame that\ndevours me, can coolly argue, while my heart is torn in pieces; and\ndeign not even to make any allowance for the unguarded sallies of\nunconquerable passion!--the phrenzy of almost hopeless love! Sometimes,\nwhen I think your coldness arises from determined and insurmountable\nindifference--perhaps from dislike--despair and fury possess me. Would\nyou but say that you will live only for me--would you only promise that\nno future Rochely, none of the people you have seen or may see, shall\ninfluence you to forget me--I should, I think, be easier!'\n\n'You have a better opinion of yourself, Mr. Delamere,' answered\nEmmeline, calmly, 'than to believe it probable. But be that as it may, I\nhave told you that I will neither make or receive any promises of the\nnature you require. I have already suffered too much from your\nextravagant passion to put it farther in your power to distress me. But\nI shall be better able to reassume this conversation to-morrow--to-night\nI am fatigued; and it is time for us to separate.'\n\n'And will you leave me, then, Emmeline?--leave me too in anger?'\n\n'I am not angry, Mr. Delamere--here is my hand.'\n\n'This hand,' exclaimed he, eagerly grasping it, 'which ought to have\nbeen mine!--Now, even now, that you are about to tear yourself from me,\nit should have been mine for ever! But I have relinquished my prize at\nthe moment I might have secured it; and if I lose it entirely my own\nfolly only will be the cause.'\n\n'These violent transports may terrify me, but shall not alter my\ndetermination. Quit my hand, Mr. Delamere,' continued she, struggling to\ndisengage it--'I will not be detained.'\n\nShe rang the bell; and the waiter almost instantly entering, she took a\ncandle and went to the apartment prepared for her: while Delamere, vexed\nto have commanded himself so little, and to be so unable to adhere to\nthe good resolutions he had made, dared not attempt to prevent her.\n\nHe had now again to make his peace, but would not venture to take any\nsteps towards it that night; and he retired to his own room, considering\nhow he might remain near her after she got into Dorsetshire, and\ndreading the hour of even a temporary separation.\n\nThe next morning Emmeline, impatient to be gone, dressed herself early;\nand just as she was about to go down to hasten their breakfast and\ndeparture, she saw, from a window that looked into the yard of the inn,\na phaeton and four enter it, remarkable for the profusion of expensive\nand ill-fancied ornaments with which both the carriage and harness were\ncovered. In it were two gentlemen wrapped in great coats, as the weather\nwas very severe; on whom Emmeline casting a transient glance, discovered\nthat one of them was Elkerton.\n\nShe was a good deal alarmed at his arrival: for she had reason to fear,\nthat this man, to whom she had a decided aversion, would see her, and\nknow that she was travelling alone with Delamere. She saw him get out,\nand give directions for putting up his horses, telling the people who\ncame out to attend him that he should breakfast and stay there some\nhours.\n\nSince his unfortunate _rencontre_ with Delamere at Mrs. Ashwood's, he\nhad almost entirely relinquished the pursuit of Emmeline. He had never\nbeen able to shake off the ridicule his vanity had brought upon him, and\ntherefore had forborne to enter the circle where it had happened. He\nhad, however, seen Miss Mowbray once or twice in public, and she had\nbeen too generally admired not to interest his pride in keeping up the\nacquaintance, tho' she treated him always with coldness, and found it\ndifficult to be barely civil. She knew that he was severely mortified by\nher indifference, and that in matters of scandal and gossiping no old\nwoman could be a greater adept. When therefore personal pique was added\nto his natural love of anecdote, Emmeline apprehended so much from him,\nthat she determined, if possible, to escape his sight.\n\nTo do this, however, was very difficult. She saw him and his companion\ntake possession of a room that had windows looking into the yard through\nwhich she must of necessity pass, and where, when the post-chaise drew\nup, they must see whoever got into it. She wrapped herself up in her\ncloak, pulled her hat over her eyes, and holding up her handkerchief as\nif to guard her face from the cold, she passed unobserved to the room\nwhere Delamere was waiting breakfast.\n\nThe remembrance of his last night's behaviour was in some measure\nobliterated by the alarm she had felt at the sight of Elkerton. Delamere\nlooked melancholy and dejected. Emmeline speaking to him with her usual\nsweetness, seemed to have forgotten the offence he had given her, and\ntried to restore his good humour as if she had been the aggressor: but\nhe continued gloomy and pensive.\n\nThey began their breakfast, and conversed on different subjects.\n\n'Did you observe,' said Emmeline, 'the phaeton which drove in just now?'\n\n'No--what was there remarkable about it?'\n\n'Nothing, but that one of the persons it contained was Elkerton, the\npoor man you made so absurd at Mrs. Ashwood's, when he boasted of\nknowing you. I hope I shall get away without his seeing me--I should\nextremely dislike meeting him.'\n\n'Stupid dog!--why should you care whether you meet him or no?'\n\n'Because he must think it so strange that I am here with you.'\n\n'Let him--Of what consequence is it to us what such a puppy thinks? I\ncannot possibly care about it.'\n\n'But _I_ do, Mr. Delamere,' said Emmeline, somewhat gravely.--'You will\nrecollect that I may be very much injured by the scandal such a man may\ncirculate.'\n\n'Well, well, my dear Emmeline--we will set out directly, and you will\nnot meet him.--I will order the chaise.'\n\nHe went out for that purpose as soon as their breakfast ended; but a few\npaces from the door was accosted by Elkerton, who feeling himself in\npoint of figure equal to speak to any man, addressed him with all the\nconfident familiarity of an old acquaintance.\n\n'Sir, your most obedient humble servant.'\n\n'Your servant, Sir;' replied Delamere, brushing by him.\n\n'Sir, I hope you, and my Lord and Lady Montreville, have been well since\nI had last the honour of seeing you?'\n\n'Since you oblige me, Sir, to acknowledge the acquaintance, I must\nremind you that our last meeting was attended with some circumstances\nwhich should make you not very desirous of recollecting it.'\n\n'Oh, dear! very far from not wishing to remember it, I am always pleased\nwith such agreeable badinage from my friends, and some how or other\ncontrive to be even with them. Prithee, dear boy, whither are you\ngoing?--perhaps we are travelling the same road?'\n\n'I hope not,' said Delamere, turning from him, and advancing towards the\nbar.\n\nElkerton, unabashed, followed him.\n\n'If we are,' continued he, 'I think you shall take me into your\npost-chaise. I am going to pass a month with a friend in Hampshire; and\nJackman, who loves driving, tho' he knows nothing of the matter,\npersuaded me to use an open carriage; but it is so cold, that I believe\nI shall let him enjoy it alone the rest of the way. Suppose we go\ntogether, if your destination is the Winchester road?'\n\nDelamere was so provoked at this forwardness, that he found he should be\nunable to give a moderate answer.--He therefore turned away without\ngiving any.\n\n'Pray, Sir,' said the bar maid to Elkerton, 'who is that young\ngentleman?'\n\n'Lord Montreville's son,' replied he; 'and one of the strangest fellows\nin the world.--Sometimes we are as intimate as brothers; and now you see\nhe'll hardly speak to me.'\n\n'Perhaps, Mr. Elkerton,' said the woman, smiling, 'the young gentleman\nmay have very good reasons for not taking another companion in his\npost-chaise.'\n\nElkerton pressed her to explain herself.\n\n'Why you must know,' said she, 'that there's a young lady with him; one\nof the prettiest young women I ever see. Last night, after they comed\nhere, his walet was pretty near tipsey; so he come and sot down here,\nand told me how his master had hired him to go along with 'em to\nScotland; but that before they got near half way, somehow or other 'twas\nsettled for 'em to come back again. But don't say as I told you, Mr.\nElkerton, for that would be as much as my place is worth.'\n\nThis intelligence awakened all the curiosity of Elkerton, together with\nsome hopes of being able to revenge himself on Delamere for his contempt\nand rudeness.\n\n'Egad!' cried he, 'I'll have a peep at this beauty, however.'\n\nSo saying, he strutted across the yard, and placed himself under a\nlittle piazza which made a covered communication between the rooms of\nthe inn which were built round the yard, and along which they were\nobliged to pass to get into the chaise.\n\nThe room door opened--Delamere and Emmeline appeared at it.\n\n'Draw up, postillions, as close as you can,' cried the waiter.\n\nDelamere, holding Emmeline's hand, advanced; but on seeing Elkerton, she\nstepped back into the room.\n\n'Come, come,' said Delamere--'never concern yourself about that\nimpertinent fellow.'\n\nElkerton, tho' he did not distinctly hear this speech, had caught a view\nof the person to whom it was addressed; and tho' her face was concealed,\nher height and air convinced him it was Miss Mowbray.\n\n'How do you, Madam?' exclaimed he, bowing and advancing--'Miss Mowbray,\nI hope I have the happiness of seeing you well.'\n\n'We are in haste, Sir,' said Delamere, leading Emmeline towards the\nchaise.\n\n'Nay, my good friend,' returned Elkerton, 'allow me I beg to pay my\nrespects to this lady, with whom I have the honour of being\nacquainted--Miss Mowbray, permit me----'\n\nHe would have taken the hand which was disengaged; but Emmeline shrunk\nfrom him, and stepped quickly into the chaise.\n\nElkerton still advanced, and leaning almost into it, he said--'Your long\njourney, I hope, has not too much fatigued you.'\n\n'By heaven!' exclaimed Delamere, 'this is too much! Sir, you are the\nmost troublesome, insolent fool, I ever met with!'\n\nSo saying, he seized Elkerton by the collar, and twisting him suddenly\nround, threw him with great violence against one of the pillars of the\npiazza.\n\nHe then got into the chaise; and taking out of his pocket two or three\ncards, on which his address was written, he tossed them out of the\nwindow; saying, with a voice that struck terror into the overthrown\nknight on the ground--'You know where to hear of me if you have any\nthing to say.'\n\nThe chaise now drove quickly away; while Delamere tried to reassure\nEmmeline, who was so much terrified by the suddenness of this scuffle,\nthat she had hardly breath to reproach him for his impetuosity. He\nanswered, that he had kept his temper too long with the meddling ideot,\nand that to have overlooked such impertinence without resentment was not\nin his nature. He tried to laugh off her apprehensions; and flattered by\nthe anxiety she felt for his safety, all his gaiety and good humour\nseemed to return.\n\nBut Emmeline, extremely hurt to find that Elkerton was informed of the\njourney she had taken, and vexed that Delamere had engaged in a quarrel,\nthe event of which, if not personally dangerous to him, could not fail\nof being prejudicial to her, continued very low and uneasy the rest of\ntheir journey, reflecting on nothing with pleasure but on her\napproaching interview with Mrs. Stafford.\n\nBut this hoped-for happiness was soon converted into the most poignant\nuneasiness. On their arrival at Woodfield, Emmeline had the pain of\nhearing that Mrs. Stafford, who had two days before been delivered of a\ndaughter, had continued dangerously ill ever since. The physicians who\nattended her had that day given them hopes that her illness might end\nfavourably; but she was still in a situation so precarious that her\nattendants were in great alarm.\n\nAs she had anxiously expected Emmeline, and expressed much astonishment\nat not having heard from her the week before, which was that on which\nshe had purposed to be with her, and as she still continued earnestly to\nenquire for news of Miss Mowbray, Mr. Stafford insisted on informing her\nshe was arrived; and this intelligence seemed to give her pleasure. She\ndesired Emmeline might come to her bed-side: but she was so weak, that\nshe could only in a faint voice express her pleasure at the sight of\nher; and pressing her hand, begged she would not leave her.\n\nIt was impossible Emmeline could speak to her on the subject of\nDelamere, as the least emotion might have been of the most fatal\nconsequence; and tho' she earnestly wished he might not have been\ninvited to stay, she was obliged to let it take it's course. She left\nher friend's room no more that evening; and gave her whole thoughts and\nattention to keeping her quiet and administering her medicines, which\nMrs. Stafford seemed pleased to receive from her hands.\n\nMr. Stafford was one of those unfortunate characters, who having neither\nperseverance and regularity to fit them for business, or taste and\ngenius for more refined pursuits, seek, in every casual occurrence or\nchildish amusement, relief against the tedium of life. Tho' married very\nearly, and tho' father of a numerous family, he had thrown away the time\nand money, which should have provided for them, in collecting baubles,\nwhich he had repeatedly possessed and discarded, 'till having exhausted\nevery source that that species of idle folly offered, he had been\ndriven, by the same inability to pursue proper objects, into vices yet\nmore fatal to the repose of his wife, and schemes yet more destructive\nto the fortune of his family. Married to a woman who was the delight of\nher friends and the admiration of her acquaintance, surrounded by a\nlovely and encreasing family, and possessed of every reasonable means of\nhappiness, he dissipated that property, which ought to have secured it's\ncontinuance, in vague and absurd projects which he neither loved or\nunderstood; and his temper growing more irritable in proportion as his\ndifficulties encreased, he sometimes treated his wife with great\nharshness; and did not seem to think it necessary, even by apparent\nkindness and attention, to excuse or soften to her his general ill\nconduct, or his 'battening on the moor' of low and degrading debauchery.\n\nMrs. Stafford, who had been married to him at fifteen, had long been\nunconscious of his weakness: and when time and her own excellent\nunderstanding pressed the fatal conviction too forcibly upon her, she\nstill, but fruitlessly, attempted to hide from others what she saw too\nevidently herself.\n\nFear for the future fate of her children, and regret to find that she\nhad no influence over her husband, together with the knowledge of\nconnections to which she had till a few months before been a stranger,\nhad given to Mrs. Stafford, whose temper was naturally extremely\nchearful, that air of despondence, and melancholy cast of mind, which\nEmmeline had remarked with so much concern on their first acquaintance.\n\nTo such a man as Mr. Stafford, the arrival of Delamere afforded novelty,\nand consequently some degree of satisfaction. He took it into his head\nto be extremely civil to him, and pressed him to continue some time at\nhis house; but Delamere well knew that Emmeline would be made unhappy by\nhis remaining more than one night; as Mr. Stafford entered however so\nwarmly into his interest, he begged of him to recollect whether there\nwas not any house to be let within a few miles of Woodfield.\n\nMr. Stafford instantly named a hunting seat of Sir Philip Carnaby's,\nwhich he said would exactly suit him. It's possessor, whom some\ndisarrangement in his affairs had obliged to go abroad for a few years,\nhad ordered it to be let ready furnished, from year to year.\n\nDelamere went the next morning to the attorney who let it; and making an\nagreement for it, ordered in all the requisites for his immediate\nresidence; and, till it was ready, accepted Mr. Stafford's invitation to\nremain at Woodfield.\n\nEmmeline, who confined herself wholly to her friend's apartment, knew\nnothing of this arrangement 'till it was concluded: and when she heard\nit, remonstrance and objection were vain.\n\nThe illness of Mrs. Stafford, tho' it did not gain ground, was still\nvery alarming, and called forth, to a painful excess, that lively\nsympathy which Emmeline felt for those she loved. She continued to\nattend her with the tenderest assiduity; and after five days painful\nsuspence, had the happiness to find her out of danger, and well enough\nto hear the relation Emmeline had to make of the involuntary elopement.\n\nMrs. Stafford advised her immediately to write to Lord Montreville;\nwhich her extreme anxiety only had occasioned her so long to delay.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nLord Montreville and Sir Richard Crofts, after exhausting every mode of\nenquiry at the end of their journey, without having discovered any\ntraces of the fugitives, returned to London. The uncertainty of what was\nbecome of his son, and concern for the fate of Emmeline, made his\nLordship more unhappy than he had yet been: and the reception he met\nwith on his return home did not contribute to relieve him; he found that\nno intelligence had been received of Delamere; and Lady Montreville\nbeset him with complaints and reproaches. The violence of her passions\nhad, for some months, subjected her to fits; and the evasion of her son,\nand her total ignorance of what was become of him, had kept her in\nperpetual agony during Lord Montreville's absence. His return after so\nsuccessless a journey encreased her sufferings, and she was of a temper\nnot to suffer alone, but to inflict on others some part of the pain she\nfelt herself.\n\nLord Montreville attempted in vain to appease and console her. Nothing\nbut some satisfactory account of Delamere had the least chance of\nsucceeding; and his Lordship, who now supposed that Delamere and\nEmmeline were concealed in the neighbourhood of London, determined to\npersevere in every means of discovering them.\n\nFor this purpose he had again recourse to the Crofts'; and Sir Richard\nand both his sons readily undertook to assist him in his search, and\nparticularly the elder undertook it with the warmest zeal.\n\nThis young man inherited all the cunning of his father, together with a\ncoolness of temper which supplied the place of solid understanding and\nquick parts; since it always gave him time to see where his interest\nlay, and steadiness to pursue it. By incessant assiduity he had acquired\nthe confidence of Lady Montreville, to whom his attention and attendance\nwere become almost necessary.\n\nHer Ladyship never dreamed that a man of his rank could lift his eyes to\neither of her daughters, and therefore encouraged his constant\nattendance on them both; while Crofts was too sensible of the value of\nsuch an alliance not to take advantage of the opportunities that were\nincessantly afforded him.\n\nLady Montreville had repeatedly declared, that if Delamere married\nEmmeline all that part of the fortune which she had a right to give away\nshould be the property of her eldest daughter. This was upwards of six\nthousand pounds a year; and whether this ever happened or not, Crofts\nknew that what was settled on younger children, which must at all events\nbe divided between the two young ladies, would make either of them a\nfortune worth all attempts, independent of the connection he would form\nby it with Lord Montreville, who now began to make a very considerable\nfigure in the political world.\n\nWith these views, Crofts had for near two years incessantly applied\nhimself to conciliate the good opinion of the whole family, with so much\nart that nobody suspected his designs. The slight and contemptuous\ntreatment he had always received from Delamere, he had affected to pass\nby with the calm magnanimity of a veteran statesman; and emulating the\ndecided conduct and steady indifference of age, rather than yielding to\nthe warmth of temper natural to five and twenty, he was considered as a\nvery rising and promising young man by the grave politicians with whom\nhe associated, and by those of his own age a supercilious and solemn\ncoxcomb.\n\nHe had studied the characters of the two Miss Delameres, and found that\nof the eldest the fittest for his purpose; tho' the person of the\nyoungest, and the pride which encased the heart of the other, would have\nmade a less able politician decide for Augusta. But he saw that the very\npride which seemed an impediment to his hopes, might, under proper\nmanagement, contribute to their success. He saw that she really loved\nnobody but herself; that her personal vanity was greater than the pride\nof her rank; and that her heart was certainly on that side assailable.\nHe therefore, by distant hints and sighs, affected concealment; and\nartful speeches gave her to understand that all his prudence had not\nbeen able to defend him from the indiscretion of a hopeless passion.\n\nWhile he was contented to call it hopeless, Miss Delamere, tho' long\npartial to Fitz-Edward, could not refuse herself the indulgence of\nhearing it; and at length grew so accustomed to allow him to talk to her\nof his unbounded and despairing love, that she found it very\ndisagreeable to be without him.\n\nHe saw, that unless a title and great estate crossed his path, his\nsuccess, tho' it might be slow, was almost certain. But he was obliged\nto proceed with caution; notwithstanding he would have been very glad\nto have secured his prize before the return of Delamere to his family\nthrew an obstacle in his way which was the most formidable he had to\ncontend with.\n\nHe affected, however, the utmost anxiety to discover him; and recited to\nLord Montreville an exhortation he intended to pronounce to him, if he\nshould be fortunate enough to do so.\n\nNothing could be a greater proof of his Lordship's opinion of Crofts\nthan his entrusting him with a commission, which, if successful, could\nhardly fail of irritating the fiery and ungovernable temper of Delamere,\nand driving him into excesses which it would require all the philosophic\nsteadiness of Crofts to support without resentment.\n\nWhile Sir Richard and his two sons therefore set about the difficult\ntask of finding Delamere, Lord Montreville went himself to Fitz-Edward;\nbut heard that for many days he had not been at his apartments, that he\nhad taken no servants with him, and that they knew not whither he was\ngone, or when he would return.\n\nLord Montreville, who had depended more on the information of\nFitz-Edward than any other he hoped to obtain, left a note at his\nlodgings desiring to see him as soon as he came to town, and went back\nin encreased uneasiness to his own house. But among the numberless\nletters which lay on his library table, the directions of which he\nhastily read in a faint hope of news of Delamere, he saw one directed by\nthe hand of Emmeline. He tore it eagerly open--it contained an account\nof all that had happened, written with such clearness and simplicity as\nimmediately impressed it's truth; and it is difficult to say whether\nLord Montreville's pleasure at finding his son still unmarried, or his\nadmiration at the greatness of his niece's mind, were the predominant\nemotion.\n\nWhen the former sentiment a little subsided, and he had time to reflect\non all the heroism of her conduct, he was almost ashamed of the long\nopposition he had given to his son's passion; and would, if he had not\nknown his wife's prejudices invincible, have acknowledged, that neither\nthe possession of birth or fortune could make any amends to him, who saw\nand knew how to value the beauty of such a mind as that of Emmeline. The\ninveterate aversion and insurmountable pride of Lady Montreville, he had\nno hope of conquering; and she had too much in her power, to suffer his\nLordship to think of Delamere's losing such a large portion of his\ninheritance by disobeying her. For these reasons he checked the\ninclination he felt rising in his own heart to reward and receive his\nniece, and thought only of taking advantage of her integrity to separate\nhis son from her for ever.\n\nHe went with the letter in his hand to Lady Montreville's apartment,\nwhere he found Mr. Crofts and the two young ladies.\n\nHe read it to them; and when he had finished it, expressed in the\nwarmest terms his approbation of Miss Mowbray's conduct. Lady\nMontreville testified nothing but satisfaction at what she called 'the\nfoolish boy's escape from ruin,' without having the generosity to\napplaud _her_, whose integrity was so much the object of admiration.\n\nPossessing neither candour nor generosity herself, she was incapable of\nloving those qualities in another; and in answer to Lord Montreville's\npraises of Emmeline, which she heard with reluctance, she was not\nashamed to say, that perhaps were the whole truth known, his Lordship\nwould find but little reason to set up his relation's character higher\nthan that of his own children--to which her eldest daughter added--'Why,\nto be sure, Madam, there is, as my father says, something very\nextraordinary in Miss Mowbray's refusing _such a match_--that is, _if_\nshe has no other attachment.'\n\nAugusta Delamere heard all that her father said in commendation of her\nbeloved Emmeline, with eyes suffused with tears, which drew on her the\nanger of her mother and the malignant sneers of her sister.\n\nThe two young ladies however were sent away, while a council was held\nbetween Lord and Lady Montreville and Crofts, on what steps it was\nimmediately necessary to take.\n\nSeveral ideas were started, but none which his Lordship approved. He\ndetermined therefore to write to his son; with whose residence at\nTylehurst, the house of Sir Philip Carnaby, Emmeline's letter acquainted\nhim; and wait his answer before he proceeded farther.\n\nWith this resolution, Lady Montreville was extremely discontented; and\nproposed, as the only plan on which they could depend, that his\nLordship, under pretence of placing her properly, should send Emmeline\nto France, and there confine her till Delamere, hopeless of regaining\nher, should consent to marry Miss Otley.\n\nHer Ladyship urged--'That it could not possibly do the girl any harm;\nand that very worthy people had not scrupled to commit much more\nviolent actions where their motive was right, tho' less strong, than\nthat which would in this case actuate Lord Montreville, which was,' she\nsaid, 'to save the sole remaining heir of a noble house from a degrading\nand beggarly alliance.'\n\n'Hold! Madam,' cried Lord Montreville, who was extremely displeased at\nthe proposal, and with the speech with which it closed--'Remember, I beg\nof you, that when you speak of the Mowbray family, you speak of one very\nlittle if at all inferior to your own; nor should you, Lady Montreville,\nforget, in the heat of your resentment, that you are a woman--a woman\ntoo, whose birth should at least give you a liberal mind, and put you\nabove thinking of an action as unfeminine as inhuman. Surely, as a\nmother who have daughters of your own, you should have some feeling for\nthis young woman; not at all their inferior, but in being born under\ncircumstances for which she is not to blame, and which mark with\nsufficient unhappiness a life that might otherwise have done as much\nhonour to my family as I hope your daughters will do to your's.'\n\nThe slightest contradiction was what Lady Montreville had never been\naccustomed to bear patiently. The asperity therefore of this speech, and\nthe total rejection of her project, threw her into an agony of passion\nwhich ended in an hysteric fit.\n\nLord Montreville, less moved than usual, committed her to the care of\nher daughters and women, and continued to talk coolly to Crofts on the\nsubject they were before discussing.\n\nAfter considering it in every point of view, he determined to leave\nDelamere at present to his own reflections; only writing to him a calm\nand expostulatory letter; such as, together with Emmeline's steadiness,\non which he now relied with the utmost confidence, might, he thought,\neffect more than violent measures. His Lordship wrote also to Emmeline,\nstrongly expressing his admiration and regard, and his confidence and\nesteem encreased her desire to deserve them.\n\nMrs. Stafford was now nearly recovered; and Delamere settled at his new\nhouse, where he always returned at night, tho' he passed almost every\nday at Woodfield.\n\nHis mornings were often occupied in those amusements of which he had\nbeen so fond before his passion for Emmeline became the only business of\nhis life; and secure of seeing her continually, and of telling how he\nloved her, he became more reasonable than he had hitherto been.\n\nThe letters, however, which now arrived from Lord Montreville, a little\ndisturbed his felicity. They gave Emmeline an opportunity to exhort him\nto return to London--to make his peace with his father, and quiet the\nuneasiness of Lady Montreville, which his Lordship represented as\nexcessive, and as fatal to _her_ health as to the peace of the whole\nfamily.\n\nEmmeline urged him by every tie of duty and affection to relieve the\nanxiety of his family, and particularly to attend to the effect his\nabsence and disobedience had on the constitution of his mother, which\nhad long been extremely shaken. But to all her remonstrances, he\nanswered--'That he would not return, till Lady Montreville would promise\nnever to renew those reflections and reproaches which had driven him\nfrom Audley-Hall; and to which he apprehended he should now be more than\never exposed.'\n\nAs Emmeline could not pretend to procure such an engagement from her\nLadyship, all she could do was to inform Lord Montreville of his\nobjection, and to leave it to him to make terms between Delamere and his\nmother.\n\nNear a month had now elapsed since Emmeline's arrival at Woodfield; and\nthe returning serenity of her mind had restored to her countenance all\nit's bloom and brilliancy. She had indeed no other uneasiness than what\narose from her anxiety to procure quiet to her Uncle's family, and from\nher observations on the encreasing melancholy of Mrs. Stafford, for\nwhich she knew too well how to account.\n\nEven this, however, often appeared alleviated by her presence, and\nforgotten in her conversation; and she rejoiced in the power of\naffording a temporary relief to the sorrows of one whom she so truly\nloved.\n\nThis calm was interrupted by Elkerton, by whom the affront he had\nreceived at Staines, from Delamere, had not been forgotten, tho' he by\nno means relished the thoughts of resenting it in the way his friend\nJackman, and all who heard of it, proposed.\n\nTo risk his life and all his finery, seemed a most cruel condition; but\nJackman protested there was no other by which he could retrieve his\nhonour. And his friend at whose house he was, on the borders of\nHampshire, who had been an officer in the military service of the East\nIndia Company, and had acquired a princely fortune, felt himself\ninspired with all the punctilios of a soldier, and declared to Elkerton\nthat if he put up with this affront no man of honour could hereafter\nspeak to him.\n\nPoor Elkerton, who in the article of fighting, as well as many others,\nextremely resembled '_le Bourgeois Gentilhomme_,' made all the evasions\nin his power; while his _soi disant_ friends, who enjoyed his distress,\npersisted in pushing him on to demand satisfaction of Delamere; but\nafter long debates, he determined first to ask him for an apology. There\nwas, he thought, some hope of obtaining it; if not, he could only in the\nlast extremity have recourse to the desperate expedient of a challenge.\nHe wrote therefore a letter to Delamere, requesting, in the civilest and\nmildest terms, an apology for his behaviour at Staines; and sent it by a\nservant; as it was not more than twenty miles from the house where he\nwas, to that Mr. Delamere had taken.\n\nDelamere returned a contemptuous refusal; but neither mentioned the\nletter to Emmeline, nor thought again about it's writer.\n\nThe unfortunate Elkerton, who reproached incessantly his evil stars for\nhaving thrown this hot-headed boy in his way, could not conceal from his\nfriends the unaccommodating answer he had received to his pacific\noverture; and it was agreed that Elkerton must either determine to fight\nhim, or be excluded from good company for ever. The challenge,\ntherefore, penned by the Asiatic hero, was copied with a trembling hand\nby Elkerton; and Jackman, who had offered to be his second, set out with\nhim for the town near Tylehurst.\n\nOn their arrival, Jackman took a post-chaise to carry the billet to\nDelamere, leaving the terrified Elkerton to settle all his affairs, both\ntemporal and spiritual, against the next morning, when Delamere was\nappointed to meet him on a heath near the town, at seven o'clock.\n\nJackman found Delamere with Fitz-Edward, who had arrived there that day.\nHe delivered his letter, and Delamere immediately answered it by saying\nhe would not fail to attend the appointment, with his friend Colonel\nFitz-Edward.\n\nDuring Jackman's absence, Elkerton tried to argue himself into a state\nof mind fit for the undertaking of the next day. But he found no\narguments gave him any sort of satisfaction, save two; one was, that as\nmost disputes ended with firing a brace of pistols in the air, the\nprobability was, that he should be as fortunate as others--the second,\nthat if the worst should happen, he should at least make a paragraph\nworth some hazard: and that whether he killed Delamere, or fell himself,\nan affair of honour with a young man of his rank would extremely\ncontribute to his fame.\n\nNeither of these reflections however had force enough to prevent his\nheartily wishing there was no necessity to employ them; and he contrived\nto make such a bustle with his servant about his pistols, and sent forth\nso many enquiries for an able surgeon, that it was known immediately at\nthe inn where he was, that the gentleman was come to fight young Squire\nDelamere.\n\nIn a country town, such intelligence soon gained ground; and before\nJackman's return, every shop in it had settled the place and manner of\nthe combat.\n\nOne of Mr. Stafford's servants was at the inn, which was also the post\nhouse; where the landlady failed not to tell him what a bloody-minded\nman was in the next room. The servant, who like all people of his\nstation delighted in the wonderful and the terrible, collected all the\nparticulars; which he retailed on his arrival at home, with every\nexaggeration his invention would lend him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nThe maid who waited on Emmeline had no sooner heard these particulars,\nthan conceiving her to be more interested in the fate of Delamere than\nany other person, she ran up to tell her of it; and tho' she had not\nretained the name of Elkerton perfectly, Emmeline, who instantly\nrecollected the adventure at Staines, saw the truth at once; and was\nterrified at the impending event to a degree that made her for a moment\nincapable of reflection.\n\nTo be, however remotely, or however innocently, the cause of any man's\nhazarding his life, was shocking to all her feelings. But to suppose\nthat Lord Montreville might be made by her means the most wretched of\nhuman beings, by the loss of an only and beloved son, was an idea which\nfroze her blood.\n\nHer regard for Delamere, which was the affection of a sister somewhat\nheightened perhaps by his persevering preference of herself, her\nfriendship for Augusta, and her anxiety for the peace of his whole\nfamily, added to her general tenderness of heart, all co-operated to\ndistress her on this occasion. As soon as she could recollect what was\nbest to be done, she sought Mr. Stafford, to whom she related what she\nhad heard, which the servant who had brought the intelligence repeated\nbefore him.\n\nMr. Stafford, at Emmeline's earnest request, set out for the house of\nDelamere, who had not that day been at Woodfield because he expected\nFitz-Edward. Mr. Stafford delivered to him a pressing entreaty from\nEmmeline that he would forbear to meet Elkerton, or at least delay it\n'till she could speak to him; but Delamere shewing Stafford the letter\nhe had received, desired him to go back and make Emmeline easy as well\nas he could, since to comply with her request was entirely out of his\npower. To the necessity of his meeting Elkerton, Stafford assented; and\nreturned home to relate the little success of his embassy, while the\nterror and alarm of Emmeline were only encreased by his visit.\n\nSuch was her anxiety, that she would have gone herself to Tylehurst, if\nMrs. Stafford had not represented to her that it would be certainly\nimproper, and probably ineffectual.\n\nShe passed a sleepless night, tormenting herself with a thousand\nimaginary modes of misery which might arise from the meeting of the next\nday. But while she continued to form and reject projects for preventing\nit, seven o'clock passed, and the _rencontre_ ended without bloodshed;\nthe cautious valour of Elkerton having been so loud, that a magistrate\nwho lived in the town, and who was well known to Lord Montreville, had\nheard of it, and, with a party of constables, had followed Elkerton at\nsome distance. They concealed themselves, by the justice's order, in a\ngravel-pit near the place of combat, and there saw the ground already\npossessed by Delamere and Fitz-Edward.\n\nThe trembling challenger, with a face as pale as if Delamere's pistol\nhad already done it's worst, followed by Jackman, on whose undaunted\ncountenance he cast a rueful and imploring look, then rode slowly up,\npunctual to the time.\n\nThe usual ceremonies passed, Elkerton's blood seemed to be all gone to\nhis heart, to encourage it to be stout; and his knees, which trembled\nmost piteously, appeared to resent the desertion. He cast round the\nheath a hopeless look--no succour approached! The ground was measured;\neach took their post; and his trembling encreased so violently, that\nDelamere apprehended very little from a pistol in so unsteady a hand.\nBut had he apprehended more, he was of a temper to receive it,\nunshrinkingly. The moment to fire now arrived; and Elkerton, while\ncocking his pistol, saw the _poss\u00c3\u00a9_ rise out of the gravel-pit; but he\nwas too far gone to be sensible of the seasonable relief; therefore,\nwithout knowing what he was about, he fired his pistol before they could\nseize his arm, and then stood like a statue, nearly insensible of the\nhappiness of his deliverance.\n\nThe justice advancing himself on horseback, now put both the gentlemen\nunder arrest: and Elkerton seeing himself at length safe for the\npresent, thought he might venture to insist on standing Mr. Delamere's\nfire. The more the worthy justice opposed it, the more vehement he grew:\nbut Delamere, who despised him too much to be really angry with him,\nwent off the field, telling Elkerton that any other time, when there\nwere fewer witnesses, he would give him what further satisfaction he\nmight require. He gave his honour to the justice that he would trouble\nhimself no farther about the affair; and Elkerton having given Jackman's\nbail for his present pacific intentions, was suffered to go also.\n\nHe returned to the house of his East Indian friend, exulting secretly in\nhis escape, and openly in his valour, to which latter Jackman did not\nbear testimony so warmly as he thought friendship required. Determined,\nhowever, to lose no part of the glory which he thought he had dearly\npurchased by being frightened out of his wits, he wrote, in the form of\na letter, a most tremendous account of the duel to the daily papers, in\nwhich he described all it's imaginary horrors, and ended with asserting\nvery roundly, that 'Mr. Elkerton had the misfortune dangerously to wound\nthe Hon. Frederic Delamere; and, when this account came away, there were\nno hopes of his recovery.'\n\nHaving secured himself a fame, at least, for two or three days, he set\nout for London to enjoy it; never reflecting on any other consequences\nthan those most flattering to his ridiculous vanity. He knew he should\nbe talked of; and by representing what had _not_ happened, have a fair\nopportunity of telling what _had_, in his own way.\n\nWhen Emmeline, who had never ceased walking about and listening, saw\nDelamere and Fitz-Edward riding quietly across the lawn which led to the\nhouse, she ran eagerly down to meet them: but the idea that Elkerton\nmight possibly be killed checked her joy; and when they came up to her,\nbreathless agitation prevented her asking what she wanted to know.\nDelamere, who saw her so pale and terrified, threw himself instantly\noff his horse and caught her in his arms.\n\n'Has no harm happened, Mr. Delamere?'\n\n'None in the world, my Emmeline. Nobody is hurt so much as you are; tho'\npoor Elkerton was almost as much frightened. Come, pray compose\nyourself--you have not yet the glory to boast of having a life lost\nabout you.'\n\n'Heaven forbid that I ever should!' answered she--'I am grateful that\nthere has been no mischief!--Oh! if I could describe what I have\nsuffered, surely you would never terrify me so again.'\n\nShe could not restrain her tears. Delamere led her into the house;\nwhere, while Mrs. Stafford gave her hartshorn and water, Delamere, at\nher request, related exactly what had happened: and having given\nEmmeline his honour that he would think no more of the affair if\nElkerton did not, the tranquillity of the house seemed to be restored,\nand Delamere and Fitz-Edward were invited to dinner; where great\nalteration in the looks of the latter, was remarked by both the ladies.\nNor was it in looks only that Fitz-Edward was extremely changed.--His\nchearfulness was quite gone; he appeared to be ineffectually struggling\nwith some unconquerable uneasiness; and tho' his soft and insinuating\nmanners were the same, he no longer sought, by a thousand agreeable\nsallies and lively anecdotes, to entertain; or whatever attempt he made\nwas so evidently forced, that it lost it's success. Remarkable for his\ntemperance at table, for which he had often endured the ridicule of his\ncompanions, he now seemed to fly to the bottle, against his inclination,\nas if in hopes to procure himself a temporary supply of spirits.\n\nEvery day after that on which Emmeline and Mrs. Stafford made this\nremark, it's justice was more evident.\n\nWhile Delamere was in the fields, Fitz-Edward would sit whole mornings\nwith Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline, leaning on their work-table, or looking\nover Emmeline, busied with her pencil. Had his marked attention to Mrs.\nStafford continued, she would have seen his behaviour with great alarm;\nbut he no longer paid her those oblique yet expressive compliments of\nwhich he used to be so lavish. It seemed, as if occupied by some other\nobject, he still admired and revered her, and wished to make her the\nconfidant of the sorrow that oppressed him. If they were accidentally\nalone, he appeared on the point of telling her; then suddenly checking\nhimself, he changed the discourse, or abruptly left her; and as he was a\nman whom it was impossible to know without receiving some impressions in\nhis favour, she felt, as well as Emmeline, a pity for him, which they\nwished to be justified in feeling, by hearing that whatever was the\ncause of his unhappiness, he had not brought it on himself by any crime\nthat would make their regard for him blameable.--For Emmeline, tho' she\nknew that it was with no good design he had contributed to Delamere's\ngetting her off, yet could not persuade herself to hate him for it, when\nhe not only humbly solicited her forgiveness, but protested that he was\ntruly rejoiced, as well as astonished at her steadiness and good\nconduct; and would be so far from encouraging any such attempt for the\nfuture, that he would be the first to call Delamere to an account, could\nhe suppose he harboured intentions which he now considered as ungenerous\nand criminal.\n\nThese declarations had made his peace both with Emmeline and her friend;\nand his languid and sentimental conversation, tho' it made him less\nentertaining, did not make him less interesting to either of them.\n\nMr. Stafford, ever in pursuit of some wild scheme, was now gone for a\nfew days into another county, to make himself acquainted with the\nprocess of manuring land with old wigs--a mode of agriculture on which\nMr. Headly had lately written a treatise so convincing, that Mr.\nStafford was determined to adopt it on his own farm as soon as a\nsufficient number of wigs could be procured for the purpose.\n\nDuring this absence, and on the fourth day after Elkerton's exploit, a\nstormy morning had driven Delamere from the fields; who went into Mrs.\nStafford's dressing-room, where he found Fitz-Edward reading Cecilia to\nMrs. Stafford and Miss Mowbray while they sat at work.\n\nMrs. Stafford had her two little boys at her feet; and when Delamere\nappeared, she desired him to take a chair quietly, and not disturb so\nsober a party. But he had not been seated five minutes, before the\nchildren, who were extremely fond of him, crept to him, and he began to\nplay with them and to make such a noise, that Mrs. Stafford laughingly\nthreatened to send all the riotous boys into the nursery together--when\nat that moment Millefleur, who had some time before come down to attend\nhis master, entered the room with a letter which he said came express\nfrom Berkley-square.\n\nDelamere saw that his father's hand had almost illegibly directed it. He\nopened it in fearful haste, and read these words--\n\n\n    'Before this meets you, your mother will probably be no more. A\n  paragraph in the newspaper, in which you are said to have been\n  killed in a duel, threw her into convulsions. I satisfied myself of\n  your safety by seeing the man with whom you fought, but your mother\n  is incapable of hearing it. Unhappy boy! if you would see her\n  alive, come away instantly.\n\n   MONTREVILLE.'\n\n  _Berkley-square, Feb. 29._\n\n\nIt is impossible to say whether the consternation of Emmeline or that of\nDelamere was the greatest. By the dreadful idea of having occasioned his\nmother's death, every other was for a moment absorbed. He flew without\nspeaking down stairs, and into the stable where he had left his horse;\nbut the groom had carried the horse to his own stables, supposing his\nmaster would stay 'till night. Without recollecting that he might take\none of Mr. Stafford's, he ran back into the room where Emmeline was\nweeping in the arms of her friend, and clasping her wildly to his bosom,\nhe exclaimed--'Farewell, Emmeline! Farewell, perhaps, for ever! If I\nlose my mother I shall never forgive _myself_; and shall be a wretch\nunworthy of _you_. Dearest Mrs. Stafford! take care I beseech you of\nher, whatever becomes of me.'\n\nHaving said this, he ran away again without his hat, and darted across\nthe lawn towards his own house, meaning to go thither on foot; but\nFitz-Edward, with more presence of mind, was directing two of Mr.\nStafford's horses to be saddled, with which he soon overtook Delamere;\nand proceeding together to the town, they got into a post-chaise, and\nwent as expeditiously as four horses could take them, towards London.\n\nEqually impetuous in all his feelings, his grief at the supposed\nmisfortune was as violent as it could have been had he been sure that\nthe worst had already happened. He now remembered, with infinite\nself-reproach, how much uneasiness and distress he had occasioned to\nLady Montreville since he left her in November at Audley-Hall without\ntaking leave--and recollecting all her tenderness and affection for him\nfrom the earliest dawn of his memory; her solicitude in his sickness,\nwhen she had attended him herself and given up her rest and health to\ncontribute to his; her partial fondness, which saw merit even in his\nerrors; her perpetual and ardent anxiety for what she believed would\nsecure his happiness--he set in opposition to it his own neglect,\nimpatience, and disobedience; and called himself an unnatural and\nungrateful monster.\n\nFitz-Edward could hardly restrain his extravagant ravings during the\njourney; which having performed as expeditiously as possible, they\narrived in Berkley-square; where, when the porter opened the door to\nthem, Delamere had not courage to ask how his mother did; but on\nFitz-Edward's enquiry, the porter told them she was alive, and not\nworse.\n\nRelieved by this account, Delamere sent to his father to know if he\nmight wait upon him.\n\nHis Lordship answered--\"That he would only see Colonel Fitz-Edward; but\nthat Delamere might come in, to wait 'till his mother's physicians\narrived.\"\n\nLord Montreville was indeed so irritated against Delamere by all the\ntrouble and anxiety he had suffered on his account, that he determined\nto shew his resentment; and in this resolution he was encouraged by Sir\nRichard Crofts, who represented to him that his mother's danger, and his\nfather's displeasure, might together work upon his mind, and induce him\nto renounce an attachment which occasioned to them both so much\nunhappiness.\n\nIt was in this hope that his Lordship refused to see his son; and while\nFitz-Edward went to him, Delamere was shewn into another room, where his\nyoungest sister immediately came to him.\n\nShe received him with rapture mingled with tears; and related to him the\nnature of his mother's illness, which had seized her two days before, on\nher unfortunately taking up a newspaper from the breakfast-table, where\nit was very confidently said that he was mortally wounded in a duel with\na person named Elkerton, of Portland-Place. That Lord Montreville had\nluckily had a letter from Fitz-Edward the day before, (whom he had\nforgiven the part he took in regard to Emmeline on no other condition\nthan that he should go down to him, and give his Lordship an account of\nhis conduct) and that therefore he was less alarmed, tho' very much\nhurried by the paragraph.\n\nHe had, however, gone to Elkerton's house, where he found him very\ncomposedly receiving the enquiries of his friends, and where he insisted\non hearing exactly what had happened.\n\nHis Lordship immediately returned to his wife; but the convulsions had\narisen to so alarming an height, that she was no longer capable of\nhearing him; and she had ever since continued to have, at very short\nintervals, such dreadful fits, as had entirely contracted her left side,\nand left very little hope of her recovery.\n\nDelamere was extremely shocked at this account; and after waiting some\ntime, Fitz-Edward came to him, and told him that his father was\nextremely angry, and absolutely refused to see him or hear his apology,\nunless he would first give his honour that if Lady Montreville should\nsurvive the illness his indiscreet rashness had brought upon her, he\nwould, as soon as she was out of danger, go abroad, and remain there\ntill he should obtain forgiveness for his past errors and leave to\nreturn.\n\nThe heart of Delamere was accessible only by the avenues of affection\nand kindness; compulsion and threats only made him more resolutely\npersist in any favourite project. Sir Richard Crofts therefore, who had\nadvised this measure, shewed but little knowledge of his temper, and\nnever was more mistaken in his politics.\n\nDelamere no sooner heard the message, than he knew with whom it\noriginated; and full of indignation at finding his father governed by a\nman for whom he felt only aversion and contempt, he answered, with great\nasperity--'That he came thither not to solicit any favour, but to see\nhis mother. That he would not be dictated to by the Crofts; but would\nremain in town 'till he knew whether his mother desired to see him; and\nbe ready to wait on his father when he would vouchsafe to treat him as\nhis son.'\n\nHe then shook hands with Fitz-Edward, kissed his sister, and walked out\nof the house, in spite of their united endeavours to detain him. All\nthey could obtain of him was his consent to go to Fitz-Edward's\nlodgings, as he had none of his own ready; from whence he sent\nconstantly every hour to enquire after Lady Montreville.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nEmmeline, in the mean time, remained in great uneasiness at Woodfield.\nDelamere, on his first arrival in town, wrote a short and confused note;\nby which she only learned that Lady Montreville was alive. After some\ndays she received the following letter from Augusta Delamere.\n\n\n    'I will now try, my dearest Emmeline, to give you an account of\n  what has passed here since my brother's arrival.\n\n    'My mother is happily better; knows every body, and speaks more\n  distinctly; her fits return less frequently; and upon the whole, the\n  physicians give us hopes of her recovery, but very little that she\n  will ever be restored to the use of the arm which is contracted.\n\n    'On Friday, in an interval of her fits, Sir Hugh Cathcart and Dr.\n  Gardner, her physicians, proposed that she should see my brother, of\n  whose being living nothing we could any of us say could convince\n  her. She repeated to Dr. Gardner, who staid with her after the other\n  went, that she was deceived.\n\n    'He assured her that she was deceived in nothing but in her sudden\n  and unhappy prepossession; for that Mr. Delamere had never been in\n  the least danger, and was actually in perfect health.\n\n    '\"He is alive!\" cried my mother, mournfully--\"I thank God he is\n  alive; but he knows my illness, and I do not see him--Ah! it is too\n  certain I have lost my son!\"\n\n    '\"You have not been able to see him, my dear madam; but he came up\n  as soon as he heard of your situation, and now waits your commands\n  at Colonel Fitz-Edward's lodgings.--Do you wish to see him?\"\n\n    '\"I do! I do wish to see him! Oh! let him come!\"\n\n    'The agitation of her mind, however, brought on almost instantly a\n  return of the disorder; and before my brother's arrival, she was\n  insensible.\n\n    'Her distorted features; her hands contracted, her eyes glazed and\n  fixed, her livid complexion, and the agonizing expression of her\n  countenance, were at their height when Delamere was desired to go\n  into the room: my father believed that the sight of his mother in\n  such a situation could not but affect the feelings of her son.\n\n    'It did indeed affect him! He stood a moment looking at her in\n  silent terror; then, as if suddenly recollecting that he had been\n  the cause of this dreadful alteration, he turned away, clasped his\n  hands together, and burst into tears.\n\n    'My mother neither saw him or heard his loud sobs. My sister\n  looked at him reproachfully; and apparently to escape from her, he\n  came to me, and taking my hand, kissed it, and asked how long this\n  melancholy scene would last?\n\n    'The physician, who heard the question, said the fit was going\n  off. It did so in a few minutes. She sighed deeply; and seeing the\n  doctor still sitting by her, she asked if he would still perform his\n  promise, and let her see her son?\n\n    'At these words, Delamere stepped forward, and threw himself on\n  his knees by the bed side. He wept aloud; and eagerly kissed his\n  mother's hands, which he bathed in tears.\n\n    'She looked at him with an expression to which no description can\n  do justice; but unable to speak, she seemed struggling to explain\n  herself; and the physician, fearful of such agitation, said--\"There,\n  madam, is Mr. Delamere; not only alive, but willing, I am persuaded,\n  to give you, in regard to his future conduct, any assurances that\n  you require to tranquillise your mind.\"\n\n    '\"No!\" said she, sighing--\"that Delamere is living, I thank\n  heaven!--but for the rest--I have no hopes.\"\n\n    '\"For the rest,\" resumed the doctor, \"he will promise any thing if\n  you will only make yourself easy.\"\n\n    'At this moment my Lord entered--\"You see, Sir,\" said he sternly\n  to Delamere, whom he had not seen since his arrival in London--\"you\n  see to what extremity your madness has reduced your mother.\"\n\n    'Delamere, still on his knees, looked sorrowfully up, as if to\n  enquire what reparation he could make?\n\n    'My father, appearing to understand the question, said--\"If you\n  would not be indeed a parricide, shew Lady Montreville that you have\n  a sense of your errors, and will give her no farther uneasiness.\"\n\n    '\"Do, Frederic,\" cried my sister.\n\n    '\"In what way, Sir?\" said my brother, very mournfully.\n\n    '\"Tell her you will consent to fulfil all her wishes.\"\n\n    '\"Sir,\" said Delamere firmly, \"if to sacrifice my own life would\n  restore my mother's, I would not hesitate; but if what your Lordship\n  means relates to Miss Otley, it is absolutely out of my power.\"\n\n    '\"He is already married, I doubt not,\" sighed my mother.\n\n    '\"Upon my soul I am not.\"\n\n    '\"Come, come,\" cried Dr. Gardner, \"this is going a great deal too\n  far; your Ladyship is but just convinced your son is living, and my\n  Lord here is already talking of other matters. Tell me, madam--what\n  do you wish Mr. Delamere to say?\"\n\n    '\"That he will not marry,\" eagerly interrupted my father, \"but\n  with his mother's consent and mine.\"\n\n    '\"I will not, my Lord,\" said Delamere, sighing.\n\n    '\"That as soon as Lady Montreville is well enough to allow you to\n  leave her, you will go abroad for a twelvemonth or longer if I shall\n  judge it expedient.\"\n\n    '\"I will promise _that_, if your Lordship makes a point of it--if\n  my mother insists upon it. But, my Lord, if at the end of that time\n  Emmeline Mowbray is still single----my Lord, you do not expect\n  unconditional submission--I shall then in my turn hope that you and\n  my mother will make no farther opposition to my wishes.\"\n\n    'My father, who expected no concession from Delamere, had at first\n  asked of him more than he intended to insist on, and now appeared\n  eager to close with the first terms he could obtain. Accepting\n  therefore a delay, instead of a renunciation, he said--\"Well,\n  Delamere, if at the end of a twelvemonth you still insist on\n  marrying Miss Mowbray, I will not oppose it. Lady Montreville, you\n  hear what your son engages for; do you agree to the terms?\"\n\n    'My mother said, very faintly--\"Yes.\"\n\n    'The promise was repeated on both sides before the physician and\n  Fitz-Edward, who came in at the latter part of this scene. My mother\n  seemed reluctantly to accede; complained of extreme faintness; and\n  the scene beginning to grow fatiguing to her, my brother offered to\n  retire. She gave him her hand, which he kissed, and at her desire\n  consented to return to the apartments here which he used to occupy.\n  My mother had that evening another attack; tho' it was much less\n  severe. But as the contraction does not give way to any remedies yet\n  used, the physicians propose sending her to Bath as soon as she is\n  able to bear the journey.\n\n    'Thus, my dearest Emmeline, I have punctually related all you\n  appear so anxious to know, on which I leave you to reflect. My\n  mother now sees my brother every day; but he has desired that\n  nothing may be said of the past; and their conversations are short\n\n    and melancholy. Fitz-Edward has left London; and Frederic told\n  me, last night, that as soon as the physicians pronounce my mother\n  entirely out of danger, he shall go down to you. Ah! my lovely\n  friend! what a trial will his be! But I know _you_ will encourage\n  and support him in the task, however painful, of fulfilling the\n  promise he has given; and my father, who praises you incessantly,\n  says he is _sure_ of it.\n\n                                     Adieu! my dear Miss Mowbray!\n                                    your affectionate and attached,\n                                                    AUGUSTA DELAMERE.'\n\n  _Berkley-square, March 3._\n\n\nA few days after the receipt of this letter, Delamere went down to\nTylehurst. Dejection was visibly marked in his air and countenance; and\nall that Emmeline could say to strengthen his resolution, served only to\nmake him feel greater reluctance. To quit her for twelve months, to\nleave her exposed to the solicitation of rivals who would not fail to\nsurround her, and to hazard losing her for ever, seemed so terrible to\nhis imagination, that the nearer the period of his promised departure\ngrew, the more impossible he thought it to depart.\n\nHis ardent imagination seemed to be employed only in figuring the\nvariety of circumstances which might in that interval arise to separate\nthem for ever; and he magnified these possibilities, till he persuaded\nhimself that nothing but a private marriage could secure her. As he saw\nhow anxious she was that he should strictly adhere to the promises he\nhad given his father, he thought that he might induce her to consent to\nthis expedient, as the only one by which he could reconcile his duty and\nhis love. He therefore took an opportunity, when he had by the\nbitterness of his complaints softened her into tears, to entreat, to\nimplore her to consent to marry him before he went. He urged, that as\nLord and Lady Montreville had both consented to their union at the end\nof the year, if he remained in the same mind, it made in fact no\ndifference to _them_; because he was very sure that his inclinations\nwould not change, and no doubt _could_ arise but from herself. If\ntherefore she determined then to be his, she might as well consent to\nbecome so immediately as to hazard the difficulties which might arise to\ntheir marriage hereafter.\n\nEmmeline, tho' extremely affected by his sorrow, had still resolution\nenough to treat this argument as feeble sophistry, unworthy of him and\nof herself; and positively to refuse her consent to an engagement which\nmilitated against all her assurances to Lord Montreville.\n\nThis decisive rejection of a plan, to which, from the tender pity she\ntestified, he believed he should persuade her to assent, threw him into\none of those transports of agonizing passion which he could neither\nconceal or contend with. He wept; he raved like a madman. He swore he\nwould return to his father and revoke his promise; and the endeavours of\nMrs. Stafford and Emmeline to calm his mind seemed only to encrease the\nemotions with which it was torn.\n\nAfter having exhausted every mode of persuasion in vain, he was obliged\nto relinquish the hope of a secret marriage, and to attempt to obtain\nanother concession, in which he at length succeeded. He told Emmeline,\nthat if she had no wish to quit him entirely, but really meant to reward\nhis long and ardent affection, she could not object to bind herself to\nbecome his wife immediately on his return to England.\n\nEmmeline made every objection she could to this request. But she only\nobjected; for she saw him so hurt, that she had not the resolution to\nwound him anew by a positive refusal. Mrs. Stafford too, moved by his\ngrief and despair, no longer supported her in her reserve; and as\n_their_ steadiness seemed to give way _his_ eagerness and importunity\nencreased, till they allowed him to draw up a promise in these\nwords--'At the end of the term prescribed by Lord Montreville, Emmeline\nMowbray hereby promises to become the wife of Frederic Delamere.'\n\nThis, Emmeline signed with a reluctant and trembling hand; for tho' she\nhad an habitual friendship and affection for Delamere, and preferred him\nto all the men she had yet seen, she thought this not strictly right;\nand felt a pain and repugnance to it's performance, which made her more\nunhappy the longer she reflected on it.\n\nOn Delamere, however, it had a contrary effect. Tho' he still continued\ngreatly depressed at the thoughts of their approaching separation, he\nyet assumed some degree of courage to bear it: and when the day arrived,\nhe bid her adieu without relapsing into those agonies he had suffered\nbefore at the mere idea of it.\n\nHe carried with him a miniature picture of her, and entreated her to\nanswer his letters; which, on the footing they now were, she could not\nrefuse to promise. He then tore himself from her, and went to take leave\nof his mother, who still continued ill at Bath; and from thence to\nLondon, to bid farewel to his father; after which, Fitz-Edward\naccompanied him as far as Harwich, where he embarked for Holland.\n\nAs he had before been the usual tour of France and Italy, he purposed\npassing the summer in visiting Germany, and the winter at Vienna; and\nearly in the spring to set out thro' France on his way home, where he\npurposed being on the 20th of March, when the year which he had promised\nhis father to pass abroad would expire.\n\nLord Montreville, by obtaining this delay thought there was every\nprobability that his attachment to Emmeline would be conquered. And his\nLordship, as well as Lady Montreville, determined to try in the interval\nto procure for Emmeline some unexceptionable marriage which it would not\nbe possible for her to refuse. They imagined, therefore, that their\nuneasiness on this head was over: and Lady Montreville, whose mind was\ngreatly relieved by the persuasion, was long since out of all danger\nfrom the fits which had so severely attacked her; but the contraction of\nher joints which they had occasioned, was still so painful and\nobstinate, that the physicians seemed to apprehend it might be necessary\nto send her Ladyship to the waters of Barege.\n\nIn the mean time, Lord Montreville had obtained a post in administration\nwhich encreased his income and his power. Sir Richard Crofts possessed a\nlucrative employment in the same department; and his eldest son was\nbecome extremely necessary, from his assiduity and attention to\nbusiness, and more than ever a favourite with all Lord Montreville's\nfamily, with whom he almost entirely lived.\n\nA lurking _penchant_ for Fitz-Edward, which had grown up from her\nearliest recollection almost insensibly in the bosom of Miss Delamere,\nhad been long chilled by his evident neglect and indifference: she now\nfancied she hated him, and really preferred Crofts, every way inferior\nas he was.\n\nWhile the want of high birth and a title, which she had been taught to\nconsider as absolutely requisite to happiness, made her repress every\ntendency to a serious engagement, she was extremely gratified by his\nflattery; and when among other young women (from whom he affected not to\nbe able to stifle his unhappy passion,) she was frequently told how\nmuch he was in love with her, she was accustomed to answer--'Ah! poor\nfellow; so he is, and I heartily pity him.'\n\nBut while Lord and Lady Montreville thought Crofts's attendance on their\ndaughters quite without consequence, he and his father insinuated an\nintended connection between him and one of them, with so much art, that\ntho' it never reached the ears of the family it was universally believed\nin the world.\n\nA young nobleman who had passed the greater part of his life in the\narmy, where he had lately signalized himself by his bravery and conduct,\nnow returned to England on being promoted to a regiment; and having some\nbusiness to transact with Lord Montreville in his official capacity, he\nwas invited to the house, and greatly admired both the Miss Delameres,\nwhose parties he now joined at Bath.\n\nCrofts soon afterwards obtaining a short respite from his political\nengagement, went thither also; and tho' Miss Delamere really thought\nLord Westhaven quite unexceptionable, she had been so habituated to\nbehave particularly to Crofts, that she could not now alter it, or\nperhaps was not conscious of the familiar footing on which she allowed\nhim to be with her.\n\nLord Westhaven, who had at first hesitated between the sprightly dignity\nof the elder sister, and the soft and more bewitching graces of the\nyounger, no sooner saw the conduct of Miss Delamere towards Crofts, than\nhis doubts were at an end. Her faults of temper had been hitherto\nconcealed from him, and he believed her heart as good as her sister's;\nindeed, according to the sentimental turn her discourse frequently took,\nhe might have supposed it more refined and sublime. But when he observed\nher behaviour to Crofts, he thought that she must either be secretly\nengaged to him, or be a decided coquet. Turning therefore all his\nattention to Augusta, he soon found that her temper was as truly good as\nher person was interesting, and that the too great timidity of her\nmanner was solely owing to her being continually checked by her mother's\npartiality to her sister.\n\nA very short study of her character convinced him she was exactly the\nwoman calculated to make him happy. He told her so; and found her by no\nmeans averse to his making the same declaration to her father and\nmother.\n\nLord Montreville received it with pleasure; and preliminaries were soon\nsettled. In about six weeks, Lord Westhaven and Miss Augusta Delamere\nwere married at Bath, to the infinite satisfaction of all parties except\nMiss Delamere; who could not be very well pleased with the preference\nshewn her younger sister by a man whose morals, person, and fortune,\nwere all superior to what even her own high spirit had taught her to\nexpect in a husband.\n\nCrofts, tho' he saw all apprehensions of having Lord Westhaven for a\nrival were at an end, could not help fearing that so advantageous a\nmatch for the younger, might make the elder more unwilling to accept a\nsimple commoner with a fortune greatly inferior.\n\nThe removal, however, of Lady Westhaven gave him more frequent\nopportunities to urge his passion. Lady Montreville was now going to\nBarege, Bath having been found less serviceable than was at first hoped\nfor; and Delamere was written to to meet her Ladyship and her eldest\ndaughter at Paris, in order to accompany them thither.\n\nPeace having been in the interim established, Lord Westhaven found he\nshould return no more to his regiment, and purposed with his wife to\nattend Lady Montreville part of the way, and then to go into\nSwitzerland, where his mother's family resided, who had been of that\ncountry.\n\nLady Westhaven was extremely gratified by this scheme; not only because\nshe was delighted to wait on her mother, but because she hoped it would\nhelp to dissipate a lurking uneasiness which hung over the spirits of\nher Lord, and which he told her was owing to the uncertain and\ndistressing situation of a beloved sister. But whenever the subject was\nmentioned, he expressed so much unhappiness, that his wife had not yet\nhad resolution to enquire into the nature of her misfortunes, and only\nknew in general that she was unfortunately married.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nEmmeline had now lost her lover, at least for some time; and one of her\nfriends too was gone where she could seldom hear of her. These\ndeprivations attached her more closely than ever to Mrs. Stafford. Mr.\nStafford was gone to town; and except now and then a short and\nmelancholy visit from Fitz-Edward, to whom Delamere had lent his house\nat Tylehurst, they saw nobody; for all the neighbouring families were in\nLondon. They found not only society but happiness together enough to\ncompensate for almost every other; and passed their time in a way\nparticularly adapted to the taste of both.\n\nAdjoining to the estate where Mrs. Stafford resided, a tract of forest\nland, formerly a chase and now the property of a collegiate body, deeply\nindents the arable ground beyond it, and fringes the feet of the green\ndowns which rise above it. This part of the country is called Woodbury\nForest; and the deep shade of the beech trees with which it is covered,\nis broken by wild and uncultured glens; where, among the broom, hawthorn\nand birch of the waste, a few scattered cottages have been built upon\nsufferance by the poor for the convenience of fewel, so amply afforded\nby the surrounding woods. These humble and obscure cabbins are known\nonly to the sportsman and the woodcutter; for no road whatever leads\nthrough the forest: and only such romantic wanderers as Mrs. Stafford\nand Emmeline, were conscious of the beautiful walks which might be found\namong these natural shrubberies and solitary shades. The two friends\nwere enjoying the softness of a beautiful April morning in these woods,\nwhen, in passing near one of the cottages, they saw, at a low casement\nhalf obscured by the pendant trees, a person sitting, whose dress and\nair seemed very unlike those of the usual inhabitants of such a place.\nShe was intent on a paper, over which she leaned in a melancholy\nposture; but on seeing the two ladies approach, she started up and\nimmediately disappeared.\n\nTho' the distance at which they saw her, and the obscurity of the\nwindow, prevented their distinguishing the features of the stranger,\nthey saw that she was young, and they fancied she was beautiful. The\nsame idea instantly occurred to Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline; that it was\nsome unfortunate young woman, whom Mr. Stafford had met with and had\nconcealed there. Something of the same sort had happened once before,\nand Mrs. Stafford's anxiety and curiosity were both awakened by this\nincident. Tho' the latter was a passion she never indulged where it's\nobject was the business of others, she could not repress it where it was\nexcited by suspicion of a circumstance which so nearly concerned\nherself.\n\nNor could she conceal from Emmeline her fears on this occasion; and\nEmmeline, tho' unwilling to encrease them, yet knew enough of her\nhusband's conduct to believe they were too well founded.\n\nMrs. Stafford had been accustomed to buy poultry of the woman who lived\nat this cottage, and therefore went in, in hopes of finding some vestige\nof the person they had seen, which might lead to an enquiry. But they\nfound nothing but the usual humble furniture and few conveniences of\nsuch an house; and Mrs. Stafford forbore to enquire, lest the person she\nhad seen might be alarmed and take more effectual means of concealment.\nBut unable to rest, and growing every moment more desirous to know the\ntruth, and to know it before her husband, whom she expected in a few\ndays, returned, she arose very early the next morning, and, accompanied\nby Emmeline, went to the cottage in the forest.\n\nThe man who inhabited it was already gone out to his work, and the woman\nto a neighbouring town to buy necessaries for her family. The door was\nopen; and the ladies received this intelligence from three little\nchildren who were playing before it.\n\nThey entered the low, smoky room, usually inhabited by the family. And\nMrs. Stafford, with a beating heart, determining to be satisfied, opened\na door which led from it, into that, at the window of which she knew the\nstranger had appeared; and which the people of the house dignified with\nthe appellation of their parlour.\n\nIn this room, on the brick floor, and surrounded by bare walls, stood a\nbed, which seemed to have been brought thither for the accommodation of\nsome person who had not been accustomed to such an apartment.\n\nMrs. Stafford saw, sleeping in it, a very young woman, pale, but\nextremely beautiful; and her hand, of uncommon delicacy, lay on the\nwhite quilt--A sight, which gave her pain for herself, and pity for the\nunfortunate person before her, affected her so much, that having stood a\nmoment in astonishment, she stepped back to the place where Emmeline\nsat, and burst into tears.\n\nThe noise, however trifling, brought from above stairs a person\nevidently a lady's maid, of very creditable appearance, who came down\nhastily into the room where Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline were, saying, as\nshe descended the stairs--'I am coming immediately, my Lady.' But at the\nsight of two strangers, she stopped in great confusion; and at the same\nmoment her mistress called to her.\n\nShe hastened, without speaking, to attend the summons; and shut the door\nafter her. After remaining a few moments, she came out again, and asked\nMrs. Stafford if she wanted the woman of the house?\n\nTo which Mrs. Stafford, determined whatever it cost her to know the\ntruth, said--'No--my business is with your lady.'\n\nThe woman now appeared more confused than before; and said,\nhesitatingly--'I--I--my lady--I fancy you are mistaken, madam.'\n\n'Go in, however, and let your mistress know that Mrs. Stafford desires\nto speak to her.'\n\nThe maid reluctantly and hesitatingly went in, and after staying some\ntime, came back.\n\n'My mistress, Madam, says she has not the pleasure of knowing you; and\nbeing ill, and in bed, she hopes you will excuse her if she desires you\nwill acquaint her with your business by me.'\n\n'No,' replied Mrs. Stafford, 'I must see her myself. Tell her my\nbusiness is of consequence to us both, and that I will wait till it is\nconvenient to her to speak to me.'\n\nWith this message the maid went back, with looks of great consternation,\nto her mistress. They fancied they heard somebody sigh and weep\nextremely. The maid came out once or twice and carried back water and\nhartshorn.\n\nAt length, after waiting near half an hour, the door opened, and the\nstranger appeared, leaning on the arm of her woman. She wore a long,\nwhite muslin morning gown, and a large muslin cap almost concealed her\nface; her dark hair seemed to escape from under it, to form a decided\ncontrast to the extreme whiteness of her skin; and her long eye lashes\nhid her eyes, which were cast down, and which bore the marks of recent\ntears. If it were possible to personify languor and dejection, it could\nnot be done more expressively than by representing her form, her air,\nher complexion, and the mournful cast of her very beautiful countenance.\n\nShe slowly approached Mrs. Stafford, lifted up her melancholy eyes to\nEmmeline, and attempted to speak.\n\n'I am at a loss to know, ladies,' said she, 'what can be your'----But\nunable to finish the sentence, she sat down, and seemed ready to faint.\nThe maid held her smelling bottle to her.\n\n'I waited on you, Madam,' said Mrs. Stafford, 'supposing you were\nacquainted--too well acquainted--with my name and business.'\n\n'No, upon my honour,' said the young person, 'I cannot even guess.'\n\n'You are very young,' said Mrs. Stafford, 'and, I fear, very\nunfortunate. Be assured I wish not either to reproach or insult you; but\nonly to try if you cannot be prevailed upon to quit a manner of life,\nwhich surely, to a person of your appearance, must be dreadful.'\n\n'It is indeed dreadful!' sighed the young woman--'nor is it the least\ndreadful part of it that I am exposed to this.'\n\nShe now fell into an agony of tears; which affected both Mrs. Stafford\nand Emmeline so much, that forgetting their fears and suspicions, they\nboth endeavoured tenderly to console her. Having in some measure\nsucceeded, and Mrs. Stafford having summoned resolution to tell her what\nwere her apprehensions, the stranger saw that to give her a simple\ndetail of her real situation was the only method she had to satisfy her\ndoubts, and to secure her compassion and secresy; for which reason she\ndetermined to do it; and Mrs. Stafford, whose countenance was all\ningenuousness as well as her heart, assured her she should never repent\nher confidence; while Emmeline, whose looks and voice were equally\nsoothing and engaging to the unhappy, expressed the tenderest interest\nin the fate of a young creature who seemed but little older than\nherself, and to have been thrown from a very different sphere into her\npresent obscure and uncomfortable manner of life.\n\nThe stranger would have attempted to relate her history to them\nimmediately; but her maid, a steady woman of three or four and thirty,\ntold her that she was certainly unable then, and begged the ladies not\nto insist upon it till the evening, or the next day; adding--'My Lady\nhas been very poorly indeed all this week, and is continually fainting\naway; and you see, ladies, how much she has been frightened this\nmorning, and I am sure she will not be able to go through it.'\n\nTo the probability of this observation, the two friends assented; and\nthe young lady naming the next morning to gratify their curiosity, they\nleft her, Mrs. Stafford first offering her any thing her house afforded.\nTo which she replied, that at present she was tolerably well supplied,\nand only conjured them to observe the strictest secresy, without which,\nshe said, she was undone.\n\nAt the appointed time they returned; equally eager to hear, and, if\npossible, to relieve, the sorrows of this young person, for whom they\ncould not help being interested, tho' they yet knew not how far she\ndeserved their pity.\n\nShe had prepared her own little room as well as it would admit of to\nreceive them, and sat waiting their arrival with some degree of\ncomposure. They contemplated with concern the ruins of eminent beauty\neven in early youth, and saw an expression of helpless sorrow and\nincurable unhappiness, which had greatly injured the original lustre and\nbeauty of her eyes and countenance. A heavy languor hung on her whole\nframe. She tried to smile; but it was a smile of anguish; and their\nlooks seemed to distress and pain her. Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline, to\nrelieve her, took out their work; and when they were seated at it, she\nhesitated--then sighed and hesitated again--and at length seemed to\nenter on her story with desperate and painful resolution, as if to get\nquickly and at once thro' a task which, however necessary, was extremely\ndistressing. She began in a low and plaintive voice; and frequently\nstopped to summon courage to continue, while she wiped away the tears\nthat slowly fell from her eyes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n'I cannot believe I shall ever repent the confidence I am about to place\nin you. My heart assures me I shall not. Perhaps I may find that pity I\ndare no longer solicit from my own family; perhaps--but I must hasten to\ntell you my melancholy story, before its recollection again overwhelms\nme. Yet my fate has nothing in it very singular; numbers have been\nvictims of the same calamity, but some have been more easily forgiven\nthan I shall be.--Some are better able to bear infamy, and be reconciled\nto disgrace.\n\n'My father, the late Earl of Westhaven, during the life of my\ngrandfather, married, while he was making the tour of Europe, a very\nbeautiful and amiable woman, the daughter of a man of rank in\nSwitzerland; who having lost his life in the French service, had left a\nfamily without any provision, except for the eldest son. My grandfather,\nextremely disobliged by this marriage, made a will by which he gave to\nhis only daughter every part of his extensive property, except what was\nentailed, and which went with the title; with this reserve, that his\ngrandson should claim and inherit the whole, whenever he became Lord\nWesthaven. By this will, he disinherited my father for his life; and\ntho' he survived my father's marriage five years, and knew he had three\nchildren, the two younger of whom must be inevitably impoverished by\nsuch a disposition, he obstinately refused to alter the will he made\nunder the first impulse of resentment, and died before his son could\nprevail upon him, by means of their general friends, to withdraw the\nmaledictions with which he had loaded him.\n\n'His death, not only hurt my father in his feelings, but irreparably in\nhis fortune. His sister, who was married to a Scottish nobleman, took\npossession of estates to the amount of fifteen thousand a year; and all\nthat remained to my father, to support his rank and his encreasing\nfamily, was little more than three thousand; and even that income he had\nconsiderably diminished, by taking up money, which he was obliged to do\nwhile my grandfather lived, for the actual maintenance of his family.\n\n'These unhappy circumstances, while they injured the health and spirits\nof my father, diminished not his tenderness for his wife, whom he loved\nwith unabated passion.\n\n'To retrench as much as possible, he retired with her and his three\nchildren to an estate, which being attached to the title, belonged to\nhim in Cumberland; in hopes of being able to live on the income he had\nleft, and to clear off the burden with which he had been compelled to\nload his paternal estates. But a slow fever, the effect of sorrow, had\nseized on my mother, then far advanced in her pregnancy with me; my\nfather, solicitous to save her in whom all his happiness was centered,\nsent to London for the best advice to attend her. But their assistance\nwas vain; the fever encreased upon her, and she died three weeks after\nmy birth, leaving my father deprived of every thing that could make life\nvaluable in his estimation. He gave himself up to a despair equal to the\nviolence of his love, and would probably have fallen a victim to it, had\nnot the servants sent to Mr. Thirston, who had been his tutor, and for\nwhom he had the greatest friendship and respect. This excellent man\nrepresented to him that it was his duty to live for the children of his\ndeplored Adelina; and he consented to try to live.\n\n'It was long before he could bear to see any of us; particularly me,\nwhom he beheld with a mixture of tenderness and regret. The gloomy\nsolitude in which he lived, where every object reminded him of her whose\nsmiles had rendered it a paradise, was ill calculated to meliorate his\naffliction; but he could not be persuaded, for some months, to leave it,\nor could he be diverted from going every evening to visit the spot where\nlay the relicts of his Adelina.\n\n'At length Mr. Thirston prevailed on him to go abroad. But he could not\ndetermine to leave my elder brother, then about five years old, of whom\nhe was passionately fond. They embarked for Naples; and he remained\nabroad five years; while my sister, my brother William, and myself, were\nleft at Kensington, under the care of a female relation, and received\nsuch instruction as our ages admitted.\n\n'My father returned to England only to place his eldest son at Eton.\nFinding no relief from the sorrow which perpetually preyed on him, but\nin continual change of place, he soon afterwards went again abroad, and\nwandered over Europe for almost seven years longer, returning once or\ntwice to England in that interval to satisfy himself of our health and\nthe progress of our education.\n\n'When he last returned, my elder brother, then near eighteen, desired to\nbe allowed to go into the army. My father reluctantly consented; and the\nregiment into which he purchased was soon after ordered abroad. The\ngrief the departure of his son gave him, was somewhat relieved by seeing\nhis elder daughter advantageously disposed of in marriage to the eldest\nson of an Irish peer. The beauty of Lady Camilla was so conspicuous, and\nher manners so charming, that though entirely without fortune, the\nfamily of her husband could not object to the marriage. She went to\nIreland with her Lord; and it was long before I saw her again.\n\n'My brother William, who had always been designed for the navy, left me\nalso for a three years station in the Mediterranean; and I was now\nalways alone with my governess and my old relation, whose temper, soured\nby disappointment and not naturally chearful, made her a very unpleasant\ncompanion for a girl of fourteen. I learned, from masters who attended\nme from London, all the usual accomplishments; but of the world I knew\nnothing, and impatiently waited for the time when I should be sixteen;\nfor then the Dutchess of B----, who had kindly undertaken to introduce\nmy sister into company, had promised that she would afford me also her\ncountenance. I remember she smiled, and told me that as I was not less\npretty than Lady Camilla, I might probably have as good fortune, if I\nwas but as accomplished. To be accomplished, therefore, I endeavoured\nwith all my power; but the time seemed insupportably long, before this\nessay was to be made. It was relieved, tho' mournfully, by frequent\nvisits from my father; who was accustomed to sit whole hours looking at\nme, while his tears bore witness to the great resemblance I had to my\nmother. My voice too, particularly when we conversed in French,\nfrequently made him start, as if he again heard that which he had never\nceased to remember and to regret. He would then fondly press me to his\nheart, and call me his poor orphan girl, the image of his lost Adelina!\n\n'Tho' my mother had been now dead above fifteen years, his passion for\nher memory seemed not at all abated. He had, by a long residence abroad,\npaid off the debts with which he had incumbered his income, but could do\nno more; and the expences necessary for young men of my brothers' rank\npressed hardly upon him. Ever since his return to England, his friends\nhad entreated him to attempt, by marrying a woman of fortune, to repair\nthe deficiency of his own; representing to him, that to provide for the\nchildren of his Adelina, would be a better proof of his affection to her\nmemory than indulging a vain and useless regret.\n\n'He had however long escaped from their importunity by objecting, on\nsome pretence or other, to all the great fortunes which were pointed out\nto him--his heart rejected with abhorrence every idea of a second\nmarriage. But my brothers every day required a larger supply of money to\nsupport them as their birth demanded; and to their interest my father at\nlength determined to sacrifice the remainder of a life, which had on his\nown account no longer any value. The heiress of a rich grocer in the\ncity was soon discovered by his assiduous friends, who was reputed to be\npossessed of two hundred thousand pounds. On closer enquiry, the sum was\nfound to be very little if at all exaggerated by fame. Miss Jobson, with\na tall, meagre person, a countenance bordering on the horrible, and\narmed with two round black eyes which she fancied beautiful, had seen\nher fortieth year pass, while she attended on her papa, in\nLeadenhall-street, or was dragged by two sleek coach horses to and from\nHornsey. Rich as her father was, he would not part with any thing while\nhe lived; and, by the assistance of two maiden sisters, had so guarded\nhis daughter from the dangerous attacks of Irishmen and younger\nbrothers, that she had reached that mature period without hearing the\nsoothing voice of flattery, to which she was extremely disposed to\nlisten. My father, yet in middle age, and with a person remarkably fine,\nwould have been greatly to her taste if he could have gratified, with a\nbetter grace, her love of admiration. But his friends undertook to\ncourt her for him; and his title still more successfully pleaded in his\nfavour. She made some objection to his having a family; but as I alone\nremained at home, she at length agreed to undertake to be at once a\nmother-in-law and a Countess. While this treaty was going on, and\nsettlements and jewels preparing, I was taken several times to wait on\nMiss Jobson: but it was easy to see I had not the good fortune to please\nher.\n\n'I was but just turned of fifteen, was full of gaiety and vivacity, and\npossessed those personal advantages, which, if _she_ ever had any share\nof them, were long since faded. She seemed conscious that the splendour\nof her first appearance would be eclipsed by the unadorned simplicity of\nmine; and she hated me because it was not in my power to be old and\nugly. Giddy as I then was, nothing but respect for my father prevented\nmy repaying with ridicule, the supercilious style in which she usually\ntreated me. Her vulgar manners, and awkward attempts to imitate those of\npeople of fashion, excited my perpetual mirth; and as her dislike of me\ndaily encreased, I am afraid I did not always conceal the contempt I\nfelt in return. Miss Jobson chose to pass some time at Tunbridge\nprevious to her marriage. Thither my father followed her; and I went\nwith him, eager to make my first appearance in public, and to see\nwhether the prophecies of the Duchess would be fulfilled.\n\n'This experiment was made in a party from Tunbridge to Lewes Races,\nwhere I had the delight of dancing for the first time in public, and of\nseeing the high and old fashioned little head of Miss Jobson, who\naffected to do something which she thought was dancing also, almost at\nthe end of the set, while I, as an Earl's daughter, was nearly at the\ntop. Had I been ever accustomed to appear in public, these distinctions\nwould have been too familiar to have given me any pleasure; but now they\nwere enchanting; and, added to the universal admiration I excited,\nintoxicated me with vanity. My partner, who had been introduced to me by\na man of high rank the moment I entered the room, was a gentleman from\nthe West of England, who was just of age, and entered into the\npossession of a fortune of eight thousand a year.\n\n'Mr. Trelawny (for that was his name) followed us to Tunbridge, and\nfrequently danced with me afterwards. Educated in obscurity, and without\nany prospect of the fortune to which he succeeded by a series of\nimprobable events, this young man had suddenly emerged into life. He\nwas tolerably handsome; but had a heavy, unmeaning countenance, and was\nquite unformed. Several men of fashion, however, were kind enough to\nundertake to initiate him into a good style of living; and for every\nthing that bore the name of fashion and ton, he seemed to have a violent\nattachment. To that, I owed his unfortunate prepossession in my\nfavour.--I was admired and followed by men whom he had been taught to\nconsider as the arbiters of elegance, and supreme judges of beauty and\nfashion; but they could only admire--they could not afford to marry an\nindigent woman of quality; and they told Trelawny that they envied him\nthe power of pleasing himself.--So Trelawny was talked to about me, till\nhe believed he was in love. In this persuasion he procured a statement\nof his fortune to be shewn to my father, by one of his friends, and made\nan offer to lay it at my feet; an offer which, tho' my father would have\nbeen extremely glad to have me accept, he answered by referring Mr.\nTrelawny to me.\n\n'I suspected no such thing; but with the thoughtless inattention of\nsixteen, remembered little of the fine things which were said to me by\nTrelawny at the last ball. While I was busied in inventing a new\n_chapeau_ for the next, at which I intended to do more than usual\nexecution, my father introduced Mr. Trelawny, and left the room. I\nconcluded he was come to engage me for the evening, and felt disposed to\nrefuse him out of pure coquetry; when, with an infinite number of\nblushes, and after several efforts, he made me in due form an offer of\nhis heart and fortune. I had never thought of any thing so serious as\nmatrimony; and indeed was but just out of the nursery, where I had never\nbeen told it was necessary to think at all. I did not very well know\nwhat to say to my admirer; and after the first speech, which I believe\nhe had learned by heart, he knew almost as little what to say to me; and\nhe was not sorry when I, in a great fright, referred him to my father,\nmerely because I knew not myself what answer to give him. Our\nconversation ended, and he went to find my father, while I, for the\nfirst time in my life, began to reflect on my prospects, and to consider\nwhether I preferred marrying Mr. Trelawny to living with Miss Jobson. To\nMiss Jobson, I had a decided aversion; for Mr. Trelawny, I felt neither\nlove or hatred. My mind was not made up on the subject, when my father\ncame to me: he had seen Trelawny, and expressed himself greatly pleased\nwith the prudence and propriety of my answer.\n\n'\"My Adelina knows,\" continued he, \"that the happiness of my children is\nthe only wish I have on earth; and I may tell her, too, that my\nsolicitude for her exceeds all my other cares--solicitude, which will be\nat an end if I can see her in the protection of a man of honour and\nfortune. If therefore, my love, you really do not disapprove this young\nman, whose fortune is splendid, and of whose character I have received\nthe most favourable accounts, I shall have a weight removed from my\nmind, and enjoy all the tranquillity I can hope for on this side the\ngrave.\n\n'\"You know how soon I am to marry Miss Jobson. A mother-in-law is seldom\nbeloved. I may die, and leave you unprovided for; for you know, Adelina,\nthe circumstances into which your grandfather's will has thrown me. Our\ndear Charles, whenever he inherits my title, will repossess the fortune\nof my ancestors, and will, I am sure, act generously by you and William;\nbut such a dependance, if not precarious, is painful; and by accepting\nthe proposal of Mr. Trelawny, all my apprehensions will be at an end,\nand my Adelina secure of that affluence to which her merit as well as\nher birth entitles her. But powerful as these considerations are, let\nthem not influence you if you feel any reluctance to the match. Were\nthey infinitely stronger, I will never again name them, if in doing so I\nhazard persuading my daughter to a step which may render her for every\nunhappy.\"\n\n'Tho' I was very far from feeling for Mr. Trelawny that decided\npreference which would in other circumstances have induced me to accept\nhis hand, yet I found my father so desirous of my being settled, that as\nI had no aversion to the man, I could not resolve to disappoint him.\nPerhaps the prospect of escaping from the power of my mother-in-law, and\nof being mistress of an affluent fortune instead of living in mortifying\ndependance on her, might have too much influence on my heart. My father,\nhowever, obtained without any difficulty my consent to close with Mr.\nTrelawny's proposals. We all went to London, where Lord Westhaven\nmarried Miss Jobson, and the settlements were preparing by which Mr.\nTrelawny secured to me a jointure as great as I could have expected if\nmy fortune had been equal to my rank.\n\n'As the new Lady Westhaven was so soon to be relieved from the presence\nof a daughter she did not love, she behaved to me with tolerable\ncivility. Occupied with her rank, she seemed to have infinite delight in\ndisplaying it to her city acquaintance. Her Ladyship thought a coronet\nso delightful an ornament, that the meanest utensils in her house were\nadorned with it; and she wore it woven or worked on all her cloaths, in\nthe vain hope perhaps of counteracting the repelling effect of an\nhideous countenance, a discordant voice, and a manner more vulgar than\neither. I saw with concern that my father was not consoled by the\npossession of her great fortune, for the mortification of having given\nthe name and place of his adored Adelina to a woman so unlike her in\nmind and person. He was seldom well; seldomer at home; and seemed to\nhave no other delight than in hearing from his two sons and from his\neldest daughter; and when we were alone, he told me that to see me\nmarried would also give him pleasure; but he appeared, I thought, less\nanxious for the match than when it was first proposed. The preparations,\nhowever, went on, and in six weeks were compleated.\n\n'In that interval, I had seen Trelawny almost every day. He always\nseemed very good humoured, and was certainly very thoughtless. He loved\nme, or fancied he loved me, extremely; but I sometimes suspected that it\nwas rather in compliance with the taste of others than his own; and that\na favourite hunter or a famous pointer were very likely to rival me. My\nfather sometimes laughed at his boyish fondness for such things, and the\nimportance he annexed to them; and sometimes I thought he looked grave\nand hurt at observing it.\n\n'For my own part, I saw his follies; but none that I did not equally\nperceive in the conduct of other young men. Tho' I had no absolute\npartiality to him, I was totally indifferent to every other man. I\nmarried him, therefore; and gave away my person before I knew I had an\nheart.\n\n'We went immediately into Cornwall, to an old fashioned but magnificent\nfamily seat; where I was received by Mr. Trelawny's sister, a woman some\nyears older than he was, and who had brought him up. The coarse\nconversation of this woman, which consisted entirely in details of\nfamily oeconomy; and the stupidity of her husband and a booby son of\nfourteen, were but ill calculated to render my retirement pleasing.\nHaving laughed and wondered once at the uncouth figures and obsolete\nnotions of Mr. Trelawny's Cornish cousins, who hastened, in their best\ncloaths, to congratulate him, from places whose barbarous names I could\nnot pronounce--and having twice entertained the voters of two boroughs\nwhich belonged to the family; I had exhausted all the delights of\nCornwall, and prevailed on him to return to a country where I could see\na few beings like myself.\n\n'When I came back into the world, I was surrounded by a croud of idle\npeople, whose admiration flattered the vanity of Trelawny more than it\ndid mine; for I became accustomed to adulation, and it lost it's charms\nwith it's novelty. Trelawny was continually with young men of fashion,\nwho called themselves his friends; and who besides doing him the\nkindness to advise and instruct him in the disposal of his fortune,\nwould have relieved him from the affections of his wife, if he had ever\npossessed them. They made love to _me_, with as little scruple as they\nborrowed money of _him_; and told me that neglect on the part of my\nhusband, well deserved to be repaid with infidelity on mine: but I felt\nfor these shallow libertines only disgust and contempt; and received\ntheir professions with so much coldness, that they left me, in search of\nsome other giddy creature, who might not, by ill-timed prudery, belie\nthe promise of early coquetry. It was yet however very much the fashion\nto admire me; and my husband seemed still to take some delight in\nhearing and reading in the daily papers that Lady Adelina Trelawny was\nthe most elegant figure at Court, or that every beauty at the Opera was\neclipsed on _her_ entrance. The eagerness and avidity with which I had\nentered, from the confinement of the nursery, to a life of continual\ndissipation, was now considerably abated. I continued it from habit, and\nbecause I knew not how to employ my time otherwise; but I felt a dreary\nvacuity in my heart; and amid splendor and admiration was unhappy.\n\n'The return of my elder brother from his first campaign in America, was\nthe only real pleasure I had long felt. He is perhaps one of the most\nelegant and accomplished young men of his time; but to be elegant and\naccomplished is his least praise--His solid understanding, and his\nexcellent heart, are an honour to his country and to human nature. That\nquick sense of honour, and that strictness of principle, which now make\nmy greatest terror, give a peculiar lustre and dignity to his character.\nMy father received him with that delight a father only can feel; and saw\nand gloried with all a father's pride, in a successor worthy of his\nancestors.\n\n'My brother, who had always loved me extremely, tho' we had been very\nlittle together, took up his abode at my house while he staid in\nEngland. Trelawny seemed to feel a sort of awe before him, which made\nhim endeavour to hide his vices if not his weakness, while he remained\nwith us. He was more attentive to me than he had long been. My brother\nhoped I was happy; and tho' Trelawny was a man whose conversation\nafforded him no pleasure, he behaved to him with every appearance of\nfriendship and regard. He was soon however to return to his regiment;\nand my father, who had been in a declining state of health ever since\nhis second marriage, appeared to grow worse as the period of separation\napproached. He seemed to have waited only for this beloved son to close\nhis eyes; for a few days before he was again to take leave, my father\nfound his end very rapidly approaching.\n\n'Perfectly conscious of it, he settled all his affairs; and made a\nprovision for me and my brother William out of the money of the present\nLady Westhaven, which the marriage articles gave him a right to dispose\nof after her Ladyship's death if he left no children by her; and\nrecommended us both to his eldest son.\n\n'\"You will act nobly by our dear William,\" said he; \"I have no doubt of\nit; but above all, remember my poor Adelina. Camilla is happily married.\nTell her I die blessing her, and her children! But Adelina--my\nunfortunate Adelina is herself but a child, and her husband is very\nyoung and thoughtless. Watch over her honour and her repose, for the\nsake of your father and that dear woman she so much resembles, your\nsainted mother.\"\n\n'I was in the room, in an agony of sorrow. He called me to him. \"My\ndaughter,\" said he, in a feeble voice, \"remember that the honour of your\nfamily--of your brothers--is in your hands--and remember it is\nsacred.--Endeavour to deserve the happiness of being sister to such\nbrothers, and daughter to such a mother as yours was!\"\n\n'I was unable to answer. I could only kiss his convulsed hands; which I\neagerly did, as if to tell him that I promised all he expected of me. My\nown heart, which then made the vow, now perpetually reproaches me with\nhaving kept it so ill!\n\n'A few hours afterwards, my father died. My brother, unable to announce\nto me the melancholy tidings, took my hand in silence, and led me out of\nthe house, which was now Lady Westhaven's. He had only a few days to\nstay in England, which he employed in paying the last mournful duties to\nhis father; and then embarked again for America, leaving his affairs to\nbe settled by my sister's husband, Lord Clancarryl, to whom he wrote to\ncome over from Ireland; for my brother William was now stationed in the\nWest Indies, where he obtained the command of a man of war; and my\nbrother Westhaven knew, that to leave any material business to Trelawny,\nwas to leave it to ignorance and imbecility.\n\n'In my husband, I had neither a friend or a companion--I had not even a\nprotector; for except when he was under the restraint of my brother's\npresence, he was hardly ever at home. Sometimes he was gone on tours to\ndistant counties to attend races or hunts, to which he belonged; and\nsometimes to France, where he was embarked in gaming associations with\nEnglishmen who lived only to disgrace their name. Left to pass my life\nas the wife of such a man as Trelawny, I felt my brother's departure as\nthe deprivation of all I loved. But the arrival of my sister and her\nhusband relieved me. I had not seen them for some years; and was\ndelighted to meet my sister happy with a man so worthy and respectable\nas Lord Clancarryl.\n\n'He took possession on behalf of my brother of the estate my aunt was\nnow obliged to resign; and as my sister was impatient to return to\nIreland, where she had left her children, they pressed me extremely to\ngo thither with them. Trelawny was gone out on one of his rambles; but I\nwrote to him and obtained his consent--indeed he long since ceased to\ntrouble himself about me.\n\n'I attended my sister therefore to Lough Carryl; on the beautiful banks\nof which her Lord had built an house, which possessing as much\nmagnificence as was proper to their rank, was yet contrived with an\nattention to all the comforts of domestic retirement. Here Lady\nClancarryl chose to reside the whole year; and my Lord never left it but\nto attend the business of Parliament at Dublin.\n\n'His tender attention to his wife; his ardent, yet regulated fondness\nfor his children; the peace and order which reigned in his house; the\ndelightful and easy society he sometimes collected in it, and the\nchearful confidence we enjoyed in quiet family parties when without\ncompany; made me feel with bitterness and regret the difference between\nmy sister's lot and mine. _Her_ husband made it the whole business of\nhis life to fulfill every duty of his rank, _mine_ seemed only\nsolicitous to degrade himself below his. One was improving his fortune\nby well regulated oeconomy; the other dissipating his among gamesters\nand pick-pockets. The conversation of Lord Clancarryl was sensible,\nrefined, and improving; Trelawny's consisted either in tiresome details\nof adventures among jockies, pedigrees of horses, or scandalous and\nsilly anecdotes about persons of whom nobody wished to hear; or he sunk\ninto sullen silence, yawned, and shewed how very little relish he had\nfor any other discourse.\n\n'When I married him, I knew not to what I had condemned myself. As his\ncharacter gradually discovered itself, my reason also encreased; and\nnow, when I had an opportunity of comparing him to such a man as Lord\nClancarryl, I felt all the horrors of my destiny! and beheld, with a\ndread from which my feeble heart recoiled, a long, long prospect of life\nbefore me--without attachment, without friendship, without love.\n\n'I remained two months in Ireland; and heard nothing of Trelawny, 'till\na match having been made on the Curragh of Kildare, on which he had a\nlarge bet depending, he came over to be present at it; and I heard with\nregret that I was to return with him. While he remained in Ireland, his\ndisgusting manners, and continual intoxication, extremely displeased\nLord Clancarryl; and I lived in perpetual uneasiness. A few days before\nwe were to embark for England, George Fitz-Edward, his Lordship's\nyounger brother, came from the north of Ireland, where he had been with\nhis regiment, to Lough Carryl; but it was only a passing visit to his\nfamily--he was going to England, and we were to sail in the same\npacquet.'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the mention of George Fitz-Edward, Lady Adelina grew more distressed\nthan she had yet been in the course of her narrative. Mrs. Stafford and\nEmmeline testified signs of surprize. She observed it; and asked if they\nknew him? Mrs. Stafford answered, they had some acquaintance with him;\nand Emmeline remarked that she either never heard or had forgotten that\nhis father's second title was Clancarryl.\n\nHis very name seemed to affect Lady Adelina so much, and she appeared so\nexhausted by having spoken so long, that tho' she told them she had but\nlittle to add to her mournful story, they insisted upon her permitting\nthem to release her till the evening, when they would attend her again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nThey found Lady Adelina in better spirits in the evening than they had\nhoped for--She seemed to have been arguing herself into the composure\nnecessary to go on with her story.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n'As you have some acquaintance with George Fitz-Edward, I need not\ndescribe his person or his manner; nor how decided a contrast they must\nform with those of such a man as him to whom I was unhappily united.\nThis contrast, in spite of all my endeavours, was perpetually before my\neyes--I thought Fitz-Edward, who was agreeable as his brother, had a\nheart as good; and _my_ heart involuntarily made the comparison between\nwhat I was, and what I might have been, if my fate had reserved me for\nFitz-Edward.\n\n'We embarked--It was about the autumnal equinox; and before we had\nsailed two leagues, the wind suddenly changing, blew from the opposite\nquarter, and then from every quarter by turns. As I was always subject\nto sickness in the cabin, I had lain down on the deck, on a piece of\nsail-cloth, and wrapped in my _pelisse_; and Fitz-Edward sat by me. But\nwhen the wind grew so violent that it was necessary every moment to\nshift the sails, I, who was totally insensible, was in the way of the\nsailors. Fitz-Edward carried me down in his arms; and having often heard\nme express an abhorrence to the close beds in the cabin, by the help of\nmy own maid he accommodated me with one on the floor; where he continued\nto watch over me, without attending to his own danger, tho' he heard the\nmaster of the pacquet express his apprehensions that we should be driven\nback on the bar, and beat to pieces.\n\n'Trelawny, in whom self-preservation was generally alive, whatever\nbecame of his other feelings, had passed so jovial an evening before he\ndeparted, that he was perfectly unconscious of his own danger. After\nstruggling some hours to return into the bay, it was with difficulty\naccomplished about five in the morning. Fitz-Edward, with the tenderest\nsolicitude, saw me safe on shore, whither Trelawny was also brought. But\nfar from being rejoiced at our narrow escape, he cursed his ill luck,\nwhich he said had raised this confounded storm only to prevent his\nreturning in time to see Clytemnestra got into proper order for the\nOctober meeting.\n\n'I was so ill the next day, thro' the fear and fatigue I had undergone,\nthat I was absolutely unable to go on board. But nothing that related to\nme could detain Trelawny, who embarked again as soon as the pacquet was\nrefitted, and after some grumbling at my being too ill to go, left me to\nfollow him by the next conveyance, and recommended me with great\ncoolness to the care of Fitz-Edward.\n\n'We staid only two days after him. Fitz-Edward, as well during the\npassage as on our journey to London, behaved to me with the tenderness\nof a brother; and I fancied my partiality concealed from him, because I\ntried to conceal it. If he saw it, he shewed no disposition to take\nadvantage of it, and I therefore thought I might fearlessly indulge it.\n\n'When I arrived at my house in town, I found that Trelawny was absent,\nand had left a letter for me desiring me to go down to a house he had\nnot long before purchased in Hampshire, as a hunting seat. Without\nenquiring his reasons, I obeyed him. I took a melancholy leave of\nFitz-Edward, and went into Hampshire; where, as Trelawny was not there,\nI betook myself to my books, and I fear to thinking too much of\nFitz-Edward.\n\n'After I had been there about a fortnight, I was surprized by a visit\nfrom the object of my indiscreet contemplations. He looked distressed\nand unhappy; and his first conversation seemed to be preparing me for\nsome ill news. I was dreadfully alarmed, and enquired eagerly for my\nsister?--her husband?--her children?--\n\n'\"I hope, and believe they are well,\" answered he. \"I have letters of a\nvery late date from my brother.\"\n\n'\"Oh God!\" cried I, in an agony (for his countenance still assured me\nsomething very bad had happened) \"Lord Westhaven--my brother, my dear\nbrother!\"--\n\n'\"Is well too, I hope--at least I assure you I know nothing to the\ncontrary.\"\n\n'\"Is it news from Jamaica then? Has there been an engagement. There has,\nI know, and my brother William is killed.\"\n\n'\"No, upon my honour,\" replied Fitz-Edward, \"had Godolphin been killed,\nI, who love him better than any man breathing, could not have brought\nthe intelligence--But my dear Lady Adelina, are there then no other\nmisfortunes but those which arise from the death of friends?\"\n\n'\"None,\" answered I, \"but what I could very well bear. Tell me,\ntherefore, I conjure you tell me, and keep me no longer in suspence--I\ncan hear any thing since I have nothing to apprehend for the lives of\nthose I love.\"\n\n'\"Well then,\" answered he, \"I will tell you.--I fear things are very bad\nwith Mr. Trelawny. It is said that all the estate not entailed, is\nalready gone; and that he has even sold his life interest in the rest.\nAll his effects at the town house are seized; and I am afraid the same\nthing will in a few hours happen here. I came therefore, lovely Lady\nAdelina, to intreat you to put yourself under my protection, and to quit\nthis house, where it will soon be so improper for you to remain.\"\n\n'I enquired after the unhappy Trelawny? He told me he had left him\nintoxicated at a gaming house in St. James's street; that he had told\nhim he was coming down to me, to which he had consented, tho'\nFitz-Edward said he much doubted whether he knew what he was saying.\n\n'Fitz-Edward then advised me to pack up every thing I wished to\npreserve, and immediately to depart; for he feared that persons were\nalready on the road to seize the furniture and effects in execution.\n\n'\"Gracious heaven!\" cried I, \"what can I do?--Whither can I go!\"\n\n'\"Trust yourself with me,\" cried Fitz-Edward--\"dear, injured Lady\nAdelina.\"\n\n'\"Let me rather,\" answered I, \"go down to Trelawny Park.\"\n\n'\"Alas!\" said he, \"the same ruin will there overtake you. Be assured Mr.\nTrelawny's creditors will equally attach his property there. You know\ntoo, that by the sale of his boroughs he has lost his seat in\nparliament, and that therefore his person will not be safe. He must\nhimself go abroad.\"\n\n'Doubting, and uncertain what I ought to do, I could determine on\nnothing. Fitz-Edward proposed my going to Mr. Percival's, who had\nmarried one of his sisters. They are at Bath, said he; but the house and\nservants are at my disposal, and it is only five and twenty miles from\nhence. Hardly knowing what I did, I consented to this proposal; and\ntaking my jewels and some valuable plate with me, I set out in a post\nchaise with Fitz-Edward, leaving my maid to follow me the next day, and\ngive me an account whether our fears were verified.\n\n'They were but too well founded. Four hours after I had left the house,\nthe sheriff's officers entered it--Information which encreased my\nuneasiness for the fate of the unfortunate Trelawny; in hopes of\nalleviating whose miseries I would myself have gone to London, but\nFitz-Edward would not suffer me. He said it was more than probable that\nmy husband was already in France; that if he was yet in England, he had\nno house in which to receive me, and would feel more embarrassed than\nrelieved by my presence. But as I continued to express great uneasiness\nto know what was become of him, he offered to go to London and bring me\nsome certain intelligence.\n\n'At the end of a week, which appeared insupportably long, he returned,\nand told me that with some difficulty he had discovered my unhappy\nhusband at the house of one of his friends, where he was concealed, and\nwhere he had lost at picquet more than half the ready money he could\ncommand. That with some difficulty he had convinced him of the danger as\nwell as folly of remaining in such a place; and had accompanied him to\nDover, whence he had seen him sail for France.\n\n'I told Fitz-Edward that I would instantly give up as much of my\nsettlement as would enable Trelawny to live in affluence, till his\naffairs could be arranged; but he protested that he would not suffer me\nto take any measure of that sort, till I had the advice of _his_\nbrother: or, till one of my own returned to England.\n\n'\"Do you know,\" said he, at the end of this conversation--\"Do you know,\nLady Adelina, that I envy Trelawny his misfortunes, since they excite\nsuch generous pity.--Good God! of what tenderness, of what affection\nwould not such a heart be capable, if\"----\n\n'Fitz-Edward had seldom hazarded an observation of this sort, tho' his\neyes had told me a thousand times that he internally made them. He could\nconvey into half a sentence more than others could express by the most\nelaborate speeches. Alas! I listened to him with too much pleasure; for\nmy treacherous heart had already said more than his insidious eloquence.\n\n'I wrote to Lord Clancarryl, entreating him to come over. He assured me\nhe would do so, the moment he could leave my sister, who was very near\nher time; but that in the interim his brother George would obey all my\ncommands, and render me every service he could himself do if present.\n\n'Thrown, therefore, wholly into the power of Fitz-Edward; loving him but\ntoo well; and seeing him every hour busied in serving me--I will not\naccuse him of art; I had myself too little to hide from him the fatal\nsecret of my heart; I could not summon resolution to fly from him, till\nmy error was irretrievable--till I found myself made compleatly\nmiserable by the consciousness of guilt.\n\n'After remaining there about a fortnight, I left the house of Mr.\nPercival, and took a small lodging in the neighbourhood of\nCavendish-square. Fitz-Edward saw me every day.--I met him indeed with\ntears and confusion; but if any accident prevented his coming, or if he\neven absented himself at my own request, the anguish I felt till I again\nsaw him convinced me that it was no longer in my power to live without\nhim.\n\n'Trelawny had given me no directions for my conduct; nor had he even\nwritten to me, 'till he had occasion for money. He then desired me to\nsend him five hundred guineas--a sum I had no immediate means of\nraising, but by selling some of my jewels. This I would immediately have\ndone; but Fitz-Edward, who would not hear of it, brought me the money in\na few hours, and undertook to remit it, together with a letter from me,\nto the unfortunate man for whom it was designed.\n\n'He tried too--ah, how vainly!--to persuade me, that in acting thus I\nhad done more than my duty to such an husband. His sophistry, aided by\nmy own wishes to believe him, could not quiet the incessant reproaches\nwith which my conscience pursued me--I remembered my father's dying\ninjunctions, I remembered the inflexible notions of honour inherited by\nboth my brothers, and I trembled at the severe account to which I might\nbe called. I could now no longer flatter myself that my error would be\nconcealed, since of its consequences I could not doubt; and while I\nsuffered all the terrors of remorse and apprehension, Lord Clancarryl\ncame over.\n\n'In order to take measures towards settling Trelawny's affairs, it was\nnecessary to send for his sister, who had a bond for five thousand\npounds, which claim was prior to every other. This woman, whom it was\nextremely disagreeable to me to meet, lamented with vulgar clamour her\nbrother's misfortunes; which she said could never have happened if he\nhad not been so unlucky as to get quality notions into his head. I know\nnot what at first raised her suspicions; but I saw that she very\nnarrowly observed Fitz-Edward; and sneeringly said that it was _very\nlucky_ indeed for me to have such a friend, and _quite kind_ in the\ncolonel to take so much trouble. She made herself thoroughly acquainted\nwith all that related to her brother, from the time of our parting in\nIreland; and I found that she had attempted to bribe my servant to give\nher an account of my conduct; in which tho' she had failed of success,\nshe had found that Fitz-Edward had been constantly with me. His\nattendance was indeed less remarkable when Lord Clancarryl, his brother,\nwas also present; but Mrs. Bancraft, determined to believe ill of me,\nsuffered not this circumstance to have any weight, and hinted her\nsuspicions of our attachment in terms so little guarded, that it was\nwith the utmost difficulty I could prevail on Fitz-Edward not to resent\nher impertinence.\n\n'Lord Clancarryl despised this vulgar and disgusting woman too much to\nattend to the inuendos he heard; and far from suspecting my unhappy\nweakness, he continued to lay me under new obligations to Fitz-Edward by\nemploying him almost incessantly in the arrangement of Trelawny's\naffairs.\n\n'On looking over the will of that relation, who had bequeathed to Mr.\nTrelawny the great fortune he had possessed, I discovered the reason of\nMrs. Bancraft's attentive curiosity in regard to me--if he died without\nheirs, above six thousand a year was to descend to her son, who was to\ntake the name. He had been now married above two years, and his bloated\nand unhealthy appearance (the effect of excessive drinking) indicated\nshort life; and had made her for some time look forward to the\nsuccession of the entailed estate as an event almost certain for her\nson. This sufficiently explained her conduct, and encreased all my\napprehensions; for I found that avarice would stimulate malice into that\ncontinued watchfulness which I could not now undergo without the loss of\nmy fame and my peace.\n\n'All things being settled by Lord Clancarryl in the best manner he could\ndispose them for Mr. Trelawny, his Lordship pressed me to go with him to\nIreland; but conscious that I should carry only disgrace and sorrow into\nthe happy and respectable family of my sister, I refused, under pretence\nof waiting to hear again from Trelawny before I took any resolution as\nto my future residence.\n\n'His Lordship therefore left me, having obtained my promise to go over\nto Lough Carryl in the spring. Fitz-Edward continued to see me almost\nevery day, attempting by the tenderest assiduity to soothe and\ntranquillize my mind. But time, which alleviates all other evils, only\nencreased mine; and they were now become almost insupportable. After\nlong deliberation, I saw no way to escape the disgrace which was about\nto overwhelm me, but hiding myself from my own family and from all the\nworld. I determined to keep my retreat secret, even from Fitz-Edward\nhimself; and to punish myself for my fatal attachment by tearing myself\nfor ever from it's object. Could I have supported the contempt of the\nworld, to which it was evidently the interest of Mrs. Bancraft to expose\nme, I could not bear the most distant idea of the danger to which the\nlife of Fitz-Edward would be liable from the resentment of my brothers.\nThat he might perish by the hand of Lord Westhaven or Captain Godolphin,\nor that one of those dear brothers might fall by his, was a suggestion\nso horrid, and yet so probable, that it was for ever before me; and I\nhastened to fly into obscurity, in the hope, that if my error is\nconcealed till I am myself in the grave, my brothers may forgive me, and\nnot attempt to wash out the offence in the blood of the surviving\noffender.\n\n'To remain, and to die here unknown, is all I now dare to wish for. My\nservant having formerly known the woman who inhabits this cottage,\ncontrived to have a few necessaries sent hither without observation; I\nhave made it worth the while of the people to be secret; and as they\nknow not my name, I had little apprehension of being discovered.\n\n'I took no leave of Fitz-Edward; nor have I written to him since. I\nlament the pain my sudden absence must give him; but am determined to\nsee him no more. Should my child live----'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLady Adelina was now altogether unable to proceed, and fell into an\nagony of distress which greatly affected her auditors. Mrs. Stafford and\nEmmeline said every thing they could think of to console her, and soften\nthe horror she seemed to feel for her unhappy indiscretion. But she\nlistened in listless despondence to their discourse, and answered, that\nto be reconciled to guilt, and habituated to disgrace, was to be sunk in\nthe last abyss of infamy.\n\nThey left her not, however, till they saw her rather more tranquil; and\ntill Mrs. Stafford had prevailed upon her to accept of some books, which\nshe hoped might amuse her mind, and detach it awhile from the sad\nsubject of it's mournful contemplations. These she promised to convey to\nthe cottage in a way that could create no suspicion. And relieved of her\nown apprehensions, yet full of concern for the fair unhappy mourner (to\nwhom neither she or Emmeline had given the least intimation of\nFitz-Edward's frequent residence in that country,) they returned to\nWoodfield, impressed with the most earnest solicitude to soften the\ncalamities they had just heard related, tho' to cure them was\nimpossible.\n\n\n    END OF THE SECOND VOLUME\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME III\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nWhenever Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline were afterwards alone, they could\nthink and speak of nothing but Lady Adelina. The misfortunes in which an\nunhappy marriage had involved her, her friendless youth, her lovely\nfigure, the settled sorrow and deep regret that she seemed to feel for\nthe error into which her too great sensibility of heart had betrayed\nher, engaged their tenderest pity, and made them both anxious to give\nher all the consolation and assistance she was now capable of receiving.\n\nWhen they considered the uncertainty of her remaining long concealed\nwhere she was, and the probability that Fitz-Edward himself might\ndiscover her, they saw the necessity of her removal from Woodbury\nForest. But it was a proposal they could not yet make--nor had they yet\nrecollected any place where she might be more secure.\n\nEmmeline, who felt herself particularly interested by her misfortunes,\nand who was more pleased with her conversation the oftener she conversed\nwith her, seldom failed of seeing her every day: but Mrs. Stafford, more\napprehensive of observation, could not so frequently visit her; and the\nprecaution of both redoubled, when Mrs. Ashwood, Miss Galton, and the\ntwo Miss Ashwood's, arrived at Woodfield, where they declared an\nintention of staying the months of June and July.\n\nThither also, soon after, came the younger Mr. Crofts, who had made an\nacquaintance with Mr. Stafford in London with the hope of obtaining an\ninvitation, which he eagerly accepted.\n\nSir Richard Crofts, in the ambition of making a family, had determined\nto give every advantage to his eldest son, which might authorise him to\nlook up to those alliances that would, he hoped, make his own obscurity\nforgotten. From the first dawn of his fortune, he had considered Mr.\nCrofts as it's general heir; and had very plainly told his younger son,\nthat a place under government, which he had procured for him, of about\nthree hundred a year, must be his only dependance; till he should\npossess two thousand pounds, all the provision he intended making for\nhim at his death--as he meant not to diminish, by a more equal division,\nthe patrimony of his brother. He recommended to him therefore to remedy\nthis deficiency of fortune, by looking out for an affluent wife.\n\nNature had not eminently qualified him for success in such a project;\nfor his person was short, thick, and ill made, and his face composed of\nlarge broad features, two dim grey eyes, and a complexion of a dull\nsallow white. A vain attempt to look like a gentleman, served only to\nrender the meanness of his figure more remarkable; and the qualities of\nhis heart and understanding were but little calculated to make his\npersonal imperfections forgotten. His heart was selfish, narrow,\nunfeeling, and at once mean and proud; his understanding beneath\nmediocrity; and his conversation consisted of quaint scraps of something\nthat he supposed was wit, or at least very like it. And even such\nattempts to be entertaining, poor as they were, he retailed from the\noffice where he passed the greatest part of his time, and for a\nsubaltern employment in which, his education had been barely such as\nfitted him. But ignorant as he was, and devoid of every estimable\naccomplishment, he had an infinite deal of that inferior kind of policy\ncalled cunning; and being accustomed to consider his establishment as\ndepending wholly on himself, he had acquired a habit of sacrificing\nevery sentiment and every passion to that one purpose; and would adopt\nthe opinions, and submit to the caprices of others, whenever he thought\nthey could promote it. He had learned the obsequious attention, the\nindefatigable industry, the humble adulation which is necessary for the\nunder departments of political business: and while such acquisitions\ngave him hopes of rising in that line, they failed not to contribute to\nhis success in another. He would walk from the extremity of Westminster\nto Wapping, to smuggle a set of china or of quadrille boxes, for the\nmother or aunt of an heiress; and would, with great temper, suffer the\nold ladies to take advantage of him at cards, while he ogled the young\nones. Which, together with his being always ready to perform for them\npetty services, and to flatter them without scruple, had obtained for\nhim the character of 'one of the best creatures breathing.' But\nwhatever favour these various recommendations obtained for him for a\ntime, from the elderly ladies, he lost his ground when his views were\ndiscovered; and tho' he had received what he fancied encouragement from\ntwo or three young women of fortune on their first emerging from the\nnursery, yet they had no sooner acquired an handsomer or richer lover,\nthan 'the best creature breathing' was discarded.\n\nHe was not however discouraged; and meeting with Mrs. Ashwood at a rout\nat Lady Montreville's, he was told by Miss Delamere, who was extremely\ndiverted with her airs of elegance, that she was a rich widow who wanted\na husband. He enquired into the circumstances of her fortune; and being\nassured she possessed such an income as would make him easy, he thought\nsome little advantage she had over him in point of age no diminution of\nher attractions, and found it convenient to fall immediately in love.\nShe listened to him with complaisance; and soon discovered 'that he was\nnot so plain as at first he appeared to be'--soon afterwards, 'that he\nwas rather handsome, and vastly sensible and agreeable.' After which, he\nmade a rapid progress in her heart; and it was concerted between them\nthat he should follow her to Woodfield.\n\nEmmeline and Mrs. Stafford were wearied to death with the party. But the\nformer forbore to complain, and the latter was forced to submit, and to\nsmile, while anguish was frequently at her heart.\n\nMrs. Ashwood talked of nothing but fashionable parties and fashionable\npeople, to whom her acquaintance with Lord Montreville's family had\nintroduced her; and she now seldom deigned to name an untitled\nacquaintance--while Crofts hung on her long narratives with affected\nadmiration; and the two elder of her three daughters, who were all in\ntraining to be beauties, aped their mother in vanity and impertinence.\n\nThe eldest Miss Ashwood, now about fourteen, was an insupportable\ntorment to Emmeline, as she had taken it into her head to form, with\nher, a sentimental friendship. She had learned all the cant of sentiment\nfrom novels; and her mama's lovers had extremely edified her in teaching\nher to express it. She talked perpetually of delicate embarrassments and\nexquisite sensibilities, and had probably a lover, as she extremely\nwanted a confidant; a post which Emmeline with some difficulty\ndeclined.--Of 'the sweet novels' she had read, she just understood as\nmuch as made her long to become the heroine of such an history herself,\nand she wanted somebody to listen to her hopes of being so. But Emmeline\nshrunk from her advances, and repaid her fondness with general and cool\ncivility; tho' Mrs. Ashwood, who loved rather to listen to Crofts than\nto attend to her daughters, continually promoted the intimacy, in hopes\nthat she would take them off her own hands, and allow them to be the\ncompanions of her walks.\n\nThis, Emmeline was obliged studiously to evade, as such companions would\nentirely have prevented her seeing Lady Adelina; and by repeated excuses\nshe not only irritated the curiosity of Mrs. Ashwood and Miss Galton,\nbut gave the former an additional cause of dislike to that which she had\nalready conceived; inasmuch as she was younger, handsomer, and more\nadmired than herself.\n\nEmmeline received frequent letters from Delamere, as warm and passionate\nas his personal professions. He told her, that as his mother's health\nwas greatly amended, he intended soon to visit those parts of France\nwith which he was yet unacquainted; and should pass some time in the\nNorthern Provinces, from whence he entreated her to allow him to come\nonly for a few days to England to see her--an indulgence which he said\nwould enable him to bear with more tranquillity the remaining months of\nhis exile.\n\nTho' now accustomed to consider him as her husband, Emmeline resolutely\nrefused to consent to this breach of his engagement to his father. She\nhad lately seen in her friends, Mrs. Stafford and Lady Adelina, two\nmelancholy instances of the frequent unhappiness of very early\nmarriages; and she had no inclination to hazard her own happiness in\nhopes of proving an exception. She wished, therefore, rather to delay\nher union with Delamere two or three years; but to him she never dared\nhint at such a delay. A clandestine interview it was, however, in her\npower to decline; and she answered his request by entreating him not to\nthink of such a journey; and represented to him that he could not expect\nLord Montreville would finally adhere to _his_ promises, if he himself\nwas careless of fulfilling the conditions on which his Lordship had\ninsisted. Having thus, as she supposed, prevented Delamere from\noffending his father, and without any immediate uneasiness on her own\naccount, she gave up her mind to the solicitude she could not help\nfeeling for Lady Adelina. This occupied almost all her time when she\nwas alone; and gave her, when in company, an air of absence and reserve.\n\nTho' Mrs. Ashwood so much encouraged the attention of James Crofts, she\nhad not forgotten Fitz-Edward, whom she had vainly sought at Lady\nMontreville's, in hopes of renewing an acquaintance which had in it's\ncommencement offered her so much satisfaction. Fitz-Edward had been\namused with her absurdity at the moment, but had never thought of her\nafterwards; nor would he then have bestowed so much time on a woman to\nhim entirely indifferent, had not he been thrown in her way by his\ndesire to befriend Delamere with Emmeline, on one of those days when\nLady Adelina insisted on his leaving her, to avoid the appearance of his\npassing with her all his time. Happy in successful love, his gaiety then\nknew no bounds; and his agreeable flattery, his lively conversation, his\nfashionable manners, and his handsome person, had not since been absent\nfrom the memory of Mrs. Ashwood. His being sometimes at the house he had\nborrowed of Delamere, near Woodfield, was one of the principal\ninducements to her to go thither. She indulged sanguine hopes of\nsecuring such a conquest; and evaded giving to Crofts a positive answer,\ntill she had made another essay on the heart of the Colonel.\n\nHe came, however, so seldom to Woodfield, that Mrs. Stafford had seen\nhim there only once since her meeting Lady Adelina; and then he appeared\nto be under encreased dejection, for which she knew now, how to account.\n\nEmmeline had given Mrs. Stafford so indifferent an account of Lady\nAdelina one evening, that she determined the next morning to see her.\nShe therefore went immediately after breakfast, on pretence of visiting\na poor family who had applied to her for assistance; when as Mrs.\nAshwood, Miss Galton and Emmeline, were sitting together, Colonel\nFitz-Edward was announced.\n\nHe came down to Tylehurst only the evening before; and not knowing there\nwas company at Woodfield, rode over to pass an hour with the two\nfriends, to whom he had frequently been tempted to communicate the\nsource of his melancholy.\n\nWhether it was owing to the consciousness of Lady Adelina's mournful\nstory that arose in the mind of Emmeline, or whether seeing Fitz-Edward\nagain in company with Mrs. Ashwood renewed the memory of what had\nbefallen her when they last met, she blushed deeply the moment she\nbeheld him, and arose from her chair in confusion; then sat down and\ntook out her work, which she had hastily put up; and trying to recover\nherself, grew still more confused, and trembled and blushed again.\n\nMrs. Ashwood was in the mean time overwhelming Fitz-Edward with\ncompliments and kind looks, which he answered with the distant civility\nof a slight acquaintance; and taking a chair close to Emmeline, enquired\nif she was not well?\n\nShe answered that she was perfectly well; and attempted to introduce\ngeneral conversation. But Fitz-Edward was attentive only to her; and\nMrs. Ashwood, extremely piqued at his distant manner, meditated an\nexcuse to get Emmeline out of the room, in hopes of obtaining more\nnotice.\n\nFitz-Edward, however, having talked apart with Miss Mowbray a short\ntime, arose and took leave, having by his manner convinced Mrs. Ashwood\nof what she reluctantly believed, that some later attachment had\nobliterated the impression she had made at their first interview.\n\n'I never saw such a figure in my life,' cried she, 'as Mr. Fitz-Edward.\nMercy on me!--he is grown _so_ thin, and _so_ sallow!'\n\n'And _so_ stupid,'interrupted Miss Galton. 'He is in love I fancy.'\n\nEmmeline blushed again; and Mrs. Ashwood casting a malicious look at\nher, said--'Oh! yes--he doubtless is in love. To men of his gay turn you\nknow it makes no difference, whether a person be actually married or\n_engaged_.'\n\nEmmeline, uncertain of the meaning of this sarcasm, and unwilling to be\nprovoked to make a tart reply, which she felt herself ready to do, put\nup her work and left the room.\n\nWhile she went in search of Mrs. Stafford, to enquire after Lady\nAdelina, and to relate the conversation that had passed between her and\nFitz-Edward, Mrs. Ashwood and Miss Galton were indulging their natural\nmalignity. Tho' well apprized of Emmeline's engagement to Delamere, yet\nthey hesitated not to impute her confusion, and Fitz-Edward's behaviour,\nto a passion between them. They believed, that while her elopement with\nDelamere had beyond retreat entangled her with him, and while his\nfortune and future title tempted her to marry him, her heart was in\npossession of Fitz-Edward; and that Delamere was the dupe of his\nmistress and his friend.\n\nThis idea, which could not have occurred to a woman who was not herself\ncapable of all the perfidy it implied, grew immediately familiar with\nthe imagination of Mrs. Ashwood, and embittered the sense of her own\ndisappointment.\n\nMiss Galton, who hated Emmeline more if possible than Mrs. Ashwood,\nirritated her suspicions by remarks of her own. She observed 'that it\nwas very extraordinary Miss Mowbray should walk out so early in a\nmorning, and so studiously avoid taking any body with her--and that\nunless she had appointments to which she desired no witness, it was very\nsingular she should chuse to ramble about by herself.'\n\nFrom these observations, and her evident confusion on seeing him, they\nconcluded that she had daily assignations with Fitz-Edward. They agreed,\nthat it would be no more than common justice to inform Mr. Delamere of\ntheir discovery; and this they determined to do as soon as they had\ncertain proofs to produce, with which they concluded a very little\ntrouble and attention would furnish them.\n\nJames Crofts, whose success was now indisputable, since of the handsome\nColonel there were no hopes, was let into the secret of their\nsuspicions; and readily undertook to assist in detecting the intrigue,\nfor which he assured them he had particular talents. While, therefore,\nMrs. Ashwood, Miss Galton, and James Crofts, were preparing to undermine\nthe peace and character of the innocent, ingenuous Emmeline, she and\nMrs. Stafford were meditating how to be useful to the unhappy Lady\nAdelina. They became every day more interested and more apprehensive for\nthe fate of that devoted young woman, whose health seemed to be such as\nmade it very improbable she should survive the birth of her child. Her\nspirits, too, were so depressed, that they could not prevail on her to\nthink of her own safety, or to allow them to make any overtures to her\nfamily; but, in calm and hopeless languor, she seemed resigned to the\nhorrors of her destiny, and determined to die unlamented and unknown.\n\nHer elder brother, Lord Westhaven, had returned from abroad almost\nimmediately after her concealment. His enquiries on his first arrival in\nEngland had only informed him of the embarrassment of Trelawny's\naffairs, and the inconvenience to which his sister had consequently been\nexposed; and that after staying some time in England, to settle things\nas well as she could, she had disappeared, and every body believed was\ngone to her husband. His Lordship's acquaintance and marriage with\nAugusta Delamere, almost immediately succeeded; but while it was\ndepending, he was astonished to hear from Lord and Lady Clancarryl that\nLady Adelina had never written to them before her departure. He went in\nsearch of Fitz-Edward; but could never meet him at home or obtain from\nhis servants any direction where to find him. Fitz-Edward, indeed,\npurposely avoided him, and had left no address at his lodgings in town,\nor at Tylehurst.\n\nLord Westhaven then wrote to Trelawny, but obtained no answer; and\ngrowing daily more alarmed at the uncertainty he was in about Lady\nAdelina, he determined to go, as soon as he was married, to Switzerland;\nbeing persuaded that tho' some accident had prevented his receiving her\nletters, she had found an asylum there, amongst his mother's relations.\n\nFitz-Edward, with anxiety even more poignant, had sought her with as\nlittle success. After the morning when she discharged her lodgings, and\nleft them in an hackney coach with her maid, he could never, with all\nhis unwearied researches, discover any traces of her.\n\nHe knew she was not gone to Trelawny; and dreading every thing from her\ndetermined sorrow, he passed his whole time between painful and\nfruitless conjectures, and the tormenting apprehension of hearing of\nsome fatal event. Incessantly reproaching himself for being the betrayer\nof his trust, and the ruin of a lovely and amiable woman, he gave\nhimself up to regret and despondence. The gay Fitz-Edward, so lately the\nenvy and admiration of the fashionable world, was lost to society, his\nfriends, and himself.\n\nHe passed much of his time at Tylehurst; because he could there indulge,\nwithout interruption, his melancholy reflections, and only saw Mrs.\nStafford and Emmeline, in whose soft and sensible conversation he found\na transient alleviation of his sorrow--sorrow which now grew too severe\nto be longer concealed, and which he resolved to take the earliest\nopportunity of acknowledging, in hopes of engaging the pity of his fair\nfriends--perhaps their assistance in discovering the unhappy fugitive\nwho caused it.\n\nFrom Lady Adelina, they had most carefully concealed, that his residence\nwas so near the obscure abode she had chosen. Fatal as he had been to\nher peace, and conscientiously as she had abstained from naming him\nafter their first conversation, they knew that she still fondly loved\nhim, and that her fears for his safety had assisted her sense of\nrectitude when she determined to tear herself from him. But were she\nagain to meet him, they feared she would either relapse into her former\nfatal affection, or conquer it by an effort, which in her precarious\nstate of health might prove immediately fatal.\n\nThe request which Fitz-Edward had made to Emmeline, that he might be\nallowed to see her and Mrs. Stafford together, without any other person\nbeing present, they both wished to evade; dreading least they should by\ntheir countenances betray the knowledge they had of his unhappy story,\nand the interest they took in it's catastrophe.\n\nThey hoped, therefore, to escape hearing his confession till Lady\nAdelina should be removed--and to remove her became indispensibly\nnecessary, as Emmeline was convinced she was watched in her visits to\nthe cottage.\n\nTwice she had met James Crofts within half a quarter of a mile of the\ncottage; and at another time discovered, just as she was about to enter\nit, that the Miss Ashwoods had followed her almost to the door; which\nshe therefore forbore to enter. These circumstances made both her and\nMrs. Stafford solicitous to have Lady Adelina placed in greater\nsecurity; and, added to Emmeline's uneasiness for her, was the\nunpleasant situation in which she found herself.\n\nObserved with malicious vigilance by Mrs. Ashwood, James Crofts, Miss\nGalton, and the two Misses, she felt as awkward as if she really had\nsome secret of her own to hide; and with all the purity and even heroism\nof virtue, learned the uneasy sensation which ever attends mystery and\nconcealment. The hours which used to pass tranquilly and rationally with\nMrs. Stafford, were now dedicated to people whose conversation made her\nno amends; and if she retired to her own room, it failed not to excite\nsneers and suspicions. She saw Mrs. Stafford struggling with dejection\nwhich she had no power to dissipate or relieve, and obliged to enter\ninto frequent parties of what is called pleasure, tho' to her it gave\nonly fatigue and disgust, to gratify Mrs. Ashwood, who hated all society\nbut a crowd. James Crofts, indeed, helped to keep her in good humour by\nhis excessive adulation; and chiefly by assuring her, that by any man of\nthe least taste, the baby face of Emmeline could be considered only as a\nfoil to her more mature charms, and that her fine dark eyes eclipsed all\nthe eyes in the world. He protested too against Emmeline for affecting\nknowledge--'It is,' said he, 'a maxim of my father's--and my father is\nno bad judge--that for a woman to affect literature is the most horrid\nof all absurdities; and for a woman to know any thing of business, is\ndetestable!'\n\nMrs. Ashwood laid by her dictionary, determined for the future to spell\nher own way without it.\n\nBesides the powerful intervention of flattery, James Crofts had another\nnot less successful method of winning the lady's favour. He told her\nthat his brother, who had long cherished a passion in which he was at\nlength likely to be disappointed, was in that case determined never to\nmarry; that he was in an ill state of health; and if he died without\nposterity, the estate and title of his father would descend to himself.\n\nThe elder Crofts, very desirous of seeing a brother established who\nmight otherwise be burthensome or inconvenient to him, suggested this\nfinesse; and secured it's belief by writing frequent and melancholy\naccounts of his own ill health--an artifice by which he promoted at once\nhis brother's views and his own. He affected the valetudinarian so\nhappily, and complained so much of the ill effect that constant\napplication to business had on his constitution, that nobody doubted of\nthe reality of his sickness. He took care that Miss Delamere should\nreceive an account of it, which he knew she would consider as the\nconsequence of his despairing love; and when he had interested her\nvanity and of course her compassion, he contrived to obtain leave of\nabsence for three months from the duties of his office, in order to go\nabroad for the recovery of his health. He hastened to Barege; and soon\nfound means to re-establish himself in the favour of Miss Delamere; from\nwhich, absence, and large draughts of flattery dispensed with French\nadroitness, had a little displaced him. This stratagem put his brother\nJames on so fair a footing with the widow, that he thought her fortune\nwould be secured before she could discover it to be only a stratagem,\nand that her lover was still likely to continue a younger brother.\n\nJames Crofts seeing the necessity of dispatch, became so importunate,\nthat Mrs. Ashwood, despairing of Fitz-Edward, and believing she might\nnot again meet with a man so near a title, for which she had a violent\ninclination, was prevailed on to promise she would make him happy as\nsoon as she returned to her own house.\n\nIt was now the end of June; and Lady Adelina, whose situation grew very\ncritical, had at length yielded to the entreaties of her two friends,\nand agreed to go wherever they thought she could obtain assistance and\nconcealment in the approaching hour.\n\nMrs. Stafford and Emmeline, after long and frequent reflections and\nconsultations on the subject, concluded that no situation would be so\nproper as Bath. In a place resorted to by all sorts of people, less\nenquiry is excited than in a provincial town, where strangers are\nobjects of curiosity to it's idle inhabitants. To Bath, therefore, it\nwas determined Lady Adelina should go. But when the time of her journey,\nand her arrangements there, came to be discussed, she expressed so much\nterror least she should be known, so much anguish at leaving those to\nwhose tender pity she was so greatly indebted, and such melancholy\nconviction that she should not survive, that the sensible heart of\nEmmeline could not behold without sharing her agonies; nor was Mrs.\nStafford less affected. When they returned home after this interview,\nEmmeline was pursued by the image of the poor unhappy Adelina. But to\ngive, to the wretched, only barren sympathy, was not in her nature,\nwhere more effectual relief was in her power. She thought, that if by\nher presence she could alleviate the anguish, and soothe the sorrows of\nthe fair mourner, perhaps save her character and her life, and be the\nmeans of restoring her to her family, she should perform an action\ngratifying to her own heart, and acceptable to heaven. The more she\nreflected on it, the more anxious she became to execute it--and she at\nlength named it to Mrs. Stafford.\n\nMrs. Stafford, tho' aware of the numberless objections which might have\nbeen made to such a plan, could not resolve strenuously to oppose it.\nShe felt infinite compassion for Lady Adelina; but could herself do\nlittle to assist her, as her time was not her own and her absence must\nhave been accounted for: but Emmeline was liable to no restraint; and\nwould not only be meritoriously employed in befriending the unhappy, but\nwould escape from the society at Woodfield, which became every day more\ndisagreeable to her. These considerations, particularly the benevolent\none of saving an unhappy young woman, over-balanced, in the mind of Mrs.\nStafford, the objection that might be made to her accompanying a person\nunder the unfortunate and discreditable circumstances of Lady Adelina;\nand her heart, too expansive to be closed by the cold hand of prudery\nagainst the sighs of weakness or misfortune, assured her that she was\nright. She knew that Emmeline was of a character to pity, but not to\nimitate, the erroneous conduct of her friend; and she believed that the\nreputation of Lady Adelina Trelawny might be rescued from reproach,\nwithout communicating any part of it's blemish to the spotless purity of\nEmmeline Mowbray.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nAs soon as Emmeline had persuaded herself of the propriety of this plan\nand obtained Mrs. Stafford's concurrence, she hinted her intentions to\nLady Adelina; who received the intimation with such transports of\ngratitude and delight, that Emmeline, confirmed in her resolution, no\nlonger suffered a doubt of it's propriety to arise; and, with the\nparticipation of Mrs. Stafford only, prepared for her journey, which was\nto take place in ten days.\n\nMrs. Stafford also employed a person on whom she could rely, to receive\nthe money due to Lady Adelina from her husband's estate. But of this her\nLadyship demanded only half, leaving the rest for Trelawny. The attorney\nin whose hands Trelawny's affairs were placed by Lord Westhaven, was\nextremely anxious to discover, from the person employed by Mrs.\nStafford, from whence he obtained the order signed by Lady Adelina; and\nobliged him to attend several days before he would pay it, in hopes, by\npersuasions or artful questions, to draw the secret from him. He met, at\nthe attorney's chambers, an officer who had made of him the same\nenquiry, and had followed him home, and since frequently importuned\nhim--intelligence, which convinced Mrs. Stafford that Lady Adelina must\nsoon be discovered, (as they concluded the officer was Fitz-Edward,) and\nmade both her and Emmeline hasten the day of her departure.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from Woodfield, and at the extremity of the\nlawn which surrounded it, was a copse in which the accumulated waters of\na trout stream formed a beautiful tho' not extensive piece of water,\nshaded on every side by a natural wood. Mrs. Stafford, who had\nparticular pleasure in the place, had planted flowering shrubs and\ncaused walks to be cut through it; and on the edge of the water built a\nseat of reeds and thatch, which was furnished with a table and a few\ngarden chairs. Thither Emmeline repaired whenever she could disengage\nherself from company. Solitude was to her always a luxury; and\nparticularly desirable now, when her anxiety for Lady Adelina, and\npreparations for their approaching departure, made her wish to avoid the\nmalicious observations of Mrs. Ashwood, the forward intrusion of her\ndaughters, and the inquisitive civilities of James Crofts. She had now\nonly one day to remain at Woodfield, before that fixed for their setting\nout; and being altogether unwilling to encounter the fatigue of such an\nengagement so immediately previous to her journey, she declined being of\nthe party to dine at the house of a neighbouring gentleman; who, on the\noccasion of his son's coming of age, was to give a ball and _f\u00c3\u00aate\nchamp\u00c3\u00aatre_ to a very large company.\n\nMrs. Ashwood, seeing Emmeline averse, took it into her head to press her\nextremely to go with them; and finding she still refused, said--'it was\nmonstrous rude, and that she was sure no young person would decline\npartaking such an entertainment if she had not some _very particular_\nreason.'\n\nEmmeline, teized and provoked out of her usual calmness, answered--'That\nwhatever might be her reasons, she was fortunately accountable to nobody\nfor them.'\n\nMrs. Ashwood, provoked in her turn, made some very rude replies, which\nEmmeline, not to irritate her farther, left the room without answering;\nand as soon as the carriages drove from the door, she dined alone, and\nthen desiring one of the servants to carry her harp into the\nsummer-house in the copse, she walked thither with her music books, and\nsoon lost the little chagrin which Mrs. Ashwood's ill-breeding had given\nher.\n\nFitz-Edward, who arrived in the country the preceding evening, after\nanother fruitless search for Lady Adelina, walked over to Woodfield, in\nhopes, as it was early in the afternoon, that he might obtain, in the\ncourse of it, some conversation with Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline. On\narriving, he met the servant who had attended Emmeline to the copse, and\nwas by him directed thither. As he approached the seat, he heard her\nsinging a plaintive air, which seemed in unison with his heart. She\nstarted at the sight of him--Mrs. Ashwood's suspicions immediately\noccurred to her, and at the same moment the real motive which had made\nhim seek this interview. She blushed, and looked uneasy; but the\ninnocence and integrity of her heart presently restored her composure,\nand when Fitz-Edward asked if she would allow him half an hour of her\ntime, she answered--'certainly.'\n\nHe sat down by her, dejectedly and in silence. She was about to put\naside her harp, but he desired her to repeat the air she was singing.\n\n'It is sweetly soothing,' said he, 'and reminds me of happier days when\nI first heard it; while you sing it, I may perhaps acquire resolution to\ntell you what may oblige you to discard me from your acquaintance. It\ndoes indeed require resolution to hazard such a misfortune.'\n\nEmmeline, not knowing how to answer, immediately began the air. The\nthoughts which agitated her bosom while she sung, made her voice yet\nmore tender and pathetic. She saw the eyes of Fitz-Edward fill with\ntears; and as soon as she ceased he said--\n\n'Tell me, Miss Mowbray--what does the man deserve, who being entrusted\nwith the confidence of a young and beautiful woman--beautiful, even as\nEmmeline herself, and as highly accomplished--has betrayed the sacred\ntrust; and has been the occasion--oh God!--of what misery may I not have\nbeen the occasion!\n\n'Pardon me,' continued he--'I am afraid my despair frightens you--I will\nendeavour to command myself.'\n\nEmmeline found she could not escape hearing the story, and endeavoured\nnot to betray by her countenance that she already knew it.\n\nFitz-Edward went on--\n\n'When first I knew you, I was a decided libertine. Yourself and Mrs.\nStafford, lovely as I thought you both, would have been equally the\nobject of my designs, if Delamere's passion for you, and the reserved\nconduct of Mrs. Stafford, had not made me doubt succeeding with either.\nBut for your charming friend my heart long retained it's partiality; nor\nwould it ever have felt for her that pure and disinterested friendship\nwhich is now in regard to her it's only sentiment, had not the object of\nmy present regret and anguish been thrown in my way.\n\n'To you, Miss Mowbray, I scruple not to speak of this beloved and\nlamented woman; tho' her name is sacred with me, and has never yet been\nmentioned united with dishonour.\n\n'The connection between our families first introduced me to her\nacquaintance. In her person she was exquisitely lovely, and her manners\nwere as enchanting as her form. The sprightly gaiety of unsuspecting\ninexperience, was, I thought, sometimes checked by an involuntary\nsentiment of regret at the sacrifice she had made, by marrying a man\nevery way unworthy of her; except by that fortune to which she was\nindifferent, and of which he was hastening to divest himself.\n\n'I had never seen Mr. Trelawny; and knew him for some time only from\nreport. But when he came to Lough Carryl, my pity for her, encreased in\nproportion to the envy and indignation with which I beheld the\ninsensible and intemperate husband--incapable of feeling for her, any\nother sentiment, than what she might equally have inspired in the lowest\nof mankind.\n\n'Her unaffected simplicity; her gentle confidence in my protection\nduring a voyage in which her ill-assorted mate left her entirely to my\ncare; made me rather consider her as my sister than as an object of\nseduction. I resolved to be the guardian rather than the betrayer of her\nhonour--and I long kept my resolution.'\n\nFitz-Edward then proceeded to relate the circumstances that attended the\nruin of Trelawny's fortune; and that Lady Adelina was left to struggle\nwith innumerable difficulties, unassisted but by himself, to whom Lord\nClancarryl had delegated the task of treating with Trelawny's sister and\ncreditors.\n\n'Her gratitude,' continued he, 'for the little assistance I was able to\ngive her, was boundless; and as pity had already taught me to love her\nwith more ardour than her beauty only, captivating as it is, would have\ninspired; gratitude led her too easily into tender sentiments for me. I\nam not a presuming coxcomb; but she was infinitely too artless to\nconceal her partiality; and neither her misfortunes, or her being the\nsister of my friend Godolphin, protected her against the libertinism of\nmy principles.'\n\nHe went on to relate the deep melancholy that seized Lady Adelina; and\nhis own terror and remorse when he found her one morning gone from her\nlodgings, where she had left no direction; and from her proceeding it\nwas evident she designed to conceal herself from his enquiries.\n\n'God knows,' pursued he, 'what is now become of her!--perhaps, when most\nin need of tenderness and attention, she is thrown destitute and\nfriendless among strangers, and will perish in indigence and obscurity.\nUnused to encounter the slightest hardship, her delicate frame, and\nstill more sensible mind, will sink under those to which her situation\nwill expose her--perhaps I shall be doubly a murderer!'\n\nHe stopped, from inability to proceed--Emmeline, in tears, continued\nsilent.\n\nStruggling to conquer his emotion and recover his voice, Fitz-Edward at\nlength continued--\n\n'While I was suffering all the misery which my apprehension for her fate\ninflicted, her younger brother, William Godolphin, returned from the\nWest Indies, where he has been three years stationed. I was the first\nperson he visited in town; but I was not at my lodgings there. Before I\nreturned from Tylehurst, he had informed himself of all the\ncircumstances of Trelawny's embarrassments, and his sister's absence. He\nfound letters from Lord Westhaven, and from my brother, Lord Clancarryl;\nwho knowing he would about that time return to England, conjured him to\nassist in the attempt of discovering Lady Adelina; of whose motives for\nconcealing herself from her family they were entirely ignorant, while it\nfilled them with uneasiness and astonishment. As soon as I went back to\nLondon, Godolphin, of whose arrival I was ignorant, came to me. He\nembraced me, and thanked me for my friendship and attention to his\nunfortunate Adelina--I think if he had held his sword to my heart it\nwould have hurt me less!\n\n'He implored me to help his search after his lost sister, and again said\nhow greatly he was obliged to me--while I, conscious how little I\ndeserved his gratitude, felt like a coward and an assassin, and shrunk\nfrom the manly confidence of my friend.\n\n'Since our first meeting, I have seen him several times, and ever with\nnew anguish. I have loved Godolphin from my earliest remembrance; and\nhave known him from a boy to have the best heart and the noblest spirit\nunder heaven. Equally incapable of deserving or bearing dishonour,\nGodolphin will behold me with contempt; which tho' I deserve, I cannot\nendure. He must call me to an account; and the hope of perishing by his\nhand is the only one I now cherish. Yet unable to shock him by divulging\nthe fatal secret, I have hitherto concealed it, and my concealment he\nmust impute to motives base, infamous, and pusillanimous. I can bear\nsuch reflections no longer--I will go to town to-morrow, explain his\nsister's situation to him, and let him take the only reparation I can\nnow make him.'\n\nEmmeline, shuddering at this resolution, could not conceal how greatly\nit affected her.\n\n'Generous and lovely Miss Mowbray! pardon me for having thus moved your\ngentle nature; and allow me, since I see you pity me, to request of you\nand Mrs. Stafford a favour which will probably be the last trouble the\nunhappy Fitz-Edward will give you.\n\n'It may happen that Lady Adelina may hereafter be discovered--tho' I\nknow not how to hope it. But if your generous pity should interest you\nin the fate of that unhappy, forlorn young woman, your's and Mrs.\nStafford's protection might yet perhaps save her; and such interposition\nwould be worthy of hearts like yours. As the event of a meeting between\nme and Godolphin is uncertain, shall I entreat you, my lovely friend, to\ntake charge of this paper. It contains a will, by which the child of\nLady Adelina will be entitled to all I die possessed of. It is enough,\nif the unfortunate infant survives, to place it above indigence. Lord\nClancarryl will not dispute the disposition of my fortune; and to your\ncare, and that of Mrs. Stafford, I have left it in trust, and I have\nentreated you to befriend the poor little one, who will probably be an\norphan--but desolate and abandoned it will not be, if it's innocence and\nunhappiness interest you to grant my request. Delamere will not object\nto your goodness being so exerted; and you will not teach it, generous,\ngentle as you are! to hold in abhorrence the memory of it's father. This\nis all I can now do. Farewell! dearest Miss Mowbray!--Heaven give you\nhappiness, _ma douce amie!_ Farewell!'\n\nThese last words, in which Fitz-Edward repeated the name by which he was\naccustomed to address Emmeline, quite overcame her. He was hastening\naway, while, hardly able to speak, she yet made an effort to stop him.\nThe interview he was about to seek was what Lady Adelina so greatly\ndreaded. Yet Emmeline dared not urge to him how fatal it would be to\nher; she knew not what to say, least he should discover the secret with\nwhich she was entrusted; but in breathless agitation caught his hand as\nhe turned to leave her, crying--\n\n'Hear me, Fitz-Edward! One moment hear me! Do not go to meet Captain\nGodolphin. I conjure, I implore you do not!'\n\nShe found it impossible to proceed. Her eyes were still eagerly fixed on\nhis face; she still held his hand; while he, supposing her extreme\nemotion arose from the compassionate tenderness of her nature, found the\nsteadiness of his despair softened by the soothing voice of pity, and\nthrowing himself on his knees, he laid his head on one of the chairs,\nand wept like a woman.\n\nEmmeline, who now hoped to persuade him not to execute the resolution he\nhad formed, said--'I will take the paper you have given me, Fitz-Edward,\nand will most religiously fulfil all your request in it to the utmost\nextent of my power. But in return for my giving you this promise, I must\ninsist'----\n\nAt this moment James Crofts stood before them.\n\nEmmeline, shocked and amazed at his appearance, roused Fitz-Edward by a\nsudden exclamation.\n\nHe started up, and said fiercely to Crofts--'Well, Sir!--have you any\ncommands here?'\n\n'Commands, Sir,' answered Crofts, somewhat alarmed by the tone in which\nthis question was put--'I have no commands to be sure Sir--but, but, I\ncame Sir, just to enquire after Miss Mowbray. I did not mean to\nintrude.'\n\n'Then, Sir,' returned the Colonel, 'I beg you will leave us.'\n\n'Oh! certainly, Sir,' cried Crofts, trying to regain his courage and\nassume an air of raillery--'certainly--I would not for the world\ninterrupt you. My business indeed is not at all material--only a\ncompliment to Miss Mowbray--your's,' added he sneeringly, 'is, I see, of\nmore consequence.'\n\n'Look ye, Mr. Crofts,' sharply answered Fitz-Edward--'You are to make no\nimpertinent comments. Miss Mowbray is mistress of her actions. She is in\nmy particular protection on behalf of my friend Delamere, and I shall\nconsider the slightest failure of respect to her as an insult to me.\nSir, if you have nothing more to say you will be so good as to leave\nus.'\n\nThere was something so hostile in the manner in which Fitz-Edward\ndelivered this speech, that James Crofts, more at home in the cabinet\nthan the field, thought he might as well avoid another injunction to\ndepart; and quietly submit to the present, rather than provoke farther\nresentment from the formidable soldier. He therefore, looking most\ncadaverously, made one of his jerking bows, and said, with something he\nintended for a smile--\n\n'Well, well, good folks, I'll leave you to your _t\u00c3\u00aate a t\u00c3\u00aate_, and\nhasten back to my engagement. Every body regrets Miss Mowbray's absence\nfrom the ball; and the partner that was provided for her is ready to\nhang himself.'\n\nAn impatient look, darted from Fitz-Edward, stopped farther effusion of\nimpertinence, and he only added--'Servant! servant!' and walked away.\n\nFitz-Edward, then turning towards Emmeline, saw her pale and faint.\n\n'Why, my dear Miss Mowbray, do you suffer this man's folly to affect\nyou? Your looks really terrify me!'\n\n'Oh! he was sent on purpose,' cried Emmeline.--'Mrs. Ashwood has lately\noften hinted to me, that whatever are my engagements to Delamere I was\nmuch more partial to you. She has watched me for some time; and now, on\nmy refusing to accompany them to the ball, concluded I had an\nappointment, and sent Crofts back to see.'\n\n'If I thought so,' sternly answered Fitz-Edward, 'I would instantly\novertake him, and I believe I could oblige him to secresy.'\n\n'No, for heaven's sake don't!' said Emmeline--'for heaven's sake do not\nthink of it! I care not what they conjecture--leave them to their\nmalice--Crofts is not worth your anger. But Fitz-Edward, let us return\nto what we were talking of. Will you promise me to delay going to\nLondon--to delay seeing Mr. Godolphin until--in short, will you give me\nyour honour to remain at Tylehurst a week, without taking any measures\nto inform Godolphin of what you have told me. I will, at the end of that\ntime, either release you from your promise, or give you unanswerable\nreasons why you should relinquish the design of meeting him at all.'\n\nFitz-Edward, however amazed at the earnestness she expressed to obtain\nthis promise, gave it. He had no suspicion of Emmeline's having any\nknowledge of Lady Adelina; and accounted for the deep interest she\nseemed to take in preventing an interview, by recollecting the universal\ntenderness and humanity of her character. He assured her he would not\nleave Tylehurst 'till the expiration of the time she had named. He\nconjured her not to suffer any impertinence from Crofts on the subject\nof their being seen together, but to awe him into silence by resentment.\nEmmeline now desired him to leave her. But she still seemed under such\nan hurry of spirits, that he insisted on being allowed to attend her to\nthe door of the house, where, renewing his thanks for the compassionate\nattention she had afforded him, and entreating her to compose herself,\nhe left her.\n\nEmmeline intending to go to her own room, went first into the drawing\nroom to deposit her music book. She had hardly done so, when she heard a\nman's step, and turning, beheld Crofts open the door, which he\nimmediately shut after him.\n\n'I thought, Sir,' said Emmeline, 'you had been gone back to your\ncompany.'\n\n'No, not yet, my fair Emmeline. I wanted first to beg your pardon for\nhaving disturbed so snug a party. Ah! sly little prude--who would think\nthat you, who always seem so cold and so cruel, made an excuse only to\nstay at home to meet Fitz-Edward? But it is not fair, little dear, that\nall your kindness should be for him, while you will scarce give any\nother body a civil look. Now I have met with you I swear I'll have a\nkiss too.'\n\nEmmeline, terrified to death at his approaching her with this speech,\nflew to the bell, which she rang with so much violence that the rope\nbroke from the crank.\n\n'Now,' cried Crofts, 'if nobody hears, you are more than ever in my\npower.'\n\n'Heaven forbid!' shrieked Emmeline, in an agony of fear. 'Let me go, Mr.\nCrofts, this moment.'\n\nShe would have rushed towards the door but he stood with his arms\nextended before it.\n\n'You did not run thus--you did not scream thus, when Fitz-Edward, the\nfortunate Fitz-Edward, was on his knees before you. Then, you could weep\nand sigh too, and look so sweetly on him. But come--you see I know so\nmuch that it will be your interest, little dear, to make me your\nfriend.'\n\n'Rather let me apply to fiends and furies for friendship! hateful,\ndetestable wretch! by what right do you insult and detain me?'\n\n'Oh! these theatricals are really very sublime!' cried he, seizing both\nher hands, which he violently grasped.\n\nShe shrieked aloud, and fruitlessly struggled to break from him, when\nthe footsteps of somebody near the door obliged him to let her go. She\ndarted instantly away, and in the hall met one of the maids.\n\n'Lord, Miss,' cried the servant, 'did you ring? I've been all over the\nhouse to see what bell it was.'\n\nEmmeline, without answering, flew to her own room. The maid followed\nher: but desirous of being left alone, she assured the girl that nothing\nwas the matter; that she was merely tired by a long walk; and desiring\na glass of water, tried to compose and recollect herself; while Crofts\nunobserved returned to the house where the _f\u00c3\u00aate_ was given time enough\nto dress and dance with Mrs. Ashwood.\n\nIt was at her desire, that immediately after dinner Crofts had left the\ncompany under pretence of executing a commission with which she easily\nfurnished him; but his real orders were to discover the motives of\nEmmeline's refusal to be of the party. This he executed beyond his\nexpectation. It was no longer to be doubted that very good intelligence\nsubsisted between Emmeline and Fitz-Edward, since he had been found on\nhis knees before her; while she, earnestly yet kindly speaking, hung\nover him with tears in her eyes. Knowing that Emmeline was absolutely\nengaged to Delamere, he was persuaded that Fitz-Edward was master of her\nheart; and that the tears and emotion to which he had been witness, were\noccasioned by the impossibility of her giving him her hand. He knew\nFitz-Edward's character too well to suppose he could be insensible of\nthe lady's kindness; and possessing himself a mind gross and depraved,\nhe did not hesitate to believe all the ill his own base and illiberal\nspirit suggested.\n\nTho', interested hypocrite as he was, he made every other passion\nsubservient to the gratification of his avarice, Crofts had not coldly\nbeheld the youth and beauty of Emmeline; he had, however, carefully\nforborne to shew that he admired her, and would probably never have\nbetrayed what must ruin him for ever with Mrs. Ashwood, had not the\nconviction of her partiality to Fitz-Edward inspired him with the\ninfamous hope of frightening her into some kindness for himself, by\nthreatening to betray her stolen interview with her supposed lover.\n\nThe scorn and horror with which Emmeline repulsed him served only to\nmortify his self love, and provoke his hatred towards her and the man\nwhom he believed she favoured; and with the inveterate and cowardly\nmalignity of which his heart was particularly susceptible, he determined\nto do all in his power to ruin them both.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nSuch was the horror and detestation which Emmeline felt for Crofts, that\nshe could not bear the thoughts of seeing him again. But as she feared\nMrs. Stafford might resent his behaviour, and by that means embroil\nherself with the vain and insolent Mrs. Ashwood, with whom she knew\nStafford was obliged to keep on a fair footing, she determined to say as\nlittle as she could of his impertinence to Mrs. Stafford, but to\nwithdraw from the house without again exposing herself to meet him. As\nsoon as she saw her the next morning, she related all that had passed\nbetween Fitz-Edward and herself; and after a long consultation they\nagreed that to prevent his seeing Godolphin was absolutely necessary;\nand that no other means of doing so offered, but Mrs. Stafford's\nrelating to him the real circumstances and situation of Lady Adelina, as\nsoon as she could be removed from her present abode and precautions\ntaken to prevent his discovering her. This, Mrs. Stafford undertook to\ndo immediately after their departure. It was to take place on the next\nday; and Emmeline, with the concurrence of her friend, determined that\nshe would take no leave of the party at Woodfield: for tho' the\nappearance of mystery was extremely disagreeable and distressing to\nEmmeline, she knew that notice of her intentions would excite enquiries\nand awaken curiosity very difficult to satisfy; and that it was\nextremely probable James Crofts might be employed to watch her, and by\nthat means render abortive all her endeavours to preserve the unhappy\nLady Adelina.\n\nRelying therefore on the generosity and innocence of her intentions, she\nchose rather to leave her own actions open to censure which they did not\ndeserve, than to risk an investigation which might be fatal to the\ninterest of her poor friend. She took nothing with her, Mrs. Stafford\nundertaking every necessary arrangement about her cloaths--and having at\nnight taken a tender leave of this beloved and valuable woman, and\npromised to write to her constantly and to return as soon as the destiny\nof Lady Adelina should be decided, they parted.\n\nAnd Emmeline, arising before the dawn of the following morning, set out\nalone to Woodbury Forest--a precaution absolutely necessary, to evade\nthe inquisitive watchfulness of James Crofts. She stole softly down\nstairs, before even the servants were stirring, and opening the door\ncautiously, felt some degree of terror at being obliged to undertake so\nlong a walk alone at such an hour. But innocence gave her courage, and\nfriendly zeal lent her strength. As she walked on, her fears subsided.\nShe saw the sun rise above the horizon, and her apprehensions were at an\nend.\n\nAs no carriage could approach within three quarters of a mile of the\nhouse where Lady Adelina was concealed, they were obliged to walk to the\nroad where Mrs. Stafford had directed a post chaise to wait for them,\nwhich she had hired at a distant town, where it was unlikely any enquiry\nwould be made.\n\nLong disuse, as she had hardly ever left the cottage from the moment of\nher entering it, and the extreme weakness to which she was reduced, made\nEmmeline greatly fear that Lady Adelina would never be able to reach the\nplace. With her assistance, and that of her Ladyship's woman, slowly and\nfaintly she walked thither; and Emmeline saw her happily placed in the\nchaise. Every thing had been before settled as to the conveyance of the\nservant and baggage, and to engage the secresy of the woman with whom\nshe had dwelt, by making her silence sufficiently advantageous; and as\nthey hoped that no traces were left by which they might be followed, the\nspirits of the fair travellers seemed somewhat to improve as they\nproceeded on their journey.--Emmeline felt her heart elated with the\nconsciousness of doing good; and from the tender affection and\nassistance of such a friend, which could be considered only as the\nbenevolence of heaven itself, Lady Adelina drew a favourable omen, and\ndared entertain a faint hope that her penitence had been accepted.\n\nThey arrived without any accident at Bath, the following day; and\nEmmeline, leaving Lady Adelina at the inn, went out immediately to\nsecure lodgings in a retired part of the town. As soon as it was dark,\nLady Adelina removed thither in a chair; and was announced by Emmeline\nto be the wife of a Swiss officer, to be herself of Switzerland, and to\nbear the name of Mrs. St. Laure--while she herself, as she was very\nlittle known, continued to pass by her own name in the few transactions\nwhich in their very private way of living required her name to be\nrepeated.\n\nWhen Mrs. Ashwood found that Emmeline had left Woodfield clandestinely\nand alone, and that Mrs. Stafford evaded giving any account whither she\nwas gone, by saying coldly that she was gone to visit a friend in\nSurrey whom she formerly knew in Wales, all the suspicions she had\nherself harboured, and Miss Galton encouraged, seemed confirmed. James\nCrofts had related, not without exaggerations, what he had been witness\nto in the copse; and it was no longer doubted but that she was gone with\nFitz-Edward, which at once accounted for her departure and the sudden\nand mysterious manner in which it was accomplished. James Crofts had\nsuspicions that his behaviour had hastened it; but he failed not to\nconfirm Mrs. Ashwood in her prepossession that her entanglement with\nFitz-Edward was now at a period when it could be no longer\nconcealed--intelligence which was to be conveyed to Delamere.\n\nThe elder Crofts, who had been some time with Lady Montreville and her\ndaughter, had named Delamere from time to time in his letters to his\nbrother. The last, mentioned that he was now with his mother and sister,\nwho were at Nice, and who purposed returning to England in about three\nmonths. Crofts represented Delamere as still devoted to Emmeline; and as\nexisting only in the hope of being no longer opposed in his intention of\nmarrying her in March, when the year which he had promised his father to\nwait expired; but that Lady Montreville, as time wore away, grew more\naverse to the match, and more desirous of some event which might break\nit off. Crofts gave his brother a very favourable account of his\nprogress with Miss Delamere; and hinted that if he could be fortunate\nenough to put an end to Delamere's intended connection, it would so\ngreatly conciliate the favour of Lady Montreville, that he dared hope\nshe would no longer oppose his union with her daughter: and when once\nthey were married, and the prejudices of the mother to an inferior\nalliance conquered, he had very little doubt of Lord Montreville's\nforgiveness, and of soon regaining his countenance and friendship.\n\nThis account from his brother added another motive to those which\nalready influenced the malignant and illiberal mind of James Crofts to\ninjure the lovely orphan, and he determined to give all his assistance\nto Mrs. Ashwood in the cruel project of depriving her at once of her\ncharacter and her lover. In a consultation which he held on this subject\nwith his promised bride and Miss Galton, the ladies agreed that it was\nperfectly shocking that such a fine young man as Mr. Delamere should be\nattached to a woman so little sensible of his value as Emmeline; that it\nhad long been evident she was to him indifferent, and it was now too\nclear that she was partial to another; and that therefore it would be a\nmeritorious action to acquaint him of her intimacy with Fitz-Edward; and\nit could not be doubted but his knowledge of it would, high spirited as\nhe was, cure him effectually of his ill-placed passion, and restore the\ntranquillity of his respectable family. Hiding thus the inveterate envy\nand malice of their hearts under this hypocritical pretence, they next\nconsidered how to give the information which was so meritorious.\nAnonymous letters were expedients to which Miss Galton had before had\nrecourse, and to an anonymous letter they determined to commit the\nsecret of Emmeline's infidelity--while James Crofts, in his letters to\nhis brother, was to corroborate the intelligence it contained, by\nrelating as mere matter of news what had actually and evidently\nhappened, Emmeline's sudden departure from Woodfield.\n\nDelamere, when he saw his mother out of danger at Barege, had returned\nto the neighbourhood of Paris, where he had lingered some time, in hopes\nthat Emmeline would accede to his request of being allowed to cross the\nchannel for a few days; but her answer, in which she strongly urged the\nhazard he would incur of giving his father a pretence to withdraw _his_\npromise, by violating his own, had obliged him, tho' with infinite\nreluctance, to give up the scheme; and being quite indifferent where he\nwas, if he was still at a distance from her, he had yielded to the\nsolicitations of Lady Montreville, and rejoined her at Nice. There, he\nnow remained; while every thing in England seemed to contribute to\nassist the designs of those who wished to disengage him from his passion\nfor Emmeline.\n\nThe day after Emmeline's departure with Lady Adelina, Fitz-Edward went\nto Woodfield; and hearing that Miss Mowbray had suddenly left it, was\nthrown into the utmost astonishment--astonishment which Mrs. Ashwood and\nMiss Galton observed to each other was the finest piece of acting they\nhad ever seen.\n\nThe whole party were together when he was introduced--a circumstance\nMrs. Stafford would willingly have avoided, as it was absolutely\nnecessary for her to speak to him alone; and determined to do so,\nwhatever construction the malignity of her sister-in-law might put upon\nit, she said--\n\n'I have long promised you, Colonel, a sight of the two pieces of drawing\nwhich Miss Mowbray and I have finished as companions. They are now\nframed; and if you will come with me into my dressing-room you shall see\nthem.'\n\nAs the rest of the company had frequently seen these drawings, there was\nno pretence for their following Mrs. Stafford; who, accompanied by the\nColonel, went to her dressing room.\n\nA conference thus evidently sought by Mrs. Stafford, excited the eager\nand painful curiosity of the party in the parlour.\n\n'Now would I give the world,' cried Mrs. Ashwood, 'to know what is going\nforward.'\n\n'Is it not possible to listen?' enquired Crofts, equal to any meanness\nthat might gratify the malevolence of another or his own.\n\n'Yes,' replied Mrs. Ashwood, 'if one could get into the closet next the\ndressing-room without being perceived, which can only be done by passing\nthro' the nursery. If indeed the nursery maids and children are out, it\nis easy enough.'\n\n'They are out, mama, I assure you,' cried Miss Ashwood, 'for I saw them\nmyself go across the lawn since I've been at breakfast. Do, pray let us\ngo and listen--I long of all things to know what my aunt Stafford can\nhave to say to that sly-looking Colonel.'\n\n'No, no, child,' said her mother, 'I shall not send you, indeed--but\nCrofts, do you think we should be able to make it out?'\n\n'Egad,' answered he, 'I'll try--for depend upon it the mischief will\nout. It will be rare, to have such a pretty tale to tell Mr. Delamere of\nhis demure-looking little dear.--I'll venture.'\n\nMrs. Ashwood then shewing him the way, he went on tip toe up stairs, and\nconcealing himself in a light closet which was divided from the dressing\nroom only by lath and plaister, he lent an attentive ear to the dialogue\nthat was passing.\n\nIt happened, however, that the window near which Mrs. Stafford and\nFitz-Edward were sitting was exactly opposite to that side of the room\nto which Crofts' hiding-place communicated; and tho' the room was not\nlarge, yet the distance, the partition, and the low voice in which both\nparties spoke, made it impossible for him to distinguish more than\nbroken sentences. From Mrs. Stafford he heard--'Could not longer be\nconcealed--in all probability may now remain unknown--the child, I will\nmyself attend to.' From Fitz-Edward, he could only catch indistinct\nsounds; his voice appearing to be lost in his emotion. But he seemed to\nbe thanking Mrs. Stafford, and lamenting his own unhappiness. His last\nspeech, in which his powers of utterance were returned, was--'Nothing\ncan ever erase the impression of your angelic goodness, best and\nloveliest of friends!--oh, continue it, I beseech you, to those for whom\nonly I am solicitous, and forgive all the trouble I have given you!'\n\nHe then hurried away. Mrs. Stafford, after remaining alone a moment as\nif to compose herself, went back to the parlour; and Crofts, who thought\nhe had heard enough, tho' he wished to have heard all, slunk from his\ncloset and walked into the garden; where being soon afterwards joined by\nMrs. Ashwood and Miss Galton, he, by relating the broken and disjointed\ndiscourse he had been witness to, left not a doubt remaining of the\ncause of Emmeline's precipitate retreat from Woodfield.\n\nAnd perhaps minds more candid than their's--minds untainted with the\nodious and hateful envy which ulcerated their's, might, from the\ncircumstances that attended her going and Fitz-Edward's behaviour, have\nconceived disadvantageous ideas of her conduct. But such was the\nuneasiness with which Mrs. Ashwood ever beheld superior merit, and such\nthe universal delight which Miss Galton took in defamation, that had\nnone of those circumstances existed, they would with equal malignity\nhave studied to ruin the reputation of Emmeline; and probably with equal\nsuccess--for against such attacks, innocence, however it may console\nit's possessor, is too frequently a feeble and inadequate defence!\n\nWhile the confederates, exulting in the certainty of Emmeline's ruin,\nwere manufacturing the letter which was to alarm the jealous and\nirascible spirit of Delamere, Fitz-Edward, (from whom Mrs. Stafford,\nbefore she would tell him any thing, had extorted a promise that he\nwould enquire no farther than what she chose to relate to him,) was\nrelieved from insupportable anguish by hearing that Lady Adelina was in\nsafe hands; but he lamented in bitterness of soul the despondency and\naffliction to which Mrs. Stafford had told him she entirely resigned\nherself. He knew not that Emmeline was with her, whatever he might\nsuspect; and Mrs. Stafford had protested to him, that if he made any\nattempt to discover the residence of Lady Adelina, or persisted in\nmeeting her brother, she would immediately relinquish all concern in the\naffair, and no longer interest herself in what his rashness would\ninevitably render desperate.\n\nHe solemnly assured her he would take no measures without her\nknowledge; and remained at Tylehurst, secluded from every body, and\nwaiting in fearful and anxious solicitude to hear of Lady Adelina by\nMrs. Stafford.\n\nDelamere, (still at Nice with his mother,) who with different sources of\nuneasiness thought the days and weeks insupportably long in which he\nlived only in the hope of seeing Emmeline at the end of six months, was\nroused from his involuntary resignation by the following letter, written\nin a hand perfectly unknown to him.\n\n\n  'Sir,\n\n    'A friend to your worthy and noble family writes this; which is\n  meant to serve you, and to undeceive you in regard to Miss\n  Mowbray--who, without any gratitude for the high honour you intend\n  her, is certainly too partial to another person. She is now gone\n  from Woodfield to escape observation; and none but Mrs. Stafford is\n  let into the secret of where she is. You will judge what end it is\n  to answer; but certainly none that bodes you good. One would have\n  supposed that the Colonel's being very often her attendant at\n  Woodfield might have made her stay there agreeable enough; but\n  perhaps (for I do not aver it) the young lady has some particular\n  reasons for wishing to have private lodgings. No doubt the Colonel\n  is a man of gallantry; but his friendship to you is rather more\n  questionable. The writer of this having very little knowledge of the\n  parties, can have no other motive than the love of justice, and\n  being sorry to see deceit and falsehood practised on a young\n  gentleman who deserves better, and who has a respectful tho' unknown\n  friend in\n\n                                                                 Y. Z.'\n\n  _London, July 22, 17--._\n\n\nThis infamous scroll had no sooner been perused by Delamere, than fury\nflashed from his eyes, and anguish seized his heart. But the moment the\nsuddenness of his passion gave way to reflection, the tumult of his mind\nsubsided, and he thought it must be an artifice of his mother's to\nseparate him from Emmeline. The longer he considered her inveterate\nantipathy to his marriage, the more he was convinced that this artifice,\nunworthy as it was, she was capable of conceiving, and, by means of the\nCrofts, executing, if she hoped by it to put an eternal conclusion to\nhis affection. He at length so entirely adopted this idea, that\ndetermining 'to be revenged and love her better for it,' and to\nsettle the matter very peremptorily with the Crofts' if they had been\nfound to interfere, he obtained a tolerable command over his temper and\nhis features, and joined Lady Montreville and Miss Delamere, whom he\nfound reading letters which they also had received from England. His\nmother asked slightly after his; and, in a few moments, Mr. Crofts\narrived, asking, with his usual assiduity, after the health of Lord\nMontreville and that of such friends as usually wrote to her Ladyship?\nShe answered his enquiries--and then desired to hear what news Sir\nRichard or his other correspondents had sent him?\n\n'My father's letters,' said he, 'contain little more than an order to\npurchase some particular sort of wine which he is very circumstantial,\nas usual, in telling me how to forward safely. He adds, indeed, that he\ncan allow my absence no longer than until the 20th of September.'--He\nsighed, and looked tenderly at Miss Delamere.\n\n'I have no other letters,' continued he, 'but one from James.'\n\n'And does he tell you no news,' asked Lady Montreville?\n\n'Nothing,' answered Crofts, carelessly, 'but gossip, which I believe\nwould not entertain your Ladyship.'\n\n'Oh, why should you fancy that,' returned she--'you know I love to hear\nnews, tho' about people I never saw or ever wish to see.'\n\n'James has been at Mr. Stafford's at Woodfield,' said he, 'where your\nLadyship has certainly no acquaintance.'\n\n'At Woodfield, Sir?' cried Delamere, unable to express his anxiety--'at\nWoodfield!--And what does he say of Woodfield?'\n\n'I don't recollect any thing very particular,' answered Crofts,\ncarelessly--'I believe I put the letter into my pocket.' He took it out.\n\n'Read it to us Crofts'--said Miss Delamere.\n\n\n    ----'I have lately passed a very agreeable month at Woodfield.\n  We were a large party in the house. Among other pleasant\n  circumstances, during my stay there, was a ball and _f\u00c3\u00aate\n  champ\u00c3\u00aatre_, given by Mr. Conway on his son's coming of age. It was\n  elegant, and well conducted beyond any entertainment of the sort I\n  ever saw. There were forty couple, and a great number of very\n  pretty women; but it was agreed on all hands that Miss Mowbray\n  would have eclipsed them all, who unluckily declined going. She\n  left Woodfield a day or two afterwards.'\n\n\nDelamere's countenance changed.--Crofts, as if looking for some other\nnews in his letter, hesitated, then smiled, and went on.--\n\n\n    'The gossip Fame has made a match for me with Mrs. Ashwood. I\n  wish she may be right. In some other of her stories I really think\n  her wrong, so I will not be the means of their circulation.'\n\n\n'The rest,' said Crofts, putting up the letter, 'is only about my\nfather's new purchases and other family affairs.'\n\nDelamere, who, in spite of his suspicions of Crofts' treachery, could\nnot hear this corroboration of his anonymous letter without a renewal of\nall his fears, left the room in doubt, suspence and wretchedness.\n\nThe seeds of jealousy and mistrust thus skilfully sown, could hardly\nfail of taking root in an heart so full of sensibility, and a temper so\nirritable as his. Again he read over his anonymous letter, and compared\nit with the intelligence which seemed accidentally communicated by\nCrofts; and with a fearful kind of enquiry compared the date and\ncircumstances. He dared hardly trust his mind with the import of this\ninvestigation; and found nothing on which to rest his hope, but that it\nmight be a concerted plan between his mother and Crofts.\n\nHis heart alternately swelling between the indignation such a\nsupposition created and shrinking with horror from the idea of perfidy\non the part of Emmeline, kept him in such a state of mind that he could\nhardly be said to possess his reason. But when he remembered how often\nhis extreme vivacity had betrayed him into error, and hazarded his\nlosing for ever all he held valuable on earth, he tried to subdue the\nacuteness of his feelings, and to support at least without betraying it,\nthe anguish which oppressed him, till the next pacquet from England,\nwhen it was possible a letter from Emmeline herself might dissipate his\ndoubts. Resolutely however resolving to call Crofts to a serious\naccount, if he found him accessory to a calumny so dark and diabolical.\n\nWhen the next post from England arrived, he saw, among the letters which\nwere delivered to him, one directed by the hand of Emmeline. He flew to\nhis own room, and with trembling hands broke the seal.\n\nIt was short, and he fancied unusually cold. Towards it's close, she\nmentioned that she was going to Bath for a few weeks with a friend, and\nas she did not know where she should lodge, thought he had better not\nwrite till she was again fixed at Woodfield.\n\nThat she should go to Bath in July, with a nameless friend, and quit so\nabruptly her beloved Mrs. Stafford--that she should apparently wish to\nevade his letters, and make her actual residence a secret--were a cloud\nof circumstances calculated to persuade him that some mystery involved\nher conduct; a mystery which the fatal letter served too evidently to\nexplain.\n\nAs if fire had been laid to the train of combustibles which had, since\nthe receipt of it, been accumulating in the bosom of Delamere, his\nfurious and uncontroulable spirit now burst forth. A temporary delirium\nseized him; he stamped round the room, and ran to his pistols, which\nfortunately were not charged. The noise he made brought Millefleur into\nthe room, whom he instantly caught by the collar, and shaking him\nviolently, cried--\n\n'Scoundrel!--why are not these pistols loaded?'\n\n'_Eh! eh! Monsieur!_' exclaimed Millefleur, almost strangled-'_que\nvoudriez vous?--vos pistolets!--Mon Dieu! que voudriez vous avec vos\npistolets?_'\n\n'Shoot _you_ perhaps, you blockhead!' raved Delamere, pushing furiously\nfrom him the trembling valet--then snatching up the pistols, he half\nkicked, half pushed him out of the room, and throwing them after him,\nordered him to clean and load them: after which he locked the door, and\nthrew himself upon the bed.\n\nThe resolution he had made in his cooler moments, never again to yield\nto such impetuous transports of passion, was now forgotten. He could not\nconquer, he could not even mitigate the tumultuous anguish which had\nseized him; but seemed rather to call to his remembrance all that might\njustify it's excess.\n\nHe remembered how positively Emmeline had forbidden his returning to\nEngland, tho' all he asked was to be allowed to see her for a few hours.\nHe recollected her long and invincible coldness; her resolute adherence\nto the promise she need not have given; and forgetting all the symptoms\nwhich he had before fondly believed he had discovered of her returning\nhis affection, he exaggerated every circumstance that indicated\nindifference, and magnified them into signs of absolute aversion.\n\nTho' he could not forget that Fitz-Edward had assisted him in carrying\nEmmeline away, and had on all occasions promoted his interest with her,\nthat recollection did not at all weaken the probability of his present\nattachment; for such was Delamere's opinion of Fitz-Edward's principles,\nthat he believed he was capable of the most dishonourable views on the\nmistress, or even on the wife of his friend. He tortured his imagination\nalmost to madness, by remembering numberless little incidents, which,\ntho' almost unattended to at the time, now seemed to bring the cruellest\nconviction of their intelligence--particularly that on the night he had\ntaken Emmeline from Clapham, Fitz-Edward was found there; tho' neither\nhis father or himself, who had repeatedly sent to his lodgings, could\neither find him at home or get any direction where to meet with him.\nAlmost all his late letters too had been dated from Tylehurst, where it\nwas certain he had passed the greatest part of the summer.--Fitz-Edward,\nfond of society, and courted by the most brilliant circles, shut himself\nup in a country house, distant from all his connections. And to what\ncould such an extraordinary change be owing, if not to his attachment to\nEmmeline Mowbray?\n\nIrritated by these recollections, he gave himself up to all the dreadful\ntorments of jealousy--jealousy even to madness; and he felt this\ncorrosive passion in all it's extravagance. It was violent in proportion\nto his love and his pride, and more insupportably painful in proportion\nto it's novelty; for except once at Swansea, when he fancied that\nEmmeline in her flight was accompanied by Fitz-Edward, he had never felt\nit before; however they might serve him as a pretence, Rochely and\nElkerton were both too contemptible to excite it.\n\nThe night approached; and without having regained any share of\ncomposure, he had at length determined to quit Nice the next day, that\nhis mother and Crofts might not be gratified with the sight of his\ndespair, and triumph in the detected perfidy of Emmeline.\n\nLady Montreville and her daughter were out when the letters arrived; and\nhe now apprehended that when they returned Millefleur might alarm them\nby an account of his frantic behaviour, and that they would guess it to\nhave been occasioned by his letters from England. Starting up,\ntherefore, he called the poor fellow to him, who was not yet recovered\nfrom his former terrifying menaces; and who approached, trembling, the\ntable where Delamere sat; his dress disordered, his eyes flashing fire,\nand his lips pale and quivering.\n\n'Come here, Sir!' sternly cried he.\n\nMillefleur sprung close to the table.\n\n'Have you cleaned and loaded my pistols?'\n\n'_Monsieur--je, je m'occupais--je, je--Monsieur, ils sont----_'\n\n'Fool, of what are you afraid?--what does the confounded _poltron_\ntremble for?'\n\n'_Mais Monsieur--c'est que--que--mais Monsieur, je ne scais!_'\n\n'_Tenez_, Mr. Millefleur!' said Delamere sharply--'Remember what I am\ngoing to say. Something has happened to vex me, and I shall go out\nto-morrow for a few days, or perhaps I may go to England. My mother is\nto know nothing of it, but what I shall myself tell her; therefore at\nyour peril speak of what has happened this evening, or of my intentions\nfor to-morrow. Come up immediately, and put my things into my\nportmanteaus, and put my fire arms in order. I shall take you with me.\nDavid need not be prepared till to-morrow. I shall go on horseback and\nshall want him also. The least failure on your part of executing these\norders, you will find very inconvenient--you know I will not be trifled\nwith.'\n\nMillefleur, frightened to death at the looks and voice of his master,\ndared not disobey; and Delamere employing him in putting up his cloaths\ntill after Lady Montreville came in, was, he thought, secure of his\nsecresy. He then made an effort, tho' a successless one, to hide the\nanguish that devoured him; and went down to supper. He found, that\nbesides their constant attendant Crofts, his mother and sister were\naccompanied by two other English gentlemen, and a French man of fashion\nand his sister, who full of the vivacity and gaiety of their country,\nkept up a lively conversation with Miss Delamere and the Englishmen. But\nDelamere hardly spoke--his eyes were wild and inflamed--his cheeks\nflushed--and deep sighs seemed involuntarily to burst from his heart.\nLady Montreville observed him, and then said--\n\n'Surely, Frederic, you are not well?'\n\n'Not very well,' said he; 'but I am otherwise, merely from the\nintolerable heat. I have had the head-ache all day.'\n\n'The head-ache!' exclaimed his mother--'Why then do you not go to bed?'\n\n'No,' answered he, 'I am better up. Since the heat is abated, I am in\nless pain. I will take a walk by the fine moon that I see is rising, and\nbe back again presently--and to-morrow,' continued he--'to-morrow, I\nshall go northward for a month. I cannot stay under this burning\natmosphere.'\n\nThen desiring the company not to move on his account, he arose from\ntable and hastened away.\n\n'Do, my good Crofts,' said Lady Montreville--'do follow Frederic--he\nfrightens me to death--he is certainly very ill.'\n\nCrofts hesitated a moment, being in truth afraid to interfere with\nDelamere's ramble while he was in a humour so gloomy; but on her\nLadyship's repeating her request, dared not shew his reluctance. He went\nout therefore under pretence of following him; while the party present,\nseeing Lady Montreville's distress, almost immediately departed.\n\nCrofts walked on without much desire to fulfill his commission; for\nDelamere, whenever he was obliged to associate with him, treated him\ngenerally with coldness, and sometimes rudely. There was, however, very\nlittle probability of his overtaking him; for Delamere had walked or\nrather run to a considerable distance from the street where his mother\nlived, and then wandering farther into the fields, had thrown himself\nupon the grass, and had forgotten every thing but Emmeline--'Emmeline\nand Fitz-Edward gone together!--the mistress on whom he had so fondly\ndoated!--the friend whom he had so implicitly trusted!' These cruel\nimages, drest in every form most fatal to his peace, tormented him, and\nthe agony of disappointed passion seemed to have affected his brain.\nDeep groans forced their way from his oppressed heart--he cursed his\nexistence, and seemed resolutely bent, in the gloominess of his despair,\nto shake it off and free himself from sufferings so intolerable.\n\nTo the first effusions of his phrenzy, a sullen calm, more alarming,\nsucceeded. He fixed his eyes on the moon which shone above him, but had\nno idea of what he saw, or where he was; his breath was short, his hands\nclenched; he seemed as if, having lost the power of complaint, he was\nunable to express the pain that convulsed his whole frame.\n\nWhile he continued in this situation, a favourite little spaniel of his\nmother's, of which he had from a boy been fond, ran up to him and licked\nhis hands and face. The caresses of an animal he had so long remembered,\ntouched some chord of the heart that vibrated to softer emotions than\nthose which had for the last three hours possessed him--he burst into\ntears.\n\n'Felix!' said he, sobbing, 'poor Felix!'\n\nThe dog, rejoicing to be noticed, ran barking round him; and presently\nafterwards, with hurried steps, came Miss Delamere, leaning on the arm\nof Crofts.\n\n'My God!' exclaimed she, almost screaming, 'here he is! Oh Frederic, you\nhave so terrified my mother! and Mr. Crofts has been two hours in search\nof you. Had it not been for the dog, we should not now have found you.\nMr. Crofts has returned twice to the house without you.'\n\n'Mr. Crofts may return then a third time,' said Delamere, 'and cease to\ngive himself such unnecessary trouble.'\n\n'But you will come with us, brother?--Surely you will now come home?'\n\n'At my leisure,' replied he, sternly--'Lady Montreville need be under no\napprehensions about me. I shall be at home presently. But I will not be\nimportuned! I will not be watched and followed! and above all, I will\nnot have a governor!'\n\nSo saying, he turned from them and walked another way; while they,\nseeing him so impracticable, could only return to report what they had\nseen to Lady Montreville. Delamere, however, who had taken another way,\nentered the house at the same moment.\n\nLady Montreville had strictly questioned Millefleur as to the cause of\nhis master's disorder; and the poor fellow, who dared not relate the\nfurious passion into which he had fallen on reading his letter,\ntrembled, prevaricated, stammered, and looked so white, that her\nLadyship, more alarmed, fancied she knew not what; and full of terror,\nhad sent out Crofts a second time, and the servants different ways, in\nsearch of her son. At length Crofts returning the second time without\nsuccess, Miss Delamere went with him herself; and the dog following her,\nled her to her brother. But before their return, Lady Montreville's\napprehensions had arisen to such an height, that a return of her fits\nseemed to threaten her, and with difficulty was she brought to her\nsenses when she saw him before her; and when he, moved by the keenness\nof her sorrow at his imaginary danger, assured her, in answer to her\nrepeated enquiries, that he was merely affected by the heat; that he had\nno material complaint, and should be quite well and in his usual spirits\nwhen he returned from the excursion he proposed going upon the next day.\nThen, being somewhat appeased, his mother suffered him to retire; and\ncalled her counsellor, Mr. Crofts, to debate whether in such a frame of\nmind she ought to allow the absence of Delamere? Crofts advised her by\nall means to let him go. He suspected indeed that the anonymous letter\nhad occasioned all the wild behaviour he had been witness to, and\nthought it very likely that Delamere might be going to England. But he\nknew that James Crofts and his fair associates were prepared for the\ncompletion of their project if he did; and his absence was, on account\nof Crofts' own affairs, particularly desirable.\n\nFor these reasons, he represented to Lady Montreville that opposition\nwould only irritate and inflame her son, without inducing him to stay.\nHe departed, therefore, the next morning, without any impediment on the\npart of his mother; but was yet undecided whither to go. While Crofts,\nno longer thwarted by his observation, or humbled by his haughty\ndisdain, managed matters so well, that in spite of the pride of noble\nblood, in spite of her reluctance to marry a commoner, he conquered and\nsilenced all the scruples and objections of Miss Delamere; and a young\nEnglish clergyman, a friend of his, coming to Nice, as both he and\nCrofts declared, _by the meerest accident in the world_, just about that\ntime, Crofts obtained her consent to a private marriage; and his friend\ntook especial care that no form might be wanting, to enable him legally\nto claim his bride, on their return to England.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nEmmeline had now been near a month at Bath, whence she had not written\nto Delamere. She had seldom done so oftener than once in six or eight\nweeks; and no reason subsisted at present for a more frequent\ncorrespondence.\n\nFar from having any idea that he would think her temporary removal\nextraordinary, she had not attempted to conceal it from him; and of his\njealousy of Fitz-Edward she had not the remotest suspicion. For tho'\nMrs. Ashwood's hints, and the behaviour of James Crofts, had left no\ndoubt of their ill opinion of her, yet she never supposed them capable\nof an attempt to impress the same idea on the mind of Delamere; and had\nno notion of the variety of motives which made the whole family of the\nCrofts, with which Mrs. Ashwood was now connected, solicitous to\nperpetuate the evil by propagating the scandalous story they had\nthemselves invented.\n\nUnconscious therefore of the anguish which preyed upon the heart of her\nunhappy lover, Emmeline gave her whole attention to Lady Adelina, and\nshe saw with infinite concern the encreasing weakness of her frame; with\nstill greater pain she observed, that by suffering her mind to dwell\ncontinually on her unhappy situation, it was no longer able to exert the\npowers it possessed; and that, sunk in hopeless despondence, her\nintellects were frequently deranged. Amid these alienations of reason,\nshe was still gentle, amiable and interesting; and as they were yet\nshort and slight, Emmeline flattered herself, that the opiates which her\nphysician (in consequence of the restless and anxious nights Lady\nAdelina had for some time passed) found it absolutely necessary to\nadminister, might have partly if not entirely occasioned this alarming\nsymptom.\n\nStill, however, the busy imagination of Emmeline perpetually represented\nto her impending sorrow, and her terror hourly encreased. She figured to\nherself the decided phrenzy, or the death of her poor friend; and unable\nto conquer apprehensions which she was yet compelled to conceal, she\nlived in a continual effort to appear chearful, and to soothe the\nwounded mind of the sufferer, by consolatory conversation; while she\nwatched her with an attention so sedulous and so painful, that only the\nexcellence of her heart, which persuaded her she was engaged in a task\ntruly laudable, could have supported her thro' such anxiety and fatigue.\n\nShe was, however, very desirous that as Mr. Godolphin was now in England\nhe might be acquainted with his sister's calamitous and precarious\nsituation; and she gently hinted to Lady Adelina, how great a\nprobability she thought there was, that such a man as her brother was\nrepresented to be, would in her sorrow and her suffering forget her\nerror.\n\nBut by the most distant idea of such an interview, she found Lady\nAdelina so violently affected, that she dared not again urge it; and was\ncompelled, in fearful apprehension, to await the hour which would\nprobably give the fair penitent to that grave, where she seemed to wish\nher disgrace and affliction might be forgotten.\n\nTo describe the anxiety of Emmeline when that period arrived, is\nimpossible; or the mingled emotions of sorrow and satisfaction, pleasure\nand pity, with which she beheld the lovely and unfortunate infant whose\nbirth she had so long desired, yet so greatly dreaded.\n\nLady Adelina had, till then, wished to die. She saw her child--and\nwished to live.--The physical people who attended her, gave hopes that\nshe might.--Supported by the tender friendship of Emmeline, and animated\nby maternal fondness, she determined to attempt it.\n\nEmmeline, now full of apprehension, now indulging feeble hopes, prayed\nfervently for her recovery; and zealously and indefatigably attended her\nwith more than her former solicitude. For three days, her hopes\ngradually grew stronger; when on the evening of the third, as she was\nsitting alone by the side of the bed where Lady Adelina had fallen into\na quiet sleep, she suddenly heard a sort of bustle in the next room; and\nbefore she could rise to put an end to it, a gentleman to whom she was a\nstranger, walked hastily into that where she was. On seeing her, he\nstarted and said--\n\n'I beg your pardon, Madam--but I was informed that here I might find\nLady Adelina Trelawny.'\n\nThe name of Trelawny, thus suddenly and loudly pronounced, awakened Lady\nAdelina. She started up--undrew the curtain--and fixing her eyes with a\nlook of terrified astonishment on the stranger, she exclaimed,\nfaintly--'Oh! my brother!--my brother William!' then sunk back on her\npillow, to all appearance lifeless.\n\nMr. Godolphin now springing forward, caught the cold and insensible hand\nwhich had opened the curtain; and throwing himself on his knees, cried--\n\n'Adelina! my love! are you ill?--have I then terrified and alarmed you?\nSpeak to me--dear Adelina--speak to me!'\n\nEmmeline, whose immediate astonishment at his presence had been lost in\nterror for his sister, had flown out of the room for the attendants, and\nnow returning, cried--\n\n'You have killed her, Sir!--She is certainly dead!--Oh, my God! the\nsudden alarm, the sudden sight of you, has destroyed her!'\n\n'I am afraid it has!' exclaimed Godolphin wildly, and hardly knowing\nwhat he said--'I am indeed afraid it has! My poor sister--my unhappy,\ndevoted Adelina!--have I then found you only to destroy you? But\nperhaps,' continued he, after a moment's pause, during which\nEmmeline and the nurse were chafing the hands and temples of\nthe dying patient--'perhaps she may recover. Send instantly for\nadvice--run--fly--let me go myself for assistance.'\n\nHe would now have run out of the room; but Emmeline, whose admirable\npresence of mind this sudden scene of terror had not conquered, stopped\nhim.\n\n'Stay, Sir,' said she, 'I beseech you, stay. You know not whither to go.\nI will instantly send those who do.'\n\nShe then left the room, and ordered a servant to fetch the physician;\nfor she dreaded least Mr. Godolphin should discover the real name and\nquality of the patient to those to whom he might apply; and on returning\nto the bed side, where Lady Adelina still lay without any signs of\nexistence, and by which her brother still knelt in speechless agony, her\nfears were again alive, least when the medical gentlemen arrived, his\ngrief and desperation should betray the secret to them. While her first\napprehension was for the life of her friend, these secondary\nconsiderations were yet extremely alarming--for she knew, that should\nLady Adelina recover, her life would be for ever embittered, if not\nagain endangered, by the discovery which seemed impending and almost\ninevitable.\n\nThe women who were about her having now applied every remedy they could\nthink of without success, began loudly to lament themselves. Emmeline,\ncommanding her own anguish, besought them to stifle their's, and not to\ngive way to fruitless exclamations while there was yet hope, but to\ncontinue their endeavours to recover their lady. Then addressing herself\nto Mr. Godolphin, she roused him from the stupor of grief in which he\nhad fallen, while he gazed with an impassioned and agonizing look on the\npale countenance of his sister.\n\n'Pardon me, Sir,' said she, 'if I entreat you to go down stairs and\nawait the arrival of the advice I have sent for. Should my poor friend\nrecover, your presence may renew and encrease the alarm of her spirits,\nand embarrass her returning recollection; and should she not recover,\nyou had better hear such mournful tidings in any place rather than\nthis.'\n\n'Oh! if I _do_ hear them,' answered he, wildly, 'it matters little\nwhere. But I _will_ withdraw, Madam, since you seem to desire it.'\n\nHe had hardly seen Emmeline before. He now turned his eyes mournfully\nupon her--'It is, I presume, Miss Mowbray,' said he, 'who thus, with an\nangel's tenderness in an angel's form, would spare the sorrows of a\nstranger?'\n\nEmmeline, unable to speak, led the way down to the parlour, and\nGodolphin silently followed her.\n\n'Go back,' said he, tremulously, as soon as they reached the room--'go\nback to my sister; your tender assiduity may do more for her than the\npeople about her. Your voice, your looks, will soothe and tranquillize\nher, should she awaken from her long insensibility. Ah! tell her, her\nbrother came only to rescue her from the misery of her unworthy\nlot--Tell her his affection, his brotherly affection, hopes to give her\nconsolation; and restore her--if it may yet be--to her repose. But go,\ndearest Miss Mowbray go!--somebody comes in--perhaps the physician.'\n\nEmmeline now opening the parlour door, found it to be indeed the\nphysician she expected; and with a fearful heart she followed him,\ninforming him, as they went up stairs, that the sudden appearance of\nMrs. St. Laure's brother, whom she had not seen for two or three years,\nhad thrown her into a fainting fit, from which not all their endeavours\nhad recovered her.\n\nHe remonstrated vehemently against the extreme indiscretion of such an\ninterview. Emmeline, who knew not by what strange chain of circumstances\nit had been brought about, had nothing to reply.\n\nSo feeble were the appearances of remaining life, that the physician\ncould pronounce nothing certainly in regard to his patient. He gave,\nhowever, directions to her attendants; but after every application had\nbeen used, all that could be said was, that she was not actually dead.\nAs soon as the physician had written his prescription and retired,\nEmmeline recollected the painful state of suspense in which she had left\nMr. Godolphin, and trying to recover courage to go thro' the painful\nscene before her, she went down to him.\n\nAs she opened the door, he met her.\n\n'I have seen the doctor,' said he, in a broken and hurried voice--'and\nfrom his account I am convinced Adelina is dying.'\n\n'I hope not,' faintly answered Emmeline. 'There is yet a possibility,\ntho' I fear no great probability of her recovery.'\n\n'My Adelina!' resumed he, walking about the room--'my Adelina! for whose\nsake I so anxiously wished to return to England--Gracious God! I am come\ntoo late to assist her! Some strange mystery surely hangs over her!\nLong lost to all her friends, I find her here dying! The sight of me,\ninstead of relieving her sorrow seems to have accelerated her\ndissolution! And you, Madam, to whose goodness she appears to be so\ngreatly indebted--may I ask by what fortunate circumstance, lost and\nobscure as she has been, she has acquired such a friend?'\n\nEmmeline, shuddering at the apprehension of enquiries she found it\nimpossible to answer, was wholly at a loss how to reply to this. She\nknew not of what Mr. Godolphin was informed--of what he was ignorant;\nand dreaded to say too much, or to be detected in a false\nrepresentation. She therefore, agitated and hesitating, gravely said--\n\n'It is not now a time, Sir, to ask any thing relative to Lady Adelina. I\nam myself too ill to enter into conversation; and wish, as you have been\nyourself greatly affected, that you would now retire, and endeavour to\nmake yourself as easy as you can. To-morrow may, perhaps, afford us more\nchearful prospects--or at least this cruel suspense will be over, and\nthe dear sufferer at peace.'\n\nShe sobbed, and turned away. Godolphin rising, said in a faultering\nvoice--\n\n'Yes, I will go! since my stay can only encrease the pain of that\ngenerous and sensible heart. I will go--but not to rest!--I cannot rest!\nBut do you try, most amiable creature! to obtain some repose--Try, I\nbeseech you, to recover your spirits, which have been so greatly\nhurried.'\n\nHe knew not what he said; and was hastening out of the room, when\nEmmeline, recollecting how ardently Lady Adelina had desired the\nconcealment of her name and family, stopped him as he was quitting her.\n\n'Yet one thing, Captain Godolphin, allow me to entreat of you?'\n\n'What can I refuse you?' answered he, returning.\n\n'Only--are you known at Bath?'\n\n'Probably I may. It is above three years since I was in England, and\nmuch longer since I have been here. But undoubtedly some one or other\nwill know me.'\n\n'Then do indulge me in one request. See as few people as you can; and if\nyou accidentally meet any of your friends, do not say that Lady Adelina\nis here.'\n\n'Not meet any one if I can avoid it!--and if I do, not speak of my\nsister! And why is all this?--why this concealment, this\nmystery?--why--'\n\nEmmeline, absolutely overcome, sat down without speaking. Godolphin,\nseeing her uneasiness, said--\n\n'But I will not distress _you_, Madam, by farther questions. Your\ncommands shall be sufficient. I will stifle my anxiety and obey you.'\nThen bowing respectfully, he added--'To-morrow, at as early an hour as I\ndare hope for admittance, I shall be at the door. Heaven bless and\nreward the fair and gentle Miss Mowbray--and may it have mercy on my\npoor Adelina!'--He sighed deeply, and left the house.\n\nLady Adelina, tho' not so entirely insensible, was yet but little\namended. But as what alteration there was, was for the better, Emmeline\nendeavoured to recall her own agitated and dissipated spirits. The\nextraordinary scene which had just passed, was still present to her\nimagination; the last words of Godolphin, still vibrated in her ears.\n'Fair and gentle Miss Mowbray!' repeated she. 'He knows my name; yet\nseems ignorant of every thing that relates to his sister!'\n\nHer astonishment at this circumstance was succeeded by reflecting on the\nunpleasant task she must have if Mr. Godolphin should again enquire into\nher first acquaintance with his sister. To relate to him the melancholy\nstory she had heard, would, she found, be an undertaking to which she\nwas wholly unequal; and she was equally averse to the invention of a\nplausible falsehood. From this painful apprehension she meditated how to\nextricate herself; but the longer she thought of it, the more she\ndespaired of it. The terrors of such a conversation hourly augmented;\nand wholly and for ever to escape from it, she sometimes determined to\nwrite. But from executing that design, was withheld by considering that\nif Godolphin was of a fiery and impetuous temper, he would probably,\nwithout reflection or delay, fly to vengeance, and precipitate every\nevil which Lady Adelina dreaded.\n\nAfter having exhausted every idea on the subject, she could think of\nnothing on which her imagination could rest, but to send to Mrs.\nStafford, acquaint her with the danger of Lady Adelina, and conjure her\nif possible to come to her. This she knew she would do unless some\nsingular circumstance in her own family prevented her attention to her\nfriends.\n\nResolved to embrace therefore this hope, she dispatched an hasty billet\nby an express to Woodfield; and then betook herself to a bed on the\nfloor, which she had ordered to be placed by the side of that where Lady\nAdelina, in happy tho' dangerous insensibility, still seemed to repose\nalmost in the arms of death.\n\nEmmeline could not, however, obtain even a momentary forgetfulness. Tho'\nshe could not repent her attention to the unhappy Lady Adelina, she was\nyet sensible of her indiscretion in having put herself into the\nsituation she was now in; the cruel, unfeeling world would, she feared,\ncondemn her; and of it's reflections she could not think without pain.\nBut her heart, her generous sympathizing heart, more than acquitted--it\nrepaid her.\n\nTowards the middle of the night, Lady Adelina, who had made two or three\nfaint efforts to speak, sighed, and again in faint murmurs attempted to\nexplain herself. Emmeline started up and eagerly listened; and in a low\nwhisper heard her ask for her child.\n\nEmmeline ordered it instantly to be brought; and those eyes which had so\nlately seemed closed for ever, were opened in search of this beloved\nobject: then, as if satisfied in beholding it living and well, they\nclosed again, while she imprinted a kiss on it's little hand. She then\nasked for Emmeline; who, delighted with this apparent amendment,\nprevailed on her to take what had been ordered for her. She appeared\nstill better in a few moments, but was yet extremely languid.\n\n'I have had a dreadful dream, my Emmeline,' said she, at length--'a long\nand dreadful dream! But it is gone--you are here; my poor little boy too\nis well; and this alarming vision will I hope haunt me no more.'\n\nEmmeline, who feared that the dream was indeed a reality, exhorted her\nto think only of her recovery; of which, added she cheerfully, we have\nno longer any doubt.\n\n'Comfortable and consoling angel!' sighed Lady Adelina--'your presence\nis surely safety. Do not leave me!'\n\nEmmeline promised not to quit the room; and elate with hopes of her\nfriend's speedy restoration to health, fell herself into a tranquil and\nrefreshing slumber.\n\nOn awakening the next morning, she found Lady Adelina much better; but\nstill, whenever she spoke, dwelling on her supposed dream, and sometimes\ntalking with that incoherence which had for some weeks before so greatly\nalarmed her. Her own dread of meeting Godolphin was by no means\nlessened; and to prevent an immediate interview, she dispatched to him\na note.\n\n\n  'Sir,\n\n  'I am happy in having it in my power to assure you that our dear\n  patient is much better. But as uninterrupted tranquillity is\n  absolutely necessary, that, and other considerations, induce me to\n  beg you will forbear coming hither to day. You may depend on having\n  hourly intelligence, and that we shall be desirous of the pleasure\n  of seeing you when the safety of my friend admits it.\n\n                                       I have the honour to be, Sir,\n                                           your most humble servant,\n                                                    EMMELINE MOWBRAY.'\n\n     _Sept._ 20,17--.\n\n\nTo this note, Mr. Godolphin answered--\n\n\n  'If Miss Mowbray will only allow me to wait on her for one moment\n  in the parlour, I will not again trespass on her time till I have\n  her own permission.\n\n                                                             W. G.'\n\n\nThis request, Emmeline was obliged, with whatever reluctance, to comply\nwith. She therefore sent a verbal acquiescence; and repaired to the\nbed-side of Lady Adelina, who had asked for her.\n\n'Will you pardon my folly, my dear Emmeline,' said she languidly--'but I\ncannot be easy till I have told you what a strange idea has seized me. I\nseemed, last night, I know not at what time, to be suddenly awakened by\na voice which loudly repeated the name of Trelawny. Startled by the\nsound, I thought I undrew the curtain, and saw my brother William, who\nstood looking angrily on me. I felt greatly terrified; and growing\nextremely sick, I lost the vision. But now again it's recollection\nharrasses my imagination; and the image of my brother, sterner, and with\na ruder aspect than he was wont to wear, still seems present before me.\nOh! he was accustomed to be all goodness and gentleness, and to love his\npoor Adelina. But now he too will throw me from him--he too will detest\nand despise me--Or perhaps,' continued she, after a short\npause--'perhaps he is dead. I am not superstitious--but this dream\npursues me.'\n\nEmmeline, who had hoped that the very terror of this sudden interview\nhad obliterated it's remembrance, said every thing she thought likely\nto quiet her mind, and to persuade her that the uneasy images\nrepresented in her imperfect slumbers were merely the effect of her\nweakness and perturbed spirits.\n\nThe impression, however, was too strong to be effaced by arguments. It\nstill hung heavy on her heart, irritated the fever which had before been\nonly slight, and deprived her almost entirely of sleep; or if she slept,\nshe again fancied herself awakened by her brother, angrily repeating the\nname of Trelawny.\n\nSometimes, starting in terror from these feverish dreams, she called on\nher brother to pardon and pity her; sometimes in piercing accents\ndeplored his death, and sometimes besought him to spare Fitz-Edward.\nThese incoherences were particularly distressing; as names were often\nheard by the attendants which Emmeline hoped to have concealed; and it\nwas hardly possible longer to deceive the physician and apothecary who\nattended her.\n\nWith an uneasy heart, and a countenance pensively expressive of it's\nfeelings, she went down to receive Captain Godolphin in the parlour.\n\n'I fear, Miss Mowbray,' said he, as soon as they were seated, 'you will\nthink me too ready to take advantage of your goodness. But there is that\nappearance of candour and compassion about you, that I determined rather\nto trust to your goodness for pardon, than to remain longer in a state\nof suspense about my sister, which I have already found most\ninsupportable. In the note you honoured me with to day you say she is\nbetter. Is she then out of danger? Has she proper advice?'\n\n'She has the best advice, Sir. I cannot, however, say that she is out of\ndanger, but'--She hesitated, and knew not how to proceed.\n\n'But--you hope, rather than believe, she will recover,' cried Godolphin\neagerly.\n\n'I both hope it and believe it. Mr. Godolphin, you yesterday did me the\nhonour to suppose I had been fortunate enough to be of some service to\nLady Adelina; suffer me to take advantage of a supposition so\nflattering, and to claim a sort of right to ask in my turn a favour.'\n\n'Surely I shall consider it as an honour to receive, and as happiness to\nobey, any command of Miss Mowbray's.'\n\n'Promise me then to observe the same silence in regard to your sister as\nI asked of you last night. Trust me with her safety, and believe it\nwill not be neglected. But you must neither speak of her to others, or\nquestion me about her.'\n\n'Good God! from whence can arise the necessity for these precautions!\nWhat dreadful obscurity surrounds her! What am I to fear? What am I to\nsuppose?'\n\n'You will not, then,' said Emmeline, gravely--'you will not oblige me,\nby desisting from all questions 'till this trifling restraint can be\ntaken off?'\n\n'I will, I do promise to be guided wholly by you; and to bear, however\ndifficult it may be, the suspense, the frightful suspense in which I\nmust remain. Tell me, however, that Adelina is not in immediate danger.\nBut, but' added he, as if recollecting himself, 'may I not apply for\ninformation on that head to her physician?'\n\n'Not for the world!' answered Emmeline, with unguarded quickness--'not\nfor the world!'\n\n'Not for the world!'--repeated Godolphin, with an accent of\nastonishment. 'Heaven and earth! But I have promised to ask nothing--I\nmust obey--and will now release you, Madam.'\n\nGodolphin then took his leave; and Emmeline, whose heart had throbbed\nviolently throughout this dialogue, sat down alone to compose and\nrecollect herself. She saw, that to keep Godolphin many days ignorant of\nthe truth would be impossible: and from the eager anxiety of his\nquestions, she feared that all the horrors Lady Adelina's troubled\nimagination had represented would be realized--apprehensions, which\nseemed armed with new terror since she had seen and conversed with this\nWilliam Godolphin, of whose excellent heart and noble spirit she had\nbefore heard so much both from Lady Adelina and Fitz-Edward, and whose\nappearance seemed to confirm the favourable impression those accounts\nhad given her.\n\nGodolphin, who was now about five and twenty, had passed the greatest\npart of his life at sea. The various climates he had visited had\ndeprived his complexion of much of it's English freshness; but his face\nwas animated by dark eyes full of intelligence and spirit; his hair,\ngenerally carelessly dressed, was remarkably fine, and his person tall,\nlight, and graceful, yet so commanding, that whoever saw him immediately\nand involuntarily felt their admiration mingled with respect. His whole\nfigure was such as brought to the mind ideas of the race of heroes from\nwhich he was descended; his voice was particularly grateful to the ear,\nand his address appeared to Emmeline to be a fortunate compound of the\ninsinuating softness of Fitz-Edward with the fire and vivacity of\nDelamere. Of this, however, she could inadequately judge, as he was now\nunder such depression of spirits: and however pleasing he appeared,\nEmmeline, who conceived herself absolutely engaged to Delamere, thought\nof him only as the brother of Lady Adelina; yet insensibly she felt\nherself more than ever interested for the event of his hearing how\nlittle Fitz-Edward had deserved the warm friendship he had felt for him.\nAnd her thoughts dwelling perpetually on that subject, magnified the\npainful circumstances of the approaching \u00c3\u00a9claircissemen; while her fears\nfor Lady Adelina's life, who continued to languish in a low fever with\nfrequent delirium, so harrassed and oppressed her, that her own health\nwas visibly affected. But without attending to it, she passed all her\nhours in anxiously watching the turns of Lady Adelina's disorder; or,\nwhen she could for a moment escape, in giving vent to her full heart by\nweeping over the little infant, whose birth, so similar to her own,\nseemed to render it to her a more interesting and affecting object. She\nlamented the evils to which it might be exposed; tho' of a sex which\nwould prevent it's encountering the same species of sorrow as that which\nhad embittered her own life. Of her friendless and desolate situation,\nshe was never more sensible than now. She felt herself more unhappy than\nshe had ever yet been; and would probably have sunk under her extreme\nuneasiness, had not the arrival of Mrs. Stafford, at the end of three\ndays, relieved her from many of her fears and apprehensions.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nMrs. Stafford no sooner heard from Emmeline that Godolphin was yet\nignorant of the true reason of Lady Adelina's concealment, than she saw\nthe necessity of immediately explaining it; and this task, however\npainful, she without hesitation undertook.\n\nHe was therefore summoned to their lodgings by a note from Emmeline, who\non his arrival introduced him to Mrs. Stafford, and left them together;\nwhen, with as much tenderness as possible, and mingling with the\nmortifying detail many representations of the necessity there was for\nhis conquering his resentment, she at length concluded it; watching\nanxiously the changes in Godolphin's countenance, which sometimes\nexpressed only pity and affection for his sister, sometimes rage and\nindignation against Fitz-Edward.\n\nBoth the brothers of Lady Adelina had been accustomed to consider her\nwith peculiar fondness. The unfortunate circumstance of her losing her\nmother immediately after her birth, seemed to have given her a\nmelancholy title to their tenderness; and the resemblance she bore to\nthat dear mother, whom they both remembered, and on whose memory their\nfather dwelt with undiminished regret, endeared her to them still more.\nTo these united claims on the heart and the protection of William\nGodolphin, another was added equally forcible, in a letter written by\nhis father with the trembling hand of anxious solicitude, when he felt\nhimself dying, and when, looking back with lingering affection on the\nchildren of her whom he hoped soon to rejoin, he saw with anguish his\nyoungest daughter liable from her situation to deviate into\nindiscretion, and surrounded by the numberless dangers which attend on a\nyoung and beautiful woman, whose husband has neither talents to attach\nher affections or judgment to direct her actions. Lord Westhaven,\nconscious of her hazardous circumstances, and feeling in his last\nmoments the keenest anguish, in knowing that his mistaken care had\nexposed her to them, hoped, by interesting both her brothers to watch\nover her, that he should obviate the dangers he apprehended. He had\ntherefore, in all their conversations, recommended her to his eldest\nson; and as he was not happy enough to embrace the younger before he\ndied, had addressed to him a last letter on the same subject.\n\nSuch were the powerful ties that bound Mr. Godolphin to love and defend\nLady Adelina with more than a brother's fondness. Hastening therefore to\nobey the dying injunctions of his father, and in the hope of rendering\nthe life of this beloved sister, if not happy, at least honourable and\ncontented, he had heard, that she had clandestinely absented herself\nfrom her family, and after a long search had found her abandoned to\nremorse and despair; her reputation blasted; her health ruined; her\nintellects disordered; and all by the perfidy of a man, in whom he, from\nlong friendship, and his sister, from family connection, had placed\nunbounded confidence.\n\nTho' Godolphin had one of the best tempers in the world--a temper which\nthe roughness of those among whom he lived had only served to soften and\nhumanize, and which was immovable by the usual accidents that ruffle\nothers, yet he had also in a great excess all those keen feelings, which\nfill a heart of extreme sensibility; added to a courage, that in the\nhour of danger had been proved to be as cool as it was undaunted. Of him\nmight be said what was the glorious praise of immortal Bayard--that he\nwas '_sans peur et sans reproche_;'[1] and educated with a high sense of\nhonour himself, as well as possessing a heart calculated to enjoy, and a\nhand to defend, the unblemished dignity of his family, all his passions\nwere roused and awakened by the injury it had sustained from\nFitz-Edward, and he beheld him as a monster whom it was infamy to\nforgive. Hardly therefore had Mrs. Stafford concluded her distressing\nrecital, than, as if commanding himself by a violent effort, he thanked\nher warmly yet incoherently for her unexampled goodness to his sister,\nrecommended her still to her generous care, and the friendship of Miss\nMowbray, and without any threat against Fitz-Edward, or even a comment\non what he had heard, arose to depart. But Mrs. Stafford, more alarmed\nby this determined tho' quiet resentment and by the expression of his\ncountenance than if he had burst into exclamations and menaces,\nperceived that the crisis was now come when he must either be persuaded\nto conquer his just resentment, or by giving it way destroy, while he\nattempted to revenge, the fame of his sister.\n\nShe besought him therefore to sit down a moment; and when he had done\nso, she told him, that if he really thought himself under any\nobligations to Miss Mowbray or to her for the services they had been so\nfortunate as to render Lady Adelina, his making all they had been doing\nineffectual, would be a most mortifying return; and such must be the\ncase, if he rashly flew to seek vengeance on Fitz-Edward: 'for that you\nhave such a design,' continued she, 'I have no doubt; allow me, however,\nto suppose that I have, by doing your sister some good offices, acquired\na right to speak of her affairs.'\n\n'Surely,' answered Mr. Godolphin, 'you have; and surely I must hear with\nrespect and attention, tho' possibly not with conviction, every opinion\nwith which you may honour me.'\n\nShe then represented to him, with all the force of reason, how little he\ncould remedy the evil by hazarding his own life or by taking that of\nFitz-Edward.\n\n'At present,' continued she, 'the secret is known only to me, Miss\nMowbray, and Lady Adelina's woman; if it is farther exposed, the heirs\nof Mr. Trelawny, who are so deeply interested, will undoubtedly take\nmeasures to prove that the infant has no just claim to the estate they\nso eagerly expect. Mr. Trelawny's sister has already entertained\nsuspicions, which the least additional information would give her\ngrounds to pursue, and the whole affair must then inevitably become\npublic. Surely this consideration alone should determine you--why then\nneed I urge others equally evident and equally forcible.'\n\nGodolphin acknowledged that there was much of truth in the arguments she\nused; but denied that any consideration should influence him to forgive\nthe man who had thus basely and ungenerously betrayed the confidence of\nhis family.\n\n'However,' added he again, checking the heat into which he feared a\nlonger conversation on this subject might betray him--'I have not yet,\nMadam, absolutely formed the resolution of which you seem so\napprehensive; and am indeed too cruelly hurt to be able to talk longer\non the subject. Suffer me therefore once more to bid you a good day!'\n\nBut the encreasing gloom of his countenance, and forced calm of his\nmanner, appeared to be symptoms so unfavourable, that Mrs. Stafford\nthought there was no hope of being able to prevent an immediate and\nfatal meeting between him and Fitz-Edward but by engaging him in a\npromise at least to delay it; this she attempted by the most earnest\narguments, and the most pressing persuasions; but all she could obtain\nwas an assurance that he would remain at Bath 'till the next day, and\nsee her again in the evening.\n\nIn the mean time the delirium of Lady Adelina, (which had recurred at\nintervals ever since the transient sight she had of her brother) more\nfrequently, and with more alarming symptoms, returned; and the fever\nwhich had at first threatened the loss of her life, now seemed to be\nfixing on her brain, and to menace, by a total deprivation of reason,\nreducing her to a condition to which death itself must be preferable.\nShe still, even in her wildest wanderings, knew Emmeline, and still\ncaressed her little boy; but much of her time passed in incoherent and\nrambling discourse; in which she talked of Fitz-Edward and her brother\nWilliam, and held with them both imaginary dialogues. Sometimes she\ndeprecated the wrath of her elder brother: and then her disordered fancy\nran to the younger; to him from whom she had, in her early life, found\npity and protection in all her little sorrows.\n\nMrs. Stafford thought it too hazardous to let her again see her brother,\nwhile her intellects were thus disarranged; as she trembled lest she\nshould start into actual madness. But it was absolutely necessary to do\nsomething; not only because Mr. Godolphin's impatience made every delay\ndangerous, but because it was hardly possible to keep the secret from\nthe physicians and attendants, who had already heard much more than they\nought to have known.\n\nShe determined, therefore, after consulting with Emmeline, to introduce\nGodolphin into the room adjoining to that where Lady Adelina now sat\nsome hours every day in an easy chair. The affecting insanity of his\nunhappy sister, and the mournful and pathetic entreaties she frequently\nused, were likely, in the opinion of the fair friends, to effectuate\nmore than their most earnest persuasions; and prevail on him to drop all\nthoughts of that resentment, which could not cure but might encrease her\ncalamities.\n\nMrs. Stafford had heard from him, that he gained information as to the\nplace of his sister's residence from the mother of Lady Adelina's woman;\nwho being the reduced widow of a clergyman, resided in the Bishop's\nalms-houses at Bromley, where her daughter frequently sent her such\nassistance as her own oeconomy, or the bounty of her lady, enabled her\nto supply. A few weeks before, she had sent her a note for ten pounds;\nand not apprehending that an enquiry would be made of her, had desired\nher to acknowledge the receipt of it, and direct to her at Bath, where\nshe said her lady was with a Miss Mowbray.\n\nLady Clancarryl, among many expedients to recover traces of her sister,\nhad at length recollected this widow, and had desired Mr. Godolphin to\nmake immediate enquiry of her.\n\nHe had hastened therefore to Bromley, and easily found the poor woman,\nwho was paralytic and almost childish. Her letters were read for her by\none of her neighbours; a person, who, being present at the arrival of\nMr. Godolphin, immediately found that something was to be got; and\nbusily put into his hands the very letter which had enclosed the note,\nand which contained the direction.\n\nHe eagerly copied the address; and leaving a handsome present for the\nuse of the old widow, he delayed not a moment to set out for Bath,\nwhere he soon found the house, and where he had enquired for Lady\nAdelina Trelawny.\n\nThe servant of the house who opened the door assured him no such person\nwas there. He supposed that for some reason or other she was denied; and\ninsisting on being allowed to go up stairs, had entered the room in the\nabrupt manner which had so greatly alarmed his sister.\n\nIn hopes of counteracting the fatal effects of the discovery which had\nunavoidably followed this interview, Godolphin was, on his return in the\nafternoon, introduced into the dining-room, which opened into Lady\nAdelina's bed-chamber. The door was a-jar; the partition thin; and Mrs.\nStafford was pretty well assured that the poor patient would be heard\ndistinctly. Godolphin came in, pale from the conflict of his mind; and\nall his features expressed anger and sorrow, with which he seemed vainly\nstruggling. He bowed, and sat down in silence.\n\nMrs. Stafford only was in the room; and as soon as he was seated, said,\nin a low voice, yet with forced chearfulness--\n\n'Well, Sir, I hope that Miss Mowbray and myself have prevailed on you to\ndrop at present every other design than the truly generous one of\nhealing the wounded heart of our fair unfortunate friend.'\n\n'And shall he who has wounded it,' slowly and sternly replied\nGodolphin--'shall he who has wounded it so basely, escape me?'\n\nAt this instant Lady Adelina, who had been some time silent, exclaimed\nhastily--'Oh! spare him! my dear brother! and spare your poor Adelina!\nwho will not trouble--who will not disgrace you long!'\n\n'Where is she?' said Godolphin, starting--'Good God! what is it I hear?'\n\n'Your unhappy sister,' answered Mrs. Stafford; 'whom the idea of your\ndetermined vengeance has already driven to distraction.'\n\nAgain Lady Adelina spoke. Her brother listened in breathless anguish.\n\n'Ah! William!--and are _you_ grown cruel? You, on whom I depended for\npity and protection?'\n\n'Surely,' said he, 'surely she knows I am here?'\n\n'No,' answered Mrs. Stafford, 'she knows nothing. But this fear has\nincessantly pursued her; and since she saw you she dwells more\nfrequently on it, tho' her erring memory sometimes wanders to other\nobjects.'\n\n'It is very true, my Lord!' cried Lady Adelina, with affected calmness,\nher thoughts wavering again towards Lord Westhaven--'It is all very\ntrue! I have deserved all your reproaches! I am ready to make all the\natonement I can! Then you will both of you, my brothers, be\nsatisfied--for William has told me that if I died he should be content,\nfor then all might be forgotten.' She ended with a deep sigh; and\nGodolphin, wildly starting from his seat, said--\n\n'This is too much! you cannot expect me to bear this!--let me go to\nher!'\n\n'Would you go then,' answered Mrs. Stafford, 'to confirm her fears and\nto drive her to deeper desperation? If you see her, it must be to soothe\nand comfort her; to assure her of your forgiveness, and that you will\nbury your resentment against----'\n\n'Accursed! doubly accursed be the infamous villain who has driven her to\nthis! And must I bear it tamely! Oh! injured memory of my father!--oh!\nmy poor, undone sister!' He walked about the room; the tears ran from\nhis eyes; and Mrs. Stafford, fearing that his hurried step and deep sobs\nwould be heard by Lady Adelina, determined to bring the scene to a\ncrisis and not to lose the influence she hoped she had gained on his\nmind. She therefore went into the other room, and shutting the door,\nadvanced with a smile towards the lovely lunatic.\n\n'What will you say, my dear Adelina, if I bring you the best news you\ncan possibly hear?'\n\n'News!' repeated Lady Adelina, looking at her with eyes which too\nplainly denoted her unsettled mind--'News!--Ah! dear Madam! I know very\nwell that all the world is happy but me; and if you are happy, I am very\nglad; but as to _me_--Do you indeed think it is reasonable I should part\nwith him?'\n\n'With whom?' said Mrs. Stafford.\n\n'Why, one condition which they insist upon is, that I should give up my\npoor little one to them, and never ask to see him again. William was the\nmost urgent for this--William, who used to be so good, so gentle, so\ncompassionate to every body! Alas! he is now more cruel and relentless\nthan the rest!'\n\n'So far from it,' said Mrs. Stafford, 'your brother William loves you as\nmuch as ever; he will come and tell you so himself if you will only be\ncomposed, and talk less strangely.'\n\n'To see _me_!' exclaimed she, as if suddenly recovering her\nrecollection--'Oh! when?--where?--how?'\n\nBut again it forsook her; and she continued--\n\n'Ah! he comes perhaps to tell me of the blood he has spilt, and to load\nme with reproaches for having obliged him to destroy a friend whom he\nonce loved. If that is indeed so, why let him come and plunge another\ndagger in this poor heart, which has always loved him!'\n\nShe was silent a moment, and then languidly went on--\n\n'I thought some time since that I saw him, and Miss Mowbray was with\nhim; but it was only a dream, for I know he is in Jamaica: and when he\n_does_ come home, he will harden his heart against me--he will be my\njudge, and sternly will he judge me--he will forget that he is my\nbrother!'\n\n'Never! my poor Adelina,' cried Godolphin, rushing into the room, 'never\ncan I forget that I am your brother--never can I cease to feel for you\ncompassion and tenderness.'\n\nHe would have taken her in his arms; but struck by the dreadful\nalteration that appeared in her face and figure, he stopt short, and\nlooking at her with silent horror, seemed incapable of uttering what he\nfelt.\n\nShe knew him; but could neither speak or shed a tear for some moments.\nAt length, she held out to him her emaciated hand.\n\n'It is _indeed_ William!' said she. 'He seems, too, very sorry for me.\nMy dear brother, do you then pardon and pity the poor Adelina?'\n\n'Both! both!' answered Godolphin, sobbing, and seating himself by her.\nHe threw his arms round her, and her pale cheek rested on his bosom,\nwhile her eyes were fixed on his face.\n\n'Stay!' exclaimed she, after a momentary pause, and disengaging herself\nsuddenly from him--'Stay! I have yet another question, if I dared ask\nit! Do you know all? and have you no blood to answer for, on my account?\nWill you assure me you will not seek it?'\n\n'For mercy's sake!' said Mrs. Stafford, 'satisfy her, Mr.\nGodolphin--satisfy her at once--you see to what is owing this alienation\nof her reason.'\n\n'No,' reassumed the afflicted Adelina, 'you need not answer me; I see\nyou cannot--will not forgive----'\n\n'Name him not, Adelina!' sternly and quickly answered he--'my soul\nrecoils at his idea! I cannot, I will not promise any thing!'\n\nAt this period, Emmeline, who was unwilling to trust the servants in\nsuch a moment, entered with the infant of Lady Adelina sleeping in her\narms.\n\n'See,' said Mrs. Stafford, 'a little unfortunate creature, whose\ninnocence must surely plead forcibly to you: he comes to join our\nintreaties to you to spare his mother!'\n\nEmmeline laid the infant in the lap of Lady Adelina, who was yet unable\nto shed a tear. Godolphin beheld it with mingled horror and pity; but\nthe latter sentiment seemed to predominate; and Emmeline, whose voice\nwas calculated to go to the heart, began to try it's influence; and\nimploring him to be calm, and to promise his sister an eternal oblivion\nof the past, she urged every argument that should convince him of it's\nnecessity, and every motive that could affect his reason or his\ncompassion.\n\nHe gazed on her with reverence and admiration while she spoke, and\nseemed greatly affected by what she said. Animated by the hope of\nsuccess, her eyes were lightened up with new brilliancy, and her glowing\ncheeks and expressive features became more than ever attractive. A\nconvulsive laugh from Lady Adelina interrupted her, and drew the\nattention of Godolphin entirely to his sister. Emmeline, who saw her\nreason again forsaking her, took the sleeping baby from her lap. She had\nhardly done so, before, trying to rise from her chair, she shrieked\naloud--for again the image of Fitz-Edward, dying by the hand of her\nbrother, was before her.\n\n'See!' cried she, 'see! there he lies!--he is already expiring! yet\nWilliam forgives him not! What? would you strike him again? now! while\nhe is dying?--Go! cruel, cruel brother!' attempting to put Godolphin\nfrom her--'Go!--Oh! touch me not with those polluted hands, they are\nstained with human blood!' A convulsive shudder and a deep sigh seemed\nto exhaust all her remaining strength, and she fell back in her chair,\npale and faint; and with fixed, unmeaning eyes, appeared no longer\nconscious even of the terrors which pursued her.\n\nBut the look of incurable anguish which her features wore; the wild\nimport of her words; and the sight of the unfortunate child, who seemed\nborn only to share her wretchedness; could not long be beheld unmoved by\na heart like Godolphin's, which possessed all that tenderness that\ndistinguishes the truly brave. Again he threw his arms round his sister,\nand sobbing, said--\n\n'Hear me, Adelina--hear me and be tranquil! I will promise to be guided\nby your excellent friends--I will do nothing that shall give pain to\nthem or to you!'\n\n'Thank God!' exclaimed Emmeline, 'that you at last hear reason! Remember\nthis promise is given to us all.'\n\n'It is,' answered Godolphin; 'but try to make poor Adelina sensible of\nit.' She no longer understood any thing; but with her eyes shut, and her\nhands clasped in each other, was at least quiet.\n\n'I cannot bear it!' continued Godolphin--'I must go for a few moments to\nrecover myself!' He then left the room, desiring Emmeline to comfort and\ncompose his sister, who soon afterwards asked hastily what was become of\nhim?\n\nEmmeline, pleased to find she had a clear recollection of his having\nbeen with her, now told her that he had most solemnly assured them he\nwould think no more of seeking Fitz-Edward on account of this unhappy\naffair. As she seemed still, in fearful apprehension, to doubt the\nreality of this promise, Godolphin, who was only in the next room with\nMrs. Stafford, returned, and assured her of his pity, his forbearance\nand his forgiveness.\n\nAfter some farther efforts on the part of Emmeline, and protestations on\nthat of Godolphin, tears, which had been long denied to Lady Adelina,\ncame to her relief. She wept, caressed her infant, and blessed and\nthanked her brother and her friends. When capable of recollection, she\nknew that towards those whom he had once pardoned, he was incapable of\nreproach or unkindness; and her mind, eased of the fears which had so\nlong harrassed it, seemed to be recovering it's tone. Still, however,\nthe sense of her own incurable unhappiness, her own irretrievable\nunworthiness, and the disgrace of having sullied the honour of her\nfamily, and given pain to such a brother, overwhelmed her with grief and\nconfusion; while her reason, as it at intervals returned, served only to\nshew her the abyss into which she had fallen: and she sometimes even\nregretted those hours of forgetfulness, when she possessed not the power\nof steady reflection, and when the sad reality was obliterated by wild\nand imaginary horrors.\n\n[Footnote 1: Without fear and without reproach.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nSome few days elapsed before there was any great alteration for the\nbetter in Lady Adelina. But the incessant attention of her friends, the\nsoothing pity of her brother, and the skill of her physician, slowly\nconquered the lurking fever which had so long hung about her; and her\nintellects, tho' still disordered at times, were more collected, and\ngave reason to hope that she would soon entirely recover.\n\nIn the mean time Captain Godolphin communicated to Mrs. Stafford the\nresolution he had taken about his sister. He said that she should\nrenounce for ever all claim on the Trelawny estate, except only the\nstipend settled on her as a consideration for the fortune she was to\nreceive at the death of the dowager Lady Westhaven, and which was only\nthree hundred a year; a sum which he thought made her but a paltry and\ninadequate compensation for having passed two years in the society of\nsuch a man as Trelawny.\n\nHe added, that he had a house in the Isle of Wight (almost all the\npatrimony his father had been able to give him,) where, as his ship was\nnow out of commission, he proposed residing himself; and whither he\nshould insist upon Lady Adelina's retiring, without any future attempt\nto see or correspond with Fitz-Edward.\n\nAs to the child, he asked if Mrs. Stafford would have the goodness to\nsee that it was taken care of at some cottage in her neighbourhood,\n'till he could adjust matters with the Trelawny family, and put an end\nto all those fears which might tempt them to enquire into it's birth;\nafter which he said he would take it to his own house, and call it a son\nof his own; a precaution that would throw an obscurity over the truth\nwhich would hardly ever be removed, when none were particularly\ninterested to remove it.\n\nThese designs he desired Mrs. Stafford to communicate to Lady Adelina;\nand as she was obliged to return home in two days, she took the earliest\nopportunity of doing so.\n\nTo the conditions her brother offered, Lady Adelina thought herself most\nhappy to consent. The little boy was immediately baptized by the name of\nWilliam Godolphin, and his unfortunate mother now began to flatter\nherself that her disastrous history might be concealed even from her\nelder brother, Lord Westhaven; of whose indignation and resentment she\nhad ever the most alarming apprehensions. But while the hope of\nescaping them by her brother William's generous compassion, gave to her\nheavy sorrows some alleviation, they were renewed with extreme\npoignancy, by the approaching separation from her inestimable friends.\nMrs. Stafford could no longer delay her return to her family; and\nEmmeline, who now saw Lady Adelina out of danger and in the protection\nof her brother, was desirous of accompanying her back to Woodfield.\n\nLady Adelina ineffectually tried to bear this early departure with some\ndegree of fortitude and resolution. Nor was it _her_ heart alone that\nfelt desolate and unhappy at it's approach--That of her brother, had\nreceived an impression from the mental and personal perfections of\nEmmeline, which being at first deep, had soon become indelible; and\nignorant of her engagement, he had indulged it till he found it no\nlonger possible for him to forbear making her the first object of his\nlife, and that the value of his existence depended wholly on her.\n\nEmmeline was yet quite unconscious of this: but Mrs. Stafford had seen\nit almost from the first moment of her seeing Godolphin. In their\nfrequent conversation, she observed that the very name of Emmeline had\nthe power of fascination; that he was never weary of hearing her\npraises; that whenever he thought himself unobserved, his eyes were in\npursuit of her; while fondly gazing on her face, he seemed to drink deep\ndraughts of intoxicating passion.\n\nMrs. Stafford, who knew what ardent and fatal love, such excellence of\nperson and understanding might produce in a heart susceptible of all\ntheir power, was alarmed for the happiness of this amiable man; and with\nregret saw him nourishing an affection which she thought must be\nentirely hopeless.\n\nThese apprehensions, every hour's observation encreased. Yet Mrs.\nStafford determined not to communicate them to Emmeline; but to put an\nend to the flattering delusion which led on Godolphin to indulge his\npassion, by telling him, as soon as possible, of the engagement Emmeline\nhad formed with Mr. Delamere.\n\nAccident soon furnished her with an opportunity. While they were all\nsitting together after dinner, a packet of letters was brought in, and\namong others which were forwarded to Mrs. Stafford from Woodfield, was\none for Emmeline.\n\nMrs. Stafford gave it to her, saying--'From France, by the post mark?'\n\nEmmeline replied that it was. She changed colour as she opened it.\n\n'From Mr. Delamere?' enquired Mrs. Stafford.\n\n'No,' answered she, 'it is from Lady Westhaven. Your brother and her\nLadyship are well,' continued she, addressing herself to Mr. Godolphin,\n'and are at Paris; where they propose staying 'till Lady Montreville and\nMiss Delamere join them as they come to England.'\n\n'And when are they expected?' said Godolphin.\n\n'In about a month,' replied Emmeline. 'But Lord and Lady Westhaven do\nnot propose to return 'till next spring--they only pass a few days all\ntogether at Paris.'\n\n'And where is Mr. Delamere wandering to?' significantly and smilingly\nasked Mrs. Stafford.\n\n'Lady Westhaven says only,' answered Emmeline, blushing and casting down\nher eyes, 'that he has left Lady Montreville, and is, they believe, gone\nto Geneva.'\n\n'However,' reassumed Mrs. Stafford, 'we shall undoubtedly see him in\nEngland in March.'\n\nEmmeline, in still greater embarrassment, answered two or three other\nquestions which Godolphin asked her about his brother, and soon after\nleft the room.\n\nGodolphin, who saw there was something relative to Delamere with which\nhe was unacquainted, had a confused idea immediately occur to him of his\nattachment: and the pain it gave him was so acute, that he wished at\nonce to know whether it was well founded.\n\n'Why does Mr. Delamere certainly return in March?' said he, addressing\nhimself to Mrs. Stafford, 'rather than with his mother?'\n\n'To fulfil his engagement,' gravely and coldly replied she.\n\n'Of what nature is it?' asked he.\n\nMrs. Stafford then related the history of Delamere's long and violent\npassion for Emmeline; and the reluctant consent he had wrung from Lord\nand Lady Montreville, together with the promise obtained from Miss\nMowbray.\n\nWhile Mrs. Stafford was making this recital, she saw, by the variations\nof Godolphin's countenance, that she had too truly guessed the state of\nhis heart. Expressive as his features were, it was not in his power to\nconceal what he felt in being convinced that he had irrecoverably fixed\nhis affections on a woman who was the destined wife of another: and\nawaking from the soft visions which Hope had offered, to certain\ndespondence, he found himself too cruelly hurt to be able to continue\nthe conversation; and after a few faint efforts, which only betrayed his\ninternal anguish, he hurried away.\n\nSuch, however, was the opinion Mrs. Stafford conceived of his honour and\nhis understanding, that she had no apprehension that he would attempt\nimparting to the heart of Emmeline any portion of that pain with which\nhis own was penetrated; and she hoped that absence and reflection,\ntogether with the conviction of it's being hopeless, would conquer this\ninfant passion before it could gather strength wholly to ruin his\nrepose.\n\nShe was glad that their departure was so near; and hastened it as much\nas possible. The short interval was passed in mournful silence on the\npart of Godolphin--on that of Lady Adelina, in tears and regret; while\nEmmeline, who was herself sensible of great pain in the approaching\nparting, struggled to appear chearful; and Mrs. Stafford attempted, tho'\nwithout much success, to reconcile them all to a separation which was\nbecome as necessary as it was inevitable.\n\nAt length the hired coach in which they were to return to Woodfield was\nat the door.\n\nLady Adelina, unable to speak to either of them, brought her little boy\nin her arms, and passionately kissing him, gave him into those of\nEmmeline. Then taking a hand of each of her friends, she pressed them to\nher throbbing heart, and hastened to conceal the violence of her sorrow\nin her own room.\n\nGodolphin approached to take leave. He kissed the hand of Mrs. Stafford,\nand inarticulately expressed his thanks for her goodness to his sister.\n\n'I know,' continued he, 'I need not recommend to you this poor infant:\nthe same generosity which prompted you to save his mother, will\neffectually plead for him, and secure for him your protection 'till I\ncan take him to that of his own family. And you, Miss Mowbray,' said he,\nturning to Emmeline and taking her hand--'most amiable, loveliest of\nhuman creatures! where shall I find words to thank you as I ought?'\n\nHis emotion was too great for utterance. Emmeline felt it but too\nsensibly; and hastening into the coach to hide how much she was herself\naffected, she could only say--\n\n'All happiness attend you, Sir! Remind Lady Adelina of my hopes of soon\nhearing from her.'\n\nMrs. Stafford being then seated, and the servant who had been hired to\nattend the infant following her, the coach drove from the door.\nGodolphin pursued it with his eyes to the end of the street; and then,\nas if deprived of all that made life desirable, he gave himself up to\nlanguor and despondence, afraid of examining his own heart, least his\nreason should condemn an inclination, which, however hopeless, he could\nnot resolve to conquer.\n\nBut while he found charms in the indulgence of his unhappy love, he\ndetermined never to disturb the peace of it's object. But rather to\nsuffer in silence, than to give pain to a heart so generous and sensible\nas her's, merely for the melancholy pleasure of knowing that she pitied\nhim.\n\nAs soon as Lady Adelina could bear the journey, they departed together\nto his house in the Isle of Wight; where he left her, and went in search\nof Mrs. Bancraft, the sister of Trelawny, of whom he enquired where\nTrelawny himself might be found.\n\nThis woman, apprehensive that he meditated a reconciliation between her\nbrother and his wife, which it was so much her interest to prevent,\nrefused for some time to give him the information he desired. Having\nhowever at length convinced her that he had no wish to renew a union\nwhich had been productive only of misery to his sister, she told him\nthat Mr. Trelawny was returned to England, and lived at a house hired in\nthe name of her husband, a few miles from London.\n\nThere Godolphin sought him; and found the unhappy man sunk into a state\nof perpetual and unconscious intoxication; in which Bancraft, the\nhusband of his sister, encouraged him, foreseeing that it must soon end\nin his son's being possessed of an income, to which the meanness of his\nown origin, and former condition, made him look forward with anxious\navidity.\n\nIt was difficult to make Trelawny, sinking into idiotism, comprehend\neither who Godolphin was, or the purport of his business. But Bancraft,\nmore alive to his own interest, presently understood, that on condition\nof his entering into bonds of separation, Lady Adelina would relinquish\nthe greater part of her claim on the Trelawny estate; and he undertook\nto have the deeds signed as soon as they could be drawn up. In a few\ndays therefore Godolphin saw Trelawny's part of them compleated; and\nreturned to Lady Adelina, satisfied in having released her from an\nengagement, which, since he had seen Trelawny, had rendered her in his\neyes an object of tenderer pity; and in having acquitted himself\naccording to his strict sense of honour, by causing her to relinquish\nall the advantages Trelawny's fortune offered, except those to which she\nhad an absolute right.\n\nThis affair being adjusted, he again resigned himself to the mournful\nbut pleasing contemplations which had occupied him ever since he had\nheard of Emmeline's engagement. While Lady Adelina, whose intellects\nwere now restored, but who was lost in profound melancholy, saw too\nevidently the state of her brother's heart; and could not but lament\nthat his tenderness for her had been the means of involving him in a\npassion, which the great merit of it's object, and his own sensibility,\nconvinced her must be incurable.\n\nThe letters of Emmeline were the only consolation she was capable of\nreceiving. They gave her favourable accounts of her child, and of the\ncontinued affection of her inestimable friends. Whenever one of these\nletters was brought, Godolphin eagerly watched her while she was reading\nit; and then, faultering and impatient, asked if all were well; and if\nMr. Delamere was yet returned? She sometimes gave him the letters to\nperuse; after which he generally fell into long absence, broken only by\ndeep drawn and involuntary sighs--symptoms which Lady Adelina knew too\nwell to doubt of the cause.\n\nIn the mean time Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline visited every day their\ninnocent charge, who passed for the child of one of Emmeline's friends\ngone to the West Indies. Emmeline insensibly grew so fond of him, that\nshe was uneasy if any accident prevented her daily visit; and her friend\nsometimes laughingly reproached her with the robbery little William\ncommitted on her time.\n\nWhen they were alone, their conversation frequently turned on Lady\nAdelina and her brother. The subject, tho' melancholy, was ever a\nfavourite with them both; and perhaps the more so because it led them to\nmournful reflections--for Mrs. Stafford was unhappy, and Emmeline was\nnot gay; nor were her spirits greatly heightened by finding that in\nspite of herself she thought as much of the brother as the sister, and\nwith a degree of softness and complacency which could not be favourable\nto her happiness.\n\nWhen she first discovered in Godolphin those admirable qualities of\nheart and understanding which he so eminently possessed, she asked\nherself whether she might indulge the admiration they excited without\nprejudice to him whom she considered as her husband? And she fancied\nthat she might safely give him that esteem which his tenderness to his\nunhappy sister, the softness of his manners, the elegance of his mind,\nand the generosity of his heart, could hardly fail of extorting from the\nmost indifferent observer.\n\nBut insensibly his idea obtruded itself more frequently on her\nimagination; and she determined to attempt to forget him, and no longer\nto allow any partiality to rob Delamere of that pure and sincere\nattachment with which he would expect her to meet him at the altar. It\nwas now long since she had heard from him; but she accounted for it by\nsupposing that he was rambling about, and she knew that letters were\nfrequently lost.\n\nIt was at this time something more than two years since they had first\nmet at Mowbray Castle, and in a few weeks Delamere would complete his\ntwenty-first year--a period to which Lord Montreville had long looked\nforward with anxious solicitude. And now he could not but think with\nbitterness that his son would not be present to animate the joy of his\ndependants at this period; but was kept in another country, in the vain\nhope of extinguishing a passion which could not be indulged without\nrendering abortive all the pains his Lordship had taken to restore his\nfamily to the eminent rank it had formerly borne in his country.\n\nTo Sir Richard Crofts, his sons had communicated the success of those\nplans, by which they had sown, in the irritable mind of Delamere,\njealousy and mistrust of Emmeline; and he failed not to animate and\nencourage their endeavours, while he used his power over the mind of\nLord Montreville to limit the bounty and lessen the affection his\nLordship was disposed to shew her as the daughter of his brother.\n\nShe received regularly her quarterly payment, but she received no more;\nand instead of hearing, on those occasions, from Lord Montreville\nhimself, she had twice only a methodical letter from Maddox, the London\nsteward.\n\nThis might, however, be merely accidental; and Emmeline was far from\nsupposing that her uncle was estranged from her; nor could she guess\nthat the malice of Mrs. Ashwood, and the artifices of the Crofts', had\noccasioned that estrangement.\n\nLord Montreville rather connived at than participated in their\nungenerous proceedings; and as if fearful of trusting his own ideas of\nintegrity with a plan which so evidently militated against them, he was\ndetermined to take advantage of their endeavours, without enquiring too\nminutely into their justice or candour. Sir Richard had assured him that\nMr. Delamere was in a great measure weaned from his attachment; and that\nMr. Crofts was almost sure, that if their meeting could be prevented for\na few months longer, there would be nothing more to fear from this long\nand unfortunate prepossession.\n\nCrofts himself, who had at length torn himself from his bride to pave\nthe way for his being received by her family as her husband, soon\nappeared, and confirmed all this. He told Lord Montreville that Delamere\nhad conceived suspicions of Emmeline's conduct, (tho' he knew not from\nwhat cause) that had at first excited the most uneasy jealousy, but\nwhich had at length subsided with his love; that he had regained his\nspirits; and, when he left his mother and sister, seemed resolved to\nmake a vigorous effort to expel from his mind a passion he was ashamed\nof having so long indulged.\n\nIn saying all this, Crofts rather attended to what his Lordship wished\nto hear, than to what was really the truth. He knew that a meeting\nbetween Delamere and Emmeline would probably at once explain all the\nunworthy artifices which had been used to divide them, and render those\nartifices abortive. He therefore told Lord Montreville, that to prevent\nall probability of a relapse, it would be advisable to remove Emmeline\nto some place where Delamere could not meet her: and his Lordship,\nforgetting at once all the obligations he owed her, thought only of\nfollowing this advice.\n\nEmbarrassed, however, himself with public business, he was unable to\ngive to these domestic politics all the attention which they demanded.\nHe threw himself more than ever into the power of the Crofts', to whose\npolicy he left it to contrive the means, between the months of November\nand March, of raising an invincible barrier between his son and his\nniece.\n\nTho' Delamere's being of age encreased the difficulties of this\nundertaking, Crofts having no scruples about the methods he was to\npursue, had no doubt of accomplishing his end: and to stimulate his\nendeavours, he needed only the particular advantages which would accrue\nto himself from the pardon and reception which he hoped to obtain from\nLord Montreville and his family.\n\nEvery engine therefore that ambition, avarice, malice and cunning could\nemploy, was now put in motion against the character and the peace of the\nunprotected and unsuspicious Emmeline.\n\nIn conscious innocence and unsullied purity, she dreamed not that she\nhad an enemy on earth; for of Mrs. Ashwood, now Mrs. James Crofts, she\nonly remembered that she had once been obliged to her. The little,\nmalicious envy which had given her some pain at the time it was shewn,\nshe now no longer recollected; and tho' she always continued to dislike\nJames Crofts, yet his impertinence she had forgiven, and had written in\nthe usual form to congratulate them both on their marriage.\n\nOf Delamere, she heard nothing; but imputing his silence to his frequent\nchange of place, she conceived no anger against him on that account; and\nstill felt herself bound to keep from her mind, as much as possible, the\nintrusive image of Godolphin.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nWhatever resolution Emmeline might form to drive from her heart those\ndangerous partialities which would be fatal to her repose, she found it\nimpossible to be accomplished while Lady Adelina's frequent letters\nspoke only of the generous tenderness and excellent qualities of her\nbrother. Of what else, indeed, could she speak, in a solitude where his\ngoodness made all her consolation and his conversation all her pleasure?\nwhere he dedicated to her all his time, and thought of procuring for her\nevery alleviation to her retirement which books and domestic amusements\nafforded? while he taught her still to respect herself; and by his\nunwearied friendship convincing her that she had still much to lose,\nmade her life receive in her own eyes a value it would otherwise have\nlost; and prevented her relapsing into that unhappy state of\nself-condemnation which makes the sufferer careless of the future. He\nthought, that situated as she was, solitude was her only choice; but to\nrender it as happy as her circumstances allowed, was his continual care:\nand tho' oppressive sorrow still lay heavy on her heart; tho' it still\nached with tenderness and regret towards an object whom she had sworn to\nthink of, to speak of no more; her gratitude and affection towards her\nbrother were as lively, as if its acute feelings had never felt the\nbenumbing hand of despair.\n\nIn the total sequestration from the world in which she lived, she had no\nother topic to dwell upon than her brother, and she gave it all its\nforce. Perfectly acquainted, however, with Emmeline's engagements, she\nnever ventured to mention the passion which she was too well assured\nGodolphin felt; but she still, almost unknown to herself, cherished a\nlurking hope that her connection with Delamere might be dissolved, and\nthat her lovely friend was destined to bless her beloved brother.\n\nThis distant hope was warm enough to animate her pen in his praise; and\nEmmeline, tho' every letter she received made on her mind a deeper\nimpression of the merit of Godolphin, yet found such painful pleasure in\nreading them, that she was unhappy if at the usual periods they did not\nregularly arrive.\n\nShe tried to persuade herself, that the satisfaction she felt in reading\nthese letters arose purely from the delight natural to every uncorrupted\nmind in contemplating a character honourable to human nature. But\naccustomed to examine narrowly her own heart, she could not long impose\nupon herself; and notwithstanding all her endeavours to stifle it, she\nstill found the idea of Godolphin mixing itself with all her thoughts,\nand embittering the prospect of her certain marriage with Delamere.\n\nIn the answers Emmeline gave her friend, she related whatever she\nthought likely to amuse the fair recluse; gave a regular account of her\nlittle charge; but avoided punctiliously the least mention of\nFitz-Edward.\n\nFitz-Edward had received from Mrs. Stafford an account of all that had\npassed at Bath, except the pains which had been taken to prevent any\nmeeting between him and Godolphin. But notwithstanding her cautious\nsilence on that head, Fitz-Edward, who knew Godolphin well, could hardly\nbe persuaded not to insist on his taking his chance of depriving him of\na life which he said he had deserved to lose, and could little brook\nbeing supposed to hold on courtesy. Nothing but his consideration for\nthe unhappy Lady Adelina prevented his pursuing the sanguinary projects\nthat agitated his mind. To her peace he owed it to conquer them; and\nwhile he was yet struggling against that sense of honour which impelled\nhim to give Godolphin imaginary reparation, by allowing him an\nopportunity of putting an end to _his_ existence or losing his own, his\nbrother, Lord Clancarryl, wrote to desire his attendance in Ireland on\nsome family business of importance; a summons, which after some\nhesitation, Mrs. Stafford and Miss Mowbray prevailed with him to obey.\n\nBefore he went, his eager and affecting entreaties prevailed on Mrs.\nStafford to let him see his son, whom he embraced with an ardour of\naffection of which the fair friends believed so gay and fashionable a\nman incapable.\n\nThe errors of Fitz-Edward, however, were not those of the heart. Among\nthe dissipation of fashion and the indulgences of libertinism, his heart\nwas still sensible, and his integrity retrievable. He felt, therefore,\nwith great keenness, the injury he had done Lady Adelina; and desirous\nof making all the reparation he could to the infant, he again placed in\nthe hands of Emmeline, a will by which he made it his heir, and\nrecommended it to the protection of Godolphin, whom he besought to\nconsider as his nephew, the son of a man whom he had once loved, and who\nhad dearly paid for having forfeited all claim to his friendship. When\nhe was departed, nothing seemed likely to interrupt the tranquillity of\nEmmeline but her encreasing apprehensions for Mrs. Stafford and her\nchildren. The derangement of Stafford's affairs, and his wife's\nunavailing efforts to ward off the ruin which he seemed obstinately bent\non incurring, were every day more visible: while his capricious and\nunreasonable temper, and a strange opinion of his own sagacity, which\nwould never allow him to own himself in the wrong, made him seek to load\nhis wife with the blame of those misfortunes which he had voluntarily\nsought, and now as obdurately refused to avoid while it was yet in his\npower.\n\nMrs. Stafford, who saw too plainly that the destruction of their fortune\nwhich she had so long dreaded was now with hasty strides advancing, yet\nendeavoured to convince him of his infatuation; but he still improved\nhis house and garden, still schemed away all the money he could raise or\ngain credit for, and still repaid with rudeness and insult her anxious\nsolicitude to save him.\n\nIn Emmeline, she ever found pity and tenderness; but pity and tenderness\nwas all she had to bestow. The affairs of Stafford required interest and\nmoney; and Emmeline could command neither. Lord Montreville now took no\nother notice of her, than to remit her quarterly stipend by the hands of\nhis steward; and tho' he had promised to double it, that promise yet\nremained unfulfilled.\n\nIt was at this time near the end of November, and the mornings were cold\nand gloomy: but Emmeline, however delicate in her frame, had a\nconstitution which had not, by early and false indulgences, been\nunfitted for the duties of life; and to personal inconvenience she was\nalways indifferent when the service of those she loved engaged her to\nbrave fatigue or cold. She therefore still continued her morning visit\nto Woodbury Forest, where she generally past an hour with little\nWilliam; and in his improving features and interesting smiles, loved to\ntrace his resemblance to his mother. Lady Adelina was very like her\nbrother; and the little boy was not the less tenderly caressed for the\nsimilitude she saw to them both.\n\nThe appearance of rain had one morning detained her at home later than\nusual. She went, however, about eleven o'clock; and was busied in\nplaying with the infant, who began now to know her, and was therefore\nmore attractive, when, while she yet held him in her arms, she heard the\nwoman of the house, who was in the outward room, suddenly\nexclaim--'Indeed Sir you cannot go in--pray--I beg your honour!' There\nwas hardly time for Emmeline to feel surprise at this bustle, before the\ndoor opened, and Delamere stood before her! In his countenance was an\nexpression compounded of rage, fierceness and despair, which extorted\nfrom Emmeline an involuntary shriek! Unable to arise, she remained\nmotionless in her chair, clasping the baby to her bosom: Delamere seemed\ntrying to stifle his anger in contempt; vengeance, disdain, and pride,\nwere struggling for superiority: while with his eyes sternly turned upon\nEmmeline, and smiling indignantly, he exclaimed--'Till I _saw_ this----'\ninarticulately and tremulously he spoke--'till I _saw_ this, all the\nevidence they brought me was insufficient to cure my blind attachment.\nBut now--oh! infamy--madness--damnation! It _is_ then possible--It _is_\nthen true! But what is it to me? Torn--torn for ever from this outraged\nheart--never, never shall this sight blast me again!--But what?'\ncontinued he, speaking with more quickness, 'what? for Fitz-Edward! for\nthe infamous plunderer of his friend's happiness! However, Madam, on you\nI intrude no longer. Oh! lost--lost--wretched!'--He could not go on; but\nin the speechless agony of contending passions he leaned his head\nagainst the frame of the door near which he stood, and gazed wildly on\nEmmeline; who, pale as death, and trembling like a leaf, still sat\nbefore him unable to recall her scattered spirits.\n\nHe waited a moment, gasping for breath, and as if he had still some\nfeeble expectation of hearing her speak. But the child which she held in\nher arms was like a basilisk to his sight, and made in his opinion all\nvindication impossible. Again conviction appeared to drive him to\ndesperation; and looking in a frantic manner round the room, as if\nentirely bereft of reason, he dashed his hands furiously against his\nhead, and running, or rather flying out of the house, he immediately\ndisappeared.\n\nIn terror and astonishment, Emmeline remained immovable and speechless.\nShe almost doubted whether this was any other than a fearful dream,\n'till the woman of the house, and the maid who attended on the child,\nran into the room frightened--'Lord! Madam,' cried the woman, 'what is\nthe matter with the young gentleman?'\n\n'I know not,' answered Emmeline, faintly--'I know not! Where is he now?'\n\n'He's run away into the wood again like any mad,' answered the woman.\n\n'And from whence,' enquired Emmeline, 'did he come?'\n\n'Why, Miss,' said she, 'I was a going out cross our garden to hang out\nmy cloaths; so up a comes to the hedge side, an a says--Good woman, pray\nbe'nt here a lady here as comes from Woodfield? one Miss Mowbray?--I\nthought how he looked oddish as 'twere about the eyes; but howsever\nthinking no harm, I says yes. So he runs up to the door, and I called to\nun, to say as I'd come in and let you know; but before I could get thro'\nthe wicket, whisk he was in the kitchen; then I tried agin to stop un,\nbut I were as good try to stop the wind.'\n\nThe agitation and uneasiness of Emmeline encreased rather than subsided.\nShe looked so pale, and with so much difficulty drew her breath, that\nthe women were alarmed least she should faint: and one of them persuaded\nher to swallow something, while the other ran out to see if the person\nwho had so terrified her was yet in sight. But no traces of him were\nvisible: and after a few moments, Emmeline recalling her presence of\nmind, and feeling proudly conscious of her own innocence and integrity,\nrecovered in some degree her spirits and resolution.\n\nThat Delamere should be in England did not greatly astonish tho' it\ngrieved her; but that he should have conceived such strange suspicions\nof her and Fitz-Edward, equally surprised and distressed her; since,\nhad she an opportunity of undeceiving him, which he did not seem willing\nto allow her, she could not relate the truth but by betraying the\nconfidence of her unfortunate friend, and embittering that life she had\nincurred such hazards to preserve. As soon as she had apparently\nrecovered from the shock of this abrupt intrusion, she was desirous of\nreturning to Woodfield; anxious to know if Delamere had been there, or\nby what means he had been enabled to find her at the cottage in the\nforest. The women, who fancied the gentleman they had seen was a lunatic\nwho might lay in wait to hurt her on her way home, would not suffer her\nto set out 'till they had called a woodcutter from the forest to\naccompany her. Then, slowly and with difficulty, she returned home;\nwhere she heard from Mrs. Stafford that Delamere had neither been there\nor sent thither. This information encreased her wonder and her disquiet.\nShe related to Mrs. Stafford the distressing interview of the morning;\nwho, having seen frequent instances of those excesses of which Delamere\nwas capable, heard the relation with concern and apprehension.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nSome days were passed by Emmeline in painful conjectures on what\nmeasures Delamere would take, and in uncertainty what she ought to do\nherself. Sometimes she thought of writing to Lord Montreville: but\nagainst that Mrs. Stafford remonstrated; representing, that as she was\nundoubtedly the injured person, in having been insulted by suspicions so\nunworthy, she should leave it wholly to Delamere to discover and recant\nhis error; which, if he refused on cooler reflection to do, she would be\nfortunate in escaping from an engagement with a man who had so little\ncommand of his own temper, so little reliance on her principles, as to\nbe driven on a mere suspicion into rudeness and insult.\n\nGreatly mortified at finding it possible for Delamere to think so\ninjuriously of her, and depressed by a thousand uneasy apprehensions,\nshe yielded implicitly to the counsel of her friend. But of her counsel\nand consolation she was now on the point of being deprived: Stafford,\nwho had been some time in London, sent an express to fetch his wife\nthither a few days after the interview between Emmeline and Delamere.\nHis affairs were now growing desperate: James Crofts demanded immediate\npayment of a sum of money belonging to his wife, that was left her by\nher father, and which she had 'till now suffered to remain in the hands\nof her brother. Stafford had made no provision to pay it: his boundless\nprofusion had dissipated all the ready money he could command; and this\nclaim of his sister's, which James Crofts seemed determined to urge,\nwould he knew be the signal for every other creditor to beset him with\ndemands he had no means of discharging.\n\nTho' Mrs. Stafford had long tho' vainly implored him to stop in his wild\ncareer, and had represented to him all the evils which were now about to\novertake him, she could not see their near approach without an attempt\nagain to rescue him. And he was accustomed in every difficulty to have\nrecourse to her; tho' while he felt none, he scorned and even resented\nher efforts to keep them at a distance. He now fancied that her\napplication might prevail on James Crofts to drop a suit he had\ncommenced against him: she hastily therefore set out for London; leaving\nto Emmeline the care of her children; who promised, by the utmost\nattention to them, to obviate part of the inconvenience of such a\njourney.\n\nIt was unhappily, however, not only inconvenient but fruitless. Mr. and\nMrs. James Crofts were inexorable. The suit was tried; Stafford was\ncast; and nothing remained for him but either to pay the money or to be\nexposed to the hazard of losing his property and his liberty. His\nconduct had so much injured his credit, that to borrow, it was\nimpossible. Mrs. Stafford attempted therefore to divest herself of part\nof her own fortune to assist him with the money: but her trustees were\nnot to be moved; and nothing but despair seemed darkening round the head\nof the unfortunate Stafford.\n\nMrs. Stafford saw too evidently that to be in the power of James Crofts,\nwas to trust to avarice, meanness and malignity; and she trembled to\nreflect that her husband was now wholly at his mercy. The additional\nmotives he had to use that power rigorously she knew not: she was\nignorant that the business had so eagerly been pushed to a crisis, not\nmerely by the avidity of James Crofts to possess the money, but also by\nthe directions of Sir Richard, who hoped by this means to drive the\nfamily with whom Emmeline resided to another country; where Delamere\nmight find access to her so difficult, that he might never have an\nopportunity of explaining the cause of his estrangement, or of hearing\nher vindication.\n\nIt was now that Mrs. Stafford remembered the frequent offers of service\nwhich she had repeatedly received from Lord Montreville; and to him she\ndetermined to apply. She hoped that he might be induced to influence the\nCrofts' family to give Mr. Stafford time, and to desist from the\nviolence and precipitation with which they pursued him. She even fancied\nthat his Lordship would be glad of an opportunity so easily to realize\nthose offers he had so liberally made; and full of these expectations,\nshe prepared to become a solicitress for favours to a statesman. She\nfelt humbled and mortified at the cruel necessity that compelled her to\nit; but her children's interest conquering her reluctance, she addressed\na letter to Lord Montreville, and received a very polite answer, in\nwhich he desired the honour of seeing her at two o'clock the following\nday; an hour, when he said he should be entirely disengaged. She might\nas well, however, have attended at his levee; for tho' punctual to the\nhour when he was to be disengaged, she found two rooms adjoining to that\nwhere his Lordship was, occupied by a variety of figures; some of whose\nfaces, were faces of negociation and equality, but more, whose\nexpression of fearful suspence marked them for those of petitioners and\ndependants. Those of the former description were separately called to an\naudience; and each, after a longer or shorter stay, retired; while Mrs.\nStafford, tho' with an heart but ill at ease for observation, could not\nhelp fancying she discerned in their looks the success of their\nrespective treaties.\n\nAs soon as these gentlemen were all departed, Mrs. Stafford, who had\nalready waited almost three hours, was introduced into the study; where,\nwith many gracious bows and smiling apologies, Lord Montreville received\nher.\n\nSir Richard Crofts had that morning warmly represented to his Lordship\nthe necessity of the Staffords' going abroad and taking Emmeline with\nthem. Lord Montreville knew that Delamere was returned, and was\nembroiled with Emmeline; he was therefore eager enough to follow advice\nwhich appeared so necessary, and to promote any plan which might prevent\na renewal of the attachment. He enquired not into the cause of this\nestrangement, satisfied with it's effect; and had secretly determined\nto give Mrs. Stafford no assistance in the endeavours she was using to\nkeep her family from dispersion and distress.\n\nBut statesman as he was, he could not entirely forget that he _once_\nfelt as other men; and he could not hear, without some emotion, the\nmelancholy description that Mrs. Stafford gave of the impending ruin of\nher family and all it's fearful consequences: which she did with so much\nclear simplicity, yet with so much proper dignity, that he found his\nresolution shaken; and recollecting _that he had a conscience_, was\nabout to ask it by what right he assumed the power of rendering an\ninnocent family wandering exiles, merely to save himself from a supposed\npossible inconvenience.\n\nBut while every lingering principle of goodness and generosity was\nrising in the bosom of his Lordship to assist the suit of Mrs. Stafford,\na servant entered hastily and announced the Duke of N----. His Grace of\ncourse waited not in the anti-room, but was immediately introduced.\n\nLord Montreville then civilly apologized to Mrs. Stafford for being\nunable to conclude the business; adding, that if she would see Sir\nRichard Crofts the next day, he would take care it should be settled to\nher satisfaction. She withdrew with a heavy heart; and feeling infinite\nreluctance in the proposed application to Sir Richard Crofts, she\nemployed the whole afternoon in attempting to move, in favour of her\nhusband, some of those friends who had formerly professed the most\nunbounded and disinterested friendship for him and his family.\n\nOf many of these, the doors were shut against her; others affected the\nutmost concern, and lamented that their little power and limited\nfortunes did not allow them to assist in repairing the misfortunes they\ndeplored: some told her how long they had foreseen Mr. Stafford's\nembarrassments, and how destructive building and scheming were to a\nmoderate fortune; while others made vague proffers of inadequate\nservices, which on farther conversation she found they never intended to\nperform if unluckily she had accepted their offers. In all, she saw too\nplainly that they looked on Mr. Stafford's affairs as desperate; and in\ntheir coldness and studied civility, already felt all the misery and\nmortification of reduced circumstances.\n\nWith encreased anguish, she was now compelled to go, on the following\nday, to Sir Richard Crofts; whom she knew only from Emmeline's\ndescription.\n\nHe also, in imitation of his patron, had his anti-chamber filled with\nsoliciting faces. She waited not quite so long, indeed, for an audience,\nbut with infinitely less patience. At length, however, she was shewn\ninto the apartment where Sir Richard transacted business.\n\nBloated prosperity was in his figure, supercilious scorn in his eyes: he\nrose half off his seat, and slightly inclined his head on her entrance.\n\n'Madam, your servant--please to sit down.'\n\n'I waited on you, Sir Richard, to--'\n\n'I beg your pardon, Madam. But as I am perfectly acquainted, and\ninformed, and aware of the business, there is no occasion or necessity\nto give you the trouble to repeat, and dwell upon, and explain it. It is\nnot, I find, convenient, or suitable, or commodious, for Mr. Stafford to\npay to my son James, who has married his (Mr. Stafford's) sister, that\npart, and proportion, and residue, of her fortune, which her father at\nhis death gave, bequeathed, and left to her.'\n\n'It is not only inconvenient, Sir,' answered Mrs. Stafford, 'but\nimpossible, I fear, for him to do it immediately; and this is what I\nwished to speak to you upon.'\n\n'I am aware, and informed, and apprized, Madam, of what you would say. I\nam sorry it is as you say so inconvenient, and impracticable, and\nimpossible. However, Madam, my way in these cases is to go very plainly,\nand straitly, and directly to the point; therefore I will chalk out, and\ndescribe, and point out to you a line of conduct, which if you chuse to\nfollow, and adopt, and pursue, it appears to me that all may be\nadjusted, settled, and put to rights.'\n\n'You will oblige me, Sir Richard, by doing so.'\n\n'Well then, it is this--As it appears, and is evident, and visible, that\nyou have not the money in question, you must immediately sell, and\ndispose of, and make into money, your house and effects in Dorsetshire,\nand after paying, and satisfying, and discharging the debt to my son\nJames, you must (as I understand your husband is besides deeply in\ndebt,) withdraw, retire, and remove to France, or to Normandy, or\nSwitzerland, or some cheap country, 'till your affairs come round, and\nare retrieved, and accommodated and adjusted.'\n\n'This we might have done, Sir Richard, without troubling you with the\npresent application.'\n\n'No, Madam, you might _not_. I assure you I have talked, and reasoned,\nand argued some time with Mr. James Crofts, before I could induce, and\nprevail upon, and dispose him to wait, and remain, and continue unpaid,\nuntil this arrangement and disposition could take place. He wants the\nmoney, Madam, for a particular purpose; and tho' from my heart I grieve,\nand lament, and deplore the necessity of the measure, I do assure you,\nMadam, nothing else will give you any chance of winding up, compleating,\nand terminating the business before us. You will therefore, Madam,\nthink, and consider, and reflect on it's necessity, and give your final\nanswer to my son James, who will wait for it only 'till to-morrow\nmorning.'\n\nHe then rang his bell; and saying he had an appointment with Lord\nMontreville, who must already have waited for him, he made a cold bow\nand hastened out of the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nMrs. Stafford now saw that nothing remained but to follow her husband to\na prison, or prevail on him to go to the Continent while she attempted\nanew to settle his affairs.\n\nObstinate even in despair, she had the utmost difficulty to convince him\nof the necessity of this measure; and would never, perhaps, have done\nit, if the more persuasive argument of a writ, taken out by James\nCrofts, had not driven him to embrace it rather than go into\nconfinement.\n\nMrs. Stafford with difficulty procured money to furnish him for his\njourney, and saw him depart for Dover; while she herself returned to\nEmmeline, who had passed the three weeks of her absence in great\nuneasiness. No news had been received of Delamere; and she now believed,\nthat of the promise he had forced from her he meant not to avail\nhimself; yet did not relinquish it; but in proud and sullen resentment,\ndisdained even to enquire whether he had justly harboured anger against\nher. She wished to have withdrawn a promise she could no longer think of\nwithout pain and regret; but she found Mrs. Stafford so unhappy, that\nshe could not resolve to oppress her by complaints; and after some\nstruggles with herself, determined to let the matter take it's course.\n\nWillingly, however, she consented to accompany her friend to France;\nwhere Mrs. Stafford, at her husband's request, now determined to go with\nher family. She had found an opulent tradesman in a neighbouring town,\nwho engaged, on receiving a mortgage on the estate, and ten per cent.\ninterest, (which he so managed as to evade the appearance of usury,) to\nlet her have the money to pay Mr. Crofts, and a farther sum for the\nsupport of her family: and having got a tenant for the house, and\nsatisfied as many of the clamorous creditors as she could, she prepared,\nwith a heavy heart, to quit her abode, with Emmeline and her infant\nfamily.\n\nAs it was necessary that little William should be sent to the Isle of\nWight before their departure, Emmeline wrote to fix a day at the\ndistance of a month, on which she desired Lady Adelina to send some\ncareful person for him. But ten days before the expiration of that\nperiod, letters came from Mr. Stafford, in which he directed his wife,\nwho intended to embark at Brighthelmstone and land at Dieppe, to change\nher route, and sail from Southampton to Havre. He also desired her to\nhasten her journey: and as every thing was now put on the best footing\nthe time would allow, Mrs. Stafford immediately complied; and with her\nown unfortunate family, Emmeline, and little William, (whom they now\nmeant to carry themselves to Lady Adelina) they left Woodfield.\n\nThe pain of quitting, probably for ever, a favourite abode, which she\nfeared would at length be torn from her children by the rapacity of the\nlaw, and the fatigue of travelling with infant children, under such\ncircumstances, almost overcame the resolution and spirits of Mrs.\nStafford. Emmeline, ever reasonable, gentle, and consoling, was her\nprincipal support; and on the evening of the second day they arrived at\nSouthampton.\n\nWhile Emmeline almost forgot in her attention to her friend her own\nuncertain and unpleasant state, Delamere remained in Norfolk, where he\nhad hid himself from the enquiries of his father, and from the\nimportunities of his mother, who was now, with her eldest daughter,\nsettled again in Berkley Square. Here he nourished inveterate resentment\nagainst Fitz-Edward: and finding it impossible to forget Emmeline, he\ncontinued to think of her as much as ever, but with indignation,\njealousy and rage.\n\nHe had, immediately on receiving, as he believed, a confirmation of all\nthose suspicions with which the Crofts' had so artfully inspired him,\nresolved to demand satisfaction of Fitz-Edward; and hearing on enquiry\nthat he was in Ireland, but his return immediately expected, he waited\nwith eager and restless uneasiness till the person whom he had\ncommissioned to inform him of his return should send notice that he was\nagain in London.\n\nWeek after week, however, passed away. He still heard, that tho'\nexpected hourly, Fitz-Edward arrived not. Time, far from softening the\nasperity with which his thoughts dwelt on this supposed rival, seemed\nonly to irritate and inflame his resentment; and ingenious in tormenting\nhimself, he now added new anguish to that which corroded his heart, by\nsupposing that Emmeline, aware of the danger which threatened her lover\nfrom the vengeance of his injured friend, had written to him to prevent\nhis return. This idea was confirmed, when the agent whom he employed to\nwatch the return of Fitz-Edward at length informed him that he had\nobtained leave of absence from his regiment, now in England, and was to\npass the remainder of the winter with Lord and Lady Clancarryl.\n\nThe fury of his passions seemed to be suspended, while with gloomy\nsatisfaction he looked forward to a speedy retribution: but now, when no\nimmediate prospect offered of meeting the author of his calamities, they\ntormented him with new violence. Emmeline and Fitz-Edward haunted his\ndreams; Emmeline and Fitz-Edward were ever present to his imagination;\nhe figured to himself his happy rival possessed of the tenderness and\nattachment of that gentle and sensible heart. The anguish these images\ninflicted affected his health; and while every day, as it passed,\nbrought nothing to alleviate his despair, he became more and more\nconvinced that the happiness of his life was blasted for ever; and\ngrowing impatient of life itself, determined to go to Ireland and insist\non an opportunity of losing it, or of taking that of the man who had\nmade it an insupportable burthen.\n\nHe set out therefore, attended only by Millefleur, and gave Lord\nMontreville no notice of his intention 'till he reached Holyhead; from\nthence he wrote to his Lordship to say that he had received an\ninvitation to visit some friends at Dublin, and that he should continue\nabout a month in Ireland. His pride prompted him to do this; least his\nfather, on hearing of his absence, should suppose that he was weak\nenough to seek a reconciliation with Emmeline, whose name he now never\nmentioned, being persuaded that his Lordship knew how ill she had repaid\nan affection, which, tho' he could not divest himself of, he was now\nashamed to acknowledge.\n\nLord Montreville, happy to find he had really quitted her, was extremely\nglad of this seasonable journey; which, as the Crofts' assured him\nEmmeline was on the point of leaving England, would, he thought, prevent\nhis enquiring whither she was gone, and by introducing him into a new\nset of acquaintance, turn his thoughts to other objects and perfect his\ncure.\n\nWhile Delamere then was travelling to Ireland in pursuit of Fitz-Edward,\nMrs. Stafford and Emmeline left Southampton on a visit to Lady Adelina\nin the Isle of Wight; being desirous of delivering little William into\nthe arms of his mother and his uncle. Tho' it was now almost the end of\nJanuary, they embarked in an open boat, with the servant who waited on\nthe child; but being detained 'till almost noon on account of the tide,\nit was evening before they reached a village on the shore, three miles\nbeyond Cowes, where they were to land.\n\nOn arriving there, they found that the house of Captain Godolphin was\nsituated two miles farther. Mrs. Stafford, ever attentive and\nconsiderate, was afraid that the sight of the child so unexpectedly,\nmight overpower the spirits of Lady Adelina, and cause speculation among\nthe servants which it was absolutely necessary to avoid. Emmeline\ntherefore undertook to walk forward, attended by a boy in the village,\nwho was to shew her the way, and apprize Lady Adelina of the visitor she\nwas to expect.\n\nPleasure, in spite of herself, glowed in her bosom at the idea of again\nmeeting Godolphin; tho' she knew not that he had conceived for her the\nmost pure and ardent passion that was ever inspired by a lovely and\ndeserving object.\n\nHe had long since found that his heart was irrecoverably gone. But tho'\nhe struggled not against his passion, he loved too truly to indulge it\nat the expence of Emmeline; and had therefore determined to avoid her,\nand not to embitter _her_ life with the painful conviction that their\nacquaintance had destroyed the happiness of _his_. For this reason he\ndid not intend going himself to fetch his nephew from Woodbury Forest,\nbut had given a careful servant directions to go thither in a few days\nafter that when Emmeline herself prevented the necessity of the journey.\n\nHer walk lay along the high rocks that bounded the coast; and it was\nalmost dark before she entered a small lawn surrounded with a\nplantation, in which the house of Godolphin was situated. About half an\nacre of ground lay between it and the cliff, which was beat by the\nswelling waves of the channel. The ground on the other side rose more\nsuddenly; and a wood which covered the hill behind it, seemed to embosom\nthe house, and take off that look of bleakness and desolation which\noften renders a situation so near the sea unpleasant except in the\nwarmest months of Summer. A sand walk lead round the lawn. Emmeline\nfollowed it, and it brought her close to the windows of a parlour. They\nwere still open; she looked in; and saw, by the light of the fire, for\nthere were no candles in the room, Godolphin sitting alone. He leaned on\na book, which there was not light enough to read; scattered papers lay\nround him, and a pen and ink were on the table.\n\nEmmeline could not forbear looking at him a moment before she approached\nthe door. She could as little command her curiosity to know on what he\nwas thus deeply thinking. The boy who was with her ran round to the\nkitchen, and sent up a servant to open the door; who immediately\nthrowing open that of the parlour, said--'A lady, Sir!'\n\nGodolphin starting from his reverie, arose, and unexpectedly beheld the\nsubject of it.\n\nHis astonishment at this visit, was such as hardly left him the power to\nexpress the pleasure with which that astonishment was mingled. 'Miss\nMowbray!' exclaimed he--'Is it indeed Miss Mowbray?'\n\nFor a moment he surveyed her in silent extasy, then congratulated\nhimself upon his unhoped for good fortune; and answering her enquiries\nabout Lady Adelina, he suddenly seemed to recollect the papers which lay\non the table, hurried them into a drawer, and again returning to\nEmmeline, told her how happy he was to see her look so well. He thought\nindeed that he had never seen her so infinitely lovely. The sharpness of\nthe air during her walk had heightened the glow of her complexion; her\neyes betrayed, by their soft and timid glances, the partiality of which\nshe was hardly yet conscious; she trembled, without knowing why; and\ncould hardly recover her composure, while Godolphin, who would trust no\nother person to deliver the message, ran eagerly up stairs to acquaint\nLady Adelina. 'My sister,' cried he, immediately returning, 'will be\nwith you instantly; a slight pain in her head has kept her on the bed\nalmost all day. But to what do we owe the happiness of seeing you here,\nwhen we thought you on the point of sailing for France by another\nroute?'\n\nEmmeline then hastily explained the change in their plan; adding,\ngravely--'You will have another visitor, who cannot fail of being\nwelcome both to you and Lady Adelina. Mrs. Stafford stays with him at\nthe village, while she desired me to come on to prepare you for his\nreception, and to know how you will have him introduced?'\n\n'As _my_ child,' answered Godolphin. 'My servants are already prepared\nto expect such an addition to my family. Ever amiable, ever lovely Miss\nMowbray!' continued he, with looks that encreased her confusion--'what\nobligation does not our little boy--do we not all owe you?'\n\nAt this moment Lady Adelina, who had been obliged to wait some moments\nto recover herself from the joyful surprise into which the news of\nEmmeline's arrival had thrown her, ran into the room, and embracing with\ntransport her lovely friend, sighed; but unable to weep, sat down, and\ncould only kiss her hands with such wild expressions of rapture, that\nEmmeline was alarmed least it should have any ill effect on her\nintellects, or on a frame ever extremely delicate; and which now had,\nfrom her having long indulged incurable sorrow, assumed an appearance of\nsuch languor and weakness, that Emmeline with extreme concern looked on\nher as on a beautiful shadow whom she probably beheld for the last time.\n\nShe stood a moment pensively gazing on her face. Godolphin said gently\nto his sister, who still held the hand of Emmeline--'Adelina, my love,\nrecollect yourself--you keep Miss Mowbray standing.'\n\n'What is yet more material,' answered Emmeline, smiling, is, 'that you\nkeep me from writing a note to Mrs. Stafford, which the boy who waits\nhere is to take back to her.'\n\nGodolphin answered that he would go himself to Mrs. Stafford, and\ninstantly departed; while Emmeline began to talk to Lady Adelina of the\nimmediate arrival of her child. She at length succeeded in getting her\nto speak of him, and to weep extremely; after which, she grew more\ncomposed, and her full heart seemed relieved by talking of her brother.\n\nHer words, tho' faint, and broken by the emotion she felt, yet forcibly\nconveyed to the heart of Emmeline impressions of that uncommon worth\nthey described.\n\n'Never,' said she, 'can I be sufficiently grateful to heaven for having\ngiven me such a brother. 'Tis not in words, my Emmeline, to do him\njustice! He is all that is noble minded and generous. Tho' from the loss\nof his vivacity and charming spirits, I know too well how deeply my\nunworthy conduct has wounded him; tho' I know, that by having sullied\nthe fair name of our family, and otherwise, I have been the unhappy\ncause of injuring his peace, yet never has a reproach or an unkind word\nescaped him. Pensive, yet always kind; melancholy, and at times visibly\nunhappy; yet ever gentle, considerate, and attentive to me; always ready\nto blame himself for yielding to that despondence which he cannot\nwithout an effort conquer; trying to alleviate the anguish of my mind by\nsubduing that which frequently preys on his own; and now burying the\nmemory of my fault in compassion to my affliction, he adopts my child,\nand allows me without a blush to embrace the dear infant, for whom I\ndare not otherwise shew the tenderness I feel.'\n\nEmmeline, affected by this eulogium, to which her heart warmly assented,\nwas silent.\n\n'There is,' reassumed Lady Adelina, 'but one being on earth who\nresembles him:--it is my Emmeline! If ever two creatures eminently\nexcelled the rest of their species, it is my friend and my brother!'\n\nSomething throbbed at the heart of Emmeline at these words, into which\nshe was afraid to enquire: her engagement to Delamere, yet uncancelled,\nlay like a weight upon it; and seemed to impress the idea of her doing\nwrong while she thus listened to the praises of another; and felt that\nshe listened with too much pleasure! She asked herself, however, whether\nit was possible to be insensible of the merit of Godolphin? Yet\nconscious that she had already thought of it too much, she wished to\nchange the topic of discourse--But Lady Adelina still pursued it.\n\n'Lord Westhaven,' said she, 'my elder brother, is indeed a most\nrespectable and excellent man. Equally with my brother William, he\ninherits from my father, integrity, generosity and nobleness of mind,\ntogether with a regularity of morals and conduct, unusual in so young a\nman even in any rank of life, and remarkable in him, who has passed\nalmost all his in the army. But he is, tho' not yet thirty, much older\nthan I am, and has almost always been absent from me; those who know him\nbetter, have told me, that with as many other good qualities as William,\nhe has less softness of temper; and being almost free from error\nhimself, makes less allowance for the weakness of others. Such, however,\nhas been the management of my younger brother, that the elder knows not\nthe truth of my circumstances--he does not even suspect them. You may\nvery possibly see him and Lady Westhaven abroad. I know I need not\ncaution my Emmeline--she will be careful of the peace of her poor\nfriend.'\n\nEmmeline soon satisfied Lady Adelina on that head, who then asked when\nshe heard of Delamere?\n\nThis question Emmeline had foreseen: but having predetermined not to\ndistress her unfortunate friend, by telling her into what difficulties\nher attendance on her and her child had led her, and being shocked to\nown herself the subject of suspicions so injurious as those Delamere had\ndared to harbour, she calmly answered that Delamere was returned to\nEngland, but that she had seen him only for a few moments.\n\n'And did he not object,' enquired Lady Adelina, 'to your quitting\nEngland, since he is himself returned to it?'\n\nEmmeline, who could not directly answer this question, evaded it by\nsaying--\n\n'My absence or my presence you know cannot hasten the period, 'till the\narrival of which our marriage cannot take place--_if_ it ever takes\nplace at all.'\n\n'_If_ it ever takes place at all?' repeated Lady Adelina--'Does then any\ndoubt remain of it?'\n\n'An affair of that sort,' replied Emmeline, assuming as much unconcern\nas she could, 'is always doubtful where so many clashing interests and\nopposite wishes are to be reconciled, and where so very young a man as\nMr. Delamere is to decide.'\n\n'Do you suspect that he wavers then?' very earnestly asked Lady Adelina,\nfixing her eyes on the blushing face of Emmeline.\n\n'I really am not sure,' answered she--'you know my promise, reluctantly\ngiven, was only conditional. I am far from being anxious to anticipate\nby firmer engagements the certainty of it's being fulfilled; much better\ncontented I should be, if he yet took a few years longer to consider of\nit. You, Lady Adelina,' continued she, smiling, 'are surely no advocate\nfor early marriages; and Mrs. Stafford is greatly averse to them. You\nmust therefore suppose that what my two friends have found inimical to\ntheir happiness, I cannot consider as being likely to constitute mine.'\n\nThis speech had the effect Emmeline intended. It brought back the\nthoughts of Lady Adelina from the uncertainties of her friend to her own\nactual sorrows. She sighed deeply.\n\n'You say truly,' said she. '_I_ have no reason to wish those I love may\nprecipitately form indissoluble engagements; nor _do_ I wish it. Would\nto God _I_ had not been the victim of an hasty and unhappy marriage; or\nthat I had been the _only_ victim. Emmeline,' added she, lowering her\nvoice, now hardly audible, 'Emmeline, _may_ I ask?--where is--spare me\nthe repetition of a name I have solemnly vowed never to utter--you\nunderstand me?'\n\n'I do,' answered Emmeline, gravely. 'He has been in Ireland; but is now\nI suppose in London, as the time he told me he should pass there has\nlong since elapsed. I heard he was to return no more to Tylehurst, and\nthat Mr. Delamere had given up the house there; but of this I know\nnothing from themselves. The person you enquire after, I have seen only\nonce, and that for half an hour. Mrs. Stafford can tell you more, if you\nwish to hear it.'\n\n'Ah! pardon my wretched weakness, Emmeline! I know I ought to conquer\nit! But I cannot help wishing--I cannot help being anxious to hear of\nhim! Yet would I conceal from every one but you that the recollection of\nthis unhappy man never a moment leaves me. Tell me, my angelic friend!\nfor of you I may ask and be forgiven--has he seen his son?'\n\n'He has; and was extremely affected. But dear Lady Adelina, do not, I\nbeseech you, enquire into the particulars of the interview. Try, my\nbeloved friend, to divest yourself of these painful recollections--ah!\ntry to recover your peace, and preserve your life, for the sake of our\ndear little William and those friends who love you.'\n\nThe unhappy Adelina, who notwithstanding all her efforts, was devoured\nby an incurable affection for a man whom she had sworn to banish from\nher heart for ever, and whose name her brother would not suffer her to\npronounce, now gave way to an agony of passion which she could indulge\nonly before Emmeline; and so violently was she affected by regret and\ndespair, that her friend trembled least her reason should again forsake\nit's seat. She tried, by soothing and tenderness, to appease this\nsudden effusion of grief; and had hardly restored her to some degree of\ncomposure, before Mrs. Stafford entered the room and embraced most\ncordially Lady Adelina, while Godolphin followed her with the little boy\nin his arms. In contemplating the beauty of his nephew, he had forgotten\nthe misery of which his birth had been the occasion; for with all the\nhumanity of a brave man, Godolphin possessed a softness of heart, which\nthe helpless innocence of the son, and the repentant sorrow of the\nmother, melted into more than feminine tenderness. He carried the child\nto his sister, and put it into her arms--\n\n'Take him, my Adelina!' said he--'take our dear boy: and while you\nembrace and bless him, you will feel all you owe to those who have\npreserved him.'\n\nLady Adelina did indeed feel such complicated sensations that she was\nunable to utter a word. She could only press the little boy to her heart\nand bedew his face with tears. Her affecting silence and pale\ncountenance alarmed both Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline; and the former,\nwilling to give her thoughts a new turn, said--\n\n'You do not suppose, my dear friends, that we intend to go back to\nSouthampton to night? so I hope you will give us some supper and beds in\nthis hospitable island.'\n\nGodolphin, who had been too much enchanted to think before, immediately\nsaw that the meaning of Mrs. Stafford's solicitude was merely to call\nthe thoughts of his sister from herself to her guests; he seconded\ntherefore this intention, by desiring Lady Adelina to give proper orders\nabout the apartments for her friends; and to take _his_ little boy to\nthat which had been prepared for his reception. The three ladies\ntherefore withdrew with the child; where Lady Adelina soon recovered\nsome degree of serenity, and was able to sit at table while they supped.\n\nHad Mrs. Stafford been before unsuspicious of the passion of Godolphin\nfor Emmeline, she would have been convinced of it during the course of\nthis evening. His voice, his countenance, his manner, evidently betrayed\nit; and whenever the eyes of Emmeline were turned to any other object,\nhis were fixed on her face, with looks so expressive of tender\nadmiration, yet tempered by a kind of hopeless dejection, that the most\nuninterested observer could hardly have mistaken his thoughts.\n\nBut it was not her face, however interesting; or her form, however\ngraceful; that rivetted the chains of Godolphin. He had seen many faces\nmore regularly beautiful, and many figures equally elegant, with\nindifference: he had heard, with coldness, the finest sentiments uttered\nby the fairest mouths; and had listened to the brilliant sallies of\nfashionable wit, with contempt. In Emmeline, he discovered a native\ndignity of soul, an enlarged and generous heart, a comprehensive and\ncultivated understanding, a temper at once soft and lively, with morals\nthe most pure, and manners simple, undesigning and ingenuous. To these\nsolid perfections, genius had added all the lighter graces; and nature,\na form which, enchanting as it must ever have been, seemed to receive\nirresistible charms from the soul by which it was informed.\n\nAll his philosophy could not prevent his being sensible of the\nattractions of such a woman; nor was his resolution sufficiently strong\nto enable him to struggle against their influence, even when he found he\nhad nothing to hope. But yielding to the painful delight of loving her,\nhe persuaded himself that tho' he could not conquer he could conceal it;\nand that while she was ignorant of his passion it could be injurious\nonly to himself.\n\nHis absence and silence during supper was broken only by his natural\npoliteness. After it concluded, they drew round the fire; and the three\nladies entered into one of those interesting conversations that are so\npleasant where mutual confidence and esteem reign among the party.\n\nGodolphin continued silent; and insensibly fell into a train of thought\nthe most dangerous to that appearance of indifference which he believed\nhe could observe. Looking at Emmeline as she talked to his sister, and\nremembering all the friendship she had shewn her, hearing the sound of\nher voice and the elegance of her expressions, he began insensibly to\nconsider how blessed he _might_ have been, had he known her before her\nhand was promised and her affections given to the fortunate Delamere.\n\n'Had it but been _my_ lot!' said he to himself--'had it been _my_\nlot!--ah, what happiness, after the fatigues and dangers of my\nprofession, to return to this place which I love so much, and to be\nreceived by such a friend--such a mistress--such a wife as she will\nmake!' He indulged these ideas, 'till absolutely lost in them, he was\nunconscious of every thing but their impression, and starting up, he\nstruck his hands together and cried--\n\n'Merciful heaven!--and can it then never be?'\n\nAlarmed at the suddenness of an exclamation so causeless, Lady Adelina\nlooked terrified and her friends amazed.\n\n'What, brother?--what are you speaking of?' enquired she.\n\n'I beg your pardon,' said Godolphin, instantly recollecting himself, and\nblushing for this unguarded sally--'I beg your pardon. I was thinking of\nsome business I have to settle; but I do not deserve to be forgiven for\nsuffering my mind in such company to dwell on any thing but the pleasure\nI enjoy; and for yielding to a foolish custom I have acquired of\nuttering aloud whatever is immediately in my mind; an habit,' added he,\nsmiling, 'that has grown upon me by living so much alone. Since Lady\nAdelina is now fixed with me, I hope I shall cease to speak and think\nlike an hermit, and be again humanized. Adelina, my love, you look\nfatigued.'\n\n'Ah!' replied she, 'of what fatigue can I be sensible when with those\nwho I most love and value; and from whom, to-morrow--to-morrow I must\npart!'\n\n'I doubt that extremely,' said Godolphin, trying to carry the\nconversation entirely from his own strange behaviour. 'If I have any\nskill in the weather, to-morrow will bring a gale of wind, which will\nopportunely make prisoners of our two fair friends for another day.'\n\n'How infinitely,' cried Lady Adelina, 'shall I be obliged to it.'\n\nThe rising of the wind during the whole evening had made Godolphin's\nconjecture highly probable. Mrs. Stafford, impatient to return to her\nchildren, whom she never willingly left wholly in the care of servants,\nheard it's encreasing violence with regret. Emmeline tried to do so too;\nbut she could not prevail on herself to lament a circumstance likely to\nkeep her another day with Lady Adelina and her little boy. She wanted\ntoo to see a little of this beautiful island, of which she had heard so\nmuch; and found several other reasons for wishing to remain, without\nallowing herself to suppose that Godolphin had on these wishes the\nsmallest influence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nEarly the next morning, Emmeline arose; and looking towards the sea, saw\na still encreasing tempest gathering visibly over it. She wandered over\nthe house; which tho' not large was chearful and elegant, and she\nfancied every thing in it bore testimony to the taste and temper of its\nmaster. The garden charmed her still more; surrounded by copse-wood and\never-greens, and which seemed equally adapted to use and pleasure. The\ncountry behind it, tho' divested of its foliage and verdure, appeared\nmore beautiful than any she had seen since she left Wales; and with\nuncommon avidity she enjoyed, even amid the heavy gloom of an impending\nstorm, the great and magnificent spectacle afforded by the sea. By\nreminding her of her early pleasures at Mowbray Castle, it brought back\na thousand half-obliterated and agreeable, tho' melancholy images to her\nmind; while its grandeur gratified her taste for the sublime.\n\nAs she was indulging these contemplations, the wind suddenly blew with\nastonishing violence; and before Mrs. Stafford arose, the sea was become\nso tempestuous and impracticable, that eagerly as she wished to return\nto her children she could not think of braving it.\n\nGodolphin had seen Emmeline wandering along the cliff, and had\nresolutely denied himself the pleasure of joining her; for from what had\npassed the evening before, he began to doubt his own power to forbear\nspeaking to her of the subject that filled his heart.\n\nThey now met at breakfast; and Emmeline was charmed with her walk, tho'\nshe had been driven from it by the turbulence of the weather, which by\nthis time had arisen to an hurricane. When their breakfast ended, Mrs.\nStafford followed Lady Adelina, who wanted to consult her on something\nthat related to the little boy; Godolphin went out to give some orders;\nand Emmeline retired to a bow window which looked towards the sea.\n\nCould she have divested her mind of its apprehensions that what formed\nfor her a magnificent and sublime scene brought shipwreck and\ndestruction to many others, she would have been highly pleased with a\nsight of the ocean in its present tremendous state. Lost in\ncontemplating the awful spectacle, she did not see or hear Godolphin;\nwho imagining she had left the room with his sister, had returned, and\nwith his arms crossed, and his eyes fixed on her face, stood on the\nother side of the window like a statue.\n\nThe gust grew more vehement, and deafened her with it's fury; while the\nmountainous waves it had raised, burst thundering against the rocks and\nseemed to shake their very foundation. Emmeline, at the picture her\nimagination drew of their united powers of desolation, shuddered\ninvoluntarily and sighed.\n\n'What disturbs Miss Mowbray?' said Godolphin.\n\nEmmeline, unwilling to acknowledge that she had been so extremely absent\nas not to know he was in the room, answered, without expressing her\nsurprise to see him there--'I was thinking how fatal this storm which we\nare contemplating, may be to the fortunes and probably the lives of\nthousands.'\n\n'The gale,' returned Godolphin, 'is heavy, but by no means of such fatal\npower as you apprehend. I have been at sea in several infinitely more\nviolent, and shall probably be in many others.'\n\n'I hope not,' answered Emmeline, without knowing what she said--'Surely\nyou do not mean it?'\n\n'A professional man,' said he, smiling, and flattered by the eagerness\nwith which she spoke, 'has, you know, no will of his own. I certainly\nshould not seek danger; but it is not possible in such service as ours\nto avoid it.'\n\n'Why then do you not quit it?'\n\n'If I intended to give you a high idea of my _prudence_, I should say,\nbecause I am a younger brother. But to speak honestly, that is not my\nonly motive; my fortune, limited as it is, is enough for all my wishes,\nand will probably suffice for any I shall _now_ ever form; but a man of\nmy age ought not surely to waste in torpid idleness, or trifling\ndissipation, time that may be usefully employed. Besides, I love the\nprofession to which I have been brought up, and, by engaging in which, I\nowe a life to my country if ever it should be called for.'\n\n'God forbid it ever should!' said Emmeline, with quickness; 'for then,'\ncontinued she, hesitating and blushing, 'what would poor Lady Adelina\ndo? and what would become of my dear little boy?'\n\nGodolphin, charmed yet pained by this artless expression of sensibility,\nand thrown almost off his guard by the idea of not being wholly\nindifferent to her, answered mournfully--'To them, indeed, my life may\nbe of some value; but to myself it is of none. Ah, Miss Mowbray! it\nmight have been worth preserving had I----But wherefore presume I to\ntrouble you on a subject so hopeless? I know not what has tempted me to\nintrude on your thoughts the incoherences of a mind ill at ease. Pardon\nme--and suffer not my folly to deprive me of the happiness of being your\nfriend, which is all I will ever pretend to.'\n\nHe turned away, and hastened out of the room; leaving Emmeline in such\nconfusion that it was not 'till Mrs. Stafford came to call her to Lady\nAdelina's dressing-room, that she remembered where she was, and the\nnecessity of recollecting her scattered thoughts. When they met at\ndinner, she could not encounter the eyes of Godolphin without the\ndeepest blushes: Lady Adelina, given wholly up to the idea of their\napproaching separation, and Mrs. Stafford, occupied by uneasiness of her\nown, did not attend to the singularity of her manner.\n\nThe latter had never beheld such a tempest as was now raging; and she\ncould not look towards the sea, whose high and foaming billows were\nbreaking so near them, without shivering at the terrifying recollection,\nthat in a very few hours her children, all she held dear on earth, would\nbe exposed to this capricious and furious element. Tho' of the steadiest\nresolution in any trial that merely regarded herself, she was a coward\nwhen these dear objects of her fondness were in question; and she could\nnot help expressing to Mr. Godolphin some part of her apprehensions.\n\n'As I have gained some credit,' answered he, 'for my sagacity in\nforeseeing the gale, I might perhaps as well not hazard the loss of it,\nby another prophecy, for which you, Lady Adelina, will not thank me.--It\nwill be fine, I am afraid, to-morrow.'\n\n'And the day following we embark for France,' said Mrs. Stafford; 'how\nprovidential that we could not sail yesterday!'\n\n'Your heart fails you, my dear Mrs. Stafford,' replied Godolphin, 'and I\ndo not wonder at it. But I will tell you what you shall allow me to do:\nI will attend you to-morrow to Southampton, where in the character of a\nveteran seaman I will direct your departure, (as the whole pacquet is\nyours) according to the appearance of the weather; and to indulge me\nstill farther, you shall suffer me to see you landed at Havre. Adelina,\nI know, will be wretched 'till she hears you are safe on the other side;\nand will therefore willingly spare me to bring her such intelligence;\nand give me at the same time a fortunate opportunity of being useful to\nyou.'\n\nMrs. Stafford, secretly rejoiced at a proposal which would secure them a\nprotector and as much safety as depended on human skill, could not\nconceal her wish to assent to it; tho' she expressed great reluctance to\ngive him so much trouble.\n\nGodolphin then consulted the eyes of Emmeline, which on meeting his were\ncast down; but he could not find that they expressed any displeasure at\nhis offer: he therefore assured Mrs. Stafford that he should consider it\nas a pleasurable scheme with a party to whom he was indifferent; 'but\nwhen,' added he, 'it gives me the means of being of the least use to\nyou, to Miss Mowbray, and your children, I shall find in it not only\npleasure but happiness. Alas! how poorly it will repay the twentieth\npart of the obligation we owe you!'\n\nIt was settled therefore that Mr. Godolphin was to cross the channel\nwith them. Again Emmeline tried to be sorry, and again found herself\nincapable of feeling any thing but satisfaction in hearing that he would\nbe yet longer with them.\n\nDuring the rest of the evening, he tried to assume a degree of\nchearfulness; and did in some measure feel it in the prospect of this\nfarther temporary indulgence.\n\nLady Adelina, unable to conceal her concern, drooped without any effort\nto imitate him; and when they parted for the night, could not help\ndeploring in terms of piercing regret their approaching separation.\n\nThe assurances Godolphin had given them of a favourable morning were\nfulfilled. They found that tho' there was yet a considerable swell, the\nwind had subsided entirely, and that they might safely cross to\nSouthampton. The boat that was to convey them was ready; and Emmeline\ncould not take leave of Lady Adelina without sharing the anguish which\nshe could not mitigate. They embraced silently and in tears; and\nEmmeline pressed to her heart the little boy, to whom she was tenderly\nattached.\n\nGodolphin was a silent spectator of this melancholy farewel. The\nsoftness of Emmeline's heart was to him her greatest charm, and he could\nhardly help repeating, in the words of Louis XIV--'She has so much\nsensibility that it must be an exquisite pleasure to be beloved by her!'\n\nHe sighed in remembering that such could not be his happiness; then\nwishing to shorten a scene which so violently affected the unsettled\nspirits of Lady Adelina, he would have led Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline\naway; but Lady Adelina insisted on following them to the shore; smiled\nthro' her tears; and promised to behave better. Silently they walked to\nthe sea-side. Mrs. Stafford hastily embracing her, was handed into the\nboat by Godolphin; who then advancing with forced gaiety to Emmeline,\nabout whom his sister still fondly hung, said--'Come, come, I must have\nno more adieus--as if you were never to meet again.'\n\n'Ah! who can tell,' answered Lady Adelina, 'that we ever shall!'\n\nEmmeline spoke not; but kissing the hand of her weeping friend, gave her\nown to Godolphin; while Lady Adelina, resting on the arm of her woman,\nand overwhelmed with sorrow, suffered the boat to depart.\n\nIt rowed swiftly away; favoured by the tide. Lady Adelina remained on\nthe shore as long as she could distinguish it; and then slowly and\nreluctantly returned to solitude and tears: while her two friends,\nattended by her brother, landed safely at Southampton, where he busied\nhimself in settling every thing for their departure the next morning in\nthe pacquet which they had hired, and which now lay ready to receive\nthem.\n\nDuring their passage to Havre, which was short and prosperous, the\nattention of Godolphin was equally divided between Mrs. Stafford, her\nchildren, and Emmeline. But when he assisted the latter to leave the\nvessel, he could not forbear pressing her to his heart, while in a deep\nsigh he bade adieu to the happiness of being with her; for he concluded\nshe would not long remain single, and after she was married he\ndetermined never more to trust himself with the dangerous pleasure of\nbeholding her.\n\nHe had never mentioned the name of Delamere; and knew not that he was\nreturned to England. Having once been assured of her engagement, he was\nunable to enquire into the circumstances of what had destroyed his\nhappiness. He knew they were to be married in March, and that Delamere\nhad promised to remain on the Continent 'till that period. He doubted\nnot, therefore, but that Emmeline, in compliance with the entreaties of\nher lover, had consented to accompany Mrs. Stafford to France, and by\nher presence to charm away the months that yet intervened; after which\nhe supposed they would be immediately united.\n\nNotwithstanding some remarks he had made on the interest she seemed to\ntake in regard to himself, he imputed it merely to her general\nsensibility and to his relationship to Lady Adelina. He supposed that\nDelamere possessed her heart; and tho' it was the only possession on\nearth that would give him any chance of happiness, he envied this happy\nlover without hating him. He could not blame him for loving her, who was\nin his own opinion irresistible; nor for having used the opportunity his\ngood fortune had given him of winning her affections. The longer he\nconversed with her, the more he was convinced that Delamere, in being as\nhe believed master of that heart, was the most fortunate of human\nbeings. But tho' he had not resolution enough to refuse himself the\nmelancholy yet pleasing gratification of contemplating perfections which\nhe thought could never be his, and tho' he could not help sometimes\nbetraying the fondness which that indulgence hourly encreased, he never\nseriously meditated supplanting the happy Delamere. He did not think\nthat to attempt it was honourable; and his integrity would have\nprevented the trial, had he supposed it possible to succeed.\n\nMrs. Stafford had at first seen with concern that Godolphin, whom she\nsincerely esteemed, was nourishing for her friend a passion which could\nonly serve to make him unhappy. But she now saw it's progress rather\nwith pleasure than regret. She was piqued at the groundless jealousy and\nrash injustice of Delamere towards Emmeline: and disappointed and\ndisgusted at Lord Montreville's conduct towards herself; sickening at\nthe little sincerity of the latter, and doubtful of the temper of the\nformer, she feared that if the alliance took place, her friend would\nfind less happiness than splendour: and she looked with partial eyes on\nGodolphin; who in morals, manners, and temper, was equally\nunexceptionable, and whose fortune, tho' inferior to his birth, was yet\nenough for happiness in that style of life which she knew better\ncalculated for the temper and taste of Emmeline than the parade and\ngrandeur she might share with Delamere.\n\nGodolphin had no parents to accept her with disdainful and cold\nacquiescence--no sister to treat her with supercilious condescension.--But\nall his family, tho' of a rank superior to that of Delamere, would\nreceive her with transport, and treat her with the respect and affection\nshe deserved.\n\nMrs. Stafford, however, spoke not to Emmeline of this revolution in her\nsentiments, but chose rather to let the affair take it's course than to\nbe in any degree answerable for it's consequences.\n\nThe hour in which Godolphin was to leave them now approached. Unable to\ndetermine on bidding Emmeline farewel, he would still have lingered with\nher, and would have gone on with them to Rouen, where Stafford waited\ntheir arrival: but this, Mrs. Stafford was compelled to decline; fearing\nleast this extraordinary attention in a stranger should induce her\nhusband to make enquiry into their first acquaintance, and by that means\nlead to discoveries which could not fail of being injurious to Lady\nAdelina.\n\nOf all that related to her, he was at present ignorant. He had been\ntold, that the infant which his wife and Miss Mowbray so often visited,\nwas the son of an acquaintance of the latter; who being obliged soon\nafter it's birth to go to the West Indies, had sent it to Bath to\nEmmeline, who had undertaken to overlook the nurse to whose care it was\ncommitted.\n\nInto a circumstance which offered neither a scheme to occupy his mind,\nor money to purchase his pleasures, Stafford thought it not then worth\nhis while farther to enquire; but now, in a country of which he\nunderstood not the language, and detached from his usual pursuits, Mrs.\nStafford knew not what strange suspicions the assiduity of Godolphin\nmight excite in a head so oddly constructed; and without explaining her\nreasons to Godolphin, she said enough to convince him that he must, with\nwhatever reluctance, leave the lovely travellers at Havre.\n\nHe busied himself, however, in adjusting every thing for the safety of\ntheir journey; and being in the course of their preparations left alone\nwith Emmeline in a room of the hotel, he could not forbear using the\nlast opportunity he was likely to have of speaking to her.--\n\n'Has Miss Mowbray any commands to Lady Adelina?'\n\n'My most affectionate love!' answered Emmeline, 'my truest remembrance!\nAnd tell her, that the moment I am settled I will give her an account of\nmy situation, and of all that happens worth her knowing.'\n\n'We shall hear then,' said he, forcing a melancholy smile, 'we shall\nhear when you meet the fortunate, the happy Mr. Delamere.'\n\n'Lady Adelina,' blushingly replied Emmeline, 'will certainly know it if\nI should meet him; but nothing is at present more improbable.'\n\n'Tis now,' reassumed Godolphin, 'the last week of\nJanuary--February--March--ah! how soon March will come! Tell me, how\nlong in that month may Adelina direct to Miss Mowbray?'\n\n'Mr. Delamere, Sir,' said Emmeline, gravely, 'is not now in France.'\n\n'But may he not immediately return thither from Geneva or any other\nplace? Is my sister, Lady Westhaven, to be present at the ceremony?'\n\n'The ceremony,' answered she, half angry and half vexed, 'may perhaps\nnever take place.'\n\nThe awkwardness of her situation in regard to Delamere arose forcibly to\nher mind, and something lay very heavy at her heart. She tried to check\nthe tears which were filling her eyes, least they should be imputed to a\nvery different cause; but the effort she made to conquer her feelings\nrendered them more acute. She took out a handkerchief to wipe away these\ninvoluntary betrayers of her emotion, and sitting down, audibly sobbed.\n\nGodolphin had asked these questions, in that sort of desperate\nresolution which a person exerts who determines to know, in the hope of\nbeing able to endure, the worst that can befal him. But he was now\nshocked at the distress they had occasioned, and unable to bear the\nsight of her tears.\n\n'Pardon me,' cried he, 'pardon me, most lovely, most amiable\nEmmeline!--oh! pardon me for having given a moment's pain to that soft\nand sensible bosom. Had I suspected that a reference to an event towards\nwhich I supposed you looked forward with pleasure, could thus affect\nyou, I had not presumed to name it. Whenever it happens,' added he,\nafter a short pause--'whenever it happens, Delamere will be the most\nenviable of human beings: and may you, Madam, be as happy as you are\ntruly deserving of happiness!'\n\nHe dared not trust his voice with another word: but under pretence of\nfetching a glass of water left the room, and having recovered himself,\nquickly returned and offered it to Emmeline, again apologizing for\nhaving offended her.\n\nShe took the glass from him; and faintly smiling thro' her tears, said\nin the gentlest accents--'I am not offended--I am only low spirited.\nTired by the voyage, and shrinking from the fatigue of a long journey,\nyet you talk to me of a journey for life, on which I may never set out\nin the company you mention--and still more probably never undertake at\nall.'\n\nThe entrance of Mrs. Stafford, who came to entreat some directions from\nGodolphin, prevented the continuance of this critical conversation; in\nwhich, whatever the words imported in regard to Delamere, he found but\nlittle hope for himself. He attributed what Emmeline had said to mere\nevasion, and her concern to some little accidental neglect on the part\nof her lover which had excited her displeasure. Ignorant of the jealousy\nDelamere had conceived from the misrepresentation of the Crofts', which\nthe solicitude of Emmeline for the infant of Lady Adelina had so\nimmediately matured, he had not the most distant idea of the truth; nor\nsuspected that the passion of Delamere for Emmeline, which he knew had\nwithin a few weeks been acknowledged without hesitation, and received\nwith encouragement, was now become to him a source of insupportable\ntorment; that she had left England without bidding him adieu, or even\ninforming him that she was gone.\n\nThe two chaises were now ready; and Godolphin having placed in the\nfirst, Mrs. Stafford and her younger children, approached Emmeline to\nlead her to the second, in which she was to accompany the elder. He\nstopped a moment as they were quitting the room, and said--'I cannot,\nMiss Mowbray, bid you adieu till you say you forgive me for the\nimpertinence of my questions.'\n\n'For impertinence?' answered Emmeline, giving him her hand--'I cannot\nforgive you, because I know not that you have been guilty of it. Before\nI go, however, allow me to thank you most sincerely for the protection\nyou have afforded us.'\n\n'And not one word,' cried he, 'not one parting good wish to your little\n_proteg\u00c3\u00a9_--to my poor William?'\n\n'Ah! I send him a thousand!' answered Emmeline.\n\n'And one last kiss, which I will carry him.' She suffered him to salute\nher; and then he hastily led her to the chaise; and, as he put her in,\nsaid very solemnly--'Let me repeat my wishes, Madam, that wheresoever\nyou are, you may enjoy felicity--felicity which I shall never again\nknow; and that Mr. Delamere--the fortunate Delamere--may be as sensible\nof your value as----'\n\nEmmeline, to avoid hearing this sentence concluded, bade the chaise\nproceed. It instantly did so with all the velocity a French postillion\ncould give it; and hardly allowed her to observe the mournful\ncountenance and desponding air with which Godolphin bowed to her, as\nshe, waving her hand, again bade him adieu!\n\nThe travellers arrived in due time safe at Rouen; where Mrs. Stafford\nfound that her husband had been prevented meeting her, by the necessity\nhe fancied himself under to watch the early nests of his Canary birds,\nof which he had now made a large collection, and whose encrease he\nattended to with greater solicitude than the arrival of his family. Mrs.\nStafford saw with an eye of hopeless regret a new source of expence and\nabsurdity opened; but knowing that complaints were more likely to\nproduce anger and resentment in his mind, than any alteration in his\nconduct, she was obliged to conceal her chagrin, and to take possession\nof the gloomy chateau which her husband had chosen for her residence,\nabout six miles from Rouen; while Emmeline, with her usual equality of\ntemper, tried to reconcile herself to her new abode, and to share and\nrelieve the fatigue and uneasiness of her friend. She found the activity\nshe was for this purpose compelled to exert, assuaged and diverted that\npain which she now could no longer hope to conquer, tho' she had not yet\nhad the courage to ascertain, by a narrow examination of her heart in\nregard to Godolphin, that it would be removed no more.\n\nOn the evening after he had bade her adieu, Godolphin embarked in the\npacquet which was on it's departure to England. The weather, tho' cold,\nwas calm; and he sat down on the deck, where, after they had got a few\nleagues from France, all was profoundly quiet. Only the man at the helm\nand one sailor were awake on board. The vessel glided thro' the expanse\nof water; while the soul of Godolphin fled back to Emmeline, and dwelt\nwith lingering fondness on the object of all it's affection.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nEmmeline having thus quitted England, and Delamere appearing no longer\nto think of her, the Crofts', who had brought about an event so\ndesirable for Lord Montreville, thought it time to claim the reward of\nsuch eminent service.\n\nMiss Delamere, in meeting Lady Westhaven at Paris, had severely felt all\nthe difference of their situation; and as she had repented of her\nclandestine union almost as soon as she had formed it, the comparison\nbetween her sister's husband and her own had embittered her temper,\nnever very good, and made her return to England with reluctance; where\nshe knew that she could not long evade acknowledging her marriage, and\ntaking the inferior and humiliating name of _Mrs. Crofts_.\n\nTo avoid returning was however not in her power; nor could she prevail\non Crofts to delay a declaration which must be attended with\ncircumstances, to her most mortifying and unpleasant. But impatient to\ndemand a daughter of Lord Montreville as his wife, and still more\nimpatient to receive twelve thousand pounds, which was her's independant\nof her father, he would hear of no delay; and the present opportunity of\nconciliating Lord and Lady Montreville, was in the opinion of all the\nCrofts' family not to be neglected.\n\nSir Richard undertook to disclose the affair to Lord Montreville, and to\nparry the first effusions of his Lordship's anger by a very common, yet\ngenerally successful stratagem, that of affecting to be angry first, and\ndrowning by his own clamours the complaints of the party really injured.\n\nFor this purpose, he waited early one morning on Lord Montreville, and\nwith a countenance where scornful superiority was dismissed for\npusillanimous dejection, he began.--\n\n'My Lord--when I reflect and consider and remember the innumerable,\ninvaluable and extraordinary favours, kindnesses and obligations I owe\nyour Lordship, my heart bleeds--and I lament and deplore and regret that\nit is my lot to announce and declare and discover, what will I fear give\ninfinite concern and distress and uneasiness to you--and my Lord----'\n\n'What is all this, Sir Richard?' cried Lord Montreville, hastily\ninterrupting him.--'Is Delamere married?'\n\n'Heaven forbid!' answered the hypocritical Crofts.--'Bad, and unwelcome,\nand painful as what I have to say is, it does not amount or arise to\nthat misfortune and calamity.'\n\n'Whatever it is Sir,' said his Lordship impatiently, 'let me hear it at\nonce.--Is it a dismission from my office?'\n\n'Never, I hope!' replied Sir Richard. 'At least, for many years to come,\nmay this country not know and feel and be sensible of such a loss,\ndeprivation and defection. My Lord, my present concern is of a very\ndifferent nature; and I do assure and protest to your Lordship that no\ntime nor intreaties nor persuasion will erase and obliterate and wipe\naway from my mind, the injury and prejudice the parties have done _me_,\nby thus----'\n\n'Keep me no longer in suspense!' almost angrily cried Lord Montreville.\n\n'Mr. Crofts, my Lord; Mr. Crofts is, I find, married--'\n\n'To _my_ daughter, Sir Richard.--Is it not so?'\n\n'He is indeed, my Lord! and from this moment I disclaim, and renounce\nand protest against him; for my Lord----'\n\nSir Richard continued his harangue, to which Lord Montreville did not\nseem to attend. He was a moment silent, and then said--\n\n'I have been more to blame than the parties.--I might have foreseen\nthis. But I thought Fanny's pride a sufficient defence against an\ninferior alliance. Pray Sir, does Lady Montreville know of this\nmarriage?'\n\nSir Richard then related all that his son had told him; interlarding his\naccount with every circumstance that might induce his Lordship to\nbelieve he was himself entirely ignorant of the intrigue. Lord\nMontreville, however, knew too much of mankind in general, and of the\nCrofts' in particular, to give implicit credit to this artful recital.\nBut Sir Richard was now become so necessary to him, and they had so many\nsecrets in common of great consequence to the political reputation of\nboth, that he could not determine to break with him. He considered too\nthat resentment could not unmarry his daughter; that the lineal honours\nof his family could not be affected by her marriage; and that he owed\nthe Crofts' some favour for having counteracted the indiscretion of\nDelamere. Determining therefore, after a short struggle, to sacrifice\nhis pride to his politics, he dismissed Sir Richard with infinitely less\nappearance of resentment than he expected; and after long contention\nwith the furious and irascible pride of his wife, prevailed upon her to\nlet her daughter depart without her malediction. She would not see\nCrofts, or pardon her daughter; protesting that she never could be\nreconciled to a child of her's who bore such an appellation as that of\n'_Mrs. Crofts_.' Soon afterwards, however, the Marquisate which Lord\nMontreville had been so long promised was to be granted him. But his\nwife could not bear, that by assuming a title which had belonged to the\nMowbray family, (a point he particularly wished to obtain) he should\ndrop or render secondary those honours which he derived from _her_\nancestors. Wearied by her persecution, and accustomed to yield to her\nimportunity, he at length gratified her, by relinquishing the name he\nwished to bear, and taking the title of Marquis of Montreville, while\nhis son assumed that of Viscount Delamere. This circumstance seemed\nmore than any other to reconcile Lady Montreville to her eldest\ndaughter, whose surname she could evade under the more satisfactory\nappellation of Lady Frances. She was now therefore admitted to her\nmother's presence; Crofts received an haughty and reluctant pardon; and\nsome degree of tranquillity was restored to the noble house of\nMowbray-Delamere; while the Crofts', more elated and consequential than\nbefore, behaved as if they had inherited and deserved the fortune and\nsplendor that surrounded them: and the table, the buildings, the\nfurniture of Sir Richard, vied in expence and magnificence with those of\nthe most affluent of the nobility.\n\nLord Delamere, to whom the acquisition of a title could offer nothing in\nmitigation of the anguish inflicted by disappointed love, was now at\nDublin; where, immediately on his arrival, he had enquired for Colonel\nFitz-Edward at the house of his brother, Lord Clancarryl.\n\nAs the family were in the country, and only a servant in it, he could\nnot for some days obtain the information he wanted. He heard, however,\nthat Lord Clancarryl was very soon expected, and for his arrival he\ndetermined to wait. In this interval of suspense, he heard from a\ncorrespondent in England, that Miss Mowbray had not only disappeared\nfrom Woodfield, but had actually quitted England; and was gone no one\nknew precisely whither; but it was generally supposed to France.\n\nTho' he had sworn in bitterness of heart to drive for ever from it this\nperfidious and fatal beauty, it seemed as if forgetting his resolution,\nhe had in this intelligence received a new injury. He still fancied that\nshe should have told him of her design to quit England, without\nrecollecting that he had given her no opportunity to speak to him at\nall.\n\nAgain he felt his anger towards Fitz-Edward animated almost to madness;\nand again impatiently sought to hasten a meeting when he might discuss\nwith him all the mischief he had sustained.\n\nLord Clancarryl coming for a few days to Dublin, found there letters\nfrom Lord Montreville, in which his Lordship bespoke for his son the\nacquaintance of the Clancarryl family. Desirous of shewing every\nattention to a young man so nearly connected with his wife's family, by\nthe marriage of her brother, Lord Westhaven, to his youngest sister, and\nrelated also to himself, Lord Clancarryl immediately sought Delamere;\nand was surprised to find, that instead of receiving his advances with\nwarmth or even with politeness, he hardly returned them with common\ncivility, and seemed to attend to nothing that was said. The first pause\nin the conversation, however, Delamere took advantage of to enquire\nafter Colonel Fitz-Edward.\n\n'My brother,' answered Lord Clancarryl, 'left us only three days ago.'\n\n'For London, my Lord?'\n\n'No; he is gone with two other friends on a kind of pleasurable\ntour.--They hired a sloop at Cork to take them to France.'\n\n'To France!' exclaimed Delamere--'Mr. Fitz-Edward gone to France?'\n\n'Yes,' replied Lord Clancarryl, somewhat wondering at the surprise\nDelamere expressed--'and I promoted the plan as much as I could; for\npoor George is, I am afraid, in a bad state of health; his looks and his\nspirits are not what they used to be. Chearful company, and this little\ntour, may I hope restore them. But how happens it that he knew not, Sir,\nof your return? He was persuaded you were still abroad; and expressed\nsome pleasure at the thoughts of meeting you when you least expected\nit.'\n\n'No, no, my Lord,' cried Delamere, in a voice rendered almost\ninarticulate by contending passions--'his hope was not to meet _me_. He\nis gone with far other designs.'\n\n'What designs, Lord Delamere?' gravely asked Lord Clancarryl.\n\n'My Lord,' answered Delamere, recollecting himself, 'I mean not to\ntrouble you on this matter. I have some business to adjust with Mr.\nFitz-Edward; and since he is not here, have only to request of your\nLordship information when he returns, or whither a letter may follow\nhim?'\n\n'Sir,' returned Lord Clancarryl with great gravity, 'I believe I can\nanswer for Colonel Fitz-Edward's readiness to settle _any business_ you\nmay desire to adjust with him; and I wish, since there is _business_\nbetween ye, that I could name the time when you are likely to meet him.\nAll, however, I can decidedly say is, that he intends going to Paris,\nbut that his stay in France will not exceed five or six weeks in the\nwhole; and that such letters as I may have occasion to send, are to be\naddressed to the care of Monsieur de Guisnon, banker, at Paris.'\n\nDelamere having received this intelligence, took a cold leave; and Lord\nClancarryl, who had before heard much of his impetuous temper and\ndefective education, was piqued at his distant manner, and returned to\nhis house in the country without making any farther effort to cultivate\nhis friendship.\n\nDebating whether he should follow Fitz-Edward to France or wait his\nreturn to Ireland, Delamere remained, torn with jealousy and distracted\nby delay. He was convinced beyond a doubt, that Fitz-Edward had met\nEmmeline in France by her own appointment. 'But let them not,' cried\nhe--'let them not hope to escape me! Let them not suppose I will\nrelinquish my purpose 'till I have punished their infamy or cease to\nfeel it!--Oh, Emmeline! Emmeline! is it for this I pursued--for this I\nwon thee!'\n\nThe violence of those emotions he felt after Lord Clancarryl's\ndeparture, subsided only because he had no one to listen to, no one to\nanswer him. He determined, as Lord Clancarryl seemed so certain of his\nbrother's return in the course of six weeks, to wait in Ireland 'till\nthe end of that period, since there was but little probability of his\nmeeting him if he pursued him to France. He concluded that wherever\nEmmeline was, Fitz-Edward might be found also; but the residence of\nEmmeline he knew not, nor could he bear a moment to think that he might\nsee them together.\n\nThe violence of his resentment, far from declining, seemed to resist all\nthe checks it's gratification received, and to burn with accumulated\nfury. His nights brought only tormenting dreams; his days only a\nrepetition of unavailing anguish.\n\nHe had several acquaintances among young men of fashion at Dublin. With\nthem he sometimes associated; and tried to forget his uneasiness in the\npleasures of the table; and sometimes he shunned them entirely, and shut\nhimself up to indulge his disquiet.\n\nIn the mean time, Lady Clancarryl was extremely mortified at the account\nher husband gave her of Delamere's behaviour. She knew that her brother,\nLord Westhaven, would be highly gratified by any attention shewn to the\nfamily of his wife; particularly to a brother to whom Lady Westhaven was\nso much attached. She therefore entreated her Lord to overlook\nDelamere's petulance, and renew the invitation he had given him to Lough\nCarryl. But his Lordship, disgusted with the reception he had before met\nwith, laughed, and desired her to try whether _her_ civilities would be\nmore graciously accepted. Lady Clancarryl therefore took the trouble to\ngo herself to Dublin: where she so pressingly insisted on Delamere's\npassing a fortnight with them, that he could not evade the invitation\nwithout declaring his animosity against Fitz-Edward, and his resolution\nto demand satisfaction--a declaration which could not fail of rendering\nhis purpose abortive. He returned, therefore, to Lough Carryl with her\nLadyship; meaning to stay only a few days, and feeling hurt at being\nthus compelled to become the inmate of a family into which he might so\nsoon carry grief and resentment.\n\nGodolphin, after his return to the Isle of Wight, abandoned himself more\nthan ever to the indulgence of his passion. He soothed yet encreased his\nmelancholy by poetry and music; and Lady Adelina for some time\ncontributed to nourish feelings too much in unison with her own. He now\nno longer affected to conceal from her his attachment to her lovely\nfriend; but to her only it was known. Her voice, and exquisite taste, he\nloved to employ in singing the verses he made; and he would sit hours by\nher _piano fort\u00c3\u00a9_ to hear repeated one of the many sonnets he had\nwritten on her who occupied all his thoughts.\n\n\n                     SONNET\n\n    When welcome slumber sets my spirit free\n      Forth to fictitious happiness it flies,\n    And where Elysian bowers of bliss arise\n      I seem, my Emmeline--to meet with thee!\n\n    Ah! Fancy then, dissolving human ties,\n      Gives me the wishes of my soul to see;\n    Tears of fond pity fill thy softened eyes;\n      In heavenly harmony--our hearts agree.\n\n    Alas! these joys are mine in dreams alone,\n    When cruel Reason abdicates her throne!\n      Her harsh return condemns me to complain\n    Thro' life unpitied, unrelieved, unknown.\n      And, as the dear delusions leave my brain,\n      She bids the truth recur--with aggravated pain.\n\n\nBut Lady Adelina herself at length grew uneasy at beholding the progress\nof this unhappy passion. His mind seemed to have lost all it's strength,\nand to be incapable of making even an effort to shake off an affection\nwhich his honour would not allow him to attempt rendering successful.\nHis spirits, affected by the listless solitude in which he lived, were\nsunk into hopeless despondence; and his sister was every day more\nalarmed, not only for his peace but for his life. She therefore tried\nto make him determine to quit her, for a short abode in London; but to\ndo that he absolutely refused. Lord Clancarryl had long pressed him to\ngo to Ireland: he had not seen his eldest sister for some years; and\nardently wished to embrace her and her children. But Fitz-Edward was at\nher house; and to meet Fitz-Edward was impossible. Lady Clancarryl,\ndeceived by a plausible story, which had been framed to account for Lady\nAdelina's absence, was, as well as her Lord, entirely ignorant of the\nshare Fitz-Edward had in it: they believed it to have been occasioned\nsolely by her antipathy to Trelawny, and her fear lest her relations\nshould insist on her again residing with him; and it was necessary that\nnothing should be said to undeceive them.\n\nGodolphin had therefore been obliged to form several excuses to account\nfor his declining the pressing invitations he received; and he found\nthat his eldest sister was already much hurt by his apparent neglect. In\none of her last letters, she had mentioned that Fitz-Edward was gone to\nFrance; and Lady Adelina pointed out to Godolphin several passages which\nconvinced him he had given pain by his long absence to his beloved\nCamilla, and prevailed upon him to go to Ireland. He arrived therefore\nat Lough Carryl two days after his sister had returned thither with Lord\nDelamere.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nMr. Godolphin was extremely surprised to find, in Ireland, Delamere, the\nhappy Delamere! who he supposed had long since been with Emmeline,\nwaiting the fortunate hour that was to unite them for ever. A very few\nweeks now remained of the year which he had promised to remain\nunmarried; yet instead of his being ready to attend his bride to\nEngland, to claim in the face of the world his father's consent, he was\nlingering in another country, where he appeared to have come only to\nindulge dejection; for he frequently fled from society, and when he was\nin it, forgot himself in gloomy reveries.\n\nNobody knew why he came to Ireland, unless to satisfy a curiosity of\nwhich nothing appeared to remain; yet he still continued there; and as\nLord and Lady Clancarryl were now used to his singular humour, they\nnever enquired into it's cause; while he, flattered by the regard of two\npersons so amiable and respectable, suffered not his enmity to\nFitz-Edward to interfere with the satisfaction he sometimes took in\ntheir society; tho' he oftener past the day almost entirely alone.\nGodolphin could not repress the anxious curiosity he felt, to know what,\nat this period, could separate lovers whose union appeared so certain.\nBut this curiosity he had no means of satisfying. Lady Clancarryl had\nheard nothing of his engagement, or any hint of his approaching\nmarriage; and tho' he was on all other topics, when he entered at all\ninto conversation, remarkably open and unguarded, he spoke not, in\ncompany, of any thing that related to himself.\n\nHe seemed, however, to seek a closer intimacy with Godolphin, whose\nexcellent character he had often heard, and whose appearance and\nconversation confirmed all that had been reported in his favour.\nGodolphin neither courted him or evaded his advances; but could not help\nlooking with astonishment on a man, who on the point of being the\nhusband of the most lovely woman on earth, could saunter in a country\nwhere he appeared to have neither attachments or satisfaction. Sometimes\nhe almost ventured to hope that their engagement was dissolved: but then\nrecollecting that Lady Adelina had assured him the promise of Emmeline\nwas still uncancelled, he checked so flattering an illusion, and\nreturned again to uncertainty and despondence.\n\nOn the third day after Godolphin's arrival, Delamere, who intended to go\nback to Dublin the following morning save one, joined Lady Clancarryl\nand her brother in the drawing-room immediately after dinner.\n\nGodolphin, on account of the expected return of Fitz-Edward, had\ndetermined to make only a short stay at Lough Carryl. He wished to carry\nwith him to his own house, portraits of his sister and her children; and\nwas expressing to her this wish--'I should like to have them,' said he,\n'in a large miniature; the same size as one I have of Adelina.'\n\n'Have you then a portrait of Adelina,' enquired Lady Clancarryl, 'and\nhave not yet shewn it me?'\n\n'I have,' answered Godolphin; 'but my sister likes not that it should be\nseen. It is very like her _now_, but has little resemblance to her\nformer pictures. This is painted by a young lady, her friend.' He then\ntook it out of his pocket, and gave it to Lady Clancarryl.\n\n'And is Adelina so thin and pale,' asked her Ladyship, 'as she is here\nrepresented?'\n\n'More so,' answered Godolphin.\n\n'She is then greatly changed.--Yet the eyes and features, and the whole\nair of the countenance, I should immediately have acknowledged.'\nContinuing to look pensively at the picture, she added, 'Tis charmingly\ncoloured; and might represent a very lovely and penitent Magdalen. The\nblack veil, and tearful eye, are beautifully touched. But why did you\nindulge her in this melancholy taste?'\n\nGodolphin, excessively hurt at this, speech, answered mournfully--'Poor\nAdelina, you know, has had little reason to be gay.'\n\nDelamere, who during this conversation seemed lost in his own\nreflections, now suddenly advanced, and desired Lady Clancarryl would\nfavour him with a sight of the picture. He took it to a candle; and\nlooking steadily on it, was struck with the lightness of the drawing,\nwhich extremely resembled the portraits Emmeline was accustomed to make;\ntho' this was more highly finished than any he had yet seen of her's.\n\nWithout being able to account for his idea, since nothing was more\nlikely than that the drawing of two persons might resemble each other,\nhe looked at the back of the picture, which was of gold; and in the\ncentre a small oval crystal contained the words _Em. Mowbray_, in hair,\nand under it the name of _Adelina Trelawny_. It was indeed a memorial of\nEmmeline's affection to her friend; and the name was in her own hair;--a\ncircumstance that made it as dear to Godolphin as the likeness it bore\nto his sister: and the whole was rendered in his eyes inestimable, by\nit's being painted by herself. Delamere, astonished and pained he knew\nnot why, determined to hear from Godolphin himself the name of the\npaintress: returning it to him, he said--'A lady, you say, Sir, drew it.\nMay I ask her name?'\n\nGodolphin, now first aware of the indiscretion he had committed, and\nflattering himself that the chrystal had not been inspected, answered\nwith an affectation of pleasantry--'Oh! I believe it is a secret between\nmy sister and her friend which I have no right to reveal; and to tell\nyou the truth I teized Adelina to give me the picture, and obtained it\nonly on condition of not shewing it.'\n\nDelamere, who had so often sworn to forget her, still fancied he had a\nright to be exclusively acquainted with all that related to Emmeline. He\nfelt himself piqued by this evasion, and answered somewhat quickly--'I\nknow the drawing, Sir; it is done by Miss Mowbray.'\n\nGodolphin was then compelled to answer 'that it was.'\n\n'I envy Miss Mowbray her charming talent,' cried Lady Clancarryl. 'Pray\nwho is Miss Mowbray?'\n\n'A relation of Lord Delamere's,' answered Godolphin; 'and a most lovely\nand amiable young woman.'\n\nDelamere, whose varying countenance ill seconded his attempt to appear\nindifferent on this subject, now grew pale, now red.\n\n'Are you acquainted then with Miss Mowbray, Sir?' said he to Godolphin.\n\n'I have seen her,' replied Godolphin, 'with my sister, Lady Adelina\nTrelawny.'\n\nHe then hurried the discourse to some other topic; being unwilling to\nanswer any other questions that related either to his sister or her\nfriend.\n\nBut Delamere, whose wounds bled afresh at the name of Emmeline, and who\ncould not resist enquiring after her of a person who had so lately seen\nher, took the earliest opportunity of seeking Godolphin to renew this\ndiscourse.\n\nThey met therefore the following morning in the breakfast parlour; and\nDelamere suddenly turning the conversation from the topics of the day,\nsaid--'You are, I find, acquainted with Miss Mowbray. You may perhaps\nknow that she is not only a relation of mine, but that I _was_\nparticularly interested in whatever related to her.'\n\nGodolphin, whose heart fluttered so as almost to deprive him of speech,\nanswered very gravely--'I have heard so from Mrs. Stafford.'\n\n'Then you know, perhaps----But you are undoubtedly well acquainted with\nColonel Fitz-Edward?'\n\n'Certainly,' replied Godolphin. 'He was one of my most intimate\nfriends.'\n\n'Then, Sir,' cried Delamere, losing all temper, 'one of your most\nintimate friends is a villain!'\n\nGodolphin, shocked at an expression which gave him reason to apprehend\nLady Adelina's story was known, answered with great emotion--'You will\nbe so good, my Lord, as to explain that assertion; which, whatever may\nbe it's truth, is very extraordinary when made thus abruptly to me.'\n\n'You are a man of honour, Mr. Godolphin, and I will not conceal from you\nthe cruel injuries I have sustained from Fitz-Edward, nor that I wait\nhere only to have an opportunity of telling him that I bear them not\ntamely.' He then related, in terms equally warm and bitter, the supposed\nalienation of Emmeline's affections by the artifices of Fitz-Edward,\nenumerated all the imaginary proofs with which the invidious artifices\nof the Crofts' had furnished him, and concluded by asserting, that he\nhad himself seen, in the arms of Emmeline, a living witness of her ruin,\nand the perfidy of his faithless friend.\n\nTo this detail, including as it did the real history of his sister under\nthe false colours in which the Crofts' had drest it to mislead Delamere\nand destroy Emmeline, Godolphin listened with sensations impossible to\nbe described. He could not hear without horror the character of Emmeline\nthus cruelly blasted; yet her vindication he could not undertake without\nrevealing to a stranger the unhappy story of Lady Adelina, which he had\nwith infinite difficulty concealed even from his own family.\n\nThe fiery and impatient spirit of Delamere blazing forth in menace and\ninvective, gave Godolphin time to collect his thoughts; and he almost\nimmediately determined, whatever it cost him, to clear up the reputation\nof Emmeline.\n\nTho' he saw, that to explain the whole affair must put the character of\nhis sister, which he had been so solicitous to preserve, into the power\nof an inconsiderate young man, yet he thought he might trust to the\nhonour and humanity of Delamere to keep the secret; and however\nmortifying such a measure appeared, his justice as well as his love\nwould not allow him to suffer the innocent Emmeline to remain under an\nimputation which she had incurred only by her generous and disinterested\nattentions to the weakness and misfortunes of another.\n\nBut resolutely as he bore the pain of these reflections, he shrunk from\nothers with which they were mingled: he foresaw, that as soon as the\njealousy of Delamere was by his information removed; his love, which\nseemed to be as passionate as ever, would prompt him to seek a\nreconciliation: his repentance would probably be followed by Emmeline's\nforgiveness and their immediate union.\n\nFarewel then for ever to all the hopes he had nourished since his\nunexpected meeting with Delamere!--Farewel to every expectation of\nhappiness for ever!\n\nBut tho' in relinquishing these delightful visions he relinquished all\nthat gave a value to life, so truly did he love and revere her, that to\nhave the spotless purity of her name sullied even by a doubt seemed an\ninsupportable injustice to himself; and his affection was of a nature\ntoo noble to owe it's success to a misrepresentation injurious to it's\nobject. That the compassion which had saved his sister, should be the\ncause of her having suffered from the malicious malice of the Crofts'\nand the rash jealousy of Delamere, redoubled all his concern; and he was\nso much agitated and hurt, that without farther consideration he was on\nthe point of relating the truth instantly, had not the entry of Lord\nClancarryl for that time put an end to their discourse: from this\nresolution, formed in the integrity of his upright heart, nothing could\nlong divert him; yet he reflected, as soon as he was alone, on the\nviolent and ungovernable passions which seemed to render Delamere,\nunguided by reason and incapable of hearing it. He was apprehensive that\nthe discovery, if made to him at Lough Carryl, might influence him to\nsay or do something that might discover to Lady Clancarryl the unhappy\nstory of her sister; and he thought it better to delay the explanation\n'till he could follow Delamere to Dublin, which he determined to do in a\nfew days after he left Lough Carryl.\n\nThis interval gave him time to feel all the pain of the sacrifice he was\nabout to make. Nor could all his strength of mind, and firmness of\nhonour, prevent his reluctance or cure his anguish.\n\nHe was about to restore to the arms of his rival, the only woman he had\never really loved; and whom he adored with the most ardent passion, at\nthe very moment that his honour compelled him to remove the impediments\nto her marriage with another.\n\nSometimes he thought that he might at least indulge himself in the\nmelancholy pleasure of relating to her in a letter, what he had done, as\nsoon as the explanation should be made: but even this gratification he\nat length determined to refuse himself.\n\n'If she loves Delamere,' said he, 'she will perhaps rejoice in the\neffect and forget the cause. If she has, as I have sometimes dared to\nhope, some friendship and esteem for the less fortunate Godolphin, why\nshould I wound a heart so full of sensibility by relating the conflicts\nof my soul and the passion I have vainly indulged?'\n\nA latent hope, however, almost unknown, at least unacknowledged,\nlingered in his heart. It _was_ possible that Emmeline, resenting the\ninjurious suspicions and rash accusations of Delamere, might refuse to\nfulfil her engagement. But whenever this feeble hope in spite of himself\narose, he remembered her soft and forgiving temper, her strict adherence\nto her word on other occasions, and it faded in a conviction that she\nwould pardon her repentant lover when he threw himself on her mercy; and\nnot evade a promise so solemnly given, which he learned from Delamere\nhimself had never been cancelled.\n\nDelamere now returned to Dublin; and in a few days Godolphin followed\nhim: but on enquiring at his lodgings, he heard that he was gone out of\ntown for some days with some of his friends on a party of pleasure.\nGodolphin left a letter for him desiring to see him immediately on his\nreturn; and then again resigned himself to the painful delight of\nthinking of Emmeline, and to the conscious satisfaction of becoming the\nvindicator and protector of her honour even unknown to herself.\n\nEmmeline, in the mean time, unhappy in the unhappiness of those she\nloved, and by no means flattered by the prospect of dependance thro'\nlife, of which Lord Montreville now made her see all the dreariness and\ndesolation, by the careless and irregular manner in which even her small\nquarterly stipend was remitted to her, yet exerted all her fortitude to\nsupport the spirits of Mrs. Stafford. Calm in the possession of\nconscious innocence, and rich in native integrity and nobleness of\nnature, she was, tho' far from happy herself, enabled to mitigate the\nsorrows of others. Nor was her residence, (otherwise disagreeable and\nforlorn enough,) entirely without it's advantages: it afforded her time\nand opportunity to render herself perfectly mistress of the language of\nthe country; of which she had before only a slight knowledge. To the\nstudy of languages, her mind so successfully applied itself, that she\nvery soon spoke and wrote French with the correctness not only of a\nnative, but of a native well educated.\n\nWhile she thus suffered banishment in consequence of the successful\nintrigues of the Crofts' family, they enjoyed all the advantages of\ntheir prosperous duplicity; at least they enjoyed all the satisfaction\nthat arises from accumulating wealth and an ostentatious display of it.\nSir Richard, by the political knowledge his place afforded him, had been\nenabled (by means of trusty agents) to carry on such successful traffic\nin the stocks, that he now saw himself possessed of wealth greater than\nhis most sanguine hopes had ever presented to his imagination. But as\nhis fortune enlarged, his spirit seemed to contract in regard to every\nthing that did not administer to his pride or his appetite. In the\nluxuries of the table, his house, his gardens, he expended immense sums;\nand the astonished world saw, with envy and indignation, wealth, which\nseemed to be ill-gotten, as profusely squandered: but dead to every\ngenerous and truly liberal sentiment, these expences were confined only\nto himself; and in regard to others he still nourished the sordid\nprejudices and narrow sentiments with which he set out in life--a needy\nadventurer, trusting to cunning and industry for scanty and precarious\nbread. Mr. Crofts, who had received twelve thousand pounds with his\nwife, (whose clandestine marriage had prevented it's being secured in\nsettlement,) used it, as his father directed, in gaming in the stocks,\nwith equal avidity and equal success. Lady Frances, in having married\nbeneath herself, had yet relinquished none of the privileges of high\nbirth: she played deep, dressed in the extremity of expence, and was\ncelebrated for the whimsical splendor of her equipages and the\nbrilliancy of her assemblies. Her husband loved money almost as well as\nthe fame acquired by these fashionable displays of her Ladyship's taste;\nbut on the slightest hint of disapprobation, he was awed into silence by\nher scornful indignation; and with asperity bade to observe, that tho'\nthe daughter of the Marquis of Montreville had so far forgotten her rank\nas to marry the son of Crofts the attorney, she would allow nobody else\nto forget that she was still the daughter of the Marquis of Montreville.\n\nThis right honourable eloquence subdued the plebeian spirit of Crofts;\nwhile he was also compelled to submit patiently, lest Lord Montreville\nshould be offended and withhold the fortune he farther expected to\nreceive. Lady Frances therefore pursued the most extravagant career of\ndissipation unchecked. She was young, handsome and vain; and saw every\nday new occasion to lament having thrown herself away on Crofts: and as\nshe could not now release herself from him, she seemed determined to\nrender him at least a fashionable husband.\n\nMrs. James Crofts trod as nearly as she could in the footsteps of Lady\nFrances; whose name she seemed to take exquisite pleasure in repeating,\ntho' it's illustrious possessor scarce deigned to treat her with common\ncivility; and never on any account admitted her to any thing but her\nmost private parties, with a few dependants and persons who found the\nway to her favour by adulation. Mrs. James Crofts however consoled\nherself for the slights she received from Lady Frances, by parading in\nall inferior companies with the names of her high and illustrious\nrelations: and she employed the same tradespeople; laid out with them as\nmuch money; and paid them better than Lady Frances herself.--\n\nHer chariot and job horses were discarded for a fashionable coach; her\nhouse at Clapham, for an elegant town residence. She tried to hide the\napproaches of age, by rouge; and dress and amusements effectually kept\noff the approaches of thought; her husband, slowly yet certainly was\ncreeping up the hill of preferment; her daughters were certainly growing\nmore beautiful and accomplished than their mother; and Mrs. James Crofts\nfancied she was happy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nIt was now early in May; and in the blooming orchards and extensive\nbeech woods of Normandy, Emmeline found much to admire and something to\nlament.\n\nThe Seine, winding thro' the vale and bringing numberless ships and\nvessels to Rouen, surrounded by hills fringed with forests, the property\nof the crown, and extending even to that of Arques, formed a rich and\nentertaining scene. But however beautiful the outline, the landscape\nstill appeared ill finished: dark and ruinous hovels, inhabited by\npeasants frequently suffering the extremes of poverty; half cultivated\nfields, wanting the variegated enclosures that divide the lands in\nEngland; and trees often reduced to bare poles to supply the inhabitants\nwith fewel, made her recollect with regret the more luxuriant and happy\nfeatures of her native country.\n\nThe earth, however, covered with grass and flowers, offered her minute\nobjects on which she delighted to dwell; but she dared not here wander\nas in England far from home: the women of the villages, who in this\ncountry are robust and masculine, often followed her with abuse for\nbeing English; and yet oftener the villagers clattered after her in\ntheir sabots, and addressed her by the name of _la belle Demoiselle\nAnglaise_, with a rudeness and familiarity that at once alarmed and\ndisgusted her.\n\nThe long avenue of fir and beech which led to the _chateau_, and the\n_parterre_, _potagerie_, and _verger_[2] behind it, were therefore the\nscenes of her morning and evening walks. She felt a pensive pleasure in\nretracing the lonely rambles she used to take at the same season at\nMowbray Castle; and memory bringing before her the events of the two\nyears and an half which had elapsed since she left it, offered nothing\nthat did not renew her regret at having bid it's solitary shades and\nunfrequented rocks adieu!\n\nThe idea of Godolphin still obtruded itself continually on her mind: nor\ncould all her resolution prevent it's obtruding with pleasure, tho' she\nperpetually condemned herself for allowing it to recur to her at all.\nLady Adelina, in her two or three last letters, had not mentioned him\nfarther than to say he was in Ireland; and Emmeline was ashamed of\nsuffering her thoughts to dwell on a man, whose preference of her seemed\nuncertain and perhaps accidental, since he had neither absolutely\ndeclared himself when present or sought to engage her favour when\nabsent; and tho' she was now fully persuaded that of Delamere she should\nhear no more as a lover, yet while her promise remained in his hands\nuncancelled, she fancied herself culpable in indulging a partiality for\nanother.\n\nNor could she reflect on the jealousy which had tortured Delamere, and\nthe pain he must have suffered in tearing her from his heart, without\nmingling with her resentment some degree of pity and sorrow.\n\nShe was one afternoon sitting at an open window of the _chateau_,\nrevolving in her mind these reflections, when raising her eyes at a\nsudden noise, she saw driving along the avenue that led to it, an\nEnglish post chaise and four, preceded by a _valet de chambre_, and\nfollowed by two livery servants.\n\nTo those who are driven by misfortune to seek a melancholy asylum in a\nforeign country, there is an inconceivable delight in beholding whatever\nforcibly brings back to the memory, the comforts and conveniences of\ntheir own: Emmeline, who had for many weeks seen only the boors or the\n_cur\u00c3\u00a9_ of the village, gazed at English servants and English horses\nwith as much avidity as if she beheld such an equipage for the first\ntime.\n\nInstantly however her wonder was converted into pleasure.--Lady\nWesthaven was assisted out of the chaise by a gentleman, whose likeness\nto Godolphin convinced the fluttering heart of Emmeline that it was her\nLord; and eagerly enquiring for Miss Mowbray, she was immediately in her\narms.\n\nAs soon as the joy (in which Mrs. Stafford partook,) of this unexpected\nmeeting had a little subsided, Lady Westhaven related, that hearing by a\nletter they had received at Paris from Mr. Godolphin, that Emmeline was\nwith Mrs. Stafford in or near Rouen, she had entreated Lord Westhaven to\nmake a journey to see her.\n\n'And I assure you Emmeline,' added she, 'I had no great difficulty to\npersuade him. His own curiosity went as far as my inclination; for he\nhas long wished to see this dangerous Emmeline; who began by turning the\nhead of _my_ brother, and now I believe has turned the more sage one of\n_his_--for Godolphin's letters have been filled only with your praises.'\n\nEmmeline, who had changed colour at the beginning of this speech,\nblushed more deeply at it's conclusion. Involuntary pleasure penetrated\nher heart to hear that Godolphin had praised her. But it was immediately\nchecked. Lady Westhaven seemed to know nothing of Delamere's desertion;\nof the history of Lady Adelina she was undoubtedly ignorant. How could\nEmmeline account for one without revealing the other? This reflection\noverwhelmed her with confusion, and she hardly heard the affectionate\nexpressions with which Lady Westhaven testified her satisfaction at\nmeeting her.\n\n'I trust, my Lord,' said her Ladyship, 'that the partiality which I\nforesee you will feel for my fair cousin for her own sake, will not be a\nlittle encreased by our resemblance.--Tell me, do you think us so very\nmuch alike?'\n\n'I never,' answered he, 'saw a stronger family likeness between sisters.\nOur lovely cousin has somewhat the advantage of you in height.'\n\n'And in complexion, my Lord, notwithstanding the improvements I have\nlearned to make to mine in France.'\n\n'_I_ should not,' answered his Lordship smiling, 'have ventured such a\nremark. I was merely going to add that you have the same features as\nMiss Mowbray, with darker hair and eyes; if however our charming\nEmmeline had a form less attractive, I have heard enough of her to be\nconvinced that her understanding and her heart justify all that Lord\nDelamere or Mr. Godolphin have said of her.'\n\nLady Westhaven then expressed her wonder that she had heard nothing of\nDelamere for some months.--'And it is most astonishing to me,' said she\nto Emmeline, 'that the month of March should elapse without _your_\nhearing of him.'\n\nThe distress of Emmeline now redoubled; and became so evident, that Lady\nWesthaven, convinced there was something relative to her brother of\nwhich she was ignorant, desired her to go with her into another room.\n\nIncapable of falsehood, and detesting concealment, yet equally unwilling\nto ruin the reputation of the unhappy Adelina with her brother's wife,\nand having no authority to divulge a secret entrusted to her by her\nfriend, Emmeline now felt the cruellest conflict. All she could\ndetermine was, to tell Lady Westhaven in general terms that Lord\nDelamere had undoubtedly altered his intentions with regard to her, and\nthat the affair was, she believed, entirely and for ever at an end.\n\nHowever anxious her Ladyship was to know from what strange cause such a\nchange of sentiments proceeded, she found Emmeline so extremely hurt\nthat she forbore at present to press the explanation. Full of concern,\nshe was returning to the company, having desired Emmeline to remain and\ncompose herself; when, as she was leaving the room, she said--\n\n'But I forgot, my dear Emmeline, to ask you where you first became\nacquainted with Mr. Godolphin?'\n\nAgain deep blushes dyed the cheeks of the fair orphan; for this question\nled directly to those circumstances she could not relate.\n\n'I knew him,' answered she, faultering as she spoke, 'at Bath.'\n\n'And _is_ he,' enquired Lady Westhaven, 'so _very_ charming as his\nbrother and his family represent him?'\n\n'He is indeed very agreeable,' replied she--'very much so. Extremely\npleasant in his manner, and in his person very like Lord Westhaven.'\n\n'He never told us how he first became acquainted with _you_; and to tell\nyou the truth Emmeline, if I had not thought, indeed known, that you\nwas engaged to Lord Delamere, I should have thought Godolphin your\nlover.'\n\nThis speech did not serve to hasten the composure Emmeline was trying to\nregain. She attempted to laugh it off; but succeeded so ill, that Lady\nWesthaven rejoined her Lord and Mr. and Mrs. Stafford, full of uneasy\nconjectures; and Emmeline, with a still more heavy heart, soon after\nfollowed her.\n\nThe pressing and earnest invitation of Mrs. Stafford, induced her guests\nto promise her their company for some days. But Lady Westhaven was so\nastonished at her brother's desertion of Emmeline, and so desirous of\naccounting for it without finding occasion to impute cruelty and caprice\nto him, or imprudence and levity to Emmeline, that she took the earliest\nopportunity of asking Mrs. Stafford, with whom she knew Miss Mowbray had\nno secrets, to explain to her the cause of an event so contrary to her\nexpectations.\n\nMrs. Stafford had heard from Emmeline the embarrassment into which the\nquestions of Lady Westhaven had thrown her; and with great difficulty at\nlength persuaded her, that she owed it to her own character and her own\npeace to suffer her Ladyship to be acquainted with the truth: that she\ncould run no risk in telling her what, for the sake of her Lord (whose\nhappiness might be disturbed, and whose life hazarded by it's knowledge)\nshe certainly would not reveal. Besides which motives to secresy, the\ngentleness and humanity of Lady Westhaven would, Mrs. Stafford said, be\nalone sufficient to secure Lady Adelina from any possible ill\nconsequences by her being made acquainted with the unhappy story.\n\nThese arguments wrung from Emmeline a reluctant acquiescence: and Mrs.\nStafford related to Lady Westhaven those events which had been followed\nby Delamere's jealousy and their separation.\n\nThe love and regard, which on her first knowledge of Emmeline Lady\nWesthaven had conceived for her, and which her admirable qualities had\never since encreased, was now raised to enthusiasm. She knew not (for\nMrs. Stafford and Emmeline were themselves ignorant) of the artful\nmisrepresentations with which the Crofts' had poisoned the mind of her\nbrother; and was therefore astonished at his suspicions and grieved at\nhis rashness. She immediately proposed writing to him; but this design\nboth her friends besought her for the present to relinquish. Emmeline\nassured her that she had so long considered the affair as totally at an\nend, that she could not now regret it; or if she felt any regret, it was\nmerely in resigning the hope of being received into a family of which\nLady Westhaven was a part. Her Ladyship could not however believe that\nEmmeline was really indifferent to her brother; and accounted for her\npresent coldness by supposing her piqued and offended at his behaviour,\nfor which she had so much reason.\n\nAnxious therefore to reconcile them, she still continued desirous of\nwriting to Delamere. And so much did her affectionate heart dwell on the\nhappiness she should have in re-uniting her brother and her friend, that\nonly the difficulty which there seemed to be in vindicating Emmeline\nwithout injuring Lady Adelina, withheld her; and she promised to delay\nwriting 'till means could be found to clear up the reputation of the one\nwithout ruining that of the other.\n\nLord Westhaven had, during his stay, learnt from Mrs. Stafford the\ncircumstances that had driven her and her family abroad; and had heard\nthem with a sincere wish to alleviate the inconveniences that oppressed\na woman whose manners and conduct convinced him she deserved a better\nfate. Unwilling however to hold out to her hopes that he was not sure he\nshould be able to fulfil, he contented himself with procuring from\nEmmeline general information of the state of their affairs, and silently\nmeditated the noble project of doing good, as soon as it should be in\nhis power.\n\nHer children, for whose sake only she seemed to be willing to support\nwith patience her unfortunate lot, were objects particularly interesting\nto Lord Westhaven; and for the boys he thought he might, on his return\nto England, assist in providing. To their father, consoling himself in\ntrifling follies and dirty intrigues for his misfortunes, it seemed more\ndifficult to be serviceable.\n\nWhile these benevolent purposes engaged his attention, Lady Westhaven\nreflected with regret on her approaching departure, which must divide\nher from Emmeline, whom she seemed now to love with redoubled affection.\nHis Lordship, ever solicitous to gratify her, proposed that Emmeline\nshould go with them into Switzerland with the Baron de St. Alpin, his\nLordship's uncle; who, after a life passed in the service of France, now\nprepared to retire to his native country.\n\nThe Baron had seen his nephew at Paris. He had embraced with transport\nthe son of a beloved sister, and insisted on his and Lady Westhaven's\ngoing back with him to his estate in the Pa\u00c3\u00afs de Vaud, as soon as he\nshould have the happiness of being rejoined by his only son, the\nChevalier de Bellozane, who was expected with his regiment from\nMartinique. Lord Westhaven, on his first visit to the paternal house of\nhis mother, had found there only one of her sisters, who, with the\nBaron, were the last survivors of a numerous family. He could not\ntherefore resist his uncle's earnest entreaties to accompany him back;\nand Lady Westhaven, who was charmed with the manners of the respectable\nveteran and interested by his affection for her Lord, readily consented\nto delay her return to England for three months and to cross France once\nmore to attend him.\n\nTo have Emmeline her companion in such a journey seemed to offer all\nthat could render it charming. But how could she ask her to quit Mrs.\nStafford, to whom she had been so much obliged; and who, in her present\nmelancholy solitude, seemed more than ever to need her consolatory\nfriendship.\n\nHer Ladyship however ventured to mention it to Emmeline; who answered,\nthat tho' nothing in the world would give her more pleasure than being\nwith such friends, she could not, without a breach of duty which it was\nimpossible to think of, quit Mrs. Stafford, to whom she was bound by\ngratitude as well as by affection.\n\nLord Westhaven acquiesced in the justice of this objection, but\nundertook to remove it by rendering the situation of her friend such as\nwould make a short absence on both sides more supportable.\n\nHe therefore in his next conversation with Stafford represented the\ninconvenience of a house so far from a town, and how much better his\nfamily would be situated nearer the metropolis. He concluded by offering\nhim a house he had himself hired at St. Germains; which he said he\nshould be obliged to Mrs. Stafford and her family if they would occupy\n'till his return from Switzerland. And that no objection might arise as\nto expence, he added, that considering himself as Miss Mowbray's banker,\nhe had furnished her with five hundred pounds, with which she was\ndesirous of repaying some part of the many obligations she owed Mr. and\nMrs. Stafford.\n\nMrs. Stafford, who saw immediately all the advantages that might arise\nto Emmeline from her residence with Lady Westhaven, had on the slightest\nhint been warmly an advocate for her going. However reluctant to part\nwith her, she suffered not her own gratifications to impede the interest\nof her fair charge. But she could not prevail on Emmeline to yield to\nher entreaties, 'till Lord Westhaven having settled every thing for the\nremoval of the family to St. Germains, she was convinced that Mrs.\nStafford would be in a pleasant and advantageous situation; and that she\nought, even for the sake of her and her children, whom Lord Westhaven\nhad so much the power of serving, to yield to an arrangement which would\nso much oblige him.\n\nThe _chateau_ they inhabited was ready furnished; their cloaths were\neasily removed; and the Staffords and their children set out at the same\ntime with Lord Westhaven, his wife, and Emmeline; who having seen them\nsettled at St. Germains greatly to the satisfaction of Mrs. Stafford,\nwent on to Paris; where, in about a week, they were joined by the Baron\nde St. Alpin, and the Chevalier de Bellozane.\n\n[Footnote 2: Flower garden, kitchen garden, and orchard.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nThe Baron de St. Alpin was a venerable soldier, near sixty, in whom the\nnatural roughness of his country was polished by a long residence among\nthe French. He was extremely good humoured and chearful, and\npassionately fond of the Chevalier de Bellozane, who was the youngest of\nthree sons, the two elder of whom had fallen in the field. The military\nardour however of the Baron had not been buried with them; and he still\nentrusted the sole survivor of his house, and the last support of his\nhopes, in the same service.\n\nWith infinite satisfaction he embraced this beloved son on his return\nfrom Martinique, and with exultation presented him to his nephew, to\nLady Westhaven, and Miss Mowbray. The Baron was indeed persuaded that he\nwas the most accomplished young man in France, and had no notion that\nevery body did not behold him with the same eyes.\n\nBellozane was tall, well made, and handsome; his face, and yet more, his\nfigure, bore some resemblance to the Godolphin family; his manners were\nelegant, his air military, his vivacity excessive, and he was something\nof a coxcomb, but not more than is thought becoming to men of his\nprofession in France at two and twenty.\n\nHaving lived always in the army or in fashionable circles at Paris, he\nhad conceived no advantageous ideas of his own country, where he had not\nbeen since his childhood. His father now retiring thither himself, had\nobtained a long leave of absence for him that he might go also; but\nBellozane would willingly have dispensed with the journey, which the\nBaron pressed with so much vehemence, that he had hardly time to\nmodernize his appearance after his American campaigns; a point which was\nto him of serious importance.\n\nHe had therefore with reluctance looked forward to their journey over\nthe Alps. But as soon as his father (who had met him at Port L'Orient on\nhis landing) introduced him at Paris to his English relations and to\nEmmeline, the journey seemed not only to have lost it's horrors, but to\nbecome a delightful party of pleasure, and he was happy to make the\nfourth in the post-coach in which Lady Westhaven, Emmeline, and her\nLadyship's woman, travelled; Lord Westhaven and the Baron following in a\npost-chaise.\n\nNothing could exceed the happiness of the Baron, nor the gaiety of his\nson. Lord Westhaven and his wife, tho' they talked about it less, were\nnot less pleased with their friends and their expedition; while Emmeline\nappeared restored to her former chearfulness, because she saw that they\nwished to see her chearful: but whenever she was a moment alone,\ninvoluntary sighs fled towards England; and when she remembered how far\nshe must be from Lady Adelina, from little William, in short, from\nGodolphin, how could she help thinking of them with concern.\n\nDuring the day, however, the Chevalier gave her no time for reflection.\nHe waited on her with the most assiduous attention, watched her looks to\nprevent her slightest wishes, talked to her incessantly, besought her to\nteach him English, and told her all he had seen in his travels, and much\nthat he had done. A Frenchman talks without hesitation of himself, and\nthe Chevalier was quite a Frenchman.\n\nToo polite however for exclusive adulation, Lady Westhaven shared all\nhis flattery; and her real character being now unrepressed by the\nseverity of her mother, she, all gaiety and good humour, was extremely\namused with the extravagant gallantry of the Chevalier and at\nEmmeline's amazement, who having been little used to the manners of the\nFrench, was sometimes alarmed and sometimes vexed at the warmth of his\naddress and the admiration which he professed towards them both.\n\nLady Westhaven assured her that such conversation was so usual that\nnobody ever thought of being offended at it; and that Bellozane was\nprobably so much used to apply the figures of speech, which she thought\nso extraordinary, to every woman he saw, that he perhaps knew not\nhimself, and certainly never thought of, what he was saying.\n\nEmmeline therefore heard from him repeatedly what would from an\nEnglishman have been considered as an absolute declaration of love,\nwithout any other answer than seeming inattention, and flying as soon as\npossible to some other topic.\n\nIn the progress of their journey these common place speeches and this\ndesultory gallantry was gradually exchanged for a deportment more\nrespectful. He besought Emmeline very seriously to give him an\nopportunity of speaking to her apart; which she with the utmost\ndifficulty evaded. His extreme gaiety forsook him--the poor Chevalier\nwas in love.\n\nIt was in vain he communicated his malady to _la belle cousine_, (as he\nusually called Lady Westhaven); _la belle cousine_ only laughed at him,\nand told him he had according to his own account been so often in love,\nthat this additional _penchant_ could not possibly hurt him, and would\nmerely serve to prevent what he owned he had so much dreaded, being\n'_ennuy\u00c3\u00a9 a la mort_' at St. Alpin.\n\nWhen he found the inexorable Lady Westhaven refused seriously to attend\nto him, he applied with new ardour to Emmeline herself; to whom his\nimportunity began to be distressing, as she foresaw in his addresses\nonly a repetition of the persecution she had suffered from the fiery and\nimpetuous Delamere. Still, however, she was often obliged to hear him.\nShe could hear him only with coldness; which he was far from taking as\ndiscouragement. As she did not love to think _herself engaged_, she\ncould not use that plea, or even name an engagement which she believed\nmight now never be claimed by _him_ to whom it was given. All therefore\nshe could say was, that she had no thoughts of marrying. An answer,\nwhich however frequently repeated, Bellozane determined to think\nfavourable; and Emmeline knew not how to treat with peremptory rudeness\nthe cousin of Lord Westhaven and of Captain Godolphin.\n\nBut whatever diminution of her ease and tranquillity she might suffer or\napprehend from the growing attachment of this young man, the journey was\nattended with so many pleasant circumstances, that all parties were\ndesirous that it might be lengthened.\n\nThe extreme eagerness with which the Baron de St. Alpin had wished to\nrevisit his estate, gave way to the pleasures he found in travelling in\nsuch society; and as Lady Westhaven had never been farther South than\nLyons, and Emmeline had never seen the Southern Provinces at all, it was\ndetermined on their arrival at that city to proceed to the shore of the\nMediterranean before they went into Switzerland.\n\nIt was the finest season of the year and the loveliest weather\nimaginable. The party consulted therefore only pleasure on their way.\nSometimes they went no more than a single stage in a day, and employed\nthe rest in viewing any place in it's neighbourhood worth their\ncuriosity. They often left their carriages to walk, to saunter, to dine\non the grass on provisions they had brought with them; and whenever a\nbeautiful view or uncommon scene presented themselves, they stopped to\nadmire them; and Bellozane drew sketches, which were put into Emmeline's\n_port feuille_.\n\nAs they were travelling between Marseilles and Toulon they entered a\nroad bounded on each side by mountainous rocks, which sometimes\nreceding, left between them small but richly cultivated vallies; and in\nother parts so nearly met each other, as to leave little more room than\nsufficed for the carriage to pass; while the turnings of the road were\nso angular and abrupt, that it seemed every moment to be carrying them\ninto the bosom of the rock. Thro' this defile, as it was quite shady,\nthey agreed to walk.\n\nIn some places huge masses impended over them, of varied form and\ncolour, without any vegetation but scattered mosses; in others, aromatic\nplants and low shrubs; the lavender, the thyme, the rosemary, the\nmountain sage, fringed the steep craggs, while a neighbouring aclivity\nwas shaded with the taller growth of holly, phillyrea, and ever-green\noak; and the next covered with the glowing purple of the Mediterranean\nheath. The summits of almost all, crowned with groves of fir, larch, and\npine.\n\nEmmeline in silent admiration beheld this beautiful and singular scene;\nand with the pleasure it gave her, a soft and melancholy sensation was\nmingled. She wanted to be alone in this delightful place, or with some\none who could share, who could understand the satisfaction she felt.\nShe knew nobody but Godolphin who had taste and enthusiasm enough to\nenjoy it.\n\nInsensibly she left Lady Westhaven and the Chevalier behind her; and\npassing his Lordship and the Baron, who were deeply engaged in a\ndiscourse about the military operations of the past war, she walked on\nwith some quickness. Intent on the romantic wildness of the cliffs with\nwhich she was surrounded, and her mind associating with these objects\nthe idea of him on whom it now perpetually dwelt, she had brought\nGodolphin before her, and was imagining what he would have said had he\nbeen with her; with what warmth he would enjoy, with what taste and\nspirit point out, the beauty of scenes so enchanting!\n\nShe had now left her companions at some distance; yet as she heard their\nvoices swell in the breeze along the defile, she felt no apprehension.\nIn the narrowest part of it, where she saw only steep craggs and the\nsky, which their bending tops hardly admitted, she was stopped by a\ntransparent stream, which bursting suddenly with some violence out of\nthe rock, is received into a small reservoir of stone and then carried\naway in stone channels to a village at some distance.\n\nWhile Emmeline stood contemplating this beautiful spring, she beheld, in\nan excavation in the rock close to it, two persons sitting on a bench,\nwhich had been rudely cut for the passenger to rest. One of them\nappeared to be a man about fifty; he wore a short, light coloured coat,\na waistcoat that had once been of embroidered velvet; from his head,\nwhich was covered first with a red thrum night-cap, and then with a\nsmall hat, bound with tarnished lace, depended an immense _que\u00c3\u00bce_; his\nface, tho' thin and of a mahogena darkness, seemed to express\npenetration and good humour; and Emmeline, who had at first been a\nlittle startled, was no longer under alarm; when he, on perceiving her\nnear the entrance of the cavern, flew nimbly out of it, bowed to the\nground, and pulling off most politely his thrum night-cap,\nenquired--'_Si Mademoiselle voudrez bien se reposer?_'[3]\n\nEmmeline thanked him, and advanced towards the bench; from which a girl\nabout seventeen, very brown but very pretty, had on her approach arisen,\nand put up into a kind of wallet the remains of the provisions they had\nbeen eating, which were only fruit and black bread. As soon as the old\nFrenchman perceived that Emmeline intended to sit down, he sprung\nbefore her, brushed down the seat with his cap, and then making several\nprofound bows, assured '_Mademoiselle qu'elle pourroit s'asseoir sans\nincommodit\u00c3\u00a9_.'[4]\n\nThe young woman, dressed like the _paisannes_ of the country, was\nmodestly retiring; but Emmeline desired her to remain; and entering into\nconversation with her, found she was the daughter of the assiduous old\nFrenchman, and that he was going with her to Toulon in hopes of\nprocuring her a service.\n\nThe Baron and Lord Westhaven now approached, and laughingly reproached\nEmmeline for having deserted them. She told them she was enchanted with\nthe seat she had found, and should wait there for the Chevalier and Lady\nWesthaven.\n\n'I am only grieved,' said she, 'that I have disturbed from their humble\nsupper these good people.'\n\nThe two gentlemen then spoke to the old Frenchman; whose countenance had\nsomething of keen intelligence and humble civility which prejudiced both\nin his favour.\n\n'_Je vois bien_,' said he, addressing himself to Lord Westhaven,--'_je\nvois bien que j'ai l'honneur de parler a un Milor Anglais_.'[5]\n\n'_Eh! comment?_' answered his Lordship--'_comment? tu connois donc bien\nles Anglais?_'[6]\n\n'_Oh oui!--j'ai pass\u00c3\u00a9 a leur service une partie de ma jeunesse.--Ils\nsont les meilleur maitres_--'[7]\n\n'_Parle tu Anglais, mon ami?_'[8]\n\n'Yes Milor, I speak little English. _Mais_,' continued he, relapsing\ninto the volubility of his own language--'_Mais il y'a \u00c3\u00a0 peu pres dix\nneuf ans, depuis que mon maitre--mon pauvre maitre mouroit dans mes\nbras; helas!--s'i avoit vecu--car il etoit tout jeun--j'aurois pass\u00c3\u00a9 ma\nvie entiere avec lui--j'aurois retournez avec lui en Angleterre--Ah\nc'est un pa\u00c3\u00afs charmant que cette Angleterre._'[9]\n\n'You have been there then?'\n\nHe answered that he had been three times; and should have been happy had\nit pleased heaven to have ended his days there.\n\n'The praise you bestow on our country, my friend,' said Lord Westhaven,\n'is worth at least this piece _de six francs_, and the beauty _de cette\njolie enfant_,[10] added he, turning towards the little _paisanne_, 'is\ninteresting enough to induce me to enquire whether such a gift may not\nserve to purchase _quelques petites amplettes a la ville_.'[11] He\npresented the young woman with another crown.\n\nThe old Frenchman seemed ready to thank his Lordship with his tears.\n\nWithout solicitation or ceremony, seeing that the gentlemen were\ndisposed to listen to him, he began to relate his 'short and simple'\nstory.\n\nLady Westhaven and the Chevalier now arrived: but she sat down by\nEmmeline, and desired the old man to continue whatever he was saying.\n\n'He has been praising our country,' said Lord Westhaven, 'and in return\nI am willing to hear the history of himself, which he seems very\ndesirous of relating.'\n\n'I was in the army,' said he, 'as we all are; till being taken with a\npleurisy at Calais, and rendered long incapable of duty, I got my\ndischarge, and hired myself as a travelling valet to a _Milor Anglais_.\nWith him (he was the best master in the world) I lived six years. I went\nwith him to England when he came to his estate, and five years\nafterwards came back with him to France. He met with a misfortune in\nlosing _une dame tres amiable_, and never was quite well afterwards. To\ndrive away trouble, _pour se dissiper_, he went among a set of his own\ncountrymen, and I believe _le chagrin_, and living too freely, gave him\na terrible fever. _Une fievre ardente lui saisit a Milan, ses compagnons\napparemment n'aimoit gueres les malades_;[12] for nobody came near him\nexcept a young surgeon who arrived there by accident, and hearing that\nan Englishman of fashion lay ill, charitably visited him. But it was too\nlate: he had already been eleven days under the hands of an Italian\nphysician, and when the English gentleman saw him he said he had only a\nfew hours to live.\n\n'He sat by him, however. But my poor master was senseless; 'till about\nan hour before he died he recovered his recollection.\n\n'He ordered me to bring him two little boxes, which he always carried\nwith him, and charged me to go to England with his body, and deliver\nthose boxes to a person he named. He bade me give one of his watches,\nwhich was a very rich one, to his brother, and told _me_ to keep the\nother in memory of my master.\n\n'Then he spoke to the stranger--\"Sir,\" said he, \"since you have the\nhumanity to interest yourself for a person unknown to you, have the\ngoodness to see that my servant is suffered to execute what I have\ndirected, and put your seal on my effects. The money I have about me, my\ncloaths, and my common watch, I have given him. He knows what farther I\nwould have done; I told him on the second day of my illness.\nBaptist--you remember----\"\n\n'He tried to say something more; but in a few moments he died in my\narms.\n\n'With the assistance of the young English surgeon, I arranged every\nthing as my master directed. I went with his corps to England, and\nreceived a large present from his brother, whom, however, I did not see,\nbecause he was not in London. Then I returned to France.'\n\n'Since you loved England so much,' enquired the Baron, '_puisque vous\naimiez tant cet pa\u00c3\u00afs pourquoi ne pas y' rester?_'[13]\n\n'_Ah, Monsieur! j'etois riche; et je brulez de partager mes richesse\navec une jolie fille dont j'etois eperdument amoureux._'[14]\n\n'_Eh bien?_'\n\n'I married her, Monsieur; and for above two years we were the happiest\npeople on earth. But we were very thoughtless. _Je ne scais comment cela\nse faisoit, mes espece Anglais, qui je croyais inepuisable se\ndissiperent peu a peu, et enfin il falloit songer a quelque provision\npour ma femme et mes deux petites filles._'[15]\n\n'I returned therefore into the Limosin, of which province I was a\nnative; but some of my family were dead, and the rest had neither power\nor inclination to assist their poor relations. The seigneur of the\nvillage had bought a post at Paris, and was about to quit his chateau.\nHe heard I was honest; and therefore, tho' he had very little to lose,\nhe put me into it. I worked in the garden, and raised enough, with the\nlittle wages we had, to keep us. My wife learned to work, and my two\nlittle girls were healthy and happy.\n\n'_Oui Messieurs, nous etions pauvre a la verit\u00c3\u00a9! mais nous etions tres\ncontents!_[16] 'till about eight months ago; and then an epidemical\ndistemper broke out in the village, and carried off my wife and my\neldest daughter.\n\n'_Oh, Therese! et toi ma petite Suzette, je te pleurs; encore amerement\nje te pleurs._'[17]\n\nThe poor Frenchman turned away and wept bitterly.\n\n'_Je scais bien_,' continued he--'_je scais bien qu'il faut s'accoutumer\na les souffrances!_[18] We might still have lived on, Madelon and me, at\nour ruinous chateau; but the possessor of it dying, his son sent us\nnotice that he should pull it down (indeed it must soon have fallen) and\nordered us to quit it.\n\n'_Ainsi me voila, Messieurs, a cinquante ans, sans pain. Mais pour cela\nje ne m'embarrasse pas; si je pourrois bien placer ma pauvre Madelon\ntout ira bien!_'[19]\n\nThere was in this relation a touching simplicity which drew tears from\nLady Westhaven and Emmeline. The whole party became interested for the\nfather and the daughter, who had wept silently while he was relating\ntheir story.\n\n'Can nothing be done for these poor creatures?' said Lady Westhaven.\n\n'Certainly we will assist them,' answered her Lord.--'But let us enquire\nhow we can best do it. _Tu t'appelles?_'[20] continued he, speaking to\nthe Frenchman.\n\n'_Baptiste La Fere--mais mon nomme de guerre, et de condition fut\ntoujours Le Limosin._'[21]\n\n'_Dites moi donc_,[22] Monsieur Le Limosin,' said his Lordship, 'what\nhopes have you of placing your daughter at Toulon?'\n\n'Alas! Milor, but little. I know nobody there but an old relation of my\npoor wife's, who is _Touriere_ at a convent; and if I cannot get a\nservice for Madelon, I must give the good abbess a little money to take\nher till I can do something better for her.'\n\n'And where do you expect to get money?'\n\n'_Tenez, mon Seigneur_,' answered he, pulling a watch out of his pocket,\n'_ayez la bont\u00c3\u00a9 d'examiner cet montre_.[23] It is an English watch. Gold;\nand in a gold case. I have been offered a great deal of money for it;\nbut in all my poverty, in all my distresses, I have contrived to keep it\nbecause it was the last gift of my dear master. But now, my poor Madelon\nmust be thought of, and if it must be so, I will sell it and pay for her\nstaying in the convent.'\n\n'You shall not do that, my friend,' replied Lord Westhaven, still\nholding the watch in his hand.\n\nIt had a cypher, H. C. M. and a crest engraved on it.\n\n'H. C. M,' said his Lordship, 'and the Mowbray crest! Pray what was your\nmaster's name?'\n\n'_Milor Moubray_,' answered Le Limosin.\n\n'_Comment? Milor Mowbray?_'\n\n'_Oui Milor--regardez s'il vous plait. Voila son chiffre, Henri-Charles\nMoubray--et voila le cimier du famille._'[24]\n\nEmmeline, who no longer doubted but this was her father's servant, was\nso much affected, that Lady Westhaven, apprehending she would faint,\ncalled for assistance; and the Chevalier, who during this conversation\nhad attended only to her, snatched up the beechen cup out of which Le\nLimosin and Madelon had been drinking, and which still stood on the\nground, and flying with it to the spring, brought it instantly back\nfilled with water; while Lady Westhaven bathed her temples and held to\nher her salts. She soon recovered; and then speaking in a faint voice to\nhis Lordship, said--'My Lord, this is the servant in whose arms my poor\nfather expired. Do allow me to intercede with your Lordship for him and\nfor his daughter; but let him not know, to-night at least, who I am. I\ncannot again bear a circumstantial detail about my father.'\n\nLord Westhaven now led Le Limosin out of the cave; told him he had\ndetermined, as he had known his master's family, to take him into his\nown service, and that Lady Westhaven would provide for his daughter. At\nthis intelligence the poor fellow grew almost frantic. He would have\nthrown himself at the feet of his benefactor had he not been prevented;\nthen flew back to fetch his Madelon, that she might join in prayers and\nbenedictions; and hardly could Lord Westhaven persuade him to be\ntranquil enough to understand the orders he gave him, which were, to\nhire some kind of conveyance at the next village to carry his daughter\nto Toulon; where he gave him a direction to find his English benefactor\nthe next day.\n\nIt was now late; and the party hastened to leave this romantic spot,\nwhich had been marked by so singular a meeting. On their arrival at\nToulon, they equipped, and sent away before them to St. Alpin, Le\nLimosin and Madelon, the latter of whom Lady Westhaven took entirely to\nwait on Emmeline.\n\nThe soft heart and tender spirits of Emmeline had not yet recovered the\ndetail she had heard of her father's death. A pensive melancholy hung\nover her; which the Chevalier, nothing doubting his own perfections,\nhoped was owing to a growing affection for himself. But it had several\nsources of which he had no suspicion; and it made the remaining three\nweeks of their tour appear tedious to Emmeline; who languished to be at\nSt. Alpin, where she hoped to find letters from Mrs. Stafford and from\nLady Adelina. She thought it an age since she had heard from the latter;\nand secretly but anxiously indulged an hope of meeting a large pacquet,\nwhich might contain some intelligence of Godolphin.\n\n[Footnote 3: If the young lady would please to sit down.]\n\n[Footnote 4: That she might sit down without inconvenience.]\n\n[Footnote 5: I perceive I have the honour to speak to an English\nnobleman.]\n\n[Footnote 6: How? are you then well acquainted with the English?]\n\n[Footnote 7: I passed part of my youth in their service.----They are\nthe best masters in the world.]\n\n[Footnote 8: Do you speak English, my friend?]\n\n[Footnote 9: It is almost nineteen years, since my master--my poor\nmaster, died in my arms; had he lived, for he was quite a young man, I\nshould have passed my life with him--I should have returned with him to\nEngland--Ah! that England is a charming country!]\n\n[Footnote 10: Of this pretty maid.]\n\n[Footnote 11: Some little necessaries, bargains, at the neighbouring\ntown.]\n\n[Footnote 12: A burning fever seized him at Milan; his companions seemed\nto have but little affection for the sick.]\n\n[Footnote 13: Why not stay there?]\n\n[Footnote 14: Ah, Sir!

The only constant resident in it for some years had\nbeen the Demoiselle de St. Alpin, now about five and forty; whose whole\nattention had been given to keeping it in order, and collecting, in the\ngarden, variety of plants, in which she took singular pleasure. Detached\nfrom the world, and with no other relations than her brother and her\nnephews, whom she was seldom likely to see, she found in this innocent\nand amusing pursuit a resource against the tedium of life. Her manners,\ntho' simple, were mild and engaging; and her heart perfectly good and\nbenevolent. With her, therefore, Emmeline was extremely pleased; and the\ncountry in which her residence was situated, was so beautiful, that\naccustomed to form her ideas of magnificent scenery from the first\nimpressions that her mind had received in Wales, Emmeline acknowledged\nthat her eye was here perfectly satisfied.\n\nWith her heart it was far otherwise. On her arrival at St. Alpin, she\nfound letters from Lady Adelina enclosed in others from Mrs. Stafford.\nLady Adelina gave such an account of her own health as convinced\nEmmeline it was not improved since she left England. Of Mr. Godolphin\nshe only said, that he was returned from Ireland, but had staid with her\nonly a few hours, and was then obliged to go on business to London,\nwhere his continuance was uncertain.\n\nMrs. Stafford gave of herself and her family a more pleasing account.\nShe said she had hopes that the readjustment of Mr. Stafford's affairs\nwould soon allow of their return to England; and as it might possibly\nhappen on very short notice, and before Emmeline could rejoin them, she\nhad sent, by a family who were travelling to Geneva, and who readily\nundertook the care of it, a large box which contained some of her\ncloaths and the caskets which belonged to her, which had been long left\nat Mrs. Ashwood's after Emmeline's precipitate departure from her house\nwith Delamere, and which, on Mrs. Ashwood's marriage and removal, she\nhad sent with a cold note (addressed to Miss Mowbray) to the person who\nnegociated Mr. Stafford's business in London.\n\nTheir lengthened journey had so much broken in on the time allotted to\ntheir tour, that Lord and Lady Westhaven purposed staying only a month\nat St. Alpin. The Baron, who had equal pride and pleasure in the company\nof his nephew, endeavoured by every means in his power to make that time\npass agreeably; and felt great satisfaction in shewing to the few\nneighbours who were within fifteen miles of his _chateau_, that he had,\nin an English nobleman of such rank and merit, so near a relation.\n\nHe had observed very early the growing passion of his son for Miss\nMowbray. He was assured that she returned it; for he never supposed it\npossible that any woman could behold the Chevalier with indifference.\n\nHe had heard from Lord Westhaven that Emmeline was the daughter of a man\nof fashion, but was by the circumstances of her birth excluded from any\nshare of his fortune, and entirely dependant on the favour of the\nMarquis of Montreville. The old Baron, charmed himself with her person\nand her manners, rather approved than opposed the wishes of his son; and\nhowever convenient it might have been to have seen him married to a\nwoman of fortune, he was disposed to rejoice at his inclining to marry\nat all; and convinced that with Emmeline he must be happy, thought he\nmight dispense with being rich. The Chevalier, confident of success, and\nbelieving that Emmeline had meant by her timid refusals only\nencouragement, grew so extremely importunate, that she was sometimes on\nthe point of declaring to him her real situation.\n\nBut from this she was deterred by the apprehension that he would apply\nto Lord Delamere for the relinquishment of her promise; and should he\nobtain it, consider himself as having a claim to the hand his Lordship\nresigned.\n\nThis was an hope, which whatever his vanity might have suggested, she\nnever meant to give him; yet she had the mortification to find that all\nher rejections, however repeated, were considered by the Chevalier as\nwords of course. It was in vain she assured him that besides her\ndisinclination to change her situation by marriage at all, she had other\nforcible objections; that she should never think of passing her life\nout of England; that not only their country, but their manners, their\nideas on a thousand subjects, so materially differed, as to make every\nother reason of her refusal unnecessary.\n\nWhen she seriously urged thus much, he usually answered that he would\nthen reside in England; that he would accommodate his manner of living\nto her pleasure; and that as to the ideas which had displeased her, he\nwould never again offend her with their repetition.\n\nEmmeline had indeed been extremely hurt and disgusted at that levity of\nprinciple on the most serious subjects which the Chevalier avowed\nwithout reserve, and for which he appeared to value himself. Tho'\nbrought up a Calvinist, he had as he owned always conformed to the mode\nof worship and ceremonies of the Catholics while he was among them; and\nusually added, that had he served amid the Turks or the Jews, he should\nhave done the same, as a matter of great indifference.\n\nThe Baron, whose life had been more active than contemplative, was\nunaccustomed to consider these matters deeply. And as every thing\nBellozane advanced had with him great authority, he was struck with his\nlively arguments; and whatever might be their solidity, could not help\nadmiring the wit of the Chevalier, whom he sometimes encouraged to\ndispute with Lord Westhaven. The religion of Lord Westhaven was as\nsteady and unaffected as his morals were excellent; and he entered\nwillingly into these dialogues with Bellozane, in hopes of convincing\nhim that infidelity was by no means necessary to the character of a\nsoldier; and that _he_ was unlikely to serve well the country to which\nhe belonged, or for which he fought, who began by insulting his God.\n\nHe found however that the young man had imbibed these lessons so early,\nand fancied them so much the marks of a superior and penetrating mind,\nthat he could make no impression by rational argument. Bellozane usually\nanswered by a sprightly quotation from some French author, and his\nLordship soon declined the conversation, believing that if sickness and\nsorrow did not supercede so slow a cure, time at least would convince\nhim of his folly.\n\nBut such was the effect of this sort of discourse on Emmeline, that had\nBellozane been in other respects unexceptionable, and had her heart been\nfree from any other impression, she would never have listened to him as\na lover.\n\nFrom his own account of himself in other respects, Emmeline had gathered\nenough to believe that he was profligate and immoral. But as she could\nnot appear to detect these errors without allowing him to suppose her\ninterested in his forsaking them, she generally heard him in silence;\nand only when pressed to name her objections stated his loose opinions\nas one in her mind very material.\n\nTo this he again repeated, that his opinions he would correct; his\nresidence should be settled by herself.--'Had she any objection to his\nperson?' enquired he, as he proudly surveyed it in the long old\nfashioned glass which ornamented the _sal a manger_.[25]\n\nEmmeline, blushing from the conscious recollection of the resemblance it\nbore in height and air to that of Godolphin, answered faulteringly--'That\nto his person there could be no objection.'\n\n'To his fortune?'\n\n'It was undoubtedly more than situated as she was she could expect.'\n\n'To his family?'\n\n'It was a family whose alliance must confer honour.'\n\n'What then?' vehemently continued the Chevalier--'what then, charming\nEmmeline, occasions this long reserve, this barbarous coldness? Since\nyou can form no decided objection; since you have undoubtedly allowed me\nto hope; why do you thus cruelly prolong my sufferings? Surely you do\nnot, you cannot mean finally to refuse and desert me, after having\npermitted me so long to speak to you of my passion?'\n\n'It is with some justice,' gravely and coldly answered Emmeline--'I own\nit is with some justice that you impute to me the appearance of\ncoquetry; because I have listened with too much patience, (tho'\ncertainly never with approbation,) to your discourse on this subject.\nBut be assured that whatever I have said, tho' perhaps with insufficient\nfirmness, I now repeat, in the hope that you will understand it as my\nunalterable resolution--The honour you are so obliging as to offer me, I\n_never_ can accept; and I beg you will forbear to urge me farther on a\nsubject to which I never can give any other answer.'\n\nThis dialogue, which happened on the second day of her residence at St.\nAlpin, and the first moment he could find her alone, did not seem to\ndiscourage the Chevalier. He observed her narrowly: the country round\nSt. Alpin, which, as well as the place itself, he thought '_triste et\ninsupportable_,' seemed to delight and attract her. He saw her not only\nenduring but even fond of his aunt and her plants, which were to him,\n'_les sujets du monde les plus facheux_.'[26]--His excessive vanity made\nhim persist in believing that she could not admire such a place but\nthro' some latent partiality to it's master; nor seek the company and\nesteem of his aunt, but for the sake of her nephew.\n\nThese remarks, and a conviction formed on his own self-love and on the\nexperience of his Parisian conquests, made him disregard her refusal and\npersecute her incessantly with his love. Lord Westhaven saw her\nuneasiness; but knew not how to relieve her without offending the Baron\nand the Chevalier, or divulging circumstances of which he did not think\nhimself at liberty without her permission to speak.\n\nLady Westhaven, to whom Emmeline was obliged to complain of the\nimportunity of Bellozane, repeatedly but very fruitlessly remonstrated\nwith him. What she had at first ridiculed, now gave her pain; and\nanxious as she was to reconcile her brother to her friend, from whom she\nthought only his warmth of temper and a misunderstanding had divided\nhim, she wished to shorten as much as possible their stay at St. Alpin.\n\nHer own situation too made her very anxious to return to England; and\nshe was impatient to see Lord Delamere, to explain to him all the\nmystery of Emmeline's conduct; a detail which she could not venture by\nthe post, tho' she had written to him from Lyons, intreating him to\nsuspend all opinion in regard to Miss Mowbray's conduct 'till she should\nsee him.\n\nThis letter never reached the hands of Lord Delamere, and therefore was\nnot answered to St. Alpin; whither his sister had desired him to direct,\nand where she now grew very uneasy at not hearing from him.\n\nLe Limosin and his Madelon had arrived at St. Alpin some time before\ntheir noble patrons, with whose goodness they were elated to excess. Le\nLimosin himself, assiduous to do every thing for every body, flew about\nas if he was but twenty. His particular province was to attend with Lady\nWesthaven's English servant on her Ladyship and Miss Mowbray; and\nMadelon was directed to wait on the latter as her _fille de chambre_.\n\nEmmeline, with painful solicitude for which she could hardly account,\nwished to hear from Le Limosin those particulars of her father of which\nhe was so well able to inform her. He had served, too, her mother; whose\nname she had hardly ever heard repeated, and of whom, before witnesses,\nshe dared not enquire.\n\nLord Westhaven had not yet explained to him to what he principally owed\nthe extraordinary kindness he had met with. He knew not that the lady on\nwhom he had the honour to wait was the daughter of that master to whom\nhe had been so much obliged.\n\nThe first days that Lord and Lady Westhaven and Emmeline had passed with\nthe Baron, had been engaged by company or in parties which he made to\nshew the views of the surrounding country to his English guests. The\nChevalier never suffered Emmeline to be absent from these excursions,\nnor when at home allowed her to be a moment out of his company. If she\nsought refuge in the chamber of Mrs. St. Alpin, he followed her; if she\nwent with her to her plants, thither also came Bellozane; and having\nacquired from his aunt's books a few physical and botanical terms,\naffected to desire information, which the old Lady, highly pleased with\nhis desire of improvement in her favourite studies, gave him with great\nsimplicity.\n\nLord Westhaven grew apprehensive that the jaunts of pleasure which the\nBaron continued to propose would be too fatigueing for his wife. And as\nthey were now to go on a visit to one of St. Alpin's old military\nfriends, who resided at the distance of fifteen miles, and where they\nwere to remain all night, he prevailed on her to stay at home, where\nEmmeline also desired to be left.\n\nBellozane, detesting a party which the ladies were not to enliven, made\nsome efforts to be excused also; but he found his declining to go would\nso much chagrin and disappoint his father, that, with whatever\nreluctance, he was obliged to set out with him.\n\nLady Westhaven, who was a good deal indisposed, went to lie down in her\nown room; whither Emmeline attended her, and finding she was disposed to\nsleep, left her. Mrs. St. Alpin was busied in her garden; and Emmeline,\ndelighted with an opportunity of being alone, retired to her room to\nwrite to Mrs. Stafford. She had not proceeded far in her letter, when a\nservant informed her that the messenger who had been sent to Geneva for\nher box was returned with it. She desired that it might be brought up.\nMadelon came to assist her in opening it, and then left her.\n\nShe took out the cloaths and linen, and then the two embroidered\ncaskets, which she put on the table before her, and gazed at with\nmelancholy pleasure, as silent memorials of her parents. They brought\nalso to her mind the recollection of Mrs. Carey, and many of her\ninfantine pains and pleasures at Mowbray Castle, where she remembered\nfirst to have remarked them in a drawer belonging to that good woman; to\nwhich, tho' it was generally locked, she had occasionally sent her\nlittle charge when she was herself confined to her chair.\n\nOne of them she had began to inspect at Clapham, and perused some of the\nletters it contained. They were from her grandmother, Mrs. Mowbray, to\nher father; and were filled with reproaches so warm and severe, and such\npointed censures of his conduct in regard to Miss Stavordale, her\nmother, to whom one letter yet more bitter was addressed, that after\nreading three of them, Emmeline believed that the further inspection of\nthe casket was likely to produce for her only unavailing regret.\n\nStill however she would then have continued it, painful as it was, but\nwas interrupted by the sudden entrance of Lord Montreville, who came to\nenquire after his son. The sight of Mr. Mowbray's picture, which she had\ntaken out, created in the breast of his Lordship a momentary tenderness\nfor his niece. She had since always worn that picture about her; but the\npapers, by which she had been too much affected after that interview\nfarther to peruse, she had again secured in the caskets; and being\nalmost immediately afterwards taken by Delamere on her involuntary\njourney to Stevenage, from whence she returned no more to Clapham, she\nhad not since had them in her possession.\n\nHer mind in this interval had acquired greater strength; and she at\nlength wished to know those particulars of her mother's fate, into which\nshe had hitherto forborne thro' timidity to enquire. Being now therefore\nalone, and having these repositories once more in her hands, she\nresolutely inspected them.\n\nThe first contained about twenty letters. Some were those she had before\nseen, and others followed them equally severe. They seemed in sullen\nresentment to have been preserved; and Emmeline could not but reflect\nwith pain on the anger and asperity in which they were written; on the\nremorse and uneasiness with which they must have been read.\n\nThe second casket seemed also to hold letters. On opening it, Emmeline\nfound they were part of the correspondence between her father and mother\nduring the early part of their acquaintance, when, tho' they sometimes\nresided in the same house, the vigilant observation of Mrs. Mowbray very\nseldom allowed them to converse.\n\nAmong these, were several pieces of poetry, elegant and affecting. After\nhaving read which, Emmeline imagined she had seen all the box contained,\na few loosely folded papers only remaining; but on opening one of these,\nwhat was her astonishment to find in it two certificates of her mother's\nmarriage; one under the hand of a Catholic priest, by whom she had been\nmarried immediately on their arrival at Dunkirk; the other signed a few\ndays before the birth of Emmeline by an English clergyman, who had again\nperformed the ceremony in the chapel of the English Ambassador at Paris.\n\nThat the memory of her mother should thus be free from reproach; that\nthe conduct of her father, which had hitherto appeared cruel and unjust,\nshould be vindicated from every aspersion; and that she should herself\nbe restored to that place in society from which she seemed to be\nexcluded for ever; was altogether such unexpected, such incredible\nhappiness, as made her almost doubtful of the evidence of her senses.\nIgnorant as she was of the usual form of such papers, yet the care with\nwhich these seemed to be executed left her little doubt of their\nregularity. One other folded paper yet remained unread. Trembling she\nopened it. It was written in her father's hand and endorsed\n\n\n                              MEMORANDUM\n\n    'The harshness with which my mother and her family have treated\n  Miss Stavordale, for a supposed crime, has forced her to put herself\n  under my protection. Miss Stavordale is now my wife; but of this I\n  shall not inform my family, conceiving myself accountable no longer\n  to persons capable of so much rashness and injustice. Least any\n  thing however should happen before I can make a will in due form, I\n  hereby acknowledge Emmeline Stavordale (now Mowbray) as my wife; and\n  her child, whether a son or a daughter, heir to my estate. My\n  brother being possessed of a very large fortune, both by his late\n  marriage and the gifts of his mother's family, will hardly dispute\n  the claim of such child to my paternal estate.\n\n    '(This is a duplicate of a paper sent to Francis Williamson, my\n  steward at Mowbray Castle.) Signed by me at Paris in presence of\n  two witnesses, this fifteenth of March 17--.\n\n                                               HENRY CHARLES MOWBRAY.\n\n    Witnessed by\n  ROBERT WALLACE,\n  BAPTISTE LA FERE, (dit Le Limosin.)'\n\n\nThis, which was of the same date as the last certificate, confirmed\nevery claim which they both gave Emmeline to her name and fortune. A\nchange of circumstances so sudden; her apprehensions that the Marquis of\nMontreville, who she thought must have long known, should dispute her\nlegitimacy, and her wonder at the concealment which Mr. Williamson and\nMrs. Carey seemed passively to have suffered; which together with a\nthousand other sensations crouded at once into her mind, so greatly\naffected her, that feeling herself grow sick, she was obliged to call\nMadelon, who being at work in an adjoining room, ran in, and seeing her\nlady look extremely pale, and hearing her speak with difficulty, she\nthrew open the window, fetched her some water, and then without waiting\nto see their effects she flew away to call Mrs. St. Alpin; who presently\nappeared, followed by her maid carrying a large case which was filled\nwith bottles of various distillations from every aromatic and pungent\nherb her garden or the adjacent mountains afforded.\n\nEmmeline, hardly knowing what she did, was compelled to swallow a glass\nfull of one of these cordials; which Mrs. St. Alpin assured her was\n'_excellente pour les vapeurs_.'[27] It almost deprived her of breath,\nbut recalled her astonished spirits; and having with great difficulty\nprevailed on her kindly-busy hostess to leave her, she locked up her\npapers, and threw herself on the bed; where, having directed Madelon to\ndraw the curtains and retire, she tried to compose her mind, and to\nconsider what steps she ought to take in consequence of this\nextraordinary discovery.\n\n[Footnote 25: Dining Room.]\n\n[Footnote 26: The most wearisome, or to use the cant of the times, the\nmost _boring_ subjects in the world.]\n\n[Footnote 27: Excellent for the cure of vapours.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nConvinced of the noble and disinterested nature of Lord Westhaven,\nEmmeline thought she ought immediately on his return to shew him the\npapers she had found, and entreat him to examine, for farther\nparticulars, Le Limosin, who seemed providentially to have been thrown\nin her way on purpose to elucidate her history.\n\nAfter having formed this resolution, her mind was at liberty for other\nreflections. Delamere returned to it: his unjust suspicions; his haughty\nreproaches; his long, indignant anger, which vouchsafed not even to\nsolicit an explanation; she involuntarily compared with the gentleness,\nthe generosity of Godolphin; with his candid temper, his warm\naffections, his tender heart. And with pain she remembered, that unless\nDelamere would relinquish the fatal promise she had given him, she could\nnot shew the preference which she feared she must ever feel for him.\nSometimes she thought of asking Lord Westhaven to apply to Delamere for\nher release. But how could she venture on a measure which might involve,\nin such difficulties, Lady Adelina, and engage Lord Westhaven in an\nenquiry fatal to his repose and that of his whole family? How could she,\nby this application, counteract the wishes of Lady Westhaven, who\nanxiously hoped to re-unite her brother and her friend; and who desired\nardently to be in England, that she might explain herself, to Delamere,\nall the circumstances that had injured Emmeline in his opinion; which\nshe thought she could easily do without hazarding any of the evils that\nmight follow from an inconsiderate disclosure of the occurrences he had\nmisunderstood.\n\nUneasily ruminating on the painful uncertainty of her situation and the\ndifficulties which every way surrounded her, she continued alone; till\nLady Westhaven, alarmed at hearing she had been ill, sent her woman to\nenquire after and know if she might herself come to her? Emmeline, to\nrelieve at once her friendly solicitude, arose and went to her\napartment; where she made light of her sickness, and endeavoured to\nassume as much chearfulness as possible.--'Till she had seen Lord\nWesthaven, she determined not to mention to her Ladyship the discovery\nof the morning; feeling that there would be great indelicacy in eagerly\ndivulging to her a secret by which she must tacitly accuse the Marquis\nof Montreville of having thus long detained from its legal owner the\nMowbray estate; and of having brought up in indigence and obscurity, the\ndaughter of his brother, while conscious of her claim to education and\naffluence.\n\nStruggling therefore to subdue the remaining tumult of her spirits, she\nrejoined her friend. They passed the afternoon tranquilly with Mrs. St.\nAlpin; and about eleven o'clock the following morning, Lord Westhaven,\nthe Baron, and the Chevalier, returned.\n\nEmmeline took the earliest opportunity of telling Lord Westhaven that\nshe wished to speak to him alone. There was no way of escaping from the\nChevalier but by his Lordship's openly declaring that he wanted a\nprivate conference with his fair cousin, whom he led into the garden.\nBellozane, who hoped that his earnest solicitations had prevailed on\nLord Westhaven to befriend his love, was glad to see them walk out\ntogether, while he watched them from a window.\n\nEmmeline put into her pocket the two certificates and the memorandum\nwritten by her father. Without explanation or comment, she gave them, as\nsoon as they were at a little distance from the house, to Lord\nWesthaven.\n\nHe read them twice over in silence; then looking with astonishment at\nEmmeline, he asked her from whence she had these papers?\n\n'They were enclosed, my Lord,' answered she 'in two little boxes or\ncaskets which were left to me among other things by my father's nurse;\nwho becoming the housekeeper at Mowbray Castle, brought me up. They\nafterwards long remained at the house of Mrs. James Crofts, with whom\nyou know I resided; on her removal after her marriage, they were sent,\ntogether with some of my cloaths, to Mrs. Stafford's agent in London;\nfrom whence she lately received them; and having an opportunity of\nsending them to Geneva by a family travelling thither, she forwarded\nthem to me, and I found them yesterday in the trunk brought by the\nmessenger which you know the Baron sent thither on purpose.'\n\nAgain Lord Westhaven read the papers; and after pausing a moment said--\n\n'There is no doubt, there can be none, of the authenticity of these\npapers, nor of your consequent claim to the Mowbray estate. Surely,'\nadded he, again pausing--'surely it is most extraordinary that Lord\nMontreville should have suffered the true circumstances of your birth to\nremain thus long unexplained. Most cruel! most ungenerous! to possess\nhimself of a property to which he must know he had no right! Your\nfather's memorandum says that he had forwarded a duplicate of it to\nFrancis Williamson; do you know whether that person is yet living?'\n\n'He is dead, my Lord. He died in consequence of an accident at Mowbray\nCastle, where he was many years steward.'\n\n'He must however have had sufficient time to give Lord Montreville every\ninformation as to his master's marriage, even if his Lordship knew it\nnot, as he probably did, by other means. Yet from a man of honour--from\nLord Montreville--such conduct is most unworthy. I can hardly conceive\nit possible that he should be guilty of such concealment.'\n\n'Surely, my Lord, it is possible,' said the candid and ingenuous\nEmmeline--'surely it _is_ possible that my uncle might, by some\naccident, (for which without knowing more we cannot account) have been\nkept in ignorance of my mother's real situation. For your satisfaction\nand mine, before we say more on this subject, would it not be well to\nhear what Le Limosin, who was I suppose present both at my mother's\nmarriage and at my father's death, has to relate?'\n\nTo this proposal Lord Westhaven agreed. The _sal a compagnie_[28] was\nusually vacant at this time of the day. Thither they went together, and\nsent for Le Limosin; who loved talking so much that nothing was more\neasy than to make him tell all he remembered, and even minutely describe\nevery scene at which he had been present.\n\n'Le Limosin,' said Lord Westhaven, as soon as he came into the room, 'I\nwas much pleased and interested with the account you gave me when I\nfirst met you, of the English master whom you call _Milor Mowbray_. I\nknow his family well. Tell me, does this picture resemble him?'\n\nHis Lordship shewed him a portrait of Mr. Mowbray which had been drawn\nat Paris.\n\nLe Limosin looked a moment at it--the tears came into his eyes.\n\n'_O oui--oui, mi Lor!--je me rappelle bien ce portrait!--Ah! quel\nresemblance! Quelques mois avant sa mort tel etoit mon pauvre maitre!\nAh!_' added he, giving back, with a sigh, the picture to Lord\nWesthaven--'_cela me fend le coeur!_'[29]\n\n'Now then,' reassumed Lord Westhaven, 'look, Le Limosin, at that.' He\nput before him the resemblance of Emmeline's mother, which had been\npainted at the same time.\n\n'_Eh! pardi oui--voila--voila Madame! la charmante femme, dont la perte\ncouta la vie a mon maitre. Helas!--je m'en souviens bien du j\u00c3\u00b4ur que je\nvis pour la premiere fois cette aimable dame. Elle n'avoit qu'environ\nquatorze a quinze ans. Ah! qu'elle etoit pour lors, ga\u00c3\u00af, espiegle,\nfolatre, et si belle!--si belle!_'[30]\n\n'Tell me,' said Lord Westhaven, 'all you remember of her.'\n\n'I remember her, my Lord,' said Le Limosin, speaking still in French, 'I\nremember her from the first of my going to England with Milor Mowbray.\nShe lived then with Madame Mowbray; and the servants told me, that being\na distant relation and an orphan, Madame had taken her and intended to\ngive her a fortune. Milor Mowbray, when he first returned from his\ntravels, used to live for two or three months together with Madame his\nmother; but she was strict and severe, and used frequently to reproach\nhim with his gaieties--_il etoit un peu libertin Milor, comme sont a\nl'ordinaire les jeunes seigneurs de sa nation_.[31] He admired\nMademoiselle Stavordale as a beautiful child, and used to romp with her;\nbut as she grew older, Madame Mowbray was dissatisfied with him for\ntaking so much notice of her, and would oblige her to live always up in\nMadame's dressing room, so that my master could hardly ever see her.\nMadame, however, told my master one day, that tho' Mademoiselle\nStavordale had no fortune, she would not object to his marrying her in a\nyear or two if he was then in the same mind. But my master was in his\nturn offended. He said he would not be dictated to, nor told whether he\nshould marry or remain single. _Madame etoit forte brusque--elle piquoit\nMonsieur par un reponse un peu vive_[32]--and they had a violent\ndisagreement; in consequence of which he quitted her house, and only\nwent now and then afterwards to see her quite in form. Some months\nafterwards he called me to him; and as I was dressing him he asked me if\nI had no female friend among his mother's servants. 'Baptiste,' said he,\n'I cannot get the Demoiselle Stavordale out of my head.--_J'aime a la\nfolie cette fille mais pour le mariage, je ne suis pas trop sur, que je\nm'acquitterai bien, en promissant de l'aimer pour la vie.--Je veux aussi\nqu'elle m'aime sans que l'interet y'entre pour quelque chose.--Puisque\nMadame ma mere s'amuse a me guetter, je voudrois bien la tromper; je\nscais que tu est habile--ne pourra tu pas nous menager une petite tete a\ntete?[33] 'Milor, je faisois mon possible--et enfin--par la bont\u00c3\u00a9 et\nl'honetet\u00c3\u00a9--d'une fille qui servoit Madame--je vins heureusement\nabout--Quelque jours apres--Monsieur enleva la belle Stavordale tant en\ndepit--qu'en amour._'[34]\n\nAt this recital, Emmeline found herself cruelly hurt; but Lord Westhaven\nbesought her to command herself, and Le Limosin went on.\n\n'To avoid the rage and reproaches of Madame Mowbray, which it was likely\nwould be very loud, my master took Mademoiselle Stavordale immediately\nabroad. We landed at Dunkirk; but the young lady was so unhappy at the\nstep she had taken, _elle pleuroit, elle se desoloit, elle s'abandonna a\nle desespoir--enfin, tant elle faisoit_,[35] that Monsieur sent for a\npriest, and they were married. Soon afterwards my lady was likely to\nbring Monsieur an heir. _Ah! qu'ils etoient pour lors heureux._ But\ntheir happiness was interrupted by the death of my master's mother,\nMadame Mowbray, who had never forgiven him, and who disposed of all her\nmoney that was in her own power to his brother. My poor lady took this\nsadly to heart. She reproached herself with being the cause of my\nmaster's losing such a fortune. He said he had yet enough; and tried to\nconsole my lady. Still, still it hung on her spirits; and she could not\nbear to think that Madame Mowbray, who had brought her up, and had been\nkind to her when she had no other friend, should have died in anger with\nher. I believe my master was sorry then that he had not reconciled\nhimself with his mother, as my lady often begged and entreated that he\nwould; but it was now too late; and he said his brother had used him\nunkindly, and had certainly helped to irritate his mother against him;\nand he would not write to him tho' my lady often desired and prayed that\nhe would. As she grew near her time, she was more and more out of\nspirits, and my master finding her uneasy because they had not been\nmarried by an English priest, had the ceremony performed again in the\nchapel of the English Ambassador. My master could not however make her\nforget her concern for the death of his mother; and she was always\nmelancholy, as if she had foreseen how little a time she had herself to\nlive. Alas! she brought my master a daughter, and died in three hours!'\n\n'If I were to live a thousand years,' continued Le Limosin, 'I should\nnever forget my poor master's distraction when he heard she was dead. It\nwas with great difficulty that even with the assistance of his English\nservants I could prevent his destroying himself in the phrenzy of his\ngrief. I dared not leave him a moment. He heard nothing we said to him;\nhe heeded not the questions I asked him about the child; and at last I\nwas forced to send an express to Mr. Oxenden, his friend, who was at\nsome distance from Paris. He came; and by the help of another English\ngentleman they forced him out of the house while the body of my mistress\nwas removed to be carried to England. He was so near madness, that his\nfriends were afraid of his relapsing, even after he grew better, if they\nasked him many questions about it. So they gave me orders as to her\nfuneral; and after about a fortnight he came back to the house where the\nchild was, attended by his two friends.\n\n'It was an heart-piercing sight, Milor, to see him weep over the little\nbaby as it lay in the arms of it's nurse. After some time he called me,\nand told me that he should not be easy, unless he was sure his poor\nlittle girl would be taken proper care of; that he had no friend in\nFrance to whom he chose to entrust her; and therefore ordered me to go\nwith the nurse to England, and directed Ther\u00c3\u00a9se, my mistress's _fille de\nchambre_, to go also, that the child might be well attended. He told me\nthat he should perhaps quit Paris before I could get back; in which case\nhe would leave directions where I should follow him. Then he kissed his\nlittle girl, and his two friends tore him away. I immediately proceeded\nto England as he directed, with the nurse, and Ther\u00c3\u00a9se, and we carried\nthe infant to the Chateau de Mowbray. The French nurse could speak no\nEnglish, and could not be prevailed upon to stay above two days. Ther\u00c3\u00a9se\ntoo longed to get back to France; and we immediately returned to Paris,\nwhere I found a letter from my master, ordering me to follow him into\nItaly.\n\n'At Milan, Milor, I rejoined him. He looked very ill; and complained of\nfeeling himself indisposed. But still he went out; and I believe drank\ntoo much with his English friends. The third or fourth day after I got\nthere he came home from a party which he had made out of town with them\nabout ten o'clock in the morning, and told me he had a violent pain in\nhis head. He went up into his room. \"I am strangely disordered,\nBaptiste,\" said he, as he put his hand to his temples--\"perhaps it may\ngo off; but if it should grow worse, as I am afraid it will, remember\nthat you take those two little boxes in which I keep my papers, to\nEngland, and deliver them to my steward at Mowbray Castle. I have\nalready written to him about my daughter.\" Then almost shrieking with\nthe acute pain which darted into his head, he cried--\"I cannot talk, nor\ncan I now write to my brother as I think I ought to do about my child.\nBut send, send for a notary, and when I am a little easier I will\ndictate a will.\"\n\n'Milor, I sent for the notary, But he waited all day in the anti-room to\nno purpose. My poor master was never again easy enough to see him--never\nagain able to dictate a will. He grew more and more delirious, and\ncontinued to complain of his head, his head! Alas! he did not even know\nme, till about an hour before his death.'\n\nEmmeline, whose tears had almost choaked her during the greatest part of\nthis narration, now said to Lord Westhaven--\n\n'My Lord, do not let him repeat the scene of my father's death; I am not\nnow able to bear it.'\n\n'Well, Le Limosin,' said his Lordship, 'this young lady, who is the\ndaughter of your master; the same whom you helped to carry, an infant,\nto Mowbray Castle, will soon have it in her power to reward your\nfidelity and attachment to her father.'\n\nLe Limosin now threw himself on his knees in a transport of joy and\nacknowledgment. Lord Westhaven, fearing that his raptures might quite\novercome the disturbed spirits of his fair mistress, desired her to give\nhim her hand to kiss; which she did, and trying, but ineffectually, to\nsmile thro' her tears, was led by his Lordship into her own room. He\ntold her that at present he wished to conceal from Lady Westhaven the\ndiscovery they had made. 'For tho' I am convinced,' added he, 'that for\nyour sake she will rejoice in it, she will be hurt at the extraordinary\nconduct of her father, and harrass herself with conjectures about it and\napologies for it, which I wish to spare her in her present state.'\n\nEmmeline assured him she would observe a strict silence; and he left her\nto give to Le Limosin a charge of secresy. He then retired to his room,\nand wrote to Lord Montreville, stating the simple fact, and enclosing\ncopies of the certificates; and after shewing his letter to Emmeline,\nsent it off to England.\n\nEmmeline now went out to walk, in hopes of recovering her composure and\nbeing able to appear at dinner without betraying by her countenance that\nany thing extraordinary had been the subject of her conversation with\nLord Westhaven. The Chevalier, however, was soon at her side. And still\nflattering himself that his Lordship had undertaken to plead his cause,\nhe addressed her with all the confidence of a man sure of success.\n\nEmmeline was very little disposed to listen to him; and with a greater\nappearance of chagrin and impatience than she had yet shewn, repeated to\nhim her determination not to marry. He still declared himself sure of\nher relenting; and added, that unless she had designed finally to hear\nhim favourably she would never have allowed him so repeatedly to press\nhis attachment. This speech, which indirectly accused her of coquetry,\nencreased her vexation. But the persevering Chevalier was not to be\nrepressed. He told her that he had projected a party of pleasure on the\nlake the next day, in which he intended to include a visit to the Rocks\nof Meillerie.\n\n'It is classic ground, Mademoiselle,' said he, 'and is fitted to love\nand despair. Ah! will you not there hear me? Will you still inhumanly\nsmile; will you still look so gentle, while your heart is harder than\nthe rocks we shall see--colder than the snow that crowns them!--an heart\non which even the pen of fire which Rousseau held would make no\nimpression!'\n\nHe held her hands during this rhapsody. She could not therefore\nimmediately escape. But on the appearance of a servant, who announced\nthe dinner's being ready, she coldly disengaged herself and went into\nthe house.\n\n[Footnote 28: Drawing room.]\n\n[Footnote 29: O yes, my Lord; I recollect well this picture. What a\nlikeness! Such, a few months before he died, was my poor master! Alas!\nit cuts me to the heart.]\n\n[Footnote 30: Ah! hah! yes,--there is, sure enough, my Lady. The charming\nwoman whose loss cost my master his life. Alas! how well I recollect the\nfirst day I saw this amiable lady; she was then only between fourteen\nand fifteen; and at that time so gay, so full of frolic and vivacity,\nand so very, very pretty!]\n\n[Footnote 31: He was a little free, my Lord; as the young noblemen of his\ncountry usually are.]\n\n[Footnote 32: Madame was very hasty; she irritated my master by a sharp\nanswer.]\n\n[Footnote 33: I love that girl to madness; but as to marrying her I am\nnot quite sure I should acquit myself well were I to promise that I\nwould love her for ever. I desire too that interest may have nothing to\ndo with her affection for me. As my mother amuses herself with watching\nme, I long to deceive her. You are a clever fellow; cannot you contrive\nfor us a private meeting?]\n\n[Footnote 34: My Lord, I did my best; and at last by the goodness and\ncivility of a young woman who waited on Madame, I happily accomplished\nit. Some days after which, my master carried off the fair Stavordale, as\nmuch thro' revenge as love.]\n\n[Footnote 35: She wept, she lamented, she gave herself up to despair.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nThe agitation she had undergone in the morning, affected both the\nspirits and the looks of Emmeline; and when, immediately after dinner,\nBellozane proposed the party of pleasure he had projected for the next\nday, Lady Westhaven answered--'As for me I shall on my own account make\nno objection, but I cannot equally answer for our fair cousin.--Emmeline,\nmy love, you seem ill. I cannot imagine, my Lord, what you have been\nsaying to her?'\n\n'I have been advising her,' answered Lord Westhaven, 'to go into a\nconvent; and her looks are merely looks of penitence for all the\nmischief she has done. She determines to take the veil, and to do no\nmore.'\n\nEmmeline, tho' hardly able to bear even this friendly raillery, turned\nit off with a melancholy smile. The party was agreed upon; the Baron\nwent out to give orders for preparing the provisions they were to take\nwith them, and the Chevalier to see that the boat was in a proper state\nfor the expedition and give the boatmen notice.\n\nLady Westhaven then began talking of England, and expressed her\nastonishment at having heard nothing from thence for above six weeks.\nWhile Lord Westhaven was attempting to account for this failure of\nintelligence, which he saw gave his wife more concern than she\nexpressed, a servant brought in several large pacquets of letters, which\nhe said the messenger who was usually sent to the post town, had that\nmoment brought in.\n\nHis Lordship, eagerly surveying the address of each, gave to Emmeline\none for her; which opening, she found came from Mrs. Stafford, and\nenclosed another.\n\n\n                                               _St. Germains, June 6._\n\n    'My dearest Emmeline will forgive me if I write only a line in the\n  envelope, to account for the long detention of the enclosed letter.\n  It has, by some mistake of Mr. La Fosse, been kept at Rouen instead\n  of being forwarded to St. Germains; and appears to have passed thro'\n  numberless hands. I hope you will get it safe; tho' my being at\n  Paris when it _did_ arrive here has made it\n  yet a week later. By the next post I shall write more fully, and\n  therefore will now only tell you we are well, and that I am ever,\n  with the truest attachment, your\n\n                                                         C. STAFFORD.'\n\n\nEmmeline now saw by the seal and the address that the second letter was\nfrom Lord Montreville. It appeared to have been written in great haste;\nand as she unfolded it, infinite was her amazement to find, instead of a\nremittance, which about this time she expected, the promise she had\ngiven Delamere, torn in two pieces and put into a blank paper.\n\nThe astonishment and agitation she felt at this sight, hardly left her\npower to read the letter which she held.\n\n\n                                         _Berkley-Square, May 5, 17--_\n\n  'Dear Miss Mowbray,\n\n    'My son, Lord Delamere, convinced at length of the impropriety of\n  a marriage so unwelcome to his family, allows me to release you from\n  the promise which he obtained. I do myself the pleasure to enclose\n  it, and shall be glad to hear you receive it safe by an early post.\n  My Lord Delamere assures me that you hold no promise of the like\n  nature from him. If he is in this matter forgetful, I doubt not but\n  that you will return it on receipt of this.\n\n    'Maddox informs me that he shall in a few days forward to you the\n  payment due: to which I beg leave to add, that if you have occasion\n  for fifty or an hundred pounds more, during your stay on the\n  continent, you may draw on Maddox to that amount. With sincere\n  wishes for your health and happiness, I am, dear Miss Mowbray, your\n  obedient and faithful humble servant,\n\n                                                         MONTREVILLE.'\n\n\nTho' joy was, in the heart of Emmeline, the predominant emotion, she yet\nfelt some degree of pique and resentment involuntarily arise against\nLord Montreville and his son; and tho' the renunciation of the latter\nwas what she had secretly wished ever since she had discovered the\ncapricious violence of Delamere and the merit of Godolphin, the cold and\nbarely civil stile in which his father had acquainted her with it,\nseemed at once to shock, mortify, and relieve her.\n\nAfter having considered a moment the contents of her own letters, she\ncast her eyes towards Lady Westhaven, whose countenance expressed great\nemotion; while her Lord, sternly and displeased ran over his, and then\nput them into his pocket.\n\n'What say _your_ letters from England, my fairest cousin?' said he,\nadvancing and trying to shake off his chagrin.\n\n'Will you do me the honour to peruse them, my Lord?' said she, half\nsmiling.--'They will not take you up much time.'\n\nHe read them. 'It is a settled thing then I find. Lady Westhaven, your's\nare, I presume, from Berkley-square?'\n\n'They are,' answered she.--'Never,' and she took out her\nhandkerchief--'never have I received any less welcome!'\n\nShe gave one from Lady Frances Crofts to his Lordship, in which, with\nmany details of her own affairs, was this sentence--\n\n\n    'Before this, you have heard from my father or my mother that\n  Lord Delamere has entirely recovered the use of his reason, and\n  accepts of Miss Otley with her immense fortune. This change was\n  brought about suddenly. It was settled in Norfolk, immediately\n  after Lord Delamere's return from Ireland. I congratulate you and\n  Lord W. on an event which I conclude _must_ to _both_ of you be\n  pleasing. I have seen none of the family for near three weeks, as\n  they are gone back into Norfolk; only my brother called for a\n  moment, and seemed to be greatly hurried; by which, as well as from\n  other circumstances, I conclude that preparations are making for\n  the wedding immediately.'\n\n  _May 18._\n\n\nLady Westhaven, who saw all hopes of being allied to the friend of her\nheart for ever at an end--who believed that she had always cherished an\naffection for her brother, and who supposed that in consequence of his\ndesertion she was left in mortifying dependance on Lord Montreville, was\ninfinitely hurt at this information. The letter from her father to\nEmmeline confirmed all her apprehensions. There was a freezing civility\nin the style, which gave no hopes of his alleviating by generosity and\nkindness the pain which her Ladyship concluded Emmeline must feel; while\nLord Westhaven, knowing that to her whom he thus insulted with the\ndistant offer of fifty or an hundred pounds, he really was accountable\nfor the income of an estate of four thousand five hundred a year, for\nnear nineteen years, and that he still withheld that estate from her,\ncould hardly contain his indignation even before his wife; whom he\nloved too well not to wish to conceal from her the ill opinion he could\nnot help conceiving of her father.\n\nEmmeline, who was far from feeling that degree of pain which Lady\nWesthaven concluded must penetrate her heart, was yet unwilling to shew\nthat she actually received with pleasure (tho' somewhat allayed by Lord\nMontreville's coldness) an emancipation from her engagement. Of her\npartiality to Godolphin, her friend had no idea; for Emmeline, too\nconscious of it to be able to converse about him without fearing to\nbetray herself, had studiously avoided talking of him after their first\nmeeting; and she now imagined that Lady Westhaven, passionately fond of\nher brother as she was, would think her indifference affected thro'\npique; and carried too far, if she did not receive the intelligence of\ntheir eternal separation with some degree of concern. These thoughts\ngave her an air of vexation and embarrassment which would have saved her\nthe trouble of dissimulation had she been an adept in it's practice.\nExtremely harrassed and out of spirits before, tears now, in spite of\nher internal satisfaction, and perhaps partly arising from it, filled\nher eyes; while Lady Westhaven, who was greatly more hurt, exclaimed--\n\n'My brother then marries Miss Otley! After all I have heard him say, I\nthought it impossible!'\n\n'He will however, I doubt not, be happy,' answered Emmeline. 'The\nsatisfaction of having made Lord and Lady Montreville completely happy,\nmust greatly contribute to his being so himself.'\n\n'Heaven grant it!' replied Lady Westhaven. 'Poor Frederic! he throws\naway an invaluable blessing! Whether he will, in any other, find\nconsolation, I greatly doubt. But however changed _his_ heart may be, my\ndearest Emmeline,' added she, tenderly embracing her, 'I think I can\nventure to assure you that those of Lord Westhaven and your Augusta,\nwill, towards you, ever be the same.'\n\nEmmeline now wished to put an end to a conversation which Lady Westhaven\nseemed hardly able to support; and she languished herself to be alone.\nForcing therefore a smile, tho' the tears still fell from her eyes, she\nsaid--'My dear friends, tho' I expected this long ago, yet I beg you to\nconsider that being _but_ a woman, and of course vain, my pride is a\nlittle wounded, and I must recollect all your kindnesses, to put me in\ngood humour again with myself. Do not let the Chevalier follow me; for I\nam not disposed to hear any thing this evening, after these sweetest\nand most consoling assurances of your inestimable friendship. Therefore\nI shall take Madelon with me, and go for a walk.'\n\nShe then left the room, Lady Westhaven not attempting to detain her; and\nher Lord, vexed to see his gentle Augusta thus uneasy, remained with\nher, pointing out to her the fairest prospects of establishment for her\nbeloved Emmeline; tho' he thought the present an improper opportunity to\nopen to her his knowledge of those circumstances in her friend's\nfortune, which, without such conspicuous merit, could hardly fail of\nobtaining it.\n\nTo go to a great distance from the house, alone, Emmeline had not\ncourage; to stay near it, subjected her to the intrusion and importunity\nof the Chevalier. She therefore determined to take Madelon, whose\npresence would be some protection without any interruption to her\nthoughts. She had wished, ever since her arrival at St. Alpin, to visit\nalone the borders of the lake of Geneva. Madelon, alert and sprightly,\nundertook to shew her the pleasantest way, and led her thro' a narrow\npath crossing a hill covered with broom and coppice wood, into a dark\nand gloomy wood of fir, cypress, and chestnut, that extended to the edge\nof the water; from which it was in some places separated by rocks\npointing out into the lake, while in others the trees grew almost in the\nwater, and dipped their extremities in the limpid waves beneath them.\n\nMadelon informed Emmeline that this was the place where the servants of\nthe castle assembled to dance of an holyday, in the shade; and where\nboats usually landed that came from the other side of the lake.\n\nThe scene, softened into more pensive beauty by the approach of a warm\nand serene evening, had every thing in it that could charm and soothe\nthe mind of the lovely orphan. But her internal feelings were at this\ntime too acute to suffer her to attend to outward circumstances. She\nwished only for tranquillity and silence, to collect her thoughts; and\nbidding Madelon find herself a seat, she went a few yards into the wood,\nand sat down on the long grass, where even Madelon might not remark her.\n\nThe events of the two last days appeared to be visions rather than\nrealities. From being an indigent dependant on the bounty of a relation,\nwhose caprice or avarice might leave her entirely destitute, she was at\nonce found to be heiress to an extensive property. From being bound down\nto marry, if he pleased, a man for whom she felt only sisterly regard,\nand who had thrown her from him in the violence of unreasonable jealousy\nand gloomy suspicion, she was now at liberty to indulge the affections\nshe had so long vainly resisted, and to think, without present\nself-accusation, or the danger of future repentance, of Godolphin. In\nimagination, she already beheld him avowing that tenderness which he had\nbefore generously struggled to conceal. She saw him, who she believed\nwould have taken her _without_ fortune, receiving in her estate the\nmeans of bestowing happiness, and the power of indulging his liberal and\nnoble spirit. She saw the tender, unhappy Adelina, reconciled to life in\ncontemplating the felicity of her dear William; and Lord Westhaven, to\nwhom she was so much obliged, glorying in the good fortune of a brother\nso deservedly beloved; while still calling her excellent and lovely\nfriend Augusta by the endearing appellation of sister, she saw her\nforget, in the happiness of Godolphin, the concern she had felt for\nDelamere.\n\nFrom this delicious dream of future bliss, she was awakened somewhat\nsuddenly by Madelon; who running towards her, told her that a boat, in\nwhich there appeared to be several men, was pointing to land just where\nshe had been sitting. Emmeline, wearied as she was with the Chevalier's\ngallantry, immediately supposed it to be him, and she knew he was out on\nthe lake. She therefore advanced a step or two to look. It was so nearly\ndark that she could only distinguish a man standing in the boat, whose\nfigure appeared to be that of Bellozane; and taking Madelon by the arm,\nshe hastily struck into the wood, to avoid him by returning to St. Alpin\nbefore he should perceive her.\n\nShe had hardly walked twenty paces, when she heard the boat put on\nshore, and two or three persons leap out of it. Still hoping, however,\nto get thro' the wood before Bellozane could overtake her, she almost\nran with Madelon. But somebody seemed to pursue them. Her cloaths were\nwhite; and she knew, that notwithstanding the evening was so far shut\nin, and the path obscured by trees, she must yet be distinguished\ngliding between their branches. The persons behind gained upon her, and\nher pace quickened as her alarm encreased; for she now apprehended\nsomething yet more disagreeable than being overtaken by Bellozane.\nSuddenly she heard--'_Arretez, arretez, Mesdames! de grace dites moi si\nvous etes de la famille du Baron de St. Alpin?_'[36]\n\nThe first word of this sentence stopped the flying Emmeline, and fixed\nher to the spot where she stood. It was the voice of Godolphin--Godolphin\nhimself was before her!\n\nThe suddenness of his appearance quite overcame her, breathless as she\nwas before from haste and fear; and finding that to support herself was\nimpossible, she staggered towards a tree which grew on the edge of the\npath, but would have fallen if Godolphin had not caught her in his arms.\n\nHe did this merely from the impulse of his natural gallantry and good\nnature. What were his transports, when he found that the fugitive whom\nhe had undesignedly alarmed by asking a direction to St. Alpin, was his\nadored Emmeline; and that the lovely object whose idea, since their\nfirst meeting, had never a moment been absent from it, he now pressed to\nhis throbbing heart? Instantly terrified, however, to find her\nspeechless and almost insensible, he ordered the servant who followed\nhim to run back for some water; and seating her gently on the ground, he\nthrew himself down by her and supported her; while Madelon, wringing her\nhands called on her _aimable_, her _belle maitresse_; and was too much\nfrightened to give her any assistance.\n\nBefore the man returned with the water, her recollection was restored,\nand she said, faintly--'Mr. Godolphin! Is it possible?'\n\n'Loveliest Miss Mowbray, how thoughtlessly have I alarmed you!--Can you\nforgive me?'\n\n'Ah!' cried she, disengaging herself from his support--'how came you\nhere, and from whence?'\n\nGodolphin, without considering, and almost without knowing what he said,\nreplied--'I come from Lord Delamere.'\n\n'From Lord Delamere!' exclaimed she, in amazement. 'Is he not in London\nthen?--is he not married?'\n\n'No; I overtook him at Besan\u00c3\u00a7on; where he lies ill--very ill!'\n\n'Ill!' repeated Emmeline.--'Ill, and at Besan\u00c3\u00a7on!--merciful heaven!'\n\nShe now again relapsed almost into insensibility: for at the mention of\nGodolphin's having overtaken him, and having left him ill, a thousand\nterrific and frightful images crouded into her mind; but the predominant\nidea was, that it was on her account they had met, and that Delamere's\nillness was a wound in consequence of that meeting.\n\nThat such an imagination should possess her, Godolphin had no means of\nknowing. He therefore very naturally concluded that the violent sorrow\nwhich she expressed, on hearing of Delamere's illness, arose from her\nlove towards him; and, in such a conclusion, he found the ruin of those\nhopes he had of late fondly cherished.\n\n'Happy, happy Delamere!' said he, sighing to himself.--'Her first\naffections were his, and never will any secondary tenderness supersede\nthat early impression. Alas! his rejection of her, has not been able to\nefface it--For me, there is nothing to hope! and while I thus hold her\nto my heart, I have lost her for ever! I came not hither, however,\nsolely on my own account, but rather to save from pain, her and those\nshe loves. 'Tis not then of myself I am to think.'\n\nWhile these reflections passed thro' his mind, he remained silent; and\nEmmeline concluded that his silence was owing to the truth of her\nconjecture. The grief of Lady Westhaven for her brother, the despair of\nLord Montreville for his son, presented themselves to her mind; and the\ncontemptuous return of her promise, which a few hours before she thought\nof with resentment, was now forgotten in regret for his illness and pity\nfor his sufferings.\n\n'Ah!' cried she, trying to rise, 'what shall I say to Lady\nWesthaven?--How disclose to her such intelligence as this?'\n\n'It was to prevent her hearing it abruptly,' said Godolphin, 'that I\ncame myself, rather than sent by a messenger or a letter, such\ndistressing information.'\n\nSo strongly had the idea of a duel between them taken possession of the\nmind of Emmeline, that she had no courage to ask particulars of his\nillness; and shuddering with horror at the supposition that the hand\nGodolphin held out to assist her was stained with the blood of the\nunfortunate Delamere, she drew her's hastily and almost involuntarily\nfrom him; and taking again Madelon's arm, attempted to hasten towards\nhome.\n\nBut the scene of anguish and terror which she must there encounter with\nLady Westhaven, the distress and vexation of her Lord, and the misery of\nbelieving that Godolphin had made himself for ever hateful to all her\nown family, and that if her cousin died she could never again behold him\nbut with regret and anguish, were altogether reflections so\noverwhelming, and so much more than her harrassed spirits were able to\nsustain, that after tottering about fifty yards, she was compelled to\nstop, and gasping for breath, to accept the offered assistance of\nGodolphin. Strongly prepossessed with the idea of her affection for\nDelamere, he languidly and mournfully lent it. He had no longer courage\nto speak to her; yet wished to take measures for preventing Lady\nWesthaven's being suddenly alarmed by his appearance; and he feared,\nthat not his appearance only, but his countenance, would tell her that\nhe came not thither to impart tidings of happiness.\n\nIt was now quite dark; and the slow pace in which only Emmeline could\nwalk, had not yet carried them through the wood. The agitation of\nEmmeline encreased: she wished, yet dreaded to know the particulars of\nDelamere's situation; and unable to summons courage to enquire into it,\nshe proceeded mournfully along, almost borne by Godolphin and Madelon;\nwho understanding nothing of what had been said, and not knowing who the\ngentleman was who had thus frightened her mistress, was herself almost\nas much in dismay.\n\nAfter a long pause, Emmeline, in faultering accents, asked 'if the\nsituation of Lord Delamere was absolutely desperate?'\n\n'I hope and believe not,' said Godolphin. 'When I left him, at least,\nthere were hopes of a favourable issue.'\n\n'Ah! wherefore did you leave him? Why not stay at least to see the\nevent?'\n\n'Because he so earnestly desired that his sister might know of his\nsituation, and that I only might acquaint her with it and press her to\ngo to him.'\n\n'She will need no entreaties. Poor, poor Delamere!'--sighing deeply,\nEmmeline again became silent.\n\nThey were to mount a small hill, which was between the wood they had\nleft and the grounds immediately surrounding St. Alpin, which was\nextremely steep and rugged. Before she reached the top, she was quite\nexhausted.\n\n'I believe,' said she, 'I must again rest before I can proceed.'\n\nShe sat down on a bank formed by the roots of the trees which sustained\nthe earth, on the edge of the narrow path.\n\nGodolphin, excessively alarmed at her weakness and dejection, which he\nstill attributed to the anguish she felt for Delamere, sat by her,\nhardly daring to breathe himself, while he listened to her short\nrespiration, and fancied he heard the violent palpitation of her heart.\n\n'And how long do you think,' said she, again recurring to Delamere--'how\nlong may he linger before the event will be known?'\n\n'I really hope, and I think I am not too sanguine, that the fever will\nhave left him before we see him again.'\n\n'The fever!' repeated Emmeline--'has he a fever then?'\n\n'Yes,' replied Godolphin--'I thought I told you that a fever was his\ncomplaint. But had you not better, my dear Madam, think a little of\nyourself! Ill as you appear to be, I see not how you are to get home\nunless you will suffer me to go on and procure some kind of conveyance\nfor you.'\n\n'I shall do very well,' answered she, 'as I am, if you will only tell me\nabout Lord Delamere. He has only a fever?'\n\n'And is it not enough,' said Godolphin. 'Tho', were I Lord Delamere, I\nshould think an illness that called forth in my favour the charming\nsensibility of Miss Mowbray, the happiest event of my life.'\n\nHaving said this, he fell into a profound silence. The certainty of her\naffection for Delamere, deprived him of all spirits when he most wanted\nto exert them. Yet it was necessary to take some measures for\nintroducing himself at St. Alpin without alarming Lady Westhaven, and to\nconsider how he was to account to his brother for Delamere's\nestrangement from Emmeline; and while he canvassed these and many other\nperplexities, Emmeline, who was relieved from the most distressing of\nher apprehensions, and dared not for the world reveal what those\napprehensions had been, in some degree recovered herself; and growing\nanxious for Lady Westhaven, said she believed she could now walk home.\n\nAs she was about to arise with an intention to attempt it, they heard\nthe sound of approaching voices, and almost immediately lights appeared\nabove the hill, while 'Mademoiselle!--Miss Mowbray!--Madelon!--Madelon!'\nwas frequently and loudly repeated by the persons who carried them.\n\n'The Baron and Lord Westhaven,' said Emmeline, 'alarmed at my being out\nso late, have sent persons in search of me.'\n\nHer conjecture was right. In a moment the Chevalier, with a flambeau in\nhis hand, was before them; who, when he found Emmeline sitting in such\na place, supported by a young man whom he had never before seen, was at\nonce amazed and displeased. There was no time for explanation. Lord\nWesthaven immediately followed him; and after stopping a moment to\nconsider whether the figure of Godolphin which rose before him was not\nan illusion, he flew eagerly into his arms.\n\nThe manly eyes of both the brothers were filled with tears. Lord\nWesthaven had not seen Godolphin for four years; and, since their last\nparting, they had lost their father. After a short pause, his Lordship\nintroduced Godolphin to Bellozane; and then taking the cold and\ntrembling hand of Emmeline, who leaned languidly on Madelon, he said--\n\n'And you, my lovely cousin, for whose safety we have been above an hour\nin the cruellest alarm, where did you find William, and by what\nextraordinary chance are ye here together?'\n\nEmmeline with great difficulty found voice enough to explain their\naccidental meeting. And Bellozane observing her apparent faintness,\nsaid--'you seem, Mademoiselle, to be extremely fatigued. Pray allow me\nthe honour of giving you my arm.'\n\n'If you please,' said she, in a low voice. And supposing that Godolphin\nwould be glad to have some conversation with his brother, she accepted\nhis assistance and proceeded.\n\nThis preference, however, of Bellozane, Godolphin imputed to her\ncoldness or dislike towards himself; and so struck was he with the cruel\nidea, that it was not without an effort he recollected himself enough to\nrelate to his brother, as they walked, all that it was necessary for him\nto know. Lord Westhaven, anxious for a life so precious to his wife and\nher family as was that of Lord Delamere, determined immediately to go to\nhim. At present it was necessary to reveal as tenderly as possible his\nsituation to his sister, Lady Westhaven; and first to dissipate the\nuneasiness she had suffered from the long absence of Emmeline.\n\n[Footnote 36: Stay, stay a moment, ladies! Have the goodness to tell me\nwhether you belong to the family of the Baron de St. Alpin?]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nLord Westhaven first entered the room where his wife was, whose alarming\napprehensions at Emmeline's long stay were by this time extreme.\n\n'Our Emmeline is returned, my love,' said he, 'and has met with no\naccident.'\n\nLady Westhaven eagerly embracing her, reproached her tenderly for her\nlong absence. But then observing how pale she looked, and the fatigue\nand oppression she seemed to suffer, her Ladyship said--\n\n'Surely you have been frightened--or you are ill? You look so faint!'\n\n'She is a little surprised,' interrupted Lord Westhaven, seeing her\nstill unable to answer for herself. 'She has brought us a visitor whom\nwe did not expect. My brother Godolphin landed just as she was returning\nhome.'\n\nAt this intelligence Lady Westhaven could express only pleasure. She had\nnever seen Godolphin, who was now introduced, and received with every\ntoken of regard by her Ladyship, as well as by the Baron and Mrs. St.\nAlpin; who beheld with pleasure another son of their sister, and beheld\nhim an honour to their family.\n\nBellozane, however, saw his arrival with less satisfaction. He\nremembered that Emmeline had been, as she had told him, well acquainted\nwith Godolphin in England; and recollected that whenever he had been\nspoken of, she had always done justice to his merit, yet rather evaded\nthan sought the conversation. Her extraordinary agitation on his\narrival, which was such as disabled her from walking home, seemed much\ngreater than could have been created by the sight of a mere\nacquaintance; his figure was so uncommonly handsome, his countenance so\ninteresting, and his address such a fortunate mixture of dignity and\nsoftness, that Bellozane, vain as he was, could not but acknowledge his\npersonal merit; and began to fear that the coldness and insensibility of\nEmmeline, which he had, till now, supposed perseverance would vanquish,\nwere less occasioned by her affected blindness to his own perfections,\nthan by her prepossession in favour of another.\n\nWhatever internal displeasure this idea of rivalry gave the Chevalier,\nhe overwhelmed Godolphin with professions of regard and esteem, not the\nless warm for being wholly insincere.\n\nBut Godolphin, who saw, in the encreasing dejection of Emmeline, only a\nconfirmation of her attachment to Delamere, drooped in hopeless\ndespondence. Emmeline, unable to support herself, retired early to her\nroom; and Godolphin, complaining of fatigue, was conducted to his by\nBellozane; while Lord Westhaven meditated how to disclose to his wife,\nwithout too much distressing her, the illness of her brother. He\nthought, that as she had suffered a good deal of vexation in the course\nof the day, as well as terror at Emmeline's absence at so late an hour\nin the evening, he would defer till the next morning this unwelcome\nintelligence. As soon, however, as she was retired, he communicated to\nhis uncle and aunt the situation of Lord Delamere, and the necessity\nthere was for their quitting St. Alpin the next day, to attend him; an\naccount which they both heard with sincere regret. Mrs. St. Alpin\nheartily wished Lord Delamere was with _her_, being persuaded she could\nimmediately cure him with remedies of her own preparing; while the Baron\nexpressed his vexation and regret to find the visit of his nephews so\nmuch shortened.\n\nLord Westhaven went to his own apartment in great uneasiness. He heard\nfrom his brother, that Lord Delamere, repenting of his renunciation of\nEmmeline, was coming to St. Alpin, when illness stopped him at Besan\u00c3\u00a7on.\nHe knew not how to act about her; who, heiress to a large fortune, was\nof so much more consequence than she had been hitherto supposed. He had\na long contention in view with Lord Montreville; and was now likely to\nbe embarrassed with the passion of Delamere, if he recovered, (who would\ncertainly expect his influence over Emmeline to be exerted to obtain his\npardon); or if the event of his illness should prove fatal, he dreaded\nthe anguish of Lady Westhaven and the despair of the whole family.\n\nHe was besides hurt at that melancholy and unhappy appearance, so unlike\nhis former manners, which he had observed in Godolphin; and for which,\nignorant of his passion for Emmeline, he knew not how to account. His\nshort conversation with him had cleared up no part of the mystery which\nhe could not but perceive hung about the affairs of Lady Adelina; and he\nonly knew enough to discover that something remained which it would\nprobably pain him to know thoroughly.\n\nThe pillow of Emmeline also was strewn with thorns. For tho' the\nsharpest of them was removed, by having heard that Delamere was ill\nwithout having suffered from the event of any dispute in which he might\non her account have engaged, she was extremely unhappy that he had, in\npursuit of her, come to France, which she now concluded must be the\ncase, and sorry for the disquiet which she foresaw must arise from his\nindisposition and his love.\n\nShe was sure that Lady Westhaven would immediately fly to her brother.\nAnd in that event how was she herself to act?\n\nCould she suffer her generous, her tender friend, to whom she was so\nmuch obliged, to encounter alone all the fatigue and anxiety to which\nthe sickness and danger of this beloved brother would probably expose\nher? Yet could she submit to the appearance of seeking a man who had so\nlately renounced her for ever, with coldness, contempt, and insult? If\nshe went not with Lady Westhaven, she had no choice but that of\ntravelling across France alone, to rejoin Mrs. Stafford; since she could\nnot remain with propriety a moment at St. Alpin, with the Chevalier de\nBellozane; whose addresses she never meant to encourage, and whose\nimportunate passion persecuted and distressed her. Godolphin\ntoo!--whither would Godolphin go? Could she go where he was, and conceal\nher partiality? or could she, by accompanying him to Besan\u00c3\u00a7on, plunge\nanother dagger in the heart of Delamere, and shew him, not only that he\nhad lost that portion of her regard he had once possessed, but that all\nher love was now given to another.\n\nThat she was most partial to Godolphin, she could no longer attempt to\nconceal from herself. The moment her fears that he had met Delamere\nhostilely were removed, all her tenderness for him returned with new\nforce. She again saw all the merit, all the nobleness of his character;\nbut she still tormented herself with uneasy conjectures as to the cause\nof his journey to Switzerland; and wearied herself with considering how\nshe ought to act, 'till towards morning, when falling, thro' mere\nfatigue and lassitude, into a short slumber, she saw multiplied and\nexaggerated, in dreams, the dreadful images which had disturbed her\nwaking; and starting up in terror, determined no more to attempt to\nsleep. It was now day break; and wrapping herself in her muslin morning\ngown and cloak, she went down into the garden of Mrs. St. Alpin, where,\nseated on a bench, under a row of tall walnut trees, which divided it\nfrom the vineyard, she leaned her head against one of them; and lost in\nreflections on the strangeness of her fate, and the pain of her\nsituation, she neither saw or heard any thing around her.\n\nGodolphin, in the anxiety she had expressed for Delamere, believed he\nsaw a confirmation of his fears; which had always been that the early\nimpression he had made on her heart would be immoveable, and that\nneither his having renounced her or his rash and heedless temper would\nprevent her continuing to love him. Wretched in this idea, he concluded\nall hopes of obtaining her regard for ever at an end; while every hour's\nexperience of his own feelings, whether he thought of or saw her,\nconvinced him that his love, however desperate, was incurable.\nAccustomed to fatigue, all that he had endured the day before could not\nrestore to him that repose which was driven away by these reflections.\nAlmost as soon as he saw it was light, he left his room, and with less\ninterest than he would once have taken in such a survey, wandered over\nthe antique apartments of the paternal house of his mother. He then went\ndown into the garden; and musing rather than observing, passed along the\nstrait walk that went between the walnut trees into the vineyard. At the\nend of it he turned, and, in coming again towards the house, saw\nEmmeline sitting on the bench beneath them, who had not seen him the\nfirst time he passed her, but who now appeared surprised at his\napproach.\n\nShe had not, however, time to rise before he went up to her, and bowing\ngravely, enquired how she did after the alarm he had been so unfortunate\nas to give her the evening before?\n\n'I fear,' said he, seating himself by her, 'that Miss Mowbray is yet\nindisposed from her late walk and my inconsiderate address to her. I\nknow not how to forgive myself for my indiscretion, since it has\ndistressed you.'\n\n'Such intelligence as I had the misfortune of hearing, Sir, of the\nbrother of Lady Westhaven--a brother so dear to her--could hardly fail\nof affecting me. I should have been concerned had a stranger been so\ncircumstanced; but when--'\n\n'Ah! Madam,' interrupted Godolphin, 'you need not repeat all the claims\nwhich give the fortunate Delamere a right to your favour. But do not\nsuffer yourself, on his account, to be so extremely alarmed. I hope the\ndanger is by no means so great as to make his recovery hopeless. Since\nof those we love, the most minute account is not tedious, and since it\nmay, perhaps, alleviate your apprehensions for his safety, will you\nallow me to relate all I know of his illness! It will engage me,\nperhaps, in a detail of our first acquaintance, and carry me back to\ncircumstances which I would wish to forget; if your gratification was\nnot in my mind a consideration superior to every other.'\n\nEmmeline, trembling, yet wishing to hear all, could not refuse. She\nbowed in silence; and Godolphin considering that as an assent, reassumed\nhis discourse.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n'Soon after I had the happiness of seeing you last, my wish to embrace\nLady Clancarryl and her family (from whose house I had been long obliged\nto absent myself because Mr. Fitz-Edward was with them) carried me to\nIreland; and to my astonishment I there met Lord Delamere.\n\n'The relationship between their families, made my sister anxiously\ninvite him to Lough Carryl. Thither reluctantly he came; and an accident\ninformed him that I had the good fortune, by means of Lady Adelina\nTrelawny, to be known to you.\n\n'He did me the honour to shew me particular attention; and the morning\nafter he found I had the happiness of being acquainted with Miss\nMowbray, he took occasion, when we were alone, to ask me, abruptly,\nwhether I knew Colonel Fitz-Edward? I answered that I certainly did, by\nthe connection in our families; and that he was once my most intimate\nfriend.\n\n'He then unreservedly, and with vehemence said, that Fitz-Edward was a\nvillain! Astonished and hurt at an assertion which (how true soever it\nmight be) I thought alluded to that unhappy affair which I hoped was a\nsecret, I eagerly asked an explanation. But judge, Miss Mowbray, of the\nastonishment, the pain, with which I heard him impute to you the error\nof my unfortunate Adelina--when I saw him take out three anonymous\nletters, one of which I found had hastened his return from France,\npurporting that Fitz-Edward had availed himself of his absence to win\nyour affections, that he had taken, of those affections, the most\nungenerous advantage, and that on going to a place named (which I\nremembered to be the house where my little William was nursed,) he might\nhimself see an unequivocal proof of your fatal attachment and\nFitz-Edward's perfidy.\n\n'When I had read these odious letters, and listened to several\ncircumstances he related, which confirmed in his apprehension the truth\nof the assertions they contained, he went on to inform me, that\nfollowing this cruel information, he had seen you with the infant in\nyour arms; had bitterly reproached you, and then had quitted you for\never!--But as he could not rest without trying to punish the infamous\nconduct of Fitz-Edward, he had pursued him to Ireland, where, instead of\nfinding him, he heard that he was gone to France, undoubtedly to meet\nyou, by your own appointment; but as Lord Clancarryl still expected him\nback, he determined to wait a little longer, in hopes of an opportunity\nof discussing with him the subjects of complaint he had related.\n\n'Tho' I immediately saw what I ought to do, astonishment for a moment\nkept me silent, and in that moment we were interrupted.\n\n'This delay, however unwelcome, gave me time for reflection. Lord\nDelamere was to go the same day from Lough Carryl to Dublin. I resolved\nto follow him thither, and relate the whole truth; since I would by no\nmeans suffer your generous and exalted friendship for my sister to stain\nthe lovely purity of a character which only the malice of fiends could\ndelight in blasting, only the blind and infatuated rashness of jealousy\na moment believe capable of blemish! Many reasons induced me, however,\nto delay this necessary explanation 'till I saw him at his own lodgings.\nThither I followed him, two days after he departed from Lough Carryl.\nBut on enquiring for him, was surprised and mortified to find that he\nhad received letters from England which had induced him immediately to\nreturn thither, and that he had sailed in the packet for Holyhead the\nday after his arrival at Dublin.'\n\nEmmeline, astonished at the malice which appeared to have been exerted\nagainst her, remained silent; but in such tremor, that it was with\ndifficulty she continued to hear him.\n\n'I now, therefore, relinquished all thoughts of returning to the house\nof my sister, and followed him by the first conveyance that offered,\ngreatly apprehending, that if the letters he had received gave him\nnotice of Fitz-Edward's return to London, my interposition would be too\nlate to prevent their meeting. I knew the hasty and inconsiderate\nDelamere would, without an explanation, so conduct himself towards\nFitz-Edward, that neither his spirit or his profession would permit him\nto bear; and that if they met, the consequence must, to one of them, be\nfatal. I was impatient too to rescue your name, Madam, from the\nunmerited aspersions which it bore. But when I arrived in London, and\nhastened to Berkley-Square, I heard that Lord and Lady Montreville,\ntogether with Lady Frances Crofts, her husband, and Lord Delamere, had\ngone all together to Audley Hall, immediately after his return from\nIreland. Thither, therefore, I went also.'\n\n'Generous, considerate Godolphin!' sighed Emmeline to herself.\n\n'Tho' related, by my brother's marriage, to the family of the Marquis of\nMontreville, I was a stranger to every member of it but Lord Delamere.\nHe was gone to dine out; and in the rest of the family I observed an air\nof happiness and triumph, which Lord Montreville informed me was\noccasioned by the marriage which was intended soon to take place between\nhis son and Miss Otley; whose immense fortune, and near relationship to\nhis mother's family, had made such a marriage particularly desirable. I\nwas glad to hear he was likely to be happy; but it was not therefore the\nless necessary to clear up the error into which he had fallen. On his\ncoming home, he appeared pleased and surprised to see me; but I saw in\nhis looks none of that satisfaction which was so evident in those of the\nrest of the house.\n\n'As soon as we were alone, he said to me--\"You see me, Mr. Godolphin, at\nlength taken in the toils. Immediately after leaving Lough Carryl, I\nreceived a letter from a person in London, whom I had employed for that\npurpose, which informed me that he heard, at the office of the agent to\nFitz-Edward's regiment, that he was certainly to be in town in a few\ndays. He named, indeed, the exact time; and I, who imagined that pains\nhad been taken to keep us from meeting, determined to return to England\ninstantly, that he might not again avoid me. On reaching London,\nhowever, I found that the intelligence I had received was wholly\nunfounded, and originated in the mistake of a clerk in the agent's\noffice. None knew where Fitz-Edward was, or when he would return; and\nthough I wrote to enquire at Rouen, where I imagined the residence of\nMiss Mowbray might induce him to remain, I have yet had no answer. The\nentreaties and tears of my mother prevailed on me to come down hither;\nand reckless of what becomes of me, since Emmeline is undoubtedly lost\nto me for ever, I have yielded to the remonstrance of my father and the\nprayers of my mother, and have consented to marry a woman whom I cannot\nlove. Let not Fitz-Edward, however, imagine,\" (vehemently and fiercely\nhe spoke) \"that he is with impunity to escape; and that tho' my\nvengeance may be delayed, I can _forgive_ the man who has basely robbed\nme of her whom I _could_ love--whom I _did_ love--even to madness!\"\n\n'I own to you, Madam, that when I found this unfortunate young man had\nput into his father's hands the promise you had given him, and that it\nwas returned to you, I felt at once pity for him, and--hope for myself,\nwhich, 'till then, I had never dared to indulge.'\n\nGodolphin had never been thus explicit before. Pale as death, and\ndeprived of the power as well as of the inclination to interrupt him,\nEmmeline awaited, in breathless silence, the close of this extraordinary\nnarrative.\n\n'It was now,' reassumed he, 'my turn to speak. And trusting to his\nhonour for his silence about my unhappy sister, I revealed to him the\nwhole truth. I at once cleared your character from unjust blame, and, I\nhope, did justice to those exalted virtues to which I owe so much. I\nwill not shock your gentle and generous bosom with a relation of the\nwild phrenzy, the agonies of regret and repentance, into which this\nrelation threw Lord Delamere. Concerned at the confusion his reproaches\nand his anguish had occasioned to the whole family, I lamented that I\ncould not explain to _them_ what I had said to _him_, which had produced\nso sudden a change in his sentiments about you; but to such women as the\nMarchioness of Montreville and her daughter, I could not relate the\nunhappiness of my poor Adelina; and Delamere steadily refused to tell\nthem how he became convinced of your innocence, and the wicked arts\nwhich had been used to mislead him; which he openly imputed to the\nfamily of the Crofts', against whom his fiery and vindictive spirit\nturned all the rage it had till now cherished against Fitz-Edward.\n\n'The Marquis, tho' extremely hurt, had yet candour enough to own, that\nif I was convinced that the causes of complaint which his son had\nagainst you were ill founded, I had done well in removing them. Yet I\nsaw that he wished I had been less anxious for the vindication of\ninnocence; and he beheld, with an uneasy and suspicious eye, what he\nthought officious interference in the affairs of his family. I observed,\ntoo, that he believed when the influence that he supposed I had over the\nmind of Lord Delamere was removed, he should be able to bring him back\nto his engagements with Miss Otley, which had, I found, been hurried on\nwith the utmost precipitation. The ladies, who had at first overwhelmed\nme with civilities, now appeared so angry, that notwithstanding Lord\nDelamere's entreaties that I would stay with him till he could determine\nhow to act, I immediately returned to London; and from thence, after\npassing a week with Adelina, whom I had only seen for a few hours since\nmy return from Ireland, I set out for St. Alpin.'\n\n'But Lord Delamere, Sir?' said Emmeline, inarticulately.\n\n'Alas! Madam,' dejectedly continued Godolphin, 'I mean not to entertain\nyou on what relates to myself; but to hasten to that which I farther\nhave to say of the fortunate Delamere! I waited a few days at\nSouthampton for a wind; and then landing at Havre, proceeded to St.\nGermains, where Mrs. Stafford's last letters had informed Adelina she\nwas settled. I knew, too, that you were gone with my brother and Lady\nWesthaven to St. Alpin. Mrs. Stafford had only the day before forwarded\nto you Lord Montreville's letter, which, by one from his Lordship to\nherself, she knew contained the promise you had given Lord Delamere. She\nsaid, that this renunciation would give you no pain. She made me hope\nthat your heart was not irrevocably his. Ah! why did I suffer such\nillusions to lead me on to this conviction! But pray forgive me, lovely\nMiss Mowbray! I am still talking of myself. From St. Germains I made as\nmuch haste as possible to Besan\u00c3\u00a7on. I rode post; and, just as I got off\nmy horse at the hotel, was accosted by a French servant, whom I knew\nbelonged to Lord Delamere.\n\n'The man expressed great joy at seeing me, and besought me to go with\nhim to his master, who, he said, had, thro' fatigue and the heat of the\nweather, been seized with a fever, and was unable to proceed to St.\nAlpin, whither he was going.\n\n'I was extremely concerned at his journey; and, I hope, not so selfish\nas to be unmoved by his illness. I found, indeed, his fever very high,\nbut greatly irritated and encreased by his impatience. As soon as he saw\nme, he told me that he was hurrying to St. Alpin, in hopes of obtaining\nyour pardon; that he had broke off his engagement with Miss Otley, and\nnever would return to England till he carried you thither as his wife.\n\n'\"I am now well enough to go on, indeed Godolphin,\" added he, \"and if I\ncan but see her!----\"\n\n'I was by no means of opinion that he was in a condition to travel. His\nfever encreased; after I left him in the evening, he grew delirious; and\nMillefleur, terrified, came to call me to him. I sat up with him for\nthe rest of the night; and being accustomed to attend invariably to the\nillness of men on ship board, I thought I might venture, from my\nexperience, to direct a change in the method which the physician he had\nsent for pursued. In a few hours he grew better, and the delirium left\nhim; but he was then convinced that he was too weak to proceed on his\njourney.\n\n'He knew I was coming hither, and he entreated me to hasten my\ndeparture. \"Go, my good friend,\" said he--\"send Augusta to me. She will\nbring with her the generous, the forgiving angel, whom my rash folly has\ndared to injure! She will behold my penitence; and, if her pardon can be\nobtained, it will restore me to life; but if I cannot see them--if I\nlinger many days longer in suspence, my illness must be fatal!\"\n\n'As I really did not think him in great danger, and saw every proper\ncare was now taken of him, determined to come on; not only because I\nwished to save Lady Westhaven the pain of hearing of his illness by any\nother means, but because--'\n\nHe was proceeding, when a deep and convulsive sigh from Emmeline made\nhim look in her face, from which he had hitherto kept his eyes, (unable\nto bear the varying expressions it had shewn of what he thought her\nconcern for Delamere.) He now beheld her, quite pale, motionless, and to\nall appearance lifeless. Her sense of what she owed to the generosity of\nGodolphin; her concern for Delamere; and the dread of those contending\npassions which she foresaw would embitter her future life, added to the\nsleepless night and fatigueing day she had passed, had totally overcome\nher. Godolphin flew for assistance. The servants were by this time up,\nand ran to her. Among the first of them was Le Limosin, who expressed\ninfinite anxiety and concern for her, and assiduously exerted himself in\ncarrying her into the house; where she soon recovered, begged\nGodolphin's pardon for the trouble she had given, and was going to her\nown room, led by Madelon, when Bellozane suddenly appeared, and offered\nhis assistance, which Emmeline faintly declining, moved on.\n\nGodolphin, who could not bear to leave her in such a state, walked\nslowly by her, tho' she had refused his arm. The expression of his\ncountenance, while his eyes were eagerly fixed on her face, would have\ninformed any one less interested than Bellozane, of what passed in his\nheart; and the Chevalier surveyed him with looks of angry observation,\nwhich did not escape Emmeline, ill as she was. On arriving, therefore,\nat the foot of the staircase, she besought, in English, Godolphin to\nleave her, which he instantly did. She then told the Chevalier that she\nwould by no means trouble him to attend her farther; and he, satisfied\nthat no preference was shewn to his cousin, at least in this instance,\nbowed, and returned with him into the room where they usually assembled\nin a morning, and where they found Lord Westhaven.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nHis Lordship told them that Lady Westhaven had been less alarmed at the\naccount he had given her of Delamere than he had apprehended; and that\nshe was preparing to begin their journey towards him immediately after\nbreakfast.\n\n'I must send,' continued he, 'Miss Mowbray to her; who is, I understand,\nalready up and walking.'\n\nBellozane then informed his Lordship of what he knew of Emmeline. But\nGodolphin was silent: he dared not trust himself with speaking much of\nher; he dared not relate her illness, lest the cause of it should be\nenquired into. 'Does Miss Mowbray go with my sister?' asked he.\n\n'That I know not,' replied Lord Westhaven. 'Augusta will very\nreluctantly go without her. Yet her situation in regard to Lord Delamere\nis such'--He ceased speaking; looked embarrassed; and, soon after, the\nChevalier quitting the room, before whom civility would not allow them\nto converse long in English, and to whom his Lordship thought he had no\nright to reveal the real situation of Emmeline, while it yet remained\nunknown to others, he related to his brother the circumstances of the\ndiscovery that had been made of her birth, and of her consequent claim\nto the Mowbray estate.\n\nGodolphin, who would, from the obscurest indigence, have chosen her in\npreference to all other women, heard this account with pleasure, only as\nsupposing that independance might be grateful to her sensibility, and\naffluence favourable to the liberality of her spirit. But the\nsatisfaction he derived from these reflections, was embittered and\nnearly destroyed, when he considered, that her acquiring so large a\nfortune would make her alliance eagerly sought by the very persons who\nhad before scorned and rejected her; and that all the family would unite\nin persuading her to forgive Delamere, the more especially as this would\nbe the only means to keep in it the Mowbray estate, and to preclude the\nnecessity of refunding the income which had been received for so many\nyears, and which now amounted to a great sum of money. When the pressing\ninstances of all her own family, and particularly of Lady Westhaven,\nwhom she so tenderly loved, were added to the affection he believed she\nhad invariably felt for Delamere, he thought it impossible that her\npride, however it might have been piqued by the desertion of her lover,\ncould make any effort against a renewal of her engagement; and his own\nhopes, which he had never cherished till he was convinced Delamere had\ngiven her up, and which had been weakened by her apparent affection for\nhim, were by this last event again so nearly annihilated, that, no\nlonger conscious he retained any, he fancied himself condemned still to\nlove, serve, and adore the object of his passion, without making any\neffort to secure it's success, or being permitted to appear otherwise\nthan as her friend. He was vexed that he had been unguardedly explicit,\nin telling her that he had ever indulged those hopes at all; since he\nnow feared it would be the means of depriving her conversation and her\nmanner, when they were together, of that charming frankness, of which,\ntho' it rivetted his chains and encreased his torments, he could not\nbear to be deprived. Melancholy and desponding, he continued long silent\nafter Lord Westhaven ceased speaking. Suddenly, however, awakening from\nhis reverie, he said--'Does your Lordship think Miss Mowbray _ought_ to\ngo to meet Lord Delamere?'\n\n'Upon my word I know not how to advise: my wife is miserable without\nher, and fancies the sight of her will immediately restore Delamere. On\nthe other hand, I believe Emmeline herself will with reluctance take a\nstep that will perhaps, appear like forcing herself into the notice of a\nman from whom she has received an affront which it is hardly in female\nnature to forgive.'\n\nThey were now interrupted by Bellozane, who flew about the house in\nevident uneasiness and confusion. He did not yet know how Emmeline was\nto be disposed of: he saw that Lord Westhaven was himself uncertain of\nit; and he had been applying for information to Le Limosin and Madelon,\nwho had yet received no orders to prepare for her departure.\n\nWhile Emmeline had created in the bosoms of others so much anxiety, she\nwas herself tortured with the cruellest uncertainty. Unable to resolve\nhow she ought to act, she had yet determined on nothing, when Lady\nWesthaven sent for her, who, as soon as she entered the room, said--'My\ndear Emmeline, are you not preparing for our journey?'\n\n'How can I, dearest Madam--how can I, with any propriety, go where Lord\nDelamere is? After the separation which has now so decidedly and\nirrevocably taken place between us, shall I intrude again on his\nLordship's sight? and solicit a return of that regard with which I most\nsincerely wish he had forborne to honour me?'\n\n'You are piqued, my lovely friend; and I own with great reason. But Mr.\nGodolphin has undoubtedly told you that poor Frederic is truly penitent;\nthat he has taken this journey merely to deprecate your just anger and\nto solicit his pardon. Will my Emmeline, generous and gentle as she is\nto others, be inexorable only to him? Besides, my sweet coz, pray\nconsider a moment, what else can you do? You certainly would not wish to\nstay here? Surely you would not travel alone to St. Germains. And let me\nadd my own hopes that you will not quit me now, when poor Frederic's\nillness, and my own precarious health, make your company not merely\npleasant but necessary.'\n\n'That is indeed a consideration which must have great force with me.\nWhen Lady Westhaven commands, how shall I disobey, even tho' to obey be\ndirectly contrary to my judgment and my wishes.'\n\n'Commands, my dear friend,' very gravely, and with an air of chagrin,\nsaid her Ladyship, 'are neither for me to give or for you to receive.\nCertainly if you are so determined against going with me, I must submit.\nBut I did not indeed think that Emmeline, however the brother may have\noffended her, would thus have resented it to the sister.'\n\n'I should be a monster, Lady Westhaven,' (hardly was she able to\nrestrain her tears as she spoke,)--'was I a moment capable of forgetting\nall I owe you. But do you really think I _ought_ again to put myself in\nthe way of Lord Delamere--again to renew all the family contention which\nhis very unfortunate partiality for me has already occasioned; and again\nto hazard being repulsed with contempt by the Marquis, and still more\nprobably by the Marchioness of Montreville. My lot has hitherto been\nhumble: I have learned to submit to it, if not without regret, at least\nwith calmness and resignation; yet pardon me if I say, that however\nunhappy my fortune, there is still something due to myself; and if I\nagain make myself liable to the humiliation of being _refused_, I shall\nfeel that I am degraded in mind, as much as I have been in\ncircumstances, and lost to that proper pride to which innocence and\nrectitude has in the lowest indigence a right, and which cannot be\nrelinquished but with the loss of virtue.'\n\nThe spirit which Emmeline thought herself obliged to exert, was\nimmediately lost in softness and in sorrow when she beheld Lady\nWesthaven in tears; who, sobbing, said--'Go then, Miss Mowbray!--Go, my\ndear Emmeline! (for dear you must ever be to me) leave _me_ to be\nunhappy and poor Frederic to die.'\n\n'Hear me, my dear Madam!' answered she with quickness--'If to _you_ I\ncan be of the least use, I will hesitate no longer; but let it then be\nunderstood that I go _with_ you, and by no means _to_ Lord Delamere.'\n\n'It shall be so understood--be assured, my love, it shall! You will not,\nthen, leave me?--You will see my poor brother?'\n\n'My best, my dearest friend,' replied Emmeline, collecting all her\nfortitude, 'hear me without resentment explain to you at once the real\nsituation of my heart in regard to Lord Delamere. I feel for him the\ntruest concern; I feel it for him even to a painful excess; and I have\nan affection for him, a sisterly affection for him, which I really\nbelieve is little inferior to your own. But I will not deceive you; nor,\nsince I am to meet him, will I suffer him to entertain hopes that it is\nimpossible for me to fulfil. To be considered as the friend, as the\nsister of Lord Delamere, is one of the first wishes my heart now\nforms--against ever being his wife, I am resolutely determined.'\n\n'Impossible!--Surely you cannot have made such a resolution?'\n\n'I have indeed!--Nor will any consideration on earth induce me from that\ndetermination to recede.'\n\n'And is it anger and resentment only have raised in your heart this\ndecided enmity to my poor brother? Or is it, that any other----'\n\nEmmeline, whose colourless cheeks were suffused with a deep blush at\nthis speech, hastily interrupted it.--\n\n'Whatever, dear Lady Westhaven, are my motives for the decision, it is\nirrevocable; as Lord Delamere's sister, I shall be honoured, if I am\nallowed to consider myself.--As such, if my going with you to Besan\u00c3\u00a7on\nwill give you a day's--an hour's satisfaction, I go.'\n\n'Get ready then, my love. But indeed, cruel girl, if such is your\nresolution it were better to leave you here, than take you only to shew\nLord Delamere all he has lost, while you deprive him of all hopes of\nregaining you. But I will yet flatter myself you do not mean all\nthis.--\"At lovers' perjuries they say Jove laughs.\"--And those of my\nfair cousin will be forgiven, should she break her angry vow and receive\nher poor penitent. Come, let us hasten to begin our journey to him; for\ntho' that dear Godolphin, whom I shall love as long as I live,' (ah!\nthought Emmeline, and so shall I) 'assures me he does not think him in\nany danger, my heart will sadly ache till I see him myself.'\n\nEmmeline then left her to put up her cloaths and prepare for a journey\nto which she was determined solely by the pressing instances of Lady\nWesthaven. To herself she foresaw only uneasiness and embarrassment; and\neven found a degree of cruelty in permitting Lord Delamere to feed, by\nher consenting to attend him, those hopes to which she now could never\naccede, unless by condemning herself to the most wretched of all\nlots--that of marrying one man while her love was another's. The late\nnarrative which she had heard from Godolphin, encreased her affection\nfor him, and took from her every wish to oppose it's progress; and tho'\nshe was thus compelled to see Delamere, she determined not to deceive\nhim, but to tell him ingenuously that he had lost all that tenderness\nwhich her friendship and long acquaintance with him would have induced\nher to cherish, had not his own conduct destroyed it--\n\nBut it was hardly less necessary to own to him part of the truth, than\nto conceal the rest. Should he suspect that Godolphin was his rival, and\na rival fondly favoured, she knew that his pride, his jealousy, his\nresentment, would hurry him into excesses more dreadful, than any that\nhad yet followed his impetuous love or his unbridled passions.\n\nThe apprehensions that he must, if they were long together, discover it,\nwere more severely distressing than any she had yet felt; and she\nresolved, both now and when they reached Besan\u00c3\u00a7on, to keep the strictest\nguard on her words and looks; and to prevent if possible her real\nsentiments being known to Delamere, to Lady Westhaven, and to Godolphin\nhimself.\n\nSo painful and so difficult appeared the dissimulation necessary for\nthat end; and so contrary did she feel it to her nature, that she was\nwithheld only by her love to Lady Westhaven from flying to England with\nMrs. Stafford; and should she be restored to her estate, she thought\nthat the only chance she had of tranquillity would be to hide herself\nfrom Delamere, whom she at once pitied and dreaded, and from Godolphin,\nwhom she tenderly loved, in the silence and seclusion of Mowbray Castle.\n\nHer embarrassment and uneasiness were encreased, when, on her joining\nLord and Lady Westhaven, whose carriages and baggage were now ready, she\nfound that the Chevalier de Bellozane had insisted on escorting them; an\noffer which they had no pretence to refuse. On her taking leave of the\nBaron, he very warmly and openly recommended his son to her favour; and\nMrs. St. Alpin, who was very fond of her, repeated her wishes that she\nwould listen to her nephew; and both with unfeigned concern saw their\nEnglish visitors depart. Captain Godolphin had a place in his brother's\nchaise; Madelon occupied that which on the former journey was filled by\nBellozane in the coach, the Chevalier now proceeding on horseback.\n\nDuring the journey, Emmeline was low and dejected; from which she was\nsometimes roused by impatient enquiries and fearful apprehensions which\ndarted into her mind, of what was to happen at the end of it. Every\nthing he observed, confirmed Godolphin in his persuasion that her heart\nwas wholly Delamere's: her behaviour to himself was civil, but even\nstudiously distant; while the unreserved and ardent addresses of\nBellozane, who made no mystery of his pretensions, she repulsed with yet\nmore coldness and severity: and tho' towards Lord and Lady Westhaven the\nsweetness of her manners was yet preserved, she seemed overwhelmed with\nsadness, and her vivacity was quite lost.\n\nAs soon as they reached Besan\u00c3\u00a7on, Lord Westhaven directed the carriages\nto stop at another hotel, while he went with his brother to that where\nLord Delamere was. At the door, they met Millefleur; who, overjoyed to\nsee them, related, that since Mr. Godolphin left his master the violence\nof his impatience had occasioned a severe relapse, in which, according\nto the orders Mr. Godolphin had given, the surgeons had bled and\nblistered him; that he was now again better, but very weak; yet so\nextremely ungovernable and self-willed, that the French people who\nattended him could do nothing with him, and that his English footmen,\nand Millefleur himself, were forced to be constantly in his room to\nprevent his leaving it or committing some other excess that might again\nirritate the fever and bring on alarming symptoms. They hastened to him;\nand found not only that his fever still hung on him, tho' with less\nviolence, but that he was also extremely emaciated; and that only his\nyouth had supported him thro' so severe an illness, or could now enable\nhim to struggle with it's effects.\n\nThe moment they entered the room, he enquired after his sister and\nEmmeline; and hearing the latter was actually come, he protested he\nwould instantly go to her.\n\nLord Westhaven and Godolphin resolutely opposed so indiscreet a plan:\nthe former, by his undeviating rectitude of mind and excellent sense,\nhad acquired a greater ascendant over Delamere than any of his family\nhad before possessed; and to the latter he thought himself so much\nobliged, that he could not refuse to attend to him. He consented\ntherefore at length to remain where he was; and Lord Westhaven hastened\nback to his wife, whom he led immediately to her brother.\n\nShe embraced him with many tears; and was at first greatly shocked at\nhis altered countenance and reduced figure. But as Lord Westhaven and\nGodolphin both assured her there was no longer any danger if he would\nconsent to be governed, she was soothed into hope of his speedy recovery\nand soon became tolerably composed.\n\nAs Lord Westhaven and Godolphin soon left them alone, he began to talk\nto his sister of Emmeline. He told her, that when he had been undeceived\nby Mr. Godolphin, and the scandalous artifices discovered which had\nraised in his mind such injurious suspicions, he had declared to Lord\nand Lady Montreville his resolution to proceed no farther in the treaty\nwhich they had hurried on with Miss Otley, and had solicited their\nconsent, to his renewing and fulfilling that, which he had before\nentered into with Miss Mowbray; but that his mother, with more anger and\nacrimony than ever, had strongly opposed his wishes; and that his father\nhad forbidden him, on pain of his everlasting displeasure, ever again to\nthink of Emmeline.\n\nAfter having for some time, he said, combated their inveterate\nprejudice, he had left them abruptly, and set out with his three\nservants for St. Alpin, (where Godolphin informed him Emmeline was to\nbe;) when a fever, owing to heat and fatigue, seized and confined him\nwhere he now was.\n\n'Ah, tell me, my sister, what hopes are there that Emmeline will pardon\nme? May I dare enquire whether she is yet to be moved in my favour?'\n\nLady Westhaven, who during their journey could perceive no symptoms that\nher resolution was likely to give way, dared not feed him with false\nhopes; yet unwilling to depress him by saying all she feared, she told\nhim that Emmeline was greatly and with justice offended; but that all he\ncould at present do, was to take care of his health. She entreated him\nto consider the consequence of another relapse, which might be brought\non by his eagerness and emotion; and then conjuring him to keep all he\nknew of Lady Adelina a secret from Lord Westhaven (the necessity of\nwhich he already had heard from Godolphin) she left him and returned to\nEmmeline.\n\nTo avoid the importunity of Bellozane, and the melancholy looks of\nGodolphin, which affected her with the tenderest sorrow, she had retired\nto a bed chamber, where she waited the return of Lady Westhaven with\nimpatience.\n\nHer solicitude for Delamere was very great; and her heart greatly\nlightened when she found that even his tender and apprehensive sister\ndid not think him in any immediate danger, and believed that a few days\nwould put him out of hazard even of a relapse.\n\nShe now again thought, that since Lady Westhaven had nothing to fear for\nhis life, her presence would be less necessary; and her mind, the longer\nit thought of Mowbray Castle, adhering with more fondness to her plan of\nflying thither, she considered how she might obtain in a few days Lady\nWesthaven's consent to the preliminary measure of quitting Besan\u00c3\u00a7on.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nWhile the heiress of Mowbray Castle meditated how to escape thither from\nthe embarrassed and uneasy situation in which she now was; and while she\nfancied that in retirement she might conceal, if she could not conquer,\nher affection for Godolphin, (tho' in fact she only languished for an\nopportunity of thinking of him perpetually without observation), Lady\nWesthaven laid in wait for an occasion to try whether the ruined health\nand altered looks of her brother, would not move, in his favour, her\ntender and sensible friend.\n\nWhile Delamere kept his chamber, Emmeline easily evaded an interview;\nbut when, after three or four days, he was well enough to leave it, it\nwas no longer possible for her to escape seeing him. However Godolphin\nthought himself obliged to bury in silence his unfortunate passion, he\ncould not divest himself of that painful curiosity which urged him to\nobserve the behaviour of Emmeline on their first meeting. Bellozane had\ndiscovered on what footing Lord Delamere had formerly been; and he\ndreaded a renewal of that preference she had given her lover, to which\nhis proud heart could ill bear to submit, tho' he could himself make no\nprogress in her favour. Tho' Lady Westhaven had entreated her to see\nDelamere alone, she had refused; assigning as a reason that as he could\nnever again be to her any other than a friend, nothing could possibly\npass which her other friends might not hear. Delamere was obliged\ntherefore to brook the hard conditions of seeing her as an indifferent\nperson, or not seeing her at all. But tho' she was immoveably determined\nagainst receiving him again as a lover, she had not been able to steel\nher heart against his melancholy appearance; his palid countenance, his\nemaciated form, extremely affected her. And when he approached her,\nbowed with a dejected air, and offered to take her hand--her\nhaughtiness, her resentment forsook her--she trembling gave it,\nexpressed in incoherent words her satisfaction at seeing him better, and\nbetrayed so much emotion, that Godolphin, who with a beating heart\nnarrowly observed her, saw, as he believed, undoubted proof of her love;\nand symptoms of her approaching forgiveness.\n\nDelamere, who, whenever he was near her, ceased to remember that any\nother being existed; would, notwithstanding the presence of so many\nwitnesses, have implored her pardon and her pity; but the moment he\nbegan to speak on that subject, she told him, with as much resolution as\nshe could command, that the subject was to her so very disagreeable, as\nwould oblige her to withdraw if he persisted in introducing it.\n\nWhile his looks expressed how greatly he was hurt by her coldness, those\nof Godolphin testified equal dejection. For however she might repress\nthe hopes of his rival by words of refusal and resentment, he thought\nher countenance gave more unequivocal intelligence of the real state of\nher heart. Bellozane, as proud, as little used to controul and\ndisappointment, and with more personal vanity than Lord Delamere, beheld\nwith anger and mortification the pity and regard which Emmeline shewed\nfor her cousin; and ceasing to be jealous of Godolphin, he saw every\nthing to apprehend from the rank, the fortune, the figure of\nDelamere--from family connection, which would engage her to listen to\nhim--from ambition, which his title would gratify--from her tenderness\nto Lady Westhaven, and from the return of that affection which she had,\nas he supposed, once felt for Lord Delamere himself.\n\nBut the more invincible the obstacles which he saw rising, appeared, the\nmore satisfaction he thought there would be in conquering them. And to\nyield up his pretensions, on the first appearance of a formidable rival,\nwas contrary to his enterprising spirit and his ideas of that glory,\nwhich he equally coveted in the service of the fair and of the French\nKing.\n\nWith these sentiments of each other, the restraint and mistrust of every\nparty impeded general or chearful conversation. Godolphin soon left the\nroom, to commune with his own uneasy thoughts in a solitary walk; Lord\nWesthaven would then have taken out Bellozane, in order to give Lord\nDelamere an opportunity of being alone with his sister and Emmeline. But\nhe was determined not to understand hints on that subject; and when his\nLordship asked him to take an afternoon's walk, found means to refuse\nit. Afraid of leaving two such combustible spirits together, Lord\nWesthaven, to the great relief of Emmeline, staid with them till\nDelamere retired for the night.\n\nBut the behaviour of Bellozane to Emmeline, which was very particular,\nas if he wished it to be noticed, had extremely alarmed Delamere; and\nwhenever they afterwards met, they surveyed each other with such haughty\nreserve, and their conversation bordered so nearly on hostility and\ndefiance, that Emmeline, who expected every hour to see their animosity\nblaze out in a challenge, could support her uneasiness about it no\nlonger; and sending early to speak to Lord Westhaven on the beginning of\nthe second week of their stay, she represented to him her fears, and\nentreated him to prevail on the Chevalier to leave them and return to\nSt. Alpin.\n\n'I have attempted it already,' said he; 'but with so little success,\nthat if I press it any farther I must quarrel with him myself. I know\nperfectly well that your fears have too much foundation; and that if we\ncan neither separate or tranquillise these unquiet spirits, we shall\nhave some disagreeable affair happen between them. I know nothing that\ncan be done but your accepting at once your penitent cousin.'\n\n'No, my Lord,' answered she, with an air of chagrin, 'that I will not\ndo! I most ardently wish Lord Delamere well, and would do any thing to\nmake him happy--except sacrificing my own happiness, and acting in\nopposition to my conscience.'\n\n'Why, my dear Emmeline, how is this? You had once, surely, an affection\nfor Delamere; and his offence against you, however great, admits of\nconsiderable alleviation. Consider all the pains that were taken to\ndisunite you, and the importunity he suffered from his family. Surely,\nwhen you are convinced of his repentance you should restore him to your\nfavour; and however you may be superior to considerations of fortune and\nrank, yet when they unite in a man otherwise unexceptionable they should\nhave some weight.'\n\n'They have none with me, upon my honour, my Lord. And since we have got\nupon this topic, I will be very explicit--I am determined on no account\nto marry Lord Delamere. But that I may give no room to charge me with\ncaprice or coquetry (since your Lordship believes I once had so great a\nregard for him), or with that unforgiving temper which I see you are\ndisposed to accuse me of, it is my fixed intention, if I obtain, by your\nLordship's generous interposition, the Mowbray estate, to retire to\nMowbray Castle, and never to marry at all.'\n\nLord Westhaven, at the solemnity and gravity with which she pronounced\nthese words, began to laugh so immoderately, and to treat her resolution\nwith ridicule so pointed, that he first made her almost angry, and then\nobliged her to laugh too. At length, however, she prevailed on him again\nto listen to her apprehensions about Delamere and Bellozane.\n\n'Do not, my Lord, rally me so cruelly; but for Heaven's sake, before it\nis too late, prevent any more meetings between these two rash and\nturbulent young men. Why should the Chevalier de Bellozane stay here?'\n\n'Because it is his pleasure. I do assure you seriously, my dear Miss\nMowbray, that I have almost every day since we came hither attempted to\nsend my fiery cousin back to St. Alpin. But my anxiety has only piqued\nhim; and he determines more resolutely to stay because he sees my motive\nfor wishing him gone. He is exactly the character which I have somewhere\nseen described by a French poet.--A young man who,\n\n        ----_'leger, impetueux,\n    De soi meme rempli, jaloux, presomptueux,\n    Bouillant dans ses passions; cedant a ses caprices;\n    Pour un peu de valeur, se passoit de tous ses vices._'[37]\n\n'Yet, among all his faults, poor Bellozane has some good qualities; and\nI am really sorry for this strange perseverance in an hopeless pursuit,\nbecause it prevents my asking him to England. I give you my honour,\nEmmeline,' continued his Lordship, in a more serious tone, 'that I have\nrepeatedly represented to him the improbability of his success; but he\nanswers that you have never positively dismissed him by avowing your\npreference to another; that he knows your engagement with Lord Delamere\nis dissolved, and that he considers himself at liberty to pursue you\ntill you have decidedly chosen, or even till you are actually married.\nNay, I doubt whether your being married would make any difference in the\nattentions of this eccentric and presuming Frenchman, for I do not\nconsider Bellozane as a Swiss.'\n\n'Well, but my dear Lord, if the Chevalier will persist in staying, I\nmust determine to go. I see not that my remaining here will be attended\nwith any good effects. It may possibly be the cause of infinite\nuneasiness to Lady Westhaven. Do, therefore, prevail upon her to let me\ngo alone to St. Germains. When I am gone, Lord Delamere will think more\nof getting well than of forcing me into a new engagement. He will then\nsoon be able to travel; and the Chevalier de Bellozane will return\nquietly to the Baron.'\n\n'Why to speak ingenuously, Emmeline, it _does_ appear to me that it were\non every account more proper for you to be in England. Thither I wish\nyou could hasten, before it will be possible for Lord Delamere, or\nindeed for my wife, who must travel slowly, to get thither. I do not\nknow whether your travelling with us will be strictly proper, on other\naccounts; but if it were, it would be rendered uneasy to you by the\ncompany of these two mad headed boys; for Bellozane I am sure intends,\nif you accompany us, to go also.'\n\n'What objection is there then to my setting out immediately for St.\nGermains, with Le Limosin and Madelon, if Lady Westhaven would but\nconsent to it?'\n\n'I can easily convince her of the necessity of it; but I foresee another\nobjection that has escaped you.'\n\n'What is that, my Lord?'\n\n'That Bellozane will follow you.'\n\n'Surely he will not attempt it?'\n\n'Indeed I apprehend he will. I have no manner of influence over him; and\nhe is here connected with a set of military men, who are the likeliest\npeople in the world to encourage such an enterprize--and if at last this\nParis should carry off our fair Helen!'--\n\n'Nay, but my Lord do not ridicule my distress.'\n\n'Well then, I will most seriously and gravely counsel you: and my advice\nis, that you set out as soon as you can get ready, and that my brother\nGodolphin escort you.'\n\nEmmeline was conscious that she too much wished such an escort; yet\nfearing that her preference of him would engage Godolphin in a quarrel\nwith Bellozane or Lord Delamere, perhaps with both, she answered, while\nthe deepest blush dyed her cheeks--\n\n'No, my Lord, I cannot--I mean not--I should be sorry to give Captain\nGodolphin the trouble of such a journey--and I beg you not to think of\nit--.'\n\n'I shall speak to him of it, however.'\n\n'I beg, my Lord--I intreat that you will not.'\n\n'Here he is--and we will discuss the matter with him now.'\n\nGodolphin at this moment entered the room; and Lord Westhaven relating\nplainly all Emmeline's fears, and her wishes to put an end to them by\nquitting Besan\u00c3\u00a7on, added the proposal he had made, that Godolphin should\ntake care of her till she joined Mrs. Stafford.\n\nTho' Godolphin saw in her apprehensions for the safety of Delamere, only\na conviction of her tender regard for him, and considered his own\nattachment as every way desperate; yet he could not refuse himself, when\nit was thus offered him, the pleasure of being with her--the exquisite\ntho' painful delight of being useful to her. He therefore eagerly\nexpressed the readiness, the happiness, with which he should undertake\nso precious a charge.\n\nEmmeline, fearful of betraying her real sentiments, overacted the civil\ncoldness with which she thought it necessary to refuse this offer.\nGodolphin, mortified and vexed at her manner as much as at her denial,\nceased to press his services; and Lord Westhaven, who wondered what\ncould be her objection, since of the honour and propriety of Godolphin's\nconduct he knew she could not doubt, seemed hurt at her rejection of his\nbrother's friendly intention of waiting on her; and dropping the\nconversation, went away with Godolphin.\n\nShe saw that her conduct inevitably impressed on the mind of the latter\na conviction of her returning regard for Delamere; and she feared that\nto Lord Westhaven it might appear to be the effect of vanity and\ncoquetry.\n\n'Perhaps he will think me,' said she, 'so vain as to suppose that\nGodolphin has also designs, and that therefore I decline his attendance;\nand coquet enough to wish for the pursuit of these men, whom I only\naffect to shun, and for that reason prefer going alone, to accepting the\nprotection of his brother. Yet as _I_ know the sentiments of Godolphin,\nwhich it appears Lord Westhaven does not, surely I had better suffer his\nill opinion of me, than encourage Godolphin's hopes; which, till\nDelamere can be diverted from prosecuting his unwelcome addresses, will\ninevitably involve him in a dispute, and such a dispute as I cannot bear\nto think of.'\n\nUncertain what to do, another day passed; and on the following morning,\nwhile she waited for Lady Westhaven, she was addressed by Godolphin, who\ncalmly and gravely enquired if she would honour him with any commands\nfor England?\n\n'Are you going then, Sir, before my Lord and Lady?'\n\n'I am going, Madam, immediately.'\n\n'By way of Paris?'\n\n'Yes, Madam, to Havre; whence I shall get the quickest to Southampton,\nand to the Isle of Wight. I am uneasy at the entire solitude to which my\nabsence condemns Adelina.'\n\n'You have heard no unfavourable news, I hope, of Lady Adelina or your\nlittle boy?'\n\n'None. But I am impatient to return to them.'\n\n'As you are going immediately, Sir,' said Emmeline (making an effort to\nconquer a pain she felt rising in her bosom) 'I will not detain you by\nwriting to Lady Adelina. Perhaps--as it is possible--as I hope'--\n\nShe stopped. Godolphin looked anxious to hear what was possible, what\nshe hoped.\n\n'As I shall so soon, so very soon be in England, perhaps we may meet,'\nreassumed she, speaking very quick--'possibly I may have the happiness\nof seeing her Ladyship and dear little William.'\n\n'To meet _you_,' replied Godolphin, very solemnly, 'Adelina shall leave\nher solitude; for certainly a journey to see her in it will hardly be\nundertaken by _Lady Delamere_.'\n\nHe then in the same tone wished her health and happiness till he saw her\nagain, and left her.\n\nHe was no sooner gone, than she felt disposed to follow him and\napologize for her having so coldly refused his offers of protection.\nPride and timidity prevented her; but they could not stop her tears,\nwhich she was obliged to conceal by hurrying to her own room. Lady\nWesthaven soon after sent for her to a late breakfast: she found Lord\nDelamere there; but heard that Godolphin was gone.\n\nSoon after breakfast, Lady Westhaven and her brother, (who could not yet\nobtain a clear intermission of the fever which hung about him, and who\ncontinued extremely weak,) went out together for an airing; and Lord\nWesthaven, unusually grave, was left reading in the room with Emmeline.\n\nHe laid down his book. 'So,' said he, 'William is flown away from us.'\n\nIt was a topic on which Emmeline did not care to trust her voice.\n\n'I wish you could have determined to have gone with him.'\n\n'I wish, my Lord, I could have reconciled it to my ideas of propriety;\nsince certainly I should have been happy and safe in such an escort; and\nsince, without any at all, I must, in a day or two, go.'\n\n'I believe it will be best. Lord Delamere is no better; and Bellozane\nhas no thought of leaving us entirely, tho' his military friends take up\nso much of his time that he is luckily less with Delamere. Lord Delamere\nhas again, Miss Mowbray, been imploring me to apply to you. He wishes\nyou only to hear him. He complains that you fly from him, and will not\ngive him an opportunity of entering on his justification.'\n\n'I am extremely concerned at Lord Delamere's unhappiness. But I must\nrepeat that I require of his Lordship no justification; that I most\nsincerely forgive him if he supposes he has injured me; but that as to\nany proposals such as he once honoured me with, I am absolutely resolved\nnever to listen to them; and I entreat him to believe that any future\napplication on the subject must be entirely fruitless.'\n\n'Poor young man!' said Lord Westhaven. 'However you must consent to see\nhim alone, and to tell him so yourself; for from me he will not believe\nyou so very inflexible--so very cruel.'\n\n'I am inflexible, my Lord, but surely not cruel. The greatest cruelty of\nwhich I could be guilty, either to Lord Delamere or myself, would be to\naccept his offers, feeling as I feel, and thinking as I think.'\n\n'I do not know how we shall get him to England, or what will be done\nwith him when he is there.'\n\n'He will do well, my Lord. Doubt it not.'\n\n'Upon my honour I _do_ doubt it! It is to me astonishing that a young\nman so volatile, so high-spirited as Delamere, should be capable of an\nattachment at once so violent and so steady.'\n\n'Steady!--Has your Lordship forgotten Miss Otley?'\n\n'His wavering then was, you well know, owing to some evil impressions he\nhad received of you; which, tho' he refuses to tell me the particulars,\nhe assures me were conveyed and confirmed with so much art, that a more\ndispassionate and cooler lover would have believed them without enquiry.\nHow then can you wonder at _his_ petulant and eager spirit seizing on\nprobable circumstances, which his jealousy and apprehension immediately\nconverted into conviction? As soon as he knew these suspicions were\ngroundless, did he not fly to implore your pardon; and hasten, even at\nthe hazard of his life, to find and appease you? Such is the present\nsituation of his mind and of his health, that I very seriously assure\nyou I doubt whether he will survive your total rejection.'\n\nEmmeline, unable to answer this speech gravely, without betraying the\nvery great concern it gave her, assumed a levity she did not feel.\n\n'Your Lordship,' said she, 'is disposed to think thus, from the warm and\nvehement manner in which Lord Delamere is accustomed to express himself.\nIf he is really unhappy, I am very sorry; but I am persuaded time, and\nthe more fortunate alliance which he is solicited to form, will effect a\ncure. Don't think me unfeeling if I answer your melancholy prophecy in\nthe words of Rosalind--\n\n    'Men have died from time to time, and worms have eat them--but not\n    for love.'\n\nShe then ran away, and losing all her forced spirits the moment she was\nalone, gave way to tears. She fancied they flowed entirely for the\nunhappiness of poor Delamere, and for her uncertain situation. But tho'\nthe former uneasiness deeply affected her sensible heart, many of the\ntears she shed were because Godolphin was gone, and she knew not when\nshe should again see him.\n\nGodolphin, repining and wretched, pursued his way to Paris. He thought\nthat Emmeline's coldness and reserve were meant to put an end to any\nhopes he might have entertained; and that her reconciliation and\nmarriage with Lord Delamere must inevitably take place as soon as she\nhad, by her dissimulated cruelty, punished him for his rashness and his\nerrors. His daily observation confirmed him in this opinion: he saw,\nthat in place of her candid and ingenuous manners, a studied conduct was\nadopted, which concealed her real sentiments--sentiments which he\nconcluded to be all in favour of Delamere. And finding that he could not\ndivest himself of his passion for her, he thought that it was a\nweakness, if not a crime, to indulge it in her presence, while it\nimposed on himself an insupportable torment; and that, by quitting her,\nhe should at least conceal his hopeless attachment, and save himself the\nmisery of seeing her actually married to Lord Delamere. He determined,\ntherefore, to tear himself away; and to punish himself for the premature\nexpectations with which he had begun his journey to St. Alpin, by\nshutting himself up at East Cliff (his house in the Isle of Wight) and\nrefusing himself the sight of her, of whom it would be sufficient misery\nto think, when she had given herself to her favoured and fortunate\nlover.\n\nFull of these reflections, Godolphin continued his road, intending to\ntake the passage boat at Havre. But at the hotel he frequented at Paris,\nhe met a gentleman of his acquaintance who was going the next day to\nEngland by way of Calais; and as he had his own post chaise, and only\nhis valet with him, he told Godolphin that if he would take a place in\nhis chaise he would send his servant post. This offer Godolphin\naccepted; and altering his original design, went with his friend to\nCalais to cross to England.\n\n[Footnote 37:\n\n        ----Volatile--impetuous--\n    Full of himself--jealous--presumptuous--\n    Fiery in his passions; yielding to every caprice;\n    And who believes some courage an apology for all his vices.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nIt was now impossible for Emmeline to avoid a conversation with Lord\nDelamere, which his sister urged her so earnestly to allow him.\nBellozane was, by the French officers, with whom he principally lived,\nengaged out for two days; and Lord and Lady Westhaven easily found an\nopportunity to leave Emmeline with Delamere.\n\nHe was no sooner alone in her presence, than he threw himself on his\nknees before her--'Will you,' cried he, 'ah! will you still refuse to\nhear and to forgive me? Have I offended beyond all hopes of pardon?'\n\n'No, my Lord.--I do most readily and truly forgive every offence,\nwhether real or imaginary, that you believe you have committed against\nme.'\n\n'You forgive me--But to what purpose?--Only to plunge me yet deeper into\nwretchedness. You forgive me--but you despise, you throw me from you for\never. Ah! rather continue to be angry, than distract me by a pardon so\ncold and careless!'\n\n'If your Lordship will be calm--if you will rise, and hear me with\ntemper, I will be very explicit with you; but while you yield to these\nextravagant transports, I cannot explain all I wish you to understand;\nand must indeed beg to be released from a conversation so painful to me,\nand to you so prejudicial.'\n\nDelamere rose and took a chair.\n\n'I need not, Sir,' said Emmeline, collecting all her courage, 'recall to\nyour memory the time so lately passed, when I engaged to become your's,\nif at the expiration of a certain period Lord and Lady Montreville\nconsented, and you still remained disposed to bestow on me the honour of\nyour name.'\n\n'What am I to expect,' cried Delamere, eagerly interrupting her--'Ah!\nwhat am I to expect from a preface so cold and cruel? You have indeed no\noccasion to recall to my memory those days when I was allowed to look\nforward to that happiness, which now, thro' the villainy of others, and\nmy own madness and ideotism, I have lost. But, Madam, it must not, it\ncannot be so easily relinquished! By heaven I will not give you up!--and\nif but for a moment I thought----.'\n\n'You seemed just now, Sir, disposed to hear me with patience. Since,\nhowever, you cannot even for a few minutes forbear these starts of\npassion, I really am unequal to the task of staying with you.'\n\nShe would then have hastened away; but Delamere forcibly detaining her,\nagain protested he would be calm, and again she went on.\n\n'At that time, I will own to you, that without any prepossession, almost\nwithout a wish either to accept or decline the very high honour you\noffered me, I was content to engage myself to be your wife; because you\nsaid such an engagement would make _you_ happy, and because I then knew\nnot that it would render _me_ otherwise.'\n\n'Was you even then thus indifferent? Had I no place in your heart,\nMadam, when you would have given me your hand?'\n\n'Yes, Sir--you had then the place I now willingly restore to you. I\nesteemed you; I looked upon you with a sisterly affection; and had I\nmarried you, it would have been rather to have made you happy, than\nbecause I had any wish to form other ties than those by which our\nrelationship and early acquaintance had connected us.'\n\n'Ah! my angelic Emmeline! it will still make me happy! Let the reasons\nwhich then influenced you, again plead for me; and forget, O! forget all\nthat has passed since my headlong folly urged me to insult and forsake\nyou!'\n\n'Alas! my Lord, that is not in my power! You have cancelled the\nengagements that subsisted between us; and, as I understand, have\nactually formed others more indissoluble, with a lady of high rank and\nof immense fortune--one whose alliance is as anxiously courted by your\nfamily, as mine is despised. Can your Lordship again fly from your\npromises? Can you quit at pleasure the affluent and high-born heiress as\nyou quitted the deserted and solitary orphan?'\n\n'Cursed, cursed cruelty!' exclaimed Delamere, speaking thro' his shut\nteeth--But go on, Madam! I deserve your severity, and must bear your\nreproaches! Yet surely you know that but for the machinations of those\nexecrable Crofts', I should never have acted as I did--you know, that\nhowever destitute of fortune chance had made you, I preferred you to all\nthose who might have brought me wealth!'\n\n'I acknowledge your generosity, Sir, and on that head meant not to\nreproach. I merely intended to represent to you what you seem to have\nforgotten--that were I disposed to restore you the hand you so lately\nrenounced, you could not take it; since Miss Otley will certainly not\nrelinquish the claim you have given her to your regard.'\n\n'You are misinformed.--I am under no engagement to Miss Otley.--I am not\nby heaven! by all that is sacred!'\n\n'Were not all preparations for your marriage in great forwardness, Sir,\nwhen you left England? and must not your consent have been previously\nobtained before Lord Montreville would have made them? However, to put\nan end to all uncertainty, I must tell you, my Lord, with a sincerity\nwhich will probably be displeasing to you, that my affections--'\n\n'Are no longer in your own power!' cried he, hastily interrupting\nher--'Speak, Madam--is it not so?'\n\n'I did not say that, Sir. I was going to assure you that I now find it\nimpossible to command them--impossible to feel for you that preference,\nwithout which I should think myself extremely culpable were I to give\nyou my hand.'\n\n'I understand you, Madam! You give that preference to another. The\nChevalier de Bellozane has succeeded to your affections. He has\ndoubtless made good use of the opportunities he has had to conciliate\nyour favour; but before he carries his good fortune farther, he must\ndiscuss with me the right by which he pretends to it.'\n\n'Whether he has or has not a right to pretend to my regard, Sir,' said\nEmmeline, with great spirit, 'this causeless jealousy, so immediately\nafter you have been convinced of the fallacy of your supposition in\nregard to another person, convinces me, that had I unfortunately given\nyou an exclusive claim to my friendship and affection, my whole life\nwould have been embittered by suspicion, jealousy, and caprice.\nRecollect, my Lord, that I have said nothing of the Chevalier de\nBellozane, nor have you the least reason to believe I have for him those\nsentiments you are pleased to impute to me.'\n\n'But can I doubt it!' exclaimed Delamere, rising, and walking about in\nan agony--'Can I doubt it, when I have heard you disclaim me for\never!--when you have told me your affections are no longer in your\npower!'\n\n'No, Sir; my meaning was, what I now repeat--that as my near relation,\nas my friend, as the brother of Lady Westhaven, I shall ever esteem and\nregard you; but that I cannot command now in your favour those\nsentiments which should induce me to accept of you as my husband. What\nis past cannot be recalled; and tho' I am most truly concerned to see\nyou unhappy, my determination is fixed and I must abide by it.'\n\n'Death and hell!' cried the agonized Delamere--'It is all over then! You\nutterly disclaim me, and hardly think it worth while to conceal from me\nfor whose sake I am disclaimed!'\n\nEmmeline was terrified to find that he still persisted in imputing her\nestrangement from him to her partiality for Bellozane; foreseeing that\nhe would immediately fly to him, and that all she apprehended must\nfollow.\n\n'I beg, I entreat, Lord Delamere, that you will understand that I give\nno preference to Mr. de Bellozane. I will not only assure you of that,\nbut I disclaim all intention of marriage whatever! Suffer me, my Lord,\nto entreat that you will endeavour to calm your mind and regain your\nhealth. Reflect on the cruel uncertainty in which you have left the\nMarquis and the Marchioness; reflect on the uneasy situation in which\nyou keep Lord and Lady Westhaven, and on the great injury you do\nyourself; and resolutely attempt, in the certainty of succeeding, to\ndivest yourself of a fatal partiality, which has hitherto produced only\nmisery to you and to your family.'\n\n'Oh! most certainly, most certainly!' cried Delamere, almost choaked\nwith passion--'I shall undoubtedly make all these wise reflections; and\nafter having gone thro' a proper course of them, shall, possibly, with\ngreat composure, see you in the arms of that presumptuous coxcomb--that\nvain, supercilious Frenchman!--that detested Bellozane! No, Madam! no!\nyou may certainly give yourself to him, but assure yourself I live not\nto see it!'\n\nHe flew out of the room at these words, tho' she attempted to stop and\nto appease him. Her heart bled at the wounds she had yet thought it\nnecessary to inflict; and she was at once grieved and terrified at his\nmenacing and abrupt departure. She immediately went herself after Lord\nWesthaven, to intreat him to keep Bellozane and Delamere apart. His\nLordship was much disturbed at what had passed, which Emmeline\nfaithfully related to him: Bellozane was still out of town; and Lord\nWesthaven, who now apprehended that on Delamere's meeting him he would\nimmediately insult him, said he would consider what could be done to\nprevent their seeing each other 'till Delamere became more reasonable.\nOn enquiry, he found that the Chevalier was certainly engaged with his\ncompanions 'till the next day. He therefore came back to Emmeline about\nan hour after he had left her, and told her that he thought it best for\nher to set out that afternoon on her way to St. Germains.\n\n'You will by this means make it difficult for Bellozane to overtake you,\nif he should attempt it; and when he sees you have actually fled from\nDelamere, he will be little disposed to quarrel with him, and will\nperhaps go home. As to Delamere, his sister and I must manage him as\nwell as we can; which will be the easier, as he is, within this half\nhour, gone to bed in a violent access of fever. Indeed, in the\nperturbation of mind he now suffers, there is no probability of his\nspeedy amendment; for as fast as he regains strength, his violent\npassions throw his frame again into disorder.--But perhaps when he knows\nyou are actually in England, he may try to acquire, by keeping himself\nquiet, that share of health which alone can enable him to follow you.'\n\nEmmeline, eagerly embracing this advice, which she found had the\nconcurrence of Lady Westhaven, prepared instantly for her departure; and\nembracing tenderly her two excellent friends, who hoped soon to follow\nher, and who had desired her to come to them to reside as soon as they\nwere settled in London, where they had no house at present, she got into\na chaise, with Madelon, and attended by Le Limosin, who was proudly\nelated at being thus '_l'homme de confience_'[38] to Mademoiselle\nMowbray, she left Besan\u00c3\u00a7on; her heart deeply impressed with a sense of\nDelamere's sufferings, and with an earnest wish for the restoration of\nhis peace.\n\nTho' Godolphin had been gone four days, and went post, so that she knew\nhe must be at Paris long before her, she could not, as she proceeded on\nher journey, help fancying that some accident might have stopped him,\nand that she might overtake him. She knew not whether she hoped or\nfeared such an encounter. But the disappointed air with which she left\nevery post house where she had occasion to stop for horses, plainly\nevinced that she rather desired than dreaded it. She felt all the\nabsurdity and ridicule of expecting to see him; yet still she looked out\nafter him; and he was the object she sought when she cast her eyes round\nher at the several stages.\n\nWithout overtaking him, or being herself overtaken by Bellozane, she\narrived in safety and in the usual time at Paris, and immediately went\non to St. Germains; Le Limosin being so well acquainted with travelling,\nthat she had no trouble nor alarm during her journey.\n\nWhen she got to St. Germains, she was received with transport by Mrs.\nStafford and her family. She found her about to depart, in two days, for\nEngland, where there was a prospect of settling her husband's affairs;\nand she had undertaken to go alone over, in hopes of adjusting them for\nhis speedy return; while he had agreed to remain with the children 'till\nhe heard the success of her endeavours. Great was the satisfaction of\nMrs. Stafford to find that Emmeline would accompany her to England; with\nyet more pleasure did she peruse those documents which convinced her\nthat her fair friend went to claim, with an absolute certainty of\nsuccess, her large paternal fortune.\n\nLord Westhaven had given her a long letter to the Marquis of\nMontreville, to whom he desired she would immediately address herself;\nand he had also written to an eminent lawyer, his friend, into whose\nhands he directed her immediately to put the papers that related to her\nbirth, and by no means to trust them with any other person.\n\nWith money, also, Lord Westhaven had amply furnished her; and she\nproposed taking lodgings in London, 'till she could settle her affairs\nwith Lord Montreville; and then to go to Mowbray Castle.\n\nOn the second day after her reaching St. Germains, she began her journey\nto Calais with Mrs. Stafford, attended by Le Limosin and Madelon. When\nthey arrived there, they heard that a passage boat would sail about nine\no'clock in the evening; but on sending Le Limosin to speak to the\nmaster, they learned that there were already more cabin passengers than\nthere was room to accommodate, and that therefore two ladies might find\nit inconvenient.\n\nAs the evening, however, was calm, and the wind favourable, and as the\ntwo fair travellers were impatient to be in England, they determined to\ngo on board. It was near ten o'clock before the vessel got under way;\nand before two they were assured they should be at Dover. They therefore\nhesitated not to pass that time in chairs on the deck, wrapped in their\ncloaks; and would have preferred doing so, to the heat and closeness of\nthe cabin, had there been room for them in it.\n\nBy eleven o'clock, every thing insensibly grew quiet on board. The\npassengers were gone to their beds, the vessel moved calmly, and with\nvery little wind, over a gently swelling sea; and the silence was only\nbroken by the waves rising against it's side, or by the steersman, who\nnow and then spoke to another sailor, that slowly traversed the deck\nwith measured pace.\n\nThe night was dark; a declining moon only broke thro' the heavy clouds\nof the horizon with a feeble and distant light. There was a solemnity in\nthe scene at once melancholy and pleasing. Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline\nboth felt it. They were silent; and each lost in her own reflections;\nnor did they attend to a slight interruption of the stillness that\nreigned on board, made by a passenger who came from below, muffled in a\ngreat coat. He spoke in a low voice to the man at the helm, and then sat\ndown on the gunwale, with his back towards the ladies; after which all\nwas again quiet.\n\nIn a few minutes a deep sigh was uttered by this passenger; and then,\nafter a short pause, the two friends were astonished to hear, in a\nvoice, low, but extremely expressive, these lines, addressed to Night.\n\n\n                    SONNET\n\n    I love thee, mournful sober-suited Night,\n    When the faint Moon, yet lingering in her wane\n    And veil'd in clouds, with pale uncertain light\n    Hangs o'er the waters of the restless main.\n\n    In deep depression sunk, the enfeebled mind\n    Will to the deaf, cold elements complain,\n    And tell the embosom'd grief, however vain,\n    To sullen surges and the viewless wind.\n\n    Tho' no repose on thy dark breast I find,\n    I still enjoy thee--chearless as thou art;\n    For in thy quiet gloom, the exhausted heart,\n    Is calm, tho' wretched; hopeless, yet resign'd.\n    While, to the winds and waves, it's sorrows given,\n    May reach--tho' lost on earth--the ear of heaven!\n\n\n'Surely,' said Mrs. Stafford in a whisper, 'it is a voice I know.'\n\n'Surely,' repeated the heart of Emmeline, for she could not speak, 'it\nis the voice of Godolphin!'\n\n'Do you,' reassumed Mrs. Stafford--'do you not recollect the voice?'\n\n'Yes,' replied Emmeline. 'I think--I believe--I rather fancy it is--Mr.\nGodolphin.'\n\n'Shall I speak to him?' asked Mrs. Stafford, 'or are you disposed to\nhear more poetry? He has no notion who are his auditors.'\n\n'As you please,' said Emmeline.\n\nAgain the person sighed, and repeated with more warmth--\n\n\n    'And reach, tho' lost on earth--the ear of heaven!'\n\n\n'Yes--if _she_ is happy, they will indeed be heard! Ah! that cruel\n_if_--_if_ she is happy! and can I bear to doubt it, yet leave her to\nthe experiment!'\n\nThere now remained no doubt but that the stranger was Godolphin; and\nEmmeline as little hesitated to believe herself the subject of his\nthoughts and of his Muse.\n\n'Why do _you_ not speak to him, Emmeline?' said Mrs. Stafford archly.\n\n'I cannot, indeed.'\n\n'I must speak then, myself;' and raising her voice, she said--'Mr.\nGodolphin, is it not?'\n\n'Who is so good as to recollect me?' cried he, rising and looking round\nhim. It was very dark; but he could just distinguish that two ladies\nwere there.\n\nMrs. Stafford gave him her hand, saying--'Have you then forgotten your\nfriends?'\n\nHe snatched her hand, and carried it to his lips.\n\n'There is another hand for you,' said she, pointing to Emmeline--'but\nyou must be at the trouble of taking it.'\n\n'That I shall be most delighted to do. But who is it? Surely it cannot\nbe Miss Mowbray, that allows me such happiness?'\n\n'Have you, in one little week,' said the faultering Emmeline, 'occasion\nto ask that question?'\n\n'Not now I hear that voice,' answered Godolphin in the most animated\ntone--'Not when I hold this lovely hand. But whence comes it that I find\nyou, Madam, here? or how does it happen that you have left my brother\nand sister, and the happy Delamere?' He seemed to have recollected,\nafter his first transport at meeting her, that he was thus warmly\naddressing _her_ who was probably only going to England to prepare for\nher union with his rival.\n\n'Do not be so unreasonable,' said Mrs. Stafford, 'as to expect Miss\nMowbray should answer all these questions. But find a seat; and let us\nhear some account of yourself. You have also to make your peace with me\nfor not seeing me in your way.'\n\nGodolphin threw himself on the deck at their feet.\n\n'I find a seat here,' said he, 'which I should prefer to a throne. As to\nan account of myself, it is soon given. I met a friend, whose company\ninduced me to come to Calais rather than travel thro' Normandy; and the\nhaste he was in made it impossible for me to stop him. Miss Mowbray had\nrefused to give me any commission for you; and I had nothing to say to\nyou that would have given you any pleasure. I was, therefore, unwilling\nto trouble you merely with a passing enquiry.'\n\n'But whence comes it that you sail only to-night, if your friend was so\nmuch hurried?'\n\n'He went four days ago; but I--I was kept--I was detained at Calais.'\n\nEmmeline felt a strange curiosity to know what could have detained him;\nbut dared not ask such a question.\n\nThey then talked of Lord and Lady Westhaven.\n\n'Lord Delamere is, I conclude, much better?' said Godolphin.\n\n'When I took leave of Lord and Lady Westhaven,' coldly answered\nEmmeline, 'I did not think him much better than when we first saw him.\nHis servant said he was almost as ill as when you, Sir, with friendship\nso uncommon, attended him.'\n\n'Call it not uncommon, Madam!--It was an office I would have performed,\nnot only for any Englishman in another country, but I hope for any human\nbeing in any country, who had needed it. Should I then allow you to\nsuppose there was any great merit in my rendering a slight service to\nthe brother of Lady Westhaven; and who is besides _dear to one_ to whom\n_I_ owe obligations so infinite.'\n\nThe stress he laid on these words left Emmeline no doubt of his meaning.\nShe was, however, vexed and half angry that he persisted in believing\nher so entirely attached to Delamere; and, for the first time she had\nventured to think steadily on the subject, meditated how to undeceive\nhim. Yet when she reflected on the character of Delamere; and remembered\nthat his father would now claim an authority to controul her\nactions--that one would think himself at liberty to call any man to an\naccount who addressed her, and the other to refuse his consent to any\nother marriage than that which would be now so advantageous to the\nfamily--she saw only inquietude to herself, and hazard to the life so\ndear to her, should she suffer the passion of Godolphin openly to be\navowed.\n\n'Is it not remarkable,' said Mrs. Stafford, 'that you should voluntarily\nhave conducted us to France, and by chance escort us home?'\n\n'Yes,' answered Godolphin.--'And a chance so fortunate for me I should\nthink portended some good, was I sanguine, and had I any faith in\nomens.'\n\n'Are you going immediately to London?'\n\n'Immediately.'\n\n'And from thence to East Cliff?'\n\n'I believe I shall be obliged to stay in town a week or ten days.--But\nmy continuance there shall be longer, if you or Miss Mowbray will employ\nme.'\n\nThe night now grew cold; and the dew fell so heavily, that Mrs. Stafford\nexpressed her apprehensions that Emmeline would find some ill effects\nfrom it, and advised her to go down.\n\n'Oh! no,' said Godolphin, with uncommon anxiety in his manner--'do not\ngo down. There are so many passengers in the cabin, and it is so close,\nthat you will find it extremely disagreeable. It will not now be half an\nhour before we see the lights of Dover; and we shall presently be on\nshore.'\n\nEmmeline, who really apprehended little from cold, acquiesced; and they\ncontinued to converse on general topics 'till they landed.\n\nGodolphin saw them on shore immediately, and attended them to the inn.\nHe then told them he must go back to see after the baggage, and left\nthem hastily. They ordered a slight refreshment; and when it was brought\nin, Emmeline said--'Shall we not wait for Mr. Godolphin?'\n\n'The Gentleman is come in, Madam,' said the waiter, 'with another lady,\nand is assisting her up stairs. Would you please I should call him?'\n\nEmmeline felt, without knowing the nature of the sensation, involuntary\ncuriosity and involuntary uneasiness.\n\n'No, do not call him,' said Mrs. Stafford--'I suppose he will be here\nimmediately. But send the French servant to us.'\n\nLe Limosin attending, she gave him some requisite orders, and then again\nenquired for Captain Godolphin.\n\nLe Limosin answered, that he was gone to assist a lady to her room, who\nhad been very ill during the passage.\n\n'Of which nation is she, Le Limosin?'\n\n'I am ignorant of that, Madam, as I have not heard her speak. _Monsieur\nLe Capitaine_ is very sorry for her, and has attended her the whole way,\nonly the little time he was upon deck.'\n\n'Is she a young lady?' enquired Mrs. Stafford.\n\n'Yes, very young and pretty.'\n\nThe curiosity of Mrs. Stafford was now, in spite of herself, awakened.\nAnd the long stay Godolphin made, gave to Emmeline such acute\nuneasiness, as she had never felt before. It is extraordinary surely,\nsaid she to herself, that he should be thus anxious about an\nacquaintance made in a pacquet boat.\n\nShe grew more and more disturbed at his absence; and was hardly able to\nconceal her vexation from Mrs. Stafford, while she was ashamed of\ndiscovering it even to herself. In about ten minutes, which had appeared\nto her above an hour, Godolphin came in; apologised, without accounting,\nfor his stay, and while they made all together a slight repast, enquired\nhow they intended to proceed to London and at what time.\n\nOn hearing that they thought of setting out about noon, in a chaise, he\nproposed their taking a post coach; 'and then,' added he, 'you may\nsuffer me to occupy the fourth place.' To this Mrs. Stafford willingly\nagreed; and Emmeline, glad to find that at least he did not intend\nwaiting on his pacquet boat acquaintance to London, retired with\nsomewhat less uneasiness than she had felt on her first hearing that he\nhad brought such an acquaintance on shore.\n\nAfter a few hours sleep, the fair travellers arose to continue their\njourney. They heard that Mr. Godolphin had long left his room, and was\nat breakfast with the lady whom he had been so careful of the preceding\nmorning. At this intelligence Emmeline felt all her anxiety revive; and\nwhen he came into the room where they were to speak to them, hardly\ncould she command herself to answer him without betraying her emotion.\n\n'Miss Mowbray is fatigued with her voyage,' said he, tenderly\napproaching her--'The night air I am afraid has affected her health?'\n\n'No, Sir;' coldly and faintly answered Emmeline.\n\n'How is the young lady you was so good as to assist on shore, Sir?' said\nMrs. Stafford. 'I understand she was ill.'\n\nGodolphin blushed; and replied, with some little embarrassment, 'she is\nbetter, Madam, I thank you.'\n\n'So,' thought Emmeline, 'he makes then no mystery of having an interest\nin this lady.'\n\n'Are you acquainted with her?' enquired Mrs. Stafford.\n\n'Yes.'\n\nPoliteness would not admit of another question: yet it was impossible to\nhelp wishing to ask it. Godolphin, however, turned the discourse, and\nsoon afterwards went out. Emmeline felt ready to cry, yet knew not for\nwhat, and dreaded to ask herself whether she had not admitted into her\nheart the tormenting passion of jealousy.\n\n'Why should I be displeased,' said she. 'Why should I be unhappy? Mr.\nGodolphin believes me attached to Delamere, and has ceased to think of\nme; wherefore should I lament that he thinks of another; or what right\nhave I to enquire into his actions--what right have I to blame them?'\n\nThe post coach was now ready. Emmeline, attended by Madelon, Mrs.\nStafford, and Godolphin, got into it, and a lively and animated\nconversation was carried on between the two latter. Emmeline, in the\napproaching interview with her uncle, and in the wretchedness of\nDelamere, which she never ceased to lament, had employment enough for\nher thoughts; but in spite of herself they flew perpetually from those\nsubjects to the acquaintance which Captain Godolphin had brought with\nhim from Calais.\n\n[Footnote 38: Confidential servant.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nWhen they arrived at Canterbury, the ladies were shewn into a parlour,\nwhere Godolphin did not join them for near half an hour. Emmeline had\naccounted for her lowness of spirits by her dread of meeting her uncle\non such terms as they were likely to meet; but Mrs. Stafford knew the\nhuman heart too well to be ignorant that there was another and a\nconcealed source of that melancholy which overwhelmed her. It was in\nvain she had attempted to dissemble. It was, to her friend, evident,\nthat her compassion, her good wishes, were Delamere's, but that her\nheart was wholly Godolphin's, and was now pierced with the poignant\nthorns of new-born jealousy and anxious mistrust.\n\nWhile they waited together the return of Godolphin, Mrs. Stafford\nsaid--'I fancy that post chaise that passed us about half an hour ago,\ncontained Mr. Godolphin's _acquaintance_.'\n\n'Did it? Why do you think so?'\n\n'Because he looked after it so earnestly; and there seemed to be only a\nyoung woman in it.'\n\n'I did not observe it indeed,' replied Emmeline, with the appearance of\ncarelessness.\n\n'I should like to see her nearer,' continued Mrs. Stafford, with some\narchness--'By the glympse I had of her she appeared to be very\nhandsome.'\n\n'Do you think she is a French woman?' enquired Emmeline, still affecting\ngreat indifference.\n\n'No, she appeared to be English. But if you please I will enquire of\nhim?'\n\n'I beg you will not,' in an half angry tone, answered Emmeline--'I am\nsure it is very immaterial.'\n\nAt this moment Godolphin entered; and with looks of uneasiness\napologized for his long stay. 'I have an awkward embarrassment,' said\nhe, 'on my hands: a poor young woman, who is wholly a stranger in this\ncountry, and whom I have undertaken to conduct to London; but she is so\nill that I am afraid she is unfit to go on.--Yet how to leave her here I\nknow not.'\n\n'Pray, Sir,' said Emmeline, 'do not let us be any restraint to you. If\nyour presence is necessary to the lady, you had surely better continue\nwith her, than put her to any inconvenience to go on.'\n\nGodolphin, who was at once pleased and pained by the quickness with\nwhich she spoke, said--'I will tell you, my dear Miss Mowbray, very\ningenuously, that if I were quite sure the character of this unhappy\nyoung woman is such as may entitle her to your's and Mrs. Stafford's\nprotection, I should without scruple have asked it. _I_ know,' continued\nhe, looking distressed, 'how compassionate and good you both are; but I\nought not therefore to hazard improperly taxing such generosity and\nsensibility.'\n\n'Who is this young person, Sir?' asked Mrs. Stafford.\n\n'If it will not tire you I will tell you. On my arrival at Calais this\nday se'nnight, I found all the pacquet boats on the other side, and was\nobliged to wait with my friend Cleveland a whole day. As I was\nsauntering about the streets after dinner, I passed by an Englishman\nwhose face I thought I recollected. The man looked confused, and took\noff his hat; and I then perfectly remembered him to have been one of the\nbest sailors I had on board in the West Indies, where he received a\ndangerous wound in the arm.\n\n'I stopped, and asked him by what accident he came to Calais, and why\nhis appearance was no better; for his honest hard features seemed\npinched with want, his dress was shabby, his person meagre, and his look\ndejected.\n\n'\"I am ashamed to tell you, Captain,\" said he, \"how I came hither; but\nin short because I could not live at home. You know I got prize money\nwhen I served under your honour. Mayhap I might have managed it better;\nbut howsomdever 'tis gone, and there's an end on't. So as we are all\nturned a drift in the world, some of my ship mates advised me to try a\nlittle matter of smuggling with them, and come over here. I have lived\namong these Frenchmen now these two months, and can, to be sure, just\nlive; but rot 'em, if I could get any thing to do at home, I wouldn't\nstay another hour, for I hates 'em all, as your honour very well knows.\nA lucky voyage or two will put some money mayhap in my way, with this\nsmuggling trade; and then I reckons to cross over home once for all, and\nso go down to Liverpool to my friends, if any on um be alive yet.\"\n\n'I reproved my acquaintance severely for his proceeding, and told him,\nthat to enable him to go to his friends, I would supply him with money\nto buy him cloaths, which I found he principally wanted; being ashamed\nto appear among his relations so ill equipped, after having received a\nconsiderable sum in prize money.\n\n'The poor fellow appeared to be very grateful, and assured me that to\nprove his sincerity he would embark in the same pacquet boat. \"But Lord,\nCaptain,\" added he, \"I be'nt the only Englishman who stays in this\nrascally country agin their will--your honour remembers Lieutenant\nStornaway, on board your honour's ship?\"\n\n'Aye, to be sure I do.'\n\n'\"Well; he, poor lad, is got into prison here for debt, and there I\nreckon he'll die; for nobody that ever gets into one of their confounded\njails in this country, ever gets out again.\"\n\n'As I perfectly remembered Stornaway, a gallant and spirited young\nScotsman, I was much hurt at this account, and asked if I could be\nadmitted to see him. I found it attended with infinite difficulty, and\nthat I must apply to so many different persons before I could be allowed\nto see my unfortunate countryman, that the pacquet boat of the next day\nmust sail without me. Cleveland therefore departed; and I, with long\nattendance on the Commandant and other officers, was at length\nintroduced into the prison. I will not shock you with a description of\nit, nor with the condition in which I found the poor young man; who\nseemed to me likely to escape, by death, from the damp and miserable\ndungeon where he lay, without necessary food, without air, and without\nhope of relief. He related to me his sorrowful and simple tale. He was\nbrought up to the sea; had no friends able to assist him; and on being\ndischarged, after the peace, had gone, with what money he received, and\non half pay, to France, in hopes of being able to live at less expence\nthan in England, and to learn, at the same time, a language so necessary\nin his profession.\n\n'\"And for some time,\" said he, \"I did pretty well; till going with one\nof my countrymen to see a relation of his, who was (tho' born of Scots\nparents) brought up as a pensioner in a convent, and a Catholic, I was\nno longer my own master, and tho' I knew that it was almost impossible\nfor me to support a wife, I yet rashly married, and have made one of the\nloveliest young creatures in the world a beggar.\n\n'\"She was totally destitute of fortune; and was afraid her friends, who\nwere but distant relations, and people of rank in Scotland, would insist\non her taking the veil, as the most certain and easiest means of\nproviding for her. She had a decided aversion to a monastic life; and\npoor as I was, (for I did not attempt to deceive her,) hesitated not to\nquit her convent with me, which it was easy enough to do by the\nmanagement of her relation, with whom she was allowed to go out. We set\nout, therefore, together for England. I had about twenty Louis in my\npocket, which would have carried us thither comfortably: but calamity\novertook us by the way. We travelled in stages and diligences, as we\nfound cheapest; in one of which I imagine my poor girl caught the\ninfection of the small pox, with which she fell ill at Amiens. I\nattended her with all the agonizing fear of a wretch who sees his only\nearthly good on the point of being torn from him for ever; and very,\nvery ill she was for many days and nights. Yet her lovely face was\nspared; and in a month I saw her quite out of danger, but still too weak\nto travel. As I spared nothing that could contribute to her ease or her\nrecovery, my money was dreadfully diminished, and I had barely enough\nleft to carry me alone to England. But as our credit was yet good, I\npurposed our living on it till her strength was somewhat re-established,\nand that I would then go to England, get a supply of money, and return\nto pay my debts and fetch my wife.\n\n'\"This was the only expedient,\" said poor Stornaway, \"that I could think\nof, and perhaps was the very worst I could have adopted; since by this\nmeans we insensibly got into debt, and to creditors the most inexorable.\n\n'\"At the end of three weeks, my wife was tolerably well. I divided with\nher the money I had left, and went off in the night to Calais,\nflattering myself I should return to her within a fortnight. But so\nvigilant were those to whom I owed money, and so active the\n_mar\u00c3\u00a9chauss\u00c3\u00a9s_, that I was pursued, and thrown, without hesitation and\nwithout appeal, into this prison; where my little remaining money, being\nall exhausted in fees, to save me from even worse treatment, I have now\nlain near six weeks in the situation in which you see me. As to myself,\"\ncontinued the poor young man, \"my life has been a life of hardship, and\nI have learned to hold it as nothing; but when I reflect on what must\nhave been the condition of my Isabel, I own to you, dear Sir, that my\nfortitude forsakes me, and the blackest despair takes possession of my\nsoul.\"\n\n'I had but little occasion to deliberate,' said Godolphin, continuing\nhis narrative--'I had but little occasion to deliberate. I enquired into\nthe debt. It was a trifle. I blushed to think, that while Englishmen\nwere daily passing thro' the place in pursuit of pleasure, a gentleman,\nan officer of their nation, languished for such a sum in the horrors of\na confinement so dreadful. The debt was easily discharged; and I took\nthe unhappy Stornaway to my lodgings, from whence he was eagerly flying\nto Amiens, when I was called aside by one of the _mar\u00c3\u00a9chauss\u00c3\u00a9_, who\ndesired to speak to me.\n\n'\"Sir,\" said the man, \"you have been generous to me, and I will hazard\ntelling you a secret. Orders are coming to stop your friend, whom you\nhave released from prison, for stealing a pensioner out of a convent.\nGet him off to England immediately, or he will be taken, and perhaps\nconfined for life.\"\n\n'I hastened Stornaway instantly into a boat, and sent him after a\npacquet which had just sailed, and which I saw him overtake. He conjured\nme, in an agony of despair, to enquire for his wife, without whom he\nsaid he could not live, and that rather than attempt it, he would return\nand perish in prison. I promised all he desired; and as soon as I was\nsure he was safe, I set out post for Amiens, where I found the poor\nyoung woman in a situation to which no words can do justice. She had\nparted with almost every thing for her support; and was overwhelmed by\nthe weight of misfortunes, which, young and inexperienced as she was,\nshe had neither the means to soften or the fortitude to bear. I brought\nher away to Calais, and embarked with her yesterday, having only staid\nlong enough to furnish her with cloaths, and to recruit her enfeebled\nframe after her journey. But sea sickness, added to her former ill state\nof health, has reduced her to a condition of deplorable weakness. She\nspeaks so little English that she is unable to travel alone; and I was\nin hopes that by her chaise keeping up with the coach, I might have\nassisted her on the road; but she is now so extremely ill that I am\nafraid she must remain here.'\n\nDuring the first part of this short account, Emmeline, charmed more than\never with Godolphin, and ashamed of having for a moment entertained a\nsuspicion to the disadvantage of such a man, sat silent; but at the\nconclusion of it, her eyes overflowed with tears; she felt something\nthat told her she ought to apologize to him for the error she had been\nguilty of--tho' of that error he knew nothing; and impelled by an\ninvoluntary impulse, she held out her hand to him.--Dear, generous,\nnoble-minded Godolphin! was uttered by her heart, but her lips only\nechoed, the last word.\n\n'Godolphin!' said she, 'let us go to this poor young creature--let us\nsee her ourselves.'\n\n'Certainly we will,' cried Mrs. Stafford; 'and indeed, Sir, you ought to\nhave told us before, that we might sooner have offered all the\nassistance in our power.'\n\n'I was afraid,' answered he. 'I knew not whether I might not be deceived\nin the character of Mrs. Stornaway; and dared not intrude upon you, lest\nit should be found that the object merited not your good offices.'\n\n'But she is in distress!' said Emmeline--'she is a stranger!--and shall\nwe hesitate?--'\n\nGodolphin, who found in the tenderness of her address to him, and in the\napprobation her eyes expressed, a reward as sweet as that which the\nconsciousness of doing good afforded from his own heart; kissed the hand\nshe had given him, in silence, and then went to enquire if the poor\nyoung woman could see the ladies. She expressed her joy at being so\nfavoured, and Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline were introduced.\n\nThe compassion they expressed, and the assurances they gave her that she\nwould meet her husband in London, and that she should stay with them\n'till she did, calmed and composed her; and as her illness was merely\nowing to fatigue and anxiety, they believed a few hours rest, now her\nmind was easier, would restore her. Tho' they were impatient to get on\nto London, they yet hesitated not to remain at Canterbury all night, on\nthe account of this poor stranger. Godolphin, on hearing their\ndetermination, warmly thanked them: the heart of Emmeline was at once\neased of its inquietude, and impressed with a deeper sense than ever of\nGodolphin's worth: she gave way, almost for the first time, to her\ntenderness and esteem, without attempting to check or conceal her\nsentiments; while Mrs. Stafford, who ardently wished to see her in\npossession of her estate and married to Godolphin, rejoiced in observing\nher to be less reserved; and Godolphin himself, hardly believing the\nhappiness he possessed real, forgot all his fears of her attachment to\nLord Delamere, and dared again entertain the hopes he had discarded at\nBesan\u00c3\u00a7on--as he thought, for ever.\n\nThe next day Mrs. Stornaway was so much recovered that they proceeded in\ntheir journey, taking her into the coach with them and directing Madelon\nto travel in the chaise, accompanied by her father. They arrived early\nin town; and Godolphin, leaving them at an hotel, went in search of\nlodgings. He soon found apartments to accommodate them in Bond street;\nand thither they immediately went; Mrs. Stafford taking upon herself the\nprotection of the poor forlorn stranger 'till Godolphin could find her\nhusband, on whose behalf he immediately intended to apply for a berth on\nboard some ship in commission. He had given him a direction to his\nbanker, and bid him there leave an address where he might be found in\nLondon. The next day he brought the transported Stornaway to his wife;\nand the gratitude these poor young people expressed to their benefactor,\nconvinced the fair friends that they had deserved his kindness, and that\nthere was no deception in the story the Lieutenant had told them about\nhis wife. Godolphin took a lodging for them in Oxford street; and gave\nthem money for their support till he could get the young man employed,\nwhich his interest and indefatigable friendship soon accomplished.\n\nIn the mean time he saw Emmeline every day, and every day he rose in her\nesteem. Yet still she hesitated to discover to him all she thought of\nhim; and at times was so reserved and so guarded, that Godolphin knew\nnot what to believe. He knew she was above the paltry artifice of\ncoquetry; yet she fearfully avoided being alone with him, and never\nallowed him an opportunity of asking whether he had any thing to hope\nfrom time and assiduity.\n\n'Is he not one of the best creatures in the world?' said Mrs. Stafford,\nafter he left the room, on the second day of their arrival, to go out in\nthe service of the Stornaways.\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Yes! and is that all the praise you allow to such a man? Is he not a\nperfect character?'\n\n'As perfect, I suppose, as any of them are.'\n\n'Ah! Emmeline, you are a little hypocrite. It is impossible you can be\ninsensible of the merit of Godolphin; and I wonder you are not in more\nhaste to convince him that you think of him as he deserves.'\n\n'What would you have me do?'\n\n'Marry him.'\n\n'Before I am sure he desires it?' smilingly asked Emmeline.\n\n'You cannot doubt that, tho' you so anxiously repress every attempt he\nmakes to explain himself. Shall I tell you what he has said to me? Shall\nI tell you what motive carried him to St. Alpin?'\n\n'No--I had rather not hear any thing about it.'\n\n'And why not?'\n\n'Because it is better, for some time, if not for ever, that Godolphin\nshould be ignorant of those favourable thoughts I may have had of\nhim--better that I should cease to entertain them.'\n\n'Why so, pray?'\n\n'Because I dread the mortified pride and furious jealousy of Lord\nDelamere on one hand; and on the other the authority of my uncle, who,\n'till I am of age, will probably neither restore my fortune nor consent\nto my carrying it out of his family.'\n\n'For those very reasons you should immediately marry Godolphin. When you\nare actually married, Delamere will reconcile himself to the loss of\nyou. To an inevitable evil, even his haughty and self-willed spirit must\nsubmit. And should Lord Montreville give you any trouble about your\nfortune, who can so easily, so properly oblige him to do you justice, as\na man of spirit, of honour, of understanding, who will have a right to\ninsist upon it.'\n\nIt was impossible to deny so evident a truth. Yet still Emmeline\napprehended the consequence of Delamere's rage and disappointment; and\nthought that there would be an indelicacy and an impropriety in\nwithdrawing herself from the protection of her own family almost as soon\nas she could claim it, and that her uncle might make such a step a\npretence for new contention and longer wrath. The result, therefore, of\nall her deliberations ended in a determination neither to engage herself\nor to marry 'till she was of age; and, 'till then, not even to encourage\nany lover whatever. By that time, she hoped that Lord Delamere, wearied\nby an hopeless passion, and convinced of her fixed indifference, would\nengage in some more successful pursuit. She knew that by that time all\naffairs between her and Lord Montreville must be adjusted. If the\naffection of Godolphin was, as she hoped, fixed, and founded on his\nesteem for her character, he would not love her less at the end of that\nperiod, when she should have the power of giving him her estate\nunincumbered with difficulties and unembarrassed by law suits; and\nshould, she hoped, escape the misery of seeing Delamere's anguish and\ndespair, on which she could not bear to reflect.\n\nShe ingenuously explained to Mrs. Stafford her reasons for refusing to\nreceive Godolphin's proposals; in which her friend, tho' she allowed\nthem to be plausible, by no means acquiesced; still insisting upon it,\nthat the kindest thing she could do towards Lord Delamere, as well as\nthe properest in regard to the settlement of her estate, was immediately\nto accept Godolphin. But Emmeline was not to be convinced; and all she\ncould obtain from Mrs. Stafford was an extorted promise, reluctantly\ngiven, that she would not give any advice or encouragement to Godolphin\nimmediately to press his suit. Emmeline, tho' convinced she was right,\nyet doubted whether she had fortitude enough to persist in the conduct\nshe wished to adopt; if exposed at once to the solicitations of a woman\nof whose understanding she had an high opinion, and to the ardent\nsupplications of the man she loved.\n\nThe day after her arrival in London, she had sent to Berkley-square,\nand was informed that Lord Montreville and his family were in Norfolk.\n\nThither therefore she wrote, and enclosed the letter she had brought\nfrom Lord Westhaven. Her own was couched in the most modest and dutiful\nterms, and that of Lord Westhaven was equally mild and reasonable. But\nthey gave only disquiet and concern to the ambitious and avaricious\nbosom of Lord Montreville. Tho' already tortured by Delamere's absence\nand illness, and uncertain whether the object of his long solicitude\nwould live to reap the advantage of his accumulated fortunes, he could\nnot think but with pain and reluctance of giving up so large a portion\nof his annual income: still more unwilling did he feel to refund the\nproduce of the estates for so long a period; and in the immediate\nemotion of his vexation at receiving Lord Westhaven's first letter, he\nhad sent for Sir Richard Crofts, who, having at the time of Mr.\nMowbray's death been entrusted with all the papers and deeds which\nbelonged to him, was the most likely to know whether any were among them\nthat bore testimony to the marriage of Mr. Mowbray and Miss Stavordale.\n\nThe fact was, that a very little time before he died, his steward,\nWilliamson, had received the memorandum of which Emmeline had found a\ncopy; and, on the death of his master, had carried it to Sir Richard\nCrofts; Lord Montreville being then in the North of England. Sir Richard\neagerly enquired whether there were any other papers to the like\npurport. Williamson replied, he believed not; and very thoughtlessly\nleft it in his hands. When, a few days afterwards, he called to know in\nwhose name the business of the Mowbray estate was to be carried on, Sir\nRichard (then acting as an attorney, and only entering into life) told\nhim that every thing was to be considered as the property of Lord\nMontreville; because there were many doubts about the marriage of Mr.\nMowbray, and great reason to think that the paper in question was\nwritten merely with a view to pique and perplex his brother, with whom\nhe was then at variance; but that Lord Montreville would enquire into\nthe business, and certainly do justice to any claims the infant might\nhave on the estate.\n\nSoon after, Williamson applied again to have the paper restored; but\nCrofts answered, that he should keep it, by order of Lord Montreville,\ntho' it was of no use; his Lordship having obtained undoubted\ninformation that his brother was never married.\n\nSir Richard had reflected on the great advantage that would accrue to\nhis patron from the possession of this estate; to which, besides it's\nannual income, several boroughs belonged. He thought it was very\nprobable that the little girl, then only a few weeks old, and without a\nmother or any other than mercenary attendants, might die in her infancy:\nif she did not, that Lord Montreville might easily provide for her, and\nthat it would be doing his friend a great service, and be highly\nadvantageous to himself, should he conceal the legal claim of the child,\neven unknown to her uncle, and put him in immediate possession of his\npaternal estate.\n\nHaving again strictly questioned Williamson; repressed his curiosity by\nlaw jargon; and frightened him by threats of his Lord's displeasure if\nhe made any effort to prove the legitimacy of Emmeline; he very\ntranquilly destroyed the paper, and Lord Montreville never knew that\nsuch a paper had existed.\n\nWilliamson, timid and ignorant of every thing beyond his immediate\nbusiness, returned in great doubt and uneasiness to Mowbray Castle. When\nhe received the child and the two caskets, he had questioned the\nFrenchman who brought her and heard an absolute confirmation of the\nmarriage of his master. He then examined the caskets, and found the\ncertificates. But without money or friends, he knew not how to prosecute\nthe claim of the orphan against the power and affluence of Lord\nMontreville; and after frequent consultations with Mrs. Carey, they\nagreed that the safest way would be carefully to secure those papers\ntill Emmeline was old enough to find friends; for should they attempt\npreviously to procure justice for her, they might probably lose the\npapers which proved her birth, as they had already done that which\nWilliamson had delivered to Crofts. As long as Williamson lived, he\ncarefully locked up these caskets. His sudden death prevented him from\ntaking any steps to establish the claim of his orphan mistress; and that\nof Mrs. Carey two years afterwards, involved the whole affair in\nobscurity, which made Sir Richard quite easy as to any future discovery.\n\nBut as the aggressor never forgives, Sir Richard had conceived against\nEmmeline the most unmanly and malignant hatred, and had invariably\nopposed every tendency which he had observed in Lord Montreville to\nbefriend and assist her, for no other reason but that he had already\nirreparably injured her.\n\nHe hoped, that as he had at length divided her from Lord Delamere, and\ndriven her abroad, she would there marry a foreigner, and be farther\nremoved than ever from the family, and from any chance of recovering the\nproperty of which he had deprived her: instead of which, she had, in\nconsequence of going thither, met the very man in whose power it was to\nprove the marriage of her mother; and, in Lord Westhaven, had found a\nprotector too intelligent and too steady to be discouraged by evasion or\nchicanery--too powerful and too affluent to be thrown out of the\npursuit, either by the enmity it might raise or the expence it might\ndemand.\n\nNothing could exceed the chagrin of Sir Richard when Lord Montreville\nput into his hands the first letter he had on this subject from Lord\nWesthaven. Accustomed, however, to command his countenance, he said,\nwithout any apparent emotion, that as no papers in confirmation of the\nfact alledged had ever existed among those delivered to him on the death\nof Mr. Mowbray, it was probably some forgery that had imposed on Lord\nWesthaven.\n\n'I see not how that can be,' answered Lord Montreville. 'It is not\nlikely that Emmeline Mowbray could forge such papers, or should even\nconceive such an idea.'\n\n'True, my Lord. But your Lordship forgets and overlooks and passes by\nthe long abode and continuance and residence she has made with the\nStaffords. Mrs. Stafford is, to my certain knowledge and conviction,\nartful and designing and intrigueing; a woman, my Lord, who affects and\npretends and presumes to understand and be competent and equal to\nbusiness and affairs and concerns with which women should never\ninterfere or meddle or interest themselves. It is clearly and evidently\nand certainly to the interest and advantage and benefit of this woman,\nthat Miss Mowbray, over whom she has great influence and power and\nauthority, should be established and fixed and settled in affluence,\nrather than remain and abide and continue where nature and justice and\nreason have placed her.'\n\n'I own, Sir Richard, I cannot see the thing in this light. However, to\ndo nothing rashly, let us consider how to proceed.'\n\nSir Richard then advised him by no means to answer Lord Westhaven's\nletter, but to wait till he saw his Lordship; as in cases so momentous,\nit was, he said, always wrong to give any thing in black and white. In a\nfew days afterwards he heard out of Norfolk, (for he had come up from\nthence to consult with Sir Richard Crofts) that Lord Delamere was ill\nat Besan\u00c3\u00a7on. His precipitate departure had before given him the most\npoignant concern; and now his fears for his life completed the distress\nof this unfortunate father. On receiving, however, the second letter\nfrom Lord Westhaven, together with that of Emmeline, his apprehensions\nfor the life of his son were removed, and left his mind at liberty to\nrecur again to the impending loss of four thousand five hundred a year,\nwith the unpleasant accompanyment of being obliged to refund above sixty\nthousand pounds. Again Sir Richard Crofts was sent for, and again he\ntried to quiet the apprehensions of Lord Montreville. But his attempt to\npersuade him that the whole might be a deception originating with the\nStaffords, obtained not a moment's attention. He knew Stafford himself\nwas weak, ignorant, and indolent, and would neither have had sagacity to\nthink of or courage to execute such a design; and that Mrs. Stafford\nshould imagine and perform it seemed equally improbable. He was\nperfectly aware that Lord Westhaven had a thorough acquaintance with\nbusiness, and was of all men on earth the most unlikely to enter warmly\ninto such an affair, (against the interest too of the family into which\nhe had married) unless he was very sure of having very good grounds for\nhis interference.\n\nBut tho' Sir Richard could not prevail on him to disbelieve the whole of\nthe story, he saw that his Lordship thought with great reluctance of the\nnecessity he should be under of relinquishing the whole of the fortune.\nHe now therefore recommended it to him to remain quiet, at least 'till\nLord Westhaven came to England; to send an answer to Miss Mowbray that\nmeant nothing; and to gain time for farther enquiries. These enquiries\nhe himself undertook; and leaving Lord Montreville in a political fit of\nthe gout, he returned from Audley Hall to London, and bent all his\nthoughts to the accomplishment of his design; which was, to get the\noriginal papers out of the hands of Emmeline, and to bribe Le Limosin to\ngo back to France.\n\nWhile these things were passing in England, Lord Delamere (whose rage\nand indignation at Emmeline's departure the authority of Lord Westhaven\ncould hardly restrain) had learned from his brother-in-law the real\ncircumstances of the birth of his cousin, and he heard them with the\ngreatest satisfaction. He now thought it certain that his father would\npress his marriage as eagerly as he had before opposed it; and that so\ngreat an obstacle being removed, and Emmeline wholly in the power of\nhis family, she would be easily brought to forgive him and to comply\nwith the united wishes of all her relations.\n\nIn this hope, and being assured by Lord Westhaven that Bellozane was\nactually returned into Switzerland without any design of following\nEmmeline, (who had been induced, he said, to leave Besan\u00c3\u00a7on purely to\navoid him) he consented to attempt attaining a greater command over his\ntemper, on which the re-establishment of his health depended; and after\nabout ten days, was able to travel. Lord and Lady Westhaven, therefore,\nat the end of that time, slowly began with him their journey to England.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nEmmeline had now been almost a week in London; and Mrs. Stafford, with\nthe assistance of Godolphin, had succeeded so much better than she\nexpected, in the arrangement of some of those affairs in which she\napprehended the most difficulty, that very little remained for her to do\nbefore she should be enabled to return to France (where her husband was\nto sign some papers to secure his safety); and that little depended on\nJames Crofts, who seemed to be making artificial delay, and trying to\ngive her all the trouble and perplexity in his power.\n\nHe had, however, another motive than merely to harrass and distress her.\nHis father had employed him to deal with Le Limosin; well knowing that\nthere was nothing so base and degrading that he would not undertake\nwhere his interest was in question; and Sir Richard had promised him a\nconsiderable addition to his fortune if he had address enough to prevent\nso capital a sum as Emmeline claimed from being deducted from that of\nthe family to whom his brother was allied; and from whence he had\nexpectations, which could not but suffer from such a diminution of it's\nwealth and interest.\n\nThe tediousness therefore that the Crofts' created promised still to\ndetain Emmeline in London; and her uncle's letter, which coldly and\nhardly with civility deferred any conference on her affairs till the\narrival of Lord Westhaven, convinced her that from his tenderness she\nhad nothing, from his justice, little to hope.\n\nGodolphin was very anxious to be allowed personally to apply to him on\nthe claim of his niece. But this Emmeline positively refused. She would\nnot even allow Mr. Newton, the lawyer to whom Lord Westhaven had\nrecommended her, and in whose hands her papers were safely deposited, to\nwrite officially to Lord Montreville; but determined to wait quietly the\nreturn of Lord Westhaven himself, on whom she knew neither the anger of\nher uncle, or the artifices of Sir Richard, would make any impression;\nwhile his Lordship's interference could not be imputed to such motives\nas might possibly be thought to influence Godolphin, or would it give\nher the appearance of proceeding undutifully and harshly against Lord\nMontreville, which appearances she might be liable to, should she\nhastily institute a suit against him.\n\nShe grew, however, very uneasy at the determined attendance of\nGodolphin, whose presence she knew was so necessary to poor Lady\nAdelina. She saw that he was anxious about his sister, yet could not\ndetermine to tear himself from _her_; and to insist upon his returning\nto Lady Adelina, would be to assume a right, to which, on the footing\nthey were, she declined pretending. She failed not, however, every day\nto represent to him the long solitude in which Lady Adelina had been\nleft, and to read to him parts of her letters which breathed only sorrow\nand depression. Whenever this happened, Godolphin heard her with\nconcern, and promised to set out the next day; but still something was\nto be done for the service of Emmeline, and still he could not bear to\nresign the delight he had now so long enjoyed of seeing her every day,\nand of indulging those hopes she had tacitly allowed him to entertain.\n\nMrs. Stafford, notwithstanding her promise to Emmeline, had not been\nable to forbear discovering to him part of the truth. Yet when he\nreflected on the advantages Delamere had over him in fortune, in rank,\nin the influence his family connection and his former engagement might\ngive him, he trembled least, if he should be himself absent when Lord\nDelamere arrived, her tender and timid spirit would yield to the sorrow\nof her lover and the authority of her family; and that almost in despite\nof herself, he might lose her for ever. While he yet lingered, and\ncontinued to promise that he would go to the Isle of Wight, the eight\nfirst days of their stay in town glided away. Early in the morning of\nthe ninth, Godolphin entered the room where Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline\nwere at breakfast.\n\n'I must now indeed,' said he, 'lose no time in going to Adelina. I am to\nday informed that Mr. Trelawny is dead.'\n\n'Shall we then see Lady Adelina in town?' eagerly asked Emmeline, who\ncould not affect any concern at the death of such a man.\n\n'I apprehend not,' replied Godolphin. 'Whatever business there may be to\nsettle with the Bancrafts, I am sure will be more proper for me than for\nher. To them I must now go, at Putney; and only came to inform you,\nMadam,' addressing himself to Mrs. Stafford, 'of the reason of my sudden\nabsence.'\n\n'Shall you return again to London, Sir, before you proceed into\nHampshire?'\n\n'Not unless you or Miss Mowbray will allow me to suppose that to either\nof you my return may be in any way serviceable.'\n\nMrs. Stafford assured him she had nothing to trouble him upon which\nrequired such immediate attention. Emmeline then attempted to make an\nanswer of the same kind. But tho' she had for some days wished him to\ngo, she could not see him on the point of departing without being\nsensible of the anguish his absence would occasion her; and instead of\nspeaking distinctly her thanks, she only murmured something, and was so\nnear bursting into tears, that fearing to expose herself, she was\nhurrying out of the room.\n\n'No message--no letter--not one kind word,' said he, gently detaining\nher, 'to poor Adelina? Nothing to your little _proteg\u00c3\u00a9_?'\n\n'My--love to them both, Sir?'\n\n'And will you not write to my sister?'\n\n'By the post,' said Emmeline, struggling to get from him to conceal her\nemotion.\n\nHe then kissed her hand, and suffered her to go. While the explanation\nMrs. Stafford gave of her real feelings, elated him to rapture, in which\nhe departed, protesting that nothing should prevent his return, to\nfollow the good fortune which he now believed might be his, as soon as\nhe could adjust his sister's business with her husband's relations.\n\nMrs. Stafford recommended it to him to bring Lady Adelina to London with\nhim, as the affection Emmeline had for her would inevitably give her\ngreat influence. Godolphin, in answer to this advice, only shook his\nhead; and Mrs. Stafford remained uncertain of his intentions to follow\nit.\n\nA few days now elapsed without any extraordinary occurrence. Emmeline\nthought less of the impending restoration of her fortune (for of it's\nrestoration Mr. Newton assured her he had no doubt), than of him with\nwhom she hoped to share it. She impatiently longed to hear from Lady\nAdelina that he was with her: and sometimes her mind dwelt with painful\nsolicitude on Lady Westhaven and Delamere, for whose health and safety\nshe was truly anxious, and of whom she had received no account since her\narrival in London.\n\nAs she was performing the promise she had made to Godolphin of writing\nto Lady Adelina by an early post, Le Limosin announced Mr. James Crofts;\nwho immediately entered the room with his usual jerking and familiar\nwalk. Emmeline, who incapable as she was of hating any body, yet felt\ntowards him a disgust almost amounting to hatred, received him with the\ncoldest reserve, and Mrs. Stafford with no more civility than was\nrequisite to prevent his alledging her rudeness and impatience as\nreasons for not settling the business on which she concluded he came.\n\nHe began with general conversation; and when Mrs. Stafford, impatient to\nhave done with him, introduced that which went more immediately to the\nadjustment of the affair she wished to settle, he told her, that being\nextremely unwilling to discuss a matter of business with a _lady_, and\napprehensive of giving offence to one for whom he and his dear Mrs.\nCrofts had so sincere a regard, he had determined to leave all the\nconcerns yet between them to his attorney; a man of strict honour and\nprobity, to whom he would give her a direction, and to whom it would be\nbetter for _her_ attorney to apply, than that they should themselves\nenter on a topic whereon it was probable they might differ.\n\nMrs. Stafford, vexed at his dissimulation and finesse, again pressed him\nto come to a conclusion without the interference of lawyers. But he\nagain repeated the set speech he had formed on the occasion; and then\naddressing himself to Emmeline, asked smilingly, and affecting an\ninterest in her welfare, 'whether the information he had received was\ntrue?'\n\n'What information, Sir?'\n\n'That Miss Mowbray has the most authentic claim to the estate of her\nlate father.'\n\n'It is by no means an established claim, Sir; and such as you must\nexcuse me if I decline talking of.'\n\n'I am told you have papers that put it out of dispute. If you would\nfavour me with a sight of them, perhaps I could give you some insight\ninto the proceedings you should commence; and I am sure my friendship\nand regard would make any service I could do you a real satisfaction to\nmyself.'\n\n'I thank you, Sir, for your professions. The papers in question are in\nthe hands of Mr. Newton of Lincolns Inn. If he will allow you to see\nthem I have no objection.'\n\n'You intend then,' said James Crofts, unable entirely to conceal his\nchagrin--'you intend to begin a suit with my Lord Montreville?'\n\n'By no means, Sir. I am persuaded there will be no necessity for it. But\nas you have just referred Mrs. Stafford to a lawyer, I must beg leave to\nsay, that if _you_ have any questions to ask you must apply to mine.'\n\nJames Crofts, quite disconcerted notwithstanding his presumptuous\nassurance, was not ready with an answer; and Emmeline, who doubted not\nthat he was sent by his father to gain what intelligence he could, was\nso provoked, that not conceiving herself obliged to preserve the\nappearance of civility to a man she despised, she left him in possession\nof the room, from whence Mrs. Stafford had a few moments before\ndeparted. He therefore was obliged to withdraw; having found his attempt\nto shake the integrity of Le Limosin as fruitless as that he had made to\nget sight of the papers.\n\nHe had not long been gone, when a servant brought to Emmeline the\nfollowing note.--\n\n\n    'I have heard you are in town with Mrs. Stafford, and beg leave\n  to wait on you. Do not, _ma douce amie_, refuse to grant me this\n  favour. Besides the happiness of seeing you and your friend, I have\n  another very particular reason for soliciting you to grant such an\n  indulgence to\n\n                                                    GEORGE FITZ-EDWARD.\n\n    'I write this from a neighbouring coffee-house, where I expect\n  your answer.'\n\n\nEmmeline immediately carried this billet to Mrs. Stafford; who told her\nthere was no reason why she should refuse the request it contained. She\ntherefore wrote a card of compliment to Colonel Fitz-Edward, signifying\nthat she should be glad to see him.\n\nIn a few moments Fitz-Edward appeared; and Emmeline, tho' aware of his\narrival, could not receive him without confusion and emotion. Nor could\nshe without pity behold his altered countenance and manner, so different\nfrom what they were when she first saw the gay and gallant Fitz-Edward\nat Mowbray Castle. He began by expressing, with great appearance of\nsincerity, his joy at seeing her; enquired after Lord Delamere, and\nmentioned his astonishment at what he had heard--that Delamere had so\nrepeatedly enquired after him, and signified such a wish to see him, yet\nhad never written to him to explain his business.\n\nEmmeline, who knew well on what he had so earnestly desired to meet him,\nblushed, but did not think it necessary to clear up a subject which\nGodolphin's explanation to Delamere had rendered no longer alarming.\n\n'You know, perhaps,' said Fitz-Edward, 'that Mr. Trelawny is dead.'\n\n'I do.'\n\n'And your fair unhappy friend?--May I now--(or is it still a crime,)\nenquire after her.'\n\n'She is, I believe, well,' answered Emmeline, 'and remains at the house\nof her brother.'\n\n'Tell me, Miss Mowbray--will she after a proper time refuse, do you\nthink, her consent to see me? will _you_, my lovely friend, undertake to\nplead for me? will you and Mrs. Stafford, who know with what solicitude\nI sought her, with what anguish I deplored her loss, intercede on my\nbehalf?--you, who know how fondly my heart has been devoted to her from\nthe moment of our fatal parting?'\n\n'I can undertake nothing of this kind, Sir. The fate of Lady Adelina\ndepends, I apprehend, on her brothers. To them I think you should\napply.'\n\n'And why not to herself? Is she not now at liberty? And when destiny has\nat length broken the cruel chains with which she was loaded, will she\nvoluntarily bind herself with others hardly more supportable? If she\nrefers me to her brothers, I must despair:--the cold-hearted Lord\nWesthaven, the inflexible and rigid Godolphin, will make it a mistaken\npoint of honour to divide us for ever!'\n\n'You cannot suppose, Sir, that _I_ shall undertake to influence Lady\nAdelina to measures disapproved by her family. I know not that Lord\nWesthaven is cold and unfeeling as you describe him: on the contrary, I\nbelieve he unites one of the best heads and warmest hearts. If your\nrequest is proper, you certainly risk nothing by referring it to him.'\n\nOf Godolphin she spoke not; fearful of betraying to the penetrating and\nobserving Fitz-Edward how little he answered in her idea the character\nof unfeeling and severe.\n\n'I know not what to do,' said Fitz-Edward. 'Should I address myself to\nher brothers without success, I am undone; since I well know that from\ntheir decision there will be no appeal. I cannot live without her,\nEmmeline--indeed I cannot; and in the hope only of what has lately\nhappened, have I dragged on till now a reluctant existence. Once, and\nbut once, I dared write to her. But her brother returned the letter. She\nsuffered him cruelly to return it, in a cover in which he informed me,\n\"that the peace and honour of Lady Adelina Trelawny made it necessary\nfor her to forget that such a man existed as Colonel Fitz-Edward.\"\nGodolphin,' continued he--'Godolphin may carry this too far; he may\noblige me to remind him that there is more than one way in which his\ninexorable punctilio may be satisfied.'\n\n'Certainly,' cried Emmeline, in great agitation, which she vainly\nstruggled to conceal, 'there is no method more likely to convince Lady\nAdelina of your tenderness for her, than that you hint at; and if you\nshould be fortunate enough to destroy a brother to whom she owes every\nthing, your triumph will be complete.'\n\n'Prevent then the necessity of my applying to Godolphin by speaking to\nLady Adelina in my favour. Ask her whether she can divest herself of all\nregard for me? ask her whether she can condemn me to eternal regret and\ndespair?'\n\n'I cannot indeed. I am not likely to see her; and if I were, this is a\nsubject on which nothing shall induce me to influence her.'\n\nMrs. Stafford, who had been detained in another room by a person who\ncame to her upon business, now joined them; and Fitz-Edward without\nhesitation repeated to her what he had been saying to Emmeline.\n\n'I do not think indeed, Colonel, that Miss Mowbray can interfere; and I\nam of her opinion, that as soon as such proposals as you intend to make\nare proper, you should address them to her brothers.'\n\n'Mr. Godolphin, Madam, treats me in a way which only my tenderness, my\nlove for his sister, induces me to bear. I have met him accidentally,\nand he passes rudely by me. I sent a gentleman to him to desire an\namicable interview. He answered, that as we could not meet as friends,\nhe must be excused from seeing me at all. Had I been as rash, as cruel\nas he seems to be, I should then have noticed, in the way it demanded,\nsuch a message: but conscious that I had already injured him, I bore\nwith his petulance and his asperity. I love Godolphin,' continued\nhe--'from our boyish days I have loved and respected him. I know the\nnobleness of his nature, and I can make great allowances for the\nimpatience of injured honour. But will he not carry it too far, if now\nthat his sister is released from her detested marriage he still persists\nin dividing us?'\n\n'You are not sure,' said Mrs. Stafford, 'that he will do so. Have\npatience at least till the time is elapsed when you may try the\nexperiment. In the interim I will consider what ought to be done.'\n\n'My ever excellent, ever amiable friend!' exclaimed Fitz-Edward\nwarmly--'how much do I owe you already! Ah! add yet to those obligations\nthe restoration of Adelina, and I shall be indebted to you for more than\nlife. As to you, my sweet marble-hearted Emmeline, I heartily pray that\nall your coldness both towards me and poor Delamere may be revenged by\nyour feeling, on behalf of him, all the pain you have inflicted.'\n\nAlas! thought Emmeline, your wicked wish is already accomplished, tho'\nnot in favour of poor Delamere.\n\nFitz-Edward then obtained permission to wait on them again; tho' Mrs.\nStafford very candidly told him, that after Captain Godolphin came to\ntown, she begged he would forbear coming in when he heard of his being\nthere.\n\n'We will try,' said she, 'to conciliate matters between you, so that ye\nmay meet in peace; and till then pray forbear to meet at all.'\n\nFitz-Edward, flattering himself that Mrs. Stafford would interest\nherself for him, and that Emmeline, however reserved, would be rather\nhis friend than his enemy, departed in rather better spirits; and left\nthe fair friends to debate on the means of preventing what was very\nlikely to happen--a difference of the most alarming kind between him and\nGodolphin, should the latter persist in refusing him permission to\naddress, at a proper season, Lady Adelina.\n\nThe long delays that seemed likely to arise before her own business\nwould be adjusted with Lord Montreville; the fiery and impatient spirits\nwith which it appeared to be her lot to contend; the vexation to which\nshe saw Mrs. Stafford subjected by the sordid and cruel conduct of the\nCrofts' towards her; and lastly, her encreasing disquietude about\nGodolphin, whom she feared to encourage, yet was equally unwilling and\nunable to repulse; oppressed her spirits, and made her stay in London\nvery disagreeable to her. She had never before been in it for more than\na night or two; and at this time of the year (it was the beginning of\nOctober) the melancholy, deserted houses in the fashionable streets, and\nthe languor that appeared in the countenances of those who were obliged\nto be in town, offered no amusement or variety to compensate for the\nloss of the pure air she had been accustomed to breathe, or for the\nbeautiful and interesting landscapes which she remembered to have\nenjoyed in Autumn at Mowbray Castle; where she so much languished to be,\nthat she sometimes thought, if her uncle would resign it and the estate\nimmediately around, to her, she could be content to leave him in\npossession of the rest of that fortune he coveted with so much avidity.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nA few days longer passed, and Emmeline yet heard nothing of the return\nof Lord and Lady Westhaven; a circumstance at which she grew extremely\nuneasy. Not only as it gave her reason to fear for the health of Lord\nDelamere, for whom she was very anxious; but for that of Lady Westhaven,\nwhom she so tenderly loved.\n\nShe observed too, with concern, that under pretence of waiting the\narrival of his son and his son in law, Lord Montreville delayed all\nadvances towards a settlement; and that Mrs. Stafford, wearied by the\nduplicity and chicanery of the Crofts', and miserable in being detained\nso long from her children, grew quite disheartened, and was prevented\nonly by her affection for Emmeline from returning to France and\nabandoning all hopes of an accommodation which every day seemed more\ndifficult and more distant.\n\nThe arrival of Lord Westhaven was on her account particularly desirable,\nas he had promised Emmeline to make a point of assisting her; and on his\nassurances she knew it was safe to rely, since they were neither made to\ngive himself an air of importance, nor meant to quiet the trouble of\npresent importunity, by holding out the prospect of future advantage\nnever thought of more.\n\nNothing, however, could be done to hasten this important arrival; and\nthe fair friends, tho' uneasy and impatient, were obliged to submit. But\nfrom the restlessness of daily suspence, they were roused by two\nletters; which brought in it's place only poignant concern. That to Mrs.\nStafford was from her husband; who, tho' he had neither relish for her\nconversation nor respect for her virtues, was yet dissatisfied without\nher; and even while she was wholly occupied in serving him, tormented\nher with murmurs and suspicions. He scrupled not to hint, 'that as she\nwas with her beloved Miss Mowbray, she forgot her duty to her family;\nand that as she had been now gone near a month, he thought it quite long\nenough, not only to have done the business she undertook, but to have\nenjoyed as much pleasure as was in her situation reasonable. He\ntherefore expected her to return to France, and supposed that she had\nsettled every thing to facilitate his coming back to England.' The\nunreasonable expectations, and ungrateful suspicions, which this letter\ncontained, overwhelmed her with mortification. To return without having\nfinished the business on which she came, would be to expose herself to\ninsult and reproach; yet to stay longer, without a probability of\nsucceeding by her stay, would only occasion an aggravation of his ill\nhumour, and probably a worse reception when she rejoined him.\n\nThe letter to Emmeline was from Lady Adelina, and ran thus.--\n\n\n                                                _East Cliff, Oct. 16._\n\n    'Godolphin, my Emmeline, is at length returned to your unhappy\n  friend, who has passed many, many melancholy days since he left her.\n  My dear brother appears not only in better health, but in better\n  spirits than when he went from hence. Ought I then to repine? when I\n  see him, and when he tells me that you are well; and that affluence,\n  and with it, I hope, happiness will be your's? The very name of\n  happiness and of Adelina should not come in the same page! Ah! never\n  must they any where meet again. Pardon me for thus recurring to\n  myself: but the mournful topic will intrude! Unhappy Trelawny! he\n  had not quite compleated his twenty-fifth year. Tho' I never either\n  loved or esteemed him, and tho' to my early and hasty marriage I owe\n  all the misery of my life, his death has something shocking in it.\n  My weak spirits, which have of late been unusually deranged, are\n  sadly affected by it. Yet surely in regard to _him_ I have little to\n  reproach myself. Did he not abandon me to my destiny? did he not\n  plunge headlong into follies from which he resented even an effort\n  to save him? Alas! unless I could have given him that understanding\n  which nature\n  had denied him, my solicitude must ever have been vain! It is\n  some alleviation, too, to my concern, to reflect, that as much of\n  his honour as depended on me, has not, by the breath of public\n  fame, been sullied. And I try to persuade myself, that since his\n  life was useful to nobody, and had long been, from intemperance,\n  burthensome to himself, I should not suffer his death to dwell so\n  heavily upon me. Yet in spite of every effort to shake off the\n  melancholy which devours me, it encreases upon me; and to you I may\n  say, for you will hear and pity me, that there exists not at this\n  moment so complete a wretch as your Adelina!\n\n    'To my brother William, all gentle and generous as he is, I cannot\n  complain. It were ingratitude to let him see how little all his\n  tenderness avails towards reconciling me to myself; towards healing\n  the wounds of my depressed spirit, and quieting the murmurs of this\n  feeble heart. Yet methinks to have a friend, in whose compassionate\n  bosom I might pour out it's weakness and it's sorrows, would\n  mitigate the extreme severity of those sufferings which are now more\n  than I can bear.\n\n    'Where have I on earth such a friend but in my Emmeline? And will\n  she refuse to come to me? Ah! wherefore should she refuse it? I\n  shall be alone; for Godolphin is obliged to go immediately to London\n  to settle all the business I shall now ever have with the family of\n  Trelawny, and put it on such a footing as may preclude the necessity\n  of my ever meeting any of them hereafter. He tells me that your\n  affairs advance nothing till Lord Westhaven's return; and that our\n  dear Mrs. Stafford talks of being obliged to go back to her family.\n  If she must do so, you will not stay in London alone; and where is\n  your company so fondly desired, where can you have such an\n  opportunity of exercising your generous goodness, as in coming\n  hither? Our little boy--do you not long to embrace him? Ah! lovely\n  as he is, why dare I not indulge all the pleasure and all the pride\n  I might feel in seeing him; and wherefore must anguish so keen\n  mingle with tenderness so delicious!\n\n    'Ah! my friend, come to me, I entreat, I implore you! The reasons\n  why I cannot see London, are of late multiplied rather than removed,\n  and I can only have the happiness of embracing you here. Hesitate\n  not to oblige me then; for I every hour wish more and more ardently\n  to see you. When I awake from my imperfect slumbers, your presence\n  is the first desire of my heart: I figure you to myself as I wander\n  forth on my solitary walks.\n\n    And when I _do_ sleep, the image of my angelic friend,\n  consolatory and gentle, makes me some amends for visions less\n  pleasant, that disturb it.\n\n    'Ah! let me not see you in dreams alone; for above all I want\n  you--\"when I am alone with poor Adelina.\" Come, O come; and if it be\n  possible--save me--from myself!\n\n                                                                  A.T.'\n\n\nThe melancholy tenor of this letter greatly affected Emmeline. She\nwished almost as eagerly as her friend to be with her. But how could she\ndetermine to become an inmate at the house of Godolphin, even tho' he\nwas himself to be absent from it? She communicated, however, Lady\nAdelina's request to Mrs. Stafford, who could see no objection to any\nplan which might promote the interest of Godolphin. She represented\ntherefore to Emmeline how very disagreeable it would be to her to be\nleft alone in town, when she should herself be obliged to leave her, as\nmust now soon happen. That there was, in fact, no very proper asylum for\nher but the house of her uncle, which he seemed not at all disposed to\noffer her. But that to Lady Adelina's proposal there could be no\nreasonable objection, especially as Godolphin was not to be there.\n\nEmmeline yet hesitated; till another letter from Stafford, more harsh\nand unreasonable than the first, obliged her friend to fix on the\nfollowing Thursday for her departure; the absurd impatience of her\nhusband thus defeating it's own purpose; and Emmeline, partly influenced\nby her persuasions, and yet more by her own wishes, determined at length\nto fix the same time for beginning her journey to the Isle of Wight.\n\nThere was yet two days to intervene; and Mrs. Stafford was obliged to\nemploy the first of them in the city, among lawyers and creditors of her\nhusband. From scenes so irksome she readily allowed Miss Mowbray to\nexcuse herself; who therefore remained at home, and was engaged in\nlooking over some poems she had purchased, when she heard a rap at the\ndoor, and the voice of Godolphin on the stairs enquiring of Le Limosin\nfor Mrs. Stafford. Le Limosin told him that she was from home, but that\nMademoiselle Mowbray was in the dining room. He sent up to know if he\nmight be admitted. Emmeline had no pretence for refusing him, and\nreceived him with a mixture of confusion and pleasure, which she\nineffectually attempted to hide under the ordinary forms of civility.\n\nThe eyes of Godolphin were animated by the delight of beholding her. But\nwhen she enquired after Lady Adelina, as she almost immediately did,\nthey assumed a more melancholy expression.\n\n'Adelina is far from being well,' said he. 'Has she not written to you?'\n\n'She has.'\n\n'And has she not preferred a request to you?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'What answer do you mean to give it? Will you refuse once more to bless\nand relieve, by your presence, my unhappy sister?'\n\n'I do not know,' said Emmeline, deeply blushing, 'that I ought,\n(especially without the concurrence of my uncle,) to consent; yet to\ncontribute to the satisfaction of Lady Adelina--to give _her_ any degree\nof happiness--what is there I can refuse?'\n\n'Adorable, angelic goodness!' eagerly cried Godolphin. 'Best, as well as\nloveliest of human creatures! You go then?'\n\n'I intend beginning my journey on Thursday.'\n\n'And you will allow me to see you safe thither?'\n\n'There can surely be no occasion to give you that trouble, Sir,' said\nEmmeline apprehensively; 'nor ought you to think of it, since Lady\nAdelina's affairs certainly require your attendance in London.'\n\n'They do; but not so immediately as to prevent my attending you to East\nCliff. If you will suffer me to do that, I promise instantly to return.'\n\n'No. I go only attended by my servants or go not at all.'\n\nGodolphin was mortified to find her so determined. And easily\ndiscouraged from those hopes which he had indulged rather from the\nflattering prospects offered to him by Mrs. Stafford than presumption\nfounded on his own remarks, he now again felt all his apprehensions\nrenewed of her latent affection for Delamere. The acute anguish to which\nthose ideas exposed him, and their frequent return, determined him now\nto attempt knowing at once, whether he had or had not that place in\nEmmeline's heart which Mrs. Stafford had assured him he had long\npossessed.\n\nSitting down near her, therefore, he said, gravely--'As I may not, Miss\nMowbray, soon have again the happiness I now enjoy, will you allow me to\naddress you on a subject which you must long have known to be nearest\nmy heart; but on which you have so anxiously avoided every explanation I\nhave attempted, that I fear intruding too much on your complaisance if I\nenter upon it.'\n\nEmmeline found she could not avoid hearing him; and sat silent, her\nheart violently beating. Godolphin went on.--\n\n'From the first moment I beheld you, my heart was your's. I attempted,\nindeed, at the beginning of our acquaintance--ah! how vainly\nattempted!--to conquer a passion which I believed was rendered hopeless\nby your prior engagement. While I supposed you the promised wife of Lord\nDelamere, I concealed, as well as I was able, my sufferings, and never\noffended you with an hint of their severity. Had you married him, I\nthink I could have carried them in silence to the grave. Those ties,\nhowever, Lord Delamere himself broke; and I then thought myself at\nliberty to solicit your favour. It was for that purpose I took the road\nto St. Alpin, when the unhappy Delamere stopped me at Besan\u00c3\u00a7on.\n\n'When I afterwards related to you his illness; the sorrow, the lively\nand generous sorrow, you expressed for _him_, and the cold and reserved\nmanner in which you received _me_, made me still believe, that tho' he\nhad relinquished your hand he yet possessed your heart. I saw it with\nanguish, and continued silent. All that passed at Besan\u00c3\u00a7on confirmed me\nin this opinion. I determined to tear myself away, and again conceal in\nsolitude a passion, which, while I felt it to be incurable, I feared was\nhopeless. Accident, however, detaining me at Calais, again threw me in\nyour way; and I heard, that far from having renewed your engagement with\nLord Delamere, you had left him to avoid his eager importunity. Dare I\nadd--that _then_, my pity for him was lost in the hopes I presumed to\nform for myself; and studiously as you have avoided giving me an\nopportunity of speaking to you, I have yet ventured to flatter myself\nthat you beheld not with anger or scorn, my ardent, my fond attachment.'\n\nFrom the beginning of this speech to it's conclusion, the encreasing\nconfusion of Emmeline deprived her of all power of answering it. With\ndeepened blushes, and averted eyes, she at first sought for refuge in\naffecting to be intent on the netting she drew from her work box; but\nhaving spoiled a whole row, her trembling hands could no longer go on\nwith it; and as totally her tongue refused to utter the answer, which,\nby the pause he made, she concluded Godolphin expected. After a moment,\nhowever, he went on.\n\n'I have by no means encouraged visions so delightful, without a severe\nalloy of fear and mistrust. Frequently, your coldness, your unkindness,\ngives me again to despondence; and every lovely prospect I had suffered\nmy imagination to draw, is lost in clouds and darkness. Yet I am\nconvinced you do not _intend_ to torture me; and that from Miss Mowbray\nI may expect that candour, that explicit conduct, of which common minds\nare incapable. Tell me then, dearest and loveliest Emmeline, may I\nventure to hope that tender bosom is not wholly insensible? Will you\nhear me with patience, and even with pity?'\n\n'What, Sir, can I say?' faulteringly asked Emmeline. 'I am in a great\nmeasure dependant, at least for some time, on Lord Montreville; and till\nI am of age, have determined to hear nothing on the subject on which you\nare pleased to address me.'\n\n'Admitting it to be so,' answered Godolphin, 'give me but an hope to\nlive upon till then!'\n\n'I will not deny, Sir,' said Emmeline still more faintly, 'I will not\ndeny that my esteem for your character--my--my'\n\n'Oh! speak!' exclaimed Godolphin eagerly--'speak, and tell me that----'\n\nAt this moment Le Limosin hastily came into the room, and\nsaid--'_Mademoiselle, le Chevalier de Bellozane demande permission de\nvous parler._'[39]\n\nGodolphin, vexed at the interruption, and embarrassed at the arrival of\nthe Chevalier, said hastily--'You will not see him?'\n\n'How can I refuse him?' answered she; 'perhaps he comes with some\nintelligence of your brother--of my dear Lady Westhaven.'\n\nBy this time the Chevalier was in the room. Emmeline received him with\nanxious and confused looks, arising entirely from her apprehensions\nabout Lady Westhaven and Lord Delamere; but the vanity of Bellozane saw\nin it only a struggle between her real sentiments and her affectation of\nconcealment. She almost instantly, however, enquired after her friends.\n\n'I left them,' said Bellozane, 'almost as soon as you did, and went\n(because I wanted money and my father wanted to see _me_,) back to St.\nAlpin, where I staid almost a fortnight; and having obtained a necessary\nrecruit of cash, I set off for Paris; where (my leave of absence being\nto expire in another month) I was forced to make interest to obtain a\nlonger permission, in order to throw myself, lovely Miss Mowbray, at\nyour feet, and to pass the winter in the delights of London, which they\ntell me I shall like better than Paris.'\n\nEmmeline, disgusted at his presumption and volatility, enquired if he\nknew nothing since of Lord and Lady Westhaven.\n\n'Oh, yes,' said he, 'I saw them all at Paris, and asked them if they had\nany commands to you? But I could get nothing from my good cousin but\nsage advice, and from Lady Westhaven only cold looks and half sentences;\nand as to poor Delamere, I knew he was too much afraid of my success to\nbe in a better temper with me than the other two; so we had but little\nconversation.'\n\n'But they are well, Sir?'\n\n'No; Delamere has been detained all this time by illness, at different\nplaces. He was better when I saw him; but Lady Westhaven was herself\nill, and my cousin was, in looks, the most rueful of the three.'\n\n'But, Sir, when may they be expected in England?'\n\n'That I cannot tell. The last time I saw Lord Westhaven was above a week\nbefore I left Paris; and then he said he knew not when his wife would be\nwell enough to begin their journey, but he hoped within a fortnight.'\n\n'Good God!' thought Emmeline, 'what can have prevented his writing to me\nall this time?'\n\nGodolphin, after the first compliments passed with the Chevalier, had\nbeen quite silent. He now, however, asked some questions about his\nbrother; by which he found, that in consequence of endeavouring to\ndiscourage Bellozane's voyage to England, Lord Westhaven had offended\nhim, and that a coldness had taken place between them. Bellozane had\nceased to consider Godolphin as a rival, when he beheld Lord Delamere in\nthat light; and was now rather pleased to meet him, knowing that his\nintroduction into good company would greatly be promoted by means of\nsuch a relation.\n\n'Do you know,' said the Chevalier, addressing himself to Emmeline, 'that\nI have had some trouble, my fair friend, to find you?'\n\n'And how,' enquired Godolphin, 'did you accomplish it?'\n\n'Why my Lord Westhaven, to whom I applied at Paris, protested that he\ndid not know; so remembering the name of le Marquis de Montreville, I\nwrote to him to know where I might wait on Mademoiselle Mowbray.\nMonseigneur le Marquis being at his country house, did not immediately\nanswer my letter. At length I had a card from him, which he had the\ncomplaisance to send by a gentleman, un Monsieur--Monsieur _Croff_, who\ninvited me to his house, and introduced me to Milady _Croff_, his wife,\nwho is daughter to Milor Montreville. _Mon Dieu! que cette femme la, est\nvive, aimable; qu'elle a l'air du monde, et de la bonne compagnie._'[40]\n\n'You think Lady Frances Crofts, then, handsomer than her sister?' asked\nGodolphin.\n\n'_Mais non--elle n'est pas peut-etre si belle--mais elle a cependant un\ncertain air. Enfin--je la trouve charmante._'[41]\n\nGodolphin then continuing to question him, found that the Crofts' had\ninvited Bellozane with an intention of getting from him the purpose of\nhis journey, and what his business was with Emmeline; and finding that\nit was his gallantry only brought him over, and that he knew nothing of\nthe late Mr. Mowbray's affairs, had no longer made any attempt to oppose\nhis seeing her.\n\nGodolphin, tho' he believed Emmeline not only indifferent but averse to\nhim, was yet much disquieted at finding she was likely again to be\nexposed to his importunities. He trembled least if he discovered her\nintentions of going to East Cliff, he should follow her thither; for\nwhich his relationship to Lady Adelina would furnish him with a\npretence; and desirous of getting him away as soon as possible, he asked\nif he would dine with him at his lodgings.\n\nBellozane answered that he was already engaged to Mr. Crofts'; and then\nturning to Emmeline, offered to take her hand; and enquired whether she\nhad a softer heart than when she left Besan\u00c3\u00a7on?\n\nEmmeline drew away her hand; and very gravely entreated him to say no\nmore on a subject already so frequently discussed, and on which her\nsentiments must ever be the same. Bellozane gaily protested that he had\nbeen too long a soldier to be easily repulsed. That he would wait on her\nthe next day, and doubted not but he should find her more favourably\ndisposed. '_Je reviendrai demain vous offrir encore mon hommage. Adieu!\nnymphe belle et cruelle. La chaine que je porte fera toute ma\ngloire._'[42] He then snatched her hand, which in spite of her efforts he\nkissed, and with his usual gaiety went away, accompanied by Godolphin.\n\nHardly had Emmeline time to recollect her dissipated spirits after the\nwarm and serious address of Godolphin, and to feel vexation and disgust\nat the presumptuous forwardness of Bellozane, from which she apprehended\nmuch future trouble, before a note was brought from Mrs. Stafford, to\ninform her, that after waiting some hours at the house of the attorney\nshe employed, the people who were to meet her had disappointed her, and\nthat there was no prospect of her getting her business done till a late\nhour in the evening; she therefore desired Emmeline to dine without her,\nand not to expect her till ten or eleven at night.\n\nAs it was now between four and five, she ordered up her dinner, and was\nsitting down to it alone, when Godolphin again entered the room.\nVexation was marked in his countenance: he seemed hurried; and having\napologized for again interrupting her, tho' he did not account for his\nreturn, he sat down.\n\n'Surely,' cried Emmeline, alarmed, 'you have heard nothing unpleasant\nfrom France?'\n\n'Nothing, upon my honour,' answered he. 'The account the Chevalier gives\nis indeed far from satisfactory, yet I am persuaded there is nothing\nparticularly amiss, or we should have heard.'\n\n'It is that consideration only which has made me tolerably easy. Yet it\nis strange I have no letter from Lady Westhaven. Will you dine with me?'\nadded Emmeline. It was indeed hardly possible to avoid asking him, as Le\nLimosin at that moment brought up the dinner.\n\n'Where is Mrs. Stafford?' said he.\n\n'Detained in the city.'\n\n'And you dine alone, and will allow me the happiness of dining with\nyou?'\n\n'Certainly,' replied Emmeline, blushing, 'if you will favour me with\nyour company.'\n\nGodolphin then placed himself at the end of the table; and in the\npleasure of being with her, thus unmarked by others, and considering her\ninvitation as an assurance that his declaration of the morning was\nfavourably received, he forgot the chagrin which hung upon him at his\nfirst entrance, and thought only of the means by which he might\nperpetuate the happiness he now possessed.\n\nEmmeline tried to shake off, in common conversation, her extreme\nembarrassment. But when dinner was over, and Le Limosin left the room,\nin whose presence she felt a sort of protection, she foresaw that she\nmust again hear Godolphin, and that it would be almost impossible to\nevade answering him.\n\nShe now repented of having asked him to dine with her; then blamed\nherself for the reserve and coldness with which she had almost always\ntreated a man, who, deserving all her affections, had so long possessed\nthem.\n\nBut the idea of poor Delamere--of his sadness, his despair, arose before\nher, and was succeeded by yet more frightful images of the consequences\nthat might follow his frantic passions. And impressed at once with pity\nand terror, she again resolved to keep, if it were possible, the true\nstate of her heart from the knowledge of Godolphin.\n\n'I have seldom seen one of my relations with so little pleasure,' said\nhe, after the servant had withdrawn, 'as I to day met my volatile cousin\nde Bellozane. I hoped he would have persecuted you no farther with a\npassion to which I think you are not disposed to listen.'\n\n'I certainly never intend it.'\n\n'Pardon me then, dearest Miss Mowbray, if I solicit leave to renew the\nconversation his abrupt entrance broke off. You had the goodness to say\nyou had some esteem for my character--Ah! tell me, if on that esteem I\nmay presume to build those hopes which alone can give value to the rest\nof my life?'\n\nEmmeline, who saw he expected an answer, attempted to speak; but the\nhalf-formed words died away on her lips. It was not thus she was used to\nreceive the addresses of Delamere: her heart then left her reason and\nher resolution at liberty, but now the violence of it's sensations\ndeprived her of all power of uttering sentiments foreign to it, or\nconcealing those it really felt.\n\nGodolphin drew from this charming confusion a favourable omen.--'You\nhear me not with anger, lovely Emmeline!' cried he--'You allow me, then,\nto hope?'\n\n'I can only repeat, Sir,' said Emmeline, in a voice hardly audible,\n'that until I am of age, I have resolved to hear nothing on this\nsubject.'\n\n'And why not? Are you not now nearly as independant as you will be\nthen?'\n\n'Alas!' said Emmeline, 'I am indeed!--for my uncle concerns not himself\nabout me, and it is doubtful whether he will do me even the justice to\nacknowledge me.'\n\n'He must, he shall!' replied Godolphin warmly--'Ah! entrust me with your\ninterest; let me, in the character of the fortunate man whom you allow\nto hope for your favour--let me apply to him for justice.'\n\n'That any one should make such an application, except Lord Westhaven, is\nwhat I greatly wish to avoid. I shall most reluctantly appeal to the\ninterference of friends; and still more to that of _law_. The last is,\nyou know, very uncertain. And instead of the heiress to the estate of my\nfather, as I have lately been taught to believe myself, I may be found\nstill to be the poor destitute orphan, so long dependant on the bounty\nof my uncle.'\n\n'And as such,' cried Godolphin, greatly animated, 'you will be dearer to\nme than my existence! Yes! Emmeline; whether you are mistress of\nthousands, or friendless, portionless and deserted, your power over this\nheart is equally absolute--equally fixed! Ah! suffer not any\nconsideration that relates to the uncertainty of your situation, to\ndelay a moment the permission you must, you will give me, to avow my\nlong and ardent passion.'\n\n'It must not be, Mr. Godolphin!' (and tears filled her eyes as she\nspoke) 'Indeed it must not be! It is not now _possible_, at least it is\nvery _improper_, for me to listen to you. Ah! do not then press it. I\nhave indeed already suffered you to say too much on such a topic.'\n\nGodolphin then renewed his warm entreaties that he might be permitted\nopenly to profess himself her lover: but she still evaded giving way to\nthem, by declaring that 'till she was of age she would not marry. 'Had I\nno other objections,' continued she, 'the singularity of my\ncircumstances is alone sufficient to determine me. I cannot think of\naccepting the honour you offer me, while my very _name_ is in some\ndegree doubtful; it would, I own, mortify me to take any advantage of\nyour generosity; and should I fail of obtaining from Lord Montreville\nthat to which I am now believed to have a claim, his Lordship, irritated\nat the attempt, will probably withdraw what he has hitherto allowed\nme--scanty support, and occasional protection.'\n\n'Find protection with your lover, with your husband!' exclaimed he--'And\nmay that happy husband, that adoring lover, be Godolphin! May Adelina\nforget her own calamities in contemplating the felicity of her brother;\nand may her beauteous, her benevolent friend, become her sister indeed,\nas she has long been the sister of her heart.'\n\n'You will oblige me, Sir,' said Emmeline, feeling that notwithstanding\nall her attempts to conceal it the truth trembled in her eyes and\nfaultered in her accents--'you will oblige me if you say no more of\nthis.'\n\n'I will obey you, if you will only tell me I may hope.'\n\n'How can I say so, Sir, when so long a time must intervene before I\nshall think of fixing myself for life.'\n\n'Yet surely you know, the generous, the candid Miss Mowbray knows,\nwhether her devoted Godolphin is agreeable to her, or whether, if every\nobstacle which exists in her timid imagination were removed, he would be\njudged wholly unworthy of pretending to the honour of her hand?'\n\n'Certainly not unworthy,' tremblingly said Emmeline.\n\n'Let me then, thus encouraged, go farther--and ask if I have a place in\nyour esteem?'\n\n'Do not ask me--indeed I cannot tell--Nay I beg, I entreat,' added she,\ntrying to disengage her hands from him, 'that you will desist--do not\nforce me to leave you.'\n\n'Ah! talk not, think not of leaving me; think rather of confirming those\nfortunate presages I draw from this lovely timidity. I cannot go till I\nknow your thoughts of me--till I know what place I hold in that soft\nbosom.'\n\n'I think of you as an excellent brother; as a generous and disinterested\nfriend; for such I have found you; as a man of great good sense, of\nnoble principles, of exalted honour!'\n\n'As one then,' said Godolphin, vehemently interrupting her, 'not\nunworthy of being entrusted with your happiness; who may hope to be\nhonoured with a deposit so inestimable, as the confidence and tenderness\nof that gentle and generous heart?'\n\n'I do indeed think very highly of you.--I cannot, if I would, deny it.'\n\n'And you allow me, then, to go instantly to Lord Montreville?'\n\n'Oh! no! no!--surely nothing I have said implied such a consent.'\n\nGodolphin, however, was still pressing; and at length brought her to\nconfess, with blushes, and even with tears, her early and long\npartiality for him, and her resolution either to be his, or die\nunmarried. She found, indeed, all attempts to dissimulate, vain: the\nreserve she had forced herself to assume, gave way to her natural\nfrankness; and having once been induced to make such an acknowledgment\nof the state of her heart, she determined to have no longer any secrets\nconcealed from him who was it's master.\n\nShe therefore candidly told him how great was her compassion for Lord\nDelamere, and how severe her apprehensions of his rage, resentment and\ndespair.\n\nHe allowed the force of the first; but as to the other, he would not\nsuppose it a reason for her delaying her marriage.\n\n'Poor Delamere,' said he, 'is of a temper which opposition and\ndifficulty renders more eager and more obstinate. Yet when you are for\never out of his reach; as the obstacle will become invincible, he must\nyield to necessity. While you remain single, he will still hope. The\ngreatest kindness, therefore, that you can do him, will be to convince\nhim that he has nothing to expect from you; and put an end at once to\nthe uncertainty which tortures him.'\n\n'To drive him to despair? Ah! I know so well the dreadful force of his\npassions, and the excesses he is capable of committing when under their\ninfluence, that I dare not, I positively will not, risk it. I love\nDelamere as my brother; I love him for the resemblance he is said to\nbear to my father. I pity him for the errors which the natural\nimpetuosity of his temper, inflamed by the unbounded indulgence of his\nmother, continually leads him into; and the misfortunes these causes are\nso frequently inflicting on him; and should his fatal inclination for\nme, be the means of bringing on himself and on his family yet other\nmiseries, I should never forgive myself; or him by whose means they were\nincurred.'\n\n'From me, at least, you have nothing of that sort to apprehend: I truly\npity Delamere; I feel what it must be to have relinquished the woman he\nloves; and to find her lost to his hopes, while his passion is\nunabated:--be assured my compassion for him will induce me rather to\nsoothe his unhappiness than to insult him with an ostentatious display\nof my enviable fortune. Yet if you suffer me to believe my attachment\nnot disagreeable to you, how shall I wholly conceal it? how appear as\nnot _daring_ to avow that, which is the glory and happiness of my life?\nand by your being supposed disengaged and indifferent, see you exposed\nto the importunities of an infinite number of suitors, who, however\ninconsequential they may be to _you_, will torment _me_. I do not know\nthat I have much of jealousy in my nature; yet I cannot tell how I shall\nbear to see Delamere presuming again on your former friendship for\nhim.--Even the volatile and thoughtless Bellozane has the power to make\nme uneasy, when I see him so persuaded of his own merit, and so\nconfident of success.'\n\n'While you assert that you are but little disposed to jealousy, you are\npersuading me that you are extremely prone to it. You know Bellozane can\nnever have the smallest interest in my heart. But as to Delamere, I am\ndecided against inflaming his irritable passions, by encouraging an\navowed rival, tho' I will do all I can by other means, to discourage\nhim. The only condition on which I will continue to see you is, that you\nappear no otherwise interested about me, than as the favoured friend of\nyour sister, your brother, and Lady Westhaven. Press me, therefore, no\nfarther on the subject, and let us now part.'\n\n'Tell me, first, whether your journey remains fixed for\nThursday?--whether you still hold your generous resolution of going to\nAdelina?'\n\n'I do. But I must insist on going alone.'\n\n'And if Bellozane should enquire whither you are going? You see nothing\nprevents his following you; and to follow you to East Cliff, he will,\nyou know, have sufficient excuse. Emmeline, I cannot bear it!--there is\na presumption in his manner, which offends and shocks me; and which,\nhowever you may dislike it, it may not always be in your power to\nrepress!'\n\n'Surely he need not know that I am going thither.'\n\nIt was now, therefore, agreed between them that if Bellozane called upon\nher the next day, as he said he intended, she should be denied to him;\nand that early on the following morning, which was Thursday, she should\nset out for East Cliff, attended by Madelon and Le Limosin.\n\nThis arrangement was hardly made when Mrs. Stafford returned, weary and\nexhausted from the unpleasant party with which she had passed the day.\n\nWith Emmeline's permission (who left the room that she might not hear\nit) Godolphin related to Mrs. Stafford the conversation they had held.\nIt was the only information which had any power to raise her depressed\nspirits; and as soon as Emmeline rejoined them, she added her entreaties\nto those of Godolphin. They urged her to conquer immediately all those\nscruples which divided her from him to whom she had given her heart; and\nto put herself into such protection as must at once obviate all the\ndifficulties she apprehended. But Emmeline still adhered to her\nresolution of remaining single, if not 'till she was of age, at least\ntill her affairs with her uncle were adjusted, and 'till she saw the\nunhappy Delamere restored to health and tranquillity. But\nnotwithstanding this delay, Godolphin, assured of possessing her\naffection, left her with an heart which was even oppressed with the\nexcess of it's own happiness.\n\n[Footnote 39: The Chevalier is below.]\n\n[Footnote 40: How lively and agreeable she is--how much she has the air\nof a woman of fashion and of the world.]\n\n[Footnote 41: Not so handsome, perhaps--but there is a something--in\nshort, I think her charming.]\n\n[Footnote 42: I shall come again to-morrow to offer my homage. Adieu!\nfair, cruel nymph! I place my glory in wearing your chains.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nEmmeline seemed to be happier since she had confessed to Godolphin his\ninfluence over her mind, and since she had made him in some measure the\ndirector of her actions. She hoped that she might conceal her partiality\n'till she had nothing to fear from Delamere; at present she was sure he\nhad no suspicion that Godolphin was his rival; and she flattered\nherself, that on his return to England, the conviction of her coldness\nwould by degrees wean him from his attachment, and that he would learn\nto consider her only as his sister.\n\nThese pleasing hopes, however, were insufficient to balance the concern\nshe felt for Mrs. Stafford; who having long struggled against her\ncalamities, now seemed on the point of sinking under their pressure, and\nof determining to attend, in despondent resignation, the end of her\nunmerited sufferings.\n\nEmmeline attempted to re-animate her, by repeating all the promises of\nLord Westhaven, on whose word she had the most perfect reliance. She\nassured her, that the moment her own affairs were settled, her first\ncare should be the re-establishment of those of her beloved friend. For\nsome time the oppressed spirits of Mrs. Stafford would only allow her to\nanswer with her tears these generous assurances. At length she said--\n\n'It is to you, my Emmeline, I could perhaps learn to be indebted\nwithout being humbled; for you have an heart which receives while it\nconfers an obligation. But think what it is for one, born with a right\nto affluence and educated in its expectation, with feelings keen from\nnature, and made yet keener by refinement, to be compelled, as I have\nbeen, to solicit favours, pecuniary favours, from persons who have no\nfeeling at all--from the shifting, paltry-spirited James Crofts,\nforbearance from the claim of debts; from the callous-hearted and\nselfish politician, his father, pity and assistance; from Rochely, who\nhas no ideas but of getting or saving money, to ask the loan of it! and\nto bear with humility a rude refusal. I have endured the brutal\nunkindness of hardened avarice, the dirty chicane of law, exercised by\nthe most contemptible of beings; I have been forced to attempt softening\nthe tradesman and the mechanic, and to suffer every degree of\nhumiliation which the insolence of sudden prosperity or the insensible\ncoolness of the determined money dealer, could inflict. Actual poverty,\nI think, I could have better borne;\n\n\n    'I should have found, in some place of my soul,\n    A drop of patience!'\n\n\nBut ineffectual attempts to ward it off by such degradation I can no\nlonger submit to. While Mr. Stafford, for whom I have encountered it\nall, is not only unaffected by the poignant mortifications which torture\nme; but receives my efforts to serve him, if successful, only as a\nduty--if unsuccessful, he considers my failure as a fault; and loads me\nwith reproach, with invective, with contempt!--others have, in their\nhusbands, protectors and friends; mine, not only throws on me the\nburthen of affairs which he has himself embroiled, but adds to their\nweight by cruelty and oppression. Such complicated and incurable misery\nmust overwhelm me, and then--what will become of my children?'\n\nPenetrated with pity and sorrow, Emmeline listened, in tears, to this\nstrong but too faithful picture of the situation of her unfortunate\nfriend; and with difficulty said, in a voice of the tenderest pity--\n\n'Yet a little patience and surely things will mend. It cannot be very\nlong, before I shall either be in high affluence or reduced to my former\ndependance; perhaps to actual indigence. Of these events, I hope the\nformer is the most probable: but be it as it may, you and your children\nwill be equally dear to me.--If I am rich, my house, my fortune shall\nbe your's--if I am poor, I will live with you, and we will work\ntogether. But for such resources as the pencil or the needle may afford\nus, we shall, I think, have no occasion. You, my dear friend, will\ncontinue to exert yourself for your children; Lord Westhaven is greatly\ninterested for you; and all will yet be well.'\n\n'I am afraid not,' replied Mrs. Stafford. 'Among the various misfortunes\nof life, there are some that admit of no cure; some, which even the\ntender and generous friendship of my Emmeline can but palliate. Of that\nnature, I fear, are many of mine. My past life has been almost all\nbitterness; God only knows what the remainder of it may be, but\n\n\n    'Shadows, clouds, and darkness, rest upon it.'\n\n\n'Ah! give not up your mind to these gloomy thoughts,' said Emmeline.\n'Setting aside all hopes I have of being able, without the assistance of\nany one, to clear those prospects, I have a firm dependance on Lord\nWesthaven, and am sure I shall yet see you happy.'\n\n'Never, I believe, in this world!' dejectedly answered Mrs. Stafford.\n'But why should I distress you, my best Emmeline, with a repetition of\nmy hopeless sorrows; why cannot I now refrain, as I have hitherto done,\nfrom taxing with my complaints your lively sensibility?' She then began\nto talk of their journey for the next day, for which every thing was now\nready. It would have been very agreeable to Emmeline could Mrs. Stafford\nhave gone by Southampton, and have accompanied her for a few days to\nEast Cliff; but she said, that besides her suffering so much at sea,\nwhich made the long passage to France very dreadful to her, she had\nalready, in a letter to her husband, fixed to go by Calais; and as he\nmight either send or come to meet her on that road, he might be offended\nif she took the other: besides these reasons, she had yet another in the\nchance the Calais road afforded of meeting Lord and Lady Westhaven. The\ntwo last arguments were unanswerable: Emmeline relinquished the project\nof their going together; and they passed the rest of the day in the last\npreparations for their separate journeys. In the course of it, Bellozane\ncalled twice, but was not admitted. Godolphin was allowed to sup with\nthem; and early the next morning came again to see them set out. They\nparted on all sides with tears and reluctance--Emmeline, with Madelon\nin the chaise with her, and Le Limosin on horseback, took the road to\nSouthampton, and Mrs. Stafford pursued her melancholy journey to Dover.\n\nEmmeline arrived at Southampton late the same evening, where she slept;\nand the next morning landed on the Isle of Wight.\n\nIt was a clear and mild day, towards the end of October; and she walked,\nattended by her servants, to East Cliff. As she approached the door of\nGodolphin's house, her heart beat quick; a thousand tender recollections\narose that related to it's beloved master, and some mournful\napprehensions for the fate of it's present lovely and unhappy\ninhabitant.\n\nThe maid who had so long waited on Lady Adelina opened the door, and\nexpressed the utmost delight at seeing Emmeline. 'Ah! dearest Madam!'\nsaid she, 'how good it is in you to come to my lady! Now, I hope, both\nher health and her spirits will be better. But the joy of knowing you\nare here, will overcome her, unless I inform her of it with caution; for\ntho' she rather expected you, I know it will be extreme.'\n\nBarret then ran to execute this welcome commission, and in a few moments\nLady Adelina, supported by her, walked into the room, holding in her\nhand little William, and fell, almost insensible, into the arms of her\nfriend.\n\nThe expression of her countenance, faded as it was, where a gleam of\nexquisite pleasure seemed to lighten up the soft features which had long\nsunk under the blighting hand of sorrow; her weeds, forming so striking\na contrast to the fairness of her transparent skin; and the lovely\nchild, now about fourteen months old, which hung on her arm; made her\naltogether appear to Emmeline the most interesting, the most affecting\nfigure, she had ever seen. Neither of them could speak. Lady Adelina\nmurmured something, as she fondly pressed Emmeline to her heart; but it\nwas not till it's oppression was relieved by tears, that she could\ndistinctly thank her for coming. Emmeline, with equal marks of\ntenderness, embraced the mother and caressed the son, whose infantine\nbeauty would have charmed her had he been the child of a stranger. After\na little, they grew more composed; and Emmeline, while Lady Adelina in\nthe most melting accents spoke of her brother William, and enquired\ntenderly after her elder brother and his wife, had time to contemplate\nher lovely but palid face; from which the faint glow of transient\npleasure, the animated vivacity of momentary rapture, was gone; and a\nlanguor so great seemed to hang over her, such pensive and settled\nmelancholy had taken possession of her features, that Emmeline could\nhardly divest herself of the idea of immediate danger; and fancied that\nshe was come thither only to see the beauteous mourner sink into the\ngrave. She trembled to think on the consequence which, in such a state\nof health, might arise from the conflict she would probably have to\nundergo in regard to Fitz-Edward. Emmeline herself dared not name him to\nGodolphin in their long conference. It was a subject, on which (however\nslightly touched) he had always expressed such painful sensibility, that\nshe could not resolve to enter upon it with him. Yet she foresaw, that\non Lord Westhaven's arrival either a general explanation must take\nplace, or that his Lordship would accept, for his sister, the offer of\nFitz-Edward, to which there would be in his eyes, (while he yet remained\nignorant of their former unfortunate acquaintance,) no possible\nobjection. She supposed that Lord and Lady Clancarryl, equally ignorant\nof that error (which had been partly owing to their own confidence in\nFitz-Edward) would press Lady Adelina to accept him; and that Godolphin\nmust either consent to forgive, and receive him as his brother, or give\nsuch reasons for opposing his alliance with Lady Adelina, as would\nprobably destroy the peace of his family and the fragile existence of\nhis sister. Sometimes, she thought that his inflexible honour would\nyield, and induce him to bury the past in oblivion. But then she\nrecollected all the indignation he had but lately expressed against\nFitz-Edward, and doubted, with fearful apprehension, the event.\n\nThe first day passed without that mutual and unreserved confidence being\nabsolutely established, which the lovely friends longed to repose in\neach other. Lady Adelina languished to enquire after, to talk of\nFitz-Edward, yet dared not trust herself with his name; and Emmeline,\ntho' well assured that the knowledge of those terms which she was now on\nwith Godolphin would give infinite pleasure to his sister, yet had not\ncourage to reveal that truth which her conscious heart secretly enjoyed.\nAffected with her friend's depression, and unwilling to keep her up\nlate, she complained of fatigue soon in the evening, and retired to her\nown room. She there dismissed Madelon, and bade her, as soon as Mrs.\nBarret came from her lady's apartment, let her know that she desired to\nspeak to her.\n\nShe wished to enquire of this faithful servant her opinion of her lady's\nhealth. And as soon as she came to her, expressed her fears about it in\nterms equally anxious and tender.\n\n'Ah! Madam,' said Barret, 'all you observe as to my lady is but too\njust; and what I go thro' about her, (especially when the Captain is not\nhere) I am sure no tongue can tell. Sometimes, Ma'am, when I have left\nher of a night, and she tells me she is going to bed, I hear her walk\nabout the room talking; then she goes to the bed (for I have looked\nthro' the key hole) where Master Godolphin sleeps, and looks at him, and\nbursts into tears and laments herself over him, and again begins to walk\nabout the room, and speaks as it were to herself; and at other times,\nshe will open the window, and leaning her head on her two hands, sit and\nlook at the clouds and the stars; and sighs so deeply, and so often,\nthat it makes my heart quite ache to hear her. The child was very ill\nonce with a tooth fever, while the Captain was gone to France; and then\nindeed I thought my poor lady would have been quite, quite gone in her\nhead again; for she talked _so_ wildly of what she would do if he died,\nand said such things, as almost frightened me to death. We sent to\nWinchester for a physician; and before he could come, for you know,\nMa'am, what a long way 'tis to send, she grew so impatient, and had\nterrified herself into such agonies, that when the doctor did come, he\nsaid she was in a great deal the most danger of the two. Thank God,\nMaster Godolphin soon got well; but it was a long time before my lady\nwas quite herself again; and since that, Ma'am, she will hardly suffer\nMaster out of her sight at all; but makes either his own maid or me sit\nin the room to attend upon him while she reads or writes. When she walks\nout, she generally orders one of us to take him with her; and only goes\nout alone after he is in bed of a night. Then, indeed, she stays out\nlong enough; and tho' you see, Ma'am, how sadly she looks, she never\nseems to care at all about her own health, but does things that really\nwould kill a strong person.'\n\n'What then does she do?' enquired Emmeline.\n\n'Why, Ma'am, quite late sometimes of a night, when every body else is\nasleep, she will go away by herself perhaps to that wood you see there,\nor down to the sea shore; and she orders me to let nobody follow her.\nQuite of cold nights this Autumn, when the wind blew, and the sea made a\nnoise so loud and dismal, she has staid there whole hours by herself;\nonly I ventured to disobey her so far as to see that no harm came to\nher. But three or four times, Ma'am, she remained so long that I\nconcluded she must catch her death. At last, I bethought me of getting\none of the maids to go and tell her Master was awake; and I have got her\nto come in by that means out of the wind and the cold. Then, Ma'am, she\nseems to take pleasure in nothing but sorrow and melancholy. The books\nshe reads are so sad, that sometimes, when her own eyes are tired and\nshe makes me read them to her, I get quite horrible thoughts in my head.\nBut my lady, instead of trying, as I do, to shake them off, will go\ndirectly to her music, and play such mournful tunes, that it really\nquite overcomes me, as I am at work in another room. At other times she\ngoes and writes verses about her own unhappiness. How is it possible,\nMa'am, that with such ways of passing her time, my lady, always so\ndelicate as she was in health, should be well: for my part I only wonder\nshe is not quite dead.'\n\n'But how do you know, Barret, that your lady employs herself in writing\nverses about her own unhappiness?'\n\n'Dear, Ma'am, I have found them about every where. When the Captain is\nabsent, my lady is indifferent where she leaves them. Sometimes four or\nfive sheets lay open on the table in her little dressing room, and\nsometimes upon her music.'\n\nEmmeline was too certain that such were the occupations of her poor\nfriend. During the short time they had been together, Lady Adelina had\nshewn her some work; and as she took it out of her drawer, she drew out\nsome papers with it.\n\n'I do but little work,' said she. 'I find even embroidery does not serve\nto call off my thoughts sufficiently from myself. I read a good deal in\nbooks of mere amusement, for of serious application I am incapable; and\nhere is another specimen of my method of employing myself, which perhaps\nyou will not think a remedy for melancholy thoughts.'\n\nShe put a written paper into Emmeline's hand, who was about to open it;\nbut Lady Adelina added, with a pensive smile, 'do not read it now;\nrather keep it till you are alone.'\n\nThis paper Emmeline took out to peruse as soon as she had dismissed\nBarret. Her heart bled as she ran over this testimony of the anguish and\ndespondence which preyed on the heart of Lady Adelina. It was an\n\n\n               ODE TO DESPAIR\n\n    Thou spectre of terrific mien,\n    Lord of the hopeless heart and hollow eye,\n    In whose fierce train each form is seen\n    That drives sick Reason to insanity!\n    I woo thee with unusual prayer,\n    'Grim visaged, comfortless Despair!'\n    Approach; in me a willing victim find,\n    Who seeks thine iron sway--and calls thee kind!\n\n    Ah! hide for ever from my sight\n    The faithless flatterer Hope--whose pencil, gay,\n    Portrays some vision of delight,\n    Then bids the fairy tablet fade away;\n    While in dire contrast, to mine eyes\n    Thy phantoms, yet more hideous, rise,\n    And Memory draws, from Pleasure's wither'd flower,\n    Corrosives for the heart--of fatal power!\n\n    I bid the traitor Love, adieu!\n    Who to this fond, believing bosom came,\n    A guest insidious and untrue,\n    With Pity's soothing voice--in Friendship's name;\n    The wounds _he_ gave, nor Time shall cure,\n    Nor Reason teach me to endure.\n    And to that breast mild Patience pleads in vain,\n    Which feels the curse--of meriting it's pain.\n\n    Yet not to me, tremendous power!\n    Thy worst of spirit-wounding pangs impart,\n    With which, in dark conviction's hour,\n    Thou strik'st the guilty unrepentant heart!\n    But of Illusion long the sport,\n    That dreary, tranquil gloom I court\n    Where my past errors I may still deplore\n    And dream of long-lost happiness no more!\n\n    To thee I give this tortured breast,\n    Where Hope arises but to foster pain;\n    Ah! lull it's agonies to rest!\n    Ah! let me never be deceiv'd again!\n    But callous, in thy deep repose\n    Behold, in long array, the woes\n    Of the dread future, calm and undismay'd,\n    Till I may claim the hope--that shall not fade!\n\n\nThe feelings of a mind which could dictate such an address, appeared to\nEmmeline so greatly to be lamented, and so unlikely to be relieved, that\nthe tender and painful compassion she had ever been sensible of for her\nunhappy friend, was if possible augmented. Full of ideas almost as\nmournful as those by which they had been inspired, she went to bed, but\nnot to tranquil sleep. Her spirits, worn by her journey, and oppressed\nby her concern for Lady Adelina, were yet busy; and instead of the\nuneasy images which had pursued her while she waked, they represented to\nher others yet more terrifying. She beheld, in her dreams, Godolphin\nwildly seeking vengeance of Fitz-Edward for the death of his sister.\nThen, instead of Fitz-Edward, Lord Delamere appeared to be the object of\nhis wrath, and mutual fury seemed to animate them against the lives of\neach other. To them, her uncle, in all the phrenzy of grief and despair,\nsucceeded; overwhelmed her with reproaches for the loss of his only son,\nand tore her violently away from Godolphin, who in vain pursued her.\n\nThese horrid visions returned so often, drest in new forms of terror,\nthat Emmeline, having long resisted the impression they made upon her,\ncould at length bear them no longer; but shaking off all disposition to\nindulge sleep on such terms, she arose from her bed, and wrapping\nherself up in her night gown, went to the window. The dawn did not yet\nappear; but she sat down by the window, of which she had opened the\nshutter to watch it's welcome approach.\n\nThe morning, for it was between three and four, was mild; the declining\nstars were obscured by no cloud, and served to shew dimly the objects in\nthe garden beneath her. She softly opened the sash; listened to the low,\nhollow murmur of the sea; and surveyed the lawn and the hill behind it,\nwhich, by the faint and uncertain light, she could just discern. All\nbreathed a certain solemn and melancholy stillness calculated to inspire\nhorror. Emmeline's blood ran cold; yet innocence like her's really fears\nnothing if free from the prejudices of superstition. She endeavoured to\nconquer the disagreeable sensations she felt, and to shake off the\neffects of her dreams; but the silence, and the gloominess of the scene,\nassisted but little her efforts, and she cast an eye of solicitude\ntowards the Eastern horizon, and wished for the return of the sun.\n\nIn this disposition of mind, she was at once amazed and alarmed, by\nseeing the figure of a man, tall and thin, wrapped in a long horseman's\ncoat, as if on purpose to disguise him, force himself out from between\nthe shrubs which bounded one part of the lawn. He looked not towards the\nwindows; but with folded arms, and his hat over his eyes, was poring on\nthe ground, while with slow steps he crossed the lawn and came\nimmediately under the windows of the house.\n\nWhen she first perceived him, she had started back from that where she\nsat; but tho' greatly surprized, she could not forbear watching him: on\nlonger observing his figure, she fancied it was that of a gentleman; and\nby his slow walk and manner he did not appear to have any design to\nattack the house. Her presence of mind never forsook her unless where\nher heart was greatly affected; and she had now courage enough to\ndetermine that she would still continue for some moments to observe him,\nand would not alarm the servants till she saw reason to believe he had\nill intentions. She sat therefore quite still; and saw, that instead of\nmaking any attempt to enter the house, he traversed the whole side of it\nnext the lawn, with a measured and solemn pace, several times; then\nstopped a moment, again went to the end, and slowly returned; and having\ncontinued to do so near an hour, he crossed the grass, and disappeared\namong the shrubs from whence he had issued.\n\nHad not Emmeline been very sure that she not only heard his footsteps\ndistinctly as he passed over a gravel walk in his way, but even heard\nhim breathe hard and short, as if agitated or fatigued, she would almost\nhave persuaded herself that it was a phantom raised by her disordered\nspirits. The longer she reflected on it, the more incomprehensible it\nseemed, that a man should, at such an hour, make such an excursion,\napparently to so little purpose. That it was with a dishonest design\nthere seemed no likelihood, as he made no effort to force his way into\nthe house, which he might easily have done; and had he come on a\nclandestine visit to any of the servants, he would probably have had\nsome signal by which his confederates would have been informed of his\napproach. But he seemed rather fearful of disturbing the sleeping\ninhabitants; his step was slow and light; and on perceiving the first\nrays of the morning, he 'started like a guilty thing,' and swiftly\nstepped away to his concealment.\n\nEmmeline continued some time at the window after his disappearance,\nbelieving he might return. But it soon grew quite light: the gardener\nappeared at his work; and she was then convinced that he would for that\ntime come no more.\n\nSo extraordinary a circumstance, however, dwelt on her mind; nor could\nshe entirely divest herself of alarm. A strange and confused idea that\nthis visitor might be some one not unknown to her, crossed her mind. His\nheight answered almost equally to that of Bellozane, Godolphin, and\nFitz-Edward. The latter, indeed, was rather the tallest, and to him she\nthought the figure bore the greatest resemblance. Yet he had taken leave\nof her ten days before she left London, and told her he was going down\nto Mr. Percival's, in Berkshire; where, as he was very anxious to hear\nof Lady Adelina, he had desired Mrs. Stafford to write to him; (who had\ndone so, and had received an answer of thanks dated from thence before\nthe departure of Emmeline from London). That Fitz-Edward, therefore,\nshould be the person, seemed improbable; yet it was hardly less so that\na night ruffian should be on foot so long, without any attempt to\nexecute mischief, or even the appearance of examining how it might be\nperpetrated. After long consideration, she determined, that lest the\nfirst conjecture should be true, she would speak to nobody of the\nstranger she had seen; but would watch another night, before she either\nterrified Lady Adelina with the apprehension of robbers, or gave rise to\nconjectures in her and the servants of yet more disquieting tendency.\nHaving taken this resolution, and argued herself out of all those fears\nfor her personal safety which might have enfeebled a less rational mind,\nshe met Lady Adelina at breakfast with her usual ease, and almost with\nher usual chearfulness: but she was pale, and her eyes were heavy: Lady\nAdelina remarked it with concern; but Emmeline, making light of it,\nimputed it intirely to the fatigue of her journey; and when their\nbreakfast was finished, proposed a walk. To this her friend assented;\nand while she went to give some orders, and to fetch the crape veil in\nwhich she usually wrapped herself, (for even her dress partook something\nof the mournful cast of her mind), Emmeline, already equipped, went into\nthe lawn, and saw plainly where the stranger had made his way thro' the\nthick shrubs, and where the flexible branches of a young larch were\ntwisted away, a laurel broken, and that some deciduous trees behind them\nhad lost all their lower leaves; which, having sustained the first\nfrosts, fell on the slightest violence. She marked the place with her\neye; and determined to observe whether, if he came again, it was from\nthence.\n\nEmmeline now desired that Madelon might come with them to wait on little\nWilliam, rather than his own maid; as she understood English so ill,\nthat she would be no interruption to their discourse. They then walked\narm in arm together towards the sea; and there Lady Adelina, who now\nenjoyed the opportunity she had so long languished for, opened to her\nsympathizing friend the sorrows of an heart struggling vainly with a\npassion she condemned, and sinking under ineffectual efforts to\nvindicate her honour and eradicate her love.\n\nShe knew not that Fitz-Edward had ever written to her. Godolphin, well\nacquainted with his hand, had kept the letter from her. She knew not\nthat he had applied to Emmeline: and tho' she had torn herself from him,\nand had vowed never again to write to him, to name him, to hear from\nhim, she involuntarily felt disposed to accuse him of neglect, of\ningratitude, of cruelty, for having never attempted to write to her or\nsee her; and added the poignant anguish of jealousy to the dreary\nhorrors of despair. That Fitz-Edward was for ever lost to her, she\nseemed to be convinced; yet that he should forget her, or attach himself\nto another, seemed a torment so entirely insupportable, that when her\nmind dwelt upon it, as it perpetually did, her reason was inadequate to\nthe pain it inflicted; and when she touched on that subject, Emmeline\ntoo evidently saw symptoms of that derangement of intellect to which she\nhad once before been a melancholy witness.\n\nWith a mind thus unsettled, and a heart thus oppressed, the consequences\nof touching on the application of Fitz-Edward to herself, might, as\nEmmeline believed, have the most alarming effect on Lady Adelina. And\nshe dared not therefore name it unless she had the concurrence of\nGodolphin. She only attempted to soothe and tranquillize her mind,\nwithout giving her those assurances of his undiminished attachment,\nwhich, she thought, might in the event only encrease her anguish, if her\nbrother remained inflexible. On the other hand, she forbore to\nremonstrate with her on the necessity there might be to forget him;\nbeing too well convinced that the arguments which were to enforce that\ndoctrine, would be useless, and perhaps appear cruel, to a heart so\ndeeply wounded as was that of the luckless, lovely Adelina.\n\nBut in pouring her sorrows into the bosom of her friend she appeared to\nfind consolation. The tender pity of Emmeline was a balm to her wounded\nmind; and growing more composed, she began to discourse on the singular\ndiscovery Emmeline had made, and to enter with some interest into the\naffairs depending between her and the Marquis of Montreville; and by\nquestions, aided by the natural frankness of Emmeline, at length became\nacquainted with the happy prospects, which, tho' distant, opened to\nGodolphin.\n\nThis was the only information that seemed to have the power of\nsuspending for a moment the weight of those afflictions which Lady\nAdelina suffered. 'My brother then,' cried she--'my dear Godolphin, will\nbe happy! And you, my most amiable friend, will constitute, while you\nshare his felicity. Ah! fortunate, thrice fortunate for ye both, was the\nhour of your meeting; for heaven and nature surely designed ye for each\nother! Fortunate, too, were those circumstances which divided my\nEmmeline from Delamere, before indissoluble bonds enchained you for\never. Had it been otherwise; had _your_ guardian angel slumbered as\n_mine did_; you too, all lovely and deserving as you are, would have\nbeen condemned to the bitterest of all lots, and might have discovered\nall the excellence and worth of Godolphin, when your duty and your\nhonour allowed you no eyes but for Delamere. _Your_ destiny is more\nhappy--yet not happier than you deserve. Oh! may it quickly be fixed\nunalterably; and long, very long, may it endure! So shall your Adelina,\nfor the little while she drags on a reluctant existence, have something\non which to lean for the alleviation of her sorrows; and when she shall\ninterrupt your felicity no longer by the sight of cureless calamity, she\nwill, in full confidence, entrust the sole tie she has on earth, the\ndear and innocent victim of her fatal weakness, to the compassionate\nbosoms of Godolphin and his Emmeline!'\n\nThe tremulous voice and singular manner in which Lady Adelina uttered\nthese words, made Emmeline tremble. She now tried to divert the\nattention of her poor friend, from dwelling too earnestly either on her\nown wretchedness or the promised felicity of her brother: but, as if\nexhausted by the mingled emotions of pain and pleasure, she soon\nafterwards fell into a deep silence; scarce attending to what was said;\nand after a long pause, she suddenly called to Madelon, in whose arms\nher little boy had fallen asleep, and looking at him earnestly a moment,\ntook him from the maid, and carried him towards the house. Emmeline,\nmore and more convinced of her partial intellectual derangement,\nfollowed her, dreading lest she should see it encrease, without the\npower of applying any remedy. Before Lady Adelina reached the gate,\nwhich opened from the cliffs to the lawn, she was fatigued by her lovely\nburthen and forced to stop. Emmeline would then have taken him; but she\nsaid 'No!' and sitting down on the ground, held him in her lap, till\nBarret, who had seen her from a window, came out and took him from her;\nto which, as to a thing usual, she consented, and then walked calmly\nhome with Emmeline, who, extremely discomposed by the wildness of her\nmanner, was fearful of again introducing any interesting topic, lest she\nshould again touch those fine chords which were untuned in the mind of\nher unhappy friend; and which seemed occasionally to vibrate with an\nacuteness that threatened the ruin of the whole fabric. Barret, who\nafterwards came to assist her in dressing, told her, that within the\nlast six weeks her lady had often been subject to long fits of absence,\nsometimes of tears; which generally ended in her snatching the child\neagerly to her, kissing him with the wildest fondness, and that after\nhaving kept him with her some time, and wept extremely, she usually\nbecame rational and composed for the rest of the day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nWhen Emmeline met Lady Adelina at dinner, she had the satisfaction to\nfind her quite tranquil and easy. As the afternoon proved uncommonly\nfine, and Emmeline was never weary of contemplating the scenery which\nsurrounded them, she willingly consented to Lady Adelina's proposal of\nanother ramble; that she might see some beautiful cliffs, a little\nfarther from the house than she had yet been. There, she was pleased to\nfind, that her fair friend seemed to call off her mind from it's usual\npainful occupations to admire the charms, which on one side a very\nlovely country, and on the other an extensive sea view, offered to their\nsight.\n\n'You cannot imagine, my Emmeline,' said she, 'how exquisitely beautiful\nthe prospect is from the point of these rocks where we stand, in the\nmidst of summer; now the sun, more distant, gives it a less glowing and\nrich lustre, and reflects not his warm rays on the sea, and on the white\ncliffs that hang over it. Here it was, that indulging that melancholy\nfor which I have too much reason, I made, while my brother was absent\nlast summer, some lines, which, if it was pleasant to repeat one's own\npoetry, I would read to you, as descriptive at once of the scene, and\nthe state of mind in which I surveyed it.'\n\nEmmeline now earnestly pressing her to gratify the curiosity she had\nthus raised, at length prevailed upon her to repeat the following\n\n\n                      SONNET\n\n    Far on the sands, the low, retiring tide,\n    In distant murmurs hardly seems to flow,\n    And o'er the world of waters, blue and wide\n    The sighing summer wind, forgets to blow.\n\n    As sinks the day star in the rosy West,\n    The silent wave, with rich reflection glows;\n    Alas! can tranquil nature give _me_ rest,\n    Or scenes of beauty, soothe me to repose?\n\n    Can the soft lustre of the sleeping main,\n    Yon radient heaven; or all creation's charms,\n    'Erase the written troubles of the brain,'\n    Which Memory tortures, and which Guilt alarms?\n    Or bid a bosom transient quiet prove,\n    That bleeds with vain remorse, and unextinguish'd love!\n\n\nThe 'season and the scene' were brought by this description full on the\nmind of Emmeline; yet she almost immediately repented having pressed\nAdelina to repeat to her what seemed to have led her again into her\nusual tract of sad reflection. She fell, as usual, into one of her\nreveries, and as they walked homewards said very little. The rest of the\nevening, however, passed in a sort of mournful tranquillity--Adelina\nseemed to feel encreasing pleasure as she gazed on her friend; and\nremembering all her goodness, reflected on the happiness of her brother.\nBut this satisfaction was not of that kind which seeks to express itself\nin words; and Emmeline, sensible of great anxiety for her and Godolphin,\n(who would, she knew, be cruelly hurt by the relapse which he feared\nthreatened his sister) and busied in no pleasant conjectures about the\nperson whom she had seen in the lawn, was in no spirits for\nconversation. Nor did her thoughts, when they wandered to other objects\nfrom those immediately before her, bring home much to appease her\nanxiety. That nothing had yet been heard of Lord and Lady Westhaven, was\nextremely disquieting. She knew not that the Marquis of Montreville had\nreceived a letter for her under cover to him; and that having sent it to\nMr. Crofts in another, in order to be forwarded to her, the latter had\nexercised his political talents, and supposing it related to her claims\non Lord Montreville, and probably contained instructions for pursuing\nthem, and that therefore his Lordship would be but little concerned if\nit never reached the place of its destination, he had very composedly\nput it into the fire; and undertook, should it be enquired for, to\naccount for it's failure without suffering the name of Lord Montreville\nto be called in question.\n\nThe Marquis, tho' his conscience had been so long under the direction of\nSir Richard Crofts that it ought to have acquired insensibility as\ncallous as his own, yet found it sometimes a very troublesome companion;\nand it often spoke to him so severely on the subject of his niece, that\nhe was more than once on the point of writing to her, to say he was\nready to make her the retribution to which his heart told him she had\nthe clearest pretensions, and which his fears whispered that a court of\njustice would certainly render her.\n\nThese qualms and these fears, would inevitably have produced a\nrestoration of the Mowbray estate to it's owner, had they not been\ncounteracted by the influence of the Marchioness of Montreville and Sir\nRichard Crofts. The Marchioness, now in declining health, felt all the\ninefficacy of riches, and all the fallacy of ambition; yet could she not\ndetermine to relinquish one, or to own that the other had but little\npower to confer happiness. That Emmeline Mowbray, whom she had despised\nand rejected, should suddenly become heiress to a large fortune, and\nthat of that fortune her own children should be deprived; that Lord\nWesthaven should be the instrument to assist her in this hateful\ntransition, and should interfere for this obscure orphan, against the\ninterest of the illustrious family into which he had married; stung her\nto the soul, and irritated the natural asperity of her temper, already\nsoured by the repeated defection of Delamere, and her own continual ill\nhealth, till it was grown insupportable to others, and injurious to\nherself; since it aggravated all her complaints, and put it out of the\npower of medicine to relieve her.\n\nRather than encrease these maladies by opposition, his Lordship was\ncontent to yield to delay. And while her haughtiness and violence\nwithheld him on one hand from settling with his niece, Sir Richard\nassailed him on the other with cool and plausible arguments; and\ntogether they obliged him to have recourse to such expedients as gained\ntime, without his having much hope that he could finally detain the\nproperty of his late brother from his daughter, who seemed likely to\nestablish her right to it's possession.\n\nAt once to indulge his avarice and quiet his conscience, he would\nwillingly have consented to pay her a considerable portion, and to leave\nher right to the whole undecided; but of such an accommodation there\nseemed no probability, unless he could win over Lord Westhaven to his\ninterest. He thought, however, that there could be little doubt of his\nre-uniting the Mowbray estate with his own, by promoting the marriage\nbetween Emmeline and Lord Delamere, which he had hitherto so strenuously\nopposed. But this, he knew, must be the last resort; not only because he\nwas ashamed so immediately to avow a change of opinion in regard to\nEmmeline, which could have happened only from her change of\ncircumstances, but because the dislike which Lady Montreville had\noriginally conceived towards her, now amounted to the most determined\nand inveterate hatred.\n\nBent on conversing fully with Lord Westhaven before he took any measures\nwhatever either to detain or to restore the estate, the Marquis was\ndesirous of seeing him immediately on his arrival in England, and to\nprecede any conversation he might hold with Emmeline. For this reason he\nkept back all information that related to his son-in-law's return; and\ntho' he knew that the indisposition of Lord Delamere and his sister had\nkept Lord Westhaven at Paris almost three weeks, and that they were\ntravelling only twenty miles a day, from thence to Calais, he had\nwithheld even this intelligence from the anxious Emmeline.\n\nLady Frances Crofts, never feeling any great disposition to filial\npiety, and having lost, in the giddy career of dissipation, the little\nsensibility she ever possessed, was soon tired of attending on her\nmother at Audley Hall. The fretful impatience or irksome lassitude which\ndevoured a mind without resources, and weary of itself, in the\nmelancholy gloom of a sick chamber, soon disgusted and fatigued her; she\ntherefore left Audley Hall in October, and after staying ten days or a\nfortnight in Burlington street, where she made an acquaintance with\nBellozane, she went to pass the months that yet intervened before it was\nfashionable to appear in London, at a villa near Richmond; which she had\ntaken in the summer, and fitted up with every ornament luxury could\ninvent or money purchase. She retired not thither, however, to court the\nsylvan deities: a set of friends of both sexes attended her. Bellozane\nwas very handsome, very lively, very much a man of fashion: Lady\nFrances, who thought him no bad addition to her train, invited him also.\nBellozane became the life of the party; and was soon so much at his ease\nin the family, and so great a favourite with her Ladyship, at a very\nearly period of their acquaintance, that only her high rank there\nexempted her from those censures, which, in a less elevated condition,\nwould have fallen on her, from the grave and sagacious personages who\nare so good as to take upon them the regulation of the world.\n\nCrofts, detained by his office in London, heard more than gave him any\npleasure. But like a wise and cautious husband, he forebore to complain.\nBesides the fear of his wife, which was no inconsiderable motive to\nsilence, he had the additional fear of the martial and fierce-looking\nFrench soldier before his eyes; who talked, in very bad English, of such\nencounters and exploits as made the cold-blooded politician shudder.\n\nWhen, on Friday evenings, after the business of his office was over, he\nwent down to Richmond, he now always found there this foreign Adonis;\nand beheld him with mingled hatred and horror, tho' he concealed both\nunder the appearance of cringing and servile complaisance. And when Lady\nFrances compared the narrow-spirited and mean-looking Crofts, with the\nhandsome, animated, gallant Bellozane, the poor husband felt all the\ndisadvantages of the comparison, and as certainly suffered for it.\nScorning to dissimulate with a man whom she thought infinitely too\nfortunate in being allied to her on any terms, and superior to the\ncensures of a world, the greater part of whom she considered as beings\nof another species from the daughter of the Marquis of Montreville, her\nLadyship grew every day fonder of the Chevalier, and less solicitous to\nconceal her partiality. She found, too, her vanity and inordinate self\nlove gratified, in believing that this elegant foreigner did justice to\nher superior attractions, and had been won by them, from that\ninclination for Emmeline which had brought him to England. A conquest\nsnatched from _her_, whom she had always considered at once with envy\nand contempt, was doubly delightful; and Bellozane, with all the\nvolatility of his adopted country, saw nothing disloyal or improper in\nreturning the kind attentions of Lady Frances, _en attendant_ the\narrival of Emmeline; with whom he was a good deal piqued for her having\nleft London so abruptly without informing him whither she was gone. He\nstill preferred her to every other person; but he was not therefore\ninsensible to the kindness, or blind to the charms of Lady Frances; who\nwas really very handsome; and who, with a great portion of the beauty\ninherited by the Mowbray family, possessed the Juno-like air as well as\nthe high spirit of her mother. In aid of these natural advantages, every\nrefinement of art was exhausted; and by those who preferred it's\ndazzling effects to the interesting and graceful simplicity of unadorned\nbeauty, Lady Frances, dressed for the opera, might have been esteemed\nmore charming, than Emmeline in her modest muslin night gown; or than\nthe pensive Madona, which, in her widow's dress, was represented by Lady\nAdelina.\n\nThese two friends, after having passed a calm afternoon together,\nretired early to their respective apartments. Emmeline, who had a\nrepeating watch, given her by Lord Westhaven, wound it up carefully; and\nhaving bolted her chamber door, lay down for a few hours; being sure\nthat the anxiety she felt would awaken her before the return of that on\nwhich the stranger had appeared the preceding night. Fatigue and long\nwatching closed her eyes; but her slumber was imperfect; and suddenly\nawaking at some fancied noise, she pressed her repeater, and found it\nwas half past three o'clock.\n\nThis was about the time on which the man had appeared the night before;\nand tho' she felt some fear, she had yet more curiosity to know whether\nhe came again. She arose softly, therefore, and went to the window,\nwhich she did not venture to open. But she had no occasion to look\ntowards the shrubbery to watch the coming of the stranger; he was\nalready traversing the length of the house, dressed as before; and with\nhis arms folded, and his head bent towards the ground, he slowly moved\nin the same pensive attitude.\n\nEmmeline, tho' now impressed with deeper astonishment, summoned\nresolution narrowly to observe his air and figure. Had not his hat\nconcealed his face, the obscurity would not have allowed her to examine\nhis features. But tho' the great coat he wore considerably altered the\noutline of his person, she still thought she discerned the form of\nFitz-Edward. His height and his walk confirmed this idea; and the longer\nshe observed him, the more she was persuaded it was Fitz-Edward himself.\nThis conviction was not unaccompanied by terror. She wished to speak to\nhim; and to represent the indiscretion, the madness of his thus risking\nthe reputation of Lady Adelina; and his own life or that of one of her\nbrothers; while the very idea of Godolphin's resentment and danger\nfilled her mind with the most alarming apprehensions. She determined\nthen to open the window and speak to him: yet if it should not be\nFitz-Edward? At length she had collected the courage necessary; and\nknowing that tho' the whole family was yet fast asleep she could easily\nrouse them, if the person to whom she spoke should not be known to her,\nand gave her any reason for alarm, she was on the point of lifting up\nthe sash, when the stranger put an end to her deliberations by hastily\nwalking away to his former covert among the shrubs; and she saw him no\nmore.\n\nEmmeline, wearied alike with watchfulness and uneasiness, now went to\nbed; having at length determined to keep Barret (on whose silence and\ndiscretion she could rely) with her the next night; and when the Colonel\nappeared (for the Colonel she was sure it was) to send her to him, or at\nleast make her witness to what she should herself say to him from the\nwindow. The anxiety of her mind made her very low on the early part of\nthe next day; and Lady Adelina was still more so. They dined, however,\nearly; and as the evening was clear, and they had not been out in the\nmorning, Lady Adelina proposed their taking a short walk to the top of\nthe hill behind the house, which commanded a glorious view that Emmeline\nhad not seen; but as it was cold, they agreed to leave little William at\nhome. The grounds of Godolphin behind the house, consisted only of a\nsmall paddock, divided from the kitchen garden by a dwarf wall; and the\ncopse, which partly cloathed the hill, and thro' which a footpath went\nto a village about two miles beyond it. The woody ground ceasing about\nhalf way up, opened to a down which commanded the view. They stood\nadmiring it a few moments; and then Emmeline, who could not for an\ninstant help reflecting on what she had seen for two nights, felt\nsomething like alarm at being so far from the house. She complained\ntherefore that it was cold; and the evening (at this season very short)\nwas already shutting in.\n\nThe wind blew chill and hollow among the half stripped trees, as they\npassed thro' the wood; and the dead leaves rustled in the blast. 'Twas\nsuch a night as Ossian might describe. Emmeline recollected the\nvisionary beings with which his poems abound, and involuntarily she\nshuddered. At the gate that opened into the lawn, Lady Adelina stopped\nas if she was tired. She was talking of something Godolphin had done;\nand Emmeline, who on that subject was never weary of hearing her, turned\nround, and they both leaned for a moment against the gate, looking up\nthe wood walk from which they had just descended. The veil of Lady\nAdelina was over her face; but Emmeline, less wrapped up, suddenly saw\nthe figure which had before visited the garden, descending, in exactly\nthe same posture, down the pathway, which was rather steep. He seemed\nunknowingly to follow it, without looking up; and was soon so near them,\nthat Emmeline, losing at once her presence of mind, clasped her hands,\nand exclaimed--'Good God! who is this?'\n\n'What?' said Lady Adelina, looking towards him.\n\nBy this time he was within six paces of the gate; and sprung forward at\nthe very moment that she knew him, and fell senseless on the ground.\n\nEmmeline, unable to save her, was in a situation but little better.\nFitz-Edward, for it was really himself, knelt down by her, and lifted\nher up. But she was without any appearance of life; and he, who had no\nintention of rushing thus abruptly into her presence, was too much\nagitated to be able to speak.\n\n'Ah! why would you do this, Sir?' said Emmeline in a tremulous voice.\n'What can I do with her?' added she. 'Merciful Heaven, what can be done?\nHow _could_ you be so cruel, so inconsiderate?'\n\n'Don't talk to me,' said he--'don't reproach me! I am not able to bear\nit! I suffer too much already! Have you no salts? Have you nothing to\ngive her?'\n\nEmmeline now with trembling hands searched her pockets for a bottle of\nsalts which she sometimes carried. She luckily had it; and, in another\npocket, some Hungary water, with which she bathed the temples of her\nfriend, who still lay apparently dead.\n\nShe remained some moments in that situation; and Emmeline had time to\nreflect, which she did with the utmost perturbation, on what would be\nthe consequence of this interview when she recovered her recollection.\nShe dreaded lest the sight of Fitz-Edward should totally unsettle her\nreason. She dreaded lest Godolphin should know he had clandestinely been\nthere; and she concluded it were better to persuade him to leave them\nbefore the senses of Lady Adelina returned.\n\n'How fearfully long she continues in this fainting fit,' cried she, 'and\nyet do I dread seeing her recover from it.'\n\n'You dread it!--and why dread it?'\n\n'Indeed I do. When her recollection returns, it may yet be worse; you\nknow not how nearly gone her intellects have at times been, and the\nleast emotion may render her for ever a lunatic.'\n\n'It is the cruelty of her brother,' sternly replied Fitz-Edward, 'that\nhas driven her to this. His rigid conduct has overwhelmed her spirits\nand broken her heart. But _now_, since we _have_ met, we part not till I\nhear from herself whether she prefers driving _me_ to desperation, or\nquitting, in the character I can now offer her, the cold and barbarous\nGodolphin.'\n\n'Do not, ah! pray do not attempt to speak to her now. Let me try to get\nher home; and when she is better able to see you, indeed I will send to\nyou.'\n\n'Can you then suppose I will leave her? But perhaps she is already gone!\nShe seems to be dead--quite dead and cold!'\n\nNothing but terror now lent Emmeline strength to continue chafing her\ntemples and her hands. In another moment or two the blood began to\ncirculate; and soon after, with a deep sigh, Lady Adelina opened her\neyes.\n\n'For pity's sake,' said Emmeline in a low voice--'for pity's sake do not\nspeak to her.' Then addressing herself to her, she said--'Lady Adelina,\nare you better?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Do you think I can assist you home?'\n\n'She shall not be hurried,' said Fitz-Edward.\n\n'Ah! save me! save me!' exclaimed she, faintly shrieking--'save me!' and\nclasping her arms round Emmeline, she attempted to rise.\n\n'Am I then grown so hateful to you,' said Fitz-Edward, as he assisted\nand supported her--'that for one poor moment you will not allow me to\napproach you. Will no penitence, no sufferings obtain your pity?'\n\n'Take me away, Emmeline!' cried she, in a hurried manner--'ah! take me\nquick away! Godolphin will come, he will come indeed.--Let us go\nhome--go home before he finds us here!'\n\n'It is as I said!' exclaimed Fitz-Edward: 'her brother has terrified her\ninto madness. But----'\n\nEmmeline, now making an effort to escape falling into a condition as\ndeplorable as was her friend's, said, with some firmness--'Mr.\nFitz-Edward, I must entreat you to say nothing about her brother. It is\na topic of all others least likely to restore her.'\n\nAdelina still clung to her; and putting away Fitz-Edward with her hand,\nlaid her head on the shoulder of Emmeline, who said--'I fancy you can\nwalk. Shall we go towards home?'\n\nLady Adelina, without speaking, and still motioning with her hand to\nFitz-Edward to leave her, moved on. But so enfeebled was she, that in\nthe very attempt she had again nearly fallen; Emmeline being infinitely\ntoo much frightened to lend her much assistance.\n\n'She cannot walk,' cried Fitz-Edward, 'yet will not let me support her.\nWill _you_, Miss Mowbray, accept my arm; perhaps it may enable you to\nguide better the faultering steps of your friend.'\n\nEmmeline thought that at all events it was better to get her into the\nhouse; and therefore taking, in silence, the arm that Fitz-Edward\noffered her, she proceeded across the lawn. Lady Adelina appeared to\nexert herself. She quickened her pace a little; and they were soon at a\nsmall gate, which opened in a wire fence near the house to keep the\ncattle immediately from the windows. Here Emmeline determined to make\nanother effort on Fitz-Edward to persuade him to leave them.\n\n'Now,' said she, 'we shall do very well. Had you not better quit us?'\n\nHe seemed disposed to obey; when Mrs. Barret, who had seen them from the\ndoor, where she had been watching the return of her lady, advanced\nhastily towards them, and said to Emmeline--'Dear Ma'am, I am so glad\nyou and my lady are come in! The Captain is quite frightened at your\nbeing out so late.'\n\n'The Captain!' exclaimed Emmeline.\n\n'Yes, Ma'am, the Captain has been come in about two minutes; he is but\njust seeing Master Godolphin, and then was coming out to meet you.'\n\n'Take hold of your lady, Barret,' cried Emmeline. Barret ran forward.\nBut Lady Adelina (whom the terror of her brother's return at such a\nmoment had again entirely overcome), was already lifeless in the arms of\nFitz-Edward; and Emmeline, whose first idea was to go in and prevent\nGodolphin from coming out to meet them, could get no farther than the\ndoor; where, breathless and almost senseless, she was only prevented\nfrom falling by leaning against one of the pillars.\n\n'Your lady is in a fainting fit, Mrs. Barret,' said Fitz-Edward; 'pray\nassist her.'\n\nThe woman at once knew his voice, and saw the situation of her lady; and\nterrified both by the one and the other, screamed aloud. Godolphin,\ncaressing his nephew in the parlour, heard not the shriek; but a footman\nwho was crossing the hall ran out; and flying by Emmeline, ran to the\ngroup beyond her; where, as Mrs. Barret still wildly called for help for\nLady Adelina, he proposed to Fitz-Edward to carry her ladyship into the\nhouse, which they together immediately did.\n\nThis was what Emmeline most dreaded. But there was no time for\nremonstrance. As they passed her at the door, she put her hand upon\nFitz-Edward's arm, and cried--'Oh! stop! for God's sake stop!'\n\n'Why stop?' said he. 'No! nothing shall now detain me; I am determined,\nand _must_ go on!' She saw, indeed, that Godolphin's being in the house\nonly made him more obstinately bent to enter it.\n\nThe door of the parlour now opened; and Godolphin saw, with astonishment\ninexpressible, his sister, to all appearance dead, in the arms of\nFitz-Edward; and Emmeline, as pale and almost as lifeless, following\nher; who silently, and with fixed eyes, sat down near the door.\n\n'What can be the meaning of this?' exclaimed Godolphin. 'Miss\nMowbray!--my Emmeline!--my Adelina!'\n\nThe child, with whom Godolphin had been at play, reached out his little\narms to Lady Adelina, whom they had placed on a sopha. Godolphin sat him\ndown upon it; and not knowing where to fix his own attention, he looked\nwildly, first at his sister, and then at Emmeline; while Fitz-Edward,\ntotally regardless of him, knelt by the side of Lady Adelina, and\nsurveyed her and the little boy with an expression impossible to be\ndescribed.\n\n'For mercy's sake tell me,' Godolphin, as he took the cold and trembling\nhands of Emmeline in his--'for mercy's sake tell me what all this means?\nIs my sister, my poor Adelina dead?'\n\n'I hope not!'\n\n'You are yourself almost terrified to death. Your hands tremble. Tell\nme, I conjure you tell me, what you have met with, and to what is owing\nthe extraordinary appearance of Mr. Fitz-Edward here?'\n\n'That, or any farther enquiry Mr. Godolphin has to make, which may\nrelate to me,' said Fitz-Edward sternly, 'I shall be ready at any other\ntime to answer; but now it appears more necessary to attend to this dear\ninjured creature!'\n\n'Injured, Sir!' cried Godolphin, turning angrily towards him--'Do you\ncome hither to tell me your crimes, or to triumph in their consequence?'\n\n'Oh! for the love of heaven!' said Emmeline, with all the strength she\ncould collect, 'let this proceed no farther. Consider,' added she,\nlowering her voice, 'the servants are in the room. Reflect on the\nconsequence of what you say.'\n\n'Let every body but Barret go out,' said Godolphin aloud.\n\nThe child, whose usual hour of going to rest was already past, had crept\nup to his mother, heedless of the people who surrounded her, and had\ndropped asleep on her bosom.\n\n'Should I take Master, Sir?' enquired the nursery maid of Godolphin.\n\n'Leave him!' answered he, fiercely.\n\nExcess of terror now operated to restore, in some measure, to Emmeline\nthe presence of mind it had deprived her of. She found it absolutely\nnecessary to exert herself; and advancing towards Lady Adelina, by whose\nside Fitz-Edward still knelt, she took one of her hands--'I hope,' said\nshe to Barret, your lady is coming to; she is less pale, and her pulse\nis returning. Colonel Fitz-Edward, would it not be better for you now to\nleave us?'\n\n'I must first speak to Lady Adelina.'\n\n'Impossible! you cannot speak to her to-night.'\n\n'Nor can I leave her, Madam, unless she herself dismisses me.--Leave\nher, thus weak and languid, to meet perhaps on my account reproach and\nunkindness!'\n\n'Reproach and unkindness! Mr. Fitz-Edward,' said Godolphin, in a\npassionate tone--'Reproach and unkindness! Do me the favour to say from\nwhom you apprehend she may receive such treatment?'\n\n'From the cruel and unrelenting brother, who has persisted in wishing\nto divide us, even after heaven itself has removed the barrier between\nus.'\n\n'Sir,' replied Godolphin, with a stern calmness--'in this house, and in\nMiss Mowbray's presence, _you_ may say any thing with impunity, and _I_\nmay bear this language even from the faithless destroyer of my sister.'\n\nFitz-Edward now starting from his knees, looked the defiance he was\nabout to utter, when Lady Adelina drew a deep and loud sigh, and Barret\nexclaimed--'For God's sake, gentlemen, do not go on with these high\nwords. My lady is coming to; but this sort of discourse will throw her\nagain into her fits worse than ever. Pray let me entreat of you both to\nbe pacified.'\n\n'I insist upon it,' said Emmeline, 'that you are calm, or it will not be\nin my power to stay. I must leave you, indeed I must, Mr. Godolphin! if\nyou would not see _me_ expire with terror, and entirely kill your\nsister, you must be cool.' She was indeed again deprived nearly of her\nbreath and recollection by the fear of their instantly flying to\nextremities.\n\nLady Adelina now opened her eyes and looked round her. But there was\nwildness and horror in them; and she seemed rather to see the objects,\nthan to have any idea of who were with her.\n\nThe child, however, was always present to her. 'My dear boy here?' cried\nshe, faintly; 'poor fellow, he is asleep!'\n\n'Shall I take him from you, Ma'am?' asked her woman.\n\n'Oh! no! I will put him to bed myself.' She then again reposed her head\nas if fatigued, and sighed. 'Twas all,' said she, 'long foreseen. But\ndestiny, they say, must be fulfilled, and fate will have it's way. I\nwish I had not been the cause of his death, however.'\n\n'Of whose death, dear Madam?' said Barret. 'Nobody is dead; nobody\nindeed.'\n\n'Did I not hear him groan, and see him die? did not he tell me, I know\nnot what, of my Lord Westhaven? I shall remember it all distinctly\nto-morrow!'\n\nShe now rested again, profoundly sighing; and Emmeline beckoning to\nFitz-Edward and Godolphin, took them to the other end of the room, where\nthe arm of the sopha she reclined on concealed them from her view.\n'Pray,' said she, addressing herself to them both, 'pray leave her.'\nThen recollecting that she dared not trust them together, she\nadded--'No, don't both go at once. But indeed it is absolutely\nnecessary to have her kept quite quiet and got to bed as soon as\npossible.'\n\n'I believe it is,' answered Godolphin. 'Poor Adelina! her dreadful\nmalady is returned.'\n\n'It is indeed,' said Emmeline. 'I have seen it too evidently approaching\nfor some days; and this last shock'--she stopped, and repented she had\nsaid so much.\n\n'Mr. Fitz-Edward,' cried Godolphin, 'will you walk with me into another\nroom?'\n\n'Certainly.'\n\n'Oh! no! no!' exclaimed Emmeline with quickness.\n\nThey were going out together; but taking an arm of each, she eagerly\nrepeated 'oh! no! no! not together!'\n\nThe imagination of Lady Adelina was now totally disordered. She had\nrisen; and carrying the child in her arms, walked towards her brother,\nwho in traversing the apartment with uneasy steps was by this time near\nthe door; while Fitz-Edward was at the other end of the room, where\nEmmeline was trying to persuade him to quit the house.\n\nLady Adelina, supported by her maid, and trembling under the weight of\nthe infant she clasped to her bosom, stepped along as quickly as her\nweakness would allow; and putting her hand on Godolphin's arm, she\ncried, in a slow and tremulous manner--'Stay, William! I have something\nto say to you before you go. Lord Westhaven, you know, is coming; and\nyou have promised that he shall not kill _me_. I may however die; and I\nrather believe I shall; for since this last sight I am strangely ill.\nYou and Emmeline will take care of my poor boy, will ye not? Had\nFitz-Edward lived--nay do not look so angry, for now he cannot offend\nyou--had poor Fitz-Edward lived, he would perhaps have taken him. But\nnow, I must depend on Emmeline, who has promised to be good to him. They\nsay she will have a great fortune too, and therefore I need not fear\nthat you will find my child burthensome.'\n\n'Burthensome!' cried Godolphin. 'Good God, Adelina!'\n\n'Well! well! be not offended. Only you know, when people come to have a\nfamily of their own, the child of another may be reckoned an\nincumbrance. I know that now you love my William dearly; but then, you\nknow, it will be another thing.'\n\n'Gracious heaven!' exclaimed Godolphin, 'what can have made her talk in\nthis manner?'\n\n'Reason in madness!' said Fitz-Edward, advancing towards her. 'Her son,\nhowever, shall be an incumbrance to nobody.'\n\nEmmeline now grasping his hand, implored him not to speak to her. Lady\nAdelina neither heard or noticed him: but again addressing herself to\nher brother, said, with a mournful sigh--'And now, since I have told you\nwhat was upon my mind, I will go put my little boy to bed. Good night to\nyou, dear William! You and Miss Mowbray will remember!----' She then\nwalked out of the room, and calmly took the way to her own, attended by\nher maid.\n\nEmmeline, not daring to leave together these two ardent spirits\nirritated against each other, remained, trembling, with them; hoping by\nher presence to prevent their animosity from blazing forth, and to\nprevail upon them to part. They both continued for some time to traverse\nthe room in gloomy silence. At length Fitz-Edward stopped, and said--'At\nwhat hour to-morrow, Sir, may I have the honour of some conversation\nwith you?'\n\n'At whatever hour you please, Sir--the earlier, however, the more\nagreeable.'\n\n'At seven o'clock, Sir, I will be with you.'\n\n'If you please; at that hour I will be ready to receive your commands.'\n\nFitz-Edward then took his hat, and bowing to Emmeline, wished her a good\nnight, and left the room. Starting from her chair, she followed him into\nthe hall, and shut the parlour door after her.\n\n'Fitz-Edward,' cried she, detaining him, and speaking in an half\nwhisper--'Fitz-Edward, hear me! Do you design to kill me?'\n\n'To kill you?' replied he. 'No surely.'\n\n'Then do not go till you have heard me.'\n\n'It is unpleasant to me to stay in Godolphin's house after what has just\npassed. But as you please.'\n\nShe led him into a little breakfast room; and regardless of being\nwithout light, shut the door.\n\n'Tell me,' said she, 'before I die with terror--tell me with what\nintention you come to-morrow?'\n\n'Simply to have a positive answer from Mr. Godolphin, if he will,\ntogether with his brother, allow me, when the usual mourning is over, to\naddress their sister with proposals of marriage; which in fact they have\nno right to prevent. And if Mr. Godolphin refuses----'\n\n'What, if he refuses?'\n\n'I shall take my son into my own care, and wait till Lady Adelina will\nherself exert that freedom which is now her's.'\n\n'Godolphin doats on the child. Nothing, I am persuaded, will induce him\nto part with it.'\n\n'Not part with it? He must, nay he _shall_!'\n\n'Pray be calm--pray be quiet. Stay yet a few months--a few weeks.'\n\n'Not a day! Not an hour!'\n\n'Good God! what _can_ be done? Mischief will inevitably happen!'\n\n'I am sorry,' replied Fitz-Edward, 'that you are thus made uneasy. But I\ncannot recede; and my life has not been pleasant enough lately to make\nme very solicitous about the event of my explanation with Mr. Godolphin.\nConscious, however, that he has some reason to complain of me, I do not\nwish to increase it. I mean to keep _my_ temper, _if I can_: but if he\nsuffers _his_ to pass the bounds which one gentleman must observe\ntowards another, I shall not consider myself as the aggressor, or as\nanswerable for the consequences.'\n\n'But why, oh! why would you come hither? Wherefore traverse the garden\nof a night, and suffer appearances to be so much against you, and what\nis yet worse, against Lady Adelina?'\n\n'Who told you I have done so--Godolphin?'\n\n'No. He was, you well know, absent. But I saw you myself; with terror I\nsaw you, and meditated how to speak to you alone, when our unhappy\nmeeting in the wood this evening put an end to all my contrivances.'\n\n'Yet I had no intention of terrifying you, or of abruptly rushing into\nthe presence of Adelina. It is true, that for some nights past I have\nwalked under the window where she and my child sleep: for _I_ could not\nsleep; and it was a sort of melancholy enjoyment to me to be near the\nspot which held all I have dear on earth. As I pass at the ale house\nwhere I lodge as a person hiding in this island from the pursuit of\ncreditors, my desire of concealment did not appear extraordinary. I have\noften lingered among the rocks and copses, and seen Adelina and my child\nwith you. Last night I came out in the dusk, and was approaching, to\nconceal myself near the house, in hopes, that as you love walking late,\nand alone, I might have found an opportunity of speaking to you, and of\nconcerting with _you_ the means of introducing myself to _her_ without\ntoo great an alarm.'\n\n'Would to heaven you had! But now, since all this has happened, consent\nto put off this meeting with Godolphin. Do not meet, at least,\nto-morrow! I entreat that you will not!'\n\n'On all subjects but this,' said he, as he opened the door--'on all\nsubjects but this, Miss Mowbray knows she may command me. But this is a\npoint from which I cannot, without infamy, recede; and in which she must\nforgive me, if all my veneration and esteem for her goodness and\ntenderness does not induce me to desist.'\n\nHe then went into the hall; and by the lamp which burnt there, opened\nhimself the door into the garden, and hastily walked away. While the\ntrembling and harrassed Emmeline, finding him inflexible, went back to\nGodolphin, with very little hopes that she should, with him, have better\nsuccess.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nOn entering the room, Emmeline sat down without speaking.\n\n'How is Adelina, my dearest Miss Mowbray?'\n\n'I know not.'\n\n'You have not, then, been with her?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'Were it not best to enquire after her?'\n\n'Certainly. I will go immediately.'\n\n'But come to me again--I have much to say to you.'\n\nEmmeline then went up stairs. She found that the composing medicine,\nwhich Barret had been directed to keep always by her, had been liberally\nadministered; and that her lady was got into bed, and was already\nasleep. Barret sat by her. Deep sighs and convulsive catchings marked\nthe extreme agitation of her spirits after she was no longer conscious\nof it herself. With this account Emmeline returned, in great uneasiness,\nto Godolphin.\n\n'I thank Heaven,' said he, 'that she is at least for some moments\ninsensible of pain! Now, my Emmeline, for surely I may be allowed to say\n_my_ Emmeline, sit down and try to compose yourself. I cannot bear to\nsee you thus pale and trembling.'\n\nHe led her to a seat, and placed himself by her; gazing with extreme\nconcern on her face, pallid as it was, and expressive only of sorrow and\nanxiety.\n\n'Whence is it,' said she, after a pause of some moments, that I see you\nhere? Did I not come hither on the assurance you gave me that you would\nlong be detained in or near London by the business of your sister?'\n\n'I certainly did say so. But I could not then foresee what happened on\nthe Sunday after you left London.'\n\n'Has, then, any thing happened?'\n\n'The return of Lord and Lady Westhaven, with Lord Delamere.'\n\n'Are they all well?'\n\n'Tolerably so. But my brother is very anxious to see Adelina; and\nexpects _you_ with little less solicitude. He could not think of giving\nLady Westhaven the trouble of such a journey; nor could he now leave her\nwithout being unhappy. I therefore, at his pressing request, came myself\nto fetch you both to London.'\n\n'And do you mean that we should begin our journey to-morrow?'\n\n'I _meant_ it, certainly, till the events of this evening made me\ndoubtful how far my sister herself may be in a situation to bear change\nof place and variety of objects; or being able, whether she may chuse to\nleave to me the direction of her actions.'\n\n'Ah! impute not to Lady Adelina the meeting with Fitz-Edward; it was\nentirely accidental; it's suddenness overcame her, and threw her into\nthe way in which you saw her.'\n\n'And what has a man to answer for, who thus comes to insult his victim,\nand to rob her of the little tranquillity time may have restored to\nher?'\n\n'Indeed I think you injure poor Fitz-Edward. Fondly attached to your\nsister, he has no other wish or hope than to be allowed to address her\nwhen the time of her mourning for Mr. Trelawny is expired. For this\npermission he intended to apply to you: but the severity with which you\never received his advances discouraged him; and he then, in the hope of\nhearing that such an application would not be rendered ineffectual by\nher own refusal, and languishing to see his son, came hither; not with\nany intention of forcing himself abruptly into the presence of Lady\nAdelina, but to see _me_ and induce me to intercede with her for an\ninterview. Accident threw us in his way; your sister fell senseless on\nthe ground; and when she did recover, endeavoured to avoid him: but she\nwas too weak to walk home without other assistance than mine, and I was\ncompelled to accept for her, that which Fitz-Edward offered. On hearing\nfrom Barret that you was returned, the terror which has ever pursued\nher, lest you and Fitz-Edward should meet as enemies, again overcame\nher, and occasioned the scene you must, with so much astonishment, have\nbeheld.'\n\n'Has Adelina had any previous knowledge of the proposals Fitz-Edward\nintends to make?'\n\n'None, I believe, in the world.'\n\n'Do you know whether they have ever corresponded?'\n\n'I am convinced they have not.'\n\n'There are objections, in my mind, _insuperable_ objections, to this\nalliance. These, however, I must talk over with the Colonel himself.'\n\n'Not _hostilely_, I hope. Surely you have too much regard for the\nunhappy Adelina, to give way now to any resentment you may have\nconceived against him; or if _that_ does not influence you, think of\nwhat _I_ must suffer.' She knew not what she had said; hardly what she\nintended to say.\n\n'Enchanting softness!' exclaimed Godolphin in a transport--'Is then the\nsafety of Godolphin so dear to that angelic bosom?'\n\n'You know it but too well. But if _my_ quiet is equally dear to _you_,\npromise me that if this meeting to-morrow _must_ take place, you will\nreceive Fitz-Edward with civility, and hear him with patience. Remember\non how many accounts this is necessary. Remember how many expressions\nthere are which his profession will not allow him to hear without\nresentment, that must end in blood. Your's is _no common_ cause of\nenmity; none of those trifling quarrels which daily send modern beaux\ninto the field. Your characters are both high as military men, and as\ngentlemen; and your former intimacy must, I know, impress more deeply on\nthe mind of each the injury or offence that either suppose they receive.\nBe careful then, Godolphin; promise me you will be careful!'\n\n'Ah! lovely Emmeline! more lovely from this generous tenderness than\nfrom your other exquisite perfections; can I be insensible of the value\nof a life for which _you_ interest yourself? and shall I suffer any\nother consideration to come in competition with your peace?'\n\n'You promise me then?'\n\n'To be calm with Fitz-Edward, I do. And while I remember his offence\n(for can I forget while I suffer from it) I will also recollect, that\n_you_, who have also suffered on the same account, think him worthy of\ncompassion; and I will try to conquer, at least to stifle, my\nresentment. But what shall we do with Adelina?'\n\n'That must depend on her situation in the morning. I have greatly\napprehended an unhappy turn in her intellects ever since my first\ncoming. The death of Trelawny, far from appearing to have relieved her\nby removing the impediment to her union with Fitz-Edward, seems rather\nto have rendered her more wretched. Continually agitated by contending\npassions, she was long unhappy, in the supposition that Fitz-Edward had\nobeyed her when she desired him to forget her. Since Trelawny's decease,\nas she has more fearlessly allowed her thoughts to dwell on him, she has\nsuffered all the anxiety of expecting to hear from him, and all the\nbitterness of disappointment. And I could plainly perceive, that she was\nstill debating with herself, whether, if he _did_ apply to her, she\nshould accept him, or by a violent effort of heroism determine to see\nhim no more. This conflict is yet to come. Judge whether, in the frame\nof mind in which you see her, she is equal to it; and whether any\nadditional terror for you and for him will not quite undo her. Alas! far\nfrom aggravating, by pursuing your resentment, anguish so poignant, try\nrather to soothe her sorrows and assist her determination. And whatever\nthat determination may be, when it is once made she may perhaps be\nrestored to health and to tranquillity.'\n\n'Indeed I will do all you dictate, my loveliest friend! Surely I should\nill deserve the generosity you have shewn to me, were I incapable of\nfeeling for others, and particularly for my sister. But wherefore that\nair of defiance which Mr. Fitz-Edward thought it necessary to assume? He\nseemed to come more disposed to _insult_ than to conciliate the family\nof Lady Adelina.'\n\n'Alas! do you make no allowance for the perturbed situation of his mind,\nwhen he saw the woman he adores to all appearance dead, and for the\nfirst time beheld the poor little boy? He looked upon you as one who\ndesires to tear from him for ever these beloved objects; and forgetting\nthat he was the aggressor, thought only of the injury which he supposed\nyou intended.'\n\n'There is, indeed, some apology for the asperity of his manner; and\nperhaps I was in some measure to blame. Generous, candid, considerate\nEmmeline! how does your excellent heart teach you to excuse those\nweaknesses you do not feel, and to pity and to forgive errors which\nyour own perfect mind makes it impossible for you to commit! Ah! how\nheavily is your tenderness perpetually taxed: _here_, it is suffering\nfrom the sight of Adelina--in town, it will have another object in the\nunfortunate Delamere.'\n\n'Did you not tell me he was in tolerable health?'\n\n'Alas! what is bodily health when the mind is ill at ease? The anxiety\nof Delamere to see you, to hear his destiny from yourself, is uneasy\neven to me, who feel my own exquisite happiness in knowing what that\ndestiny must be. I look with even painful commiseration on this singular\nyoung man. Yet from passions so violent, and obstinacy so invincible, I\nmust have rejoiced that Miss Mowbray has escaped; even tho' her\npreference of the fortunate Godolphin had not rendered his lot the most\nhappy that a human being can possess.'\n\n'Since you are so good,' said Emmeline faintly, for she was quite\nexhausted, 'to compassionate the situation of mind of Delamere, you\nwill, I think, see the humanity of concealing from him--that--' She\ncould find no term that she liked, to express her meaning, and stopped.\n\n'That he has a fortunate rival?' said Godolphin. 'No, dearest Emmeline,\nI hope I am incapable of such a triumph! 'Till poor Delamere is more at\nease, I am content to enjoy the happiness of knowing your favourable\nopinion, without wishing, by an insulting display of it, to convince him\nhe has for ever\n\n\n    'Thrown a pearl away richer than all his tribe!'\n\n\n'Yet I am sure you will think it still more cruel to give him hope. I\nwill tell you all my weakness. While I see you here, all benignity and\ngoodness to me, I feel for Lord Delamere infinite pity; but were you to\nreceive him with your usual sweetness, to give him many of those\nenchanting smiles, and to look at him with those soft eyes, as if you\ntenderly felt his sorrows, I am not sure whether the most unreasonable\njealousy would not possess me, and whether I should not hate him as much\nas I now wish him well.'\n\n'That were to be indeed unreasonable, and to act very inconsistently\nwith your natural candour and humanity. I will not think so ill of you\nas to believe you. You know I must of course often see Lord Delamere:\nbut after the avowal you have extorted from me, surely I need not repeat\nthat I shall see him only as my friend.'\n\nGodolphin then kissed her hands in rapture; and for a few moments forgot\neven his concern for Lady Adelina. Emmeline now wished to break off the\nconversation; and he at length allowed her to leave him. After having\nenquired of Barret after her mistress, who was happily in a calmer\nsleep, she retired to her own room, where she hoped to have a few hours\nof repose: but notwithstanding the promises of Godolphin, she felt as\nthe hour of the morning approached on which he was to meet Fitz-Edward,\nthat anxiety chased away sleep, and again made her suffer the cruellest\nsuspense.\n\nThe heart of Godolphin, glowing with the liveliest sense of his own\nhappiness, yet felt with great keenness the unfortunate situation of his\nsister. He began to doubt whether he had any right to perpetuate her\nwretchedness; and whether it were not better to leave it to herself to\ndecide in regard to Fitz-Edward. The delicacy of his honour made him see\nan infinity of objections to their marriage, which to common minds might\nappear chimerical and romantic. To that part of his own family who were\nyet ignorant of her former indiscretion, as he could not urge his\nreasons, his opposition of Fitz-Edward must seem capricious and unjust.\nLord Westhaven must therefore either be told that which had hitherto\nwith so much pains been concealed from him, or he must determine to\nrefer Fitz-Edward entirely to Lady Adelina herself; and on this, after\nlong deliberation, he fixed.\n\nExactly as the clock struck seven, Fitz-Edward was at the door; and was\nintroduced into Godolphin's study, who was already up and waiting for\nhim. Emmeline, still full of apprehension, had arisen before six, and\nhearing Lady Adelina was still asleep, had gone down stairs, and waited\nwith a palpitating heart in the breakfast room.\n\nShe was glad to distinguish, at their first meeting, the usual\nsalutations of the morning. She listened; but tho' the rest of the house\nwas profoundly silent, she could not hear their conversation or even the\ntone in which it was carried on. It was not, however, loud, and she drew\nfrom thence a favourable omen. Near two hours passed, during which\nbreakfast was carried in to them; and as the servant passed backwards\nand forwards, she heard parts of sentences which assured her that then,\nat least, they were conversing on indifferent subjects.\n\nNow, therefore, the agitation of her spirits began to subside; and she\ndared even to hope that this meeting would prove the means of\nreconciliation, rather than of producing those fatal effects she had\ndreaded.\n\nIn about a quarter of an hour, however, after they had finished their\nbreakfast, they went out and crossed the lawn together. Then again her\nheart failed her; and without knowing exactly what she intended, she\ntook the little boy, whom the maid had just brought to her, and walked\nas quickly as possible after them. Before she could overtake them, they\nhad reached the gate; and in turning to shut it after him, Godolphin saw\nher, and both together came hastily back to meet her. At the same\nmoment, the child putting out his hands to Godolphin, called him papa!\nas he had been used to do; and Fitz-Edward, snatching him up, kissed him\ntenderly, while his eyes were filled with tears.\n\nGodolphin took the hand of Emmeline. 'Why this terror? why this haste?'\nsaid he, observing her to be almost breathless.\n\n'I thought--I imagined--I was afraid--' answered she, not knowing what\nshe said.\n\n'Be not alarmed,' said Godolphin--'We go together as friends.'\n\n'And Godolphin,' interrupted Fitz-Edward, 'is again the same noble\nminded Godolphin I once knew, and have always loved.'\n\n'Let us say then,' cried Emmeline, 'no more of the past.--Let us look\nforward only to the future.'\n\n'And the happiness of that future, at least as far as it relates to me,\ndepends, dearest Miss Mowbray, on you.'\n\n'On me!'\n\n'Godolphin wishes me not now to see his sister. I have acquiesced. He\nwishes me even to refrain from seeing her till she has been six months a\nwidow. With this, also, I have complied. But as it is not in my power to\nremain thus long in a suspence so agonizing as that I now endure, he\nallows me to write to her, and refers wholly to herself my hopes and my\ndespair. Ah! generous, lovely Emmeline! _you_ can influence the mind of\nyour friend. When she is calm, give her the letter I will send to you;\nand if you would save me from a life of lingering anguish to which death\nis preferable, procure for me a favourable answer.'\n\nEmmeline could not refuse a request made by Fitz-Edward which Godolphin\nseemed not to oppose. She therefore acquiesced; and saw him, after he\nhad again tenderly caressed the child, depart with Godolphin, who\ndesired her to return to the house, in order to await Lady Adelina's\nrising; where he would soon join her. With an heart lightened of half\nthe concern she had felt on this melancholy subject, she now went to the\napartment of her poor friend, who was just awakened from the stupor\nrather than the sleep into which the soporifics she had taken had thrown\nher. With an heavy and reluctant eye she looked round her, as if\nhopeless of seeing the image now always present to her imagination.\nEmmeline approached her with the child. She seemed happy to see them;\nand desiring her to sit down by the bed side, said--'Tell me truly what\nhas happened? Have I taken any medicine that has confused my head, or\nhow happens it that I appear to have been in a long and most uneasy\ndream? Wild and half formed images still seem to float before my eyes;\nand when I attempt to make them distinct, I am but the more bewildered\nand uneasy.'\n\n'Think not about it, then, till the heaviness you complain of is gone\noff.'\n\n'Tell me, Emmeline, have I really only dreamed, or was a stranger here\nyesterday? I thought, that suddenly I saw Fitz-Edward, thin, pale,\nemaciated, looking as if he were unhappy; and then, as it has of late\noften happened, I lost at once all traces of him; and in his place\nGodolphin came, and I know not what else; it is all confusion and\nterror!'\n\nEmmeline now considered a moment; and then concluded that it would be\nbetter to relate distinctly to her, since she now seemed capable of\nhearing it, all that had really passed the preceding evening, than to\nlet her fatigue her mind by conjectures, and enfeeble it by fears. She\ntherefore gave her a concise detail of what had happened; from the\naccidental meeting with Fitz-Edward, to the parting she had herself just\nhad with him in the garden. She carefully watched the countenance of\nLady Adelina while she was speaking; and saw with pleasure, that tho'\nexcessively agitated, she melted into tears, and heard, with a calmer\njoy than she had dared to hope, the certainty of Fitz-Edward's tender\nattachment, and the unhoped for reconciliation between him and her\nbrother. Having indulged her tears some time, she tenderly pressed the\nhand of Emmeline, and said, in a faint voice, that she found herself\nunable to rise and meet Godolphin till she had recovered a little more\nstrength of mind, and that she wished to be left alone. Emmeline,\nrejoiced to find her so tranquil, left her, and rejoined Godolphin, who\nwas by this time returned; and who read, in the animated countenance of\nEmmeline, that she had favourable news to relate to him of his sister.\n\nWhile they enjoyed together the prospect of Lady Adelina's return to\nhealth and peace, of which they had both despaired, the natural\nchearfulness of Emmeline, which anxiety and affection had so long\nobscured, seemed in some degree to return; and feeling that she loved\nGodolphin better than ever, for that generous placability of spirit he\nhad shewn to the repentant Fitz-Edward, she no longer attempted to\nconceal her tenderness, or withhold her confidence from her deserving\nlover. They breakfasted together; and afterwards, as Lady Adelina still\nwished to be alone, they walked over the little estate which lay round\nthe house, and Emmeline allowed him to talk of the improvements he\nmeditated when she should become it's mistress. The pleasure, however,\nwhich lightened in her eyes, and glowed in her bosom, was checked and\ndiminished when the image of Delamere, in jealousy and despair, intruded\nitself. And she could look forward to no future happiness for herself,\nundashed with sorrow, while he remained in a state of mind so\ndeplorable. When they returned into the house, Barret brought to\nGodolphin the following note.--\n\n\n    'Dearest and most generous Godolphin! I find myself unequal to\n  the task of _speaking_ on what has passed within these last twenty\n  four hours. I wish still to see you. But let our conversation turn\n  wholly on Lord Westhaven, of whom I am anxious to hear; and spare\n  me, for the present, on the subject which now blinds with tears\n  your weak but grateful and affectionate\n\n                                                             ADELINA.'\n\n\nGodolphin now assured her, by Emmeline, that he would mention nothing\nthat should give her a moment's pain, and that she should herself lead\nthe conversation.\n\nHe soon after went up to her and Emmeline, in her dressing room; and\nfound her still calm, tho' very low and languid. The name of Fitz-Edward\nwas carefully avoided. But in the short time they were together,\nGodolphin observed that the eyes of Lady Adelina seemed, on the entrance\nof any one into the room, fearfully and anxiously to examine whether\nthey brought the letter she had been taught to expect from Fitz-Edward.\nIt was easy to see that she deeply meditated on the answer which she\nmust give; and that she felt an internal struggle, which Godolphin\nfeared might again unsettle her understanding. She was too faint to sit\nup long; and desirous of being left entirely alone, Godolphin had for\nthe rest of the day the happiness of entertaining Emmeline apart. He\nfailed not to avail himself of it; and drew from her a confession of her\npartiality towards him, even from the first day of their acquaintance;\nand long before she dared trust her heart to enquire into the nature of\nthose sentiments with which it was impressed.\n\nLate in the evening, a messenger arrived with the expected letter from\nFitz-Edward. To convince Godolphin of the perfect integrity with which\nhe acted, he sent him a copy of it; adding, that he was then on his road\nto London, where he should await, in painful solicitude, the decision of\nLady Adelina. It was determined that Emmeline should give her the letter\nthe next morning; and that if after reading it she retained the same\nlanguid composure which she had before shewn, they should go in the\nevening to Southampton, and from thence proceed the following day to\nLondon, where Lord and Lady Westhaven so anxiously expected their\narrival.\n\nWhen Emmeline delivered the letter, Lady Adelina turned pale, and\ntrembled. She left her to read it; and on returning to her in about half\nan hour, Emmeline found her drowned in tears. She seemed altogether\nunwilling to speak of the contents of the letter; but assured Emmeline\nthat she was very well able to undertake the journey her brother\nproposed, and she believed it would be rather useful than prejudicial to\nher. 'As to the letter,' added she, with a deep sigh, 'it will not for\nsome days be in my power to answer it.'\n\nEvery thing was, by the diligence of Godolphin, soon prepared for their\ndeparture. Lady Adelina, her little boy, Emmeline and Godolphin,\nattended by their servants, went the same evening to Southampton; from\nwhence they began their journey the next day; and resting one night at\nFarnham, arrived early on the following at the house Lord Westhaven had\ntaken in Grosvenor street.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nThe transports with which Lord Westhaven received his sister, were\nconsiderably checked by her melancholy air and faded form. The beauty\nand vivacity which she possessed when he last saw her, were quite gone,\ntho' she was now only in her twenty second year; and tears and sighs\nwere the only language by which she could express the pleasure she felt\nat again seeing him. Imputing, however, this dejection entirely to her\nlate unfortunate marriage, his Lordship expressed rather sorrow than\nwonder. He admired the little boy, whom he believed to be the son of\nGodolphin; and he met Emmeline with that unreserved and generous\nkindness he had ever shewn her.\n\nLady Westhaven, with the truest pleasure, again embraced the friend of\nher heart; and with delight Emmeline met her; but it was soon abated by\nthe sanguine hopes she expressed that nothing would now long delay the\nhappiness of Lord Delamere.\n\n'My Emmeline,' said she, 'will now be indeed my sister! Lord Montreville\nand my mother can no longer oppose a marriage so extremely advantageous\nto their son. _She_ will forgive them for their long blindness; and\npardoning poor Delamere for the involuntary error into which he was\nforced, will constitute the happiness of him and of his family.'\n\nTo this, Emmeline could only answer that she had not the least intention\nof marrying. Lady Westhaven laughed at that assertion. And she foresaw a\npersecution preparing for her, on behalf of Delamere, which was likely\nto give her greater uneasiness than she had yet suffered from any event\nof her life.\n\nLord Westhaven, as soon as they grew a little composed, took an\nopportunity of leaving the rest of the party; and went into his dressing\nroom, where he sent for Emmeline.\n\n'Well, my lovely cousin,' said he, when she was seated, 'I have seen\nLord Montreville on your business. I cannot say that his Lordship\nreceived me with pleasure. But some allowances must be made for a man\nwho loves money, on finding himself obliged to relinquish so large an\nestate, and to refund so large a sum as he holds of yours.'\n\n'I hope, however, you, my Lord, have had no dispute on my account with\nthe Marquis?'\n\n'Oh! none in the world. What he _thought_, I had no business to enquire;\nwhat he said, was not much; as he committed the arguments against you to\nSir Richard Crofts, who talked very long, and, as far as I know, very\nlearnedly. He spoke like a lawyer and a politician. I cut the matter\nshort, by telling him that I should attend to nothing but from an honest\nman and a gentleman.'\n\n'That was severe, my Lord.'\n\n'Oh! he did not feel it. Wrapped in his own self-sufficiency, and too\nrich to recollect the necessity of being honest, he still persisted in\ntrying to persuade me that nothing should be done in regard to restoring\nyour estate 'till all the deeds had been examined; as he had his doubts\nwhether, allowing your father's marriage to be established, great part\nof the landed property is not entailed on the heirs male. In short, he\nonly seemed desirous of gaining time and giving trouble. But the first,\nI was determined not to allow him; and to shorten the second, I took Mr.\nNewton with me the next day, and desired Sir Richard, if he could prove\nany entail, to produce his proofs. For that, he had an evasion ready--he\nhad not had _time_ to examine the deeds; which I find are all in his\nhands. _We_, however, were better prepared. Mr. Newton produced the\npapers that authenticate your birth; he offered to bring a witness who\nwas present when Mr. Mowbray was married to Miss Stavordale; nay even\nthe clergyman who performed the ceremony at Paris, and who is found to\nbe actually living in Westmoreland. The hand writing of your father is\neasily proved; and Mr. Newton, summing up briefly all the corroborating\ntestimonies that exist of your right to the Mowbray estate, concluded by\ntelling Lord Montreville, that at the end of two days he should wait\nupon his Lordship for his determination, whether he would dispute it in\na court of law or settle it amicably with me on behalf of his niece.\nNewton then left us; and I desired your uncle to allow me a few moments\nprivate conversation; which, as he could not refuse it, obliged old\nCrofts, and that formal blockhead his son, to leave us alone together. I\nthen represented to him how greatly his character must suffer should the\naffair become public. That tho' I believed myself he was really ignorant\nof the circumstances which gave you, from the moment of your father's\ndeath, an undoubted claim to the whole of his fortune, yet that the\nworld will not believe it; but will consider him as a man so cruelly\ninsatiable, so shamefully unjust, as to take advantage of a defenceless\norphan to accumulate riches he did not want, and had no right to enjoy.\nI added, that if notwithstanding he chose to go into court, he must\nexcuse me if I forgot the near connection I had with him, and appeared\npublicly as the assertor of your claim, and of course as his enemy.\n\n'The Marquis seemed very much hurt at the peremptory style in which I\nthought myself obliged to speak. He declined giving any positive answer;\nsaying, only, that he must consult his wife and his son. What the former\nsaid, I know not; but the latter, generous in his nature, and adoring\n_you_, protested to his father that he would himself, as your next\nnearest relation, join in the suit against him, if the estate was not\nimmediately given up. This spirited resolution of Lord Delamere, and the\nopinions of several eminent lawyers whom Sir Richard was sent to\nconsult, at length brought Lord Montreville to a resolution before the\nexpiration of the two days; and last night I received a letter from him,\nto say that he would, on Monday next, account with you, and put you in\npossession of your estate; the management of which, however, and the\ncare of your person, he should reserve to himself 'till you were of\nage.'\n\n'Good God!' exclaimed Emmeline; trembling, 'am I to meet my uncle on\nMonday on this business?'\n\n'Yes; and wherefore are you terrified?'\n\n'At the idea of his anger--his hatred; and of being compelled to live\nwith the Marchioness, who always disliked me, and now must detest me.'\n\nLord Westhaven then assured her that he would be there to support her\nspirits. That her uncle, whatever might be his feelings, would not\nexpress them by rudeness and asperity; but would more probably be\ndesirous of shewing kindness and seeking reconciliation. Yet that it was\nimprobable he should propose her residing with Lady Montreville; 'whose\npresent state of health,' said he, 'makes her incapable of leaving her\nroom, and for whose life the most serious apprehensions are entertained\nby her physicians.'\n\nEmmeline, thus reassured by Lord Westhaven on that subject, and\nextremely glad to hear there would be no necessity for proceedings at\nlaw against her uncle, returned with some chearfulness to the company;\nwhere it was not encreased by the entrance of Lord Delamere, which\nhappened soon afterwards.\n\nThe very ill state of health indicated by his appearance, extremely hurt\nher. Nor was she less affected by his address to her, so expressive of\nthe deepest anguish and regret. She could not bear to receive him with\nhaughtiness and coldness; but mildly, and with smiles, returned the\nquestions he put to her on common subjects. His chagrin seemed to wear\noff; and hope, which Emmeline as little wished to give, again reanimated\nin some degree his melancholy countenance.\n\nThe next day, and again the next, he came to Lord Westhaven's; but\nEmmeline cautiously avoided any conversation with him to which the whole\ncompany were not witnesses. Godolphin too was there: her behaviour to\nhim was the same; and she would suffer neither to treat her with any\ndegree of particularity. Godolphin, who knew her reason for being\nreserved towards _him_, was content; and Delamere, who suspected not how\ndangerous a rival he had, was compelled to remain on the footing only of\na relation; still hoping that time and perseverance might restore him to\nthe happiness he had lost.\n\nMonday now arrived, and Emmeline was to wait on her uncle in\nBerkley-square. At twelve o'clock Lord Westhaven was ready. Emmeline was\nled by him into the coach. They took up Mr. Newton in Lincolns-inn; and\nthen went to their rendezvous. Emmeline trembled as Lord Westhaven took\nher up stairs: she remembered the terror she had once before suffered in\nthe same house; and when she entered the drawing-room, could hardly\nsupport herself.\n\nThe Marquis, Sir Richard Crofts, his eldest son, and Lord Delamere, with\ntwo stewards and a lawyer, were already there. Lord Montreville coldly\nand gravely returned his niece's compliments; Sir Richard malignantly\neyed her from the corners of his eyes, obscured by fat; and Crofts put\non a look of pompous sagacity and consequential knowledge; while Lord\nDelamere, who would willingly have parted with the whole of his paternal\nfortune rather than with her, seemed eager only to see a business\nconcluded by which she was to receive benefit.\n\nThe lawyer in a set speech opened the business, and expatiated largely\non Lord Montreville's great generosity.\n\nLord Westhaven looked over the accounts: they appeared to have been made\nout right. The title deeds of the estate were then produced; the usual\nforms gone thro'; and papers signed, which put Emmeline in possession of\nthem. All passed with much silence and solemnity: Lord Montreville said\nvery little; and ineffectually struggled to conceal the extreme\nreluctance with which he made this resignation. When the business was\ncompleted, Emmeline advanced to kiss the hand of her uncle: he saluted\nher; but without any appearance of affection; and coldly enquired how\nshe intended to dispose of herself?\n\n'I propose, my Lord, wholly to refer myself to your Lordship as to my\npresent residence, or any other part of my conduct in which you will\nhonour me with your advice.'\n\n'I am sorry, Miss Mowbray, that the ill state of health of the\nMarchioness prevents my having the pleasure of your company here.\nHowever my daughter, Lady Westhaven, will of course be happy to have you\nremain with her till you have fixed on some plan of life, or till you\nare of age.'\n\n'Not only till Miss Mowbray is of age, my Lord, but ever, both Lady\nWesthaven and myself should be gratified by having her with us,' said\nLord Westhaven.\n\nTo this no answer was given; and a long silence ensued.\n\nEmmeline felt distressed; and at length said--'I believe, my Lord, Lady\nWesthaven will expect us.'\n\nThey then rose; and taking a formal leave of the Marquis, were allowed\nto leave the room. Lord Delamere, however, took Emmeline's hand, and as\nhe led her to the coach implored her to indulge him with one moment's\nconversation at any hour when they might not be interrupted. But with\ngreat firmness, yet with great sweetness, she told him that she must be\nforgiven if she adhered to a resolution she had made to give no audience\non the topic he wished to speak upon, for many months to come.\n\n'Almost two years!' exclaimed he--'almost two long years must I wait,\nwithout knowing whether, at the end of that time, you will hear and pity\nme! Ah! can you, Emmeline, persist in such cruelty?'\n\n'A good morning to your Lordship,' said she, as she got into the coach.\n\n'Will you dine with us, Delamere?' asked Lord Westhaven.\n\n'Yes; and will go home with you now, and dress in Grosvenor street.' He\nthen gave some orders to his servants, and stepped into the coach.\n\n'I never was less disposed in my life,' said he, 'to rejoin a party,\nthan I am to go back to those grave personages up stairs: it is with the\nutmost difficulty I command my temper to meet those Crofts' on the most\nnecessary business. My blood boils, my soul recoils at them!'\n\n'Pooh, pooh!' cried Lord Westhaven, 'you are always taking unreasonable\naversions. Your blood is always boiling at some body or other. I tell\nyou, the Crofts' are good necessary, plodding people. Not too refined,\nperhaps, in points of honour, nor too strict in those of honesty; but\nexcellent at the main chance, as you may see by what they have done for\nthemselves.'\n\nDelamere then uttered against them a dreadful execration, and went on to\ndescribe the whole family with great severity and with great truth,\n'till he at length talked himself into a violent passion; and Lord\nWesthaven with difficulty brought him to be calm by the time they had\nset down Mr. Newton and stopped at his own door. At the same instant\nLord Westhaven's coach arrived there, a splendid chariot, most elegantly\ndecorated, came up also. Delamere, struck with its brilliancy, examined\nthe arms and saw his own: looking into it, he changed countenance, and\nsaid to Lord Westhaven--'Upon my word! Crofts' wife and your Swiss\nrelation, de Bellozane!'\n\n'Crofts' wife?'\n\n'Aye. I mean the woman who was once Fanny Delamere, my sister.'\n\n'Come, Delamere, forget these heartburnings, and remember that she is\nyour sister still.'\n\n'I should be glad to know (if it were worth my while to enquire) what\nbusiness Bellozane has with _her_?'\n\nBy this time they were in the house, where Lady Frances and the\nChevalier arrived also.\n\nLord Westhaven met them with his usual politeness; but Delamere only\nslightly touched his hat to Bellozane, and sternly saluted his sister\nwith 'your servant, Lady Frances Crofts!' He then passed them, and went\ninto Lord Westhaven's dressing room; while her Ladyship, regardless of\nhis displeasure, and affecting the utmost gaity, talked and laughed with\nLord Westhaven as she went up stairs. Emmeline followed them, listening\nto the whispered compliments of Bellozane with great coldness; and Lady\nFrances, entering with a fashionable flounce the drawing room where her\nsister was, cried--'Well child! how are you? I beg your pardon for not\ncoming to enquire after you sooner: but I have had such crowds of\ncompany at Belleville Lodge, that it was impossible to escape. And\nhere's this animal here, this relation of your Lord's, really haunts me;\nso I was forced at last to bring him with me.' This speech was\naccompanied by a significant smile directed to Bellozane.\n\nLady Westhaven, checked by such an address from flying into the arms of\nher sister, now expressed, without any great warmth, that she was glad\nto see her. Something like general conversation was attempted. But Lady\nFrances, who hoped to hide, under the affectation of extravagant\nspirits, the envy and mortification with which she contemplated the\nsuperior happiness of her sister, soon engrossed the discourse entirely.\nShe talked only of men of the first rank, or of _beaux esprits_ their\nassociates, who had been down in parties to Belleville Lodge (the name\nshe had given to her villa near Richmond); and she repeated compliments\nwhich both the Lords and the wits had made to her figure and her\nunderstanding. When she seemed almost to have exhausted this interesting\ntopic, Lady Westhaven said, as if merely for the sake of saying\nsomething--'Mr. Crofts has been so obliging as to call here twice since\nwe came to London; but unluckily was not let in. Pray how does he do?'\n\n'Mr. Crofts? Oh! I know very little of him. At this time of the year we\nnever meet. _He_ lives, you know, in Burlington street, and _I_ live at\nBelleville; and if he comes thither, as he sometimes does of a Friday or\nSaturday, he finds me too much engaged to know whether he is there or\nnot. I believe, tho', he is very well; and I think the last time I saw\nhim he was nearly as lively and amusing as he usually is. Don't you\nthink he was, Bellozane?'\n\n'_O! assurement oui_,' replied the Chevalier, sneeringly, '_Monsieur\nCroff a toujours beaucoup de vivacit\u00c3\u00a9_.--_C'est un homme fort amusant ce\nMonsieur Croff._'[43]\n\nLady Westhaven, disgusted, shocked, and amazed, had no power to take any\nshare in such a dialogue; and Lady Frances went on.\n\n'Well! but now I assure you, Augusta, I'm going to be most uncommonly\ngood; and am coming, tho' 'tis a terrible heavy undertaking, to pass a\nwhole week, without company, with _mon tres cher Mari_, in\nBurlington-street. Nay, I will go still farther, and make a family party\nwith you to the play, which I generally detest of all things.'\n\n'That is being really very kind,' said Lady Westhaven. 'But since you\nare so tenderly disposed towards your own family, would it not be well\nif you were to enquire after my mother? You know, I suppose, how very\nill she is; how much worse 'tis feared she may be?'\n\n'Yes, I shall certainly call,' replied Lady Frances with the utmost\n_sang froid_, 'before I go home. But as to her illness, you are\nfrightened at nothing: she has only her old complaints.'\n\n'Her old complaints! And are not they enough? If _I_ were in a situation\nto be useful to her; or even as it is, if Lord Westhaven would permit\nme, I should certainly think it my duty constantly to attend her.'\n\n'Probably you might. And it is equally probable that it would be of no\nuse if you did. She has Brackley, and all her own people about her; and\nno more _could_ be done for her, even tho' you were to hazard your\n_precious_ life, or if _I_, (who you know would not risk by it that of\nan heir to an Earldom) should sacrifice _my_ ease and _my_ friends to\nattend her.'\n\nThe unfeeling malignity of this speech was so extremely distressing to\nLady Westhaven, that she could hardly command her tears.\n\nLord Westhaven saw her emotion, and said, 'Augusta, my love, your sister\nis too brilliant for you. You have not acquired that last polish of high\nlife, which quite effaces all other feelings; nor will you, perhaps,\never arrive at it.'\n\n'God forbid that I ever should!' cried Lady Westhaven, unable to conceal\nher indignation.\n\n'Poor thing!' said Lady Frances, with the most unblushing\nassurance--'You have curious ideas of domestic felicity: and it's a\nthousand pities, that instead of being what you are, destiny had not\nmade you the snug, notable wife of a country parson, with three or four\nhundred a year--You would have been pure and happy, to drive about in a\none horse chaise, make custards, walk tame about the house, and bring\nthe good man a baby every year: but really, you are now quite out of\nyour element.' She then rang the bell for her carriage; which being soon\nready, she gaily wished her sister good day, and the Chevalier handed\nher down stairs; where, as she descended, she said, loud enough to be\nheard, '_S'il y'a une chose au monde que je deteste plus qu'un notre,\nc'est la tristesse d'une societ\u00c3\u00a9 comme cela_.'[44] The Chevalier assented\nwith his lips; but his heart and his wishes were fled towards Emmeline.\nHe was, however, so engaged with her proud and insolent rival, that he\nno longer dared openly to avow his predilection for her: and Lady\nFrances seemed so sure of the strength of that attachment which was her\ndisgrace, that she brought him on purpose where Emmeline was, to shew\nhow little she apprehended his defection.\n\nLord Westhaven, after pausing a second, ran down stairs after them; and\njust as Bellozane was stepping into the chariot, took him by the arm,\nand begged to speak to him for two minutes.\n\nHe apologized to Lady Frances, and they went together into a room; where\nLord Westhaven, with all the warmth which his relationship authorized,\nremonstrated against his stay in England; represented the expence and\nuneasiness it must occasion to the good old Baron; and above all,\nexhorted him to fly immediately from the dangerous society of Lady\nFrances Crofts.\n\nBellozane received this advice from his cousin with a very ill grace. He\nsaid, that he could not discover why his Lordship assumed an authority\nover him, or pretended either to blame his past conduct or dictate his\nfuture. That he came to England a stranger; brought thither by his\nhonourable passion for Miss Mowbray, which he had a right to pursue; but\nthat Mr. Godolphin, who was his only relation then in England, had\neither from accident or design shewn him very little attention; while\nLady Frances had, with the most winning _honetet\u00c3\u00a9_, invited him to her\nhouse, and supplied the want of _that_ hospitality which his own family\nhad not afforded him. And that infinitely obliged as he was to her, he\nshould ill brook any reflection on a woman of honour who was his friend.\n\n'But my Lord,' added he, 'if your Lordship will allow me to visit here\nas Miss Mowbray's favoured lover, I will not only drop the acquaintance\nof Lady Frances, but will put myself entirely under your Lordship's\ndirection.'\n\nLord Westhaven, piqued and provoked, answered--'that he had no power\nwhatever to direct Miss Mowbray; and if he had, should never advise her\nto receive him. Be assured, Monsieur le Chevalier, that you have no\nchance of ever being acceptable to her, and you must think no more of\nher.'\n\nBellozane, equally impatient of advice and contradiction, burst from\nhim; and went back to Lady Frances in a very ill humour.\n\nDelamere, who had been dressing while his eldest sister remained, now\njoined Lady Westhaven and Emmeline in the drawing room. Thither also\ncame Lady Adelina; who, during the five days they had been in town had\nnot been well enough till this day to dine below.\n\nShe was now languid and faint, and obliged to retire, as soon as the\ncloth was removed, to her own room. Emmeline attended her; and when they\nwere alone together, she complained of finding herself every day more\nindisposed. 'The air of London,' said she, 'is not good for my child: I\ncannot help fancying he droops already. And the noise of a house where\nthere are unavoidably so many visitors, and such a multitude of\nservants, is too much for my spirits. As Lord Westhaven is desirous of\nmy staying in London till my sister Clancarryl arrives, that we may meet\nall together after being so many years divided, I will not press my\nreturn to East Cliff; but I wish he would allow me to go to some village\nnear London, where I may occasionally enjoy solitude and silence; for I\nhave that upon my heart, Emmeline, that demands both.'\n\nEmmeline communicated her wish to Godolphin the same evening; who\nundertook to settle it with Lord Westhaven as his sister desired; and\nthe next day Lady Adelina and her little boy removed to Highgate, where\nher brother had procured her a handsome lodging; and he, quitting those\nhe usually occupied in town, went to reside with her.\n\nAfter having been there a few days, she sent to Emmeline the following\nletter, which she desired might be delivered by her own hand.\n\n\n  '_To the Honourable George Fitz-Edward._\n\n    'I have thus long forborne to answer your letter, because I have\n  not 'till now been able to collect that strength of mind which is\n  necessary, when I am to obey the inexorable duty that tears me from\n  you for ever!\n\n    'That you yet _love_ me well enough to solicit my hand, is I own\n  most soothing and consolatory: but where, Fitz-Edward, is the\n  Lethean cup, without which you cannot _esteem_ me?--without which, I\n  cannot esteem myself? No! I am not worthy the honour of being your\n  wife! It is fit my fault be punished--punished by the cruel\n  obligation it lays me under of renouncing the man I love!\n\n    'Fitz-Edward, I will not dissemble! I cannot, if I would! My\n  affection for you is become a part of my existence, and can end\n  but in the grave. Under the dread of your infidelity or your\n  danger, my reason was too weak to support me: now that I have no\n  longer any apprehensions of either, my reason is returned--it is\n  returned to shew me all my wretchedness, and to afford me that\n  light by which I must plunge a dagger into my own bosom.\n\n    'Had I, however, no objections on my own account, there is one\n  that on another appears insuperable. Were the marriage you solicit\n  to take place, and to be followed by a family, could I bear that my\n  William, the delight and support of my life, should be as an alien\n  in his father's house, and either appear as the son of Godolphin or\n  learn to blush for his mother!\n\n    'We must part, Fitz-Edward! Indeed we must! Or if we are obliged\n  to meet, do you at least forget that we ever met before.\n\n    'I know that the daughter of Lord Westhaven, in youth, beauty, and\n  innocence, would not have been, however portionless, unworthy of\n  you. But what would you receive in the widow of Trelawny? A mind\n  unsettled by guilt and sorrow; spirits which have lost all relish\n  for felicity; a blemished, if not a ruined reputation, a faded\n  person, and an exhausted heart--exhausted of almost every sentiment\n  but that so fatally predominant; which now forces me to blot my\n  paper with tears, as I write this last farewel!\n\n    'Farewel! most beloved Fitz-Edward!--Ah! try if it be possible to\n  be happy! Be assured I wish it; even tho' it be necessary for that\n  end to drive from your memory, for ever, the lost\n\n                                                    ADELINA TRELAWNY.'\n\n\nEmmeline, to whom this letter was sent open, could not but approve the\nsentiments it contained, while her heart bled for the pain it must have\ncost Lady Adelina, and for that which it must inflict on Fitz-Edward.\n\nWhen she had dispatched a note to his lodgings, to name an early hour\nthe next day for speaking to him, she went down into the drawing room,\nwhere a large party of company were already assembled. Emmeline, to\navoid a particular conversation with Lord Delamere, which he incessantly\nsolicited, placed herself near one of the card tables; when, at a late\nhour of the evening, dressed in the utmost exuberance of fashion,\nblazing in jewels and blooming in rouge, entered Mrs. James Crofts,\nfollowed by the two eldest of her daughters; one, drest in the character\nof Charlotte in the Sorrows of Werter; and the other, as Emma, the nut\nbrown maid. Their air and manner were adapted, as they believed, to the\nfigures of those characters as they appear in the print shops; and their\nexcessive affectation, together with the gaudy appearance of their mama,\nnearly conquered the gravity of Emmeline and of many others of the\ncompany.\n\nWhile Mrs. Crofts paid her compliments to Lady Westhaven and Emmeline,\nand gave herself all those airs which she believed put her upon an\nequality with the circle she was in, the two Misses anxiously watched\nthe impression which they concluded their charms must make on the\ngentlemen present. Their mama had told them that most likely all of them\nwere Lords, or Lords sons at least; and the girls were not without\nhopes, that among them there might be some of that species of men of\nquality, whom modern novelists describe as being in the habit of\ncarrying forcibly away, beautiful young creatures, with whom perchance\nthey become enamoured, and marrying them in despite of all opposition.\nThey longed above all things to meet with such adventures, and to be\ncarried off by a Lord, or a Baronet at least; whose letters afterwards,\nto some dear Charles or Harry, could not fail to edify the world. After\nMrs. Crofts had displayed her dress, and convinced the company of her\nbeing quite in a good style of life; and when her daughters had\ncommitted hostilities for near an hour upon the hearts of the gentlemen,\nthey sailed out in the same state as they entered; nor could all\nEmmeline's good humour prevent her smiling at the satyrical remarks made\non them by some of the company; nothing more strongly exciting the\nridicule and contempt of people of real fashion than awkward and\nimpotent efforts to imitate them.\n\nThe next day, Fitz-Edward attended at the hour Emmeline appointed, and\nreceived from her the letter of Lady Adelina, with a degree of anguish\nwhich gave great pain to Emmeline and Godolphin. Still, however, he was\nnot quite deprived of hope; but flattered himself that the persuasions\nof her sister, Lady Clancarryl (who was now every day expected, with her\nhusband and family, to pass the rest of the winter in London) added to\nthose of Lord Westhaven, and the good offices of Emmeline, would\ntogether prevail on Lady Adelina to alter a resolution which rendered\nthem both wretched.\n\nSome weeks, however, passed, and she still adhered to it; while the\nmelancholy conversation which Emmeline frequently had with Fitz-Edward,\nand the importunity and unhappiness of Delamere, deprived her of much of\nthat tranquillity she might otherwise have enjoyed; particularly after\nthe recovery of Lady Westhaven (who presented her Lord with a son), and\nthe arrival of Mrs. Stafford and her family from France.\n\nLord Westhaven, who held a promise particularly sacred when made to the\nunfortunate, had procured for Mr. Stafford a lucrative employment in the\nWest Indies. Thither he immediately went; and his wife, whose spirits\nand health were greatly hurt, was happy to accept the offer Emmeline\nmade her of going down with her children to Mowbray Castle. The Marquis\nof Montreville had presented his niece with the furniture he had sent\nthither, being in truth ashamed to charge it; there was therefore every\nthing necessary; and there Emmeline intended Mrs. Stafford should reside\n'till she should be established in some residence agreeable to her;\nwhich she intended to fix if possible near her own; and she now felt all\nthe advantages of that fortune, which enabled her to repay the\nobligations she owed to her earliest friend.\n\n[Footnote 43: Oh! certainly, Mr. Crofts is always very sprightly. A most\nentertaining personage.]\n\n[Footnote 44: If there is any thing in the world I utterly detest, 'tis\nsuch dismal society as that.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nThe rank, and extensive connections of Lady Westhaven, led her\nunavoidably into a good deal of company; but it was among persons as\nrespectable for their virtues as their station. Emmeline, of course,\noften accompanied her: but almost all her mornings, and frequently her\nevenings, were dedicated to Lady Adelina; who hardly saw any body but\nher, Lady Westhaven, her brothers, and her sister; and never went out\nbut for the air.\n\nGodolphin passed with her much of his time: to the love and pity he had\nbefore felt for her, was added veneration and esteem, excited by the\nheroism of her conduct. At her lodgings, too, he could see Emmeline\nwithout the restraint they were under in other places. There, he could\ntalk to her of his love; and there, she consented to hear him.\n\nLady Westhaven went constantly every morning to visit her mother, who\nhad lately been rather better, and whose health her physicians\nentertained some hopes of re-establishing. Her own unhappy temper seemed\nto be the chief impediment to her recovery; her violent passions,\nunsubdued by sickness and disappointment; and her immeasurable pride,\nwhich even the approach of death could not conquer, kept her nerves\ncontinually on the stretch; and allowed her no repose of mind, even when\nher bodily sufferings were suspended. That her favourite project of\nuniting the only surviving branches of her own family, by the marriage\nof Lord Delamere and Miss Otley, was now for ever at an end, was a\nperpetual source of murmuring and discontent. And tho' Emmeline had as\nsplendid a fortune, with a person and a mind infinitely more lovely, her\nLadyship could not yet prevail upon herself to desire, that the name for\nwhich she felt such proud veneration, and the fortune of her own\nillustrious ancestors, should be enjoyed, or carried down to posterity\nby her, who had become the object of her capricious but inveterate\ndislike.\n\nEmmeline was very glad that the Marchioness thro' prejudice, and her\nuncle thro' shame, forbore to persecute her in favour of their son: but\ntho' perfectly aware of the antipathy Lady Montreville entertained\ntowards her, she yet shewed her all the attention she would receive; and\nwould even constantly have waited on her, had she not expressed more\npain than pleasure in her presence.\n\nLady Frances Crofts, by this time fixed in Burlington street for the\nwinter, called now and then on her mother; but her visits were short and\ncold. It unfortunately happened, that the Marchioness, whose amusement\nwas now almost solely confined to reading the daily prints, had found in\none of them a paragraph evidently pointed at the intimacy subsisting\nbetween Lady Frances and the Chevalier de Bellozane, which had long been\nthe topic of public scandal.\n\nLady Frances called upon her while her mind was under the first\nimpression of this disgraceful circumstance; and she spoke to her\ndaughter of her improper attachment to that young foreigner with more\nthan her usual severity. Lady Frances, far from hearing her remonstrance\nwith calmness, retorted, with rudeness and asperity, what she termed\nunjust reproaches; and asserted her own right to associate with whom she\npleased. The Marchioness grew more enraged, and they parted in great\nwrath: in consequence of which, Lady Montreville, in the inconsiderate\nexcess of her anger, sent for her husband and her son; and exclaiming\nwith all her natural acrimony against the shameful conduct of Lady\nFrances, insisted upon their obliging Crofts to separate his wife from\nher dangerous and improper acquaintance, and forcing her immediately\ninto the country.\n\nLord Montreville, who had already heard too much of his daughter's\ngeneral light conduct, and her particular partiality to Bellozane, now\nsaw new evils gathering round him, from which he knew not how to escape.\nThe fiery and impatient Delamere, already irritated against Bellozane\nfor his pretensions to Emmeline, broke forth in menace and invective;\nand nothing but his father's anguish, and even tears, prevented his\nflying directly to him to execute that vengeance which his mother had\ndictated. She herself, in the violence of her passion, had overlooked\nthe consequence of putting this affair into the hands of the\ninconsiderate and headlong Delamere; but when she saw him thus inflamed,\nterror for _him_, was added to resentment against her daughter; and\naltogether produced such an effect on her broken constitution, that in a\nfew days afterwards her complaints returned with great violence, and all\nremedies proving ineffectual, she expired in less than a fortnight. Lady\nWesthaven and Emmeline attended on her themselves for the last four or\nfive days; but she was insensible; and knew neither of them. Delamere,\nvery fond of his mother, and whose feelings were painfully acute,\nsuffered for many days the most violent paroxysms of grief; yet it was a\nconsiderable alleviation to reflect that he had not finally been the\ncause of her death. Lord Montreville bore it with more composure: and\nthe softer, tho' deep sorrow of Lady Westhaven, found relief in the\nconstant and tender attention of her Lord, and the sympathy of Emmeline.\n\nLady Frances Crofts, not insensible to remorse, but resolutely stifling\nit, affected to hear the news with proper concern, yet as what had been\nfor many months expected. She sent constantly to enquire after her\nfather; and the Marquis hoping that while her mind was softened by such\na mournful event his remonstrance might make a deeper impression,\ndetermined to go to her; therefore the day after the remains of the\nMarchioness had been carried to the family vault of the Delameres, he\ntook his chair, and went to Burlington street.\n\nOn entering the house, the servants, who concluded he came to Mr.\nCrofts, were taking him into those apartments below which their master\noccupied: but his Lordship told them he must speak to their lady. Her\nown footman said her Ladyship had given orders to be denied.\n\n'To her father, puppy?'--said Lord Montreville. 'Where is she?'\n\n'In her dressing room, my Lord.'\n\nHe then passed alone up stairs--As he went, he heard the voice of\nlaughter and gaiety, and was more shocked than surprised, when, on\nopening the door, he saw Lady Frances in a morning dishabille, and the\nChevalier de Bellozane making her tea. At the entrance of her father\nthus unexpectedly, she changed colour; but soon assuming her usual\nassured manner, said she was glad to see his Lordship well enough to\ncome out.\n\n'Dismiss this young man,' said he sternly. 'I must speak to you alone.'\n\n'_Va mon ami_,' cried Lady Frances, with the utmost ease, '_pour\nquelques moments_.'\n\nBellozane left the room; and then Lord Montreville, with paternal\naffection, tried to move her. But she had conquered her feelings; and\nanswered with great calmness--'That conscious of her own innocence, she\nwas quite indifferent to the opinion of the world. And that tho' she\ncertainly wished to be upon good terms with her own family, yet if any\npart of it chose to think ill of her, they must do so entirely from\nprejudice, which it was little worth her while to attempt removing.'\n\nLord Montreville, now provoked beyond all endurance, gave way to the\nindignation with which he was inflamed, and denounced his malediction\nagainst her, if she did not immediately dismiss Bellozane and regulate\nher manner of life. She heard him with the most callous insensibility;\nand let him depart without making any attempt to appease his anger or\ncalm his apprehensions. From her, he went down to Crofts; to whom he\nforcibly represented the necessity there was for putting an immediate\nstop to the scandal which the conduct of his wife occasioned.\nPusillanimous and mean-spirited, Crofts chose neither to risk his\npersonal safety with the Chevalier, nor the diminution of his fortune by\nattempting to procure a divorce, which would compel him to return what\nhe loved much better than honour.\n\nHe saw many others do extremely well, and mightily respected, whose\nwives were yet gayer than his own; and convinced that while he had money\nhe should always obtain as much regard as he desired, he rather excused\nto Lord Montreville the conduct of Lady Frances than shewed any\ndisposition to resent it. The Marquis left him with contempt, and\nordered his chair to Lord Westhaven's. As he went, he could not forbear\nreflecting on the contrast between his eldest and youngest daughter, and\nbetween his eldest daughter and his niece. He grew extremely anxious for\nLord Delamere's marriage with Emmeline: sure of finding, in her, an\nhonour to his family, which might console him for his present\nmisfortunes: and he deeply regretted that infatuation which had blinded\nhim to her superior merit, and hazarded losing her for ever. Disgusted\nalready with the Crofts, he remembered that it had been in a great\nmeasure owing to them, and he thought of them only with repentance and\ndislike.\n\nHe saw Lord Westhaven alone; and relating to him all that had passed\nthat morning, besought him to consider what could be done to divide\nBellozane from Lady Frances Crofts.\n\nLord Westhaven had seen and heard too much of the intimacy between them.\nHe was extremely hurt that so near a relation of his own should occasion\nsuch uneasiness in the family of his wife; but as he had not invited him\nover, and always discouraged his stay, he had on that head nothing with\nwhich to reproach himself. And all he could now do, was, to promise that\nhe would speak again to Bellozane, and write to the Baron de St. Alpin,\nentreating him to press the return of his son to Switzerland. His\nLordship entered warmly into the apprehensions of Lord Montreville; and\nundertook to use all his influence with Delamere to prevent his running\nrashly into a quarrel with a young man as passionate and as violent as\nhimself.\n\nLord Montreville then spoke of Emmeline; and expressed his wishes that\nthe union between her and his son might speedily be accomplished: but on\nthis subject Lord Westhaven gave him very little hopes. Tho' Emmeline\nhad done her utmost to conceal even from Lord and Lady Westhaven the\ntrue state of her heart, his Lordship had, in their frequent conferences\non her affairs, clearly perceived what were her sentiments. But since\nthey were in favour of his brother, he could not think of attempting to\nalter them, however sorry for Delamere; and could only determine to\nobserve an absolute neutrality.\n\nHe did not communicate to the Marquis all he thought, but told him in\ngeneral, that Emmeline seemed at present averse to every proposal of\nmarriage, and firm in the resolution she had made, to remain single\n'till she had completed her twenty-first year. Lord Westhaven sent for\nBellozane; who had lately been less frequent in his visits at\nGrosvenor-street, and who seemed to resent the coldness with which his\ncousins received him, and to have conceived great anger at the reserve\nand even aversion with which Emmeline treated him. The servant whom his\nLordship dispatched with a note to Bellozane, returned in about ten\nminutes, and said that the Chevalier was gone to Bath. Lord Westhaven\nnow hoped that for some time the intercourse which had given such\noffence, and occasioned such misery, would be at an end: in the\nafternoon, however, Crofts came in; and on Lady Westhaven's enquiry\nafter her sister, he told her that she was going that afternoon to\nSpeenhamland in her way to Bath. Conduct, so glaringly improper and\nunfeeling, a defiance so bold to the opinions of the world and the\ncommon decencies of society, extremely hurt both her Ladyship and her\nLord. The latter, however, found some satisfaction in reflecting that at\nleast Delamere and Bellozane could not immediately meet.\n\nAbove a month now passed with as much tranquillity as the ardent\nsupplications of Delamere to Emmeline would admit. Lord and Lady\nClancarryl, with their family, arrived in London to pass the rest of the\nwinter; and Lady Adelina, insensibly won from her retirement by the\npleasure of meeting at once her sister and her two brothers, seemed to\nbe in better health, and sometimes in better spirits. As she was now\nfrequently induced to join these charming family parties, she was\nobliged to see Fitz-Edward among them; and he entertained new hopes that\nshe would at length conquer her scruples and accept his hand: she\ncarefully, however, avoided all conversation with him but in mixed\ncompany; and Emmeline being continually with her, they were equally\nprevented from hearing, with any degree of particularity, Godolphin or\nFitz-Edward.\n\nThe Marchioness of Montreville had now been dead almost two months; and\nLady Westhaven, who from respect to her memory had hitherto forborne to\nappear in public, was prevailed upon to go to a new play; for the author\nof which, a nobleman, one of her friends, being particularly interested,\nhe prevailed on all the people of fashion and taste whom he knew to\nattend on the third night of it's representation. Lady Westhaven, Lady\nClancarryl, and Emmeline, were by his earnest entreaties induced to be\namong them: but as Lord Westhaven, Lord Clancarryl, Godolphin, and\nFitz-Edward, were absent, being gone all together to the seat of the\nformer, in Kent, for a few days, they foresaw but little pleasure in the\nparty; and Lady Westhaven expressed even a reluctance for which she knew\nnot how to account. The eagerness of Lord----to serve his friend at\nlength over-ruled her objections; his Lordship himself and Lord Delamere\nwere to attend them; and they were to be joined by some other ladies\nthere. The stage box had been retained for them; and they proceeded to\nthe playhouse, where they were hardly seated, before Lady Westhaven saw,\nwith infinite mortification and alarm, her sister, Lady Frances Crofts,\nenter the next box, handed by the Chevalier de Bellozane, and\naccompanied by a lady, of fashion indeed, but of very equivocal\ncharacter, with whom she had lately contracted a great intimacy. All\nattention to the play was now at an end. Incapable of receiving\namusement, Lady Westhaven would instantly have returned home; and\nEmmeline, who saw rage and fierceness in the countenance of Lord\nDelamere, was equally anxious to do so: but they knew not how to account\nfor such a wish to their party without making their fears public; and\nwhile they deliberated how to act, the play went on. Lady Frances, as if\nquite unconscious of any impropriety in her conduct, spoke to them and\nto Delamere. They forced themselves to answer her with civility; but her\nbrother, turning from her, darted an angry look at Bellozane, and went\nto the other side of the house. He from thence watched with indignation\nthe familiar whispers which passed between her and the Chevalier; and\nreflecting on the recent death of his mother, which had been hastened if\nnot occasioned by this connection; remembering how greatly the\nsufferings of her last hours had been embittered by it, and recalling to\nhis memory a thousand other causes of anger against Bellozane, he heated\nhis imagination with the review of these injuries, till he raised\nhimself into an agony of passion, which it was soon impossible for him,\nhad he been so disposed, to restrain.\n\nA very few minutes after the play ended, Lady Westhaven, impatient to\nget away before her sister, beckoned to Delamere; and finding her\nservants ready, told her party she was too much tired to stay the\nentertainment, and rose with Emmeline to go. Lord----led her Ladyship,\nand Delamere took the hand of Emmeline: the two former walked hastily\nthro' the lobby; but as the two latter followed, they were suddenly\nstopped by Rochely, who, making one of his solemn bows, advanced close\nto Emmeline, and with great composure congratulated her in his usual\nslow and monotonous manner, on her late acquisitions; assured her of his\ngreat respect and esteem; and added, that as he understood she would,\nwhen she came of age, be possessed of a large sum of money, he flattered\nhimself she would allow him to manage it for her, as Lord Montreville at\npresent did; declaring that nobody could be more attentive to the\ninterest of his customers. The profound gravity with which, in such a\nplace, he made such a request; the sordid meanness of spirit, which\ncould induce a man already so very rich, to solicit custom with the\navidity of a mechanic beginning business; and the uncouth and formal\nfigure of the person himself; would have excited in Emmeline ridicule as\nwell as contempt, at any other time: but now, distrest at the delay this\nmeeting occasioned, she hurried over some answer, she hardly knew what,\nand hastened towards the door. Just, however, before they reached it,\nBellozane, with Lady Frances Crofts hanging on his arm, overtook and\npassed them: the Chevalier slightly touched his hat to Emmeline; and\nLady Frances, nodding familiarly, said--'Good night! good night!' Lady\nFrances and Bellozane went on; and Emmeline, who saw fury in the eyes of\nDelamere, now wished as much to linger behind as she had before done to\nhurry forward. But Delamere quickening his pace, overtook them as they\ndescended the steps, and rushed so closely and with so much intended\nrudeness by Bellozane, that it was with the utmost difficulty he could\navoid falling and dragging his fair associate with him. The fiery\nFrenchman recovering his footing, turned fiercely to Delamere, and\nasked, in French, what he meant? Lord Delamere, in the same language,\nreplied, that he meant to tell him he was a scoundrel! Instantly a\nmutual blow was exchanged: the shrieks of Emmeline brought the\nsentinels; who, together with the croud which immediately gathered,\nforced them from each other.\n\nLord----who had taken care of Lady Westhaven to her coach, alarmed at\nEmmeline's not joining them, and at the noise he heard, now came back to\nsee what was the matter. He met her, more dead than alive, coming\ntowards him, attended by a stranger; and she had just breath enough to\nimplore him not to think of _her_, but to find Lord Delamere, and try to\nprevent the fatal consequence of what had just happened.\n\nLeaving her to the care of the gentleman he had found her with, who\nalmost supported her to the coach, his Lordship went forward in quest\nof Delamere, whom he met with two or three other gentlemen. Bellozane,\nafter stating to them the affront he had received, and giving Lord\nDelamere a card, had returned back into the lobby with Lady Frances and\nher friend; from whence it was supposed he had gone out with them across\nthe stage, as Lady Frances appeared in great alarm. Lord----now\nentreated Delamere to go with him to the coach, where he told him his\nsister was in the utmost terror for his safety. But enquiring eagerly\nwhether Miss Mowbray was safe with her, and hearing she was, he said he\nwould be in Grosvenor-street to supper, and desired they would go home.\nLord----then very warmly remonstrated on the cruelty of terrifying his\nsister, and insisted on his going with him to the coach: but they were\nby this time among the croud at the door, where people began to go out\nfast; and Delamere, whose passions were now inflamed to a degree of\nmadness, broke violently away from his Lordship; and rushing into the\nstreet, instantly disappeared. Every attempt which himself, his\nservants, or some gentlemen who were witnesses to the transaction, made\nto find him, being ineffectual, Lord----now returned to the coach,\nwhere Lady Westhaven was fainting in the arms of Emmeline; who, equally\nalarmed, and hardly able to support herself, was trying to assist and\nconsole her. Lord----, instead of returning to his own family, now sent\na footman to desire they would go home without him; and remaining in\nLady Westhaven's carriage, directed it to be driven with the utmost\nspeed to Grosvenor street. As they went, he attempted to appease the\nagonizing fears of them both, by persuading them that they might find\nLord Delamere at home before them; but they knew too well the ferocity\nwith which he was capable of pursuing his vengeance when it was once\nawakened; and arrived at home in such disorder, that neither could\nspeak.--The coach, however, no sooner stopped than somebody ran out.\nThey had no power to ask who; but the voice was that of Godolphin; who\nfinding his brother likely to be detained two days longer, and existing\nonly while he could see Emmeline every hour, had returned alone to town,\nand now waited their arrival from the play. He was astonished at the\nsituation he found them in, as he assisted them out of the carriage. He\nreceived, however, a brief account of the cause from Lord----; while\nLady Westhaven, a little recovered by the sight of Godolphin and the\nhartshorn and water she had taken, found her voice.\n\n'For God's sake! dear Godolphin, lose not a moment, but go after my\nbrother. We dread lest he went immediately in search of Bellozane--Oh!\nfly! and endeavour to prevent the horrid effects that may be expected\nfrom their meeting!'\n\n'Pray go!' said Emmeline. 'Pray go instantly!'\n\nGodolphin needed not entreaty. He took his hat, and ran away directly,\nwithout knowing whither to go. He thought, however, that it was possible\nDelamere might go to Berkley square, and send from thence an appointment\nto Bellozane. Thither therefore he hastened; but heard that Lord\nDelamere had not been at home since he dressed to dine in Grosvenor\nstreet, and that the Marquis was gone to Lord Dornock's, where he was to\nstay some days; news, which encreased the alarm of Godolphin, who had\nhoped that his influence might be used to prevent the rashness of his\nson. He ordered Millefleur, and Delamere's coachman, footmen, and\ngrooms, to run different ways in search of their master, while he went\nhimself to the lodgings of Bellozane. Bellozane, he learnt, came from\nBath only that morning, and had dressed at his lodgings, but had not\nbeen there since.\n\nHe now flew to the house of Lady Frances Crofts. Mr. Crofts was gone\ndown to his father's; and Lady Frances, who had come from Bath the same\nday, had dined with her friend, and was to be set down by her carriage\nafter supper. Eagerly asking the name of this friend, he was directed to\nCharlotte street, Oxford street; where on hastening he found Lady\nFrances, who was vainly attempting to conquer the terrors that possessed\nher. Bellozane, he heard, had procured chairs for her and the lady with\nher, at the stage door, and had there wished them a good night, tho'\nthey had both intreated of him to go home with them. They added, that\nthey had refused to let him look for their carriage, which was driven\noff in the croud, lest he should meet with Delamere; but were greatly\nafraid he had gone back to the avenues of the playhouse with that\ndesign. Godolphin, however unpromising his search yet appeared,\ndetermined not to relinquish it. But while he continued running from\nplace to place, Lady Westhaven and Emmeline sat listening to every noise\nand terrifying themselves with conjectures the most dreadful. Almost as\nsoon as Godolphin was gone, they had conjured Lord----to go on the same\nsearch: but he returned not; and of Godolphin they heard nothing. Even\nthe late hours when fashionable parties break up, now passed by. Every\ncoach that approached made them tremble between hope and fear; but it\nrolled away to a distance. Another and another passed, and their\ndreadful suspence still continued. Emmeline would have persuaded Lady\nWesthaven to go to bed; but nothing could induce her to think of it. She\nsometimes traversed the room with hurried steps; sometimes sat listening\nat the window; and sometimes ran out to the stair case, where all the\nservants except those who had been dispatched in pursuit of Lord\nDelamere were assembled.\n\nThe streets were now quiet; the watch called a quarter past five; and\nconvinced that if something fatal had not happened some body would have\nreturned to them by this time, their terror grew insupportable. A quick\nrap was now heard at the door. Emmeline flew to the stairs--'Is it Lord\nDelamere?' 'No, Madam,' replied a servant, 'it is Captain Godolphin.'\nAfraid of asking, yet unable to bear another moment of suspence, she\nflew down part of the stairs. Godolphin, with a countenance paler than\ndeath, caught her in his arms--'Whither would you go?' cried he,\ntrembling as he spoke.\n\n'Have you found--Delamere?'\n\n'I have.'\n\n'Alive and well?'\n\n'Alive--but--'\n\n'Oh! God!--but what?'\n\n'Wounded, I fear, to death. Keep his sister from knowing it too\nsuddenly.'\n\nThat was almost impossible. Lady Westhaven had at first sat down in the\ndrawing room in that breathless agony which precluded the power of\nenquiry; then losing her weakness in desperation, she ran down,\ndetermined to know the worst, and was already on the stairs.\n\nEmmeline, white and faint, leaned on Godolphin--'Where is he, where is\nmy brother?' cried Lady Westhaven.\n\nGodolphin beckoned to the servants to assist him in getting her up\nstairs. After a moment, they were all in the drawing room.\n\n'Tell me,' cried she, with an accent and look of despair--'Tell me for I\nwill know! You have seen my brother; he is killed! I know he is killed!'\n\n'He is alive,' answered Godolphin, hardly bearing to wound her ears\nwith such intelligence as he had to deliver--'at least he _was_ alive\nwhen I left him.'\n\n'_Was_ alive! He is wounded then--and dying!'\n\n'It were useless and cruel to deceive you. I greatly fear he is.'\n\nUttering a faint shriek, Lady Westhaven now sprung towards the door, and\nprotested she would go to him wherever he was. Emmeline clung about her,\nand besought her to be patient--to be pacified.\n\n'Perhaps,' cried she, 'his situation may not be so desperate. Let us\nrather enquire what can be done for him, than indulge the extravagance\nof our own despair.'\n\n'Ah! tell me, then, where?--how?' Lady Westhaven could say no more.\nGodolphin thought it best to satisfy her.\n\n'I will not relate the first part of my search. It was fruitless. At\nlength I saw a croud before the door of the Bedford. I asked what was\nthe matter? and heard that two gentlemen had fought a duel, by\ncandlelight, with swords; that one was killed and the other had escaped.\nThis was too much like what I expected to hear: I forced my way into the\nroom. Lord Delamere was bleeding on the ground. Two surgeons were with\nhim. I cleared the room of all but them, and the necessary attendants. I\nsaw him carefully conveyed to bed. I left them with him; and came to\ntell you. Now I must hasten back to him. I will not flatter you; the\nsurgeons gave me very little--indeed no hope of his life.'\n\n'Oh! my father! my father!' exclaimed Lady Westhaven, 'what will become\nof him when he hears this?'\n\n'I would go to him,' said Godolphin, 'but that I must return to poor\nDelamere. What little he said was to request that I would stay with\nhim.'\n\n'Go then,' said Emmeline--'we must do without you. Let him not miss the\ncomfort of your presence.'\n\n'Yes,' answered he, 'I must indeed go.' Emmeline, leaving Lady Westhaven\na moment to her woman, followed him out, and he said to her--'Try, I\nconjure you, my Emmeline, to exert yourself for the sake of your poor\nfriend. Keep her as tranquil as you can; and may ye both acquire\nfortitude to bear what is, I fear, inevitable!'\n\n'Oh! my father!' loudly exclaimed Lady Westhaven, with a dreadful\nshriek--'Who shall dare to announce these tidings to you?'\n\n'Send,' continued Godolphin, 'an express to Lord Montreville. He is at\nLord Dornock's; and dispatch another to my brother. Pray take care of\nyour own health. It is now impossible for me to stay--the poor\nlanguishing Delamere expects me.' He then ran hastily away; and\nEmmeline, struggling with all her power against her own anguish, was\nobliged to commit her friend to the care of her servants, while she sat\ndown to write to Lord Montreville. Her letter contained only two lines.\n\n\n  'My dear Lord,\n\n    'Your son is very ill. We are much alarmed; and Lady Westhaven\n  begs you will immediately come hither. Do not go to Berkley-square.\n\n                                                    EMMELINE MOWBRAY.'\n  _Grosvenor-street,\n      April 5th._\n\n\nThis note, short as it was, she had the utmost difficulty to make\nlegible. A servant was sent off with it, who was ordered to answer no\nquestions; and in another short and incoherent note she told to Lord\nWesthaven the melancholy truth, and sent it by express into Kent.\n\nHaving thus obeyed Godolphin as well as she could; she returned to Lady\nWesthaven, who could not be prevailed upon to go to bed, but insisted on\nbeing allowed to see her brother. Emmeline, dreadfully terrified by her\nobstinacy, now sent for the two physicians who usually attended the\nfamily. One of them had been taken by Godolphin to Delamere; but the\nother instantly attended the summons. Every argument he could use\nfailing entirely of effect, he was obliged to administer to her a\nremedy, which soon acting on her fatigued and exhausted spirits, threw\nher for a short time into insensibility. While poor Emmeline, who\nexpected soon the arrival of the unhappy father, and who waited with\ntorturing anxiety for news from Godolphin, could not even sit down; but\nwandered about the house, and walked from room to room, as if change of\nplace could shorten or lessen her dreadful suspence.\n\nNo news, however, came from Godolphin. But a little before eight\no'clock, the Marquis's chaise stopped at the door.\n\nHe got out; asked faulteringly of the servants for his son. Their looks\nimported sad tidings; but they were ordered to profess ignorance, and it\nwas the excruciating task allotted to Emmeline to inform this wretched\nparent that his only son, the pride and support of his life, had\nfallen; and what made it still more horrid, by the hand of his\ndaughter's paramour. Lord Montreville entered the drawing room; and the\nwild and pallid looks of his niece struck him with such horror, that he\ncould only pronounce with trembling lips the name of Delamere: and then\nthrowing himself into a chair, seemed to expect she should tell him what\nhe was unable to ask.\n\nShe approached him; but words failed her.\n\n'Delamere!--my son!' cried he, in a voice hollow and tremulous.\n\n'He is not dead, my Lord.'\n\n'Not dead! wherefore is it then that you look thus? Oh! what is it I am\nto know?'\n\nEmmeline then briefly related his situation, as she had heard it from\nGodolphin. She had only said, that tho' desperately wounded he yet\nlived, when Lord Montreville, gazing on her with eyes that bespoke the\nagony of his soul, and seizing her violently by the hand, said--'Come,\nthen, with me! come to him with me, now, this instant!'\n\nHe then burst out of the room, still taking her with him. She knew not\nwhy he wished her to follow; but went, unequal to resistance or enquiry.\n\nHis chariot was at the door. They both got in, and just as it was\ndriving away, Millefleur ran up to it.\n\n'Your master?--your master?--' said Lord Montreville.\n\n'Ah! my Lord, he is--yet living!'\n\n'_Yet_ living!'\n\n'And Captain Godolphin sent me to see if you was come, in hopes that you\nmight see him.'\n\n'Go on!' cried Lord Montreville, with a degree of fierceness that made\nEmmeline shudder. The horses flew. He continued in dreadful and gloomy\nsilence, interrupted only by deep groans. Emmeline had no comfort to\noffer, and dared not speak to him. At length they arrived at the place.\nThe servants assisted their lord to leave the chariot. Just as he got\nout of it, Dr. Gardner came out; but too much shocked to be able to\nspeak, he waved his hand to say that all was over; and almost instantly,\nGodolphin, with a countenance most expressive of what he felt, came out\nto him also.\n\n'My dear Lord, your going up will be of no use; spare yourself so great\na shock, and suffer me to attend you home.'\n\n'He is dead then?'\n\nDeep and mournful silence told him it was so.\n\n'I will see him, however,' said he, pushing by those who would have\ndetained him.\n\n'No, no,' cried Emmeline. 'Pray, my Lord! pray, my dear uncle!'\n\n'Uncle!' exclaimed he. 'Have I deserved to be your uncle? But I am\npunished--dreadfully, dreadfully punished!'\n\nA croud was now gathering; and Godolphin was compelled to let him\nproceed; while he himself approached Emmeline, who was left half dead in\nthe chariot.\n\n'Ah! attend not to me!' said she. 'Go, I beg of you, with my poor\nuncle!'\n\nDreadful was the scene when the miserable father beheld the body of his\nson. In that bitter anguish which is incapable of tears, he reproached\nhimself for the obstinacy with which, even against his own judgment, he\nhad opposed his marriage with Emmeline.--'Instead of seeing thus my\nhopes blasted for ever, I might have grown old among his children and\nthe children of my brother's daughter! But I drove her to France; and in\nconsequence of that, the scourge, the dreadful scourge has fallen upon\nme! I and my house are low in the dust! Weak and wretched infatuation!\nDreadful sacrifice to vain and empty ambition; Oh! my poor murdered\nboy!' Then, after a moment's pause, he turned suddenly to Godolphin,\nwhose manly countenance was covered with tears. 'Tell me, Sir! did he\nnot wish to see his misjudging father? did he leave me nothing--not even\nhis forgiveness?'\n\n'Lord Delamere,' said Godolphin, 'was wounded in the lungs, and every\neffort to speak threatened his immediate dissolution. He expressed a\nwish to see you and Miss Mowbray; but said very little else.'\n\n'I brought her, because I knew he must wish to see her. But he will see\nher no more!' A deep and hollow groan now burst from him: his sorrow\nbegan to choak him; and exclamation was at an end; yet struggling a\nmoment with it, he said quickly to Godolphin--'Do you think he suffered\ngreat pain?'\n\n'I believe very little, my Lord.'\n\n'And he had every assistance?'\n\n'He had instantly every assistance that skill could offer. Two surgeons\nof eminence were at supper with company in the house; and they were with\nhim before I was, which was not ten minutes after the accident. I never\nleft him afterwards, but to run to Lady Westhaven.'\n\n'Excellent young man! you will still, I know, remain with him, and do\nwhat _I_ cannot do.' He then paused a moment, and his anguish seemed to\ngather strength--while with a look of deep and gloomy despair he\napproached the bed; slowly and sternly invoked the vengeance of heaven\non his eldest daughter; and then continued with glazed and motionless\neyes to gaze on the body. From this dreadful torpor it was necessary to\nrouse him, and to remove him from the room. The united efforts of\nGodolphin and the surgeons, with difficulty effected it. He was however\nat length placed in the chariot; and with Emmeline, who was more dead\nthan alive, was conveyed to Grosvenor-street. Godolphin, dreading the\nscene he was to encounter when they got thither, followed them on foot;\nand assisted Lord Montreville to his chamber, where he entreated the\nservants not to allow him to see Lady Westhaven, till they were both\nbetter able to bear the interview. He then returned to Emmeline; who,\nquite overcome by excessive terror and fatigue, had hardly strength to\nspeak to him; and unable to support herself longer, retired to bed,\nwhere a violent fever seized her; and for near a week she was so\nalarmingly ill, that Godolphin, in the wildest distraction, believed he\nsaw her snatched from him by the inexorable hands of death. Lady Adelina\ncame to her the evening after Delamere's decease, and never left her bed\nside while there was the least appearance of danger; Godolphin continued\nwhole days in the little dressing room that adjoined to it; and\nFitz-Edward, who insisted on attending him during these hours of\ntorturing suspence, was unavoidably frequently in the presence of Lady\nAdelina, whose every sentiment was for the time absorbed in her fear for\na life so dear to them all.\n\nAt length Emmeline, tho' yet too ill to leave her room, was no longer in\ndanger; and Lord Westhaven, who returned instantly to town on hearing\nthe mournful news helped to appease the violent grief of his wife. But\non the more settled and silent anguish of her wretched father, his good\noffices made not the least impression. He seemed to abhor all thoughts\nof consolation: and when the remains of poor Delamere were carried to be\ndeposited with those of his mother, he shut himself up in total\ndarkness, and refused to admit even Lady Westhaven to participate his\nsorrows. When she was allowed to pay her duty to him, he conjured her to\nkeep from him the sight of any of the Crofts', and that she would\nprevent even their name being repeated in his presence. With their\nvisits there was no danger of his Lordship's being offended; for as he\nhad, in consequence of this family calamity, resigned all the places he\nheld, Sir Richard and his two sons were already eagerly paying their\ncourt to his successor; and had entered into new views, and formed new\npolitical connections, with an avidity which made them equally forgetful\nof their patron's personal afflictions and of that favour to which they\nowed their sudden and unmerited elevation. Amidst all the misery which\nthe guilty and scandalous conduct of his wife had brought upon the\nfamily of his benefactor, the point on which Mr. Crofts felt the most\nsolicitude, was to know what portion of the Delamere estate was\nirrevocably settled in equal divisions on the daughters, if the Marquis\nof Montreville died without a son. The physicians now advised Lord\nWesthaven to carry the Marquis into the country as soon as possible;\nwhere he might enjoy the solitude he so much desired, without being\nexcluded from the air, as he was in town, by being confined entirely to\nhis bed chamber and dressing room. The sight of any of his own seats;\nplaces which he had so lavishly embellished for the residence of him who\nwas now no more, he could not yet endure; and Lord Westhaven with some\ndifficulty prevailed upon him to remove to _his_ house in Kent. Thither,\ntherefore, the Marquis and Lord Westhaven's family removed, at the end\nof a fortnight; but Emmeline, tho' pretty well recovered, desired Lady\nWesthaven not to insist on her being of the party; being convinced, that\ntho' he tried to see her with fortitude, and to behave to her with\ntenderness, the sight of her was painful to her uncle, and perpetually\nbrought to his mind his own fatal misconduct in regard to his son.\n\nLady Westhaven yielded reluctantly to her reasons, and departed without\nher: but as her health made her immediate departure from London\nnecessary, she went with Lady Adelina to Highgate; who now remained\nthere only for the purpose of taking leave of Lord and Lady Clancarryl,\nas they were within a fortnight to return to Ireland.\n\nIn this interval, they heard that Lady Frances Crofts, infatuated still\nwith her passion for Bellozane, had followed him to Paris, whither he\nhad fled after his fatal encounter with her brother. Bellozane, stung\nwith guilt, and pursued by remorse, hurried from her with detestation;\nand concealing himself in Switzerland, saw her no more. For some time\nshe continued to live in France in a style the most disgraceful to her\nfamily and herself. Nobody dared name her to her unhappy father. But\nLord Westhaven at length interposed with Crofts, who, influenced by his\nauthority, and still more by his own desire to lessen her expences, went\nover, and found no great difficulty in procuring a _lettre de cachet_,\nwhich confined her during pleasure to a convent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nTo fix some plan for her future life, Emmeline now thought absolutely\nand immediately necessary. To go to Mowbray Castle seemed the properest\nmeasure she could adopt; and on that she appeared to determine. But tho'\nshe still meant to adhere to her resolution of remaining single until\nshe became of age, the tender importunity of her lover, the pressing\nentreaties of her friends, and her own wishes to make them happy, were\nevery hour more powerfully undermining it. Her mind, softened by grief\nfor the death of poor Delamere, and more fondly attached than ever to\nthe generous Godolphin; whose noble qualities that unhappy event had\nserved to call forth anew, was rendered less capable than ever of\nresisting his prayers; and Delamere, on whose account her determination\nhad been originally made, could now no longer suffer by her breaking it.\nStill, however, she insisted upon it, that a term little short of what\nshe had named should elapse before her marriage should take place; as a\ncompliment to the memory of her unfortunate lover, and to the deep\nsorrow of her uncle and Lady Westhaven.\n\nHere, then, she rested her last defence. And when their encreasing\nsolicitations obliged her to consent to shorten the term to three\nmonths, Godolphin undertook to make it the particular request of Lord\nMontreville and his daughter, that their marriage should take place\nwithin three weeks. Animated by the hopes of hastening the period, he\nwent himself into Kent; where he pleaded so successfully to Lady\nWesthaven, that she not only wrote pressingly to Emmeline, but prevailed\non the Marquis to give him a letter also; in which, after deploring, in\nterms expressive of anguish and regret, that unfortunate infatuation\nwhich had eventually robbed him of his son, he told her that he had\nvery little more now to wish, dead as he was to the world, than to see\nher happily married. That the tender attention of the generous Godolphin\nto that beloved son, in the last hours of his life, had endeared him to\nhim above all other men; that his character, connections and conduct\nwere unexceptionable; and therefore, his Lordship added, that tho' he\ndid not know that he could himself bear to see it, he wished she would\nnot hesitate to complete his happiness; observing, that if she thought\nit too early after the loss of so near a relation, she might have the\nceremony performed with such privacy, that only the respective families\nneed know of its celebration. Emmeline, having now no longer a\nsubterfuge, was obliged to let Godolphin take his own way. He exerted\nhimself so anxiously to get the deeds completed, that before the end of\nthree weeks they were finished. Lord and Lady Clancarryl prolonged their\nstay on purpose; and they, together with Lady Adelina and Fitz-Edward,\nwere present at the ceremony. When it was over, Lord and Lady Clancarryl\ntook an affectionate leave of the bride and bridegroom, and set out for\nIreland, accompanied by Fitz-Edward; who, with the most painful\nreluctance tearing himself from Lady Adelina by her express desire, was\nyet allowed to carry with him the hope, that at the end of her mourning\nshe would relent, and accede to the entreaties of all her family.\n\nGodolphin, his Emmeline, his sister and her little boy, took immediately\nafterwards the road to East Cliff. They continued there the months of\nMay and June; where, about six weeks after their marriage, they were\nvisited by Lord and Lady Westhaven; the latter having never left her\nfather 'till then, and being impatient to return to him, tho' she\nassured Mrs. Godolphin that he was much calmer and more composed than\nthey had at first expected. In the filial attention of his youngest\ndaughter he found all the consolation his misfortunes would admit of on\nthis side the grave; and Emmeline, who had deeply lamented the lingering\nand hopeless anguish to which her uncle was condemned, heard with\nsatisfaction that resignation was, however slowly, blunting the anguish\nhe had endured; and that having relinquished for ever all those\nambitious pursuits to which he had sacrificed solid happiness, he\nthought only of rewarding the piety and tenderness of his youngest\ndaughter; and heard of the happiness of his niece with pleasure. When\nLord and Lady Westhaven left East Cliff, Mr. and Mrs. Godolphin and\nLady Adelina went to Mowbray Castle; where Mrs. Stafford received them\nwith transport, and where they were surrounded by numberless tenants and\ndependants, who blessed the hour of it's restoration to it's benevolent\nand lovely mistress, as well as that which had given her to a man, who\nhad a heart as nobly enlarged, and a spirit generously liberal, as her\nown.\n\nThe comfortable establishment of Mrs. Stafford at Woodfield, was a point\nwhich Emmeline had much at heart; and Godolphin, who knew it was now\nalmost her first wish, took his measures with so much success, that it\nwas soon accomplished. Mrs. Stafford, however, at their united request,\nconsented to stay with them while they remained at Mowbray Castle; and\nEmmeline had the delightful assurances of having made her happy, as well\nas of having greatly contributed to the restored tranquillity of Lady\nAdelina.\n\nMowbray Castle, ever so peculiarly dear to Mrs. Godolphin, and where she\nwas now blessed with her beloved husband and her charming friends,\nbrought however to her mind the mournful remembrance of poor Delamere;\nand the tears of rapture with which the greatness of her own happiness\nsometimes filled her eyes, were mingled with those of sorrow for his\nuntimely death. She considered him as the victim of his mother's fatal\nfondness and his father's ambition: yet that his early death was not\nimmediately owing to his violent passion for her, was a great\nconsolation; and with only the one source of regret which his premature\nfate occasioned, and which being without remedy yielded inevitably to\ntime; she saw an infinite deal for which to be grateful, and failed not\nto offer her humble acknowledgments to that Providence, who, from\ndependance and indigence, had raised her to the highest affluence; given\nher, in the tenderest of husbands, the best, the most generous and most\namiable of men; and had bestowed on her the means and the inclination to\ndeserve, by virtue and beneficence, that heaven, where only she can\nenjoy more perfect and lasting felicity.\n\n\n    FINIS\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK EMMELINE***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 41646-8.txt or 41646-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/4\/1\/6\/4\/41646\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":57,"split":"train"}
