{"ori_id":"522b857d537c17bcf6d7457e7b567a7fd50e9f0d","title":"Right Ho, Jeeves","context":"Right Ho, Jeeves\n Bertie returns to London from several weeks in Cannes spent in the company of his Aunt Dahlia Travers and her daughter Angela. In Bertie's absence, Jeeves has been advising Bertie's old school friend, Gussie Fink-Nottle, who is in love with a goofy, sentimental, whimsical, childish girl named Madeline Bassett. Gussie, a shy teetotaler with a passion for newts and a face like a fish, is too timid to speak to her. Bertie is annoyed that his friends consider Jeeves more intelligent than Bertie, and he takes Gussie's case in hand, ordering Jeeves not to offer any more advice.\nMadeline, a friend of Bertie's cousin Angela, is staying at Brinkley Court (country seat of Aunt Dahlia and Uncle Tom). Aunt Dahlia demands that Bertie come to Brinkley Court to make a speech and present the school prizes to students at the local grammar school, which he considers a fearsome task. Bertie sends Gussie to Brinkley Court in his place, so that Gussie will have the chance to woo Madeline there, but also so that Gussie will be forced to take on the unpleasant job of distributing the school prizes.\nWhen Angela breaks her engagement to the athletic but heavy Tuppy Glossop, Bertie feels obliged to go down to Brinkley Court to comfort Aunt Dahlia. In addition to her worry about Angela's broken engagement, Aunt Dahlia is anxious because she has lost 500 pounds gambling at Cannes, and now needs to ask her miserly husband Tom to replace the money in order to keep financing her magazine, Milady's Boudoir. Bertie advises her to arouse Uncle Tom's concern for her by pretending to have lost her appetite through worry. He offers similar advice to Tuppy, to win back Angela. He also offers the same advice to Gussie, to show his love for Madeline. All take his advice, and the resulting return of plates of untasted food upsets Aunt Dahlia's temperamental prized chef Anatole, who gives notice to quit. Not unreasonably, Aunt Dahlia blames Bertie for this disaster.\nWhen Bertie attempts to probe Madeline's feelings about Gussie, she misinterprets his questioning as a marriage proposal on his own behalf. To his relief, she tells Bertie she cannot marry him, as she has fallen in love with Gussie. Bertie relays the good news to Gussie, but even with this encouragement, Gussie remains too timid to propose, and Bertie decides to embolden him by lacing his orange juice with liquor.\nGussie ends up imbibing more liquor than Bertie had intended. Under its influence, Gussie successfully proposes to Madeline. He then delivers a hilarious, abusive, drunken speech to the grammar school while presenting the school prizes. Madeline, disgusted, breaks the engagement and resolves to marry Bertie instead. The prospect of spending his life with the drippy Madeline terrifies Bertie, but his personal code of chivalrous behavior will not allow him to insult her by withdrawing his \"proposal\" and turning her down. Meanwhile, Gussie, still drunk, retaliates against Madeline by proposing to Angela, who accepts him in order to score off Tuppy. Tuppy's jealousy is aroused and he chases Gussie all around the mansion, vowing to beat him within an inch of his life.\nIn the face of this chaos, Bertie admits his inability to cope, and appeals to Jeeves for advice. Jeeves arranges for Bertie to be absent for a few hours, and during that time swiftly and ingeniously solves all the problems, assuring that Angela and Tuppy are reconciled, that Gussie and Madeline become engaged again, that Anatole withdraws his resignation, and that Uncle Tom writes Aunt Dahlia a check for 500 pounds. Bertie learns his lesson and resolves to let Jeeves have his way in the future.\nSections of the story were adapted into episodes of the ITV series Jeeves and Wooster.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Right Ho, Jeeves, by P.

Hold the line a minute. I've gone off the rails.\n\n\nI don't know if you have had the same experience, but the snag I always\ncome up against when I'm telling a story is this dashed difficult problem\nof where to begin it. It's a thing you don't want to go wrong over,\nbecause one false step and you're sunk. I mean, if you fool about too\nlong at the start, trying to establish atmosphere, as they call it, and\nall that sort of rot, you fail to grip and the customers walk out on you.\n\nGet off the mark, on the other hand, like a scalded cat, and your public\nis at a loss. It simply raises its eyebrows, and can't make out what\nyou're talking about.\n\nAnd in opening my report of the complex case of Gussie Fink-Nottle,\nMadeline Bassett, my Cousin Angela, my Aunt Dahlia, my Uncle Thomas,\nyoung Tuppy Glossop and the cook, Anatole, with the above spot of\ndialogue, I see that I have made the second of these two floaters.\n\nI shall have to hark back a bit. And taking it for all in all and\nweighing this against that, I suppose the affair may be said to have had\nits inception, if inception is the word I want, with that visit of mine\nto Cannes. If I hadn't gone to Cannes, I shouldn't have met the Bassett\nor bought that white mess jacket, and Angela wouldn't have met her shark,\nand Aunt Dahlia wouldn't have played baccarat.\n\nYes, most decidedly, Cannes was the _point d'appui._\n\nRight ho, then. Let me marshal my facts.\n\nI went to Cannes--leaving Jeeves behind, he having intimated that he did\nnot wish to miss Ascot--round about the beginning of June. With me\ntravelled my Aunt Dahlia and her daughter Angela. Tuppy Glossop, Angela's\nbetrothed, was to have been of the party, but at the last moment couldn't\nget away. Uncle Tom, Aunt Dahlia's husband, remained at home, because he\ncan't stick the South of France at any price.\n\nSo there you have the layout--Aunt Dahlia, Cousin Angela and self off to\nCannes round about the beginning of June.\n\nAll pretty clear so far, what?\n\nWe stayed at Cannes about two months, and except for the fact that Aunt\nDahlia lost her shirt at baccarat and Angela nearly got inhaled by a\nshark while aquaplaning, a pleasant time was had by all.\n\nOn July the twenty-fifth, looking bronzed and fit, I accompanied aunt and\nchild back to London. At seven p.m. on July the twenty-sixth we alighted\nat Victoria. And at seven-twenty or thereabouts we parted with mutual\nexpressions of esteem--they to shove off in Aunt Dahlia's car to Brinkley\nCourt, her place in Worcestershire, where they were expecting to\nentertain Tuppy in a day or two; I to go to the flat, drop my luggage,\nclean up a bit, and put on the soup and fish preparatory to pushing round\nto the Drones for a bite of dinner.\n\nAnd it was while I was at the flat, towelling the torso after a\nmuch-needed rinse, that Jeeves, as we chatted of this and that--picking\nup the threads, as it were--suddenly brought the name of Gussie\nFink-Nottle into the conversation.\n\nAs I recall it, the dialogue ran something as follows:\n\nSELF: Well, Jeeves, here we are, what?\n\nJEEVES: Yes, sir.\n\nSELF: I mean to say, home again.\n\nJEEVES: Precisely, sir.\n\nSELF: Seems ages since I went away.\n\nJEEVES: Yes, sir.\n\nSELF: Have a good time at Ascot?\n\nJEEVES: Most agreeable, sir.\n\nSELF: Win anything?\n\nJEEVES: Quite a satisfactory sum, thank you, sir.\n\nSELF: Good. Well, Jeeves, what news on the Rialto? Anybody been phoning\nor calling or anything during my abs.?\n\nJEEVES: Mr. Fink-Nottle, sir, has been a frequent caller.\n\nI stared. Indeed, it would not be too much to say that I gaped.\n\n\"Mr. Fink-Nottle?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You don't mean Mr. Fink-Nottle?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"But Mr. Fink-Nottle's not in London?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm blowed.\"\n\nAnd I'll tell you why I was blowed. I found it scarcely possible to give\ncredence to his statement. This Fink-Nottle, you see, was one of those\nfreaks you come across from time to time during life's journey who can't\nstand London. He lived year in and year out, covered with moss, in a\nremote village down in Lincolnshire, never coming up even for the Eton\nand Harrow match. And when I asked him once if he didn't find the time\nhang a bit heavy on his hands, he said, no, because he had a pond in his\ngarden and studied the habits of newts.\n\nI couldn't imagine what could have brought the chap up to the great city.\nI would have been prepared to bet that as long as the supply of newts\ndidn't give out, nothing could have shifted him from that village of his.\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You got the name correctly? Fink-Nottle?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, it's the most extraordinary thing. It must be five years since he\nwas in London. He makes no secret of the fact that the place gives him\nthe pip. Until now, he has always stayed glued to the country, completely\nsurrounded by newts.\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"Newts, Jeeves. Mr. Fink-Nottle has a strong newt complex. You must have\nheard of newts. Those little sort of lizard things that charge about in\nponds.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir. The aquatic members of the family Salamandridae which\nconstitute the genus Molge.\"\n\n\"That's right. Well, Gussie has always been a slave to them. He used to\nkeep them at school.\"\n\n\"I believe young gentlemen frequently do, sir.\"\n\n\"He kept them in his study in a kind of glass-tank arrangement, and\npretty niffy the whole thing was, I recall. I suppose one ought to have\nbeen able to see what the end would be even then, but you know what boys\nare. Careless, heedless, busy about our own affairs, we scarcely gave\nthis kink in Gussie's character a thought. We may have exchanged an\noccasional remark about it taking all sorts to make a world, but nothing\nmore. You can guess the sequel. The trouble spread,\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir?\"\n\n\"Absolutely, Jeeves. The craving grew upon him. The newts got him.\nArrived at man's estate, he retired to the depths of the country and gave\nhis life up to these dumb chums. I suppose he used to tell himself that\nhe could take them or leave them alone, and then found--too late--that he\ncouldn't.\"\n\n\"It is often the way, sir.\"\n\n\"Too true, Jeeves. At any rate, for the last five years he has been\nliving at this place of his down in Lincolnshire, as confirmed a\nspecies-shunning hermit as ever put fresh water in the tank every second\nday and refused to see a soul. That's why I was so amazed when you told\nme he had suddenly risen to the surface like this. I still can't believe\nit. I am inclined to think that there must be some mistake, and that\nthis bird who has been calling here is some different variety of\nFink-Nottle. The chap I know wears horn-rimmed spectacles and has a face\nlike a fish. How does that check up with your data?\"\n\n\"The gentleman who came to the flat wore horn-rimmed spectacles, sir.\"\n\n\"And looked like something on a slab?\"\n\n\"Possibly there was a certain suggestion of the piscine, sir.\"\n\n\"Then it must be Gussie, I suppose. But what on earth can have brought\nhim up to London?\"\n\n\"I am in a position to explain that, sir. Mr. Fink-Nottle confided to me\nhis motive in visiting the metropolis. He came because the young lady is\nhere.\"\n\n\"Young lady?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You don't mean he's in love?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm dashed. I'm really dashed. I positively am dashed, Jeeves.\"\n\nAnd I was too. I mean to say, a joke's a joke, but there are limits.\n\nThen I found my mind turning to another aspect of this rummy affair.\nConceding the fact that Gussie Fink-Nottle, against all the ruling of the\nform book, might have fallen in love, why should he have been haunting my\nflat like this? No doubt the occasion was one of those when a fellow\nneeds a friend, but I couldn't see what had made him pick on me.\n\nIt wasn't as if he and I were in any way bosom. We had seen a lot of each\nother at one time, of course, but in the last two years I hadn't had so\nmuch as a post card from him.\n\nI put all this to Jeeves:\n\n\"Odd, his coming to me. Still, if he did, he did. No argument about that.\nIt must have been a nasty jar for the poor perisher when he found I\nwasn't here.\"\n\n\"No, sir. Mr. Fink-Nottle did not call to see you, sir.\"\n\n\"Pull yourself together, Jeeves. You've just told me that this is what he\nhas been doing, and assiduously, at that.\"\n\n\"It was I with whom he was desirous of establishing communication, sir.\"\n\n\"You? But I didn't know you had ever met him.\"\n\n\"I had not had that pleasure until he called here, sir. But it appears\nthat Mr. Sipperley, a fellow student with whom Mr. Fink-Nottle had been at\nthe university, recommended him to place his affairs in my hands.\"\n\nThe mystery had conked. I saw all. As I dare say you know, Jeeves's\nreputation as a counsellor has long been established among the\ncognoscenti, and the first move of any of my little circle on discovering\nthemselves in any form of soup is always to roll round and put the thing\nup to him. And when he's got A out of a bad spot, A puts B on to him. And\nthen, when he has fixed up B, B sends C along. And so on, if you get my\ndrift, and so forth.\n\nThat's how these big consulting practices like Jeeves's grow. Old Sippy,\nI knew, had been deeply impressed by the man's efforts on his behalf at\nthe time when he was trying to get engaged to Elizabeth Moon, so it was\nnot to be wondered at that he should have advised Gussie to apply. Pure\nroutine, you might say.\n\n\"Oh, you're acting for him, are you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Now I follow. Now I understand. And what is Gussie's trouble?\"\n\n\"Oddly enough, sir, precisely the same as that of Mr. Sipperley when I\nwas enabled to be of assistance to him. No doubt you recall Mr.\nSipperley's predicament, sir. Deeply attached to Miss Moon, he suffered\nfrom a rooted diffidence which made it impossible for him to speak.\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"I remember. Yes, I recall the Sipperley case. He couldn't bring himself\nto the scratch. A marked coldness of the feet, was there not? I recollect\nyou saying he was letting--what was it?--letting something do something.\nCats entered into it, if I am not mistaken.\"\n\n\"Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would', sir.\"\n\n\"That's right. But how about the cats?\"\n\n\"Like the poor cat i' the adage, sir.\"\n\n\"Exactly. It beats me how you think up these things. And Gussie, you say,\nis in the same posish?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Each time he endeavours to formulate a proposal of marriage,\nhis courage fails him.\"\n\n\"And yet, if he wants this female to be his wife, he's got to say so,\nwhat? I mean, only civil to mention it.\"\n\n\"Precisely, sir.\"\n\nI mused.\n\n\"Well, I suppose this was inevitable, Jeeves. I wouldn't have thought\nthat this Fink-Nottle would ever have fallen a victim to the divine _p_,\nbut, if he has, no wonder he finds the going sticky.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Look at the life he's led.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose he has spoken to a girl for years. What a lesson this is\nto us, Jeeves, not to shut ourselves up in country houses and stare into\nglass tanks. You can't be the dominant male if you do that sort of thing.\nIn this life, you can choose between two courses. You can either shut\nyourself up in a country house and stare into tanks, or you can be a\ndasher with the sex. You can't do both.\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\nI mused once more. Gussie and I, as I say, had rather lost touch, but all\nthe same I was exercised about the poor fish, as I am about all my pals,\nclose or distant, who find themselves treading upon Life's banana skins.\nIt seemed to me that he was up against it.\n\nI threw my mind back to the last time I had seen him. About two years\nago, it had been. I had looked in at his place while on a motor trip, and\nhe had put me right off my feed by bringing a couple of green things with\nlegs to the luncheon table, crooning over them like a young mother and\neventually losing one of them in the salad. That picture, rising before\nmy eyes, didn't give me much confidence in the unfortunate goof's ability\nto woo and win, I must say. Especially if the girl he had earmarked was\none of these tough modern thugs, all lipstick and cool, hard, sardonic\neyes, as she probably was.\n\n\"Tell me, Jeeves,\" I said, wishing to know the worst, \"what sort of a\ngirl is this girl of Gussie's?\"\n\n\"I have not met the young lady, sir. Mr. Fink-Nottle speaks highly of her\nattractions.\"\n\n\"Seemed to like her, did he?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Did he mention her name? Perhaps I know her.\"\n\n\"She is a Miss Bassett, sir. Miss Madeline Bassett.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nI was deeply intrigued.\n\n\"Egad, Jeeves! Fancy that. It's a small world, isn't it, what?\"\n\n\"The young lady is an acquaintance of yours, sir?\"\n\n\"I know her well. Your news has relieved my mind, Jeeves. It makes the\nwhole thing begin to seem far more like a practical working proposition.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. I confess that until you supplied this information I was\nfeeling profoundly dubious about poor old Gussie's chances of inducing\nany spinster of any parish to join him in the saunter down the aisle. You\nwill agree with me that he is not everybody's money.\"\n\n\"There may be something in what you say, sir.\"\n\n\"Cleopatra wouldn't have liked him.\"\n\n\"Possibly not, sir.\"\n\n\"And I doubt if he would go any too well with Tallulah Bankhead.\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"But when you tell me that the object of his affections is Miss Bassett,\nwhy, then, Jeeves, hope begins to dawn a bit. He's just the sort of chap\na girl like Madeline Bassett might scoop in with relish.\"\n\nThis Bassett, I must explain, had been a fellow visitor of ours at\nCannes; and as she and Angela had struck up one of those effervescent\nfriendships which girls do strike up, I had seen quite a bit of her.\nIndeed, in my moodier moments it sometimes seemed to me that I could not\nmove a step without stubbing my toe on the woman.\n\nAnd what made it all so painful and distressing was that the more we met,\nthe less did I seem able to find to say to her.\n\nYou know how it is with some girls. They seem to take the stuffing right\nout of you. I mean to say, there is something about their personality\nthat paralyses the vocal cords and reduces the contents of the brain to\ncauliflower. It was like that with this Bassett and me; so much so that I\nhave known occasions when for minutes at a stretch Bertram Wooster might\nhave been observed fumbling with the tie, shuffling the feet, and\nbehaving in all other respects in her presence like the complete dumb\nbrick. When, therefore, she took her departure some two weeks before we\ndid, you may readily imagine that, in Bertram's opinion, it was not a day\ntoo soon.\n\nIt was not her beauty, mark you, that thus numbed me. She was a pretty\nenough girl in a droopy, blonde, saucer-eyed way, but not the sort of\nbreath-taker that takes the breath.\n\nNo, what caused this disintegration in a usually fairly fluent prattler\nwith the sex was her whole mental attitude. I don't want to wrong\nanybody, so I won't go so far as to say that she actually wrote poetry,\nbut her conversation, to my mind, was of a nature calculated to excite\nthe liveliest suspicions. Well, I mean to say, when a girl suddenly asks\nyou out of a blue sky if you don't sometimes feel that the stars are\nGod's daisy-chain, you begin to think a bit.\n\nAs regards the fusing of her soul and mine, therefore, there was nothing\ndoing. But with Gussie, the posish was entirely different. The thing that\nhad stymied me--viz. that this girl was obviously all loaded down with\nideals and sentiment and what not--was quite in order as far as he was\nconcerned.\n\nGussie had always been one of those dreamy, soulful birds--you can't shut\nyourself up in the country and live only for newts, if you're not--and I\ncould see no reason why, if he could somehow be induced to get the low,\nburning words off his chest, he and the Bassett shouldn't hit it off like\nham and eggs.\n\n\"She's just the type for him,\" I said.\n\n\"I am most gratified to hear it, sir.\"\n\n\"And he's just the type for her. In fine, a good thing and one to be\npushed along with the utmost energy. Strain every nerve, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir,\" replied the honest fellow. \"I will attend to the matter\nat once.\"\n\nNow up to this point, as you will doubtless agree, what you might call a\nperfect harmony had prevailed. Friendly gossip between employer and\nemployed, and everything as sweet as a nut. But at this juncture, I\nregret to say, there was an unpleasant switch. The atmosphere suddenly\nchanged, the storm clouds began to gather, and before we knew where we\nwere, the jarring note had come bounding on the scene. I have known this\nto happen before in the Wooster home.\n\nThe first intimation I had that things were about to hot up was a pained\nand disapproving cough from the neighbourhood of the carpet. For, during\nthe above exchanges, I should explain, while I, having dried the frame,\nhad been dressing in a leisurely manner, donning here a sock, there a\nshoe, and gradually climbing into the vest, the shirt, the tie, and the\nknee-length, Jeeves had been down on the lower level, unpacking my\neffects.\n\nHe now rose, holding a white object. And at the sight of it, I realized\nthat another of our domestic crises had arrived, another of those\nunfortunate clashes of will between two strong men, and that Bertram,\nunless he remembered his fighting ancestors and stood up for his rights,\nwas about to be put upon.\n\nI don't know if you were at Cannes this summer. If you were, you will\nrecall that anybody with any pretensions to being the life and soul of\nthe party was accustomed to attend binges at the Casino in the ordinary\nevening-wear trouserings topped to the north by a white mess-jacket with\nbrass buttons. And ever since I had stepped aboard the Blue Train at\nCannes station, I had been wondering on and off how mine would go with\nJeeves.\n\nIn the matter of evening costume, you see, Jeeves is hidebound and\nreactionary. I had had trouble with him before about soft-bosomed shirts.\nAnd while these mess-jackets had, as I say, been all the rage--_tout ce\nqu'il y a de chic_--on the C\u00c3\u00b4te d'Azur, I had never concealed it from\nmyself, even when treading the measure at the Palm Beach Casino in the\none I had hastened to buy, that there might be something of an upheaval\nabout it on my return.\n\nI prepared to be firm.\n\n\"Yes, Jeeves?\" I said. And though my voice was suave, a close observer in\na position to watch my eyes would have noticed a steely glint. Nobody has\na greater respect for Jeeves's intellect than I have, but this\ndisposition of his to dictate to the hand that fed him had got, I felt,\nto be checked. This mess-jacket was very near to my heart, and I jolly\nwell intended to fight for it with all the vim of grand old Sieur de\nWooster at the Battle of Agincourt.\n\n\"Yes, Jeeves?\" I said. \"Something on your mind, Jeeves?\"\n\n\"I fear that you inadvertently left Cannes in the possession of a coat\nbelonging to some other gentleman, sir.\"\n\nI switched on the steely a bit more.\n\n\"No, Jeeves,\" I said, in a level tone, \"the object under advisement is\nmine. I bought it out there.\"\n\n\"You wore it, sir?\"\n\n\"Every night.\"\n\n\"But surely you are not proposing to wear it in England, sir?\"\n\nI saw that we had arrived at the nub.\n\n\"Yes, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"But, sir----\"\n\n\"You were saying, Jeeves?\"\n\n\"It is quite unsuitable, sir.\"\n\n\"I do not agree with you, Jeeves. I anticipate a great popular success\nfor this jacket. It is my intention to spring it on the public tomorrow\nat Pongo Twistleton's birthday party, where I confidently expect it to be\none long scream from start to finish. No argument, Jeeves. No discussion.\nWhatever fantastic objection you may have taken to it, I wear this\njacket.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\nHe went on with his unpacking. I said no more on the subject. I had won\nthe victory, and we Woosters do not triumph over a beaten foe. Presently,\nhaving completed my toilet, I bade the man a cheery farewell and in\ngenerous mood suggested that, as I was dining out, why didn't he take the\nevening off and go to some improving picture or something. Sort of olive\nbranch, if you see what I mean.\n\nHe didn't seem to think much of it.\n\n\"Thank you, sir, I will remain in.\"\n\nI surveyed him narrowly.\n\n\"Is this dudgeon, Jeeves?\"\n\n\"No, sir, I am obliged to remain on the premises. Mr. Fink-Nottle\ninformed me he would be calling to see me this evening.\"\n\n\"Oh, Gussie's coming, is he? Well, give him my love.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And a whisky and soda, and so forth.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\n\"Right ho, Jeeves.\"\n\nI then set off for the Drones.\n\nAt the Drones I ran into Pongo Twistleton, and he talked so much about\nthe forthcoming merry-making of his, of which good reports had already\nreached me through my correspondents, that it was nearing eleven when I\ngot home again.\n\nAnd scarcely had I opened the door when I heard voices in the\nsitting-room, and scarcely had I entered the sitting-room when I found\nthat these proceeded from Jeeves and what appeared at first sight to be\nthe Devil.\n\nA closer scrutiny informed me that it was Gussie Fink-Nottle, dressed as\nMephistopheles.\n\n\n\n-2-\n\n\n\"What-ho, Gussie,\" I said.\n\nYou couldn't have told it from my manner, but I was feeling more than a\nbit nonplussed. The spectacle before me was enough to nonplus anyone. I\nmean to say, this Fink-Nottle, as I remembered him, was the sort of shy,\nshrinking goop who might have been expected to shake like an aspen if\ninvited to so much as a social Saturday afternoon at the vicarage. And\nyet here he was, if one could credit one's senses, about to take part in\na fancy-dress ball, a form of entertainment notoriously a testing\nexperience for the toughest.\n\nAnd he was attending that fancy-dress ball, mark you--not, like every\nother well-bred Englishman, as a Pierrot, but as Mephistopheles--this\ninvolving, as I need scarcely stress, not only scarlet tights but a\npretty frightful false beard.\n\nRummy, you'll admit. However, one masks one's feelings. I betrayed no\nvulgar astonishment, but, as I say, what-hoed with civil nonchalance.\n\nHe grinned through the fungus--rather sheepishly, I thought.\n\n\"Oh, hullo, Bertie.\"\n\n\"Long time since I saw you. Have a spot?\"\n\n\"No, thanks. I must be off in a minute. I just came round to ask Jeeves\nhow he thought I looked. How do you think I look, Bertie?\"\n\nWell, the answer to that, of course, was \"perfectly foul\". But we\nWoosters are men of tact and have a nice sense of the obligations of a\nhost. We do not tell old friends beneath our roof-tree that they are an\noffence to the eyesight. I evaded the question.\n\n\"I hear you're in London,\" I said carelessly.\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"Must be years since you came up.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"And now you're off for an evening's pleasure.\"\n\nHe shuddered a bit. He had, I noticed, a hunted air.\n\n\"Pleasure!\"\n\n\"Aren't you looking forward to this rout or revel?\"\n\n\"Oh, I suppose it'll be all right,\" he said, in a toneless voice.\n\"Anyway, I ought to be off, I suppose. The thing starts round about\neleven. I told my cab to wait.... Will you see if it's there, Jeeves?\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\nThere was something of a pause after the door had closed. A certain\nconstraint. I mixed myself a beaker, while Gussie, a glutton for\npunishment, stared at himself in the mirror. Finally I decided that it\nwould be best to let him know that I was abreast of his affairs. It might\nbe that it would ease his mind to confide in a sympathetic man of\nexperience. I have generally found, with those under the influence, that\nwhat they want more than anything is the listening ear.\n\n\"Well, Gussie, old leper,\" I said, \"I've been hearing all about you.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"This little trouble of yours. Jeeves has told me everything.\"\n\nHe didn't seem any too braced. It's always difficult to be sure, of\ncourse, when a chap has dug himself in behind a Mephistopheles beard, but\nI fancy he flushed a trifle.\n\n\"I wish Jeeves wouldn't go gassing all over the place. It was supposed to\nbe confidential.\"\n\nI could not permit this tone.\n\n\"Dishing up the dirt to the young master can scarcely be described as\ngassing all over the place,\" I said, with a touch of rebuke. \"Anyway,\nthere it is. I know all. And I should like to begin,\" I said, sinking my\npersonal opinion that the female in question was a sloppy pest in my\ndesire to buck and encourage, \"by saying that Madeline Bassett is a\ncharming girl. A winner, and just the sort for you.\"\n\n\"You don't know her?\"\n\n\"Certainly I know her. What beats me is how you ever got in touch. Where\ndid you meet?\"\n\n\"She was staying at a place near mine in Lincolnshire the week before\nlast.\"\n\n\"Yes, but even so. I didn't know you called on the neighbours.\"\n\n\"I don't. I met her out for a walk with her dog. The dog had got a thorn\nin its foot, and when she tried to take it out, it snapped at her. So, of\ncourse, I had to rally round.\"\n\n\"You extracted the thorn?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And fell in love at first sight?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, dash it, with a thing like that to give you a send-off, why didn't\nyou cash in immediately?\"\n\n\"I hadn't the nerve.\"\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"We talked for a bit.\"\n\n\"What about?\"\n\n\"Oh, birds.\"\n\n\"Birds? What birds?\"\n\n\"The birds that happened to be hanging round. And the scenery, and all\nthat sort of thing. And she said she was going to London, and asked me\nto look her up if I was ever there.\"\n\n\"And even after that you didn't so much as press her hand?\"\n\n\"Of course not.\"\n\nWell, I mean, it looked as though there was no more to be said. If a chap\nis such a rabbit that he can't get action when he's handed the thing on a\nplate, his case would appear to be pretty hopeless. Nevertheless, I\nreminded myself that this non-starter and I had been at school together.\nOne must make an effort for an old school friend.\n\n\"Ah, well,\" I said, \"we must see what can be done. Things may brighten.\nAt any rate, you will be glad to learn that I am behind you in this\nenterprise. You have Bertram Wooster in your corner, Gussie.\"\n\n\"Thanks, old man. And Jeeves, of course, which is the thing that really\nmatters.\"\n\nI don't mind admitting that I winced. He meant no harm, I suppose, but\nI'm bound to say that this tactless speech nettled me not a little.\nPeople are always nettling me like that. Giving me to understand, I mean\nto say, that in their opinion Bertram Wooster is a mere cipher and that\nthe only member of the household with brains and resources is Jeeves.\n\nIt jars on me.\n\nAnd tonight it jarred on me more than usual, because I was feeling pretty\ndashed fed with Jeeves. Over that matter of the mess jacket, I mean.\nTrue, I had forced him to climb down, quelling him, as described, with\nthe quiet strength of my personality, but I was still a trifle shirty at\nhis having brought the thing up at all. It seemed to me that what Jeeves\nwanted was the iron hand.\n\n\"And what is he doing about it?\" I inquired stiffly.\n\n\"He's been giving the position of affairs a lot of thought.\"\n\n\"He has, has he?\"\n\n\"It's on his advice that I'm going to this dance.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"She is going to be there. In fact, it was she who sent me the ticket of\ninvitation. And Jeeves considered----\"\n\n\"And why not as a Pierrot?\" I said, taking up the point which had struck\nme before. \"Why this break with a grand old tradition?\"\n\n\"He particularly wanted me to go as Mephistopheles.\"\n\nI started.\n\n\"He did, did he? He specifically recommended that definite costume?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Ha!\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Just 'Ha!'\"\n\nAnd I'll tell you why I said \"Ha!\" Here was Jeeves making heavy weather\nabout me wearing a perfectly ordinary white mess jacket, a garment not\nonly _tout ce qu'il y a de chic_, but absolutely _de rigueur_, and in the\nsame breath, as you might say, inciting Gussie Fink-Nottle to be a blot\non the London scene in scarlet tights. Ironical, what? One looks askance\nat this sort of in-and-out running.\n\n\"What has he got against Pierrots?\"\n\n\"I don't think he objects to Pierrots as Pierrots. But in my case he\nthought a Pierrot wouldn't be adequate.\"\n\n\"I don't follow that.\"\n\n\"He said that the costume of Pierrot, while pleasing to the eye, lacked\nthe authority of the Mephistopheles costume.\"\n\n\"I still don't get it.\"\n\n\"Well, it's a matter of psychology, he said.\"\n\nThere was a time when a remark like that would have had me snookered. But\nlong association with Jeeves has developed the Wooster vocabulary\nconsiderably. Jeeves has always been a whale for the psychology of the\nindividual, and I now follow him like a bloodhound when he snaps it out\nof the bag.\n\n\"Oh, psychology?\"\n\n\"Yes. Jeeves is a great believer in the moral effect of clothes. He\nthinks I might be emboldened in a striking costume like this. He said a\nPirate Chief would be just as good. In fact, a Pirate Chief was his first\nsuggestion, but I objected to the boots.\"\n\nI saw his point. There is enough sadness in life without having fellows\nlike Gussie Fink-Nottle going about in sea boots.\n\n\"And are you emboldened?\"\n\n\"Well, to be absolutely accurate, Bertie, old man, no.\"\n\nA gust of compassion shook me. After all, though we had lost touch a bit\nof recent years, this man and I had once thrown inked darts at each\nother.\n\n\"Gussie,\" I said, \"take an old friend's advice, and don't go within a\nmile of this binge.\"\n\n\"But it's my last chance of seeing her. She's off tomorrow to stay with\nsome people in the country. Besides, you don't know.\"\n\n\"Don't know what?\"\n\n\"That this idea of Jeeves's won't work. I feel a most frightful chump\nnow, yes, but who can say whether that will not pass off when I get into\na mob of other people in fancy dress. I had the same experience as a\nchild, one year during the Christmas festivities. They dressed me up as a\nrabbit, and the shame was indescribable. Yet when I got to the party and\nfound myself surrounded by scores of other children, many in costumes\neven ghastlier than my own, I perked up amazingly, joined freely in the\nrevels, and was able to eat so hearty a supper that I was sick twice in\nthe cab coming home. What I mean is, you can't tell in cold blood.\"\n\nI weighed this. It was specious, of course.\n\n\"And you can't get away from it that, fundamentally, Jeeves's idea is\nsound. In a striking costume like Mephistopheles, I might quite easily\npull off something pretty impressive. Colour does make a difference. Look\nat newts. During the courting season the male newt is brilliantly\ncoloured. It helps him a lot.\"\n\n\"But you aren't a male newt.\"\n\n\"I wish I were. Do you know how a male newt proposes, Bertie? He just\nstands in front of the female newt vibrating his tail and bending his\nbody in a semi-circle. I could do that on my head. No, you wouldn't find\nme grousing if I were a male newt.\"\n\n\"But if you were a male newt, Madeline Bassett wouldn't look at you. Not\nwith the eye of love, I mean.\"\n\n\"She would, if she were a female newt.\"\n\n\"But she isn't a female newt.\"\n\n\"No, but suppose she was.\"\n\n\"Well, if she was, you wouldn't be in love with her.\"\n\n\"Yes, I would, if I were a male newt.\"\n\nA slight throbbing about the temples told me that this discussion had\nreached saturation point.\n\n\"Well, anyway,\" I said, \"coming down to hard facts and cutting out all\nthis visionary stuff about vibrating tails and what not, the salient\npoint that emerges is that you are booked to appear at a fancy-dress\nball. And I tell you out of my riper knowledge of fancy-dress balls,\nGussie, that you won't enjoy yourself.\"\n\n\"It isn't a question of enjoying yourself.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't go.\"\n\n\"I must go. I keep telling you she's off to the country tomorrow.\"\n\nI gave it up.\n\n\"So be it,\" I said. \"Have it your own way.... Yes, Jeeves?\"\n\n\"Mr. Fink-Nottle's cab, sir.\"\n\n\"Ah? The cab, eh?... Your cab, Gussie.\"\n\n\"Oh, the cab? Oh, right. Of course, yes, rather.... Thanks, Jeeves ...\nWell, so long, Bertie.\"\n\nAnd giving me the sort of weak smile Roman gladiators used to give the\nEmperor before entering the arena, Gussie trickled off. And I turned to\nJeeves. The moment had arrived for putting him in his place, and I was\nall for it.\n\nIt was a little difficult to know how to begin, of course. I mean to say,\nwhile firmly resolved to tick him off, I didn't want to gash his feelings\ntoo deeply. Even when displaying the iron hand, we Woosters like to keep\nthe thing fairly matey.\n\nHowever, on consideration, I saw that there was nothing to be gained by\ntrying to lead up to it gently. It is never any use beating about the b.\n\n\"Jeeves,\" I said, \"may I speak frankly?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir.\"\n\n\"What I have to say may wound you.\"\n\n\"Not at all, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I have been having a chat with Mr. Fink-Nottle, and he has\nbeen telling me about this Mephistopheles scheme of yours.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir?\"\n\n\"Now let me get it straight. If I follow your reasoning correctly, you\nthink that, stimulated by being upholstered throughout in scarlet tights,\nMr. Fink-Nottle, on encountering the adored object, will vibrate his tail\nand generally let himself go with a whoop.\"\n\n\"I am of opinion that he will lose much of his normal diffidence, sir.\"\n\n\"I don't agree with you, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"No, sir?\"\n\n\"No. In fact, not to put too fine a point upon it, I consider that of all\nthe dashed silly, drivelling ideas I ever heard in my puff this is the\nmost blithering and futile. It won't work. Not a chance. All you have\ndone is to subject Mr. Fink-Nottle to the nameless horrors of a\nfancy-dress ball for nothing. And this is not the first time this sort\nof thing has happened. To be quite candid, Jeeves, I have frequently\nnoticed before now a tendency or disposition on your part to\nbecome--what's the word?\"\n\n\"I could not say, sir.\"\n\n\"Eloquent? No, it's not eloquent. Elusive? No, it's not elusive. It's on\nthe tip of my tongue. Begins with an 'e' and means being a jolly sight\ntoo clever.\"\n\n\"Elaborate, sir?\"\n\n\"That is the exact word I was after. Too elaborate, Jeeves--that is what\nyou are frequently prone to become. Your methods are not simple, not\nstraightforward. You cloud the issue with a lot of fancy stuff that is\nnot of the essence. All that Gussie needs is the elder-brotherly advice\nof a seasoned man of the world. So what I suggest is that from now onward\nyou leave this case to me.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\n\"You lay off and devote yourself to your duties about the home.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\n\"I shall no doubt think of something quite simple and straightforward yet\nperfectly effective ere long. I will make a point of seeing Gussie\ntomorrow.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\n\"Right ho, Jeeves.\"\n\nBut on the morrow all those telegrams started coming in, and I confess\nthat for twenty-four hours I didn't give the poor chap a thought, having\nproblems of my own to contend with.\n\n\n\n-3-\n\n\nThe first of the telegrams arrived shortly after noon, and Jeeves brought\nit in with the before-luncheon snifter. It was from my Aunt Dahlia,\noperating from Market Snodsbury, a small town of sorts a mile or two\nalong the main road as you leave her country seat.\n\nIt ran as follows:\n\n_Come at once. Travers._\n\nAnd when I say it puzzled me like the dickens, I am understating it; if\nanything. As mysterious a communication, I considered, as was ever\nflashed over the wires. I studied it in a profound reverie for the best\npart of two dry Martinis and a dividend. I read it backwards. I read it\nforwards. As a matter of fact, I have a sort of recollection of even\nsmelling it. But it still baffled me.\n\nConsider the facts, I mean. It was only a few hours since this aunt and I\nhad parted, after being in constant association for nearly two months.\nAnd yet here she was--with my farewell kiss still lingering on her cheek,\nso to speak--pleading for another reunion. Bertram Wooster is not\naccustomed to this gluttonous appetite for his society. Ask anyone who\nknows me, and they will tell you that after two months of my company,\nwhat the normal person feels is that that will about do for the present.\nIndeed, I have known people who couldn't stick it out for more than a few\ndays.\n\nBefore sitting down to the well-cooked, therefore, I sent this reply:\n\n_Perplexed. Explain. Bertie._\n\nTo this I received an answer during the after-luncheon sleep:\n\n_What on earth is there to be perplexed about, ass? Come at once.\nTravers._\n\nThree cigarettes and a couple of turns about the room, and I had my\nresponse ready:\n\n_How do you mean come at once? Regards. Bertie._\n\nI append the comeback:\n\n_I mean come at once, you maddening half-wit. What did you think I meant?\nCome at once or expect an aunt's curse first post tomorrow. Love.\nTravers._\n\nI then dispatched the following message, wishing to get everything quite\nclear:\n\n_When you say \"Come\" do you mean \"Come to Brinkley Court\"? And when you\nsay \"At once\" do you mean \"At once\"? Fogged. At a loss. All the best.\nBertie._\n\nI sent this one off on my way to the Drones, where I spent a restful\nafternoon throwing cards into a top-hat with some of the better element.\nReturning in the evening hush, I found the answer waiting for me:\n\n_Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. It doesn't matter whether you\nunderstand or not. You just come at once, as I tell you, and for heaven's\nsake stop this back-chat. Do you think I am made of money that I can\nafford to send you telegrams every ten minutes. Stop being a fathead and\ncome immediately. Love. Travers._\n\nIt was at this point that I felt the need of getting a second opinion. I\npressed the bell.\n\n\"Jeeves,\" I said, \"a V-shaped rumminess has manifested itself from the\ndirection of Worcestershire. Read these,\" I said, handing him the papers\nin the case.\n\nHe scanned them.\n\n\"What do you make of it, Jeeves?\"\n\n\"I think Mrs. Travers wishes you to come at once, sir.\"\n\n\"You gather that too, do you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I put the same construction on the thing. But why, Jeeves? Dash it all,\nshe's just had nearly two months of me.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And many people consider the medium dose for an adult two days.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I appreciate the point you raise. Nevertheless, Mrs. Travers\nappears very insistent. I think it would be well to acquiesce in her\nwishes.\"\n\n\"Pop down, you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, I certainly can't go at once. I've an important conference on at\nthe Drones tonight. Pongo Twistleton's birthday party, you remember.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nThere was a slight pause. We were both recalling the little\nunpleasantness that had arisen. I felt obliged to allude to it.\n\n\"You're all wrong about that mess jacket, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"These things are matters of opinion, sir.\"\n\n\"When I wore it at the Casino at Cannes, beautiful women nudged one\nanother and whispered: 'Who is he?'\"\n\n\"The code at Continental casinos is notoriously lax, sir.\"\n\n\"And when I described it to Pongo last night, he was fascinated.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir?\"\n\n\"So were all the rest of those present. One and all admitted that I had\ngot hold of a good thing. Not a dissentient voice.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir?\"\n\n\"I am convinced that you will eventually learn to love this mess-jacket,\nJeeves.\"\n\n\"I fear not, sir.\"\n\nI gave it up. It is never any use trying to reason with Jeeves on these\noccasions. \"Pig-headed\" is the word that springs to the lips. One sighs\nand passes on.\n\n\"Well, anyway, returning to the agenda, I can't go down to Brinkley Court\nor anywhere else yet awhile. That's final. I'll tell you what, Jeeves.\nGive me form and pencil, and I'll wire her that I'll be with her some\ntime next week or the week after. Dash it all, she ought to be able to\nhold out without me for a few days. It only requires will power.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Right ho, then. I'll wire 'Expect me tomorrow fortnight' or words to\nsome such effect. That ought to meet the case. Then if you will toddle\nround the corner and send it off, that will be that.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\nAnd so the long day wore on till it was time for me to dress for Pongo's\nparty.\n\nPongo had assured me, while chatting of the affair on the previous night,\nthat this birthday binge of his was to be on a scale calculated to\nstagger humanity, and I must say I have participated in less fruity\nfunctions. It was well after four when I got home, and by that time I was\nabout ready to turn in. I can just remember groping for the bed and\ncrawling into it, and it seemed to me that the lemon had scarcely touched\nthe pillow before I was aroused by the sound of the door opening.\n\nI was barely ticking over, but I contrived to raise an eyelid.\n\n\"Is that my tea, Jeeves?\"\n\n\"No, sir. It is Mrs. Travers.\"\n\nAnd a moment later there was a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and the\nrelative had crossed the threshold at fifty m.p.h. under her own steam.\n\n\n\n-4-\n\n\nIt has been well said of Bertram Wooster that, while no one views his\nflesh and blood with a keener and more remorselessly critical eye, he is\nnevertheless a man who delights in giving credit where credit is due. And\nif you have followed these memoirs of mine with the proper care, you will\nbe aware that I have frequently had occasion to emphasise the fact that\nAunt Dahlia is all right.\n\nShe is the one, if you remember, who married old Tom Travers _en secondes\nnoces_, as I believe the expression is, the year Bluebottle won the\nCambridgeshire, and once induced me to write an article on What the\nWell-Dressed Man is Wearing for that paper she runs--_Milady's Boudoir_.\nShe is a large, genial soul, with whom it is a pleasure to hob-nob. In her\nspiritual make-up there is none of that subtle gosh-awfulness which\nrenders such an exhibit as, say, my Aunt Agatha the curse of the Home\nCounties and a menace to one and all. I have the highest esteem for Aunt\nDahlia, and have never wavered in my cordial appreciation of her\nhumanity, sporting qualities and general good-eggishness.\n\nThis being so, you may conceive of my astonishment at finding her at my\nbedside at such an hour. I mean to say, I've stayed at her place many a\ntime and oft, and she knows my habits. She is well aware that until I\nhave had my cup of tea in the morning, I do not receive. This crashing in\nat a moment when she knew that solitude and repose were of the essence\nwas scarcely, I could not but feel, the good old form.\n\nBesides, what business had she being in London at all? That was what I\nasked myself. When a conscientious housewife has returned to her home\nafter an absence of seven weeks, one does not expect her to start racing\noff again the day after her arrival. One feels that she ought to be\nsticking round, ministering to her husband, conferring with the cook,\nfeeding the cat, combing and brushing the Pomeranian--in a word, staying\nput. I was more than a little bleary-eyed, but I endeavoured, as far as\nthe fact that my eyelids were more or less glued together would permit,\nto give her an austere and censorious look.\n\nShe didn't seem to get it.\n\n\"Wake up, Bertie, you old ass!\" she cried, in a voice that hit me between\nthe eyebrows and went out at the back of my head.\n\nIf Aunt Dahlia has a fault, it is that she is apt to address a _vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis_\nas if he were somebody half a mile away whom she had observed riding\nover hounds. A throwback, no doubt, to the time when she counted the day\nlost that was not spent in chivvying some unfortunate fox over the\ncountryside.\n\nI gave her another of the austere and censorious, and this time it\nregistered. All the effect it had, however, was to cause her to descend\nto personalities.\n\n\"Don't blink at me in that obscene way,\" she said. \"I wonder, Bertie,\"\nshe proceeded, gazing at me as I should imagine Gussie would have gazed\nat some newt that was not up to sample, \"if you have the faintest\nconception how perfectly loathsome you look? A cross between an orgy\nscene in the movies and some low form of pond life. I suppose you were\nout on the tiles last night?\"\n\n\"I attended a social function, yes,\" I said coldly. \"Pongo Twistleton's\nbirthday party. I couldn't let Pongo down. _Noblesse oblige_.\"\n\n\"Well, get up and dress.\"\n\nI felt I could not have heard her aright.\n\n\"Get up and dress?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI turned on the pillow with a little moan, and at this juncture Jeeves\nentered with the vital oolong. I clutched at it like a drowning man at a\nstraw hat. A deep sip or two, and I felt--I won't say restored, because a\nbirthday party like Pongo Twistleton's isn't a thing you get restored\nafter with a mere mouthful of tea, but sufficiently the old Bertram to be\nable to bend the mind on this awful thing which had come upon me.\n\nAnd the more I bent same, the less could I grasp the trend of the\nscenario.\n\n\"What is this, Aunt Dahlia?\" I inquired.\n\n\"It looks to me like tea,\" was her response. \"But you know best. You're\ndrinking it.\"\n\nIf I hadn't been afraid of spilling the healing brew, I have little doubt\nthat I should have given an impatient gesture. I know I felt like it.\n\n\"Not the contents of this cup. All this. Your barging in and telling me\nto get up and dress, and all that rot.\"\n\n\"I've barged in, as you call it, because my telegrams seemed to produce\nno effect. And I told you to get up and dress because I want you to get\nup and dress. I've come to take you back with me. I like your crust,\nwiring that you would come next year or whenever it was. You're coming\nnow. I've got a job for you.\"\n\n\"But I don't want a job.\"\n\n\"What you want, my lad, and what you're going to get are two very\ndifferent things. There is man's work for you to do at Brinkley Court. Be\nready to the last button in twenty minutes.\"\n\n\"But I can't possibly be ready to any buttons in twenty minutes. I'm\nfeeling awful.\"\n\nShe seemed to consider.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"I suppose it's only humane to give you a day or two to\nrecover. All right, then, I shall expect you on the thirtieth at the\nlatest.\"\n\n\"But, dash it, what is all this? How do you mean, a job? Why a job? What\nsort of a job?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you if you'll only stop talking for a minute. It's quite an\neasy, pleasant job. You will enjoy it. Have you ever heard of Market\nSnodsbury Grammar School?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"It's a grammar school at Market Snodsbury.\"\n\nI told her a little frigidly that I had divined as much.\n\n\"Well, how was I to know that a man with a mind like yours would grasp it\nso quickly?\" she protested. \"All right, then. Market Snodsbury Grammar\nSchool is, as you have guessed, the grammar school at Market Snodsbury.\nI'm one of the governors.\"\n\n\"You mean one of the governesses.\"\n\n\"I don't mean one of the governesses. Listen, ass. There was a board of\ngovernors at Eton, wasn't there? Very well. So there is at Market\nSnodsbury Grammar School, and I'm a member of it. And they left the\narrangements for the summer prize-giving to me. This prize-giving takes\nplace on the last--or thirty-first--day of this month. Have you got that\nclear?\"\n\nI took another oz. of the life-saving and inclined my head. Even after a\nPongo Twistleton birthday party, I was capable of grasping simple facts\nlike these.\n\n\"I follow you, yes. I see the point you are trying to make, certainly.\nMarket ... Snodsbury ... Grammar School ... Board of governors ...\nPrize-giving.... Quite. But what's it got to do with me?\"\n\n\"You're going to give away the prizes.\"\n\nI goggled. Her words did not appear to make sense. They seemed the mere\naimless vapouring of an aunt who has been sitting out in the sun without\na hat.\n\n\"Me?\"\n\n\"You.\"\n\nI goggled again.\n\n\"You don't mean me?\"\n\n\"I mean you in person.\"\n\nI goggled a third time.\n\n\"You're pulling my leg.\"\n\n\"I am not pulling your leg. Nothing would induce me to touch your beastly\nleg. The vicar was to have officiated, but when I got home I found a\nletter from him saying that he had strained a fetlock and must scratch\nhis nomination. You can imagine the state I was in. I telephoned all over\nthe place. Nobody would take it on. And then suddenly I thought of you.\"\n\nI decided to check all this rot at the outset. Nobody is more eager to\noblige deserving aunts than Bertram Wooster, but there are limits, and\nsharply defined limits, at that.\n\n\"So you think I'm going to strew prizes at this bally Dotheboys Hall of\nyours?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"And make a speech?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\nI laughed derisively.\n\n\"For goodness' sake, don't start gargling now. This is serious.\"\n\n\"I was laughing.\"\n\n\"Oh, were you? Well, I'm glad to see you taking it in this merry spirit.\"\n\n\"Derisively,\" I explained. \"I won't do it. That's final. I simply will\nnot do it.\"\n\n\"You will do it, young Bertie, or never darken my doors again. And you\nknow what that means. No more of Anatole's dinners for you.\"\n\nA strong shudder shook me. She was alluding to her _chef_, that superb\nartist. A monarch of his profession, unsurpassed--nay, unequalled--at\ndishing up the raw material so that it melted in the mouth of the\nultimate consumer, Anatole had always been a magnet that drew me to\nBrinkley Court with my tongue hanging out. Many of my happiest moments\nhad been those which I had spent champing this great man's roasts and\nragouts, and the prospect of being barred from digging into them in the\nfuture was a numbing one.\n\n\"No, I say, dash it!\"\n\n\"I thought that would rattle you. Greedy young pig.\"\n\n\"Greedy young pigs have nothing to do with it,\" I said with a touch of\nhauteur. \"One is not a greedy young pig because one appreciates the\ncooking of a genius.\"\n\n\"Well, I will say I like it myself,\" conceded the relative. \"But not\nanother bite of it do you get, if you refuse to do this simple, easy,\npleasant job. No, not so much as another sniff. So put that in your\ntwelve-inch cigarette-holder and smoke it.\"\n\nI began to feel like some wild thing caught in a snare.\n\n\"But why do you want me? I mean, what am I? Ask yourself that.\"\n\n\"I often have.\"\n\n\"I mean to say, I'm not the type. You have to have some terrific nib to\ngive away prizes. I seem to remember, when I was at school, it was\ngenerally a prime minister or somebody.\"\n\n\"Ah, but that was at Eton. At Market Snodsbury we aren't nearly so\nchoosy. Anybody in spats impresses us.\"\n\n\"Why don't you get Uncle Tom?\"\n\n\"Uncle Tom!\"\n\n\"Well, why not? He's got spats.\"\n\n\"Bertie,\" she said, \"I will tell you why not Uncle Tom. You remember me\nlosing all that money at baccarat at Cannes? Well, very shortly I shall\nhave to sidle up to Tom and break the news to him. If, right after that,\nI ask him to put on lavender gloves and a topper and distribute the\nprizes at Market Snodsbury Grammar School, there will be a divorce in the\nfamily. He would pin a note to the pincushion and be off like a rabbit.\nNo, my lad, you're for it, so you may as well make the best of it.\"\n\n\"But, Aunt Dahlia, listen to reason. I assure you, you've got hold of the\nwrong man. I'm hopeless at a game like that. Ask Jeeves about the time I\ngot lugged in to address a girls' school. I made the most colossal ass of\nmyself.\"\n\n\"And I confidently anticipate that you will make an equally colossal ass\nof yourself on the thirty-first of this month. That's why I want you. The\nway I look at it is that, as the thing is bound to be a frost, anyway,\none may as well get a hearty laugh out of it. I shall enjoy seeing you\ndistribute those prizes, Bertie. Well, I won't keep you, as, no doubt,\nyou want to do your Swedish exercises. I shall expect you in a day or\ntwo.\"\n\nAnd with these heartless words she beetled off, leaving me a prey to the\ngloomiest emotions. What with the natural reaction after Pongo's party\nand this stunning blow, it is not too much to say that the soul was\nseared.\n\nAnd I was still writhing in the depths, when the door opened and Jeeves\nappeared.\n\n\"Mr. Fink-Nottle to see you, sir,\" he announced.\n\n\n\n-5-\n\n\nI gave him one of my looks.\n\n\"Jeeves,\" I said, \"I had scarcely expected this of you. You are aware\nthat I was up to an advanced hour last night. You know that I have barely\nhad my tea. You cannot be ignorant of the effect of that hearty voice of\nAunt Dahlia's on a man with a headache. And yet you come bringing me\nFink-Nottles. Is this a time for Fink or any other kind of Nottle?\"\n\n\"But did you not give me to understand, sir, that you wished to see Mr.\nFink-Nottle to advise him on his affairs?\"\n\nThis, I admit, opened up a new line of thought. In the stress of my\nemotions, I had clean forgotten about having taken Gussie's interests in\nhand. It altered things. One can't give the raspberry to a client. I\nmean, you didn't find Sherlock Holmes refusing to see clients just\nbecause he had been out late the night before at Doctor Watson's birthday\nparty. I could have wished that the man had selected some more suitable\nhour for approaching me, but as he appeared to be a sort of human lark,\nleaving his watery nest at daybreak, I supposed I had better give him an\naudience.\n\n\"True,\" I said. \"All right. Bung him in.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\n\"But before doing so, bring me one of those pick-me-ups of yours.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\nAnd presently he returned with the vital essence.\n\nI have had occasion, I fancy, to speak before now of these pick-me-ups of\nJeeves's and their effect on a fellow who is hanging to life by a thread\non the morning after. What they consist of, I couldn't tell you. He says\nsome kind of sauce, the yolk of a raw egg and a dash of red pepper, but\nnothing will convince me that the thing doesn't go much deeper than that.\nBe that as it may, however, the results of swallowing one are amazing.\n\nFor perhaps the split part of a second nothing happens. It is as though\nall Nature waited breathless. Then, suddenly, it is as if the Last Trump\nhad sounded and Judgment Day set in with unusual severity.\n\nBonfires burst out in all in parts of the frame. The abdomen becomes heavily\ncharged with molten lava. A great wind seems to blow through the world,\nand the subject is aware of something resembling a steam hammer striking\nthe back of the head. During this phase, the ears ring loudly, the\neyeballs rotate and there is a tingling about the brow.\n\nAnd then, just as you are feeling that you ought to ring up your lawyer\nand see that your affairs are in order before it is too late, the whole\nsituation seems to clarify. The wind drops. The ears cease to ring. Birds\ntwitter. Brass bands start playing. The sun comes up over the horizon\nwith a jerk.\n\nAnd a moment later all you are conscious of is a great peace.\n\nAs I drained the glass now, new life seemed to burgeon within me. I\nremember Jeeves, who, however much he may go off the rails at times in\nthe matter of dress clothes and in his advice to those in love, has\nalways had a neat turn of phrase, once speaking of someone rising on\nstepping-stones of his dead self to higher things. It was that way with\nme now. I felt that the Bertram Wooster who lay propped up against the\npillows had become a better, stronger, finer Bertram.\n\n\"Thank you, Jeeves,\" I said.\n\n\"Not at all, sir.\"\n\n\"That touched the exact spot. I am now able to cope with life's\nproblems.\"\n\n\"I am gratified to hear it, sir.\"\n\n\"What madness not to have had one of those before tackling Aunt Dahlia!\nHowever, too late to worry about that now. Tell me of Gussie. How did he\nmake out at the fancy-dress ball?\"\n\n\"He did not arrive at the fancy-dress ball, sir.\"\n\nI looked at him a bit austerely.\n\n\"Jeeves,\" I said, \"I admit that after that pick-me-up of yours I feel\nbetter, but don't try me too high. Don't stand by my sick bed talking\nabsolute rot. We shot Gussie into a cab and he started forth, headed for\nwherever this fancy-dress ball was. He must have arrived.\"\n\n\"No, sir. As I gather from Mr. Fink-Nottle, he entered the cab convinced\nin his mind that the entertainment to which he had been invited was to be\nheld at No. 17, Suffolk Square, whereas the actual rendezvous was No. 71,\nNorfolk Terrace. These aberrations of memory are not uncommon with those\nwho, like Mr. Fink-Nottle, belong essentially to what one might call the\ndreamer-type.\"\n\n\"One might also call it the fatheaded type.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"On reaching No. 17, Suffolk Square, Mr. Fink-Nottle endeavoured to\nproduce money to pay the fare.\"\n\n\"What stopped him?\"\n\n\"The fact that he had no money, sir. He discovered that he had left it,\ntogether with his ticket of invitation, on the mantelpiece of his\nbedchamber in the house of his uncle, where he was residing. Bidding the\ncabman to wait, accordingly, he rang the door-bell, and when the butler\nappeared, requested him to pay the cab, adding that it was all right, as\nhe was one of the guests invited to the dance. The butler then disclaimed\nall knowledge of a dance on the premises.\"\n\n\"And declined to unbelt?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Upon which----\"\n\n\"Mr. Fink-Nottle directed the cabman to drive him back to his uncle's\nresidence.\"\n\n\"Well, why wasn't that the happy ending? All he had to do was go in,\ncollect cash and ticket, and there he would have been, on velvet.\"\n\n\"I should have mentioned, sir, that Mr. Fink-Nottle had also left his\nlatchkey on the mantelpiece of his bedchamber.\"\n\n\"He could have rung the bell.\"\n\n\"He did ring the bell, sir, for some fifteen minutes. At the expiration\nof that period he recalled that he had given permission to the\ncaretaker--the house was officially closed and all the staff on\nholiday--to visit his sailor son at Portsmouth.\"\n\n\"Golly, Jeeves!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"These dreamer types do live, don't they?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"What happened then?\"\n\n\"Mr. Fink-Nottle appears to have realized at this point that his position\nas regards the cabman had become equivocal. The figures on the clock had\nalready reached a substantial sum, and he was not in a position to meet\nhis obligations.\"\n\n\"He could have explained.\"\n\n\"You cannot explain to cabmen, sir. On endeavouring to do so, he found\nthe fellow sceptical of his bona fides.\"\n\n\"I should have legged it.\"\n\n\"That is the policy which appears to have commended itself to Mr.\nFink-Nottle. He darted rapidly away, and the cabman, endeavouring to detain\nhim, snatched at his overcoat. Mr. Fink-Nottle contrived to extricate\nhimself from the coat, and it would seem that his appearance in the\nmasquerade costume beneath it came as something of a shock to the cabman.\nMr. Fink-Nottle informs me that he heard a species of whistling gasp,\nand, looking round, observed the man crouching against the railings with\nhis hands over his face. Mr. Fink-Nottle thinks he was praying. No doubt\nan uneducated, superstitious fellow, sir. Possibly a drinker.\"\n\n\"Well, if he hadn't been one before, I'll bet he started being one\nshortly afterwards. I expect he could scarcely wait for the pubs to\nopen.\"\n\n\"Very possibly, in the circumstances he might have found a restorative\nagreeable, sir.\"\n\n\"And so, in the circumstances, might Gussie too, I should think. What on\nearth did he do after that? London late at night--or even in the daytime,\nfor that matter--is no place for a man in scarlet tights.\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"He invites comment.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I can see the poor old bird ducking down side-streets, skulking in\nalley-ways, diving into dust-bins.\"\n\n\"I gathered from Mr. Fink-Nottle's remarks, sir, that something very much\non those lines was what occurred. Eventually, after a trying night, he\nfound his way to Mr. Sipperley's residence, where he was able to secure\nlodging and a change of costume in the morning.\"\n\nI nestled against the pillows, the brow a bit drawn. It is all very well\nto try to do old school friends a spot of good, but I could not but feel\nthat in espousing the cause of a lunkhead capable of mucking things up as\nGussie had done, I had taken on a contract almost too big for human\nconsumption. It seemed to me that what Gussie needed was not so much the\nadvice of a seasoned man of the world as a padded cell in Colney Hatch\nand a couple of good keepers to see that he did not set the place on\nfire.\n\nIndeed, for an instant I had half a mind to withdraw from the case and\nhand it back to Jeeves. But the pride of the Woosters restrained me. When\nwe Woosters put our hands to the plough, we do not readily sheathe the\nsword. Besides, after that business of the mess-jacket, anything\nresembling weakness would have been fatal.\n\n\"I suppose you realize, Jeeves,\" I said, for though one dislikes to rub\nit in, these things have to be pointed out, \"that all this was your\nfault?\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"It's no good saying 'Sir?' You know it was. If you had not insisted on\nhis going to that dance--a mad project, as I spotted from the first--this\nwould not have happened.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, but I confess I did not anticipate----\"\n\n\"Always anticipate everything, Jeeves,\" I said, a little sternly. \"It is\nthe only way. Even if you had allowed him to wear a Pierrot costume,\nthings would not have panned out as they did. A Pierrot costume has\npockets. However,\" I went on more kindly, \"we need not go into that now.\nIf all this has shown you what comes of going about the place in scarlet\ntights, that is something gained. Gussie waits without, you say?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Then shoot him in, and I will see what I can do for him.\"\n\n\n\n-6-\n\n\nGussie, on arrival, proved to be still showing traces of his grim\nexperience. The face was pale, the eyes gooseberry-like, the ears\ndrooping, and the whole aspect that of a man who has passed through the\nfurnace and been caught in the machinery. I hitched myself up a bit\nhigher on the pillows and gazed at him narrowly. It was a moment, I could\nsee, when first aid was required, and I prepared to get down to cases.\n\n\"Well, Gussie.\"\n\n\"Hullo, Bertie.\"\n\n\"What ho.\"\n\n\"What ho.\"\n\nThese civilities concluded, I felt that the moment had come to touch\ndelicately on the past.\n\n\"I hear you've been through it a bit.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Thanks to Jeeves.\"\n\n\"It wasn't Jeeves's fault.\"\n\n\"Entirely Jeeves's fault.\"\n\n\"I don't see that. I forgot my money and latchkey----\"\n\n\"And now you'd better forget Jeeves. For you will be interested to hear,\nGussie,\" I said, deeming it best to put him in touch with the position of\naffairs right away, \"that he is no longer handling your little problem.\"\n\nThis seemed to slip it across him properly. The jaws fell, the ears\ndrooped more limply. He had been looking like a dead fish. He now looked\nlike a deader fish, one of last year's, cast up on some lonely beach and\nleft there at the mercy of the wind and tides.\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You don't mean that Jeeves isn't going to----\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"But, dash it----\"\n\nI was kind, but firm.\n\n\"You will be much better off without him. Surely your terrible\nexperiences of that awful night have told you that Jeeves needs a rest.\nThe keenest of thinkers strikes a bad patch occasionally. That is what\nhas happened to Jeeves. I have seen it coming on for some time. He has\nlost his form. He wants his plugs decarbonized. No doubt this is a shock\nto you. I suppose you came here this morning to seek his advice?\"\n\n\"Of course I did.\"\n\n\"On what point?\"\n\n\"Madeline Bassett has gone to stay with these people in the country, and\nI want to know what he thinks I ought to do.\"\n\n\"Well, as I say, Jeeves is off the case.\"\n\n\"But, Bertie, dash it----\"\n\n\"Jeeves,\" I said with a certain asperity, \"is no longer on the case. I am\nnow in sole charge.\"\n\n\"But what on earth can you do?\"\n\nI curbed my resentment. We Woosters are fair-minded. We can make\nallowances for men who have been parading London all night in scarlet\ntights.\n\n\"That,\" I said quietly, \"we shall see. Sit down and let us confer. I am\nbound to say the thing seems quite simple to me. You say this girl has\ngone to visit friends in the country. It would appear obvious that you\nmust go there too, and flock round her like a poultice. Elementary.\"\n\n\"But I can't plant myself on a lot of perfect strangers.\"\n\n\"Don't you know these people?\"\n\n\"Of course I don't. I don't know anybody.\"\n\nI pursed the lips. This did seem to complicate matters somewhat.\n\n\"All that I know is that their name is Travers, and it's a place called\nBrinkley Court down in Worcestershire.\"\n\nI unpursed my lips.\n\n\"Gussie,\" I said, smiling paternally, \"it was a lucky day for you when\nBertram Wooster interested himself in your affairs. As I foresaw from the\nstart, I can fix everything. This afternoon you shall go to Brinkley\nCourt, an honoured guest.\"\n\nHe quivered like a _mousse_. I suppose it must always be rather a\nthrilling experience for the novice to watch me taking hold.\n\n\"But, Bertie, you don't mean you know these Traverses?\"\n\n\"They are my Aunt Dahlia.\"\n\n\"My gosh!\"\n\n\"You see now,\" I pointed out, \"how lucky you were to get me behind you.\nYou go to Jeeves, and what does he do? He dresses you up in scarlet\ntights and one of the foulest false beards of my experience, and sends\nyou off to fancy-dress balls. Result, agony of spirit and no progress. I\nthen take over and put you on the right lines. Could Jeeves have got you\ninto Brinkley Court? Not a chance. Aunt Dahlia isn't his aunt. I merely\nmention these things.\"\n\n\"By Jove, Bertie, I don't know how to thank you.\"\n\n\"My dear chap!\"\n\n\"But, I say.\"\n\n\"Now what?\"\n\n\"What do I do when I get there?\"\n\n\"If you knew Brinkley Court, you would not ask that question. In those\nromantic surroundings you can't miss. Great lovers through the ages have\nfixed up the preliminary formalities at Brinkley. The place is simply ill\nwith atmosphere. You will stroll with the girl in the shady walks. You\nwill sit with her on the shady lawns. You will row on the lake with her.\nAnd gradually you will find yourself working up to a point where----\"\n\n\"By Jove, I believe you're right.\"\n\n\"Of course, I'm right. I've got engaged three times at Brinkley. No\nbusiness resulted, but the fact remains. And I went there without the\nfoggiest idea of indulging in the tender pash. I hadn't the slightest\nintention of proposing to anybody. Yet no sooner had I entered those\nromantic grounds than I found myself reaching out for the nearest girl in\nsight and slapping my soul down in front of her. It's something in the\nair.\"\n\n\"I see exactly what you mean. That's just what I want to be able to\ndo--work up to it. And in London--curse the place--everything's in such a\nrush that you don't get a chance.\"\n\n\"Quite. You see a girl alone for about five minutes a day, and if you\nwant to ask her to be your wife, you've got to charge into it as if you\nwere trying to grab the gold ring on a merry-go-round.\"\n\n\"That's right. London rattles one. I shall be a different man altogether\nin the country. What a bit of luck this Travers woman turning out to be\nyour aunt.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean, turning out to be my aunt. She has been my\naunt all along.\"\n\n\"I mean, how extraordinary that it should be your aunt that Madeline's\ngoing to stay with.\"\n\n\"Not at all. She and my Cousin Angela are close friends. At Cannes she\nwas with us all the time.\"\n\n\"Oh, you met Madeline at Cannes, did you? By Jove, Bertie,\" said the poor\nlizard devoutly, \"I wish I could have seen her at Cannes. How wonderful\nshe must have looked in beach pyjamas! Oh, Bertie----\"\n\n\"Quite,\" I said, a little distantly. Even when restored by one of\nJeeves's depth bombs, one doesn't want this sort of thing after a hard\nnight. I touched the bell and, when Jeeves appeared, requested him to\nbring me telegraph form and pencil. I then wrote a well-worded\ncommunication to Aunt Dahlia, informing her that I was sending my friend,\nAugustus Fink-Nottle, down to Brinkley today to enjoy her hospitality,\nand handed it to Gussie.\n\n\"Push that in at the first post office you pass,\" I said. \"She will find\nit waiting for her on her return.\"\n\nGussie popped along, flapping the telegram and looking like a close-up of\nJoan Crawford, and I turned to Jeeves and gave him a pr\u00c3\u00a9cis of my\noperations.\n\n\"Simple, you observe, Jeeves. Nothing elaborate.\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Nothing far-fetched. Nothing strained or bizarre. Just Nature's remedy.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"This is the attack as it should have been delivered. What do you call it\nwhen two people of opposite sexes are bunged together in close\nassociation in a secluded spot, meeting each other every day and seeing a\nlot of each other?\"\n\n\"Is 'propinquity' the word you wish, sir?\"\n\n\"It is. I stake everything on propinquity, Jeeves. Propinquity, in my\nopinion, is what will do the trick. At the moment, as you are aware,\nGussie is a mere jelly when in the presence. But ask yourself how he will\nfeel in a week or so, after he and she have been helping themselves to\nsausages out of the same dish day after day at the breakfast sideboard.\nCutting the same ham, ladling out communal kidneys and bacon--why----\"\n\nI broke off abruptly. I had had one of my ideas.\n\n\"Golly, Jeeves!\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"Here's an instance of how you have to think of everything. You heard me\nmention sausages, kidneys and bacon and ham.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, there must be nothing of that. Fatal. The wrong note entirely.\nGive me that telegraph form and pencil. I must warn Gussie without delay.\nWhat he's got to do is to create in this girl's mind the impression that\nhe is pining away for love of her. This cannot be done by wolfing\nsausages.\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Very well, then.\"\n\nAnd, taking form and _p._, I drafted the following:\n\n_Fink-Nottle\n\nBrinkley Court,\n\nMarket Snodsbury\n\nWorcestershire\n\nLay off the sausages. Avoid the ham. Bertie._\n\n\n\"Send that off, Jeeves, instanter.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\nI sank back on the pillows.\n\n\"Well, Jeeves,\" I said, \"you see how I am taking hold. You notice the\ngrip I am getting on this case. No doubt you realize now that it would\npay you to study my methods.\"\n\n\"No doubt, sir.\"\n\n\"And even now you aren't on to the full depths of the extraordinary\nsagacity I've shown. Do you know what brought Aunt Dahlia up here this\nmorning? She came to tell me I'd got to distribute the prizes at some\nbeastly seminary she's a governor of down at Market Snodsbury.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir? I fear you will scarcely find that a congenial task.\"\n\n\"Ah, but I'm not going to do it. I'm going to shove it off on to Gussie.\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"I propose, Jeeves, to wire to Aunt Dahlia saying that I can't get down,\nand suggesting that she unleashes him on these young Borstal inmates of\nhers in my stead.\"\n\n\"But if Mr. Fink-Nottle should decline, sir?\"\n\n\"Decline? Can you see him declining? Just conjure up the picture in your\nmind, Jeeves. Scene, the drawing-room at Brinkley; Gussie wedged into a\ncorner, with Aunt Dahlia standing over him making hunting noises. I put\nit to you, Jeeves, can you see him declining?\"\n\n\"Not readily, sir. I agree. Mrs. Travers is a forceful personality.\"\n\n\"He won't have a hope of declining. His only way out would be to slide\noff. And he can't slide off, because he wants to be with Miss Bassett.\nNo, Gussie will have to toe the line, and I shall be saved from a job at\nwhich I confess the soul shuddered. Getting up on a platform and\ndelivering a short, manly speech to a lot of foul school-kids! Golly,\nJeeves. I've been through that sort of thing once, what? You remember\nthat time at the girls' school?\"\n\n\"Very vividly, sir.\"\n\n\"What an ass I made of myself!\"\n\n\"Certainly I have seen you to better advantage, sir.\"\n\n\"I think you might bring me just one more of those dynamite specials of\nyours, Jeeves. This narrow squeak has made me come over all faint.\"\n\nI suppose it must have taken Aunt Dahlia three hours or so to get back to\nBrinkley, because it wasn't till well after lunch that her telegram\narrived. It read like a telegram that had been dispatched in a white-hot\nsurge of emotion some two minutes after she had read mine.\n\nAs follows:\n\n_Am taking legal advice to ascertain whether strangling an idiot nephew\ncounts as murder. If it doesn't look out for yourself. Consider your\nconduct frozen limit. What do you mean by planting your loathsome friends\non me like this? Do you think Brinkley Court is a leper colony or what is\nit? Who is this Spink-Bottle? Love. Travers._\n\nI had expected some such initial reaction. I replied in temperate vein:\n\n_Not Bottle. Nottle. Regards. Bertie._\n\nAlmost immediately after she had dispatched the above heart cry, Gussie\nmust have arrived, for it wasn't twenty minutes later when I received the\nfollowing:\n\n_Cipher telegram signed by you has reached me here. Runs \"Lay off the\nsausages. Avoid the ham.\" Wire key immediately. Fink-Nottle._\n\nI replied:\n\n_Also kidneys. Cheerio. Bertie._\n\nI had staked all on Gussie making a favourable impression on his hostess,\nbasing my confidence on the fact that he was one of those timid,\nobsequious, teacup-passing, thin-bread-and-butter-offering yes-men whom\nwomen of my Aunt Dahlia's type nearly always like at first sight. That I\nhad not overrated my acumen was proved by her next in order, which, I was\npleased to note, assayed a markedly larger percentage of the milk of\nhuman kindness.\n\nAs follows:\n\n_Well, this friend of yours has got here, and I must say that for a\nfriend of yours he seems less sub-human than I had expected. A bit of a\npop-eyed bleater, but on the whole clean and civil, and certainly most\ninformative about newts. Am considering arranging series of lectures for\nhim in neighbourhood. All the same I like your nerve using my house as a\nsummer-hotel resort and shall have much to say to you on subject when you\ncome down. Expect you thirtieth. Bring spats. Love. Travers._\n\nTo this I riposted:\n\n_On consulting engagement book find impossible come Brinkley Court.\nDeeply regret. Toodle-oo. Bertie._\n\nHers in reply stuck a sinister note:\n\n_Oh, so it's like that, is it? You and your engagement book, indeed.\nDeeply regret my foot. Let me tell you, my lad, that you will regret it a\njolly sight more deeply if you don't come down. If you imagine for one\nmoment that you are going to get out of distributing those prizes, you\nare very much mistaken. Deeply regret Brinkley Court hundred miles from\nLondon, as unable hit you with a brick. Love. Travers._\n\nI then put my fortune to the test, to win or lose it all. It was not a\nmoment for petty economies. I let myself go regardless of expense:\n\n_No, but dash it, listen. Honestly, you don't want me. Get Fink-Nottle\ndistribute prizes. A born distributor, who will do you credit.\nConfidently anticipate Augustus Fink-Nottle as Master of Revels on\nthirty-first inst. would make genuine sensation. Do not miss this great\nchance, which may never occur again. Tinkerty-tonk. Bertie._\n\nThere was an hour of breathless suspense, and then the joyful tidings\narrived:\n\n_Well, all right. Something in what you say, I suppose. Consider you\ntreacherous worm and contemptible, spineless cowardly custard, but have\nbooked Spink-Bottle. Stay where you are, then, and I hope you get run\nover by an omnibus. Love. Travers._\n\nThe relief, as you may well imagine, was stupendous. A great weight\nseemed to have rolled off my mind. It was as if somebody had been pouring\nJeeves's pick-me-ups into me through a funnel. I sang as I dressed for\ndinner that night. At the Drones I was so gay and cheery that there were\nseveral complaints. And when I got home and turned into the old bed, I\nfell asleep like a little child within five minutes of inserting the\nperson between the sheets. It seemed to me that the whole distressing\naffair might now be considered definitely closed.\n\nConceive my astonishment, therefore, when waking on the morrow and\nsitting up to dig into the morning tea-cup, I beheld on the tray another\ntelegram.\n\nMy heart sank. Could Aunt Dahlia have slept on it and changed her mind?\nCould Gussie, unable to face the ordeal confronting him, have legged it\nduring the night down a water-pipe? With these speculations racing\nthrough the bean, I tore open the envelope And as I noted contents I\nuttered a startled yip.\n\n\"Sir?\" said Jeeves, pausing at the door.\n\nI read the thing again. Yes, I had got the gist all right. No, I had not\nbeen deceived in the substance.\n\n\"Jeeves,\" I said, \"do you know what?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"You know my cousin Angela?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You know young Tuppy Glossop?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"They've broken off their engagement.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to hear that, sir.\"\n\n\"I have here a communication from Aunt Dahlia, specifically stating this.\nI wonder what the row was about.\"\n\n\"I could not say, sir.\"\n\n\"Of course you couldn't. Don't be an ass, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\nI brooded. I was deeply moved.\n\n\"Well, this means that we shall have to go down to Brinkley today. Aunt\nDahlia is obviously all of a twitter, and my place is by her side. You\nhad better pack this morning, and catch that 12.45 train with the\nluggage. I have a lunch engagement, so will follow in the car.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\nI brooded some more.\n\n\"I must say this has come as a great shock to me, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"No doubt, sir.\"\n\n\"A very great shock. Angela and Tuppy.... Tut, tut! Why, they seemed like\nthe paper on the wall. Life is full of sadness, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Still, there it is.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly, sir.\"\n\n\"Right ho, then. Switch on the bath.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\n\n\n-7-\n\n\nI meditated pretty freely as I drove down to Brinkley in the old\ntwo-seater that afternoon. The news of this rift or rupture of Angela's\nand Tuppy's had disturbed me greatly.\n\nThe projected match, you see, was one on which I had always looked with\nkindly approval. Too often, when a chap of your acquaintance is planning\nto marry a girl you know, you find yourself knitting the brow a bit and\nchewing the lower lip dubiously, feeling that he or she, or both, should\nbe warned while there is yet time.\n\nBut I have never felt anything of this nature about Tuppy and Angela.\nTuppy, when not making an ass of himself, is a soundish sort of egg. So\nis Angela a soundish sort of egg. And, as far as being in love was\nconcerned, it had always seemed to me that you wouldn't have been far out\nin describing them as two hearts that beat as one.\n\nTrue, they had had their little tiffs, notably on the occasion when\nTuppy--with what he said was fearless honesty and I considered thorough\ngoofiness--had told Angela that her new hat made her look like a\nPekingese. But in every romance you have to budget for the occasional\ndust-up, and after that incident I had supposed that he had learned his\nlesson and that from then on life would be one grand, sweet song.\n\nAnd now this wholly unforeseen severing of diplomatic relations had\npopped up through a trap.\n\nI gave the thing the cream of the Wooster brain all the way down, but it\ncontinued to beat me what could have caused the outbreak of hostilities,\nand I bunged my foot sedulously on the accelerator in order to get to\nAunt Dahlia with the greatest possible speed and learn the inside history\nstraight from the horse's mouth. And what with all six cylinders hitting\nnicely, I made good time and found myself closeted with the relative\nshortly before the hour of the evening cocktail.\n\nShe seemed glad to see me. In fact, she actually said she was glad to see\nme--a statement no other aunt on the list would have committed herself\nto, the customary reaction of these near and dear ones to the spectacle\nof Bertram arriving for a visit being a sort of sick horror.\n\n\"Decent of you to rally round, Bertie,\" she said.\n\n\"My place was by your side, Aunt Dahlia,\" I responded.\n\nI could see at a g. that the unfortunate affair had got in amongst her in\nno uncertain manner. Her usually cheerful map was clouded, and the genial\nsmile conspic. by its a. I pressed her hand sympathetically, to indicate\nthat my heart bled for her.\n\n\"Bad show this, my dear old flesh and blood,\" I said. \"I'm afraid you've\nbeen having a sticky time. You must be worried.\"\n\nShe snorted emotionally. She looked like an aunt who has just bitten into\na bad oyster.\n\n\"Worried is right. I haven't had a peaceful moment since I got back from\nCannes. Ever since I put my foot across this blasted threshold,\" said\nAunt Dahlia, returning for the nonce to the hearty _argot_ of the hunting\nfield, \"everything's been at sixes and sevens. First there was that mix-up\nabout the prize-giving.\"\n\nShe paused at this point and gave me a look. \"I had been meaning to speak\nfreely to you about your behaviour in that matter, Bertie,\" she said. \"I\nhad some good things all stored up. But, as you've rallied round like\nthis, I suppose I shall have to let you off. And, anyway, it is probably\nall for the best that you evaded your obligations in that sickeningly\ncraven way. I have an idea that this Spink-Bottle of yours is going to be\ngood. If only he can keep off newts.\"\n\n\"Has he been talking about newts?\"\n\n\"He has. Fixing me with a glittering eye, like the Ancient Mariner. But\nif that was the worst I had to bear, I wouldn't mind. What I'm worrying\nabout is what Tom says when he starts talking.\"\n\n\"Uncle Tom?\"\n\n\"I wish there was something else you could call him except 'Uncle Tom',\"\nsaid Aunt Dahlia a little testily. \"Every time you do it, I expect to see\nhim turn black and start playing the banjo. Yes, Uncle Tom, if you must\nhave it. I shall have to tell him soon about losing all that money at\nbaccarat, and, when I do, he will go up like a rocket.\"\n\n\"Still, no doubt Time, the great healer----\"\n\n\"Time, the great healer, be blowed. I've got to get a cheque for five\nhundred pounds out of him for _Milady's Boudoir_ by August the third at\nthe latest.\"\n\nI was concerned. Apart from a nephew's natural interest in an aunt's\nrefined weekly paper, I had always had a soft spot in my heart for\n_Milady's Boudoir_ ever since I contributed that article to it on What\nthe Well-Dressed Man is Wearing. Sentimental, possibly, but we old\njournalists do have these feelings.\n\n\"Is the _Boudoir_ on the rocks?\"\n\n\"It will be if Tom doesn't cough up. It needs help till it has turned the\ncorner.\"\n\n\"But wasn't it turning the corner two years ago?\"\n\n\"It was. And it's still at it. Till you've run a weekly paper for women,\nyou don't know what corners are.\"\n\n\"And you think the chances of getting into uncle--into my uncle by\nmarriage's ribs are slight?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you, Bertie. Up till now, when these subsidies were required,\nI have always been able to come to Tom in the gay, confident spirit of an\nonly child touching an indulgent father for chocolate cream. But he's\njust had a demand from the income-tax people for an additional fifty-eight\npounds, one and threepence, and all he's been talking about since I got\nback has been ruin and the sinister trend of socialistic legislation and\nwhat will become of us all.\"\n\nI could readily believe it. This Tom has a peculiarity I've noticed in\nother very oofy men. Nick him for the paltriest sum, and he lets out a\nsquawk you can hear at Land's End. He has the stuff in gobs, but he hates\ngiving up.\n\n\"If it wasn't for Anatole's cooking, I doubt if he would bother to carry\non. Thank God for Anatole, I say.\"\n\nI bowed my head reverently.\n\n\"Good old Anatole,\" I said.\n\n\"Amen,\" said Aunt Dahlia.\n\nThen the look of holy ecstasy, which is always the result of letting the\nmind dwell, however briefly, on Anatole's cooking, died out of her face.\n\n\"But don't let me wander from the subject,\" she resumed. \"I was telling\nyou of the way hell's foundations have been quivering since I got home.\nFirst the prize-giving, then Tom, and now, on top of everything else,\nthis infernal quarrel between Angela and young Glossop.\"\n\nI nodded gravely. \"I was frightfully sorry to hear of that. Terrible\nshock. What was the row about?\"\n\n\"Sharks.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"Sharks. Or, rather, one individual shark. The brute that went for the\npoor child when she was aquaplaning at Cannes. You remember Angela's\nshark?\"\n\nCertainly I remembered Angela's shark. A man of sensibility does not\nforget about a cousin nearly being chewed by monsters of the deep. The\nepisode was still green in my memory.\n\nIn a nutshell, what had occurred was this: You know how you aquaplane. A\nmotor-boat nips on ahead, trailing a rope. You stand on a board, holding\nthe rope, and the boat tows you along. And every now and then you lose\nyour grip on the rope and plunge into the sea and have to swim to your\nboard again.\n\nA silly process it has always seemed to me, though many find it\ndiverting.\n\nWell, on the occasion referred to, Angela had just regained her board\nafter taking a toss, when a great beastly shark came along and cannoned\ninto it, flinging her into the salty once more. It took her quite a bit\nof time to get on again and make the motor-boat chap realize what was up\nand haul her to safety, and during that interval you can readily picture\nher embarrassment.\n\nAccording to Angela, the finny denizen kept snapping at her ankles\nvirtually without cessation, so that by the time help arrived, she was\nfeeling more like a salted almond at a public dinner than anything human.\nVery shaken the poor child had been, I recall, and had talked of nothing\nelse for weeks.\n\n\"I remember the whole incident vividly,\" I said. \"But how did that start\nthe trouble?\"\n\n\"She was telling him the story last night.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Her eyes shining and her little hands clasped in girlish excitement.\"\n\n\"No doubt.\"\n\n\"And instead of giving her the understanding and sympathy to which she\nwas entitled, what do you think this blasted Glossop did? He sat\nlistening like a lump of dough, as if she had been talking about the\nweather, and when she had finished, he took his cigarette holder out of\nhis mouth and said, 'I expect it was only a floating log'!\"\n\n\"He didn't!\"\n\n\"He did. And when Angela described how the thing had jumped and snapped\nat her, he took his cigarette holder out of his mouth again, and said,\n'Ah! Probably a flatfish. Quite harmless. No doubt it was just trying to\nplay.' Well, I mean! What would you have done if you had been Angela? She\nhas pride, sensibility, all the natural feelings of a good woman. She\ntold him he was an ass and a fool and an idiot, and didn't know what he\nwas talking about.\"\n\nI must say I saw the girl's viewpoint. It's only about once in a lifetime\nthat anything sensational ever happens to one, and when it does, you\ndon't want people taking all the colour out of it. I remember at school\nhaving to read that stuff where that chap, Othello, tells the girl what a\nhell of a time he'd been having among the cannibals and what not. Well,\nimagine his feelings if, after he had described some particularly sticky\npassage with a cannibal chief and was waiting for the awestruck \"Oh-h!\nNot really?\", she had said that the whole thing had no doubt been greatly\nexaggerated and that the man had probably really been a prominent local\nvegetarian.\n\nYes, I saw Angela's point of view.\n\n\"But don't tell me that when he saw how shirty she was about it, the\nchump didn't back down?\"\n\n\"He didn't. He argued. And one thing led to another until, by easy\nstages, they had arrived at the point where she was saying that she\ndidn't know if he was aware of it, but if he didn't knock off starchy\nfoods and do exercises every morning, he would be getting as fat as a\npig, and he was talking about this modern habit of girls putting make-up\non their faces, of which he had always disapproved. This continued for a\nwhile, and then there was a loud pop and the air was full of mangled\nfragments of their engagement. I'm distracted about it. Thank goodness\nyou've come, Bertie.\"\n\n\"Nothing could have kept me away,\" I replied, touched. \"I felt you needed\nme.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Quite.\"\n\n\"Or, rather,\" she said, \"not you, of course, but Jeeves. The minute all\nthis happened, I thought of him. The situation obviously cries out for\nJeeves. If ever in the whole history of human affairs there was a moment\nwhen that lofty brain was required about the home, this is it.\"\n\nI think, if I had been standing up, I would have staggered. In fact, I'm\npretty sure I would. But it isn't so dashed easy to stagger when you're\nsitting in an arm-chair. Only my face, therefore, showed how deeply I had\nbeen stung by these words.\n\nUntil she spoke them, I had been all sweetness and light--the sympathetic\nnephew prepared to strain every nerve to do his bit. I now froze, and the\nface became hard and set.\n\n\"Jeeves!\" I said, between clenched teeth.\n\n\"Oom beroofen,\" said Aunt Dahlia.\n\nI saw that she had got the wrong angle.\n\n\"I was not sneezing. I was saying 'Jeeves!'\"\n\n\"And well you may. What a man! I'm going to put the whole thing up to\nhim. There's nobody like Jeeves.\"\n\nMy frigidity became more marked.\n\n\"I venture to take issue with you, Aunt Dahlia.\"\n\n\"You take what?\"\n\n\"Issue.\"\n\n\"You do, do you?\"\n\n\"I emphatically do. Jeeves is hopeless.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Quite hopeless. He has lost his grip completely. Only a couple of days\nago I was compelled to take him off a case because his handling of it was\nso footling. And, anyway, I resent this assumption, if assumption is the\nword I want, that Jeeves is the only fellow with brain. I object to the\nway everybody puts things up to him without consulting me and letting me\nhave a stab at them first.\"\n\nShe seemed about to speak, but I checked her with a gesture.\n\n\"It is true that in the past I have sometimes seen fit to seek Jeeves's\nadvice. It is possible that in the future I may seek it again. But I\nclaim the right to have a pop at these problems, as they arise, in\nperson, without having everybody behave as if Jeeves was the only onion\nin the hash. I sometimes feel that Jeeves, though admittedly not\nunsuccessful in the past, has been lucky rather than gifted.\"\n\n\"Have you and Jeeves had a row?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind.\"\n\n\"You seem to have it in for him.\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\nAnd yet I must admit that there was a modicum of truth in what she said.\nI had been feeling pretty austere about the man all day, and I'll tell\nyou why.\n\nYou remember that he caught that 12.45 train with the luggage, while I\nremained on in order to keep a luncheon engagement. Well, just before I\nstarted out to the tryst, I was pottering about the flat, and suddenly--I\ndon't know what put the suspicion into my head, possibly the fellow's\nmanner had been furtive--something seemed to whisper to me to go and have\na look in the wardrobe.\n\nAnd it was as I had suspected. There was the mess-jacket still on its\nhanger. The hound hadn't packed it.\n\nWell, as anybody at the Drones will tell you, Bertram Wooster is a pretty\nhard chap to outgeneral. I shoved the thing in a brown-paper parcel and\nput it in the back of the car, and it was on a chair in the hall now. But\nthat didn't alter the fact that Jeeves had attempted to do the dirty on\nme, and I suppose a certain what-d'you-call-it had crept into my manner\nduring the above remarks.\n\n\"There has been no breach,\" I said. \"You might describe it as a passing\ncoolness, but no more. We did not happen to see eye to eye with regard to\nmy white mess-jacket with the brass buttons and I was compelled to assert\nmy personality. But----\"\n\n\"Well, it doesn't matter, anyway. The thing that matters is that you are\ntalking piffle, you poor fish. Jeeves lost his grip? Absurd. Why, I saw\nhim for a moment when he arrived, and his eyes were absolutely glittering\nwith intelligence. I said to myself 'Trust Jeeves,' and I intend to.\"\n\n\"You would be far better advised to let me see what I can accomplish,\nAunt Dahlia.\"\n\n\"For heaven's sake, don't you start butting in. You'll only make matters\nworse.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, it may interest you to know that while driving here I\nconcentrated deeply on this trouble of Angela's and was successful in\nformulating a plan, based on the psychology of the individual, which I am\nproposing to put into effect at an early moment.\"\n\n\"Oh, my God!\"\n\n\"My knowledge of human nature tells me it will work.\"\n\n\"Bertie,\" said Aunt Dahlia, and her manner struck me as febrile, \"lay\noff, lay off! For pity's sake, lay off. I know these plans of yours. I\nsuppose you want to shove Angela into the lake and push young Glossop in\nafter her to save her life, or something like that.\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind.\"\n\n\"It's the sort of thing you would do.\"\n\n\"My scheme is far more subtle. Let me outline it for you.\"\n\n\"No, thanks.\"\n\n\"I say to myself----\"\n\n\"But not to me.\"\n\n\"Do listen for a second.\"\n\n\"I won't.\"\n\n\"Right ho, then. I am dumb.\"\n\n\"And have been from a child.\"\n\nI perceived that little good could result from continuing the discussion.\nI waved a hand and shrugged a shoulder.\n\n\"Very well, Aunt Dahlia,\" I said, with dignity, \"if you don't want to be\nin on the ground floor, that is your affair. But you are missing an\nintellectual treat. And, anyway, no matter how much you may behave like\nthe deaf adder of Scripture which, as you are doubtless aware, the more\none piped, the less it danced, or words to that effect, I shall carry on\nas planned. I am extremely fond of Angela, and I shall spare no effort to\nbring the sunshine back into her heart.\"\n\n\"Bertie, you abysmal chump, I appeal to you once more. Will you please\nlay off? You'll only make things ten times as bad as they are already.\"\n\nI remember reading in one of those historical novels once about a chap--a\nbuck he would have been, no doubt, or a macaroni or some such bird as\nthat--who, when people said the wrong thing, merely laughed down from\nlazy eyelids and flicked a speck of dust from the irreproachable Mechlin\nlace at his wrists. This was practically what I did now. At least, I\nstraightened my tie and smiled one of those inscrutable smiles of mine. I\nthen withdrew and went out for a saunter in the garden.\n\nAnd the first chap I ran into was young Tuppy. His brow was furrowed, and\nhe was moodily bunging stones at a flowerpot.\n\n\n\n-8-\n\n\nI think I have told you before about young Tuppy Glossop. He was the\nfellow, if you remember, who, callously ignoring the fact that we had\nbeen friends since boyhood, betted me one night at the Drones that I\ncould swing myself across the swimming bath by the rings--a childish feat\nfor one of my lissomeness--and then, having seen me well on the way,\nlooped back the last ring, thus rendering it necessary for me to drop\ninto the deep end in formal evening costume.\n\nTo say that I had not resented this foul deed, which seemed to me\ndeserving of the title of the crime of the century, would be paltering\nwith the truth. I had resented it profoundly, chafing not a little at the\ntime and continuing to chafe for some weeks.\n\nBut you know how it is with these things. The wound heals. The agony\nabates.\n\nI am not saying, mind you, that had the opportunity presented itself of\ndropping a wet sponge on Tuppy from some high spot or of putting an eel\nin his bed or finding some other form of self-expression of a like\nnature, I would not have embraced it eagerly; but that let me out. I mean\nto say, grievously injured though I had been, it gave me no pleasure to\nfeel that the fellow's bally life was being ruined by the loss of a girl\nwhom, despite all that had passed, I was convinced he still loved like\nthe dickens.\n\nOn the contrary, I was heart and soul in favour of healing the breach and\nrendering everything hotsy-totsy once more between these two young\nsundered blighters. You will have gleaned that from my remarks to Aunt\nDahlia, and if you had been present at this moment and had seen the\nkindly commiserating look I gave Tuppy, you would have gleaned it still\nmore.\n\nIt was one of those searching, melting looks, and was accompanied by the\nhearty clasp of the right hand and the gentle laying of the left on the\ncollar-bone.\n\n\"Well, Tuppy, old man,\" I said. \"How are you, old man?\"\n\nMy commiseration deepened as I spoke the words, for there had been no\nlighting up of the eye, no answering pressure of the palm, no sign\nwhatever, in short, of any disposition on his part to do Spring dances at\nthe sight of an old friend. The man seemed sandbagged. Melancholy, as I\nremember Jeeves saying once about Pongo Twistleton when he was trying to\nknock off smoking, had marked him for her own. Not that I was surprised,\nof course. In the circs., no doubt, a certain moodiness was only natural.\n\nI released the hand, ceased to knead the shoulder, and, producing the old\ncase, offered him a cigarette.\n\nHe took it dully.\n\n\"Are you here, Bertie?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, I'm here.\"\n\n\"Just passing through, or come to stay?\"\n\nI thought for a moment. I might have told him that I had arrived at\nBrinkley Court with the express intention of bringing Angela and himself\ntogether once more, of knitting up the severed threads, and so on and so\nforth; and for perhaps half the time required for the lighting of a\ngasper I had almost decided to do so. Then, I reflected, better, on the\nwhole, perhaps not. To broadcast the fact that I proposed to take him and\nAngela and play on them as on a couple of stringed instruments might have\nbeen injudicious. Chaps don't always like being played on as on a\nstringed instrument.\n\n\"It all depends,\" I said. \"I may remain. I may push on. My plans are\nuncertain.\"\n\nHe nodded listlessly, rather in the manner of a man who did not give a\ndamn what I did, and stood gazing out over the sunlit garden. In build\nand appearance, Tuppy somewhat resembles a bulldog, and his aspect now\nwas that of one of these fine animals who has just been refused a slice\nof cake. It was not difficult for a man of my discernment to read what\nwas in his mind, and it occasioned me no surprise, therefore, when his\nnext words had to do with the subject marked with a cross on the agenda\npaper.\n\n\"You've heard of this business of mine, I suppose? Me and Angela?\"\n\n\"I have, indeed, Tuppy, old man.\"\n\n\"We've bust up.\"\n\n\"I know. Some little friction, I gather, _in re_ Angela's shark.\"\n\n\"Yes. I said it must have been a flatfish.\"\n\n\"So my informant told me.\"\n\n\"Who did you hear it from?\"\n\n\"Aunt Dahlia.\"\n\n\"I suppose she cursed me properly?\"\n\n\"Oh, no.\"\n\n\"Beyond referring to you in one passage as 'this blasted Glossop', she\nwas, I thought, singularly temperate in her language for a woman who at\none time hunted regularly with the Quorn. All the same, I could see, if\nyou don't mind me saying so, old man, that she felt you might have\nbehaved with a little more tact.\"\n\n\"Tact!\"\n\n\"And I must admit I rather agreed with her. Was it nice, Tuppy, was it\nquite kind to take the bloom off Angela's shark like that? You must\nremember that Angela's shark is very dear to her. Could you not see what\na sock on the jaw it would be for the poor child to hear it described by\nthe man to whom she had given her heart as a flatfish?\"\n\nI saw that he was struggling with some powerful emotion.\n\n\"And what about my side of the thing?\" he demanded, in a voice choked\nwith feeling.\n\n\"Your side?\"\n\n\"You don't suppose,\" said Tuppy, with rising vehemence, \"that I would\nhave exposed this dashed synthetic shark for the flatfish it undoubtedly\nwas if there had not been causes that led up to it. What induced me to\nspeak as I did was the fact that Angela, the little squirt, had just been\nmost offensive, and I seized the opportunity to get a bit of my own\nback.\"\n\n\"Offensive?\"\n\n\"Exceedingly offensive. Purely on the strength of my having let fall some\ncasual remark--simply by way of saying something and keeping the\nconversation going--to the effect that I wondered what Anatole was going\nto give us for dinner, she said that I was too material and ought not\nalways to be thinking of food. Material, my elbow! As a matter of fact,\nI'm particularly spiritual.\"\n\n\"Quite.\"\n\n\"I don't see any harm in wondering what Anatole was going to give us for\ndinner. Do you?\"\n\n\"Of course not. A mere ordinary tribute of respect to a great artist.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"All the same----\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I was only going to say that it seems a pity that the frail craft of\nlove should come a stinker like this when a few manly words of\ncontrition----\"\n\nHe stared at me.\n\n\"You aren't suggesting that I should climb down?\"\n\n\"It would be the fine, big thing, old egg.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't dream of climbing down.\"\n\n\"But, Tuppy----\"\n\n\"No. I wouldn't do it.\"\n\n\"But you love her, don't you?\"\n\nThis touched the spot. He quivered noticeably, and his mouth twisted.\nQuite the tortured soul.\n\n\"I'm not saying I don't love the little blighter,\" he said, obviously\nmoved. \"I love her passionately. But that doesn't alter the fact that I\nconsider that what she needs most in this world is a swift kick in the\npants.\"\n\nA Wooster could scarcely pass this. \"Tuppy, old man!\"\n\n\"It's no good saying 'Tuppy, old man'.\"\n\n\"Well, I do say 'Tuppy, old man'. Your tone shocks me. One raises the\neyebrows. Where is the fine, old, chivalrous spirit of the Glossops.\"\n\n\"That's all right about the fine, old, chivalrous spirit of the Glossops.\nWhere is the sweet, gentle, womanly spirit of the Angelas? Telling a\nfellow he was getting a double chin!\"\n\n\"Did she do that?\"\n\n\"She did.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, girls will be girls. Forget it, Tuppy. Go to her and make it\nup.\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"No. It is too late. Remarks have been passed about my tummy which it is\nimpossible to overlook.\"\n\n\"But, Tummy--Tuppy, I mean--be fair. You once told her her new hat made\nher look like a Pekingese.\"\n\n\"It did make her look like a Pekingese. That was not vulgar abuse. It was\nsound, constructive criticism, with no motive behind it but the kindly\ndesire to keep her from making an exhibition of herself in public.\nWantonly to accuse a man of puffing when he goes up a flight of stairs\nis something very different.\"\n\nI began to see that the situation would require all my address and\ningenuity. If the wedding bells were ever to ring out in the little\nchurch of Market Snodsbury, Bertram had plainly got to put in some\nshrewdish work. I had gathered, during my conversation with Aunt Dahlia,\nthat there had been a certain amount of frank speech between the two\ncontracting parties, but I had not realized till now that matters had\ngone so far.\n\nThe pathos of the thing gave me the pip. Tuppy had admitted in so many\nwords that love still animated the Glossop bosom, and I was convinced\nthat, even after all that occurred, Angela had not ceased to love him. At\nthe moment, no doubt, she might be wishing that she could hit him with a\nbottle, but deep down in her I was prepared to bet that there still\nlingered all the old affection and tenderness. Only injured pride was\nkeeping these two apart, and I felt that if Tuppy would make the first\nmove, all would be well.\n\nI had another whack at it.\n\n\"She's broken-hearted about this rift, Tuppy.\"\n\n\"How do you know? Have you seen her?\"\n\n\"No, but I'll bet she is.\"\n\n\"She doesn't look it.\"\n\n\"Wearing the mask, no doubt. Jeeves does that when I assert my\nauthority.\"\n\n\"She wrinkles her nose at me as if I were a drain that had got out of\norder.\"\n\n\"Merely the mask. I feel convinced she loves you still, and that a kindly\nword from you is all that is required.\"\n\nI could see that this had moved him. He plainly wavered. He did a sort of\ntwiddly on the turf with his foot. And, when he spoke, one spotted the\ntremolo in the voice:\n\n\"You really think that?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\n\"H'm.\"\n\n\"If you were to go to her----\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"I can't do that. It would be fatal. Bing, instantly, would go my\nprestige. I know girls. Grovel, and the best of them get uppish.\" He\nmused. \"The only way to work the thing would be by tipping her off in\nsome indirect way that I am prepared to open negotiations. Should I sigh\na bit when we meet, do you think?\"\n\n\"She would think you were puffing.\"\n\n\"That's true.\"\n\nI lit another cigarette and gave my mind to the matter. And first crack\nout of the box, as is so often the way with the Woosters, I got an idea.\nI remembered the counsel I had given Gussie in the matter of the sausages\nand ham.\n\n\"I've got it, Tuppy. There is one infallible method of indicating to a\ngirl that you love her, and it works just as well when you've had a row\nand want to make it up. Don't eat any dinner tonight. You can see how\nimpressive that would be. She knows how devoted you are to food.\"\n\nHe started violently.\n\n\"I am not devoted to food!\"\n\n\"No, no.\"\n\n\"I am not devoted to food at all.\"\n\n\"Quite. All I meant----\"\n\n\"This rot about me being devoted to food,\" said Tuppy warmly, \"has got to\nstop. I am young and healthy and have a good appetite, but that's not the\nsame as being devoted to food. I admire Anatole as a master of his craft,\nand am always willing to consider anything he may put before me, but when\nyou say I am devoted to food----\"\n\n\"Quite, quite. All I meant was that if she sees you push away your dinner\nuntasted, she will realize that your heart is aching, and will probably\nbe the first to suggest blowing the all clear.\"\n\nTuppy was frowning thoughtfully.\n\n\"Push my dinner away, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Push away a dinner cooked by Anatole?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Push it away untasted?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Let us get this straight. Tonight, at dinner, when the butler offers me\na _ris de veau \u00c3\u00a0 la financiere_, or whatever it may be, hot from\nAnatole's hands, you wish me to push it away untasted?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe chewed his lip. One could sense the struggle going on within. And then\nsuddenly a sort of glow came into his face. The old martyrs probably used\nto look like that.\n\n\"All right.\"\n\n\"You'll do it?\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n\"Fine.\"\n\n\"Of course, it will be agony.\"\n\nI pointed out the silver lining.\n\n\"Only for the moment. You could slip down tonight, after everyone is in\nbed, and raid the larder.\"\n\nHe brightened.\n\n\"That's right. I could, couldn't I?\"\n\n\"I expect there would be something cold there.\"\n\n\"There is something cold there,\" said Tuppy, with growing cheerfulness. \"A\nsteak-and-kidney pie. We had it for lunch today. One of Anatole's ripest.\nThe thing I admire about that man,\" said Tuppy reverently, \"the thing\nthat I admire so enormously about Anatole is that, though a Frenchman, he\ndoes not, like so many of these _chefs_, confine himself exclusively to\nFrench dishes, but is always willing and ready to weigh in with some good\nold simple English fare such as this steak-and-kidney pie to which I have\nalluded. A masterly pie, Bertie, and it wasn't more than half finished.\nIt will do me nicely.\"\n\n\"And at dinner you will push, as arranged?\"\n\n\"Absolutely as arranged.\"\n\n\"Fine.\"\n\n\"It's an excellent idea. One of Jeeves's best. You can tell him from me,\nwhen you see him, that I'm much obliged.\"\n\nThe cigarette fell from my fingers. It was as though somebody had slapped\nBertram Wooster across the face with a wet dish-rag.\n\n\"You aren't suggesting that you think this scheme I have been sketching\nout is Jeeves's?\"\n\n\"Of course it is. It's no good trying to kid me, Bertie. You wouldn't\nhave thought of a wheeze like that in a million years.\"\n\nThere was a pause. I drew myself up to my full height; then, seeing that\nhe wasn't looking at me, lowered myself again.\n\n\"Come, Glossop,\" I said coldly, \"we had better be going. It is time we\nwere dressing for dinner.\"\n\n\n\n-9-\n\n\nTuppy's fatheaded words were still rankling in my bosom as I went up to\nmy room. They continued rankling as I shed the form-fitting, and had not\nceased to rankle when, clad in the old dressing-gown, I made my way along\nthe corridor to the _salle de bain_.\n\nIt is not too much to say that I was piqued to the tonsils.\n\nI mean to say, one does not court praise. The adulation of the multitude\nmeans very little to one. But, all the same, when one has taken the\ntrouble to whack out a highly juicy scheme to benefit an in-the-soup\nfriend in his hour of travail, it's pretty foul to find him giving the\ncredit to one's personal attendant, particularly if that personal\nattendant is a man who goes about the place not packing mess-jackets.\n\nBut after I had been splashing about in the porcelain for a bit,\ncomposure began to return. I have always found that in moments of\nheart-bowed-downness there is nothing that calms the bruised spirit like\na good go at the soap and water. I don't say I actually sang in the tub,\nbut there were times when it was a mere spin of the coin whether I would\ndo so or not.\n\nThe spiritual anguish induced by that tactless speech had become\nnoticeably lessened.\n\nThe discovery of a toy duck in the soap dish, presumably the property of\nsome former juvenile visitor, contributed not a little to this new and\nhappier frame of mind. What with one thing and another, I hadn't played\nwith toy ducks in my bath for years, and I found the novel experience\nmost invigorating. For the benefit of those interested, I may mention\nthat if you shove the thing under the surface with the sponge and then\nlet it go, it shoots out of the water in a manner calculated to divert\nthe most careworn. Ten minutes of this and I was enabled to return to the\nbedchamber much more the old merry Bertram.\n\nJeeves was there, laying out the dinner disguise. He greeted the young\nmaster with his customary suavity.\n\n\"Good evening, sir.\"\n\nI responded in the same affable key.\n\n\"Good evening, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"I trust you had a pleasant drive, sir.\"\n\n\"Very pleasant, thank you, Jeeves. Hand me a sock or two, will you?\"\n\nHe did so, and I commenced to don,\n\n\"Well, Jeeves,\" I said, reaching for the underlinen, \"here we are again\nat Brinkley Court in the county of Worcestershire.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"A nice mess things seem to have gone and got themselves into in this\nrustic joint.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"The rift between Tuppy Glossop and my cousin Angela would appear to be\nserious.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Opinion in the servants' hall is inclined to take a grave view\nof the situation.\"\n\n\"And the thought that springs to your mind, no doubt, is that I shall\nhave my work cut out to fix things up?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You are wrong, Jeeves. I have the thing well in hand.\"\n\n\"You surprise me, sir.\"\n\n\"I thought I should. Yes, Jeeves, I pondered on the matter most of the\nway down here, and with the happiest results. I have just been in\nconference with Mr. Glossop, and everything is taped out.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir? Might I inquire----\"\n\n\"You know my methods, Jeeves. Apply them. Have you,\" I asked, slipping\ninto the shirt and starting to adjust the cravat, \"been gnawing on the\nthing at all?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir. I have always been much attached to Miss Angela, and I\nfelt that it would afford me great pleasure were I to be able to be of\nservice to her.\"\n\n\"A laudable sentiment. But I suppose you drew blank?\"\n\n\"No, sir. I was rewarded with an idea.\"\n\n\"What was it?\"\n\n\"It occurred to me that a reconciliation might be effected between Mr.\nGlossop and Miss Angela by appealing to that instinct which prompts\ngentlemen in time of peril to hasten to the rescue of----\"\n\nI had to let go of the cravat in order to raise a hand. I was shocked.\n\n\"Don't tell me you were contemplating descending to that old\nhe-saved-her-from-drowning gag? I am surprised, Jeeves. Surprised and\npained. When I was discussing the matter with Aunt Dahlia on my arrival,\nshe said in a sniffy sort of way that she supposed I was going to shove\nmy Cousin Angela into the lake and push Tuppy in to haul her out, and I\nlet her see pretty clearly that I considered the suggestion an insult to\nmy intelligence. And now, if your words have the meaning I read into them,\nyou are mooting precisely the same drivelling scheme. Really, Jeeves!\"\n\n\"No, sir. Not that. But the thought did cross my mind, as I walked in the\ngrounds and passed the building where the fire-bell hangs, that a sudden\nalarm of fire in the night might result in Mr. Glossop endeavouring to\nassist Miss Angela to safety.\"\n\nI shivered.\n\n\"Rotten, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"Well, sir----\"\n\n\"No good. Not a bit like it.\"\n\n\"I fancy, sir----\"\n\n\"No, Jeeves. No more. Enough has been said. Let us drop the subj.\"\n\nI finished tying the tie in silence. My emotions were too deep for\nspeech. I knew, of course, that this man had for the time being lost his\ngrip, but I had never suspected that he had gone absolutely to pieces\nlike this. Remembering some of the swift ones he had pulled in the past,\nI shrank with horror from the spectacle of his present ineptitude. Or is\nit ineptness? I mean this frightful disposition of his to stick straws in\nhis hair and talk like a perfect ass. It was the old, old story, I\nsupposed. A man's brain whizzes along for years exceeding the speed\nlimit, and something suddenly goes wrong with the steering-gear and it\nskids and comes a smeller in the ditch.\n\n\"A bit elaborate,\" I said, trying to put the thing in as kindly a light\nas possible. \"Your old failing. You can see that it's a bit elaborate?\"\n\n\"Possibly the plan I suggested might be considered open to that\ncriticism, sir, but _faute de mieux_----\"\n\n\"I don't get you, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"A French expression, sir, signifying 'for want of anything better'.\"\n\nA moment before, I had been feeling for this wreck of a once fine thinker\nnothing but a gentle pity. These words jarred the Wooster pride, inducing\nasperity.\n\n\"I understand perfectly well what _faute de mieux_ means, Jeeves. I did\nnot recently spend two months among our Gallic neighbours for nothing.\nBesides, I remember that one from school. What caused my bewilderment was\nthat you should be employing the expression, well knowing that there is\nno bally _faute de mieux_ about it at all. Where do you get that\n_faute-de-mieux_ stuff? Didn't I tell you I had everything taped out?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, but----\"\n\n\"What do you mean--but?\"\n\n\"Well, sir----\"\n\n\"Push on, Jeeves. I am ready, even anxious, to hear your views.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, if I may take the liberty of reminding you of it, your plans\nin the past have not always been uniformly successful.\"\n\nThere was a silence--rather a throbbing one--during which I put on my\nwaistcoat in a marked manner. Not till I had got the buckle at the back\nsatisfactorily adjusted did I speak.\n\n\"It is true, Jeeves,\" I said formally, \"that once or twice in the past I\nmay have missed the bus. This, however, I attribute purely to bad luck.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir?\"\n\n\"On the present occasion I shall not fail, and I'll tell you why I shall\nnot fail. Because my scheme is rooted in human nature.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir?\"\n\n\"It is simple. Not elaborate. And, furthermore, based on the psychology\nof the individual.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir?\"\n\n\"Jeeves,\" I said, \"don't keep saying 'Indeed, sir?' No doubt nothing is\nfurther from your mind than to convey such a suggestion, but you have a\nway of stressing the 'in' and then coming down with a thud on the 'deed'\nwhich makes it virtually tantamount to 'Oh, yeah?' Correct this, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\n\"I tell you I have everything nicely lined up. Would you care to hear\nwhat steps I have taken?\"\n\n\"Very much, sir.\"\n\n\"Then listen. Tonight at dinner I have recommended Tuppy to lay off the\nfood.\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"Tut, Jeeves, surely you can follow the idea, even though it is one that\nwould never have occurred to yourself. Have you forgotten that telegram I\nsent to Gussie Fink-Nottle, steering him away from the sausages and ham?\nThis is the same thing. Pushing the food away untasted is a universally\nrecognized sign of love. It cannot fail to bring home the gravy. You must\nsee that?\"\n\n\"Well, sir----\"\n\nI frowned.\n\n\"I don't want to seem always to be criticizing your methods of voice\nproduction, Jeeves,\" I said, \"but I must inform you that that 'Well, sir'\nof yours is in many respects fully as unpleasant as your 'Indeed, sir?'\nLike the latter, it seems to be tinged with a definite scepticism. It\nsuggests a lack of faith in my vision. The impression I retain after\nhearing you shoot it at me a couple of times is that you consider me to\nbe talking through the back of my neck, and that only a feudal sense of\nwhat is fitting restrains you from substituting for it the words 'Says\nyou!'\"\n\n\"Oh, no, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, that's what it sounds like. Why don't you think this scheme will\nwork?\"\n\n\"I fear Miss Angela will merely attribute Mr. Glossop's abstinence to\nindigestion, sir.\"\n\nI hadn't thought of that, and I must confess it shook me for a moment.\nThen I recovered myself. I saw what was at the bottom of all this.\nMortified by the consciousness of his own ineptness--or ineptitude--the\nfellow was simply trying to hamper and obstruct. I decided to knock the\nstuffing out of him without further preamble.\n\n\"Oh?\" I said. \"You do, do you? Well, be that as it may, it doesn't alter\nthe fact that you've put out the wrong coat. Be so good, Jeeves,\" I said,\nindicating with a gesture the gent's ordinary dinner jacket or _smoking_,\nas we call it on the C\u00c3\u00b4te d'Azur, which was suspended from the hanger on\nthe knob of the wardrobe, \"as to shove that bally black thing in the\ncupboard and bring out my white mess-jacket with the brass buttons.\"\n\nHe looked at me in a meaning manner. And when I say a meaning manner, I\nmean there was a respectful but at the same time uppish glint in his eye\nand a sort of muscular spasm flickered across his face which wasn't quite\na quiet smile and yet wasn't quite not a quiet smile. Also the soft\ncough.\n\n\"I regret to say, sir, that I inadvertently omitted to pack the garment\nto which you refer.\"\n\nThe vision of that parcel in the hall seemed to rise before my eyes, and\nI exchanged a merry wink with it. I may even have hummed a bar or two.\nI'm not quite sure.\n\n\"I know you did, Jeeves,\" I said, laughing down from lazy eyelids and\nnicking a speck of dust from the irreproachable Mechlin lace at my\nwrists. \"But I didn't. You will find it on a chair in the hall in a\nbrown-paper parcel.\"\n\nThe information that his low manoeuvres had been rendered null and void\nand that the thing was on the strength after all, must have been the\nnastiest of jars, but there was no play of expression on his finely\nchiselled to indicate it. There very seldom is on Jeeves's f-c. In\nmoments of discomfort, as I had told Tuppy, he wears a mask, preserving\nthroughout the quiet stolidity of a stuffed moose.\n\n\"You might just slide down and fetch it, will you?\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\n\"Right ho, Jeeves.\"\n\nAnd presently I was sauntering towards the drawing-room with me good old\nj. nestling snugly abaft the shoulder blades.\n\nAnd Dahlia was in the drawing-room. She glanced up at my entrance.\n\n\"Hullo, eyesore,\" she said. \"What do you think you're made up as?\"\n\nI did not get the purport.\n\n\"The jacket, you mean?\" I queried, groping.\n\n\"I do. You look like one of the chorus of male guests at Abernethy Towers\nin Act 2 of a touring musical comedy.\"\n\n\"You do not admire this jacket?\"\n\n\"I do not.\"\n\n\"You did at Cannes.\"\n\n\"Well, this isn't Cannes.\"\n\n\"But, dash it----\"\n\n\"Oh, never mind. Let it go. If you want to give my butler a laugh, what\ndoes it matter? What does anything matter now?\"\n\nThere was a death-where-is-thy-sting-fullness about her manner which I\nfound distasteful. It isn't often that I score off Jeeves in the\ndevastating fashion just described, and when I do I like to see happy,\nsmiling faces about me.\n\n\"Tails up, Aunt Dahlia,\" I urged buoyantly.\n\n\"Tails up be dashed,\" was her sombre response. \"I've just been talking to\nTom.\"\n\n\"Telling him?\"\n\n\"No, listening to him. I haven't had the nerve to tell him yet.\"\n\n\"Is he still upset about that income-tax money?\"\n\n\"Upset is right. He says that Civilisation is in the melting-pot and that\nall thinking men can read the writing on the wall.\"\n\n\"What wall?\"\n\n\"Old Testament, ass. Belshazzar's feast.\"\n\n\"Oh, that, yes. I've often wondered how that gag was worked. With\nmirrors, I expect.\"\n\n\"I wish I could use mirrors to break it to Tom about this baccarat\nbusiness.\"\n\nI had a word of comfort to offer here. I had been turning the thing over\nin my mind since our last meeting, and I thought I saw where she had got\ntwisted. Where she made her error, it seemed to me, was in feeling she\nhad got to tell Uncle Tom. To my way of thinking, the matter was one on\nwhich it would be better to continue to exercise a quiet reserve.\n\n\"I don't see why you need mention that you lost that money at baccarat.\"\n\n\"What do you suggest, then? Letting _Milady's Boudoir_ join Civilisation\nin the melting-pot. Because that is what it will infallibly do unless I\nget a cheque by next week. The printers have been showing a nasty spirit\nfor months.\"\n\n\"You don't follow. Listen. It's an understood thing, I take it, that\nUncle Tom foots the _Boudoir_ bills. If the bally sheet has been turning\nthe corner for two years, he must have got used to forking out by this\ntime. Well, simply ask him for the money to pay the printers.\"\n\n\"I did. Just before I went to Cannes.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't he give it to you?\"\n\n\"Certainly he gave it to me. He brassed up like an officer and a\ngentleman. That was the money I lost at baccarat.\"\n\n\"Oh? I didn't know that.\"\n\n\"There isn't much you do know.\"\n\nA nephew's love made me overlook the slur.\n\n\"Tut!\" I said.\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n\"I said 'Tut!'\"\n\n\"Say it once again, and I'll biff you where you stand. I've enough to\nendure without being tutted at.\"\n\n\"Quite.\"\n\n\"Any tutting that's required, I'll attend to myself. And the same applies\nto clicking the tongue, if you were thinking of doing that.\"\n\n\"Far from it.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\nI stood awhile in thought. I was concerned to the core. My heart, if you\nremember, had already bled once for Aunt Dahlia this evening. It now bled\nagain. I knew how deeply attached she was to this paper of hers. Seeing\nit go down the drain would be for her like watching a loved child sink\nfor the third time in some pond or mere.\n\nAnd there was no question that, unless carefully prepared for the touch,\nUncle Tom would see a hundred _Milady's Boudoirs_ go phut rather than\ntake the rap.\n\nThen I saw how the thing could be handled. This aunt, I perceived, must\nfall into line with my other clients. Tuppy Glossop was knocking off\ndinner to melt Angela. Gussie Fink-Nottle was knocking off dinner to\nimpress the Bassett. Aunt Dahlia must knock off dinner to soften Uncle\nTom. For the beauty of this scheme of mine was that there was no limit to\nthe number of entrants. Come one, come all, the more the merrier, and\nsatisfaction guaranteed in every case.\n\n\"I've got it,\" I said. \"There is only one course to pursue. Eat less\nmeat.\"\n\nShe looked at me in a pleading sort of way. I wouldn't swear that her\neyes were wet with unshed tears, but I rather think they were, certainly\nshe clasped her hands in piteous appeal.\n\n\"Must you drivel, Bertie? Won't you stop it just this once? Just for\ntonight, to please Aunt Dahlia?\"\n\n\"I'm not drivelling.\"\n\n\"I dare say that to a man of your high standards it doesn't come under\nthe head of drivel, but----\"\n\nI saw what had happened. I hadn't made myself quite clear.\n\n\"It's all right,\" I said. \"Have no misgivings. This is the real Tabasco.\nWhen I said 'Eat less meat', what I meant was that you must refuse your\noats at dinner tonight. Just sit there, looking blistered, and wave away\neach course as it comes with a weary gesture of resignation. You see what\nwill happen. Uncle Tom will notice your loss of appetite, and I am\nprepared to bet that at the conclusion of the meal he will come to you\nand say 'Dahlia, darling'--I take it he calls you 'Dahlia'--'Dahlia\ndarling,' he will say, 'I noticed at dinner tonight that you were a bit\noff your feed. Is anything the matter, Dahlia, darling?' 'Why, yes, Tom,\ndarling,' you will reply. 'It is kind of you to ask, darling. The fact\nis, darling, I am terribly worried.' 'My darling,' he will say----\"\n\nAunt Dahlia interrupted at this point to observe that these Traverses\nseemed to be a pretty soppy couple of blighters, to judge by their\ndialogue. She also wished to know when I was going to get to the point.\n\nI gave her a look.\n\n\"'My darling,' he will say tenderly, 'is there anything I can do?' To\nwhich your reply will be that there jolly well is--viz. reach for his\ncheque-book and start writing.\"\n\nI was watching her closely as I spoke, and was pleased to note respect\nsuddenly dawn in her eyes.\n\n\"But, Bertie, this is positively bright.\"\n\n\"I told you Jeeves wasn't the only fellow with brain.\"\n\n\"I believe it would work.\"\n\n\"It's bound to work. I've recommended it to Tuppy.\"\n\n\"Young Glossop?\"\n\n\"In order to soften Angela.\"\n\n\"Splendid!\"\n\n\"And to Gussie Fink-Nottle, who wants to make a hit with the Bassett.\"\n\n\"Well, well, well! What a busy little brain it is.\"\n\n\"Always working, Aunt Dahlia, always working.\"\n\n\"You're not the chump I took you for, Bertie.\"\n\n\"When did you ever take me for a chump?\"\n\n\"Oh, some time last summer. I forget what gave me the idea. Yes, Bertie,\nthis scheme is bright. I suppose, as a matter of fact, Jeeves suggested\nit.\"\n\n\"Jeeves did not suggest it. I resent these implications. Jeeves had\nnothing to do with it whatsoever.\"\n\n\"Well, all right, no need to get excited about it. Yes, I think it will\nwork. Tom's devoted to me.\"\n\n\"Who wouldn't be?\"\n\n\"I'll do it.\"\n\nAnd then the rest of the party trickled in, and we toddled down to\ndinner.\n\nConditions being as they were at Brinkley Court--I mean to say, the place\nbeing loaded down above the Plimsoll mark with aching hearts and standing\nroom only as regarded tortured souls--I hadn't expected the evening meal\nto be particularly effervescent. Nor was it. Silent. Sombre. The whole\nthing more than a bit like Christmas dinner on Devil's Island.\n\nI was glad when it was over.\n\nWhat with having, on top of her other troubles, to rein herself back from\nthe trough, Aunt Dahlia was a total loss as far as anything in the shape\nof brilliant badinage was concerned. The fact that he was fifty quid in\nthe red and expecting Civilisation to take a toss at any moment had\ncaused Uncle Tom, who always looked a bit like a pterodactyl with a\nsecret sorrow, to take on a deeper melancholy. The Bassett was a silent\nbread crumbler. Angela might have been hewn from the living rock. Tuppy\nhad the air of a condemned murderer refusing to make the usual hearty\nbreakfast before tooling off to the execution shed.\n\nAnd as for Gussie Fink-Nottle, many an experienced undertaker would have\nbeen deceived by his appearance and started embalming him on sight.\n\nThis was the first glimpse I had had of Gussie since we parted at my\nflat, and I must say his demeanour disappointed me. I had been expecting\nsomething a great deal more sparkling.\n\nAt my flat, on the occasion alluded to, he had, if you recall,\npractically given me a signed guarantee that all he needed to touch him\noff was a rural setting. Yet in this aspect now I could detect no\nindication whatsoever that he was about to round into mid-season form. He\nstill looked like a cat in an adage, and it did not take me long to\nrealise that my very first act on escaping from this morgue must be to\ndraw him aside and give him a pep talk.\n\nIf ever a chap wanted the clarion note, it looked as if it was this\nFink-Nottle.\n\nIn the general exodus of mourners, however, I lost sight of him, and,\nowing to the fact that Aunt Dahlia roped me in for a game of backgammon,\nit was not immediately that I was able to institute a search. But after\nwe had been playing for a while, the butler came in and asked her if she\nwould speak to Anatole, so I managed to get away. And some ten minutes\nlater, having failed to find scent in the house, I started to throw out\nthe drag-net through the grounds, and flushed him in the rose garden.\n\nHe was smelling a rose at the moment in a limp sort of way, but removed\nthe beak as I approached.\n\n\"Well, Gussie,\" I said.\n\nI had beamed genially upon him as I spoke, such being my customary policy\non meeting an old pal; but instead of beaming back genially, he gave me a\nmost unpleasant look. His attitude perplexed me. It was as if he were not\nglad to see Bertram. For a moment he stood letting this unpleasant look\nplay upon me, as it were, and then he spoke.\n\n\"You and your 'Well, Gussie'!\"\n\nHe said this between clenched teeth, always an unmatey thing to do, and I\nfound myself more fogged than ever.\n\n\"How do you mean--me and my 'Well, Gussie'?\"\n\n\"I like your nerve, coming bounding about the place, saying 'Well,\nGussie.' That's about all the 'Well, Gussie' I shall require from you,\nWooster. And it's no good looking like that. You know what I mean. That\ndamned prize-giving! It was a dastardly act to crawl out as you did and\nshove it off on to me. I will not mince my words. It was the act of a\nhound and a stinker.\"\n\nNow, though, as I have shown, I had devoted most of the time on the\njourney down to meditating upon the case of Angela and Tuppy, I had not\nneglected to give a thought or two to what I was going to say when I\nencountered Gussie. I had foreseen that there might be some little\ntemporary unpleasantness when we met, and when a difficult interview is\nin the offing Bertram Wooster likes to have his story ready.\n\nSo now I was able to reply with a manly, disarming frankness. The sudden\nintroduction of the topic had given me a bit of a jolt, it is true, for\nin the stress of recent happenings I had rather let that prize-giving\nbusiness slide to the back of my mind; but I had speedily recovered and,\nas I say, was able to reply with a manly d.f.\n\n\"But, my dear chap,\" I said, \"I took it for granted that you would\nunderstand that that was all part of my schemes.\"\n\nHe said something about my schemes which I did not catch.\n\n\"Absolutely. 'Crawling out' is entirely the wrong way to put it. You\ndon't suppose I didn't want to distribute those prizes, do you? Left to\nmyself, there is nothing I would find a greater treat. But I saw that the\nsquare, generous thing to do was to step aside and let you take it on, so\nI did so. I felt that your need was greater than mine. You don't mean to\nsay you aren't looking forward to it?\"\n\nHe uttered a coarse expression which I wouldn't have thought he would\nhave known. It just shows that you can bury yourself in the country and\nstill somehow acquire a vocabulary. No doubt one picks up things from the\nneighbours--the vicar, the local doctor, the man who brings the milk, and\nso on.\n\n\"But, dash it,\" I said, \"can't you see what this is going to do for you?\nIt will send your stock up with a jump. There you will be, up on that\nplatform, a romantic, impressive figure, the star of the whole\nproceedings, the what-d'you-call-it of all eyes. Madeline Bassett will be\nall over you. She will see you in a totally new light.\"\n\n\"She will, will she?\"\n\n\"Certainly she will. Augustus Fink-Nottle, the newts' friend, she knows.\nShe is acquainted with Augustus Fink-Nottle, the dogs' chiropodist. But\nAugustus Fink-Nottle, the orator--that'll knock her sideways, or I know\nnothing of the female heart. Girls go potty over a public man. If ever\nanyone did anyone else a kindness, it was I when I gave this\nextraordinary attractive assignment to you.\"\n\nHe seemed impressed by my eloquence. Couldn't have helped himself, of\ncourse. The fire faded from behind his horn-rimmed spectacles, and in its\nplace appeared the old fish-like goggle.\n\n'\"Myes,\" he said meditatively. \"Have you ever made a speech, Bertie?\"\n\n\"Dozens of times. It's pie. Nothing to it. Why, I once addressed a girls'\nschool.\"\n\n\"You weren't nervous?\"\n\n\"Not a bit.\"\n\n\"How did you go?\"\n\n\"They hung on my lips. I held them in the hollow of my hand.\"\n\n\"They didn't throw eggs, or anything?\"\n\n\"Not a thing.\"\n\nHe expelled a deep breath, and for a space stood staring in silence at a\npassing slug.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, at length, \"it may be all right. Possibly I am letting\nthe thing prey on my mind too much. I may be wrong in supposing it the\nfate that is worse than death. But I'll tell you this much: the prospect\nof that prize-giving on the thirty-first of this month has been turning\nmy existence into a nightmare. I haven't been able to sleep or think or\neat ... By the way, that reminds me. You never explained that cipher\ntelegram about the sausages and ham.\"\n\n\"It wasn't a cipher telegram. I wanted you to go light on the food, so\nthat she would realize you were in love.\"\n\nHe laughed hollowly.\n\n\"I see. Well, I've been doing that, all right.\"\n\n\"Yes, I was noticing at dinner. Splendid.\"\n\n\"I don't see what's splendid about it. It's not going to get me anywhere.\nI shall never be able to ask her to marry me. I couldn't find nerve to do\nthat if I lived on wafer biscuits for the rest of my life.\"\n\n\"But, dash it, Gussie. In these romantic surroundings. I should have\nthought the whispering trees alone----\"\n\n\"I don't care what you would have thought. I can't do it.\"\n\n\"Oh, come!\"\n\n\"I can't. She seems so aloof, so remote.\"\n\n\"She doesn't.\"\n\n\"Yes, she does. Especially when you see her sideways. Have you seen her\nsideways, Bertie? That cold, pure profile. It just takes all the heart\nout of one.\"\n\n\"It doesn't.\"\n\n\"I tell you it does. I catch sight of it, and the words freeze on my\nlips.\"\n\nHe spoke with a sort of dull despair, and so manifest was his lack of\nginger and the spirit that wins to success that for an instant, I\nconfess, I felt a bit stymied. It seemed hopeless to go on trying to\nsteam up such a human jellyfish. Then I saw the way. With that\nextraordinary quickness of mine, I realized exactly what must be done if\nthis Fink-Nottle was to be enabled to push his nose past the judges' box.\n\n\"She must be softened up,\" I said.\n\n\"Be what?\"\n\n\"Softened up. Sweetened. Worked on. Preliminary spadework must be put in.\nHere, Gussie, is the procedure I propose to adopt: I shall now return to\nthe house and lug this Bassett out for a stroll. I shall talk to her of\nhearts that yearn, intimating that there is one actually on the premises.\nI shall pitch it strong, sparing no effort. You, meanwhile, will lurk on\nthe outskirts, and in about a quarter of an hour you will come along and\ncarry on from there. By that time, her emotions having been stirred, you\nought to be able to do the rest on your head. It will be like leaping on\nto a moving bus.\"\n\nI remember when I was a kid at school having to learn a poem of sorts\nabout a fellow named Pig-something--a sculptor he would have been, no\ndoubt--who made a statue of a girl, and what should happen one morning\nbut that the bally thing suddenly came to life. A pretty nasty shock for\nthe chap, of course, but the point I'm working round to is that there\nwere a couple of lines that went, if I remember correctly:\n\n_She starts. She moves. She seems to feel\nThe stir of life along her keel._\n\nAnd what I'm driving at is that you couldn't get a better description of\nwhat happened to Gussie as I spoke these heartening words. His brow\ncleared, his eyes brightened, he lost that fishy look, and he gazed at\nthe slug, which was still on the long, long trail with something\napproaching bonhomie. A marked improvement.\n\n\"I see what you mean. You will sort of pave the way, as it were.\"\n\n\"That's right. Spadework.\"\n\n\"It's a terrific idea, Bertie. It will make all the difference.\"\n\n\"Quite. But don't forget that after that it will be up to you. You will\nhave to haul up your slacks and give her the old oil, or my efforts will\nhave been in vain.\"\n\nSomething of his former Gawd-help-us-ness seemed to return to him. He\ngasped a bit.\n\n\"That's true. What the dickens shall I say?\"\n\nI restrained my impatience with an effort. The man had been at school\nwith me.\n\n\"Dash it, there are hundreds of things you can say. Talk about the\nsunset.\"\n\n\"The sunset?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Half the married men you meet began by talking about the\nsunset.\"\n\n\"But what can I say about the sunset?\"\n\n\"Well, Jeeves got off a good one the other day. I met him airing the dog\nin the park one evening, and he said, 'Now fades the glimmering landscape\non the sight, sir, and all the air a solemn stillness holds.' You might\nuse that.\"\n\n\"What sort of landscape?\"\n\n\"Glimmering. _G_ for 'gastritis,' _l_ for 'lizard'----\"\n\n\"Oh, glimmering? Yes, that's not bad. Glimmering landscape ... solemn\nstillness.... Yes, I call that pretty good.\"\n\n\"You could then say that you have often thought that the stars are God's\ndaisy chain.\"\n\n\"But I haven't.\"\n\n\"I dare say not. But she has. Hand her that one, and I don't see how she\ncan help feeling that you're a twin soul.\"\n\n\"God's daisy chain?\"\n\n\"God's daisy chain. And then you go on about how twilight always makes\nyou sad. I know you're going to say it doesn't, but on this occasion it\nhas jolly well got to.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"That's just what she will ask, and you will then have got her going.\nBecause you will reply that it is because yours is such a lonely life. It\nwouldn't be a bad idea to give her a brief description of a typical home\nevening at your Lincolnshire residence, showing how you pace the meadows\nwith a heavy tread.\"\n\n\"I generally sit indoors and listen to the wireless.\"\n\n\"No, you don't. You pace the meadows with a heavy tread, wishing that you\nhad someone to love you. And then you speak of the day when she came into\nyour life.\"\n\n\"Like a fairy princess.\"\n\n\"Absolutely,\" I said with approval. I hadn't expected such a hot one from\nsuch a quarter. \"Like a fairy princess. Nice work, Gussie.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Well, after that it's easy. You say you have something you want to say\nto her, and then you snap into it. I don't see how it can fail. If I were\nyou, I should do it in this rose garden. It is well established that\nthere is no sounder move than to steer the adored object into rose\ngardens in the gloaming. And you had better have a couple of quick ones\nfirst.\"\n\n\"Quick ones?\"\n\n\"Snifters.\"\n\n\"Drinks, do you mean? But I don't drink.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I've never touched a drop in my life.\"\n\nThis made me a bit dubious, I must confess. On these occasions it is\ngenerally conceded that a moderate skinful is of the essence.\n\nHowever, if the facts were as he had stated, I supposed there was nothing\nto be done about it.\n\n\"Well, you'll have to make out as best you can on ginger pop.\"\n\n\"I always drink orange juice.\"\n\n\"Orange juice, then. Tell me, Gussie, to settle a bet, do you really like\nthat muck?\"\n\n\"Very much.\"\n\n\"Then there is no more to be said. Now, let's just have a run through, to\nsee that you've got the lay-out straight. Start off with the glimmering\nlandscape.\"\n\n\"Stars God's daisy chain.\"\n\n\"Twilight makes you feel sad.\"\n\n\"Because mine lonely life.\"\n\n\"Describe life.\"\n\n\"Talk about the day I met her.\"\n\n\"Add fairy-princess gag. Say there's something you want to say to her.\nHeave a couple of sighs. Grab her hand. And give her the works. Right.\"\n\nAnd confident that he had grasped the scenario and that everything might\nnow be expected to proceed through the proper channels, I picked up the\nfeet and hastened back to the house.\n\nIt was not until I had reached the drawing-room and was enabled to take a\nsquare look at the Bassett that I found the debonair gaiety with which I\nhad embarked on this affair beginning to wane a trifle. Beholding her at\nclose range like this, I suddenly became cognisant of what I was in for.\nThe thought of strolling with this rummy specimen undeniably gave me a\nmost unpleasant sinking feeling. I could not but remember how often, when\nin her company at Cannes, I had gazed dumbly at her, wishing that some\nkindly motorist in a racing car would ease the situation by coming along\nand ramming her amidships. As I have already made abundantly clear, this\ngirl was not one of my most congenial buddies.\n\nHowever, a Wooster's word is his bond. Woosters may quail, but they do\nnot edge out. Only the keenest ear could have detected the tremor in the\nvoice as I asked her if she would care to come out for half an hour.\n\n\"Lovely evening,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, lovely, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Lovely. Reminds me of Cannes.\"\n\n\"How lovely the evenings were there!\"\n\n\"Lovely,\" I said.\n\n\"Lovely,\" said the Bassett.\n\n\"Lovely,\" I agreed.\n\nThat completed the weather and news bulletin for the French Riviera.\nAnother minute, and we were out in the great open spaces, she cooing a\nbit about the scenery, and self replying, \"Oh, rather, quite,\" and\nwondering how best to approach the matter in hand.\n\n\n\n-10-\n\n\nHow different it all would have been, I could not but reflect, if this\ngirl had been the sort of girl one chirrups cheerily to over the\ntelephone and takes for spins in the old two-seater. In that case, I\nwould simply have said, \"Listen,\" and she would have said, \"What?\" and I\nwould have said, \"You know Gussie Fink-Nottle,\" and she would have said,\n\"Yes,\" and I would have said, \"He loves you,\" and she would have said\neither, \"What, that mutt? Well, thank heaven for one good laugh today,\"\nor else, in more passionate vein, \"Hot dog! Tell me more.\"\n\nI mean to say, in either event the whole thing over and done with in\nunder a minute.\n\nBut with the Bassett something less snappy and a good deal more glutinous\nwas obviously indicated. What with all this daylight-saving stuff, we had\nhit the great open spaces at a moment when twilight had not yet begun to\ncheese it in favour of the shades of night. There was a fag-end of sunset\nstill functioning. Stars were beginning to peep out, bats were fooling\nround, the garden was full of the aroma of those niffy white flowers\nwhich only start to put in their heavy work at the end of the day--in\nshort, the glimmering landscape was fading on the sight and all the air\nheld a solemn stillness, and it was plain that this was having the worst\neffect on her. Her eyes were enlarged, and her whole map a good deal too\nsuggestive of the soul's awakening for comfort.\n\nHer aspect was that of a girl who was expecting something fairly fruity\nfrom Bertram.\n\nIn these circs., conversation inevitably flagged a bit. I am never at my\nbest when the situation seems to call for a certain soupiness, and I've\nheard other members of the Drones say the same thing about themselves. I\nremember Pongo Twistleton telling me that he was out in a gondola with a\ngirl by moonlight once, and the only time he spoke was to tell her that\nold story about the chap who was so good at swimming that they made him a\ntraffic cop in Venice.\n\nFell rather flat, he assured me, and it wasn't much later when the girl\nsaid she thought it was getting a little chilly and how about pushing\nback to the hotel.\n\nSo now, as I say, the talk rather hung fire. It had been all very well\nfor me to promise Gussie that I would cut loose to this girl about aching\nhearts, but you want a cue for that sort of thing. And when, toddling\nalong, we reached the edge of the lake and she finally spoke, conceive my\nchagrin when I discovered that what she was talking about was stars.\n\nNot a bit of good to me.\n\n\"Oh, look,\" she said. She was a confirmed Oh-looker. I had noticed this\nat Cannes, where she had drawn my attention in this manner on various\noccasions to such diverse objects as a French actress, a Proven\u00c3\u00a7al\nfilling station, the sunset over the Estorels, Michael Arlen, a man\nselling coloured spectacles, the deep velvet blue of the Mediterranean,\nand the late mayor of New York in a striped one-piece bathing suit. \"Oh,\nlook at that sweet little star up there all by itself.\"\n\nI saw the one she meant, a little chap operating in a detached sort of\nway above a spinney.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.\n\n\"I wonder if it feels lonely.\"\n\n\"Oh, I shouldn't think so.\"\n\n\"A fairy must have been crying.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"Don't you remember? 'Every time a fairy sheds a tear, a wee bit star is\nborn in the Milky Way.' Have you ever thought that, Mr. Wooster?\"\n\nI never had. Most improbable, I considered, and it didn't seem to me to\ncheck up with her statement that the stars were God's daisy chain. I\nmean, you can't have it both ways.\n\nHowever, I was in no mood to dissect and criticize. I saw that I had been\nwrong in supposing that the stars were not germane to the issue. Quite a\ndecent cue they had provided, and I leaped on it Promptly: \"Talking of\nshedding tears----\"\n\nBut she was now on the subject of rabbits, several of which were messing\nabout in the park to our right.\n\n\"Oh, look. The little bunnies!\"\n\n\"Talking of shedding tears----\"\n\n\"Don't you love this time of the evening, Mr. Wooster, when the sun has\ngone to bed and all the bunnies come out to have their little suppers?\nWhen I was a child, I used to think that rabbits were gnomes, and that if\nI held my breath and stayed quite still, I should see the fairy queen.\"\n\nIndicating with a reserved gesture that this was just the sort of loony\nthing I should have expected her to think as a child, I returned to the\npoint.\n\n\"Talking of shedding tears,\" I said firmly, \"it may interest you to know\nthat there is an aching heart in Brinkley Court.\"\n\nThis held her. She cheesed the rabbit theme. Her face, which had been\naglow with what I supposed was a pretty animation, clouded. She unshipped\na sigh that sounded like the wind going out of a rubber duck.\n\n\"Ah, yes. Life is very sad, isn't it?\"\n\n\"It is for some people. This aching heart, for instance.\"\n\n\"Those wistful eyes of hers! Drenched irises. And they used to dance like\nelves of delight. And all through a foolish misunderstanding about a\nshark. What a tragedy misunderstandings are. That pretty romance broken\nand over just because Mr. Glossop would insist that it was a flatfish.\"\n\nI saw that she had got the wires crossed.\n\n\"I'm not talking about Angela.\"\n\n\"But her heart is aching.\"\n\n\"I know it's aching. But so is somebody else's.\"\n\nShe looked at me, perplexed.\n\n\"Somebody else? Mr. Glossop's, you mean?\"\n\n\"No, I don't.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Travers's?\"\n\nThe exquisite code of politeness of the Woosters prevented me clipping\nher one on the ear-hole, but I would have given a shilling to be able to\ndo it. There seemed to me something deliberately fat-headed in the way\nshe persisted in missing the gist.\n\n\"No, not Aunt Dahlia's, either.\"\n\n\"I'm sure she is dreadfully upset.\"\n\n\"Quite. But this heart I'm talking about isn't aching because of Tuppy's\nrow with Angela. It's aching for a different reason altogether. I mean to\nsay--dash it, you know why hearts ache!\"\n\nShe seemed to shimmy a bit. Her voice, when she spoke, was whispery: \"You\nmean--for love?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. Right on the bull's-eye. For love.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Wooster!\"\n\n\"I take it you believe in love at first sight?\"\n\n\"I do, indeed.\"\n\n\"Well, that's what happened to this aching heart. It fell in love at\nfirst sight, and ever since it's been eating itself out, as I believe the\nexpression is.\"\n\nThere was a silence. She had turned away and was watching a duck out on\nthe lake. It was tucking into weeds, a thing I've never been able to\nunderstand anyone wanting to do. Though I suppose, if you face it\nsquarely, they're no worse than spinach. She stood drinking it in for a\nbit, and then it suddenly stood on its head and disappeared, and this\nseemed to break the spell.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Wooster!\" she said again, and from the tone of her voice, I\ncould see that I had got her going.\n\n\"For you, I mean to say,\" I proceeded, starting to put in the fancy\ntouches. I dare say you have noticed on these occasions that the\ndifficulty is to plant the main idea, to get the general outline of the\nthing well fixed. The rest is mere detail work. I don't say I became glib\nat this juncture, but I certainly became a dashed glibber than I had\nbeen.\n\n\"It's having the dickens of a time. Can't eat, can't sleep--all for love\nof you. And what makes it all so particularly rotten is that it--this\naching heart--can't bring itself up to the scratch and tell you the\nposition of affairs, because your profile has gone and given it cold\nfeet. Just as it is about to speak, it catches sight of you sideways, and\nwords fail it. Silly, of course, but there it is.\"\n\nI heard her give a gulp, and I saw that her eyes had become moistish.\nDrenched irises, if you care to put it that way.\n\n\"Lend you a handkerchief?\"\n\n\"No, thank you. I'm quite all right.\"\n\nIt was more than I could say for myself. My efforts had left me weak. I\ndon't know if you suffer in the same way, but with me the act of talking\nanything in the nature of real mashed potatoes always induces a sort of\nprickly sensation and a hideous feeling of shame, together with a marked\nstarting of the pores.\n\nI remember at my Aunt Agatha's place in Hertfordshire once being put on\nthe spot and forced to enact the role of King Edward III saying goodbye\nto that girl of his, Fair Rosamund, at some sort of pageant in aid of the\nDistressed Daughters of the Clergy. It involved some rather warmish\nmedieval dialogue, I recall, racy of the days when they called a spade a\nspade, and by the time the whistle blew, I'll bet no Daughter of the\nClergy was half as distressed as I was. Not a dry stitch.\n\nMy reaction now was very similar. It was a highly liquid Bertram who,\nhearing his _vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis_ give a couple of hiccups and start to speak bent\nan attentive ear.\n\n\"Please don't say any more, Mr. Wooster.\"\n\nWell, I wasn't going to, of course.\n\n\"I understand.\"\n\nI was glad to hear this.\n\n\"Yes, I understand. I won't be so silly as to pretend not to know what\nyou mean. I suspected this at Cannes, when you used to stand and stare at\nme without speaking a word, but with whole volumes in your eyes.\"\n\nIf Angela's shark had bitten me in the leg, I couldn't have leaped more\nconvulsively. So tensely had I been concentrating on Gussie's interests\nthat it hadn't so much as crossed my mind that another and an unfortunate\nconstruction could be placed on those words of mine. The persp., already\nbedewing my brow, became a regular Niagara.\n\nMy whole fate hung upon a woman's word. I mean to say, I couldn't back\nout. If a girl thinks a man is proposing to her, and on that\nunderstanding books him up, he can't explain to her that she has got hold\nof entirely the wrong end of the stick and that he hadn't the smallest\nintention of suggesting anything of the kind. He must simply let it ride.\nAnd the thought of being engaged to a girl who talked openly about\nfairies being born because stars blew their noses, or whatever it was,\nfrankly appalled me.\n\nShe was carrying on with her remarks, and as I listened I clenched my\nfists till I shouldn't wonder if the knuckles didn't stand out white\nunder the strain. It seemed as if she would never get to the nub.\n\n\"Yes, all through those days at Cannes I could see what you were trying\nto say. A girl always knows. And then you followed me down here, and\nthere was that same dumb, yearning look in your eyes when we met this\nevening. And then you were so insistent that I should come out and walk\nwith you in the twilight. And now you stammer out those halting words.\nNo, this does not come as a surprise. But I am sorry----\"\n\nThe word was like one of Jeeves's pick-me-ups. Just as if a glassful of\nmeat sauce, red pepper, and the yolk of an egg--though, as I say, I am\nconvinced that these are not the sole ingredients--had been shot into me,\nI expanded like some lovely flower blossoming in the sunshine. It was all\nright, after all. My guardian angel had not been asleep at the switch.\n\n\"--but I am afraid it is impossible.\"\n\nShe paused.\n\n\"Impossible,\" she repeated.\n\nI had been so busy feeling saved from the scaffold that I didn't get on\nto it for a moment that an early reply was desired.\n\n\"Oh, right ho,\" I said hastily.\n\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Quite all right.\"\n\n\"Sorrier than I can say.\"\n\n\"Don't give it another thought.\"\n\n\"We can still be friends.\"\n\n\"Oh, rather.\"\n\n\"Then shall we just say no more about it; keep what has happened as a\ntender little secret between ourselves?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\n\"We will. Like something lovely and fragrant laid away in lavender.\"\n\n\"In lavender--right.\"\n\nThere was a longish pause. She was gazing at me in a divinely pitying\nsort of way, much as if I had been a snail she had happened accidentally\nto bring her short French vamp down on, and I longed to tell her that it\nwas all right, and that Bertram, so far from being the victim of despair,\nhad never felt fizzier in his life. But, of course, one can't do that\nsort of thing. I simply said nothing, and stood there looking brave.\n\n\"I wish I could,\" she murmured.\n\n\"Could?\" I said, for my attensh had been wandering.\n\n\"Feel towards you as you would like me to feel.\"\n\n\"Oh, ah.\"\n\n\"But I can't. I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Absolutely O.K. Faults on both sides, no doubt.\"\n\n\"Because I am fond of you, Mr.--no, I think I must call you Bertie. May\nI?\"\n\n\"Oh, rather.\"\n\n\"Because we are real friends.\"\n\n\"Quite.\"\n\n\"I do like you, Bertie. And if things were different--I wonder----\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"After all, we are real friends.... We have this common memory.... You\nhave a right to know.... I don't want you to think----Life is such a\nmuddle, isn't it?\"\n\nTo many men, no doubt, these broken utterances would have appeared mere\ndrooling and would have been dismissed as such. But the Woosters are\nquicker-witted than the ordinary and can read between the lines. I\nsuddenly divined what it was that she was trying to get off the chest.\n\n\"You mean there's someone else?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"You're in love with some other bloke?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"Engaged, what?\"\n\nThis time she shook the pumpkin.\n\n\"No, not engaged.\"\n\nWell, that was something, of course. Nevertheless, from the way she\nspoke, it certainly looked as if poor old Gussie might as well scratch\nhis name off the entry list, and I didn't at all like the prospect of\nhaving to break the bad news to him. I had studied the man closely, and\nit was my conviction that this would about be his finish.\n\nGussie, you see, wasn't like some of my pals--the name of Bingo Little is\none that springs to the lips--who, if turned down by a girl, would simply\nsay, \"Well, bung-oh!\" and toddle off quite happily to find another. He\nwas so manifestly a bird who, having failed to score in the first\nchukker, would turn the thing up and spend the rest of his life brooding\nover his newts and growing long grey whiskers, like one of those chaps\nyou read about in novels, who live in the great white house you can just\nsee over there through the trees and shut themselves off from the world\nand have pained faces.\n\n\"I'm afraid he doesn't care for me in that way. At least, he has said\nnothing. You understand that I am only telling you this because----\"\n\n\"Oh, rather.\"\n\n\"It's odd that you should have asked me if I believed in love at first\nsight.\" She half closed her eyes. \"'Who ever loved that loved not at\nfirst sight?'\" she said in a rummy voice that brought back to me--I don't\nknow why--the picture of my Aunt Agatha, as Boadicea, reciting at that\npageant I was speaking of. \"It's a silly little story. I was staying with\nsome friends in the country, and I had gone for a walk with my dog, and\nthe poor wee mite got a nasty thorn in his little foot and I didn't know\nwhat to do. And then suddenly this man came along----\"\n\nHarking back once again to that pageant, in sketching out for you my\nemotions on that occasion, I showed you only the darker side of the\npicture. There was, I should now mention, a splendid aftermath when,\nhaving climbed out of my suit of chain mail and sneaked off to the local\npub, I entered the saloon bar and requested mine host to start pouring. A\nmoment later, a tankard of their special home-brewed was in my hand, and\nthe ecstasy of that first gollup is still green in my memory. The\nrecollection of the agony through which I had passed was just what was\nneeded to make it perfect.\n\nIt was the same now. When I realized, listening to her words, that she\nmust be referring to Gussie--I mean to say, there couldn't have been a\nwhole platoon of men taking thorns out of her dog that day; the animal\nwasn't a pin-cushion--and became aware that Gussie, who an instant before\nhad, to all appearances, gone so far back in the betting as not to be\nworth a quotation, was the big winner after all, a positive thrill\npermeated the frame and there escaped my lips a \"Wow!\" so crisp and\nhearty that the Bassett leaped a liberal inch and a half from terra\nfirma.\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\" she said.\n\nI waved a jaunty hand.\n\n\"Nothing,\" I said. \"Nothing. Just remembered there's a letter I have to\nwrite tonight without fail. If you don't mind, I think I'll be going in.\nHere,\" I said, \"comes Gussie Fink-Nottle. He will look after you.\"\n\nAnd, as I spoke, Gussie came sidling out from behind a tree.\n\nI passed away and left them to it. As regards these two, everything was\nbeyond a question absolutely in order. All Gussie had to do was keep his\nhead down and not press. Already, I felt, as I legged it back to the\nhouse, the happy ending must have begun to function. I mean to say, when\nyou leave a girl and a man, each of whom has admitted in set terms that\nshe and he loves him and her, in close juxtaposition in the twilight,\nthere doesn't seem much more to do but start pricing fish slices.\n\nSomething attempted, something done, seemed to me to have earned\ntwo-penn'orth of wassail in the smoking-room.\n\nI proceeded thither.\n\n\n\n-11-\n\n\nThe makings were neatly laid out on a side-table, and to pour into a\nglass an inch or so of the raw spirit and shoosh some soda-water on top\nof it was with me the work of a moment. This done, I retired to an\narm-chair and put my feet up, sipping the mixture with carefree enjoyment,\nrather like Caesar having one in his tent the day he overcame the Nervii.\n\nAs I let the mind dwell on what must even now be taking place in that\npeaceful garden, I felt bucked and uplifted. Though never for an instant\nfaltering in my opinion that Augustus Fink-Nottle was Nature's final word\nin cloth-headed guffins, I liked the man, wished him well, and could not\nhave felt more deeply involved in the success of his wooing if I, and not\nhe, had been under the ether.\n\nThe thought that by this time he might quite easily have completed the\npreliminary _pourparlers_ and be deep in an informal discussion of\nhoneymoon plans was very pleasant to me.\n\nOf course, considering the sort of girl Madeline Bassett was--stars and\nrabbits and all that, I mean--you might say that a sober sadness would\nhave been more fitting. But in these matters you have got to realize that\ntastes differ. The impulse of right-thinking men might be to run a mile\nwhen they saw the Bassett, but for some reason she appealed to the deeps\nin Gussie, so that was that.\n\nI had reached this point in my meditations, when I was aroused by the\nsound of the door opening. Somebody came in and started moving like a\nleopard toward the side-table and, lowering the feet, I perceived that it\nwas Tuppy Glossop.\n\nThe sight of him gave me a momentary twinge of remorse, reminding me, as\nit did, that in the excitement of getting Gussie fixed up I had rather\nforgotten about this other client. It is often that way when you're\ntrying to run two cases at once.\n\nHowever, Gussie now being off my mind, I was prepared to devote my whole\nattention to the Glossop problem.\n\nI had been much pleased by the way he had carried out the task assigned\nhim at the dinner-table. No easy one, I can assure you, for the browsing\nand sluicing had been of the highest quality, and there had been one dish\nin particular--I allude to the _nonnettes de poulet Agn\u00c3\u00a8s Sorel_--which\nmight well have broken down the most iron resolution. But he had passed\nit up like a professional fasting man, and I was proud of him.\n\n\"Oh, hullo, Tuppy,\" I said, \"I wanted to see you.\"\n\nHe turned, snifter in hand, and it was easy to see that his privations\nhad tried him sorely. He was looking like a wolf on the steppes of Russia\nwhich has seen its peasant shin up a high tree.\n\n\"Yes?\" he said, rather unpleasantly. \"Well, here I am.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"How do you mean----well?\"\n\n\"Make your report.\"\n\n\"What report?\"\n\n\"Have you nothing to tell me about Angela?\"\n\n\"Only that she's a blister.\"\n\nI was concerned.\n\n\"Hasn't she come clustering round you yet?\"\n\n\"She has not.\"\n\n\"Very odd.\"\n\n\"Why odd?\"\n\n\"She must have noted your lack of appetite.\"\n\nHe barked raspingly, as if he were having trouble with the tonsils of the\nsoul.\n\n\"Lack of appetite! I'm as hollow as the Grand Canyon.\"\n\n\"Courage, Tuppy! Think of Gandhi.\"\n\n\"What about Gandhi?\"\n\n\"He hasn't had a square meal for years.\"\n\n\"Nor have I. Or I could swear I hadn't. Gandhi, my left foot.\"\n\nI saw that it might be best to let the Gandhi _motif_ slide. I went back\nto where we had started.\n\n\"She's probably looking for you now.\"\n\n\"Who is? Angela?\"\n\n\"Yes. She must have noticed your supreme sacrifice.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose she noticed it at all, the little fathead. I'll bet it\ndidn't register in any way whatsoever.\"\n\n\"Come, Tuppy,\" I urged, \"this is morbid. Don't take this gloomy view. She\nmust at least have spotted that you refused those _nonnettes de poulet\nAgn\u00c3\u00a8s Sorel_. It was a sensational renunciation and stuck out like a sore\nthumb. And the _c\u00c3\u00a8pes \u00c3\u00a0 la Rossini_----\"\n\nA hoarse cry broke from his twisted lips:\n\n\"Will you stop it, Bertie! Do you think I am made of marble? Isn't it bad\nenough to have sat watching one of Anatole's supremest dinners flit by,\ncourse after course, without having you making a song about it? Don't\nremind me of those _nonnettes_. I can't stand it.\"\n\nI endeavoured to hearten and console.\n\n\"Be brave, Tuppy. Fix your thoughts on that cold steak-and-kidney pie in\nthe larder. As the Good Book says, it cometh in the morning.\"\n\n\"Yes, in the morning. And it's now about half-past nine at night. You\nwould bring that pie up, wouldn't you? Just when I was trying to keep my\nmind off it.\"\n\nI saw what he meant. Hours must pass before he could dig into that pie.\nI dropped the subject, and we sat for a pretty good time in silence. Then\nhe rose and began to pace the room in an overwrought sort of way, like a\nzoo lion who has heard the dinner-gong go and is hoping the keeper won't\nforget him in the general distribution. I averted my gaze tactfully, but\nI could hear him kicking chairs and things. It was plain that the man's\nsoul was in travail and his blood pressure high.\n\nPresently he returned to his seat, and I saw that he was looking at me\nintently. There was that about his demeanour that led me to think that he\nhad something to communicate.\n\nNor was I wrong. He tapped me significantly on the knee and spoke:\n\n\"Bertie.\"\n\n\"Hullo?\"\n\n\"Shall I tell you something?\"\n\n\"Certainly, old bird,\" I said cordially. \"I was just beginning to feel\nthat the scene could do with a bit more dialogue.\"\n\n\"This business of Angela and me.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I've been putting in a lot of solid thinking about it.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes?\"\n\n\"I have analysed the situation pitilessly, and one thing stands out as\nclear as dammit. There has been dirty work afoot.\"\n\n\"I don't get you.\"\n\n\"All right. Let me review the facts. Up to the time she went to Cannes\nAngela loved me. She was all over me. I was the blue-eyed boy in every\nsense of the term. You'll admit that?\"\n\n\"Indisputably.\"\n\n\"And directly she came back we had this bust-up.\"\n\n\"Quite.\"\n\n\"About nothing.\"\n\n\"Oh, dash it, old man, nothing? You were a bit tactless, what, about her\nshark.\"\n\n\"I was frank and candid about her shark. And that's my point. Do you\nseriously believe that a trifling disagreement about sharks would make a\ngirl hand a man his hat, if her heart were really his?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nIt beats me why he couldn't see it. But then poor old Tuppy has never\nbeen very hot on the finer shades. He's one of those large, tough,\nfootball-playing blokes who lack the more delicate sensibilities, as I've\nheard Jeeves call them. Excellent at blocking a punt or walking across an\nopponent's face in cleated boots, but not so good when it comes to\nunderstanding the highly-strung female temperament. It simply wouldn't\noccur to him that a girl might be prepared to give up her life's\nhappiness rather than waive her shark.\n\n\"Rot! It was just a pretext.\"\n\n\"What was?\"\n\n\"This shark business. She wanted to get rid of me, and grabbed at the\nfirst excuse.\"\n\n\"No, no.\"\n\n\"I tell you she did.\"\n\n\"But what on earth would she want to get rid of you for?\"\n\n\"Exactly. That's the very question I asked myself. And here's the answer:\nBecause she has fallen in love with somebody else. It sticks out a mile.\nThere's no other possible solution. She goes to Cannes all for me, she\ncomes back all off me. Obviously during those two months, she must have\ntransferred her affections to some foul blister she met out there.\"\n\n\"No, no.\"\n\n\"Don't keep saying 'No, no'. She must have done. Well, I'll tell you one\nthing, and you can take this as official. If ever I find this slimy,\nslithery snake in the grass, he had better make all the necessary\narrangements at his favourite nursing-home without delay, because I am\ngoing to be very rough with him. I propose, if and when found, to take\nhim by his beastly neck, shake him till he froths, and pull him inside\nout and make him swallow himself.\"\n\nWith which words he biffed off; and I, having given him a minute or two\nto get out of the way, rose and made for the drawing-room. The tendency\nof females to roost in drawing-rooms after dinner being well marked, I\nexpected to find Angela there. It was my intention to have a word with\nAngela.\n\nTo Tuppy's theory that some insinuating bird had stolen the girl's heart\nfrom him at Cannes I had given, as I have indicated, little credence,\nconsidering it the mere unbalanced apple sauce of a bereaved man. It was,\nof course, the shark, and nothing but the shark, that had caused love's\nyoung dream to go temporarily off the boil, and I was convinced that a\nword or two with the cousin at this juncture would set everything right.\n\nFor, frankly, I thought it incredible that a girl of her natural\nsweetness and tender-heartedness should not have been moved to her\nfoundations by what she had seen at dinner that night. Even Seppings,\nAunt Dahlia's butler, a cold, unemotional man, had gasped and practically\nreeled when Tuppy waved aside those _nonnettes de poulet Agn\u00c3\u00a8s Sorel_,\nwhile the footman, standing by with the potatoes, had stared like one\nseeing a vision. I simply refused to consider the possibility of the\nsignificance of the thing having been lost on a nice girl like Angela. I\nfully expected to find her in the drawing-room with her heart bleeding\nfreely, all ripe for an immediate reconciliation.\n\nIn the drawing-room, however, when I entered, only Aunt Dahlia met the\neye. It seemed to me that she gave me rather a jaundiced look as I hove\nin sight, but this, having so recently beheld Tuppy in his agony, I\nattributed to the fact that she, like him, had been going light on the\nmenu. You can't expect an empty aunt to beam like a full aunt.\n\n\"Oh, it's you, is it?\" she said.\n\nWell, it was, of course.\n\n\"Where's Angela?\" I asked.\n\n\"Gone to bed.\"\n\n\"Already?\"\n\n\"She said she had a headache.\"\n\n\"H'm.\"\n\nI wasn't so sure that I liked the sound of that so much. A girl who has\nobserved the sundered lover sensationally off his feed does not go to bed\nwith headaches if love has been reborn in her heart. She sticks around\nand gives him the swift, remorseful glance from beneath the drooping\neyelashes and generally endeavours to convey to him that, if he wants to\nget together across a round table and try to find a formula, she is all\nfor it too. Yes, I am bound to say I found that going-to-bed stuff a bit\ndisquieting.\n\n\"Gone to bed, eh?\" I murmured musingly.\n\n\"What did you want her for?\"\n\n\"I thought she might like a stroll and a chat.\"\n\n\"Are you going for a stroll?\" said Aunt Dahlia, with a sudden show of\ninterest. \"Where?\"\n\n\"Oh, hither and thither.\"\n\n\"Then I wonder if you would mind doing something for me.\"\n\n\"Give it a name.\"\n\n\"It won't take you long. You know that path that runs past the\ngreenhouses into the kitchen garden. If you go along it, you come to a\npond.\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"Well, will you get a good, stout piece of rope or cord and go down that\npath till you come to the pond----\"\n\n\"To the pond. Right.\"\n\n\"--and look about you till you find a nice, heavy stone. Or a fairly\nlarge brick would do.\"\n\n\"I see,\" I said, though I didn't, being still fogged. \"Stone or brick.\nYes. And then?\"\n\n\"Then,\" said the relative, \"I want you, like a good boy, to fasten the\nrope to the brick and tie it around your damned neck and jump into the\npond and drown yourself. In a few days I will send and have you fished up\nand buried because I shall need to dance on your grave.\"\n\nI was more fogged than ever. And not only fogged--wounded and resentful.\nI remember reading a book where a girl \"suddenly fled from the room,\nafraid to stay for fear dreadful things would come tumbling from her\nlips; determined that she would not remain another day in this house to\nbe insulted and misunderstood.\" I felt much about the same.\n\nThen I reminded myself that one has got to make allowances for a woman\nwith only about half a spoonful of soup inside her, and I checked the\nred-hot crack that rose to the lips.\n\n\"What,\" I said gently, \"is this all about? You seem pipped with Bertram.\"\n\n\"Pipped!\"\n\n\"Noticeably pipped. Why this ill-concealed animus?\"\n\nA sudden flame shot from her eyes, singeing my hair.\n\n\"Who was the ass, who was the chump, who was the dithering idiot who\ntalked me, against my better judgment, into going without my dinner? I\nmight have guessed----\"\n\nI saw that I had divined correctly the cause of her strange mood.\n\n\"It's all right. Aunt Dahlia. I know just how you're feeling. A bit on\nthe hollow side, what? But the agony will pass. If I were you, I'd sneak\ndown and raid the larder after the household have gone to bed. I am told\nthere's a pretty good steak-and-kidney pie there which will repay\ninspection. Have faith, Aunt Dahlia,\" I urged. \"Pretty soon Uncle Tom\nwill be along, full of sympathy and anxious inquiries.\"\n\n\"Will he? Do you know where he is now?\"\n\n\"I haven't seen him.\"\n\n\"He is in the study with his face buried in his hands, muttering about\ncivilization and melting pots.\"\n\n\"Eh? Why?\"\n\n\"Because it has just been my painful duty to inform him that Anatole has\ngiven notice.\"\n\nI own that I reeled.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Given notice. As the result of that drivelling scheme of yours. What did\nyou expect a sensitive, temperamental French cook to do, if you went\nabout urging everybody to refuse all food? I hear that when the first two\ncourses came back to the kitchen practically untouched, his feelings were\nso hurt that he cried like a child. And when the rest of the dinner\nfollowed, he came to the conclusion that the whole thing was a studied\nand calculated insult, and decided to hand in his portfolio.\"\n\n\"Golly!\"\n\n\"You may well say 'Golly!' Anatole, God's gift to the gastric juices,\ngone like the dew off the petal of a rose, all through your idiocy.\nPerhaps you understand now why I want you to go and jump in that pond. I\nmight have known that some hideous disaster would strike this house like\na thunderbolt if once you wriggled your way into it and started trying to\nbe clever.\"\n\nHarsh words, of course, as from aunt to nephew, but I bore her no\nresentment. No doubt, if you looked at it from a certain angle, Bertram\nmight be considered to have made something of a floater.\n\n\"I am sorry.\"\n\n\"What's the good of being sorry?\"\n\n\"I acted for what I deemed the best.\"\n\n\"Another time try acting for the worst. Then we may possibly escape with\na mere flesh wound.\"\n\n\"Uncle Tom's not feeling too bucked about it all, you say?\"\n\n\"He's groaning like a lost soul. And any chance I ever had of getting\nthat money out of him has gone.\"\n\nI stroked the chin thoughtfully. There was, I had to admit, reason in\nwhat she said. None knew better than I how terrible a blow the passing of\nAnatole would be to Uncle Tom.\n\nI have stated earlier in this chronicle that this curious object of the\nseashore with whom Aunt Dahlia has linked her lot is a bloke who\nhabitually looks like a pterodactyl that has suffered, and the reason he\ndoes so is that all those years he spent in making millions in the Far\nEast put his digestion on the blink, and the only cook that has ever been\ndiscovered capable of pushing food into him without starting something\nlike Old Home Week in Moscow under the third waistcoat button is this\nuniquely gifted Anatole. Deprived of Anatole's services, all he was\nlikely to give the wife of his b. was a dirty look. Yes, unquestionably,\nthings seemed to have struck a somewhat rocky patch, and I must admit\nthat I found myself, at moment of going to press, a little destitute of\nconstructive ideas.\n\nConfident, however, that these would come ere long, I kept the stiff\nupper lip.\n\n\"Bad,\" I conceded. \"Quite bad, beyond a doubt. Certainly a nasty jar for\none and all. But have no fear, Aunt Dahlia, I will fix everything.\"\n\nI have alluded earlier to the difficulty of staggering when you're\nsitting down, showing that it is a feat of which I, personally, am not\ncapable. Aunt Dahlia, to my amazement, now did it apparently without an\neffort. She was well wedged into a deep arm-chair, but, nevertheless, she\nstaggered like billy-o. A sort of spasm of horror and apprehension\ncontorted her face.\n\n\"If you dare to try any more of your lunatic schemes----\"\n\nI saw that it would be fruitless to try to reason with her. Quite\nplainly, she was not in the vein. Contenting myself, accordingly, with a\ngesture of loving sympathy, I left the room. Whether she did or did not\nthrow a handsomely bound volume of the Works of Alfred, Lord Tennyson, at\nme, I am not in a position to say. I had seen it lying on the table\nbeside her, and as I closed the door I remember receiving the impression\nthat some blunt instrument had crashed against the woodwork, but I was\nfeeling too pre-occupied to note and observe.\n\nI blame myself for not having taken into consideration the possible\neffects of a sudden abstinence on the part of virtually the whole\nstrength of the company on one of Anatole's impulsive Proven\u00c3\u00a7al\ntemperament. These Gauls, I should have remembered, can't take it. Their\ntendency to fly off the handle at the slightest provocation is well\nknown. No doubt the man had put his whole soul into those _nonnettes de\npoulet_, and to see them come homing back to him must have gashed him\nlike a knife.\n\nHowever, spilt milk blows nobody any good, and it is useless to dwell\nupon it. The task now confronting Bertram was to put matters right, and I\nwas pacing the lawn, pondering to this end, when I suddenly heard a groan\nso lost-soulish that I thought it must have proceeded from Uncle Tom,\nescaped from captivity and come to groan in the garden.\n\nLooking about me, however, I could discern no uncles. Puzzled, I was\nabout to resume my meditations, when the sound came again. And peering\ninto the shadows I observed a dim form seated on one of the rustic\nbenches which so liberally dotted this pleasance and another dim form\nstanding beside same. A second and more penetrating glance and I had\nassembled the facts.\n\nThese dim forms were, in the order named, Gussie Fink-Nottle and Jeeves.\nAnd what Gussie was doing, groaning all over the place like this, was\nmore than I could understand.\n\nBecause, I mean to say, there was no possibility of error. He wasn't\nsinging. As I approached, he gave an encore, and it was beyond question a\ngroan. Moreover, I could now see him clearly, and his whole aspect was\ndefinitely sand-bagged.\n\n\"Good evening, sir,\" said Jeeves. \"Mr. Fink-Nottle is not feeling well.\"\n\nNor was I. Gussie had begun to make a low, bubbling noise, and I could no\nlonger disguise it from myself that something must have gone seriously\nwrong with the works. I mean, I know marriage is a pretty solemn business\nand the realization that he is in for it frequently churns a chap up a\nbit, but I had never come across a case of a newly-engaged man taking it\non the chin so completely as this.\n\nGussie looked up. His eye was dull. He clutched the thatch.\n\n\"Goodbye, Bertie,\" he said, rising.\n\nI seemed to spot an error.\n\n\"You mean 'Hullo,' don't you?\"\n\n\"No, I don't. I mean goodbye. I'm off.\"\n\n\"Off where?\"\n\n\"To the kitchen garden. To drown myself.\"\n\n\"Don't be an ass.\"\n\n\"I'm not an ass.... Am I an ass, Jeeves?\"\n\n\"Possibly a little injudicious, sir.\"\n\n\"Drowning myself, you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You think, on the whole, not drown myself?\"\n\n\"I should not advocate it, sir.\"\n\n\"Very well, Jeeves. I accept your ruling. After all, it would be\nunpleasant for Mrs. Travers to find a swollen body floating in her pond.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And she has been very kind to me.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And you have been very kind to me, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\n\n\"So have you, Bertie. Very kind. Everybody has been very kind to me.\nVery, very kind. Very kind indeed. I have no complaints to make. All\nright, I'll go for a walk instead.\"\n\nI followed him with bulging eyes as he tottered off into the dark.\n\n\"Jeeves,\" I said, and I am free to admit that in my emotion I bleated\nlike a lamb drawing itself to the attention of the parent sheep, \"what\nthe dickens is all this?\"\n\n\"Mr. Fink-Nottle is not quite himself, sir. He has passed through a\ntrying experience.\"\n\nI endeavoured to put together a brief synopsis of previous events.\n\n\"I left him out here with Miss Bassett.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I had softened her up.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"He knew exactly what he had to do. I had coached him thoroughly in lines\nand business.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. So Mr. Fink-Nottle informed me.\"\n\n\"Well, then----\"\n\n\"I regret to say, sir, that there was a slight hitch.\"\n\n\"You mean, something went wrong?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nI could not fathom. The brain seemed to be tottering on its throne.\n\n\"But how could anything go wrong? She loves him, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir?\"\n\n\"She definitely told me so. All he had to do was propose.\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\n\"Well, didn't he?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Then what the dickens did he talk about?\"\n\n\"Newts, sir.\"\n\n\"Newts?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Newts?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"But why did he want to talk about newts?\"\n\n\"He did not want to talk about newts, sir. As I gather from Mr.\nFink-Nottle, nothing could have been more alien to his plans.\"\n\nI simply couldn't grasp the trend.\n\n\"But you can't force a man to talk about newts.\"\n\n\"Mr. Fink-Nottle was the victim of a sudden unfortunate spasm of\nnervousness, sir. Upon finding himself alone with the young lady, he\nadmits to having lost his morale. In such circumstances, gentlemen\nfrequently talk at random, saying the first thing that chances to enter\ntheir heads. This, in Mr. Fink-Nottle's case, would seem to have been the\nnewt, its treatment in sickness and in health.\"\n\nThe scales fell from my eyes. I understood. I had had the same sort of\nthing happen to me in moments of crisis. I remember once detaining a\ndentist with the drill at one of my lower bicuspids and holding him up\nfor nearly ten minutes with a story about a Scotchman, an Irishman, and a\nJew. Purely automatic. The more he tried to jab, the more I said \"Hoots,\nmon,\" \"Begorrah,\" and \"Oy, oy\". When one loses one's nerve, one simply\nbabbles.\n\nI could put myself in Gussie's place. I could envisage the scene. There\nhe and the Bassett were, alone together in the evening stillness. No\ndoubt, as I had advised, he had shot the works about sunsets and fairy\nprincesses, and so forth, and then had arrived at the point where he had\nto say that bit about having something to say to her. At this, I take it,\nshe lowered her eyes and said, \"Oh, yes?\"\n\nHe then, I should imagine, said it was something very important; to which\nher response would, one assumes, have been something on the lines of\n\"Really?\" or \"Indeed?\" or possibly just the sharp intake of the breath.\nAnd then their eyes met, just as mine met the dentist's, and something\nsuddenly seemed to catch him in the pit of the stomach and everything\nwent black and he heard his voice starting to drool about newts. Yes, I\ncould follow the psychology.\n\nNevertheless, I found myself blaming Gussie. On discovering that he was\nstressing the newt note in this manner, he ought, of course, to have\ntuned out, even if it had meant sitting there saying nothing. No matter\nhow much of a twitter he was in, he should have had sense enough to see\nthat he was throwing a spanner into the works. No girl, when she has been\nled to expect that a man is about to pour forth his soul in a fervour of\npassion, likes to find him suddenly shelving the whole topic in favour of\nan address on aquatic Salamandridae.\n\n\"Bad, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And how long did this nuisance continue?\"\n\n\"For some not inconsiderable time, I gather, sir. According to Mr.\nFink-Nottle, he supplied Miss Bassett with very full and complete\ninformation not only with respect to the common newt, but also the\ncrested and palmated varieties. He described to her how newts, during\nthe breeding season, live in the water, subsisting upon tadpoles, insect\nlarvae, and crustaceans; how, later, they make their way to the land and\neat slugs and worms; and how the newly born newt has three pairs of long,\nplumlike, external gills. And he was just observing that newts differ\nfrom salamanders in the shape of the tail, which is compressed, and that\na marked sexual dimorphism prevails in most species, when the young lady\nrose and said that she thought she would go back to the house.\"\n\n\"And then----\"\n\n\"She went, sir.\"\n\nI stood musing. More and more, it was beginning to be borne in upon me\nwhat a particularly difficult chap Gussie was to help. He seemed to so\nmarked an extent to lack snap and finish. With infinite toil, you\nmanoeuvred him into a position where all he had to do was charge ahead,\nand he didn't charge ahead, but went off sideways, missing the objective\ncompletely.\n\n\"Difficult, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nIn happier circs., of course, I would have canvassed his views on the\nmatter. But after what had occurred in connection with that mess-jacket,\nmy lips were sealed.\n\n\"Well, I must think it over.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Burnish the brain a bit and endeavour to find the way out.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, good night, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"Good night, sir.\"\n\nHe shimmered off, leaving a pensive Bertram Wooster standing motionless\nin the shadows. It seemed to me that it was hard to know what to do for\nthe best.\n\n\n\n-12-\n\n\nI don't know if it has happened to you at all, but a thing I've noticed\nwith myself is that, when I'm confronted by a problem which seems for the\nmoment to stump and baffle, a good sleep will often bring the solution in\nthe morning.\n\nIt was so on the present occasion.\n\nThe nibs who study these matters claim, I believe, that this has got\nsomething to do with the subconscious mind, and very possibly they may be\nright. I wouldn't have said off-hand that I had a subconscious mind, but\nI suppose I must without knowing it, and no doubt it was there, sweating\naway diligently at the old stand, all the while the corporeal Wooster was\ngetting his eight hours.\n\nFor directly I opened my eyes on the morrow, I saw daylight. Well, I\ndon't mean that exactly, because naturally I did. What I mean is that I\nfound I had the thing all mapped out. The good old subconscious m. had\ndelivered the goods, and I perceived exactly what steps must be taken in\norder to put Augustus Fink-Nottle among the practising Romeos.\n\nI should like you, if you can spare me a moment of your valuable time, to\nthrow your mind back to that conversation he and I had had in the garden\non the previous evening. Not the glimmering landscape bit, I don't mean\nthat, but the concluding passages of it. Having done so, you will recall\nthat when he informed me that he never touched alcoholic liquor, I shook\nthe head a bit, feeling that this must inevitably weaken him as a force\nwhere proposing to girls was concerned.\n\nAnd events had shown that my fears were well founded.\n\nPut to the test, with nothing but orange juice inside him, he had proved\na complete bust. In a situation calling for words of molten passion of a\nnature calculated to go through Madeline Bassett like a red-hot gimlet\nthrough half a pound of butter, he had said not a syllable that could\nbring a blush to the cheek of modesty, merely delivering a well-phrased\nbut, in the circumstances, quite misplaced lecture on newts.\n\nA romantic girl is not to be won by such tactics. Obviously, before\nattempting to proceed further, Augustus Fink-Nottle must be induced to\nthrow off the shackling inhibitions of the past and fuel up. It must be a\nprimed, confident Fink-Nottle who squared up to the Bassett for Round No.\n2.\n\nOnly so could the _Morning Post_ make its ten bob, or whatever it is, for\nprinting the announcement of the forthcoming nuptials.\n\nHaving arrived at this conclusion I found the rest easy, and by the time\nJeeves brought me my tea I had evolved a plan complete in every detail.\nThis I was about to place before him--indeed, I had got as far as the\npreliminary \"I say, Jeeves\"--when we were interrupted by the arrival of\nTuppy.\n\nHe came listlessly into the room, and I was pained to observe that a\nnight's rest had effected no improvement in the unhappy wreck's\nappearance. Indeed, I should have said, if anything, that he was looking\nrather more moth-eaten than when I had seen him last. If you can\nvisualize a bulldog which has just been kicked in the ribs and had its\ndinner sneaked by the cat, you will have Hildebrand Glossop as he now\nstood before me.\n\n\"Stap my vitals, Tuppy, old corpse,\" I said, concerned, \"you're looking\npretty blue round the rims.\"\n\nJeeves slid from the presence in that tactful, eel-like way of his, and I\nmotioned the remains to take a seat.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" I said.\n\nHe came to anchor on the bed, and for awhile sat picking at the coverlet\nin silence.\n\n\"I've been through hell, Bertie.\"\n\n\"Through where?\"\n\n\"Hell.\"\n\n\"Oh, hell? And what took you there?\"\n\nOnce more he became silent, staring before him with sombre eyes.\nFollowing his gaze, I saw that he was looking at an enlarged photograph\nof my Uncle Tom in some sort of Masonic uniform which stood on the\nmantelpiece. I've tried to reason with Aunt Dahlia about this photograph\nfor years, placing before her two alternative suggestions: (a) To burn\nthe beastly thing; or (b) if she must preserve it, to shove me in\nanother room when I come to stay. But she declines to accede. She says\nit's good for me. A useful discipline, she maintains, teaching me that\nthere is a darker side to life and that we were not put into this world\nfor pleasure only.\n\n\"Turn it to the wall, if it hurts you, Tuppy,\" I said gently.\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"That photograph of Uncle Tom as the bandmaster.\"\n\n\"I didn't come here to talk about photographs. I came for sympathy.\"\n\n\"And you shall have it. What's the trouble? Worrying about Angela, I\nsuppose? Well, have no fear. I have another well-laid plan for\nencompassing that young shrimp. I'll guarantee that she will be weeping\non your neck before yonder sun has set.\"\n\nHe barked sharply.\n\n\"A fat chance!\"\n\n\"Tup, Tushy!\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"I mean 'Tush, Tuppy.' I tell you I will do it. I was just going to\ndescribe this plan of mine to Jeeves when you came in. Care to hear it?\"\n\n\"I don't want to hear any of your beastly plans. Plans are no good. She's\ngone and fallen in love with this other bloke, and now hates my gizzard.\"\n\n\"Rot.\"\n\n\"It isn't rot.\"\n\n\"I tell you, Tuppy, as one who can read the female heart, that this\nAngela loves you still.\"\n\n\"Well, it didn't look much like it in the larder last night.\"\n\n\"Oh, you went to the larder last night?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"And Angela was there?\"\n\n\"She was. And your aunt. Also your uncle.\"\n\nI saw that I should require foot-notes. All this was new stuff to me. I\nhad stayed at Brinkley Court quite a lot in my time, but I had no idea\nthe larder was such a social vortex. More like a snack bar on a\nrace-course than anything else, it seemed to have become.\n\n\"Tell me the whole story in your own words,\" I said, \"omitting no detail,\nhowever apparently slight, for one never knows how important the most\ntrivial detail may be.\"\n\nHe inspected the photograph for a moment with growing gloom.\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"This is what happened. You know my views about\nthat steak-and-kidney pie.\"\n\n\"Quite.\"\n\n\"Well, round about one a.m. I thought the time was ripe. I stole from my\nroom and went downstairs. The pie seemed to beckon me.\"\n\nI nodded. I knew how pies do.\n\n\"I got to the larder. I fished it out. I set it on the table. I found\nknife and fork. I collected salt, mustard, and pepper. There were some\ncold potatoes. I added those. And I was about to pitch in when I heard a\nsound behind me, and there was your aunt at the door. In a blue-and-yellow\ndressing gown.\"\n\n\"Embarrassing.\"\n\n\"Most.\"\n\n\"I suppose you didn't know where to look.\"\n\n\"I looked at Angela.\"\n\n\"She came in with my aunt?\"\n\n\"No. With your uncle, a minute or two later. He was wearing mauve pyjamas\nand carried a pistol. Have you ever seen your uncle in pyjamas and a\npistol?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"You haven't missed much.\"\n\n\"Tell me, Tuppy,\" I asked, for I was anxious to ascertain this, \"about\nAngela. Was there any momentary softening in her gaze as she fixed it on\nyou?\"\n\n\"She didn't fix it on me. She fixed it on the pie.\"\n\n\"Did she say anything?\"\n\n\"Not right away. Your uncle was the first to speak. He said to your aunt,\n'God bless my soul, Dahlia, what are you doing here?' To which she\nreplied, 'Well, if it comes to that, my merry somnambulist, what are\nyou?' Your uncle then said that he thought there must be burglars in the\nhouse, as he had heard noises.\"\n\nI nodded again. I could follow the trend. Ever since the scullery window\nwas found open the year Shining Light was disqualified in the Cesarewitch\nfor boring, Uncle Tom has had a marked complex about burglars. I can\nstill recall my emotions when, paying my first visit after he had bars\nput on all the windows and attempting to thrust the head out in order to\nget a sniff of country air, I nearly fractured my skull on a sort of iron\ngrille, as worn by the tougher kinds of mediaeval prison.\n\n\"'What sort of noises?' said your aunt. 'Funny noises,' said your uncle.\nWhereupon Angela--with a nasty, steely tinkle in her voice, the little\nbuzzard--observed, 'I expect it was Mr. Glossop eating.' And then she did\ngive me a look. It was the sort of wondering, revolted look a very\nspiritual woman would give a fat man gulping soup in a restaurant. The\nkind of look that makes a fellow feel he's forty-six round the waist and\nhas great rolls of superfluous flesh pouring down over the back of his\ncollar. And, still speaking in the same unpleasant tone, she added, 'I\nought to have told you, father, that Mr. Glossop always likes to have a\ngood meal three or four times during the night. It helps to keep him\ngoing till breakfast. He has the most amazing appetite. See, he has\npractically finished a large steak-and-kidney pie already'.\"\n\nAs he spoke these words, a feverish animation swept over Tuppy. His eyes\nglittered with a strange light, and he thumped the bed violently with his\nfist, nearly catching me a juicy one on the leg.\n\n\"That was what hurt, Bertie. That was what stung. I hadn't so much as\nstarted on that pie. But that's a woman all over.\"\n\n\"The eternal feminine.\"\n\n\"She continued her remarks. 'You've no idea,' she said, 'how Mr. Glossop\nloves food. He just lives for it. He always eats six or seven meals a\nday, and then starts in again after bedtime. I think it's rather\nwonderful.' Your aunt seemed interested, and said it reminded her of a\nboa constrictor. Angela said, didn't she mean a python? And then they\nargued as to which of the two it was. Your uncle, meanwhile, poking about\nwith that damned pistol of his till human life wasn't safe in the\nvicinity. And the pie lying there on the table, and me unable to touch\nit. You begin to understand why I said I had been through hell.\"\n\n\"Quite. Can't have been at all pleasant.\"\n\n\"Presently your aunt and Angela settled their discussion, deciding that\nAngela was right and that it was a python that I reminded them of. And\nshortly after that we all pushed back to bed, Angela warning me in a\nmotherly voice not to take the stairs too quickly. After seven or eight\nsolid meals, she said, a man of my build ought to be very careful,\nbecause of the danger of apoplectic fits. She said it was the same with\ndogs. When they became very fat and overfed, you had to see that they\ndidn't hurry upstairs, as it made them puff and pant, and that was bad\nfor their hearts. She asked your aunt if she remembered the late spaniel,\nAmbrose; and your aunt said, 'Poor old Ambrose, you couldn't keep him\naway from the garbage pail'; and Angela said, 'Exactly, so do please be\ncareful, Mr. Glossop.' And you tell me she loves me still!\"\n\nI did my best to encourage.\n\n\"Girlish banter, what?\"\n\n\"Girlish banter be dashed. She's right off me. Once her ideal, I am now\nless than the dust beneath her chariot wheels. She became infatuated with\nthis chap, whoever he was, at Cannes, and now she can't stand the sight\nof me.\"\n\nI raised my eyebrows.\n\n\"My dear Tuppy, you are not showing your usual good sense in this\nAngela-chap-at-Cannes matter. If you will forgive me saying so, you have\ngot an _id\u00c3\u00a9e fixe_.\"\n\n\"A what?\"\n\n\"An _id\u00c3\u00a9e fixe_. You know. One of those things fellows get. Like Uncle\nTom's delusion that everybody who is known even slightly to the police is\nlurking in the garden, waiting for a chance to break into the house. You\nkeep talking about this chap at Cannes, and there never was a chap at\nCannes, and I'll tell you why I'm so sure about this. During those two\nmonths on the Riviera, it so happens that Angela and I were practically\ninseparable. If there had been somebody nosing round her, I should have\nspotted it in a second.\"\n\nHe started. I could see that this had impressed him.\n\n\"Oh, she was with you all the time at Cannes, was she?\"\n\n\"I don't suppose she said two words to anybody else, except, of course,\nidle conv. at the crowded dinner table or a chance remark in a throng at\nthe Casino.\"\n\n\"I see. You mean that anything in the shape of mixed bathing and\nmoonlight strolls she conducted solely in your company?\"\n\n\"That's right. It was quite a joke in the hotel.\"\n\n\"You must have enjoyed that.\"\n\n\"Oh, rather. I've always been devoted to Angela.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes?\"\n\n\"When we were kids, she used to call herself my little sweetheart.\"\n\n\"She did?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nHe sat plunged in thought, while I, glad to have set his mind at rest,\nproceeded with my tea. And presently there came the banging of a gong\nfrom the hall below, and he started like a war horse at the sound of the\nbugle.\n\n\"Breakfast!\" he said, and was off to a flying start, leaving me to brood\nand ponder. And the more I brooded and pondered, the more did it seem to\nme that everything now looked pretty smooth. Tuppy, I could see, despite\nthat painful scene in the larder, still loved Angela with all the old\nfervour.\n\nThis meant that I could rely on that plan to which I had referred to\nbring home the bacon. And as I had found the way to straighten out the\nGussie-Bassett difficulty, there seemed nothing more to worry about.\n\nIt was with an uplifted heart that I addressed Jeeves as he came in to\nremove the tea tray.\n\n\n\n-13-\n\n\n\"Jeeves,\" I said.\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"I've just been having a chat with young Tuppy, Jeeves. Did you\nhappen to notice that he wasn't looking very roguish this morning?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. It seemed to me that Mr. Glossop's face was sicklied o'er with\nthe pale cast of thought.\"\n\n\"Quite. He met my cousin Angela in the larder last night, and a rather\npainful interview ensued.\"\n\n\"I am sorry, sir.\"\n\n\"Not half so sorry as he was. She found him closeted with a\nsteak-and-kidney pie, and appears to have been a bit caustic about fat\nmen who lived for food alone.\"\n\n\"Most disturbing, sir.\"\n\n\"Very. In fact, many people would say that things had gone so far between\nthese two nothing now could bridge the chasm. A girl who could make\ncracks about human pythons who ate nine or ten meals a day and ought to\nbe careful not to hurry upstairs because of the danger of apoplectic fits\nis a girl, many people would say, in whose heart love is dead. Wouldn't\npeople say that, Jeeves?\"\n\n\"Undeniably, sir.\"\n\n\"They would be wrong.\"\n\n\"You think so, sir?\"\n\n\"I am convinced of it. I know these females. You can't go by what they\nsay.\"\n\n\"You feel that Miss Angela's strictures should not be taken too much\n_au pied de la lettre_, sir?\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"In English, we should say 'literally'.\"\n\n\"Literally. That's exactly what I mean. You know what girls are. A tiff\noccurs, and they shoot their heads off. But underneath it all the old\nlove still remains. Am I correct?\"\n\n\"Quite correct, sir. The poet Scott----\"\n\n\"Right ho, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\n\"And in order to bring that old love whizzing to the surface once more,\nall that is required is the proper treatment.\"\n\n\"By 'proper treatment,' sir, you mean----\"\n\n\"Clever handling, Jeeves. A spot of the good old snaky work. I see what\nmust be done to jerk my Cousin Angela back to normalcy. I'll tell you,\nshall I?\"\n\n\"If you would be so kind, sir.\"\n\nI lit a cigarette, and eyed him keenly through the smoke. He waited\nrespectfully for me to unleash the words of wisdom. I must say for Jeeves\nthat--till, as he is so apt to do, he starts shoving his oar in and\ncavilling and obstructing--he makes a very good audience. I don't know if\nhe is actually agog, but he looks agog, and that's the great thing.\n\n\"Suppose you were strolling through the illimitable jungle, Jeeves, and\nhappened to meet a tiger cub.\"\n\n\"The contingency is a remote one, sir.\"\n\n\"Never mind. Let us suppose it.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\n\"Let us now suppose that you sloshed that tiger cub, and let us suppose\nfurther that word reached its mother that it was being put upon. What\nwould you expect the attitude of that mother to be? In what frame of mind\ndo you consider that that tigress would approach you?\"\n\n\"I should anticipate a certain show of annoyance, sir.\"\n\n\"And rightly. Due to what is known as the maternal instinct, what?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Very good, Jeeves. We will now suppose that there has recently been some\nlittle coolness between this tiger cub and this tigress. For some days,\nlet us say, they have not been on speaking terms. Do you think that that\nwould make any difference to the vim with which the latter would leap to\nthe former's aid?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Exactly. Here, then, in brief, is my plan, Jeeves. I am going to draw my\nCousin Angela aside to a secluded spot and roast Tuppy properly.\"\n\n\"Roast, sir?\"\n\n\"Knock. Slam. Tick-off. Abuse. Denounce. I shall be very terse about\nTuppy, giving it as my opinion that in all essentials he is more like a\nwart hog than an ex-member of a fine old English public school. What will\nensue? Hearing him attacked, my Cousin Angela's womanly heart will be as\nsick as mud. The maternal tigress in her will awake. No matter what\ndifferences they may have had, she will remember only that he is the man\nshe loves, and will leap to his defence. And from that to falling into\nhis arms and burying the dead past will be but a step. How do you react\nto that?\"\n\n\"The idea is an ingenious one, sir.\"\n\n\"We Woosters are ingenious, Jeeves, exceedingly ingenious.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact, I am not speaking without a knowledge of the form\nbook. I have tested this theory.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes, in person. And it works. I was standing on the Eden rock at Antibes\nlast month, idly watching the bathers disport themselves in the water,\nand a girl I knew slightly pointed at a male diver and asked me if I\ndidn't think his legs were about the silliest-looking pair of props ever\nissued to human being. I replied that I did, indeed, and for the space of\nperhaps two minutes was extraordinarily witty and satirical about this\nbird's underpinning. At the end of that period, I suddenly felt as if I\nhad been caught up in the tail of a cyclone.\n\n\"Beginning with a _critique_ of my own limbs, which she said, justly\nenough, were nothing to write home about, this girl went on to dissect my\nmanners, morals, intellect, general physique, and method of eating\nasparagus with such acerbity that by the time she had finished the best\nyou could say of Bertram was that, so far as was known, he had never\nactually committed murder or set fire to an orphan asylum. Subsequent\ninvestigation proved that she was engaged to the fellow with the legs and\nhad had a slight disagreement with him the evening before on the subject\nof whether she should or should not have made an original call of two\nspades, having seven, but without the ace. That night I saw them dining\ntogether with every indication of relish, their differences made up and\nthe lovelight once more in their eyes. That shows you, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I expect precisely similar results from my Cousin Angela when I start\nroasting Tuppy. By lunchtime, I should imagine, the engagement will be on\nagain and the diamond-and-platinum ring glittering as of yore on her\nthird finger. Or is it the fourth?\"\n\n\"Scarcely by luncheon time, sir. Miss Angela's maid informs me that Miss\nAngela drove off in her car early this morning with the intention of\nspending the day with friends in the vicinity.\"\n\n\"Well, within half an hour of whatever time she comes back, then. These\nare mere straws, Jeeves. Do not let us chop them.\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"The point is that, as far as Tuppy and Angela are concerned, we may say\nwith confidence that everything will shortly be hotsy-totsy once more.\nAnd what an agreeable thought that is, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"Very true, sir.\"\n\n\"If there is one thing that gives me the pip, it is two loving hearts\nbeing estranged.\"\n\n\"I can readily appreciate the fact, sir.\"\n\nI placed the stub of my gasper in the ash tray and lit another, to\nindicate that that completed Chap. I.\n\n\"Right ho, then. So much for the western front. We now turn to the\neastern.\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"I speak in parables, Jeeves. What I mean is, we now approach the matter\nof Gussie and Miss Bassett.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Here, Jeeves, more direct methods are required. In handling the case of\nAugustus Fink-Nottle, we must keep always in mind the fact that we are\ndealing with a poop.\"\n\n\"A sensitive plant would, perhaps, be a kinder expression, sir.\"\n\n\"No, Jeeves, a poop. And with poops one has to employ the strong,\nforceful, straightforward policy. Psychology doesn't get you anywhere.\nYou, if I may remind you without wounding your feelings, fell into the\nerror of mucking about with psychology in connection with this Fink-Nottle,\nand the result was a wash-out. You attempted to push him over the line by\nrigging him out in a Mephistopheles costume and sending him off to a\nfancy-dress ball, your view being that scarlet tights would embolden\nhim. Futile.\"\n\n\"The matter was never actually put to the test, sir.\"\n\n\"No. Because he didn't get to the ball. And that strengthens my argument.\nA man who can set out in a cab for a fancy-dress ball and not get there\nis manifestly a poop of no common order. I don't think I have ever known\nanybody else who was such a dashed silly ass that he couldn't even get to\na fancy-dress ball. Have you, Jeeves?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"But don't forget this, because it is the point I wish, above all, to\nmake: Even if Gussie had got to that ball; even if those scarlet tights,\ntaken in conjunction with his horn-rimmed spectacles, hadn't given the\ngirl a fit of some kind; even if she had rallied from the shock and he\nhad been able to dance and generally hobnob with her; even then your\nefforts would have been fruitless, because, Mephistopheles costume or no\nMephistopheles costume, Augustus Fink-Nottle would never have been able\nto summon up the courage to ask her to be his. All that would have\nresulted would have been that she would have got that lecture on newts a\nfew days earlier. And why, Jeeves? Shall I tell you why?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Because he would have been attempting the hopeless task of trying to do\nthe thing on orange juice.\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"Gussie is an orange-juice addict. He drinks nothing else.\"\n\n\"I was not aware of that, sir.\"\n\n\"I have it from his own lips. Whether from some hereditary taint, or\nbecause he promised his mother he wouldn't, or simply because he doesn't\nlike the taste of the stuff, Gussie Fink-Nottle has never in the whole\ncourse of his career pushed so much as the simplest gin and tonic over\nthe larynx. And he expects--this poop expects, Jeeves--this wabbling,\nshrinking, diffident rabbit in human shape expects under these conditions\nto propose to the girl he loves. One hardly knows whether to smile or\nweep, what?\"\n\n\"You consider total abstinence a handicap to a gentleman who wishes to\nmake a proposal of marriage, sir?\"\n\nThe question amazed me.\n\n\"Why, dash it,\" I said, astounded, \"you must know it is. Use your\nintelligence, Jeeves. Reflect what proposing means. It means that a\ndecent, self-respecting chap has got to listen to himself saying things\nwhich, if spoken on the silver screen, would cause him to dash to the\nbox-office and demand his money back. Let him attempt to do it on orange\njuice, and what ensues? Shame seals his lips, or, if it doesn't do that,\nmakes him lose his morale and start to babble. Gussie, for example, as we\nhave seen, babbles of syncopated newts.\"\n\n\"Palmated newts, sir.\"\n\n\"Palmated or syncopated, it doesn't matter which. The point is that he\nbabbles and is going to babble again, if he has another try at it.\nUnless--and this is where I want you to follow me very closely,\nJeeves--unless steps are taken at once through the proper channels. Only\nactive measures, promptly applied, can provide this poor, pusillanimous\npoop with the proper pep. And that is why, Jeeves, I intend tomorrow to\nsecure a bottle of gin and lace his luncheon orange juice with\nit liberally.\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\nI clicked the tongue.\n\n\"I have already had occasion, Jeeves,\" I said rebukingly, \"to comment on\nthe way you say 'Well, sir' and 'Indeed, sir?' I take this opportunity of\ninforming you that I object equally strongly to your 'Sir?' pure and\nsimple. The word seems to suggest that in your opinion I have made a\nstatement or mooted a scheme so bizarre that your brain reels at it. In\nthe present instance, there is absolutely nothing to say 'Sir?' about.\nThe plan I have put forward is entirely reasonable and icily logical, and\nshould excite no sirring whatsoever. Or don't you think so?\"\n\n\"Well, sir----\"\n\n\"Jeeves!\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir. The expression escaped me inadvertently. What I\nintended to say, since you press me, was that the action which you\npropose does seem to me somewhat injudicious.\"\n\n\"Injudicious? I don't follow you, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"A certain amount of risk would enter into it, in my opinion, sir. It is\nnot always a simple matter to gauge the effect of alcohol on a subject\nunaccustomed to such stimulant. I have known it to have distressing\nresults in the case of parrots.\"\n\n\"Parrots?\"\n\n\"I was thinking of an incident of my earlier life, sir, before I entered\nyour employment. I was in the service of the late Lord Brancaster at the\ntime, a gentleman who owned a parrot to which he was greatly devoted, and\none day the bird chanced to be lethargic, and his lordship, with the\nkindly intention of restoring it to its customary animation, offered it a\nportion of seed cake steeped in the '84 port. The bird accepted the\nmorsel gratefully and consumed it with every indication of satisfaction.\nAlmost immediately afterwards, however, its manner became markedly\nfeverish. Having bitten his lordship in the thumb and sung part of a\nsea-chanty, it fell to the bottom of the cage and remained there for a\nconsiderable period of time with its legs in the air, unable to move. I\nmerely mention this, sir, in order to----\"\n\nI put my finger on the flaw. I had spotted it all along.\n\n\"But Gussie isn't a parrot.\"\n\n\"No, sir, but----\"\n\n\"It is high time, in my opinion, that this question of what young Gussie\nreally is was threshed out and cleared up. He seems to think he is a male\nnewt, and you now appear to suggest that he is a parrot. The truth of the\nmatter being that he is just a plain, ordinary poop and needs a snootful\nas badly as ever man did. So no more discussion, Jeeves. My mind is made\nup. There is only one way of handling this difficult case, and that is\nthe way I have outlined.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\n\"Right ho, Jeeves. So much for that, then. Now here's something else: You\nnoticed that I said I was going to put this project through tomorrow, and\nno doubt you wondered why I said tomorrow. Why did I, Jeeves?\"\n\n\"Because you feel that if it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well\nit were done quickly, sir?\"\n\n\"Partly, Jeeves, but not altogether. My chief reason for fixing the date\nas specified is that tomorrow, though you have doubtless forgotten, is\nthe day of the distribution of prizes at Market Snodsbury Grammar School,\nat which, as you know, Gussie is to be the male star and master of the\nrevels. So you see we shall, by lacing that juice, not only embolden him\nto propose to Miss Bassett, but also put him so into shape that he will\nhold that Market Snodsbury audience spellbound.\"\n\n\"In fact, you will be killing two birds with one stone, sir.\"\n\n\"Exactly. A very neat way of putting it. And now here is a minor point.\nOn second thoughts, I think the best plan will be for you, not me, to\nlace the juice.\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"Jeeves!\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir.\"\n\n\"And I'll tell you why that will be the best plan. Because you are in a\nposition to obtain ready access to the stuff. It is served to Gussie\ndaily, I have noticed, in an individual jug. This jug will presumably be\nlying about the kitchen or somewhere before lunch tomorrow. It will be\nthe simplest of tasks for you to slip a few fingers of gin in it.\"\n\n\"No doubt, sir, but----\"\n\n\"Don't say 'but,' Jeeves.\"\n\n\"I fear, sir----\"\n\n\"'I fear, sir' is just as bad.\"\n\n\"What I am endeavouring to say, sir, is that I am sorry, but I am afraid\nI must enter an unequivocal _nolle prosequi_.\"\n\n\"Do what?\"\n\n\"The expression is a legal one, sir, signifying the resolve not to\nproceed with a matter. In other words, eager though I am to carry out\nyour instructions, sir, as a general rule, on this occasion I must\nrespectfully decline to co-operate.\"\n\n\"You won't do it, you mean?\"\n\n\"Precisely, sir.\"\n\nI was stunned. I began to understand how a general must feel when he has\nordered a regiment to charge and has been told that it isn't in the\nmood.\n\n\"Jeeves,\" I said, \"I had not expected this of you.\"\n\n\"No, sir?\"\n\n\"No, indeed. Naturally, I realize that lacing Gussie's orange juice is\nnot one of those regular duties for which you receive the monthly\nstipend, and if you care to stand on the strict letter of the contract, I\nsuppose there is nothing to be done about it. But you will permit me to\nobserve that this is scarcely the feudal spirit.\"\n\n\"I am sorry, sir.\"\n\n\"It is quite all right, Jeeves, quite all right. I am not angry, only a\nlittle hurt.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\n\"Right ho, Jeeves.\"\n\n\n\n-14-\n\n\nInvestigation proved that the friends Angela had gone to spend the day\nwith were some stately-home owners of the name of Stretchley-Budd,\nhanging out in a joint called Kingham Manor, about eight miles distant in\nthe direction of Pershore. I didn't know these birds, but their\nfascination must have been considerable, for she tore herself away from\nthem only just in time to get back and dress for dinner. It was,\naccordingly, not until coffee had been consumed that I was able to get\nmatters moving. I found her in the drawing-room and at once proceeded to\nput things in train.\n\nIt was with very different feelings from those which had animated the\nbosom when approaching the Bassett twenty-four hours before in the same\nmanner in this same drawing-room that I headed for where she sat. As I\nhad told Tuppy, I have always been devoted to Angela, and there is\nnothing I like better than a ramble in her company.\n\nAnd I could see by the look of her now how sorely in need she was of my\naid and comfort.\n\nFrankly, I was shocked by the unfortunate young prune's appearance. At\nCannes she had been a happy, smiling English girl of the best type, full\nof beans and buck. Her face now was pale and drawn, like that of a hockey\ncentre-forward at a girls' school who, in addition to getting a fruity\none on the shin, has just been penalized for \"sticks\". In any normal\ngathering, her demeanour would have excited instant remark, but the\nstandard of gloom at Brinkley Court had become so high that it passed\nunnoticed. Indeed, I shouldn't wonder if Uncle Tom, crouched in his\ncorner waiting for the end, didn't think she was looking indecently\ncheerful.\n\nI got down to the agenda in my debonair way.\n\n\"What ho, Angela, old girl.\"\n\n\"Hullo, Bertie, darling.\"\n\n\"Glad you're back at last. I missed you.\"\n\n\"Did you, darling?\"\n\n\"I did, indeed. Care to come for a saunter?\"\n\n\"I'd love it.\"\n\n\"Fine. I have much to say to you that is not for the public ear.\"\n\nI think at this moment poor old Tuppy must have got a sudden touch of\ncramp. He had been sitting hard by, staring at the ceiling, and he now\ngave a sharp leap like a gaffed salmon and upset a small table containing\na vase, a bowl of potpourri, two china dogs, and a copy of Omar Khayy\u00c3\u00a1m\nbound in limp leather.\n\nAunt Dahlia uttered a startled hunting cry. Uncle Tom, who probably\nimagined from the noise that this was civilization crashing at last,\nhelped things along by breaking a coffee-cup.\n\nTuppy said he was sorry. Aunt Dahlia, with a deathbed groan, said it\ndidn't matter. And Angela, having stared haughtily for a moment like a\nprincess of the old r\u00c3\u00a9gime confronted by some notable example of\ngaucherie on the part of some particularly foul member of the underworld,\naccompanied me across the threshold. And presently I had deposited her\nand self on one of the rustic benches in the garden, and was ready to\nsnap into the business of the evening.\n\nI considered it best, however, before doing so, to ease things along with\na little informal chitchat. You don't want to rush a delicate job like\nthe one I had in hand. And so for a while we spoke of neutral topics. She\nsaid that what had kept her so long at the Stretchley-Budds was that\nHilda Stretchley-Budd had made her stop on and help with the arrangements\nfor their servants' ball tomorrow night, a task which she couldn't very\nwell decline, as all the Brinkley Court domestic staff were to be\npresent. I said that a jolly night's revelry might be just what was\nneeded to cheer Anatole up and take his mind off things. To which she\nreplied that Anatole wasn't going. On being urged to do so by Aunt\nDahlia, she said, he had merely shaken his head sadly and gone on talking\nof returning to Provence, where he was appreciated.\n\nIt was after the sombre silence induced by this statement that Angela\nsaid the grass was wet and she thought she would go in.\n\nThis, of course, was entirely foreign to my policy.\n\n\"No, don't do that. I haven't had a chance to talk to you since you\narrived.\"\n\n\"I shall ruin my shoes.\"\n\n\"Put your feet up on my lap.\"\n\n\"All right. And you can tickle my ankles.\"\n\n\"Quite.\"\n\nMatters were accordingly arranged on these lines, and for some minutes we\ncontinued chatting in desultory fashion. Then the conversation petered\nout. I made a few observations _in re_ the scenic effects, featuring the\ntwilight hush, the peeping stars, and the soft glimmer of the waters of\nthe lake, and she said yes. Something rustled in the bushes in front of\nus, and I advanced the theory that it was possibly a weasel, and she said\nit might be. But it was plain that the girl was distraite, and I\nconsidered it best to waste no more time.\n\n\"Well, old thing,\" I said, \"I've heard all about your little dust-up So\nthose wedding bells are not going to ring out, what?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Definitely over, is it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, if you want my opinion, I think that's a bit of goose for you,\nAngela, old girl. I think you're extremely well out of it. It's a mystery\nto me how you stood this Glossop so long. Take him for all in all, he\nranks very low down among the wines and spirits. A washout, I should\ndescribe him as. A frightful oik, and a mass of side to boot. I'd pity\nthe girl who was linked for life to a bargee like Tuppy Glossop.\"\n\nAnd I emitted a hard laugh--one of the sneering kind.\n\n\"I always thought you were such friends,\" said Angela.\n\nI let go another hard one, with a bit more top spin on it than the first\ntime:\n\n\"Friends? Absolutely not. One was civil, of course, when one met the\nfellow, but it would be absurd to say one was a friend of his. A club\nacquaintance, and a mere one at that. And then one was at school with the\nman.\"\n\n\"At Eton?\"\n\n\"Good heavens, no. We wouldn't have a fellow like that at Eton. At a\nkid's school before I went there. A grubby little brute he was, I\nrecollect. Covered with ink and mire generally, washing only on alternate\nThursdays. In short, a notable outsider, shunned by all.\"\n\nI paused. I was more than a bit perturbed. Apart from the agony of having\nto talk in this fashion of one who, except when he was looping back rings\nand causing me to plunge into swimming baths in correct evening costume,\nhad always been a very dear and esteemed crony, I didn't seem to be\ngetting anywhere. Business was not resulting. Staring into the bushes\nwithout a yip, she appeared to be bearing these slurs and innuendos of\nmine with an easy calm.\n\nI had another pop at it:\n\n\"'Uncouth' about sums it up. I doubt if I've ever seen an uncouther kid\nthan this Glossop. Ask anyone who knew him in those days to describe him\nin a word, and the word they will use is 'uncouth'. And he's just the\nsame today. It's the old story. The boy is the father of the man.\"\n\nShe appeared not to have heard.\n\n\"The boy,\" I repeated, not wishing her to miss that one, \"is the father\nof the man.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"I'm talking about this Glossop.\"\n\n\"I thought you said something about somebody's father.\"\n\n\"I said the boy was the father of the man.\"\n\n\"What boy?\"\n\n\"The boy Glossop.\"\n\n\"He hasn't got a father.\"\n\n\"I never said he had. I said he was the father of the boy--or, rather, of\nthe man.\"\n\n\"What man?\"\n\nI saw that the conversation had reached a point where, unless care was\ntaken, we should be muddled.\n\n\"The point I am trying to make,\" I said, \"is that the boy Glossop is the\nfather of the man Glossop. In other words, each loathsome fault and\nblemish that led the boy Glossop to be frowned upon by his fellows is\npresent in the man Glossop, and causes him--I am speaking now of the man\nGlossop--to be a hissing and a byword at places like the Drones, where a\ncertain standard of decency is demanded from the inmates. Ask anyone at\nthe Drones, and they will tell you that it was a black day for the dear\nold club when this chap Glossop somehow wriggled into the list of\nmembers. Here you will find a man who dislikes his face; there one who\ncould stand his face if it wasn't for his habits. But the universal\nconsensus of opinion is that the fellow is a bounder and a tick, and that\nthe moment he showed signs of wanting to get into the place he should\nhave been met with a firm _nolle prosequi_ and heartily blackballed.\"\n\nI had to pause again here, partly in order to take in a spot of breath,\nand partly to wrestle with the almost physical torture of saying these\nfrightful things about poor old Tuppy.\n\n\"There are some chaps,\" I resumed, forcing myself once more to the\nnauseous task, \"who, in spite of looking as if they had slept in their\nclothes, can get by quite nicely because they are amiable and suave.\nThere are others who, for all that they excite adverse comment by being\nfat and uncouth, find themselves on the credit side of the ledger owing\nto their wit and sparkling humour. But this Glossop, I regret to say,\nfalls into neither class. In addition to looking like one of those things\nthat come out of hollow trees, he is universally admitted to be a dumb\nbrick of the first water. No soul. No conversation. In short, any girl\nwho, having been rash enough to get engaged to him, has managed at the\neleventh hour to slide out is justly entitled to consider herself dashed\nlucky.\"\n\nI paused once more, and cocked an eye at Angela to see how the treatment\nwas taking. All the while I had been speaking, she had sat gazing\nsilently into the bushes, but it seemed to me incredible that she should\nnot now turn on me like a tigress, according to specifications. It beat\nme why she hadn't done it already. It seemed to me that a mere tithe of\nwhat I had said, if said to a tigress about a tiger of which she was\nfond, would have made her--the tigress, I mean--hit the ceiling.\n\nAnd the next moment you could have knocked me down with a toothpick.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, nodding thoughtfully, \"you're quite right.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"That's exactly what I've been thinking myself.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"'Dumb brick.' It just describes him. One of the six silliest asses in\nEngland, I should think he must be.\"\n\nI did not speak. I was endeavouring to adjust the faculties, which were\nin urgent need of a bit of first-aid treatment.\n\nI mean to say, all this had come as a complete surprise. In formulating\nthe well-laid plan which I had just been putting into effect, the one\ncontingency I had not budgeted for was that she might adhere to the\nsentiments which I expressed. I had braced myself for a gush of stormy\nemotion. I was expecting the tearful ticking off, the girlish\nrecriminations and all the rest of the bag of tricks along those lines.\n\nBut this cordial agreement with my remarks I had not foreseen, and it\ngave me what you might call pause for thought.\n\nShe proceeded to develop her theme, speaking in ringing, enthusiastic\ntones, as if she loved the topic. Jeeves could tell you the word I want.\nI think it's \"ecstatic\", unless that's the sort of rash you get on your\nface and have to use ointment for. But if that is the right word, then\nthat's what her manner was as she ventilated the subject of poor old\nTuppy. If you had been able to go simply by the sound of her voice, she\nmight have been a court poet cutting loose about an Oriental monarch, or\nGussie Fink-Nottle describing his last consignment of newts.\n\n\"It's so nice, Bertie, talking to somebody who really takes a sensible\nview about this man Glossop. Mother says he's a good chap, which is\nsimply absurd. Anybody can see that he's absolutely impossible. He's\nconceited and opinionative and argues all the time, even when he knows\nperfectly well that he's talking through his hat, and he smokes too much\nand eats too much and drinks too much, and I don't like the colour of his\nhair. Not that he'll have any hair in a year or two, because he's pretty\nthin on the top already, and before he knows where he is he'll be as bald\nas an egg, and he's the last man who can afford to go bald. And I think\nit's simply disgusting, the way he gorges all the time. Do you know, I\nfound him in the larder at one o'clock this morning, absolutely wallowing\nin a steak-and-kidney pie? There was hardly any of it left. And you\nremember what an enormous dinner he had. Quite disgusting, I call it. But\nI can't stop out here all night, talking about men who aren't worth\nwasting a word on and haven't even enough sense to tell sharks from\nflatfish. I'm going in.\"\n\nAnd gathering about her slim shoulders the shawl which she had put on as\na protection against the evening dew, she buzzed off, leaving me alone in\nthe silent night.\n\nWell, as a matter of fact, not absolutely alone, because a few moments\nlater there was a sort of upheaval in the bushes in front of me, and\nTuppy emerged.\n\n\n\n-15-\n\n\nI gave him the eye. The evening had begun to draw in a bit by now and the\nvisibility, in consequence, was not so hot, but there still remained\nample light to enable me to see him clearly. And what I saw convinced me\nthat I should be a lot easier in my mind with a stout rustic bench\nbetween us. I rose, accordingly, modelling my style on that of a\nrocketing pheasant, and proceeded to deposit myself on the other side of\nthe object named.\n\nMy prompt agility was not without its effect. He seemed somewhat taken\naback. He came to a halt, and, for about the space of time required to\nallow a bead of persp. to trickle from the top of the brow to the tip of\nthe nose, stood gazing at me in silence.\n\n\"So!\" he said at length, and it came as a complete surprise to me that\nfellows ever really do say \"So!\" I had always thought it was just a thing\nyou read in books. Like \"Quotha!\" I mean to say, or \"Odds bodikins!\" or\neven \"Eh, ba goom!\"\n\nStill, there it was. Quaint or not quaint, bizarre or not bizarre, he had\nsaid \"So!\" and it was up to me to cope with the situation on those lines.\n\nIt would have been a duller man than Bertram Wooster who had failed to\nnote that the dear old chap was a bit steamed up. Whether his eyes were\nactually shooting forth flame, I couldn't tell you, but there appeared to\nme to be a distinct incandescence. For the rest, his fists were clenched,\nhis ears quivering, and the muscles of his jaw rotating rhythmically, as\nif he were making an early supper off something.\n\nHis hair was full of twigs, and there was a beetle hanging to the side of\nhis head which would have interested Gussie Fink-Nottle. To this,\nhowever, I paid scant attention. There is a time for studying beetles and\na time for not studying beetles.\n\n\"So!\" he said again.\n\nNow, those who know Bertram Wooster best will tell you that he is always\nat his shrewdest and most level-headed in moments of peril. Who was it\nwho, when gripped by the arm of the law on boat-race night not so many\nyears ago and hauled off to Vine Street police station, assumed in a\nflash the identity of Eustace H. Plimsoll, of The Laburnums, Alleyn Road,\nWest Dulwich, thus saving the grand old name of Wooster from being\ndragged in the mire and avoiding wide publicity of the wrong sort? Who\nwas it ...\n\nBut I need not labour the point. My record speaks for itself. Three times\npinched, but never once sentenced under the correct label. Ask anyone at\nthe Drones about this.\n\nSo now, in a situation threatening to become every moment more scaly, I\ndid not lose my head. I preserved the old sang-froid. Smiling a genial\nand affectionate smile, and hoping that it wasn't too dark for it to\nregister, I spoke with a jolly cordiality:\n\n\"Why, hallo, Tuppy. You here?\"\n\nHe said, yes, he was here.\n\n\"Been here long?\"\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"Fine. I wanted to see you.\"\n\n\"Well, here I am. Come out from behind that bench.\"\n\n\"No, thanks, old man. I like leaning on it. It seems to rest the spine.\"\n\n\"In about two seconds,\" said Tuppy, \"I'm going to kick your spine up\nthrough the top of your head.\"\n\nI raised the eyebrows. Not much good, of course, in that light, but it\nseemed to help the general composition.\n\n\"Is this Hildebrand Glossop speaking?\" I said.\n\nHe replied that it was, adding that if I wanted to make sure I might move\na few feet over in his direction. He also called me an opprobrious name.\n\nI raised the eyebrows again.\n\n\"Come, come, Tuppy, don't let us let this little chat become acrid. Is\n'acrid' the word I want?\"\n\n\"I couldn't say,\" he replied, beginning to sidle round the bench.\n\nI saw that anything I might wish to say must be said quickly. Already he\nhad sidled some six feet. And though, by dint of sidling, too, I had\nmanaged to keep the bench between us, who could predict how long this\nhappy state of affairs would last?\n\nI came to the point, therefore.\n\n\"I think I know what's on your mind, Tuppy,\" I said. \"If you were in\nthose bushes during my conversation with the recent Angela, I dare say\nyou heard what I was saying about you.\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"I see. Well, we won't go into the ethics of the thing. Eavesdropping,\nsome people might call it, and I can imagine stern critics drawing in the\nbreath to some extent. Considering it--I don't want to hurt your\nfeelings, Tuppy--but considering it un-English. A bit un-English, Tuppy,\nold man, you must admit.\"\n\n\"I'm Scotch.\"\n\n\"Really?\" I said. \"I never knew that before. Rummy how you don't suspect\na man of being Scotch unless he's Mac-something and says 'Och, aye' and\nthings like that. I wonder,\" I went on, feeling that an academic\ndiscussion on some neutral topic might ease the tension, \"if you can tell\nme something that has puzzled me a good deal. What exactly is it that\nthey put into haggis? I've often wondered about that.\"\n\nFrom the fact that his only response to the question was to leap over the\nbench and make a grab at me, I gathered that his mind was not on haggis.\n\n\"However,\" I said, leaping over the bench in my turn, \"that is a side\nissue. If, to come back to it, you were in those bushes and heard what I\nwas saying about you----\"\n\nHe began to move round the bench in a nor'-nor'-easterly direction. I\nfollowed his example, setting a course sou'-sou'-west.\n\n\"No doubt you were surprised at the way I was talking.\"\n\n\"Not a bit.\"\n\n\"What? Did nothing strike you as odd in the tone of my remarks?\"\n\n\"It was just the sort of stuff I should have expected a treacherous,\nsneaking hound like you to say.\"\n\n\"My dear chap,\" I protested, \"this is not your usual form. A bit slow in\nthe uptake, surely? I should have thought you would have spotted right\naway that it was all part of a well-laid plan.\"\n\n\"I'll get you in a jiffy,\" said Tuppy, recovering his balance after a\nswift clutch at my neck. And so probable did this seem that I delayed no\nlonger, but hastened to place all the facts before him.\n\nSpeaking rapidly and keeping moving, I related my emotions on receipt of\nAunt Dahlia's telegram, my instant rush to the scene of the disaster, my\nmeditations in the car, and the eventual framing of this well-laid plan\nof mine. I spoke clearly and well, and it was with considerable concern,\nconsequently, that I heard him observe--between clenched teeth, which\nmade it worse--that he didn't believe a damned word of it.\n\n\"But, Tuppy,\" I said, \"why not? To me the thing rings true to the last\ndrop. What makes you sceptical? Confide in me, Tuppy.\"\n\nHe halted and stood taking a breather. Tuppy, pungently though Angela\nmight have argued to the contrary, isn't really fat. During the winter\nmonths you will find him constantly booting the football with merry\nshouts, and in the summer the tennis racket is seldom out of his hand.\n\nBut at the recently concluded evening meal, feeling, no doubt, that after\nthat painful scene in the larder there was nothing to be gained by\nfurther abstinence, he had rather let himself go and, as it were, made up\nleeway; and after really immersing himself in one of Anatole's dinners, a\nman of his sturdy build tends to lose elasticity a bit. During the\nexposition of my plans for his happiness a certain animation had crept\ninto this round-and-round-the mulberry-bush jamboree of ours--so much so,\nindeed, that for the last few minutes we might have been a rather\noversized greyhound and a somewhat slimmer electric hare doing their\nstuff on a circular track for the entertainment of the many-headed.\n\nThis, it appeared, had taken it out of him a bit, and I was not\ndispleased. I was feeling the strain myself, and welcomed a lull.\n\n\"It absolutely beats me why you don't believe it,\" I said. \"You know\nwe've been pals for years. You must be aware that, except at the moment\nwhen you caused me to do a nose dive into the Drones' swimming bath, an\nincident which I long since decided to put out of my mind and let the\ndead past bury its dead about, if you follow what I mean--except on that\none occasion, as I say, I have always regarded you with the utmost\nesteem. Why, then, if not for the motives I have outlined, should I knock\nyou to Angela? Answer me that. Be very careful.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, be very careful?\"\n\nWell, as a matter of fact, I didn't quite know myself. It was what the\nmagistrate had said to me on the occasion when I stood in the dock as\nEustace Plimsoll, of The Laburnums: and as it had impressed me a good\ndeal at the time, I just bunged it in now by way of giving the\nconversation a tone.\n\n\"All right. Never mind about being careful, then. Just answer me that\nquestion. Why, if I had not your interests sincerely at heart, should I\nhave ticked you off, as stated?\"\n\nA sharp spasm shook him from base to apex. The beetle, which, during the\nrecent exchanges, had been clinging to his head, hoping for the best,\ngave it up at this and resigned office. It shot off and was swallowed in\nthe night.\n\n\"Ah!\" I said. \"Your beetle,\" I explained. \"No doubt you were unaware of\nit, but all this while there has been a beetle of sorts parked on the\nside of your head. You have now dislodged it.\"\n\nHe snorted.\n\n\"Beetles!\"\n\n\"Not beetles. One beetle only.\"\n\n\"I like your crust!\" cried Tuppy, vibrating like one of Gussie's newts\nduring the courting season. \"Talking of beetles, when all the time you\nknow you're a treacherous, sneaking hound.\"\n\nIt was a debatable point, of course, why treacherous, sneaking hounds\nshould be considered ineligible to talk about beetles, and I dare say a\ngood cross-examining counsel would have made quite a lot of it.\n\nBut I let it go.\n\n\"That's the second time you've called me that. And,\" I said firmly, \"I\ninsist on an explanation. I have told you that I acted throughout from\nthe best and kindliest motives in roasting you to Angela. It cut me to\nthe quick to have to speak like that, and only the recollection of our\nlifelong friendship would have made me do it. And now you say you don't\nbelieve me and call me names for which I am not sure I couldn't have you\nup before a beak and jury and mulct you in very substantial damages. I\nshould have to consult my solicitor, of course, but it would surprise me\nvery much if an action did not lie. Be reasonable, Tuppy. Suggest another\nmotive I could have had. Just one.\"\n\n\"I will. Do you think I don't know? You're in love with Angela yourself.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"And you knocked me in order to poison her mind against me and finally\nremove me from your path.\"\n\nI had never heard anything so absolutely loopy in my life. Why, dash it,\nI've known Angela since she was so high. You don't fall in love with\nclose relations you've known since they were so high. Besides, isn't\nthere something in the book of rules about a man may not marry his\ncousin? Or am I thinking of grandmothers?\n\n\"Tuppy, my dear old ass,\" I cried, \"this is pure banana oil! You've come\nunscrewed.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes?\"\n\n\"Me in love with Angela? Ha-ha!\"\n\n\"You can't get out of it with ha-ha's. She called you 'darling'.\"\n\n\"I know. And I disapproved. This habit of the younger g. of scattering\n'darlings' about like birdseed is one that I deprecate. Lax, is how I\nshould describe it.\"\n\n\"You tickled her ankles.\"\n\n\"In a purely cousinly spirit. It didn't mean a thing. Why, dash it, you\nmust know that in the deeper and truer sense I wouldn't touch Angela with\na barge pole.\"\n\n\"Oh? And why not? Not good enough for you?\"\n\n\"You misunderstand me,\" I hastened to reply. \"When I say I wouldn't touch\nAngela with a barge pole, I intend merely to convey that my feelings\ntowards her are those of distant, though cordial, esteem. In other words,\nyou may rest assured that between this young prune and myself there never\nhas been and never could be any sentiment warmer and stronger than that\nof ordinary friendship.\"\n\n\"I believe it was you who tipped her off that I was in the larder last\nnight, so that she could find me there with that pie, thus damaging my\nprestige.\"\n\n\"My dear Tuppy! A Wooster?\" I was shocked. \"You think a Wooster would do\nthat?\"\n\nHe breathed heavily.\n\n\"Listen,\" he said. \"It's no good your standing there arguing. You can't\nget away from the facts. Somebody stole her from me at Cannes. You told\nme yourself that she was with you all the time at Cannes and hardly saw\nanybody else. You gloated over the mixed bathing, and those moonlight\nwalks you had together----\"\n\n\"Not gloated. Just mentioned them.\"\n\n\"So now you understand why, as soon as I can get you clear of this damned\nbench, I am going to tear you limb from limb. Why they have these bally\nbenches in gardens,\" said Tuppy discontentedly, \"is more than I can see.\nThey only get in the way.\"\n\nHe ceased, and, grabbing out, missed me by a hair's breadth.\n\nIt was a moment for swift thinking, and it is at such moments, as I have\nalready indicated, that Bertram Wooster is at his best. I suddenly\nremembered the recent misunderstanding with the Bassett, and with a flash\nof clear vision saw that this was where it was going to come in handy.\n\n\"You've got it all wrong, Tuppy,\" I said, moving to the left. \"True, I\nsaw a lot of Angela, but my dealings with her were on a basis from start\nto finish of the purest and most wholesome camaraderie. I can prove it.\nDuring that sojourn in Cannes my affections were engaged elsewhere.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Engaged elsewhere. My affections. During that sojourn.\"\n\nI had struck the right note. He stopped sidling. His clutching hand fell\nto his side.\n\n\"Is that true?\"\n\n\"Quite official.\"\n\n\"Who was she?\"\n\n\"My dear Tuppy, does one bandy a woman's name?\"\n\n\"One does if one doesn't want one's ruddy head pulled off.\"\n\nI saw that it was a special case.\n\n\"Madeline Bassett,\" I said.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Madeline Bassett.\"\n\nHe seemed stunned.\n\n\"You stand there and tell me you were in love with that Bassett\ndisaster?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't call her 'that Bassett disaster', Tuppy. Not respectful.\"\n\n\"Dash being respectful. I want the facts. You deliberately assert that\nyou loved that weird Gawd-help-us?\"\n\n\"I don't see why you should call her a weird Gawd-help-us, either. A very\ncharming and beautiful girl. Odd in some of her views perhaps--one does\nnot quite see eye to eye with her in the matter of stars and rabbits--but\nnot a weird Gawd-help-us.\"\n\n\"Anyway, you stick to it that you were in love with her?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"It sounds thin to me, Wooster, very thin.\"\n\nI saw that it would be necessary to apply the finishing touch.\n\n\"I must ask you to treat this as entirely confidential, Glossop, but I\nmay as well inform you that it is not twenty-four hours since she turned\nme down.\"\n\n\"Turned you down?\"\n\n\"Like a bedspread. In this very garden.\"\n\n\"Twenty-four hours?\"\n\n\"Call it twenty-five. So you will readily see that I can't be the chap,\nif any, who stole Angela from you at Cannes.\"\n\nAnd I was on the brink of adding that I wouldn't touch Angela with a\nbarge pole, when I remembered I had said it already and it hadn't gone\nfrightfully well. I desisted, therefore.\n\nMy manly frankness seemed to be producing good results. The homicidal\nglare was dying out of Tuppy's eyes. He had the aspect of a hired\nassassin who had paused to think things over.\n\n\"I see,\" he said, at length. \"All right, then. Sorry you were troubled.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it, old man,\" I responded courteously.\n\nFor the first time since the bushes had begun to pour forth Glossops,\nBertram Wooster could be said to have breathed freely. I don't say I\nactually came out from behind the bench, but I did let go of it, and with\nsomething of the relief which those three chaps in the Old Testament must\nhave experienced after sliding out of the burning fiery furnace, I even\ngroped tentatively for my cigarette case.\n\nThe next moment a sudden snort made me take my fingers off it as if it\nhad bitten me. I was distressed to note in the old friend a return of the\nrecent frenzy.\n\n\"What the hell did you mean by telling her that I used to be covered with\nink when I was a kid?\"\n\n\"My dear Tuppy----\"\n\n\"I was almost finickingly careful about my personal cleanliness as a boy.\nYou could have eaten your dinner off me.\"\n\n\"Quite. But----\"\n\n\"And all that stuff about having no soul. I'm crawling with soul. And\nbeing looked on as an outsider at the Drones----\"\n\n\"But, my dear old chap, I explained that. It was all part of my ruse or\nscheme.\"\n\n\"It was, was it? Well, in future do me a favour and leave me out of your\nfoul ruses.\"\n\n\"Just as you say, old boy.\"\n\n\"All right, then. That's understood.\"\n\nHe relapsed into silence, standing with folded arms, staring before him\nrather like a strong, silent man in a novel when he's just been given the\nbird by the girl and is thinking of looking in at the Rocky Mountains and\nbumping off a few bears. His manifest pippedness excited my compash, and\nI ventured a kindly word.\n\n\"I don't suppose you know what _au pied de la lettre_ means, Tuppy, but\nthat's how I don't think you ought to take all that stuff Angela was\nsaying just now too much.\"\n\nHe seemed interested.\n\n\"What the devil,\" he asked, \"are you talking about?\"\n\nI saw that I should have to make myself clearer.\n\n\"Don't take all that guff of hers too literally, old man. You know what\ngirls are like.\"\n\n\"I do,\" he said, with another snort that came straight up from his\ninsteps. \"And I wish I'd never met one.\"\n\n\"I mean to say, it's obvious that she must have spotted you in those\nbushes and was simply talking to score off you. There you were, I mean,\nif you follow the psychology, and she saw you, and in that impulsive way\ngirls have, she seized the opportunity of ribbing you a bit--just told\nyou a few home truths, I mean to say.\"\n\n\"Home truths?\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\nHe snorted once more, causing me to feel rather like royalty receiving a\ntwenty-one gun salute from the fleet. I can't remember ever having met a\nbetter right-and-left-hand snorter.\n\n\"What do you mean, 'home truths'? I'm not fat.\"\n\n\"No, no.\"\n\n\"And what's wrong with the colour of my hair?\"\n\n\"Quite in order, Tuppy, old man. The hair, I mean.\"\n\n\"And I'm not a bit thin on the top.... What the dickens are you grinning\nabout?\"\n\n\"Not grinning. Just smiling slightly. I was conjuring up a sort of\nvision, if you know what I mean, of you as seen through Angela's eyes.\nFat in the middle and thin on the top. Rather funny.\"\n\n\"You think it funny, do you?\"\n\n\"Not a bit.\"\n\n\"You'd better not.\"\n\n\"Quite.\"\n\nIt seemed to me that the conversation was becoming difficult again. I\nwished it could be terminated. And so it was. For at this moment\nsomething came shimmering through the laurels in the quiet evenfall, and\nI perceived that it was Angela.\n\nShe was looking sweet and saintlike, and she had a plate of sandwiches in\nher hand. Ham, I was to discover later.\n\n\"If you see Mr. Glossop anywhere, Bertie,\" she said, her eyes resting\ndreamily on Tuppy's facade, \"I wish you would give him these. I'm so\nafraid he may be hungry, poor fellow. It's nearly ten o'clock, and he\nhasn't eaten a morsel since dinner. I'll just leave them on this bench.\"\n\nShe pushed off, and it seemed to me that I might as well go with her.\nNothing to keep me here, I mean. We moved towards the house, and\npresently from behind us there sounded in the night the splintering crash\nof a well-kicked plate of ham sandwiches, accompanied by the muffled\noaths of a strong man in his wrath.\n\n\"How still and peaceful everything is,\" said Angela.\n\n\n\n-16-\n\n\nSunshine was gilding the grounds of Brinkley Court and the ear detected a\nmarked twittering of birds in the ivy outside the window when I woke next\nmorning to a new day. But there was no corresponding sunshine in Bertram\nWooster's soul and no answering twitter in his heart as he sat up in bed,\nsipping his cup of strengthening tea. It could not be denied that to\nBertram, reviewing the happenings of the previous night, the Tuppy-Angela\nsituation seemed more or less to have slipped a cog. With every desire to\nlook for the silver lining, I could not but feel that the rift between\nthese two haughty spirits had now reached such impressive proportions\nthat the task of bridging same would be beyond even my powers.\n\nI am a shrewd observer, and there had been something in Tuppy's manner as\nhe booted that plate of ham sandwiches that seemed to tell me that he\nwould not lightly forgive.\n\nIn these circs., I deemed it best to shelve their problem for the nonce\nand turn the mind to the matter of Gussie, which presented a brighter\npicture.\n\nWith regard to Gussie, everything was in train. Jeeves's morbid scruples\nabout lacing the chap's orange juice had put me to a good deal of\ntrouble, but I had surmounted every obstacle in the old Wooster way. I\nhad secured an abundance of the necessary spirit, and it was now lying in\nits flask in the drawer of the dressing-table. I had also ascertained\nthat the jug, duly filled, would be standing on a shelf in the butler's\npantry round about the hour of one. To remove it from that shelf, sneak\nit up to my room, and return it, laced, in good time for the midday meal\nwould be a task calling, no doubt, for address, but in no sense an\nexacting one.\n\nIt was with something of the emotions of one preparing a treat for a\ndeserving child that I finished my tea and rolled over for that extra\nspot of sleep which just makes all the difference when there is man's\nwork to be done and the brain must be kept clear for it.\n\nAnd when I came downstairs an hour or so later, I knew how right I had\nbeen to formulate this scheme for Gussie's bucking up. I ran into him on\nthe lawn, and I could see at a glance that if ever there was a man who\nneeded a snappy stimulant, it was he. All nature, as I have indicated,\nwas smiling, but not Augustus Fink-Nottle. He was walking round in\ncircles, muttering something about not proposing to detain us long, but\non this auspicious occasion feeling compelled to say a few words.\n\n\"Ah, Gussie,\" I said, arresting him as he was about to start another lap.\n\"A lovely morning, is it not?\"\n\nEven if I had not been aware of it already, I could have divined from the\nabruptness with which he damned the lovely morning that he was not in\nmerry mood. I addressed myself to the task of bringing the roses back to\nhis cheeks.\n\n\"I've got good news for you, Gussie.\"\n\nHe looked at me with a sudden sharp interest.\n\n\"Has Market Snodsbury Grammar School burned down?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of.\"\n\n\"Have mumps broken out? Is the place closed on account of measles?\"\n\n\"No, no.\"\n\n\"Then what do you mean you've got good news?\"\n\nI endeavoured to soothe.\n\n\"You mustn't take it so hard, Gussie. Why worry about a laughably simple\njob like distributing prizes at a school?\"\n\n\"Laughably simple, eh? Do you realize I've been sweating for days and\nhaven't been able to think of a thing to say yet, except that I won't\ndetain them long. You bet I won't detain them long. I've been timing my\nspeech, and it lasts five seconds. What the devil am I to say, Bertie?\nWhat do you say when you're distributing prizes?\"\n\nI considered. Once, at my private school, I had won a prize for Scripture\nknowledge, so I suppose I ought to have been full of inside stuff. But\nmemory eluded me.\n\nThen something emerged from the mists.\n\n\"You say the race is not always to the swift.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Well, it's a good gag. It generally gets a hand.\"\n\n\"I mean, why isn't it? Why isn't the race to the swift?\"\n\n\"Ah, there you have me. But the nibs say it isn't.\"\n\n\"But what does it mean?\"\n\n\"I take it it's supposed to console the chaps who haven't won prizes.\"\n\n\"What's the good of that to me? I'm not worrying about them. It's the\nones that have won prizes that I'm worrying about, the little blighters\nwho will come up on the platform. Suppose they make faces at me.\"\n\n\"They won't.\"\n\n\"How do you know they won't? It's probably the first thing they'll think\nof. And even if they don't--Bertie, shall I tell you something?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I've a good mind to take that tip of yours and have a drink.\"\n\nI smiled. He little knew, about summed up what I was thinking.\n\n\"Oh, you'll be all right,\" I said.\n\nHe became fevered again.\n\n\"How do you know I'll be all right? I'm sure to blow up in my lines.\"\n\n\"Tush!\"\n\n\"Or drop a prize.\"\n\n\"Tut!\"\n\n\"Or something. I can feel it in my bones. As sure as I'm standing here,\nsomething is going to happen this afternoon which will make everybody\nlaugh themselves sick at me. I can hear them now. Like hyenas....\nBertie!\"\n\n\"Hullo?\"\n\n\"Do you remember that kids' school we went to before Eton?\"\n\n\"Quite. It was there I won my Scripture prize.\"\n\n\"Never mind about your Scripture prize. I'm not talking about your\nScripture prize. Do you recollect the Bosher incident?\"\n\nI did, indeed. It was one of the high spots of my youth.\n\n\"Major-General Sir Wilfred Bosher came to distribute the prizes at that\nschool,\" proceeded Gussie in a dull, toneless voice. \"He dropped a book.\nHe stooped to pick it up. And, as he stooped, his trousers split up the\nback.\"\n\n\"How we roared!\"\n\nGussie's face twisted.\n\n\"We did, little swine that we were. Instead of remaining silent and\nexhibiting a decent sympathy for a gallant officer at a peculiarly\nembarrassing moment, we howled and yelled with mirth. I loudest of any.\nThat is what will happen to me this afternoon, Bertie. It will be a\njudgment on me for laughing like that at Major-General Sir Wilfred\nBosher.\"\n\n\"No, no, Gussie, old man. Your trousers won't split.\"\n\n\"How do you know they won't? Better men than I have split their trousers.\nGeneral Bosher was a D.S.O., with a fine record of service on the\nnorth-western frontier of India, and his trousers split. I shall be a\nmockery and a scorn. I know it. And you, fully cognizant of what I am in\nfor, come babbling about good news. What news could possibly be good to me\nat this moment except the information that bubonic plague had broken out\namong the scholars of Market Snodsbury Grammar School, and that they were\nall confined to their beds with spots?\"\n\nThe moment had come for me to speak. I laid a hand gently on his\nshoulder. He brushed it off. I laid it on again. He brushed it off once\nmore. I was endeavouring to lay it on for the third time, when he moved\naside and desired, with a certain petulance, to be informed if I thought\nI was a ruddy osteopath.\n\nI found his manner trying, but one has to make allowances. I was telling\nmyself that I should be seeing a very different Gussie after lunch.\n\n\"When I said I had good news, old man, I meant about Madeline Bassett.\"\n\nThe febrile gleam died out of his eyes, to be replaced by a look of\ninfinite sadness.\n\n\"You can't have good news about her. I've dished myself there completely.\"\n\n\"Not at all. I am convinced that if you take another whack at her, all\nwill be well.\"\n\nAnd, keeping it snappy, I related what had passed between the Bassett and\nmyself on the previous night.\n\n\"So all you have to do is play a return date, and you cannot fail to\nswing the voting. You are her dream man.\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"No use.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Not a bit of good trying.\"\n\n\"But I tell you she said in so many words----\"\n\n\"It doesn't make any difference. She may have loved me once. Last night\nwill have killed all that.\"\n\n\"Of course it won't.\"\n\n\"It will. She despises me now.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it. She knows you simply got cold feet.\"\n\n\"And I should get cold feet if I tried again. It's no good, Bertie. I'm\nhopeless, and there's an end of it. Fate made me the sort of chap who\ncan't say 'bo' to a goose.\"\n\n\"It isn't a question of saying 'bo' to a goose. The point doesn't arise\nat all. It is simply a matter of----\"\n\n\"I know, I know. But it's no good. I can't do it. The whole thing is off.\nI am not going to risk a repetition of last night's fiasco. You talk in a\nlight way of taking another whack at her, but you don't know what it\nmeans. You have not been through the experience of starting to ask the\ngirl you love to marry you and then suddenly finding yourself talking\nabout the plumlike external gills of the newly-born newt. It's not a\nthing you can do twice. No, I accept my destiny. It's all over. And now,\nBertie, like a good chap, shove off. I want to compose my speech. I can't\ncompose my speech with you mucking around. If you are going to continue\nto muck around, at least give me a couple of stories. The little hell\nhounds are sure to expect a story or two.\"\n\n\"Do you know the one about----\"\n\n\"No good. I don't want any of your off-colour stuff from the Drones'\nsmoking-room. I need something clean. Something that will be a help to\nthem in their after lives. Not that I care a damn about their after\nlives, except that I hope they'll all choke.\"\n\n\"I heard a story the other day. I can't quite remember it, but it was\nabout a chap who snored and disturbed the neighbours, and it ended, 'It\nwas his adenoids that adenoid them.'\"\n\nHe made a weary gesture.\n\n\"You expect me to work that in, do you, into a speech to be delivered to\nan audience of boys, every one of whom is probably riddled with adenoids?\nDamn it, they'd rush the platform. Leave me, Bertie. Push off. That's all\nI ask you to do. Push off.... Ladies and gentlemen,\" said Gussie, in a\nlow, soliloquizing sort of way, \"I do not propose to detain this\nauspicious occasion long----\"\n\nIt was a thoughtful Wooster who walked away and left him at it. More than\never I was congratulating myself on having had the sterling good sense to\nmake all my arrangements so that I could press a button and set things\nmoving at an instant's notice.\n\nUntil now, you see, I had rather entertained a sort of hope that when I\nhad revealed to him the Bassett's mental attitude, Nature would have done\nthe rest, bracing him up to such an extent that artificial stimulants\nwould not be required. Because, naturally, a chap doesn't want to have to\nsprint about country houses lugging jugs of orange juice, unless it is\nabsolutely essential.\n\nBut now I saw that I must carry on as planned. The total absence of pep,\nginger, and the right spirit which the man had displayed during these\nconversational exchanges convinced me that the strongest measures would\nbe necessary. Immediately upon leaving him, therefore, I proceeded to the\npantry, waited till the butler had removed himself elsewhere, and nipped\nin and secured the vital jug. A few moments later, after a wary passage\nof the stairs, I was in my room. And the first thing I saw there was\nJeeves, fooling about with trousers.\n\nHe gave the jug a look which--wrongly, as it was to turn out--I diagnosed\nas censorious. I drew myself up a bit. I intended to have no rot from the\nfellow.\n\n\"Yes, Jeeves?\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"You have the air of one about to make a remark, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, sir. I note that you are in possession of Mr. Fink-Nottle's\norange juice. I was merely about to observe that in my opinion it would\nbe injudicious to add spirit to it.\"\n\n\"That is a remark, Jeeves, and it is precisely----\"\n\n\"Because I have already attended to the matter, sir.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I decided, after all, to acquiesce in your wishes.\"\n\nI stared at the man, astounded. I was deeply moved. Well, I mean,\nwouldn't any chap who had been going about thinking that the old feudal\nspirit was dead and then suddenly found it wasn't have been deeply moved?\n\n\"Jeeves,\" I said, \"I am touched.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\n\n\"Touched and gratified.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much, sir.\"\n\n\"But what caused this change of heart?\"\n\n\"I chanced to encounter Mr. Fink-Nottle in the garden, sir, while you\nwere still in bed, and we had a brief conversation.\"\n\n\"And you came away feeling that he needed a bracer?\"\n\n\"Very much so, sir. His attitude struck me as defeatist.\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"I felt the same. 'Defeatist' sums it up to a nicety. Did you tell him\nhis attitude struck you as defeatist?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"But it didn't do any good?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Very well, then, Jeeves. We must act. How much gin did you put in the\njug?\"\n\n\"A liberal tumblerful, sir.\"\n\n\"Would that be a normal dose for an adult defeatist, do you think?\"\n\n\"I fancy it should prove adequate, sir.\"\n\n\"I wonder. We must not spoil the ship for a ha'porth of tar. I think I'll\nadd just another fluid ounce or so.\"\n\n\"I would not advocate it, sir. In the case of Lord Brancaster's\nparrot----\"\n\n\"You are falling into your old error, Jeeves, of thinking that Gussie is\na parrot. Fight against this. I shall add the oz.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\n\"And, by the way, Jeeves, Mr. Fink-Nottle is in the market for bright,\nclean stories to use in his speech. Do you know any?\"\n\n\"I know a story about two Irishmen, sir.\"\n\n\"Pat and Mike?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Who were walking along Broadway?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Just what he wants. Any more?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, every little helps. You had better go and tell it to him.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\nHe passed from the room, and I unscrewed the flask and tilted into the\njug a generous modicum of its contents. And scarcely had I done so, when\nthere came to my ears the sound of footsteps without. I had only just\ntime to shove the jug behind the photograph of Uncle Tom on the\nmantelpiece before the door opened and in came Gussie, curveting like a\ncircus horse.\n\n\"What-ho, Bertie,\" he said. \"What-ho, what-ho, what-ho, and again\nwhat-ho. What a beautiful world this is, Bertie. One of the nicest I\never met.\"\n\nI stared at him, speechless. We Woosters are as quick as lightning, and I\nsaw at once that something had happened.\n\nI mean to say, I told you about him walking round in circles. I recorded\nwhat passed between us on the lawn. And if I portrayed the scene with\nanything like adequate skill, the picture you will have retained of this\nFink-Nottle will have been that of a nervous wreck, sagging at the knees,\ngreen about the gills, and picking feverishly at the lapels of his coat\nin an ecstasy of craven fear. In a word, defeatist. Gussie, during that\ninterview, had, in fine, exhibited all the earmarks of one licked to a\ncustard.\n\nVastly different was the Gussie who stood before me now. Self-confidence\nseemed to ooze from the fellow's every pore. His face was flushed, there\nwas a jovial light in his eyes, the lips were parted in a swashbuckling\nsmile. And when with a genial hand he sloshed me on the back before I\ncould sidestep, it was as if I had been kicked by a mule.\n\n\"Well, Bertie,\" he proceeded, as blithely as a linnet without a thing on\nhis mind, \"you will be glad to hear that you were right. Your theory has\nbeen tested and proved correct. I feel like a fighting cock.\"\n\nMy brain ceased to reel. I saw all.\n\n\"Have you been having a drink?\"\n\n\"I have. As you advised. Unpleasant stuff. Like medicine. Burns your\nthroat, too, and makes one as thirsty as the dickens. How anyone can mop\nit up, as you do, for pleasure, beats me. Still, I would be the last to\ndeny that it tunes up the system. I could bite a tiger.\"\n\n\"What did you have?\"\n\n\"Whisky. At least, that was the label on the decanter, and I have no\nreason to suppose that a woman like your aunt--staunch, true-blue,\nBritish--would deliberately deceive the public. If she labels her\ndecanters Whisky, then I consider that we know where we are.\"\n\n\"A whisky and soda, eh? You couldn't have done better.\"\n\n\"Soda?\" said Gussie thoughtfully. \"I knew there was something I had\nforgotten.\"\n\n\"Didn't you put any soda in it?\"\n\n\"It never occurred to me. I just nipped into the dining-room and drank\nout of the decanter.\"\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"Oh, about ten swallows. Twelve, maybe. Or fourteen. Say sixteen\nmedium-sized gulps. Gosh, I'm thirsty.\"\n\nHe moved over to the wash-stand and drank deeply out of the water bottle.\nI cast a covert glance at Uncle Tom's photograph behind his back. For the\nfirst time since it had come into my life, I was glad that it was so\nlarge. It hid its secret well. If Gussie had caught sight of that jug of\norange juice, he would unquestionably have been on to it like a knife.\n\n\"Well, I'm glad you're feeling braced,\" I said.\n\nHe moved buoyantly from the wash-hand stand, and endeavoured to slosh me\non the back again. Foiled by my nimble footwork, he staggered to the bed\nand sat down upon it.\n\n\"Braced? Did I say I could bite a tiger?\"\n\n\"You did.\"\n\n\"Make it two tigers. I could chew holes in a steel door. What an ass you\nmust have thought me out there in the garden. I see now you were laughing\nin your sleeve.\"\n\n\"No, no.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" insisted Gussie. \"That very sleeve,\" he said, pointing. \"And I\ndon't blame you. I can't imagine why I made all that fuss about a potty\njob like distributing prizes at a rotten little country grammar school.\nCan you imagine, Bertie?\"\n\n\"Exactly. Nor can I imagine. There's simply nothing to it. I just shin up\non the platform, drop a few gracious words, hand the little blighters\ntheir prizes, and hop down again, admired by all. Not a suggestion of\nsplit trousers from start to finish. I mean, why should anybody split his\ntrousers? I can't imagine. Can you imagine?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Nor can I imagine. I shall be a riot. I know just the sort of stuff\nthat's needed--simple, manly, optimistic stuff straight from the\nshoulder. This shoulder,\" said Gussie, tapping. \"Why I was so nervous\nthis morning I can't imagine. For anything simpler than distributing a\nfew footling books to a bunch of grimy-faced kids I can't imagine. Still,\nfor some reason I can't imagine, I was feeling a little nervous, but now\nI feel fine, Bertie--fine, fine, fine--and I say this to you as an old\nfriend. Because that's what you are, old man, when all the smoke has\ncleared away--an old friend. I don't think I've ever met an older friend.\nHow long have you been an old friend of mine, Bertie?\"\n\n\"Oh, years and years.\"\n\n\"Imagine! Though, of course, there must have been a time when you were a\nnew friend.... Hullo, the luncheon gong. Come on, old friend.\"\n\nAnd, rising from the bed like a performing flea, he made for the door.\n\nI followed rather pensively. What had occurred was, of course, so much\nvelvet, as you might say. I mean, I had wanted a braced Fink-Nottle--\nindeed, all my plans had had a braced Fink-Nottle as their end and aim\n--but I found myself wondering a little whether the Fink-Nottle now\nsliding down the banister wasn't, perhaps, a shade too braced. His\ndemeanour seemed to me that of a man who might quite easily throw bread\nabout at lunch.\n\nFortunately, however, the settled gloom of those round him exercised a\nrestraining effect upon him at the table. It would have needed a far more\nplastered man to have been rollicking at such a gathering. I had told the\nBassett that there were aching hearts in Brinkley Court, and it now\nlooked probable that there would shortly be aching tummies. Anatole, I\nlearned, had retired to his bed with a fit of the vapours, and the meal\nnow before us had been cooked by the kitchen maid--as C3 a performer as\never wielded a skillet.\n\nThis, coming on top of their other troubles, induced in the company a\npretty unanimous silence--a solemn stillness, as you might say--which\neven Gussie did not seem prepared to break. Except, therefore, for one\nshort snatch of song on his part, nothing untoward marked the occasion,\nand presently we rose, with instructions from Aunt Dahlia to put on\nfestal raiment and be at Market Snodsbury not later than 3.30. This\nleaving me ample time to smoke a gasper or two in a shady bower beside\nthe lake, I did so, repairing to my room round about the hour of three.\n\nJeeves was on the job, adding the final polish to the old topper, and I\nwas about to apprise him of the latest developments in the matter of\nGussie, when he forestalled me by observing that the latter had only just\nconcluded an agreeable visit to the Wooster bedchamber.\n\n\"I found Mr. Fink-Nottle seated here when I arrived to lay out your\nclothes, sir.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Jeeves? Gussie was in here, was he?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. He left only a few moments ago. He is driving to the school\nwith Mr. and Mrs. Travers in the large car.\"\n\n\"Did you give him your story of the two Irishmen?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. He laughed heartily.\"\n\n\"Good. Had you any other contributions for him?\"\n\n\"I ventured to suggest that he might mention to the young gentlemen that\neducation is a drawing out, not a putting in. The late Lord Brancaster\nwas much addicted to presenting prizes at schools, and he invariably\nemployed this dictum.\"\n\n\"And how did he react to that?\"\n\n\"He laughed heartily, sir.\"\n\n\"This surprised you, no doubt? This practically incessant merriment, I\nmean.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You thought it odd in one who, when you last saw him, was well up in\nGroup A of the defeatists.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"There is a ready explanation, Jeeves. Since you last saw him, Gussie has\nbeen on a bender. He's as tight as an owl.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. His nerve cracked under the strain, and he sneaked into the\ndining-room and started mopping the stuff up like a vacuum cleaner.\nWhisky would seem to be what he filled the radiator with. I gather that\nhe used up most of the decanter. Golly, Jeeves, it's lucky he didn't get\nat that laced orange juice on top of that, what?\"\n\n\"Extremely, sir.\"\n\nI eyed the jug. Uncle Tom's photograph had fallen into the fender, and it\nwas standing there right out in the open, where Gussie couldn't have\nhelped seeing it. Mercifully, it was empty now.\n\n\"It was a most prudent act on your part, if I may say so, sir, to dispose\nof the orange juice.\"\n\nI stared at the man.\n\n\"What? Didn't you?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Jeeves, let us get this clear. Was it not you who threw away that o.j.?\"\n\n\"No, sir. I assumed, when I entered the room and found the pitcher empty,\nthat you had done so.\"\n\nWe looked at each other, awed. Two minds with but a single thought.\n\n\"I very much fear, sir----\"\n\n\"So do I, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"It would seem almost certain----\"\n\n\"Quite certain. Weigh the facts. Sift the evidence. The jug was standing\non the mantelpiece, for all eyes to behold. Gussie had been complaining\nof thirst. You found him in here, laughing heartily. I think that there\ncan be little doubt, Jeeves, that the entire contents of that jug are at\nthis moment reposing on top of the existing cargo in that already\nbrilliantly lit man's interior. Disturbing, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"Most disturbing, sir.\"\n\n\"Let us face the position, forcing ourselves to be calm. You inserted in\nthat jug--shall we say a tumblerful of the right stuff?\"\n\n\"Fully a tumblerful, sir.\"\n\n\"And I added of my plenty about the same amount.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And in two shakes of a duck's tail Gussie, with all that lapping about\ninside him, will be distributing the prizes at Market Snodsbury Grammar\nSchool before an audience of all that is fairest and most refined in the\ncounty.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"It seems to me, Jeeves, that the ceremony may be one fraught with\nconsiderable interest.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"What, in your opinion, will the harvest be?\"\n\n\"One finds it difficult to hazard a conjecture, sir.\"\n\n\"You mean imagination boggles?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nI inspected my imagination. He was right. It boggled.\n\n\n\n-17-\n\n\n\"And yet, Jeeves,\" I said, twiddling a thoughtful steering wheel, \"there\nis always the bright side.\"\n\nSome twenty minutes had elapsed, and having picked the honest fellow up\noutside the front door, I was driving in the two-seater to the\npicturesque town of Market Snodsbury. Since we had parted--he to go to\nhis lair and fetch his hat, I to remain in my room and complete the\nformal costume--I had been doing some close thinking.\n\nThe results of this I now proceeded to hand on to him.\n\n\"However dark the prospect may be, Jeeves, however murkily the storm\nclouds may seem to gather, a keen eye can usually discern the blue bird.\nIt is bad, no doubt, that Gussie should be going, some ten minutes from\nnow, to distribute prizes in a state of advanced intoxication, but we\nmust never forget that these things cut both ways.\"\n\n\"You imply, sir----\"\n\n\"Precisely. I am thinking of him in his capacity of wooer. All this ought\nto have put him in rare shape for offering his hand in marriage. I shall\nbe vastly surprised if it won't turn him into a sort of caveman. Have you\never seen James Cagney in the movies?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Something on those lines.\"\n\nI heard him cough, and sniped him with a sideways glance. He was wearing\nthat informative look of his.\n\n\"Then you have not heard, sir?\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"You are not aware that a marriage has been arranged and will shortly\ntake place between Mr. Fink-Nottle and Miss Bassett?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"When did this happen?\"\n\n\"Shortly after Mr. Fink-Nottle had left your room, sir.\"\n\n\"Ah! In the post-orange-juice era?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"But are you sure of your facts? How do you know?\"\n\n\"My informant was Mr. Fink-Nottle himself, sir. He appeared anxious to\nconfide in me. His story was somewhat incoherent, but I had no difficulty\nin apprehending its substance. Prefacing his remarks with the statement\nthat this was a beautiful world, he laughed heartily and said that he had\nbecome formally engaged.\"\n\n\"No details?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"But one can picture the scene.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I mean, imagination doesn't boggle.\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\nAnd it didn't. I could see exactly what must have happened. Insert a\nliberal dose of mixed spirits in a normally abstemious man, and he\nbecomes a force. He does not stand around, twiddling his fingers and\nstammering. He acts. I had no doubt that Gussie must have reached for the\nBassett and clasped her to him like a stevedore handling a sack of coals.\nAnd one could readily envisage the effect of that sort of thing on a girl\nof romantic mind.\n\n\"Well, well, well, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"This is splendid news.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You see now how right I was.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"It must have been rather an eye-opener for you, watching me handle this\ncase.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"The simple, direct method never fails.\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Whereas the elaborate does.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Right ho, Jeeves.\"\n\nWe had arrived at the main entrance of Market Snodsbury Grammar School. I\nparked the car, and went in, well content. True, the Tuppy-Angela problem\nstill remained unsolved and Aunt Dahlia's five hundred quid seemed as far\noff as ever, but it was gratifying to feel that good old Gussie's\ntroubles were over, at any rate.\n\nThe Grammar School at Market Snodsbury had, I understood, been built\nsomewhere in the year 1416, and, as with so many of these ancient\nfoundations, there still seemed to brood over its Great Hall, where the\nafternoon's festivities were to take place, not a little of the fug of\nthe centuries. It was the hottest day of the summer, and though somebody\nhad opened a tentative window or two, the atmosphere remained distinctive\nand individual.\n\nIn this hall the youth of Market Snodsbury had been eating its daily\nlunch for a matter of five hundred years, and the flavour lingered. The\nair was sort of heavy and languorous, if you know what I mean, with the\nscent of Young England and boiled beef and carrots.\n\nAunt Dahlia, who was sitting with a bevy of the local nibs in the second\nrow, sighted me as I entered and waved to me to join her, but I was too\nsmart for that. I wedged myself in among the standees at the back,\nleaning up against a chap who, from the aroma, might have been a corn\nchandler or something on that order. The essence of strategy on these\noccasions is to be as near the door as possible.\n\nThe hall was gaily decorated with flags and coloured paper, and the eye\nwas further refreshed by the spectacle of a mixed drove of boys, parents,\nand what not, the former running a good deal to shiny faces and Eton\ncollars, the latter stressing the black-satin note rather when female,\nand looking as if their coats were too tight, if male. And presently\nthere was some applause--sporadic, Jeeves has since told me it was--and I\nsaw Gussie being steered by a bearded bloke in a gown to a seat in the\nmiddle of the platform.\n\nAnd I confess that as I beheld him and felt that there but for the grace\nof God went Bertram Wooster, a shudder ran through the frame. It all\nreminded me so vividly of the time I had addressed that girls' school.\n\nOf course, looking at it dispassionately, you may say that for horror and\nperil there is no comparison between an almost human audience like the\none before me and a mob of small girls with pigtails down their backs,\nand this, I concede, is true. Nevertheless, the spectacle was enough to\nmake me feel like a fellow watching a pal going over Niagara Falls in a\nbarrel, and the thought of what I had escaped caused everything for a\nmoment to go black and swim before my eyes.\n\nWhen I was able to see clearly once more, I perceived that Gussie was now\nseated. He had his hands on his knees, with his elbows out at right\nangles, like a nigger minstrel of the old school about to ask Mr. Bones\nwhy a chicken crosses the road, and he was staring before him with a\nsmile so fixed and pebble-beached that I should have thought that anybody\ncould have guessed that there sat one in whom the old familiar juice was\nplashing up against the back of the front teeth.\n\nIn fact, I saw Aunt Dahlia, who, having assisted at so many hunting\ndinners in her time, is second to none as a judge of the symptoms, give a\nstart and gaze long and earnestly. And she was just saying something to\nUncle Tom on her left when the bearded bloke stepped to the footlights\nand started making a speech. From the fact that he spoke as if he had a\nhot potato in his mouth without getting the raspberry from the lads in\nthe ringside seats, I deduced that he must be the head master.\n\nWith his arrival in the spotlight, a sort of perspiring resignation\nseemed to settle on the audience. Personally, I snuggled up against the\nchandler and let my attention wander. The speech was on the subject of\nthe doings of the school during the past term, and this part of a\nprize-giving is always apt rather to fail to grip the visiting stranger.\nI mean, you know how it is. You're told that J.B. Brewster has won an\nExhibition for Classics at Cat's, Cambridge, and you feel that it's one\nof those stories where you can't see how funny it is unless you really\nknow the fellow. And the same applies to G. Bullett being awarded the\nLady Jane Wix Scholarship at the Birmingham College of Veterinary\nScience.\n\nIn fact, I and the corn chandler, who was looking a bit fagged I thought,\nas if he had had a hard morning chandling the corn, were beginning to\ndoze lightly when things suddenly brisked up, bringing Gussie into the\npicture for the first time.\n\n\"Today,\" said the bearded bloke, \"we are all happy to welcome as the\nguest of the afternoon Mr. Fitz-Wattle----\"\n\nAt the beginning of the address, Gussie had subsided into a sort of\ndaydream, with his mouth hanging open. About half-way through, faint\nsigns of life had begun to show. And for the last few minutes he had been\ntrying to cross one leg over the other and failing and having another\nshot and failing again. But only now did he exhibit any real animation.\nHe sat up with a jerk.\n\n\"Fink-Nottle,\" he said, opening his eyes.\n\n\"Fitz-Nottle.\"\n\n\"Fink-Nottle.\"\n\n\"I should say Fink-Nottle.\"\n\n\"Of course you should, you silly ass,\" said Gussie genially. \"All right,\nget on with it.\"\n\nAnd closing his eyes, he began trying to cross his legs again.\n\nI could see that this little spot of friction had rattled the bearded\nbloke a bit. He stood for a moment fumbling at the fungus with a\nhesitating hand. But they make these head masters of tough stuff. The\nweakness passed. He came back nicely and carried on.\n\n\"We are all happy, I say, to welcome as the guest of the afternoon Mr.\nFink-Nottle, who has kindly consented to award the prizes. This task, as\nyou know, is one that should have devolved upon that well-beloved and\nvigorous member of our board of governors, the Rev. William Plomer, and\nwe are all, I am sure, very sorry that illness at the last moment should\nhave prevented him from being here today. But, if I may borrow a familiar\nmetaphor from the--if I may employ a homely metaphor familiar to you\nall--what we lose on the swings we gain on the roundabouts.\"\n\nHe paused, and beamed rather freely, to show that this was comedy. I\ncould have told the man it was no use. Not a ripple. The corn chandler\nleaned against me and muttered \"Whoddidesay?\" but that was all.\n\nIt's always a nasty jar to wait for the laugh and find that the gag\nhasn't got across. The bearded bloke was visibly discomposed. At that,\nhowever, I think he would have got by, had he not, at this juncture,\nunfortunately stirred Gussie up again.\n\n\"In other words, though deprived of Mr. Plomer, we have with us this\nafternoon Mr. Fink-Nottle. I am sure that Mr. Fink-Nottle's name is one\nthat needs no introduction to you. It is, I venture to assert, a name\nthat is familiar to us all.\"\n\n\"Not to you,\" said Gussie.\n\nAnd the next moment I saw what Jeeves had meant when he had described him\nas laughing heartily. \"Heartily\" was absolutely the _mot juste_. It\nsounded like a gas explosion.\n\n\"You didn't seem to know it so dashed well, what, what?\" said Gussie.\nAnd, reminded apparently by the word \"what\" of the word \"Wattle,\" he\nrepeated the latter some sixteen times with a rising inflection.\n\n\"Wattle, Wattle, Wattle,\" he concluded. \"Right-ho. Push on.\"\n\nBut the bearded bloke had shot his bolt. He stood there, licked at last;\nand, watching him closely, I could see that he was now at the crossroads.\nI could spot what he was thinking as clearly as if he had confided it to\nmy personal ear. He wanted to sit down and call it a day, I mean, but the\nthought that gave him pause was that, if he did, he must then either\nuncork Gussie or take the Fink-Nottle speech as read and get straight on\nto the actual prize-giving.\n\nIt was a dashed tricky thing, of course, to have to decide on the spur of\nthe moment. I was reading in the paper the other day about those birds\nwho are trying to split the atom, the nub being that they haven't the\nfoggiest as to what will happen if they do. It may be all right. On the\nother hand, it may not be all right. And pretty silly a chap would feel,\nno doubt, if, having split the atom, he suddenly found the house going up\nin smoke and himself torn limb from limb.\n\nSo with the bearded bloke. Whether he was abreast of the inside facts in\nGussie's case, I don't know, but it was obvious to him by this time that\nhe had run into something pretty hot. Trial gallops had shown that Gussie\nhad his own way of doing things. Those interruptions had been enough to\nprove to the perspicacious that here, seated on the platform at the big\nbinge of the season, was one who, if pushed forward to make a speech,\nmight let himself go in a rather epoch-making manner.\n\nOn the other hand, chain him up and put a green-baize cloth over him, and\nwhere were you? The proceeding would be over about half an hour too soon.\n\nIt was, as I say, a difficult problem to have to solve, and, left to\nhimself, I don't know what conclusion he would have come to. Personally,\nI think he would have played it safe. As it happened, however, the thing\nwas taken out of his hands, for at this moment, Gussie, having stretched\nhis arms and yawned a bit, switched on that pebble-beached smile again\nand tacked down to the edge of the platform.\n\n\"Speech,\" he said affably.\n\nHe then stood with his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat, waiting\nfor the applause to die down.\n\nIt was some time before this happened, for he had got a very fine hand\nindeed. I suppose it wasn't often that the boys of Market Snodsbury\nGrammar School came across a man public-spirited enough to call their\nhead master a silly ass, and they showed their appreciation in no\nuncertain manner. Gussie may have been one over the eight, but as far as\nthe majority of those present were concerned he was sitting on top of the\nworld.\n\n\"Boys,\" said Gussie, \"I mean ladies and gentlemen and boys, I do not\ndetain you long, but I suppose on this occasion to feel compelled to say\na few auspicious words; Ladies--and boys and gentlemen--we have all\nlistened with interest to the remarks of our friend here who forgot to\nshave this morning--I don't know his name, but then he didn't know\nmine--Fitz-Wattle, I mean, absolutely absurd--which squares things up a\nbit--and we are all sorry that the Reverend What-ever-he-was-called should\nbe dying of adenoids, but after all, here today, gone tomorrow, and all\nflesh is as grass, and what not, but that wasn't what I wanted to say.\nWhat I wanted to say was this--and I say it confidently--without fear of\ncontradiction--I say, in short, I am happy to be here on this auspicious\noccasion and I take much pleasure in kindly awarding the prizes,\nconsisting of the handsome books you see laid out on that table. As\nShakespeare says, there are sermons in books, stones in the running\nbrooks, or, rather, the other way about, and there you have it in a\nnutshell.\"\n\nIt went well, and I wasn't surprised. I couldn't quite follow some of it,\nbut anybody could see that it was real ripe stuff, and I was amazed that\neven the course of treatment he had been taking could have rendered so\nnormally tongue-tied a dumb brick as Gussie capable of it.\n\nIt just shows, what any member of Parliament will tell you, that if you\nwant real oratory, the preliminary noggin is essential. Unless pie-eyed,\nyou cannot hope to grip.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Gussie, \"I mean ladies and gentlemen and, of course,\nboys, what a beautiful world this is. A beautiful world, full of\nhappiness on every side. Let me tell you a little story. Two Irishmen,\nPat and Mike, were walking along Broadway, and one said to the other,\n'Begorrah, the race is not always to the swift,' and the other replied,\n'Faith and begob, education is a drawing out, not a putting in.'\"\n\nI must say it seemed to me the rottenest story I had ever heard, and I\nwas surprised that Jeeves should have considered it worth while shoving\ninto a speech. However, when I taxed him with this later, he said that\nGussie had altered the plot a good deal, and I dare say that accounts for\nit.\n\nAt any rate, that was the _conte_ as Gussie told it, and when I say that\nit got a very fair laugh, you will understand what a popular favourite he\nhad become with the multitude. There might be a bearded bloke or so on\nthe platform and a small section in the second row who were wishing the\nspeaker would conclude his remarks and resume his seat, but the audience\nas a whole was for him solidly.\n\nThere was applause, and a voice cried: \"Hear, hear!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Gussie, \"it is a beautiful world. The sky is blue, the birds\nare singing, there is optimism everywhere. And why not, boys and ladies\nand gentlemen? I'm happy, you're happy, we're all happy, even the meanest\nIrishman that walks along Broadway. Though, as I say, there were two of\nthem--Pat and Mike, one drawing out, the other putting in. I should like\nyou boys, taking the time from me, to give three cheers for this\nbeautiful world. All together now.\"\n\nPresently the dust settled down and the plaster stopped falling from the\nceiling, and he went on.\n\n\"People who say it isn't a beautiful world don't know what they are\ntalking about. Driving here in the car today to award the kind prizes, I\nwas reluctantly compelled to tick off my host on this very point. Old Tom\nTravers. You will see him sitting there in the second row next to the\nlarge lady in beige.\"\n\nHe pointed helpfully, and the hundred or so Market Snods-buryians who\ncraned their necks in the direction indicated were able to observe Uncle\nTom blushing prettily.\n\n\"I ticked him off properly, the poor fish. He expressed the opinion that\nthe world was in a deplorable state. I said, 'Don't talk rot, old Tom\nTravers.' 'I am not accustomed to talk rot,' he said. 'Then, for a\nbeginner,' I said, 'you do it dashed well.' And I think you will admit,\nboys and ladies and gentlemen, that that was telling him.\"\n\nThe audience seemed to agree with him. The point went big. The voice that\nhad said, \"Hear, hear\" said \"Hear, hear\" again, and my corn chandler\nhammered the floor vigorously with a large-size walking stick.\n\n\"Well, boys,\" resumed Gussie, having shot his cuffs and smirked horribly,\n\"this is the end of the summer term, and many of you, no doubt, are\nleaving the school. And I don't blame you, because there's a frost in\nhere you could cut with a knife. You are going out into the great world.\nSoon many of you will be walking along Broadway. And what I want to\nimpress upon you is that, however much you may suffer from adenoids, you\nmust all use every effort to prevent yourselves becoming pessimists and\ntalking rot like old Tom Travers. There in the second row. The fellow\nwith a face rather like a walnut.\"\n\nHe paused to allow those wishing to do so to refresh themselves with\nanother look at Uncle Tom, and I found myself musing in some little\nperplexity. Long association with the members of the Drones has put me\npretty well in touch with the various ways in which an overdose of the\nblushful Hippocrene can take the individual, but I had never seen anyone\nreact quite as Gussie was doing.\n\nThere was a snap about his work which I had never witnessed before, even\nin Barmy Fotheringay-Phipps on New Year's Eve.\n\nJeeves, when I discussed the matter with him later, said it was something\nto do with inhibitions, if I caught the word correctly, and the\nsuppression of, I think he said, the ego. What he meant, I gathered, was\nthat, owing to the fact that Gussie had just completed a five years'\nstretch of blameless seclusion among the newts, all the goofiness which\nought to have been spread out thin over those five years and had been\nbottled up during that period came to the surface on this occasion in a\nlump--or, if you prefer to put it that way, like a tidal wave.\n\nThere may be something in this. Jeeves generally knows.\n\nAnyway, be that as it may, I was dashed glad I had had the shrewdness to\nkeep out of that second row. It might be unworthy of the prestige of a\nWooster to squash in among the proletariat in the standing-room-only\nsection, but at least, I felt, I was out of the danger zone. So\nthoroughly had Gussie got it up his nose by now that it seemed to me that\nhad he sighted me he might have become personal about even an old school\nfriend.\n\n\"If there's one thing in the world I can't stand,\" proceeded Gussie,\n\"it's a pessimist. Be optimists, boys. You all know the difference\nbetween an optimist and a pessimist. An optimist is a man who--well, take\nthe case of two Irishmen walking along Broadway. One is an optimist and\none is a pessimist, just as one's name is Pat and the other's Mike....\nWhy, hullo, Bertie; I didn't know you were here.\"\n\nToo late, I endeavoured to go to earth behind the chandler, only to\ndiscover that there was no chandler there. Some appointment, suddenly\nremembered--possibly a promise to his wife that he would be home to\ntea--had caused him to ooze away while my attention was elsewhere,\nleaving me right out in the open.\n\nBetween me and Gussie, who was now pointing in an offensive manner, there\nwas nothing but a sea of interested faces looking up at me.\n\n\"Now, there,\" boomed Gussie, continuing to point, \"is an instance of what\nI mean. Boys and ladies and gentlemen, take a good look at that object\nstanding up there at the back--morning coat, trousers as worn, quiet grey\ntie, and carnation in buttonhole--you can't miss him. Bertie Wooster,\nthat is, and as foul a pessimist as ever bit a tiger. I tell you I\ndespise that man. And why do I despise him? Because, boys and ladies and\ngentlemen, he is a pessimist. His attitude is defeatist. When I told him\nI was going to address you this afternoon, he tried to dissuade me. And\ndo you know why he tried to dissuade me? Because he said my trousers\nwould split up the back.\"\n\nThe cheers that greeted this were the loudest yet. Anything about\nsplitting trousers went straight to the simple hearts of the young\nscholars of Market Snodsbury Grammar School. Two in the row in front of\nme turned purple, and a small lad with freckles seated beside them asked\nme for my autograph.\n\n\"Let me tell you a story about Bertie Wooster.\"\n\nA Wooster can stand a good deal, but he cannot stand having his name\nbandied in a public place. Picking my feet up softly, I was in the very\nprocess of executing a quiet sneak for the door, when I perceived that\nthe bearded bloke had at last decided to apply the closure.\n\nWhy he hadn't done so before is beyond me. Spell-bound, I take it. And,\nof course, when a chap is going like a breeze with the public, as Gussie\nhad been, it's not so dashed easy to chip in. However, the prospect of\nhearing another of Gussie's anecdotes seemed to have done the trick.\nRising rather as I had risen from my bench at the beginning of that\npainful scene with Tuppy in the twilight, he made a leap for the table,\nsnatched up a book and came bearing down on the speaker.\n\nHe touched Gussie on the arm, and Gussie, turning sharply and seeing a\nlarge bloke with a beard apparently about to bean him with a book, sprang\nback in an attitude of self-defence.\n\n\"Perhaps, as time is getting on, Mr. Fink-Nottle, we had better----\"\n\n\"Oh, ah,\" said Gussie, getting the trend. He relaxed. \"The prizes, eh? Of\ncourse, yes. Right-ho. Yes, might as well be shoving along with it.\nWhat's this one?\"\n\n\"Spelling and dictation--P.K. Purvis,\" announced the bearded bloke.\n\n\"Spelling and dictation--P.K. Purvis,\" echoed Gussie, as if he were\ncalling coals. \"Forward, P.K. Purvis.\"\n\nNow that the whistle had been blown on his speech, it seemed to me that\nthere was no longer any need for the strategic retreat which I had been\nplanning. I had no wish to tear myself away unless I had to. I mean, I\nhad told Jeeves that this binge would be fraught with interest, and it\nwas fraught with interest. There was a fascination about Gussie's methods\nwhich gripped and made one reluctant to pass the thing up provided\npersonal innuendoes were steered clear of. I decided, accordingly, to\nremain, and presently there was a musical squeaking and P.K. Purvis\nclimbed the platform.\n\nThe spelling-and-dictation champ was about three foot six in his\nsqueaking shoes, with a pink face and sandy hair. Gussie patted his hair.\nHe seemed to have taken an immediate fancy to the lad.\n\n\"You P.K. Purvis?\"\n\n\"Sir, yes, sir.\"\n\n\"It's a beautiful world, P.K. Purvis.\"\n\n\"Sir, yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Ah, you've noticed it, have you? Good. You married, by any chance?\"\n\n\"Sir, no, sir.\"\n\n\"Get married, P.K. Purvis,\" said Gussie earnestly. \"It's the only life\n... Well, here's your book. Looks rather bilge to me from a glance at\nthe title page, but, such as it is, here you are.\"\n\nP.K. Purvis squeaked off amidst sporadic applause, but one could not fail\nto note that the sporadic was followed by a rather strained silence. It\nwas evident that Gussie was striking something of a new note in Market\nSnodsbury scholastic circles. Looks were exchanged between parent and\nparent. The bearded bloke had the air of one who has drained the bitter\ncup. As for Aunt Dahlia, her demeanour now told only too clearly that her\nlast doubts had been resolved and her verdict was in. I saw her whisper\nto the Bassett, who sat on her right, and the Bassett nodded sadly and\nlooked like a fairy about to shed a tear and add another star to the\nMilky Way.\n\nGussie, after the departure of P.K. Purvis, had fallen into a sort of\ndaydream and was standing with his mouth open and his hands in his\npockets. Becoming abruptly aware that a fat kid in knickerbockers was at\nhis elbow, he started violently.\n\n\"Hullo!\" he said, visibly shaken. \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"This,\" said the bearded bloke, \"is R.V. Smethurst.\"\n\n\"What's he doing here?\" asked Gussie suspiciously.\n\n\"You are presenting him with the drawing prize, Mr. Fink-Nottle.\"\n\nThis apparently struck Gussie as a reasonable explanation. His face\ncleared.\n\n\"That's right, too,\" he said.... \"Well, here it is, cocky. You off?\" he\nsaid, as the kid prepared to withdraw.\n\n\"Sir, yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Wait, R.V. Smethurst. Not so fast. Before you go, there is a question I\nwish to ask you.\"\n\nBut the beard bloke's aim now seemed to be to rush the ceremonies a bit.\nHe hustled R.V. Smethurst off stage rather like a chucker-out in a pub\nregretfully ejecting an old and respected customer, and starting paging\nG.G. Simmons. A moment later the latter was up and coming, and conceive\nmy emotion when it was announced that the subject on which he had clicked\nwas Scripture knowledge. One of us, I mean to say.\n\nG.G. Simmons was an unpleasant, perky-looking stripling, mostly front\nteeth and spectacles, but I gave him a big hand. We Scripture-knowledge\nsharks stick together.\n\nGussie, I was sorry to see, didn't like him. There was in his manner, as\nhe regarded G.G. Simmons, none of the chumminess which had marked it\nduring his interview with P.K. Purvis or, in a somewhat lesser degree,\nwith R.V. Smethurst. He was cold and distant.\n\n\"Well, G.G. Simmons.\"\n\n\"Sir, yes, sir.\"\n\n\"What do you mean--sir, yes, sir? Dashed silly thing to say. So you've\nwon the Scripture-knowledge prize, have you?\"\n\n\"Sir, yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Gussie, \"you look just the sort of little tick who would. And\nyet,\" he said, pausing and eyeing the child keenly, \"how are we to know\nthat this has all been open and above board? Let me test you, G.G.\nSimmons. What was What's-His-Name--the chap who begat Thingummy? Can you\nanswer me that, Simmons?\"\n\n\"Sir, no, sir.\"\n\nGussie turned to the bearded bloke.\n\n\"Fishy,\" he said. \"Very fishy. This boy appears to be totally lacking in\nScripture knowledge.\"\n\nThe bearded bloke passed a hand across his forehead.\n\n\"I can assure you, Mr. Fink-Nottle, that every care was taken to ensure a\ncorrect marking and that Simmons outdistanced his competitors by a wide\nmargin.\"\n\n\"Well, if you say so,\" said Gussie doubtfully. \"All right, G.G. Simmons,\ntake your prize.\"\n\n\"Sir, thank you, sir.\"\n\n\"But let me tell you that there's nothing to stick on side about in\nwinning a prize for Scripture knowledge. Bertie Wooster----\"\n\nI don't know when I've had a nastier shock. I had been going on the\nassumption that, now that they had stopped him making his speech,\nGussie's fangs had been drawn, as you might say. To duck my head down and\nresume my edging toward the door was with me the work of a moment.\n\n\"Bertie Wooster won the Scripture-knowledge prize at a kids' school we\nwere at together, and you know what he's like. But, of course, Bertie\nfrankly cheated. He succeeded in scrounging that Scripture-knowledge\ntrophy over the heads of better men by means of some of the rawest and\nmost brazen swindling methods ever witnessed even at a school where such\nthings were common. If that man's pockets, as he entered the\nexamination-room, were not stuffed to bursting-point with lists of the\nkings of Judah----\"\n\nI heard no more. A moment later I was out in God's air, fumbling with a\nfevered foot at the self-starter of the old car.\n\nThe engine raced. The clutch slid into position. I tooted and drove off.\n\nMy ganglions were still vibrating as I ran the car into the stables of\nBrinkley Court, and it was a much shaken Bertram who tottered up to his\nroom to change into something loose. Having donned flannels, I lay down\non the bed for a bit, and I suppose I must have dozed off, for the next\nthing I remember is finding Jeeves at my side.\n\nI sat up. \"My tea, Jeeves?\"\n\n\"No, sir. It is nearly dinner-time.\"\n\nThe mists cleared away.\n\n\"I must have been asleep.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Nature taking its toll of the exhausted frame.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And enough to make it.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And now it's nearly dinner-time, you say? All right. I am in no mood for\ndinner, but I suppose you had better lay out the clothes.\"\n\n\"It will not be necessary, sir. The company will not be dressing tonight.\nA cold collation has been set out in the dining-room.\"\n\n\"Why's that?\"\n\n\"It was Mrs. Travers's wish that this should be done in order to minimize\nthe work for the staff, who are attending a dance at Sir Percival\nStretchley-Budd's residence tonight.\"\n\n\"Of course, yes. I remember. My Cousin Angela told me. Tonight's the\nnight, what? You going, Jeeves?\"\n\n\"No, sir. I am not very fond of this form of entertainment in the rural\ndistricts, sir.\"\n\n\"I know what you mean. These country binges are all the same. A piano,\none fiddle, and a floor like sandpaper. Is Anatole going? Angela hinted\nnot.\"\n\n\"Miss Angela was correct, sir. Monsieur Anatole is in bed.\"\n\n\"Temperamental blighters, these Frenchmen.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\"Well, Jeeves,\" I said, \"it was certainly one of those afternoons, what?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I cannot recall one more packed with incident. And I left before the\nfinish.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I observed your departure.\"\n\n\"You couldn't blame me for withdrawing.\"\n\n\"No, sir. Mr. Fink-Nottle had undoubtedly become embarrassingly\npersonal.\"\n\n\"Was there much more of it after I went?\"\n\n\"No, sir. The proceedings terminated very shortly. Mr. Fink-Nottle's\nremarks with reference to Master G.G. Simmons brought about an early\nclosure.\"\n\n\"But he had finished his remarks about G.G. Simmons.\"\n\n\"Only temporarily, sir. He resumed them immediately after your departure.\nIf you recollect, sir, he had already proclaimed himself suspicious of\nMaster Simmons's bona fides, and he now proceeded to deliver a violent\nverbal attack upon the young gentleman, asserting that it was impossible\nfor him to have won the Scripture-knowledge prize without systematic\ncheating on an impressive scale. He went so far as to suggest that Master\nSimmons was well known to the police.\"\n\n\"Golly, Jeeves!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. The words did create a considerable sensation. The reaction of\nthose present to this accusation I should describe as mixed. The young\nstudents appeared pleased and applauded vigorously, but Master Simmons's\nmother rose from her seat and addressed Mr. Fink-Nottle in terms of\nstrong protest.\"\n\n\"Did Gussie seem taken aback? Did he recede from his position?\"\n\n\"No, sir. He said that he could see it all now, and hinted at a guilty\nliaison between Master Simmons's mother and the head master, accusing the\nlatter of having cooked the marks, as his expression was, in order to\ngain favour with the former.\"\n\n\"You don't mean that?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Egad, Jeeves! And then----\"\n\n\"They sang the national anthem, sir.\"\n\n\"Surely not?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"At a moment like that?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, you were there and you know, of course, but I should have thought\nthe last thing Gussie and this woman would have done in the circs. would\nhave been to start singing duets.\"\n\n\"You misunderstand me, sir. It was the entire company who sang. The head\nmaster turned to the organist and said something to him in a low tone.\nUpon which the latter began to play the national anthem, and the\nproceedings terminated.\"\n\n\"I see. About time, too.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Mrs. Simmons's attitude had become unquestionably menacing.\"\n\nI pondered. What I had heard was, of course, of a nature to excite pity\nand terror, not to mention alarm and despondency, and it would be\npaltering with the truth to say that I was pleased about it. On the other\nhand, it was all over now, and it seemed to me that the thing to do was\nnot to mourn over the past but to fix the mind on the bright future. I\nmean to say, Gussie might have lowered the existing Worcestershire record\nfor goofiness and definitely forfeited all chance of becoming Market\nSnodsbury's favourite son, but you couldn't get away from the fact that\nhe had proposed to Madeline Bassett, and you had to admit that she had\naccepted him.\n\nI put this to Jeeves.\n\n\"A frightful exhibition,\" I said, \"and one which will very possibly ring\ndown history's pages. But we must not forget, Jeeves, that Gussie, though\nnow doubtless looked upon in the neighbourhood as the world's worst\nfreak, is all right otherwise.\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\nI did not get quite this.\n\n\"When you say 'No, sir,' do you mean 'Yes, sir'?\"\n\n\"No, sir. I mean 'No, sir.'\"\n\n\"He is not all right otherwise?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"But he's betrothed.\"\n\n\"No longer, sir. Miss Bassett has severed the engagement.\"\n\n\"You don't mean that?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nI wonder if you have noticed a rather peculiar thing about this\nchronicle. I allude to the fact that at one time or another practically\neverybody playing a part in it has had occasion to bury his or her face\nin his or her hands. I have participated in some pretty glutinous affairs\nin my time, but I think that never before or since have I been mixed up\nwith such a solid body of brow clutchers.\n\nUncle Tom did it, if you remember. So did Gussie. So did Tuppy. So,\nprobably, though I have no data, did Anatole, and I wouldn't put it past\nthe Bassett. And Aunt Dahlia, I have no doubt, would have done it, too,\nbut for the risk of disarranging the carefully fixed coiffure.\n\nWell, what I am trying to say is that at this juncture I did it myself.\nUp went the hands and down went the head, and in another jiffy I was\nclutching as energetically as the best of them.\n\nAnd it was while I was still massaging the coconut and wondering what the\nnext move was that something barged up against the door like the delivery\nof a ton of coals.\n\n\"I think this may very possibly be Mr. Fink-Nottle himself, sir,\" said\nJeeves.\n\nHis intuition, however, had led him astray. It was not Gussie but Tuppy.\nHe came in and stood breathing asthmatically. It was plain that he was\ndeeply stirred.\n\n\n\n-18-\n\n\nI eyed him narrowly. I didn't like his looks. Mark you, I don't say I\never had, much, because Nature, when planning this sterling fellow,\nshoved in a lot more lower jaw than was absolutely necessary and made the\neyes a bit too keen and piercing for one who was neither an Empire\nbuilder nor a traffic policeman. But on the present occasion, in addition\nto offending the aesthetic sense, this Glossop seemed to me to be wearing\na distinct air of menace, and I found myself wishing that Jeeves wasn't\nalways so dashed tactful. I mean, it's all very well to remove yourself\nlike an eel sliding into mud when the employer has a visitor, but there\nare moments--and it looked to me as if this was going to be one of\nthem--when the truer tact is to stick round and stand ready to lend a\nhand in the free-for-all.\n\nFor Jeeves was no longer with us. I hadn't seen him go, and I hadn't\nheard him go, but he had gone. As far as the eye could reach, one noted\nnobody but Tuppy. And in Tuppy's demeanour, as I say, there was a certain\nsomething that tended to disquiet. He looked to me very much like a man\nwho had come to reopen that matter of my tickling Angela's ankles.\n\nHowever, his opening remark told me that I had been alarming myself\nunduly. It was of a pacific nature, and came as a great relief.\n\n\"Bertie,\" he said, \"I owe you an apology. I have come to make it.\"\n\nMy relief on hearing these words, containing as they did no reference of\nany sort to tickled ankles, was, as I say, great. But I don't think it\nwas any greater than my surprise. Months had passed since that painful\nepisode at the Drones, and until now he hadn't given a sign of remorse\nand contrition. Indeed, word had reached me through private sources that\nhe frequently told the story at dinners and other gatherings and, when\ndoing so, laughed his silly head off.\n\nI found it hard to understand, accordingly, what could have caused him to\nabase himself at this later date. Presumably he had been given the elbow\nby his better self, but why?\n\nStill, there it was.\n\n\"My dear chap,\" I said, gentlemanly to the gills, \"don't mention it.\"\n\n\"What's the sense of saying, 'Don't mention it'? I have mentioned it.\"\n\n\"I mean, don't mention it any more. Don't give the matter another\nthought. We all of us forget ourselves sometimes and do things which, in\nour calmer moments, we regret. No doubt you were a bit tight at the\ntime.\"\n\n\"What the devil do you think you're talking about?\"\n\nI didn't like his tone. Brusque.\n\n\"Correct me if I am wrong,\" I said, with a certain stiffness, \"but I\nassumed that you were apologizing for your foul conduct in looping back\nthe last ring that night in the Drones, causing me to plunge into the\nswimming b. in the full soup and fish.\"\n\n\"Ass! Not that, at all.\"\n\n\"Then what?\"\n\n\"This Bassett business.\"\n\n\"What Bassett business?\"\n\n\"Bertie,\" said Tuppy, \"when you told me last night that you were in love\nwith Madeline Bassett, I gave you the impression that I believed you, but\nI didn't. The thing seemed too incredible. However, since then I have\nmade inquiries, and the facts appear to square with your statement. I\nhave now come to apologize for doubting you.\"\n\n\"Made inquiries?\"\n\n\"I asked her if you had proposed to her, and she said, yes, you had.\"\n\n\"Tuppy! You didn't?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Have you no delicacy, no proper feeling?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Oh? Well, right-ho, of course, but I think you ought to have.\"\n\n\"Delicacy be dashed. I wanted to be certain that it was not you who stole\nAngela from me. I now know it wasn't.\"\n\nSo long as he knew that, I didn't so much mind him having no delicacy.\n\n\"Ah,\" I said. \"Well, that's fine. Hold that thought.\"\n\n\"I have found out who it was.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nHe stood brooding for a moment. His eyes were smouldering with a dull\nfire. His jaw stuck out like the back of Jeeves's head.\n\n\"Bertie,\" he said, \"do you remember what I swore I would do to the chap\nwho stole Angela from me?\"\n\n\"As nearly as I recall, you planned to pull him inside out----\"\n\n\"--and make him swallow himself. Correct. The programme still holds\ngood.\"\n\n\"But, Tuppy, I keep assuring you, as a competent eyewitness, that nobody\nsnitched Angela from you during that Cannes trip.\"\n\n\"No. But they did after she got back.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Don't keep saying, 'What?' You heard.\"\n\n\"But she hasn't seen anybody since she got back.\"\n\n\"Oh, no? How about that newt bloke?\"\n\n\"Gussie?\"\n\n\"Precisely. The serpent Fink-Nottle.\"\n\nThis seemed to me absolute gibbering.\n\n\"But Gussie loves the Bassett.\"\n\n\"You can't all love this blighted Bassett. What astonishes me is that\nanyone can do it. He loves Angela, I tell you. And she loves him.\"\n\n\"But Angela handed you your hat before Gussie ever got here.\"\n\n\"No, she didn't. Couple of hours after.\"\n\n\"He couldn't have fallen in love with her in a couple of hours.\"\n\n\"Why not? I fell in love with her in a couple of minutes. I worshipped\nher immediately we met, the popeyed little excrescence.\"\n\n\"But, dash it----\"\n\n\"Don't argue, Bertie. The facts are all docketed. She loves this\nnewt-nuzzling blister.\"\n\n\"Quite absurd, laddie--quite absurd.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" He ground a heel into the carpet--a thing I've often read about,\nbut had never seen done before. \"Then perhaps you will explain how it is\nthat she happens to come to be engaged to him?\"\n\nYou could have knocked me down with a f.\n\n\"Engaged to him?\"\n\n\"She told me herself.\"\n\n\"She was kidding you.\"\n\n\"She was not kidding me. Shortly after the conclusion of this afternoon's\nbinge at Market Snodsbury Grammar School he asked her to marry him, and\nshe appears to have right-hoed without a murmur.\"\n\n\"There must be some mistake.\"\n\n\"There was. The snake Fink-Nottle made it, and by now I bet he realizes\nit. I've been chasing him since 5.30.\"\n\n\"Chasing him?\"\n\n\"All over the place. I want to pull his head off.\"\n\n\"I see. Quite.\"\n\n\"You haven't seen him, by any chance?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, if you do, say goodbye to him quickly and put in your order for\nlilies.... Oh, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\nI hadn't heard the door open, but the man was on the spot once more. My\nprivate belief, as I think I have mentioned before, is that Jeeves\ndoesn't have to open doors. He's like one of those birds in India who\nbung their astral bodies about--the chaps, I mean, who having gone into\nthin air in Bombay, reassemble the parts and appear two minutes later in\nCalcutta. Only some such theory will account for the fact that he's not\nthere one moment and is there the next. He just seems to float from Spot\nA to Spot B like some form of gas.\n\n\"Have you seen Mr. Fink-Nottle, Jeeves?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"I'm going to murder him.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\nTuppy withdrew, banging the door behind him, and I put Jeeves abreast.\n\n\"Jeeves,\" I said, \"do you know what? Mr. Fink-Nottle is engaged to my\nCousin Angela.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir?\"\n\n\"Well, how about it? Do you grasp the psychology? Does it make sense?\nOnly a few hours ago he was engaged to Miss Bassett.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen who have been discarded by one young lady are often apt to\nattach themselves without delay to another, sir. It is what is known as a\ngesture.\"\n\nI began to grasp.\n\n\"I see what you mean. Defiant stuff.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"A sort of 'Oh, right-ho, please yourself, but if you don't want me,\nthere are plenty who do.'\"\n\n\"Precisely, sir. My Cousin George----\"\n\n\"Never mind about your Cousin George, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\n\"Keep him for the long winter evenings, what?\"\n\n\"Just as you wish, sir.\"\n\n\"And, anyway, I bet your Cousin George wasn't a shrinking,\nnon-goose-bo-ing jellyfish like Gussie. That is what astounds me,\nJeeves--that it should be Gussie who has been putting in all this heavy\ngesture-making stuff.\"\n\n\"You must remember, sir, that Mr. Fink-Nottle is in a somewhat inflamed\ncerebral condition.\"\n\n\"That's true. A bit above par at the moment, as it were?\"\n\n\"Exactly, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll tell you one thing--he'll be in a jolly sight more inflamed\ncerebral condition if Tuppy gets hold of him.... What's the time?\"\n\n\"Just on eight o'clock, sir.\"\n\n\"Then Tuppy has been chasing him for two hours and a half. We must save\nthe unfortunate blighter, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"A human life is a human life, what?\"\n\n\"Exceedingly true, sir.\"\n\n\"The first thing, then, is to find him. After that we can discuss plans\nand schemes. Go forth, Jeeves, and scour the neighbourhood.\"\n\n\"It will not be necessary, sir. If you will glance behind you, you will\nsee Mr. Fink-Nottle coming out from beneath your bed.\"\n\nAnd, by Jove, he was absolutely right.\n\nThere was Gussie, emerging as stated. He was covered with fluff and\nlooked like a tortoise popping forth for a bit of a breather.\n\n\"Gussie!\" I said.\n\n\"Jeeves,\" said Gussie.\n\n\"Sir?\" said Jeeves.\n\n\"Is that door locked, Jeeves?\"\n\n\"No, sir, but I will attend to the matter immediately.\"\n\nGussie sat down on the bed, and I thought for a moment that he was going\nto be in the mode by burying his face in his hands. However, he merely\nbrushed a dead spider from his brow.\n\n\"Have you locked the door, Jeeves?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Because you can never tell that that ghastly Glossop may not take it\ninto his head to come----\"\n\nThe word \"back\" froze on his lips. He hadn't got any further than\na _b_-ish sound, when the handle of the door began to twist and rattle.\nHe sprang from the bed, and for an instant stood looking exactly like a\npicture my Aunt Agatha has in her dining-room--The Stag at Bay--Landseer.\nThen he made a dive for the cupboard and was inside it before one really\ngot on to it that he had started leaping. I have seen fellows late for\nthe 9.15 move less nippily.\n\nI shot a glance at Jeeves. He allowed his right eyebrow to flicker\nslightly, which is as near as he ever gets to a display of the emotions.\n\n\"Hullo?\" I yipped.\n\n\"Let me in, blast you!\" responded Tuppy's voice from without. \"Who locked\nthis door?\"\n\nI consulted Jeeves once more in the language of the eyebrow. He raised\none of his. I raised one of mine. He raised his other. I raised my other.\nThen we both raised both. Finally, there seeming no other policy to\npursue, I flung wide the gates and Tuppy came shooting in.\n\n\"Now what?\" I said, as nonchalantly as I could manage.\n\n\"Why was the door locked?\" demanded Tuppy.\n\nI was in pretty good eyebrow-raising form by now, so I gave him a touch\nof it.\n\n\"Is one to have no privacy, Glossop?\" I said coldly. \"I instructed Jeeves\nto lock the door because I was about to disrobe.\"\n\n\"A likely story!\" said Tuppy, and I'm not sure he didn't add \"Forsooth!\"\n\"You needn't try to make me believe that you're afraid people are going\nto run excursion trains to see you in your underwear. You locked that\ndoor because you've got the snake Fink-Nottle concealed in here. I\nsuspected it the moment I'd left, and I decided to come back and\ninvestigate. I'm going to search this room from end to end. I believe\nhe's in that cupboard.... What's in this cupboard?\"\n\n\"Just clothes,\" I said, having another stab at the nonchalant, though\nextremely dubious as to whether it would come off. \"The usual wardrobe of\nthe English gentleman paying a country-house visit.\"\n\n\"You're lying!\"\n\nWell, I wouldn't have been if he had only waited a minute before\nspeaking, because the words were hardly out of his mouth before Gussie\nwas out of the cupboard. I have commented on the speed with which he had\ngone in. It was as nothing to the speed with which he emerged. There was\na sort of whir and blur, and he was no longer with us.\n\nI think Tuppy was surprised. In fact, I'm sure he was. Despite the\nconfidence with which he had stated his view that the cupboard contained\nFink-Nottles, it plainly disconcerted him to have the chap fizzing out at\nhim like this. He gargled sharply, and jumped back about five feet. The\nnext moment, however, he had recovered his poise and was galloping down\nthe corridor in pursuit. It only needed Aunt Dahlia after them, shouting\n\"Yoicks!\" or whatever is customary on these occasions, to complete the\nresemblance to a brisk run with the Quorn.\n\nI sank into a handy chair. I am not a man whom it is easy to discourage,\nbut it seemed to me that things had at last begun to get too complex for\nBertram.\n\n\"Jeeves,\" I said, \"all this is a bit thick.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"The head rather swims.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I think you had better leave me, Jeeves. I shall need to devote the very\nclosest thought to the situation which has arisen.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\nThe door closed. I lit a cigarette and began to ponder.\n\n\n\n-19-\n\n\nMost chaps in my position, I imagine, would have pondered all the rest of\nthe evening without getting a bite, but we Woosters have an uncanny knack\nof going straight to the heart of things, and I don't suppose it was much\nmore than ten minutes after I had started pondering before I saw what had\nto be done.\n\nWhat was needed to straighten matters out, I perceived, was a heart-to-\nheart talk with Angela. She had caused all the trouble by her mutton-\nheaded behaviour in saying \"Yes\" instead of \"No\" when Gussie, in the\ngrip of mixed drinks and cerebral excitement, had suggested teaming up.\nShe must obviously be properly ticked off and made to return him to store.\nA quarter of an hour later, I had tracked her down to the summer-house in\nwhich she was taking a cooler and was seating myself by her side.\n\n\"Angela,\" I said, and if my voice was stern, well, whose wouldn't have\nbeen, \"this is all perfect drivel.\"\n\nShe seemed to come out of a reverie. She looked at me inquiringly.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Bertie, I didn't hear. What were you talking drivel about?\"\n\n\"I was not talking drivel.\"\n\n\"Oh, sorry, I thought you said you were.\"\n\n\"Is it likely that I would come out here in order to talk drivel?\"\n\n\"Very likely.\"\n\nI thought it best to haul off and approach the matter from another angle.\n\n\"I've just been seeing Tuppy.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"And Gussie Fink-Nottle.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes?\"\n\n\"It appears that you have gone and got engaged to the latter.\"\n\n\"Quite right.\"\n\n\"Well, that's what I meant when I said it was all perfect drivel. You\ncan't possibly love a chap like Gussie.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"You simply can't.\"\n\nWell, I mean to say, of course she couldn't. Nobody could love a freak\nlike Gussie except a similar freak like the Bassett. The shot wasn't on\nthe board. A splendid chap, of course, in many ways--courteous, amiable,\nand just the fellow to tell you what to do till the doctor came, if you\nhad a sick newt on your hands--but quite obviously not of Mendelssohn's\nMarch timber. I have no doubt that you could have flung bricks by the\nhour in England's most densely populated districts without endangering\nthe safety of a single girl capable of becoming Mrs. Augustus Fink-Nottle\nwithout an anaesthetic.\n\nI put this to her, and she was forced to admit the justice of it.\n\n\"All right, then. Perhaps I don't.\"\n\n\"Then what,\" I said keenly, \"did you want to go and get engaged to him\nfor, you unreasonable young fathead?\"\n\n\"I thought it would be fun.\"\n\n\"Fun!\"\n\n\"And so it has been. I've had a lot of fun out of it. You should have\nseen Tuppy's face when I told him.\"\n\nA sudden bright light shone upon me.\n\n\"Ha! A gesture!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You got engaged to Gussie just to score off Tuppy?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Well, then, that was what I was saying. It was a gesture.\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose you could call it that.\"\n\n\"And I'll tell you something else I'll call it--viz. a dashed low trick.\nI'm surprised at you, young Angela.\"\n\n\"I don't see why.\"\n\nI curled the lip about half an inch. \"Being a female, you wouldn't. You\ngentler sexes are like that. You pull off the rawest stuff without a\npang. You pride yourselves on it. Look at Jael, the wife of Heber.\"\n\n\"Where did you ever hear of Jael, the wife of Heber?\"\n\n\"Possibly you are not aware that I once won a Scripture-knowledge prize\nat school?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. I remember Augustus mentioning it in his speech.\"\n\n\"Quite,\" I said, a little hurriedly. I had no wish to be reminded of\nAugustus's speech. \"Well, as I say, look at Jael, the wife of Heber. Dug\nspikes into the guest's coconut while he was asleep, and then went\nswanking about the place like a Girl Guide. No wonder they say, 'Oh,\nwoman, woman!'\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"The chaps who do. Coo, what a sex! But you aren't proposing to keep this\nup, of course?\"\n\n\"Keep what up?\"\n\n\"This rot of being engaged to Gussie.\"\n\n\"I certainly am.\"\n\n\"Just to make Tuppy look silly.\"\n\n\"Do you think he looks silly?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"So he ought to.\"\n\nI began to get the idea that I wasn't making real headway. I remember\nwhen I won that Scripture-knowledge prize, having to go into the facts\nabout Balaam's ass. I can't quite recall what they were, but I still\nretain a sort of general impression of something digging its feet in and\nputting its ears back and refusing to co-operate; and it seemed to me\nthat this was what Angela was doing now. She and Balaam's ass were, so to\nspeak, sisters under the skin. There's a word beginning with r----\"re\"\nsomething----\"recal\" something--No, it's gone. But what I am driving at is\nthat is what this Angela was showing herself.\n\n\"Silly young geezer,\" I said.\n\nShe pinkened.\n\n\"I'm not a silly young geezer.\"\n\n\"You are a silly young geezer. And, what's more, you know it.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything of the kind.\"\n\n\"Here you are, wrecking Tuppy's life, wrecking Gussie's life, all for the\nsake of a cheap score.\"\n\n\"Well, it's no business of yours.\"\n\nI sat on this promptly:\n\n\"No business of mine when I see two lives I used to go to school with\nwrecked? Ha! Besides, you know you're potty about Tuppy.\"\n\n\"I'm not!\"\n\n\"Is that so? If I had a quid for every time I've seen you gaze at him\nwith the lovelight in your eyes----\"\n\nShe gazed at me, but without the lovelight.\n\n\"Oh, for goodness sake, go away and boil your head, Bertie!\"\n\nI drew myself up.\n\n\"That,\" I replied, with dignity, \"is just what I am going to go away and\nboil. At least, I mean, I shall now leave you. I have said my say.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"But permit me to add----\"\n\n\"I won't.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" I said coldly. \"In that case, tinkerty tonk.\"\n\nAnd I meant it to sting.\n\n\"Moody\" and \"discouraged\" were about the two adjectives you would have\nselected to describe me as I left the summer-house. It would be idle to\ndeny that I had expected better results from this little chat.\n\nI was surprised at Angela. Odd how you never realize that every girl is\nat heart a vicious specimen until something goes wrong with her love\naffair. This cousin and I had been meeting freely since the days when I\nwore sailor suits and she hadn't any front teeth, yet only now was I\nbeginning to get on to her hidden depths. A simple, jolly, kindly young\npimple she had always struck me as--the sort you could more or less rely\non not to hurt a fly. But here she was now laughing heartlessly--at\nleast, I seemed to remember hearing her laugh heartlessly--like something\ncold and callous out of a sophisticated talkie, and fairly spitting on\nher hands in her determination to bring Tuppy's grey hairs in sorrow to\nthe grave.\n\nI've said it before, and I'll say it again--girls are rummy. Old Pop\nKipling never said a truer word than when he made that crack about the f.\nof the s. being more d. than the m.\n\nIt seemed to me in the circs. that there was but one thing to do--that is\nhead for the dining-room and take a slash at the cold collation of which\nJeeves had spoken. I felt in urgent need of sustenance, for the recent\ninterview had pulled me down a bit. There is no gainsaying the fact that\nthis naked-emotion stuff reduces a chap's vitality and puts him in the\nvein for a good whack at the beef and ham.\n\nTo the dining-room, accordingly, I repaired, and had barely crossed the\nthreshold when I perceived Aunt Dahlia at the sideboard, tucking into\nsalmon mayonnaise.\n\nThe spectacle drew from me a quick \"Oh, ah,\" for I was somewhat\nembarrassed. The last time this relative and I had enjoyed a\n_t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate,_ it will be remembered, she had sketched out plans for\ndrowning me in the kitchen-garden pond, and I was not quite sure what\nmy present standing with her was.\n\nI was relieved to find her in genial mood. Nothing could have exceeded\nthe cordiality with which she waved her fork.\n\n\"Hallo, Bertie, you old ass,\" was her very matey greeting. \"I thought I\nshouldn't find you far away from the food. Try some of this salmon.\nExcellent.\"\n\n\"Anatole's?\" I queried.\n\n\"No. He's still in bed. But the kitchen maid has struck an inspired\nstreak. It suddenly seems to have come home to her that she isn't\ncatering for a covey of buzzards in the Sahara Desert, and she has put\nout something quite fit for human consumption. There is good in the girl,\nafter all, and I hope she enjoys herself at the dance.\"\n\nI ladled out a portion of salmon, and we fell into pleasant conversation,\nchatting of this servants' ball at the Stretchley-Budds and speculating\nidly, I recall, as to what Seppings, the butler, would look like, doing\nthe rumba.\n\nIt was not till I had cleaned up the first platter and was embarking on a\nsecond that the subject of Gussie came up. Considering what had passed at\nMarket Snodsbury that afternoon, it was one which I had been expecting\nher to touch on earlier. When she did touch on it, I could see that she\nhad not yet been informed of Angela's engagement.\n\n\"I say, Bertie,\" she said, meditatively chewing fruit salad. \"This\nSpink-Bottle.\"\n\n\"Nottle.\"\n\n\"Bottle,\" insisted the aunt firmly. \"After that exhibition of his this\nafternoon, Bottle, and nothing but Bottle, is how I shall always think of\nhim. However, what I was going to say was that, if you see him, I wish\nyou would tell him that he has made an old woman very, very happy. Except\nfor the time when the curate tripped over a loose shoelace and fell down\nthe pulpit steps, I don't think I have ever had a more wonderful moment\nthan when good old Bottle suddenly started ticking Tom off from the\nplatform. In fact, I thought his whole performance in the most perfect\ntaste.\"\n\nI could not but demur.\n\n\"Those references to myself----\"\n\n\"Those were what I liked next best. I thought they were fine. Is it true\nthat you cheated when you won that Scripture-knowledge prize?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. My victory was the outcome of the most strenuous and\nunremitting efforts.\"\n\n\"And how about this pessimism we hear of? Are you a pessimist, Bertie?\"\n\nI could have told her that what was occurring in this house was rapidly\nmaking me one, but I said no, I wasn't.\n\n\"That's right. Never be a pessimist. Everything is for the best in this\nbest of all possible worlds. It's a long lane that has no turning. It's\nalways darkest before the dawn. Have patience and all will come right.\nThe sun will shine, although the day's a grey one.... Try some of this\nsalad.\"\n\nI followed her advice, but even as I plied the spoon my thoughts were\nelsewhere. I was perplexed. It may have been the fact that I had recently\nbeen hobnobbing with so many bowed-down hearts that made this cheeriness\nof hers seem so bizarre, but bizarre was certainly what I found it.\n\n\"I thought you might have been a trifle peeved,\" I said.\n\n\"Peeved?\"\n\n\"By Gussie's manoeuvres on the platform this afternoon. I confess that I\nhad rather expected the tapping foot and the drawn brow.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. What was there to be peeved about? I took the whole thing as a\ngreat compliment, proud to feel that any drink from my cellars could have\nproduced such a majestic jag. It restores one's faith in post-war whisky.\nBesides, I couldn't be peeved at anything tonight. I am like a little\nchild clapping its hands and dancing in the sunshine. For though it has\nbeen some time getting a move on, Bertie, the sun has at last broken\nthrough the clouds. Ring out those joy bells. Anatole has withdrawn his\nnotice.\"\n\n\"What? Oh, very hearty congratulations.\"\n\n\"Thanks. Yes, I worked on him like a beaver after I got back this\nafternoon, and finally, vowing he would ne'er consent, he consented. He\nstays on, praises be, and the way I look at it now is that God's in His\nheaven and all's right with----\"\n\nShe broke off. The door had opened, and we were plus a butler.\n\n\"Hullo, Seppings,\" said Aunt Dahlia. \"I thought you had gone.\"\n\n\"Not yet, madam.\"\n\n\"Well, I hope you will all have a good time.\"\n\n\"Thank you, madam.\"\n\n\"Was there something you wanted to see me about?\"\n\n\"Yes, madam. It is with reference to Monsieur Anatole. Is it by your\nwish, madam, that Mr. Fink-Nottle is making faces at Monsieur Anatole\nthrough the skylight of his bedroom?\"\n\n\n\n-20-\n\n\nThere was one of those long silences. Pregnant, I believe, is what\nthey're generally called. Aunt looked at butler. Butler looked at aunt. I\nlooked at both of them. An eerie stillness seemed to envelop the room\nlike a linseed poultice. I happened to be biting on a slice of apple in my\nfruit salad at the moment, and it sounded as if Carnera had jumped off\nthe top of the Eiffel Tower on to a cucumber frame.\n\nAunt Dahlia steadied herself against the sideboard, and spoke in a low,\nhusky voice:\n\n\"Faces?\"\n\n\"Yes, madam.\"\n\n\"Through the skylight?\"\n\n\"Yes, madam.\"\n\n\"You mean he's sitting on the roof?\"\n\n\"Yes, madam. It has upset Monsieur Anatole very much.\"\n\nI suppose it was that word \"upset\" that touched Aunt Dahlia off.\nExperience had taught her what happened when Anatole got upset. I had\nalways known her as a woman who was quite active on her pins, but I had\nnever suspected her of being capable of the magnificent burst of speed\nwhich she now showed. Pausing merely to get a rich hunting-field\nexpletive off her chest, she was out of the room and making for the\nstairs before I could swallow a sliver of--I think--banana. And feeling,\nas I had felt when I got that telegram of hers about Angela and Tuppy,\nthat my place was by her side, I put down my plate and hastened after\nher, Seppings following at a loping gallop.\n\nI say that my place was by her side, but it was not so dashed easy to get\nthere, for she was setting a cracking pace. At the top of the first\nflight she must have led by a matter of half a dozen lengths, and was\nstill shaking off my challenge when she rounded into the second. At the\nnext landing, however, the gruelling going appeared to tell on her, for\nshe slackened off a trifle and showed symptoms of roaring, and by the\ntime we were in the straight we were running practically neck and neck.\nOur entry into Anatole's room was as close a finish as you could have\nwished to see.\n\nResult:\n\n1. _Aunt Dahlia._\n\n2. _Bertram._\n\n3. _Seppings._\n\n_Won by a short head. Half a staircase separated second and third._\n\nThe first thing that met the eye on entering was Anatole. This wizard of\nthe cooking-stove is a tubby little man with a moustache of the outsize\nor soup-strainer type, and you can generally take a line through it as to\nthe state of his emotions. When all is well, it turns up at the ends like\na sergeant-major's. When the soul is bruised, it droops.\n\nIt was drooping now, striking a sinister note. And if any shadow of doubt\nhad remained as to how he was feeling, the way he was carrying on would\nhave dispelled it. He was standing by the bed in pink pyjamas, waving his\nfists at the skylight. Through the glass, Gussie was staring down. His\neyes were bulging and his mouth was open, giving him so striking a\nresemblance to some rare fish in an aquarium that one's primary impulse\nwas to offer him an ant's egg.\n\nWatching this fist-waving cook and this goggling guest, I must say that\nmy sympathies were completely with the former. I considered him\nthoroughly justified in waving all the fists he wanted to.\n\nReview the facts, I mean to say. There he had been, lying in bed,\nthinking idly of whatever French cooks do think about when in bed, and he\nhad suddenly become aware of that frightful face at the window. A thing\nto jar the most phlegmatic. I know I should hate to be lying in bed and\nhave Gussie popping up like that. A chap's bedroom--you can't get away\nfrom it--is his castle, and he has every right to look askance if\ngargoyles come glaring in at him.\n\nWhile I stood musing thus, Aunt Dahlia, in her practical way, was coming\nstraight to the point:\n\n\"What's all this?\"\n\nAnatole did a sort of Swedish exercise, starting at the base of the\nspine, carrying on through the shoulder-blades and finishing up among the\nback hair.\n\nThen he told her.\n\nIn the chats I have had with this wonder man, I have always found his\nEnglish fluent, but a bit on the mixed side. If you remember, he was with\nMrs. Bingo Little for a time before coming to Brinkley, and no doubt he\npicked up a good deal from Bingo. Before that, he had been a couple of\nyears with an American family at Nice and had studied under their\nchauffeur, one of the Maloneys of Brooklyn. So, what with Bingo and what\nwith Maloney, he is, as I say, fluent but a bit mixed.\n\nHe spoke, in part, as follows:\n\n\"Hot dog! You ask me what is it? Listen. Make some attention a little.\nMe, I have hit the hay, but I do not sleep so good, and presently I wake\nand up I look, and there is one who make faces against me through the\ndashed window. Is that a pretty affair? Is that convenient? If you think\nI like it, you jolly well mistake yourself. I am so mad as a wet hen. And\nwhy not? I am somebody, isn't it? This is a bedroom, what-what, not a\nhouse for some apes? Then for what do blighters sit on my window so cool\nas a few cucumbers, making some faces?\"\n\n\"Quite,\" I said. Dashed reasonable, was my verdict.\n\nHe threw another look up at Gussie, and did Exercise 2--the one where you\nclutch the moustache, give it a tug and then start catching flies.\n\n\"Wait yet a little. I am not finish. I say I see this type on my window,\nmaking a few faces. But what then? Does he buzz off when I shout a cry,\nand leave me peaceable? Not on your life. He remain planted there, not\ngiving any damns, and sit regarding me like a cat watching a duck. He\nmake faces against me and again he make faces against me, and the more I\ncommand that he should get to hell out of here, the more he do not get to\nhell out of here. He cry something towards me, and I demand what is his\ndesire, but he do not explain. Oh, no, that arrives never. He does but\nshrug his head. What damn silliness! Is this amusing for me? You think I\nlike it? I am not content with such folly. I think the poor mutt's loony.\n_Je me fiche de ce type infect. C'est idiot de faire comme \u00c3\u00a7a\nl'oiseau.... Allez-vous-en, louffier_.... Tell the boob to go away. He is\nmad as some March hatters.\"\n\nI must say I thought he was making out a jolly good case, and evidently\nAunt Dahlia felt the same. She laid a quivering hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"I will, Monsieur Anatole, I will,\" she said, and I couldn't have\nbelieved that robust voice capable of sinking to such an absolute coo.\nMore like a turtle dove calling to its mate than anything else. \"It's\nquite all right.\"\n\nShe had said the wrong thing. He did Exercise 3.\n\n\"All right? _Nom d'un nom d'un nom_! The hell you say it's all right! Of\nwhat use to pull stuff like that? Wait one half-moment. Not yet quite so\nquick, my old sport. It is by no means all right. See yet again a little.\nIt is some very different dishes of fish. I can take a few smooths with a\nrough, it is true, but I do not find it agreeable when one play larks\nagainst me on my windows. That cannot do. A nice thing, no. I am a\nserious man. I do not wish a few larks on my windows. I enjoy larks on my\nwindows worse as any. It is very little all right. If such rannygazoo is\nto arrive, I do not remain any longer in this house no more. I buzz off\nand do not stay planted.\"\n\nSinister words, I had to admit, and I was not surprised that Aunt Dahlia,\nhearing them, should have uttered a cry like the wail of a master of\nhounds seeing a fox shot. Anatole had begun to wave his fists again at\nGussie, and she now joined him. Seppings, who was puffing respectfully in\nthe background, didn't actually wave his fists, but he gave Gussie a\npretty austere look. It was plain to the thoughtful observer that this\nFink-Nottle, in getting on to that skylight, had done a mistaken thing.\nHe couldn't have been more unpopular in the home of G.G. Simmons.\n\n\"Go away, you crazy loon!\" cried Aunt Dahlia, in that ringing voice of\nhers which had once caused nervous members of the Quorn to lose stirrups\nand take tosses from the saddle.\n\nGussie's reply was to waggle his eyebrows. I could read the message he\nwas trying to convey.\n\n\"I think he means,\" I said--reasonable old Bertram, always trying to\nthrow oil on the troubled w's----\"that if he does he will fall down the\nside of the house and break his neck.\"\n\n\"Well, why not?\" said Aunt Dahlia.\n\nI could see her point, of course, but it seemed to me that there might be\na nearer solution. This skylight happened to be the only window in the\nhouse which Uncle Tom had not festooned with his bally bars. I suppose he\nfelt that if a burglar had the nerve to climb up as far as this, he\ndeserved what was coming to him.\n\n\"If you opened the skylight, he could jump in.\"\n\nThe idea got across.\n\n\"Seppings, how does this skylight open?\"\n\n\"With a pole, madam.\"\n\n\"Then get a pole. Get two poles. Ten.\"\n\nAnd presently Gussie was mixing with the company, Like one of those chaps\nyou read about in the papers, the wretched man seemed deeply conscious of\nhis position.\n\nI must say Aunt Dahlia's bearing and demeanour did nothing to assist\ntoward a restored composure. Of the amiability which she had exhibited\nwhen discussing this unhappy chump's activities with me over the fruit\nsalad, no trace remained, and I was not surprised that speech more or\nless froze on the Fink-Nottle lips. It isn't often that Aunt Dahlia,\nnormally as genial a bird as ever encouraged a gaggle of hounds to get\ntheir noses down to it, lets her angry passions rise, but when she does,\nstrong men climb trees and pull them up after them.\n\n\"Well?\" she said.\n\nIn answer to this, all that Gussie could produce was a sort of strangled\nhiccough.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nAunt Dahlia's face grew darker. Hunting, if indulged in regularly over a\nperiod of years, is a pastime that seldom fails to lend a fairly deepish\ntinge to the patient's complexion, and her best friends could not have\ndenied that even at normal times the relative's map tended a little\ntoward the crushed strawberry. But never had I seen it take on so\npronounced a richness as now. She looked like a tomato struggling for\nself-expression.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nGussie tried hard. And for a moment it seemed as if something was going\nto come through. But in the end it turned out nothing more than a sort of\ndeath-rattle.\n\n\"Oh, take him away, Bertie, and put ice on his head,\" said Aunt Dahlia,\ngiving the thing up. And she turned to tackle what looked like the rather\nman's size job of soothing Anatole, who was now carrying on a muttered\nconversation with himself in a rapid sort of way.\n\nSeeming to feel that the situation was one to which he could not do\njustice in Bingo-cum-Maloney Anglo-American, he had fallen back on his\nnative tongue. Words like \"_marmiton de Domange,\" \"pignouf,\"\n\"hurluberlu_\" and \"_roustisseur_\" were fluttering from him like bats out\nof a barn. Lost on me, of course, because, though I sweated a bit at the\nGallic language during that Cannes visit, I'm still more or less in the\nEsker-vous-avez stage. I regretted this, for they sounded good.\n\nI assisted Gussie down the stairs. A cooler thinker than Aunt Dahlia, I\nhad already guessed the hidden springs and motives which had led him to\nthe roof. Where she had seen only a cockeyed reveller indulging himself\nin a drunken prank or whimsy, I had spotted the hunted fawn.\n\n\"Was Tuppy after you?\" I asked sympathetically.\n\nWhat I believe is called a _frisson_ shook him.\n\n\"He nearly got me on the top landing. I shinned out through a passage\nwindow and scrambled along a sort of ledge.\"\n\n\"That baffled him, what?\"\n\n\"Yes. But then I found I had stuck. The roof sloped down in all\ndirections. I couldn't go back. I had to go on, crawling along this\nledge. And then I found myself looking down the skylight. Who was that\nchap?\"\n\n\"That was Anatole, Aunt Dahlia's chef.\"\n\n\"French?\"\n\n\"To the core.\"\n\n\"That explains why I couldn't make him understand. What asses these\nFrenchmen are. They don't seem able to grasp the simplest thing. You'd\nhave thought if a chap saw a chap on a skylight, the chap would realize\nthe chap wanted to be let in. But no, he just stood there.\"\n\n\"Waving a few fists.\"\n\n\"Yes. Silly idiot. Still, here I am.\"\n\n\"Here you are, yes--for the moment.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"I was thinking that Tuppy is probably lurking somewhere.\"\n\nHe leaped like a lamb in springtime.\n\n\"What shall I do?\"\n\nI considered this.\n\n\"Sneak back to your room and barricade the door. That is the manly\npolicy.\"\n\n\"Suppose that's where he's lurking?\"\n\n\"In that case, move elsewhere.\"\n\nBut on arrival at the room, it transpired that Tuppy, if anywhere, was\ninfesting some other portion of the house. Gussie shot in, and I heard\nthe key turn. And feeling that there was no more that I could do in that\nquarter, I returned to the dining-room for further fruit salad and a\nquiet think. And I had barely filled my plate when the door opened and\nAunt Dahlia came in. She sank into a chair, looking a bit shopworn.\n\n\"Give me a drink, Bertie.\"\n\n\"What sort?\"\n\n\"Any sort, so long as it's strong.\"\n\nApproach Bertram Wooster along these lines, and you catch him at his\nbest. St. Bernard dogs doing the square thing by Alpine travellers could\nnot have bustled about more assiduously. I filled the order, and for some\nmoments nothing was to be heard but the sloshing sound of an aunt\nrestoring her tissues.\n\n\"Shove it down, Aunt Dahlia,\" I said sympathetically. \"These things take\nit out of one, don't they? You've had a toughish time, no doubt, soothing\nAnatole,\" I proceeded, helping myself to anchovy paste on toast.\n\"Everything pretty smooth now, I trust?\"\n\nShe gazed at me in a long, lingering sort of way, her brow wrinkled as if\nin thought.\n\n\"Attila,\" she said at length. \"That's the name. Attila, the Hun.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"I was trying to think who you reminded me of. Somebody who went about\nstrewing ruin and desolation and breaking up homes which, until he came\nalong, had been happy and peaceful. Attila is the man. It's amazing.\" she\nsaid, drinking me in once more. \"To look at you, one would think you were\njust an ordinary sort of amiable idiot--certifiable, perhaps, but quite\nharmless. Yet, in reality, you are worse a scourge than the Black Death.\nI tell you, Bertie, when I contemplate you I seem to come up against all\nthe underlying sorrow and horror of life with such a thud that I feel as\nif I had walked into a lamp post.\"\n\nPained and surprised, I would have spoken, but the stuff I had thought\nwas anchovy paste had turned out to be something far more gooey and\nadhesive. It seemed to wrap itself round the tongue and impede utterance\nlike a gag. And while I was still endeavouring to clear the vocal cords\nfor action, she went on:\n\n\"Do you realize what you started when you sent that Spink-Bottle man down\nhere? As regards his getting blotto and turning the prize-giving\nceremonies at Market Snodsbury Grammar School into a sort of two-reel\ncomic film, I will say nothing, for frankly I enjoyed it. But when he\ncomes leering at Anatole through skylights, just after I had with\ninfinite pains and tact induced him to withdraw his notice, and makes him\nso temperamental that he won't hear of staying on after tomorrow----\"\n\nThe paste stuff gave way. I was able to speak:\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Yes, Anatole goes tomorrow, and I suppose poor old Tom will have\nindigestion for the rest of his life. And that is not all. I have just\nseen Angela, and she tells me she is engaged to this Bottle.\"\n\n\"Temporarily, yes,\" I had to admit.\n\n\"Temporarily be blowed. She's definitely engaged to him and talks with a\nsort of hideous coolness of getting married in October. So there it is.\nIf the prophet Job were to walk into the room at this moment, I could sit\nswapping hard-luck stories with him till bedtime. Not that Job was in my\nclass.\"\n\n\"He had boils.\"\n\n\"Well, what are boils?\"\n\n\"Dashed painful, I understand.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. I'd take all the boils on the market in exchange for my\ntroubles. Can't you realize the position? I've lost the best cook to\nEngland. My husband, poor soul, will probably die of dyspepsia. And my\nonly daughter, for whom I had dreamed such a wonderful future, is engaged\nto be married to an inebriated newt fancier. And you talk about boils!\"\n\nI corrected her on a small point:\n\n\"I don't absolutely talk about boils. I merely mentioned that Job had\nthem. Yes, I agree with you, Aunt Dahlia, that things are not looking too\noojah-cum-spiff at the moment, but be of good cheer. A Wooster is seldom\nbaffled for more than the nonce.\"\n\n\"You rather expect to be coming along shortly with another of your\nschemes?\"\n\n\"At any minute.\"\n\nShe sighed resignedly.\n\n\"I thought as much. Well, it needed but this. I don't see how things\ncould possibly be worse than they are, but no doubt you will succeed in\nmaking them so. Your genius and insight will find the way. Carry on,\nBertie. Yes, carry on. I am past caring now. I shall even find a faint\ninterest in seeing into what darker and profounder abysses of hell you\ncan plunge this home. Go to it, lad.... What's that stuff you're eating?\"\n\n\"I find it a little difficult to classify. Some sort of paste on toast.\nRather like glue flavoured with beef extract.\"\n\n\"Gimme,\" said Aunt Dahlia listlessly.\n\n\"Be careful how you chew,\" I advised. \"It sticketh closer than a\nbrother.... Yes, Jeeves?\"\n\nThe man had materialized on the carpet. Absolutely noiseless, as usual.\n\n\"A note for you, sir.\"\n\n\"A note for me, Jeeves?\"\n\n\"A note for you, sir.\"\n\n\"From whom, Jeeves?\"\n\n\"From Miss Bassett, sir.\"\n\n\"From whom, Jeeves?\"\n\n\"From Miss Bassett, sir.\"\n\n\"From Miss Bassett, Jeeves?\"\n\n\"From Miss Bassett, sir.\"\n\nAt this point, Aunt Dahlia, who had taken one nibble at her\nwhatever-it-was-on-toast and laid it down, begged us--a little fretfully,\nI thought--for heaven's sake to cut out the cross-talk vaudeville stuff,\nas she had enough to bear already without having to listen to us doing\nour imitation of the Two Macs. Always willing to oblige, I dismissed\nJeeves with a nod, and he flickered for a moment and was gone. Many a\nspectre would have been less slippy.\n\n\"But what,\" I mused, toying with the envelope, \"can this female be\nwriting to me about?\"\n\n\"Why not open the damn thing and see?\"\n\n\"A very excellent idea,\" I said, and did so.\n\n\"And if you are interested in my movements,\" proceeded Aunt Dahlia,\nheading for the door, \"I propose to go to my room, do some Yogi deep\nbreathing, and try to forget.\"\n\n\"Quite,\" I said absently, skimming p. l. And then, as I turned over, a\nsharp howl broke from my lips, causing Aunt Dahlia to shy like a startled\nmustang.\n\n\"Don't do it!\" she exclaimed, quivering in every limb.\n\n\"Yes, but dash it----\"\n\n\"What a pest you are, you miserable object,\" she sighed. \"I remember\nyears ago, when you were in your cradle, being left alone with you one\nday and you nearly swallowed your rubber comforter and started turning\npurple. And I, ass that I was, took it out and saved your life. Let me\ntell you, young Bertie, it will go very hard with you if you ever swallow\na rubber comforter again when only I am by to aid.\"\n\n\"But, dash it!\" I cried. \"Do you know what's happened? Madeline Bassett\nsays she's going to marry me!\"\n\n\"I hope it keeps fine for you,\" said the relative, and passed from the\nroom looking like something out of an Edgar Allan Poe story.\n\n\n\n-21-\n\n\nI don't suppose I was looking so dashed unlike something out of an Edgar\nAllan Poe story myself, for, as you can readily imagine, the news item\nwhich I have just recorded had got in amongst me properly. If the\nBassett, in the belief that the Wooster heart had long been hers and was\nwaiting ready to be scooped in on demand, had decided to take up her\noption, I should, as a man of honour and sensibility, have no choice but\nto come across and kick in. The matter was obviously not one that could\nbe straightened out with a curt _nolle prosequi_. All the evidence,\ntherefore, seemed to point to the fact that the doom had come upon me\nand, what was more, had come to stay.\n\nAnd yet, though it would be idle to pretend that my grip on the situation\nwas quite the grip I would have liked it to be, I did not despair of\narriving at a solution. A lesser man, caught in this awful snare, would\nno doubt have thrown in the towel at once and ceased to struggle; but the\nwhole point about the Woosters is that they are not lesser men.\n\nBy way of a start, I read the note again. Not that I had any hope that a\nsecond perusal would enable me to place a different construction on its\ncontents, but it helped to fill in while the brain was limbering up. I\nthen, to assist thought, had another go at the fruit salad, and in\naddition ate a slice of sponge cake. And it was as I passed on to the\ncheese that the machinery started working. I saw what had to be done.\n\nTo the question which had been exercising the mind--viz., can Bertram\ncope?--I was now able to reply with a confident \"Absolutely.\"\n\nThe great wheeze on these occasions of dirty work at the crossroads is\nnot to lose your head but to keep cool and try to find the ringleaders.\nOnce find the ringleaders, and you know where you are.\n\nThe ringleader here was plainly the Bassett. It was she who had started\nthe whole imbroglio by chucking Gussie, and it was clear that before\nanything could be done to solve and clarify, she must be induced to\nrevise her views and take him on again. This would put Angela back into\ncirculation, and that would cause Tuppy to simmer down a bit, and then we\ncould begin to get somewhere.\n\nI decided that as soon as I had had another morsel of cheese I would seek\nthis Bassett out and be pretty eloquent.\n\nAnd at this moment in she came. I might have foreseen that she would be\nturning up shortly. I mean to say, hearts may ache, but if they know that\nthere is a cold collation set out in the dining-room, they are pretty\nsure to come popping in sooner or later.\n\nHer eyes, as she entered the room, were fixed on the salmon mayonnaise,\nand she would no doubt have made a bee-line for it and started getting\nhers, had I not, in the emotion of seeing her, dropped a glass of the\nbest with which I was endeavouring to bring about a calmer frame of mind.\nThe noise caused her to turn, and for an instant embarrassment\nsupervened. A slight flush mantled the cheek, and the eyes popped a bit.\n\n\"Oh!\" she said.\n\nI have always found that there is nothing that helps to ease you over one\nof these awkward moments like a spot of stage business. Find something to\ndo with your hands, and it's half the battle. I grabbed a plate and\nhastened forward.\n\n\"A touch of salmon?\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"With a suspicion of salad?\"\n\n\"If you please.\"\n\n\"And to drink? Name the poison.\"\n\n\"I think I would like a little orange juice.\"\n\nShe gave a gulp. Not at the orange juice, I don't mean, because she\nhadn't got it yet, but at all the tender associations those two words\nprovoked. It was as if someone had mentioned spaghetti to the relict of\nan Italian organ-grinder. Her face flushed a deeper shade, she registered\nanguish, and I saw that it was no longer within the sphere of practical\npolitics to try to confine the conversation to neutral topics like cold\nboiled salmon.\n\nSo did she, I imagine, for when I, as a preliminary to getting down to\nbrass tacks, said \"Er,\" she said \"Er,\" too, simultaneously, the brace of\n\"Ers\" clashing in mid-air.\n\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon.\"\n\n\"You were saying----\"\n\n\"You were saying----\"\n\n\"No, please go on.\"\n\n\"Oh, right-ho.\"\n\nI straightened the tie, my habit when in this girl's society, and had at\nit:\n\n\"With reference to yours of even date----\"\n\nShe flushed again, and took a rather strained forkful of salmon.\n\n\"You got my note?\"\n\n\"Yes, I got your note.\"\n\n\"I gave it to Jeeves to give it to you.\"\n\n\"Yes, he gave it to me. That's how I got it.\"\n\nThere was another silence. And as she was plainly shrinking from talking\nturkey, I was reluctantly compelled to do so. I mean, somebody had got\nto. Too dashed silly, a male and female in our position simply standing\neating salmon and cheese at one another without a word.\n\n\"Yes, I got it all right.\"\n\n\"I see. You got it.\"\n\n\"Yes, I got it. I've just been reading it. And what I was rather wanting\nto ask you, if we happened to run into each other, was--well, what about\nit?\"\n\n\"What about it?\"\n\n\"That's what I say: What about it?\"\n\n\"But it was quite clear.\"\n\n\"Oh, quite. Perfectly clear. Very well expressed and all that. But--I\nmean--Well, I mean, deeply sensible of the honour, and so forth--but----\nWell, dash it!\"\n\nShe had polished off her salmon, and now put the plate down.\n\n\"Fruit salad?\"\n\n\"No, thank you.\"\n\n\"Spot of pie?\"\n\n\"No, thanks.\"\n\n\"One of those glue things on toast?\"\n\n\"No, thank you.\"\n\nShe took a cheese straw. I found a cold egg which I had overlooked. Then\nI said \"I mean to say\" just as she said \"I think I know\", and there was\nanother collision.\n\n\"I beg your pardon.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Do go on.\"\n\n\"No, you go on.\"\n\nI waved my cold egg courteously, to indicate that she had the floor, and\nshe started again:\n\n\"I think I know what you are trying to say. You are surprised.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You are thinking of----\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"--Mr. Fink-Nottle.\"\n\n\"The very man.\"\n\n\"You find what I have done hard to understand.\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\n\"I don't wonder.\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"And yet it is quite simple.\"\n\nShe took another cheese straw. She seemed to like cheese straws.\n\n\"Quite simple, really. I want to make you happy.\"\n\n\"Dashed decent of you.\"\n\n\"I am going to devote the rest of my life to making you happy.\"\n\n\"A very matey scheme.\"\n\n\"I can at least do that. But--may I be quite frank with you, Bertie?\"\n\n\"Oh, rather.\"\n\n\"Then I must tell you this. I am fond of you. I will marry you. I will do\nmy best to make you a good wife. But my affection for you can never be\nthe flamelike passion I felt for Augustus.\"\n\n\"Just the very point I was working round to. There, as you say, is the\nsnag. Why not chuck the whole idea of hitching up with me? Wash it out\naltogether. I mean, if you love old Gussie----\"\n\n\"No longer.\"\n\n\"Oh, come.\"\n\n\"No. What happened this afternoon has killed my love. A smear of ugliness\nhas been drawn across a thing of beauty, and I can never feel towards him\nas I did.\"\n\nI saw what she meant, of course. Gussie had bunged his heart at her feet;\nshe had picked it up, and, almost immediately after doing so, had\ndiscovered that he had been stewed to the eyebrows all the time. The\nshock must have been severe. No girl likes to feel that a chap has got to\nbe thoroughly plastered before he can ask her to marry him. It wounds the\npride.\n\nNevertheless, I persevered.\n\n\"But have you considered,\" I said, \"that you may have got a wrong line on\nGussie's performance this afternoon? Admitted that all the evidence\npoints to a more sinister theory, what price him simply having got a\ntouch of the sun? Chaps do get touches of the sun, you know, especially\nwhen the weather's hot.\"\n\nShe looked at me, and I saw that she was putting in a bit of the old\ndrenched-irises stuff.\n\n\"It was like you to say that, Bertie. I respect you for it.\"\n\n\"Oh, no.\"\n\n\"Yes. You have a splendid, chivalrous soul.\"\n\n\"Not a bit.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have. You remind me of Cyrano.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Cyrano de Bergerac.\"\n\n\"The chap with the nose?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI can't say I was any too pleased. I felt the old beak furtively. It was\na bit on the prominent side, perhaps, but, dash it, not in the Cyrano\nclass. It began to look as if the next thing this girl would do would be\nto compare me to Schnozzle Durante.\n\n\"He loved, but pleaded another's cause.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see what you mean now.\"\n\n\"I like you for that, Bertie. It was fine of you--fine and big. But it is\nno use. There are things which kill love. I can never forget Augustus,\nbut my love for him is dead. I will be your wife.\"\n\nWell, one has to be civil.\n\n\"Right ho,\" I said. \"Thanks awfully.\"\n\nThen the dialogue sort of poofed out once more, and we stood eating\ncheese straws and cold eggs respectively in silence. There seemed to\nexist some little uncertainty as to what the next move was.\n\nFortunately, before embarrassment could do much more supervening, Angela\ncame in, and this broke up the meeting. Then Bassett announced our\nengagement, and Angela kissed her and said she hoped she would be very,\nvery happy, and the Bassett kissed her and said she hoped she would be\nvery, very happy with Gussie, and Angela said she was sure she would,\nbecause Augustus was such a dear, and the Bassett kissed her again, and\nAngela kissed her again and, in a word, the whole thing got so bally\nfeminine that I was glad to edge away.\n\nI would have been glad to do so, of course, in any case, for if ever\nthere was a moment when it was up to Bertram to think, and think hard,\nthis moment was that moment.\n\nIt was, it seemed to me, the end. Not even on the occasion, some years\nearlier, when I had inadvertently become betrothed to Tuppy's frightful\nCousin Honoria, had I experienced a deeper sense of being waist high in\nthe gumbo and about to sink without trace. I wandered out into the\ngarden, smoking a tortured gasper, with the iron well embedded in the\nsoul. And I had fallen into a sort of trance, trying to picture what it\nwould be like having the Bassett on the premises for the rest of my life\nand at the same time, if you follow me, trying not to picture what it\nwould be like, when I charged into something which might have been a\ntree, but was not--being, in point of fact, Jeeves.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir,\" he said. \"I should have moved to one side.\"\n\nI did not reply. I stood looking at him in silence. For the sight of him\nhad opened up a new line of thought.\n\nThis Jeeves, now, I reflected. I had formed the opinion that he had lost\nhis grip and was no longer the force he had been, but was it not\npossible, I asked myself, that I might be mistaken? Start him off\nexploring avenues and might he not discover one through which I would be\nenabled to sneak off to safety, leaving no hard feelings behind? I found\nmyself answering that it was quite on the cards that he might.\n\nAfter all, his head still bulged out at the back as of old. One noted in\nthe eyes the same intelligent glitter.\n\nMind you, after what had passed between us in the matter of that white\nmess-jacket with the brass buttons, I was not prepared absolutely to hand\nover to the man. I would, of course, merely take him into consultation.\nBut, recalling some of his earlier triumphs--the Sipperley Case, the\nEpisode of My Aunt Agatha and the Dog McIntosh, and the smoothly handled\nAffair of Uncle George and The Barmaid's Niece were a few that sprang to\nmy mind--I felt justified at least in offering him the opportunity of\ncoming to the aid of the young master in his hour of peril.\n\nBut before proceeding further, there was one thing that had got to be\nunderstood between us, and understood clearly.\n\n\"Jeeves,\" I said, \"a word with you.\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"I am up against it a bit, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to hear that, sir. Can I be of any assistance?\"\n\n\"Quite possibly you can, if you have not lost your grip. Tell me frankly,\nJeeves, are you in pretty good shape mentally?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Still eating plenty of fish?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Then it may be all right. But there is just one point before I begin. In\nthe past, when you have contrived to extricate self or some pal from some\nlittle difficulty, you have frequently shown a disposition to take\nadvantage of my gratitude to gain some private end. Those purple socks,\nfor instance. Also the plus fours and the Old Etonian spats. Choosing\nyour moment with subtle cunning, you came to me when I was weakened by\nrelief and got me to get rid of them. And what I am saying now is that if\nyou are successful on the present occasion there must be no rot of that\ndescription about that mess-jacket of mine.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\n\"You will not come to me when all is over and ask me to jettison the\njacket?\"\n\n\"Certainly not, sir.\"\n\n\"On that understanding then, I will carry on. Jeeves, I'm engaged.\"\n\n\"I hope you will be very happy, sir.\"\n\n\"Don't be an ass. I'm engaged to Miss Bassett.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir? I was not aware----\"\n\n\"Nor was I. It came as a complete surprise. However, there it is. The\nofficial intimation was in that note you brought me.\"\n\n\"Odd, sir.\"\n\n\"What is?\"\n\n\"Odd, sir, that the contents of that note should have been as you\ndescribe. It seemed to me that Miss Bassett, when she handed me the\ncommunication, was far from being in a happy frame of mind.\"\n\n\"She is far from being in a happy frame of mind. You don't suppose she\nreally wants to marry me, do you? Pshaw, Jeeves! Can't you see that this\nis simply another of those bally gestures which are rapidly rendering\nBrinkley Court a hell for man and beast? Dash all gestures, is my view.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, what's to be done?\"\n\n\"You feel that Miss Bassett, despite what has occurred, still retains a\nfondness for Mr. Fink-Nottle, sir?\"\n\n\"She's pining for him.\"\n\n\"In that case, sir, surely the best plan would be to bring about a\nreconciliation between them.\"\n\n\"How? You see. You stand silent and twiddle the fingers. You are\nstumped.\"\n\n\"No, sir. If I twiddled my fingers, it was merely to assist thought.\"\n\n\"Then continue twiddling.\"\n\n\"It will not be necessary, sir.\"\n\n\"You don't mean you've got a bite already?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You astound me, Jeeves. Let's have it.\"\n\n\"The device which I have in mind is one that I have already mentioned to\nyou, sir.\"\n\n\"When did you ever mention any device to me?\"\n\n\"If you will throw your mind back to the evening of our arrival, sir. You\nwere good enough to inquire of me if I had any plan to put forward with a\nview to bringing Miss Angela and Mr. Glossop together, and I ventured to\nsuggest----\"\n\n\"Good Lord! Not the old fire-alarm thing?\"\n\n\"Precisely, sir.\"\n\n\"You're still sticking to that?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nIt shows how much the ghastly blow I had received had shaken me when I\nsay that, instead of dismissing the proposal with a curt \"Tchah!\" or\nanything like that, I found myself speculating as to whether there might\nnot be something in it, after all.\n\nWhen he had first mooted this fire-alarm scheme of his, I had sat upon\nit, if you remember, with the maximum of promptitude and vigour. \"Rotten\"\nwas the adjective I had employed to describe it, and you may recall that\nI mused a bit sadly, considering the idea conclusive proof of the general\nbreakdown of a once fine mind. But now it somehow began to look as if it\nmight have possibilities. The fact of the matter was that I had about\nreached the stage where I was prepared to try anything once, however\ngoofy.\n\n\"Just run through that wheeze again, Jeeves,\" I said thoughtfully. \"I\nremember thinking it cuckoo, but it may be that I missed some of the\nfiner shades.\"\n\n\"Your criticism of it at the time, sir, was that it was too elaborate,\nbut I do not think it is so in reality. As I see it, sir, the occupants\nof the house, hearing the fire bell ring, will suppose that a\nconflagration has broken out.\"\n\nI nodded. One could follow the train of thought.\n\n\"Yes, that seems reasonable.\"\n\n\"Whereupon Mr. Glossop will hasten to save Miss Angela, while Mr.\nFink-Nottle performs the same office for Miss Bassett.\"\n\n\"Is that based on psychology?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Possibly you may recollect that it was an axiom of the late\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle's fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes, that the\ninstinct of everyone, upon an alarm of fire, is to save the object\ndearest to them.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that there is a grave danger of seeing Tuppy come out\ncarrying a steak-and-kidney pie, but resume, Jeeves, resume. You think\nthat this would clean everything up?\"\n\n\"The relations of the two young couples could scarcely continue distant\nafter such an occurrence, sir.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you're right. But, dash it, if we go ringing fire bells in the\nnight watches, shan't we scare half the domestic staff into fits? There\nis one of the housemaids--Jane, I believe--who already skips like the\nhigh hills if I so much as come on her unexpectedly round a corner.\"\n\n\"A neurotic girl, sir, I agree. I have noticed her. But by acting\npromptly we should avoid such a contingency. The entire staff, with the\nexception of Monsieur Anatole, will be at the ball at Kingham Manor\ntonight.\"\n\n\"Of course. That just shows the condition this thing has reduced me to.\nForget my own name next. Well, then, let's just try to envisage. Bong\ngoes the bell. Gussie rushes and grabs the Bassett.... Wait. Why\nshouldn't she simply walk downstairs?\"\n\n\"You are overlooking the effect of sudden alarm on the feminine\ntemperament, sir.\"\n\n\"That's true.\"\n\n\"Miss Bassett's impulse, I would imagine, sir, would be to leap from her\nwindow.\"\n\n\"Well, that's worse. We don't want her spread out in a sort of _pur\u00c3\u00a9e_ on\nthe lawn. It seems to me that the flaw in this scheme of yours, Jeeves,\nis that it's going to litter the garden with mangled corpses.\"\n\n\"No, sir. You will recall that Mr. Travers's fear of burglars has caused\nhim to have stout bars fixed to all the windows.\"\n\n\"Of course, yes. Well, it sounds all right,\" I said, though still a bit\ndoubtfully. \"Quite possibly it may come off. But I have a feeling that it\nwill slip up somewhere. However, I am in no position to cavil at even a\n100 to 1 shot. I will adopt this policy of yours, Jeeves, though, as I\nsay, with misgivings. At what hour would you suggest bonging the bell?\"\n\n\"Not before midnight, sir.\"\n\n\"That is to say, some time after midnight.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Right-ho, then. At 12.30 on the dot, I will bong.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\n\n\n-22-\n\n\nI Don't know why it is, but there's something about the rural districts\nafter dark that always has a rummy effect on me. In London I can stay out\ntill all hours and come home with the milk without a tremor, but put me\nin the garden of a country house after the strength of the company has\ngone to roost and the place is shut up, and a sort of goose-fleshy\nfeeling steals over me. The night wind stirs the tree-tops, twigs crack,\nbushes rustle, and before I know where I am, the morale has gone phut and\nI'm expecting the family ghost to come sneaking up behind me, making\ngroaning noises. Dashed unpleasant, the whole thing, and if you think it\nimproves matters to know that you are shortly about to ring the loudest\nfire bell in England and start an all-hands-to-the-pumps panic in that\nquiet, darkened house, you err.\n\nI knew all about the Brinkley Court fire bell. The dickens of a row it\nmakes. Uncle Tom, in addition to not liking burglars, is a bloke who has\nalways objected to the idea of being cooked in his sleep, so when he\nbought the place he saw to it that the fire bell should be something that\nmight give you heart failure, but which you couldn't possibly mistake for\nthe drowsy chirping of a sparrow in the ivy.\n\nWhen I was a kid and spent my holidays at Brinkley, we used to have fire\ndrills after closing time, and many is the night I've had it jerk me out\nof the dreamless like the Last Trump.\n\nI confess that the recollection of what this bell could do when it\nbuckled down to it gave me pause as I stood that night at 12.30 p.m.\nprompt beside the outhouse where it was located. The sight of the rope\nagainst the whitewashed wall and the thought of the bloodsome uproar\nwhich was about to smash the peace of the night into hash served to\ndeepen that rummy feeling to which I have alluded.\n\nMoreover, now that I had had time to meditate upon it, I was more than\never defeatist about this scheme of Jeeves's.\n\nJeeves seemed to take it for granted that Gussie and Tuppy, faced with a\nhideous fate, would have no thought beyond saving the Bassett and Angela.\n\nI could not bring myself to share his sunny confidence.\n\nI mean to say, I know how moments when they're faced with a hideous fate\naffect chaps. I remember Freddie Widgeon, one of the most chivalrous\nbirds in the Drones, telling me how there was an alarm of fire once at a\nseaside hotel where he was staying and, so far from rushing about saving\nwomen, he was down the escape within ten seconds of the kick-off, his\nmind concerned with but one thing--viz., the personal well-being of\nF. Widgeon.\n\nAs far as any idea of doing the delicately nurtured a bit of good went,\nhe tells me, he was prepared to stand underneath and catch them in\nblankets, but no more.\n\nWhy, then, should this not be so with Augustus Fink-Nottle and Hildebrand\nGlossop?\n\nSuch were my thoughts as I stood toying with the rope, and I believe I\nshould have turned the whole thing up, had it not been that at this\njuncture there floated into my mind a picture of the Bassett hearing that\nbell for the first time. Coming as a wholly new experience, it would\nprobably startle her into a decline.\n\nAnd so agreeable was this reflection that I waited no longer, but seized\nthe rope, braced the feet and snapped into it.\n\nWell, as I say, I hadn't been expecting that bell to hush things up to\nany great extent. Nor did it. The last time I had heard it, I had been in\nmy room on the other side of the house, and even so it had hoiked me out\nof bed as if something had exploded under me. Standing close to it like\nthis, I got the full force and meaning of the thing, and I've never heard\nanything like it in my puff.\n\nI rather enjoy a bit of noise, as a general rule. I remember Cats-meat\nPotter-Pirbright bringing a police rattle into the Drones one night and\nloosing it off behind my chair, and I just lay back and closed my eyes\nwith a pleasant smile, like someone in a box at the opera. And the same\napplies to the time when my Aunt Agatha's son, young Thos., put a match\nto the parcel of Guy Fawkes Day fireworks to see what would happen.\n\nBut the Brinkley Court fire bell was too much for me. I gave about half a\ndozen tugs, and then, feeling that enough was enough, sauntered round to\nthe front lawn to ascertain what solid results had been achieved.\n\nBrinkley Court had given of its best. A glance told me that we were\nplaying to capacity. The eye, roving to and fro, noted here Uncle Tom in\na purple dressing gown, there Aunt Dahlia in the old blue and yellow. It\nalso fell upon Anatole, Tuppy, Gussie, Angela, the Bassett and Jeeves, in\nthe order named. There they all were, present and correct.\n\nBut--and this was what caused me immediate concern--I could detect no\nsign whatever that there had been any rescue work going on.\n\nWhat I had been hoping, of course, was to see Tuppy bending solicitously\nover Angela in one corner, while Gussie fanned the Bassett with a towel\nin the other. Instead of which, the Bassett was one of the group which\nincluded Aunt Dahlia and Uncle Tom and seemed to be busy trying to make\nAnatole see the bright side, while Angela and Gussie were, respectively,\nleaning against the sundial with a peeved look and sitting on the grass\nrubbing a barked shin. Tuppy was walking up and down the path, all by\nhimself.\n\nA disturbing picture, you will admit. It was with a rather imperious\ngesture that I summoned Jeeves to my side.\n\n\"Well, Jeeves?\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\nI eyed him sternly. \"Sir?\" forsooth!\n\n\"It's no good saying 'Sir?' Jeeves. Look round you. See for yourself.\nYour scheme has proved a bust.\"\n\n\"Certainly it would appear that matters have not arranged themselves\nquite as we anticipated, sir.\"\n\n\"We?\"\n\n\"As I had anticipated, sir.\"\n\n\"That's more like it. Didn't I tell you it would be a flop?\"\n\n\"I remember that you did seem dubious, sir.\"\n\n\"Dubious is no word for it, Jeeves. I hadn't a scrap of faith in the idea\nfrom the start. When you first mooted it, I said it was rotten, and I was\nright. I'm not blaming you, Jeeves. It is not your fault that you have\nsprained your brain. But after this--forgive me if I hurt your feelings,\nJeeves----I shall know better than to allow you to handle any but the\nsimplest and most elementary problems. It is best to be candid about\nthis, don't you think? Kindest to be frank and straightforward?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir.\"\n\n\"I mean, the surgeon's knife, what?\"\n\n\"Precisely, sir.\"\n\n\"I consider----\"\n\n\"If you will pardon me for interrupting you, sir, I fancy Mrs. Travers is\nendeavouring to attract your attention.\"\n\nAnd at this moment a ringing \"Hoy!\" which could have proceeded only from\nthe relative in question, assured me that his view was correct.\n\n\"Just step this way a moment, Attila, if you don't mind,\" boomed that\nwell-known--and under certain conditions, well-loved--voice, and I moved\nover.\n\nI was not feeling unmixedly at my ease. For the first time it was\nbeginning to steal upon me that I had not prepared a really good story in\nsupport of my questionable behaviour in ringing fire bells at such an\nhour, and I have known Aunt Dahlia to express herself with a hearty\nfreedom upon far smaller provocation.\n\nShe exhibited, however, no signs of violence. More a sort of frozen calm,\nif you know what I mean. You could see that she was a woman who had\nsuffered.\n\n\"Well, Bertie, dear,\" she said, \"here we all are.\"\n\n\"Quite,\" I replied guardedly.\n\n\"Nobody missing, is there?\"\n\n\"I don't think so.\"\n\n\"Splendid. So much healthier for us out in the open like this than\nfrowsting in bed. I had just dropped off when you did your bell-ringing\nact. For it was you, my sweet child, who rang that bell, was it not?\"\n\n\"I did ring the bell, yes.\"\n\n\"Any particular reason, or just a whim?\"\n\n\"I thought there was a fire.\"\n\n\"What gave you that impression, dear?\"\n\n\"I thought I saw flames.\"\n\n\"Where, darling? Tell Aunt Dahlia.\"\n\n\"In one of the windows.\"\n\n\"I see. So we have all been dragged out of bed and scared rigid because\nyou have been seeing things.\"\n\nHere Uncle Tom made a noise like a cork coming out of a bottle, and\nAnatole, whose moustache had hit a new low, said something about \"some\napes\" and, if I am not mistaken, a \"_rogommier_\"--whatever that is.\n\n\"I admit I was mistaken. I am sorry.\"\n\n\"Don't apologize, ducky. Can't you see how pleased we all are? What were\nyou doing out here, anyway?\"\n\n\"Just taking a stroll.\"\n\n\"I see. And are you proposing to continue your stroll?\"\n\n\"No, I think I'll go in now.\"\n\n\"That's fine. Because I was thinking of going in, too, and I don't\nbelieve I could sleep knowing you were out here giving rein to that\npowerful imagination of yours. The next thing that would happen would be\nthat you would think you saw a pink elephant sitting on the drawing-room\nwindow-sill and start throwing bricks at it.... Well, come on, Tom, the\nentertainment seems to be over.... But wait. The newt king wishes a word\nwith us.... Yes, Mr. Fink-Nottle?\"\n\nGussie, as he joined our little group, seemed upset about something.\n\n\"I say!\"\n\n\"Say on, Augustus.\"\n\n\"I say, what are we going to do?\"\n\n\"Speaking for myself, I intend to return to bed.\"\n\n\"But the door's shut.\"\n\n\"What door?\"\n\n\"The front door. Somebody must have shut it.\"\n\n\"Then I shall open it.\"\n\n\"But it won't open.\"\n\n\"Then I shall try another door.\"\n\n\"But all the other doors are shut.\"\n\n\"What? Who shut them?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nI advanced a theory!\n\n\"The wind?\"\n\nAunt Dahlia's eyes met mine.\n\n\"Don't try me too high,\" she begged. \"Not now, precious.\" And, indeed,\neven as I spoke, it did strike me that the night was pretty still.\n\nUncle Tom said we must get in through a window. Aunt Dahlia sighed a bit.\n\n\"How? Could Lloyd George do it, could Winston do it, could Baldwin do it?\nNo. Not since you had those bars of yours put on.\"\n\n\"Well, well, well. God bless my soul, ring the bell, then.\"\n\n\"The fire bell?\"\n\n\"The door bell.\"\n\n\"To what end, Thomas? There's nobody in the house. The servants are all\nat Kingham.\"\n\n\"But, confound it all, we can't stop out here all night.\"\n\n\"Can't we? You just watch us. There is nothing--literally nothing--which\na country house party can't do with Attila here operating on the\npremises. Seppings presumably took the back-door key with him. We must\njust amuse ourselves till he comes back.\"\n\nTuppy made a suggestion:\n\n\"Why not take out one of the cars and drive over to Kingham and get the\nkey from Seppings?\"\n\nIt went well. No question about that. For the first time, a smile lit up\nAunt Dahlia's drawn face. Uncle Tom grunted approvingly. Anatole said\nsomething in Proven\u00c3\u00a7al that sounded complimentary. And I thought I\ndetected even on Angela's map a slight softening.\n\n\"A very excellent idea,\" said Aunt Dahlia. \"One of the best. Nip round to\nthe garage at once.\"\n\nAfter Tuppy had gone, some extremely flattering things were said about\nhis intelligence and resource, and there was a disposition to draw rather\ninvidious comparisons between him and Bertram. Painful for me, of course,\nbut the ordeal didn't last long, for it couldn't have been more than five\nminutes before he was with us again.\n\nTuppy seemed perturbed.\n\n\"I say, it's all off.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"The garage is locked.\"\n\n\"Unlock it.\"\n\n\"I haven't the key.\"\n\n\"Shout, then, and wake Waterbury.\"\n\n\"Who's Waterbury?\"\n\n\"The chauffeur, ass. He sleeps over the garage.\"\n\n\"But he's gone to the dance at Kingham.\"\n\nIt was the final wallop. Until this moment, Aunt Dahlia had been able to\npreserve her frozen calm. The dam now burst. The years rolled away from\nher, and she was once more the Dahlia Wooster of the old yoicks-and-tantivy\ndays--the emotional, free-speaking girl who had so often risen in\nher stirrups to yell derogatory personalities at people who were heading\nhounds.\n\n\"Curse all dancing chauffeurs! What on earth does a chauffeur want to\ndance for? I mistrusted that man from the start. Something told me he was\na dancer. Well, this finishes it. We're out here till breakfast-time. If\nthose blasted servants come back before eight o'clock, I shall be vastly\nsurprised. You won't get Seppings away from a dance till you throw him\nout. I know him. The jazz'll go to his head, and he'll stand clapping and\ndemanding encores till his hands blister. Damn all dancing butlers! What\nis Brinkley Court? A respectable English country house or a crimson\ndancing school? One might as well be living in the middle of the Russian\nBallet. Well, all right. If we must stay out here, we must. We shall all\nbe frozen stiff, except\"--here she directed at me not one of her\nfriendliest glances----\"except dear old Attila, who is, I observe, well and\nwarmly clad. We will resign ourselves to the prospect of freezing to\ndeath like the Babes in the Wood, merely expressing a dying wish that our\nold pal Attila will see that we are covered with leaves. No doubt he will\nalso toll that fire bell of his as a mark of respect--And what might you\nwant, my good man?\"\n\nShe broke off, and stood glaring at Jeeves. During the latter portion of\nher address, he had been standing by in a respectful manner, endeavouring\nto catch the speaker's eye.\n\n\"If I might make a suggestion, madam.\"\n\nI am not saying that in the course of our long association I have always\nfound myself able to view Jeeves with approval. There are aspects of his\ncharacter which have frequently caused coldnesses to arise between us. He\nis one of those fellows who, if you give them a thingummy, take a\nwhat-d'you-call-it. His work is often raw, and he has been known to allude\nto me as \"mentally negligible\". More than once, as I have shown, it has\nbeen my painful task to squelch in him a tendency to get uppish and treat\nthe young master as a serf or peon.\n\nThese are grave defects.\n\nBut one thing I have never failed to hand the man. He is magnetic. There\nis about him something that seems to soothe and hypnotize. To the best of\nmy knowledge, he has never encountered a charging rhinoceros, but should\nthis contingency occur, I have no doubt that the animal, meeting his eye,\nwould check itself in mid-stride, roll over and lie purring with its legs\nin the air.\n\nAt any rate he calmed down Aunt Dahlia, the nearest thing to a charging\nrhinoceros, in under five seconds. He just stood there looking\nrespectful, and though I didn't time the thing--not having a stop-watch\non me--I should say it wasn't more than three seconds and a quarter\nbefore her whole manner underwent an astounding change for the better.\nShe melted before one's eyes.\n\n\"Jeeves! You haven't got an idea?\"\n\n\"Yes, madam.\"\n\n\"That great brain of yours has really clicked as ever in the hour of\nneed?\"\n\n\"Yes, madam.\"\n\n\"Jeeves,\" said Aunt Dahlia in a shaking voice, \"I am sorry I spoke so\nabruptly. I was not myself. I might have known that you would not come\nsimply trying to make conversation. Tell us this idea of yours, Jeeves.\nJoin our little group of thinkers and let us hear what you have to say.\nMake yourself at home, Jeeves, and give us the good word. Can you really\nget us out of this mess?\"\n\n\"Yes, madam, if one of the gentlemen would be willing to ride a bicycle.\"\n\n\"A bicycle?\"\n\n\"There is a bicycle in the gardener's shed in the kitchen garden, madam.\nPossibly one of the gentlemen might feel disposed to ride over to Kingham\nManor and procure the back-door key from Mr. Seppings.\"\n\n\"Splendid, Jeeves!\"\n\n\"Thank you, madam.\"\n\n\"Wonderful!\"\n\n\"Thank you, madam.\"\n\n\"Attila!\" said Aunt Dahlia, turning and speaking in a quiet,\nauthoritative manner.\n\nI had been expecting it. From the very moment those ill-judged words had\npassed the fellow's lips, I had had a presentiment that a determined\neffort would be made to elect me as the goat, and I braced myself to\nresist and obstruct.\n\nAnd as I was about to do so, while I was in the very act of summoning up\nall my eloquence to protest that I didn't know how to ride a bike and\ncouldn't possibly learn in the brief time at my disposal, I'm dashed if\nthe man didn't go and nip me in the bud.\n\n\"Yes, madam, Mr. Wooster would perform the task admirably. He is an\nexpert cyclist. He has often boasted to me of his triumphs on the wheel.\"\n\nI hadn't. I hadn't done anything of the sort. It's simply monstrous how\none's words get twisted. All I had ever done was to mention to\nhim--casually, just as an interesting item of information, one day in New\nYork when we were watching the six-day bicycle race--that at the age of\nfourteen, while spending my holidays with a vicar of sorts who had been\ntold off to teach me Latin, I had won the Choir Boys' Handicap at the\nlocal school treat.\n\nA different thing from boasting of one's triumphs on the wheel.\n\nI mean, he was a man of the world and must have known that the form of\nschool treats is never of the hottest. And, if I'm not mistaken, I had\nspecifically told him that on the occasion referred to I had received\nhalf a lap start and that Willie Punting, the odds-on favourite to whom\nthe race was expected to be a gift, had been forced to retire, owing to\nhaving pinched his elder brother's machine without asking the elder\nbrother, and the elder brother coming along just as the pistol went and\ngiving him one on the side of the head and taking it away from him, thus\nrendering him a scratched-at-the-post non-starter. Yet, from the way he\ntalked, you would have thought I was one of those chaps in sweaters with\nmedals all over them, whose photographs bob up from time to time in the\nillustrated press on the occasion of their having ridden from Hyde Park\nCorner to Glasgow in three seconds under the hour, or whatever it is.\n\nAnd as if this were not bad enough, Tuppy had to shove his oar in.\n\n\"That's right,\" said Tuppy. \"Bertie has always been a great cyclist. I\nremember at Oxford he used to take all his clothes off on bump-supper\nnights and ride around the quad, singing comic songs. Jolly fast he used\nto go too.\"\n\n\"Then he can go jolly fast now,\" said Aunt Dahlia with animation. \"He\ncan't go too fast for me. He may also sing comic songs, if he likes....\nAnd if you wish to take your clothes off, Bertie, my lamb, by all means\ndo so. But whether clothed or in the nude, whether singing comic songs or\nnot singing comic songs, get a move on.\"\n\nI found speech:\n\n\"But I haven't ridden for years.\"\n\n\"Then it's high time you began again.\"\n\n\"I've probably forgotten how to ride.\"\n\n\"You'll soon get the knack after you've taken a toss or two. Trial and\nerror. The only way.\"\n\n\"But it's miles to Kingham.\"\n\n\"So the sooner you're off, the better.\"\n\n\"But----\"\n\n\"Bertie, dear.\"\n\n\"But, dash it----\"\n\n\"Bertie, darling.\"\n\n\"Yes, but dash it----\"\n\n\"Bertie, my sweet.\"\n\nAnd so it was arranged. Presently I was moving sombrely off through the\ndarkness, Jeeves at my side, Aunt Dahlia calling after me something about\ntrying to imagine myself the man who brought the good news from Ghent to\nAix. The first I had heard of the chap.\n\n\"So, Jeeves,\" I said, as we reached the shed, and my voice was cold and\nbitter, \"this is what your great scheme has accomplished! Tuppy, Angela,\nGussie and the Bassett not on speaking terms, and self faced with an\neight-mile ride----\"\n\n\"Nine, I believe, sir.\"\n\n\"--a nine-mile ride, and another nine-mile ride back.\"\n\n\"I am sorry, sir.\"\n\n\"No good being sorry now. Where is this foul bone-shaker?\"\n\n\"I will bring it out, sir.\"\n\nHe did so. I eyed it sourly.\n\n\"Where's the lamp?\"\n\n\"I fear there is no lamp, sir.\"\n\n\"No lamp?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"But I may come a fearful stinker without a lamp. Suppose I barge into\nsomething.\"\n\nI broke off and eyed him frigidly.\n\n\"You smile, Jeeves. The thought amuses you?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir. I was thinking of a tale my Uncle Cyril used to\ntell me as a child. An absurd little story, sir, though I confess that I\nhave always found it droll. According to my Uncle Cyril, two men named\nNicholls and Jackson set out to ride to Brighton on a tandem bicycle, and\nwere so unfortunate as to come into collision with a brewer's van. And\nwhen the rescue party arrived on the scene of the accident, it was\ndiscovered that they had been hurled together with such force that it was\nimpossible to sort them out at all adequately. The keenest eye could not\ndiscern which portion of the fragments was Nicholls and which Jackson. So\nthey collected as much as they could, and called it Nixon. I remember\nlaughing very much at that story when I was a child, sir.\"\n\nI had to pause a moment to master my feelings.\n\n\"You did, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You thought it funny?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And your Uncle Cyril thought it funny?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Golly, what a family! Next time you meet your Uncle Cyril, Jeeves, you\ncan tell him from me that his sense of humour is morbid and unpleasant.\"\n\n\"He is dead, sir.\"\n\n\"Thank heaven for that.... Well, give me the blasted machine.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\n\"Are the tyres inflated?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"The nuts firm, the brakes in order, the sprockets running true with the\ndifferential gear?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Right ho, Jeeves.\"\n\nIn Tuppy's statement that, when at the University of Oxford, I had been\nknown to ride a bicycle in the nude about the quadrangle of our mutual\ncollege, there had been, I cannot deny, a certain amount of substance.\nCorrect, however, though his facts were, so far as they went, he had not\ntold all. What he had omitted to mention was that I had invariably been\nwell oiled at the time, and when in that condition a chap is capable of\nfeats at which in cooler moments his reason would rebel.\n\nStimulated by the juice, I believe, men have even been known to ride\nalligators.\n\nAs I started now to pedal out into the great world, I was icily sober,\nand the old skill, in consequence, had deserted me entirely. I found\nmyself wobbling badly, and all the stories I had ever heard of nasty\nbicycle accidents came back to me with a rush, headed by Jeeves's Uncle\nCyril's cheery little anecdote about Nicholls and Jackson.\n\nPounding wearily through the darkness, I found myself at a loss to fathom\nthe mentality of men like Jeeves's Uncle Cyril. What on earth he could\nsee funny in a disaster which had apparently involved the complete\nextinction of a human creature--or, at any rate, of half a human creature\nand half another human creature--was more than I could understand. To me,\nthe thing was one of the most poignant tragedies that had ever been\nbrought to my attention, and I have no doubt that I should have continued\nto brood over it for quite a time, had my thoughts not been diverted by\nthe sudden necessity of zigzagging sharply in order to avoid a pig in the\nfairway.\n\nFor a moment it looked like being real Nicholls-and-Jackson stuff, but,\nfortunately, a quick zig on my part, coinciding with an adroit zag on the\npart of the pig, enabled me to win through, and I continued my ride safe,\nbut with the heart fluttering like a captive bird.\n\nThe effect of this narrow squeak upon me was to shake the nerve to the\nutmost. The fact that pigs were abroad in the night seemed to bring home\nto me the perilous nature of my enterprise. It set me thinking of all the\nother things that could happen to a man out and about on a velocipede\nwithout a lamp after lighting-up time. In particular, I recalled the\nstatement of a pal of mine that in certain sections of the rural\ndistricts goats were accustomed to stray across the road to the extent of\ntheir chains, thereby forming about as sound a booby trap as one could\nwell wish.\n\nHe mentioned, I remember, the case of a friend of his whose machine got\nentangled with a goat chain and who was dragged seven miles--like\nskijoring in Switzerland--so that he was never the same man again. And\nthere was one chap who ran into an elephant, left over from a travelling\ncircus.\n\nIndeed, taking it for all in all, it seemed to me that, with the possible\nexception of being bitten by sharks, there was virtually no front-page\ndisaster that could not happen to a fellow, once he had allowed his dear\nones to override his better judgment and shove him out into the great\nunknown on a push-bike, and I am not ashamed to confess that, taking it\nby and large, the amount of quailing I did from this point on was pretty\nconsiderable.\n\nHowever, in respect to goats and elephants, I must say things panned out\nunexpectedly well.\n\nOddly enough, I encountered neither. But when you have said that you have\nsaid everything, for in every other way the conditions could scarcely\nhave been fouler.\n\nApart from the ceaseless anxiety of having to keep an eye skinned for\nelephants, I found myself much depressed by barking dogs, and once I\nreceived a most unpleasant shock when, alighting to consult a signpost, I\nsaw sitting on top of it an owl that looked exactly like my Aunt Agatha.\nSo agitated, indeed, had my frame of mind become by this time that I\nthought at first it was Aunt Agatha, and only when reason and reflection\ntold me how alien to her habits it would be to climb signposts and sit on\nthem, could I pull myself together and overcome the weakness.\n\nIn short, what with all this mental disturbance added to the more purely\nphysical anguish in the billowy portions and the calves and ankles, the\nBertram Wooster who eventually toppled off at the door of Kingham Manor\nwas a very different Bertram from the gay and insouciant _boulevardier_\nof Bond Street and Piccadilly.\n\nEven to one unaware of the inside facts, it would have been evident that\nKingham Manor was throwing its weight about a bit tonight. Lights shone\nin the windows, music was in the air, and as I drew nearer my ear\ndetected the sibilant shuffling of the feet of butlers, footmen,\nchauffeurs, parlourmaids, housemaids, tweenies and, I have no doubt,\ncooks, who were busily treading the measure. I suppose you couldn't sum\nit up much better than by saying that there was a sound of revelry by\nnight.\n\nThe orgy was taking place in one of the ground-floor rooms which had\nFrench windows opening on to the drive, and it was to these French\nwindows that I now made my way. An orchestra was playing something with a\ngood deal of zip to it, and under happier conditions I dare say my feet\nwould have started twitching in time to the melody. But I had sterner\nwork before me than to stand hoofing it by myself on gravel drives.\n\nI wanted that back-door key, and I wanted it instanter.\n\nScanning the throng within, I found it difficult for a while to spot\nSeppings. Presently, however, he hove in view, doing fearfully lissom\nthings in mid-floor. I \"Hi-Seppings!\"-ed a couple of times, but his mind\nwas too much on his job to be diverted, and it was only when the swirl of\nthe dance had brought him within prodding distance of my forefinger that\na quick one to the lower ribs enabled me to claim his attention.\n\nThe unexpected buffet caused him to trip over his partner's feet, and it\nwas with marked austerity that he turned. As he recognized Bertram,\nhowever, coldness melted, to be replaced by astonishment.\n\n\"Mr. Wooster!\"\n\nI was in no mood for bandying words.\n\n\"Less of the 'Mr. Wooster' and more back-door keys,\" I said curtly. \"Give\nme the key of the back door, Seppings.\"\n\nHe did not seem to grasp the gist.\n\n\"The key of the back door, sir?\"\n\n\"Precisely. The Brinkley Court back-door key.\"\n\n\"But it is at the Court, sir.\"\n\nI clicked the tongue, annoyed.\n\n\"Don't be frivolous, my dear old butler,\" I said. \"I haven't ridden nine\nmiles on a push-bike to listen to you trying to be funny. You've got it\nin your trousers pocket.\"\n\n\"No, sir. I left it with Mr. Jeeves.\"\n\n\"You did--what?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Before I came away. Mr. Jeeves said that he wished to walk in\nthe garden before retiring for the night. He was to place the key on the\nkitchen window-sill.\"\n\nI stared at the man dumbly. His eye was clear, his hand steady. He had\nnone of the appearance of a butler who has had a couple.\n\n\"You mean that all this while the key has been in Jeeves's possession?\"??\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nI could speak no more. Emotion had overmastered my voice. I was at a loss\nand not abreast; but of one thing, it seemed to me, there could be no\ndoubt. For some reason, not to be fathomed now, but most certainly to be\ngone well into as soon as I had pushed this infernal sewing-machine of\nmine over those nine miles of lonely, country road and got within\nstriking distance of him, Jeeves had been doing the dirty. Knowing that\nat any given moment he could have solved the whole situation, he had kept\nAunt Dahlia and others roosting out on the front lawn _en d\u00c3\u00a9shabille_\nand, worse still, had stood calmly by and watched his young employer set\nout on a wholly unnecessary eighteen-mile bicycle ride.\n\nI could scarcely believe such a thing of him. Of his Uncle Cyril, yes.\nWith that distorted sense of humour of his, Uncle Cyril might quite\nconceivably have been capable of such conduct. But that it should be\nJeeves--\n\nI leaped into the saddle and, stifling the cry of agony which rose to the\nlips as the bruised person touched the hard leather, set out on the\nhomeward journey.\n\n\n\n-23-\n\n\nI remember Jeeves saying on one occasion--I forgot how the subject had\narisen--he may simply have thrown the observation out, as he does\nsometimes, for me to take or leave--that hell hath no fury like a woman\nscorned. And until tonight I had always felt that there was a lot in it.\nI had never scorned a woman myself, but Pongo Twistleton once scorned an\naunt of his, flatly refusing to meet her son Gerald at Paddington and\ngive him lunch and see him off to school at Waterloo, and he never heard\nthe end of it. Letters were written, he tells me, which had to be seen to\nbe believed. Also two very strong telegrams and a bitter picture post\ncard with a view of the Little Chilbury War Memorial on it.\n\nUntil tonight, therefore, as I say, I had never questioned the accuracy\nof the statement. Scorned women first and the rest nowhere, was how it\nhad always seemed to me.\n\nBut tonight I revised my views. If you want to know what hell can really\ndo in the way of furies, look for the chap who has been hornswoggled into\ntaking a long and unnecessary bicycle ride in the dark without a lamp.\n\nMark that word \"unnecessary\". That was the part of it that really jabbed\nthe iron into the soul. I mean, if it was a case of riding to the\ndoctor's to save the child with croup, or going off to the local pub to\nfetch supplies in the event of the cellar having run dry, no one would\nleap to the handlebars more readily than I. Young Lochinvar, absolutely.\nBut this business of being put through it merely to gratify one's\npersonal attendant's diseased sense of the amusing was a bit too thick,\nand I chafed from start to finish.\n\nSo, what I mean to say, although the providence which watches over good\nmen saw to it that I was enabled to complete the homeward journey\nunscathed except in the billowy portions, removing from my path all\ngoats, elephants, and even owls that looked like my Aunt Agatha, it was\na frowning and jaundiced Bertram who finally came to anchor at the\nBrinkley Court front door. And when I saw a dark figure emerging from\nthe porch to meet me, I prepared to let myself go and uncork all that was\nfizzing in the mind.\n\n\"Jeeves!\" I said.\n\n\"It is I, Bertie.\"\n\nThe voice which spoke sounded like warm treacle, and even if I had not\nrecognized it immediately as that of the Bassett, I should have known\nthat it did not proceed from the man I was yearning to confront. For this\nfigure before me was wearing a simple tweed dress and had employed my\nfirst name in its remarks. And Jeeves, whatever his moral defects, would\nnever go about in skirts calling me Bertie.\n\nThe last person, of course, whom I would have wished to meet after a long\nevening in the saddle, but I vouchsafed a courteous \"What ho!\"\n\nThere was a pause, during which I massaged the calves. Mine, of course, I\nmean.\n\n\"You got in, then?\" I said, in allusion to the change of costume.\n\n\"Oh, yes. About a quarter of an hour after you left Jeeves went searching\nabout and found the back-door key on the kitchen window-sill.\"\n\n\"Ha!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"I thought you said something.\"\n\n\"No, nothing.\"\n\nAnd I continued to do so. For at this juncture, as had so often happened\nwhen this girl and I were closeted, the conversation once more went blue\non us. The night breeze whispered, but not the Bassett. A bird twittered,\nbut not so much as a chirp escaped Bertram. It was perfectly amazing, the\nway her mere presence seemed to wipe speech from my lips--and mine, for\nthat matter, from hers. It began to look as if our married life together\nwould be rather like twenty years among the Trappist monks.\n\n\"Seen Jeeves anywhere?\" I asked, eventually coming through.\n\n\"Yes, in the dining-room.\"\n\n\"The dining-room?\"\n\n\"Waiting on everybody. They are having eggs and bacon and champagne....\nWhat did you say?\"\n\nI had said nothing--merely snorted. There was something about the thought\nof these people carelessly revelling at a time when, for all they knew, I\nwas probably being dragged about the countryside by goats or chewed by\nelephants, that struck home at me like a poisoned dart. It was the sort\nof thing you read about as having happened just before the French\nRevolution--the haughty nobles in their castles callously digging in and\nquaffing while the unfortunate blighters outside were suffering frightful\nprivations.\n\nThe voice of the Bassett cut in on these mordant reflections:\n\n\"Bertie.\"\n\n\"Hullo!\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"Hullo!\" I said again.\n\nNo response. Whole thing rather like one of those telephone conversations\nwhere you sit at your end of the wire saying: \"Hullo! Hullo!\" unaware\nthat the party of the second part has gone off to tea.\n\nEventually, however, she came to the surface again:\n\n\"Bertie, I have something to say to you.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I have something to say to you.\"\n\n\"I know. I said 'What?'\"\n\n\"Oh, I thought you didn't hear what I said.\"\n\n\"Yes, I heard what you said, all right, but not what you were going to\nsay.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see.\"\n\n\"Right-ho.\"\n\nSo that was straightened out. Nevertheless, instead of proceeding she\ntook time off once more. She stood twisting the fingers and scratching\nthe gravel with her foot. When finally she spoke, it was to deliver an\nimpressive boost:\n\n\"Bertie, do you read Tennyson?\"\n\n\"Not if I can help.\"\n\n\"You remind me so much of those Knights of the Round Table in the 'Idylls\nof the King'.\"\n\nOf course I had heard of them--Lancelot, Galahad and all that lot, but I\ndidn't see where the resemblance came in. It seemed to me that she must\nbe thinking of a couple of other fellows.\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"You have such a great heart, such a fine soul. You are so generous, so\nunselfish, so chivalrous. I have always felt that about you--that you are\none of the few really chivalrous men I have ever met.\"\n\nWell, dashed difficult, of course, to know what to say when someone is\ngiving you the old oil on a scale like that. I muttered an \"Oh, yes?\" or\nsomething on those lines, and rubbed the billowy portions in some\nembarrassment. And there was another silence, broken only by a sharp howl\nas I rubbed a bit too hard.\n\n\"Bertie.\"\n\n\"Hullo?\"\n\nI heard her give a sort of gulp.\n\n\"Bertie, will you be chivalrous now?\"\n\n\"Rather. Only too pleased. How do you mean?\"\n\n\"I am going to try you to the utmost. I am going to test you as few men\nhave ever been tested. I am going----\"\n\nI didn't like the sound of this.\n\n\"Well,\" I said doubtfully, \"always glad to oblige, you know, but I've\njust had the dickens of a bicycle ride, and I'm a bit stiff and sore,\nespecially in the--as I say, a bit stiff and sore. If it's anything to be\nfetched from upstairs----\"\n\n\"No, no, you don't understand.\"\n\n\"I don't, quite, no.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's so difficult.... How can I say it?... Can't you guess?\"\n\n\"No. I'm dashed if I can.\"\n\n\"Bertie--let me go!\"\n\n\"But I haven't got hold of you.\"\n\n\"Release me!\"\n\n\"Re----\"\n\nAnd then I suddenly got it. I suppose it was fatigue that had made me so\nslow to apprehend the nub.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nI staggered, and the left pedal came up and caught me on the shin. But\nsuch was the ecstasy in the soul that I didn't utter a cry.\n\n\"Release you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI didn't want any confusion on the point.\n\n\"You mean you want to call it all off? You're going to hitch up with\nGussie, after all?\"\n\n\"Only if you are fine and big enough to consent.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am.\"\n\n\"I gave you my promise.\"\n\n\"Dash promises.\"\n\n\"Then you really----\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\n\"Oh, Bertie!\"\n\nShe seemed to sway like a sapling. It is saplings that sway, I believe.\n\n\"A very parfait knight!\" I heard her murmur, and there not being much to\nsay after that, I excused myself on the ground that I had got about two\npecks of dust down my back and would like to go and get my maid to put me\ninto something loose.\n\n\"You go back to Gussie,\" I said, \"and tell him that all is well.\"\n\nShe gave a sort of hiccup and, darting forward, kissed me on the\nforehead. Unpleasant, of course, but, as Anatole would say, I can take a\nfew smooths with a rough. The next moment she was legging it for the\ndining-room, while I, having bunged the bicycle into a bush, made for the\nstairs.\n\nI need not dwell upon my buckedness. It can be readily imagined. Talk\nabout chaps with the noose round their necks and the hangman about to let\nher go and somebody galloping up on a foaming horse, waving the\nreprieve--not in it. Absolutely not in it at all. I don't know that I\ncan give you a better idea of the state of my feelings than by saying\nthat as I started to cross the hall I was conscious of so profound a\nbenevolence toward all created things that I found myself thinking kindly\nthoughts even of Jeeves.\n\nI was about to mount the stairs when a sudden \"What ho!\" from my rear\ncaused me to turn. Tuppy was standing in the hall. He had apparently been\ndown to the cellar for reinforcements, for there were a couple of bottles\nunder his arm.\n\n\"Hullo, Bertie,\" he said. \"You back?\" He laughed amusedly. \"You look like\nthe Wreck of the Hesperus. Get run over by a steam-roller or something?\"\n\nAt any other time I might have found his coarse badinage hard to bear.\nBut such was my uplifted mood that I waved it aside and slipped him the\ngood news.\n\n\"Tuppy, old man, the Bassett's going to marry Gussie Fink-Nottle.\"\n\n\"Tough luck on both of them, what?\"\n\n\"But don't you understand? Don't you see what this means? It means that\nAngela is once more out of pawn, and you have only to play your cards\nproperly----\"\n\nHe bellowed rollickingly. I saw now that he was in the pink. As a matter\nof fact, I had noticed something of the sort directly I met him, but had\nattributed it to alcoholic stimulant.\n\n\"Good Lord! You're right behind the times, Bertie. Only to be expected,\nof course, if you will go riding bicycles half the night. Angela and I\nmade it up hours ago.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Nothing but a passing tiff. All you need in these matters is\na little give and take, a bit of reasonableness on both sides. We got\ntogether and talked things over. She withdrew my double chin. I conceded\nher shark. Perfectly simple. All done in a couple of minutes.\"\n\n\"But----\"\n\n\"Sorry, Bertie. Can't stop chatting with you all night. There is a rather\nimpressive beano in progress in the dining-room, and they are waiting for\nsupplies.\"\n\nEndorsement was given to this statement by a sudden shout from the\napartment named. I recognized--as who would not--Aunt Dahlia's voice:\n\n\"Glossop!\"\n\n\"Hullo?\"\n\n\"Hurry up with that stuff.\"\n\n\"Coming, coming.\"\n\n\"Well, come, then. Yoicks! Hard for-rard!\"\n\n\"Tallyho, not to mention tantivy. Your aunt,\" said Tuppy, \"is a bit above\nherself. I don't know all the facts of the case, but it appears that\nAnatole gave notice and has now consented to stay on, and also your uncle\nhas given her a cheque for that paper of hers. I didn't get the details,\nbut she is much braced. See you later. I must rush.\"\n\nTo say that Bertram was now definitely nonplussed would be but to state\nthe simple truth. I could make nothing of this. I had left Brinkley Court\na stricken home, with hearts bleeding wherever you looked, and I had\nreturned to find it a sort of earthly paradise. It baffled me.\n\nI bathed bewilderedly. The toy duck was still in the soap-dish, but I was\ntoo preoccupied to give it a thought. Still at a loss, I returned to my\nroom, and there was Jeeves. And it is proof of my fogged condish that my\nfirst words to him were words not of reproach and stern recrimination but\nof inquiry:\n\n\"I say, Jeeves!\"\n\n\"Good evening, sir. I was informed that you had returned. I trust you had\nan enjoyable ride.\"\n\nAt any other moment, a crack like that would have woken the fiend in\nBertram Wooster. I barely noticed it. I was intent on getting to the\nbottom of this mystery.\n\n\"But I say, Jeeves, what?\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"What does all this mean?\"\n\n\"You refer, sir----\"\n\n\"Of course I refer. You know what I'm talking about. What has been\nhappening here since I left? The place is positively stiff with happy\nendings.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I am glad to say that my efforts have been rewarded.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, your efforts? You aren't going to try to make out that\nthat rotten fire bell scheme of yours had anything to do with it?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Don't be an ass, Jeeves. It flopped.\"\n\n\"Not altogether, sir. I fear, sir, that I was not entirely frank with\nregard to my suggestion of ringing the fire bell. I had not really\nanticipated that it would in itself produce the desired results. I had\nintended it merely as a preliminary to what I might describe as the real\nbusiness of the evening.\"\n\n\"You gibber, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"No, sir. It was essential that the ladies and gentlemen should be\nbrought from the house, in order that, once out of doors, I could ensure\nthat they remained there for the necessary period of time.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"My plan was based on psychology, sir.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"It is a recognized fact, sir, that there is nothing that so\nsatisfactorily unites individuals who have been so unfortunate as to\nquarrel amongst themselves as a strong mutual dislike for some definite\nperson. In my own family, if I may give a homely illustration, it was a\ngenerally accepted axiom that in times of domestic disagreement it was\nnecessary only to invite my Aunt Annie for a visit to heal all breaches\nbetween the other members of the household. In the mutual animosity\nexcited by Aunt Annie, those who had become estranged were reconciled\nalmost immediately. Remembering this, it occurred to me that were you,\nsir, to be established as the person responsible for the ladies and\ngentlemen being forced to spend the night in the garden, everybody would\ntake so strong a dislike to you that in this common sympathy they would\nsooner or later come together.\"\n\nI would have spoken, but he continued:\n\n\"And such proved to be the case. All, as you see, sir, is now well. After\nyour departure on the bicycle, the various estranged parties agreed so\nheartily in their abuse of you that the ice, if I may use the expression,\nwas broken, and it was not long before Mr. Glossop was walking beneath\nthe trees with Miss Angela, telling her anecdotes of your career at the\nuniversity in exchange for hers regarding your childhood; while Mr.\nFink-Nottle, leaning against the sundial, held Miss Bassett enthralled\nwith stories of your schooldays. Mrs. Travers, meanwhile, was telling\nMonsieur Anatole----\"\n\nI found speech.\n\n\"Oh?\" I said. \"I see. And now, I suppose, as the result of this dashed\npsychology of yours, Aunt Dahlia is so sore with me that it will be years\nbefore I can dare to show my face here again--years, Jeeves, during\nwhich, night after night, Anatole will be cooking those dinners of\nhis----\"\n\n\"No, sir. It was to prevent any such contingency that I suggested that\nyou should bicycle to Kingham Manor. When I informed the ladies and\ngentlemen that I had found the key, and it was borne in upon them that\nyou were having that long ride for nothing, their animosity vanished\nimmediately, to be replaced by cordial amusement. There was much\nlaughter.\"\n\n\"There was, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I fear you may possibly have to submit to a certain amount of\ngood-natured chaff, but nothing more. All, if I may say so, is forgiven,\nsir.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nI mused awhile.\n\n\"You certainly seem to have fixed things.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Tuppy and Angela are once more betrothed. Also Gussie and the Bassett;\nUncle Tom appears to have coughed up that money for _Milady's Boudoir_.\nAnd Anatole is staying on.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I suppose you might say that all's well that ends well.\"\n\n\"Very apt, sir.\"\n\nI mused again.\n\n\"All the same, your methods are a bit rough, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"One cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs, sir.\"\n\nI started.\n\n\"Omelette! Do you think you could get me one?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir.\"\n\n\"Together with half a bot. of something?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly, sir.\"\n\n\"Do so, Jeeves, and with all speed.\"\n\nI climbed into bed and sank back against the pillows. I must say that my\ngenerous wrath had ebbed a bit. I was aching the whole length of my body,\nparticularly toward the middle, but against this you had to set the fact\nthat I was no longer engaged to Madeline Bassett. In a good cause one is\nprepared to suffer. Yes, looking at the thing from every angle, I saw\nthat Jeeves had done well, and it was with an approving beam that I\nwelcomed him as he returned with the needful.\n\nHe did not check up with this beam. A bit grave, he seemed to me to be\nlooking, and I probed the matter with a kindly query:\n\n\"Something on your mind, Jeeves?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I should have mentioned it earlier, but in the evening's\ndisturbance it escaped my memory, I fear I have been remiss, sir.\"\n\n\"Yes, Jeeves?\" I said, champing contentedly.\n\n\"In the matter of your mess-jacket, sir.\"\n\nA nameless fear shot through me, causing me to swallow a mouthful of\nomelette the wrong way.\n\n\"I am sorry to say, sir, that while I was ironing it this afternoon I was\ncareless enough to leave the hot instrument upon it. I very much fear\nthat it will be impossible for you to wear it again, sir.\"\n\nOne of those old pregnant silences filled the room.\n\n\"I am extremely sorry, sir.\"\n\nFor a moment, I confess, that generous wrath of mine came bounding back,\nhitching up its muscles and snorting a bit through the nose, but, as we\nsay on the Riviera, _\u00c3\u00a0 quoi sert-il_? There was nothing to be gained by\ng.w. now.\n\nWe Woosters can bite the bullet. I nodded moodily and speared another\nslab of omelette.\n\n\"Right ho, Jeeves.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Right Ho, Jeeves, by P. G.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":355,"split":"train"}
