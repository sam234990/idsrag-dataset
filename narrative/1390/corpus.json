{"ori_id":"d67891bcff4768f4de2137adf792dbeb1c299b69","title":"The Sea-Wolf","context":"The Sea-Wolf\n Like The Call of the Wild, The Sea Wolf tells the story of a soft, domesticated protagonist, in this novel's case an intellectual man named Humphrey van Weyden, forced to become tough and self-reliant by exposure to cruelty and brutality. The story starts with him aboard a San Francisco ferry, called Martinez, which collides with another ship in the fog and sinks. He is set adrift in the Bay, eventually being picked up by Wolf Larsen. Larsen is the captain of a seal-hunting schooner, the Ghost. Brutal and cynical, yet also highly intelligent and intellectual (though highly biased in his opinions, as he was self-taught), he rules over his ship and terrorizes the crew with the aid of his exceptionally great physical strength. Van Weyden adequately describes him as an individualist, hedonist, and materialist. Larsen does not believe in the immortality of the soul, he finds no meaning in his life save for survival and pleasure and has come to despise all human life and deny its value. Being interested in someone capable of intellectual disputes, he somewhat takes care of Van Weyden, whom he calls 'Hump', while forcing him to become a cabin boy, do menial work, and learn to fight to protect himself from a brutal crew.\nA key event in the story is an attempted mutiny against Wolf Larsen by several members of the crew. The organizers of the mutiny are Leach and Johnson. Johnson had previously been beaten severely by Larsen, and Leach had been punched earlier while being forced to become a boat-puller, motivating the two. The first attempt is by sending Larsen overboard; however, he manages to climb back onto the ship. Searching for his assailant, he ventures into the sleeping quarters, located beneath the main deck, the only exit being a ladder. Several, at least seven men, take part in the mutiny and attack Larsen. Larsen however, demonstrating his inhuman endurance, strength, and conviction, manages to fight his way through the crew, climb the ladder with several men hanging off him, and escape relatively unharmed. Van Weyden is promoted as mate, for the original mate had been murdered. Larsen later gets his vengeance by torturing his crew, and constantly claiming that he is going to murder Leach and Johnson at his earliest convenience, being the hunting season is done, as he can't afford to lose any crew. He later allows them to be lost to the sea when they attempt to flee on a hunting boat.\nDuring this section, the Ghost picks up another set of castaways, including a poet named Maud Brewster. Miss Brewster and van Weyden had known each other previously\u00e2\u0080\u0094but only as writers. Both Wolf Larsen and van Weyden immediately feel attraction to her, due to her intelligence and \"female delicacy\". Van Weyden sees her as his first true love. He strives to protect her from the crew, the horrors of the sea, and Wolf Larsen. As this happens, Wolf Larsen meets his brother Death Larsen, a bitter opponent of his. Wolf kidnapped several of Death's crew and forced them into servitude to fill his own ranks, lost previously during a storm. During one of Wolf Larsen's intense headaches, which render him near immobile, van Weyden steals a boat and flees with Miss Brewster.\nThe two eventually land on an uninhabited island, heavily populated with seals. They hunt, build shelter and a fire, and survive for several days, using the strength they gained while on the Ghost. The Ghost eventually crashes on the island, with Wolf Larsen the only crew member. As a revenge, Death Larsen had tracked his brother, bribed his crew, destroyed his sails, and set Larsen adrift at sea. It is purely by chance that van Weyden and Miss Brewster meet Larsen again.\nVan Weyden obtains all of the weapons including firearms left on the ship, but he cannot bear to murder Larsen, who does not threaten him. Van Weyden and Miss Brewster decide they can repair the ship, but Larsen, who intends to die on the island and take them with him, sabotages any repairs they make. After a headache, Larsen is rendered blind. He feigns paralysis and attempts to murder van Weyden when he draws within arm's reach but just then is hit with a stroke that leaves him blind and the right side of his body paralyzed. His condition only worsens; he loses usage of his remaining arm, leg, and voice. Miss Brewster and van Weyden, unable to bring themselves to leave him to rot, care for him. Despite this kindness, he continues his resistance, setting fire to the bunk's mattress above him.\nVan Weyden finishes repairing the Ghost, and he and Miss Brewster set sail. During a violent storm, Wolf Larsen dies. They give Larsen a burial at sea, an act mirroring an incident van Weyden witnessed when he was first rescued. The story ends with the two being rescued by an American revenue cutter.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The Sea-Wolf, by Jack London\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

He kept a summer cottage\nin Mill Valley, under the shadow of Mount Tamalpais, and never occupied\nit except when he loafed through the winter months and read Nietzsche and\nSchopenhauer to rest his brain.  When summer came on, he elected to sweat\nout a hot and dusty existence in the city and to toil incessantly.  Had\nit not been my custom to run up to see him every Saturday afternoon and\nto stop over till Monday morning, this particular January Monday morning\nwould not have found me afloat on San Francisco Bay.\n\nNot but that I was afloat in a safe craft, for the _Martinez_ was a new\nferry-steamer, making her fourth or fifth trip on the run between\nSausalito and San Francisco.  The danger lay in the heavy fog which\nblanketed the bay, and of which, as a landsman, I had little\napprehension.  In fact, I remember the placid exaltation with which I\ntook up my position on the forward upper deck, directly beneath the\npilot-house, and allowed the mystery of the fog to lay hold of my\nimagination.  A fresh breeze was blowing, and for a time I was alone in\nthe moist obscurity\u00e2\u0080\u0094yet not alone, for I was dimly conscious of the\npresence of the pilot, and of what I took to be the captain, in the glass\nhouse above my head.\n\nI remember thinking how comfortable it was, this division of labour which\nmade it unnecessary for me to study fogs, winds, tides, and navigation,\nin order to visit my friend who lived across an arm of the sea.  It was\ngood that men should be specialists, I mused.  The peculiar knowledge of\nthe pilot and captain sufficed for many thousands of people who knew no\nmore of the sea and navigation than I knew.  On the other hand, instead\nof having to devote my energy to the learning of a multitude of things, I\nconcentrated it upon a few particular things, such as, for instance, the\nanalysis of Poe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s place in American literature\u00e2\u0080\u0094an essay of mine, by the\nway, in the current _Atlantic_.  Coming aboard, as I passed through the\ncabin, I had noticed with greedy eyes a stout gentleman reading the\n_Atlantic_, which was open at my very essay.  And there it was again, the\ndivision of labour, the special knowledge of the pilot and captain which\npermitted the stout gentleman to read my special knowledge on Poe while\nthey carried him safely from Sausalito to San Francisco.\n\nA red-faced man, slamming the cabin door behind him and stumping out on\nthe deck, interrupted my reflections, though I made a mental note of the\ntopic for use in a projected essay which I had thought of calling \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\nNecessity for Freedom: A Plea for the Artist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  The red-faced man shot a\nglance up at the pilot-house, gazed around at the fog, stumped across the\ndeck and back (he evidently had artificial legs), and stood still by my\nside, legs wide apart, and with an expression of keen enjoyment on his\nface.  I was not wrong when I decided that his days had been spent on the\nsea.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nasty weather like this here that turns heads grey before their\ntime,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, with a nod toward the pilot-house.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI had not thought there was any particular strain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\nseems as simple as A, B, C.  They know the direction by compass, the\ndistance, and the speed.  I should not call it anything more than\nmathematical certainty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStrain!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he snorted.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSimple as A, B, C!  Mathematical certainty!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe seemed to brace himself up and lean backward against the air as he\nstared at me.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow about this here tide that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rushin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 out through the\nGolden Gate?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he demanded, or bellowed, rather.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow fast is she ebbin\u00e2\u0080\u0099?\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the drift, eh?  Listen to that, will you?  A bell-buoy, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\na-top of it!  See \u00e2\u0080\u0099em alterin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the course!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFrom out of the fog came the mournful tolling of a bell, and I could see\nthe pilot turning the wheel with great rapidity.  The bell, which had\nseemed straight ahead, was now sounding from the side.  Our own whistle\nwas blowing hoarsely, and from time to time the sound of other whistles\ncame to us from out of the fog.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a ferry-boat of some sort,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the new-comer said, indicating a\nwhistle off to the right.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd there!  D\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye hear that?  Blown by mouth.\nSome scow schooner, most likely.  Better watch out, Mr. Schooner-man.\nAh, I thought so.  Now hell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a poppin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for somebody!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe unseen ferry-boat was blowing blast after blast, and the mouth-blown\nhorn was tooting in terror-stricken fashion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re payin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 their respects to each other and tryin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to get\nclear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the red-faced man went on, as the hurried whistling ceased.\n\nHis face was shining, his eyes flashing with excitement as he translated\ninto articulate language the speech of the horns and sirens.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\nsteam-siren a-goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 it over there to the left.  And you hear that fellow\nwith a frog in his throat\u00e2\u0080\u0094a steam schooner as near as I can judge,\ncrawlin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in from the Heads against the tide.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA shrill little whistle, piping as if gone mad, came from directly ahead\nand from very near at hand.  Gongs sounded on the _Martinez_.  Our\npaddle-wheels stopped, their pulsing beat died away, and then they\nstarted again.  The shrill little whistle, like the chirping of a cricket\namid the cries of great beasts, shot through the fog from more to the\nside and swiftly grew faint and fainter.  I looked to my companion for\nenlightenment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne of them dare-devil launches,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI almost wish we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d sunk\nhim, the little rip!  They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the cause of more trouble.  And what good\nare they?  Any jackass gets aboard one and runs it from hell to\nbreakfast, blowin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 his whistle to beat the band and tellin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the rest of\nthe world to look out for him, because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look out for\nhimself!  Because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comin\u00e2\u0080\u0099!  And you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to look out, too!  Right\nof way!  Common decency!  They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know the meanin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI felt quite amused at his unwarranted choler, and while he stumped\nindignantly up and down I fell to dwelling upon the romance of the fog.\nAnd romantic it certainly was\u00e2\u0080\u0094the fog, like the grey shadow of infinite\nmystery, brooding over the whirling speck of earth; and men, mere motes\nof light and sparkle, cursed with an insane relish for work, riding their\nsteeds of wood and steel through the heart of the mystery, groping their\nway blindly through the Unseen, and clamouring and clanging in confident\nspeech the while their hearts are heavy with incertitude and fear.\n\nThe voice of my companion brought me back to myself with a laugh.  I too\nhad been groping and floundering, the while I thought I rode clear-eyed\nthrough the mystery.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHello! somebody comin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 our way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he was saying.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye hear that?\nHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fast.  Walking right along.  Guess he don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear us yet.\nWind\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in wrong direction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe fresh breeze was blowing right down upon us, and I could hear the\nwhistle plainly, off to one side and a little ahead.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFerry-boat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\nHe nodded, then added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOr he wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be keepin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 up such a clip.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  He\ngave a short chuckle.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gettin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 anxious up there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI glanced up.  The captain had thrust his head and shoulders out of the\npilot-house, and was staring intently into the fog as though by sheer\nforce of will he could penetrate it.  His face was anxious, as was the\nface of my companion, who had stumped over to the rail and was gazing\nwith a like intentness in the direction of the invisible danger.\n\nThen everything happened, and with inconceivable rapidity.  The fog\nseemed to break away as though split by a wedge, and the bow of a\nsteamboat emerged, trailing fog-wreaths on either side like seaweed on\nthe snout of Leviathan.  I could see the pilot-house and a white-bearded\nman leaning partly out of it, on his elbows.  He was clad in a blue\nuniform, and I remember noting how trim and quiet he was.  His quietness,\nunder the circumstances, was terrible.  He accepted Destiny, marched hand\nin hand with it, and coolly measured the stroke.  As he leaned there, he\nran a calm and speculative eye over us, as though to determine the\nprecise point of the collision, and took no notice whatever when our\npilot, white with rage, shouted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOn looking back, I realize that the remark was too obvious to make\nrejoinder necessary.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGrab hold of something and hang on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the red-faced man said to me.  All\nhis bluster had gone, and he seemed to have caught the contagion of\npreternatural calm.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd listen to the women scream,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said\ngrimly\u00e2\u0080\u0094almost bitterly, I thought, as though he had been through the\nexperience before.\n\nThe vessels came together before I could follow his advice.  We must have\nbeen struck squarely amidships, for I saw nothing, the strange steamboat\nhaving passed beyond my line of vision.  The _Martinez_ heeled over,\nsharply, and there was a crashing and rending of timber.  I was thrown\nflat on the wet deck, and before I could scramble to my feet I heard the\nscream of the women.  This it was, I am certain,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the most indescribable\nof blood-curdling sounds,\u00e2\u0080\u0094that threw me into a panic.  I remembered the\nlife-preservers stored in the cabin, but was met at the door and swept\nbackward by a wild rush of men and women.  What happened in the next few\nminutes I do not recollect, though I have a clear remembrance of pulling\ndown life-preservers from the overhead racks, while the red-faced man\nfastened them about the bodies of an hysterical group of women.  This\nmemory is as distinct and sharp as that of any picture I have seen.  It\nis a picture, and I can see it now,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the jagged edges of the hole in the\nside of the cabin, through which the grey fog swirled and eddied; the\nempty upholstered seats, littered with all the evidences of sudden\nflight, such as packages, hand satchels, umbrellas, and wraps; the stout\ngentleman who had been reading my essay, encased in cork and canvas, the\nmagazine still in his hand, and asking me with monotonous insistence if I\nthought there was any danger; the red-faced man, stumping gallantly\naround on his artificial legs and buckling life-preservers on all comers;\nand finally, the screaming bedlam of women.\n\nThis it was, the screaming of the women, that most tried my nerves.  It\nmust have tried, too, the nerves of the red-faced man, for I have another\npicture which will never fade from my mind.  The stout gentleman is\nstuffing the magazine into his overcoat pocket and looking on curiously.\nA tangled mass of women, with drawn, white faces and open mouths, is\nshrieking like a chorus of lost souls; and the red-faced man, his face\nnow purplish with wrath, and with arms extended overhead as in the act of\nhurling thunderbolts, is shouting, \u00e2\u0080\u009cShut up!  Oh, shut up!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI remember the scene impelled me to sudden laughter, and in the next\ninstant I realized I was becoming hysterical myself; for these were women\nof my own kind, like my mother and sisters, with the fear of death upon\nthem and unwilling to die.  And I remember that the sounds they made\nreminded me of the squealing of pigs under the knife of the butcher, and\nI was struck with horror at the vividness of the analogy.  These women,\ncapable of the most sublime emotions, of the tenderest sympathies, were\nopen-mouthed and screaming.  They wanted to live, they were helpless,\nlike rats in a trap, and they screamed.\n\nThe horror of it drove me out on deck.  I was feeling sick and squeamish,\nand sat down on a bench.  In a hazy way I saw and heard men rushing and\nshouting as they strove to lower the boats.  It was just as I had read\ndescriptions of such scenes in books.  The tackles jammed.  Nothing\nworked.  One boat lowered away with the plugs out, filled with women and\nchildren and then with water, and capsized.  Another boat had been\nlowered by one end, and still hung in the tackle by the other end, where\nit had been abandoned.  Nothing was to be seen of the strange steamboat\nwhich had caused the disaster, though I heard men saying that she would\nundoubtedly send boats to our assistance.\n\nI descended to the lower deck.  The _Martinez_ was sinking fast, for the\nwater was very near.  Numbers of the passengers were leaping overboard.\nOthers, in the water, were clamouring to be taken aboard again.  No one\nheeded them.  A cry arose that we were sinking.  I was seized by the\nconsequent panic, and went over the side in a surge of bodies.  How I\nwent over I do not know, though I did know, and instantly, why those in\nthe water were so desirous of getting back on the steamer.  The water was\ncold\u00e2\u0080\u0094so cold that it was painful.  The pang, as I plunged into it, was as\nquick and sharp as that of fire.  It bit to the marrow.  It was like the\ngrip of death.  I gasped with the anguish and shock of it, filling my\nlungs before the life-preserver popped me to the surface.  The taste of\nthe salt was strong in my mouth, and I was strangling with the acrid\nstuff in my throat and lungs.\n\nBut it was the cold that was most distressing.  I felt that I could\nsurvive but a few minutes.  People were struggling and floundering in the\nwater about me.  I could hear them crying out to one another.  And I\nheard, also, the sound of oars.  Evidently the strange steamboat had\nlowered its boats.  As the time went by I marvelled that I was still\nalive.  I had no sensation whatever in my lower limbs, while a chilling\nnumbness was wrapping about my heart and creeping into it.  Small waves,\nwith spiteful foaming crests, continually broke over me and into my\nmouth, sending me off into more strangling paroxysms.\n\nThe noises grew indistinct, though I heard a final and despairing chorus\nof screams in the distance, and knew that the _Martinez_ had gone down.\nLater,\u00e2\u0080\u0094how much later I have no knowledge,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I came to myself with a start\nof fear.  I was alone.  I could hear no calls or cries\u00e2\u0080\u0094only the sound of\nthe waves, made weirdly hollow and reverberant by the fog.  A panic in a\ncrowd, which partakes of a sort of community of interest, is not so\nterrible as a panic when one is by oneself; and such a panic I now\nsuffered.  Whither was I drifting?  The red-faced man had said that the\ntide was ebbing through the Golden Gate.  Was I, then, being carried out\nto sea?  And the life-preserver in which I floated?  Was it not liable to\ngo to pieces at any moment?  I had heard of such things being made of\npaper and hollow rushes which quickly became saturated and lost all\nbuoyancy.  And I could not swim a stroke.  And I was alone, floating,\napparently, in the midst of a grey primordial vastness.  I confess that a\nmadness seized me, that I shrieked aloud as the women had shrieked, and\nbeat the water with my numb hands.\n\nHow long this lasted I have no conception, for a blankness intervened, of\nwhich I remember no more than one remembers of troubled and painful\nsleep.  When I aroused, it was as after centuries of time; and I saw,\nalmost above me and emerging from the fog, the bow of a vessel, and three\ntriangular sails, each shrewdly lapping the other and filled with wind.\nWhere the bow cut the water there was a great foaming and gurgling, and I\nseemed directly in its path.  I tried to cry out, but was too exhausted.\nThe bow plunged down, just missing me and sending a swash of water clear\nover my head.  Then the long, black side of the vessel began slipping\npast, so near that I could have touched it with my hands.  I tried to\nreach it, in a mad resolve to claw into the wood with my nails, but my\narms were heavy and lifeless.  Again I strove to call out, but made no\nsound.\n\nThe stern of the vessel shot by, dropping, as it did so, into a hollow\nbetween the waves; and I caught a glimpse of a man standing at the wheel,\nand of another man who seemed to be doing little else than smoke a cigar.\nI saw the smoke issuing from his lips as he slowly turned his head and\nglanced out over the water in my direction.  It was a careless,\nunpremeditated glance, one of those haphazard things men do when they\nhave no immediate call to do anything in particular, but act because they\nare alive and must do something.\n\nBut life and death were in that glance.  I could see the vessel being\nswallowed up in the fog; I saw the back of the man at the wheel, and the\nhead of the other man turning, slowly turning, as his gaze struck the\nwater and casually lifted along it toward me.  His face wore an absent\nexpression, as of deep thought, and I became afraid that if his eyes did\nlight upon me he would nevertheless not see me.  But his eyes did light\nupon me, and looked squarely into mine; and he did see me, for he sprang\nto the wheel, thrusting the other man aside, and whirled it round and\nround, hand over hand, at the same time shouting orders of some sort.\nThe vessel seemed to go off at a tangent to its former course and leapt\nalmost instantly from view into the fog.\n\nI felt myself slipping into unconsciousness, and tried with all the power\nof my will to fight above the suffocating blankness and darkness that was\nrising around me.  A little later I heard the stroke of oars, growing\nnearer and nearer, and the calls of a man.  When he was very near I heard\nhim crying, in vexed fashion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy in hell don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you sing out?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  This\nmeant me, I thought, and then the blankness and darkness rose over me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nI seemed swinging in a mighty rhythm through orbit vastness.  Sparkling\npoints of light spluttered and shot past me.  They were stars, I knew,\nand flaring comets, that peopled my flight among the suns.  As I reached\nthe limit of my swing and prepared to rush back on the counter swing, a\ngreat gong struck and thundered.  For an immeasurable period, lapped in\nthe rippling of placid centuries, I enjoyed and pondered my tremendous\nflight.\n\nBut a change came over the face of the dream, for a dream I told myself\nit must be.  My rhythm grew shorter and shorter.  I was jerked from swing\nto counter swing with irritating haste.  I could scarcely catch my\nbreath, so fiercely was I impelled through the heavens.  The gong\nthundered more frequently and more furiously.  I grew to await it with a\nnameless dread.  Then it seemed as though I were being dragged over\nrasping sands, white and hot in the sun.  This gave place to a sense of\nintolerable anguish.  My skin was scorching in the torment of fire.  The\ngong clanged and knelled.  The sparkling points of light flashed past me\nin an interminable stream, as though the whole sidereal system were\ndropping into the void.  I gasped, caught my breath painfully, and opened\nmy eyes.  Two men were kneeling beside me, working over me.  My mighty\nrhythm was the lift and forward plunge of a ship on the sea.  The\nterrific gong was a frying-pan, hanging on the wall, that rattled and\nclattered with each leap of the ship.  The rasping, scorching sands were\na man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard hands chafing my naked chest.  I squirmed under the pain of\nit, and half lifted my head.  My chest was raw and red, and I could see\ntiny blood globules starting through the torn and inflamed cuticle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do, Yonson,\u00e2\u0080\u009d one of the men said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cCarn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yer see you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\nbloomin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 well rubbed all the gent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skin orf?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe man addressed as Yonson, a man of the heavy Scandinavian type, ceased\nchafing me, and arose awkwardly to his feet.  The man who had spoken to\nhim was clearly a Cockney, with the clean lines and weakly pretty, almost\neffeminate, face of the man who has absorbed the sound of Bow Bells with\nhis mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s milk.  A draggled muslin cap on his head and a dirty\ngunny-sack about his slim hips proclaimed him cook of the decidedly dirty\nship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s galley in which I found myself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAn\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0099ow yer feelin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 now, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked, with the subservient smirk\nwhich comes only of generations of tip-seeking ancestors.\n\nFor reply, I twisted weakly into a sitting posture, and was helped by\nYonson to my feet.  The rattle and bang of the frying-pan was grating\nhorribly on my nerves.  I could not collect my thoughts.  Clutching the\nwoodwork of the galley for support,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I confess the grease with which\nit was scummed put my teeth on edge,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I reached across a hot cooking-range\nto the offending utensil, unhooked it, and wedged it securely into the\ncoal-box.\n\nThe cook grinned at my exhibition of nerves, and thrust into my hand a\nsteaming mug with an \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Ere, this\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do yer good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  It was a nauseous\nmess,\u00e2\u0080\u0094ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coffee,\u00e2\u0080\u0094but the heat of it was revivifying.  Between gulps\nof the molten stuff I glanced down at my raw and bleeding chest and\nturned to the Scandinavian.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you, Mr. Yonson,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think your measures were\nrather heroic?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was because he understood the reproof of my action, rather than of my\nwords, that he held up his palm for inspection.  It was remarkably\ncalloused.  I passed my hand over the horny projections, and my teeth\nwent on edge once more from the horrible rasping sensation produced.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy name is Johnson, not Yonson,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, in very good, though slow,\nEnglish, with no more than a shade of accent to it.\n\nThere was mild protest in his pale blue eyes, and withal a timid\nfrankness and manliness that quite won me to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you, Mr. Johnson,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I corrected, and reached out my hand for his.\n\nHe hesitated, awkward and bashful, shifted his weight from one leg to the\nother, then blunderingly gripped my hand in a hearty shake.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you any dry clothes I may put on?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked the cook.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered, with cheerful alacrity.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll run down an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tyke\na look over my kit, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve no objections, sir, to wearin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 my things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe dived out of the galley door, or glided rather, with a swiftness and\nsmoothness of gait that struck me as being not so much cat-like as oily.\nIn fact, this oiliness, or greasiness, as I was later to learn, was\nprobably the most salient expression of his personality.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd where am I?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked Johnson, whom I took, and rightly, to be one of\nthe sailors.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat vessel is this, and where is she bound?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOff the Farallones, heading about sou-west,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered, slowly and\nmethodically, as though groping for his best English, and rigidly\nobserving the order of my queries.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe schooner _Ghost_, bound\nseal-hunting to Japan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd who is the captain?  I must see him as soon as I am dressed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJohnson looked puzzled and embarrassed.  He hesitated while he groped in\nhis vocabulary and framed a complete answer.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe cap\u00e2\u0080\u0099n is Wolf Larsen,\nor so men call him.  I never heard his other name.  But you better speak\nsoft with him.  He is mad this morning.  The mate\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut he did not finish.  The cook had glided in.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBetter sling yer \u00e2\u0080\u0099ook out of \u00e2\u0080\u0099ere, Yonson,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe old man\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be\nwantin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 yer on deck, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 this ayn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t no d\u00e2\u0080\u0099y to fall foul of \u00e2\u0080\u0099im.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJohnson turned obediently to the door, at the same time, over the cook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nshoulder, favouring me with an amazingly solemn and portentous wink as\nthough to emphasize his interrupted remark and the need for me to be\nsoft-spoken with the captain.\n\nHanging over the cook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm was a loose and crumpled array of\nevil-looking and sour-smelling garments.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey was put aw\u00e2\u0080\u0099y wet, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he vouchsafed explanation.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099ave to make them do till I dry yours out by the fire.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClinging to the woodwork, staggering with the roll of the ship, and aided\nby the cook, I managed to slip into a rough woollen undershirt.  On the\ninstant my flesh was creeping and crawling from the harsh contact.  He\nnoticed my involuntary twitching and grimacing, and smirked:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI only \u00e2\u0080\u0099ope yer don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ever \u00e2\u0080\u0099ave to get used to such as that in this\nlife, \u00e2\u0080\u0099cos you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a bloomin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 soft skin, that you \u00e2\u0080\u0099ave, more like a\nlydy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s than any I know of.  I was bloomin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 well sure you was a gentleman\nas soon as I set eyes on yer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI had taken a dislike to him at first, and as he helped to dress me this\ndislike increased.  There was something repulsive about his touch.  I\nshrank from his hand; my flesh revolted.  And between this and the smells\narising from various pots boiling and bubbling on the galley fire, I was\nin haste to get out into the fresh air.  Further, there was the need of\nseeing the captain about what arrangements could be made for getting me\nashore.\n\nA cheap cotton shirt, with frayed collar and a bosom discoloured with\nwhat I took to be ancient blood-stains, was put on me amid a running and\napologetic fire of comment.  A pair of workman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brogans encased my feet,\nand for trousers I was furnished with a pair of pale blue, washed-out\noveralls, one leg of which was fully ten inches shorter than the other.\nThe abbreviated leg looked as though the devil had there clutched for the\nCockney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soul and missed the shadow for the substance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd whom have I to thank for this kindness?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked, when I stood\ncompletely arrayed, a tiny boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cap on my head, and for coat a dirty,\nstriped cotton jacket which ended at the small of my back and the sleeves\nof which reached just below my elbows.\n\nThe cook drew himself up in a smugly humble fashion, a deprecating smirk\non his face.  Out of my experience with stewards on the Atlantic liners\nat the end of the voyage, I could have sworn he was waiting for his tip.\nFrom my fuller knowledge of the creature I now know that the posture was\nunconscious.  An hereditary servility, no doubt, was responsible.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMugridge, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he fawned, his effeminate features running into a greasy\nsmile.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThomas Mugridge, sir, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 at yer service.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right, Thomas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall not forget you\u00e2\u0080\u0094when my clothes are\ndry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA soft light suffused his face and his eyes glistened, as though\nsomewhere in the deeps of his being his ancestors had quickened and\nstirred with dim memories of tips received in former lives.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, very gratefully and very humbly indeed.\n\nPrecisely in the way that the door slid back, he slid aside, and I\nstepped out on deck.  I was still weak from my prolonged immersion.  A\npuff of wind caught me,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I staggered across the moving deck to a\ncorner of the cabin, to which I clung for support.  The schooner, heeled\nover far out from the perpendicular, was bowing and plunging into the\nlong Pacific roll.  If she were heading south-west as Johnson had said,\nthe wind, then, I calculated, was blowing nearly from the south.  The fog\nwas gone, and in its place the sun sparkled crisply on the surface of the\nwater, I turned to the east, where I knew California must lie, but could\nsee nothing save low-lying fog-banks\u00e2\u0080\u0094the same fog, doubtless, that had\nbrought about the disaster to the _Martinez_ and placed me in my present\nsituation.  To the north, and not far away, a group of naked rocks thrust\nabove the sea, on one of which I could distinguish a lighthouse.  In the\nsouth-west, and almost in our course, I saw the pyramidal loom of some\nvessel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sails.\n\nHaving completed my survey of the horizon, I turned to my more immediate\nsurroundings.  My first thought was that a man who had come through a\ncollision and rubbed shoulders with death merited more attention than I\nreceived.  Beyond a sailor at the wheel who stared curiously across the\ntop of the cabin, I attracted no notice whatever.\n\nEverybody seemed interested in what was going on amid ships.  There, on a\nhatch, a large man was lying on his back.  He was fully clothed, though\nhis shirt was ripped open in front.  Nothing was to be seen of his chest,\nhowever, for it was covered with a mass of black hair, in appearance like\nthe furry coat of a dog.  His face and neck were hidden beneath a black\nbeard, intershot with grey, which would have been stiff and bushy had it\nnot been limp and draggled and dripping with water.  His eyes were\nclosed, and he was apparently unconscious; but his mouth was wide open,\nhis breast, heaving as though from suffocation as he laboured noisily for\nbreath.  A sailor, from time to time and quite methodically, as a matter\nof routine, dropped a canvas bucket into the ocean at the end of a rope,\nhauled it in hand under hand, and sluiced its contents over the prostrate\nman.\n\nPacing back and forth the length of the hatchways and savagely chewing\nthe end of a cigar, was the man whose casual glance had rescued me from\nthe sea.  His height was probably five feet ten inches, or ten and a\nhalf; but my first impression, or feel of the man, was not of this, but\nof his strength.  And yet, while he was of massive build, with broad\nshoulders and deep chest, I could not characterize his strength as\nmassive.  It was what might be termed a sinewy, knotty strength, of the\nkind we ascribe to lean and wiry men, but which, in him, because of his\nheavy build, partook more of the enlarged gorilla order.  Not that in\nappearance he seemed in the least gorilla-like.  What I am striving to\nexpress is this strength itself, more as a thing apart from his physical\nsemblance.  It was a strength we are wont to associate with things\nprimitive, with wild animals, and the creatures we imagine our\ntree-dwelling prototypes to have been\u00e2\u0080\u0094a strength savage, ferocious, alive\nin itself, the essence of life in that it is the potency of motion, the\nelemental stuff itself out of which the many forms of life have been\nmoulded; in short, that which writhes in the body of a snake when the\nhead is cut off, and the snake, as a snake, is dead, or which lingers in\nthe shapeless lump of turtle-meat and recoils and quivers from the prod\nof a finger.\n\nSuch was the impression of strength I gathered from this man who paced up\nand down.  He was firmly planted on his legs; his feet struck the deck\nsquarely and with surety; every movement of a muscle, from the heave of\nthe shoulders to the tightening of the lips about the cigar, was\ndecisive, and seemed to come out of a strength that was excessive and\noverwhelming.  In fact, though this strength pervaded every action of\nhis, it seemed but the advertisement of a greater strength that lurked\nwithin, that lay dormant and no more than stirred from time to time, but\nwhich might arouse, at any moment, terrible and compelling, like the rage\nof a lion or the wrath of a storm.\n\nThe cook stuck his head out of the galley door and grinned encouragingly\nat me, at the same time jerking his thumb in the direction of the man who\npaced up and down by the hatchway.  Thus I was given to understand that\nhe was the captain, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cOld Man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the cook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vernacular, the\nindividual whom I must interview and put to the trouble of somehow\ngetting me ashore.  I had half started forward, to get over with what I\nwas certain would be a stormy five minutes, when a more violent\nsuffocating paroxysm seized the unfortunate person who was lying on his\nback.  He wrenched and writhed about convulsively.  The chin, with the\ndamp black beard, pointed higher in the air as the back muscles stiffened\nand the chest swelled in an unconscious and instinctive effort to get\nmore air.  Under the whiskers, and all unseen, I knew that the skin was\ntaking on a purplish hue.\n\nThe captain, or Wolf Larsen, as men called him, ceased pacing and gazed\ndown at the dying man.  So fierce had this final struggle become that the\nsailor paused in the act of flinging more water over him and stared\ncuriously, the canvas bucket partly tilted and dripping its contents to\nthe deck.  The dying man beat a tattoo on the hatch with his heels,\nstraightened out his legs, and stiffened in one great tense effort, and\nrolled his head from side to side.  Then the muscles relaxed, the head\nstopped rolling, and a sigh, as of profound relief, floated upward from\nhis lips.  The jaw dropped, the upper lip lifted, and two rows of\ntobacco-discoloured teeth appeared.  It seemed as though his features had\nfrozen into a diabolical grin at the world he had left and outwitted.\n\nThen a most surprising thing occurred.  The captain broke loose upon the\ndead man like a thunderclap.  Oaths rolled from his lips in a continuous\nstream.  And they were not namby-pamby oaths, or mere expressions of\nindecency.  Each word was a blasphemy, and there were many words.  They\ncrisped and crackled like electric sparks.  I had never heard anything\nlike it in my life, nor could I have conceived it possible.  With a turn\nfor literary expression myself, and a penchant for forcible figures and\nphrases, I appreciated, as no other listener, I dare say, the peculiar\nvividness and strength and absolute blasphemy of his metaphors.  The\ncause of it all, as near as I could make out, was that the man, who was\nmate, had gone on a debauch before leaving San Francisco, and then had\nthe poor taste to die at the beginning of the voyage and leave Wolf\nLarsen short-handed.\n\nIt should be unnecessary to state, at least to my friends, that I was\nshocked.  Oaths and vile language of any sort had always been repellent\nto me.  I felt a wilting sensation, a sinking at the heart, and, I might\njust as well say, a giddiness.  To me, death had always been invested\nwith solemnity and dignity.  It had been peaceful in its occurrence,\nsacred in its ceremonial.  But death in its more sordid and terrible\naspects was a thing with which I had been unacquainted till now.  As I\nsay, while I appreciated the power of the terrific denunciation that\nswept out of Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth, I was inexpressibly shocked.  The\nscorching torrent was enough to wither the face of the corpse.  I should\nnot have been surprised if the wet black beard had frizzled and curled\nand flared up in smoke and flame.  But the dead man was unconcerned.  He\ncontinued to grin with a sardonic humour, with a cynical mockery and\ndefiance.  He was master of the situation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nWolf Larsen ceased swearing as suddenly as he had begun.  He relighted\nhis cigar and glanced around.  His eyes chanced upon the cook.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Cooky?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he began, with a suaveness that was cold and of the temper\nof steel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the cook eagerly interpolated, with appeasing and apologetic\nservility.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve stretched that neck of yours just about enough?\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unhealthy, you know.  The mate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone, so I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford to lose you\ntoo.  You must be very, very careful of your health, Cooky.  Understand?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis last word, in striking contrast with the smoothness of his previous\nutterance, snapped like the lash of a whip.  The cook quailed under it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the meek reply, as the offending head disappeared into\nthe galley.\n\nAt this sweeping rebuke, which the cook had only pointed, the rest of the\ncrew became uninterested and fell to work at one task or another.  A\nnumber of men, however, who were lounging about a companion-way between\nthe galley and hatch, and who did not seem to be sailors, continued\ntalking in low tones with one another.  These, I afterward learned, were\nthe hunters, the men who shot the seals, and a very superior breed to\ncommon sailor-folk.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJohansen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen called out.  A sailor stepped forward obediently.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGet your palm and needle and sew the beggar up.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find some old\ncanvas in the sail-locker.  Make it do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll I put on his feet, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the man asked, after the customary \u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\nay, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see to that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen answered, and elevated his voice in a\ncall of \u00e2\u0080\u009cCooky!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThomas Mugridge popped out of his galley like a jack-in-the-box.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo below and fill a sack with coal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAny of you fellows got a Bible or Prayer-book?\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the captain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next\ndemand, this time of the hunters lounging about the companion-way.\n\nThey shook their heads, and some one made a jocular remark which I did\nnot catch, but which raised a general laugh.\n\nWolf Larsen made the same demand of the sailors.  Bibles and Prayer-books\nseemed scarce articles, but one of the men volunteered to pursue the\nquest amongst the watch below, returning in a minute with the information\nthat there was none.\n\nThe captain shrugged his shoulders.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll drop him over without\nany palavering, unless our clerical-looking castaway has the burial\nservice at sea by heart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBy this time he had swung fully around and was facing me.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a\npreacher, aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\nThe hunters,\u00e2\u0080\u0094there were six of them,\u00e2\u0080\u0094to a man, turned and regarded me.  I\nwas painfully aware of my likeness to a scarecrow.  A laugh went up at my\nappearance,\u00e2\u0080\u0094a laugh that was not lessened or softened by the dead man\nstretched and grinning on the deck before us; a laugh that was as rough\nand harsh and frank as the sea itself; that arose out of coarse feelings\nand blunted sensibilities, from natures that knew neither courtesy nor\ngentleness.\n\nWolf Larsen did not laugh, though his grey eyes lighted with a slight\nglint of amusement; and in that moment, having stepped forward quite\nclose to him, I received my first impression of the man himself, of the\nman as apart from his body, and from the torrent of blasphemy I had heard\nhim spew forth.  The face, with large features and strong lines, of the\nsquare order, yet well filled out, was apparently massive at first sight;\nbut again, as with the body, the massiveness seemed to vanish, and a\nconviction to grow of a tremendous and excessive mental or spiritual\nstrength that lay behind, sleeping in the deeps of his being.  The jaw,\nthe chin, the brow rising to a goodly height and swelling heavily above\nthe eyes,\u00e2\u0080\u0094these, while strong in themselves, unusually strong, seemed to\nspeak an immense vigour or virility of spirit that lay behind and beyond\nand out of sight.  There was no sounding such a spirit, no measuring, no\ndetermining of metes and bounds, nor neatly classifying in some\npigeon-hole with others of similar type.\n\nThe eyes\u00e2\u0080\u0094and it was my destiny to know them well\u00e2\u0080\u0094were large and handsome,\nwide apart as the true artist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s are wide, sheltering under a heavy brow\nand arched over by thick black eyebrows.  The eyes themselves were of\nthat baffling protean grey which is never twice the same; which runs\nthrough many shades and colourings like intershot silk in sunshine; which\nis grey, dark and light, and greenish-grey, and sometimes of the clear\nazure of the deep sea.  They were eyes that masked the soul with a\nthousand guises, and that sometimes opened, at rare moments, and allowed\nit to rush up as though it were about to fare forth nakedly into the\nworld on some wonderful adventure,\u00e2\u0080\u0094eyes that could brood with the\nhopeless sombreness of leaden skies; that could snap and crackle points\nof fire like those which sparkle from a whirling sword; that could grow\nchill as an arctic landscape, and yet again, that could warm and soften\nand be all a-dance with love-lights, intense and masculine, luring and\ncompelling, which at the same time fascinate and dominate women till they\nsurrender in a gladness of joy and of relief and sacrifice.\n\nBut to return.  I told him that, unhappily for the burial service, I was\nnot a preacher, when he sharply demanded:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you do for a living?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI confess I had never had such a question asked me before, nor had I ever\ncanvassed it.  I was quite taken aback, and before I could find myself\nhad sillily stammered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0094I am a gentleman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis lip curled in a swift sneer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have worked, I do work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried impetuously, as though he were my\njudge and I required vindication, and at the same time very much aware of\nmy arrant idiocy in discussing the subject at all.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor your living?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was something so imperative and masterful about him that I was\nquite beside myself\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009crattled,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as Furuseth would have termed it, like a\nquaking child before a stern school-master.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho feeds you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d was his next question.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have an income,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered stoutly, and could have bitten my tongue\nthe next instant.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll of which, you will pardon my observing, has\nnothing whatsoever to do with what I wish to see you about.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut he disregarded my protest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho earned it?  Eh?  I thought so.  Your father.  You stand on dead\nmen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never had any of your own.  You couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t walk alone\nbetween two sunrises and hustle the meat for your belly for three meals.\nLet me see your hand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis tremendous, dormant strength must have stirred, swiftly and\naccurately, or I must have slept a moment, for before I knew it he had\nstepped two paces forward, gripped my right hand in his, and held it up\nfor inspection.  I tried to withdraw it, but his fingers tightened,\nwithout visible effort, till I thought mine would be crushed.  It is hard\nto maintain one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dignity under such circumstances.  I could not squirm\nor struggle like a schoolboy.  Nor could I attack such a creature who had\nbut to twist my arm to break it.  Nothing remained but to stand still and\naccept the indignity.  I had time to notice that the pockets of the dead\nman had been emptied on the deck, and that his body and his grin had been\nwrapped from view in canvas, the folds of which the sailor, Johansen, was\nsewing together with coarse white twine, shoving the needle through with\na leather contrivance fitted on the palm of his hand.\n\nWolf Larsen dropped my hand with a flirt of disdain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDead men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands have kept it soft.  Good for little else than\ndish-washing and scullion work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish to be put ashore,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said firmly, for I now had myself in\ncontrol.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall pay you whatever you judge your delay and trouble to\nbe worth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe looked at me curiously.  Mockery shone in his eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a counter proposition to make, and for the good of your soul.  My\nmate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be a lot of promotion.  A sailor comes aft to\ntake mate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s place, cabin-boy goes for\u00e2\u0080\u0099ard to take sailor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s place, and you\ntake the cabin-boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s place, sign the articles for the cruise, twenty\ndollars per month and found.  Now what do you say?  And mind you, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfor your own soul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake.  It will be the making of you.  You might learn\nin time to stand on your own legs, and perhaps to toddle along a bit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut I took no notice.  The sails of the vessel I had seen off to the\nsouth-west had grown larger and plainer.  They were of the same\nschooner-rig as the _Ghost_, though the hull itself, I could see, was\nsmaller.  She was a pretty sight, leaping and flying toward us, and\nevidently bound to pass at close range.  The wind had been momentarily\nincreasing, and the sun, after a few angry gleams, had disappeared.  The\nsea had turned a dull leaden grey and grown rougher, and was now tossing\nfoaming whitecaps to the sky.  We were travelling faster, and heeled\nfarther over.  Once, in a gust, the rail dipped under the sea, and the\ndecks on that side were for the moment awash with water that made a\ncouple of the hunters hastily lift their feet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat vessel will soon be passing us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, after a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pause.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs she is going in the opposite direction, she is very probably bound\nfor San Francisco.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery probably,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s answer, as he turned partly away from\nme and cried out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCooky!  Oh, Cooky!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Cockney popped out of the galley.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that boy?  Tell him I want him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and Thomas Mugridge fled swiftly aft and disappeared down\nanother companion-way near the wheel.  A moment later he emerged, a\nheavy-set young fellow of eighteen or nineteen, with a glowering,\nvillainous countenance, trailing at his heels.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Ere \u00e2\u0080\u0099e is, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the cook said.\n\nBut Wolf Larsen ignored that worthy, turning at once to the cabin-boy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your name, boy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGeorge Leach, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d came the sullen answer, and the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bearing showed\nclearly that he divined the reason for which he had been summoned.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot an Irish name,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the captain snapped sharply.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cO\u00e2\u0080\u0099Toole or McCarthy\nwould suit your mug a damn sight better.  Unless, very likely, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an\nIrishman in your mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s woodpile.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI saw the young fellow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands clench at the insult, and the blood crawl\nscarlet up his neck.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut let that go,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen continued.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may have very good\nreasons for forgetting your name, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll like you none the worse for it\nas long as you toe the mark.  Telegraph Hill, of course, is your port of\nentry.  It sticks out all over your mug.  Tough as they make them and\ntwice as nasty.  I know the kind.  Well, you can make up your mind to\nhave it taken out of you on this craft.  Understand?  Who shipped you,\nanyway?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMcCready and Swanson.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen thundered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMcCready and Swanson, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the boy corrected, his eyes burning with a\nbitter light.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho got the advance money?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey did, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought as much.  And damned glad you were to let them have it.\nCouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make yourself scarce too quick, with several gentlemen you may\nhave heard of looking for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe boy metamorphosed into a savage on the instant.  His body bunched\ntogether as though for a spring, and his face became as an infuriated\nbeast\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as he snarled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen asked, a peculiar softness in his voice, as though\nhe were overwhelmingly curious to hear the unspoken word.\n\nThe boy hesitated, then mastered his temper.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNothin\u00e2\u0080\u0099, sir.  I take it\nback.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you have shown me I was right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  This with a gratified smile.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow\nold are you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust turned sixteen, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA lie.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never see eighteen again.  Big for your age at that, with\nmuscles like a horse.  Pack up your kit and go for\u00e2\u0080\u0099ard into the fo\u00e2\u0080\u0099c\u00e2\u0080\u0099sle.\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a boat-puller now.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re promoted; see?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWithout waiting for the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s acceptance, the captain turned to the\nsailor who had just finished the gruesome task of sewing up the corpse.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJohansen, do you know anything about navigation?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, never mind; you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re mate just the same.  Get your traps aft into\nthe mate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s berth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the cheery response, as Johansen started forward.\n\nIn the meantime the erstwhile cabin-boy had not moved.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you\nwaiting for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen demanded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sign for boat-puller, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the reply.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI signed for\ncabin-boy.  An\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want no boat-pullin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPack up and go for\u00e2\u0080\u0099ard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis time Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s command was thrillingly imperative.  The boy\nglowered sullenly, but refused to move.\n\nThen came another stirring of Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tremendous strength.  It was\nutterly unexpected, and it was over and done with between the ticks of\ntwo seconds.  He had sprung fully six feet across the deck and driven his\nfist into the other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach.  At the same moment, as though I had been\nstruck myself, I felt a sickening shock in the pit of my stomach.  I\ninstance this to show the sensitiveness of my nervous organization at the\ntime, and how unused I was to spectacles of brutality.  The cabin-boy\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\nhe weighed one hundred and sixty-five at the very least\u00e2\u0080\u0094crumpled up.  His\nbody wrapped limply about the fist like a wet rag about a stick.  He\nlifted into the air, described a short curve, and struck the deck\nalongside the corpse on his head and shoulders, where he lay and writhed\nabout in agony.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Larsen asked of me.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you made up your mind?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI had glanced occasionally at the approaching schooner, and it was now\nalmost abreast of us and not more than a couple of hundred yards away.\nIt was a very trim and neat little craft.  I could see a large, black\nnumber on one of its sails, and I had seen pictures of pilot-boats.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat vessel is that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe pilot-boat _Lady Mine_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen answered grimly.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cGot rid of\nher pilots and running into San Francisco.  She\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be there in five or\nsix hours with this wind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you please signal it, then, so that I may be put ashore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSorry, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lost the signal book overboard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he remarked, and the\ngroup of hunters grinned.\n\nI debated a moment, looking him squarely in the eyes.  I had seen the\nfrightful treatment of the cabin-boy, and knew that I should very\nprobably receive the same, if not worse.  As I say, I debated with\nmyself, and then I did what I consider the bravest act of my life.  I ran\nto the side, waving my arms and shouting:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Lady Mine_ ahoy!  Take me ashore!  A thousand dollars if you take me\nashore!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI waited, watching two men who stood by the wheel, one of them steering.\nThe other was lifting a megaphone to his lips.  I did not turn my head,\nthough I expected every moment a killing blow from the human brute behind\nme.  At last, after what seemed centuries, unable longer to stand the\nstrain, I looked around.  He had not moved.  He was standing in the same\nposition, swaying easily to the roll of the ship and lighting a fresh\ncigar.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is the matter?  Anything wrong?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was the cry from the _Lady Mine_.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I shouted, at the top of my lungs.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cLife or death!  One thousand\ndollars if you take me ashore!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cToo much \u00e2\u0080\u0099Frisco tanglefoot for the health of my crew!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen\nshouted after.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis one\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094indicating me with his thumb\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cfancies\nsea-serpents and monkeys just now!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe man on the _Lady Mine_ laughed back through the megaphone.  The\npilot-boat plunged past.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGive him hell for me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d came a final cry, and the two men waved their\narms in farewell.\n\nI leaned despairingly over the rail, watching the trim little schooner\nswiftly increasing the bleak sweep of ocean between us.  And she would\nprobably be in San Francisco in five or six hours!  My head seemed\nbursting.  There was an ache in my throat as though my heart were up in\nit.  A curling wave struck the side and splashed salt spray on my lips.\nThe wind puffed strongly, and the _Ghost_ heeled far over, burying her\nlee rail.  I could hear the water rushing down upon the deck.\n\nWhen I turned around, a moment later, I saw the cabin-boy staggering to\nhis feet.  His face was ghastly white, twitching with suppressed pain.\nHe looked very sick.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Leach, are you going for\u00e2\u0080\u0099ard?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d came the answer of a spirit cowed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you a thousand\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d I began, but was interrupted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStow that!  Are you going to take up your duties as cabin-boy?  Or do I\nhave to take you in hand?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhat was I to do?  To be brutally beaten, to be killed perhaps, would not\nhelp my case.  I looked steadily into the cruel grey eyes.  They might\nhave been granite for all the light and warmth of a human soul they\ncontained.  One may see the soul stir in some men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes, but his were\nbleak, and cold, and grey as the sea itself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSay \u00e2\u0080\u0098yes, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I corrected.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is your name?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVan Weyden, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst name?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHumphrey, sir; Humphrey Van Weyden.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAge?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThirty-five, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do.  Go to the cook and learn your duties.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd thus it was that I passed into a state of involuntary servitude to\nWolf Larsen.  He was stronger than I, that was all.  But it was very\nunreal at the time.  It is no less unreal now that I look back upon it.\nIt will always be to me a monstrous, inconceivable thing, a horrible\nnightmare.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHold on, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go yet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI stopped obediently in my walk toward the galley.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJohansen, call all hands.  Now that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve everything cleaned up, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nhave the funeral and get the decks cleared of useless lumber.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile Johansen was summoning the watch below, a couple of sailors, under\nthe captain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s direction, laid the canvas-swathed corpse upon a\nhatch-cover.  On either side the deck, against the rail and bottoms up,\nwere lashed a number of small boats.  Several men picked up the\nhatch-cover with its ghastly freight, carried it to the lee side, and\nrested it on the boats, the feet pointing overboard.  To the feet was\nattached the sack of coal which the cook had fetched.\n\nI had always conceived a burial at sea to be a very solemn and\nawe-inspiring event, but I was quickly disillusioned, by this burial at\nany rate.  One of the hunters, a little dark-eyed man whom his mates\ncalled \u00e2\u0080\u009cSmoke,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was telling stories, liberally intersprinkled with oaths\nand obscenities; and every minute or so the group of hunters gave mouth\nto a laughter that sounded to me like a wolf-chorus or the barking of\nhell-hounds.  The sailors trooped noisily aft, some of the watch below\nrubbing the sleep from their eyes, and talked in low tones together.\nThere was an ominous and worried expression on their faces.  It was\nevident that they did not like the outlook of a voyage under such a\ncaptain and begun so inauspiciously.  From time to time they stole\nglances at Wolf Larsen, and I could see that they were apprehensive of\nthe man.\n\nHe stepped up to the hatch-cover, and all caps came off.  I ran my eyes\nover them\u00e2\u0080\u0094twenty men all told; twenty-two including the man at the wheel\nand myself.  I was pardonably curious in my survey, for it appeared my\nfate to be pent up with them on this miniature floating world for I knew\nnot how many weeks or months.  The sailors, in the main, were English and\nScandinavian, and their faces seemed of the heavy, stolid order.  The\nhunters, on the other hand, had stronger and more diversified faces, with\nhard lines and the marks of the free play of passions.  Strange to say,\nand I noted it all once, Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s features showed no such evil\nstamp.  There seemed nothing vicious in them.  True, there were lines,\nbut they were the lines of decision and firmness.  It seemed, rather, a\nfrank and open countenance, which frankness or openness was enhanced by\nthe fact that he was smooth-shaven.  I could hardly believe\u00e2\u0080\u0094until the\nnext incident occurred\u00e2\u0080\u0094that it was the face of a man who could behave as\nhe had behaved to the cabin-boy.\n\nAt this moment, as he opened his mouth to speak, puff after puff struck\nthe schooner and pressed her side under.  The wind shrieked a wild song\nthrough the rigging.  Some of the hunters glanced anxiously aloft.  The\nlee rail, where the dead man lay, was buried in the sea, and as the\nschooner lifted and righted the water swept across the deck wetting us\nabove our shoe-tops.  A shower of rain drove down upon us, each drop\nstinging like a hailstone.  As it passed, Wolf Larsen began to speak, the\nbare-headed men swaying in unison, to the heave and lunge of the deck.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI only remember one part of the service,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand that is, \u00e2\u0080\u0098And\nthe body shall be cast into the sea.\u00e2\u0080\u0099  So cast it in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe ceased speaking.  The men holding the hatch-cover seemed perplexed,\npuzzled no doubt by the briefness of the ceremony.  He burst upon them in\na fury.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLift up that end there, damn you!  What the hell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter with you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey elevated the end of the hatch-cover with pitiful haste, and, like a\ndog flung overside, the dead man slid feet first into the sea.  The coal\nat his feet dragged him down.  He was gone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJohansen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen said briskly to the new mate, \u00e2\u0080\u009ckeep all hands on\ndeck now they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here.  Get in the topsails and jibs and make a good job\nof it.  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in for a sou\u00e2\u0080\u0099-easter.  Better reef the jib and mainsail\ntoo, while you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn a moment the decks were in commotion, Johansen bellowing orders and\nthe men pulling or letting go ropes of various sorts\u00e2\u0080\u0094all naturally\nconfusing to a landsman such as myself.  But it was the heartlessness of\nit that especially struck me.  The dead man was an episode that was past,\nan incident that was dropped, in a canvas covering with a sack of coal,\nwhile the ship sped along and her work went on.  Nobody had been\naffected.  The hunters were laughing at a fresh story of Smoke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; the men\npulling and hauling, and two of them climbing aloft; Wolf Larsen was\nstudying the clouding sky to windward; and the dead man, dying obscenely,\nburied sordidly, and sinking down, down\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nThen it was that the cruelty of the sea, its relentlessness and\nawfulness, rushed upon me.  Life had become cheap and tawdry, a beastly\nand inarticulate thing, a soulless stirring of the ooze and slime.  I\nheld on to the weather rail, close by the shrouds, and gazed out across\nthe desolate foaming waves to the low-lying fog-banks that hid San\nFrancisco and the California coast.  Rain-squalls were driving in\nbetween, and I could scarcely see the fog.  And this strange vessel, with\nits terrible men, pressed under by wind and sea and ever leaping up and\nout, was heading away into the south-west, into the great and lonely\nPacific expanse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nWhat happened to me next on the sealing-schooner _Ghost_, as I strove to\nfit into my new environment, are matters of humiliation and pain.  The\ncook, who was called \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe doctor\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the crew, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTommy\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the hunters,\nand \u00e2\u0080\u009cCooky\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Wolf Larsen, was a changed person.  The difference worked\nin my status brought about a corresponding difference in treatment from\nhim.  Servile and fawning as he had been before, he was now as\ndomineering and bellicose.  In truth, I was no longer the fine gentleman\nwith a skin soft as a \u00e2\u0080\u009clydy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but only an ordinary and very worthless\ncabin-boy.\n\nHe absurdly insisted upon my addressing him as Mr. Mugridge, and his\nbehaviour and carriage were insufferable as he showed me my duties.\nBesides my work in the cabin, with its four small state-rooms, I was\nsupposed to be his assistant in the galley, and my colossal ignorance\nconcerning such things as peeling potatoes or washing greasy pots was a\nsource of unending and sarcastic wonder to him.  He refused to take into\nconsideration what I was, or, rather, what my life and the things I was\naccustomed to had been.  This was part of the attitude he chose to adopt\ntoward me; and I confess, ere the day was done, that I hated him with\nmore lively feelings than I had ever hated any one in my life before.\n\nThis first day was made more difficult for me from the fact that the\n_Ghost_, under close reefs (terms such as these I did not learn till\nlater), was plunging through what Mr. Mugridge called an \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099owlin\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsou\u00e2\u0080\u0099-easter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  At half-past five, under his directions, I set the table\nin the cabin, with rough-weather trays in place, and then carried the tea\nand cooked food down from the galley.  In this connection I cannot\nforbear relating my first experience with a boarding sea.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook sharp or you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get doused,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was Mr. Mugridge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parting injunction,\nas I left the galley with a big tea-pot in one hand, and in the hollow of\nthe other arm several loaves of fresh-baked bread.  One of the hunters, a\ntall, loose-jointed chap named Henderson, was going aft at the time from\nthe steerage (the name the hunters facetiously gave their midships\nsleeping quarters) to the cabin.  Wolf Larsen was on the poop, smoking\nhis everlasting cigar.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Ere she comes.  Sling yer \u00e2\u0080\u0099ook!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the cook cried.\n\nI stopped, for I did not know what was coming, and saw the galley door\nslide shut with a bang.  Then I saw Henderson leaping like a madman for\nthe main rigging, up which he shot, on the inside, till he was many feet\nhigher than my head.  Also I saw a great wave, curling and foaming,\npoised far above the rail.  I was directly under it.  My mind did not\nwork quickly, everything was so new and strange.  I grasped that I was in\ndanger, but that was all.  I stood still, in trepidation.  Then Wolf\nLarsen shouted from the poop:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGrab hold something, you\u00e2\u0080\u0094you Hump!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut it was too late.  I sprang toward the rigging, to which I might have\nclung, and was met by the descending wall of water.  What happened after\nthat was very confusing.  I was beneath the water, suffocating and\ndrowning.  My feet were out from under me, and I was turning over and\nover and being swept along I knew not where.  Several times I collided\nagainst hard objects, once striking my right knee a terrible blow.  Then\nthe flood seemed suddenly to subside and I was breathing the good air\nagain.  I had been swept against the galley and around the steerage\ncompanion-way from the weather side into the lee scuppers.  The pain from\nmy hurt knee was agonizing.  I could not put my weight on it, or, at\nleast, I thought I could not put my weight on it; and I felt sure the leg\nwas broken.  But the cook was after me, shouting through the lee galley\ndoor:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Ere, you!  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tyke all night about it!  Where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the pot?  Lost\noverboard?  Serve you bloody well right if yer neck was broke!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI managed to struggle to my feet.  The great tea-pot was still in my\nhand.  I limped to the galley and handed it to him.  But he was consumed\nwith indignation, real or feigned.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGawd blime me if you ayn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a slob.  Wot \u00e2\u0080\u0099re you good for anyw\u00e2\u0080\u0099y, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nlike to know?  Eh?  Wot \u00e2\u0080\u0099re you good for any\u00e2\u0080\u0099wy?  Cawn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even carry a bit\nof tea aft without losin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 it.  Now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll \u00e2\u0080\u0099ave to boil some more.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAn\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wot \u00e2\u0080\u0099re you snifflin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 about?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he burst out at me, with renewed rage.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Cos you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve \u00e2\u0080\u0099urt yer pore little leg, pore little mamma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s darlin\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI was not sniffling, though my face might well have been drawn and\ntwitching from the pain.  But I called up all my resolution, set my\nteeth, and hobbled back and forth from galley to cabin and cabin to\ngalley without further mishap.  Two things I had acquired by my accident:\nan injured knee-cap that went undressed and from which I suffered for\nweary months, and the name of \u00e2\u0080\u009cHump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which Wolf Larsen had called me\nfrom the poop.  Thereafter, fore and aft, I was known by no other name,\nuntil the term became a part of my thought-processes and I identified it\nwith myself, thought of myself as Hump, as though Hump were I and had\nalways been I.\n\nIt was no easy task, waiting on the cabin table, where sat Wolf Larsen,\nJohansen, and the six hunters.  The cabin was small, to begin with, and\nto move around, as I was compelled to, was not made easier by the\nschooner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s violent pitching and wallowing.  But what struck me most\nforcibly was the total lack of sympathy on the part of the men whom I\nserved.  I could feel my knee through my clothes, swelling, and swelling,\nand I was sick and faint from the pain of it.  I could catch glimpses of\nmy face, white and ghastly, distorted with pain, in the cabin mirror.\nAll the men must have seen my condition, but not one spoke or took notice\nof me, till I was almost grateful to Wolf Larsen, later on (I was washing\nthe dishes), when he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let a little thing like that bother you.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get used to such\nthings in time.  It may cripple you some, but all the same you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be\nlearning to walk.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what you call a paradox, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.\n\nHe seemed pleased when I nodded my head with the customary \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose you know a bit about literary things?  Eh?  Good.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have\nsome talks with you some time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then, taking no further account of me, he turned his back and went up\non deck.\n\nThat night, when I had finished an endless amount of work, I was sent to\nsleep in the steerage, where I made up a spare bunk.  I was glad to get\nout of the detestable presence of the cook and to be off my feet.  To my\nsurprise, my clothes had dried on me and there seemed no indications of\ncatching cold, either from the last soaking or from the prolonged soaking\nfrom the foundering of the _Martinez_.  Under ordinary circumstances,\nafter all that I had undergone, I should have been fit for bed and a\ntrained nurse.\n\nBut my knee was bothering me terribly.  As well as I could make out, the\nkneecap seemed turned up on edge in the midst of the swelling.  As I sat\nin my bunk examining it (the six hunters were all in the steerage,\nsmoking and talking in loud voices), Henderson took a passing glance at\nit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLooks nasty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he commented.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cTie a rag around it, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be all\nright.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThat was all; and on the land I would have been lying on the broad of my\nback, with a surgeon attending on me, and with strict injunctions to do\nnothing but rest.  But I must do these men justice.  Callous as they were\nto my suffering, they were equally callous to their own when anything\nbefell them.  And this was due, I believe, first, to habit; and second,\nto the fact that they were less sensitively organized.  I really believe\nthat a finely-organized, high-strung man would suffer twice and thrice as\nmuch as they from a like injury.\n\nTired as I was,\u00e2\u0080\u0094exhausted, in fact,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I was prevented from sleeping by the\npain in my knee.  It was all I could do to keep from groaning aloud.  At\nhome I should undoubtedly have given vent to my anguish; but this new and\nelemental environment seemed to call for a savage repression.  Like the\nsavage, the attitude of these men was stoical in great things, childish\nin little things.  I remember, later in the voyage, seeing Kerfoot,\nanother of the hunters, lose a finger by having it smashed to a jelly;\nand he did not even murmur or change the expression on his face.  Yet I\nhave seen the same man, time and again, fly into the most outrageous\npassion over a trifle.\n\nHe was doing it now, vociferating, bellowing, waving his arms, and\ncursing like a fiend, and all because of a disagreement with another\nhunter as to whether a seal pup knew instinctively how to swim.  He held\nthat it did, that it could swim the moment it was born.  The other\nhunter, Latimer, a lean, Yankee-looking fellow with shrewd,\nnarrow-slitted eyes, held otherwise, held that the seal pup was born on\nthe land for no other reason than that it could not swim, that its mother\nwas compelled to teach it to swim as birds were compelled to teach their\nnestlings how to fly.\n\nFor the most part, the remaining four hunters leaned on the table or lay\nin their bunks and left the discussion to the two antagonists.  But they\nwere supremely interested, for every little while they ardently took\nsides, and sometimes all were talking at once, till their voices surged\nback and forth in waves of sound like mimic thunder-rolls in the confined\nspace.  Childish and immaterial as the topic was, the quality of their\nreasoning was still more childish and immaterial.  In truth, there was\nvery little reasoning or none at all.  Their method was one of assertion,\nassumption, and denunciation.  They proved that a seal pup could swim or\nnot swim at birth by stating the proposition very bellicosely and then\nfollowing it up with an attack on the opposing man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s judgment, common\nsense, nationality, or past history.  Rebuttal was precisely similar.  I\nhave related this in order to show the mental calibre of the men with\nwhom I was thrown in contact.  Intellectually they were children,\ninhabiting the physical forms of men.\n\nAnd they smoked, incessantly smoked, using a coarse, cheap, and\noffensive-smelling tobacco.  The air was thick and murky with the smoke\nof it; and this, combined with the violent movement of the ship as she\nstruggled through the storm, would surely have made me sea-sick had I\nbeen a victim to that malady.  As it was, it made me quite squeamish,\nthough this nausea might have been due to the pain of my leg and\nexhaustion.\n\nAs I lay there thinking, I naturally dwelt upon myself and my situation.\nIt was unparalleled, undreamed-of, that I, Humphrey Van Weyden, a scholar\nand a dilettante, if you please, in things artistic and literary, should\nbe lying here on a Bering Sea seal-hunting schooner.  Cabin-boy!  I had\nnever done any hard manual labour, or scullion labour, in my life.  I had\nlived a placid, uneventful, sedentary existence all my days\u00e2\u0080\u0094the life of a\nscholar and a recluse on an assured and comfortable income.  Violent life\nand athletic sports had never appealed to me.  I had always been a\nbook-worm; so my sisters and father had called me during my childhood.  I\nhad gone camping but once in my life, and then I left the party almost at\nits start and returned to the comforts and conveniences of a roof.  And\nhere I was, with dreary and endless vistas before me of table-setting,\npotato-peeling, and dish-washing.  And I was not strong.  The doctors had\nalways said that I had a remarkable constitution, but I had never\ndeveloped it or my body through exercise.  My muscles were small and\nsoft, like a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, or so the doctors had said time and again in the\ncourse of their attempts to persuade me to go in for physical-culture\nfads.  But I had preferred to use my head rather than my body; and here I\nwas, in no fit condition for the rough life in prospect.\n\nThese are merely a few of the things that went through my mind, and are\nrelated for the sake of vindicating myself in advance in the weak and\nhelpless _r\u00c3\u00b4le_ I was destined to play.  But I thought, also, of my\nmother and sisters, and pictured their grief.  I was among the missing\ndead of the _Martinez_ disaster, an unrecovered body.  I could see the\nhead-lines in the papers; the fellows at the University Club and the\nBibelot shaking their heads and saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPoor chap!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And I could see\nCharley Furuseth, as I had said good-bye to him that morning, lounging in\na dressing-gown on the be-pillowed window couch and delivering himself of\noracular and pessimistic epigrams.\n\nAnd all the while, rolling, plunging, climbing the moving mountains and\nfalling and wallowing in the foaming valleys, the schooner _Ghost_ was\nfighting her way farther and farther into the heart of the Pacific\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I\nwas on her.  I could hear the wind above.  It came to my ears as a\nmuffled roar.  Now and again feet stamped overhead.  An endless creaking\nwas going on all about me, the woodwork and the fittings groaning and\nsqueaking and complaining in a thousand keys.  The hunters were still\narguing and roaring like some semi-human amphibious breed.  The air was\nfilled with oaths and indecent expressions.  I could see their faces,\nflushed and angry, the brutality distorted and emphasized by the sickly\nyellow of the sea-lamps which rocked back and forth with the ship.\nThrough the dim smoke-haze the bunks looked like the sleeping dens of\nanimals in a menagerie.  Oilskins and sea-boots were hanging from the\nwalls, and here and there rifles and shotguns rested securely in the\nracks.  It was a sea-fitting for the buccaneers and pirates of by-gone\nyears.  My imagination ran riot, and still I could not sleep.  And it was\na long, long night, weary and dreary and long.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nBut my first night in the hunters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 steerage was also my last.  Next day\nJohansen, the new mate, was routed from the cabin by Wolf Larsen, and\nsent into the steerage to sleep thereafter, while I took possession of\nthe tiny cabin state-room, which, on the first day of the voyage, had\nalready had two occupants.  The reason for this change was quickly\nlearned by the hunters, and became the cause of a deal of grumbling on\ntheir part.  It seemed that Johansen, in his sleep, lived over each night\nthe events of the day.  His incessant talking and shouting and bellowing\nof orders had been too much for Wolf Larsen, who had accordingly foisted\nthe nuisance upon his hunters.\n\nAfter a sleepless night, I arose weak and in agony, to hobble through my\nsecond day on the _Ghost_.  Thomas Mugridge routed me out at half-past\nfive, much in the fashion that Bill Sykes must have routed out his dog;\nbut Mr. Mugridge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brutality to me was paid back in kind and with\ninterest.  The unnecessary noise he made (I had lain wide-eyed the whole\nnight) must have awakened one of the hunters; for a heavy shoe whizzed\nthrough the semi-darkness, and Mr. Mugridge, with a sharp howl of pain,\nhumbly begged everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pardon.  Later on, in the galley, I noticed\nthat his ear was bruised and swollen.  It never went entirely back to its\nnormal shape, and was called a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccauliflower ear\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the sailors.\n\nThe day was filled with miserable variety.  I had taken my dried clothes\ndown from the galley the night before, and the first thing I did was to\nexchange the cook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s garments for them.  I looked for my purse.  In\naddition to some small change (and I have a good memory for such things),\nit had contained one hundred and eighty-five dollars in gold and paper.\nThe purse I found, but its contents, with the exception of the small\nsilver, had been abstracted.  I spoke to the cook about it, when I went\non deck to take up my duties in the galley, and though I had looked\nforward to a surly answer, I had not expected the belligerent harangue\nthat I received.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook \u00e2\u0080\u0099ere, \u00e2\u0080\u0099Ump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he began, a malicious light in his eyes and a snarl in\nhis throat; \u00e2\u0080\u009cd\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye want yer nose punched?  If you think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a thief, just\nkeep it to yerself, or you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find \u00e2\u0080\u0099ow bloody well mistyken you are.\nStrike me blind if this ayn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gratitude for yer!  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Ere you come, a pore\nmis\u00e2\u0080\u0099rable specimen of \u00e2\u0080\u0099uman scum, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I tykes yer into my galley an\u00e2\u0080\u0099\ntreats yer \u00e2\u0080\u0099ansom, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 this is wot I get for it.  Nex\u00e2\u0080\u0099 time you can go to\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099ell, say I, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve a good mind to give you what-for anyw\u00e2\u0080\u0099y.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he put up his fists and started for me.  To my shame be it, I\ncowered away from the blow and ran out the galley door.  What else was I\nto do?  Force, nothing but force, obtained on this brute-ship.  Moral\nsuasion was a thing unknown.  Picture it to yourself: a man of ordinary\nstature, slender of build, and with weak, undeveloped muscles, who has\nlived a peaceful, placid life, and is unused to violence of any sort\u00e2\u0080\u0094what\ncould such a man possibly do?  There was no more reason that I should\nstand and face these human beasts than that I should stand and face an\ninfuriated bull.\n\nSo I thought it out at the time, feeling the need for vindication and\ndesiring to be at peace with my conscience.  But this vindication did not\nsatisfy.  Nor, to this day can I permit my manhood to look back upon\nthose events and feel entirely exonerated.  The situation was something\nthat really exceeded rational formulas for conduct and demanded more than\nthe cold conclusions of reason.  When viewed in the light of formal\nlogic, there is not one thing of which to be ashamed; but nevertheless a\nshame rises within me at the recollection, and in the pride of my manhood\nI feel that my manhood has in unaccountable ways been smirched and\nsullied.\n\nAll of which is neither here nor there.  The speed with which I ran from\nthe galley caused excruciating pain in my knee, and I sank down\nhelplessly at the break of the poop.  But the Cockney had not pursued me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook at \u00e2\u0080\u0099im run!  Look at \u00e2\u0080\u0099im run!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I could hear him crying.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAn\u00e2\u0080\u0099 with\na gyme leg at that!  Come on back, you pore little mamma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s darling.  I\nwon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0099it yer; no, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI came back and went on with my work; and here the episode ended for the\ntime, though further developments were yet to take place.  I set the\nbreakfast-table in the cabin, and at seven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock waited on the hunters\nand officers.  The storm had evidently broken during the night, though a\nhuge sea was still running and a stiff wind blowing.  Sail had been made\nin the early watches, so that the _Ghost_ was racing along under\neverything except the two topsails and the flying jib.  These three\nsails, I gathered from the conversation, were to be set immediately after\nbreakfast.  I learned, also, that Wolf Larsen was anxious to make the\nmost of the storm, which was driving him to the south-west into that\nportion of the sea where he expected to pick up with the north-east\ntrades.  It was before this steady wind that he hoped to make the major\nportion of the run to Japan, curving south into the tropics and north\nagain as he approached the coast of Asia.\n\nAfter breakfast I had another unenviable experience.  When I had finished\nwashing the dishes, I cleaned the cabin stove and carried the ashes up on\ndeck to empty them.  Wolf Larsen and Henderson were standing near the\nwheel, deep in conversation.  The sailor, Johnson, was steering.  As I\nstarted toward the weather side I saw him make a sudden motion with his\nhead, which I mistook for a token of recognition and good-morning.  In\nreality, he was attempting to warn me to throw my ashes over the lee\nside.  Unconscious of my blunder, I passed by Wolf Larsen and the hunter\nand flung the ashes over the side to windward.  The wind drove them back,\nand not only over me, but over Henderson and Wolf Larsen.  The next\ninstant the latter kicked me, violently, as a cur is kicked.  I had not\nrealized there could be so much pain in a kick.  I reeled away from him\nand leaned against the cabin in a half-fainting condition.  Everything\nwas swimming before my eyes, and I turned sick.  The nausea overpowered\nme, and I managed to crawl to the side of the vessel.  But Wolf Larsen\ndid not follow me up.  Brushing the ashes from his clothes, he had\nresumed his conversation with Henderson.  Johansen, who had seen the\naffair from the break of the poop, sent a couple of sailors aft to clean\nup the mess.\n\nLater in the morning I received a surprise of a totally different sort.\nFollowing the cook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s instructions, I had gone into Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nstate-room to put it to rights and make the bed.  Against the wall, near\nthe head of the bunk, was a rack filled with books.  I glanced over them,\nnoting with astonishment such names as Shakespeare, Tennyson, Poe, and De\nQuincey.  There were scientific works, too, among which were represented\nmen such as Tyndall, Proctor, and Darwin.  Astronomy and physics were\nrepresented, and I remarked Bulfinch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _Age of Fable_, Shaw\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _History of\nEnglish and American Literature_, and Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _Natural History_ in two\nlarge volumes.  Then there were a number of grammars, such as Metcalf\u00e2\u0080\u0099s,\nand Reed and Kellogg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; and I smiled as I saw a copy of _The Dean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nEnglish_.\n\nI could not reconcile these books with the man from what I had seen of\nhim, and I wondered if he could possibly read them.  But when I came to\nmake the bed I found, between the blankets, dropped apparently as he had\nsunk off to sleep, a complete Browning, the Cambridge Edition.  It was\nopen at \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn a Balcony,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and I noticed, here and there, passages\nunderlined in pencil.  Further, letting drop the volume during a lurch of\nthe ship, a sheet of paper fell out.  It was scrawled over with\ngeometrical diagrams and calculations of some sort.\n\nIt was patent that this terrible man was no ignorant clod, such as one\nwould inevitably suppose him to be from his exhibitions of brutality.  At\nonce he became an enigma.  One side or the other of his nature was\nperfectly comprehensible; but both sides together were bewildering.  I\nhad already remarked that his language was excellent, marred with an\noccasional slight inaccuracy.  Of course, in common speech with the\nsailors and hunters, it sometimes fairly bristled with errors, which was\ndue to the vernacular itself; but in the few words he had held with me it\nhad been clear and correct.\n\nThis glimpse I had caught of his other side must have emboldened me, for\nI resolved to speak to him about the money I had lost.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been robbed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said to him, a little later, when I found him\npacing up and down the poop alone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he corrected, not harshly, but sternly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been robbed, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I amended.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow did it happen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\nThen I told him the whole circumstance, how my clothes had been left to\ndry in the galley, and how, later, I was nearly beaten by the cook when I\nmentioned the matter.\n\nHe smiled at my recital.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cPickings,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he concluded; \u00e2\u0080\u009cCooky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pickings.\nAnd don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think your miserable life worth the price?  Besides,\nconsider it a lesson.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll learn in time how to take care of your\nmoney for yourself.  I suppose, up to now, your lawyer has done it for\nyou, or your business agent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI could feel the quiet sneer through his words, but demanded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can I\nget it back again?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your look-out.  You haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any lawyer or business agent now, so\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to depend on yourself.  When you get a dollar, hang on to it.\nA man who leaves his money lying around, the way you did, deserves to\nlose it.  Besides, you have sinned.  You have no right to put temptation\nin the way of your fellow-creatures.  You tempted Cooky, and he fell.\nYou have placed his immortal soul in jeopardy.  By the way, do you\nbelieve in the immortal soul?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis lids lifted lazily as he asked the question, and it seemed that the\ndeeps were opening to me and that I was gazing into his soul.  But it was\nan illusion.  Far as it might have seemed, no man has ever seen very far\ninto Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soul, or seen it at all,\u00e2\u0080\u0094of this I am convinced.  It\nwas a very lonely soul, I was to learn, that never unmasked, though at\nrare moments it played at doing so.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI read immortality in your eyes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered, dropping the \u00e2\u0080\u009csir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094an\nexperiment, for I thought the intimacy of the conversation warranted it.\n\nHe took no notice.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy that, I take it, you see something that is alive,\nbut that necessarily does not have to live for ever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI read more than that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I continued boldly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you read consciousness.  You read the consciousness of life that it\nis alive; but still no further away, no endlessness of life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHow clearly he thought, and how well he expressed what he thought!  From\nregarding me curiously, he turned his head and glanced out over the\nleaden sea to windward.  A bleakness came into his eyes, and the lines of\nhis mouth grew severe and harsh.  He was evidently in a pessimistic mood.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen to what end?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he demanded abruptly, turning back to me.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I am\nimmortal\u00e2\u0080\u0094why?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI halted.  How could I explain my idealism to this man?  How could I put\ninto speech a something felt, a something like the strains of music heard\nin sleep, a something that convinced yet transcended utterance?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you believe, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I countered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe that life is a mess,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered promptly.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is like\nyeast, a ferment, a thing that moves and may move for a minute, an hour,\na year, or a hundred years, but that in the end will cease to move.  The\nbig eat the little that they may continue to move, the strong eat the\nweak that they may retain their strength.  The lucky eat the most and\nmove the longest, that is all.  What do you make of those things?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe swept his arm in an impatient gesture toward a number of the sailors\nwho were working on some kind of rope stuff amidships.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey move, so does the jelly-fish move.  They move in order to eat in\norder that they may keep moving.  There you have it.  They live for their\nbelly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, and the belly is for their sake.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a circle; you get\nnowhere.  Neither do they.  In the end they come to a standstill.  They\nmove no more.  They are dead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have dreams,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I interrupted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cradiant, flashing dreams\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf grub,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he concluded sententiously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd of more\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGrub.  Of a larger appetite and more luck in satisfying it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  His voice\nsounded harsh.  There was no levity in it.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor, look you, they dream of\nmaking lucky voyages which will bring them more money, of becoming the\nmates of ships, of finding fortunes\u00e2\u0080\u0094in short, of being in a better\nposition for preying on their fellows, of having all night in, good grub\nand somebody else to do the dirty work.  You and I are just like them.\nThere is no difference, except that we have eaten more and better.  I am\neating them now, and you too.  But in the past you have eaten more than I\nhave.  You have slept in soft beds, and worn fine clothes, and eaten good\nmeals.  Who made those beds? and those clothes? and those meals?  Not\nyou.  You never made anything in your own sweat.  You live on an income\nwhich your father earned.  You are like a frigate bird swooping down upon\nthe boobies and robbing them of the fish they have caught.  You are one\nwith a crowd of men who have made what they call a government, who are\nmasters of all the other men, and who eat the food the other men get and\nwould like to eat themselves.  You wear the warm clothes.  They made the\nclothes, but they shiver in rags and ask you, the lawyer, or business\nagent who handles your money, for a job.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut that is beside the matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot at all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  He was speaking rapidly now, and his eyes were flashing.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is piggishness, and it is life.  Of what use or sense is an\nimmortality of piggishness?  What is the end?  What is it all about?  You\nhave made no food.  Yet the food you have eaten or wasted might have\nsaved the lives of a score of wretches who made the food but did not eat\nit.  What immortal end did you serve? or did they?  Consider yourself and\nme.  What does your boasted immortality amount to when your life runs\nfoul of mine?  You would like to go back to the land, which is a\nfavourable place for your kind of piggishness.  It is a whim of mine to\nkeep you aboard this ship, where my piggishness flourishes.  And keep you\nI will.  I may make or break you.  You may die to-day, this week, or next\nmonth.  I could kill you now, with a blow of my fist, for you are a\nmiserable weakling.  But if we are immortal, what is the reason for this?\nTo be piggish as you and I have been all our lives does not seem to be\njust the thing for immortals to be doing.  Again, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it all about?\nWhy have I kept you here?\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause you are stronger,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I managed to blurt out.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut why stronger?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he went on at once with his perpetual queries.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause I am a bigger bit of the ferment than you?  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see?\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the hopelessness of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I protested.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI agree with you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen why move at all, since moving is\nliving?  Without moving and being part of the yeast there would be no\nhopelessness.  But,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and there it is,\u00e2\u0080\u0094we want to live and move, though we\nhave no reason to, because it happens that it is the nature of life to\nlive and move, to want to live and move.  If it were not for this, life\nwould be dead.  It is because of this life that is in you that you dream\nof your immortality.  The life that is in you is alive and wants to go on\nbeing alive for ever.  Bah!  An eternity of piggishness!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe abruptly turned on his heel and started forward.  He stopped at the\nbreak of the poop and called me to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the way, how much was it that Cooky got away with?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne hundred and eighty-five dollars, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered.\n\nHe nodded his head.  A moment later, as I started down the companion\nstairs to lay the table for dinner, I heard him loudly cursing some men\namidships.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nBy the following morning the storm had blown itself quite out and the\n_Ghost_ was rolling slightly on a calm sea without a breath of wind.\nOccasional light airs were felt, however, and Wolf Larsen patrolled the\npoop constantly, his eyes ever searching the sea to the north-eastward,\nfrom which direction the great trade-wind must blow.\n\nThe men were all on deck and busy preparing their various boats for the\nseason\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hunting.  There are seven boats aboard, the captain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dingey,\nand the six which the hunters will use.  Three, a hunter, a boat-puller,\nand a boat-steerer, compose a boat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crew.  On board the schooner the\nboat-pullers and steerers are the crew.  The hunters, too, are supposed\nto be in command of the watches, subject, always, to the orders of Wolf\nLarsen.\n\nAll this, and more, I have learned.  The _Ghost_ is considered the\nfastest schooner in both the San Francisco and Victoria fleets.  In fact,\nshe was once a private yacht, and was built for speed.  Her lines and\nfittings\u00e2\u0080\u0094though I know nothing about such things\u00e2\u0080\u0094speak for themselves.\nJohnson was telling me about her in a short chat I had with him during\nyesterday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second dog-watch.  He spoke enthusiastically, with the love\nfor a fine craft such as some men feel for horses.  He is greatly\ndisgusted with the outlook, and I am given to understand that Wolf Larsen\nbears a very unsavoury reputation among the sealing captains.  It was the\n_Ghost_ herself that lured Johnson into signing for the voyage, but he is\nalready beginning to repent.\n\nAs he told me, the _Ghost_ is an eighty-ton schooner of a remarkably fine\nmodel.  Her beam, or width, is twenty-three feet, and her length a little\nover ninety feet.  A lead keel of fabulous but unknown weight makes her\nvery stable, while she carries an immense spread of canvas.  From the\ndeck to the truck of the maintopmast is something over a hundred feet,\nwhile the foremast with its topmast is eight or ten feet shorter.  I am\ngiving these details so that the size of this little floating world which\nholds twenty-two men may be appreciated.  It is a very little world, a\nmote, a speck, and I marvel that men should dare to venture the sea on a\ncontrivance so small and fragile.\n\nWolf Larsen has, also, a reputation for reckless carrying on of sail.  I\noverheard Henderson and another of the hunters, Standish, a Californian,\ntalking about it.  Two years ago he dismasted the _Ghost_ in a gale on\nBering Sea, whereupon the present masts were put in, which are stronger\nand heavier in every way.  He is said to have remarked, when he put them\nin, that he preferred turning her over to losing the sticks.\n\nEvery man aboard, with the exception of Johansen, who is rather overcome\nby his promotion, seems to have an excuse for having sailed on the\n_Ghost_.  Half the men forward are deep-water sailors, and their excuse\nis that they did not know anything about her or her captain.  And those\nwho do know, whisper that the hunters, while excellent shots, were so\nnotorious for their quarrelsome and rascally proclivities that they could\nnot sign on any decent schooner.\n\nI have made the acquaintance of another one of the crew,\u00e2\u0080\u0094Louis he is\ncalled, a rotund and jovial-faced Nova Scotia Irishman, and a very\nsociable fellow, prone to talk as long as he can find a listener.  In the\nafternoon, while the cook was below asleep and I was peeling the\neverlasting potatoes, Louis dropped into the galley for a \u00e2\u0080\u009cyarn.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  His\nexcuse for being aboard was that he was drunk when he signed.  He assured\nme again and again that it was the last thing in the world he would dream\nof doing in a sober moment.  It seems that he has been seal-hunting\nregularly each season for a dozen years, and is accounted one of the two\nor three very best boat-steerers in both fleets.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, my boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he shook his head ominously at me, \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis the worst schooner\nye could iv selected, nor were ye drunk at the time as was I.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis\nsealin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is the sailor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paradise\u00e2\u0080\u0094on other ships than this.  The mate was\nthe first, but mark me words, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be more dead men before the trip\nis done with.  Hist, now, between you an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 meself and the stanchion there,\nthis Wolf Larsen is a regular devil, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the _Ghost\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll_ be a hell-ship\nlike she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always ben since he had hold iv her.  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I know?  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I\nknow?  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I remember him in Hakodate two years gone, when he had a row\nan\u00e2\u0080\u0099 shot four iv his men?  Wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I a-layin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 on the _Emma L._, not three\nhundred yards away?  An\u00e2\u0080\u0099 there was a man the same year he killed with a\nblow iv his fist.  Yes, sir, killed \u00e2\u0080\u0099im dead-oh.  His head must iv\nsmashed like an eggshell.  An\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there the Governor of Kura Island,\nan\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the Chief iv Police, Japanese gentlemen, sir, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they come\naboard the _Ghost_ as his guests, a-bringin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 their wives along\u00e2\u0080\u0094wee an\u00e2\u0080\u0099\npretty little bits of things like you see \u00e2\u0080\u0099em painted on fans.  An\u00e2\u0080\u0099 as he\nwas a-gettin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 under way, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the fond husbands get left astern-like in\ntheir sampan, as it might be by accident?  An\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it a week later\nthat the poor little ladies was put ashore on the other side of the\nisland, with nothin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 before \u00e2\u0080\u0099em but to walk home acrost the mountains on\ntheir weeny-teeny little straw sandals which wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hang together a\nmile?  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I know?  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis the beast he is, this Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0094the great\nbig beast mentioned iv in Revelation; an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 no good end will he ever come\nto.  But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said nothin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to ye, mind ye.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve whispered never a word;\nfor old fat Louis\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll live the voyage out if the last mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son of yez\ngo to the fishes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWolf Larsen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he snorted a moment later.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cListen to the word, will ye!\nWolf\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis what he is.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not black-hearted like some men.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis no\nheart he has at all.  Wolf, just wolf, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis what he is.  D\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye wonder he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwell named?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if he is so well-known for what he is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I queried, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow is it that\nhe can get men to ship with him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAn\u00e2\u0080\u0099 how is it ye can get men to do anything on God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earth an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sea?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nLouis demanded with Celtic fire.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye find me aboard if \u00e2\u0080\u0099twasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nthat I was drunk as a pig when I put me name down?  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s them that\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sail with better men, like the hunters, and them that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\nlike the poor devils of wind-jammers for\u00e2\u0080\u0099ard there.  But they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come to\nit, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come to it, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 be sorry the day they was born.  I could weep\nfor the poor creatures, did I but forget poor old fat Louis and the\ntroubles before him.  But \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis not a whisper I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve dropped, mind ye, not a\nwhisper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThem hunters is the wicked boys,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he broke forth again, for he suffered\nfrom a constitutional plethora of speech.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut wait till they get to\ncutting up iv jinks and rowin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0099round.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll fix \u00e2\u0080\u0099em.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis\nhim that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll put the fear of God in their rotten black hearts.  Look at\nthat hunter iv mine, Horner.  \u00e2\u0080\u0098Jock\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Horner they call him, so quiet-like\nan\u00e2\u0080\u0099 easy-goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099, soft-spoken as a girl, till ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think butter wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nmelt in the mouth iv him.  Didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he kill his boat-steerer last year?\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099Twas called a sad accident, but I met the boat-puller in Yokohama an\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nthe straight iv it was given me.  An\u00e2\u0080\u0099 there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Smoke, the black little\ndevil\u00e2\u0080\u0094didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the Roosians have him for three years in the salt mines of\nSiberia, for poachin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 on Copper Island, which is a Roosian preserve?\nShackled he was, hand an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 foot, with his mate.  An\u00e2\u0080\u0099 didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they have\nwords or a ruction of some kind?\u00e2\u0080\u0094for \u00e2\u0080\u0099twas the other fellow Smoke sent up\nin the buckets to the top of the mine; an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a piece at a time he went up,\na leg to-day, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to-morrow an arm, the next day the head, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 so on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried out, overcome with the horror of it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMean what!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he demanded, quick as a flash.  \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis nothin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said.\nDeef I am, and dumb, as ye should be for the sake iv your mother; an\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nnever once have I opened me lips but to say fine things iv them an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 him,\nGod curse his soul, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 may he rot in purgatory ten thousand years, and\nthen go down to the last an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 deepest hell iv all!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJohnson, the man who had chafed me raw when I first came aboard, seemed\nthe least equivocal of the men forward or aft.  In fact, there was\nnothing equivocal about him.  One was struck at once by his\nstraightforwardness and manliness, which, in turn, were tempered by a\nmodesty which might be mistaken for timidity.  But timid he was not.  He\nseemed, rather, to have the courage of his convictions, the certainty of\nhis manhood.  It was this that made him protest, at the commencement of\nour acquaintance, against being called Yonson.  And upon this, and him,\nLouis passed judgment and prophecy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis a fine chap, that squarehead Johnson we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve for\u00e2\u0080\u0099ard with us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe best sailorman in the fo\u00e2\u0080\u0099c\u00e2\u0080\u0099sle.

I can see it brewin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 comin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 up like a storm\nin the sky.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked to him like a brother, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little he sees\nin takin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in his lights or flyin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 false signals.  He grumbles out when\nthings don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go to suit him, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be always some tell-tale\ncarryin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 word iv it aft to the Wolf.  The Wolf is strong, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the\nway of a wolf to hate strength, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 strength it is he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see in\nJohnson\u00e2\u0080\u0094no knucklin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 under, and a \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, sir, thank ye kindly, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for a\ncurse or a blow.  Oh, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a-comin\u00e2\u0080\u0099!  She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a-comin\u00e2\u0080\u0099!  An\u00e2\u0080\u0099 God knows\nwhere I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get another boat-puller!  What does the fool up an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 say, when\nthe old man calls him Yonson, but \u00e2\u0080\u0098Me name is Johnson, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 then\nspells it out, letter for letter.  Ye should iv seen the old man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face!\nI thought he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d let drive at him on the spot.  He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, but he will, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nhe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll break that squarehead\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart, or it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little I know iv the ways iv\nmen on the ships iv the sea.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThomas Mugridge is becoming unendurable.  I am compelled to Mister him\nand to Sir him with every speech.  One reason for this is that Wolf\nLarsen seems to have taken a fancy to him.  It is an unprecedented thing,\nI take it, for a captain to be chummy with the cook; but this is\ncertainly what Wolf Larsen is doing.  Two or three times he put his head\ninto the galley and chaffed Mugridge good-naturedly, and once, this\nafternoon, he stood by the break of the poop and chatted with him for\nfully fifteen minutes.  When it was over, and Mugridge was back in the\ngalley, he became greasily radiant, and went about his work, humming\ncoster songs in a nerve-racking and discordant falsetto.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI always get along with the officers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he remarked to me in a\nconfidential tone.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know the w\u00e2\u0080\u0099y, I do, to myke myself uppreci-yted.\nThere was my last skipper\u00e2\u0080\u0094w\u00e2\u0080\u0099y I thought nothin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of droppin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 down in the\ncabin for a little chat and a friendly glass.  \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mugridge,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sez \u00e2\u0080\u0099e to me,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Mugridge,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sez \u00e2\u0080\u0099e, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve missed yer vokytion.\u00e2\u0080\u0099  \u00e2\u0080\u0098An\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0099ow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sez\nI.  \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yer should \u00e2\u0080\u0099a been born a gentleman, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 never \u00e2\u0080\u0099ad to work for yer\nlivin\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\u00e2\u0080\u0099  God strike me dead, \u00e2\u0080\u0099Ump, if that ayn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wot \u00e2\u0080\u0099e sez, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me\na-sittin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 there in \u00e2\u0080\u0099is own cabin, jolly-like an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 comfortable, a-smokin\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099is cigars an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 drinkin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0099is rum.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis chitter-chatter drove me to distraction.  I never heard a voice I\nhated so.  His oily, insinuating tones, his greasy smile and his\nmonstrous self-conceit grated on my nerves till sometimes I was all in a\ntremble.  Positively, he was the most disgusting and loathsome person I\nhave ever met.  The filth of his cooking was indescribable; and, as he\ncooked everything that was eaten aboard, I was compelled to select what I\nate with great circumspection, choosing from the least dirty of his\nconcoctions.\n\nMy hands bothered me a great deal, unused as they were to work.  The\nnails were discoloured and black, while the skin was already grained with\ndirt which even a scrubbing-brush could not remove.  Then blisters came,\nin a painful and never-ending procession, and I had a great burn on my\nforearm, acquired by losing my balance in a roll of the ship and pitching\nagainst the galley stove.  Nor was my knee any better.  The swelling had\nnot gone down, and the cap was still up on edge.  Hobbling about on it\nfrom morning till night was not helping it any.  What I needed was rest,\nif it were ever to get well.\n\nRest!  I never before knew the meaning of the word.  I had been resting\nall my life and did not know it.  But now, could I sit still for one\nhalf-hour and do nothing, not even think, it would be the most\npleasurable thing in the world.  But it is a revelation, on the other\nhand.  I shall be able to appreciate the lives of the working people\nhereafter.  I did not dream that work was so terrible a thing.  From\nhalf-past five in the morning till ten o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock at night I am everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nslave, with not one moment to myself, except such as I can steal near the\nend of the second dog-watch.  Let me pause for a minute to look out over\nthe sea sparkling in the sun, or to gaze at a sailor going aloft to the\ngaff-topsails, or running out the bowsprit, and I am sure to hear the\nhateful voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Ere, you, \u00e2\u0080\u0099Ump, no sodgerin\u00e2\u0080\u0099.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got my peepers on\nyer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere are signs of rampant bad temper in the steerage, and the gossip is\ngoing around that Smoke and Henderson have had a fight.  Henderson seems\nthe best of the hunters, a slow-going fellow, and hard to rouse; but\nroused he must have been, for Smoke had a bruised and discoloured eye,\nand looked particularly vicious when he came into the cabin for supper.\n\nA cruel thing happened just before supper, indicative of the callousness\nand brutishness of these men.  There is one green hand in the crew,\nHarrison by name, a clumsy-looking country boy, mastered, I imagine, by\nthe spirit of adventure, and making his first voyage.  In the light\nbaffling airs the schooner had been tacking about a great deal, at which\ntimes the sails pass from one side to the other and a man is sent aloft\nto shift over the fore-gaff-topsail.  In some way, when Harrison was\naloft, the sheet jammed in the block through which it runs at the end of\nthe gaff.  As I understood it, there were two ways of getting it\ncleared,\u00e2\u0080\u0094first, by lowering the foresail, which was comparatively easy\nand without danger; and second, by climbing out the peak-halyards to the\nend of the gaff itself, an exceedingly hazardous performance.\n\nJohansen called out to Harrison to go out the halyards.  It was patent to\neverybody that the boy was afraid.  And well he might be, eighty feet\nabove the deck, to trust himself on those thin and jerking ropes.  Had\nthere been a steady breeze it would not have been so bad, but the _Ghost_\nwas rolling emptily in a long sea, and with each roll the canvas flapped\nand boomed and the halyards slacked and jerked taut.  They were capable\nof snapping a man off like a fly from a whip-lash.\n\nHarrison heard the order and understood what was demanded of him, but\nhesitated.  It was probably the first time he had been aloft in his life.\nJohansen, who had caught the contagion of Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s masterfulness,\nburst out with a volley of abuse and curses.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do, Johansen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen said brusquely.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have you know\nthat I do the swearing on this ship.  If I need your assistance, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\ncall you in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the mate acknowledged submissively.\n\nIn the meantime Harrison had started out on the halyards.  I was looking\nup from the galley door, and I could see him trembling, as if with ague,\nin every limb.  He proceeded very slowly and cautiously, an inch at a\ntime.  Outlined against the clear blue of the sky, he had the appearance\nof an enormous spider crawling along the tracery of its web.\n\nIt was a slight uphill climb, for the foresail peaked high; and the\nhalyards, running through various blocks on the gaff and mast, gave him\nseparate holds for hands and feet.  But the trouble lay in that the wind\nwas not strong enough nor steady enough to keep the sail full.  When he\nwas half-way out, the _Ghost_ took a long roll to windward and back again\ninto the hollow between two seas.  Harrison ceased his progress and held\non tightly.  Eighty feet beneath, I could see the agonized strain of his\nmuscles as he gripped for very life.  The sail emptied and the gaff swung\namid-ships.  The halyards slackened, and, though it all happened very\nquickly, I could see them sag beneath the weight of his body.  Then the\ngag swung to the side with an abrupt swiftness, the great sail boomed\nlike a cannon, and the three rows of reef-points slatted against the\ncanvas like a volley of rifles.  Harrison, clinging on, made the giddy\nrush through the air.  This rush ceased abruptly.  The halyards became\ninstantly taut.  It was the snap of the whip.  His clutch was broken.\nOne hand was torn loose from its hold.  The other lingered desperately\nfor a moment, and followed.  His body pitched out and down, but in some\nway he managed to save himself with his legs.  He was hanging by them,\nhead downward.  A quick effort brought his hands up to the halyards\nagain; but he was a long time regaining his former position, where he\nhung, a pitiable object.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bet he has no appetite for supper,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I heard Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice,\nwhich came to me from around the corner of the galley.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cStand from\nunder, you, Johansen!  Watch out!  Here she comes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn truth, Harrison was very sick, as a person is sea-sick; and for a long\ntime he clung to his precarious perch without attempting to move.\nJohansen, however, continued violently to urge him on to the completion\nof his task.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a shame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I heard Johnson growling in painfully slow and correct\nEnglish.  He was standing by the main rigging, a few feet away from me.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe boy is willing enough.  He will learn if he has a chance.  But this\nis\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d  He paused awhile, for the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cmurder\u00e2\u0080\u009d was his final judgment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHist, will ye!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Louis whispered to him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the love iv your mother\nhold your mouth!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Johnson, looking on, still continued his grumbling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the hunter Standish spoke to Wolf Larsen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my\nboat-puller, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to lose him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right, Standish,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the reply.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your boat-puller when\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got him in the boat; but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my sailor when I have him aboard,\nand I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do what I damn well please with him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no reason\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d Standish began in a torrent of speech.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do, easy as she goes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen counselled back.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve told\nyou what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what, and let it stop at that.  The man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mine, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make\nsoup of him and eat it if I want to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was an angry gleam in the hunter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye, but he turned on his heel\nand entered the steerage companion-way, where he remained, looking\nupward.  All hands were on deck now, and all eyes were aloft, where a\nhuman life was at grapples with death.  The callousness of these men, to\nwhom industrial organization gave control of the lives of other men, was\nappalling.  I, who had lived out of the whirl of the world, had never\ndreamed that its work was carried on in such fashion.  Life had always\nseemed a peculiarly sacred thing, but here it counted for nothing, was a\ncipher in the arithmetic of commerce.  I must say, however, that the\nsailors themselves were sympathetic, as instance the case of Johnson; but\nthe masters (the hunters and the captain) were heartlessly indifferent.\nEven the protest of Standish arose out of the fact that he did not wish\nto lose his boat-puller.  Had it been some other hunter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boat-puller,\nhe, like them, would have been no more than amused.\n\nBut to return to Harrison.  It took Johansen, insulting and reviling the\npoor wretch, fully ten minutes to get him started again.  A little later\nhe made the end of the gaff, where, astride the spar itself, he had a\nbetter chance for holding on.  He cleared the sheet, and was free to\nreturn, slightly downhill now, along the halyards to the mast.  But he\nhad lost his nerve.  Unsafe as was his present position, he was loath to\nforsake it for the more unsafe position on the halyards.\n\nHe looked along the airy path he must traverse, and then down to the\ndeck.  His eyes were wide and staring, and he was trembling violently.  I\nhad never seen fear so strongly stamped upon a human face.  Johansen\ncalled vainly for him to come down.  At any moment he was liable to be\nsnapped off the gaff, but he was helpless with fright.  Wolf Larsen,\nwalking up and down with Smoke and in conversation, took no more notice\nof him, though he cried sharply, once, to the man at the wheel:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re off your course, my man!  Be careful, unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for\ntrouble!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the helmsman responded, putting a couple of spokes down.\n\nHe had been guilty of running the _Ghost_ several points off her course\nin order that what little wind there was should fill the foresail and\nhold it steady.  He had striven to help the unfortunate Harrison at the\nrisk of incurring Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anger.\n\nThe time went by, and the suspense, to me, was terrible.  Thomas\nMugridge, on the other hand, considered it a laughable affair, and was\ncontinually bobbing his head out the galley door to make jocose remarks.\nHow I hated him!  And how my hatred for him grew and grew, during that\nfearful time, to cyclopean dimensions.  For the first time in my life I\nexperienced the desire to murder\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009csaw red,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as some of our picturesque\nwriters phrase it.  Life in general might still be sacred, but life in\nthe particular case of Thomas Mugridge had become very profane indeed.  I\nwas frightened when I became conscious that I was seeing red, and the\nthought flashed through my mind: was I, too, becoming tainted by the\nbrutality of my environment?\u00e2\u0080\u0094I, who even in the most flagrant crimes had\ndenied the justice and righteousness of capital punishment?\n\nFully half-an-hour went by, and then I saw Johnson and Louis in some sort\nof altercation.  It ended with Johnson flinging off Louis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s detaining arm\nand starting forward.  He crossed the deck, sprang into the fore rigging,\nand began to climb.  But the quick eye of Wolf Larsen caught him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere, you, what are you up to?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried.\n\nJohnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ascent was arrested.  He looked his captain in the eyes and\nreplied slowly:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am going to get that boy down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get down out of that rigging, and damn lively about it!  D\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye\nhear?  Get down!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJohnson hesitated, but the long years of obedience to the masters of\nships overpowered him, and he dropped sullenly to the deck and went on\nforward.\n\nAt half after five I went below to set the cabin table, but I hardly knew\nwhat I did, for my eyes and my brain were filled with the vision of a\nman, white-faced and trembling, comically like a bug, clinging to the\nthrashing gaff.  At six o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, when I served supper, going on deck to\nget the food from the galley, I saw Harrison, still in the same position.\nThe conversation at the table was of other things.  Nobody seemed\ninterested in the wantonly imperilled life.  But making an extra trip to\nthe galley a little later, I was gladdened by the sight of Harrison\nstaggering weakly from the rigging to the forecastle scuttle.  He had\nfinally summoned the courage to descend.\n\nBefore closing this incident, I must give a scrap of conversation I had\nwith Wolf Larsen in the cabin, while I was washing the dishes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou were looking squeamish this afternoon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he began.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat was the\nmatter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI could see that he knew what had made me possibly as sick as Harrison,\nthat he was trying to draw me, and I answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was because of the\nbrutal treatment of that boy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe gave a short laugh.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cLike sea-sickness, I suppose.  Some men are\nsubject to it, and others are not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I objected.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he went on.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe earth is as full of brutality as the sea is\nfull of motion.  And some men are made sick by the one, and some by the\nother.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only reason.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you, who make a mock of human life, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you place any value upon\nit whatever?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I demanded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cValue?  What value?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  He looked at me, and though his eyes were steady\nand motionless, there seemed a cynical smile in them.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat kind of\nvalue?  How do you measure it?  Who values it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I made answer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen what is it worth to you?  Another man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life, I mean.  Come now,\nwhat is it worth?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe value of life?  How could I put a tangible value upon it?  Somehow,\nI, who have always had expression, lacked expression when with Wolf\nLarsen.  I have since determined that a part of it was due to the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npersonality, but that the greater part was due to his totally different\noutlook.  Unlike other materialists I had met and with whom I had\nsomething in common to start on, I had nothing in common with him.\nPerhaps, also, it was the elemental simplicity of his mind that baffled\nme.  He drove so directly to the core of the matter, divesting a question\nalways of all superfluous details, and with such an air of finality, that\nI seemed to find myself struggling in deep water, with no footing under\nme.  Value of life?  How could I answer the question on the spur of the\nmoment?  The sacredness of life I had accepted as axiomatic.  That it was\nintrinsically valuable was a truism I had never questioned.  But when he\nchallenged the truism I was speechless.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were talking about this yesterday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI held that life was a\nferment, a yeasty something which devoured life that it might live, and\nthat living was merely successful piggishness.  Why, if there is anything\nin supply and demand, life is the cheapest thing in the world.  There is\nonly so much water, so much earth, so much air; but the life that is\ndemanding to be born is limitless.  Nature is a spendthrift.  Look at the\nfish and their millions of eggs.  For that matter, look at you and me.\nIn our loins are the possibilities of millions of lives.  Could we but\nfind time and opportunity and utilize the last bit and every bit of the\nunborn life that is in us, we could become the fathers of nations and\npopulate continents.  Life?  Bah!  It has no value.  Of cheap things it\nis the cheapest.  Everywhere it goes begging.  Nature spills it out with\na lavish hand.  Where there is room for one life, she sows a thousand\nlives, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life eats life till the strongest and most piggish life\nis left.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have read Darwin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you read him misunderstandingly\nwhen you conclude that the struggle for existence sanctions your wanton\ndestruction of life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know you only mean that in relation to\nhuman life, for of the flesh and the fowl and the fish you destroy as\nmuch as I or any other man.  And human life is in no wise different,\nthough you feel it is and think that you reason why it is.  Why should I\nbe parsimonious with this life which is cheap and without value?  There\nare more sailors than there are ships on the sea for them, more workers\nthan there are factories or machines for them.  Why, you who live on the\nland know that you house your poor people in the slums of cities and\nloose famine and pestilence upon them, and that there still remain more\npoor people, dying for want of a crust of bread and a bit of meat (which\nis life destroyed), than you know what to do with.  Have you ever seen\nthe London dockers fighting like wild beasts for a chance to work?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe started for the companion stairs, but turned his head for a final\nword.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know the only value life has is what life puts upon\nitself?  And it is of course over-estimated since it is of necessity\nprejudiced in its own favour.  Take that man I had aloft.  He held on as\nif he were a precious thing, a treasure beyond diamonds or rubies.  To\nyou?  No.  To me?  Not at all.  To himself?  Yes.  But I do not accept\nhis estimate.  He sadly overrates himself.  There is plenty more life\ndemanding to be born.  Had he fallen and dripped his brains upon the deck\nlike honey from the comb, there would have been no loss to the world.  He\nwas worth nothing to the world.  The supply is too large.  To himself\nonly was he of value, and to show how fictitious even this value was,\nbeing dead he is unconscious that he has lost himself.  He alone rated\nhimself beyond diamonds and rubies.  Diamonds and rubies are gone, spread\nout on the deck to be washed away by a bucket of sea-water, and he does\nnot even know that the diamonds and rubies are gone.  He does not lose\nanything, for with the loss of himself he loses the knowledge of loss.\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see?  And what have you to say?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat you are at least consistent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was all I could say, and I went on\nwashing the dishes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nAt last, after three days of variable winds, we have caught the\nnorth-east trades.  I came on deck, after a good night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rest in spite of\nmy poor knee, to find the _Ghost_ foaming along, wing-and-wing, and every\nsail drawing except the jibs, with a fresh breeze astern.  Oh, the wonder\nof the great trade-wind!  All day we sailed, and all night, and the next\nday, and the next, day after day, the wind always astern and blowing\nsteadily and strong.  The schooner sailed herself.  There was no pulling\nand hauling on sheets and tackles, no shifting of topsails, no work at\nall for the sailors to do except to steer.  At night when the sun went\ndown, the sheets were slackened; in the morning, when they yielded up the\ndamp of the dew and relaxed, they were pulled tight again\u00e2\u0080\u0094and that was\nall.\n\nTen knots, twelve knots, eleven knots, varying from time to time, is the\nspeed we are making.  And ever out of the north-east the brave wind\nblows, driving us on our course two hundred and fifty miles between the\ndawns.  It saddens me and gladdens me, the gait with which we are leaving\nSan Francisco behind and with which we are foaming down upon the tropics.\nEach day grows perceptibly warmer.  In the second dog-watch the sailors\ncome on deck, stripped, and heave buckets of water upon one another from\noverside.  Flying-fish are beginning to be seen, and during the night the\nwatch above scrambles over the deck in pursuit of those that fall aboard.\nIn the morning, Thomas Mugridge being duly bribed, the galley is\npleasantly areek with the odour of their frying; while dolphin meat is\nserved fore and aft on such occasions as Johnson catches the blazing\nbeauties from the bowsprit end.\n\nJohnson seems to spend all his spare time there or aloft at the\ncrosstrees, watching the _Ghost_ cleaving the water under press of sail.\nThere is passion, adoration, in his eyes, and he goes about in a sort of\ntrance, gazing in ecstasy at the swelling sails, the foaming wake, and\nthe heave and the run of her over the liquid mountains that are moving\nwith us in stately procession.\n\nThe days and nights are \u00e2\u0080\u009call a wonder and a wild delight,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and though I\nhave little time from my dreary work, I steal odd moments to gaze and\ngaze at the unending glory of what I never dreamed the world possessed.\nAbove, the sky is stainless blue\u00e2\u0080\u0094blue as the sea itself, which under the\nforefoot is of the colour and sheen of azure satin.  All around the\nhorizon are pale, fleecy clouds, never changing, never moving, like a\nsilver setting for the flawless turquoise sky.\n\nI do not forget one night, when I should have been asleep, of lying on\nthe forecastle-head and gazing down at the spectral ripple of foam thrust\naside by the _Ghost\u00e2\u0080\u0099s_ forefoot.  It sounded like the gurgling of a brook\nover mossy stones in some quiet dell, and the crooning song of it lured\nme away and out of myself till I was no longer Hump the cabin-boy, nor\nVan Weyden, the man who had dreamed away thirty-five years among books.\nBut a voice behind me, the unmistakable voice of Wolf Larsen, strong with\nthe invincible certitude of the man and mellow with appreciation of the\nwords he was quoting, aroused me.\n\n   \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098O the blazing tropic night, when the wake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a welt of light\n      That holds the hot sky tame,\n   And the steady forefoot snores through the planet-powdered floors\n      Where the scared whale flukes in flame.\n   Her plates are scarred by the sun, dear lass,\n      And her ropes are taut with the dew,\n   For we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re booming down on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,\n      We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sagging south on the Long Trail\u00e2\u0080\u0094the trail that is always\n   new.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEh, Hump?  How\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it strike you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked, after the due pause which\nwords and setting demanded.\n\nI looked into his face.  It was aglow with light, as the sea itself, and\nthe eyes were flashing in the starshine.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt strikes me as remarkable, to say the least, that you should show\nenthusiasm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered coldly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, man, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s living! it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhich is a cheap thing and without value.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  I flung his words at him.\n\nHe laughed, and it was the first time I had heard honest mirth in his\nvoice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, I cannot get you to understand, cannot drive it into your head, what\na thing this life is.  Of course life is valueless, except to itself.\nAnd I can tell you that my life is pretty valuable just now\u00e2\u0080\u0094to myself.\nIt is beyond price, which you will acknowledge is a terrific overrating,\nbut which I cannot help, for it is the life that is in me that makes the\nrating.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe appeared waiting for the words with which to express the thought that\nwas in him, and finally went on.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know, I am filled with a strange uplift; I feel as if all time\nwere echoing through me, as though all powers were mine.  I know truth,\ndivine good from evil, right from wrong.  My vision is clear and far.  I\ncould almost believe in God.  But,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and his voice changed and the light\nwent out of his face,\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat is this condition in which I find myself?\nthis joy of living? this exultation of life? this inspiration, I may well\ncall it?  It is what comes when there is nothing wrong with one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndigestion, when his stomach is in trim and his appetite has an edge, and\nall goes well.  It is the bribe for living, the champagne of the blood,\nthe effervescence of the ferment\u00e2\u0080\u0094that makes some men think holy thoughts,\nand other men to see God or to create him when they cannot see him.  That\nis all, the drunkenness of life, the stirring and crawling of the yeast,\nthe babbling of the life that is insane with consciousness that it is\nalive.  And\u00e2\u0080\u0094bah!  To-morrow I shall pay for it as the drunkard pays.  And\nI shall know that I must die, at sea most likely, cease crawling of\nmyself to be all a-crawl with the corruption of the sea; to be fed upon,\nto be carrion, to yield up all the strength and movement of my muscles\nthat it may become strength and movement in fin and scale and the guts of\nfishes.  Bah!  And bah! again.  The champagne is already flat.  The\nsparkle and bubble has gone out and it is a tasteless drink.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe left me as suddenly as he had come, springing to the deck with the\nweight and softness of a tiger.  The _Ghost_ ploughed on her way.  I\nnoted the gurgling forefoot was very like a snore, and as I listened to\nit the effect of Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s swift rush from sublime exultation to\ndespair slowly left me.  Then some deep-water sailor, from the waist of\nthe ship, lifted a rich tenor voice in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSong of the Trade Wind\u00e2\u0080\u009d:\n\n   \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I am the wind the seamen love\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n      I am steady, and strong, and true;\n   They follow my track by the clouds above,\n      O\u00e2\u0080\u0099er the fathomless tropic blue.\n\n                                  * * * * *\n\n   Through daylight and dark I follow the bark\n      I keep like a hound on her trail;\n   I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m strongest at noon, yet under the moon,\n      I stiffen the bunt of her sail.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nSometimes I think Wolf Larsen mad, or half-mad at least, what of his\nstrange moods and vagaries.  At other times I take him for a great man, a\ngenius who has never arrived.  And, finally, I am convinced that he is\nthe perfect type of the primitive man, born a thousand years or\ngenerations too late and an anachronism in this culminating century of\ncivilization.  He is certainly an individualist of the most pronounced\ntype.  Not only that, but he is very lonely.  There is no congeniality\nbetween him and the rest of the men aboard ship.  His tremendous virility\nand mental strength wall him apart.  They are more like children to him,\neven the hunters, and as children he treats them, descending perforce to\ntheir level and playing with them as a man plays with puppies.  Or else\nhe probes them with the cruel hand of a vivisectionist, groping about in\ntheir mental processes and examining their souls as though to see of what\nsoul-stuff is made.\n\nI have seen him a score of times, at table, insulting this hunter or\nthat, with cool and level eyes and, withal, a certain air of interest,\npondering their actions or replies or petty rages with a curiosity almost\nlaughable to me who stood onlooker and who understood.  Concerning his\nown rages, I am convinced that they are not real, that they are sometimes\nexperiments, but that in the main they are the habits of a pose or\nattitude he has seen fit to take toward his fellow-men.  I know, with the\npossible exception of the incident of the dead mate, that I have not seen\nhim really angry; nor do I wish ever to see him in a genuine rage, when\nall the force of him is called into play.\n\nWhile on the question of vagaries, I shall tell what befell Thomas\nMugridge in the cabin, and at the same time complete an incident upon\nwhich I have already touched once or twice.  The twelve o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock dinner\nwas over, one day, and I had just finished putting the cabin in order,\nwhen Wolf Larsen and Thomas Mugridge descended the companion stairs.\nThough the cook had a cubby-hole of a state-room opening off from the\ncabin, in the cabin itself he had never dared to linger or to be seen,\nand he flitted to and fro, once or twice a day, a timid spectre.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you know how to play \u00e2\u0080\u0098Nap,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen was saying in a pleased sort\nof voice.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI might have guessed an Englishman would know.  I learned it\nmyself in English ships.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThomas Mugridge was beside himself, a blithering imbecile, so pleased was\nhe at chumming thus with the captain.  The little airs he put on and the\npainful striving to assume the easy carriage of a man born to a dignified\nplace in life would have been sickening had they not been ludicrous.  He\nquite ignored my presence, though I credited him with being simply unable\nto see me.  His pale, wishy-washy eyes were swimming like lazy summer\nseas, though what blissful visions they beheld were beyond my\nimagination.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGet the cards, Hump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen ordered, as they took seats at the\ntable.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd bring out the cigars and the whisky you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find in my\nberth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI returned with the articles in time to hear the Cockney hinting broadly\nthat there was a mystery about him, that he might be a gentleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son\ngone wrong or something or other; also, that he was a remittance man and\nwas paid to keep away from England\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cp\u00e2\u0080\u0099yed \u00e2\u0080\u0099ansomely, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the way he\nput it; \u00e2\u0080\u009cp\u00e2\u0080\u0099yed \u00e2\u0080\u0099ansomely to sling my \u00e2\u0080\u0099ook an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 keep slingin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI had brought the customary liquor glasses, but Wolf Larsen frowned,\nshook his head, and signalled with his hands for me to bring the\ntumblers.  These he filled two-thirds full with undiluted whisky\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009ca\ngentleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drink?\u00e2\u0080\u009d quoth Thomas Mugridge,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and they clinked their glasses\nto the glorious game of \u00e2\u0080\u009cNap,\u00e2\u0080\u009d lighted cigars, and fell to shuffling and\ndealing the cards.\n\nThey played for money.  They increased the amounts of the bets.  They\ndrank whisky, they drank it neat, and I fetched more.  I do not know\nwhether Wolf Larsen cheated or not,\u00e2\u0080\u0094a thing he was thoroughly capable of\ndoing,\u00e2\u0080\u0094but he won steadily.  The cook made repeated journeys to his bunk\nfor money.  Each time he performed the journey with greater swagger, but\nhe never brought more than a few dollars at a time.  He grew maudlin,\nfamiliar, could hardly see the cards or sit upright.  As a preliminary to\nanother journey to his bunk, he hooked Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s buttonhole with a\ngreasy forefinger and vacuously proclaimed and reiterated, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI got money,\nI got money, I tell yer, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a gentleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWolf Larsen was unaffected by the drink, yet he drank glass for glass,\nand if anything his glasses were fuller.  There was no change in him.  He\ndid not appear even amused at the other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s antics.\n\nIn the end, with loud protestations that he could lose like a gentleman,\nthe cook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last money was staked on the game\u00e2\u0080\u0094and lost.  Whereupon he\nleaned his head on his hands and wept.  Wolf Larsen looked curiously at\nhim, as though about to probe and vivisect him, then changed his mind, as\nfrom the foregone conclusion that there was nothing there to probe.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to me, elaborately polite, \u00e2\u0080\u009ckindly take Mr. Mugridge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\narm and help him up on deck.  He is not feeling very well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd tell Johnson to douse him with a few buckets of salt water,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nadded, in a lower tone for my ear alone.\n\nI left Mr. Mugridge on deck, in the hands of a couple of grinning sailors\nwho had been told off for the purpose.  Mr. Mugridge was sleepily\nspluttering that he was a gentleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son.  But as I descended the\ncompanion stairs to clear the table I heard him shriek as the first\nbucket of water struck him.\n\nWolf Larsen was counting his winnings.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne hundred and eighty-five dollars even,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said aloud.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust as I\nthought.  The beggar came aboard without a cent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what you have won is mine, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said boldly.\n\nHe favoured me with a quizzical smile.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHump, I have studied some\ngrammar in my time, and I think your tenses are tangled.  \u00e2\u0080\u0098Was mine,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 you\nshould have said, not \u00e2\u0080\u0099is mine.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a question, not of grammar, but of ethics,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered.\n\nIt was possibly a minute before he spoke.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cD\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye know, Hump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, with a slow seriousness which had in it an\nindefinable strain of sadness, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat this is the first time I have heard\nthe word \u00e2\u0080\u0098ethics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in the mouth of a man.  You and I are the only men on\nthis ship who know its meaning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt one time in my life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, after another pause, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI dreamed\nthat I might some day talk with men who used such language, that I might\nlift myself out of the place in life in which I had been born, and hold\nconversation and mingle with men who talked about just such things as\nethics.  And this is the first time I have ever heard the word\npronounced.  Which is all by the way, for you are wrong.  It is a\nquestion neither of grammar nor ethics, but of fact.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fact is that you have the money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis face brightened.  He seemed pleased at my perspicacity.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it is\navoiding the real question,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich is one of right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he remarked, with a wry pucker of his mouth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI see you still\nbelieve in such things as right and wrong.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u0094at all?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I demanded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot the least bit.  Might is right, and that is all there is to it.\nWeakness is wrong.  Which is a very poor way of saying that it is good\nfor oneself to be strong, and evil for oneself to be weak\u00e2\u0080\u0094or better yet,\nit is pleasurable to be strong, because of the profits; painful to be\nweak, because of the penalties.  Just now the possession of this money is\na pleasurable thing.  It is good for one to possess it.  Being able to\npossess it, I wrong myself and the life that is in me if I give it to you\nand forego the pleasure of possessing it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you wrong me by withholding it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I objected.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot at all.  One man cannot wrong another man.  He can only wrong\nhimself.  As I see it, I do wrong always when I consider the interests of\nothers.  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see?  How can two particles of the yeast wrong each\nother by striving to devour each other?  It is their inborn heritage to\nstrive to devour, and to strive not to be devoured.  When they depart\nfrom this they sin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe in altruism?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\nHe received the word as if it had a familiar ring, though he pondered it\nthoughtfully.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me see, it means something about co\u00c3\u00b6peration, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nit?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, in a way there has come to be a sort of connection,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered\nunsurprised by this time at such gaps in his vocabulary, which, like his\nknowledge, was the acquirement of a self-read, self-educated man, whom no\none had directed in his studies, and who had thought much and talked\nlittle or not at all.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAn altruistic act is an act performed for the\nwelfare of others.  It is unselfish, as opposed to an act performed for\nself, which is selfish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe nodded his head.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes, I remember it now.  I ran across it in\nSpencer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSpencer!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you read him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot very much,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was his confession.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI understood quite a good deal of\n_First Principles_, but his _Biology_ took the wind out of my sails, and\nhis _Psychology_ left me butting around in the doldrums for many a day.\nI honestly could not understand what he was driving at.  I put it down to\nmental deficiency on my part, but since then I have decided that it was\nfor want of preparation.  I had no proper basis.  Only Spencer and myself\nknow how hard I hammered.  But I did get something out of his _Data of\nEthics_.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where I ran across \u00e2\u0080\u0098altruism,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and I remember now how\nit was used.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI wondered what this man could have got from such a work.  Spencer I\nremembered enough to know that altruism was imperative to his ideal of\nhighest conduct.  Wolf Larsen, evidently, had sifted the great\nphilosopher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s teachings, rejecting and selecting according to his needs\nand desires.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat else did you run across?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\nHis brows drew in slightly with the mental effort of suitably phrasing\nthoughts which he had never before put into speech.  I felt an elation of\nspirit.  I was groping into his soul-stuff as he made a practice of\ngroping in the soul-stuff of others.  I was exploring virgin territory.\nA strange, a terribly strange, region was unrolling itself before my\neyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn as few words as possible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he began, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpencer puts it something like\nthis: First, a man must act for his own benefit\u00e2\u0080\u0094to do this is to be moral\nand good.  Next, he must act for the benefit of his children.  And third,\nhe must act for the benefit of his race.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the highest, finest, right conduct,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I interjected, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis that act\nwhich benefits at the same time the man, his children, and his race.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand for that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cCouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see the necessity for\nit, nor the common sense.  I cut out the race and the children.  I would\nsacrifice nothing for them.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just so much slush and sentiment, and\nyou must see it yourself, at least for one who does not believe in\neternal life.  With immortality before me, altruism would be a paying\nbusiness proposition.  I might elevate my soul to all kinds of altitudes.\nBut with nothing eternal before me but death, given for a brief spell\nthis yeasty crawling and squirming which is called life, why, it would be\nimmoral for me to perform any act that was a sacrifice.  Any sacrifice\nthat makes me lose one crawl or squirm is foolish,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and not only foolish,\nfor it is a wrong against myself and a wicked thing.  I must not lose one\ncrawl or squirm if I am to get the most out of the ferment.  Nor will the\neternal movelessness that is coming to me be made easier or harder by the\nsacrifices or selfishnesses of the time when I was yeasty and acrawl.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you are an individualist, a materialist, and, logically, a\nhedonist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBig words,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he smiled.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what is a hedonist?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe nodded agreement when I had given the definition.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you are also,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nI continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca man one could not trust in the least thing where it was\npossible for a selfish interest to intervene?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re beginning to understand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, brightening.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a man utterly without what the world calls morals?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA man of whom to be always afraid\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the way to put it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs one is afraid of a snake, or a tiger, or a shark?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow you know me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you know me as I am generally known.\nOther men call me \u00e2\u0080\u0098Wolf.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a sort of monster,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I added audaciously, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca Caliban who has\npondered Setebos, and who acts as you act, in idle moments, by whim and\nfancy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis brow clouded at the allusion.  He did not understand, and I quickly\nlearned that he did not know the poem.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just reading Browning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he confessed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty tough.  I\nhaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got very far along, and as it is I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve about lost my bearings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNot to be tiresome, I shall say that I fetched the book from his\nstate-room and read \u00e2\u0080\u009cCaliban\u00e2\u0080\u009d aloud.  He was delighted.  It was a\nprimitive mode of reasoning and of looking at things that he understood\nthoroughly.  He interrupted again and again with comment and criticism.\nWhen I finished, he had me read it over a second time, and a third.  We\nfell into discussion\u00e2\u0080\u0094philosophy, science, evolution, religion.  He\nbetrayed the inaccuracies of the self-read man, and, it must be granted,\nthe sureness and directness of the primitive mind.  The very simplicity\nof his reasoning was its strength, and his materialism was far more\ncompelling than the subtly complex materialism of Charley Furuseth.  Not\nthat I\u00e2\u0080\u0094a confirmed and, as Furuseth phrased it, a temperamental\nidealist\u00e2\u0080\u0094was to be compelled; but that Wolf Larsen stormed the last\nstrongholds of my faith with a vigour that received respect, while not\naccorded conviction.\n\nTime passed.  Supper was at hand and the table not laid.  I became\nrestless and anxious, and when Thomas Mugridge glared down the\ncompanion-way, sick and angry of countenance, I prepared to go about my\nduties.  But Wolf Larsen cried out to him:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCooky, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to hustle to-night.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m busy with Hump, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do\nthe best you can without him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd again the unprecedented was established.  That night I sat at table\nwith the captain and the hunters, while Thomas Mugridge waited on us and\nwashed the dishes afterward\u00e2\u0080\u0094a whim, a Caliban-mood of Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and\none I foresaw would bring me trouble.  In the meantime we talked and\ntalked, much to the disgust of the hunters, who could not understand a\nword.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nThree days of rest, three blessed days of rest, are what I had with Wolf\nLarsen, eating at the cabin table and doing nothing but discuss life,\nliterature, and the universe, the while Thomas Mugridge fumed and raged\nand did my work as well as his own.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWatch out for squalls, is all I can say to you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was Louis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s warning,\ngiven during a spare half-hour on deck while Wolf Larsen was engaged in\nstraightening out a row among the hunters.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell what\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be happenin\u00e2\u0080\u0099,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Louis went on, in response to my\nquery for more definite information.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as contrary as air\ncurrents or water currents.  You can never guess the ways iv him.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis\njust as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinkin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 you know him and are makin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a favourable slant\nalong him, that he whirls around, dead ahead and comes howlin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 down upon\nyou and a-rippin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 all iv your fine-weather sails to rags.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo I was not altogether surprised when the squall foretold by Louis smote\nme.  We had been having a heated discussion,\u00e2\u0080\u0094upon life, of course,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and,\ngrown over-bold, I was passing stiff strictures upon Wolf Larsen and the\nlife of Wolf Larsen.  In fact, I was vivisecting him and turning over his\nsoul-stuff as keenly and thoroughly as it was his custom to do it to\nothers.  It may be a weakness of mine that I have an incisive way of\nspeech; but I threw all restraint to the winds and cut and slashed until\nthe whole man of him was snarling.  The dark sun-bronze of his face went\nblack with wrath, his eyes were ablaze.  There was no clearness or sanity\nin them\u00e2\u0080\u0094nothing but the terrific rage of a madman.  It was the wolf in\nhim that I saw, and a mad wolf at that.\n\nHe sprang for me with a half-roar, gripping my arm.  I had steeled myself\nto brazen it out, though I was trembling inwardly; but the enormous\nstrength of the man was too much for my fortitude.  He had gripped me by\nthe biceps with his single hand, and when that grip tightened I wilted\nand shrieked aloud.  My feet went out from under me.  I simply could not\nstand upright and endure the agony.  The muscles refused their duty.  The\npain was too great.  My biceps was being crushed to a pulp.\n\nHe seemed to recover himself, for a lucid gleam came into his eyes, and\nhe relaxed his hold with a short laugh that was more like a growl.  I\nfell to the floor, feeling very faint, while he sat down, lighted a\ncigar, and watched me as a cat watches a mouse.  As I writhed about I\ncould see in his eyes that curiosity I had so often noted, that wonder\nand perplexity, that questing, that everlasting query of his as to what\nit was all about.\n\nI finally crawled to my feet and ascended the companion stairs.  Fair\nweather was over, and there was nothing left but to return to the galley.\nMy left arm was numb, as though paralysed, and days passed before I could\nuse it, while weeks went by before the last stiffness and pain went out\nof it.  And he had done nothing but put his hand upon my arm and squeeze.\nThere had been no wrenching or jerking.  He had just closed his hand with\na steady pressure.  What he might have done I did not fully realize till\nnext day, when he put his head into the galley, and, as a sign of renewed\nfriendliness, asked me how my arm was getting on.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt might have been worse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he smiled.\n\nI was peeling potatoes.  He picked one up from the pan.  It was\nfair-sized, firm, and unpeeled.  He closed his hand upon it, squeezed,\nand the potato squirted out between his fingers in mushy streams.  The\npulpy remnant he dropped back into the pan and turned away, and I had a\nsharp vision of how it might have fared with me had the monster put his\nreal strength upon me.\n\nBut the three days\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rest was good in spite of it all, for it had given my\nknee the very chance it needed.  It felt much better, the swelling had\nmaterially decreased, and the cap seemed descending into its proper\nplace.  Also, the three days\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rest brought the trouble I had foreseen.\nIt was plainly Thomas Mugridge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intention to make me pay for those three\ndays.  He treated me vilely, cursed me continually, and heaped his own\nwork upon me.  He even ventured to raise his fist to me, but I was\nbecoming animal-like myself, and I snarled in his face so terribly that\nit must have frightened him back.  It is no pleasant picture I can\nconjure up of myself, Humphrey Van Weyden, in that noisome ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s galley,\ncrouched in a corner over my task, my face raised to the face of the\ncreature about to strike me, my lips lifted and snarling like a dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, my\neyes gleaming with fear and helplessness and the courage that comes of\nfear and helplessness.  I do not like the picture.  It reminds me too\nstrongly of a rat in a trap.  I do not care to think of it; but it was\nelective, for the threatened blow did not descend.\n\nThomas Mugridge backed away, glaring as hatefully and viciously as I\nglared.  A pair of beasts is what we were, penned together and showing\nour teeth.  He was a coward, afraid to strike me because I had not\nquailed sufficiently in advance; so he chose a new way to intimidate me.\nThere was only one galley knife that, as a knife, amounted to anything.\nThis, through many years of service and wear, had acquired a long, lean\nblade.  It was unusually cruel-looking, and at first I had shuddered\nevery time I used it.  The cook borrowed a stone from Johansen and\nproceeded to sharpen the knife.  He did it with great ostentation,\nglancing significantly at me the while.  He whetted it up and down all\nday long.  Every odd moment he could find he had the knife and stone out\nand was whetting away.  The steel acquired a razor edge.  He tried it\nwith the ball of his thumb or across the nail.  He shaved hairs from the\nback of his hand, glanced along the edge with microscopic acuteness, and\nfound, or feigned that he found, always, a slight inequality in its edge\nsomewhere.  Then he would put it on the stone again and whet, whet, whet,\ntill I could have laughed aloud, it was so very ludicrous.\n\nIt was also serious, for I learned that he was capable of using it, that\nunder all his cowardice there was a courage of cowardice, like mine, that\nwould impel him to do the very thing his whole nature protested against\ndoing and was afraid of doing.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cCooky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sharpening his knife for Hump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nwas being whispered about among the sailors, and some of them twitted him\nabout it.  This he took in good part, and was really pleased, nodding his\nhead with direful foreknowledge and mystery, until George Leach, the\nerstwhile cabin-boy, ventured some rough pleasantry on the subject.\n\nNow it happened that Leach was one of the sailors told off to douse\nMugridge after his game of cards with the captain.  Leach had evidently\ndone his task with a thoroughness that Mugridge had not forgiven, for\nwords followed and evil names involving smirched ancestries.  Mugridge\nmenaced with the knife he was sharpening for me.  Leach laughed and\nhurled more of his Telegraph Hill Billingsgate, and before either he or I\nknew what had happened, his right arm had been ripped open from elbow to\nwrist by a quick slash of the knife.  The cook backed away, a fiendish\nexpression on his face, the knife held before him in a position of\ndefence.  But Leach took it quite calmly, though blood was spouting upon\nthe deck as generously as water from a fountain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to get you, Cooky,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get you hard.  And I\nwon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be in no hurry about it.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be without that knife when I come\nfor you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he turned and walked quietly forward.  Mugridge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face was\nlivid with fear at what he had done and at what he might expect sooner or\nlater from the man he had stabbed.  But his demeanour toward me was more\nferocious than ever.  In spite of his fear at the reckoning he must\nexpect to pay for what he had done, he could see that it had been an\nobject-lesson to me, and he became more domineering and exultant.  Also\nthere was a lust in him, akin to madness, which had come with sight of\nthe blood he had drawn.  He was beginning to see red in whatever\ndirection he looked.  The psychology of it is sadly tangled, and yet I\ncould read the workings of his mind as clearly as though it were a\nprinted book.\n\nSeveral days went by, the _Ghost_ still foaming down the trades, and I\ncould swear I saw madness growing in Thomas Mugridge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes.  And I\nconfess that I became afraid, very much afraid.  Whet, whet, whet, it\nwent all day long.  The look in his eyes as he felt the keen edge and\nglared at me was positively carnivorous.  I was afraid to turn my\nshoulder to him, and when I left the galley I went out backwards\u00e2\u0080\u0094to the\namusement of the sailors and hunters, who made a point of gathering in\ngroups to witness my exit.  The strain was too great.  I sometimes\nthought my mind would give way under it\u00e2\u0080\u0094a meet thing on this ship of\nmadmen and brutes.  Every hour, every minute of my existence was in\njeopardy.  I was a human soul in distress, and yet no soul, fore or aft,\nbetrayed sufficient sympathy to come to my aid.  At times I thought of\nthrowing myself on the mercy of Wolf Larsen, but the vision of the\nmocking devil in his eyes that questioned life and sneered at it would\ncome strong upon me and compel me to refrain.  At other times I seriously\ncontemplated suicide, and the whole force of my hopeful philosophy was\nrequired to keep me from going over the side in the darkness of night.\n\nSeveral times Wolf Larsen tried to inveigle me into discussion, but I\ngave him short answers and eluded him.  Finally, he commanded me to\nresume my seat at the cabin table for a time and let the cook do my work.\nThen I spoke frankly, telling him what I was enduring from Thomas\nMugridge because of the three days of favouritism which had been shown\nme.  Wolf Larsen regarded me with smiling eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re afraid, eh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he sneered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said defiantly and honestly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am afraid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the way with you fellows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, half angrily,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009csentimentalizing about your immortal souls and afraid to die.  At sight\nof a sharp knife and a cowardly Cockney the clinging of life to life\novercomes all your fond foolishness.  Why, my dear fellow, you will live\nfor ever.  You are a god, and God cannot be killed.  Cooky cannot hurt\nyou.  You are sure of your resurrection.  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there to be afraid of?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have eternal life before you.  You are a millionaire in immortality,\nand a millionaire whose fortune cannot be lost, whose fortune is less\nperishable than the stars and as lasting as space or time.  It is\nimpossible for you to diminish your principal.  Immortality is a thing\nwithout beginning or end.  Eternity is eternity, and though you die here\nand now you will go on living somewhere else and hereafter.  And it is\nall very beautiful, this shaking off of the flesh and soaring of the\nimprisoned spirit.  Cooky cannot hurt you.  He can only give you a boost\non the path you eternally must tread.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOr, if you do not wish to be boosted just yet, why not boost Cooky?\nAccording to your ideas, he, too, must be an immortal millionaire.  You\ncannot bankrupt him.  His paper will always circulate at par.  You cannot\ndiminish the length of his living by killing him, for he is without\nbeginning or end.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bound to go on living, somewhere, somehow.  Then\nboost him.  Stick a knife in him and let his spirit free.  As it is, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nin a nasty prison, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do him only a kindness by breaking down the\ndoor.  And who knows?\u00e2\u0080\u0094it may be a very beautiful spirit that will go\nsoaring up into the blue from that ugly carcass.  Boost him along, and\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll promote you to his place, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting forty-five dollars a\nmonth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was plain that I could look for no help or mercy from Wolf Larsen.\nWhatever was to be done I must do for myself; and out of the courage of\nfear I evolved the plan of fighting Thomas Mugridge with his own weapons.\nI borrowed a whetstone from Johansen.  Louis, the boat-steerer, had\nalready begged me for condensed milk and sugar.  The lazarette, where\nsuch delicacies were stored, was situated beneath the cabin floor.\nWatching my chance, I stole five cans of the milk, and that night, when\nit was Louis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s watch on deck, I traded them with him for a dirk as lean\nand cruel-looking as Thomas Mugridge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vegetable knife.  It was rusty and\ndull, but I turned the grindstone while Louis gave it an edge.  I slept\nmore soundly than usual that night.\n\nNext morning, after breakfast, Thomas Mugridge began his whet, whet,\nwhet.  I glanced warily at him, for I was on my knees taking the ashes\nfrom the stove.  When I returned from throwing them overside, he was\ntalking to Harrison, whose honest yokel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face was filled with\nfascination and wonder.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mugridge was saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009can\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wot does \u00e2\u0080\u0099is worship do but give me two\nyears in Reading.  But blimey if I cared.  The other mug was fixed\nplenty.  Should \u00e2\u0080\u0099a seen \u00e2\u0080\u0099im.  Knife just like this.  I stuck it in, like\ninto soft butter, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the w\u00e2\u0080\u0099y \u00e2\u0080\u0099e squealed was better\u00e2\u0080\u0099n a tu-penny gaff.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe shot a glance in my direction to see if I was taking it in, and went\non.  \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean it Tommy,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0099e was snifflin\u00e2\u0080\u0099; \u00e2\u0080\u0098so \u00e2\u0080\u0099elp me Gawd, I\ndidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean it!\u00e2\u0080\u0099  \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll fix yer bloody well right,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I sez, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 kept right\nafter \u00e2\u0080\u0099im.  I cut \u00e2\u0080\u0099im in ribbons, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wot I did, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0099e a-squealin\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nall the time.  Once \u00e2\u0080\u0099e got \u00e2\u0080\u0099is \u00e2\u0080\u0099and on the knife an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tried to \u00e2\u0080\u0099old it.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ad \u00e2\u0080\u0099is fingers around it, but I pulled it through, cuttin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to the bone.\nO, \u00e2\u0080\u0099e was a sight, I can tell yer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA call from the mate interrupted the gory narrative, and Harrison went\naft.  Mugridge sat down on the raised threshold to the galley and went on\nwith his knife-sharpening.  I put the shovel away and calmly sat down on\nthe coal-box facing him.  He favoured me with a vicious stare.  Still\ncalmly, though my heart was going pitapat, I pulled out Louis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dirk and\nbegan to whet it on the stone.  I had looked for almost any sort of\nexplosion on the Cockney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part, but to my surprise he did not appear\naware of what I was doing.  He went on whetting his knife.  So did I.\nAnd for two hours we sat there, face to face, whet, whet, whet, till the\nnews of it spread abroad and half the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s company was crowding the\ngalley doors to see the sight.\n\nEncouragement and advice were freely tendered, and Jock Horner, the\nquiet, self-spoken hunter who looked as though he would not harm a mouse,\nadvised me to leave the ribs alone and to thrust upward for the abdomen,\nat the same time giving what he called the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpanish twist\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the blade.\nLeach, his bandaged arm prominently to the fore, begged me to leave a few\nremnants of the cook for him; and Wolf Larsen paused once or twice at the\nbreak of the poop to glance curiously at what must have been to him a\nstirring and crawling of the yeasty thing he knew as life.\n\nAnd I make free to say that for the time being life assumed the same\nsordid values to me.  There was nothing pretty about it, nothing\ndivine\u00e2\u0080\u0094only two cowardly moving things that sat whetting steel upon\nstone, and a group of other moving things, cowardly and otherwise, that\nlooked on.  Half of them, I am sure, were anxious to see us shedding each\nother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blood.  It would have been entertainment.  And I do not think\nthere was one who would have interfered had we closed in a\ndeath-struggle.\n\nOn the other hand, the whole thing was laughable and childish.  Whet,\nwhet, whet,\u00e2\u0080\u0094Humphrey Van Weyden sharpening his knife in a ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s galley\nand trying its edge with his thumb!  Of all situations this was the most\ninconceivable.  I know that my own kind could not have believed it\npossible.  I had not been called \u00e2\u0080\u009cSissy\u00e2\u0080\u009d Van Weyden all my days without\nreason, and that \u00e2\u0080\u009cSissy\u00e2\u0080\u009d Van Weyden should be capable of doing this thing\nwas a revelation to Humphrey Van Weyden, who knew not whether to be\nexultant or ashamed.\n\nBut nothing happened.  At the end of two hours Thomas Mugridge put away\nknife and stone and held out his hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the good of mykin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a \u00e2\u0080\u0099oly show of ourselves for them mugs?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\ndemanded.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t love us, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 bloody well glad they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be a-seein\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nus cuttin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 our throats.  Yer not \u00e2\u0080\u0099arf bad, \u00e2\u0080\u0099Ump!  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got spunk, as\nyou Yanks s\u00e2\u0080\u0099y, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I like yer in a w\u00e2\u0080\u0099y.  So come on an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 shyke.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCoward that I might be, I was less a coward than he.  It was a distinct\nvictory I had gained, and I refused to forego any of it by shaking his\ndetestable hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said pridelessly, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctyke it or leave it, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll like yer\nnone the less for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And to save his face he turned fiercely upon the\nonlookers.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cGet outa my galley-doors, you bloomin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 swabs!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis command was reinforced by a steaming kettle of water, and at sight\nof it the sailors scrambled out of the way.  This was a sort of victory\nfor Thomas Mugridge, and enabled him to accept more gracefully the defeat\nI had given him, though, of course, he was too discreet to attempt to\ndrive the hunters away.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see Cooky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finish,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I heard Smoke say to Horner.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou bet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the reply.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHump runs the galley from now on, and Cooky\npulls in his horns.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMugridge heard and shot a swift glance at me, but I gave no sign that the\nconversation had reached me.  I had not thought my victory was so\nfar-reaching and complete, but I resolved to let go nothing I had gained.\nAs the days went by, Smoke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prophecy was verified.  The Cockney became\nmore humble and slavish to me than even to Wolf Larsen.  I mistered him\nand sirred him no longer, washed no more greasy pots, and peeled no more\npotatoes.  I did my own work, and my own work only, and when and in what\nfashion I saw fit.  Also I carried the dirk in a sheath at my hip,\nsailor-fashion, and maintained toward Thomas Mugridge a constant attitude\nwhich was composed of equal parts of domineering, insult, and contempt.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nMy intimacy with Wolf Larsen increases\u00e2\u0080\u0094if by intimacy may be denoted\nthose relations which exist between master and man, or, better yet,\nbetween king and jester.  I am to him no more than a toy, and he values\nme no more than a child values a toy.  My function is to amuse, and so\nlong as I amuse all goes well; but let him become bored, or let him have\none of his black moods come upon him, and at once I am relegated from\ncabin table to galley, while, at the same time, I am fortunate to escape\nwith my life and a whole body.\n\nThe loneliness of the man is slowly being borne in upon me.  There is not\na man aboard but hates or fears him, nor is there a man whom he does not\ndespise.  He seems consuming with the tremendous power that is in him and\nthat seems never to have found adequate expression in works.  He is as\nLucifer would be, were that proud spirit banished to a society of\nsoulless, Tomlinsonian ghosts.\n\nThis loneliness is bad enough in itself, but, to make it worse, he is\noppressed by the primal melancholy of the race.  Knowing him, I review\nthe old Scandinavian myths with clearer understanding.  The\nwhite-skinned, fair-haired savages who created that terrible pantheon\nwere of the same fibre as he.  The frivolity of the laughter-loving\nLatins is no part of him.  When he laughs it is from a humour that is\nnothing else than ferocious.  But he laughs rarely; he is too often sad.\nAnd it is a sadness as deep-reaching as the roots of the race.  It is the\nrace heritage, the sadness which has made the race sober-minded,\nclean-lived and fanatically moral, and which, in this latter connection,\nhas culminated among the English in the Reformed Church and Mrs. Grundy.\n\nIn point of fact, the chief vent to this primal melancholy has been\nreligion in its more agonizing forms.  But the compensations of such\nreligion are denied Wolf Larsen.  His brutal materialism will not permit\nit.  So, when his blue moods come on, nothing remains for him, but to be\ndevilish.  Were he not so terrible a man, I could sometimes feel sorry\nfor him, as instance three mornings ago, when I went into his stateroom\nto fill his water-bottle and came unexpectedly upon him.  He did not see\nme.  His head was buried in his hands, and his shoulders were heaving\nconvulsively as with sobs.  He seemed torn by some mighty grief.  As I\nsoftly withdrew I could hear him groaning, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod!  God!  God!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Not that\nhe was calling upon God; it was a mere expletive, but it came from his\nsoul.\n\nAt dinner he asked the hunters for a remedy for headache, and by evening,\nstrong man that he was, he was half-blind and reeling about the cabin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never been sick in my life, Hump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, as I guided him to his\nroom.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNor did I ever have a headache except the time my head was\nhealing after having been laid open for six inches by a capstan-bar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor three days this blinding headache lasted, and he suffered as wild\nanimals suffer, as it seemed the way on ship to suffer, without plaint,\nwithout sympathy, utterly alone.\n\nThis morning, however, on entering his state-room to make the bed and put\nthings in order, I found him well and hard at work.  Table and bunk were\nlittered with designs and calculations.  On a large transparent sheet,\ncompass and square in hand, he was copying what appeared to be a scale of\nsome sort or other.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHello, Hump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he greeted me genially.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just finishing the finishing\ntouches.  Want to see it work?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA labour-saving device for mariners, navigation reduced to kindergarten\nsimplicity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered gaily.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom to-day a child will be able to\nnavigate a ship.  No more long-winded calculations.  All you need is one\nstar in the sky on a dirty night to know instantly where you are.  Look.\nI place the transparent scale on this star-map, revolving the scale on\nthe North Pole.  On the scale I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve worked out the circles of altitude and\nthe lines of bearing.  All I do is to put it on a star, revolve the scale\ntill it is opposite those figures on the map underneath, and presto!\nthere you are, the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s precise location!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was a ring of triumph in his voice, and his eyes, clear blue this\nmorning as the sea, were sparkling with light.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must be well up in mathematics,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere did you go to\nschool?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever saw the inside of one, worse luck,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the answer.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had to dig\nit out for myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd why do you think I have made this thing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he demanded, abruptly.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDreaming to leave footprints on the sands of time?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  He laughed one of\nhis horrible mocking laughs.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot at all.  To get it patented, to make\nmoney from it, to revel in piggishness with all night in while other men\ndo the work.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my purpose.  Also, I have enjoyed working it out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe creative joy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I murmured.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI guess that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what it ought to be called.  Which is another way of\nexpressing the joy of life in that it is alive, the triumph of movement\nover matter, of the quick over the dead, the pride of the yeast because\nit is yeast and crawls.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI threw up my hands with helpless disapproval of his inveterate\nmaterialism and went about making the bed.  He continued copying lines\nand figures upon the transparent scale.  It was a task requiring the\nutmost nicety and precision, and I could not but admire the way he\ntempered his strength to the fineness and delicacy of the need.\n\nWhen I had finished the bed, I caught myself looking at him in a\nfascinated sort of way.  He was certainly a handsome man\u00e2\u0080\u0094beautiful in the\nmasculine sense.  And again, with never-failing wonder, I remarked the\ntotal lack of viciousness, or wickedness, or sinfulness in his face.  It\nwas the face, I am convinced, of a man who did no wrong.  And by this I\ndo not wish to be misunderstood.  What I mean is that it was the face of\na man who either did nothing contrary to the dictates of his conscience,\nor who had no conscience.  I am inclined to the latter way of accounting\nfor it.  He was a magnificent atavism, a man so purely primitive that he\nwas of the type that came into the world before the development of the\nmoral nature.  He was not immoral, but merely unmoral.\n\nAs I have said, in the masculine sense his was a beautiful face.\nSmooth-shaven, every line was distinct, and it was cut as clear and sharp\nas a cameo; while sea and sun had tanned the naturally fair skin to a\ndark bronze which bespoke struggle and battle and added both to his\nsavagery and his beauty.  The lips were full, yet possessed of the\nfirmness, almost harshness, which is characteristic of thin lips.  The\nset of his mouth, his chin, his jaw, was likewise firm or harsh, with all\nthe fierceness and indomitableness of the male\u00e2\u0080\u0094the nose also.  It was the\nnose of a being born to conquer and command.  It just hinted of the eagle\nbeak.  It might have been Grecian, it might have been Roman, only it was\na shade too massive for the one, a shade too delicate for the other.  And\nwhile the whole face was the incarnation of fierceness and strength, the\nprimal melancholy from which he suffered seemed to greaten the lines of\nmouth and eye and brow, seemed to give a largeness and completeness which\notherwise the face would have lacked.\n\nAnd so I caught myself standing idly and studying him.  I cannot say how\ngreatly the man had come to interest me.  Who was he?  What was he?  How\nhad he happened to be?  All powers seemed his, all potentialities\u00e2\u0080\u0094why,\nthen, was he no more than the obscure master of a seal-hunting schooner\nwith a reputation for frightful brutality amongst the men who hunted\nseals?\n\nMy curiosity burst from me in a flood of speech.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy is it that you have not done great things in this world?  With the\npower that is yours you might have risen to any height.  Unpossessed of\nconscience or moral instinct, you might have mastered the world, broken\nit to your hand.  And yet here you are, at the top of your life, where\ndiminishing and dying begin, living an obscure and sordid existence,\nhunting sea animals for the satisfaction of woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vanity and love of\ndecoration, revelling in a piggishness, to use your own words, which is\nanything and everything except splendid.  Why, with all that wonderful\nstrength, have you not done something?  There was nothing to stop you,\nnothing that could stop you.  What was wrong?  Did you lack ambition?\nDid you fall under temptation?  What was the matter?  What was the\nmatter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe had lifted his eyes to me at the commencement of my outburst, and\nfollowed me complacently until I had done and stood before him breathless\nand dismayed.  He waited a moment, as though seeking where to begin, and\nthen said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHump, do you know the parable of the sower who went forth to sow?  If\nyou will remember, some of the seed fell upon stony places, where there\nwas not much earth, and forthwith they sprung up because they had no\ndeepness of earth.  And when the sun was up they were scorched, and\nbecause they had no root they withered away.  And some fell among thorns,\nand the thorns sprung up and choked them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he queried, half petulantly.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was not well.  I was one of\nthose seeds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe dropped his head to the scale and resumed the copying.  I finished my\nwork and had opened the door to leave, when he spoke to me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHump, if you will look on the west coast of the map of Norway you will\nsee an indentation called Romsdal Fiord.  I was born within a hundred\nmiles of that stretch of water.  But I was not born Norwegian.  I am a\nDane.  My father and mother were Danes, and how they ever came to that\nbleak bight of land on the west coast I do not know.  I never heard.\nOutside of that there is nothing mysterious.  They were poor people and\nunlettered.  They came of generations of poor unlettered people\u00e2\u0080\u0094peasants\nof the sea who sowed their sons on the waves as has been their custom\nsince time began.  There is no more to tell.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut there is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I objected.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is still obscure to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat can I tell you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he demanded, with a recrudescence of fierceness.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf the meagreness of a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life? of fish diet and coarse living? of\ngoing out with the boats from the time I could crawl? of my brothers, who\nwent away one by one to the deep-sea farming and never came back? of\nmyself, unable to read or write, cabin-boy at the mature age of ten on\nthe coastwise, old-country ships? of the rough fare and rougher usage,\nwhere kicks and blows were bed and breakfast and took the place of\nspeech, and fear and hatred and pain were my only soul-experiences?  I do\nnot care to remember.  A madness comes up in my brain even now as I think\nof it.  But there were coastwise skippers I would have returned and\nkilled when a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strength came to me, only the lines of my life were\ncast at the time in other places.  I did return, not long ago, but\nunfortunately the skippers were dead, all but one, a mate in the old\ndays, a skipper when I met him, and when I left him a cripple who would\nnever walk again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you who read Spencer and Darwin and have never seen the inside of a\nschool, how did you learn to read and write?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I queried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the English merchant service.  Cabin-boy at twelve, ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy at\nfourteen, ordinary seamen at sixteen, able seaman at seventeen, and cock\nof the fo\u00e2\u0080\u0099c\u00e2\u0080\u0099sle, infinite ambition and infinite loneliness, receiving\nneither help nor sympathy, I did it all for myself\u00e2\u0080\u0094navigation,\nmathematics, science, literature, and what not.  And of what use has it\nbeen?  Master and owner of a ship at the top of my life, as you say, when\nI am beginning to diminish and die.  Paltry, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?  And when the sun\nwas up I was scorched, and because I had no root I withered away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut history tells of slaves who rose to the purple,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I chided.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd history tells of opportunities that came to the slaves who rose to\nthe purple,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered grimly.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo man makes opportunity.  All the\ngreat men ever did was to know it when it came to them.  The Corsican\nknew.  I have dreamed as greatly as the Corsican.  I should have known\nthe opportunity, but it never came.  The thorns sprung up and choked me.\nAnd, Hump, I can tell you that you know more about me than any living\nman, except my own brother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what is he?  And where is he?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster of the steamship _Macedonia_, seal-hunter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the answer.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\nwill meet him most probably on the Japan coast.  Men call him \u00e2\u0080\u0098Death\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nLarsen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDeath Larsen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I involuntarily cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs he like you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHardly.  He is a lump of an animal without any head.  He has all my\u00e2\u0080\u0094my\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBrutishness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I suggested.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u0094thank you for the word,\u00e2\u0080\u0094all my brutishness, but he can scarcely\nread or write.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd he has never philosophized on life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I added.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen answered, with an indescribable air of sadness.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd\nhe is all the happier for leaving life alone.  He is too busy living it\nto think about it.  My mistake was in ever opening the books.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nThe _Ghost_ has attained the southernmost point of the arc she is\ndescribing across the Pacific, and is already beginning to edge away to\nthe west and north toward some lone island, it is rumoured, where she\nwill fill her water-casks before proceeding to the season\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hunt along\nthe coast of Japan.  The hunters have experimented and practised with\ntheir rifles and shotguns till they are satisfied, and the boat-pullers\nand steerers have made their spritsails, bound the oars and rowlocks in\nleather and sennit so that they will make no noise when creeping on the\nseals, and put their boats in apple-pie order\u00e2\u0080\u0094to use Leach\u00e2\u0080\u0099s homely\nphrase.\n\nHis arm, by the way, has healed nicely, though the scar will remain all\nhis life.  Thomas Mugridge lives in mortal fear of him, and is afraid to\nventure on deck after dark.  There are two or three standing quarrels in\nthe forecastle.  Louis tells me that the gossip of the sailors finds its\nway aft, and that two of the telltales have been badly beaten by their\nmates.  He shakes his head dubiously over the outlook for the man\nJohnson, who is boat-puller in the same boat with him.  Johnson has been\nguilty of speaking his mind too freely, and has collided two or three\ntimes with Wolf Larsen over the pronunciation of his name.  Johansen he\nthrashed on the amidships deck the other night, since which time the mate\nhas called him by his proper name.  But of course it is out of the\nquestion that Johnson should thrash Wolf Larsen.\n\nLouis has also given me additional information about Death Larsen, which\ntallies with the captain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brief description.  We may expect to meet\nDeath Larsen on the Japan coast.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd look out for squalls,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is Louis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nprophecy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor they hate one another like the wolf whelps they are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nDeath Larsen is in command of the only sealing steamer in the fleet, the\n_Macedonia_, which carries fourteen boats, whereas the rest of the\nschooners carry only six.  There is wild talk of cannon aboard, and of\nstrange raids and expeditions she may make, ranging from opium smuggling\ninto the States and arms smuggling into China, to blackbirding and open\npiracy.  Yet I cannot but believe for I have never yet caught him in a\nlie, while he has a cyclop\u00c3\u00a6dic knowledge of sealing and the men of the\nsealing fleets.\n\nAs it is forward and in the galley, so it is in the steerage and aft, on\nthis veritable hell-ship.  Men fight and struggle ferociously for one\nanother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lives.  The hunters are looking for a shooting scrape at any\nmoment between Smoke and Henderson, whose old quarrel has not healed,\nwhile Wolf Larsen says positively that he will kill the survivor of the\naffair, if such affair comes off.  He frankly states that the position he\ntakes is based on no moral grounds, that all the hunters could kill and\neat one another so far as he is concerned, were it not that he needs them\nalive for the hunting.  If they will only hold their hands until the\nseason is over, he promises them a royal carnival, when all grudges can\nhe settled and the survivors may toss the non-survivors overboard and\narrange a story as to how the missing men were lost at sea.  I think even\nthe hunters are appalled at his cold-bloodedness.  Wicked men though they\nbe, they are certainly very much afraid of him.\n\nThomas Mugridge is cur-like in his subjection to me, while I go about in\nsecret dread of him.  His is the courage of fear,\u00e2\u0080\u0094a strange thing I know\nwell of myself,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and at any moment it may master the fear and impel him to\nthe taking of my life.  My knee is much better, though it often aches for\nlong periods, and the stiffness is gradually leaving the arm which Wolf\nLarsen squeezed.  Otherwise I am in splendid condition, feel that I am in\nsplendid condition.  My muscles are growing harder and increasing in\nsize.  My hands, however, are a spectacle for grief.  They have a\nparboiled appearance, are afflicted with hang-nails, while the nails are\nbroken and discoloured, and the edges of the quick seem to be assuming a\nfungoid sort of growth.  Also, I am suffering from boils, due to the\ndiet, most likely, for I was never afflicted in this manner before.\n\nI was amused, a couple of evenings back, by seeing Wolf Larsen reading\nthe Bible, a copy of which, after the futile search for one at the\nbeginning of the voyage, had been found in the dead mate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sea-chest.  I\nwondered what Wolf Larsen could get from it, and he read aloud to me from\nEcclesiastes.  I could imagine he was speaking the thoughts of his own\nmind as he read to me, and his voice, reverberating deeply and mournfully\nin the confined cabin, charmed and held me.  He may be uneducated, but he\ncertainly knows how to express the significance of the written word.  I\ncan hear him now, as I shall always hear him, the primal melancholy\nvibrant in his voice as he read:\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cI gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of\n    kings and of the provinces; I gat me men singers and women singers,\n    and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that\n    of all sorts.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in\n    Jerusalem; also my wisdom returned with me.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought and on the\n    labour that I had laboured to do; and behold, all was vanity and\n    vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll things come alike to all; there is one event to the righteous\n    and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean;\n    to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not; as is the\n    good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an\n    oath.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that\n    there is one event unto all; yea, also the heart of the sons of men\n    is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and\n    after that they go to the dead.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor to him that is joined to all the living there is hope; for a\n    living dog is better than a dead lion.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the living know that they shall die; but the dead know not\n    anything, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them\n    is forgotten.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlso their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished;\n    neither have they any more a portion for ever in anything that is\n    done under the sun.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere you have it, Hump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, closing the book upon his finger and\nlooking up at me.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Preacher who was king over Israel in Jerusalem\nthought as I think.  You call me a pessimist.  Is not this pessimism of\nthe blackest?\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0098All is vanity and vexation of spirit,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098There is no profit\nunder the sun,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098There is one event unto all,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to the fool and the wise,\nthe clean and the unclean, the sinner and the saint, and that event is\ndeath, and an evil thing, he says.  For the Preacher loved life, and did\nnot want to die, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u0098For a living dog is better than a dead lion.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nHe preferred the vanity and vexation to the silence and unmovableness of\nthe grave.  And so I.  To crawl is piggish; but to not crawl, to be as\nthe clod and rock, is loathsome to contemplate.  It is loathsome to the\nlife that is in me, the very essence of which is movement, the power of\nmovement, and the consciousness of the power of movement.  Life itself is\nunsatisfaction, but to look ahead to death is greater unsatisfaction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are worse off than Omar,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe, at least, after the\ncustomary agonizing of youth, found content and made of his materialism a\njoyous thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho was Omar?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen asked, and I did no more work that day, nor\nthe next, nor the next.\n\nIn his random reading he had never chanced upon the Rub\u00c3\u00a1iy\u00c3\u00a1t, and it was\nto him like a great find of treasure.  Much I remembered, possibly\ntwo-thirds of the quatrains, and I managed to piece out the remainder\nwithout difficulty.  We talked for hours over single stanzas, and I found\nhim reading into them a wail of regret and a rebellion which, for the\nlife of me, I could not discover myself.  Possibly I recited with a\ncertain joyous lilt which was my own, for\u00e2\u0080\u0094his memory was good, and at a\nsecond rendering, very often the first, he made a quatrain his own\u00e2\u0080\u0094he\nrecited the same lines and invested them with an unrest and passionate\nrevolt that was well-nigh convincing.\n\nI was interested as to which quatrain he would like best, and was not\nsurprised when he hit upon the one born of an instant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s irritability, and\nquite at variance with the Persian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complacent philosophy and genial\ncode of life:\n\n   \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat, without asking, hither hurried _Whence_?\n   And, without asking, _Whither_ hurried hence!\n      Oh, many a Cup of this forbidden Wine\n   Must drown the memory of that insolence!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGreat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cGreat!  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the keynote.  Insolence!  He\ncould not have used a better word.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn vain I objected and denied.  He deluged me, overwhelmed me with\nargument.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the nature of life to be otherwise.  Life, when it knows that\nit must cease living, will always rebel.  It cannot help itself.  The\nPreacher found life and the works of life all a vanity and vexation, an\nevil thing; but death, the ceasing to be able to be vain and vexed, he\nfound an eviler thing.  Through chapter after chapter he is worried by\nthe one event that cometh to all alike.  So Omar, so I, so you, even you,\nfor you rebelled against dying when Cooky sharpened a knife for you.  You\nwere afraid to die; the life that was in you, that composes you, that is\ngreater than you, did not want to die.  You have talked of the instinct\nof immortality.  I talk of the instinct of life, which is to live, and\nwhich, when death looms near and large, masters the instinct, so called,\nof immortality.  It mastered it in you (you cannot deny it), because a\ncrazy Cockney cook sharpened a knife.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are afraid of him now.  You are afraid of me.  You cannot deny it.\nIf I should catch you by the throat, thus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094his hand was about my throat\nand my breath was shut off,\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cand began to press the life out of you thus,\nand thus, your instinct of immortality will go glimmering, and your\ninstinct of life, which is longing for life, will flutter up, and you\nwill struggle to save yourself.  Eh?  I see the fear of death in your\neyes.  You beat the air with your arms.  You exert all your puny strength\nto struggle to live.  Your hand is clutching my arm, lightly it feels as\na butterfly resting there.  Your chest is heaving, your tongue\nprotruding, your skin turning dark, your eyes swimming.  \u00e2\u0080\u0098To live!  To\nlive!  To live!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 you are crying; and you are crying to live here and now,\nnot hereafter.  You doubt your immortality, eh?  Ha! ha!  You are not\nsure of it.  You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t chance it.  This life only you are certain is\nreal.  Ah, it is growing dark and darker.  It is the darkness of death,\nthe ceasing to be, the ceasing to feel, the ceasing to move, that is\ngathering about you, descending upon you, rising around you.  Your eyes\nare becoming set.  They are glazing.  My voice sounds faint and far.  You\ncannot see my face.  And still you struggle in my grip.  You kick with\nyour legs.  Your body draws itself up in knots like a snake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  Your\nchest heaves and strains.  To live!  To live!  To live\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI heard no more.  Consciousness was blotted out by the darkness he had so\ngraphically described, and when I came to myself I was lying on the floor\nand he was smoking a cigar and regarding me thoughtfully with that old\nfamiliar light of curiosity in his eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, have I convinced you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he demanded.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere take a drink of this.\nI want to ask you some questions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI rolled my head negatively on the floor.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour arguments are\ntoo\u00e2\u0080\u0094er\u00e2\u0080\u0094forcible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I managed to articulate, at cost of great pain to my\naching throat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be all right in half-an-hour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he assured me.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I promise I\nwon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use any more physical demonstrations.  Get up now.  You can sit on\na chair.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd, toy that I was of this monster, the discussion of Omar and the\nPreacher was resumed.  And half the night we sat up over it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nThe last twenty-four hours have witnessed a carnival of brutality.  From\ncabin to forecastle it seems to have broken out like a contagion.  I\nscarcely know where to begin.  Wolf Larsen was really the cause of it.\nThe relations among the men, strained and made tense by feuds, quarrels\nand grudges, were in a state of unstable equilibrium, and evil passions\nflared up in flame like prairie-grass.\n\nThomas Mugridge is a sneak, a spy, an informer.  He has been attempting\nto curry favour and reinstate himself in the good graces of the captain\nby carrying tales of the men forward.  He it was, I know, that carried\nsome of Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hasty talk to Wolf Larsen.  Johnson, it seems, bought a\nsuit of oilskins from the slop-chest and found them to be of greatly\ninferior quality.  Nor was he slow in advertising the fact.  The\nslop-chest is a sort of miniature dry-goods store which is carried by all\nsealing schooners and which is stocked with articles peculiar to the\nneeds of the sailors.  Whatever a sailor purchases is taken from his\nsubsequent earnings on the sealing grounds; for, as it is with the\nhunters so it is with the boat-pullers and steerers\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the place of wages\nthey receive a \u00e2\u0080\u009clay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a rate of so much per skin for every skin captured\nin their particular boat.\n\nBut of Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grumbling at the slop-chest I knew nothing, so that what\nI witnessed came with a shock of sudden surprise.  I had just finished\nsweeping the cabin, and had been inveigled by Wolf Larsen into a\ndiscussion of Hamlet, his favourite Shakespearian character, when\nJohansen descended the companion stairs followed by Johnson.  The\nlatter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cap came off after the custom of the sea, and he stood\nrespectfully in the centre of the cabin, swaying heavily and uneasily to\nthe roll of the schooner and facing the captain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShut the doors and draw the slide,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen said to me.\n\nAs I obeyed I noticed an anxious light come into Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes, but I\ndid not dream of its cause.  I did not dream of what was to occur until\nit did occur, but he knew from the very first what was coming and awaited\nit bravely.  And in his action I found complete refutation of all Wolf\nLarsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s materialism.  The sailor Johnson was swayed by idea, by\nprinciple, and truth, and sincerity.  He was right, he knew he was right,\nand he was unafraid.  He would die for the right if needs be, he would be\ntrue to himself, sincere with his soul.  And in this was portrayed the\nvictory of the spirit over the flesh, the indomitability and moral\ngrandeur of the soul that knows no restriction and rises above time and\nspace and matter with a surety and invincibleness born of nothing else\nthan eternity and immortality.\n\nBut to return.  I noticed the anxious light in Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes, but\nmistook it for the native shyness and embarrassment of the man.  The\nmate, Johansen, stood away several feet to the side of him, and fully\nthree yards in front of him sat Wolf Larsen on one of the pivotal cabin\nchairs.  An appreciable pause fell after I had closed the doors and drawn\nthe slide, a pause that must have lasted fully a minute.  It was broken\nby Wolf Larsen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYonson,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he began.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy name is Johnson, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the sailor boldly corrected.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Johnson, then, damn you!  Can you guess why I have sent for you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, and no, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the slow reply.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy work is done well.  The mate\nknows that, and you know it, sir.  So there cannot be any complaint.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd is that all?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen queried, his voice soft, and low, and\npurring.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know you have it in for me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Johnson continued with his unalterable\nand ponderous slowness.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou do not like me.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0094you\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen prompted.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be afraid of my feelings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not afraid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the sailor retorted, a slight angry flush rising\nthrough his sunburn.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I speak not fast, it is because I have not been\nfrom the old country as long as you.  You do not like me because I am too\nmuch of a man; that is why, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are too much of a man for ship discipline, if that is what you mean,\nand if you know what I mean,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s retort.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know English, and I know what you mean, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Johnson answered, his\nflush deepening at the slur on his knowledge of the English language.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJohnson,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen said, with an air of dismissing all that had gone\nbefore as introductory to the main business in hand, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\nnot quite satisfied with those oilskins?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I am not.  They are no good, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been shooting off your mouth about them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI say what I think, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the sailor answered courageously, not failing\nat the same time in ship courtesy, which demanded that \u00e2\u0080\u009csir\u00e2\u0080\u009d be appended\nto each speech he made.\n\nIt was at this moment that I chanced to glance at Johansen.  His big\nfists were clenching and unclenching, and his face was positively\nfiendish, so malignantly did he look at Johnson.  I noticed a black\ndiscoloration, still faintly visible, under Johansen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye, a mark of the\nthrashing he had received a few nights before from the sailor.  For the\nfirst time I began to divine that something terrible was about to be\nenacted,\u00e2\u0080\u0094what, I could not imagine.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know what happens to men who say what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said about my\nslop-chest and me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen was demanding.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the answer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen demanded, sharply and imperatively.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat you and the mate there are going to do to me, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook at him, Hump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen said to me, \u00e2\u0080\u009clook at this bit of\nanimated dust, this aggregation of matter that moves and breathes and\ndefies me and thoroughly believes itself to be compounded of something\ngood; that is impressed with certain human fictions such as righteousness\nand honesty, and that will live up to them in spite of all personal\ndiscomforts and menaces.  What do you think of him, Hump?  What do you\nthink of him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that he is a better man than you are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered, impelled,\nsomehow, with a desire to draw upon myself a portion of the wrath I felt\nwas about to break upon his head.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis human fictions, as you choose to\ncall them, make for nobility and manhood.  You have no fictions, no\ndreams, no ideals.  You are a pauper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe nodded his head with a savage pleasantness.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cQuite true, Hump, quite\ntrue.  I have no fictions that make for nobility and manhood.  A living\ndog is better than a dead lion, say I with the Preacher.  My only\ndoctrine is the doctrine of expediency, and it makes for surviving.  This\nbit of the ferment we call \u00e2\u0080\u0098Johnson,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 when he is no longer a bit of the\nferment, only dust and ashes, will have no more nobility than any dust\nand ashes, while I shall still be alive and roaring.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know what I am going to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he questioned.\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I am going to exercise my prerogative of roaring and show you how\nfares nobility.  Watch me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThree yards away from Johnson he was, and sitting down.  Nine feet!  And\nyet he left the chair in full leap, without first gaining a standing\nposition.  He left the chair, just as he sat in it, squarely, springing\nfrom the sitting posture like a wild animal, a tiger, and like a tiger\ncovered the intervening space.  It was an avalanche of fury that Johnson\nstrove vainly to fend off.  He threw one arm down to protect the stomach,\nthe other arm up to protect the head; but Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fist drove midway\nbetween, on the chest, with a crushing, resounding impact.  Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbreath, suddenly expelled, shot from his mouth and as suddenly checked,\nwith the forced, audible expiration of a man wielding an axe.  He almost\nfell backward, and swayed from side to side in an effort to recover his\nbalance.\n\nI cannot give the further particulars of the horrible scene that\nfollowed.  It was too revolting.  It turns me sick even now when I think\nof it.  Johnson fought bravely enough, but he was no match for Wolf\nLarsen, much less for Wolf Larsen and the mate.  It was frightful.  I had\nnot imagined a human being could endure so much and still live and\nstruggle on.  And struggle on Johnson did.  Of course there was no hope\nfor him, not the slightest, and he knew it as well as I, but by the\nmanhood that was in him he could not cease from fighting for that\nmanhood.\n\nIt was too much for me to witness.  I felt that I should lose my mind,\nand I ran up the companion stairs to open the doors and escape on deck.\nBut Wolf Larsen, leaving his victim for the moment, and with one of his\ntremendous springs, gained my side and flung me into the far corner of\nthe cabin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe phenomena of life, Hump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he girded at me.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cStay and watch it.  You\nmay gather data on the immortality of the soul.  Besides, you know, we\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hurt Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soul.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only the fleeting form we may demolish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt seemed centuries\u00e2\u0080\u0094possibly it was no more than ten minutes that the\nbeating continued.  Wolf Larsen and Johansen were all about the poor\nfellow.  They struck him with their fists, kicked him with their heavy\nshoes, knocked him down, and dragged him to his feet to knock him down\nagain.  His eyes were blinded so that he could not see, and the blood\nrunning from ears and nose and mouth turned the cabin into a shambles.\nAnd when he could no longer rise they still continued to beat and kick\nhim where he lay.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEasy, Johansen; easy as she goes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen finally said.\n\nBut the beast in the mate was up and rampant, and Wolf Larsen was\ncompelled to brush him away with a back-handed sweep of the arm, gentle\nenough, apparently, but which hurled Johansen back like a cork, driving\nhis head against the wall with a crash.  He fell to the floor, half\nstunned for the moment, breathing heavily and blinking his eyes in a\nstupid sort of way.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJerk open the doors,\u00e2\u0080\u0094Hump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was commanded.\n\nI obeyed, and the two brutes picked up the senseless man like a sack of\nrubbish and hove him clear up the companion stairs, through the narrow\ndoorway, and out on deck.  The blood from his nose gushed in a scarlet\nstream over the feet of the helmsman, who was none other than Louis, his\nboat-mate.  But Louis took and gave a spoke and gazed imperturbably into\nthe binnacle.\n\nNot so was the conduct of George Leach, the erstwhile cabin-boy.  Fore\nand aft there was nothing that could have surprised us more than his\nconsequent behaviour.  He it was that came up on the poop without orders\nand dragged Johnson forward, where he set about dressing his wounds as\nwell as he could and making him comfortable.  Johnson, as Johnson, was\nunrecognizable; and not only that, for his features, as human features at\nall, were unrecognizable, so discoloured and swollen had they become in\nthe few minutes which had elapsed between the beginning of the beating\nand the dragging forward of the body.\n\nBut of Leach\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behaviour\u00e2\u0080\u0094By the time I had finished cleansing the cabin\nhe had taken care of Johnson.  I had come up on deck for a breath of\nfresh air and to try to get some repose for my overwrought nerves.  Wolf\nLarsen was smoking a cigar and examining the patent log which the _Ghost_\nusually towed astern, but which had been hauled in for some purpose.\nSuddenly Leach\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice came to my ears.  It was tense and hoarse with an\novermastering rage.  I turned and saw him standing just beneath the break\nof the poop on the port side of the galley.  His face was convulsed and\nwhite, his eyes were flashing, his clenched fists raised overhead.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay God damn your soul to hell, Wolf Larsen, only hell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too good for\nyou, you coward, you murderer, you pig!\u00e2\u0080\u009d was his opening salutation.\n\nI was thunderstruck.  I looked for his instant annihilation.  But it was\nnot Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s whim to annihilate him.  He sauntered slowly forward to\nthe break of the poop, and, leaning his elbow on the corner of the cabin,\ngazed down thoughtfully and curiously at the excited boy.\n\nAnd the boy indicted Wolf Larsen as he had never been indicted before.\nThe sailors assembled in a fearful group just outside the forecastle\nscuttle and watched and listened.  The hunters piled pell-mell out of the\nsteerage, but as Leach\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tirade continued I saw that there was no levity\nin their faces.  Even they were frightened, not at the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terrible\nwords, but at his terrible audacity.  It did not seem possible that any\nliving creature could thus beard Wolf Larsen in his teeth.  I know for\nmyself that I was shocked into admiration of the boy, and I saw in him\nthe splendid invincibleness of immortality rising above the flesh and the\nfears of the flesh, as in the prophets of old, to condemn\nunrighteousness.\n\nAnd such condemnation!  He haled forth Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soul naked to the\nscorn of men.  He rained upon it curses from God and High Heaven, and\nwithered it with a heat of invective that savoured of a medi\u00c3\u00a6val\nexcommunication of the Catholic Church.  He ran the gamut of\ndenunciation, rising to heights of wrath that were sublime and almost\nGodlike, and from sheer exhaustion sinking to the vilest and most\nindecent abuse.\n\nHis rage was a madness.  His lips were flecked with a soapy froth, and\nsometimes he choked and gurgled and became inarticulate.  And through it\nall, calm and impassive, leaning on his elbow and gazing down, Wolf\nLarsen seemed lost in a great curiosity.  This wild stirring of yeasty\nlife, this terrific revolt and defiance of matter that moved, perplexed\nand interested him.\n\nEach moment I looked, and everybody looked, for him to leap upon the boy\nand destroy him.  But it was not his whim.  His cigar went out, and he\ncontinued to gaze silently and curiously.\n\nLeach had worked himself into an ecstasy of impotent rage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPig!  Pig!  Pig!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he was reiterating at the top of his lungs.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you come down and kill me, you murderer?  You can do it!  I ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nafraid!  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no one to stop you!  Damn sight better dead and outa\nyour reach than alive and in your clutches!  Come on, you coward!  Kill\nme!  Kill me!  Kill me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was at this stage that Thomas Mugridge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s erratic soul brought him into\nthe scene.  He had been listening at the galley door, but he now came\nout, ostensibly to fling some scraps over the side, but obviously to see\nthe killing he was certain would take place.  He smirked greasily up into\nthe face of Wolf Larsen, who seemed not to see him.  But the Cockney was\nunabashed, though mad, stark mad.  He turned to Leach, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSuch langwidge!  Shockin\u00e2\u0080\u0099!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLeach\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rage was no longer impotent.  Here at last was something ready to\nhand.  And for the first time since the stabbing the Cockney had appeared\noutside the galley without his knife.  The words had barely left his\nmouth when he was knocked down by Leach.  Three times he struggled to his\nfeet, striving to gain the galley, and each time was knocked down.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Lord!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Elp!  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Elp!  Tyke \u00e2\u0080\u0099im aw\u00e2\u0080\u0099y, carn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yer?  Tyke\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099im aw\u00e2\u0080\u0099y!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe hunters laughed from sheer relief.  Tragedy had dwindled, the farce\nhad begun.  The sailors now crowded boldly aft, grinning and shuffling,\nto watch the pummelling of the hated Cockney.  And even I felt a great\njoy surge up within me.  I confess that I delighted in this beating Leach\nwas giving to Thomas Mugridge, though it was as terrible, almost, as the\none Mugridge had caused to be given to Johnson.  But the expression of\nWolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face never changed.  He did not change his position either,\nbut continued to gaze down with a great curiosity.  For all his pragmatic\ncertitude, it seemed as if he watched the play and movement of life in\nthe hope of discovering something more about it, of discerning in its\nmaddest writhings a something which had hitherto escaped him,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the key to\nits mystery, as it were, which would make all clear and plain.\n\nBut the beating!  It was quite similar to the one I had witnessed in the\ncabin.  The Cockney strove in vain to protect himself from the infuriated\nboy.  And in vain he strove to gain the shelter of the cabin.  He rolled\ntoward it, grovelled toward it, fell toward it when he was knocked down.\nBut blow followed blow with bewildering rapidity.  He was knocked about\nlike a shuttlecock, until, finally, like Johnson, he was beaten and\nkicked as he lay helpless on the deck.  And no one interfered.  Leach\ncould have killed him, but, having evidently filled the measure of his\nvengeance, he drew away from his prostrate foe, who was whimpering and\nwailing in a puppyish sort of way, and walked forward.\n\nBut these two affairs were only the opening events of the day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nprogramme.  In the afternoon Smoke and Henderson fell foul of each other,\nand a fusillade of shots came up from the steerage, followed by a\nstampede of the other four hunters for the deck.  A column of thick,\nacrid smoke\u00e2\u0080\u0094the kind always made by black powder\u00e2\u0080\u0094was arising through the\nopen companion-way, and down through it leaped Wolf Larsen.  The sound of\nblows and scuffling came to our ears.  Both men were wounded, and he was\nthrashing them both for having disobeyed his orders and crippled\nthemselves in advance of the hunting season.  In fact, they were badly\nwounded, and, having thrashed them, he proceeded to operate upon them in\na rough surgical fashion and to dress their wounds.  I served as\nassistant while he probed and cleansed the passages made by the bullets,\nand I saw the two men endure his crude surgery without an\u00c3\u00a6sthetics and\nwith no more to uphold them than a stiff tumbler of whisky.\n\nThen, in the first dog-watch, trouble came to a head in the forecastle.\nIt took its rise out of the tittle-tattle and tale-bearing which had been\nthe cause of Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beating, and from the noise we heard, and from the\nsight of the bruised men next day, it was patent that half the forecastle\nhad soundly drubbed the other half.\n\nThe second dog-watch and the day were wound up by a fight between\nJohansen and the lean, Yankee-looking hunter, Latimer.  It was caused by\nremarks of Latimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concerning the noises made by the mate in his sleep,\nand though Johansen was whipped, he kept the steerage awake for the rest\nof the night while he blissfully slumbered and fought the fight over and\nover again.\n\nAs for myself, I was oppressed with nightmare.  The day had been like\nsome horrible dream.  Brutality had followed brutality, and flaming\npassions and cold-blooded cruelty had driven men to seek one another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nlives, and to strive to hurt, and maim, and destroy.  My nerves were\nshocked.  My mind itself was shocked.  All my days had been passed in\ncomparative ignorance of the animality of man.  In fact, I had known life\nonly in its intellectual phases.  Brutality I had experienced, but it was\nthe brutality of the intellect\u00e2\u0080\u0094the cutting sarcasm of Charley Furuseth,\nthe cruel epigrams and occasional harsh witticisms of the fellows at the\nBibelot, and the nasty remarks of some of the professors during my\nundergraduate days.\n\nThat was all.  But that men should wreak their anger on others by the\nbruising of the flesh and the letting of blood was something strangely\nand fearfully new to me.  Not for nothing had I been called \u00e2\u0080\u009cSissy\u00e2\u0080\u009d Van\nWeyden, I thought, as I tossed restlessly on my bunk between one\nnightmare and another.  And it seemed to me that my innocence of the\nrealities of life had been complete indeed.  I laughed bitterly to\nmyself, and seemed to find in Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forbidding philosophy a more\nadequate explanation of life than I found in my own.\n\nAnd I was frightened when I became conscious of the trend of my thought.\nThe continual brutality around me was degenerative in its effect.  It bid\nfair to destroy for me all that was best and brightest in life.  My\nreason dictated that the beating Thomas Mugridge had received was an ill\nthing, and yet for the life of me I could not prevent my soul joying in\nit.  And even while I was oppressed by the enormity of my sin,\u00e2\u0080\u0094for sin it\nwas,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I chuckled with an insane delight.  I was no longer Humphrey Van\nWeyden.  I was Hump, cabin-boy on the schooner _Ghost_.  Wolf Larsen was\nmy captain, Thomas Mugridge and the rest were my companions, and I was\nreceiving repeated impresses from the die which had stamped them all.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nFor three days I did my own work and Thomas Mugridge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too; and I flatter\nmyself that I did his work well.  I know that it won Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\napproval, while the sailors beamed with satisfaction during the brief\ntime my _r\u00c3\u00a9gime_ lasted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe first clean bite since I come aboard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Harrison said to me at the\ngalley door, as he returned the dinner pots and pans from the forecastle.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSomehow Tommy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grub always tastes of grease, stale grease, and I reckon\nhe ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t changed his shirt since he left \u00e2\u0080\u0099Frisco.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know he hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bet he sleeps in it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Harrison added.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I agreed.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe same shirt, and he hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had it\noff once in all this time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut three days was all Wolf Larsen allowed him in which to recover from\nthe effects of the beating.  On the fourth day, lame and sore, scarcely\nable to see, so closed were his eyes, he was haled from his bunk by the\nnape of the neck and set to his duty.  He sniffled and wept, but Wolf\nLarsen was pitiless.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd see that you serve no more slops,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was his parting injunction.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo\nmore grease and dirt, mind, and a clean shirt occasionally, or you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get\na tow over the side.  Understand?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThomas Mugridge crawled weakly across the galley floor, and a short lurch\nof the _Ghost_ sent him staggering.  In attempting to recover himself, he\nreached for the iron railing which surrounded the stove and kept the pots\nfrom sliding off; but he missed the railing, and his hand, with his\nweight behind it, landed squarely on the hot surface.  There was a sizzle\nand odour of burning flesh, and a sharp cry of pain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Gawd, Gawd, wot \u00e2\u0080\u0099ave I done?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wailed; sitting down in the\ncoal-box and nursing his new hurt by rocking back and forth.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cW\u00e2\u0080\u0099y \u00e2\u0080\u0099as\nall this come on me?  It mykes me fair sick, it does, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I try so \u00e2\u0080\u0099ard\nto go through life \u00e2\u0080\u0099armless an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0099urtin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 nobody.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe tears were running down his puffed and discoloured cheeks, and his\nface was drawn with pain.  A savage expression flitted across it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, \u00e2\u0080\u0099ow I \u00e2\u0080\u0099ate \u00e2\u0080\u0099im!  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Ow I \u00e2\u0080\u0099ate \u00e2\u0080\u0099im!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he gritted out.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhom?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked; but the poor wretch was weeping again over his\nmisfortunes.  Less difficult it was to guess whom he hated than whom he\ndid not hate.  For I had come to see a malignant devil in him which\nimpelled him to hate all the world.  I sometimes thought that he hated\neven himself, so grotesquely had life dealt with him, and so monstrously.\nAt such moments a great sympathy welled up within me, and I felt shame\nthat I had ever joyed in his discomfiture or pain.  Life had been unfair\nto him.  It had played him a scurvy trick when it fashioned him into the\nthing he was, and it had played him scurvy tricks ever since.  What\nchance had he to be anything else than he was?  And as though answering\nmy unspoken thought, he wailed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never \u00e2\u0080\u0099ad no chance, not \u00e2\u0080\u0099arf a chance!  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Oo was there to send me to\nschool, or put tommy in my \u00e2\u0080\u0099ungry belly, or wipe my bloody nose for me,\nw\u00e2\u0080\u0099en I was a kiddy?  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Oo ever did anything for me, heh?  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Oo, I s\u00e2\u0080\u0099y?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever mind, Tommy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, placing a soothing hand on his shoulder.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCheer up.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll all come right in the end.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve long years before\nyou, and you can make anything you please of yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lie! a bloody lie!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he shouted in my face, flinging off the hand.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lie, and you know it.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m already myde, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 myde out of leavin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nan\u00e2\u0080\u0099 scraps.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right for you, \u00e2\u0080\u0099Ump.  You was born a gentleman.\nYou never knew wot it was to go \u00e2\u0080\u0099ungry, to cry yerself asleep with yer\nlittle belly gnawin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 gnawin\u00e2\u0080\u0099, like a rat inside yer.  It carn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come\nright.  If I was President of the United Stytes to-morrer, \u00e2\u0080\u0099ow would it\nfill my belly for one time w\u00e2\u0080\u0099en I was a kiddy and it went empty?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Ow could it, I s\u00e2\u0080\u0099y?  I was born to sufferin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and sorrer.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had more\ncruel sufferin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 than any ten men, I \u00e2\u0080\u0099ave.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been in orspital arf my\nbleedin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 life.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve \u00e2\u0080\u0099ad the fever in Aspinwall, in \u00e2\u0080\u0099Avana, in New\nOrleans.  I near died of the scurvy and was rotten with it six months in\nBarbadoes.  Smallpox in \u00e2\u0080\u0099Onolulu, two broken legs in Shanghai, pnuemonia\nin Unalaska, three busted ribs an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 my insides all twisted in \u00e2\u0080\u0099Frisco.\nAn\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0099ere I am now.  Look at me!  Look at me!  My ribs kicked loose from\nmy back again.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be coughin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 blood before eyght bells.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Ow can it be\nmyde up to me, I arsk?  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Oo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to do it?  Gawd?  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Ow Gawd must \u00e2\u0080\u0099ave\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099ated me w\u00e2\u0080\u0099en \u00e2\u0080\u0099e signed me on for a voyage in this bloomin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 world of\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099is!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis tirade against destiny went on for an hour or more, and then he\nbuckled to his work, limping and groaning, and in his eyes a great hatred\nfor all created things.  His diagnosis was correct, however, for he was\nseized with occasional sicknesses, during which he vomited blood and\nsuffered great pain.  And as he said, it seemed God hated him too much to\nlet him die, for he ultimately grew better and waxed more malignant than\never.\n\nSeveral days more passed before Johnson crawled on deck and went about\nhis work in a half-hearted way.  He was still a sick man, and I more than\nonce observed him creeping painfully aloft to a topsail, or drooping\nwearily as he stood at the wheel.  But, still worse, it seemed that his\nspirit was broken.  He was abject before Wolf Larsen and almost grovelled\nto Johansen.  Not so was the conduct of Leach.  He went about the deck\nlike a tiger cub, glaring his hatred openly at Wolf Larsen and Johansen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do for you yet, you slab-footed Swede,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I heard him say to Johansen\none night on deck.\n\nThe mate cursed him in the darkness, and the next moment some missile\nstruck the galley a sharp rap.  There was more cursing, and a mocking\nlaugh, and when all was quiet I stole outside and found a heavy knife\nimbedded over an inch in the solid wood.  A few minutes later the mate\ncame fumbling about in search of it, but I returned it privily to Leach\nnext day.  He grinned when I handed it over, yet it was a grin that\ncontained more sincere thanks than a multitude of the verbosities of\nspeech common to the members of my own class.\n\nUnlike any one else in the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s company, I now found myself with no\nquarrels on my hands and in the good graces of all.  The hunters possibly\nno more than tolerated me, though none of them disliked me; while Smoke\nand Henderson, convalescent under a deck awning and swinging day and\nnight in their hammocks, assured me that I was better than any hospital\nnurse, and that they would not forget me at the end of the voyage when\nthey were paid off.  (As though I stood in need of their money!  I, who\ncould have bought them out, bag and baggage, and the schooner and its\nequipment, a score of times over!)  But upon me had devolved the task of\ntending their wounds, and pulling them through, and I did my best by\nthem.\n\nWolf Larsen underwent another bad attack of headache which lasted two\ndays.  He must have suffered severely, for he called me in and obeyed my\ncommands like a sick child.  But nothing I could do seemed to relieve\nhim.  At my suggestion, however, he gave up smoking and drinking; though\nwhy such a magnificent animal as he should have headaches at all puzzles\nme.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis the hand of God, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m tellin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the way Louis sees it.  \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis\na visitation for his black-hearted deeds, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more behind and\ncomin\u00e2\u0080\u0099, or else\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOr else,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I prompted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod is noddin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and not doin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 his duty, though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s me as shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say\nit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI was mistaken when I said that I was in the good graces of all.  Not\nonly does Thomas Mugridge continue to hate me, but he has discovered a\nnew reason for hating me.  It took me no little while to puzzle it out,\nbut I finally discovered that it was because I was more luckily born than\nhe\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cgentleman born,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he put it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd still no more dead men,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I twitted Louis, when Smoke and Henderson,\nside by side, in friendly conversation, took their first exercise on\ndeck.\n\nLouis surveyed me with his shrewd grey eyes, and shook his head\nportentously.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a-comin\u00e2\u0080\u0099, I tell you, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be sheets and\nhalyards, stand by all hands, when she begins to howl.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had the feel\niv it this long time, and I can feel it now as plainly as I feel the\nrigging iv a dark night.  She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s close, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s close.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho goes first?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I queried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot fat old Louis, I promise you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he laughed.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis in the bones\niv me I know that come this time next year I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be gazin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in the old\nmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes, weary with watchin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 iv the sea for the five sons she gave\nto it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0099e been s\u00e2\u0080\u0099yin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to yer?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Thomas Mugridge demanded a moment later.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going home some day to see his mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered\ndiplomatically.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never \u00e2\u0080\u0099ad none,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the Cockney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comment, as he gazed with\nlustreless, hopeless eyes into mine.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nIt has dawned upon me that I have never placed a proper valuation upon\nwomankind.  For that matter, though not amative to any considerable\ndegree so far as I have discovered, I was never outside the atmosphere of\nwomen until now.  My mother and sisters were always about me, and I was\nalways trying to escape them; for they worried me to distraction with\ntheir solicitude for my health and with their periodic inroads on my den,\nwhen my orderly confusion, upon which I prided myself, was turned into\nworse confusion and less order, though it looked neat enough to the eye.\nI never could find anything when they had departed.  But now, alas, how\nwelcome would have been the feel of their presence, the frou-frou and\nswish-swish of their skirts which I had so cordially detested!  I am\nsure, if I ever get home, that I shall never be irritable with them\nagain.  They may dose me and doctor me morning, noon, and night, and dust\nand sweep and put my den to rights every minute of the day, and I shall\nonly lean back and survey it all and be thankful in that I am possessed\nof a mother and some several sisters.\n\nAll of which has set me wondering.  Where are the mothers of these twenty\nand odd men on the _Ghost_?  It strikes me as unnatural and unhealthful\nthat men should be totally separated from women and herd through the\nworld by themselves.  Coarseness and savagery are the inevitable results.\nThese men about me should have wives, and sisters, and daughters; then\nwould they be capable of softness, and tenderness, and sympathy.  As it\nis, not one of them is married.  In years and years not one of them has\nbeen in contact with a good woman, or within the influence, or\nredemption, which irresistibly radiates from such a creature.  There is\nno balance in their lives.  Their masculinity, which in itself is of the\nbrute, has been over-developed.  The other and spiritual side of their\nnatures has been dwarfed\u00e2\u0080\u0094atrophied, in fact.\n\nThey are a company of celibates, grinding harshly against one another and\ngrowing daily more calloused from the grinding.  It seems to me\nimpossible sometimes that they ever had mothers.  It would appear that\nthey are a half-brute, half-human species, a race apart, wherein there is\nno such thing as sex; that they are hatched out by the sun like turtle\neggs, or receive life in some similar and sordid fashion; and that all\ntheir days they fester in brutality and viciousness, and in the end die\nas unlovely as they have lived.\n\nRendered curious by this new direction of ideas, I talked with Johansen\nlast night\u00e2\u0080\u0094the first superfluous words with which he has favoured me\nsince the voyage began.  He left Sweden when he was eighteen, is now\nthirty-eight, and in all the intervening time has not been home once.  He\nhad met a townsman, a couple of years before, in some sailor\nboarding-house in Chile, so that he knew his mother to be still alive.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe must be a pretty old woman now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, staring meditatively into\nthe binnacle and then jerking a sharp glance at Harrison, who was\nsteering a point off the course.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen did you last write to her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe performed his mental arithmetic aloud.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cEighty-one; no\u00e2\u0080\u0094eighty-two,\neh? no\u00e2\u0080\u0094eighty-three?  Yes, eighty-three.  Ten years ago.  From some\nlittle port in Madagascar.  I was trading.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he went on, as though addressing his neglected mother across\nhalf the girth of the earth, \u00e2\u0080\u009ceach year I was going home.  So what was\nthe good to write?  It was only a year.  And each year something\nhappened, and I did not go.  But I am mate, now, and when I pay off at\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099Frisco, maybe with five hundred dollars, I will ship myself on a\nwindjammer round the Horn to Liverpool, which will give me more money;\nand then I will pay my passage from there home.  Then she will not do any\nmore work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut does she work? now?  How old is she?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAbout seventy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered.  And then, boastingly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe work from the\ntime we are born until we die, in my country.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we live so\nlong.  I will live to a hundred.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI shall never forget this conversation.  The words were the last I ever\nheard him utter.  Perhaps they were the last he did utter, too.  For,\ngoing down into the cabin to turn in, I decided that it was too stuffy to\nsleep below.  It was a calm night.  We were out of the Trades, and the\n_Ghost_ was forging ahead barely a knot an hour.  So I tucked a blanket\nand pillow under my arm and went up on deck.\n\nAs I passed between Harrison and the binnacle, which was built into the\ntop of the cabin, I noticed that he was this time fully three points off.\nThinking that he was asleep, and wishing him to escape reprimand or\nworse, I spoke to him.  But he was not asleep.  His eyes were wide and\nstaring.  He seemed greatly perturbed, unable to reply to me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you sick?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe shook his head, and with a deep sign as of awakening, caught his\nbreath.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099d better get on your course, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I chided.\n\nHe put a few spokes over, and I watched the compass-card swing slowly to\nN.N.W. and steady itself with slight oscillations.\n\nI took a fresh hold on my bedclothes and was preparing to start on, when\nsome movement caught my eye and I looked astern to the rail.  A sinewy\nhand, dripping with water, was clutching the rail.  A second hand took\nform in the darkness beside it.  I watched, fascinated.  What visitant\nfrom the gloom of the deep was I to behold?  Whatever it was, I knew that\nit was climbing aboard by the log-line.  I saw a head, the hair wet and\nstraight, shape itself, and then the unmistakable eyes and face of Wolf\nLarsen.  His right cheek was red with blood, which flowed from some wound\nin the head.\n\nHe drew himself inboard with a quick effort, and arose to his feet,\nglancing swiftly, as he did so, at the man at the wheel, as though to\nassure himself of his identity and that there was nothing to fear from\nhim.  The sea-water was streaming from him.  It made little audible\ngurgles which distracted me.  As he stepped toward me I shrank back\ninstinctively, for I saw that in his eyes which spelled death.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right, Hump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in a low voice.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the mate?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJohansen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he called softly.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cJohansen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is he?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he demanded of Harrison.\n\nThe young fellow seemed to have recovered his composure, for he answered\nsteadily enough, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, sir.  I saw him go for\u00e2\u0080\u0099ard a little while\nago.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo did I go for\u00e2\u0080\u0099ard.  But you will observe that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come back the\nway I went.  Can you explain it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must have been overboard, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShall I look for him in the steerage, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\nWolf Larsen shook his head.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find him, Hump.  But you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\ndo.  Come on.  Never mind your bedding.  Leave it where it is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI followed at his heels.  There was nothing stirring amidships.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThose cursed hunters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was his comment.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cToo damned fat and lazy to\nstand a four-hour watch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut on the forecastle-head we found three sailors asleep.  He turned them\nover and looked at their faces.  They composed the watch on deck, and it\nwas the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s custom, in good weather, to let the watch sleep with the\nexception of the officer, the helmsman, and the look-out.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look-out?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he demanded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMe, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Holyoak, one of the deep-water sailors, a slight\ntremor in his voice.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI winked off just this very minute, sir.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nsorry, sir.  It won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you hear or see anything on deck?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, sir, I\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Wolf Larsen had turned away with a snort of disgust, leaving the\nsailor rubbing his eyes with surprise at having been let of so easily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSoftly, now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen warned me in a whisper, as he doubled his body\ninto the forecastle scuttle and prepared to descend.\n\nI followed with a quaking heart.  What was to happen I knew no more than\ndid I know what had happened.  But blood had been shed, and it was\nthrough no whim of Wolf Larsen that he had gone over the side with his\nscalp laid open.  Besides, Johansen was missing.\n\nIt was my first descent into the forecastle, and I shall not soon forget\nmy impression of it, caught as I stood on my feet at the bottom of the\nladder.  Built directly in the eyes of the schooner, it was of the shape\nof a triangle, along the three sides of which stood the bunks, in\ndouble-tier, twelve of them.  It was no larger than a hall bedroom in\nGrub Street, and yet twelve men were herded into it to eat and sleep and\ncarry on all the functions of living.  My bedroom at home was not large,\nyet it could have contained a dozen similar forecastles, and taking into\nconsideration the height of the ceiling, a score at least.\n\nIt smelled sour and musty, and by the dim light of the swinging sea-lamp\nI saw every bit of available wall-space hung deep with sea-boots,\noilskins, and garments, clean and dirty, of various sorts.  These swung\nback and forth with every roll of the vessel, giving rise to a brushing\nsound, as of trees against a roof or wall.  Somewhere a boot thumped\nloudly and at irregular intervals against the wall; and, though it was a\nmild night on the sea, there was a continual chorus of the creaking\ntimbers and bulkheads and of abysmal noises beneath the flooring.\n\nThe sleepers did not mind.  There were eight of them,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the two watches\nbelow,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the air was thick with the warmth and odour of their\nbreathing, and the ear was filled with the noise of their snoring and of\ntheir sighs and half-groans, tokens plain of the rest of the animal-man.\nBut were they sleeping? all of them?  Or had they been sleeping?  This\nwas evidently Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quest\u00e2\u0080\u0094to find the men who appeared to be\nasleep and who were not asleep or who had not been asleep very recently.\nAnd he went about it in a way that reminded me of a story out of\nBoccaccio.\n\nHe took the sea-lamp from its swinging frame and handed it to me.  He\nbegan at the first bunks forward on the star-board side.  In the top one\nlay Oofty-Oofty, a Kanaka and splendid seaman, so named by his mates.  He\nwas asleep on his back and breathing as placidly as a woman.  One arm was\nunder his head, the other lay on top of the blankets.  Wolf Larsen put\nthumb and forefinger to the wrist and counted the pulse.  In the midst of\nit the Kanaka roused.  He awoke as gently as he slept.  There was no\nmovement of the body whatever.  The eyes, only, moved.  They flashed wide\nopen, big and black, and stared, unblinking, into our faces.  Wolf Larsen\nput his finger to his lips as a sign for silence, and the eyes closed\nagain.\n\nIn the lower bunk lay Louis, grossly fat and warm and sweaty, asleep\nunfeignedly and sleeping laboriously.  While Wolf Larsen held his wrist\nhe stirred uneasily, bowing his body so that for a moment it rested on\nshoulders and heels.  His lips moved, and he gave voice to this enigmatic\nutterance:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA shilling\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth a quarter; but keep your lamps out for\nthruppenny-bits, or the publicans \u00e2\u0080\u0099ll shove \u00e2\u0080\u0099em on you for sixpence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he rolled over on his side with a heavy, sobbing sigh, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA sixpence is a tanner, and a shilling a bob; but what a pony is I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nknow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSatisfied with the honesty of his and the Kanaka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sleep, Wolf Larsen\npassed on to the next two bunks on the starboard side, occupied top and\nbottom, as we saw in the light of the sea-lamp, by Leach and Johnson.\n\nAs Wolf Larsen bent down to the lower bunk to take Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pulse, I,\nstanding erect and holding the lamp, saw Leach\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head rise stealthily as\nhe peered over the side of his bunk to see what was going on.  He must\nhave divined Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trick and the sureness of detection, for the\nlight was at once dashed from my hand and the forecastle was left in\ndarkness.  He must have leaped, also, at the same instant, straight down\non Wolf Larsen.\n\nThe first sounds were those of a conflict between a bull and a wolf.  I\nheard a great infuriated bellow go up from Wolf Larsen, and from Leach a\nsnarling that was desperate and blood-curdling.  Johnson must have joined\nhim immediately, so that his abject and grovelling conduct on deck for\nthe past few days had been no more than planned deception.\n\nI was so terror-stricken by this fight in the dark that I leaned against\nthe ladder, trembling and unable to ascend.  And upon me was that old\nsickness at the pit of the stomach, caused always by the spectacle of\nphysical violence.  In this instance I could not see, but I could hear\nthe impact of the blows\u00e2\u0080\u0094the soft crushing sound made by flesh striking\nforcibly against flesh.  Then there was the crashing about of the\nentwined bodies, the laboured breathing, the short quick gasps of sudden\npain.\n\nThere must have been more men in the conspiracy to murder the captain and\nmate, for by the sounds I knew that Leach and Johnson had been quickly\nreinforced by some of their mates.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGet a knife somebody!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Leach was shouting.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPound him on the head!  Mash his brains out!\u00e2\u0080\u009d was Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cry.\n\nBut after his first bellow, Wolf Larsen made no noise.  He was fighting\ngrimly and silently for life.  He was sore beset.  Down at the very\nfirst, he had been unable to gain his feet, and for all of his tremendous\nstrength I felt that there was no hope for him.\n\nThe force with which they struggled was vividly impressed on me; for I\nwas knocked down by their surging bodies and badly bruised.  But in the\nconfusion I managed to crawl into an empty lower bunk out of the way.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll hands!  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got him!  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I could hear Leach crying.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho?\u00e2\u0080\u009d demanded those who had been really asleep, and who had wakened to\nthey knew not what.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the bloody mate!\u00e2\u0080\u009d was Leach\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crafty answer, strained from him in a\nsmothered sort of way.\n\nThis was greeted with whoops of joy, and from then on Wolf Larsen had\nseven strong men on top of him, Louis, I believe, taking no part in it.\nThe forecastle was like an angry hive of bees aroused by some marauder.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat ho! below there!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I heard Latimer shout down the scuttle, too\ncautious to descend into the inferno of passion he could hear raging\nbeneath him in the darkness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t somebody get a knife?  Oh, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t somebody get a knife?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Leach\npleaded in the first interval of comparative silence.\n\nThe number of the assailants was a cause of confusion.  They blocked\ntheir own efforts, while Wolf Larsen, with but a single purpose, achieved\nhis.  This was to fight his way across the floor to the ladder.  Though\nin total darkness, I followed his progress by its sound.  No man less\nthan a giant could have done what he did, once he had gained the foot of\nthe ladder.  Step by step, by the might of his arms, the whole pack of\nmen striving to drag him back and down, he drew his body up from the\nfloor till he stood erect.  And then, step by step, hand and foot, he\nslowly struggled up the ladder.\n\nThe very last of all, I saw.  For Latimer, having finally gone for a\nlantern, held it so that its light shone down the scuttle.  Wolf Larsen\nwas nearly to the top, though I could not see him.  All that was visible\nwas the mass of men fastened upon him.  It squirmed about, like some huge\nmany-legged spider, and swayed back and forth to the regular roll of the\nvessel.  And still, step by step with long intervals between, the mass\nascended.  Once it tottered, about to fall back, but the broken hold was\nregained and it still went up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Latimer cried.\n\nIn the rays of the lantern I could see his perplexed face peering down.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLarsen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I heard a muffled voice from within the mass.\n\nLatimer reached down with his free hand.  I saw a hand shoot up to clasp\nhis.  Latimer pulled, and the next couple of steps were made with a rush.\nThen Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other hand reached up and clutched the edge of the\nscuttle.  The mass swung clear of the ladder, the men still clinging to\ntheir escaping foe.  They began to drop off, to be brushed off against\nthe sharp edge of the scuttle, to be knocked off by the legs which were\nnow kicking powerfully.  Leach was the last to go, falling sheer back\nfrom the top of the scuttle and striking on head and shoulders upon his\nsprawling mates beneath.  Wolf Larsen and the lantern disappeared, and we\nwere left in darkness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nThere was a deal of cursing and groaning as the men at the bottom of the\nladder crawled to their feet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSomebody strike a light, my thumb\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out of joint,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one of the men,\nParsons, a swarthy, saturnine man, boat-steerer in Standish\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boat, in\nwhich Harrison was puller.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find it knockin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 about by the bitts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Leach said, sitting down on\nthe edge of the bunk in which I was concealed.\n\nThere was a fumbling and a scratching of matches, and the sea-lamp flared\nup, dim and smoky, and in its weird light bare-legged men moved about\nnursing their bruises and caring for their hurts.  Oofty-Oofty laid hold\nof Parsons\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thumb, pulling it out stoutly and snapping it back into\nplace.  I noticed at the same time that the Kanaka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knuckles were laid\nopen clear across and to the bone.  He exhibited them, exposing beautiful\nwhite teeth in a grin as he did so, and explaining that the wounds had\ncome from striking Wolf Larsen in the mouth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo it was you, was it, you black beggar?\u00e2\u0080\u009d belligerently demanded one\nKelly, an Irish-American and a longshoreman, making his first trip to\nsea, and boat-puller for Kerfoot.\n\nAs he made the demand he spat out a mouthful of blood and teeth and\nshoved his pugnacious face close to Oofty-Oofty.  The Kanaka leaped\nbackward to his bunk, to return with a second leap, flourishing a long\nknife.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAw, go lay down, you make me tired,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Leach interfered.  He was\nevidently, for all of his youth and inexperience, cock of the forecastle.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cG\u00e2\u0080\u0099wan, you Kelly.  You leave Oofty alone.  How in hell did he know it\nwas you in the dark?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nKelly subsided with some muttering, and the Kanaka flashed his white\nteeth in a grateful smile.  He was a beautiful creature, almost feminine\nin the pleasing lines of his figure, and there was a softness and\ndreaminess in his large eyes which seemed to contradict his well-earned\nreputation for strife and action.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow did he get away?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Johnson asked.\n\nHe was sitting on the side of his bunk, the whole pose of his figure\nindicating utter dejection and hopelessness.  He was still breathing\nheavily from the exertion he had made.  His shirt had been ripped\nentirely from him in the struggle, and blood from a gash in the cheek was\nflowing down his naked chest, marking a red path across his white thigh\nand dripping to the floor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause he is the devil, as I told you before,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was Leach\u00e2\u0080\u0099s answer; and\nthereat he was on his feet and raging his disappointment with tears in\nhis eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd not one of you to get a knife!\u00e2\u0080\u009d was his unceasing lament.\n\nBut the rest of the hands had a lively fear of consequences to come and\ngave no heed to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll he know which was which?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kelly asked, and as he went on he\nlooked murderously about him\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cunless one of us peaches.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know as soon as ever he claps eyes on us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Parsons replied.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne\nlook at you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be enough.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell him the deck flopped up and gouged yer teeth out iv yer jaw,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Louis\ngrinned.  He was the only man who was not out of his bunk, and he was\njubilant in that he possessed no bruises to advertise that he had had a\nhand in the night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust wait till he gets a glimpse iv yer mugs\nto-morrow, the gang iv ye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he chuckled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say we thought it was the mate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one.  And another, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know\nwhat I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say\u00e2\u0080\u0094that I heered a row, jumped out of my bunk, got a jolly\ngood crack on the jaw for my pains, and sailed in myself.  Couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell\nwho or what it was in the dark and just hit out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAn\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0099twas me you hit, of course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kelly seconded, his face brightening\nfor the moment.\n\nLeach and Johnson took no part in the discussion, and it was plain to see\nthat their mates looked upon them as men for whom the worst was\ninevitable, who were beyond hope and already dead.  Leach stood their\nfears and reproaches for some time.  Then he broke out:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou make me tired!  A nice lot of gazabas you are!  If you talked less\nwith yer mouth and did something with yer hands, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d a-ben done with by\nnow.  Why couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t one of you, just one of you, get me a knife when I\nsung out?  You make me sick!  A-beefin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and bellerin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0099round, as though\nhe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d kill you when he gets you!  You know damn well he wont.  Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nafford to.  No shipping masters or beach-combers over here, and he wants\nyer in his business, and he wants yer bad.  Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to pull or steer or\nsail ship if he loses yer?  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s me and Johnson have to face the music.\nGet into yer bunks, now, and shut yer faces; I want to get some sleep.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right all right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Parsons spoke up.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMebbe he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do for\nus, but mark my words, hell \u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be an ice-box to this ship from now on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAll the while I had been apprehensive concerning my own predicament.\nWhat would happen to me when these men discovered my presence?  I could\nnever fight my way out as Wolf Larsen had done.  And at this moment\nLatimer called down the scuttles:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHump!  The old man wants you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t down here!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Parsons called back.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, he is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, sliding out of the bunk and striving my hardest to\nkeep my voice steady and bold.\n\nThe sailors looked at me in consternation.  Fear was strong in their\nfaces, and the devilishness which comes of fear.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m coming!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I shouted up to Latimer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kelly cried, stepping between me and the ladder, his\nright hand shaped into a veritable strangler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clutch.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou damn little\nsneak!  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll shut yer mouth!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet him go,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Leach commanded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot on yer life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the angry retort.\n\nLeach never changed his position on the edge of the bunk.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet him go, I\nsay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he repeated; but this time his voice was gritty and metallic.\n\nThe Irishman wavered.  I made to step by him, and he stood aside.  When I\nhad gained the ladder, I turned to the circle of brutal and malignant\nfaces peering at me through the semi-darkness.  A sudden and deep\nsympathy welled up in me.  I remembered the Cockney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way of putting it.\nHow God must have hated them that they should be tortured so!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have seen and heard nothing, believe me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said quietly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell yer, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I could hear Leach saying as I went up the\nladder.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like the old man no more nor you or me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI found Wolf Larsen in the cabin, stripped and bloody, waiting for me.\nHe greeted me with one of his whimsical smiles.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, get to work, Doctor.  The signs are favourable for an extensive\npractice this voyage.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what the _Ghost_ would have been\nwithout you, and if I could only cherish such noble sentiments I would\ntell you her master is deeply grateful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI knew the run of the simple medicine-chest the _Ghost_ carried, and\nwhile I was heating water on the cabin stove and getting the things ready\nfor dressing his wounds, he moved about, laughing and chatting, and\nexamining his hurts with a calculating eye.  I had never before seen him\nstripped, and the sight of his body quite took my breath away.  It has\nnever been my weakness to exalt the flesh\u00e2\u0080\u0094far from it; but there is\nenough of the artist in me to appreciate its wonder.\n\nI must say that I was fascinated by the perfect lines of Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfigure, and by what I may term the terrible beauty of it.  I had noted\nthe men in the forecastle.  Powerfully muscled though some of them were,\nthere had been something wrong with all of them, an insufficient\ndevelopment here, an undue development there, a twist or a crook that\ndestroyed symmetry, legs too short or too long, or too much sinew or bone\nexposed, or too little.  Oofty-Oofty had been the only one whose lines\nwere at all pleasing, while, in so far as they pleased, that far had they\nbeen what I should call feminine.\n\nBut Wolf Larsen was the man-type, the masculine, and almost a god in his\nperfectness.  As he moved about or raised his arms the great muscles\nleapt and moved under the satiny skin.  I have forgotten to say that the\nbronze ended with his face.  His body, thanks to his Scandinavian stock,\nwas fair as the fairest woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  I remember his putting his hand up to\nfeel of the wound on his head, and my watching the biceps move like a\nliving thing under its white sheath.  It was the biceps that had nearly\ncrushed out my life once, that I had seen strike so many killing blows.\nI could not take my eyes from him.  I stood motionless, a roll of\nantiseptic cotton in my hand unwinding and spilling itself down to the\nfloor.\n\nHe noticed me, and I became conscious that I was staring at him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod made you well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid he?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have often thought so myself, and wondered\nwhy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPurpose\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d I began.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUtility,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he interrupted.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis body was made for use.  These muscles\nwere made to grip, and tear, and destroy living things that get between\nme and life.  But have you thought of the other living things?  They,\ntoo, have muscles, of one kind and another, made to grip, and tear, and\ndestroy; and when they come between me and life, I out-grip them,\nout-tear them, out-destroy them.  Purpose does not explain that.  Utility\ndoes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not beautiful,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I protested.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLife isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, you mean,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he smiled.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYet you say I was made well.  Do you\nsee this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe braced his legs and feet, pressing the cabin floor with his toes in a\nclutching sort of way.  Knots and ridges and mounds of muscles writhed\nand bunched under the skin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFeel them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he commanded.\n\nThey were hard as iron.  And I observed, also, that his whole body had\nunconsciously drawn itself together, tense and alert; that muscles were\nsoftly crawling and shaping about the hips, along the back, and across\nthe shoulders; that the arms were slightly lifted, their muscles\ncontracting, the fingers crooking till the hands were like talons; and\nthat even the eyes had changed expression and into them were coming\nwatchfulness and measurement and a light none other than of battle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStability, equilibrium,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, relaxing on the instant and sinking\nhis body back into repose.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFeet with which to clutch the ground, legs\nto stand on and to help withstand, while with arms and hands, teeth and\nnails, I struggle to kill and to be not killed.  Purpose?  Utility is the\nbetter word.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI did not argue.  I had seen the mechanism of the primitive fighting\nbeast, and I was as strongly impressed as if I had seen the engines of a\ngreat battleship or Atlantic liner.\n\nI was surprised, considering the fierce struggle in the forecastle, at\nthe superficiality of his hurts, and I pride myself that I dressed them\ndexterously.  With the exception of several bad wounds, the rest were\nmerely severe bruises and lacerations.  The blow which he had received\nbefore going overboard had laid his scalp open several inches.  This,\nunder his direction, I cleansed and sewed together, having first shaved\nthe edges of the wound.  Then the calf of his leg was badly lacerated and\nlooked as though it had been mangled by a bulldog.  Some sailor, he told\nme, had laid hold of it by his teeth, at the beginning of the fight, and\nhung on and been dragged to the top of the forecastle ladder, when he was\nkicked loose.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the way, Hump, as I have remarked, you are a handy man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen\nbegan, when my work was done.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs you know, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re short a mate.\nHereafter you shall stand watches, receive seventy-five dollars per\nmonth, and be addressed fore and aft as Mr. Van Weyden.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0094I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand navigation, you know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I gasped.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot necessary at all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI really do not care to sit in the high places,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I objected.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI find\nlife precarious enough in my present humble situation.  I have no\nexperience.  Mediocrity, you see, has its compensations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe smiled as though it were all settled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be mate on this hell-ship!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried defiantly.\n\nI saw his face grow hard and the merciless glitter come into his eyes.\nHe walked to the door of his room, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now, Mr. Van Weyden, good-night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-night, Mr. Larsen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered weakly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nI cannot say that the position of mate carried with it anything more\njoyful than that there were no more dishes to wash.  I was ignorant of\nthe simplest duties of mate, and would have fared badly indeed, had the\nsailors not sympathized with me.  I knew nothing of the minuti\u00c3\u00a6 of ropes\nand rigging, of the trimming and setting of sails; but the sailors took\npains to put me to rights,\u00e2\u0080\u0094Louis proving an especially good teacher,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\nI had little trouble with those under me.\n\nWith the hunters it was otherwise.  Familiar in varying degree with the\nsea, they took me as a sort of joke.  In truth, it was a joke to me, that\nI, the veriest landsman, should be filling the office of mate; but to be\ntaken as a joke by others was a different matter.  I made no complaint,\nbut Wolf Larsen demanded the most punctilious sea etiquette in my\ncase,\u00e2\u0080\u0094far more than poor Johansen had ever received; and at the expense\nof several rows, threats, and much grumbling, he brought the hunters to\ntime.  I was \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Van Weyden\u00e2\u0080\u009d fore and aft, and it was only unofficially\nthat Wolf Larsen himself ever addressed me as \u00e2\u0080\u009cHump.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was amusing.  Perhaps the wind would haul a few points while we were\nat dinner, and as I left the table he would say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Van Weyden, will\nyou kindly put about on the port tack.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And I would go on deck, beckon\nLouis to me, and learn from him what was to be done.  Then, a few minutes\nlater, having digested his instructions and thoroughly mastered the\nman\u00c5\u0093uvre, I would proceed to issue my orders.  I remember an early\ninstance of this kind, when Wolf Larsen appeared on the scene just as I\nhad begun to give orders.  He smoked his cigar and looked on quietly till\nthe thing was accomplished, and then paced aft by my side along the\nweather poop.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI beg pardon, Mr. Van Weyden, I congratulate you.  I\nthink you can now fire your father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs back into the grave to him.\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve discovered your own and learned to stand on them.  A little\nrope-work, sail-making, and experience with storms and such things, and\nby the end of the voyage you could ship on any coasting schooner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was during this period, between the death of Johansen and the arrival\non the sealing grounds, that I passed my pleasantest hours on the\n_Ghost_.  Wolf Larsen was quite considerate, the sailors helped me, and I\nwas no longer in irritating contact with Thomas Mugridge.  And I make\nfree to say, as the days went by, that I found I was taking a certain\nsecret pride in myself.  Fantastic as the situation was,\u00e2\u0080\u0094a land-lubber\nsecond in command,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I was, nevertheless, carrying it off well; and during\nthat brief time I was proud of myself, and I grew to love the heave and\nroll of the _Ghost_ under my feet as she wallowed north and west through\nthe tropic sea to the islet where we filled our water-casks.\n\nBut my happiness was not unalloyed.  It was comparative, a period of less\nmisery slipped in between a past of great miseries and a future of great\nmiseries.  For the _Ghost_, so far as the seamen were concerned, was a\nhell-ship of the worst description.  They never had a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rest or\npeace.  Wolf Larsen treasured against them the attempt on his life and\nthe drubbing he had received in the forecastle; and morning, noon, and\nnight, and all night as well, he devoted himself to making life unlivable\nfor them.\n\nHe knew well the psychology of the little thing, and it was the little\nthings by which he kept the crew worked up to the verge of madness.  I\nhave seen Harrison called from his bunk to put properly away a misplaced\npaintbrush, and the two watches below haled from their tired sleep to\naccompany him and see him do it.  A little thing, truly, but when\nmultiplied by the thousand ingenious devices of such a mind, the mental\nstate of the men in the forecastle may be slightly comprehended.\n\nOf course much grumbling went on, and little outbursts were continually\noccurring.  Blows were struck, and there were always two or three men\nnursing injuries at the hands of the human beast who was their master.\nConcerted action was impossible in face of the heavy arsenal of weapons\ncarried in the steerage and cabin.  Leach and Johnson were the two\nparticular victims of Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diabolic temper, and the look of\nprofound melancholy which had settled on Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face and in his eyes\nmade my heart bleed.\n\nWith Leach it was different.  There was too much of the fighting beast in\nhim.  He seemed possessed by an insatiable fury which gave no time for\ngrief.  His lips had become distorted into a permanent snarl, which at\nmere sight of Wolf Larsen broke out in sound, horrible and menacing and,\nI do believe, unconsciously.  I have seen him follow Wolf Larsen about\nwith his eyes, like an animal its keeper, the while the animal-like snarl\nsounded deep in his throat and vibrated forth between his teeth.\n\nI remember once, on deck, in bright day, touching him on the shoulder as\npreliminary to giving an order.  His back was toward me, and at the first\nfeel of my hand he leaped upright in the air and away from me, snarling\nand turning his head as he leaped.  He had for the moment mistaken me for\nthe man he hated.\n\nBoth he and Johnson would have killed Wolf Larsen at the slightest\nopportunity, but the opportunity never came.  Wolf Larsen was too wise\nfor that, and, besides, they had no adequate weapons.  With their fists\nalone they had no chance whatever.  Time and again he fought it out with\nLeach who fought back always, like a wildcat, tooth and nail and fist,\nuntil stretched, exhausted or unconscious, on the deck.  And he was never\naverse to another encounter.  All the devil that was in him challenged\nthe devil in Wolf Larsen.  They had but to appear on deck at the same\ntime, when they would be at it, cursing, snarling, striking; and I have\nseen Leach fling himself upon Wolf Larsen without warning or provocation.\nOnce he threw his heavy sheath-knife, missing Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s throat by an\ninch.  Another time he dropped a steel marlinspike from the mizzen\ncrosstree.  It was a difficult cast to make on a rolling ship, but the\nsharp point of the spike, whistling seventy-five feet through the air,\nbarely missed Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head as he emerged from the cabin\ncompanion-way and drove its length two inches and over into the solid\ndeck-planking.  Still another time, he stole into the steerage, possessed\nhimself of a loaded shot-gun, and was making a rush for the deck with it\nwhen caught by Kerfoot and disarmed.\n\nI often wondered why Wolf Larsen did not kill him and make an end of it.\nBut he only laughed and seemed to enjoy it.  There seemed a certain spice\nabout it, such as men must feel who take delight in making pets of\nferocious animals.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt gives a thrill to life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he explained to me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen life is carried in\none\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand.  Man is a natural gambler, and life is the biggest stake he\ncan lay.  The greater the odds, the greater the thrill.  Why should I\ndeny myself the joy of exciting Leach\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soul to fever-pitch?  For that\nmatter, I do him a kindness.  The greatness of sensation is mutual.  He\nis living more royally than any man for\u00e2\u0080\u0099ard, though he does not know it.\nFor he has what they have not\u00e2\u0080\u0094purpose, something to do and be done, an\nall-absorbing end to strive to attain, the desire to kill me, the hope\nthat he may kill me.  Really, Hump, he is living deep and high.  I doubt\nthat he has ever lived so swiftly and keenly before, and I honestly envy\nhim, sometimes, when I see him raging at the summit of passion and\nsensibility.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, but it is cowardly, cowardly!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have all the\nadvantage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf the two of us, you and I, who is the greater coward?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked\nseriously.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the situation is unpleasing, you compromise with your\nconscience when you make yourself a party to it.  If you were really\ngreat, really true to yourself, you would join forces with Leach and\nJohnson.  But you are afraid, you are afraid.  You want to live.  The\nlife that is in you cries out that it must live, no matter what the cost;\nso you live ignominiously, untrue to the best you dream of, sinning\nagainst your whole pitiful little code, and, if there were a hell,\nheading your soul straight for it.  Bah!  I play the braver part.  I do\nno sin, for I am true to the promptings of the life that is in me.  I am\nsincere with my soul at least, and that is what you are not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was a sting in what he said.  Perhaps, after all, I was playing a\ncowardly part.  And the more I thought about it the more it appeared that\nmy duty to myself lay in doing what he had advised, lay in joining forces\nwith Johnson and Leach and working for his death.  Right here, I think,\nentered the austere conscience of my Puritan ancestry, impelling me\ntoward lurid deeds and sanctioning even murder as right conduct.  I dwelt\nupon the idea.  It would be a most moral act to rid the world of such a\nmonster.  Humanity would be better and happier for it, life fairer and\nsweeter.\n\nI pondered it long, lying sleepless in my bunk and reviewing in endless\nprocession the facts of the situation.  I talked with Johnson and Leach,\nduring the night watches when Wolf Larsen was below.  Both men had lost\nhope\u00e2\u0080\u0094Johnson, because of temperamental despondency; Leach, because he had\nbeaten himself out in the vain struggle and was exhausted.  But he caught\nmy hand in a passionate grip one night, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think yer square, Mr. Van Weyden.  But stay where you are and keep yer\nmouth shut.  Say nothin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 but saw wood.  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dead men, I know it; but\nall the same you might be able to do us a favour some time when we need\nit damn bad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was only next day, when Wainwright Island loomed to windward, close\nabeam, that Wolf Larsen opened his mouth in prophecy.  He had attacked\nJohnson, been attacked by Leach, and had just finished whipping the pair\nof them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLeach,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou know I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to kill you some time or other,\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA snarl was the answer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd as for you, Johnson, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get so tired of life before I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m through\nwith you that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll fling yourself over the side.  See if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a suggestion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, in an aside to me.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bet you a\nmonth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pay he acts upon it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI had cherished a hope that his victims would find an opportunity to\nescape while filling our water-barrels, but Wolf Larsen had selected his\nspot well.  The _Ghost_ lay half-a-mile beyond the surf-line of a lonely\nbeach.  Here debauched a deep gorge, with precipitous, volcanic walls\nwhich no man could scale.  And here, under his direct supervision\u00e2\u0080\u0094for he\nwent ashore himself\u00e2\u0080\u0094Leach and Johnson filled the small casks and rolled\nthem down to the beach.  They had no chance to make a break for liberty\nin one of the boats.\n\nHarrison and Kelly, however, made such an attempt.  They composed one of\nthe boats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 crews, and their task was to ply between the schooner and the\nshore, carrying a single cask each trip.  Just before dinner, starting\nfor the beach with an empty barrel, they altered their course and bore\naway to the left to round the promontory which jutted into the sea\nbetween them and liberty.  Beyond its foaming base lay the pretty\nvillages of the Japanese colonists and smiling valleys which penetrated\ndeep into the interior.  Once in the fastnesses they promised, and the\ntwo men could defy Wolf Larsen.\n\nI had observed Henderson and Smoke loitering about the deck all morning,\nand I now learned why they were there.  Procuring their rifles, they\nopened fire in a leisurely manner, upon the deserters.  It was a\ncold-blooded exhibition of marksmanship.  At first their bullets zipped\nharmlessly along the surface of the water on either side the boat; but,\nas the men continued to pull lustily, they struck closer and closer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, watch me take Kelly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right oar,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Smoke said, drawing a more\ncareful aim.\n\nI was looking through the glasses, and I saw the oar-blade shatter as he\nshot.  Henderson duplicated it, selecting Harrison\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right oar.  The boat\nslewed around.  The two remaining oars were quickly broken.  The men\ntried to row with the splinters, and had them shot out of their hands.\nKelly ripped up a bottom board and began paddling, but dropped it with a\ncry of pain as its splinters drove into his hands.  Then they gave up,\nletting the boat drift till a second boat, sent from the shore by Wolf\nLarsen, took them in tow and brought them aboard.\n\nLate that afternoon we hove up anchor and got away.  Nothing was before\nus but the three or four months\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hunting on the sealing grounds.  The\noutlook was black indeed, and I went about my work with a heavy heart.\nAn almost funereal gloom seemed to have descended upon the _Ghost_.  Wolf\nLarsen had taken to his bunk with one of his strange, splitting\nheadaches.  Harrison stood listlessly at the wheel, half supporting\nhimself by it, as though wearied by the weight of his flesh.  The rest of\nthe men were morose and silent.  I came upon Kelly crouching to the lee\nof the forecastle scuttle, his head on his knees, his arms about his\nhead, in an attitude of unutterable despondency.\n\nJohnson I found lying full length on the forecastle head, staring at the\ntroubled churn of the forefoot, and I remembered with horror the\nsuggestion Wolf Larsen had made.  It seemed likely to bear fruit.  I\ntried to break in on the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s morbid thoughts by calling him away, but\nhe smiled sadly at me and refused to obey.\n\nLeach approached me as I returned aft.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to ask a favour, Mr. Van Weyden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yer luck to\never make \u00e2\u0080\u0099Frisco once more, will you hunt up Matt McCarthy?  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my old\nman.  He lives on the Hill, back of the Mayfair bakery, runnin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a\ncobbler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shop that everybody knows, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have no trouble.  Tell\nhim I lived to be sorry for the trouble I brought him and the things I\ndone, and\u00e2\u0080\u0094and just tell him \u00e2\u0080\u0098God bless him,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI nodded my head, but said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll all win back to San Francisco, Leach,\nand you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be with me when I go to see Matt McCarthy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to believe you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered, shaking my hand, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\nWolf Larsen \u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do for me, I know it; and all I can hope is, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do it\nquick.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd as he left me I was aware of the same desire at my heart.  Since it\nwas to be done, let it be done with despatch.  The general gloom had\ngathered me into its folds.  The worst appeared inevitable; and as I\npaced the deck, hour after hour, I found myself afflicted with Wolf\nLarsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s repulsive ideas.  What was it all about?  Where was the grandeur\nof life that it should permit such wanton destruction of human souls?  It\nwas a cheap and sordid thing after all, this life, and the sooner over\nthe better.  Over and done with!  I, too, leaned upon the rail and gazed\nlongingly into the sea, with the certainty that sooner or later I should\nbe sinking down, down, through the cool green depths of its oblivion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nStrange to say, in spite of the general foreboding, nothing of especial\nmoment happened on the _Ghost_.  We ran on to the north and west till we\nraised the coast of Japan and picked up with the great seal herd.  Coming\nfrom no man knew where in the illimitable Pacific, it was travelling\nnorth on its annual migration to the rookeries of Bering Sea.  And north\nwe travelled with it, ravaging and destroying, flinging the naked\ncarcasses to the shark and salting down the skins so that they might\nlater adorn the fair shoulders of the women of the cities.\n\nIt was wanton slaughter, and all for woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake.  No man ate of the\nseal meat or the oil.  After a good day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s killing I have seen our decks\ncovered with hides and bodies, slippery with fat and blood, the scuppers\nrunning red; masts, ropes, and rails spattered with the sanguinary\ncolour; and the men, like butchers plying their trade, naked and red of\narm and hand, hard at work with ripping and flensing-knives, removing the\nskins from the pretty sea-creatures they had killed.\n\nIt was my task to tally the pelts as they came aboard from the boats, to\noversee the skinning and afterward the cleansing of the decks and\nbringing things ship-shape again.  It was not pleasant work.  My soul and\nmy stomach revolted at it; and yet, in a way, this handling and directing\nof many men was good for me.  It developed what little executive ability\nI possessed, and I was aware of a toughening or hardening which I was\nundergoing and which could not be anything but wholesome for \u00e2\u0080\u009cSissy\u00e2\u0080\u009d Van\nWeyden.\n\nOne thing I was beginning to feel, and that was that I could never again\nbe quite the same man I had been.  While my hope and faith in human life\nstill survived Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s destructive criticism, he had nevertheless\nbeen a cause of change in minor matters.  He had opened up for me the\nworld of the real, of which I had known practically nothing and from\nwhich I had always shrunk.  I had learned to look more closely at life as\nit was lived, to recognize that there were such things as facts in the\nworld, to emerge from the realm of mind and idea and to place certain\nvalues on the concrete and objective phases of existence.\n\nI saw more of Wolf Larsen than ever when we had gained the grounds.  For\nwhen the weather was fair and we were in the midst of the herd, all hands\nwere away in the boats, and left on board were only he and I, and Thomas\nMugridge, who did not count.  But there was no play about it.  The six\nboats, spreading out fan-wise from the schooner until the first weather\nboat and the last lee boat were anywhere from ten to twenty miles apart,\ncruised along a straight course over the sea till nightfall or bad\nweather drove them in.  It was our duty to sail the _Ghost_ well to\nleeward of the last lee boat, so that all the boats should have fair wind\nto run for us in case of squalls or threatening weather.\n\nIt is no slight matter for two men, particularly when a stiff wind has\nsprung up, to handle a vessel like the _Ghost_, steering, keeping\nlook-out for the boats, and setting or taking in sail; so it devolved\nupon me to learn, and learn quickly.  Steering I picked up easily, but\nrunning aloft to the crosstrees and swinging my whole weight by my arms\nwhen I left the ratlines and climbed still higher, was more difficult.\nThis, too, I learned, and quickly, for I felt somehow a wild desire to\nvindicate myself in Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes, to prove my right to live in ways\nother than of the mind.  Nay, the time came when I took joy in the run of\nthe masthead and in the clinging on by my legs at that precarious height\nwhile I swept the sea with glasses in search of the boats.\n\nI remember one beautiful day, when the boats left early and the reports\nof the hunters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 guns grew dim and distant and died away as they scattered\nfar and wide over the sea.  There was just the faintest wind from the\nwestward; but it breathed its last by the time we managed to get to\nleeward of the last lee boat.  One by one\u00e2\u0080\u0094I was at the masthead and\nsaw\u00e2\u0080\u0094the six boats disappeared over the bulge of the earth as they\nfollowed the seal into the west.  We lay, scarcely rolling on the placid\nsea, unable to follow.  Wolf Larsen was apprehensive.  The barometer was\ndown, and the sky to the east did not please him.  He studied it with\nunceasing vigilance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf she comes out of there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009chard and snappy, putting us to\nwindward of the boats, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely there\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be empty bunks in steerage\nand fo\u00e2\u0080\u0099c\u00e2\u0080\u0099sle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBy eleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock the sea had become glass.  By midday, though we were\nwell up in the northerly latitudes, the heat was sickening.  There was no\nfreshness in the air.  It was sultry and oppressive, reminding me of what\nthe old Californians term \u00e2\u0080\u009cearthquake weather.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  There was something\nominous about it, and in intangible ways one was made to feel that the\nworst was about to come.  Slowly the whole eastern sky filled with clouds\nthat over-towered us like some black sierra of the infernal regions.  So\nclearly could one see ca\u00c3\u00b1on, gorge, and precipice, and the shadows that\nlie therein, that one looked unconsciously for the white surf-line and\nbellowing caverns where the sea charges on the land.  And still we rocked\ngently, and there was no wind.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no square\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cOld Mother Nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to get up\non her hind legs and howl for all that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in her, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll keep us\njumping, Hump, to pull through with half our boats.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d better run up\nand loosen the topsails.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if it is going to howl, and there are only two of us?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked, a\nnote of protest in my voice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to make the best of the first of it and run down to our\nboats before our canvas is ripped out of us.  After that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give a\nrap what happens.  The sticks \u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stand it, and you and I will have to,\nthough we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve plenty cut out for us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nStill the calm continued.  We ate dinner, a hurried and anxious meal for\nme with eighteen men abroad on the sea and beyond the bulge of the earth,\nand with that heaven-rolling mountain range of clouds moving slowly down\nupon us.  Wolf Larsen did not seem affected, however; though I noticed,\nwhen we returned to the deck, a slight twitching of the nostrils, a\nperceptible quickness of movement.  His face was stern, the lines of it\nhad grown hard, and yet in his eyes\u00e2\u0080\u0094blue, clear blue this day\u00e2\u0080\u0094there was a\nstrange brilliancy, a bright scintillating light.  It struck me that he\nwas joyous, in a ferocious sort of way; that he was glad there was an\nimpending struggle; that he was thrilled and upborne with knowledge that\none of the great moments of living, when the tide of life surges up in\nflood, was upon him.\n\nOnce, and unwitting that he did so or that I saw, he laughed aloud,\nmockingly and defiantly, at the advancing storm.  I see him yet standing\nthere like a pigmy out of the _Arabian Nights_ before the huge front of\nsome malignant genie.  He was daring destiny, and he was unafraid.\n\nHe walked to the galley.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cCooky, by the time you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve finished pots and\npans you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be wanted on deck.  Stand ready for a call.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, becoming cognizant of the fascinated gaze I bent upon\nhim, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis beats whisky and is where your Omar misses.  I think he only\nhalf lived after all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe western half of the sky had by now grown murky.  The sun had dimmed\nand faded out of sight.  It was two in the afternoon, and a ghostly\ntwilight, shot through by wandering purplish lights, had descended upon\nus.  In this purplish light Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face glowed and glowed, and to\nmy excited fancy he appeared encircled by a halo.  We lay in the midst of\nan unearthly quiet, while all about us were signs and omens of oncoming\nsound and movement.  The sultry heat had become unendurable.  The sweat\nwas standing on my forehead, and I could feel it trickling down my nose.\nI felt as though I should faint, and reached out to the rail for support.\n\nAnd then, just then, the faintest possible whisper of air passed by.  It\nwas from the east, and like a whisper it came and went.  The drooping\ncanvas was not stirred, and yet my face had felt the air and been cooled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCooky,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen called in a low voice.  Thomas Mugridge turned a\npitiable scared face.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet go that foreboom tackle and pass it across,\nand when she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s willing let go the sheet and come in snug with the tackle.\nAnd if you make a mess of it, it will be the last you ever make.\nUnderstand?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Van Weyden, stand by to pass the head-sails over.  Then jump for the\ntopsails and spread them quick as God\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll let you\u00e2\u0080\u0094the quicker you do it\nthe easier you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find it.  As for Cooky, if he isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lively bat him\nbetween the eyes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI was aware of the compliment and pleased, in that no threat had\naccompanied my instructions.  We were lying head to north-west, and it\nwas his intention to jibe over all with the first puff.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have the breeze on our quarter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he explained to me.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the last\nguns the boats were bearing away slightly to the south\u00e2\u0080\u0099ard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe turned and walked aft to the wheel.  I went forward and took my\nstation at the jibs.  Another whisper of wind, and another, passed by.\nThe canvas flapped lazily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank Gawd she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not comin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 all of a bunch, Mr. Van Weyden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the\nCockney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fervent ejaculation.\n\nAnd I was indeed thankful, for I had by this time learned enough to know,\nwith all our canvas spread, what disaster in such event awaited us.  The\nwhispers of wind became puffs, the sails filled, the _Ghost_ moved.  Wolf\nLarsen put the wheel hard up, to port, and we began to pay off.  The wind\nwas now dead astern, muttering and puffing stronger and stronger, and my\nhead-sails were pounding lustily.  I did not see what went on elsewhere,\nthough I felt the sudden surge and heel of the schooner as the\nwind-pressures changed to the jibing of the fore- and main-sails.  My\nhands were full with the flying-jib, jib, and staysail; and by the time\nthis part of my task was accomplished the _Ghost_ was leaping into the\nsouth-west, the wind on her quarter and all her sheets to starboard.\nWithout pausing for breath, though my heart was beating like a\ntrip-hammer from my exertions, I sprang to the topsails, and before the\nwind had become too strong we had them fairly set and were coiling down.\nThen I went aft for orders.\n\nWolf Larsen nodded approval and relinquished the wheel to me.  The wind\nwas strengthening steadily and the sea rising.  For an hour I steered,\neach moment becoming more difficult.  I had not the experience to steer\nat the gait we were going on a quartering course.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow take a run up with the glasses and raise some of the boats.  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\nmade at least ten knots, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going twelve or thirteen now.  The old\ngirl knows how to walk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI contested myself with the fore crosstrees, some seventy feet above the\ndeck.  As I searched the vacant stretch of water before me, I\ncomprehended thoroughly the need for haste if we were to recover any of\nour men.  Indeed, as I gazed at the heavy sea through which we were\nrunning, I doubted that there was a boat afloat.  It did not seem\npossible that such frail craft could survive such stress of wind and\nwater.\n\nI could not feel the full force of the wind, for we were running with it;\nbut from my lofty perch I looked down as though outside the _Ghost_ and\napart from her, and saw the shape of her outlined sharply against the\nfoaming sea as she tore along instinct with life.  Sometimes she would\nlift and send across some great wave, burying her starboard-rail from\nview, and covering her deck to the hatches with the boiling ocean.  At\nsuch moments, starting from a windward roll, I would go flying through\nthe air with dizzying swiftness, as though I clung to the end of a huge,\ninverted pendulum, the arc of which, between the greater rolls, must have\nbeen seventy feet or more.  Once, the terror of this giddy sweep\noverpowered me, and for a while I clung on, hand and foot, weak and\ntrembling, unable to search the sea for the missing boats or to behold\naught of the sea but that which roared beneath and strove to overwhelm\nthe _Ghost_.\n\nBut the thought of the men in the midst of it steadied me, and in my\nquest for them I forgot myself.  For an hour I saw nothing but the naked,\ndesolate sea.  And then, where a vagrant shaft of sunlight struck the\nocean and turned its surface to wrathful silver, I caught a small black\nspeck thrust skyward for an instant and swallowed up.  I waited\npatiently.  Again the tiny point of black projected itself through the\nwrathful blaze a couple of points off our port-bow.  I did not attempt to\nshout, but communicated the news to Wolf Larsen by waving my arm.  He\nchanged the course, and I signalled affirmation when the speck showed\ndead ahead.\n\nIt grew larger, and so swiftly that for the first time I fully\nappreciated the speed of our flight.  Wolf Larsen motioned for me to come\ndown, and when I stood beside him at the wheel gave me instructions for\nheaving to.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cExpect all hell to break loose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cautioned me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind it.\nYours is to do your own work and to have Cooky stand by the fore-sheet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI managed to make my way forward, but there was little choice of sides,\nfor the weather-rail seemed buried as often as the lee.  Having\ninstructed Thomas Mugridge as to what he was to do, I clambered into the\nfore-rigging a few feet.  The boat was now very close, and I could make\nout plainly that it was lying head to wind and sea and dragging on its\nmast and sail, which had been thrown overboard and made to serve as a\nsea-anchor.  The three men were bailing.  Each rolling mountain whelmed\nthem from view, and I would wait with sickening anxiety, fearing that\nthey would never appear again.  Then, and with black suddenness, the boat\nwould shoot clear through the foaming crest, bow pointed to the sky, and\nthe whole length of her bottom showing, wet and dark, till she seemed on\nend.  There would be a fleeting glimpse of the three men flinging water\nin frantic haste, when she would topple over and fall into the yawning\nvalley, bow down and showing her full inside length to the stern upreared\nalmost directly above the bow.  Each time that she reappeared was a\nmiracle.\n\nThe _Ghost_ suddenly changed her course, keeping away, and it came to me\nwith a shock that Wolf Larsen was giving up the rescue as impossible.\nThen I realized that he was preparing to heave to, and dropped to the\ndeck to be in readiness.  We were now dead before the wind, the boat far\naway and abreast of us.  I felt an abrupt easing of the schooner, a loss\nfor the moment of all strain and pressure, coupled with a swift\nacceleration of speed.  She was rushing around on her heel into the wind.\n\nAs she arrived at right angles to the sea, the full force of the wind\n(from which we had hitherto run away) caught us.  I was unfortunately and\nignorantly facing it.  It stood up against me like a wall, filling my\nlungs with air which I could not expel.  And as I choked and strangled,\nand as the _Ghost_ wallowed for an instant, broadside on and rolling\nstraight over and far into the wind, I beheld a huge sea rise far above\nmy head.  I turned aside, caught my breath, and looked again.  The wave\nover-topped the _Ghost_, and I gazed sheer up and into it.  A shaft of\nsunlight smote the over-curl, and I caught a glimpse of translucent,\nrushing green, backed by a milky smother of foam.\n\nThen it descended, pandemonium broke loose, everything happened at once.\nI was struck a crushing, stunning blow, nowhere in particular and yet\neverywhere.  My hold had been broken loose, I was under water, and the\nthought passed through my mind that this was the terrible thing of which\nI had heard, the being swept in the trough of the sea.  My body struck\nand pounded as it was dashed helplessly along and turned over and over,\nand when I could hold my breath no longer, I breathed the stinging salt\nwater into my lungs.  But through it all I clung to the one idea\u00e2\u0080\u0094_I must\nget the jib backed over to windward_.  I had no fear of death.  I had no\ndoubt but that I should come through somehow.  And as this idea of\nfulfilling Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s order persisted in my dazed consciousness, I\nseemed to see him standing at the wheel in the midst of the wild welter,\npitting his will against the will of the storm and defying it.\n\nI brought up violently against what I took to be the rail, breathed, and\nbreathed the sweet air again.  I tried to rise, but struck my head and\nwas knocked back on hands and knees.  By some freak of the waters I had\nbeen swept clear under the forecastle-head and into the eyes.  As I\nscrambled out on all fours, I passed over the body of Thomas Mugridge,\nwho lay in a groaning heap.  There was no time to investigate.  I must\nget the jib backed over.\n\nWhen I emerged on deck it seemed that the end of everything had come.  On\nall sides there was a rending and crashing of wood and steel and canvas.\nThe _Ghost_ was being wrenched and torn to fragments.  The foresail and\nfore-topsail, emptied of the wind by the man\u00c5\u0093uvre, and with no one to\nbring in the sheet in time, were thundering into ribbons, the heavy boom\nthreshing and splintering from rail to rail.  The air was thick with\nflying wreckage, detached ropes and stays were hissing and coiling like\nsnakes, and down through it all crashed the gaff of the foresail.\n\nThe spar could not have missed me by many inches, while it spurred me to\naction.  Perhaps the situation was not hopeless.  I remembered Wolf\nLarsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s caution.  He had expected all hell to break loose, and here it\nwas.  And where was he?  I caught sight of him toiling at the main-sheet,\nheaving it in and flat with his tremendous muscles, the stern of the\nschooner lifted high in the air and his body outlined against a white\nsurge of sea sweeping past.  All this, and more,\u00e2\u0080\u0094a whole world of chaos\nand wreck,\u00e2\u0080\u0094in possibly fifteen seconds I had seen and heard and grasped.\n\nI did not stop to see what had become of the small boat, but sprang to\nthe jib-sheet.  The jib itself was beginning to slap, partially filling\nand emptying with sharp reports; but with a turn of the sheet and the\napplication of my whole strength each time it slapped, I slowly backed\nit.  This I know: I did my best.  I pulled till I burst open the ends of\nall my fingers; and while I pulled, the flying-jib and staysail split\ntheir cloths apart and thundered into nothingness.\n\nStill I pulled, holding what I gained each time with a double turn until\nthe next slap gave me more.  Then the sheet gave with greater ease, and\nWolf Larsen was beside me, heaving in alone while I was busied taking up\nthe slack.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMake fast!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he shouted.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd come on!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs I followed him, I noted that in spite of rack and ruin a rough order\nobtained.  The _Ghost_ was hove to.  She was still in working order, and\nshe was still working.  Though the rest of her sails were gone, the jib,\nbacked to windward, and the mainsail hauled down flat, were themselves\nholding, and holding her bow to the furious sea as well.\n\nI looked for the boat, and, while Wolf Larsen cleared the boat-tackles,\nsaw it lift to leeward on a big sea an not a score of feet away.  And, so\nnicely had he made his calculation, we drifted fairly down upon it, so\nthat nothing remained to do but hook the tackles to either end and hoist\nit aboard.  But this was not done so easily as it is written.\n\nIn the bow was Kerfoot, Oofty-Oofty in the stern, and Kelly amidships.\nAs we drifted closer the boat would rise on a wave while we sank in the\ntrough, till almost straight above me I could see the heads of the three\nmen craned overside and looking down.  Then, the next moment, we would\nlift and soar upward while they sank far down beneath us.  It seemed\nincredible that the next surge should not crush the _Ghost_ down upon the\ntiny eggshell.\n\nBut, at the right moment, I passed the tackle to the Kanaka, while Wolf\nLarsen did the same thing forward to Kerfoot.  Both tackles were hooked\nin a trice, and the three men, deftly timing the roll, made a\nsimultaneous leap aboard the schooner.  As the _Ghost_ rolled her side\nout of water, the boat was lifted snugly against her, and before the\nreturn roll came, we had heaved it in over the side and turned it bottom\nup on the deck.  I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s left hand.  In\nsome way the third finger had been crushed to a pulp.  But he gave no\nsign of pain, and with his single right hand helped us lash the boat in\nits place.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStand by to let that jib over, you Oofty!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen commanded, the\nvery second we had finished with the boat.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cKelly, come aft and slack\noff the main-sheet!  You, Kerfoot, go for\u00e2\u0080\u0099ard and see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s become of\nCooky!  Mr. Van Weyden, run aloft again, and cut away any stray stuff on\nyour way!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd having commanded, he went aft with his peculiar tigerish leaps to the\nwheel.  While I toiled up the fore-shrouds the _Ghost_ slowly paid off.\nThis time, as we went into the trough of the sea and were swept, there\nwere no sails to carry away.  And, halfway to the crosstrees and\nflattened against the rigging by the full force of the wind so that it\nwould have been impossible for me to have fallen, the _Ghost_ almost on\nher beam-ends and the masts parallel with the water, I looked, not down,\nbut at almost right angles from the perpendicular, to the deck of the\n_Ghost_.  But I saw, not the deck, but where the deck should have been,\nfor it was buried beneath a wild tumbling of water.  Out of this water I\ncould see the two masts rising, and that was all.  The _Ghost_, for the\nmoment, was buried beneath the sea.  As she squared off more and more,\nescaping from the side pressure, she righted herself and broke her deck,\nlike a whale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back, through the ocean surface.\n\nThen we raced, and wildly, across the wild sea, the while I hung like a\nfly in the crosstrees and searched for the other boats.  In half-an-hour\nI sighted the second one, swamped and bottom up, to which were\ndesperately clinging Jock Horner, fat Louis, and Johnson.  This time I\nremained aloft, and Wolf Larsen succeeded in heaving to without being\nswept.  As before, we drifted down upon it.  Tackles were made fast and\nlines flung to the men, who scrambled aboard like monkeys.  The boat\nitself was crushed and splintered against the schooner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side as it came\ninboard; but the wreck was securely lashed, for it could be patched and\nmade whole again.\n\nOnce more the _Ghost_ bore away before the storm, this time so submerging\nherself that for some seconds I thought she would never reappear.  Even\nthe wheel, quite a deal higher than the waist, was covered and swept\nagain and again.  At such moments I felt strangely alone with God, alone\nwith him and watching the chaos of his wrath.  And then the wheel would\nreappear, and Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broad shoulders, his hands gripping the\nspokes and holding the schooner to the course of his will, himself an\nearth-god, dominating the storm, flinging its descending waters from him\nand riding it to his own ends.  And oh, the marvel of it! the marvel of\nit!  That tiny men should live and breathe and work, and drive so frail a\ncontrivance of wood and cloth through so tremendous an elemental strife.\n\nAs before, the _Ghost_ swung out of the trough, lifting her deck again\nout of the sea, and dashed before the howling blast.  It was now\nhalf-past five, and half-an-hour later, when the last of the day lost\nitself in a dim and furious twilight, I sighted a third boat.  It was\nbottom up, and there was no sign of its crew.  Wolf Larsen repeated his\nman\u00c5\u0093uvre, holding off and then rounding up to windward and drifting down\nupon it.  But this time he missed by forty feet, the boat passing astern.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNumber four boat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Oofty-Oofty cried, his keen eyes reading its number\nin the one second when it lifted clear of the foam, and upside down.\n\nIt was Henderson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boat and with him had been lost Holyoak and Williams,\nanother of the deep-water crowd.  Lost they indubitably were; but the\nboat remained, and Wolf Larsen made one more reckless effort to recover\nit.  I had come down to the deck, and I saw Horner and Kerfoot vainly\nprotest against the attempt.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy God, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll not be robbed of my boat by any storm that ever blew out of\nhell!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he shouted, and though we four stood with our heads together that\nwe might hear, his voice seemed faint and far, as though removed from us\nan immense distance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Van Weyden!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, and I heard through the tumult as one might\nhear a whisper.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cStand by that jib with Johnson and Oofty!  The rest of\nyou tail aft to the mainsheet!  Lively now! or I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll sail you all into\nKingdom Come!  Understand?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd when he put the wheel hard over and the _Ghost\u00e2\u0080\u0099s_ bow swung off,\nthere was nothing for the hunters to do but obey and make the best of a\nrisky chance.  How great the risk I realized when I was once more buried\nbeneath the pounding seas and clinging for life to the pinrail at the\nfoot of the foremast.  My fingers were torn loose, and I swept across to\nthe side and over the side into the sea.  I could not swim, but before I\ncould sink I was swept back again.  A strong hand gripped me, and when\nthe _Ghost_ finally emerged, I found that I owed my life to Johnson.  I\nsaw him looking anxiously about him, and noted that Kelly, who had come\nforward at the last moment, was missing.\n\nThis time, having missed the boat, and not being in the same position as\nin the previous instances, Wolf Larsen was compelled to resort to a\ndifferent man\u00c5\u0093uvre.  Running off before the wind with everything to\nstarboard, he came about, and returned close-hauled on the port tack.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGrand!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Johnson shouted in my ear, as we successfully came through the\nattendant deluge, and I knew he referred, not to Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nseamanship, but to the performance of the _Ghost_ herself.\n\nIt was now so dark that there was no sign of the boat; but Wolf Larsen\nheld back through the frightful turmoil as if guided by unerring\ninstinct.  This time, though we were continually half-buried, there was\nno trough in which to be swept, and we drifted squarely down upon the\nupturned boat, badly smashing it as it was heaved inboard.\n\nTwo hours of terrible work followed, in which all hands of us\u00e2\u0080\u0094two\nhunters, three sailors, Wolf Larsen and I\u00e2\u0080\u0094reefed, first one and then the\nother, the jib and mainsail.  Hove to under this short canvas, our decks\nwere comparatively free of water, while the _Ghost_ bobbed and ducked\namongst the combers like a cork.\n\nI had burst open the ends of my fingers at the very first, and during the\nreefing I had worked with tears of pain running down my cheeks.  And when\nall was done, I gave up like a woman and rolled upon the deck in the\nagony of exhaustion.\n\nIn the meantime Thomas Mugridge, like a drowned rat, was being dragged\nout from under the forecastle head where he had cravenly ensconced\nhimself.  I saw him pulled aft to the cabin, and noted with a shock of\nsurprise that the galley had disappeared.  A clean space of deck showed\nwhere it had stood.\n\nIn the cabin I found all hands assembled, sailors as well, and while\ncoffee was being cooked over the small stove we drank whisky and crunched\nhard-tack.  Never in my life had food been so welcome.  And never had hot\ncoffee tasted so good.  So violently did the _Ghost_, pitch and toss and\ntumble that it was impossible for even the sailors to move about without\nholding on, and several times, after a cry of \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow she takes it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d we were\nheaped upon the wall of the port cabins as though it had been the deck.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo hell with a look-out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I heard Wolf Larsen say when we had eaten and\ndrunk our fill.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing can be done on deck.  If anything\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ngoing to run us down we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get out of its way.  Turn in, all hands,\nand get some sleep.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe sailors slipped forward, setting the side-lights as they went, while\nthe two hunters remained to sleep in the cabin, it not being deemed\nadvisable to open the slide to the steerage companion-way.  Wolf Larsen\nand I, between us, cut off Kerfoot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crushed finger and sewed up the\nstump.  Mugridge, who, during all the time he had been compelled to cook\nand serve coffee and keep the fire going, had complained of internal\npains, now swore that he had a broken rib or two.  On examination we\nfound that he had three.  But his case was deferred to next day,\nprincipally for the reason that I did not know anything about broken ribs\nand would first have to read it up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it was worth it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said to Wolf Larsen, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca broken boat\nfor Kelly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut Kelly didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t amount to much,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the reply.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfter all that had passed, suffering intolerable anguish in my\nfinger-ends, and with three boats missing, to say nothing of the wild\ncapers the _Ghost_ was cutting, I should have thought it impossible to\nsleep.  But my eyes must have closed the instant my head touched the\npillow, and in utter exhaustion I slept throughout the night, the while\nthe _Ghost_, lonely and undirected, fought her way through the storm.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nThe next day, while the storm was blowing itself out, Wolf Larsen and I\ncrammed anatomy and surgery and set Mugridge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ribs.  Then, when the\nstorm broke, Wolf Larsen cruised back and forth over that portion of the\nocean where we had encountered it, and somewhat more to the westward,\nwhile the boats were being repaired and new sails made and bent.  Sealing\nschooner after sealing schooner we sighted and boarded, most of which\nwere in search of lost boats, and most of which were carrying boats and\ncrews they had picked up and which did not belong to them.  For the thick\nof the fleet had been to the westward of us, and the boats, scattered far\nand wide, had headed in mad flight for the nearest refuge.\n\nTwo of our boats, with men all safe, we took off the _Cisco_, and, to\nWolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s huge delight and my own grief, he culled Smoke, with Nilson\nand Leach, from the _San Diego_.  So that, at the end of five days, we\nfound ourselves short but four men\u00e2\u0080\u0094Henderson, Holyoak, Williams, and\nKelly,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and were once more hunting on the flanks of the herd.\n\nAs we followed it north we began to encounter the dreaded sea-fogs.  Day\nafter day the boats lowered and were swallowed up almost ere they touched\nthe water, while we on board pumped the horn at regular intervals and\nevery fifteen minutes fired the bomb gun.  Boats were continually being\nlost and found, it being the custom for a boat to hunt, on lay, with\nwhatever schooner picked it up, until such time it was recovered by its\nown schooner.  But Wolf Larsen, as was to be expected, being a boat\nshort, took possession of the first stray one and compelled its men to\nhunt with the _Ghost_, not permitting them to return to their own\nschooner when we sighted it.  I remember how he forced the hunter and his\ntwo men below, a rifle at their breasts, when their captain passed by at\nbiscuit-toss and hailed us for information.\n\nThomas Mugridge, so strangely and pertinaciously clinging to life, was\nsoon limping about again and performing his double duties of cook and\ncabin-boy.  Johnson and Leach were bullied and beaten as much as ever,\nand they looked for their lives to end with the end of the hunting\nseason; while the rest of the crew lived the lives of dogs and were\nworked like dogs by their pitiless master.  As for Wolf Larsen and\nmyself, we got along fairly well; though I could not quite rid myself of\nthe idea that right conduct, for me, lay in killing him.  He fascinated\nme immeasurably, and I feared him immeasurably.  And yet, I could not\nimagine him lying prone in death.  There was an endurance, as of\nperpetual youth, about him, which rose up and forbade the picture.  I\ncould see him only as living always, and dominating always, fighting and\ndestroying, himself surviving.\n\nOne diversion of his, when we were in the midst of the herd and the sea\nwas too rough to lower the boats, was to lower with two boat-pullers and\na steerer and go out himself.  He was a good shot, too, and brought many\na skin aboard under what the hunters termed impossible hunting\nconditions.  It seemed the breath of his nostrils, this carrying his life\nin his hands and struggling for it against tremendous odds.\n\nI was learning more and more seamanship; and one clear day\u00e2\u0080\u0094a thing we\nrarely encountered now\u00e2\u0080\u0094I had the satisfaction of running and handling the\n_Ghost_ and picking up the boats myself.  Wolf Larsen had been smitten\nwith one of his headaches, and I stood at the wheel from morning until\nevening, sailing across the ocean after the last lee boat, and heaving to\nand picking it and the other five up without command or suggestion from\nhim.\n\nGales we encountered now and again, for it was a raw and stormy region,\nand, in the middle of June, a typhoon most memorable to me and most\nimportant because of the changes wrought through it upon my future.  We\nmust have been caught nearly at the centre of this circular storm, and\nWolf Larsen ran out of it and to the southward, first under a\ndouble-reefed jib, and finally under bare poles.  Never had I imagined so\ngreat a sea.  The seas previously encountered were as ripples compared\nwith these, which ran a half-mile from crest to crest and which upreared,\nI am confident, above our masthead.  So great was it that Wolf Larsen\nhimself did not dare heave to, though he was being driven far to the\nsouthward and out of the seal herd.\n\nWe must have been well in the path of the trans-Pacific steamships when\nthe typhoon moderated, and here, to the surprise of the hunters, we found\nourselves in the midst of seals\u00e2\u0080\u0094a second herd, or sort of rear-guard,\nthey declared, and a most unusual thing.  But it was \u00e2\u0080\u009cBoats over!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the\nboom-boom of guns, and the pitiful slaughter through the long day.\n\nIt was at this time that I was approached by Leach.  I had just finished\ntallying the skins of the last boat aboard, when he came to my side, in\nthe darkness, and said in a low tone:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan you tell me, Mr. Van Weyden, how far we are off the coast, and what\nthe bearings of Yokohama are?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMy heart leaped with gladness, for I knew what he had in mind, and I gave\nhim the bearings\u00e2\u0080\u0094west-north-west, and five hundred miles away.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was all he said as he slipped back into the darkness.\n\nNext morning No. 3 boat and Johnson and Leach were missing.  The\nwater-breakers and grub-boxes from all the other boats were likewise\nmissing, as were the beds and sea bags of the two men.  Wolf Larsen was\nfurious.  He set sail and bore away into the west-north-west, two hunters\nconstantly at the mastheads and sweeping the sea with glasses, himself\npacing the deck like an angry lion.  He knew too well my sympathy for the\nrunaways to send me aloft as look-out.\n\nThe wind was fair but fitful, and it was like looking for a needle in a\nhaystack to raise that tiny boat out of the blue immensity.  But he put\nthe _Ghost_ through her best paces so as to get between the deserters and\nthe land.  This accomplished, he cruised back and forth across what he\nknew must be their course.\n\nOn the morning of the third day, shortly after eight bells, a cry that\nthe boat was sighted came down from Smoke at the masthead.  All hands\nlined the rail.  A snappy breeze was blowing from the west with the\npromise of more wind behind it; and there, to leeward, in the troubled\nsilver of the rising sun, appeared and disappeared a black speck.\n\nWe squared away and ran for it.  My heart was as lead.  I felt myself\nturning sick in anticipation; and as I looked at the gleam of triumph in\nWolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes, his form swam before me, and I felt almost\nirresistibly impelled to fling myself upon him.  So unnerved was I by the\nthought of impending violence to Leach and Johnson that my reason must\nhave left me.  I know that I slipped down into the steerage in a daze,\nand that I was just beginning the ascent to the deck, a loaded shot-gun\nin my hands, when I heard the startled cry:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s five men in that boat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI supported myself in the companion-way, weak and trembling, while the\nobservation was being verified by the remarks of the rest of the men.\nThen my knees gave from under me and I sank down, myself again, but\novercome by shock at knowledge of what I had so nearly done.  Also, I was\nvery thankful as I put the gun away and slipped back on deck.\n\nNo one had remarked my absence.  The boat was near enough for us to make\nout that it was larger than any sealing boat and built on different\nlines.  As we drew closer, the sail was taken in and the mast unstepped.\nOars were shipped, and its occupants waited for us to heave to and take\nthem aboard.\n\nSmoke, who had descended to the deck and was now standing by my side,\nbegan to chuckle in a significant way.  I looked at him inquiringly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTalk of a mess!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he giggled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I demanded.\n\nAgain he chuckled.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see there, in the stern-sheets, on the\nbottom?  May I never shoot a seal again if that ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a woman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI looked closely, but was not sure until exclamations broke out on all\nsides.  The boat contained four men, and its fifth occupant was certainly\na woman.  We were agog with excitement, all except Wolf Larsen, who was\ntoo evidently disappointed in that it was not his own boat with the two\nvictims of his malice.\n\nWe ran down the flying jib, hauled the jib-sheets to wind-ward and the\nmain-sheet flat, and came up into the wind.  The oars struck the water,\nand with a few strokes the boat was alongside.  I now caught my first\nfair glimpse of the woman.  She was wrapped in a long ulster, for the\nmorning was raw; and I could see nothing but her face and a mass of light\nbrown hair escaping from under the seaman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cap on her head.  The eyes\nwere large and brown and lustrous, the mouth sweet and sensitive, and the\nface itself a delicate oval, though sun and exposure to briny wind had\nburnt the face scarlet.\n\nShe seemed to me like a being from another world.  I was aware of a\nhungry out-reaching for her, as of a starving man for bread.  But then, I\nhad not seen a woman for a very long time.  I know that I was lost in a\ngreat wonder, almost a stupor,\u00e2\u0080\u0094this, then, was a woman?\u00e2\u0080\u0094so that I forgot\nmyself and my mate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s duties, and took no part in helping the new-comers\naboard.  For when one of the sailors lifted her into Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndownstretched arms, she looked up into our curious faces and smiled\namusedly and sweetly, as only a woman can smile, and as I had seen no one\nsmile for so long that I had forgotten such smiles existed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Van Weyden!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice brought me sharply back to myself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you take the lady below and see to her comfort?  Make up that spare\nport cabin.  Put Cooky to work on it.  And see what you can do for that\nface.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s burned badly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe turned brusquely away from us and began to question the new men.  The\nboat was cast adrift, though one of them called it a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbloody shame\u00e2\u0080\u009d with\nYokohama so near.\n\nI found myself strangely afraid of this woman I was escorting aft.  Also\nI was awkward.  It seemed to me that I was realizing for the first time\nwhat a delicate, fragile creature a woman is; and as I caught her arm to\nhelp her down the companion stairs, I was startled by its smallness and\nsoftness.  Indeed, she was a slender, delicate woman as women go, but to\nme she was so ethereally slender and delicate that I was quite prepared\nfor her arm to crumble in my grasp.  All this, in frankness, to show my\nfirst impression, after long denial of women in general and of Maud\nBrewster in particular.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo need to go to any great trouble for me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she protested, when I had\nseated her in Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm-chair, which I had dragged hastily from\nhis cabin.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe men were looking for land at any moment this morning,\nand the vessel should be in by night; don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHer simple faith in the immediate future took me aback.  How could I\nexplain to her the situation, the strange man who stalked the sea like\nDestiny, all that it had taken me months to learn?  But I answered\nhonestly:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it were any other captain except ours, I should say you would be\nashore in Yokohama to-morrow.  But our captain is a strange man, and I\nbeg of you to be prepared for anything\u00e2\u0080\u0094understand?\u00e2\u0080\u0094for anything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0094I confess I hardly do understand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she hesitated, a perturbed but not\nfrightened expression in her eyes.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cOr is it a misconception of mine\nthat shipwrecked people are always shown every consideration?  This is\nsuch a little thing, you know.  We are so close to land.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCandidly, I do not know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I strove to reassure her.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wished merely to\nprepare you for the worst, if the worst is to come.  This man, this\ncaptain, is a brute, a demon, and one can never tell what will be his\nnext fantastic act.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI was growing excited, but she interrupted me with an \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\nher voice sounded weary.  To think was patently an effort.  She was\nclearly on the verge of physical collapse.\n\nShe asked no further questions, and I vouchsafed no remark, devoting\nmyself to Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s command, which was to make her comfortable.  I\nbustled about in quite housewifely fashion, procuring soothing lotions\nfor her sunburn, raiding Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s private stores for a bottle of\nport I knew to be there, and directing Thomas Mugridge in the preparation\nof the spare state-room.\n\nThe wind was freshening rapidly, the _Ghost_ heeling over more and more,\nand by the time the state-room was ready she was dashing through the\nwater at a lively clip.  I had quite forgotten the existence of Leach and\nJohnson, when suddenly, like a thunderclap, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBoat ho!\u00e2\u0080\u009d came down the open\ncompanion-way.  It was Smoke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unmistakable voice, crying from the\nmasthead.  I shot a glance at the woman, but she was leaning back in the\narm-chair, her eyes closed, unutterably tired.  I doubted that she had\nheard, and I resolved to prevent her seeing the brutality I knew would\nfollow the capture of the deserters.  She was tired.  Very good.  She\nshould sleep.\n\nThere were swift commands on deck, a stamping of feet and a slapping of\nreef-points as the _Ghost_ shot into the wind and about on the other\ntack.  As she filled away and heeled, the arm-chair began to slide across\nthe cabin floor, and I sprang for it just in time to prevent the rescued\nwoman from being spilled out.\n\nHer eyes were too heavy to suggest more than a hint of the sleepy\nsurprise that perplexed her as she looked up at me, and she half\nstumbled, half tottered, as I led her to her cabin.  Mugridge grinned\ninsinuatingly in my face as I shoved him out and ordered him back to his\ngalley work; and he won his revenge by spreading glowing reports among\nthe hunters as to what an excellent \u00e2\u0080\u009clydy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-myde\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was proving myself to\nbe.\n\nShe leaned heavily against me, and I do believe that she had fallen\nasleep again between the arm-chair and the state-room.  This I discovered\nwhen she nearly fell into the bunk during a sudden lurch of the schooner.\nShe aroused, smiled drowsily, and was off to sleep again; and asleep I\nleft her, under a heavy pair of sailor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blankets, her head resting on a\npillow I had appropriated from Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bunk.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nI came on deck to find the _Ghost_ heading up close on the port tack and\ncutting in to windward of a familiar spritsail close-hauled on the same\ntack ahead of us.  All hands were on deck, for they knew that something\nwas to happen when Leach and Johnson were dragged aboard.\n\nIt was four bells.  Louis came aft to relieve the wheel.  There was a\ndampness in the air, and I noticed he had on his oilskins.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are we going to have?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA healthy young slip of a gale from the breath iv it, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwith a splatter iv rain just to wet our gills an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 no more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cToo bad we sighted them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, as the _Ghost\u00e2\u0080\u0099s_ bow was flung off a\npoint by a large sea and the boat leaped for a moment past the jibs and\ninto our line of vision.\n\nLouis gave a spoke and temporized.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never iv made the land, sir,\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thinkin\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThink not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I queried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, sir.  Did you feel that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  (A puff had caught the schooner, and he\nwas forced to put the wheel up rapidly to keep her out of the wind.)\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis no egg-shell\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll float on this sea an hour come, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a stroke\niv luck for them we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here to pick \u00e2\u0080\u0099em up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWolf Larsen strode aft from amidships, where he had been talking with the\nrescued men.  The cat-like springiness in his tread was a little more\npronounced than usual, and his eyes were bright and snappy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThree oilers and a fourth engineer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was his greeting.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make\nsailors out of them, or boat-pullers at any rate.  Now, what of the\nlady?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI know not why, but I was aware of a twinge or pang like the cut of a\nknife when he mentioned her.  I thought it a certain silly fastidiousness\non my part, but it persisted in spite of me, and I merely shrugged my\nshoulders in answer.\n\nWolf Larsen pursed his lips in a long, quizzical whistle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s her name, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he demanded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is asleep.  She was very tired.  In\nfact, I am waiting to hear the news from you.  What vessel was it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMail steamer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered shortly.  \u00e2\u0080\u009c_The City of Tokio_, from \u00e2\u0080\u0099Frisco,\nbound for Yokohama.  Disabled in that typhoon.  Old tub.  Opened up top\nand bottom like a sieve.  They were adrift four days.  And you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know\nwho or what she is, eh?\u00e2\u0080\u0094maid, wife, or widow?  Well, well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe shook his head in a bantering way, and regarded me with laughing eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d I began.  It was on the verge of my tongue to ask if he were\ngoing to take the castaways into Yokohama.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAm I what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you intend doing with Leach and Johnson?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe shook his head.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cReally, Hump, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know.  You see, with these\nadditions I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve about all the crew I want.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve about all the escaping they want,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy not give\nthem a change of treatment?  Take them aboard, and deal gently with them.\nWhatever they have done they have been hounded into doing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered steadily.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I give you warning, Wolf Larsen,\nthat I may forget love of my own life in the desire to kill you if you go\ntoo far in maltreating those poor wretches.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBravo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou do me proud, Hump!  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found your legs with\na vengeance.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re quite an individual.  You were unfortunate in having\nyour life cast in easy places, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re developing, and I like you the\nbetter for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis voice and expression changed.  His face was serious.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you believe\nin promises?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre they sacred things?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a compact,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he went on, consummate actor.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I promise not\nto lay my hands upon Leach will you promise, in turn, not to attempt to\nkill me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, not that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid of you, not that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid of you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he hastened\nto add.\n\nI could hardly believe my ears.  What was coming over the man?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it a go?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked impatiently.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA go,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered.\n\nHis hand went out to mine, and as I shook it heartily I could have sworn\nI saw the mocking devil shine up for a moment in his eyes.\n\nWe strolled across the poop to the lee side.  The boat was close at hand\nnow, and in desperate plight.  Johnson was steering, Leach bailing.  We\noverhauled them about two feet to their one.  Wolf Larsen motioned Louis\nto keep off slightly, and we dashed abreast of the boat, not a score of\nfeet to windward.  The _Ghost_ blanketed it.  The spritsail flapped\nemptily and the boat righted to an even keel, causing the two men swiftly\nto change position.  The boat lost headway, and, as we lifted on a huge\nsurge, toppled and fell into the trough.\n\nIt was at this moment that Leach and Johnson looked up into the faces of\ntheir shipmates, who lined the rail amidships.  There was no greeting.\nThey were as dead men in their comrades\u00e2\u0080\u0099 eyes, and between them was the\ngulf that parts the living and the dead.\n\nThe next instant they were opposite the poop, where stood Wolf Larsen and\nI.  We were falling in the trough, they were rising on the surge.\nJohnson looked at me, and I could see that his face was worn and haggard.\nI waved my hand to him, and he answered the greeting, but with a wave\nthat was hopeless and despairing.  It was as if he were saying farewell.\nI did not see into the eyes of Leach, for he was looking at Wolf Larsen,\nthe old and implacable snarl of hatred strong as ever on his face.\n\nThen they were gone astern.  The spritsail filled with the wind,\nsuddenly, careening the frail open craft till it seemed it would surely\ncapsize.  A whitecap foamed above it and broke across in a snow-white\nsmother.  Then the boat emerged, half swamped, Leach flinging the water\nout and Johnson clinging to the steering-oar, his face white and anxious.\n\nWolf Larsen barked a short laugh in my ear and strode away to the weather\nside of the poop.  I expected him to give orders for the _Ghost_ to heave\nto, but she kept on her course and he made no sign.  Louis stood\nimperturbably at the wheel, but I noticed the grouped sailors forward\nturning troubled faces in our direction.  Still the _Ghost_ tore along,\ntill the boat dwindled to a speck, when Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice rang out in\ncommand and he went about on the starboard tack.\n\nBack we held, two miles and more to windward of the struggling\ncockle-shell, when the flying jib was run down and the schooner hove to.\nThe sealing boats are not made for windward work.  Their hope lies in\nkeeping a weather position so that they may run before the wind for the\nschooner when it breezes up.  But in all that wild waste there was no\nrefuge for Leach and Johnson save on the _Ghost_, and they resolutely\nbegan the windward beat.  It was slow work in the heavy sea that was\nrunning.  At any moment they were liable to be overwhelmed by the hissing\ncombers.  Time and again and countless times we watched the boat luff\ninto the big whitecaps, lose headway, and be flung back like a cork.\n\nJohnson was a splendid seaman, and he knew as much about small boats as\nhe did about ships.  At the end of an hour and a half he was nearly\nalongside, standing past our stern on the last leg out, aiming to fetch\nus on the next leg back.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve changed your mind?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I heard Wolf Larsen mutter, half to\nhimself, half to them as though they could hear.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou want to come\naboard, eh?  Well, then, just keep a-coming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHard up with that helm!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he commanded Oofty-Oofty, the Kanaka, who had\nin the meantime relieved Louis at the wheel.\n\nCommand followed command.  As the schooner paid off, the fore- and\nmain-sheets were slacked away for fair wind.  And before the wind we\nwere, and leaping, when Johnson, easing his sheet at imminent peril, cut\nacross our wake a hundred feet away.  Again Wolf Larsen laughed, at the\nsame time beckoning them with his arm to follow.  It was evidently his\nintention to play with them,\u00e2\u0080\u0094a lesson, I took it, in lieu of a beating,\nthough a dangerous lesson, for the frail craft stood in momentary danger\nof being overwhelmed.\n\nJohnson squared away promptly and ran after us.  There was nothing else\nfor him to do.  Death stalked everywhere, and it was only a matter of\ntime when some one of those many huge seas would fall upon the boat, roll\nover it, and pass on.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis the fear iv death at the hearts iv them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Louis muttered in my ear,\nas I passed forward to see to taking in the flying jib and staysail.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll heave to in a little while and pick them up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered\ncheerfully.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bent upon giving them a lesson, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLouis looked at me shrewdly.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThink so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSurely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think nothing but iv my own skin, these days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was his answer.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAn\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis with wonder I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m filled as to the workin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 out iv things.  A pretty\nmess that \u00e2\u0080\u0099Frisco whisky got me into, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a prettier mess that woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ngot you into aft there.  Ah, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s myself that knows ye for a blitherin\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nfool.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I demanded; for, having sped his shaft, he was\nturning away.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do I mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s you that asks me!  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis not what I\nmean, but what the Wolf \u00e2\u0080\u0099ll mean.  The Wolf, I said, the Wolf!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf trouble comes, will you stand by?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked impulsively, for he had\nvoiced my own fear.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStand by?  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis old fat Louis I stand by, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 trouble enough it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at the beginnin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 iv things, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m tellin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ye, the bare beginnin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 iv\nthings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI had not thought you so great a coward,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I sneered.\n\nHe favoured me with a contemptuous stare.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I raised never a hand for\nthat poor fool,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094pointing astern to the tiny sail,\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cd\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nhungerin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for a broken head for a woman I never laid me eyes upon before\nthis day?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI turned scornfully away and went aft.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBetter get in those topsails, Mr. Van Weyden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen said, as I\ncame on the poop.\n\nI felt relief, at least as far as the two men were concerned.  It was\nclear he did not wish to run too far away from them.  I picked up hope at\nthe thought and put the order swiftly into execution.  I had scarcely\nopened my mouth to issue the necessary commands, when eager men were\nspringing to halyards and downhauls, and others were racing aloft.  This\neagerness on their part was noted by Wolf Larsen with a grim smile.\n\nStill we increased our lead, and when the boat had dropped astern several\nmiles we hove to and waited.  All eyes watched it coming, even Wolf\nLarsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; but he was the only unperturbed man aboard.  Louis, gazing\nfixedly, betrayed a trouble in his face he was not quite able to hide.\n\nThe boat drew closer and closer, hurling along through the seething green\nlike a thing alive, lifting and sending and uptossing across the\nhuge-backed breakers, or disappearing behind them only to rush into sight\nagain and shoot skyward.  It seemed impossible that it could continue to\nlive, yet with each dizzying sweep it did achieve the impossible.  A\nrain-squall drove past, and out of the flying wet the boat emerged,\nalmost upon us.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHard up, there!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen shouted, himself springing to the wheel and\nwhirling it over.\n\nAgain the _Ghost_ sprang away and raced before the wind, and for two\nhours Johnson and Leach pursued us.  We hove to and ran away, hove to and\nran away, and ever astern the struggling patch of sail tossed skyward and\nfell into the rushing valleys.  It was a quarter of a mile away when a\nthick squall of rain veiled it from view.  It never emerged.  The wind\nblew the air clear again, but no patch of sail broke the troubled\nsurface.  I thought I saw, for an instant, the boat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bottom show black\nin a breaking crest.  At the best, that was all.  For Johnson and Leach\nthe travail of existence had ceased.\n\nThe men remained grouped amidships.  No one had gone below, and no one\nwas speaking.  Nor were any looks being exchanged.  Each man seemed\nstunned\u00e2\u0080\u0094deeply contemplative, as it were, and, not quite sure, trying to\nrealize just what had taken place.  Wolf Larsen gave them little time for\nthought.  He at once put the _Ghost_ upon her course\u00e2\u0080\u0094a course which meant\nthe seal herd and not Yokohama harbour.  But the men were no longer eager\nas they pulled and hauled, and I heard curses amongst them, which left\ntheir lips smothered and as heavy and lifeless as were they.  Not so was\nit with the hunters.  Smoke the irrepressible related a story, and they\ndescended into the steerage, bellowing with laughter.\n\nAs I passed to leeward of the galley on my way aft I was approached by\nthe engineer we had rescued.  His face was white, his lips were\ntrembling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood God! sir, what kind of a craft is this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have eyes, you have seen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered, almost brutally, what of the\npain and fear at my own heart.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour promise?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said to Wolf Larsen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was not thinking of taking them aboard when I made that promise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nanswered.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd anyway, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll agree I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve not laid my hands upon them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFar from it, far from it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he laughed a moment later.\n\nI made no reply.  I was incapable of speaking, my mind was too confused.\nI must have time to think, I knew.  This woman, sleeping even now in the\nspare cabin, was a responsibility, which I must consider, and the only\nrational thought that flickered through my mind was that I must do\nnothing hastily if I were to be any help to her at all.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nThe remainder of the day passed uneventfully.  The young slip of a gale,\nhaving wetted our gills, proceeded to moderate.  The fourth engineer and\nthe three oilers, after a warm interview with Wolf Larsen, were furnished\nwith outfits from the slop-chests, assigned places under the hunters in\nthe various boats and watches on the vessel, and bundled forward into the\nforecastle.  They went protestingly, but their voices were not loud.\nThey were awed by what they had already seen of Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character,\nwhile the tale of woe they speedily heard in the forecastle took the last\nbit of rebellion out of them.\n\nMiss Brewster\u00e2\u0080\u0094we had learned her name from the engineer\u00e2\u0080\u0094slept on and on.\nAt supper I requested the hunters to lower their voices, so she was not\ndisturbed; and it was not till next morning that she made her appearance.\nIt had been my intention to have her meals served apart, but Wolf Larsen\nput down his foot.  Who was she that she should be too good for cabin\ntable and cabin society? had been his demand.\n\nBut her coming to the table had something amusing in it.  The hunters\nfell silent as clams.  Jock Horner and Smoke alone were unabashed,\nstealing stealthy glances at her now and again, and even taking part in\nthe conversation.  The other four men glued their eyes on their plates\nand chewed steadily and with thoughtful precision, their ears moving and\nwobbling, in time with their jaws, like the ears of so many animals.\n\nWolf Larsen had little to say at first, doing no more than reply when he\nwas addressed.  Not that he was abashed.  Far from it.  This woman was a\nnew type to him, a different breed from any he had ever known, and he was\ncurious.  He studied her, his eyes rarely leaving her face unless to\nfollow the movements of her hands or shoulders.  I studied her myself,\nand though it was I who maintained the conversation, I know that I was a\nbit shy, not quite self-possessed.  His was the perfect poise, the\nsupreme confidence in self, which nothing could shake; and he was no more\ntimid of a woman than he was of storm and battle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd when shall we arrive at Yokohama?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked, turning to him and\nlooking him squarely in the eyes.\n\nThere it was, the question flat.  The jaws stopped working, the ears\nceased wobbling, and though eyes remained glued on plates, each man\nlistened greedily for the answer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn four months, possibly three if the season closes early,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen\nsaid.\n\nShe caught her breath and stammered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0094I thought\u00e2\u0080\u0094I was given to\nunderstand that Yokohama was only a day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sail away.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Here she\npaused and looked about the table at the circle of unsympathetic faces\nstaring hard at the plates.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she concluded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is a question you must settle with Mr. Van Weyden there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nreplied, nodding to me with a mischievous twinkle.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Van Weyden is\nwhat you may call an authority on such things as rights.  Now I, who am\nonly a sailor, would look upon the situation somewhat differently.  It\nmay possibly be your misfortune that you have to remain with us, but it\nis certainly our good fortune.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe regarded her smilingly.  Her eyes fell before his gaze, but she lifted\nthem again, and defiantly, to mine.  I read the unspoken question there:\nwas it right?  But I had decided that the part I was to play must be a\nneutral one, so I did not answer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you think?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she demanded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat it is unfortunate, especially if you have any engagements falling\ndue in the course of the next several months.  But, since you say that\nyou were voyaging to Japan for your health, I can assure you that it will\nimprove no better anywhere than aboard the _Ghost_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI saw her eyes flash with indignation, and this time it was I who dropped\nmine, while I felt my face flushing under her gaze.  It was cowardly, but\nwhat else could I do?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Van Weyden speaks with the voice of authority,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen laughed.\n\nI nodded my head, and she, having recovered herself, waited expectantly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot that he is much to speak of now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen went on, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut he has\nimproved wonderfully.  You should have seen him when he came on board.  A\nmore scrawny, pitiful specimen of humanity one could hardly conceive.\nIsn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that so, Kerfoot?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nKerfoot, thus directly addressed, was startled into dropping his knife on\nthe floor, though he managed to grunt affirmation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDeveloped himself by peeling potatoes and washing dishes.  Eh, Kerfoot?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgain that worthy grunted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook at him now.  True, he is not what you would term muscular, but\nstill he has muscles, which is more than he had when he came aboard.\nAlso, he has legs to stand on.  You would not think so to look at him,\nbut he was quite unable to stand alone at first.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe hunters were snickering, but she looked at me with a sympathy in her\neyes which more than compensated for Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nastiness.  In truth,\nit had been so long since I had received sympathy that I was softened,\nand I became then, and gladly, her willing slave.  But I was angry with\nWolf Larsen.  He was challenging my manhood with his slurs, challenging\nthe very legs he claimed to be instrumental in getting for me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI may have learned to stand on my own legs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I retorted.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I have\nyet to stamp upon others with them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe looked at me insolently.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour education is only half completed,\nthen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said dryly, and turned to her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are very hospitable upon the _Ghost_.  Mr. Van Weyden has discovered\nthat.  We do everything to make our guests feel at home, eh, Mr. Van\nWeyden?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven to the peeling of potatoes and the washing of dishes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cto say nothing to wringing their necks out of very fellowship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI beg of you not to receive false impressions of us from Mr. Van\nWeyden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he interposed with mock anxiety.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will observe, Miss\nBrewster, that he carries a dirk in his belt, a\u00e2\u0080\u0094ahem\u00e2\u0080\u0094a most unusual thing\nfor a ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s officer to do.  While really very estimable, Mr. Van Weyden\nis sometimes\u00e2\u0080\u0094how shall I say?\u00e2\u0080\u0094er\u00e2\u0080\u0094quarrelsome, and harsh measures are\nnecessary.  He is quite reasonable and fair in his calm moments, and as\nhe is calm now he will not deny that only yesterday he threatened my\nlife.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI was well-nigh choking, and my eyes were certainly fiery.  He drew\nattention to me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook at him now.  He can scarcely control himself in your presence.  He\nis not accustomed to the presence of ladies anyway.  I shall have to arm\nmyself before I dare go on deck with him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe shook his head sadly, murmuring, \u00e2\u0080\u009cToo bad, too bad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d while the hunters\nburst into guffaws of laughter.\n\nThe deep-sea voices of these men, rumbling and bellowing in the confined\nspace, produced a wild effect.  The whole setting was wild, and for the\nfirst time, regarding this strange woman and realizing how incongruous\nshe was in it, I was aware of how much a part of it I was myself.  I knew\nthese men and their mental processes, was one of them myself, living the\nseal-hunting life, eating the seal-hunting fare, thinking, largely, the\nseal-hunting thoughts.  There was for me no strangeness to it, to the\nrough clothes, the coarse faces, the wild laughter, and the lurching\ncabin walls and swaying sea-lamps.\n\nAs I buttered a piece of bread my eyes chanced to rest upon my hand.  The\nknuckles were skinned and inflamed clear across, the fingers swollen, the\nnails rimmed with black.  I felt the mattress-like growth of beard on my\nneck, knew that the sleeve of my coat was ripped, that a button was\nmissing from the throat of the blue shirt I wore.  The dirk mentioned by\nWolf Larsen rested in its sheath on my hip.  It was very natural that it\nshould be there,\u00e2\u0080\u0094how natural I had not imagined until now, when I looked\nupon it with her eyes and knew how strange it and all that went with it\nmust appear to her.\n\nBut she divined the mockery in Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words, and again favoured me\nwith a sympathetic glance.  But there was a look of bewilderment also in\nher eyes.  That it was mockery made the situation more puzzling to her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI may be taken off by some passing vessel, perhaps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she suggested.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere will be no passing vessels, except other sealing-schooners,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf\nLarsen made answer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no clothes, nothing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she objected.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou hardly realize, sir,\nthat I am not a man, or that I am unaccustomed to the vagrant, careless\nlife which you and your men seem to lead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe sooner you get accustomed to it, the better,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll furnish you with cloth, needles, and thread,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope it\nwill not be too dreadful a hardship for you to make yourself a dress or\ntwo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe made a wry pucker with her mouth, as though to advertise her\nignorance of dressmaking.  That she was frightened and bewildered, and\nthat she was bravely striving to hide it, was quite plain to me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re like Mr. Van Weyden there, accustomed to having things\ndone for you.  Well, I think doing a few things for yourself will hardly\ndislocate any joints.  By the way, what do you do for a living?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe regarded him with amazement unconcealed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean no offence, believe me.  People eat, therefore they must procure\nthe wherewithal.  These men here shoot seals in order to live; for the\nsame reason I sail this schooner; and Mr. Van Weyden, for the present at\nany rate, earns his salty grub by assisting me.  Now what do you do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you feed yourself?  Or does some one else feed you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid some one else has fed me most of my life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she laughed,\ntrying bravely to enter into the spirit of his quizzing, though I could\nsee a terror dawning and growing in her eyes as she watched Wolf Larsen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I suppose some one else makes your bed for you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI _have_ made beds,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery often?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe shook her head with mock ruefulness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know what they do to poor men in the States, who, like you, do\nnot work for their living?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am very ignorant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she pleaded.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do they do to the poor men who\nare like me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey send them to jail.  The crime of not earning a living, in their\ncase, is called vagrancy.  If I were Mr. Van Weyden, who harps eternally\non questions of right and wrong, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d ask, by what right do you live when\nyou do nothing to deserve living?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut as you are not Mr. Van Weyden, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to answer, do I?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe beamed upon him through her terror-filled eyes, and the pathos of it\ncut me to the heart.  I must in some way break in and lead the\nconversation into other channels.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you ever earned a dollar by your own labour?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he demanded, certain\nof her answer, a triumphant vindictiveness in his voice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I have,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered slowly, and I could have laughed aloud at his\ncrestfallen visage.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI remember my father giving me a dollar once, when\nI was a little girl, for remaining absolutely quiet for five minutes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe smiled indulgently.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut that was long ago,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you would scarcely demand a\nlittle girl of nine to earn her own living.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt present, however,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, after another slight pause, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI earn\nabout eighteen hundred dollars a year.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith one accord, all eyes left the plates and settled on her.  A woman\nwho earned eighteen hundred dollars a year was worth looking at.  Wolf\nLarsen was undisguised in his admiration.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSalary, or piece-work?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPiece-work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered promptly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEighteen hundred,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he calculated.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a hundred and fifty dollars a\nmonth.  Well, Miss Brewster, there is nothing small about the _Ghost_.\nConsider yourself on salary during the time you remain with us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe made no acknowledgment.  She was too unused as yet to the whims of\nthe man to accept them with equanimity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI forgot to inquire,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he went on suavely, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas to the nature of your\noccupation.  What commodities do you turn out?  What tools and materials\ndo you require?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPaper and ink,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she laughed.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd, oh! also a typewriter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are Maud Brewster,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said slowly and with certainty, almost as\nthough I were charging her with a crime.\n\nHer eyes lifted curiously to mine.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you know?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I demanded.\n\nShe acknowledged her identity with a nod.  It was Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turn to\nbe puzzled.  The name and its magic signified nothing to him.  I was\nproud that it did mean something to me, and for the first time in a weary\nwhile I was convincingly conscious of a superiority over him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI remember writing a review of a thin little volume\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d I had begun\ncarelessly, when she interrupted me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was now staring at me in wide-eyed wonder.\n\nI nodded my identity, in turn.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHumphrey Van Weyden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she concluded; then added with a sigh of relief,\nand unaware that she had glanced that relief at Wolf Larsen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am so\nglad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI remember the review,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she went on hastily, becoming aware of the\nawkwardness of her remark; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat too, too flattering review.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot at all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I denied valiantly.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou impeach my sober judgment and\nmake my canons of little worth.  Besides, all my brother critics were\nwith me.  Didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Lang include your \u00e2\u0080\u0098Kiss Endured\u00e2\u0080\u0099 among the four supreme\nsonnets by women in the English language?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you called me the American Mrs. Meynell!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWas it not true?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I demanded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, not that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was hurt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can measure the unknown only by the known,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied, in my finest\nacademic manner.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a critic I was compelled to place you.  You have\nnow become a yardstick yourself.  Seven of your thin little volumes are\non my shelves; and there are two thicker volumes, the essays, which, you\nwill pardon my saying, and I know not which is flattered more, fully\nequal your verse.  The time is not far distant when some unknown will\narise in England and the critics will name her the English Maud\nBrewster.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are very kind, I am sure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she murmured; and the very\nconventionality of her tones and words, with the host of associations it\naroused of the old life on the other side of the world, gave me a quick\nthrill\u00e2\u0080\u0094rich with remembrance but stinging sharp with home-sickness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you are Maud Brewster,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said solemnly, gazing across at her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you are Humphrey Van Weyden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, gazing back at me with equal\nsolemnity and awe.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow unusual!  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand.  We surely are not\nto expect some wildly romantic sea-story from your sober pen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I am not gathering material, I assure you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was my answer.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have\nneither aptitude nor inclination for fiction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell me, why have you always buried yourself in California?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she next\nasked.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt has not been kind of you.  We of the East have seen to very\nlittle of you\u00e2\u0080\u0094too little, indeed, of the Dean of American Letters, the\nSecond.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI bowed to, and disclaimed, the compliment.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI nearly met you, once, in\nPhiladelphia, some Browning affair or other\u00e2\u0080\u0094you were to lecture, you\nknow.  My train was four hours late.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then we quite forgot where we were, leaving Wolf Larsen stranded and\nsilent in the midst of our flood of gossip.  The hunters left the table\nand went on deck, and still we talked.  Wolf Larsen alone remained.\nSuddenly I became aware of him, leaning back from the table and listening\ncuriously to our alien speech of a world he did not know.\n\nI broke short off in the middle of a sentence.  The present, with all its\nperils and anxieties, rushed upon me with stunning force.  It smote Miss\nBrewster likewise, a vague and nameless terror rushing into her eyes as\nshe regarded Wolf Larsen.\n\nHe rose to his feet and laughed awkwardly.  The sound of it was metallic.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, with a self-depreciatory wave of his hand.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t count.  Go on, go on, I pray you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut the gates of speech were closed, and we, too, rose from the table and\nlaughed awkwardly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nThe chagrin Wolf Larsen felt from being ignored by Maud Brewster and me\nin the conversation at table had to express itself in some fashion, and\nit fell to Thomas Mugridge to be the victim.  He had not mended his ways\nnor his shirt, though the latter he contended he had changed.  The\ngarment itself did not bear out the assertion, nor did the accumulations\nof grease on stove and pot and pan attest a general cleanliness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve given you warning, Cooky,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand now you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to\ntake your medicine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMugridge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face turned white under its sooty veneer, and when Wolf Larsen\ncalled for a rope and a couple of men, the miserable Cockney fled wildly\nout of the galley and dodged and ducked about the deck with the grinning\ncrew in pursuit.  Few things could have been more to their liking than to\ngive him a tow over the side, for to the forecastle he had sent messes\nand concoctions of the vilest order.  Conditions favoured the\nundertaking.  The _Ghost_ was slipping through the water at no more than\nthree miles an hour, and the sea was fairly calm.  But Mugridge had\nlittle stomach for a dip in it.  Possibly he had seen men towed before.\nBesides, the water was frightfully cold, and his was anything but a\nrugged constitution.\n\nAs usual, the watches below and the hunters turned out for what promised\nsport.  Mugridge seemed to be in rabid fear of the water, and he\nexhibited a nimbleness and speed we did not dream he possessed.  Cornered\nin the right-angle of the poop and galley, he sprang like a cat to the\ntop of the cabin and ran aft.  But his pursuers forestalling him, he\ndoubled back across the cabin, passed over the galley, and gained the\ndeck by means of the steerage-scuttle.  Straight forward he raced, the\nboat-puller Harrison at his heels and gaining on him.  But Mugridge,\nleaping suddenly, caught the jib-boom-lift.  It happened in an instant.\nHolding his weight by his arms, and in mid-air doubling his body at the\nhips, he let fly with both feet.  The oncoming Harrison caught the kick\nsquarely in the pit of the stomach, groaned involuntarily, and doubled up\nand sank backward to the deck.\n\nHand-clapping and roars of laughter from the hunters greeted the exploit,\nwhile Mugridge, eluding half of his pursuers at the foremast, ran aft and\nthrough the remainder like a runner on the football field.  Straight aft\nhe held, to the poop and along the poop to the stern.  So great was his\nspeed that as he curved past the corner of the cabin he slipped and fell.\nNilson was standing at the wheel, and the Cockney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hurtling body struck\nhis legs.  Both went down together, but Mugridge alone arose.  By some\nfreak of pressures, his frail body had snapped the strong man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leg like\na pipe-stem.\n\nParsons took the wheel, and the pursuit continued.  Round and round the\ndecks they went, Mugridge sick with fear, the sailors hallooing and\nshouting directions to one another, and the hunters bellowing\nencouragement and laughter.  Mugridge went down on the fore-hatch under\nthree men; but he emerged from the mass like an eel, bleeding at the\nmouth, the offending shirt ripped into tatters, and sprang for the\nmain-rigging.  Up he went, clear up, beyond the ratlines, to the very\nmasthead.\n\nHalf-a-dozen sailors swarmed to the crosstrees after him, where they\nclustered and waited while two of their number, Oofty-Oofty and Black\n(who was Latimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boat-steerer), continued up the thin steel stays,\nlifting their bodies higher and higher by means of their arms.\n\nIt was a perilous undertaking, for, at a height of over a hundred feet\nfrom the deck, holding on by their hands, they were not in the best of\npositions to protect themselves from Mugridge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet.  And Mugridge\nkicked savagely, till the Kanaka, hanging on with one hand, seized the\nCockney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foot with the other.  Black duplicated the performance a moment\nlater with the other foot.  Then the three writhed together in a swaying\ntangle, struggling, sliding, and falling into the arms of their mates on\nthe crosstrees.\n\nThe a\u00c3\u00abrial battle was over, and Thomas Mugridge, whining and gibbering,\nhis mouth flecked with bloody foam, was brought down to deck.  Wolf\nLarsen rove a bowline in a piece of rope and slipped it under his\nshoulders.  Then he was carried aft and flung into the sea.\nForty,\u00e2\u0080\u0094fifty,\u00e2\u0080\u0094sixty feet of line ran out, when Wolf Larsen cried \u00e2\u0080\u009cBelay!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nOofty-Oofty took a turn on a bitt, the rope tautened, and the _Ghost_,\nlunging onward, jerked the cook to the surface.\n\nIt was a pitiful spectacle.  Though he could not drown, and was\nnine-lived in addition, he was suffering all the agonies of\nhalf-drowning.  The _Ghost_ was going very slowly, and when her stern\nlifted on a wave and she slipped forward she pulled the wretch to the\nsurface and gave him a moment in which to breathe; but between each lift\nthe stern fell, and while the bow lazily climbed the next wave the line\nslacked and he sank beneath.\n\nI had forgotten the existence of Maud Brewster, and I remembered her with\na start as she stepped lightly beside me.  It was her first time on deck\nsince she had come aboard.  A dead silence greeted her appearance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is the cause of the merriment?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAsk Captain Larsen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered composedly and coldly, though inwardly\nmy blood was boiling at the thought that she should be witness to such\nbrutality.\n\nShe took my advice and was turning to put it into execution, when her\neyes lighted on Oofty-Oofty, immediately before her, his body instinct\nwith alertness and grace as he held the turn of the rope.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you fishing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked him.\n\nHe made no reply.  His eyes, fixed intently on the sea astern, suddenly\nflashed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShark ho, sir!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeave in!  Lively!  All hands tail on!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen shouted, springing\nhimself to the rope in advance of the quickest.\n\nMugridge had heard the Kanaka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s warning cry and was screaming madly.  I\ncould see a black fin cutting the water and making for him with greater\nswiftness than he was being pulled aboard.  It was an even toss whether\nthe shark or we would get him, and it was a matter of moments.  When\nMugridge was directly beneath us, the stern descended the slope of a\npassing wave, thus giving the advantage to the shark.  The fin\ndisappeared.  The belly flashed white in swift upward rush.  Almost\nequally swift, but not quite, was Wolf Larsen.  He threw his strength\ninto one tremendous jerk.  The Cockney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body left the water; so did part\nof the shark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  He drew up his legs, and the man-eater seemed no more\nthan barely to touch one foot, sinking back into the water with a splash.\nBut at the moment of contact Thomas Mugridge cried out.  Then he came in\nlike a fresh-caught fish on a line, clearing the rail generously and\nstriking the deck in a heap, on hands and knees, and rolling over.\n\nBut a fountain of blood was gushing forth.  The right foot was missing,\namputated neatly at the ankle.  I looked instantly to Maud Brewster.  Her\nface was white, her eyes dilated with horror.  She was gazing, not at\nThomas Mugridge, but at Wolf Larsen.  And he was aware of it, for he\nsaid, with one of his short laughs:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMan-play, Miss Brewster.  Somewhat rougher, I warrant, than what you\nhave been used to, but still-man-play.  The shark was not in the\nreckoning.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut at this juncture, Mugridge, who had lifted his head and ascertained\nthe extent of his loss, floundered over on the deck and buried his teeth\nin Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leg.  Wolf Larsen stooped, coolly, to the Cockney, and\npressed with thumb and finger at the rear of the jaws and below the ears.\nThe jaws opened with reluctance, and Wolf Larsen stepped free.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs I was saying,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he went on, as though nothing unwonted had happened,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe shark was not in the reckoning.  It was\u00e2\u0080\u0094ahem\u00e2\u0080\u0094shall we say\nProvidence?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe gave no sign that she had heard, though the expression of her eyes\nchanged to one of inexpressible loathing as she started to turn away.\nShe no more than started, for she swayed and tottered, and reached her\nhand weakly out to mine.  I caught her in time to save her from falling,\nand helped her to a seat on the cabin.  I thought she might faint\noutright, but she controlled herself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you get a tourniquet, Mr. Van Weyden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen called to me.\n\nI hesitated.  Her lips moved, and though they formed no words, she\ncommanded me with her eyes, plainly as speech, to go to the help of the\nunfortunate man.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she managed to whisper, and I could but obey.\n\nBy now I had developed such skill at surgery that Wolf Larsen, with a few\nwords of advice, left me to my task with a couple of sailors for\nassistants.  For his task he elected a vengeance on the shark.  A heavy\nswivel-hook, baited with fat salt-pork, was dropped overside; and by the\ntime I had compressed the severed veins and arteries, the sailors were\nsinging and heaving in the offending monster.  I did not see it myself,\nbut my assistants, first one and then the other, deserted me for a few\nmoments to run amidships and look at what was going on.  The shark, a\nsixteen-footer, was hoisted up against the main-rigging.  Its jaws were\npried apart to their greatest extension, and a stout stake, sharpened at\nboth ends, was so inserted that when the pries were removed the spread\njaws were fixed upon it.  This accomplished, the hook was cut out.  The\nshark dropped back into the sea, helpless, yet with its full strength,\ndoomed\u00e2\u0080\u0094to lingering starvation\u00e2\u0080\u0094a living death less meet for it than for\nthe man who devised the punishment.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\nI knew what it was as she came toward me.  For ten minutes I had watched\nher talking earnestly with the engineer, and now, with a sign for\nsilence, I drew her out of earshot of the helmsman.  Her face was white\nand set; her large eyes, larger than usual what of the purpose in them,\nlooked penetratingly into mine.  I felt rather timid and apprehensive,\nfor she had come to search Humphrey Van Weyden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soul, and Humphrey Van\nWeyden had nothing of which to be particularly proud since his advent on\nthe _Ghost_.\n\nWe walked to the break of the poop, where she turned and faced me.  I\nglanced around to see that no one was within hearing distance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked gently; but the expression of determination on her\nface did not relax.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can readily understand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she began, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat this morning\u00e2\u0080\u0099s affair was\nlargely an accident; but I have been talking with Mr. Haskins.  He tells\nme that the day we were rescued, even while I was in the cabin, two men\nwere drowned, deliberately drowned\u00e2\u0080\u0094murdered.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was a query in her voice, and she faced me accusingly, as though I\nwere guilty of the deed, or at least a party to it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe information is quite correct,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe two men were\nmurdered.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you permitted it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was unable to prevent it, is a better way of phrasing it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied,\nstill gently.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you tried to prevent it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  There was an emphasis on the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctried,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\na pleading little note in her voice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, but you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she hurried on, divining my answer.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut why\ndidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI shrugged my shoulders.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must remember, Miss Brewster, that you are\na new inhabitant of this little world, and that you do not yet understand\nthe laws which operate within it.  You bring with you certain fine\nconceptions of humanity, manhood, conduct, and such things; but here you\nwill find them misconceptions.  I have found it so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I added, with an\ninvoluntary sigh.\n\nShe shook her head incredulously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat would you advise, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat I should take a knife, or\na gun, or an axe, and kill this man?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe half started back.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, not that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen what should I do?  Kill myself?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou speak in purely materialistic terms,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she objected.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is such\na thing as moral courage, and moral courage is never without effect.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I smiled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou advise me to kill neither him nor myself, but to let\nhim kill me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  I held up my hand as she was about to speak.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor moral\ncourage is a worthless asset on this little floating world.  Leach, one\nof the men who were murdered, had moral courage to an unusual degree.  So\nhad the other man, Johnson.  Not only did it not stand them in good\nstead, but it destroyed them.  And so with me if I should exercise what\nlittle moral courage I may possess.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must understand, Miss Brewster, and understand clearly, that this\nman is a monster.  He is without conscience.  Nothing is sacred to him,\nnothing is too terrible for him to do.  It was due to his whim that I was\ndetained aboard in the first place.  It is due to his whim that I am\nstill alive.  I do nothing, can do nothing, because I am a slave to this\nmonster, as you are now a slave to him; because I desire to live, as you\nwill desire to live; because I cannot fight and overcome him, just as you\nwill not be able to fight and overcome him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe waited for me to go on.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat remains?  Mine is the role of the weak.  I remain silent and suffer\nignominy, as you will remain silent and suffer ignominy.  And it is well.\nIt is the best we can do if we wish to live.  The battle is not always to\nthe strong.  We have not the strength with which to fight this man; we\nmust dissimulate, and win, if win we can, by craft.  If you will be\nadvised by me, this is what you will do.  I know my position is perilous,\nand I may say frankly that yours is even more perilous.  We must stand\ntogether, without appearing to do so, in secret alliance.  I shall not be\nable to side with you openly, and, no matter what indignities may be put\nupon me, you are to remain likewise silent.  We must provoke no scenes\nwith this man, nor cross his will.  And we must keep smiling faces and be\nfriendly with him no matter how repulsive it may be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe brushed her hand across her forehead in a puzzled way, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cStill\nI do not understand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must do as I say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I interrupted authoritatively, for I saw Wolf\nLarsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gaze wandering toward us from where he paced up and down with\nLatimer amidships.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo as I say, and ere long you will find I am right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat shall I do, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked, detecting the anxious glance I had\nshot at the object of our conversation, and impressed, I flatter myself,\nwith the earnestness of my manner.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDispense with all the moral courage you can,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said briskly.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\narouse this man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s animosity.  Be quite friendly with him, talk with him,\ndiscuss literature and art with him\u00e2\u0080\u0094he is fond of such things.  You will\nfind him an interested listener and no fool.  And for your own sake try\nto avoid witnessing, as much as you can, the brutalities of the ship.  It\nwill make it easier for you to act your part.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am to lie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said in steady, rebellious tones, \u00e2\u0080\u009cby speech and\naction to lie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWolf Larsen had separated from Latimer and was coming toward us.  I was\ndesperate.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease, please understand me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said hurriedly, lowering my voice.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll your experience of men and things is worthless here.  You must begin\nover again.  I know,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I can see it\u00e2\u0080\u0094you have, among other ways, been used\nto managing people with your eyes, letting your moral courage speak out\nthrough them, as it were.  You have already managed me with your eyes,\ncommanded me with them.  But don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try it on Wolf Larsen.  You could as\neasily control a lion, while he would make a mock of you.  He would\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\nhave always been proud of the fact that I discovered him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said,\nturning the conversation as Wolf Larsen stepped on the poop and joined\nus.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe editors were afraid of him and the publishers would have none\nof him.  But I knew, and his genius and my judgment were vindicated when\nhe made that magnificent hit with his \u00e2\u0080\u0098Forge.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd it was a newspaper poem,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said glibly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt did happen to see the light in a newspaper,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut not\nbecause the magazine editors had been denied a glimpse at it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were talking of Harris,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said to Wolf Larsen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he acknowledged.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI remember the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Forge.\u00e2\u0080\u0099  Filled with pretty\nsentiments and an almighty faith in human illusions.  By the way, Mr. Van\nWeyden, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d better look in on Cooky.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaining and restless.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThus was I bluntly dismissed from the poop, only to find Mugridge\nsleeping soundly from the morphine I had given him.  I made no haste to\nreturn on deck, and when I did I was gratified to see Miss Brewster in\nanimated conversation with Wolf Larsen.  As I say, the sight gratified\nme.  She was following my advice.  And yet I was conscious of a slight\nshock or hurt in that she was able to do the thing I had begged her to do\nand which she had notably disliked.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nBrave winds, blowing fair, swiftly drove the _Ghost_ northward into the\nseal herd.  We encountered it well up to the forty-fourth parallel, in a\nraw and stormy sea across which the wind harried the fog-banks in eternal\nflight.  For days at a time we could never see the sun nor take an\nobservation; then the wind would sweep the face of the ocean clean, the\nwaves would ripple and flash, and we would learn where we were.  A day of\nclear weather might follow, or three days or four, and then the fog would\nsettle down upon us, seemingly thicker than ever.\n\nThe hunting was perilous; yet the boats, lowered day after day, were\nswallowed up in the grey obscurity, and were seen no more till nightfall,\nand often not till long after, when they would creep in like sea-wraiths,\none by one, out of the grey.  Wainwright\u00e2\u0080\u0094the hunter whom Wolf Larsen had\nstolen with boat and men\u00e2\u0080\u0094took advantage of the veiled sea and escaped.\nHe disappeared one morning in the encircling fog with his two men, and we\nnever saw them again, though it was not many days when we learned that\nthey had passed from schooner to schooner until they finally regained\ntheir own.\n\nThis was the thing I had set my mind upon doing, but the opportunity\nnever offered.  It was not in the mate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s province to go out in the boats,\nand though I man\u00c5\u0093uvred cunningly for it, Wolf Larsen never granted me the\nprivilege.  Had he done so, I should have managed somehow to carry Miss\nBrewster away with me.  As it was, the situation was approaching a stage\nwhich I was afraid to consider.  I involuntarily shunned the thought of\nit, and yet the thought continually arose in my mind like a haunting\nspectre.\n\nI had read sea-romances in my time, wherein figured, as a matter of\ncourse, the lone woman in the midst of a shipload of men; but I learned,\nnow, that I had never comprehended the deeper significance of such a\nsituation\u00e2\u0080\u0094the thing the writers harped upon and exploited so thoroughly.\nAnd here it was, now, and I was face to face with it.  That it should be\nas vital as possible, it required no more than that the woman should be\nMaud Brewster, who now charmed me in person as she had long charmed me\nthrough her work.\n\nNo one more out of environment could be imagined.  She was a delicate,\nethereal creature, swaying and willowy, light and graceful of movement.\nIt never seemed to me that she walked, or, at least, walked after the\nordinary manner of mortals.  Hers was an extreme lithesomeness, and she\nmoved with a certain indefinable airiness, approaching one as down might\nfloat or as a bird on noiseless wings.\n\nShe was like a bit of Dresden china, and I was continually impressed with\nwhat I may call her fragility.  As at the time I caught her arm when\nhelping her below, so at any time I was quite prepared, should stress or\nrough handling befall her, to see her crumble away.  I have never seen\nbody and spirit in such perfect accord.  Describe her verse, as the\ncritics have described it, as sublimated and spiritual, and you have\ndescribed her body.  It seemed to partake of her soul, to have analogous\nattributes, and to link it to life with the slenderest of chains.\nIndeed, she trod the earth lightly, and in her constitution there was\nlittle of the robust clay.\n\nShe was in striking contrast to Wolf Larsen.  Each was nothing that the\nother was, everything that the other was not.  I noted them walking the\ndeck together one morning, and I likened them to the extreme ends of the\nhuman ladder of evolution\u00e2\u0080\u0094the one the culmination of all savagery, the\nother the finished product of the finest civilization.  True, Wolf Larsen\npossessed intellect to an unusual degree, but it was directed solely to\nthe exercise of his savage instincts and made him but the more formidable\na savage.  He was splendidly muscled, a heavy man, and though he strode\nwith the certitude and directness of the physical man, there was nothing\nheavy about his stride.  The jungle and the wilderness lurked in the\nuplift and downput of his feet.  He was cat-footed, and lithe, and\nstrong, always strong.  I likened him to some great tiger, a beast of\nprowess and prey.  He looked it, and the piercing glitter that arose at\ntimes in his eyes was the same piercing glitter I had observed in the\neyes of caged leopards and other preying creatures of the wild.\n\nBut this day, as I noted them pacing up and down, I saw that it was she\nwho terminated the walk.  They came up to where I was standing by the\nentrance to the companion-way.  Though she betrayed it by no outward\nsign, I felt, somehow, that she was greatly perturbed.  She made some\nidle remark, looking at me, and laughed lightly enough; but I saw her\neyes return to his, involuntarily, as though fascinated; then they fell,\nbut not swiftly enough to veil the rush of terror that filled them.\n\nIt was in his eyes that I saw the cause of her perturbation.  Ordinarily\ngrey and cold and harsh, they were now warm and soft and golden, and all\na-dance with tiny lights that dimmed and faded, or welled up till the\nfull orbs were flooded with a glowing radiance.  Perhaps it was to this\nthat the golden colour was due; but golden his eyes were, enticing and\nmasterful, at the same time luring and compelling, and speaking a demand\nand clamour of the blood which no woman, much less Maud Brewster, could\nmisunderstand.\n\nHer own terror rushed upon me, and in that moment of fear\u00e2\u0080\u0094the most\nterrible fear a man can experience\u00e2\u0080\u0094I knew that in inexpressible ways she\nwas dear to me.  The knowledge that I loved her rushed upon me with the\nterror, and with both emotions gripping at my heart and causing my blood\nat the same time to chill and to leap riotously, I felt myself drawn by a\npower without me and beyond me, and found my eyes returning against my\nwill to gaze into the eyes of Wolf Larsen.  But he had recovered himself.\nThe golden colour and the dancing lights were gone.  Cold and grey and\nglittering they were as he bowed brusquely and turned away.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am afraid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she whispered, with a shiver.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am so afraid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI, too, was afraid, and what of my discovery of how much she meant to me\nmy mind was in a turmoil; but, I succeeded in answering quite calmly:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll will come right, Miss Brewster.  Trust me, it will come right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe answered with a grateful little smile that sent my heart pounding,\nand started to descend the companion-stairs.\n\nFor a long while I remained standing where she had left me.  There was\nimperative need to adjust myself, to consider the significance of the\nchanged aspect of things.  It had come, at last, love had come, when I\nleast expected it and under the most forbidding conditions.  Of course,\nmy philosophy had always recognized the inevitableness of the love-call\nsooner or later; but long years of bookish silence had made me\ninattentive and unprepared.\n\nAnd now it had come!  Maud Brewster!  My memory flashed back to that\nfirst thin little volume on my desk, and I saw before me, as though in\nthe concrete, the row of thin little volumes on my library shelf.  How I\nhad welcomed each of them!  Each year one had come from the press, and to\nme each was the advent of the year.  They had voiced a kindred intellect\nand spirit, and as such I had received them into a camaraderie of the\nmind; but now their place was in my heart.\n\nMy heart?  A revulsion of feeling came over me.  I seemed to stand\noutside myself and to look at myself incredulously.  Maud Brewster!\nHumphrey Van Weyden, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe cold-blooded fish,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the \u00e2\u0080\u009cemotionless monster,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nthe \u00e2\u0080\u009canalytical demon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d of Charley Furuseth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s christening, in love!  And\nthen, without rhyme or reason, all sceptical, my mind flew back to a\nsmall biographical note in the red-bound _Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Who_, and I said to\nmyself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe was born in Cambridge, and she is twenty-seven years old.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAnd then I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwenty-seven years old and still free and fancy free?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nBut how did I know she was fancy free?  And the pang of new-born jealousy\nput all incredulity to flight.  There was no doubt about it.  I was\njealous; therefore I loved.  And the woman I loved was Maud Brewster.\n\nI, Humphrey Van Weyden, was in love!  And again the doubt assailed me.\nNot that I was afraid of it, however, or reluctant to meet it.  On the\ncontrary, idealist that I was to the most pronounced degree, my\nphilosophy had always recognized and guerdoned love as the greatest thing\nin the world, the aim and the summit of being, the most exquisite pitch\nof joy and happiness to which life could thrill, the thing of all things\nto be hailed and welcomed and taken into the heart.  But now that it had\ncome I could not believe.  I could not be so fortunate.  It was too good,\ntoo good to be true.  Symons\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lines came into my head:\n\n   \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wandered all these years among\n   A world of women, seeking you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then I had ceased seeking.  It was not for me, this greatest thing in\nthe world, I had decided.  Furuseth was right; I was abnormal, an\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cemotionless monster,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a strange bookish creature, capable of pleasuring\nin sensations only of the mind.  And though I had been surrounded by\nwomen all my days, my appreciation of them had been \u00c3\u00a6sthetic and nothing\nmore.  I had actually, at times, considered myself outside the pale, a\nmonkish fellow denied the eternal or the passing passions I saw and\nunderstood so well in others.  And now it had come!  Undreamed of and\nunheralded, it had come.  In what could have been no less than an\necstasy, I left my post at the head of the companion-way and started\nalong the deck, murmuring to myself those beautiful lines of Mrs.\nBrowning:\n\n   \u00e2\u0080\u009cI lived with visions for my company\n   Instead of men and women years ago,\n   And found them gentle mates, nor thought to know\n   A sweeter music than they played to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut the sweeter music was playing in my ears, and I was blind and\noblivious to all about me.  The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat the hell are you up to?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he was demanding.\n\nI had strayed forward where the sailors were painting, and I came to\nmyself to find my advancing foot on the verge of overturning a paint-pot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSleep-walking, sunstroke,\u00e2\u0080\u0094what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he barked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo; indigestion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I retorted, and continued my walk as if nothing\nuntoward had occurred.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nAmong the most vivid memories of my life are those of the events on the\n_Ghost_ which occurred during the forty hours succeeding the discovery of\nmy love for Maud Brewster.  I, who had lived my life in quiet places,\nonly to enter at the age of thirty-five upon a course of the most\nirrational adventure I could have imagined, never had more incident and\nexcitement crammed into any forty hours of my experience.  Nor can I\nquite close my ears to a small voice of pride which tells me I did not do\nso badly, all things considered.\n\nTo begin with, at the midday dinner, Wolf Larsen informed the hunters\nthat they were to eat thenceforth in the steerage.  It was an\nunprecedented thing on sealing-schooners, where it is the custom for the\nhunters to rank, unofficially as officers.  He gave no reason, but his\nmotive was obvious enough.  Horner and Smoke had been displaying a\ngallantry toward Maud Brewster, ludicrous in itself and inoffensive to\nher, but to him evidently distasteful.\n\nThe announcement was received with black silence, though the other four\nhunters glanced significantly at the two who had been the cause of their\nbanishment.  Jock Horner, quiet as was his way, gave no sign; but the\nblood surged darkly across Smoke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forehead, and he half opened his mouth\nto speak.  Wolf Larsen was watching him, waiting for him, the steely\nglitter in his eyes; but Smoke closed his mouth again without having said\nanything.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnything to say?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the other demanded aggressively.\n\nIt was a challenge, but Smoke refused to accept it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAbout what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked, so innocently that Wolf Larsen was disconcerted,\nwhile the others smiled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, nothing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen said lamely.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just thought you might want\nto register a kick.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAbout what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the imperturbable Smoke.\n\nSmoke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mates were now smiling broadly.  His captain could have killed\nhim, and I doubt not that blood would have flowed had not Maud Brewster\nbeen present.  For that matter, it was her presence which enabled Smoke\nto act as he did.  He was too discreet and cautious a man to incur Wolf\nLarsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anger at a time when that anger could be expressed in terms\nstronger than words.  I was in fear that a struggle might take place, but\na cry from the helmsman made it easy for the situation to save itself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSmoke ho!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the cry came down the open companion-way.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it bear?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen called up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDead astern, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Russian,\u00e2\u0080\u009d suggested Latimer.\n\nHis words brought anxiety into the faces of the other hunters.  A Russian\ncould mean but one thing\u00e2\u0080\u0094a cruiser.  The hunters, never more than roughly\naware of the position of the ship, nevertheless knew that we were close\nto the boundaries of the forbidden sea, while Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record as a\npoacher was notorious.  All eyes centred upon him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dead safe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he assured them with a laugh.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo salt mines this\ntime, Smoke.  But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you what\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll lay odds of five to one it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nthe _Macedonia_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNo one accepted his offer, and he went on: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn which event, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll lay ten\nto one there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trouble breezing up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, thank you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Latimer spoke up.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t object to losing my money,\nbut I like to get a run for it anyway.  There never was a time when there\nwasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trouble when you and that brother of yours got together, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nlay twenty to one on that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA general smile followed, in which Wolf Larsen joined, and the dinner\nwent on smoothly, thanks to me, for he treated me abominably the rest of\nthe meal, sneering at me and patronizing me till I was all a-tremble with\nsuppressed rage.  Yet I knew I must control myself for Maud Brewster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsake, and I received my reward when her eyes caught mine for a fleeting\nsecond, and they said, as distinctly as if she spoke, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBe brave, be\nbrave.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe left the table to go on deck, for a steamer was a welcome break in the\nmonotony of the sea on which we floated, while the conviction that it was\nDeath Larsen and the _Macedonia_ added to the excitement.  The stiff\nbreeze and heavy sea which had sprung up the previous afternoon had been\nmoderating all morning, so that it was now possible to lower the boats\nfor an afternoon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hunt.  The hunting promised to be profitable.  We had\nsailed since daylight across a sea barren of seals, and were now running\ninto the herd.\n\nThe smoke was still miles astern, but overhauling us rapidly, when we\nlowered our boats.  They spread out and struck a northerly course across\nthe ocean.  Now and again we saw a sail lower, heard the reports of the\nshot-guns, and saw the sail go up again.  The seals were thick, the wind\nwas dying away; everything favoured a big catch.  As we ran off to get\nour leeward position of the last lee boat, we found the ocean fairly\ncarpeted with sleeping seals.  They were all about us, thicker than I had\never seen them before, in twos and threes and bunches, stretched full\nlength on the surface and sleeping for all the world like so many lazy\nyoung dogs.\n\nUnder the approaching smoke the hull and upper-works of a steamer were\ngrowing larger.  It was the _Macedonia_.  I read her name through the\nglasses as she passed by scarcely a mile to starboard.  Wolf Larsen\nlooked savagely at the vessel, while Maud Brewster was curious.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is the trouble you were so sure was breezing up, Captain Larsen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nshe asked gaily.\n\nHe glanced at her, a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s amusement softening his features.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat did you expect?  That they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d come aboard and cut our throats?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSomething like that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she confessed.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou understand, seal-hunters are\nso new and strange to me that I am quite ready to expect anything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe nodded his head.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cQuite right, quite right.  Your error is that you\nfailed to expect the worst.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, what can be worse than cutting our throats?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked, with pretty\nna\u00c3\u00afve surprise.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCutting our purses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMan is so made these days that his\ncapacity for living is determined by the money he possesses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Who steals my purse steals trash,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d she quoted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho steals my purse steals my right to live,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the reply, \u00e2\u0080\u009cold saws\nto the contrary.  For he steals my bread and meat and bed, and in so\ndoing imperils my life.  There are not enough soup-kitchens and\nbread-lines to go around, you know, and when men have nothing in their\npurses they usually die, and die miserably\u00e2\u0080\u0094unless they are able to fill\ntheir purses pretty speedily.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I fail to see that this steamer has any designs on your purse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWait and you will see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered grimly.\n\nWe did not have long to wait.  Having passed several miles beyond our\nline of boats, the _Macedonia_ proceeded to lower her own.  We knew she\ncarried fourteen boats to our five (we were one short through the\ndesertion of Wainwright), and she began dropping them far to leeward of\nour last boat, continued dropping them athwart our course, and finished\ndropping them far to windward of our first weather boat.  The hunting,\nfor us, was spoiled.  There were no seals behind us, and ahead of us the\nline of fourteen boats, like a huge broom, swept the herd before it.\n\nOur boats hunted across the two or three miles of water between them and\nthe point where the _Macedonia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s_ had been dropped, and then headed for\nhome.  The wind had fallen to a whisper, the ocean was growing calmer and\ncalmer, and this, coupled with the presence of the great herd, made a\nperfect hunting day\u00e2\u0080\u0094one of the two or three days to be encountered in the\nwhole of a lucky season.  An angry lot of men, boat-pullers and steerers\nas well as hunters, swarmed over our side.  Each man felt that he had\nbeen robbed; and the boats were hoisted in amid curses, which, if curses\nhad power, would have settled Death Larsen for all eternity\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cDead and\ndamned for a dozen iv eternities,\u00e2\u0080\u009d commented Louis, his eyes twinkling up\nat me as he rested from hauling taut the lashings of his boat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen to them, and find if it is hard to discover the most vital thing\nin their souls,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Wolf Larsen.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFaith? and love? and high ideals?\nThe good? the beautiful? the true?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTheir innate sense of right has been violated,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maud Brewster said,\njoining the conversation.\n\nShe was standing a dozen feet away, one hand resting on the main-shrouds\nand her body swaying gently to the slight roll of the ship.  She had not\nraised her voice, and yet I was struck by its clear and bell-like tone.\nAh, it was sweet in my ears!  I scarcely dared look at her just then, for\nthe fear of betraying myself.  A boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cap was perched on her head, and\nher hair, light brown and arranged in a loose and fluffy order that\ncaught the sun, seemed an aureole about the delicate oval of her face.\nShe was positively bewitching, and, withal, sweetly spirituelle, if not\nsaintly.  All my old-time marvel at life returned to me at sight of this\nsplendid incarnation of it, and Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cold explanation of life\nand its meaning was truly ridiculous and laughable.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA sentimentalist,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he sneered, \u00e2\u0080\u009clike Mr. Van Weyden.  Those men are\ncursing because their desires have been outraged.  That is all.  What\ndesires?  The desires for the good grub and soft beds ashore which a\nhandsome pay-day brings them\u00e2\u0080\u0094the women and the drink, the gorging and the\nbeastliness which so truly expresses them, the best that is in them,\ntheir highest aspirations, their ideals, if you please.  The exhibition\nthey make of their feelings is not a touching sight, yet it shows how\ndeeply they have been touched, how deeply their purses have been touched,\nfor to lay hands on their purses is to lay hands on their souls.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099You hardly behave as if your purse had been touched,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said,\nsmilingly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen it so happens that I am behaving differently, for my purse and my\nsoul have both been touched.  At the current price of skins in the London\nmarket, and based on a fair estimate of what the afternoon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s catch would\nhave been had not the _Macedonia_ hogged it, the _Ghost_ has lost about\nfifteen hundred dollars\u00e2\u0080\u0099 worth of skins.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou speak so calmly\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d she began.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I do not feel calm; I could kill the man who robbed me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\ninterrupted.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes, I know, and that man my brother\u00e2\u0080\u0094more sentiment!\nBah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis face underwent a sudden change.  His voice was less harsh and wholly\nsincere as he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must be happy, you sentimentalists, really and truly happy at\ndreaming and finding things good, and, because you find some of them\ngood, feeling good yourself.  Now, tell me, you two, do you find me\ngood?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are good to look upon\u00e2\u0080\u0094in a way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I qualified.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are in you all powers for good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was Maud Brewster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s answer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere you are!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried at her, half angrily.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour words are empty to\nme.  There is nothing clear and sharp and definite about the thought you\nhave expressed.  You cannot pick it up in your two hands and look at it.\nIn point of fact, it is not a thought.  It is a feeling, a sentiment, a\nsomething based upon illusion and not a product of the intellect at all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs he went on his voice again grew soft, and a confiding note came into\nit.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know, I sometimes catch myself wishing that I, too, were\nblind to the facts of life and only knew its fancies and illusions.\nThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re wrong, all wrong, of course, and contrary to reason; but in the\nface of them my reason tells me, wrong and most wrong, that to dream and\nlive illusions gives greater delight.  And after all, delight is the wage\nfor living.  Without delight, living is a worthless act.  To labour at\nliving and be unpaid is worse than to be dead.  He who delights the most\nlives the most, and your dreams and unrealities are less disturbing to\nyou and more gratifying than are my facts to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe shook his head slowly, pondering.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI often doubt, I often doubt, the worthwhileness of reason.  Dreams must\nbe more substantial and satisfying.  Emotional delight is more filling\nand lasting than intellectual delight; and, besides, you pay for your\nmoments of intellectual delight by having the blues.  Emotional delight\nis followed by no more than jaded senses which speedily recuperate.  I\nenvy you, I envy you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe stopped abruptly, and then on his lips formed one of his strange\nquizzical smiles, as he added:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s from my brain I envy you, take notice, and not from my heart.  My\nreason dictates it.  The envy is an intellectual product.  I am like a\nsober man looking upon drunken men, and, greatly weary, wishing he, too,\nwere drunk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOr like a wise man looking upon fools and wishing he, too, were a fool,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nI laughed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cQuite so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a blessed, bankrupt pair of fools.  You\nhave no facts in your pocketbook.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYet we spend as freely as you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was Maud Brewster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contribution.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMore freely, because it costs you nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd because we draw upon eternity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she retorted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhether you do or think you do, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the same thing.  You spend what you\nhaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got, and in return you get greater value from spending what you\nhaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got than I get from spending what I have got, and what I have\nsweated to get.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you change the basis of your coinage, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she queried\nteasingly.\n\nHe looked at her quickly, half-hopefully, and then said, all regretfully:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cToo late.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to, perhaps, but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  My pocketbook is stuffed\nwith the old coinage, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a stubborn thing.  I can never bring\nmyself to recognize anything else as valid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe ceased speaking, and his gaze wandered absently past her and became\nlost in the placid sea.  The old primal melancholy was strong upon him.\nHe was quivering to it.  He had reasoned himself into a spell of the\nblues, and within few hours one could look for the devil within him to be\nup and stirring.  I remembered Charley Furuseth, and knew this man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsadness as the penalty which the materialist ever pays for his\nmaterialism.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been on deck, Mr. Van Weyden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen said, the following\nmorning at the breakfast-table, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do things look?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cClear enough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered, glancing at the sunshine which streamed down\nthe open companion-way.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFair westerly breeze, with a promise of\nstiffening, if Louis predicts correctly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe nodded his head in a pleased way.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAny signs of fog?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThick banks in the north and north-west.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe nodded his head again, evincing even greater satisfaction than before.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat of the _Macedonia_?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot sighted,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered.\n\nI could have sworn his face fell at the intelligence, but why he should\nbe disappointed I could not conceive.\n\nI was soon to learn.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSmoke ho!\u00e2\u0080\u009d came the hail from on deck, and his\nface brightened.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed, and left the table at once to go on deck and into\nthe steerage, where the hunters were taking the first breakfast of their\nexile.\n\nMaud Brewster and I scarcely touched the food before us, gazing, instead,\nin silent anxiety at each other, and listening to Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice,\nwhich easily penetrated the cabin through the intervening bulkhead.  He\nspoke at length, and his conclusion was greeted with a wild roar of\ncheers.  The bulkhead was too thick for us to hear what he said; but\nwhatever it was it affected the hunters strongly, for the cheering was\nfollowed by loud exclamations and shouts of joy.\n\nFrom the sounds on deck I knew that the sailors had been routed out and\nwere preparing to lower the boats.  Maud Brewster accompanied me on deck,\nbut I left her at the break of the poop, where she might watch the scene\nand not be in it.  The sailors must have learned whatever project was on\nhand, and the vim and snap they put into their work attested their\nenthusiasm.  The hunters came trooping on deck with shot-guns and\nammunition-boxes, and, most unusual, their rifles.  The latter were\nrarely taken in the boats, for a seal shot at long range with a rifle\ninvariably sank before a boat could reach it.  But each hunter this day\nhad his rifle and a large supply of cartridges.  I noticed they grinned\nwith satisfaction whenever they looked at the _Macedonia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s_ smoke, which\nwas rising higher and higher as she approached from the west.\n\nThe five boats went over the side with a rush, spread out like the ribs\nof a fan, and set a northerly course, as on the preceding afternoon, for\nus to follow.  I watched for some time, curiously, but there seemed\nnothing extraordinary about their behaviour.  They lowered sails, shot\nseals, and hoisted sails again, and continued on their way as I had\nalways seen them do.  The _Macedonia_ repeated her performance of\nyesterday, \u00e2\u0080\u009chogging\u00e2\u0080\u009d the sea by dropping her line of boats in advance of\nours and across our course.  Fourteen boats require a considerable spread\nof ocean for comfortable hunting, and when she had completely lapped our\nline she continued steaming into the north-east, dropping more boats as\nshe went.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked Wolf Larsen, unable longer to keep my curiosity in\ncheck.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever mind what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered gruffly.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a thousand\nyears in finding out, and in the meantime just pray for plenty of wind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, well, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind telling you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said the next moment.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\ngoing to give that brother of mine a taste of his own medicine.  In\nshort, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to play the hog myself, and not for one day, but for the\nrest of the season,\u00e2\u0080\u0094if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in luck.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I queried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot to be considered,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he laughed.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe simply must be in luck, or it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nall up with us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe had the wheel at the time, and I went forward to my hospital in the\nforecastle, where lay the two crippled men, Nilson and Thomas Mugridge.\nNilson was as cheerful as could be expected, for his broken leg was\nknitting nicely; but the Cockney was desperately melancholy, and I was\naware of a great sympathy for the unfortunate creature.  And the marvel\nof it was that still he lived and clung to life.  The brutal years had\nreduced his meagre body to splintered wreckage, and yet the spark of life\nwithin burned brightly as ever.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith an artificial foot\u00e2\u0080\u0094and they make excellent ones\u00e2\u0080\u0094you will be\nstumping ships\u00e2\u0080\u0099 galleys to the end of time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I assured him jovially.\n\nBut his answer was serious, nay, solemn.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know about wot you\ns\u00e2\u0080\u0099y, Mr. Van W\u00e2\u0080\u0099yden, but I do know I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never rest \u00e2\u0080\u0099appy till I see that\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099ell-\u00e2\u0080\u0099ound bloody well dead.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099E cawn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t live as long as me.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099E\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got no\nright to live, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 as the Good Word puts it, \u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0099E shall shorely die,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 an\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nI s\u00e2\u0080\u0099y, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Amen, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 damn soon at that.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen I returned on deck I found Wolf Larsen steering mainly with one\nhand, while with the other hand he held the marine glasses and studied\nthe situation of the boats, paying particular attention to the position\nof the _Macedonia_.  The only change noticeable in our boats was that\nthey had hauled close on the wind and were heading several points west of\nnorth.  Still, I could not see the expediency of the man\u00c5\u0093uvre, for the\nfree sea was still intercepted by the _Macedonia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s_ five weather boats,\nwhich, in turn, had hauled close on the wind.  Thus they slowly diverged\ntoward the west, drawing farther away from the remainder of the boats in\ntheir line.  Our boats were rowing as well as sailing.  Even the hunters\nwere pulling, and with three pairs of oars in the water they rapidly\noverhauled what I may appropriately term the enemy.\n\nThe smoke of the _Macedonia_ had dwindled to a dim blot on the\nnorth-eastern horizon.  Of the steamer herself nothing was to be seen.\nWe had been loafing along, till now, our sails shaking half the time and\nspilling the wind; and twice, for short periods, we had been hove to.\nBut there was no more loafing.  Sheets were trimmed, and Wolf Larsen\nproceeded to put the _Ghost_ through her paces.  We ran past our line of\nboats and bore down upon the first weather boat of the other line.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDown that flying jib, Mr. Van Weyden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen commanded.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd\nstand by to back over the jibs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI ran forward and had the downhaul of the flying jib all in and fast as\nwe slipped by the boat a hundred feet to leeward.  The three men in it\ngazed at us suspiciously.  They had been hogging the sea, and they knew\nWolf Larsen, by reputation at any rate.  I noted that the hunter, a huge\nScandinavian sitting in the bow, held his rifle, ready to hand, across\nhis knees.  It should have been in its proper place in the rack.  When\nthey came opposite our stern, Wolf Larsen greeted them with a wave of the\nhand, and cried:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome on board and have a \u00e2\u0080\u0099gam\u00e2\u0080\u0099!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo gam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d among the sealing-schooners, is a substitute for the verbs \u00e2\u0080\u009cto\nvisit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cto gossip.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  It expresses the garrulity of the sea, and is a\npleasant break in the monotony of the life.\n\nThe _Ghost_ swung around into the wind, and I finished my work forward in\ntime to run aft and lend a hand with the mainsheet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will please stay on deck, Miss Brewster,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen said, as he\nstarted forward to meet his guest.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you too, Mr. Van Weyden.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe boat had lowered its sail and run alongside.  The hunter, golden\nbearded like a sea-king, came over the rail and dropped on deck.  But his\nhugeness could not quite overcome his apprehensiveness.  Doubt and\ndistrust showed strongly in his face.  It was a transparent face, for all\nof its hairy shield, and advertised instant relief when he glanced from\nWolf Larsen to me, noted that there was only the pair of us, and then\nglanced over his own two men who had joined him.  Surely he had little\nreason to be afraid.  He towered like a Goliath above Wolf Larsen.  He\nmust have measured six feet eight or nine inches in stature, and I\nsubsequently learned his weight\u00e2\u0080\u0094240 pounds.  And there was no fat about\nhim.  It was all bone and muscle.\n\nA return of apprehension was apparent when, at the top of the\ncompanion-way, Wolf Larsen invited him below.  But he reassured himself\nwith a glance down at his host\u00e2\u0080\u0094a big man himself but dwarfed by the\npropinquity of the giant.  So all hesitancy vanished, and the pair\ndescended into the cabin.  In the meantime, his two men, as was the wont\nof visiting sailors, had gone forward into the forecastle to do some\nvisiting themselves.\n\nSuddenly, from the cabin came a great, choking bellow, followed by all\nthe sounds of a furious struggle.  It was the leopard and the lion, and\nthe lion made all the noise.  Wolf Larsen was the leopard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see the sacredness of our hospitality,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said bitterly to Maud\nBrewster.\n\nShe nodded her head that she heard, and I noted in her face the signs of\nthe same sickness at sight or sound of violent struggle from which I had\nsuffered so severely during my first weeks on the _Ghost_.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it be better if you went forward, say by the steerage\ncompanion-way, until it is over?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I suggested.\n\nShe shook her head and gazed at me pitifully.  She was not frightened,\nbut appalled, rather, at the human animality of it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will understand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I took advantage of the opportunity to say,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhatever part I take in what is going on and what is to come, that I am\ncompelled to take it\u00e2\u0080\u0094if you and I are ever to get out of this scrape with\nour lives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not nice\u00e2\u0080\u0094for me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I added.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, in a weak, far-away voice, and her eyes showed\nme that she did understand.\n\nThe sounds from below soon died away.  Then Wolf Larsen came alone on\ndeck.  There was a slight flush under his bronze, but otherwise he bore\nno signs of the battle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSend those two men aft, Mr. Van Weyden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nI obeyed, and a minute or two later they stood before him.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHoist in\nyour boat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to them.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour hunter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decided to stay aboard\nawhile and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want it pounding alongside.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHoist in your boat, I said,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he repeated, this time in sharper tones as\nthey hesitated to do his bidding.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho knows? you may have to sail with me for a time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, quite\nsoftly, with a silken threat that belied the softness, as they moved\nslowly to comply, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand we might as well start with a friendly\nunderstanding.  Lively now!  Death Larsen makes you jump better than\nthat, and you know it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTheir movements perceptibly quickened under his coaching, and as the boat\nswung inboard I was sent forward to let go the jibs.  Wolf Larsen, at the\nwheel, directed the _Ghost_ after the _Macedonia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s_ second weather boat.\n\nUnder way, and with nothing for the time being to do, I turned my\nattention to the situation of the boats.  The _Macedonia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s_ third weather\nboat was being attacked by two of ours, the fourth by our remaining\nthree; and the fifth, turn about, was taking a hand in the defence of its\nnearest mate.  The fight had opened at long distance, and the rifles were\ncracking steadily.  A quick, snappy sea was being kicked up by the wind,\na condition which prevented fine shooting; and now and again, as we drew\ncloser, we could see the bullets zip-zipping from wave to wave.\n\nThe boat we were pursuing had squared away and was running before the\nwind to escape us, and, in the course of its flight, to take part in\nrepulsing our general boat attack.\n\nAttending to sheets and tacks now left me little time to see what was\ntaking place, but I happened to be on the poop when Wolf Larsen ordered\nthe two strange sailors forward and into the forecastle.  They went\nsullenly, but they went.  He next ordered Miss Brewster below, and smiled\nat the instant horror that leapt into her eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find nothing gruesome down there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009conly an unhurt man\nsecurely made fast to the ring-bolts.  Bullets are liable to come aboard,\nand I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want you killed, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEven as he spoke, a bullet was deflected by a brass-capped spoke of the\nwheel between his hands and screeched off through the air to windward.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to her; and then to me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Van Weyden, will you take\nthe wheel?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMaud Brewster had stepped inside the companion-way so that only her head\nwas exposed.  Wolf Larsen had procured a rifle and was throwing a\ncartridge into the barrel.  I begged her with my eyes to go below, but\nshe smiled and said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe may be feeble land-creatures without legs, but we can show Captain\nLarsen that we are at least as brave as he.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe gave her a quick look of admiration.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI like you a hundred per cent. better for that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBooks, and\nbrains, and bravery.  You are well-rounded, a blue-stocking fit to be the\nwife of a pirate chief.  Ahem, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll discuss that later,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he smiled, as a\nbullet struck solidly into the cabin wall.\n\nI saw his eyes flash golden as he spoke, and I saw the terror mount in\nher own.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are braver,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I hastened to say.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt least, speaking for myself, I\nknow I am braver than Captain Larsen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was I who was now favoured by a quick look.  He was wondering if I\nwere making fun of him.  I put three or four spokes over to counteract a\nsheer toward the wind on the part of the _Ghost_, and then steadied her.\nWolf Larsen was still waiting an explanation, and I pointed down to my\nknees.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will observe there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca slight trembling.  It is because I\nam afraid, the flesh is afraid; and I am afraid in my mind because I do\nnot wish to die.  But my spirit masters the trembling flesh and the\nqualms of the mind.  I am more than brave.  I am courageous.  Your flesh\nis not afraid.  You are not afraid.  On the one hand, it costs you\nnothing to encounter danger; on the other hand, it even gives you\ndelight.  You enjoy it.  You may be unafraid, Mr. Larsen, but you must\ngrant that the bravery is mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he acknowledged at once.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never thought of it in that\nway before.  But is the opposite true?  If you are braver than I, am I\nmore cowardly than you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe both laughed at the absurdity, and he dropped down to the deck and\nrested his rifle across the rail.  The bullets we had received had\ntravelled nearly a mile, but by now we had cut that distance in half.  He\nfired three careful shots.  The first struck fifty feet to windward of\nthe boat, the second alongside; and at the third the boat-steerer let\nloose his steering-oar and crumpled up in the bottom of the boat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI guess that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll fix them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen said, rising to his feet.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\ncouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford to let the hunter have it, and there is a chance the\nboat-puller doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to steer.  In which case, the hunter cannot\nsteer and shoot at the same time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis reasoning was justified, for the boat rushed at once into the wind\nand the hunter sprang aft to take the boat-steerer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s place.  There was no\nmore shooting, though the rifles were still cracking merrily from the\nother boats.\n\nThe hunter had managed to get the boat before the wind again, but we ran\ndown upon it, going at least two feet to its one.  A hundred yards away,\nI saw the boat-puller pass a rifle to the hunter.  Wolf Larsen went\namidships and took the coil of the throat-halyards from its pin.  Then he\npeered over the rail with levelled rifle.  Twice I saw the hunter let go\nthe steering-oar with one hand, reach for his rifle, and hesitate.  We\nwere now alongside and foaming past.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere, you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen cried suddenly to the boat-puller.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cTake a\nturn!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt the same time he flung the coil of rope.  It struck fairly, nearly\nknocking the man over, but he did not obey.  Instead, he looked to his\nhunter for orders.  The hunter, in turn, was in a quandary.  His rifle\nwas between his knees, but if he let go the steering-oar in order to\nshoot, the boat would sweep around and collide with the schooner.  Also\nhe saw Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rifle bearing upon him and knew he would be shot ere\nhe could get his rifle into play.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake a turn,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said quietly to the man.\n\nThe boat-puller obeyed, taking a turn around the little forward thwart\nand paying the line as it jerked taut.  The boat sheered out with a rush,\nand the hunter steadied it to a parallel course some twenty feet from the\nside of the _Ghost_.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, get that sail down and come alongside!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen ordered.\n\nHe never let go his rifle, even passing down the tackles with one hand.\nWhen they were fast, bow and stern, and the two uninjured men prepared to\ncome aboard, the hunter picked up his rifle as if to place it in a secure\nposition.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDrop it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen cried, and the hunter dropped it as though it were\nhot and had burned him.\n\nOnce aboard, the two prisoners hoisted in the boat and under Wolf\nLarsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s direction carried the wounded boat-steerer down into the\nforecastle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf our five boats do as well as you and I have done, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have a pretty\nfull crew,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen said to me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe man you shot\u00e2\u0080\u0094he is\u00e2\u0080\u0094I hope?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maud Brewster quavered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the shoulder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing serious, Mr. Van Weyden will\npull him around as good as ever in three or four weeks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pull those chaps around, from the look of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added,\npointing at the _Macedonia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s_ third boat, for which I had been steering\nand which was now nearly abreast of us.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Horner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Smoke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwork.  I told them we wanted live men, not carcasses.  But the joy of\nshooting to hit is a most compelling thing, when once you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned how\nto shoot.  Ever experienced it, Mr. Van Weyden?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI shook my head and regarded their work.  It had indeed been bloody, for\nthey had drawn off and joined our other three boats in the attack on the\nremaining two of the enemy.  The deserted boat was in the trough of the\nsea, rolling drunkenly across each comber, its loose spritsail out at\nright angles to it and fluttering and flapping in the wind.  The hunter\nand boat-puller were both lying awkwardly in the bottom, but the\nboat-steerer lay across the gunwale, half in and half out, his arms\ntrailing in the water and his head rolling from side to side.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look, Miss Brewster, please don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I had begged of her, and\nI was glad that she had minded me and been spared the sight.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHead right into the bunch, Mr. Van Weyden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s command.\n\nAs we drew nearer, the firing ceased, and we saw that the fight was over.\nThe remaining two boats had been captured by our five, and the seven were\ngrouped together, waiting to be picked up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook at that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried involuntarily, pointing to the north-east.\n\nThe blot of smoke which indicated the _Macedonia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s_ position had\nreappeared.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been watching it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s calm reply.  He measured\nthe distance away to the fog-bank, and for an instant paused to feel the\nweight of the wind on his cheek.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make it, I think; but you can\ndepend upon it that blessed brother of mine has twigged our little game\nand is just a-humping for us.  Ah, look at that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe blot of smoke had suddenly grown larger, and it was very black.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll beat you out, though, brother mine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he chuckled.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll beat you\nout, and I hope you no worse than that you rack your old engines into\nscrap.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen we hove to, a hasty though orderly confusion reigned.  The boats\ncame aboard from every side at once.  As fast as the prisoners came over\nthe rail they were marshalled forward to the forecastle by our hunters,\nwhile our sailors hoisted in the boats, pell-mell, dropping them anywhere\nupon the deck and not stopping to lash them.  We were already under way,\nall sails set and drawing, and the sheets being slacked off for a wind\nabeam, as the last boat lifted clear of the water and swung in the\ntackles.\n\nThere was need for haste.  The _Macedonia_, belching the blackest of\nsmoke from her funnel, was charging down upon us from out of the\nnorth-east.  Neglecting the boats that remained to her, she had altered\nher course so as to anticipate ours.  She was not running straight for\nus, but ahead of us.  Our courses were converging like the sides of an\nangle, the vertex of which was at the edge of the fog-bank.  It was\nthere, or not at all, that the _Macedonia_ could hope to catch us.  The\nhope for the _Ghost_ lay in that she should pass that point before the\n_Macedonia_ arrived at it.\n\nWolf Larsen was steering, his eyes glistening and snapping as they dwelt\nupon and leaped from detail to detail of the chase.  Now he studied the\nsea to windward for signs of the wind slackening or freshening, now the\n_Macedonia_; and again, his eyes roved over every sail, and he gave\ncommands to slack a sheet here a trifle, to come in on one there a\ntrifle, till he was drawing out of the _Ghost_ the last bit of speed she\npossessed.  All feuds and grudges were forgotten, and I was surprised at\nthe alacrity with which the men who had so long endured his brutality\nsprang to execute his orders.  Strange to say, the unfortunate Johnson\ncame into my mind as we lifted and surged and heeled along, and I was\naware of a regret that he was not alive and present; he had so loved the\n_Ghost_ and delighted in her sailing powers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBetter get your rifles, you fellows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen called to our hunters;\nand the five men lined the lee rail, guns in hand, and waited.\n\nThe _Macedonia_ was now but a mile away, the black smoke pouring from her\nfunnel at a right angle, so madly she raced, pounding through the sea at\na seventeen-knot gait\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Sky-hooting through the brine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as Wolf Larsen\nquoted while gazing at her.  We were not making more than nine knots, but\nthe fog-bank was very near.\n\nA puff of smoke broke from the _Macedonia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s_ deck, we heard a heavy\nreport, and a round hole took form in the stretched canvas of our\nmainsail.  They were shooting at us with one of the small cannon which\nrumour had said they carried on board.  Our men, clustering amidships,\nwaved their hats and raised a derisive cheer.  Again there was a puff of\nsmoke and a loud report, this time the cannon-ball striking not more than\ntwenty feet astern and glancing twice from sea to sea to windward ere it\nsank.\n\nBut there was no rifle-firing for the reason that all their hunters were\nout in the boats or our prisoners.  When the two vessels were half-a-mile\napart, a third shot made another hole in our mainsail.  Then we entered\nthe fog.  It was about us, veiling and hiding us in its dense wet gauze.\n\nThe sudden transition was startling.  The moment before we had been\nleaping through the sunshine, the clear sky above us, the sea breaking\nand rolling wide to the horizon, and a ship, vomiting smoke and fire and\niron missiles, rushing madly upon us.  And at once, as in an instant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nleap, the sun was blotted out, there was no sky, even our mastheads were\nlost to view, and our horizon was such as tear-blinded eyes may see.  The\ngrey mist drove by us like a rain.  Every woollen filament of our\ngarments, every hair of our heads and faces, was jewelled with a crystal\nglobule.  The shrouds were wet with moisture; it dripped from our rigging\noverhead; and on the underside of our booms drops of water took shape in\nlong swaying lines, which were detached and flung to the deck in mimic\nshowers at each surge of the schooner.  I was aware of a pent, stifled\nfeeling.  As the sounds of the ship thrusting herself through the waves\nwere hurled back upon us by the fog, so were one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thoughts.  The mind\nrecoiled from contemplation of a world beyond this wet veil which wrapped\nus around.  This was the world, the universe itself, its bounds so near\none felt impelled to reach out both arms and push them back.  It was\nimpossible, that the rest could be beyond these walls of grey.  The rest\nwas a dream, no more than the memory of a dream.\n\nIt was weird, strangely weird.  I looked at Maud Brewster and knew that\nshe was similarly affected.  Then I looked at Wolf Larsen, but there was\nnothing subjective about his state of consciousness.  His whole concern\nwas with the immediate, objective present.  He still held the wheel, and\nI felt that he was timing Time, reckoning the passage of the minutes with\neach forward lunge and leeward roll of the _Ghost_.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo for\u00e2\u0080\u0099ard and hard alee without any noise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to me in a low\nvoice.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cClew up the topsails first.  Set men at all the sheets.  Let\nthere be no rattling of blocks, no sound of voices.  No noise,\nunderstand, no noise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen all was ready, the word \u00e2\u0080\u009chard-a-lee\u00e2\u0080\u009d was passed forward to me from\nman to man; and the _Ghost_ heeled about on the port tack with\npractically no noise at all.  And what little there was,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the slapping of\na few reef-points and the creaking of a sheave in a block or two,\u00e2\u0080\u0094was\nghostly under the hollow echoing pall in which we were swathed.\n\nWe had scarcely filled away, it seemed, when the fog thinned abruptly and\nwe were again in the sunshine, the wide-stretching sea breaking before us\nto the sky-line.  But the ocean was bare.  No wrathful _Macedonia_ broke\nits surface nor blackened the sky with her smoke.\n\nWolf Larsen at once squared away and ran down along the rim of the\nfog-bank.  His trick was obvious.  He had entered the fog to windward of\nthe steamer, and while the steamer had blindly driven on into the fog in\nthe chance of catching him, he had come about and out of his shelter and\nwas now running down to re-enter to leeward.  Successful in this, the old\nsimile of the needle in the haystack would be mild indeed compared with\nhis brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chance of finding him.  He did not run long.  Jibing the\nfore- and main-sails and setting the topsails again, we headed back into\nthe bank.  As we entered I could have sworn I saw a vague bulk emerging\nto windward.  I looked quickly at Wolf Larsen.  Already we were ourselves\nburied in the fog, but he nodded his head.  He, too, had seen it\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\n_Macedonia_, guessing his man\u00c5\u0093uvre and failing by a moment in\nanticipating it.  There was no doubt that we had escaped unseen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep this up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to go back for\nthe rest of his boats.  Send a man to the wheel, Mr. Van Weyden, keep\nthis course for the present, and you might as well set the watches, for\nwe won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do any lingering to-night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d give five hundred dollars, though,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust to be aboard the\n_Macedonia_ for five minutes, listening to my brother curse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now, Mr. Van Weyden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to me when he had been relieved from\nthe wheel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe must make these new-comers welcome.  Serve out plenty of\nwhisky to the hunters and see that a few bottles slip for\u00e2\u0080\u0099ard.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nwager every man Jack of them is over the side to-morrow, hunting for Wolf\nLarsen as contentedly as ever they hunted for Death Larsen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they escape as Wainwright did?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\nHe laughed shrewdly.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot as long as our old hunters have anything to\nsay about it.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m dividing amongst them a dollar a skin for all the\nskins shot by our new hunters.  At least half of their enthusiasm to-day\nwas due to that.  Oh, no, there won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be any escaping if they have\nanything to say about it.  And now you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d better get for\u00e2\u0080\u0099ard to your\nhospital duties.  There must be a full ward waiting for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\nWolf Larsen took the distribution of the whisky off my hands, and the\nbottles began to make their appearance while I worked over the fresh\nbatch of wounded men in the forecastle.  I had seen whisky drunk, such as\nwhisky-and-soda by the men of the clubs, but never as these men drank it,\nfrom pannikins and mugs, and from the bottles\u00e2\u0080\u0094great brimming drinks, each\none of which was in itself a debauch.  But they did not stop at one or\ntwo.  They drank and drank, and ever the bottles slipped forward and they\ndrank more.\n\nEverybody drank; the wounded drank; Oofty-Oofty, who helped me, drank.\nOnly Louis refrained, no more than cautiously wetting his lips with the\nliquor, though he joined in the revels with an abandon equal to that of\nmost of them.  It was a saturnalia.  In loud voices they shouted over the\nday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fighting, wrangled about details, or waxed affectionate and made\nfriends with the men whom they had fought.  Prisoners and captors\nhiccoughed on one another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulders, and swore mighty oaths of respect\nand esteem.  They wept over the miseries of the past and over the\nmiseries yet to come under the iron rule of Wolf Larsen.  And all cursed\nhim and told terrible tales of his brutality.\n\nIt was a strange and frightful spectacle\u00e2\u0080\u0094the small, bunk-lined space, the\nfloor and walls leaping and lurching, the dim light, the swaying shadows\nlengthening and fore-shortening monstrously, the thick air heavy with\nsmoke and the smell of bodies and iodoform, and the inflamed faces of the\nmen\u00e2\u0080\u0094half-men, I should call them.  I noted Oofty-Oofty, holding the end\nof a bandage and looking upon the scene, his velvety and luminous eyes\nglistening in the light like a deer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes, and yet I knew the barbaric\ndevil that lurked in his breast and belied all the softness and\ntenderness, almost womanly, of his face and form.  And I noticed the\nboyish face of Harrison,\u00e2\u0080\u0094a good face once, but now a demon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s,\u00e2\u0080\u0094convulsed\nwith passion as he told the new-comers of the hell-ship they were in and\nshrieked curses upon the head of Wolf Larsen.\n\nWolf Larsen it was, always Wolf Larsen, enslaver and tormentor of men, a\nmale Circe and these his swine, suffering brutes that grovelled before\nhim and revolted only in drunkenness and in secrecy.  And was I, too, one\nof his swine? I thought.  And Maud Brewster?  No!  I ground my teeth in\nmy anger and determination till the man I was attending winced under my\nhand and Oofty-Oofty looked at me with curiosity.  I felt endowed with a\nsudden strength.  What of my new-found love, I was a giant.  I feared\nnothing.  I would work my will through it all, in spite of Wolf Larsen\nand of my own thirty-five bookish years.  All would be well.  I would\nmake it well.  And so, exalted, upborne by a sense of power, I turned my\nback on the howling inferno and climbed to the deck, where the fog\ndrifted ghostly through the night and the air was sweet and pure and\nquiet.\n\nThe steerage, where were two wounded hunters, was a repetition of the\nforecastle, except that Wolf Larsen was not being cursed; and it was with\na great relief that I again emerged on deck and went aft to the cabin.\nSupper was ready, and Wolf Larsen and Maud were waiting for me.\n\nWhile all his ship was getting drunk as fast as it could, he remained\nsober.  Not a drop of liquor passed his lips.  He did not dare it under\nthe circumstances, for he had only Louis and me to depend upon, and Louis\nwas even now at the wheel.  We were sailing on through the fog without a\nlook-out and without lights.  That Wolf Larsen had turned the liquor\nloose among his men surprised me, but he evidently knew their psychology\nand the best method of cementing in cordiality, what had begun in\nbloodshed.\n\nHis victory over Death Larsen seemed to have had a remarkable effect upon\nhim.  The previous evening he had reasoned himself into the blues, and I\nhad been waiting momentarily for one of his characteristic outbursts.\nYet nothing had occurred, and he was now in splendid trim.  Possibly his\nsuccess in capturing so many hunters and boats had counteracted the\ncustomary reaction.  At any rate, the blues were gone, and the blue\ndevils had not put in an appearance.  So I thought at the time; but, ah\nme, little I knew him or knew that even then, perhaps, he was meditating\nan outbreak more terrible than any I had seen.\n\nAs I say, he discovered himself in splendid trim when I entered the\ncabin.  He had had no headaches for weeks, his eyes were clear blue as\nthe sky, his bronze was beautiful with perfect health; life swelled\nthrough his veins in full and magnificent flood.  While waiting for me he\nhad engaged Maud in animated discussion.  Temptation was the topic they\nhad hit upon, and from the few words I heard I made out that he was\ncontending that temptation was temptation only when a man was seduced by\nit and fell.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor look you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he was saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas I see it, a man does things because of\ndesire.  He has many desires.  He may desire to escape pain, or to enjoy\npleasure.  But whatever he does, he does because he desires to do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut suppose he desires to do two opposite things, neither of which will\npermit him to do the other?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maud interrupted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe very thing I was coming to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd between these two desires is just where the soul of the man is\nmanifest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she went on.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it is a good soul, it will desire and do the\ngood action, and the contrary if it is a bad soul.  It is the soul that\ndecides.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBosh and nonsense!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed impatiently.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is the desire that\ndecides.  Here is a man who wants to, say, get drunk.  Also, he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nwant to get drunk.  What does he do?  How does he do it?  He is a puppet.\nHe is the creature of his desires, and of the two desires he obeys the\nstrongest one, that is all.  His soul hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anything to do with it.  How\ncan he be tempted to get drunk and refuse to get drunk?  If the desire to\nremain sober prevails, it is because it is the strongest desire.\nTemptation plays no part, unless\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d he paused while grasping the new\nthought which had come into his mind\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cunless he is tempted to remain\nsober.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHa! ha!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he laughed.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you think of that, Mr. Van Weyden?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat both of you are hair-splitting,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soul is his\ndesires.  Or, if you will, the sum of his desires is his soul.  Therein\nyou are both wrong.  You lay the stress upon the desire apart from the\nsoul, Miss Brewster lays the stress on the soul apart from the desire,\nand in point of fact soul and desire are the same thing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHowever,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Brewster is right in contending that\ntemptation is temptation whether the man yield or overcome.  Fire is\nfanned by the wind until it leaps up fiercely.  So is desire like fire.\nIt is fanned, as by a wind, by sight of the thing desired, or by a new\nand luring description or comprehension of the thing desired.  There lies\nthe temptation.  It is the wind that fans the desire until it leaps up to\nmastery.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s temptation.  It may not fan sufficiently to make the\ndesire overmastering, but in so far as it fans at all, that far is it\ntemptation.  And, as you say, it may tempt for good as well as for evil.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI felt proud of myself as we sat down to the table.  My words had been\ndecisive.  At least they had put an end to the discussion.\n\nBut Wolf Larsen seemed voluble, prone to speech as I had never seen him\nbefore.  It was as though he were bursting with pent energy which must\nfind an outlet somehow.  Almost immediately he launched into a discussion\non love.  As usual, his was the sheer materialistic side, and Maud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s was\nthe idealistic.  For myself, beyond a word or so of suggestion or\ncorrection now and again, I took no part.\n\nHe was brilliant, but so was Maud, and for some time I lost the thread of\nthe conversation through studying her face as she talked.  It was a face\nthat rarely displayed colour, but to-night it was flushed and vivacious.\nHer wit was playing keenly, and she was enjoying the tilt as much as Wolf\nLarsen, and he was enjoying it hugely.  For some reason, though I know\nnot why in the argument, so utterly had I lost it in the contemplation of\none stray brown lock of Maud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hair, he quoted from Iseult at Tintagel,\nwhere she says:\n\n   \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlessed am I beyond women even herein,\n   That beyond all born women is my sin,\n   And perfect my transgression.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs he had read pessimism into Omar, so now he read triumph, stinging\ntriumph and exultation, into Swinburne\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lines.  And he read rightly, and\nhe read well.  He had hardly ceased reading when Louis put his head into\nthe companion-way and whispered down:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe easy, will ye?  The fog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lifted, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis the port light iv a\nsteamer that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crossin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 our bow this blessed minute.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWolf Larsen sprang on deck, and so swiftly that by the time we followed\nhim he had pulled the steerage-slide over the drunken clamour and was on\nhis way forward to close the forecastle-scuttle.  The fog, though it\nremained, had lifted high, where it obscured the stars and made the night\nquite black.  Directly ahead of us I could see a bright red light and a\nwhite light, and I could hear the pulsing of a steamer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s engines.  Beyond\na doubt it was the _Macedonia_.\n\nWolf Larsen had returned to the poop, and we stood in a silent group,\nwatching the lights rapidly cross our bow.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLucky for me he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t carry a searchlight,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat if I should cry out loudly?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I queried in a whisper.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would be all up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut have you thought upon what would\nimmediately happen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBefore I had time to express any desire to know, he had me by the throat\nwith his gorilla grip, and by a faint quiver of the muscles\u00e2\u0080\u0094a hint, as it\nwere\u00e2\u0080\u0094he suggested to me the twist that would surely have broken my neck.\nThe next moment he had released me and we were gazing at the\n_Macedonia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s_ lights.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat if I should cry out?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maud asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI like you too well to hurt you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said softly\u00e2\u0080\u0094nay, there was a\ntenderness and a caress in his voice that made me wince.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it, just the same, for I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d promptly break Mr. Van Weyden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nneck.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen she has my permission to cry out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said defiantly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hardly think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll care to sacrifice the Dean of American Letters the\nSecond,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he sneered.\n\nWe spoke no more, though we had become too used to one another for the\nsilence to be awkward; and when the red light and the white had\ndisappeared we returned to the cabin to finish the interrupted supper.\n\nAgain they fell to quoting, and Maud gave Dowson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cImpenitentia Ultima.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nShe rendered it beautifully, but I watched not her, but Wolf Larsen.  I\nwas fascinated by the fascinated look he bent upon Maud.  He was quite\nout of himself, and I noticed the unconscious movement of his lips as he\nshaped word for word as fast as she uttered them.  He interrupted her\nwhen she gave the lines:\n\n   \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd her eyes should be my light while the sun went out behind me,\n   And the viols in her voice be the last sound in my ear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are viols in your voice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said bluntly, and his eyes flashed\ntheir golden light.\n\nI could have shouted with joy at her control.  She finished the\nconcluding stanza without faltering and then slowly guided the\nconversation into less perilous channels.  And all the while I sat in a\nhalf-daze, the drunken riot of the steerage breaking through the\nbulkhead, the man I feared and the woman I loved talking on and on.  The\ntable was not cleared.  The man who had taken Mugridge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s place had\nevidently joined his comrades in the forecastle.\n\nIf ever Wolf Larsen attained the summit of living, he attained it then.\nFrom time to time I forsook my own thoughts to follow him, and I followed\nin amaze, mastered for the moment by his remarkable intellect, under the\nspell of his passion, for he was preaching the passion of revolt.  It was\ninevitable that Milton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Lucifer should be instanced, and the keenness\nwith which Wolf Larsen analysed and depicted the character was a\nrevelation of his stifled genius.  It reminded me of Taine, yet I knew\nthe man had never heard of that brilliant though dangerous thinker.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe led a lost cause, and he was not afraid of God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thunderbolts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf\nLarsen was saying.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHurled into hell, he was unbeaten.  A third of God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nangels he had led with him, and straightway he incited man to rebel\nagainst God, and gained for himself and hell the major portion of all the\ngenerations of man.  Why was he beaten out of heaven?  Because he was\nless brave than God? less proud? less aspiring?  No!  A thousand times\nno!  God was more powerful, as he said, Whom thunder hath made greater.\nBut Lucifer was a free spirit.  To serve was to suffocate.  He preferred\nsuffering in freedom to all the happiness of a comfortable servility.  He\ndid not care to serve God.  He cared to serve nothing.  He was no\nfigure-head.  He stood on his own legs.  He was an individual.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe first Anarchist,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maud laughed, rising and preparing to withdraw to\nher state-room.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen it is good to be an anarchist!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried.  He, too, had risen, and\nhe stood facing her, where she had paused at the door of her room, as he\nwent on:\n\n               \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Here at least\n   We shall be free; the Almighty hath not built\n   Here for his envy; will not drive us hence;\n   Here we may reign secure; and in my choice\n   To reign is worth ambition, though in hell:\n   Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was the defiant cry of a mighty spirit.  The cabin still rang with his\nvoice, as he stood there, swaying, his bronzed face shining, his head up\nand dominant, and his eyes, golden and masculine, intensely masculine and\ninsistently soft, flashing upon Maud at the door.\n\nAgain that unnamable and unmistakable terror was in her eyes, and she\nsaid, almost in a whisper, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are Lucifer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe door closed and she was gone.  He stood staring after her for a\nminute, then returned to himself and to me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll relieve Louis at the wheel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said shortly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand call upon you to\nrelieve at midnight.  Better turn in now and get some sleep.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe pulled on a pair of mittens, put on his cap, and ascended the\ncompanion-stairs, while I followed his suggestion by going to bed.  For\nsome unknown reason, prompted mysteriously, I did not undress, but lay\ndown fully clothed.  For a time I listened to the clamour in the steerage\nand marvelled upon the love which had come to me; but my sleep on the\n_Ghost_ had become most healthful and natural, and soon the songs and\ncries died away, my eyes closed, and my consciousness sank down into the\nhalf-death of slumber.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\nI knew not what had aroused me, but I found myself out of my bunk, on my\nfeet, wide awake, my soul vibrating to the warning of danger as it might\nhave thrilled to a trumpet call.  I threw open the door.  The cabin light\nwas burning low.  I saw Maud, my Maud, straining and struggling and\ncrushed in the embrace of Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms.  I could see the vain beat\nand flutter of her as she strove, pressing her face against his breast,\nto escape from him.  All this I saw on the very instant of seeing and as\nI sprang forward.\n\nI struck him with my fist, on the face, as he raised his head, but it was\na puny blow.  He roared in a ferocious, animal-like way, and gave me a\nshove with his hand.  It was only a shove, a flirt of the wrist, yet so\ntremendous was his strength that I was hurled backward as from a\ncatapult.  I struck the door of the state-room which had formerly been\nMugridge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, splintering and smashing the panels with the impact of my\nbody.  I struggled to my feet, with difficulty dragging myself clear of\nthe wrecked door, unaware of any hurt whatever.  I was conscious only of\nan overmastering rage.  I think I, too, cried aloud, as I drew the knife\nat my hip and sprang forward a second time.\n\nBut something had happened.  They were reeling apart.  I was close upon\nhim, my knife uplifted, but I withheld the blow.  I was puzzled by the\nstrangeness of it.  Maud was leaning against the wall, one hand out for\nsupport; but he was staggering, his left hand pressed against his\nforehead and covering his eyes, and with the right he was groping about\nhim in a dazed sort of way.  It struck against the wall, and his body\nseemed to express a muscular and physical relief at the contact, as\nthough he had found his bearings, his location in space as well as\nsomething against which to lean.\n\nThen I saw red again.  All my wrongs and humiliations flashed upon me\nwith a dazzling brightness, all that I had suffered and others had\nsuffered at his hands, all the enormity of the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very existence.  I\nsprang upon him, blindly, insanely, and drove the knife into his\nshoulder.  I knew, then, that it was no more than a flesh wound,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I had\nfelt the steel grate on his shoulder-blade,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I raised the knife to\nstrike at a more vital part.\n\nBut Maud had seen my first blow, and she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t!  Please don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI dropped my arm for a moment, and a moment only.  Again the knife was\nraised, and Wolf Larsen would have surely died had she not stepped\nbetween.  Her arms were around me, her hair was brushing my face.  My\npulse rushed up in an unwonted manner, yet my rage mounted with it.  She\nlooked me bravely in the eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor my sake,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she begged.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would kill him for your sake!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried, trying to free my arm without\nhurting her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHush!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, and laid her fingers lightly on my lips.  I could have\nkissed them, had I dared, even then, in my rage, the touch of them was so\nsweet, so very sweet.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease, please,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she pleaded, and she disarmed me\nby the words, as I was to discover they would ever disarm me.\n\nI stepped back, separating from her, and replaced the knife in its\nsheath.  I looked at Wolf Larsen.  He still pressed his left hand against\nhis forehead.  It covered his eyes.  His head was bowed.  He seemed to\nhave grown limp.  His body was sagging at the hips, his great shoulders\nwere drooping and shrinking forward.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVan Weyden!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he called hoarsely, and with a note of fright in his\nvoice.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Van Weyden! where are you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI looked at Maud.  She did not speak, but nodded her head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere I am,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered, stepping to his side.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHelp me to a seat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, in the same hoarse, frightened voice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a sick man; a very sick man, Hump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, as he left my\nsustaining grip and sank into a chair.\n\nHis head dropped forward on the table and was buried in his hands.  From\ntime to time it rocked back and forward as with pain.  Once, when he half\nraised it, I saw the sweat standing in heavy drops on his forehead about\nthe roots of his hair.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a sick man, a very sick man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he repeated again, and yet once\nagain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked, resting my hand on his shoulder.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\ncan I do for you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut he shook my hand off with an irritated movement, and for a long time\nI stood by his side in silence.  Maud was looking on, her face awed and\nfrightened.  What had happened to him we could not imagine.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said at last, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must get into my bunk.  Lend me a hand.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nbe all right in a little while.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s those damn headaches, I believe.  I\nwas afraid of them.  I had a feeling\u00e2\u0080\u0094no, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking\nabout.  Help me into my bunk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut when I got him into his bunk he again buried his face in his hands,\ncovering his eyes, and as I turned to go I could hear him murmuring, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nam a sick man, a very sick man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMaud looked at me inquiringly as I emerged.  I shook my head, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSomething has happened to him.  What, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know.  He is helpless, and\nfrightened, I imagine, for the first time in his life.  It must have\noccurred before he received the knife-thrust, which made only a\nsuperficial wound.  You must have seen what happened.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe shook her head.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw nothing.  It is just as mysterious to me.  He\nsuddenly released me and staggered away.  But what shall we do?  What\nshall I do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you will wait, please, until I come back,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered.\n\nI went on deck.  Louis was at the wheel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may go for\u00e2\u0080\u0099ard and turn in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, taking it from him.\n\nHe was quick to obey, and I found myself alone on the deck of the\n_Ghost_.  As quietly as was possible, I clewed up the topsails, lowered\nthe flying jib and staysail, backed the jib over, and flattened the\nmainsail.  Then I went below to Maud.  I placed my finger on my lips for\nsilence, and entered Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room.  He was in the same position in\nwhich I had left him, and his head was rocking\u00e2\u0080\u0094almost writhing\u00e2\u0080\u0094from side\nto side.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnything I can do for you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\nHe made no reply at first, but on my repeating the question he answered,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m all right.  Leave me alone till morning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut as I turned to go I noted that his head had resumed its rocking\nmotion.  Maud was waiting patiently for me, and I took notice, with a\nthrill of joy, of the queenly poise of her head and her glorious, calm\neyes.  Calm and sure they were as her spirit itself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you trust yourself to me for a journey of six hundred miles or so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nI asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mean\u00e2\u0080\u0094?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked, and I knew she had guessed aright.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I mean just that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is nothing left for us but\nthe open boat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor me, you mean,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are certainly as safe here as you\nhave been.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, there is nothing left for us but the open boat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I iterated stoutly.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you please dress as warmly as you can, at once, and make into a\nbundle whatever you wish to bring with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd make all haste,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I added, as she turned toward her state-room.\n\nThe lazarette was directly beneath the cabin, and, opening the trap-door\nin the floor and carrying a candle with me, I dropped down and began\noverhauling the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stores.  I selected mainly from the canned goods,\nand by the time I was ready, willing hands were extended from above to\nreceive what I passed up.\n\nWe worked in silence.  I helped myself also to blankets, mittens,\noilskins, caps, and such things, from the slop-chest.  It was no light\nadventure, this trusting ourselves in a small boat to so raw and stormy a\nsea, and it was imperative that we should guard ourselves against the\ncold and wet.\n\nWe worked feverishly at carrying our plunder on deck and depositing it\namidships, so feverishly that Maud, whose strength was hardly a positive\nquantity, had to give over, exhausted, and sit on the steps at the break\nof the poop.  This did not serve to recover her, and she lay on her back,\non the hard deck, arms stretched out, and whole body relaxed.  It was a\ntrick I remembered of my sister, and I knew she would soon be herself\nagain.  I knew, also, that weapons would not come in amiss, and I\nre-entered Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s state-room to get his rifle and shot-gun.  I\nspoke to him, but he made no answer, though his head was still rocking\nfrom side to side and he was not asleep.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-bye, Lucifer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I whispered to myself as I softly closed the door.\n\nNext to obtain was a stock of ammunition,\u00e2\u0080\u0094an easy matter, though I had to\nenter the steerage companion-way to do it.  Here the hunters stored the\nammunition-boxes they carried in the boats, and here, but a few feet from\ntheir noisy revels, I took possession of two boxes.\n\nNext, to lower a boat.  Not so simple a task for one man.  Having cast\noff the lashings, I hoisted first on the forward tackle, then on the aft,\ntill the boat cleared the rail, when I lowered away, one tackle and then\nthe other, for a couple of feet, till it hung snugly, above the water,\nagainst the schooner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side.  I made certain that it contained the proper\nequipment of oars, rowlocks, and sail.  Water was a consideration, and I\nrobbed every boat aboard of its breaker.  As there were nine boats all\ntold, it meant that we should have plenty of water, and ballast as well,\nthough there was the chance that the boat would be overloaded, what of\nthe generous supply of other things I was taking.\n\nWhile Maud was passing me the provisions and I was storing them in the\nboat, a sailor came on deck from the forecastle.  He stood by the weather\nrail for a time (we were lowering over the lee rail), and then sauntered\nslowly amidships, where he again paused and stood facing the wind, with\nhis back toward us.  I could hear my heart beating as I crouched low in\nthe boat.  Maud had sunk down upon the deck and was, I knew, lying\nmotionless, her body in the shadow of the bulwark.  But the man never\nturned, and, after stretching his arms above his head and yawning\naudibly, he retraced his steps to the forecastle scuttle and disappeared.\n\nA few minutes sufficed to finish the loading, and I lowered the boat into\nthe water.  As I helped Maud over the rail and felt her form close to\nmine, it was all I could do to keep from crying out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI love you!  I love\nyou!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Truly Humphrey Van Weyden was at last in love, I thought, as her\nfingers clung to mine while I lowered her down to the boat.  I held on to\nthe rail with one hand and supported her weight with the other, and I was\nproud at the moment of the feat.  It was a strength I had not possessed a\nfew months before, on the day I said good-bye to Charley Furuseth and\nstarted for San Francisco on the ill-fated _Martinez_.\n\nAs the boat ascended on a sea, her feet touched and I released her hands.\nI cast off the tackles and leaped after her.  I had never rowed in my\nlife, but I put out the oars and at the expense of much effort got the\nboat clear of the _Ghost_.  Then I experimented with the sail.  I had\nseen the boat-steerers and hunters set their spritsails many times, yet\nthis was my first attempt.  What took them possibly two minutes took me\ntwenty, but in the end I succeeded in setting and trimming it, and with\nthe steering-oar in my hands hauled on the wind.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere lies Japan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I remarked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cstraight before us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHumphrey Van Weyden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are a brave man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is you who are a brave woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe turned our heads, swayed by a common impulse to see the last of the\n_Ghost_.  Her low hull lifted and rolled to windward on a sea; her canvas\nloomed darkly in the night; her lashed wheel creaked as the rudder\nkicked; then sight and sound of her faded away, and we were alone on the\ndark sea.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n\nDay broke, grey and chill.  The boat was close-hauled on a fresh breeze\nand the compass indicated that we were just making the course which would\nbring us to Japan.  Though stoutly mittened, my fingers were cold, and\nthey pained from the grip on the steering-oar.  My feet were stinging\nfrom the bite of the frost, and I hoped fervently that the sun would\nshine.\n\nBefore me, in the bottom of the boat, lay Maud.  She, at least, was warm,\nfor under her and over her were thick blankets.  The top one I had drawn\nover her face to shelter it from the night, so I could see nothing but\nthe vague shape of her, and her light-brown hair, escaped from the\ncovering and jewelled with moisture from the air.\n\nLong I looked at her, dwelling upon that one visible bit of her as only a\nman would who deemed it the most precious thing in the world.  So\ninsistent was my gaze that at last she stirred under the blankets, the\ntop fold was thrown back and she smiled out on me, her eyes yet heavy\nwith sleep.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-morning, Mr. Van Weyden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you sighted land yet?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut we are approaching it at a rate of six miles an\nhour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe made a _mou\u00c3\u00a8_ of disappointment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut that is equivalent to one hundred and forty-four miles in\ntwenty-four hours,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I added reassuringly.\n\nHer face brightened.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd how far have we to go?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSiberia lies off there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, pointing to the west.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut to the\nsouth-west, some six hundred miles, is Japan.  If this wind should hold,\nwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make it in five days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if it storms?  The boat could not live?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe had a way of looking one in the eyes and demanding the truth, and\nthus she looked at me as she asked the question.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would have to storm very hard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I temporized.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if it storms very hard?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI nodded my head.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut we may be picked up any moment by a\nsealing-schooner.  They are plentifully distributed over this part of the\nocean.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, you are chilled through!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook!  You are shivering.\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deny it; you are.  And here I have been lying warm as toast.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see that it would help matters if you, too, sat up and were\nchilled,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I laughed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will, though, when I learn to steer, which I certainly shall.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe sat up and began making her simple toilet.  She shook down her hair,\nand it fell about her in a brown cloud, hiding her face and shoulders.\nDear, damp brown hair!  I wanted to kiss it, to ripple it through my\nfingers, to bury my face in it.  I gazed entranced, till the boat ran\ninto the wind and the flapping sail warned me I was not attending to my\nduties.  Idealist and romanticist that I was and always had been in spite\nof my analytical nature, yet I had failed till now in grasping much of\nthe physical characteristics of love.  The love of man and woman, I had\nalways held, was a sublimated something related to spirit, a spiritual\nbond that linked and drew their souls together.  The bonds of the flesh\nhad little part in my cosmos of love.  But I was learning the sweet\nlesson for myself that the soul transmuted itself, expressed itself,\nthrough the flesh; that the sight and sense and touch of the loved one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhair was as much breath and voice and essence of the spirit as the light\nthat shone from the eyes and the thoughts that fell from the lips.  After\nall, pure spirit was unknowable, a thing to be sensed and divined only;\nnor could it express itself in terms of itself.  Jehovah was\nanthropomorphic because he could address himself to the Jews only in\nterms of their understanding; so he was conceived as in their own image,\nas a cloud, a pillar of fire, a tangible, physical something which the\nmind of the Israelites could grasp.\n\nAnd so I gazed upon Maud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s light-brown hair, and loved it, and learned\nmore of love than all the poets and singers had taught me with all their\nsongs and sonnets.  She flung it back with a sudden adroit movement, and\nher face emerged, smiling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t women wear their hair down always?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is so much\nmore beautiful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tangle so dreadfully,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she laughed.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere!  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lost one\nof my precious hair-pins!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI neglected the boat and had the sail spilling the wind again and again,\nsuch was my delight in following her every movement as she searched\nthrough the blankets for the pin.  I was surprised, and joyfully, that\nshe was so much the woman, and the display of each trait and mannerism\nthat was characteristically feminine gave me keener joy.  For I had been\nelevating her too highly in my concepts of her, removing her too far from\nthe plane of the human, and too far from me.  I had been making of her a\ncreature goddess-like and unapproachable.  So I hailed with delight the\nlittle traits that proclaimed her only woman after all, such as the toss\nof the head which flung back the cloud of hair, and the search for the\npin.  She was woman, my kind, on my plane, and the delightful intimacy of\nkind, of man and woman, was possible, as well as the reverence and awe in\nwhich I knew I should always hold her.\n\nShe found the pin with an adorable little cry, and I turned my attention\nmore fully to my steering.  I proceeded to experiment, lashing and\nwedging the steering-oar until the boat held on fairly well by the wind\nwithout my assistance.  Occasionally it came up too close, or fell off\ntoo freely; but it always recovered itself and in the main behaved\nsatisfactorily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now we shall have breakfast,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut first you must be more\nwarmly clad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI got out a heavy shirt, new from the slop-chest and made from blanket\ngoods.  I knew the kind, so thick and so close of texture that it could\nresist the rain and not be soaked through after hours of wetting.  When\nshe had slipped this on over her head, I exchanged the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cap she wore\nfor a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cap, large enough to cover her hair, and, when the flap was\nturned down, to completely cover her neck and ears.  The effect was\ncharming.  Her face was of the sort that cannot but look well under all\ncircumstances.  Nothing could destroy its exquisite oval, its well-nigh\nclassic lines, its delicately stencilled brows, its large brown eyes,\nclear-seeing and calm, gloriously calm.\n\nA puff, slightly stronger than usual, struck us just then.  The boat was\ncaught as it obliquely crossed the crest of a wave.  It went over\nsuddenly, burying its gunwale level with the sea and shipping a bucketful\nor so of water.  I was opening a can of tongue at the moment, and I\nsprang to the sheet and cast it off just in time.  The sail flapped and\nfluttered, and the boat paid off.  A few minutes of regulating sufficed\nto put it on its course again, when I returned to the preparation of\nbreakfast.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt does very well, it seems, though I am not versed in things nautical,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nshe said, nodding her head with grave approval at my steering\ncontrivance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it will serve only when we are sailing by the wind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I explained.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen running more freely, with the wind astern abeam, or on the quarter,\nit will be necessary for me to steer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must say I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand your technicalities,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I do\nyour conclusion, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like it.  You cannot steer night and day and\nfor ever.  So I shall expect, after breakfast, to receive my first\nlesson.  And then you shall lie down and sleep.  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stand watches just\nas they do on ships.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see how I am to teach you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I made protest.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am just learning\nfor myself.  You little thought when you trusted yourself to me that I\nhad had no experience whatever with small boats.  This is the first time\nI have ever been in one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll learn together, sir.  And since you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had a night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start\nyou shall teach me what you have learned.  And now, breakfast.  My! this\nair does give one an appetite!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo coffee,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said regretfully, passing her buttered sea-biscuits and a\nslice of canned tongue.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd there will be no tea, no soups, nothing\nhot, till we have made land somewhere, somehow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfter the simple breakfast, capped with a cup of cold water, Maud took\nher lesson in steering.  In teaching her I learned quite a deal myself,\nthough I was applying the knowledge already acquired by sailing the\n_Ghost_ and by watching the boat-steerers sail the small boats.  She was\nan apt pupil, and soon learned to keep the course, to luff in the puffs\nand to cast off the sheet in an emergency.\n\nHaving grown tired, apparently, of the task, she relinquished the oar to\nme.  I had folded up the blankets, but she now proceeded to spread them\nout on the bottom.  When all was arranged snugly, she said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, sir, to bed.  And you shall sleep until luncheon.  Till\ndinner-time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she corrected, remembering the arrangement on the _Ghost_.\n\nWhat could I do?  She insisted, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease, please,\u00e2\u0080\u009d whereupon I\nturned the oar over to her and obeyed.  I experienced a positive sensuous\ndelight as I crawled into the bed she had made with her hands.  The calm\nand control which were so much a part of her seemed to have been\ncommunicated to the blankets, so that I was aware of a soft dreaminess\nand content, and of an oval face and brown eyes framed in a fisherman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncap and tossing against a background now of grey cloud, now of grey sea,\nand then I was aware that I had been asleep.\n\nI looked at my watch.  It was one o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock.  I had slept seven hours!  And\nshe had been steering seven hours!  When I took the steering-oar I had\nfirst to unbend her cramped fingers.  Her modicum of strength had been\nexhausted, and she was unable even to move from her position.  I was\ncompelled to let go the sheet while I helped her to the nest of blankets\nand chafed her hands and arms.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am so tired,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, with a quick intake of the breath and a sigh,\ndrooping her head wearily.\n\nBut she straightened it the next moment.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t scold, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you\ndare scold,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried with mock defiance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope my face does not appear angry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered seriously; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I\nassure you I am not in the least angry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cN-no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she considered.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt looks only reproachful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen it is an honest face, for it looks what I feel.  You were not fair\nto yourself, nor to me.  How can I ever trust you again?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe looked penitent.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, as a naughty child might\nsay it.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI promise\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo obey as a sailor would obey his captain?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was stupid of me, I know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you must promise something else,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I ventured.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReadily.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat you will not say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Please, please,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 too often; for when you do you\nare sure to override my authority.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe laughed with amused appreciation.  She, too, had noticed the power of\nthe repeated \u00e2\u0080\u009cplease.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a good word\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d I began.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I must not overwork it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she broke in.\n\nBut she laughed weakly, and her head drooped again.  I left the oar long\nenough to tuck the blankets about her feet and to pull a single fold\nacross her face.  Alas! she was not strong.  I looked with misgiving\ntoward the south-west and thought of the six hundred miles of hardship\nbefore us\u00e2\u0080\u0094ay, if it were no worse than hardship.  On this sea a storm\nmight blow up at any moment and destroy us.  And yet I was unafraid.  I\nwas without confidence in the future, extremely doubtful, and yet I felt\nno underlying fear.  It must come right, it must come right, I repeated\nto myself, over and over again.\n\nThe wind freshened in the afternoon, raising a stiffer sea and trying the\nboat and me severely.  But the supply of food and the nine breakers of\nwater enabled the boat to stand up to the sea and wind, and I held on as\nlong as I dared.  Then I removed the sprit, tightly hauling down the peak\nof the sail, and we raced along under what sailors call a leg-of-mutton.\n\nLate in the afternoon I sighted a steamer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smoke on the horizon to\nleeward, and I knew it either for a Russian cruiser, or, more likely, the\n_Macedonia_ still seeking the _Ghost_.  The sun had not shone all day,\nand it had been bitter cold.  As night drew on, the clouds darkened and\nthe wind freshened, so that when Maud and I ate supper it was with our\nmittens on and with me still steering and eating morsels between puffs.\n\nBy the time it was dark, wind and sea had become too strong for the boat,\nand I reluctantly took in the sail and set about making a drag or\nsea-anchor.  I had learned of the device from the talk of the hunters,\nand it was a simple thing to manufacture.  Furling the sail and lashing\nit securely about the mast, boom, sprit, and two pairs of spare oars, I\nthrew it overboard.  A line connected it with the bow, and as it floated\nlow in the water, practically unexposed to the wind, it drifted less\nrapidly than the boat.  In consequence it held the boat bow on to the sea\nand wind\u00e2\u0080\u0094the safest position in which to escape being swamped when the\nsea is breaking into whitecaps.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maud asked cheerfully, when the task was accomplished and I\npulled on my mittens.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now we are no longer travelling toward Japan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur\ndrift is to the south-east, or south-south-east, at the rate of at least\ntwo miles an hour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat will be only twenty-four miles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she urged, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif the wind remains\nhigh all night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, and only one hundred and forty miles if it continues for three days\nand nights.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t continue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said with easy confidence.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will turn\naround and blow fair.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe sea is the great faithless one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the wind!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she retorted.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have heard you grow eloquent over the\nbrave trade-wind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish I had thought to bring Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chronometer and sextant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\nsaid, still gloomily.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSailing one direction, drifting another\ndirection, to say nothing of the set of the current in some third\ndirection, makes a resultant which dead reckoning can never calculate.\nBefore long we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where we are by five hundred miles.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen I begged her pardon and promised I should not be disheartened any\nmore.  At her solicitation I let her take the watch till midnight,\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was\nthen nine o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, but I wrapped her in blankets and put an oilskin about\nher before I lay down.  I slept only cat-naps.  The boat was leaping and\npounding as it fell over the crests, I could hear the seas rushing past,\nand spray was continually being thrown aboard.  And still, it was not a\nbad night, I mused\u00e2\u0080\u0094nothing to the nights I had been through on the\n_Ghost_; nothing, perhaps, to the nights we should go through in this\ncockle-shell.  Its planking was three-quarters of an inch thick.  Between\nus and the bottom of the sea was less than an inch of wood.\n\nAnd yet, I aver it, and I aver it again, I was unafraid.  The death which\nWolf Larsen and even Thomas Mugridge had made me fear, I no longer\nfeared.  The coming of Maud Brewster into my life seemed to have\ntransformed me.  After all, I thought, it is better and finer to love\nthan to be loved, if it makes something in life so worth while that one\nis not loath to die for it.  I forget my own life in the love of another\nlife; and yet, such is the paradox, I never wanted so much to live as\nright now when I place the least value upon my own life.  I never had so\nmuch reason for living, was my concluding thought; and after that, until\nI dozed, I contented myself with trying to pierce the darkness to where I\nknew Maud crouched low in the stern-sheets, watchful of the foaming sea\nand ready to call me on an instant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s notice.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n\nThere is no need of going into an extended recital of our suffering in\nthe small boat during the many days we were driven and drifted, here and\nthere, willy-nilly, across the ocean.  The high wind blew from the\nnorth-west for twenty-four hours, when it fell calm, and in the night\nsprang up from the south-west.  This was dead in our teeth, but I took in\nthe sea-anchor and set sail, hauling a course on the wind which took us\nin a south-south-easterly direction.  It was an even choice between this\nand the west-north-westerly course which the wind permitted; but the warm\nairs of the south fanned my desire for a warmer sea and swayed my\ndecision.\n\nIn three hours\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was midnight, I well remember, and as dark as I had\never seen it on the sea\u00e2\u0080\u0094the wind, still blowing out of the south-west,\nrose furiously, and once again I was compelled to set the sea-anchor.\n\nDay broke and found me wan-eyed and the ocean lashed white, the boat\npitching, almost on end, to its drag.  We were in imminent danger of\nbeing swamped by the whitecaps.  As it was, spray and spume came aboard\nin such quantities that I bailed without cessation.  The blankets were\nsoaking.  Everything was wet except Maud, and she, in oilskins, rubber\nboots, and sou\u00e2\u0080\u0099wester, was dry, all but her face and hands and a stray\nwisp of hair.  She relieved me at the bailing-hole from time to time, and\nbravely she threw out the water and faced the storm.  All things are\nrelative.  It was no more than a stiff blow, but to us, fighting for life\nin our frail craft, it was indeed a storm.\n\nCold and cheerless, the wind beating on our faces, the white seas roaring\nby, we struggled through the day.  Night came, but neither of us slept.\nDay came, and still the wind beat on our faces and the white seas roared\npast.  By the second night Maud was falling asleep from exhaustion.  I\ncovered her with oilskins and a tarpaulin.  She was comparatively dry,\nbut she was numb with the cold.  I feared greatly that she might die in\nthe night; but day broke, cold and cheerless, with the same clouded sky\nand beating wind and roaring seas.\n\nI had had no sleep for forty-eight hours.  I was wet and chilled to the\nmarrow, till I felt more dead than alive.  My body was stiff from\nexertion as well as from cold, and my aching muscles gave me the severest\ntorture whenever I used them, and I used them continually.  And all the\ntime we were being driven off into the north-east, directly away from\nJapan and toward bleak Bering Sea.\n\nAnd still we lived, and the boat lived, and the wind blew unabated.  In\nfact, toward nightfall of the third day it increased a trifle and\nsomething more.  The boat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bow plunged under a crest, and we came\nthrough quarter-full of water.  I bailed like a madman.  The liability of\nshipping another such sea was enormously increased by the water that\nweighed the boat down and robbed it of its buoyancy.  And another such\nsea meant the end.  When I had the boat empty again I was forced to take\naway the tarpaulin which covered Maud, in order that I might lash it down\nacross the bow.  It was well I did, for it covered the boat fully a third\nof the way aft, and three times, in the next several hours, it flung off\nthe bulk of the down-rushing water when the bow shoved under the seas.\n\nMaud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s condition was pitiable.  She sat crouched in the bottom of the\nboat, her lips blue, her face grey and plainly showing the pain she\nsuffered.  But ever her eyes looked bravely at me, and ever her lips\nuttered brave words.\n\nThe worst of the storm must have blown that night, though little I\nnoticed it.  I had succumbed and slept where I sat in the stern-sheets.\nThe morning of the fourth day found the wind diminished to a gentle\nwhisper, the sea dying down and the sun shining upon us.  Oh, the blessed\nsun!  How we bathed our poor bodies in its delicious warmth, reviving\nlike bugs and crawling things after a storm.  We smiled again, said\namusing things, and waxed optimistic over our situation.  Yet it was, if\nanything, worse than ever.  We were farther from Japan than the night we\nleft the _Ghost_.  Nor could I more than roughly guess our latitude and\nlongitude.  At a calculation of a two-mile drift per hour, during the\nseventy and odd hours of the storm, we had been driven at least one\nhundred and fifty miles to the north-east.  But was such calculated drift\ncorrect?  For all I knew, it might have been four miles per hour instead\nof two.  In which case we were another hundred and fifty miles to the\nbad.\n\nWhere we were I did not know, though there was quite a likelihood that we\nwere in the vicinity of the _Ghost_.  There were seals about us, and I\nwas prepared to sight a sealing-schooner at any time.  We did sight one,\nin the afternoon, when the north-west breeze had sprung up freshly once\nmore.  But the strange schooner lost itself on the sky-line and we alone\noccupied the circle of the sea.\n\nCame days of fog, when even Maud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spirit drooped and there were no merry\nwords upon her lips; days of calm, when we floated on the lonely\nimmensity of sea, oppressed by its greatness and yet marvelling at the\nmiracle of tiny life, for we still lived and struggled to live; days of\nsleet and wind and snow-squalls, when nothing could keep us warm; or days\nof drizzling rain, when we filled our water-breakers from the drip of the\nwet sail.\n\nAnd ever I loved Maud with an increasing love.  She was so many-sided, so\nmany-mooded\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cprotean-mooded\u00e2\u0080\u009d I called her.  But I called her this, and\nother and dearer things, in my thoughts only.  Though the declaration of\nmy love urged and trembled on my tongue a thousand times, I knew that it\nwas no time for such a declaration.  If for no other reason, it was no\ntime, when one was protecting and trying to save a woman, to ask that\nwoman for her love.  Delicate as was the situation, not alone in this but\nin other ways, I flattered myself that I was able to deal delicately with\nit; and also I flattered myself that by look or sign I gave no\nadvertisement of the love I felt for her.  We were like good comrades,\nand we grew better comrades as the days went by.\n\nOne thing about her which surprised me was her lack of timidity and fear.\nThe terrible sea, the frail boat, the storms, the suffering, the\nstrangeness and isolation of the situation,\u00e2\u0080\u0094all that should have\nfrightened a robust woman,\u00e2\u0080\u0094seemed to make no impression upon her who had\nknown life only in its most sheltered and consummately artificial\naspects, and who was herself all fire and dew and mist, sublimated\nspirit, all that was soft and tender and clinging in woman.  And yet I am\nwrong.  She _was_ timid and afraid, but she possessed courage.  The flesh\nand the qualms of the flesh she was heir to, but the flesh bore heavily\nonly on the flesh.  And she was spirit, first and always spirit,\netherealized essence of life, calm as her calm eyes, and sure of\npermanence in the changing order of the universe.\n\nCame days of storm, days and nights of storm, when the ocean menaced us\nwith its roaring whiteness, and the wind smote our struggling boat with a\nTitan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s buffets.  And ever we were flung off, farther and farther, to the\nnorth-east.  It was in such a storm, and the worst that we had\nexperienced, that I cast a weary glance to leeward, not in quest of\nanything, but more from the weariness of facing the elemental strife, and\nin mute appeal, almost, to the wrathful powers to cease and let us be.\nWhat I saw I could not at first believe.  Days and nights of\nsleeplessness and anxiety had doubtless turned my head.  I looked back at\nMaud, to identify myself, as it were, in time and space.  The sight of\nher dear wet cheeks, her flying hair, and her brave brown eyes convinced\nme that my vision was still healthy.  Again I turned my face to leeward,\nand again I saw the jutting promontory, black and high and naked, the\nraging surf that broke about its base and beat its front high up with\nspouting fountains, the black and forbidden coast-line running toward the\nsouth-east and fringed with a tremendous scarf of white.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaud,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaud.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe turned her head and beheld the sight.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt cannot be Alaska!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered, and asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan you swim?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNeither can I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo we must get ashore without swimming, in\nsome opening between the rocks through which we can drive the boat and\nclamber out.  But we must be quick, most quick\u00e2\u0080\u0094and sure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI spoke with a confidence she knew I did not feel, for she looked at me\nwith that unfaltering gaze of hers and said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have not thanked you yet for all you have done for me but\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe hesitated, as if in doubt how best to word her gratitude.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, brutally, for I was not quite pleased with her thanking\nme.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou might help me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she smiled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo acknowledge your obligations before you die?  Not at all.  We are not\ngoing to die.  We shall land on that island, and we shall be snug and\nsheltered before the day is done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI spoke stoutly, but I did not believe a word.  Nor was I prompted to lie\nthrough fear.  I felt no fear, though I was sure of death in that boiling\nsurge amongst the rocks which was rapidly growing nearer.  It was\nimpossible to hoist sail and claw off that shore.  The wind would\ninstantly capsize the boat; the seas would swamp it the moment it fell\ninto the trough; and, besides, the sail, lashed to the spare oars,\ndragged in the sea ahead of us.\n\nAs I say, I was not afraid to meet my own death, there, a few hundred\nyards to leeward; but I was appalled at the thought that Maud must die.\nMy cursed imagination saw her beaten and mangled against the rocks, and\nit was too terrible.  I strove to compel myself to think we would make\nthe landing safely, and so I spoke, not what I believed, but what I\npreferred to believe.\n\nI recoiled before contemplation of that frightful death, and for a moment\nI entertained the wild idea of seizing Maud in my arms and leaping\noverboard.  Then I resolved to wait, and at the last moment, when we\nentered on the final stretch, to take her in my arms and proclaim my\nlove, and, with her in my embrace, to make the desperate struggle and\ndie.\n\nInstinctively we drew closer together in the bottom of the boat.  I felt\nher mittened hand come out to mine.  And thus, without speech, we waited\nthe end.  We were not far off the line the wind made with the western\nedge of the promontory, and I watched in the hope that some set of the\ncurrent or send of the sea would drift us past before we reached the\nsurf.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe shall go clear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, with a confidence which I knew deceived\nneither of us.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy God, we _will_ go clear!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried, five minutes later.\n\nThe oath left my lips in my excitement\u00e2\u0080\u0094the first, I do believe, in my\nlife, unless \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrouble it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d an expletive of my youth, be accounted an\noath.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI beg your pardon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have convinced me of your sincerity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, with a faint smile.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do know, now, that we shall go clear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI had seen a distant headland past the extreme edge of the promontory,\nand as we looked we could see grow the intervening coastline of what was\nevidently a deep cove.  At the same time there broke upon our ears a\ncontinuous and mighty bellowing.  It partook of the magnitude and volume\nof distant thunder, and it came to us directly from leeward, rising above\nthe crash of the surf and travelling directly in the teeth of the storm.\nAs we passed the point the whole cove burst upon our view, a half-moon of\nwhite sandy beach upon which broke a huge surf, and which was covered\nwith myriads of seals.  It was from them that the great bellowing went\nup.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA rookery!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow are we indeed saved.  There must be men and\ncruisers to protect them from the seal-hunters.  Possibly there is a\nstation ashore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut as I studied the surf which beat upon the beach, I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cStill bad,\nbut not so bad.  And now, if the gods be truly kind, we shall drift by\nthat next headland and come upon a perfectly sheltered beach, where we\nmay land without wetting our feet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd the gods were kind.  The first and second headlands were directly in\nline with the south-west wind; but once around the second,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and we went\nperilously near,\u00e2\u0080\u0094we picked up the third headland, still in line with the\nwind and with the other two.  But the cove that intervened!  It\npenetrated deep into the land, and the tide, setting in, drifted us under\nthe shelter of the point.  Here the sea was calm, save for a heavy but\nsmooth ground-swell, and I took in the sea-anchor and began to row.  From\nthe point the shore curved away, more and more to the south and west,\nuntil at last it disclosed a cove within the cove, a little land-locked\nharbour, the water level as a pond, broken only by tiny ripples where\nvagrant breaths and wisps of the storm hurtled down from over the\nfrowning wall of rock that backed the beach a hundred feet inshore.\n\nHere were no seals whatever.  The boat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stern touched the hard shingle.\nI sprang out, extending my hand to Maud.  The next moment she was beside\nme.  As my fingers released hers, she clutched for my arm hastily.  At\nthe same moment I swayed, as about to fall to the sand.  This was the\nstartling effect of the cessation of motion.  We had been so long upon\nthe moving, rocking sea that the stable land was a shock to us.  We\nexpected the beach to lift up this way and that, and the rocky walls to\nswing back and forth like the sides of a ship; and when we braced\nourselves, automatically, for these various expected movements, their\nnon-occurrence quite overcame our equilibrium.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI really must sit down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maud said, with a nervous laugh and a dizzy\ngesture, and forthwith she sat down on the sand.\n\nI attended to making the boat secure and joined her.  Thus we landed on\nEndeavour Island, as we came to it, land-sick from long custom of the\nsea.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFool!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried aloud in my vexation.\n\nI had unloaded the boat and carried its contents high up on the beach,\nwhere I had set about making a camp.  There was driftwood, though not\nmuch, on the beach, and the sight of a coffee tin I had taken from the\n_Ghost\u00e2\u0080\u0099s_ larder had given me the idea of a fire.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBlithering idiot!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was continuing.\n\nBut Maud said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTut, tut,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in gentle reproval, and then asked why I was a\nblithering idiot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo matches,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I groaned.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a match did I bring.  And now we shall\nhave no hot coffee, soup, tea, or anything!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it\u00e2\u0080\u0094er\u00e2\u0080\u0094Crusoe who rubbed sticks together?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she drawled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I have read the personal narratives of a score of shipwrecked men\nwho tried, and tried in vain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI remember Winters, a\nnewspaper fellow with an Alaskan and Siberian reputation.  Met him at the\nBibelot once, and he was telling us how he attempted to make a fire with\na couple of sticks.  It was most amusing.  He told it inimitably, but it\nwas the story of a failure.  I remember his conclusion, his black eyes\nflashing as he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Gentlemen, the South Sea Islander may do it, the\nMalay may do it, but take my word it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beyond the white man.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, well, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve managed so far without it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said cheerfully.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd\nthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no reason why we cannot still manage without it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut think of the coffee!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good coffee, too, I know.  I\ntook it from Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s private stores.  And look at that good wood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI confess, I wanted the coffee badly; and I learned, not long afterward,\nthat the berry was likewise a little weakness of Maud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  Besides, we had\nbeen so long on a cold diet that we were numb inside as well as out.\nAnything warm would have been most gratifying.  But I complained no more\nand set about making a tent of the sail for Maud.\n\nI had looked upon it as a simple task, what of the oars, mast, boom, and\nsprit, to say nothing of plenty of lines.  But as I was without\nexperience, and as every detail was an experiment and every successful\ndetail an invention, the day was well gone before her shelter was an\naccomplished fact.  And then, that night, it rained, and she was flooded\nout and driven back into the boat.\n\nThe next morning I dug a shallow ditch around the tent, and, an hour\nlater, a sudden gust of wind, whipping over the rocky wall behind us,\npicked up the tent and smashed it down on the sand thirty yards away.\n\nMaud laughed at my crestfallen expression, and I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs soon as the\nwind abates I intend going in the boat to explore the island.  There must\nbe a station somewhere, and men.  And ships must visit the station.  Some\nGovernment must protect all these seals.  But I wish to have you\ncomfortable before I start.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should like to go with you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was all she said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would be better if you remained.  You have had enough of hardship.\nIt is a miracle that you have survived.  And it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be comfortable in\nthe boat rowing and sailing in this rainy weather.  What you need is\nrest, and I should like you to remain and get it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSomething suspiciously akin to moistness dimmed her beautiful eyes before\nshe dropped them and partly turned away her head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should prefer going with you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said in a low voice, in which there\nwas just a hint of appeal.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI might be able to help you a\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d her voice broke,\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009ca little.  And if\nanything should happen to you, think of me left here alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I intend being very careful,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I shall not go so\nfar but what I can get back before night.  Yes, all said and done, I\nthink it vastly better for you to remain, and sleep, and rest and do\nnothing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe turned and looked me in the eyes.  Her gaze was unfaltering, but\nsoft.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease, please,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, oh, so softly.\n\nI stiffened myself to refuse, and shook my head.  Still she waited and\nlooked at me.  I tried to word my refusal, but wavered.  I saw the glad\nlight spring into her eyes and knew that I had lost.  It was impossible\nto say no after that.\n\nThe wind died down in the afternoon, and we were prepared to start the\nfollowing morning.  There was no way of penetrating the island from our\ncove, for the walls rose perpendicularly from the beach, and, on either\nside of the cove, rose from the deep water.\n\nMorning broke dull and grey, but calm, and I was awake early and had the\nboat in readiness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFool!  Imbecile!  Yahoo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I shouted, when I thought it was meet to\narouse Maud; but this time I shouted in merriment as I danced about the\nbeach, bareheaded, in mock despair.\n\nHer head appeared under the flap of the sail.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked sleepily, and, withal, curiously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCoffee!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you say to a cup of coffee? hot coffee?\npiping hot?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she murmured, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou startled me, and you are cruel.  Here I have\nbeen composing my soul to do without it, and here you are vexing me with\nyour vain suggestions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWatch me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\nFrom under clefts among the rocks I gathered a few dry sticks and chips.\nThese I whittled into shavings or split into kindling.  From my note-book\nI tore out a page, and from the ammunition box took a shot-gun shell.\nRemoving the wads from the latter with my knife, I emptied the powder on\na flat rock.  Next I pried the primer, or cap, from the shell, and laid\nit on the rock, in the midst of the scattered powder.  All was ready.\nMaud still watched from the tent.  Holding the paper in my left hand, I\nsmashed down upon the cap with a rock held in my right.  There was a puff\nof white smoke, a burst of flame, and the rough edge of the paper was\nalight.\n\nMaud clapped her hands gleefully.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cPrometheus!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.\n\nBut I was too occupied to acknowledge her delight.  The feeble flame must\nbe cherished tenderly if it were to gather strength and live.  I fed it,\nshaving by shaving, and sliver by sliver, till at last it was snapping\nand crackling as it laid hold of the smaller chips and sticks.  To be\ncast away on an island had not entered into my calculations, so we were\nwithout a kettle or cooking utensils of any sort; but I made shift with\nthe tin used for bailing the boat, and later, as we consumed our supply\nof canned goods, we accumulated quite an imposing array of cooking\nvessels.\n\nI boiled the water, but it was Maud who made the coffee.  And how good it\nwas!  My contribution was canned beef fried with crumbled sea-biscuit and\nwater.  The breakfast was a success, and we sat about the fire much\nlonger than enterprising explorers should have done, sipping the hot\nblack coffee and talking over our situation.\n\nI was confident that we should find a station in some one of the coves,\nfor I knew that the rookeries of Bering Sea were thus guarded; but Maud\nadvanced the theory\u00e2\u0080\u0094to prepare me for disappointment, I do believe, if\ndisappointment were to come\u00e2\u0080\u0094that we had discovered an unknown rookery.\nShe was in very good spirits, however, and made quite merry in accepting\nour plight as a grave one.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you are right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthen we must prepare to winter here.  Our\nfood will not last, but there are the seals.  They go away in the fall,\nso I must soon begin to lay in a supply of meat.  Then there will be huts\nto build and driftwood to gather.  Also we shall try out seal fat for\nlighting purposes.  Altogether, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have our hands full if we find the\nisland uninhabited.  Which we shall not, I know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut she was right.  We sailed with a beam wind along the shore, searching\nthe coves with our glasses and landing occasionally, without finding a\nsign of human life.  Yet we learned that we were not the first who had\nlanded on Endeavour Island.  High up on the beach of the second cove from\nours, we discovered the splintered wreck of a boat\u00e2\u0080\u0094a sealer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boat, for\nthe rowlocks were bound in sennit, a gun-rack was on the starboard side\nof the bow, and in white letters was faintly visible _Gazelle_ No. 2.\nThe boat had lain there for a long time, for it was half filled with\nsand, and the splintered wood had that weather-worn appearance due to\nlong exposure to the elements.  In the stern-sheets I found a rusty\nten-gauge shot-gun and a sailor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sheath-knife broken short across and so\nrusted as to be almost unrecognizable.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey got away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said cheerfully; but I felt a sinking at the heart and\nseemed to divine the presence of bleached bones somewhere on that beach.\n\nI did not wish Maud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spirits to be dampened by such a find, so I turned\nseaward again with our boat and skirted the north-eastern point of the\nisland.  There were no beaches on the southern shore, and by early\nafternoon we rounded the black promontory and completed the\ncircumnavigation of the island.  I estimated its circumference at\ntwenty-five miles, its width as varying from two to five miles; while my\nmost conservative calculation placed on its beaches two hundred thousand\nseals.  The island was highest at its extreme south-western point, the\nheadlands and backbone diminishing regularly until the north-eastern\nportion was only a few feet above the sea.  With the exception of our\nlittle cove, the other beaches sloped gently back for a distance of\nhalf-a-mile or so, into what I might call rocky meadows, with here and\nthere patches of moss and tundra grass.  Here the seals hauled out, and\nthe old bulls guarded their harems, while the young bulls hauled out by\nthemselves.\n\nThis brief description is all that Endeavour Island merits.  Damp and\nsoggy where it was not sharp and rocky, buffeted by storm winds and\nlashed by the sea, with the air continually a-tremble with the bellowing\nof two hundred thousand amphibians, it was a melancholy and miserable\nsojourning-place.  Maud, who had prepared me for disappointment, and who\nhad been sprightly and vivacious all day, broke down as we landed in our\nown little cove.  She strove bravely to hide it from me, but while I was\nkindling another fire I knew she was stifling her sobs in the blankets\nunder the sail-tent.\n\nIt was my turn to be cheerful, and I played the part to the best of my\nability, and with such success that I brought the laughter back into her\ndear eyes and song on her lips; for she sang to me before she went to an\nearly bed.  It was the first time I had heard her sing, and I lay by the\nfire, listening and transported, for she was nothing if not an artist in\neverything she did, and her voice, though not strong, was wonderfully\nsweet and expressive.\n\nI still slept in the boat, and I lay awake long that night, gazing up at\nthe first stars I had seen in many nights and pondering the situation.\nResponsibility of this sort was a new thing to me.  Wolf Larsen had been\nquite right.  I had stood on my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs.  My lawyers and agents had\ntaken care of my money for me.  I had had no responsibilities at all.\nThen, on the _Ghost_ I had learned to be responsible for myself.  And\nnow, for the first time in my life, I found myself responsible for some\none else.  And it was required of me that this should be the gravest of\nresponsibilities, for she was the one woman in the world\u00e2\u0080\u0094the one small\nwoman, as I loved to think of her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n\nNo wonder we called it Endeavour Island.  For two weeks we toiled at\nbuilding a hut.  Maud insisted on helping, and I could have wept over her\nbruised and bleeding hands.  And still, I was proud of her because of it.\nThere was something heroic about this gently-bred woman enduring our\nterrible hardship and with her pittance of strength bending to the tasks\nof a peasant woman.  She gathered many of the stones which I built into\nthe walls of the hut; also, she turned a deaf ear to my entreaties when I\nbegged her to desist.  She compromised, however, by taking upon herself\nthe lighter labours of cooking and gathering driftwood and moss for our\nwinter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supply.\n\nThe hut\u00e2\u0080\u0099s walls rose without difficulty, and everything went smoothly\nuntil the problem of the roof confronted me.  Of what use the four walls\nwithout a roof?  And of what could a roof be made?  There were the spare\noars, very true.  They would serve as roof-beams; but with what was I to\ncover them?  Moss would never do.  Tundra grass was impracticable.  We\nneeded the sail for the boat, and the tarpaulin had begun to leak.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWinters used walrus skins on his hut,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are the seals,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she suggested.\n\nSo next day the hunting began.  I did not know how to shoot, but I\nproceeded to learn.  And when I had expended some thirty shells for three\nseals, I decided that the ammunition would be exhausted before I acquired\nthe necessary knowledge.  I had used eight shells for lighting fires\nbefore I hit upon the device of banking the embers with wet moss, and\nthere remained not over a hundred shells in the box.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must club the seals,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I announced, when convinced of my poor\nmarksmanship.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have heard the sealers talk about clubbing them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are so pretty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she objected.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot bear to think of it being\ndone.  It is so directly brutal, you know; so different from shooting\nthem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat roof must go on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered grimly.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWinter is almost here.  It\nis our lives against theirs.  It is unfortunate we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t plenty of\nammunition, but I think, anyway, that they suffer less from being clubbed\nthan from being all shot up.  Besides, I shall do the clubbing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she began eagerly, and broke off in sudden confusion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I began, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you prefer\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what shall I be doing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she interrupted, with that softness I knew\nfull well to be insistence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGathering firewood and cooking dinner,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered lightly.\n\nShe shook her head.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is too dangerous for you to attempt alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know, I know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she waived my protest.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am only a weak woman, but\njust my small assistance may enable you to escape disaster.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the clubbing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I suggested.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course, you will do that.  I shall probably scream.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll look away\nwhen\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe danger is most serious,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I laughed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall use my judgment when to look and when not to look,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied\nwith a grand air.\n\nThe upshot of the affair was that she accompanied me next morning.  I\nrowed into the adjoining cove and up to the edge of the beach.  There\nwere seals all about us in the water, and the bellowing thousands on the\nbeach compelled us to shout at each other to make ourselves heard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know men club them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, trying to reassure myself, and gazing\ndoubtfully at a large bull, not thirty feet away, upreared on his\nfore-flippers and regarding me intently.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the question is, How do\nthey club them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet us gather tundra grass and thatch the roof,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maud said.\n\nShe was as frightened as I at the prospect, and we had reason to be\ngazing at close range at the gleaming teeth and dog-like mouths.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI always thought they were afraid of men,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do I know they are not afraid?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I queried a moment later, after\nhaving rowed a few more strokes along the beach.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps, if I were to\nstep boldly ashore, they would cut for it, and I could not catch up with\none.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And still I hesitated.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI heard of a man, once, who invaded the nesting grounds of wild geese,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMaud said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey killed him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe geese?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, the geese.  My brother told me about it when I was a little girl.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I know men club them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I persisted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think the tundra grass will make just as good a roof,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\nFar from her intention, her words were maddening me, driving me on.  I\ncould not play the coward before her eyes.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere goes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, backing\nwater with one oar and running the bow ashore.\n\nI stepped out and advanced valiantly upon a long-maned bull in the midst\nof his wives.  I was armed with the regular club with which the\nboat-pullers killed the wounded seals gaffed aboard by the hunters.  It\nwas only a foot and a half long, and in my superb ignorance I never\ndreamed that the club used ashore when raiding the rookeries measured\nfour to five feet.  The cows lumbered out of my way, and the distance\nbetween me and the bull decreased.  He raised himself on his flippers\nwith an angry movement.  We were a dozen feet apart.  Still I advanced\nsteadily, looking for him to turn tail at any moment and run.\n\nAt six feet the panicky thought rushed into my mind, What if he will not\nrun?  Why, then I shall club him, came the answer.  In my fear I had\nforgotten that I was there to get the bull instead of to make him run.\nAnd just then he gave a snort and a snarl and rushed at me.  His eyes\nwere blazing, his mouth was wide open; the teeth gleamed cruelly white.\nWithout shame, I confess that it was I who turned and footed it.  He ran\nawkwardly, but he ran well.  He was but two paces behind when I tumbled\ninto the boat, and as I shoved off with an oar his teeth crunched down\nupon the blade.  The stout wood was crushed like an egg-shell.  Maud and\nI were astounded.  A moment later he had dived under the boat, seized the\nkeel in his mouth, and was shaking the boat violently.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Maud.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI shook my head.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can do what other men have done, and I know that\nother men have clubbed seals.  But I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll leave the bulls alone\nnext time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Please, please,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried, half angrily, I do believe.\n\nShe made no reply, and I knew my tone must have hurt her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI beg your pardon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, or shouted, rather, in order to make myself\nheard above the roar of the rookery.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you say so, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn and go\nback; but honestly, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather stay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say that this is what you get for bringing a woman along,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nsaid.  She smiled at me whimsically, gloriously, and I knew there was no\nneed for forgiveness.\n\nI rowed a couple of hundred feet along the beach so as to recover my\nnerves, and then stepped ashore again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo be cautious,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she called after me.\n\nI nodded my head and proceeded to make a flank attack on the nearest\nharem.  All went well until I aimed a blow at an outlying cow's head and\nfell short.  She snorted and tried to scramble away.  I ran in close and\nstruck another blow, hitting the shoulder instead of the head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWatch out!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I heard Maud scream.\n\nIn my excitement I had not been taking notice of other things, and I\nlooked up to see the lord of the harem charging down upon me.  Again I\nfled to the boat, hotly pursued; but this time Maud made no suggestion of\nturning back.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would be better, I imagine, if you let harems alone and devoted your\nattention to lonely and inoffensive-looking seals,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was what she said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think I have read something about them.  Dr. Jordan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s book, I believe.\nThey are the young bulls, not old enough to have harems of their own.  He\ncalled them the holluschickie, or something like that.  It seems to me if\nwe find where they haul out\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seems to me that your fighting instinct is aroused,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I laughed.\n\nShe flushed quickly and prettily.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll admit I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like defeat any\nmore than you do, or any more than I like the idea of killing such\npretty, inoffensive creatures.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPretty!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I sniffed.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI failed to mark anything pre-eminently pretty\nabout those foamy-mouthed beasts that raced me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour point of view,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she laughed.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou lacked perspective.  Now if you\ndid not have to get so close to the subject\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe very thing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I need is a longer club.  And there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nthat broken oar ready to hand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt just comes to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat Captain Larsen was telling me how\nthe men raided the rookeries.  They drive the seals, in small herds, a\nshort distance inland before they kill them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care to undertake the herding of one of those harems,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\nobjected.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut there are the holluschickie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe holluschickie haul out\nby themselves, and Dr. Jordan says that paths are left between the\nharems, and that as long as the holluschickie keep strictly to the path\nthey are unmolested by the masters of the harem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, pointing to a young bull in the water.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwatch him, and follow him if he hauls out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe swam directly to the beach and clambered out into a small opening\nbetween two harems, the masters of which made warning noises but did not\nattack him.  We watched him travel slowly inward, threading about among\nthe harems along what must have been the path.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere goes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, stepping out; but I confess my heart was in my mouth\nas I thought of going through the heart of that monstrous herd.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would be wise to make the boat fast,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maud said.\n\nShe had stepped out beside me, and I regarded her with wonderment.\n\nShe nodded her head determinedly.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going with you, so you may\nas well secure the boat and arm me with a club.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go back,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said dejectedly.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think tundra grass, will do,\nafter all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was her reply.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cShall I lead?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith a shrug of the shoulders, but with the warmest admiration and pride\nat heart for this woman, I equipped her with the broken oar and took\nanother for myself.  It was with nervous trepidation that we made the\nfirst few rods of the journey.  Once Maud screamed in terror as a cow\nthrust an inquisitive nose toward her foot, and several times I quickened\nmy pace for the same reason.  But, beyond warning coughs from either\nside, there were no signs of hostility.  It was a rookery which had never\nbeen raided by the hunters, and in consequence the seals were\nmild-tempered and at the same time unafraid.\n\nIn the very heart of the herd the din was terrific.  It was almost\ndizzying in its effect.  I paused and smiled reassuringly at Maud, for I\nhad recovered my equanimity sooner than she.  I could see that she was\nstill badly frightened.  She came close to me and shouted:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m dreadfully afraid!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd I was not.  Though the novelty had not yet worn off, the peaceful\ncomportment of the seals had quieted my alarm.  Maud was trembling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not afraid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she chattered with shaking jaws.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nmy miserable body, not I.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I reassured her, my arm passing\ninstinctively and protectingly around her.\n\nI shall never forget, in that moment, how instantly conscious I became of\nmy manhood.  The primitive deeps of my nature stirred.  I felt myself\nmasculine, the protector of the weak, the fighting male.  And, best of\nall, I felt myself the protector of my loved one.  She leaned against me,\nso light and lily-frail, and as her trembling eased away it seemed as\nthough I became aware of prodigious strength.  I felt myself a match for\nthe most ferocious bull in the herd, and I know, had such a bull charged\nupon me, that I should have met it unflinchingly and quite coolly, and I\nknow that I should have killed it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am all right now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, looking up at me gratefully.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet us go\non.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd that the strength in me had quieted her and given her confidence,\nfilled me with an exultant joy.  The youth of the race seemed burgeoning\nin me, over-civilized man that I was, and I lived for myself the old\nhunting days and forest nights of my remote and forgotten ancestry.  I\nhad much for which to thank Wolf Larsen, was my thought as we went along\nthe path between the jostling harems.\n\nA quarter of a mile inland we came upon the holluschickie\u00e2\u0080\u0094sleek young\nbulls, living out the loneliness of their bachelorhood and gathering\nstrength against the day when they would fight their way into the ranks\nof the Benedicts.\n\nEverything now went smoothly.  I seemed to know just what to do and how\nto do it.  Shouting, making threatening gestures with my club, and even\nprodding the lazy ones, I quickly cut out a score of the young bachelors\nfrom their companions.  Whenever one made an attempt to break back toward\nthe water, I headed it off.  Maud took an active part in the drive, and\nwith her cries and flourishings of the broken oar was of considerable\nassistance.  I noticed, though, that whenever one looked tired and\nlagged, she let it slip past.  But I noticed, also, whenever one, with a\nshow of fight, tried to break past, that her eyes glinted and showed\nbright, and she rapped it smartly with her club.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exciting!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, pausing from sheer weakness.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll sit down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI drove the little herd (a dozen strong, now, what of the escapes she had\npermitted) a hundred yards farther on; and by the time she joined me I\nhad finished the slaughter and was beginning to skin.  An hour later we\nwent proudly back along the path between the harems.  And twice again we\ncame down the path burdened with skins, till I thought we had enough to\nroof the hut.  I set the sail, laid one tack out of the cove, and on the\nother tack made our own little inner cove.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just like home-coming,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maud said, as I ran the boat ashore.\n\nI heard her words with a responsive thrill, it was all so dearly intimate\nand natural, and I said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seems as though I have lived this life always.  The world of books\nand bookish folk is very vague, more like a dream memory than an\nactuality.  I surely have hunted and forayed and fought all the days of\nmy life.  And you, too, seem a part of it.  You are\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d  I was on the verge\nof saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy woman, my mate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but glibly changed it to\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cstanding the\nhardship well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut her ear had caught the flaw.  She recognized a flight that midmost\nbroke.  She gave me a quick look.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot that.  You were saying\u00e2\u0080\u0094?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat the American Mrs. Meynell was living the life of a savage and\nliving it quite successfully,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said easily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was all she replied; but I could have sworn there was a note of\ndisappointment in her voice.\n\nBut \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy woman, my mate\u00e2\u0080\u009d kept ringing in my head for the rest of the day\nand for many days.  Yet never did it ring more loudly than that night, as\nI watched her draw back the blanket of moss from the coals, blow up the\nfire, and cook the evening meal.  It must have been latent savagery\nstirring in me, for the old words, so bound up with the roots of the\nrace, to grip me and thrill me.  And grip and thrill they did, till I\nfell asleep, murmuring them to myself over and over again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will smell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it will keep in the heat and keep out the\nrain and snow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe were surveying the completed seal-skin roof.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is clumsy, but it will serve the purpose, and that is the main\nthing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I went on, yearning for her praise.\n\nAnd she clapped her hands and declared that she was hugely pleased.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it is dark in here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said the next moment, her shoulders\nshrinking with a little involuntary shiver.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou might have suggested a window when the walls were going up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was for you, and you should have seen the need of a window.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I never do see the obvious, you know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she laughed back.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd\nbesides, you can knock a hole in the wall at any time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cQuite true; I had not thought of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied, wagging my head sagely.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut have you thought of ordering the window-glass?  Just call up the\nfirm,\u00e2\u0080\u0094Red, 4451, I think it is,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and tell them what size and kind of glass\nyou wish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat means\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d she began.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo window.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was a dark and evil-appearing thing, that hut, not fit for aught\nbetter than swine in a civilized land; but for us, who had known the\nmisery of the open boat, it was a snug little habitation.  Following the\nhousewarming, which was accomplished by means of seal-oil and a wick made\nfrom cotton calking, came the hunting for our winter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meat and the\nbuilding of the second hut.  It was a simple affair, now, to go forth in\nthe morning and return by noon with a boatload of seals.  And then, while\nI worked at building the hut, Maud tried out the oil from the blubber and\nkept a slow fire under the frames of meat.  I had heard of jerking beef\non the plains, and our seal-meat, cut in thin strips and hung in the\nsmoke, cured excellently.\n\nThe second hut was easier to erect, for I built it against the first, and\nonly three walls were required.  But it was work, hard work, all of it.\nMaud and I worked from dawn till dark, to the limit of our strength, so\nthat when night came we crawled stiffly to bed and slept the animal-like\nsleep of exhaustion.  And yet Maud declared that she had never felt better\nor stronger in her life.  I knew this was true of myself, but hers was\nsuch a lily strength that I feared she would break down.  Often and\noften, her last-reserve force gone, I have seen her stretched flat on her\nback on the sand in the way she had of resting and recuperating.  And\nthen she would be up on her feet and toiling hard as ever.  Where she\nobtained this strength was the marvel to me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThink of the long rest this winter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was her reply to my remonstrances.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be clamorous for something to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe held a housewarming in my hut the night it was roofed.  It was the end\nof the third day of a fierce storm which had swung around the compass\nfrom the south-east to the north-west, and which was then blowing\ndirectly in upon us.  The beaches of the outer cove were thundering with\nthe surf, and even in our land-locked inner cove a respectable sea was\nbreaking.  No high backbone of island sheltered us from the wind, and it\nwhistled and bellowed about the hut till at times I feared for the\nstrength of the walls.  The skin roof, stretched tightly as a drumhead, I\nhad thought, sagged and bellied with every gust; and innumerable\ninterstices in the walls, not so tightly stuffed with moss as Maud had\nsupposed, disclosed themselves.  Yet the seal-oil burned brightly and we\nwere warm and comfortable.\n\nIt was a pleasant evening indeed, and we voted that as a social function\non Endeavour Island it had not yet been eclipsed.  Our minds were at\nease.  Not only had we resigned ourselves to the bitter winter, but we\nwere prepared for it.  The seals could depart on their mysterious journey\ninto the south at any time, now, for all we cared; and the storms held no\nterror for us.  Not only were we sure of being dry and warm and sheltered\nfrom the wind, but we had the softest and most luxurious mattresses that\ncould be made from moss.  This had been Maud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s idea, and she had herself\njealously gathered all the moss.  This was to be my first night on the\nmattress, and I knew I should sleep the sweeter because she had made it.\n\nAs she rose to go she turned to me with the whimsical way she had, and\nsaid:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSomething is going to happen\u00e2\u0080\u0094is happening, for that matter.  I feel it.\nSomething is coming here, to us.  It is coming now.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what,\nbut it is coming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood or bad?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\nShe shook her head.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, but it is there, somewhere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe pointed in the direction of the sea and wind.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lee shore,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I laughed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I am sure I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather be here than\narriving, a night like this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are not frightened?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked, as I stepped to open the door for her.\n\nHer eyes looked bravely into mine.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you feel well? perfectly well?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever better,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was her answer.\n\nWe talked a little longer before she went.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-night, Maud,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-night, Humphrey,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\nThis use of our given names had come about quite as a matter of course,\nand was as unpremeditated as it was natural.  In that moment I could have\nput my arms around her and drawn her to me.  I should certainly have done\nso out in that world to which we belonged.  As it was, the situation\nstopped there in the only way it could; but I was left alone in my little\nhut, glowing warmly through and through with a pleasant satisfaction; and\nI knew that a tie, or a tacit something, existed between us which had not\nexisted before.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n\nI awoke, oppressed by a mysterious sensation.  There seemed something\nmissing in my environment.  But the mystery and oppressiveness vanished\nafter the first few seconds of waking, when I identified the missing\nsomething as the wind.  I had fallen asleep in that state of nerve\ntension with which one meets the continuous shock of sound or movement,\nand I had awakened, still tense, bracing myself to meet the pressure of\nsomething which no longer bore upon me.\n\nIt was the first night I had spent under cover in several months, and I\nlay luxuriously for some minutes under my blankets (for once not wet with\nfog or spray), analysing, first, the effect produced upon me by the\ncessation of the wind, and next, the joy which was mine from resting on\nthe mattress made by Maud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands.  When I had dressed and opened the\ndoor, I heard the waves still lapping on the beach, garrulously attesting\nthe fury of the night.  It was a clear day, and the sun was shining.  I\nhad slept late, and I stepped outside with sudden energy, bent upon\nmaking up lost time as befitted a dweller on Endeavour Island.\n\nAnd when outside, I stopped short.  I believed my eyes without question,\nand yet I was for the moment stunned by what they disclosed to me.\nThere, on the beach, not fifty feet away, bow on, dismasted, was a\nblack-hulled vessel.  Masts and booms, tangled with shrouds, sheets, and\nrent canvas, were rubbing gently alongside.  I could have rubbed my eyes\nas I looked.  There was the home-made galley we had built, the familiar\nbreak of the poop, the low yacht-cabin scarcely rising above the rail.\nIt was the _Ghost_.\n\nWhat freak of fortune had brought it here\u00e2\u0080\u0094here of all spots? what chance\nof chances?  I looked at the bleak, inaccessible wall at my back and know\nthe profundity of despair.  Escape was hopeless, out of the question.  I\nthought of Maud, asleep there in the hut we had reared; I remembered her\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-night, Humphrey\u00e2\u0080\u009d; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy woman, my mate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d went ringing through my\nbrain, but now, alas, it was a knell that sounded.  Then everything went\nblack before my eyes.\n\nPossibly it was the fraction of a second, but I had no knowledge of how\nlong an interval had lapsed before I was myself again.  There lay the\n_Ghost_, bow on to the beach, her splintered bowsprit projecting over the\nsand, her tangled spars rubbing against her side to the lift of the\ncrooning waves.  Something must be done, must be done.\n\nIt came upon me suddenly, as strange, that nothing moved aboard.  Wearied\nfrom the night of struggle and wreck, all hands were yet asleep, I\nthought.  My next thought was that Maud and I might yet escape.  If we\ncould take to the boat and make round the point before any one awoke?  I\nwould call her and start.  My hand was lifted at her door to knock, when\nI recollected the smallness of the island.  We could never hide ourselves\nupon it.  There was nothing for us but the wide raw ocean.  I thought of\nour snug little huts, our supplies of meat and oil and moss and firewood,\nand I knew that we could never survive the wintry sea and the great\nstorms which were to come.\n\nSo I stood, with hesitant knuckle, without her door.  It was impossible,\nimpossible.  A wild thought of rushing in and killing her as she slept\nrose in my mind.  And then, in a flash, the better solution came to me.\nAll hands were asleep.  Why not creep aboard the _Ghost_,\u00e2\u0080\u0094well I knew the\nway to Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bunk,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and kill him in his sleep?  After that\u00e2\u0080\u0094well,\nwe would see.  But with him dead there was time and space in which to\nprepare to do other things; and besides, whatever new situation arose, it\ncould not possibly be worse than the present one.\n\nMy knife was at my hip.  I returned to my hut for the shot-gun, made sure\nit was loaded, and went down to the _Ghost_.  With some difficulty, and\nat the expense of a wetting to the waist, I climbed aboard.  The\nforecastle scuttle was open.  I paused to listen for the breathing of the\nmen, but there was no breathing.  I almost gasped as the thought came to\nme: What if the _Ghost_ is deserted?  I listened more closely.  There was\nno sound.  I cautiously descended the ladder.  The place had the empty\nand musty feel and smell usual to a dwelling no longer inhabited.\nEverywhere was a thick litter of discarded and ragged garments, old\nsea-boots, leaky oilskins\u00e2\u0080\u0094all the worthless forecastle dunnage of a long\nvoyage.\n\nAbandoned hastily, was my conclusion, as I ascended to the deck.  Hope\nwas alive again in my breast, and I looked about me with greater\ncoolness.  I noted that the boats were missing.  The steerage told the\nsame tale as the forecastle.  The hunters had packed their belongings\nwith similar haste.  The _Ghost_ was deserted.  It was Maud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and mine.\nI thought of the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stores and the lazarette beneath the cabin, and\nthe idea came to me of surprising Maud with something nice for breakfast.\n\nThe reaction from my fear, and the knowledge that the terrible deed I had\ncome to do was no longer necessary, made me boyish and eager.  I went up\nthe steerage companion-way two steps at a time, with nothing distinct in\nmy mind except joy and the hope that Maud would sleep on until the\nsurprise breakfast was quite ready for her.  As I rounded the galley, a\nnew satisfaction was mine at thought of all the splendid cooking utensils\ninside.  I sprang up the break of the poop, and saw\u00e2\u0080\u0094Wolf Larsen.  What of\nmy impetus and the stunning surprise, I clattered three or four steps\nalong the deck before I could stop myself.  He was standing in the\ncompanion-way, only his head and shoulders visible, staring straight at\nme.  His arms were resting on the half-open slide.  He made no movement\nwhatever\u00e2\u0080\u0094simply stood there, staring at me.\n\nI began to tremble.  The old stomach sickness clutched me.  I put one\nhand on the edge of the house to steady myself.  My lips seemed suddenly\ndry and I moistened them against the need of speech.  Nor did I for an\ninstant take my eyes off him.  Neither of us spoke.  There was something\nominous in his silence, his immobility.  All my old fear of him returned\nand by my new fear was increased an hundred-fold.  And still we stood, the\npair of us, staring at each other.\n\nI was aware of the demand for action, and, my old helplessness strong\nupon me, I was waiting for him to take the initiative.  Then, as the\nmoments went by, it came to me that the situation was analogous to the\none in which I had approached the long-maned bull, my intention of\nclubbing obscured by fear until it became a desire to make him run.  So\nit was at last impressed upon me that I was there, not to have Wolf\nLarsen take the initiative, but to take it myself.\n\nI cocked both barrels and levelled the shot-gun at him.  Had he moved,\nattempted to drop down the companion-way, I know I would have shot him.\nBut he stood motionless and staring as before.  And as I faced him, with\nlevelled gun shaking in my hands, I had time to note the worn and haggard\nappearance of his face.  It was as if some strong anxiety had wasted it.\nThe cheeks were sunken, and there was a wearied, puckered expression on\nthe brow.  And it seemed to me that his eyes were strange, not only the\nexpression, but the physical seeming, as though the optic nerves and\nsupporting muscles had suffered strain and slightly twisted the eyeballs.\n\nAll this I saw, and my brain now working rapidly, I thought a thousand\nthoughts; and yet I could not pull the triggers.  I lowered the gun and\nstepped to the corner of the cabin, primarily to relieve the tension on\nmy nerves and to make a new start, and incidentally to be closer.  Again\nI raised the gun.  He was almost at arm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s length.  There was no hope for\nhim.  I was resolved.  There was no possible chance of missing him, no\nmatter how poor my marksmanship.  And yet I wrestled with myself and\ncould not pull the triggers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he demanded impatiently.\n\nI strove vainly to force my fingers down on the triggers, and vainly I\nstrove to say something.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you shoot?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\nI cleared my throat of a huskiness which prevented speech.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid slowly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it.  You are not exactly afraid.  You are\nimpotent.  Your conventional morality is stronger than you.  You are the\nslave to the opinions which have credence among the people you have known\nand have read about.  Their code has been drummed into your head from the\ntime you lisped, and in spite of your philosophy, and of what I have\ntaught you, it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let you kill an unarmed, unresisting man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said hoarsely.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you know that I would kill an unarmed man as readily as I would\nsmoke a cigar,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he went on.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know me for what I am,\u00e2\u0080\u0094my worth in the\nworld by your standard.  You have called me snake, tiger, shark, monster,\nand Caliban.  And yet, you little rag puppet, you little echoing\nmechanism, you are unable to kill me as you would a snake or a shark,\nbecause I have hands, feet, and a body shaped somewhat like yours.  Bah!\nI had hoped better things of you, Hump.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe stepped out of the companion-way and came up to me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPut down that gun.  I want to ask you some questions.  I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had a\nchance to look around yet.  What place is this?  How is the _Ghost_\nlying?  How did you get wet?  Where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Maud?\u00e2\u0080\u0094I beg your pardon, Miss\nBrewster\u00e2\u0080\u0094or should I say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mrs. Van Weyden\u00e2\u0080\u0099?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI had backed away from him, almost weeping at my inability to shoot him,\nbut not fool enough to put down the gun.  I hoped, desperately, that he\nmight commit some hostile act, attempt to strike me or choke me; for in\nsuch way only I knew I could be stirred to shoot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is Endeavour Island,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever heard of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he broke in.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt least, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our name for it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I amended.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he queried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Brewster and myself.  And the _Ghost_ is lying, as you can see for\nyourself, bow on to the beach.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are seals here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey woke me up with their barking, or\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be sleeping yet.  I heard them when I drove in last night.  They were\nthe first warning that I was on a lee shore.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a rookery, the kind of\na thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve hunted for years.  Thanks to my brother Death, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lighted\non a fortune.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a mint.  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s its bearings?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the least idea,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you ought to know quite closely.\nWhat were your last observations?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe smiled inscrutably, but did not answer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all hands?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow does it come that you are\nalone?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI was prepared for him again to set aside my question, and was surprised\nat the readiness of his reply.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy brother got me inside forty-eight hours, and through no fault of\nmine.  Boarded me in the night with only the watch on deck.  Hunters went\nback on me.  He gave them a bigger lay.  Heard him offering it.  Did it\nright before me.  Of course the crew gave me the go-by.  That was to be\nexpected.  All hands went over the side, and there I was, marooned on my\nown vessel.  It was Death\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turn, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all in the family anyway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut how did you lose the masts?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWalk over and examine those lanyards,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, pointing to where the\nmizzen-rigging should have been.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have been cut with a knife!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I exclaimed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot quite,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he laughed.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a neater job.  Look again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI looked.  The lanyards had been almost severed, with just enough left to\nhold the shrouds till some severe strain should be put upon them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCooky did that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he laughed again.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know, though I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spot him at\nit.  Kind of evened up the score a bit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood for Mugridge!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I thought when everything went over the side.  Only I\nsaid it on the other side of my mouth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what were you doing while all this was going on?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy best, you may be sure, which wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much under the circumstances.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI turned to re-examine Thomas Mugridge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI guess I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll sit down and take the sunshine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I heard Wolf Larsen\nsaying.\n\nThere was a hint, just a slight hint, of physical feebleness in his\nvoice, and it was so strange that I looked quickly at him.  His hand was\nsweeping nervously across his face, as though he were brushing away\ncobwebs.  I was puzzled.  The whole thing was so unlike the Wolf Larsen I\nhad known.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow are your headaches?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey still trouble me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was his answer.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think I have one coming on\nnow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe slipped down from his sitting posture till he lay on the deck.  Then\nhe rolled over on his side, his head resting on the biceps of the under\narm, the forearm shielding his eyes from the sun.  I stood regarding him\nwonderingly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your chance, Hump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I lied, for I thoroughly understood.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, nothing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added softly, as if he were drowsing; \u00e2\u0080\u009conly you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got\nme where you want me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I retorted; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I want you a few thousand miles away\nfrom here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe chuckled, and thereafter spoke no more.  He did not stir as I passed\nby him and went down into the cabin.  I lifted the trap in the floor, but\nfor some moments gazed dubiously into the darkness of the lazarette\nbeneath.  I hesitated to descend.  What if his lying down were a ruse?\nPretty, indeed, to be caught there like a rat.  I crept softly up the\ncompanion-way and peeped at him.  He was lying as I had left him.  Again\nI went below; but before I dropped into the lazarette I took the\nprecaution of casting down the door in advance.  At least there would be\nno lid to the trap.  But it was all needless.  I regained the cabin with\na store of jams, sea-biscuits, canned meats, and such things,\u00e2\u0080\u0094all I could\ncarry,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and replaced the trap-door.\n\nA peep at Wolf Larsen showed me that he had not moved.  A bright thought\nstruck me.  I stole into his state-room and possessed myself of his\nrevolvers.  There were no other weapons, though I thoroughly ransacked\nthe three remaining state-rooms.  To make sure, I returned and went\nthrough the steerage and forecastle, and in the galley gathered up all\nthe sharp meat and vegetable knives.  Then I bethought me of the great\nyachtsman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knife he always carried, and I came to him and spoke to him,\nfirst softly, then loudly.  He did not move.  I bent over and took it\nfrom his pocket.  I breathed more freely.  He had no arms with which to\nattack me from a distance; while I, armed, could always forestall him\nshould he attempt to grapple me with his terrible gorilla arms.\n\nFilling a coffee-pot and frying-pan with part of my plunder, and taking\nsome chinaware from the cabin pantry, I left Wolf Larsen lying in the sun\nand went ashore.\n\nMaud was still asleep.  I blew up the embers (we had not yet arranged a\nwinter kitchen), and quite feverishly cooked the breakfast.  Toward the\nend, I heard her moving about within the hut, making her toilet.  Just as\nall was ready and the coffee poured, the door opened and she came forth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not fair of you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was her greeting.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are usurping one of my\nprerogatives.  You know you I agreed that the cooking should be mine,\nand\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut just this once,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I pleaded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you promise not to do it again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she smiled.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnless, of course, you\nhave grown tired of my poor efforts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTo my delight she never once looked toward the beach, and I maintained\nthe banter with such success all unconsciously she sipped coffee from the\nchina cup, ate fried evaporated potatoes, and spread marmalade on her\nbiscuit.  But it could not last.  I saw the surprise that came over her.\nShe had discovered the china plate from which she was eating.  She looked\nover the breakfast, noting detail after detail.  Then she looked at me,\nand her face turned slowly toward the beach.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHumphrey!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\nThe old unnamable terror mounted into her eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs\u00e2\u0080\u0094he?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she quavered.\n\nI nodded my head.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n\nWe waited all day for Wolf Larsen to come ashore.  It was an intolerable\nperiod of anxiety.  Each moment one or the other of us cast expectant\nglances toward the _Ghost_.  But he did not come.  He did not even appear\non deck.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps it is his headache,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI left him lying on the poop.  He\nmay lie there all night.  I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go and see.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMaud looked entreaty at me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is all right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I assured her.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall take the revolvers.  You know\nI collected every weapon on board.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut there are his arms, his hands, his terrible, terrible hands!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nobjected.  And then she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Humphrey, I am afraid of him!  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\ngo\u00e2\u0080\u0094please don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe rested her hand appealingly on mine, and sent my pulse fluttering.\nMy heart was surely in my eyes for a moment.  The dear and lovely woman!\nAnd she was so much the woman, clinging and appealing, sunshine and dew\nto my manhood, rooting it deeper and sending through it the sap of a new\nstrength.  I was for putting my arm around her, as when in the midst of\nthe seal herd; but I considered, and refrained.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall not take any risks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll merely peep over the bow and\nsee.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe pressed my hand earnestly and let me go.  But the space on deck where\nI had left him lying was vacant.  He had evidently gone below.  That\nnight we stood alternate watches, one of us sleeping at a time; for there\nwas no telling what Wolf Larsen might do.  He was certainly capable of\nanything.\n\nThe next day we waited, and the next, and still he made no sign.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese headaches of his, these attacks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maud said, on the afternoon of\nthe fourth day; \u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps he is ill, very ill.  He may be dead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOr dying,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was her afterthought when she had waited some time for me to\nspeak.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBetter so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut think, Humphrey, a fellow-creature in his last lonely hour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I suggested.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, even perhaps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she acknowledged.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut we do not know.  It would be\nterrible if he were.  I could never forgive myself.  We must do\nsomething.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I suggested again.\n\nI waited, smiling inwardly at the woman of her which compelled a\nsolicitude for Wolf Larsen, of all creatures.  Where was her solicitude\nfor me, I thought,\u00e2\u0080\u0094for me whom she had been afraid to have merely peep\naboard?\n\nShe was too subtle not to follow the trend of my silence.  And she was as\ndirect as she was subtle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must go aboard, Humphrey, and find out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if you want\nto laugh at me, you have my consent and forgiveness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI arose obediently and went down the beach.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo be careful,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she called after me.\n\nI waved my arm from the forecastle head and dropped down to the deck.\nAft I walked to the cabin companion, where I contented myself with\nhailing below.  Wolf Larsen answered, and as he started to ascend the\nstairs I cocked my revolver.  I displayed it openly during our\nconversation, but he took no notice of it.  He appeared the same,\nphysically, as when last I saw him, but he was gloomy and silent.  In\nfact, the few words we spoke could hardly be called a conversation.  I\ndid not inquire why he had not been ashore, nor did he ask why I had not\ncome aboard.  His head was all right again, he said, and so, without\nfurther parley, I left him.\n\nMaud received my report with obvious relief, and the sight of smoke which\nlater rose in the galley put her in a more cheerful mood.  The next day,\nand the next, we saw the galley smoke rising, and sometimes we caught\nglimpses of him on the poop.  But that was all.  He made no attempt to\ncome ashore.  This we knew, for we still maintained our night-watches.\nWe were waiting for him to do something, to show his hand, so to say, and\nhis inaction puzzled and worried us.\n\nA week of this passed by.  We had no other interest than Wolf Larsen, and\nhis presence weighed us down with an apprehension which prevented us from\ndoing any of the little things we had planned.\n\nBut at the end of the week the smoke ceased rising from the galley, and\nhe no longer showed himself on the poop.  I could see Maud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s solicitude\nagain growing, though she timidly\u00e2\u0080\u0094and even proudly, I think\u00e2\u0080\u0094forbore a\nrepetition of her request.  After all, what censure could be put upon\nher?  She was divinely altruistic, and she was a woman.  Besides, I was\nmyself aware of hurt at thought of this man whom I had tried to kill,\ndying alone with his fellow-creatures so near.  He was right.  The code\nof my group was stronger than I.  The fact that he had hands, feet, and a\nbody shaped somewhat like mine, constituted a claim which I could not\nignore.\n\nSo I did not wait a second time for Maud to send me.  I discovered that\nwe stood in need of condensed milk and marmalade, and announced that I\nwas going aboard.  I could see that she wavered.  She even went so far as\nto murmur that they were non-essentials and that my trip after them might\nbe inexpedient.  And as she had followed the trend of my silence, she now\nfollowed the trend of my speech, and she knew that I was going aboard,\nnot because of condensed milk and marmalade, but because of her and of\nher anxiety, which she knew she had failed to hide.\n\nI took off my shoes when I gained the forecastle head, and went\nnoiselessly aft in my stocking feet.  Nor did I call this time from the\ntop of the companion-way.  Cautiously descending, I found the cabin\ndeserted.  The door to his state-room was closed.  At first I thought of\nknocking, then I remembered my ostensible errand and resolved to carry it\nout.  Carefully avoiding noise, I lifted the trap-door in the floor and\nset it to one side.  The slop-chest, as well as the provisions, was\nstored in the lazarette, and I took advantage of the opportunity to lay\nin a stock of underclothing.\n\nAs I emerged from the lazarette I heard sounds in Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nstate-room.  I crouched and listened.  The door-knob rattled.  Furtively,\ninstinctively, I slunk back behind the table and drew and cocked my\nrevolver.  The door swung open and he came forth.  Never had I seen so\nprofound a despair as that which I saw on his face,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the face of Wolf\nLarsen the fighter, the strong man, the indomitable one.  For all the\nworld like a woman wringing her hands, he raised his clenched fists and\ngroaned.  One fist unclosed, and the open palm swept across his eyes as\nthough brushing away cobwebs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod!  God!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he groaned, and the clenched fists were raised again to the\ninfinite despair with which his throat vibrated.\n\nIt was horrible.  I was trembling all over, and I could feel the shivers\nrunning up and down my spine and the sweat standing out on my forehead.\nSurely there can be little in this world more awful than the spectacle of\na strong man in the moment when he is utterly weak and broken.\n\nBut Wolf Larsen regained control of himself by an exertion of his\nremarkable will.  And it was exertion.  His whole frame shook with the\nstruggle.  He resembled a man on the verge of a fit.  His face strove to\ncompose itself, writhing and twisting in the effort till he broke down\nagain.  Once more the clenched fists went upward and he groaned.  He\ncaught his breath once or twice and sobbed.  Then he was successful.  I\ncould have thought him the old Wolf Larsen, and yet there was in his\nmovements a vague suggestion of weakness and indecision.  He started for\nthe companion-way, and stepped forward quite as I had been accustomed to\nsee him do; and yet again, in his very walk, there seemed that suggestion\nof weakness and indecision.\n\nI was now concerned with fear for myself.  The open trap lay directly in\nhis path, and his discovery of it would lead instantly to his discovery\nof me.  I was angry with myself for being caught in so cowardly a\nposition, crouching on the floor.  There was yet time.  I rose swiftly to\nmy feet, and, I know, quite unconsciously assumed a defiant attitude.  He\ntook no notice of me.  Nor did he notice the open trap.  Before I could\ngrasp the situation, or act, he had walked right into the trap.  One foot\nwas descending into the opening, while the other foot was just on the\nverge of beginning the uplift.  But when the descending foot missed the\nsolid flooring and felt vacancy beneath, it was the old Wolf Larsen and\nthe tiger muscles that made the falling body spring across the opening,\neven as it fell, so that he struck on his chest and stomach, with arms\noutstretched, on the floor of the opposite side.  The next instant he had\ndrawn up his legs and rolled clear.  But he rolled into my marmalade and\nunderclothes and against the trap-door.\n\nThe expression on his face was one of complete comprehension.  But before\nI could guess what he had comprehended, he had dropped the trap-door into\nplace, closing the lazarette.  Then I understood.  He thought he had me\ninside.  Also, he was blind, blind as a bat.  I watched him, breathing\ncarefully so that he should not hear me.  He stepped quickly to his\nstate-room.  I saw his hand miss the door-knob by an inch, quickly fumble\nfor it, and find it.  This was my chance.  I tiptoed across the cabin and\nto the top of the stairs.  He came back, dragging a heavy sea-chest,\nwhich he deposited on top of the trap.  Not content with this he fetched\na second chest and placed it on top of the first.  Then he gathered up\nthe marmalade and underclothes and put them on the table.  When he\nstarted up the companion-way, I retreated, silently rolling over on top\nof the cabin.\n\nHe shoved the slide part way back and rested his arms on it, his body\nstill in the companion-way.  His attitude was of one looking forward the\nlength of the schooner, or staring, rather, for his eyes were fixed and\nunblinking.  I was only five feet away and directly in what should have\nbeen his line of vision.  It was uncanny.  I felt myself a ghost, what of\nmy invisibility.  I waved my hand back and forth, of course without\neffect; but when the moving shadow fell across his face I saw at once\nthat he was susceptible to the impression.  His face became more\nexpectant and tense as he tried to analyze and identify the impression.\nHe knew that he had responded to something from without, that his\nsensibility had been touched by a changing something in his environment;\nbut what it was he could not discover.  I ceased waving my hand, so that\nthe shadow remained stationary.  He slowly moved his head back and forth\nunder it and turned from side to side, now in the sunshine, now in the\nshade, feeling the shadow, as it were, testing it by sensation.\n\nI, too, was busy, trying to reason out how he was aware of the existence\nof so intangible a thing as a shadow.  If it were his eyeballs only that\nwere affected, or if his optic nerve were not wholly destroyed, the\nexplanation was simple.  If otherwise, then the only conclusion I could\nreach was that the sensitive skin recognized the difference of\ntemperature between shade and sunshine.  Or, perhaps,\u00e2\u0080\u0094who can tell?\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\nwas that fabled sixth sense which conveyed to him the loom and feel of an\nobject close at hand.\n\nGiving over his attempt to determine the shadow, he stepped on deck and\nstarted forward, walking with a swiftness and confidence which surprised\nme.  And still there was that hint of the feebleness of the blind in his\nwalk.  I knew it now for what it was.\n\nTo my amused chagrin, he discovered my shoes on the forecastle head and\nbrought them back with him into the galley.  I watched him build the fire\nand set about cooking food for himself; then I stole into the cabin for\nmy marmalade and underclothes, slipped back past the galley, and climbed\ndown to the beach to deliver my barefoot report.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too bad the _Ghost_ has lost her masts.  Why we could sail away in\nher.  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think we could, Humphrey?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI sprang excitedly to my feet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wonder, I wonder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I repeated, pacing up and down.\n\nMaud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes were shining with anticipation as they followed me.  She had\nsuch faith in me!  And the thought of it was so much added power.  I\nremembered Michelet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo man, woman is as the earth was to her legendary\nson; he has but to fall down and kiss her breast and he is strong again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nFor the first time I knew the wonderful truth of his words.  Why, I was\nliving them.  Maud was all this to me, an unfailing, source of strength\nand courage.  I had but to look at her, or think of her, and be strong\nagain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt can be done, it can be done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was thinking and asserting aloud.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat men have done, I can do; and if they have never done this before,\nstill I can do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat? for goodness\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sake,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maud demanded.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo be merciful.  What is it\nyou can do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can do it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I amended.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, nothing else than put the masts back\ninto the _Ghost_ and sail away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHumphrey!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she exclaimed.\n\nAnd I felt as proud of my conception as if it were already a fact\naccomplished.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut how is it possible to be done?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was my answer.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know only that I am capable of doing\nanything these days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI smiled proudly at her\u00e2\u0080\u0094too proudly, for she dropped her eyes and was for\nthe moment silent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut there is Captain Larsen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she objected.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBlind and helpless,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered promptly, waving him aside as a straw.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut those terrible hands of his!  You know how he leaped across the\nopening of the lazarette.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you know also how I crept about and avoided him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I contended gaily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd lost your shoes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hardly expect them to avoid Wolf Larsen without my feet inside of\nthem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe both laughed, and then went seriously to work constructing the plan\nwhereby we were to step the masts of the _Ghost_ and return to the world.\nI remembered hazily the physics of my school days, while the last few\nmonths had given me practical experience with mechanical purchases.  I\nmust say, though, when we walked down to the _Ghost_ to inspect more\nclosely the task before us, that the sight of the great masts lying in\nthe water almost disheartened me.  Where were we to begin?  If there had\nbeen one mast standing, something high up to which to fasten blocks and\ntackles!  But there was nothing.  It reminded me of the problem of\nlifting oneself by one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boot-straps.  I understood the mechanics of\nlevers; but where was I to get a fulcrum?\n\nThere was the mainmast, fifteen inches in diameter at what was now the\nbutt, still sixty-five feet in length, and weighing, I roughly\ncalculated, at least three thousand pounds.  And then came the foremast,\nlarger in diameter, and weighing surely thirty-five hundred pounds.\nWhere was I to begin?  Maud stood silently by my side, while I evolved in\nmy mind the contrivance known among sailors as \u00e2\u0080\u009cshears.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  But, though\nknown to sailors, I invented it there on Endeavour Island.  By crossing\nand lashing the ends of two spars, and then elevating them in the air\nlike an inverted \u00e2\u0080\u009cV,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I could get a point above the deck to which to make\nfast my hoisting tackle.  To this hoisting tackle I could, if necessary,\nattach a second hoisting tackle.  And then there was the windlass!\n\nMaud saw that I had achieved a solution, and her eyes warmed\nsympathetically.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you going to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cClear that raffle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered, pointing to the tangled wreckage\noverside.\n\nAh, the decisiveness, the very sound of the words, was good in my ears.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cClear that raffle!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Imagine so salty a phrase on the lips of the\nHumphrey Van Weyden of a few months gone!\n\nThere must have been a touch of the melodramatic in my pose and voice,\nfor Maud smiled.  Her appreciation of the ridiculous was keen, and in all\nthings she unerringly saw and felt, where it existed, the touch of sham,\nthe overshading, the overtone.  It was this which had given poise and\npenetration to her own work and made her of worth to the world.  The\nserious critic, with the sense of humour and the power of expression,\nmust inevitably command the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ear.  And so it was that she had\ncommanded.  Her sense of humour was really the artist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s instinct for\nproportion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard it before, somewhere, in books,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she murmured\ngleefully.\n\nI had an instinct for proportion myself, and I collapsed forthwith,\ndescending from the dominant pose of a master of matter to a state of\nhumble confusion which was, to say the least, very miserable.\n\nHer hand leapt out at once to mine.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so sorry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo need to be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I gulped.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt does me good.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too much of the\nschoolboy in me.  All of which is neither here nor there.  What we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got\nto do is actually and literally to clear that raffle.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come\nwith me in the boat, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to work and straighten things out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098When the topmen clear the raffle with their clasp-knives in their\nteeth,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d she quoted at me; and for the rest of the afternoon we made\nmerry over our labour.\n\nHer task was to hold the boat in position while I worked at the tangle.\nAnd such a tangle\u00e2\u0080\u0094halyards, sheets, guys, down-hauls, shrouds, stays, all\nwashed about and back and forth and through, and twined and knotted by\nthe sea.  I cut no more than was necessary, and what with passing the\nlong ropes under and around the booms and masts, of unreeving the\nhalyards and sheets, of coiling down in the boat and uncoiling in order\nto pass through another knot in the bight, I was soon wet to the skin.\n\nThe sails did require some cutting, and the canvas, heavy with water,\ntried my strength severely; but I succeeded before nightfall in getting\nit all spread out on the beach to dry.  We were both very tired when we\nknocked off for supper, and we had done good work, too, though to the eye\nit appeared insignificant.\n\nNext morning, with Maud as able assistant, I went into the hold of the\n_Ghost_ to clear the steps of the mast-butts.  We had no more than begun\nwork when the sound of my knocking and hammering brought Wolf Larsen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHello below!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried down the open hatch.\n\nThe sound of his voice made Maud quickly draw close to me, as for\nprotection, and she rested one hand on my arm while we parleyed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHello on deck,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-morning to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you doing down there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he demanded.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrying to scuttle my ship\nfor me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cQuite the opposite; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m repairing her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was my answer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what in thunder are you repairing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  There was puzzlement in his\nvoice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m getting everything ready for re-stepping the masts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied\neasily, as though it were the simplest project imaginable.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seems as though you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re standing on your own legs at last, Hump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d we\nheard him say; and then for some time he was silent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I say, Hump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he called down.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes, I can,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I retorted.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m doing it now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut this is my vessel, my particular property.  What if I forbid you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou forget,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are no longer the biggest bit of the\nferment.  You were, once, and able to eat me, as you were pleased to\nphrase it; but there has been a diminishing, and I am now able to eat\nyou.  The yeast has grown stale.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe gave a short, disagreeable laugh.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI see you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working my philosophy\nback on me for all it is worth.  But don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make the mistake of\nunder-estimating me.  For your own good I warn you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSince when have you become a philanthropist?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I queried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cConfess, now,\nin warning me for my own good, that you are very consistent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe ignored my sarcasm, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuppose I clap the hatch on, now?  You\nwon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fool me as you did in the lazarette.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWolf Larsen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said sternly, for the first time addressing him by this\nhis most familiar name, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am unable to shoot a helpless, unresisting\nman.  You have proved that to my satisfaction as well as yours.  But I\nwarn you now, and not so much for your own good as for mine, that I shall\nshoot you the moment you attempt a hostile act.  I can shoot you now, as\nI stand here; and if you are so minded, just go ahead and try to clap on\nthe hatch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNevertheless, I forbid you, I distinctly forbid your tampering with my\nship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, man!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I expostulated, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou advance the fact that it is your ship as\nthough it were a moral right.  You have never considered moral rights in\nyour dealings with others.  You surely do not dream that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll consider\nthem in dealing with you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI had stepped underneath the open hatchway so that I could see him.  The\nlack of expression on his face, so different from when I had watched him\nunseen, was enhanced by the unblinking, staring eyes.  It was not a\npleasant face to look upon.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd none so poor, not even Hump, to do him reverence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he sneered.\n\nThe sneer was wholly in his voice.  His face remained expressionless as\never.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you do, Miss Brewster,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said suddenly, after a pause.\n\nI started.  She had made no noise whatever, had not even moved.  Could it\nbe that some glimmer of vision remained to him? or that his vision was\ncoming back?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you do, Captain Larsen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cPray, how did you know I\nwas here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeard you breathing, of course.  I say, Hump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s improving, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you\nthink so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered, smiling at me.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have never seen him\notherwise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou should have seen him before, then.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWolf Larsen, in large doses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I murmured, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbefore and after taking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to tell you again, Hump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said threateningly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nbetter leave things alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you care to escape as well as we?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked incredulously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was his answer.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI intend dying here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I concluded defiantly, beginning again my knocking and\nhammering.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\n\nNext day, the mast-steps clear and everything in readiness, we started to\nget the two topmasts aboard.  The maintopmast was over thirty feet in\nlength, the foretopmast nearly thirty, and it was of these that I\nintended making the shears.  It was puzzling work.  Fastening one end of\na heavy tackle to the windlass, and with the other end fast to the butt\nof the foretopmast, I began to heave.  Maud held the turn on the windlass\nand coiled down the slack.\n\nWe were astonished at the ease with which the spar was lifted.  It was an\nimproved crank windlass, and the purchase it gave was enormous.  Of\ncourse, what it gave us in power we paid for in distance; as many times\nas it doubled my strength, that many times was doubled the length of rope\nI heaved in.  The tackle dragged heavily across the rail, increasing its\ndrag as the spar arose more and more out of the water, and the exertion\non the windlass grew severe.\n\nBut when the butt of the topmast was level with the rail, everything came\nto a standstill.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI might have known it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said impatiently.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow we have to do it all\nover again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy not fasten the tackle part way down the mast?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maud suggested.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I should have done at first,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered, hugely disgusted\nwith myself.\n\nSlipping off a turn, I lowered the mast back into the water and fastened\nthe tackle a third of the way down from the butt.  In an hour, what of\nthis and of rests between the heaving, I had hoisted it to the point\nwhere I could hoist no more.  Eight feet of the butt was above the rail,\nand I was as far away as ever from getting the spar on board.  I sat down\nand pondered the problem.  It did not take long.  I sprang jubilantly to\nmy feet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow I have it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI ought to make the tackle fast at the point\nof balance.  And what we learn of this will serve us with everything else\nwe have to hoist aboard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOnce again I undid all my work by lowering the mast into the water.  But\nI miscalculated the point of balance, so that when I heaved the top of\nthe mast came up instead of the butt.  Maud looked despair, but I laughed\nand said it would do just as well.\n\nInstructing her how to hold the turn and be ready to slack away at\ncommand, I laid hold of the mast with my hands and tried to balance it\ninboard across the rail.  When I thought I had it I cried to her to slack\naway; but the spar righted, despite my efforts, and dropped back toward\nthe water.  Again I heaved it up to its old position, for I had now\nanother idea.  I remembered the watch-tackle\u00e2\u0080\u0094a small double and single\nblock affair\u00e2\u0080\u0094and fetched it.\n\nWhile I was rigging it between the top of the spar and the opposite rail,\nWolf Larsen came on the scene.  We exchanged nothing more than\ngood-mornings, and, though he could not see, he sat on the rail out of\nthe way and followed by the sound all that I did.\n\nAgain instructing Maud to slack away at the windlass when I gave the\nword, I proceeded to heave on the watch-tackle.  Slowly the mast swung in\nuntil it balanced at right angles across the rail; and then I discovered\nto my amazement that there was no need for Maud to slack away.  In fact,\nthe very opposite was necessary.  Making the watch-tackle fast, I hove on\nthe windlass and brought in the mast, inch by inch, till its top tilted\ndown to the deck and finally its whole length lay on the deck.\n\nI looked at my watch.  It was twelve o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock.  My back was aching sorely,\nand I felt extremely tired and hungry.  And there on the deck was a\nsingle stick of timber to show for a whole morning\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work.  For the first\ntime I thoroughly realized the extent of the task before us.  But I was\nlearning, I was learning.  The afternoon would show far more\naccomplished.  And it did; for we returned at one o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, rested and\nstrengthened by a hearty dinner.\n\nIn less than an hour I had the maintopmast on deck and was constructing\nthe shears.  Lashing the two topmasts together, and making allowance for\ntheir unequal length, at the point of intersection I attached the double\nblock of the main throat-halyards.  This, with the single block and the\nthroat-halyards themselves, gave me a hoisting tackle.  To prevent the\nbutts of the masts from slipping on the deck, I nailed down thick cleats.\nEverything in readiness, I made a line fast to the apex of the shears and\ncarried it directly to the windlass.  I was growing to have faith in that\nwindlass, for it gave me power beyond all expectation.  As usual, Maud\nheld the turn while I heaved.  The shears rose in the air.\n\nThen I discovered I had forgotten guy-ropes.  This necessitated my\nclimbing the shears, which I did twice, before I finished guying it fore\nand aft and to either side.  Twilight had set in by the time this was\naccomplished.  Wolf Larsen, who had sat about and listened all afternoon\nand never opened his mouth, had taken himself off to the galley and\nstarted his supper.  I felt quite stiff across the small of the back, so\nmuch so that I straightened up with an effort and with pain.  I looked\nproudly at my work.  It was beginning to show.  I was wild with desire,\nlike a child with a new toy, to hoist something with my shears.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish it weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so late,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to see how it works.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a glutton, Humphrey,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maud chided me.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cRemember, to-morrow is\ncoming, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so tired now that you can hardly stand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, with sudden solicitude.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must be very tired.  You\nhave worked hard and nobly.  I am proud of you, Maud.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot half so proud as I am of you, nor with half the reason,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nanswered, looking me straight in the eyes for a moment with an expression\nin her own and a dancing, tremulous light which I had not seen before and\nwhich gave me a pang of quick delight, I know not why, for I did not\nunderstand it.  Then she dropped her eyes, to lift them again, laughing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf our friends could see us now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook at us.  Have you ever\npaused for a moment to consider our appearance?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I have considered yours, frequently,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered, puzzling over\nwhat I had seen in her eyes and puzzled by her sudden change of subject.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMercy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what do I look like, pray?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA scarecrow, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust glance at your draggled\nskirts, for instance.  Look at those three-cornered tears.  And such a\nwaist!  It would not require a Sherlock Holmes to deduce that you have\nbeen cooking over a camp-fire, to say nothing of trying out seal-blubber.\nAnd to cap it all, that cap!  And all that is the woman who wrote \u00e2\u0080\u0098A Kiss\nEndured.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe made me an elaborate and stately courtesy, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs for you,\nsir\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd yet, through the five minutes of banter which followed, there was a\nserious something underneath the fun which I could not but relate to the\nstrange and fleeting expression I had caught in her eyes.  What was it?\nCould it be that our eyes were speaking beyond the will of our speech?\nMy eyes had spoken, I knew, until I had found the culprits out and\nsilenced them.  This had occurred several times.  But had she seen the\nclamour in them and understood?  And had her eyes so spoken to me?  What\nelse could that expression have meant\u00e2\u0080\u0094that dancing, tremulous light, and\na something more which words could not describe.  And yet it could not\nbe.  It was impossible.  Besides, I was not skilled in the speech of\neyes.  I was only Humphrey Van Weyden, a bookish fellow who loved.  And\nto love, and to wait and win love, that surely was glorious enough for\nme.  And thus I thought, even as we chaffed each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appearance,\nuntil we arrived ashore and there were other things to think about.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shame, after working hard all day, that we cannot have an\nuninterrupted night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sleep,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I complained, after supper.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut there can be no danger now? from a blind man?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she queried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall never be able to trust him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I averred, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand far less now that\nhe is blind.  The liability is that his part helplessness will make him\nmore malignant than ever.  I know what I shall do to-morrow, the first\nthing\u00e2\u0080\u0094run out a light anchor and kedge the schooner off the beach.  And\neach night when we come ashore in the boat, Mr. Wolf Larsen will be left\na prisoner on board.  So this will be the last night we have to stand\nwatch, and because of that it will go the easier.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe were awake early and just finishing breakfast as daylight came.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Humphrey!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I heard Maud cry in dismay and suddenly stop.\n\nI looked at her.  She was gazing at the _Ghost_.  I followed her gaze,\nbut could see nothing unusual.  She looked at me, and I looked inquiry\nback.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe shears,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, and her voice trembled.\n\nI had forgotten their existence.  I looked again, but could not see them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf he has\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d I muttered savagely.\n\nShe put her hand sympathetically on mine, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will have to\nbegin over again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, believe me, my anger means nothing; I could not hurt a fly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\nsmiled back bitterly.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the worst of it is, he knows it.  You are\nright.  If he has destroyed the shears, I shall do nothing except begin\nover again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stand my watch on board hereafter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I blurted out a moment\nlater.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if he interferes\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I dare not stay ashore all night alone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maud was saying when I came\nback to myself.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would be so much nicer if he would be friendly with\nus and help us.  We could all live comfortably aboard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asserted, still savagely, for the destruction of my beloved\nshears had hit me hard.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is, you and I will live aboard, friendly\nor not with Wolf Larsen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s childish,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I laughed later, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor him to do such things, and for me\nto grow angry over them, for that matter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut my heart smote me when we climbed aboard and looked at the havoc he\nhad done.  The shears were gone altogether.  The guys had been slashed\nright and left.  The throat-halyards which I had rigged were cut across\nthrough every part.  And he knew I could not splice.  A thought struck\nme.  I ran to the windlass.  It would not work.  He had broken it.  We\nlooked at each other in consternation.  Then I ran to the side.  The\nmasts, booms, and gaffs I had cleared were gone.  He had found the lines\nwhich held them, and cast them adrift.\n\nTears were in Maud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes, and I do believe they were for me.  I could\nhave wept myself.  Where now was our project of remasting the _Ghost_?\nHe had done his work well.  I sat down on the hatch-combing and rested my\nchin on my hands in black despair.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe deserves to die,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried out; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand God forgive me, I am not man\nenough to be his executioner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Maud was by my side, passing her hand soothingly through my hair as\nthough I were a child, and saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere, there; it will all come right.\nWe are in the right, and it must come right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI remembered Michelet and leaned my head against her; and truly I became\nstrong again.  The blessed woman was an unfailing fount of power to me.\nWhat did it matter?  Only a set-back, a delay.  The tide could not have\ncarried the masts far to seaward, and there had been no wind.  It meant\nmerely more work to find them and tow them back.  And besides, it was a\nlesson.  I knew what to expect.  He might have waited and destroyed our\nwork more effectually when we had more accomplished.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere he comes now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she whispered.\n\nI glanced up.  He was strolling leisurely along the poop on the port\nside.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake no notice of him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I whispered.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming to see how we take\nit.  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let him know that we know.  We can deny him that satisfaction.\nTake off your shoes\u00e2\u0080\u0094that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right\u00e2\u0080\u0094and carry them in your hand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then we played hide-and-seek with the blind man.  As he came up the\nport side we slipped past on the starboard; and from the poop we watched\nhim turn and start aft on our track.\n\nHe must have known, somehow, that we were on board, for he said\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-morning\u00e2\u0080\u009d very confidently, and waited, for the greeting to be\nreturned.  Then he strolled aft, and we slipped forward.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re aboard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he called out, and I could see him listen\nintently after he had spoken.\n\nIt reminded me of the great hoot-owl, listening, after its booming cry,\nfor the stir of its frightened prey.  But we did not stir, and we moved\nonly when he moved.  And so we dodged about the deck, hand in hand, like\na couple of children chased by a wicked ogre, till Wolf Larsen, evidently\nin disgust, left the deck for the cabin.  There was glee in our eyes, and\nsuppressed titters in our mouths, as we put on our shoes and clambered\nover the side into the boat.  And as I looked into Maud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear brown\neyes I forgot the evil he had done, and I knew only that I loved her, and\nthat because of her the strength was mine to win our way back to the\nworld.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\n\nFor two days Maud and I ranged the sea and explored the beaches in search\nof the missing masts.  But it was not till the third day that we found\nthem, all of them, the shears included, and, of all perilous places, in\nthe pounding surf of the grim south-western promontory.  And how we\nworked!  At the dark end of the first day we returned, exhausted, to our\nlittle cove, towing the mainmast behind us.  And we had been compelled to\nrow, in a dead calm, practically every inch of the way.\n\nAnother day of heart-breaking and dangerous toil saw us in camp with the\ntwo topmasts to the good.  The day following I was desperate, and I\nrafted together the foremast, the fore and main booms, and the fore and\nmain gaffs.  The wind was favourable, and I had thought to tow them back\nunder sail, but the wind baffled, then died away, and our progress with\nthe oars was a snail\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pace.  And it was such dispiriting effort.  To\nthrow one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s whole strength and weight on the oars and to feel the boat\nchecked in its forward lunge by the heavy drag behind, was not exactly\nexhilarating.\n\nNight began to fall, and to make matters worse, the wind sprang up ahead.\nNot only did all forward motion cease, but we began to drift back and out\nto sea.  I struggled at the oars till I was played out.  Poor Maud, whom\nI could never prevent from working to the limit of her strength, lay\nweakly back in the stern-sheets.  I could row no more.  My bruised and\nswollen hands could no longer close on the oar handles.  My wrists and\narms ached intolerably, and though I had eaten heartily of a\ntwelve-o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock lunch, I had worked so hard that I was faint from hunger.\n\nI pulled in the oars and bent forward to the line which held the tow.\nBut Maud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand leaped out restrainingly to mine.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you going to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked in a strained, tense voice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCast it off,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered, slipping a turn of the rope.\n\nBut her fingers closed on mine.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she begged.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is useless,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere is night and the wind blowing us off\nthe land.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut think, Humphrey.  If we cannot sail away on the _Ghost_, we may\nremain for years on the island\u00e2\u0080\u0094for life even.  If it has never been\ndiscovered all these years, it may never be discovered.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou forget the boat we found on the beach,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I reminded her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a seal-hunting boat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand you know perfectly well\nthat if the men had escaped they would have been back to make their\nfortunes from the rookery.  You know they never escaped.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI remained silent, undecided.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBesides,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added haltingly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your idea, and I want to see you\nsucceed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNow I could harden my heart.  As soon as she put it on a flattering\npersonal basis, generosity compelled me to deny her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBetter years on the island than to die to-night, or to-morrow, or the\nnext day, in the open boat.  We are not prepared to brave the sea.  We\nhave no food, no water, no blankets, nothing.  Why, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d not survive the\nnight without blankets: I know how strong you are.  You are shivering\nnow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is only nervousness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am afraid you will cast off\nthe masts in spite of me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, please, please, Humphrey, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she burst out, a moment later.\n\nAnd so it ended, with the phrase she knew had all power over me.  We\nshivered miserably throughout the night.  Now and again I fitfully slept,\nbut the pain of the cold always aroused me.  How Maud could stand it was\nbeyond me.  I was too tired to thrash my arms about and warm myself, but\nI found strength time and again to chafe her hands and feet to restore\nthe circulation.  And still she pleaded with me not to cast off the\nmasts.  About three in the morning she was caught by a cold cramp, and\nafter I had rubbed her out of that she became quite numb.  I was\nfrightened.  I got out the oars and made her row, though she was so weak\nI thought she would faint at every stroke.\n\nMorning broke, and we looked long in the growing light for our island.\nAt last it showed, small and black, on the horizon, fully fifteen miles\naway.  I scanned the sea with my glasses.  Far away in the south-west I\ncould see a dark line on the water, which grew even as I looked at it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFair wind!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried in a husky voice I did not recognize as my own.\n\nMaud tried to reply, but could not speak.  Her lips were blue with cold,\nand she was hollow-eyed\u00e2\u0080\u0094but oh, how bravely her brown eyes looked at me!\nHow piteously brave!\n\nAgain I fell to chafing her hands and to moving her arms up and down and\nabout until she could thrash them herself.  Then I compelled her to stand\nup, and though she would have fallen had I not supported her, I forced\nher to walk back and forth the several steps between the thwart and the\nstern-sheets, and finally to spring up and down.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, you brave, brave woman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, when I saw the life coming back\ninto her face.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you know that you were brave?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never used to be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was never brave till I knew you.\nIt is you who have made me brave.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNor I, until I knew you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered.\n\nShe gave me a quick look, and again I caught that dancing, tremulous\nlight and something more in her eyes.  But it was only for the moment.\nThen she smiled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt must have been the conditions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; but I knew she was wrong,\nand I wondered if she likewise knew.  Then the wind came, fair and fresh,\nand the boat was soon labouring through a heavy sea toward the island.\nAt half-past three in the afternoon we passed the south-western\npromontory.  Not only were we hungry, but we were now suffering from\nthirst.  Our lips were dry and cracked, nor could we longer moisten them\nwith our tongues.  Then the wind slowly died down.  By night it was dead\ncalm and I was toiling once more at the oars\u00e2\u0080\u0094but weakly, most weakly.  At\ntwo in the morning the boat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bow touched the beach of our own inner cove\nand I staggered out to make the painter fast.  Maud could not stand, nor\nhad I strength to carry her.  I fell in the sand with her, and, when I\nhad recovered, contented myself with putting my hands under her shoulders\nand dragging her up the beach to the hut.\n\nThe next day we did no work.  In fact, we slept till three in the\nafternoon, or at least I did, for I awoke to find Maud cooking dinner.\nHer power of recuperation was wonderful.  There was something tenacious\nabout that lily-frail body of hers, a clutch on existence which one could\nnot reconcile with its patent weakness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know I was travelling to Japan for my health,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, as we\nlingered at the fire after dinner and delighted in the movelessness of\nloafing.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was not very strong.  I never was.  The doctors recommended\na sea voyage, and I chose the longest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou little knew what you were choosing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I laughed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I shall be a different women for the experience, as well as a\nstronger woman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand, I hope a better woman.  At least I\nshall understand a great deal more of life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, as the short day waned, we fell to discussing Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nblindness.  It was inexplicable.  And that it was grave, I instanced his\nstatement that he intended to stay and die on Endeavour Island.  When he,\nstrong man that he was, loving life as he did, accepted his death, it was\nplain that he was troubled by something more than mere blindness.  There\nhad been his terrific headaches, and we were agreed that it was some sort\nof brain break-down, and that in his attacks he endured pain beyond our\ncomprehension.\n\nI noticed as we talked over his condition, that Maud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sympathy went out\nto him more and more; yet I could not but love her for it, so sweetly\nwomanly was it.  Besides, there was no false sentiment about her feeling.\nShe was agreed that the most rigorous treatment was necessary if we were\nto escape, though she recoiled at the suggestion that I might some time\nbe compelled to take his life to save my own\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cour own,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she put it.\n\nIn the morning we had breakfast and were at work by daylight.  I found a\nlight kedge anchor in the fore-hold, where such things were kept; and\nwith a deal of exertion got it on deck and into the boat.  With a long\nrunning-line coiled down in the stem, I rowed well out into our little\ncove and dropped the anchor into the water.  There was no wind, the tide\nwas high, and the schooner floated.  Casting off the shore-lines, I\nkedged her out by main strength (the windlass being broken), till she\nrode nearly up and down to the small anchor\u00e2\u0080\u0094too small to hold her in any\nbreeze.  So I lowered the big starboard anchor, giving plenty of slack;\nand by afternoon I was at work on the windlass.\n\nThree days I worked on that windlass.  Least of all things was I a\nmechanic, and in that time I accomplished what an ordinary machinist\nwould have done in as many hours.  I had to learn my tools to begin with,\nand every simple mechanical principle which such a man would have at his\nfinger ends I had likewise to learn.  And at the end of three days I had\na windlass which worked clumsily.  It never gave the satisfaction the old\nwindlass had given, but it worked and made my work possible.\n\nIn half a day I got the two topmasts aboard and the shears rigged and\nguyed as before.  And that night I slept on board and on deck beside my\nwork.  Maud, who refused to stay alone ashore, slept in the forecastle.\nWolf Larsen had sat about, listening to my repairing the windlass and\ntalking with Maud and me upon indifferent subjects.  No reference was\nmade on either side to the destruction of the shears; nor did he say\nanything further about my leaving his ship alone.  But still I had feared\nhim, blind and helpless and listening, always listening, and I never let\nhis strong arms get within reach of me while I worked.\n\nOn this night, sleeping under my beloved shears, I was aroused by his\nfootsteps on the deck.  It was a starlight night, and I could see the\nbulk of him dimly as he moved about.  I rolled out of my blankets and\ncrept noiselessly after him in my stocking feet.  He had armed himself\nwith a draw-knife from the tool-locker, and with this he prepared to cut\nacross the throat-halyards I had again rigged to the shears.  He felt the\nhalyards with his hands and discovered that I had not made them fast.\nThis would not do for a draw-knife, so he laid hold of the running part,\nhove taut, and made fast.  Then he prepared to saw across with the\ndraw-knife.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, if I were you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said quietly.\n\nHe heard the click of my pistol and laughed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHello, Hump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew you were here all the time.  You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nfool my ears.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lie, Wolf Larsen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, just as quietly as before.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHowever, I am aching for a chance to kill you, so go ahead and cut.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have the chance always,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he sneered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo ahead and cut,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I threatened ominously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather disappoint you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he laughed, and turned on his heel and went\naft.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSomething must be done, Humphrey,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maud said, next morning, when I had\ntold her of the night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s occurrence.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf he has liberty, he may do\nanything.  He may sink the vessel, or set fire to it.  There is no\ntelling what he may do.  We must make him a prisoner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut how?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked, with a helpless shrug.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI dare not come within reach\nof his arms, and he knows that so long as his resistance is passive I\ncannot shoot him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere must be some way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she contended.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me think.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is one way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said grimly.\n\nShe waited.\n\nI picked up a seal-club.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t kill him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd before he could recover I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have him\nbound hard and fast.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe shook her head with a shudder.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, not that.  There must be some\nless brutal way.  Let us wait.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut we did not have to wait long, and the problem solved itself.  In the\nmorning, after several trials, I found the point of balance in the\nforemast and attached my hoisting tackle a few feet above it.  Maud held\nthe turn on the windlass and coiled down while I heaved.  Had the\nwindlass been in order it would not have been so difficult; as it was, I\nwas compelled to apply all my weight and strength to every inch of the\nheaving.  I had to rest frequently.  In truth, my spells of resting were\nlonger than those of working.  Maud even contrived, at times when all my\nefforts could not budge the windlass, to hold the turn with one hand and\nwith the other to throw the weight of her slim body to my assistance.\n\nAt the end of an hour the single and double blocks came together at the\ntop of the shears.  I could hoist no more.  And yet the mast was not\nswung entirely inboard.  The butt rested against the outside of the port\nrail, while the top of the mast overhung the water far beyond the\nstarboard rail.  My shears were too short.  All my work had been for\nnothing.  But I no longer despaired in the old way.  I was acquiring more\nconfidence in myself and more confidence in the possibilities of\nwindlasses, shears, and hoisting tackles.  There was a way in which it\ncould be done, and it remained for me to find that way.\n\nWhile I was considering the problem, Wolf Larsen came on deck.  We\nnoticed something strange about him at once.  The indecisiveness, or\nfeebleness, of his movements was more pronounced.  His walk was actually\ntottery as he came down the port side of the cabin.  At the break of the\npoop he reeled, raised one hand to his eyes with the familiar brushing\ngesture, and fell down the steps\u00e2\u0080\u0094still on his feet\u00e2\u0080\u0094to the main deck,\nacross which he staggered, falling and flinging out his arms for support.\nHe regained his balance by the steerage companion-way and stood there\ndizzily for a space, when he suddenly crumpled up and collapsed, his legs\nbending under him as he sank to the deck.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne of his attacks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I whispered to Maud.\n\nShe nodded her head; and I could see sympathy warm in her eyes.\n\nWe went up to him, but he seemed unconscious, breathing spasmodically.\nShe took charge of him, lifting his head to keep the blood out of it and\ndespatching me to the cabin for a pillow.  I also brought blankets, and\nwe made him comfortable.  I took his pulse.  It beat steadily and strong,\nand was quite normal.  This puzzled me.  I became suspicious.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat if he should be feigning this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked, still holding his wrist.\n\nMaud shook her head, and there was reproof in her eyes.  But just then\nthe wrist I held leaped from my hand, and the hand clasped like a steel\ntrap about my wrist.  I cried aloud in awful fear, a wild inarticulate\ncry; and I caught one glimpse of his face, malignant and triumphant, as\nhis other hand compassed my body and I was drawn down to him in a\nterrible grip.\n\nMy wrist was released, but his other arm, passed around my back, held\nboth my arms so that I could not move.  His free hand went to my throat,\nand in that moment I knew the bitterest foretaste of death earned by\none\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own idiocy.  Why had I trusted myself within reach of those\nterrible arms?  I could feel other hands at my throat.  They were Maud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhands, striving vainly to tear loose the hand that was throttling me.\nShe gave it up, and I heard her scream in a way that cut me to the soul,\nfor it was a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scream of fear and heart-breaking despair.  I had\nheard it before, during the sinking of the _Martinez_.\n\nMy face was against his chest and I could not see, but I heard Maud turn\nand run swiftly away along the deck.  Everything was happening quickly.\nI had not yet had a glimmering of unconsciousness, and it seemed that an\ninterminable period of time was lapsing before I heard her feet flying\nback.  And just then I felt the whole man sink under me.  The breath was\nleaving his lungs and his chest was collapsing under my weight.  Whether\nit was merely the expelled breath, or his consciousness of his growing\nimpotence, I know not, but his throat vibrated with a deep groan.  The\nhand at my throat relaxed.  I breathed.  It fluttered and tightened\nagain.  But even his tremendous will could not overcome the dissolution\nthat assailed it.  That will of his was breaking down.  He was fainting.\n\nMaud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s footsteps were very near as his hand fluttered for the last time\nand my throat was released.  I rolled off and over to the deck on my\nback, gasping and blinking in the sunshine.  Maud was pale but\ncomposed,\u00e2\u0080\u0094my eyes had gone instantly to her face,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and she was looking at\nme with mingled alarm and relief.  A heavy seal-club in her hand caught\nmy eyes, and at that moment she followed my gaze down to it.  The club\ndropped from her hand as though it had suddenly stung her, and at the\nsame moment my heart surged with a great joy.  Truly she was my woman, my\nmate-woman, fighting with me and for me as the mate of a caveman would\nhave fought, all the primitive in her aroused, forgetful of her culture,\nhard under the softening civilization of the only life she had ever\nknown.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDear woman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried, scrambling to my feet.\n\nThe next moment she was in my arms, weeping convulsively on my shoulder\nwhile I clasped her close.  I looked down at the brown glory of her hair,\nglinting gems in the sunshine far more precious to me than those in the\ntreasure-chests of kings.  And I bent my head and kissed her hair softly,\nso softly that she did not know.\n\nThen sober thought came to me.  After all, she was only a woman, crying\nher relief, now that the danger was past, in the arms of her protector or\nof the one who had been endangered.  Had I been father or brother, the\nsituation would have been in nowise different.  Besides, time and place\nwere not meet, and I wished to earn a better right to declare my love.\nSo once again I softly kissed her hair as I felt her receding from my\nclasp.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a real attack this time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said: \u00e2\u0080\u009canother shock like the one\nthat made him blind.  He feigned at first, and in doing so brought it\non.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMaud was already rearranging his pillow.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot yet.  Now that I have him helpless, helpless he shall\nremain.  From this day we live in the cabin.  Wolf Larsen shall live in\nthe steerage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI caught him under the shoulders and dragged him to the companion-way.\nAt my direction Maud fetched a rope.  Placing this under his shoulders, I\nbalanced him across the threshold and lowered him down the steps to the\nfloor.  I could not lift him directly into a bunk, but with Maud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s help I\nlifted first his shoulders and head, then his body, balanced him across\nthe edge, and rolled him into a lower bunk.\n\nBut this was not to be all.  I recollected the handcuffs in his\nstate-room, which he preferred to use on sailors instead of the ancient\nand clumsy ship irons.  So, when we left him, he lay handcuffed hand and\nfoot.  For the first time in many days I breathed freely.  I felt\nstrangely light as I came on deck, as though a weight had been lifted off\nmy shoulders.  I felt, also, that Maud and I had drawn more closely\ntogether.  And I wondered if she, too, felt it, as we walked along the\ndeck side by side to where the stalled foremast hung in the shears.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\n\nAt once we moved aboard the _Ghost_, occupying our old state-rooms and\ncooking in the galley.  The imprisonment of Wolf Larsen had happened most\nopportunely, for what must have been the Indian summer of this high\nlatitude was gone and drizzling stormy weather had set in.  We were very\ncomfortable, and the inadequate shears, with the foremast suspended from\nthem, gave a business-like air to the schooner and a promise of\ndeparture.\n\nAnd now that we had Wolf Larsen in irons, how little did we need it!\nLike his first attack, his second had been accompanied by serious\ndisablement.  Maud made the discovery in the afternoon while trying to\ngive him nourishment.  He had shown signs of consciousness, and she had\nspoken to him, eliciting no response.  He was lying on his left side at\nthe time, and in evident pain.  With a restless movement he rolled his\nhead around, clearing his left ear from the pillow against which it had\nbeen pressed.  At once he heard and answered her, and at once she came to\nme.\n\nPressing the pillow against his left ear, I asked him if he heard me, but\nhe gave no sign.  Removing the pillow and, repeating the question he\nanswered promptly that he did.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know you are deaf in the right ear?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered in a low, strong voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand worse than that.  My\nwhole right side is affected.  It seems asleep.  I cannot move arm or\nleg.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFeigning again?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I demanded angrily.\n\nHe shook his head, his stern mouth shaping the strangest, twisted smile.\nIt was indeed a twisted smile, for it was on the left side only, the\nfacial muscles of the right side moving not at all.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was the last play of the Wolf,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am paralysed.  I shall\nnever walk again.  Oh, only on the other side,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, as though\ndivining the suspicious glance I flung at his left leg, the knee of which\nhad just then drawn up, and elevated the blankets.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfortunate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d liked to have done for you first,\nHump.  And I thought I had that much left in me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut why?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked; partly in horror, partly out of curiosity.\n\nAgain his stern mouth framed the twisted smile, as he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, just to be alive, to be living and doing, to be the biggest bit of\nthe ferment to the end, to eat you.  But to die this way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders, or attempted to shrug them, rather, for the\nleft shoulder alone moved.  Like the smile, the shrug was twisted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut how can you account for it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is the seat of your\ntrouble?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe brain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said at once.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was those cursed headaches brought it\non.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSymptoms,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\nHe nodded his head.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no accounting for it.  I was never sick in\nmy life.  Something\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone wrong with my brain.  A cancer, a tumour, or\nsomething of that nature,\u00e2\u0080\u0094a thing that devours and destroys.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nattacking my nerve-centres, eating them up, bit by bit, cell by cell\u00e2\u0080\u0094from\nthe pain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe motor-centres, too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I suggested.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo it would seem; and the curse of it is that I must lie here,\nconscious, mentally unimpaired, knowing that the lines are going down,\nbreaking bit by bit communication with the world.  I cannot see, hearing\nand feeling are leaving me, at this rate I shall soon cease to speak; yet\nall the time I shall be here, alive, active, and powerless.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you say _you_ are here, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d suggest the likelihood of the soul,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\nsaid.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBosh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d was his retort.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt simply means that in the attack on my brain\nthe higher psychical centres are untouched.  I can remember, I can think\nand reason.  When that goes, I go.  I am not.  The soul?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe broke out in mocking laughter, then turned his left ear to the pillow\nas a sign that he wished no further conversation.\n\nMaud and I went about our work oppressed by the fearful fate which had\novertaken him,\u00e2\u0080\u0094how fearful we were yet fully to realize.  There was the\nawfulness of retribution about it.  Our thoughts were deep and solemn,\nand we spoke to each other scarcely above whispers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou might remove the handcuffs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said that night, as we stood in\nconsultation over him.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dead safe.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a paralytic now.  The next\nthing to watch out for is bed sores.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe smiled his twisted smile, and Maud, her eyes wide with horror, was\ncompelled to turn away her head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know that your smile is crooked?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked him; for I knew that\nshe must attend him, and I wished to save her as much as possible.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen I shall smile no more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said calmly.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought something was\nwrong.  My right cheek has been numb all day.  Yes, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had warnings\nof this for the last three days; by spells, my right side seemed going to\nsleep, sometimes arm or hand, sometimes leg or foot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo my smile is crooked?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he queried a short while after.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\nconsider henceforth that I smile internally, with my soul, if you please,\nmy soul.  Consider that I am smiling now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd for the space of several minutes he lay there, quiet, indulging his\ngrotesque fancy.\n\nThe man of him was not changed.  It was the old, indomitable, terrible\nWolf Larsen, imprisoned somewhere within that flesh which had once been\nso invincible and splendid.  Now it bound him with insentient fetters,\nwalling his soul in darkness and silence, blocking it from the world\nwhich to him had been a riot of action.  No more would he conjugate the\nverb \u00e2\u0080\u009cto do in every mood and tense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be\u00e2\u0080\u009d was all that remained to\nhim\u00e2\u0080\u0094to be, as he had defined death, without movement; to will, but not to\nexecute; to think and reason and in the spirit of him to be as alive as\never, but in the flesh to be dead, quite dead.\n\nAnd yet, though I even removed the handcuffs, we could not adjust\nourselves to his condition.  Our minds revolted.  To us he was full of\npotentiality.  We knew not what to expect of him next, what fearful\nthing, rising above the flesh, he might break out and do.  Our experience\nwarranted this state of mind, and we went about our work with anxiety\nalways upon us.\n\nI had solved the problem which had arisen through the shortness of the\nshears.  By means of the watch-tackle (I had made a new one), I heaved\nthe butt of the foremast across the rail and then lowered it to the deck.\nNext, by means of the shears, I hoisted the main boom on board.  Its\nforty feet of length would supply the height necessary properly to swing\nthe mast.  By means of a secondary tackle I had attached to the shears, I\nswung the boom to a nearly perpendicular position, then lowered the butt\nto the deck, where, to prevent slipping, I spiked great cleats around it.\nThe single block of my original shears-tackle I had attached to the end\nof the boom.  Thus, by carrying this tackle to the windlass, I could\nraise and lower the end of the boom at will, the butt always remaining\nstationary, and, by means of guys, I could swing the boom from side to\nside.  To the end of the boom I had likewise rigged a hoisting tackle;\nand when the whole arrangement was completed I could not but be startled\nby the power and latitude it gave me.\n\nOf course, two days\u00e2\u0080\u0099 work was required for the accomplishment of this\npart of my task, and it was not till the morning of the third day that I\nswung the foremast from the deck and proceeded to square its butt to fit\nthe step.  Here I was especially awkward.  I sawed and chopped and\nchiselled the weathered wood till it had the appearance of having been\ngnawed by some gigantic mouse.  But it fitted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will work, I know it will work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know Dr. Jordan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s final test of truth?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maud asked.\n\nI shook my head and paused in the act of dislodging the shavings which\nhad drifted down my neck.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan we make it work?  Can we trust our lives to it? is the test.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is a favourite of yours,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I dismantled my old Pantheon and cast out Napoleon and C\u00c3\u00a6sar and\ntheir fellows, I straightway erected a new Pantheon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered\ngravely, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand the first I installed was Dr. Jordan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA modern hero.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd a greater because modern,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can the Old World heroes\ncompare with ours?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI shook my head.  We were too much alike in many things for argument.\nOur points of view and outlook on life at least were very alike.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor a pair of critics we agree famously,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I laughed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd as shipwright and able assistant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she laughed back.\n\nBut there was little time for laughter in those days, what of our heavy\nwork and of the awfulness of Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s living death.\n\nHe had received another stroke.  He had lost his voice, or he was losing\nit.  He had only intermittent use of it.  As he phrased it, the wires\nwere like the stock market, now up, now down.  Occasionally the wires\nwere up and he spoke as well as ever, though slowly and heavily.  Then\nspeech would suddenly desert him, in the middle of a sentence perhaps,\nand for hours, sometimes, we would wait for the connection to be\nre-established.  He complained of great pain in his head, and it was\nduring this period that he arranged a system of communication against the\ntime when speech should leave him altogether\u00e2\u0080\u0094one pressure of the hand for\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cyes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d two for \u00e2\u0080\u009cno.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  It was well that it was arranged, for by evening\nhis voice had gone from him.  By hand pressures, after that, he answered\nour questions, and when he wished to speak he scrawled his thoughts with\nhis left hand, quite legibly, on a sheet of paper.\n\nThe fierce winter had now descended upon us.  Gale followed gale, with\nsnow and sleet and rain.  The seals had started on their great southern\nmigration, and the rookery was practically deserted.  I worked\nfeverishly.  In spite of the bad weather, and of the wind which\nespecially hindered me, I was on deck from daylight till dark and making\nsubstantial progress.\n\nI profited by my lesson learned through raising the shears and then\nclimbing them to attach the guys.  To the top of the foremast, which was\njust lifted conveniently from the deck, I attached the rigging, stays and\nthroat and peak halyards.  As usual, I had underrated the amount of work\ninvolved in this portion of the task, and two long days were necessary to\ncomplete it.  And there was so much yet to be done\u00e2\u0080\u0094the sails, for\ninstance, which practically had to be made over.\n\nWhile I toiled at rigging the foremast, Maud sewed on canvas, ready\nalways to drop everything and come to my assistance when more hands than\ntwo were required.  The canvas was heavy and hard, and she sewed with the\nregular sailor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s palm and three-cornered sail-needle.  Her hands were\nsoon sadly blistered, but she struggled bravely on, and in addition doing\nthe cooking and taking care of the sick man.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA fig for superstition,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said on Friday morning.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat mast goes in\nto-day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEverything was ready for the attempt.  Carrying the boom-tackle to the\nwindlass, I hoisted the mast nearly clear of the deck.  Making this\ntackle fast, I took to the windlass the shears-tackle (which was\nconnected with the end of the boom), and with a few turns had the mast\nperpendicular and clear.\n\nMaud clapped her hands the instant she was relieved from holding the\nturn, crying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt works!  It works!  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll trust our lives to it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen she assumed a rueful expression.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not over the hole,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she add.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you have to begin all over?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI smiled in superior fashion, and, slacking off on one of the boom-guys\nand taking in on the other, swung the mast perfectly in the centre of the\ndeck.  Still it was not over the hole.  Again the rueful expression came\non her face, and again I smiled in a superior way.  Slacking away on the\nboom-tackle and hoisting an equivalent amount on the shears-tackle, I\nbrought the butt of the mast into position directly over the hole in the\ndeck.  Then I gave Maud careful instructions for lowering away and went\ninto the hold to the step on the schooner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bottom.\n\nI called to her, and the mast moved easily and accurately.  Straight\ntoward the square hole of the step the square butt descended; but as it\ndescended it slowly twisted so that square would not fit into square.\nBut I had not even a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s indecision.  Calling to Maud to cease\nlowering, I went on deck and made the watch-tackle fast to the mast with\na rolling hitch.  I left Maud to pull on it while I went below.  By the\nlight of the lantern I saw the butt twist slowly around till its sides\ncoincided with the sides of the step.  Maud made fast and returned to the\nwindlass.  Slowly the butt descended the several intervening inches, at\nthe same time slightly twisting again.  Again Maud rectified the twist\nwith the watch-tackle, and again she lowered away from the windlass.\nSquare fitted into square.  The mast was stepped.\n\nI raised a shout, and she ran down to see.  In the yellow lantern light\nwe peered at what we had accomplished.  We looked at each other, and our\nhands felt their way and clasped.  The eyes of both of us, I think, were\nmoist with the joy of success.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was done so easily after all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I remarked.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll the work was in the\npreparation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd all the wonder in the completion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maud added.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can scarcely\nbring myself to realize that that great mast is really up and in; that\nyou have lifted it from the water, swung it through the air, and\ndeposited it here where it belongs.  It is a Titan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s task.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd they made themselves many inventions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I began merrily, then paused\nto sniff the air.\n\nI looked hastily at the lantern.  It was not smoking.  Again I sniffed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSomething is burning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maud said, with sudden conviction.\n\nWe sprang together for the ladder, but I raced past her to the deck.  A\ndense volume of smoke was pouring out of the steerage companion-way.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Wolf is not yet dead,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I muttered to myself as I sprang down through\nthe smoke.\n\nIt was so thick in the confined space that I was compelled to feel my\nway; and so potent was the spell of Wolf Larsen on my imagination, I was\nquite prepared for the helpless giant to grip my neck in a strangle hold.\nI hesitated, the desire to race back and up the steps to the deck almost\noverpowering me.  Then I recollected Maud.  The vision of her, as I had\nlast seen her, in the lantern light of the schooner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hold, her brown\neyes warm and moist with joy, flashed before me, and I knew that I could\nnot go back.\n\nI was choking and suffocating by the time I reached Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bunk.\nI reached my hand and felt for his.  He was lying motionless, but moved\nslightly at the touch of my hand.  I felt over and under his blankets.\nThere was no warmth, no sign of fire.  Yet that smoke which blinded me\nand made me cough and gasp must have a source.  I lost my head\ntemporarily and dashed frantically about the steerage.  A collision with\nthe table partially knocked the wind from my body and brought me to\nmyself.  I reasoned that a helpless man could start a fire only near to\nwhere he lay.\n\nI returned to Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bunk.  There I encountered Maud.  How long\nshe had been there in that suffocating atmosphere I could not guess.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo up on deck!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I commanded peremptorily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, Humphrey\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d she began to protest in a queer, husky voice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease! please!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I shouted at her harshly.\n\nShe drew away obediently, and then I thought, What if she cannot find the\nsteps?  I started after her, to stop at the foot of the companion-way.\nPerhaps she had gone up.  As I stood there, hesitant, I heard her cry\nsoftly:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Humphrey, I am lost.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI found her fumbling at the wall of the after bulkhead, and, half leading\nher, half carrying her, I took her up the companion-way.  The pure air\nwas like nectar.  Maud was only faint and dizzy, and I left her lying on\nthe deck when I took my second plunge below.\n\nThe source of the smoke must be very close to Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0094my mind was\nmade up to this, and I went straight to his bunk.  As I felt about among\nhis blankets, something hot fell on the back of my hand.  It burned me,\nand I jerked my hand away.  Then I understood.  Through the cracks in the\nbottom of the upper bunk he had set fire to the mattress.  He still\nretained sufficient use of his left arm to do this.  The damp straw of\nthe mattress, fired from beneath and denied air, had been smouldering all\nthe while.\n\nAs I dragged the mattress out of the bunk it seemed to disintegrate in\nmid-air, at the same time bursting into flames.  I beat out the burning\nremnants of straw in the bunk, then made a dash for the deck for fresh\nair.\n\nSeveral buckets of water sufficed to put out the burning mattress in the\nmiddle of the steerage floor; and ten minutes later, when the smoke had\nfairly cleared, I allowed Maud to come below.  Wolf Larsen was\nunconscious, but it was a matter of minutes for the fresh air to restore\nhim.  We were working over him, however, when he signed for paper and\npencil.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPray do not interrupt me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am smiling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am still a bit of the ferment, you see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote a little later.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am glad you are as small a bit as you are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut just think of how much smaller I shall be\nbefore I die.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd yet I am all here, Hump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote with a final flourish.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\nthink more clearly than ever in my life before.  Nothing to disturb me.\nConcentration is perfect.  I am all here and more than here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was like a message from the night of the grave; for this man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body\nhad become his mausoleum.  And there, in so strange sepulchre, his spirit\nfluttered and lived.  It would flutter and live till the last line of\ncommunication was broken, and after that who was to say how much longer\nit might continue to flutter and live?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think my left side is going,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolf Larsen wrote, the morning after his\nattempt to fire the ship.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe numbness is growing.  I can hardly move\nmy hand.  You will have to speak louder.  The last lines are going down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you in pain?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\nI was compelled to repeat my question loudly before he answered:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot all the time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe left hand stumbled slowly and painfully across the paper, and it was\nwith extreme difficulty that we deciphered the scrawl.  It was like a\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cspirit message,\u00e2\u0080\u009d such as are delivered at s\u00c3\u00a9ances of spiritualists for a\ndollar admission.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I am still here, all here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the hand scrawled more slowly and\npainfully than ever.\n\nThe pencil dropped, and we had to replace it in the hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen there is no pain I have perfect peace and quiet.  I have never\nthought so clearly.  I can ponder life and death like a Hindoo sage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd immortality?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maud queried loudly in the ear.\n\nThree times the hand essayed to write but fumbled hopelessly.  The pencil\nfell.  In vain we tried to replace it.  The fingers could not close on\nit.  Then Maud pressed and held the fingers about the pencil with her own\nhand and the hand wrote, in large letters, and so slowly that the minutes\nticked off to each letter:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cB-O-S-H.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last word, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbosh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d sceptical and invincible to the\nend.  The arm and hand relaxed.  The trunk of the body moved slightly.\nThen there was no movement.  Maud released the hand.  The fingers spread\nslightly, falling apart of their own weight, and the pencil rolled away.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you still hear?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I shouted, holding the fingers and waiting for the\nsingle pressure which would signify \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  There was no response.  The\nhand was dead.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI noticed the lips slightly move,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maud said.\n\nI repeated the question.  The lips moved.  She placed the tips of her\nfingers on them.  Again I repeated the question.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maud announced.\nWe looked at each other expectantly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat good is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat can we say now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, ask him\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe hesitated.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAsk him something that requires no for an answer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I suggested.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen\nwe will know for certainty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you hungry?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.\n\nThe lips moved under her fingers, and she answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you have some beef?\u00e2\u0080\u009d was her next query.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she announced.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBeef-tea?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, he will have some beef-tea,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, quietly, looking up at me.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUntil his hearing goes we shall be able to communicate with him.  And\nafter that\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe looked at me queerly.  I saw her lips trembling and the tears\nswimming up in her eyes.  She swayed toward me and I caught her in my\narms.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Humphrey,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she sobbed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen will it all end?  I am so tired, so\ntired.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe buried her head on my shoulder, her frail form shaken with a storm of\nweeping.  She was like a feather in my arms, so slender, so ethereal.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe has broken down at last,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I thought.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat can I do without her\nhelp?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut I soothed and comforted her, till she pulled herself bravely together\nand recuperated mentally as quickly as she was wont to do physically.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI ought to be ashamed of myself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.  Then added, with the\nwhimsical smile I adored, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I am only one, small woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThat phrase, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cone small woman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d startled me like an electric shock.\nIt was my own phrase, my pet, secret phrase, my love phrase for her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere did you get that phrase?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I demanded, with an abruptness that in\nturn startled her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat phrase?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne small woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it yours?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMine.  I made it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you must have talked in your sleep,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she smiled.\n\nThe dancing, tremulous light was in her eyes.  Mine, I knew, were\nspeaking beyond the will of my speech.  I leaned toward her.  Without\nvolition I leaned toward her, as a tree is swayed by the wind.  Ah, we\nwere very close together in that moment.  But she shook her head, as one\nmight shake off sleep or a dream, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have known it all my life.  It was my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name for my mother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is my phrase too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said stubbornly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor your mother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered, and she questioned no further, though I could have\nsworn her eyes retained for some time a mocking, teasing expression.\n\nWith the foremast in, the work now went on apace.  Almost before I knew\nit, and without one serious hitch, I had the mainmast stepped.  A\nderrick-boom, rigged to the foremast, had accomplished this; and several\ndays more found all stays and shrouds in place, and everything set up\ntaut.  Topsails would be a nuisance and a danger for a crew of two, so I\nheaved the topmasts on deck and lashed them fast.\n\nSeveral more days were consumed in finishing the sails and putting them\non.  There were only three\u00e2\u0080\u0094the jib, foresail, and mainsail; and, patched,\nshortened, and distorted, they were a ridiculously ill-fitting suit for\nso trim a craft as the _Ghost_.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll work!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maud cried jubilantly.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make them work, and\ntrust our lives to them!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCertainly, among my many new trades, I shone least as a sail-maker.  I\ncould sail them better than make them, and I had no doubt of my power to\nbring the schooner to some northern port of Japan.  In fact, I had\ncrammed navigation from text-books aboard; and besides, there was Wolf\nLarsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s star-scale, so simple a device that a child could work it.\n\nAs for its inventor, beyond an increasing deafness and the movement of\nthe lips growing fainter and fainter, there had been little change in his\ncondition for a week.  But on the day we finished bending the schooner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsails, he heard his last, and the last movement of his lips died away\u00e2\u0080\u0094but\nnot before I had asked him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you all there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the lips had\nanswered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe last line was down.  Somewhere within that tomb of the flesh still\ndwelt the soul of the man.  Walled by the living clay, that fierce\nintelligence we had known burned on; but it burned on in silence and\ndarkness.  And it was disembodied.  To that intelligence there could be\nno objective knowledge of a body.  It knew no body.  The very world was\nnot.  It knew only itself and the vastness and profundity of the quiet\nand the dark.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\n\nThe day came for our departure.  There was no longer anything to detain\nus on Endeavour Island.  The _Ghost\u00e2\u0080\u0099s_ stumpy masts were in place, her\ncrazy sails bent.  All my handiwork was strong, none of it beautiful; but\nI knew that it would work, and I felt myself a man of power as I looked\nat it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did it!  I did it!  With my own hands I did it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I wanted to cry\naloud.\n\nBut Maud and I had a way of voicing each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thoughts, and she said,\nas we prepared to hoist the mainsail:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo think, Humphrey, you did it all with your own hands?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut there were two other hands,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwo small hands, and\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say that was a phrase, also, of your father.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe laughed and shook her head, and held her hands up for inspection.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can never get them clean again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she wailed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnor soften the\nweather-beat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen dirt and weather-beat shall be your guerdon of honour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said,\nholding them in mine; and, spite of my resolutions, I would have kissed\nthe two dear hands had she not swiftly withdrawn them.\n\nOur comradeship was becoming tremulous, I had mastered my love long and\nwell, but now it was mastering me.  Wilfully had it disobeyed and won my\neyes to speech, and now it was winning my tongue\u00e2\u0080\u0094ay, and my lips, for\nthey were mad this moment to kiss the two small hands which had toiled so\nfaithfully and hard.  And I, too, was mad.  There was a cry in my being\nlike bugles calling me to her.  And there was a wind blowing upon me\nwhich I could not resist, swaying the very body of me till I leaned\ntoward her, all unconscious that I leaned.  And she knew it.  She could\nnot but know it as she swiftly drew away her hands, and yet, could not\nforbear one quick searching look before she turned away her eyes.\n\nBy means of deck-tackles I had arranged to carry the halyards forward to\nthe windlass; and now I hoisted the mainsail, peak and throat, at the\nsame time.  It was a clumsy way, but it did not take long, and soon the\nforesail as well was up and fluttering.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can never get that anchor up in this narrow place, once it has left\nthe bottom,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe should be on the rocks first.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat can you do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSlip it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was my answer.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd when I do, you must do your first work on\nthe windlass.  I shall have to run at once to the wheel, and at the same\ntime you must be hoisting the jib.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis man\u00c5\u0093uvre of getting under way I had studied and worked out a score\nof times; and, with the jib-halyard to the windlass, I knew Maud was\ncapable of hoisting that most necessary sail.  A brisk wind was blowing\ninto the cove, and though the water was calm, rapid work was required to\nget us safely out.\n\nWhen I knocked the shackle-bolt loose, the chain roared out through the\nhawse-hole and into the sea.  I raced aft, putting the wheel up.  The\n_Ghost_ seemed to start into life as she heeled to the first fill of her\nsails.  The jib was rising.  As it filled, the _Ghost\u00e2\u0080\u0099s_ bow swung off\nand I had to put the wheel down a few spokes and steady her.\n\nI had devised an automatic jib-sheet which passed the jib across of\nitself, so there was no need for Maud to attend to that; but she was\nstill hoisting the jib when I put the wheel hard down.  It was a moment\nof anxiety, for the _Ghost_ was rushing directly upon the beach, a\nstone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s throw distant.  But she swung obediently on her heel into the\nwind.  There was a great fluttering and flapping of canvas and\nreef-points, most welcome to my ears, then she filled away on the other\ntack.\n\nMaud had finished her task and come aft, where she stood beside me, a\nsmall cap perched on her wind-blown hair, her cheeks flushed from\nexertion, her eyes wide and bright with the excitement, her nostrils\nquivering to the rush and bite of the fresh salt air.  Her brown eyes\nwere like a startled deer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  There was a wild, keen look in them I had\nnever seen before, and her lips parted and her breath suspended as the\n_Ghost_, charging upon the wall of rock at the entrance to the inner\ncove, swept into the wind and filled away into safe water.\n\nMy first mate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s berth on the sealing grounds stood me in good stead, and\nI cleared the inner cove and laid a long tack along the shore of the\nouter cove.  Once again about, and the _Ghost_ headed out to open sea.\nShe had now caught the bosom-breathing of the ocean, and was herself\na-breath with the rhythm of it as she smoothly mounted and slipped down\neach broad-backed wave.  The day had been dull and overcast, but the sun\nnow burst through the clouds, a welcome omen, and shone upon the curving\nbeach where together we had dared the lords of the harem and slain the\nholluschickie.  All Endeavour Island brightened under the sun.  Even the\ngrim south-western promontory showed less grim, and here and there, where\nthe sea-spray wet its surface, high lights flashed and dazzled in the\nsun.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall always think of it with pride,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said to Maud.\n\nShe threw her head back in a queenly way but said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDear, dear Endeavour\nIsland!  I shall always love it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said quickly.\n\nIt seemed our eyes must meet in a great understanding, and yet, loath,\nthey struggled away and did not meet.\n\nThere was a silence I might almost call awkward, till I broke it, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSee those black clouds to windward.  You remember, I told you last night\nthe barometer was falling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the sun is gone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, her eyes still fixed upon our island,\nwhere we had proved our mastery over matter and attained to the truest\ncomradeship that may fall to man and woman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slack off the sheets for Japan!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried gaily.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cA fair wind\nand a flowing sheet, you know, or however it goes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLashing the wheel I ran forward, eased the fore and mainsheets, took in\non the boom-tackles and trimmed everything for the quartering breeze\nwhich was ours.  It was a fresh breeze, very fresh, but I resolved to run\nas long as I dared.  Unfortunately, when running free, it is impossible\nto lash the wheel, so I faced an all-night watch.  Maud insisted on\nrelieving me, but proved that she had not the strength to steer in a\nheavy sea, even if she could have gained the wisdom on such short notice.\nShe appeared quite heart-broken over the discovery, but recovered her\nspirits by coiling down tackles and halyards and all stray ropes.  Then\nthere were meals to be cooked in the galley, beds to make, Wolf Larsen to\nbe attended upon, and she finished the day with a grand house-cleaning\nattack upon the cabin and steerage.\n\nAll night I steered, without relief, the wind slowly and steadily\nincreasing and the sea rising.  At five in the morning Maud brought me\nhot coffee and biscuits she had baked, and at seven a substantial and\npiping hot breakfast put new lift into me.\n\nThroughout the day, and as slowly and steadily as ever, the wind\nincreased.  It impressed one with its sullen determination to blow, and\nblow harder, and keep on blowing.  And still the _Ghost_ foamed along,\nracing off the miles till I was certain she was making at least eleven\nknots.  It was too good to lose, but by nightfall I was exhausted.\nThough in splendid physical trim, a thirty-six-hour trick at the wheel\nwas the limit of my endurance.  Besides, Maud begged me to heave to, and\nI knew, if the wind and sea increased at the same rate during the night,\nthat it would soon be impossible to heave to.  So, as twilight deepened,\ngladly and at the same time reluctantly, I brought the _Ghost_ up on the\nwind.\n\nBut I had not reckoned upon the colossal task the reefing of three sails\nmeant for one man.  While running away from the wind I had not\nappreciated its force, but when we ceased to run I learned to my sorrow,\nand well-nigh to my despair, how fiercely it was really blowing.  The\nwind balked my every effort, ripping the canvas out of my hands and in an\ninstant undoing what I had gained by ten minutes of severest struggle.\nAt eight o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock I had succeeded only in putting the second reef into the\nforesail.  At eleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock I was no farther along.  Blood dripped from\nevery finger-end, while the nails were broken to the quick.  From pain\nand sheer exhaustion I wept in the darkness, secretly, so that Maud\nshould not know.\n\nThen, in desperation, I abandoned the attempt to reef the mainsail and\nresolved to try the experiment of heaving to under the close-reefed\nforesail.  Three hours more were required to gasket the mainsail and jib,\nand at two in the morning, nearly dead, the life almost buffeted and\nworked out of me, I had barely sufficient consciousness to know the\nexperiment was a success.  The close-reefed foresail worked.  The _Ghost_\nclung on close to the wind and betrayed no inclination to fall off\nbroadside to the trough.\n\nI was famished, but Maud tried vainly to get me to eat.  I dozed with my\nmouth full of food.  I would fall asleep in the act of carrying food to\nmy mouth and waken in torment to find the act yet uncompleted.  So\nsleepily helpless was I that she was compelled to hold me in my chair to\nprevent my being flung to the floor by the violent pitching of the\nschooner.\n\nOf the passage from the galley to the cabin I knew nothing.  It was a\nsleep-walker Maud guided and supported.  In fact, I was aware of nothing\ntill I awoke, how long after I could not imagine, in my bunk with my\nboots off.  It was dark.  I was stiff and lame, and cried out with pain\nwhen the bed-clothes touched my poor finger-ends.\n\nMorning had evidently not come, so I closed my eyes and went to sleep\nagain.  I did not know it, but I had slept the clock around and it was\nnight again.\n\nOnce more I woke, troubled because I could sleep no better.  I struck a\nmatch and looked at my watch.  It marked midnight.  And I had not left\nthe deck until three!  I should have been puzzled had I not guessed the\nsolution.  No wonder I was sleeping brokenly.  I had slept twenty-one\nhours.  I listened for a while to the behaviour of the _Ghost_, to the\npounding of the seas and the muffled roar of the wind on deck, and then\nturned over on my side and slept peacefully until morning.\n\nWhen I arose at seven I saw no sign of Maud and concluded she was in the\ngalley preparing breakfast.  On deck I found the _Ghost_ doing splendidly\nunder her patch of canvas.  But in the galley, though a fire was burning\nand water boiling, I found no Maud.\n\nI discovered her in the steerage, by Wolf Larsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bunk.  I looked at\nhim, the man who had been hurled down from the topmost pitch of life to\nbe buried alive and be worse than dead.  There seemed a relaxation of his\nexpressionless face which was new.  Maud looked at me and I understood.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis life flickered out in the storm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut he still lives,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered, infinite faith in her voice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe had too great strength.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut now it no longer shackles him.  He is a free\nspirit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is a free spirit surely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered; and, taking her hand, I led her\non deck.\n\nThe storm broke that night, which is to say that it diminished as slowly\nas it had arisen.  After breakfast next morning, when I had hoisted Wolf\nLarsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body on deck ready for burial, it was still blowing heavily and\na large sea was running.  The deck was continually awash with the sea\nwhich came inboard over the rail and through the scuppers.  The wind\nsmote the schooner with a sudden gust, and she heeled over till her lee\nrail was buried, the roar in her rigging rising in pitch to a shriek.  We\nstood in the water to our knees as I bared my head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI remember only one part of the service,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand that is, \u00e2\u0080\u0098And the\nbody shall be cast into the sea.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMaud looked at me, surprised and shocked; but the spirit of something I\nhad seen before was strong upon me, impelling me to give service to Wolf\nLarsen as Wolf Larsen had once given service to another man.  I lifted\nthe end of the hatch cover and the canvas-shrouded body slipped feet\nfirst into the sea.  The weight of iron dragged it down.  It was gone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-bye, Lucifer, proud spirit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maud whispered, so low that it was\ndrowned by the shouting of the wind; but I saw the movement of her lips\nand knew.\n\nAs we clung to the lee rail and worked our way aft, I happened to glance\nto leeward.  The _Ghost_, at the moment, was uptossed on a sea, and I\ncaught a clear view of a small steamship two or three miles away, rolling\nand pitching, head on to the sea, as it steamed toward us.  It was\npainted black, and from the talk of the hunters of their poaching\nexploits I recognized it as a United States revenue cutter.  I pointed it\nout to Maud and hurriedly led her aft to the safety of the poop.\n\nI started to rush below to the flag-locker, then remembered that in\nrigging the _Ghost_.  I had forgotten to make provision for a\nflag-halyard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need no distress signal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maud said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have only to see us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are saved,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, soberly and solemnly.  And then, in an exuberance\nof joy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hardly know whether to be glad or not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI looked at her.  Our eyes were not loath to meet.  We leaned toward each\nother, and before I knew it my arms were about her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNeed I?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\nAnd she answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no need, though the telling of it would be\nsweet, so sweet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHer lips met the press of mine, and, by what strange trick of the\nimagination I know not, the scene in the cabin of the _Ghost_ flashed\nupon me, when she had pressed her fingers lightly on my lips and said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHush, hush.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy woman, my one small woman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, my free hand petting her shoulder\nin the way all lovers know though never learn in school.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, looking at me for an instant with tremulous lids\nwhich fluttered down and veiled her eyes as she snuggled her head against\nmy breast with a happy little sigh.\n\nI looked toward the cutter.  It was very close.  A boat was being\nlowered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne kiss, dear love,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I whispered.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne kiss more before they come.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd rescue us from ourselves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she completed, with a most adorable\nsmile, whimsical as I had never seen it, for it was whimsical with love.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n                                 THE END\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n        PRINTED IN GREAT BRITAIN BY RICHARD CLAY & SONS, LIMITED,\n         BRUNSWICK ST., STAMFORD ST., S.E. 1, AND BUNGAY, SUFFOLK\n\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SEA-WOLF***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 1074-0.txt or 1074-0.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/1\/0\/7\/1074\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n","id":1390,"split":"test"}
