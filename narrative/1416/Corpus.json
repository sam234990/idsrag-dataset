{"ori_id":"e8691a3bf0cc4d88b455c5e6992185eddad275bc","title":"The Passionate Friends: A Novel","context":"The Passionate Friends: A Novel\n The protagonist is the novel's first-person narrator, Stephen Stratton. The Passionate Friends is written as if addressed to Stephen's eldest son, who is on the verge of adolescence. Stephen is the only child of a rector who loses his faith due to Darwinism.\nThe most important relationship of Stephen's life is with the Lady Mary Christian (later Lady Mary Justin), a beautiful blue-eyed contemporary who has been his childhood \"playmate\" and with whom he falls deeply in love at the age of nineteen during the summer before he begins his studies at Oxford. Mary returns his love, but will not promise to marry Stephen. Having resolved to \"belong to myself,\" Mary weds Justin, a wealthy financier, but intends also to remain Stephen's intimate friend.\nStephen cannot accept this, breaks off relations, and experiences despair. In an attempt to put his troubles behind him, Stephen volunteers to fight in South Africa, where the Second Boer War has just begun (1899). He becomes an officer and distinguishes himself in the fighting, and also is exposed for the first time to \"the social fundamental of Labor.\" Back in England he decides to pursue a political career, since his father has unexpectedly inherited a substantial fortune. But by chance his father is now living on a property adjacent to Lady Mary Justin's; they meet and become lovers.\nStephen had begun to court another near neighbor, Rachel, but the resumption of his passionate relationship with Mary suspends this project. Disaster strikes when Justin sees Stephen kiss his wife. In the following crisis the powerful Justin hides Mary away in an Irish castle and prevails upon Stephen to leave England for a period of three years.\nTraveling the world, Stephen studies Asian societies and develops convictions about the historical development of humanity. He believes that \"Civilization has never yet existed, it has only continually and obstinately attempted to be. Our Civilization is but the indistinct twilight before the dawn.\" He resolves to devote himself to \"the making of a new world-city, a new greater State above your legal States, in which all human life becomes a splendid enterprise, free and beautiful.\" In a villa on the Rhine he chances to meet Rachel again, and after a trip to America he asks her to become his wife; they are married on Nov. 8, 1906. Stephen undertakes with a progressive American named Giddings a career as a publisher of world literature and reference books.\nHis work is going well when in 1909 Stephen receives a letter from Lady Mary Justin. She asks him to resume writing to her, and over a period of two years challenges him to integrate the problem of sex into his world-historical reflections and plans, warning that \"All this great world-state of your man's imagination is going to be wrecked by us if you ignore us, we women are going to be the Goths and Huns of another Decline and Fall.\" Their correspondence addresses personal as well as religious and political matters, but they have no intention of seeing each other again.\nHowever, by chance they do meet again at an inn in the Alps on Engstlen Lake, below Titlis, and share several hours of spiritual communing; they scarcely touch and never kiss. Stephen leaves promptly. But Mary's companion betrays her to husband, whose decision to divorce Mary after a trial for adultery threatens them both with social disaster. In order to forestall this, Mary commits suicide. In his final remarks to his son, Stephen Stratton judges Mary to have been a victim \"caught in the net of animal jealousies and thoughtless motives and ancient rigid institutions.\" He resolves, in the novel's final sentence: \"I give myself, and if I can I will give you, to the destruction of jealousy and of the forms and shelters and instruments of jealousy, both in my own self and in the thought and laws and usage of the world.\"\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's The Passionate Friends, by Herbert George Wells\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

STRATTON TO HIS SON\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 1\n\nI want very much to set down my thoughts and my experiences of life. I\nwant to do so now that I have come to middle age and now that my\nattitudes are all defined and my personal drama worked out I feel that\nthe toil of writing and reconsideration may help to clear and fix many\nthings that remain a little uncertain in my thoughts because they have\nnever been fully stated, and I want to discover any lurking\ninconsistencies and unsuspected gaps. And I have a story. I have lived\nthrough things that have searched me. I want to tell that story as well\nas I can while I am still a clear-headed and active man, and while many\ndetails that may presently become blurred and altered are still rawly\nfresh in my mind. And to one person in particular do I wish to think I\nam writing, and that is to you, my only son. I want to write my story\nnot indeed to the child you are now, but to the man you are going to be.\nYou are half my blood and temperamentally altogether mine. A day will\ncome when you will realize this, and want to know how life has gone with\nme, and then it may be altogether too late for me to answer your\nenquiries. I may have become inaccessible as old people are sometimes\ninaccessible. And so I think of leaving this book for you--at any rate,\nI shall write it as if I meant to leave it for you. Afterwards I can\nconsider whether I will indeed leave it....\n\nThe idea of writing such a book as this came to me first as I sat by the\ndead body of your grandfather--my father. It was because I wanted so\ngreatly such a book from him that I am now writing this. He died, you\nmust know, only a few months ago, and I went to his house to bury him\nand settle all his affairs.\n\nAt one time he had been my greatest friend. He had never indeed talked\nto me about himself or his youth, but he had always showed an\nextraordinary sympathy and helpfulness for me in all the confusion and\nperplexities into which I fell. This did not last to the end of his\nlife. I was the child of his middle years, and suddenly, in a year or\nless, the curtains of age and infirmity fell between us. There came an\nillness, an operation, and he rose from it ailing, suffering, dwarfed\nand altogether changed. Of all the dark shadows upon life I think that\nchange through illness and organic decay in the thoughts and spirits of\nthose who are dear and close to us is the most evil and distressing and\ninexplicable. Suddenly he was a changeling, a being querulous and\npitiful, needing indulgence and sacrifices.\n\nIn a little while a new state of affairs was established. I ceased to\nconsider him as a man to whom one told things, of whom one could expect\nhelp or advice. We all ceased to consider him at all in that way. We\nhumored him, put pleasant things before him, concealed whatever was\ndisagreeable. A poor old man he was indeed in those concluding years,\nweakly rebellious against the firm kindliness of my cousin, his\nhousekeeper and nurse. He who had once been so alert was now at times\nastonishingly apathetic. At times an impish malice I had never known in\nhim before gleamed in little acts and speeches. His talk rambled, and\nfor the most part was concerned with small, long-forgotten contentions.\nIt was indistinct and difficult to follow because of a recent loss of\nteeth, and he craved for brandy, to restore even for a moment the sense\nof strength and well-being that ebbed and ebbed away from him. So that\nwhen I came to look at his dead face at last, it was with something like\namazement I perceived him grave and beautiful--more grave and beautiful\nthan he had been even in the fullness of life.\n\nAll the estrangement of the final years was wiped in an instant from my\nmind as I looked upon his face. There came back a rush of memories, of\nkind, strong, patient, human aspects of his fatherhood. And I remembered\nas every son must remember--even you, my dear, will some day remember\nbecause it is in the very nature of sonship--insubordinations,\nstruggles, ingratitudes, great benefits taken unthankfully, slights and\ndisregards. It was not remorse I felt, nor repentance, but a tremendous\nregret that so things had happened and that life should be so. Why is\nit, I thought, that when a son has come to manhood he cannot take his\nfather for a friend? I had a curious sense of unprecedented communion\nas I stood beside him now. I felt that he understood my thoughts; his\nface seemed to answer with an expression of still and sympathetic\npatience.\n\nI was sensible of amazing gaps. We had never talked together of love,\nnever of religion.\n\nAll sorts of things that a man of twenty-eight would not dream of hiding\nfrom a coeval he had hidden from me. For some days I had to remain in\nhis house, I had to go through his papers, handle all those intimate\npersonal things that accumulate around a human being year by\nyear--letters, yellowing scraps of newspaper, tokens, relics kept,\naccidental vestiges, significant litter. I learnt many things I had\nnever dreamt of. At times I doubted whether I was not prying, whether I\nought not to risk the loss of those necessary legal facts I sought, and\nburn these papers unread. There were love letters, and many such\ntouching things.\n\nMy memories of him did not change because of these new lights, but they\nbecame wonderfully illuminated. I realized him as a young man, I began\nto see him as a boy. I found a little half-bound botanical book with\nstencil-tinted illustrations, a good-conduct prize my father had won at\nhis preparatory school; a rolled-up sheet of paper, carbonized and dry\nand brittle, revealed itself as a piece of specimen writing, stiff with\nboyish effort, decorated in ambitious and faltering flourishes and still\nbetraying the pencil rulings his rubber should have erased. Already your\nwriting is better than that. And I found a daguerreotype portrait of him\nin knickerbockers against a photographer's stile. His face then was not\nunlike yours. I stood with that in my hand at the little bureau in his\nbedroom, and looked at his dead face.\n\nThe flatly painted portrait of his father, my grandfather, hanging\nthere in the stillness above the coffin, looking out on the world he had\nleft with steady, humorous blue eyes that followed one about the\nroom,--that, too, was revivified, touched into reality and participation\nby this and that, became a living presence at a conference of lives.\nThings of his were there also in that life's accumulation....\n\nThere we were, three Strattons together, and down in the dining-room\nwere steel engravings to take us back two generations further, and we\nhad all lived full lives, suffered, attempted, signified. I had a\nglimpse of the long successions of mankind. What a huge inaccessible\nlumber-room of thought and experience we amounted to, I thought; how\nmuch we are, how little we transmit. Each one of us was but a variation,\nan experiment upon the Stratton theme. All that I had now under my hands\nwas but the merest hints and vestiges, moving and surprising indeed, but\ncasual and fragmentary, of those obliterated repetitions. Man is a\ncreature becoming articulate, and why should those men have left so much\nof the tale untold--to be lost and forgotten? Why must we all repeat\nthings done, and come again very bitterly to wisdom our fathers have\nachieved before us? My grandfather there should have left me something\nbetter than the still enigma of his watching face. All my life so far\nhas gone in learning very painfully what many men have learnt before me;\nI have spent the greater part of forty years in finding a sort of\npurpose for the uncertain and declining decades that remain. Is it not\ntime the generations drew together and helped one another? Cannot we\nbegin now to make a better use of the experiences of life so that our\nsons may not waste themselves so much, cannot we gather into books that\nmen may read in an hour or so the gist of these confused and\nmultitudinous realities of the individual career? Surely the time is\ncoming for that, when a new private literature will exist, and fathers\nand mothers behind their r\u00c3\u00b4les of rulers, protectors, and supporters,\nwill prepare frank and intimate records of their thought and their\nfeeling, told as one tells things to equals, without authority or\nreserves or discretions, so that, they being dead, their children may\nrediscover them as contemporaries and friends.\n\nThat desire for self-expression is indeed already almost an instinct\nwith many of us. Man is disposed to create a traditional wisdom. For me\nthis book I contemplate is a need. I am just a year and a half from a\nbitter tragedy and the loss of a friend as dear as life to me. It is\nvery constantly in my mind. She opened her mind to me as few people open\ntheir minds to anyone. In a way, little Stephen, she died for you. And I\nam so placed that I have no one to talk to quite freely about her. The\none other person to whom I talk, I cannot talk to about her; it is\nstrange, seeing how we love and trust one another, but so it is; you\nwill understand that the better as this story unfolds. For eight long\nyears before the crisis that culminated in her tragic death I never saw\nher; yet, quite apart from the shock and distresses of that time, it has\nleft me extraordinarily lonely and desolate.\n\nAnd there was a kind of dreadful splendor in that last act of hers,\nwhich has taken a great hold upon my imagination; it has interwoven with\neverything else in my mind, it bears now upon every question. I cannot\nget away from it, while it is thus pent from utterance.... Perhaps\nhaving written this to you I may never show it you or leave it for you\nto see. But yet I must write it. Of all conceivable persons you, when\nyou have grown to manhood, are the most likely to understand.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 2\n\nYou did not come to see your dead grandfather, nor did you know very\nmuch about the funeral. Nowadays we do not bring the sweet egotisms, the\nvivid beautiful personal intensities of childhood, into the cold, vast\npresence of death. I would as soon, my dear, have sent your busy little\nlimbs toiling up the Matterhorn. I have put by a photograph of my father\nfor you as he lay in that last stillness of his, that you will see at a\nproperer time.\n\nYour mother and I wore black only at his funeral and came back colored\nagain into your colored world, and in a very little while your interest\nin this event that had taken us away for a time turned to other, more\nassimilable things. But there happened a little incident that laid hold\nupon me; you forgot it, perhaps, in a week or less, but I shall never\nforget it; and this incident it was that gathered up the fruits of those\nmoments beside my father's body and set me to write this book. It had\nthe effect of a little bright light held up against the vague dark\nimmensities of thought and feeling that filled my mind because of my\nfather's death.\n\nNow that I come to set it down I see that it is altogether trivial, and\nI cannot explain how it is that it is to me so piercingly significant. I\nhad to whip you. Your respect for the admirable and patient\nMademoiselle Potin, the protectress and companion of your public\nexpeditions, did in some slight crisis suddenly fail you. In the extreme\npublicity of Kensington Gardens, in the presence of your two little\nsisters, before a startled world, you expressed an opinion of her, in\ntwo languages and a loud voice, that was not only very unjust, but\nextremely offensive and improper. It reflected upon her intelligence and\ngoodness; it impeached her personal appearance; it was the kind of\noutcry no little gentleman should ever permit himself, however deeply he\nmay be aggrieved. You then, so far as I was able to disentangle the\nevidence, assaulted her violently, hurled a stone at her, and fled her\ncompany. You came home alone by a route chosen by yourself, flushed and\nwrathful, braving the dangers of Kensington High Street. This, after my\nstern and deliberate edict that, upon pain of corporal punishment,\nrespect and obedience must be paid to Mademoiselle Potin. The logic of\nthe position was relentless.\n\nBut where your behavior was remarkable, where the affair begins to touch\nmy imagination, was that you yourself presently put the whole business\nbefore me. Alone in the schoolroom, you seem to have come to some\nrealization of the extraordinary dreadfulness of your behavior. Such\nmoments happen in the lives of all small boys; they happened to me times\nenough, to my dead father, to that grandfather of the portrait which is\nnow in my study, to his father and his, and so on through long series of\nStrattons, back to inarticulate, shock-haired little sinners slinking\nfearfully away from the awful wrath, the bellowings and limitless\nviolence of the hairy Old Man of the herd. The bottom goes out of your\nheart then, you are full of a conviction of sin. So far you did but\ncarry on the experience of the race. But to ask audience of me, to come\nand look me in the eye, to say you wanted my advice on a pressing\nmatter, that I think marks almost a new phase in the long developing\nhistory of father and son. And your account of the fracas struck me as\nquite reasonably frank and honest. \"I didn't seem able,\" you observed,\n\"not to go on being badder and badder.\"\n\nWe discussed the difficulties of our situation, and you passed sentence\nupon yourself. I saw to it that the outraged dignity of Mademoiselle\nPotin was mocked by no mere formality of infliction. You did your best\nto be stoical, I remember, but at last you yelped and wept. Then,\njustice being done, you rearranged your costume. The situation was a\nlittle difficult until you, still sobbing and buttoning--you are really\na shocking bad hand at buttons--and looking a very small, tender,\nruffled, rueful thing indeed, strolled towards my study window. \"The\npear tree is out next door,\" you remarked, without a trace of animosity,\nand sobbing as one might hiccough.\n\nI suppose there are moments in the lives of all grown men when they come\nnear to weeping aloud. In some secret place within myself I must have\nbeen a wild river of tears. I answered, however, with the same admirable\ndetachment from the smarting past that you had achieved, that my study\nwindow was particularly adapted to the appreciation of our neighbor's\npear tree, because of its height from the ground. We fell into a\nconversation about blossom and the setting of fruit, kneeling together\nupon my window-seat and looking up into the pear tree against the sky,\nand then down through its black branches into the gardens all\nquickening with spring. We were on so friendly a footing when presently\nMademoiselle Potin returned and placed her dignity or her resignation in\nmy hands, that I doubt if she believed a word of all my assurances until\nthe unmistakable confirmation of your evening bath. Then, as I\nunderstood it, she was extremely remorseful to you and indignant against\nmy violence....\n\nBut when I knelt with you, little urchin, upon my window-seat, it came\nto me as a thing almost intolerably desirable that some day you should\nbecome my real and understanding friend. I loved you profoundly. I\nwanted to stretch forward into time and speak to you, man myself to the\nman you are yet to be. It seemed to me that between us there must needs\nbe peculiar subtleties of sympathy. And I remembered that by the time\nyou were a man fully grown and emerging from the passionately tumultuous\nopenings of manhood, capable of forgiving me all my blundering\nparentage, capable of perceiving all the justifying fine intention of my\nill-conceived disciplines and misdirections, I might be either an old\nman, shriveling again to an inexplicable egotism, or dead. I saw myself\nas I had seen my father--first enfeebled and then inaccessibly tranquil.\nWhen presently you had gone from my study, I went to my writing-desk and\ndrew a paper pad towards me, and sat thinking and making idle marks upon\nit with my pen. I wanted to exceed the limits of those frozen silences\nthat must come at last between us, write a book that should lie in your\nworld like a seed, and at last, as your own being ripened, flower into\nliving understanding by your side.\n\nThis book, which before had been only an idea for a book, competing\nagainst many other ideas and the demands of that toilsome work for\npeace and understanding to which I have devoted the daily energies of my\nlife, had become, I felt, an imperative necessity between us.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 3\n\nAnd then there happened one of those crises of dread and apprehension\nand pain that are like a ploughing of the heart. It was brought home to\nme that you might die even before the first pages of this book of yours\nwere written. You became feverish, complained of that queer pain you had\nfelt twice before, and for the third time you were ill with\nappendicitis. Your mother and I came and regarded your touzled head and\nflushed little face on the pillow as you slept uneasily, and decided\nthat we must take no more risks with you. So soon as your temperature\nhad fallen again we set about the business of an operation.\n\nWe told each other that nowadays these operations were as safe as going\nto sleep in your bed, but we knew better. Our own doctor had lost his\nson. \"That,\" we said, \"was different.\" But we knew well enough in our\nhearts that you were going very near to the edge of death, nearer than\nyou had ever been since first you came clucking into the world.\n\nThe operation was done at home. A capable, fair-complexioned nurse took\npossession of us; and my study, because it has the best light, was\ntransfigured into an admirable operating-room. All its furnishings were\nsent away, every cloth and curtain, and the walls and floor were covered\nwith white sterilized sheets. The high little mechanical table they\nerected before the window seemed to me like an altar on which I had to\noffer up my son. There were basins of disinfectants and towels\nconveniently about, the operator came, took out his array of scalpels\nand forceps and little sponges from the black bag he carried, put them\nready for his hand, and then covered them from your sight with a white\ncloth, and I brought you down in my arms, wrapped in a blanket, from\nyour bedroom to the an\u00c3\u00a6sthetist. You were beautifully trustful and\nsubmissive and unafraid. I stood by you until the chloroform had done\nits work, and then left you there, lest my presence should in the\nslightest degree embarrass the surgeon. The an\u00c3\u00a6sthetic had taken all the\ncolor out of your face, and you looked pinched and shrunken and greenish\nand very small and pitiful. I went into the drawing-room and stood there\nwith your mother and made conversation. I cannot recall what we said, I\nthink it was about the moorland to which we were going for your\nconvalescence. Indeed, we were but the ghosts of ourselves; all our\nsubstance seemed listening, listening to the little sounds that came to\nus from the study.\n\nThen after long ages there was a going to and fro of feet, a bump, the\nopening of a door, and our own doctor came into the room rubbing his\nhands together and doing nothing to conceal his profound relief.\n\"Admirable,\" he said, \"altogether successful.\" I went up to you and saw\na tumbled little person in the bed, still heavily insensible and moaning\nslightly. By the table were bloody towels, and in a shallow glass tray\nwas a small object like a damaged piece of earthworm. \"Not a bit too\nsoon,\" said the surgeon, holding this up in his forceps for my\ninspection. \"It's on the very verge of perforation.\" I affected a\ndetached and scientific interest, but the prevailing impression in my\nmind was that this was a fragment from very nearly the centre of your\nbeing.\n\nHe took it away with him, I know not whither. Perhaps it is now in\nspirits in a specimen jar, an example to all medical students of what to\navoid in an appendix; perhaps it was stained and frozen, and\nmicrotomized into transparent sections as they do such things, and\nmounted on glass slips and distributed about the world for curious\nhistologists to wreak their eyes upon. For a time you lay uneasily still\nand then woke up to pain. Even then you got a fresh purchase on my\nheart. It has always been our custom to discourage weeping and outcries,\nand you did not forget your training. \"I shan't mind so much, dadda,\"\nyou remarked to me, \"if I may yelp.\" So for a day, by special\nconcession, you yelped, and then the sting of those fresh wounds\ndeparted.\n\nWithin a fortnight, so quickly does an aseptic wound heal up again, you\nwere running about in the sun, and I had come back, as one comes back to\na thing forgotten, to the first beginnings of this chapter on my desk.\nBut for a time I could not go on working at it because of the fear I had\nfelt, and it is only now in June, in this house in France to which we\nhave come for the summer, with you more flagrantly healthy than I have\never known you before, that my heart creeps out of its hole again, and I\ncan go on with my story.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE SECOND\n\nBOYHOOD\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 1\n\nI was a Harbury boy as my father and grandfather were before me and as\nyou are presently to be. I went to Harbury at the age of fourteen. Until\nthen I was educated at home, first by a governess and then by my\nfather's curate, Mr. Siddons, who went from us to St. Philip's in\nHampstead, and, succeeding marvellously there, is now Bishop of\nExminster. My father became rector of Burnmore when I was nine; my\nmother had been dead four years, and my second cousin, Jane Stratton,\nwas already his housekeeper. My father held the living until his\nresignation when I was nearly thirty. So that all the most\nimpressionable years of my life centre upon the Burnmore rectory and the\neasy spaciousness of Burnmore Park. My boyhood and adolescence\nalternated between the ivied red-brick and ancient traditions of Harbury\n(and afterwards Christ-church) and that still untroubled countryside.\n\nI was never a town dweller until I married and we took our present house\nin Holland Park. I went into London at last as one goes into an arena.\nIt cramps me and wearies me and at times nearly overwhelms me, but\nthere it is that the life of men centres and my work lies. But every\nsummer we do as we have done this year and go to some house in the\ncountry, near to forests or moorland or suchlike open and uncultivated\ncountry, where one may have the refreshment of freedom among natural and\nunhurried things. This year we are in a walled garden upon the Seine,\nabout four miles above Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau Galliard, and with the forest reaching up\nto the paddock beyond the orchard close....\n\nYou will understand better when I have told you my story why I saw\nBurnmore for the last time when I was one-and-twenty and why my memories\nof it shine so crystalline clear. I have a thousand vivid miniatures of\nit in my mind and all of them are beautiful to me, so that I could quite\neasily write a whole book of landscapes from the Park alone. I can still\nrecall quite vividly the warm beauty-soaked sensation of going out into\nthe morning sunshine of the Park, with my lunch in a little green Swiss\ntin under my arm and the vast interminable day all before me, the\ngigantic, divinely unconditional day that only boyhood knows, and the\nPark so great and various that it was more than two hours' going for me\nto reach its eastern fences. I was only a little older then than you are\nnow. Sometimes I went right up through the woods to the house to\ncompanion with Philip and Guy Christian and their sister--I loved her\nthen, and one day I was to love her with all my heart--but in those\nboyish times I liked most to go alone.\n\nMy memories of the Park are all under blue sky and sunshine, with just a\nthunderstorm or so; on wet days and cold days I was kept to closer\nlimits; and it seems to me now rather an intellectual conviction than a\npositive memory that save for a few pine-clad patches in the extreme\nsouth-east, its soil was all thick clay. That meant for me only\nbeautiful green marshes, a number of vividly interesting meres upon the\ncourse of its stream, and a wealth of gigantic oaks. The meres lay at\nvarious levels, and the hand of Lady Ladislaw had assisted nature in\ntheir enrichment with lilies and water plants. There were places of\nsedge and scented rush, amidst which were sapphire mists of\nforget-me-not for long stretches, skirmishing commandoes of yellow iris\nand wide wastes of floating water-lilies. The gardens passed insensibly\ninto the Park, and beyond the house were broad stretches of grass,\nsun-lit, barred with the deep-green shadows of great trees, and animated\nwith groups and lines of fallow deer. Near the house was an Italianate\ngarden, with balustradings and statuary, and a great wealth of roses and\nflowering shrubs.\n\nThen there were bracken wildernesses in which the does lurked with the\nyoung fawns, and a hollow, shallow and wide, with the turf greatly\nattacked by rabbits, and exceptionally threadbare, where a stricken oak,\nlightning-stripped, spread out its ghastly arms above contorted rotting\nbranches and the mysterious skeletons of I should think five several\ndeer. In the evening-time the woods behind this place of bones--they\nwere woods of straight-growing, rather crowded trees and standing as it\nwere a little aloof--became even under the warmest sunset grey and\ncold--and as if they waited....\n\nAnd in the distant corner where the sand was, rose suddenly a steep\nlittle hill, surmounted by a wild and splendid group of pines, through\nwhich one looked across a vale of cornfields at an ancient town that\nbecame strange and magical as the sun went down, so that I was held\ngazing at it, and afterwards had to flee the twilight across the windy\nspaces and under the dim and darkling trees. It is only now in the\ndistant retrospect that I identify that far-off city of wonder, and\nluminous mist with the commonplace little town, through whose narrow\nstreets we drove to the railway station. But, of course, that is what it\nmust have been.\n\nThere are persons to be found mixed up in those childish memories,--Lady\nLadislaw, tall and gracious, in dresses of floating blue or grey, or\nthin, subtly folding, flowering stuffs, Philip and his sister, Guy, the\nold butler, a multitude of fainter figures long become nameless and\nfeatureless; they are far less vivid in my memory than the fine\nsolitudes of the Park itself--and the dreams I had there.\n\nI wonder if you dream as I dreamt. I wonder whether indeed I dreamt as\nnow I think I did. Have I, in these latter years, given form and\nsubstance and a name to things as vague in themselves as the urgencies\nof instinct? Did I really go into those woods and waving green places as\none keeps a tryst, expectant of a fellowship more free and delicate and\ndelightful than any I knew. Did I know in those days of nymphs and\ndryads and fauns and all those happy soulless beings with which the\ndesire of man's heart has animated the wilderness. Once certainly I\ncrawled slowly through the tall bracken and at last lay still for an\ninterminable while, convinced that so I should see those shadows\npopulous with fairies, with green little people. How patiently I lay!\nBut the stems creaked and stirred, and my heart would keep on beating\nlike a drum in my throat.\n\nIt is incredible that once a furry whispering half-human creature with\nbright brown eyes came and for a time played with me near where the tall\nferns foam in a broad torrent from between the big chestnuts down to the\nupper mere. That must have been real dreaming, and yet now, with all my\nsanities and scepticisms, I could half believe it real.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 2\n\nYou become reserved. Perhaps not exceptionally so, but as all children\nbecome reserved. Already you understand that your heart is very\npreciously your own. You keep it from me and everyone, so much so, so\njustifiably so, that when by virtue of our kindred and all that we have\nin common I get sudden glimpses right into your depths, there mixes with\nthe swift spasm of love I feel, a dread--lest you should catch me, as it\nwere, spying into you and that one of us, I know not which, should feel\nashamed.\n\nEvery child passes into this secret stage; it closes in from its first\nfrankness; it carries off the growing jewel of its consciousness to hide\nfrom all mankind.... I think I can see why this should be so, but I\ncannot tell why in so many cases no jewel is given back again at last,\nalight, ripened, wonderful, glowing with the deep fires of experience. I\nthink that is what ought to happen; it is what does happen now with true\npoets and true artists. Someday I think it will be the life of all\nnormal human souls. But usually it does not seem to happen at all.\nChildren pass out of a stage--open, beautiful, exquisitely simple--into\nsilences and discretions beneath an imposed and artificial life. And\nthey are lost. Out of the finished, careful, watchful, restrained and\nlimited man or woman, no child emerges again....\n\nI remember very distinctly how I myself came by imperceptible increments\nof reservation to withdraw those early delicacies of judgments, those\noriginal and personal standards and appreciations, from sight and\nexpression. I can recall specific moments when I perceive now that my\nlittle childish figure stood, as it were, obstinately and with a sense\nof novelty in a doorway denying the self within.\n\nIt was partly, I think, a simple instinct that drew that curtain of\nsilences and concealments, it was much more a realization that I had no\npower of lucidity to save the words and deeds I sought to make\nexpressive from complete misunderstanding. But most of all it was the\nperception that I was under training and compulsion for ends that were\nall askew and irrelevant to the trend of my imaginations, the quality of\nmy dreams. There was around me something unfriendly to this inner\nworld--something very ready to pass from unfriendliness to acute\nhostility; and if, indeed, I succeeded in giving anything of my inner\nself to others, it was only, as people put it, to give myself away.\n\nMy nurses, my governess, my tutor, my father, the servants about me,\nseemed all bent upon imposing an artificial personality upon me. Only in\na very limited sense did they want me. What they wanted was something\nthat could be made out of me by extensive suppressions and additions.\nThey ignored the fact that I had been born with a shape of my own; they\nwere resolved I should be pressed into a mould and cast.\n\nIt was not that they wanted outer conformity to certain needs and\nstandards--that, I think, would be a reasonable thing enough to\ndemand--but they wanted me to subdue my most private thoughts to their\nideals. My nurses and my governesses would rate me for my very feelings,\nwould clamor for gratitude and reproach me bitterly for betraying that I\ndid not at some particular moment--love.\n\n(Only yesterday I heard Mademoiselle Potin doing that very same thing to\nyou. \"It is that you do not care, Master Steve. It is that you do not\ncare. You do not want to care.\")\n\nThey went too far in that invasion of my personal life, but I perceive\nquite clearly the present need for most of the process of moulding and\nsubjugation that children must undergo. Human society is a new thing\nupon the earth, an invention of the last ten thousand years. Man is a\ncreature as yet not freely and instinctively gregarious; in his more\nprimordial state he must have been an animal of very small groups and\nlimited associations, an animal rather self-centred and fierce, and he\nis still but imperfectly adapted either morally or physically to the\nwider social life his crowding interactions force upon him. He still\nlearns speech and computation and civility and all the devices of this\nartificially extended and continually broadening tribal life with an\nextreme reluctance. He has to be shaped in the interests of the species,\nI admit, to the newer conditions; the growing social order must be\nprotected from the keen edge of his still savage individuality, and he\nmust be trained in his own interests to save himself from the\ndestruction of impossible revolts. But how clumsily is the thing done!\nHow we are caught and jammed and pressed and crippled into citizenship!\nHow excessive and crushing is the suppression, and how inadequate!\n\nEvery child feels that, even if every child does not clearly know it.\nEvery child presently begins to hide itself from the confused tyrannies\nof the social process, from the searching inspections and injunctions\nand interferences of parent and priest and teacher.\n\n\"I have got to be _so_,\" we all say deep down in ourselves and more or\nless distinctly according to the lucidities of our minds; \"but in my\nheart I am _this_.\"\n\nAnd in the outcome we all try to seem at least to be _so_, while an\nineffectual rebel struggles passionately, like a beast caught in a trap,\nfor ends altogether more deep and dangerous, for the rose and the star\nand the wildfire,--for beauty and beautiful things. These, we all know\nin our darkly vital recesses, are the real needs of life, the obediences\nimposed upon us by our crude necessities and jostling proximities, mere\nincidentals on our way to those profounder purposes....\n\nAnd when I write thus of our selves I mean our bodies quite as much as\nour imaginations; the two sides of us are covered up alike and put alike\ninto disguises and unnatural shapes, we are taught and forced to hide\nthem for the same reasons, from a fear of ourselves and a fear of the\npeople about us. The sense of beauty, the sense of one's body, the\nfreedom of thought and of desire and the wonder of life, are all\ninterwoven strands. I remember that in the Park of Burnmore one great\ncraving I had was to take off my clothes there altogether, and bathe in\na clear place among loosestrife and meadowsweet, and afterwards lie wet\nand naked upon the soft green turf with the sun shining upon me. But I\nthought also that that was a very wicked and shameful craving to have,\nand I never dared give way to it.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 3\n\nAs I think of myself and all these glowing secrecies and hidden fancies\nwithin, walking along beside old Siddons, and half listening to his\ninstructive discourse, I see myself as though I was an image of all\nhumanity under tuition for the social life.\n\nI write \"old Siddons,\" for so he seemed to me then. In truth he was\nscarcely a dozen years older than I, and the other day when I exchanged\nsalutations with his gaitered presence in the Haymarket, on his way I\nsuppose to the Athen\u00c3\u00a6um, it struck me that he it is who is now the\nyounger man. But at Burnmore he was eighteen inches or more above my\nhead and all the way of school and university beyond me; full of the\nworld they had fitted him for and eager to impart its doctrines. He went\nalong in his tweeds that were studiously untidy, a Norfolk jacket of one\nclerically-greyish stuff and trousers of another somewhat lighter\npattern, in thick boots, the collar of his calling, and a broad-minded\nhat, bearing his face heavenward as he talked, and not so much aware of\nme as appreciating the things he was saying. And sometimes he was\nmanifestly talking to himself and airing his outlook. He carried a\nwalking-stick, a manly, homely, knobby, donnish walking-stick.\n\nHe forced the pace a little, for his legs were long and he had acquired\nthe habit of strenuous pedestrianism at Oxford with all the other\nthings; he obliged me to go at a kind of skipping trot, and he preferred\nthe high roads towards Wickenham for our walks, because they were\nflatter and there was little traffic upon them in those days before the\nmotor car, and we could keep abreast and go on talking uninterruptedly.\nThat is to say, he could.\n\nWhat talk it was!\n\nOf all the virtues that the young should have. He spoke of courage and\nhow splendid it was to accustom oneself not even to feel fear; of truth,\nand difficult cases when one might conceivably injure others by telling\nthe truth and so perhaps, perhaps qualify the rigor of one's integrity,\nbut how one should never hesitate to injure one's own self in that\nmatter. Then in another phase he talked of belief--and the\ndisagreeableness of dissenters. But here, I remember, there was a\ndiscussion. I have forgotten how I put the thing, but in some boyish\nphrasing or other I must have thrown out the idea that thought is free\nand beliefs uncontrollable. What of conformity, if the truth was that\nyou doubted? \"Not if you make an effort,\" I remember him saying, \"not if\nyou make an effort. I have had my struggles. But if you say firmly to\nyourself, the Church teaches this. If you dismiss mere carping and say\nthat.\"\n\n\"But suppose you can't,\" I must have urged.\n\n\"You can if you will,\" he said with a note near enthusiasm. \"I have been\nthrough all that. I did it. I dismissed doubts. I wouldn't listen. I\nfelt, _This won't do. All this leads nowhere._\"\n\nAnd he it was told me the classic story of that presumptuous schoolboy\nwho went to his Head Master and declared himself an atheist. There were\nno dialectics but a prompt horse-whipping. \"In after life,\" said Mr.\nSiddons, with unctuous gratification, \"he came to recognize that\nthrashing as the very best thing that had ever happened to him. The\nkindest thing.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" urged the obstinate rebel within me, \"but--the Truth, that\nfearless insistence on the Truth!\"\n\nI could, however, find nothing effective to say aloud, and Siddons\nprevailed over me. That story made my blood boil, it filled me with an\nanticipatory hatred of and hostility to Head Masters, and at the same\ntime there was something in it, brutally truer to the conditions of\nhuman association than any argument.\n\nI do not remember the various steps by which I came to be discussing\ndoubts so early in my life. I could not have been much more than\nthirteen when that conversation occurred. I am I think perhaps\nexceptionally unconscious about myself. I find I can recall the sayings\nand even the gestures of other people far more distinctly than the\nthings I said and did myself. Even my dreams and imaginings are more\nactive than my positive thoughts and proceedings. But I was no doubt\nvery much stimulated by the literature lying about my home and the\ngleans and echoes of controversies that played like summer lightning\nround and about the horizons of my world. Over my head and after I had\ngone to bed, my father and Siddons were talking, my cousin was listening\nwith strained apprehensions, there was a new spirit in my father's\nsermons; it was the storm of Huxley-Darwin controversies that had at\nlast reached Burnmore. I was an intelligent little listener, an eager\nreader of anything that came to hand, Mr. Siddons had a disposition to\nfight his battles over again in his monologues to me; and after all at\nthirteen one isn't a baby. The small boy of the lower classes used in\nthose days to start life for himself long before then.\n\nHow dramatic a phase it was in the history of the human mind when\nscience suddenly came into the vicarages, into all the studies and quiet\nplaces that had been the fastnesses of conviction and our ideals, and\ndenied, with all the power of evidence it had been accumulating for so\nlong, and so obscurely and inaggressively, with fossils and strata, with\nembryology and comparative anatomy, the doctrine of the historical Fall\nand all the current scheme of orthodoxy that was based on that! What a\nquickening shock it must have been in countless thousands of educated\nlives! And my father after a toughly honest resistance was won over to\nDarwinism, the idea of Evolution got hold of him, the idea that life\nitself was intolerant of vain repetitions; and he had had to \"consider\nhis position\" in the church. To him as to innumerable other honest,\nmiddle-aged and comfortable men, Darwinism came as a dreadful invitation\nto go out into the wilderness. Over my head and just out of range of my\nears he was debating that issue with Siddons as a foil and my cousin as\na horrified antagonist. Slowly he was developing his conception of\ncompromise. And meanwhile he wasn't going out into the wilderness at\nall, but punctually to and fro, along the edge of the lawn by the bed of\nhollyhocks and through the little green door in the garden wall, and\nacross the corner of the churchyard to the vestry and the perennial\nservices and sacraments of the church.\n\nBut he never talked to me privately of religion. He left that for my\ncousin and Mr. Siddons to do or not to do as they felt disposed, and in\nthose silences of his I may have found another confirmation of my\ngrowing feeling that religion was from one point of view a thing\nsomehow remote and unreal, claiming unjustifiable interventions in the\ndetailed conduct of my life, and from another a peculiar concern of my\nfather's and Mr. Siddons', to which they went--through the vestry,\nchanging into strange garments on the way.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 4\n\nI do not want to leave the impression which my last section may have\nconveyed that at the age of thirteen or thereabouts I walked about with\nMr. Siddons discussing doubt in a candid and intelligent manner and\nmaintaining theological positions. That particular conversation, you\nmust imagine with Mr. Siddons somewhat monologuing, addressing himself\nnot only to my present self, but with an unaccustomed valiance to my\nabsent father. What I may have said or not said, whether I did indeed\ndispute or merely and by a kind of accident implied objections, I have\naltogether forgotten long ago.\n\nA boy far more than a man is mentally a discontinuous being. The\ndrifting chaos of his mind makes its experimental beginnings at a\nhundred different points and in a hundred different spirits and\ndirections; here he flashes into a concrete realization, here into a\nconviction unconsciously incompatible; here is something originally\nconceived, here something uncritically accepted. I know that I\ncriticized Mr. Siddons quite acutely, and disbelieved in him. I know\nalso that I accepted all sorts of suggestions from him quite\nunhesitatingly and that I did my utmost to satisfy his standards and\nrealize his ideals of me.\n\nLike an outer casing to that primordial creature of senses and dreams\nwhich came to the surface in the solitudes of the Park was my\nSiddonsesque self, a high-minded and clean and brave English boy,\nconscientiously loyal to queen and country, athletic and a good\nsportsman and acutely alive to good and bad \"form.\" Mr. Siddons made me\naware of my clothed self as a visible object, I surveyed my garmented\nbeing in mirrors and was trained to feel the \"awfulness\" of various\nother small boys who appeared transitorily in the smaller Park when Lady\nLadislaw extended her wide hospitality to certain benevolent London\nassociations. Their ill-fitting clothing, their undisciplined outcries,\ntheir slouching, their bad throwing and defective aspirates were made\nmatters for detestation in my plastic mind. Those things, I was assured,\nplaced them outside the pale of any common humanity.\n\n\"Very unfortunate and all that,\" said Mr. Siddons, \"and uncommonly good\nof Lady Ladislaw to have them down. But dirty little cads, Stephen,\ndirty little cads; so don't go near 'em if you can help it.\"\n\nThey played an indecent sort of cricket with coats instead of a wicket!\n\nMr. Siddons was very grave about games and the strict ritual and proper\napparatus for games. He believed that Waterloo was won by the indirect\ninfluence of public school cricket--disregarding many other contributory\nfactors. We did not play very much, but we \"practised\" sedulously at a\nnet in the paddock with the gardener and the doctor's almost grown-up\nsons. I thought missing a possible catch was an impropriety. I\nstudiously maintained the correct attitude, alert and elastic, while I\nwas fielding. Moreover I had a shameful secret, that I did not really\nknow where a ball ought to pitch. I wasn't clear about it and I did not\ndare to ask. Also until I was nearly thirteen I couldn't bowl overarm.\nSuch is the enduring force of early suggestion, my dear son, that I feel\na faint twinge of shame as I set this down for your humiliated eyes. But\nso it was. May you be more precocious!\n\nThen I was induced to believe that I really liked hunting and killing\nthings. In the depths of my being I was a gentle and primitive savage\ntowards animals; I believed they were as subtle and wise as myself and\nfull of a magic of their own, but Mr. Siddons nevertheless got me out\ninto the south Warren, where I had often watched the rabbits setting\ntheir silly cock-eared sentinels and lolloping out to feed about\nsundown, and beguiled me into shooting a furry little fellow-creature--I\ncan still see its eyelid quiver as it died--and carrying it home in\ntriumph. On another occasion I remember I was worked up into a ferocious\nexcitement about the rats in the old barn. We went ratting, just as\nthough I was Tom Brown or Harry East or any other of the beastly little\nmodels of cant and cruelty we English boys were trained to imitate. It\nwas great sport. It was a tremendous spree. The distracted movements,\nthe scampering and pawing of the little pink forefeet of one squawking\nlittle fugitive, that I hit with a stick and then beat to a shapeless\nbag of fur, haunted my dreams for years, and then I saw the bowels of\nanother still living victim that had been torn open by one of the\nterriers, and abruptly I fled out into the yard and was violently sick;\nthe best of the fun was over so far as I was concerned.\n\nMy cousin saved me from the uttermost shame of my failure by saying\nthat I had been excited too soon after my dinner....\n\nAnd also I collected stamps and birds' eggs.\n\nMr. Siddons hypnotized me into believing that I really wanted these\nthings; he gave me an egg-cabinet for a birthday present and told me\nexemplary stories of the wonderful collections other boys had made. My\nown natural disposition to watch nests and establish heaven knows what\nfriendly intimacy with the birds--perhaps I dreamt their mother might\nlet me help to feed the young ones--gave place to a feverish artful\nhunting, a clutch, and then, detestable process, the blowing of the egg.\nOf course we were very humane; we never took the nest, but just\nfrightened off the sitting bird and grabbed a warm egg or so. And the\npoor perforated, rather damaged little egg-shells accumulated in the\ndrawers, against the wished-for but never actually realized day of glory\nwhen we should meet another collector who wouldn't have--something that\nwe had. So far as it was for anything and not mere imbecile\nimitativeness, it was for that.\n\nAnd writing thus of eggs reminds me that I got into a row with Mr.\nSiddons for cruelty.\n\nI discovered there was the nest of a little tit in a hole between two\nstones in the rock bank that bordered the lawn. I found it out when I\nwas sitting on the garden seat near by, learning Latin irregular verbs.\nI saw the minute preposterous round birds going and coming, and I found\nsomething so absurdly amiable and confiding about them--they sat\nbalancing and oscillating on a standard rose and cheeped at me to go and\nthen dived nestward and gave away their secret out of sheer\nimpatience--that I could not bring myself to explore further, and kept\nthe matter altogether secret from the enthusiasm of Mr. Siddons. And in\na few days there were no more eggs and I could hear the hungry little\nnestlings making the minutest of fairy hullabaloos, the very finest spun\nsilk of sound; a tremendous traffic in victual began and I was the\ntrusted friend of the family.\n\nThen one morning I was filled with amazement and anguish. There was a\nrock torn down and lying in the path; a paw had gone up to that little\nwarm place. Across the gravel, shreds of the nest and a wisp or so of\ndown were scattered. I could imagine the brief horrors of that night\nattack. I started off, picking up stones as I went, to murder that sandy\ndevil, the stable cat. I got her once--alas! that I am still glad to\nthink of it--and just missed her as she flashed, a ginger streak,\nthrough the gate into the paddock.\n\n\"_Now_ Steve! Now!\" came Mr. Siddons' voice behind me....\n\nHow can one explain things of that sort to a man like Siddons? I took my\nlecture on the Utter Caddishness of Wanton Cruelty in a black rebellious\nsilence. The affair and my own emotions were not only far beyond my\npowers of explanation, but far beyond my power of understanding. Just\nthen my soul was in shapeless and aimless revolt against something\ngreater and higher and deeper and darker than Siddons, and his\nreproaches were no more than the chattering of a squirrel while a storm\nuproots great trees. I wanted to kill the cat. I wanted to kill whatever\nhad made that cat.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 5\n\nMr. Siddons it was who first planted the conception of Life as a Career\nin my mind.\n\nIn those talks that did so much towards shaping me into the likeness of\na modest, reserved, sporting, seemly, clean and brave, patriotic and\ndecently slangy young Englishman, he was constantly reverting to that\nview of existence. He spoke of failures and successes, talked of\nstatesmen and administrators, peerages and Westminster Abbey. \"Nelson,\"\nhe said, \"was once a clergyman's son like you.\"\n\n\"England has been made by the sons of the clergy.\"\n\nHe talked of the things that led to failure and the things that had made\nmen prominent and famous.\n\n\"Discursiveness ruins a man,\" I remember him saying. \"Choose your goal\nand press to it.\"\n\n\"Never do anything needlessly odd. It's a sort of impertinence to all\nthe endless leaders of the past who created our traditions. Do not\ncommit yourself hastily to opinions, but once you have done so, stick to\nthem. The world would far rather have a firm man wrong, than a weak man\nhesitatingly right. Stick to them.\"\n\n\"One has to remember,\" I recall him meditating, far over my head with\nhis face upturned, \"that Institutions are more important than Views.\nVery often one adopts a View only to express one's belief in an\nInstitution.... Men can do with almost all sorts of Views, but only with\ncertain Institutions. All this Doubt doesn't touch a truth like that.\nOne does not refuse to live in a house because of the old symbols one\nfinds upon the door.... If they _are_ old symbols....\"\n\nOut of such private contemplations he would descend suddenly upon me.\n\n\"What are _you_ going to do with your life, Steve?\" he would ask.\n\n\"There is no happiness in life without some form of service. Where do\nyou mean to serve? With your bent for science and natural history, it\nwouldn't be difficult for you to get into the I.C.S. I doubt if you'd do\nanything at the law; it's a rough game, Steve, though the prizes are\nbig. Big prizes the lawyers get. I've known a man in the Privy Council\nunder forty--and that without anything much in the way of a family....\nBut always one must concentrate. The one thing England will not stand is\na loafer, a wool-gatherer, a man who goes about musing and half-awake.\nIt's our energy. We're western. It's that has made us all we are.\"\n\nI knew whither that pointed. Never so far as I can remember did Mr.\nSiddons criticize either myself or my father directly, but I understood\nwith the utmost clearness that he found my father indolent and\nhesitating, and myself more than a little bit of a mollycoddle, and in\nurgent need of pulling together.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 6\n\nHarbury went on with that process of suppressing, encrusting, hardening,\nand bracing-up which Mr. Siddons had begun. For a time I pulled myself\ntogether very thoroughly. I am not ungrateful nor unfaithful to Harbury;\nin your turn you will go there, you will have to live your life in this\nBritish world of ours and you must learn its language and manners,\nacquire its reserves and develop the approved toughness and patterning\nof cuticle. Afterwards if you please you may quarrel with it. But don't\nwhen the time comes quarrel with the present conditions of human\nassociation and think it is only with Harbury you quarrel. What man has\nbecome and may become beneath the masks and impositions of civilization,\nin his intimate texture and in the depths of his being, I begin now in\nmy middle age to appreciate. No longer is he an instinctive savage but a\ncreature of almost incredible variability and wonderful new\npossibilities. Marvels undreamt of, power still inconceivable, an empire\nbeyond the uttermost stars; such is man's inheritance. But for the\npresent, until we get a mastery of those vague and mighty intimations at\nonce so perplexing and so reassuring, if we are to live at all in the\nmultitudinousness of human society we must submit to some scheme of\nclumsy compromises and conventions or other,--and for us Strattons the\nHarbury system is the most convenient. You will have to go to the old\nschool.\n\nI went to Rendle's. I just missed getting into college; I was two places\nbelow the lowest successful boy. I was Maxton's fag to begin with, and\nmy chief chum was Raymond, who is your friend also, and who comes so\noften to this house. I preferred water to land, boats to cricket,\nbecause of that difficulty about pitch I have already mentioned. But I\nwas no great sportsman. Raymond and I shared a boat, and spent most of\nthe time we gave to it under the big trees near Dartpool Lock, reading\nor talking. We would pull up to Sandy Hall perhaps once a week. I never\nrowed in any of the eights, though I was urged to do so. I swam fairly\nwell, and got my colors on the strength of my diving.\n\nOn the whole I found Harbury a satisfactory and amusing place, I was\nneither bullied nor do I think I greatly bullied, and of all that\nfurtive and puerile lasciviousness of which one hears so many hints\nnowadays--excitable people talk of it as though it was the most\nmonstrous and singular of vices instead of a slightly debasing but\nalmost unavoidable and very obvious result of heaping boys together\nunder the inefficient control of a timid pretentious class of men--of\nsuch uncleanness as I say, scarcely more than a glimpse and a whisper\nand a vague tentative talk or so reached me. Little more will reach you,\nfor that kind of thing, like the hells of Swedenborg, finds its own.\n\nI had already developed my growing instinct for observance to a very\nconsiderable extent under Siddons, and at Harbury I remember myself, and\npeople remember me, as an almost stiffly correct youth. I was pretty\ngood at most of the work, and exceptionally so at history, geology, and\nthe biological side of natural science. I had to restrain my interest in\nthese latter subjects lest I should appear to be a \"swat,\" and a\nmodern-side swat at that. I was early in the sixth, and rather a\nfavorite with old Latimer. He incited me to exercise what he called a\nwholesome influence on the younger boys, and I succeeded in doing this\nfairly well without any gross interventions. I implied rather than\nprofessed soundly orthodox views about things in general, and I was\nextremely careful to tilt my straw hat forward over my nose so as just\nnot to expose the crown of my head behind, and to turn up my trousers\nwith exactly that width of margin which the judgment of my\nfellow-creatures had decided was correct. My socks were spirited without\nbeing vulgar, and the ties I wore were tied with a studious avoidance\nof either slovenliness or priggish neatness. I wrote two articles in the\nHarburonian, became something of a debater in the Literacy and\nPolitical, conducted many long conversations with my senior\ncontemporaries upon religion, politics, sport and social life, and\nconcealed my inmost thoughts from every human being. Indeed, so\neffective had been the training of Harbury and Mr. Siddons, that I think\nat that time I came very near concealing them from myself. I could\nsuppress wonder, I could pass by beauty as if I did not see it, almost I\nthink I did not see it for a time, and yet I remember it in those years\ntoo--a hundred beautiful things.\n\nHarbury itself is a very beautiful place. The country about it has all\nthe charm of river scenery in a settled and ancient land, and the great\ncastle and piled town of Wetmore, cliffs of battlemented grey wall\nrising above a dense cluster of red roofs, form the background to\ninnumerable gracious prospects of great stream-fed trees, level meadows\nof buttercups, sweeping curves of osier and rush-rimmed river, the\nplaying fields and the sedgy, lily-spangled levels of Avonlea. The\ncollege itself is mostly late Tudor and Stuart brickwork, very ripe and\nmellow now, but the great grey chapel with its glorious east window\nfloats over the whole like a voice singing in the evening. And the\nevening cloudscapes of Harbury are a perpetual succession of glorious\neffects, now serene, now mysteriously threatening and profound, now\ntowering to incredible heights, now revealing undreamt-of distances of\nluminous color. Assuredly I must have delighted in all those aspects, or\nwhy should I remember them so well? But I recall, I mean, no confessed\nrecognition of them; no deliberate going-out of my spirit, open and\nunashamed, to such things.\n\nI suppose one's early adolescence is necessarily the period of maximum\nshyness in one's life. Even to Raymond I attempted no extremities of\nconfidence. Even to myself I tried to be the thing that was expected of\nme. I professed a modest desire for temperate and tolerable achievement\nin life, though deep in my lost depths I wanted passionately to excel; I\nworked hard, much harder than I allowed to appear, and I said I did it\nfor the credit of the school; I affected a dignified loyalty to queen\nand country and church; I pretended a stoical disdain for appetites and\ndelights and all the arts, though now and then a chance fragment of\npoetry would light me like a fire, or a lovely picture stir unwonted\nurgencies, though visions of delight haunted the shadows of my\nimagination and did not always fly when I regarded them. But on the\nother hand I affected an interest in games that I was far from feeling.\nOf some boys I was violently jealous, and this also I masked beneath a\ngenerous appreciation. Certain popularities I applauded while I doubted.\nWhatever my intimate motives I became less and less disposed to obey\nthem until I had translated them into a plausible rendering of the\naccepted code. If I could not so translate them I found it wise to\ncontrol them. When I wanted urgently one summer to wander by night over\nthe hills towards Kestering and lie upon heather and look up at the\nstars and wonder about them, I cast about and at last hit upon the\nwell-known and approved sport of treacling for moths, as a cloak for so\nstrange an indulgence.\n\nI must have known even then what a mask and front I was, because I knew\nquite well how things were with other people. I listened politely and\nrespected and understood the admirable explanations of my friends. When\nsome fellow got a scholarship unexpectedly and declared it was rotten\nbad luck on the other chap, seeing the papers he had done, and doubted\nwhether he shouldn't resign, I had an intuitive knowledge that he\nwouldn't resign, and I do not remember any time in my career as the\nrespectful listener to Mr. Siddons' aspirations for service and\ndevotion, when I did not perceive quite clearly his undeviating eye upon\na bishopric. He thought of gaiters though he talked of wings.\n\nHow firmly the bonds of an old relationship can hold one! I remember\nwhen a few years ago he reached that toiled-for goal, I wrote in a tone\nof gratified surprise that in this blatant age, such disinterested\neffort as his should receive even so belated a recognition. Yet what\nelse was there for me to write? We all have our Siddonses, with whom\nthere are no alternatives but insincerity or a disproportionate\ndestructiveness. I am still largely Siddonsized, little son, and so, I\nfear, you will have to be.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 7\n\nThe clue to all the perplexities of law and custom lies in this, that\nhuman association is an artificiality. We do not run together naturally\nand easily as grazing deer do or feeding starlings or a shoal of fish.\nWe are a sort of creature which is only resuming association after a\nlong heredity of extreme separation. We are beings strongly\nindividualized, we are dominated by that passion which is no more and\nno less than individuality in action,--jealousy. Jealousy is a fierce\ninsistence on ourselves, an instinctive intolerance of our\nfellow-creatures, ranging between an insatiable aggression as its\nbuoyant phase and a savage defensiveness when it is touched by fear. In\nour expansive moments we want to dominate and control everyone and\ndestroy every unlikeness to ourselves; in our recessive phases our homes\nare our castles and we want to be let alone.\n\nNow all law, all social order, all custom, is a patch-up and a\nconcession to this separating passion of self-insistence. It is an\nevasion of conflict and social death. Human society is as yet only a\ntruce and not an alliance.\n\nWhen you understand that, you will begin to understand a thousand\nperplexing things in legislation and social life. You will understand\nthe necessity of all those restrictions that are called\n\"conventionality,\" and the inevitableness of the general hostility to\nsingularity. To be exceptional is to assert a difference, to disregard\nthe banked-up forces of jealousy and break the essential conditions of\nthe social contract. It invites either resentment or aggression. So we\nall wear much the same clothing, affect modesty, use the same phrases,\nrespect one another's \"rights,\" and pretend a greater disinterestedness\nthan we feel....\n\nYou have to face this reality as you must face all reality. This is the\nreality of laws and government; this is the reality of customs and\ninstitutions; _a convention between jealousies_. This is reality, just\nas the cat's way with the nestlings was reality, and the squealing rat\none smashed in a paroxysm of cruelty and disgust in the barn.\n\nBut it isn't the only reality. Equally real is the passionate revolt of\nmy heart against cruelty, and the deep fluctuating impulse not to\npretend, to set aside fear and jealousy, to come nakedly out of the\ncompromises and secretive methods of every-day living into the light,\ninto a wide impersonal love, into a new way of living for mankind....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE THIRD\n\nINTENTIONS AND THE LADY MARY CHRISTIAN\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 1\n\nI know that before the end of my Harbury days I was already dreaming of\na Career, of some great and conspicuous usefulness in the world. That\nhas always haunted my mind and haunts it now. I may be cured perhaps of\nthe large and showy anticipations of youth, I may have learnt to drop\nthe \"great and conspicuous,\" but still I find it necessary to believe\nthat I matter, that I play a part no one else can play in a progress, in\na universal scheme moving towards triumphant ends.\n\nAlmost wholly I think I was dreaming of public service in those days.\nThe Harbury tradition pointed steadfastly towards the state, and all my\nworld was bare of allurements to any other type of ambition. Success in\nart or literature did not appeal to us, and a Harbury boy would as soon\nthink of being a great tinker as a great philosopher. Science we called\n\"stinks\"; our three science masters were _ex officio_ ridiculous and the\npractical laboratory a refuge for oddities. But a good half of our\nfathers at least were peers or members of parliament, and our sense of\npolitics was close and keen. History, and particularly history as it\ncame up through the eighteenth century to our own times, supplied us\nwith a gallery of intimate models, our great uncles and grandfathers and\nancestors at large figured abundantly in the story and furnished the\npattern to which we cut our anticipations of life. It was a season of\nImperialism, the picturesque Imperialism of the earlier Kipling phase,\nand we were all of us enthusiasts for the Empire. It was the empire of\nthe White Man's Burthen in those days; the sordid anti-climax of the\nTariff Reform Movement was still some years ahead of us. It was easier\nfor us at Harbury to believe then than it has become since, in our own\nracial and national and class supremacy. We were the Anglo-Saxons, the\nelect of the earth, leading the world in social organization, in science\nand economic method. In India and the east more particularly we were the\napostles of even-handed justice, relentless veracity, personal\ncleanliness, and modern efficiency. In a spirit of adventurous\nbenevolence we were spreading those blessings over a reluctant and\noccasionally recalcitrant world of people for the most part \"colored.\"\nOur success in this had aroused the bitter envy and rivalry of various\ncontinental nations, and particularly of France, Russia, and Germany.\nBut France had been diverted to North Africa, Russia to Eastern Asia,\nand Germany was already the most considered antagonist in our path\ntowards an empire over the world.\n\nThis was the spacious and by no means ignoble project of the later\nnineties. Most of us Harbury boys, trained as I had been trained to be\nuncritical, saw the national outlook in those terms. We knew little or\nnothing, until the fierce wranglings of the Free Traders and Tariff\nReformers a few years later brought it home to us, of the commercial,\nfinancial and squalid side of our relations with the vast congeries of\nexploited new territories and subordinated and subjugated populations.\nWe knew nothing of the social conditions of the mass of people in our\nown country. We were blankly ignorant of economics. We knew nothing of\nthat process of expropriation and the exploitation of labor which is\ngiving the world the Servile State. The very phrase was twenty years\nahead of us. We believed that an Englishman was a better thing in every\nway than any other sort of man, that English literature, science and\nphilosophy were a shining and unapproachable light to all other peoples,\nthat our soldiers were better than all other soldiers and our sailors\nthan all other sailors. Such civilization and enterprise as existed in\nGermany for instance we regarded as a shadow, an envious shadow,\nfollowing our own; it was still generally believed in those days that\nGerman trade was concerned entirely with the dishonest imitation of our\nunapproachable English goods. And as for the United States, well, the\nUnited States though blessed with a strain of English blood, were\nnevertheless \"out of it,\" marooned in a continent of their own and--we\nhad to admit it--corrupt.\n\nGiven such ignorance, you know, it wasn't by any means ignoble to be\npatriotic, to dream of this propagandist Empire of ours spreading its\ngreat peace and culture, its virtue and its amazing and unprecedented\nhonesty,--its honesty!--round the world.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 2\n\nWhen I look and try to recover those early intentions of mine I am\nastonished at the way in which I took them ready-made from the world\nimmediately about me. In some way I seem to have stopped looking--if\never I had begun looking--at the heights and depths above and below that\nimmediate life. I seem to have regarded these profounder realities no\nmore during this phase of concentration than a cow in a field regards\nthe sky. My father's vestments, the Burnmore altar, the Harbury pulpit\nand Mr. Siddons, stood between me and the idea of God, so that it needed\nyears and much bitter disillusionment before I discovered my need of it.\nAnd I was as wanting in subtlety as in depth. We did no logic nor\nphilosophy at Harbury, and at Oxford it was not so much thought we came\nto deal with as a mistranslation and vulgarization of ancient and alien\nexercises in thinking. There is no such effective serum against\nphilosophy as the scholarly decoction of a dead philosopher. The\nphilosophical teaching of Oxford at the end of the last century was not\nso much teaching as a protective inoculation. The stuff was administered\nwith a mysterious gilding of Greek and reverence, old Hegel's monstrous\nweb was the ultimate modernity, and Plato, that intellectual\njournalist-artist, that bright, restless experimentalist in ideas, was\nas it were the God of Wisdom, only a little less omniscient (and on the\nwhole more of a scholar and a gentleman) than the God of fact....\n\nSo I fell back upon the empire in my first attempts to unify my life. I\nwould serve the empire. That should be my total significance. There was\na Roman touch, I perceive, in this devotion. Just how or where I should\nserve the empire I had not as yet determined. At times I thought of the\ncivil service, in my more ambitious moments I turned my thoughts to\npolitics. But it was doubtful whether my private expectations made the\nlast a reasonable possibility.\n\nI would serve the empire.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 3\n\nAnd all the while that the first attempts to consolidate, to gather\none's life together into a purpose and a plan of campaign, are going on\nupon the field of the young man's life, there come and go and come again\nin the sky above him the threatening clouds, the ethereal cirrus, the\nred dawns and glowing afternoons of that passion of love which is the\nsource and renewal of being. There are times when that solicitude\nmatters no more than a spring-time sky to a runner who wins towards the\npost, there are times when its passionate urgency dominates every fact\nin his world.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 4\n\nOne must have children and love them passionately before one realizes\nthe deep indignity of accident in life. It is not that I mind so much\nwhen unexpected and disconcerting things happen to you or your sisters,\nbut that I mind before they happen. My dreams and anticipations of your\nlives are all marred by my sense of the huge importance mere chance\nencounters and incalculable necessities will play in them. And in\nfriendship and still more here, in this central business of love,\naccident rules it seems to me almost altogether. What personalities you\nwill encounter in life, and have for a chief interest in life, is nearly\nas much a matter of chance as the drift of a grain of pollen in the\npine forest. And once the light hazard has blown it has blown, never to\ndrive again. In other schoolrooms and nurseries, in slum living-rooms\nperhaps or workhouse wards or palaces, round the other side of the\nearth, in Canada or Russia or China, other little creatures are trying\ntheir small limbs, clutching at things about them with infantile hands,\nwho someday will come into your life with a power and magic monstrous\nand irrational and irresistible. They will break the limits of your\nconcentrating self, call you out to the service of beauty and the\nservice of the race, sound you to your highest and your lowest, give you\nyour chance to be godlike or filthy, divine or utterly ignoble, react\ntogether with you upon the very core and essence of your being. These\nunknowns are the substance of your fate. You will in extreme intimacy\nlove them, hate them, serve them, struggle with them, and in that\ninteraction the vital force in you and the substance of your days will\nbe spent.\n\nAnd who they may chance to be and their peculiar quality and effect is\nhaphazard, utterly beyond designing.\n\nLaw and custom conspire with the natural circumstances of man to\nexaggerate every consequence of this accumulating accident, and make it\ndefinite and fatal....\n\nI find it quite impossible now to recall the steps and stages by which\nthis power of sex invaded my life. It seems to me now that it began very\nmuch as a gale begins, in catspaws upon the water and little rustlings\namong the leaves, and then stillness and then a distant soughing again\nand a pause, and then a wider and longer disturbance and so more and\nmore, with a gathering continuity, until at last the stars were hidden,\nthe heavens were hidden; all the heights and depths of life were\nobscured by stormy impulses and passionate desires. I suppose that\nquite at the first there were simple curiosities; no doubt they were\nvivid at the time but they have left scarcely a trace; there were vague\nfirst intimations of a peculiar excitement. I do remember more\ndistinctly phases when there was a going-out from myself towards these\nthings, these interests, and then a reaction of shame and concealment.\n\nAnd these memories were mixed up with others not sexual at all, and\nparticularly with the perception of beauty in things inanimate, with\nlights seen at twilight and the tender mysteriousness of the dusk and\nthe confused disturbing scents of flowers in the evening and the\nenigmatical serene animation of stars in the summer sky....\n\nI think perhaps that my boyhood was exceptionally free from vulgarizing\ninfluences in this direction. There were few novels in my father's house\nand I neither saw nor read any plays until I was near manhood, so that I\nthought naturally about love and not rather artificially round and about\nlove as so many imaginative young people are trained to do. I fell in\nlove once or twice while I was still quite a boy. These earliest\nexperiences rarely got beyond a sort of dumb awe, a vague, vast,\nineffectual desire for self-immolation. For a time I remember I\nworshipped Lady Ladislaw with all my being. Then I talked to a girl in a\ntrain--I forget upon what journey--but I remember very vividly her quick\ncolor and a certain roguish smile. I spread my adoration at her feet,\nfresh and frank. I wanted to write to her. Indeed I wanted to devote all\nmy being to her. I begged hard, but there was someone called Auntie who\nhad to be considered, an Atropos for that thread of romance.\n\nThen there was a photograph in my father's study of the Delphic Sibyl\nfrom the Sistine Chapel, that for a time held my heart, and--Yes, there\nwas a girl in a tobacconist's shop in the Harbury High Street. Drawn by\nan irresistible impulse I used to go and buy cigarettes--and sometimes\nconverse about the weather. But afterwards in solitude I would meditate\ntremendous conversations and encounters with her. The cigarettes\nincreased the natural melancholy of my state and led to a reproof from\nold Henson. Almost always I suppose there is that girl in the\ntobacconist's shop....\n\nI believe if I made an effort I could disinter some dozens of such\nmemories, more and more faded until the marginal ones would be\nfeatureless and all but altogether effaced. As I look back at it now I\nam struck by an absurd image; it is as if a fish nibbled at this bait\nand then at that.\n\nGiven but the slightest aid from accidental circumstances and any of\nthose slight attractions might have become a power to deflect all my\nlife.\n\nThe day of decision arrived when, the Lady Mary Christian came smiling\nout of the sunshine to me into the pavilion at Burnmore. With that the\nphase of stirrings and intimations was over for ever in my life. All\nthose other impressions went then to the dusty lumber room from which I\nnow so slightingly disinter them.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 5\n\nWe five had all been playmates together. There were Lord Maxton, who was\nkilled at Paardeberg while I was in Ladysmith, he was my senior by\nnearly a year, Philip, who is now Earl Ladislaw and who was about\neighteen months younger than I, Mary, my contemporary within eight days,\nand Guy, whom we regarded as a baby and who was called, apparently on\naccount of some early linguistic efforts, \"Brugglesmith.\" He did his\nbest to avenge his juniority as time passed on by an enormous length of\nlimb. I had more imagination than Maxton and was a good deal better\nread, so that Mary and I dominated most of the games of Indians and\nwarfare and exploration in which we passed our long days together. When\nthe Christians were at Burnmore, and they usually spent three or four\nmonths in the year there, I had a kind of standing invitation to be with\nthem. Sometimes there would also be two Christian cousins to swell our\nparty, and sometimes there would be a raid of the Fawney children with a\ndetestable governess who was perpetually vociferating reproaches, but\nthese latter were absent-minded, lax young persons, and we did not\ngreatly love them.\n\nIt is curious how little I remember of Mary's childhood. All that has\nhappened between us since lies between that and my present self like\nsome luminous impenetrable mist. I know we liked each other, that I was\ntaller than she was and thought her legs unreasonably thin, and that\nonce when I knelt by accident on a dead stick she had brought into an\nIndian camp we had made near the end of the west shrubbery, she flew at\nme in a sudden fury, smacked my face, scratched me and had to be\nsuppressed, and was suppressed with extreme difficulty by the united\nmanhood of us three elder boys. Then it was I noted first the blazing\nblueness of her eyes. She was light and very plucky, so that none of us\ncared to climb against her, and she was as difficult to hold as an eel.\nBut all these traits and characteristics vanished when she was\ntransformed.\n\nFor what seems now a long space of time I had not seen her or any of the\nfamily except Philip; it was certainly a year or more, probably two;\nMaxton was at a crammer's and I think the others must have been in\nCanada with Lord Ladislaw. Then came some sort of estrangement between\nhim and his wife, and she returned with Mary and Guy to Burnmore and\nstayed there all through the summer.\n\nI was in a state of transition between the infinitely great and the\ninfinitely little. I had just ceased to be that noble and potent being,\nthat almost statesmanlike personage, a sixth form boy at Harbury, and I\nwas going to be an Oxford undergraduate. Philip and I came down together\nby the same train from Harbury, I shared the Burnmore dog-cart and\nluggage cart, and he dropped me at the rectory. I was a long-limbed\nyoungster of seventeen, as tall as I am now, and fair, so fair that I\nwas still boyish-faced while most of my contemporaries and Philip (who\nfavored his father) were at least smudgy with moustaches. With the\nhead-master's valediction and the grave elder-brotherliness of old\nHenson, and the shrill cheers of a little crowd of juniors still echoing\nin my head, I very naturally came home in a mood of exalted gravity, and\nI can still remember pacing up and down the oblong lawn behind the\nrockery and the fig-tree wall with my father, talking of my outlook with\nall the tremendous _savoir faire_ that was natural to my age, and noting\nwith a secret gratification that our shoulders were now on a level. No\ndoubt we were discussing Oxford and all that I was to do at Oxford; I\ndon't remember a word of our speech though I recall the exact tint of\nits color and the distinctive feeling of our measured equal paces in the\nsunshine....\n\nI must have gone up to Burnmore House the following afternoon. I went up\nalone and I was sent out through the little door at the end of the big\ngallery into the garden. In those days Lady Ladislaw had made an Indian\npavilion under the tall trees at the east end of the house, and here I\nfound her with her cousin Helena Christian entertaining a mixture of\npeople, a carriageful from Hampton End, the two elder Fawneys and a man\nin brown who had I think ridden over from Chestoxter Castle. Lady\nLadislaw welcomed me with ample graciousness--as though I was a\npersonage. \"The children\" she said were still at tennis, and as she\nspoke I saw Guy, grown nearly beyond recognition and then a shining\nbeing in white, very straight and graceful, with a big soft hat and\novershadowed eyes that smiled, come out from the hurried endearments of\nthe sunflakes under the shadows of the great chestnuts, into the glow of\nsummer light before the pavilion.\n\n\"Steve arrived!\" she cried, and waved a welcoming racquet.\n\nI do not remember what I said to her or what else she said or what\nanyone said. But I believe I could paint every detail of her effect. I\nknow that when she came out of the brightness into the shadow of the\npavilion it was like a regal condescension, and I know that she was\nwonderfully self-possessed and helpful with her mother's hospitalities,\nand that I marvelled I had never before perceived the subtler sweetness\nin the cadence of her voice. I seem also to remember a severe internal\nstruggle for my self-possession, and that I had to recall my exalted\nposition in the sixth form to save myself from becoming tongue-tied and\nabashed and awkward and utterly shamed.\n\nYou see she had her hair up and very prettily dressed, and those\naggressive lean legs of hers had vanished, and she was sheathed in\nmuslin that showed her the most delicately slender and beautiful of\nyoung women. And she seemed so radiantly sure of herself!\n\nAfter our first greeting I do not think I spoke to her or looked at her\nagain throughout the meal. I took things that she handed me with an\nappearance of supreme indifference, was politely attentive to the elder\nMiss Fawney, and engaged with Lady Ladislaw and the horsey little man in\nbrown in a discussion of the possibility of mechanical vehicles upon the\nhigh road. That was in the early nineties. We were all of opinion that\nit was impossible to make a sufficiently light engine for the purpose.\nAfterwards Mary confessed to me how she had been looking forward to our\nmeeting, and how snubbed I had made her feel....\n\nThen a little later than this meeting in the pavilion, though I am not\nclear now whether it was the same or some subsequent afternoon, we are\nwalking in the sunken garden, and great clouds of purple clematis and\nsome less lavish heliotrope-colored creeper, foam up against the ruddy\nstone balustrading. Just in front of us a fountain gushes out of a\ngrotto of artificial stalagmite and bathes the pedestal of an absurd\nlittle statuette of the God of Love. We are talking almost easily. She\nlooks sideways at my face, already with the quiet controlled\nwatchfulness of a woman interested in a man, she smiles and she talks of\nflowers and sunshine, the Canadian winter--and with an abrupt\ntransition, of old times we've had together in the shrubbery and the\nwilderness of bracken out beyond. She seems tremendously grown-up and\nwomanly to me. I am talking my best, and glad, and in a manner scared at\nthe thrill her newly discovered beauty gives me, and keeping up my\ndignity and coherence with an effort. My attention is constantly being\ndistracted to note how prettily she moves, to wonder why it is I never\nnoticed the sweet fall, the faint delightful whisper of a lisp in her\nvoice before.\n\nWe agree about the flowers and the sunshine and the Canadian\nwinter--about everything. \"I think so often of those games we used to\ninvent,\" she declares. \"So do I,\" I say, \"so do I.\" And then with a\nsudden boldness: \"Once I broke a stick of yours, a rotten stick you\nthought a sound one. Do you remember?\"\n\nThen we laugh together and seem to approach across a painful,\nunnecessary distance that has separated us. It vanishes for ever. \"I\ncouldn't now,\" she says, \"smack your face like that, Stephen.\"\n\nThat seems to me a brilliantly daring and delightful thing for her to\nsay, and jolly of her to use my Christian name too! \"I believe I\nscratched,\" she adds.\n\n\"You never scratched,\" I assert with warm conviction. \"Never.\"\n\n\"I did,\" she insists and I deny. \"You couldn't.\"\n\n\"We're growing up,\" she cries. \"That's what has happened to us. We shall\nnever fight again with our hands and feet, never--until death do us\npart.\"\n\n\"For better, or worse,\" I say, with a sense of wit and enterprise beyond\nall human precedent.\n\n\"For richer, or poorer,\" she cries, taking up my challenge with a\nlifting laugh in her voice.\n\nAnd then to make it all nothing again, she exclaims at the white lilies\nthat rise against masses of sweet bay along the further wall....\n\nHow plainly I can recall it all! How plainly and how brightly! As we\ncame up the broad steps at the further end towards the tennis lawn, she\nturned suddenly upon me and with a novel assurance of command told me to\nstand still. \"_There_,\" she said with a hand out and seemed to survey me\nwith her chin up and her white neck at the level of my eyes. \"Yes. A\nwhole step,\" she estimated, \"and more, taller than I. You will look down\non me, Stephen, now, for all the rest of our days.\"\n\n\"I shall always stand,\" I answered, \"a step or so below you.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"come up to the level. A girl should be smaller than a\nman. You are a man, Stephen--almost.... You must be near six feet....\nHere's Guy with the box of balls.\"\n\nShe flitted about the tennis court before me, playing with Philip\nagainst Guy and myself. She punished some opening condescensions with a\nwicked vigor--and presently Guy and I were straining every nerve to save\nthe set. She had a low close serve I remember that seemed perfectly\nstraightforward and simple, and was very difficult to return.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 6\n\nAll that golden summer on the threshold of my manhood was filled by\nMary. I loved her with the love of a boy and a man. Either I was with\nMary or I was hoping and planning to be with Mary or I was full of some\nvivid new impression of her or some enigmatical speech, some pregnant\nnothing, some glance or gesture engaged and perplexed my mind. In those\ndays I slept the profound sweet sleep of youth, but whenever that deep\nflow broke towards the shallows, as I sank into it at night and came out\nof it at morning, I passed through dreams of Mary to and from a world of\nwaking thought of her.\n\nThere must have been days of friendly intercourse when it seemed we\ntalked nothings and wandered and meandered among subjects, but always we\nhad our eyes on one another. And afterwards I would spend long hours in\nrecalling and analyzing those nothings, questioning their nothingness,\nmaking out of things too submerged and impalpable for the rough drags of\nrecollection, promises and indications. I would invent ingenious things\nto say, things pushing out suddenly from nothingness to extreme\nsignificance. I rehearsed a hundred declarations.\n\nIt was easy for us to be very much together. We were very free that\nsummer and life was all leisure. Lady Ladislaw was busied with her own\nconcerns; she sometimes went away for two or three days leaving no one\nbut an attenuated governess with even the shadow of a claim to interfere\nwith Mary. Moreover she was used to seeing me with her children at\nBurnmore; we were still in her eyes no more than children.... And also\nperhaps she did not greatly mind if indeed we did a little fall in love\ntogether. To her that may have seemed a very natural and slight and\ntransitory possibility....\n\nOne afternoon of warm shadows in the wood near the red-lacquered Chinese\nbridge, we two were alone together and we fell silent. I was trembling\nand full of a wild courage. I can feel now the exquisite surmise, the\ndoubt of that moment. Our eyes met. She looked up at me with an\nunwonted touch of fear in her expression and I laid my hands on her. She\ndid not recoil, she stood mute with her lips pressed together, looking\nat me steadfastly. I can feel that moment now as a tremendous\nhesitation, blank and yet full of light and life, like a clear sky in\nthe moment before dawn....\n\nShe made a little move towards me. Impulsively, with no word said, we\nkissed.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 7\n\nI would like very much to give you a portrait of Mary as she was in\nthose days. Every portrait I ever had of her I burnt in the sincerity of\nwhat was to have been our final separation, and now I have nothing of\nher in my possession. I suppose that in the files of old illustrated\nweeklies somewhere, a score of portraits must be findable. Yet\nphotographs have a queer quality of falsehood. They have no movement and\nalways there was a little movement about Mary just as there is always a\nlittle scent about flowers. She was slender and graceful, so that she\nseemed taller than she was, she had beautifully shaped arms and a\nbrightness in her face; it seemed to me always that there was light in\nher face, more than the light that shone upon it. Her fair, very\nslightly reddish hair--it was warm like Australian gold--flowed with a\nsort of joyous bravery back from her low broad forehead; the color under\nher delicate skin was bright and quick, and her mouth always smiled\nfaintly. There was a peculiar charm for me about her mouth, a\nwhimsicality, a sort of humorous resolve in the way in which the upper\nlip fell upon the lower and in a faint obliquity that increased with\nher quickening smile. She spoke with a very clear delicate intonation\nthat made one want to hear her speak again; she often said faintly\ndaring things, and when she did, she had that little catch in the\nbreath--of one who dares. She did not talk hastily; often before she\nspoke came a brief grave pause. Her eyes were brightly blue except when\nthe spirit of mischief took her and then they became black, and there\nwas something about the upper and lower lids that made them not only the\nprettiest but the sweetest and kindliest eyes in the world. And she\nmoved with a quiet rapidity, without any needless movements, to do\nwhatever she had a mind to do....\n\nBut how impossible it is to convey the personal charm of a human being.\nI catalogue these things and it is as if she moved about silently behind\nmy stumbling enumeration and smiled at me still, with her eyes a little\ndarkened, mocking me. That phantom will never be gone from my mind. It\nwas all of these things and none of these things that made me hers, as I\nhave never been any other person's....\n\nWe grew up together. The girl of nineteen mingles in my memory with the\nwoman of twenty-five.\n\nAlways we were equals, or if anything she was the better of us two. I\nnever made love to her in the commoner sense of the word, a sense in\nwhich the woman is conceived of as shy, unawakened, younger, more\nplastic, and the man as tempting, creating responses, persuading and\ncompelling. We made love to each other as youth should, we were friends\nlit by a passion.... I think that is the best love. If I could wish your\nfuture I would have you love someone neither older and stronger nor\nyounger and weaker than yourself. I would have you have neither a toy\nnor a devotion, for the one makes the woman contemptible and the other\nthe man. There should be something almost sisterly between you. Love\nneither a goddess nor a captive woman. But I would wish you a better\nfate in your love than chanced to me.\n\nMary was not only naturally far more quick-minded, more swiftly\nunderstanding than I, but more widely educated. Mine was the stiff\nlimited education of the English public school and university; I could\nnot speak and read and think French and German as she could for all that\nI had a pedantic knowledge of the older forms of those tongues; and the\nclassics and mathematics upon which I had spent the substance of my\nyears were indeed of little use to me, have never been of any real use\nto me, they were ladders too clumsy to carry about and too short to\nreach anything. My general ideas came from the newspapers and the\nreviews. She on the other hand had read much, had heard no end of good\nconversation, the conversation of people who mattered, had thought for\nherself and had picked the brains of her brothers. Her mother had let\nher read whatever books she liked, partly because she believed that was\nthe proper thing to do, and partly because it was so much less trouble\nto be liberal in such things.\n\nWe had the gravest conversations.\n\nI do not remember that we talked much of love, though we were very much\nin love. We kissed; sometimes greatly daring we walked hand in hand;\nonce I took her in my arms and carried her over a swampy place beyond\nthe Killing Wood, and held her closely to me; that was a great event\nbetween us; but we were shy of one another, shy even of very intimate\nwords; and a thousand daring and beautiful things I dreamt of saying to\nher went unsaid. I do not remember any endearing names from that time.\nBut we jested and shared our humors, shaped our developing ideas in\nquaint forms to amuse one another and talked--as young men talk\ntogether.\n\nWe talked of religion; I think she was the first person to thaw the\nprivate silences that had kept me bound in these matters even from\nmyself for years. I can still recall her face, a little flushed and\ncoming nearer to mine after avowals and comparisons. \"But Stephen,\" she\nsays; \"if none of these things are really true, why do they keep on\ntelling them to us? What is true? What are we for? What is Everything\nfor?\"\n\nI remember the awkwardness I felt at these indelicate thrusts into\ntopics I had come to regard as forbidden.\n\n\"I suppose there's a sort of truth in them,\" I said, and then more\nSiddonsesquely: \"endless people wiser than we are----\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"But that doesn't matter to us. Endless people wiser\nthan we are have said one thing, and endless people wiser than we are\nhave said exactly the opposite. It's _we_ who have to understand--for\nourselves.... We don't understand, Stephen.\"\n\nI was forced to a choice between faith and denial. But I parried with\nquestions. \"Don't you,\" I asked, \"feel there is a God?\"\n\nShe hesitated. \"There is something--something very beautiful,\" she said\nand stopped as if her breath had gone. \"That is all I know, Stephen....\"\n\nAnd I remember too that we talked endlessly about the things I was to do\nin the world. I do not remember that we talked about the things she was\nto do, by some sort of instinct and some sort of dexterity she evaded\nthat, from the very first she had reserves from me, but my career and\npurpose became as it were the form in which we discussed all the\npurposes of life. I became Man in her imagination, the protagonist of\nthe world. At first I displayed the modest worthy desire for respectable\nservice that Harbury had taught me, but her clear, sceptical little\nvoice pierced and tore all those pretences to shreds. \"Do some decent\npublic work,\" I said, or some such phrase.\n\n\"But is that All you want?\" I hear her asking. \"Is that All you want?\"\n\nI lay prone upon the turf and dug up a root of grass with my penknife.\n\"Before I met you it was,\" I said.\n\n\"And now?\"\n\n\"I want you.\"\n\n\"I'm nothing to want. I want you to want all the world.... _Why\nshouldn't you?_\"\n\nI think I must have talked of the greatness of serving the empire. \"Yes,\nbut splendidly,\" she insisted. \"Not doing little things for other\npeople--who aren't doing anything at all. I want you to conquer people\nand lead people.... When I see you, Stephen, sometimes--I almost wish I\nwere a man. In order to be able to do all the things that you are going\nto do.\"\n\n\"For you,\" I said, \"for you.\"\n\nI stretched out my hand for hers, and my gesture went disregarded.\n\nShe sat rather crouched together with her eyes gazing far away across\nthe great spaces of the park.\n\n\"That is what women are for,\" she said. \"To make men see how splendid\nlife can be. To lift them up--out of a sort of timid grubbiness----\" She\nturned upon me suddenly. \"Stephen,\" she said, \"promise me. Whatever you\nbecome, you promise and swear here and now never to be grey and grubby,\nnever to be humpy and snuffy, never to be respectable and modest and\ndull and a little fat, like--like everybody. Ever.\"\n\n\"I swear,\" I said.\n\n\"By me.\"\n\n\"By you. No book to kiss! Please, give me your hand.\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 8\n\nAll through that summer we saw much of each other. I was up at the House\nperhaps every other day; we young people were supposed to be all in a\ncompany together down by the tennis lawns, but indeed we dispersed and\ncame and went by a kind of tacit understanding, Guy and Philip each with\none of the Fawney girls and I with Mary. I put all sorts of\nconstructions upon the freedom I was given with her, but I perceive now\nthat we still seemed scarcely more than children to Lady Ladislaw, and\nthat the idea of our marriage was as inconceivable to her as if we had\nbeen brother and sister. Matrimonially I was as impossible as one of the\nstable boys. All the money I could hope to earn for years to come would\nnot have sufficed even to buy Mary clothes. But as yet we thought little\nof matters so remote, glad in our wonderful new discovery of love, and\nwhen at last I went off to Oxford, albeit the parting moved us to much\ntenderness and vows and embraces, I had no suspicion that never more in\nall our lives would Mary and I meet freely and gladly without\nrestriction. Yet so it was. From that day came restraints and\ndifficulties; the shadow of furtiveness fell between us; our\ncorrespondence had to be concealed.\n\nI went to Oxford as one goes into exile; she to London. I would post to\nher so that the letters reached Landor House before lunch time when the\nsun of Lady Ladislaw came over the horizon, but indeed as yet no one was\nwatching her letters. Afterwards as she moved about she gave me other\ninstructions, and for the most part I wrote to her in envelopes\naddressed for her by one of the Fawney girls, who was under her spell\nand made no enquiry for what purpose these envelopes were needed.\n\nTo me of course Mary wrote without restraint. All her letters to me were\ndestroyed after our crisis, but some of mine to her she kept for many\nyears; at last they came back to me so that I have them now. And for all\ntheir occasional cheapness and crudity, I do not find anything in them\nto be ashamed of. They reflect, they are chiefly concerned with that\nsearch for a career of fine service which was then the chief\npreoccupation of my mind, the bias is all to a large imperialism, but it\nis manifest that already the first ripples of a rising tide of criticism\nagainst the imperialist movement had reached and were exercising me. In\none letter I am explaining that imperialism is not a mere\naggressiveness, but the establishment of peace and order throughout half\nthe world. \"We may never withdraw,\" I wrote with all the confidence of a\nForeign Secretary, \"from all these great territories of ours, but we\nshall stay only to raise their peoples ultimately to an equal\ncitizenship with ourselves.\" And then in the same letter: \"and if I do\nnot devote myself to the Empire what else is there that gives anything\nlike the same opportunity of a purpose in life.\" I find myself in\nanother tolerantly disposed to \"accept socialism,\" but manifestly\nhostile to \"the narrow mental habits of the socialists.\" The large note\nof youth! And in another I am clearly very proud and excited and a\nlittle mock-modest over the success of my first two speeches in the\nUnion.\n\nOn the whole I like the rather boyish, tremendously serious young man of\nthose letters. An egotist, of course, but what youth was ever anything\nelse? I may write that much freely now, for by this time he is almost as\nmuch outside my personality as you or my father. He is the young\nStratton, one of a line. I like his gravity; if youth is not grave with\nall the great spectacle of life opening at its feet, then surely no age\nneed be grave. I love and envy his simplicity and honesty. His sham\nmodesty and so forth are so translucent as scarcely to matter. It is\nclear I was opening my heart to myself as I opened it to Mary. I wasn't\nacting to her. I meant what I said. And as I remember her answers she\ntook much the same high tone with me, though her style of writing was\nfar lighter than mine, more easy and witty and less continuous. She\nflashed and flickered. As for confessed love-making there is very\nlittle,--I find at the end of one of my notes after the signature, \"I\nlove you, I love you.\" And she was even more restrained. Such little\nphrases as \"Dear Stevenage\"--that was one of her odd names for me--\"I\nwish you were here,\" or \"Dear, _dear_ Stevenage,\" were epistolary\nevents, and I would re-read the blessed wonderful outbreak a hundred\ntimes....\n\nOur separation lengthened. There was a queer detached unexpected\nmeeting in London in December, for some afternoon gathering. I was shy\nand the more disconcerted because she was in winter town clothes that\nmade her seem strange and changed. Then came the devastating intimation\nthat all through the next summer the Ladislaws were to be in Scotland.\n\nI did my boyish utmost to get to Scotland. They were at Lankart near\nInvermoriston, and the nearest thing I could contrive was to join a\nreading party in Skye, a reading party of older men who manifestly had\nno great desire for me. For more than a year we never met at all, and\nall sorts of new things happened to us both. I perceived they happened\nto me, but I did not think they happened to her. Of course we changed.\nOf course in a measure and relatively we forgot. Of course there were\nweeks when we never thought of each other at all. Then would come phases\nof hunger. I remember a little note of hers. \"Oh Stevenage,\" it was\nscrawled, \"perhaps next Easter!\" Next Easter was an aching desolation.\nThe blinds of Burnmore House remained drawn; the place was empty except\nfor three old servants on board-wages. The Christians went instead to\nthe Canary Isles, following some occult impulse of Lady Ladislaw's. Lord\nLadislaw spent the winter in Italy.\n\nWhat an empty useless beauty the great Park possessed during those\nseasons of intermission! There were a score of places in it we had made\nour own....\n\nHer letters to Oxford would cease for weeks, and suddenly revive and\nbecome frequent. Now and then would come a love-letter that seemed to\nshine like stars as I read it; for the most part they were low-pitched,\nfriendly or humorous letters in a roundish girlish writing that was\nmaturing into a squarely characteristic hand. My letters to her too I\nsuppose varied as greatly. We began to be used to living so apart. There\nwere weeks of silence....\n\nYet always when I thought of my life as a whole, Mary ruled it. With her\nalone I had talked of my possible work and purpose; to her alone had I\nconfessed to ambitions beyond such modest worthiness as a public school\ndrills us to affect....\n\nThen the whole sky of my life lit up again with a strange light of\nexcitement and hope. I had a note, glad and serenely friendly, to say\nthey were to spend all the summer at Burnmore.\n\nI remember how I handled and scrutinized that letter, seeking for some\nintimation that our former intimacy was still alive. We were to meet.\nHow should we meet? How would she look at me? What would she think of\nme?\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 9\n\nOf course it was all different. Our first encounter in this new phase\nhad a quality of extreme disillusionment. The warm living creature, who\nwould whisper, who would kiss with wonderful lips, who would say strange\ndaring things, who had soft hair one might touch with a thrilling and\nworshipful hand, who changed one at a word or a look into a God of\npride, became as if she had been no more than a dream. A self-possessed\nyoung aristocrat in white and brown glanced at me from amidst a group of\nbrilliant people on the terrace, nodded as it seemed quite carelessly\nin acknowledgment of my salutation, and resumed her confident\nconversation with a tall stooping man, no less a person than Evesham,\nthe Prime Minister. He was lunching at Burnmore on his way across\ncountry to the Rileys. I heard that dear laugh of hers, as ready and\neasy as when she laughed with me. I had not heard it for nearly three\nyears--nor any sound that had its sweetness. \"But Mr. Evesham,\" she was\nsaying, \"nowadays we don't believe that sort of thing----\"\n\n\"There are a lot of things still for you to believe,\" says Mr. Evesham\nbeaming. \"A lot of things! One's capacity increases. It grows with\nexercise. Justin will bear me out.\"\n\nBeyond her stood an undersized, brown-clad middle-aged man with a big\nhead, a dark face and expressive brown eyes fixed now in unrestrained\nadmiration on Mary's laughing face. This then was Justin, the incredibly\nrich and powerful, whose comprehensive operations could make and break a\nthousand fortunes in a day. He answered Evesham carelessly, with his\ngaze still on Mary, and in a voice too low for my straining ears. There\nwas some woman in the group also, but she has left nothing upon my mind\nwhatever except an effect of black and a very decorative green sunshade.\nShe greeted Justin's remark, I remember, with the little yelp of\nlaughter that characterized that set. I think too there was someone else\nin the group; but I cannot clearly recall who....\n\nPresently as I and Philip made unreal conversation together I saw Mary\ndisengage herself and come towards us. It was as if a princess came\ntowards a beggar. Absurd are the changes of phase between women and\nmen. A year or so ago and all of us had been but \"the children\"\ntogether; now here were I and Philip mere youths still, nobodies, echoes\nand aspirations, crude promises at the best, and here was Mary in full\nflower, as glorious and central as the Hampton Court azaleas in spring.\n\n\"And this is Stephen,\" she said, aglow with happy confidence.\n\nI made no memorable reply, and there was a little pause thick with mute\nquestionings.\n\n\"After lunch,\" she said with her eye on mine, \"I am going to measure\nagainst you on the steps. I'd hoped--when you weren't looking--I might\ncreep up----\"\n\n\"I've taken no advantage,\" I said.\n\n\"You've kept your lead.\"\n\nJustin had followed her towards us, and now held out a hand to Philip.\n\"Well, Philip my boy,\" he said, and defined our places. Philip made some\nintroductory gesture with a word or so towards me. Justin glanced at me\nas one might glance at someone's new dog, gave an expressionless nod to\nmy stiff movement of recognition, and addressed himself at once to Mary.\n\n\"Lady Mary,\" he said, \"I've wanted to tell you----\"\n\nI caught her quick eye for a moment and knew she had more to say to me,\nbut neither she nor I had the skill and alacrity to get that said.\n\n\"I wanted to tell you,\" said Justin, \"I've found a little Japanese who's\ndone exactly what you wanted with that group of dwarf maples.\"\n\nShe clearly didn't understand.\n\n\"But what did I want, Mr. Justin?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't say that you forget?\" cried Justin. \"Oh don't tell me you\nforget! You wanted a little exact copy of a Japanese house---- I've had\nit done. Beneath the trees....\"\n\n\"And so you're back in Burnmore, Mr. Stratton,\" said Lady Ladislaw\nintervening between me and their duologue. And I never knew how pleased\nMary was with this faithful realization of her passing and forgotten\nfancy. My hostess greeted me warmly and pressed my hand, smiled\nmechanically and looked over my shoulder all the while to Mr. Evesham\nand her company generally, and then came the deep uproar of a gong from\nthe house and we were all moving in groups and couples luncheonward.\n\nJustin walked with Lady Mary, and she was I saw an inch taller than his\nsquat solidity. A tall lady in rose-pink had taken possession of Guy,\nEvesham and Lady Ladislaw made the two centres of a straggling group who\nwere bandying recondite political allusions. Then came one or two\ncouples and trios with nothing very much to say and active ears. Philip\nand I brought up the rear silently and in all humility. Even young Guy\nhad gone over our heads. I was too full of a stupendous realization for\nany words. Of course, during those years, she had been doing--no end of\nthings! And while I had been just drudging with lectures and books and\ntheorizing about the Empire and what I could do with it, and taking\nexercise, she had learnt, it seemed--the World.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 10\n\nLunch was in the great dining-room. There was a big table and two\nsmaller ones; we sat down anyhow, but the first comers had grouped\nthemselves about Lady Ladislaw and Evesham and Justin and Mary in a\ncentral orb, and I had to drift perforce to one of the satellites. I\nsecured a seat whence I could get a glimpse ever and again over Justin's\nassiduous shoulders of a delicate profile, and I found myself\nimmediately engaged in answering the innumerable impossible questions of\nLady Viping, the widow of terrible old Sir Joshua, that devastating\ndivorce court judge who didn't believe in divorces. His domestic\nconfidences had I think corrupted her mind altogether. She cared for\nnothing but evidence. She was a rustling, incessant, sandy, peering\nwoman with a lorgnette and rapid, confidential lisping undertones, and\nshe wanted to know who everybody was and how they were related. This\nkept us turning towards the other tables--and when my information failed\nshe would call upon Sir Godfrey Klavier, who was explaining, rather\ntestily on account of her interruptions, to Philip Christian and a\nlittle lady in black and the elder Fawney girl just why he didn't\nbelieve Lady Ladislaw's new golf course would succeed. There were two or\nthree other casual people at our table; one of the Roden girls, a young\nguardsman and, I think, some other man whom I don't clearly remember.\n\n\"And so that's the great Mr. Justin,\" rustled Lady Viping and stared\nacross me.\n\n(I saw Evesham, leaning rather over the table to point some remark at\nMary, and noted her lips part to reply.)\n\n\"What _is_ the word?\" insisted Lady Viping like a fly in my ear.\n\nI turned on her guiltily.\n\n\"Whether it's brachy,\" said Lady Viping, \"or whether it's dolly--_I_ can\nnever remember?\"\n\nI guessed she was talking of Justin's head. \"Oh!--brachycephalic,\" I\nsaid.\n\nI had lost Mary's answer.\n\n\"They say he's a woman hater,\" said Lady Viping. \"It hardly looks like\nit now, does it?\"\n\n\"Who?\" I asked. \"What?--oh!--Justin.\"\n\n\"The great financial cannibal. Suppose she turned him into a\nphilanthropist! Stranger things have happened. Look!--now. The man's\nface is positively tender.\"\n\nI hated looking, and I could not help but look. It was as if this\ndetestable old woman was dragging me down and down, down far below all\ndignity to her own level of a peeping observer. Justin was saying\nsomething to Mary in an undertone, something that made her glance up\nswiftly and at me before she answered, and there I was with my head side\nby side with those quivering dyed curls, that flighty black bonnet, that\nremorseless observant lorgnette. I could have sworn aloud at the\nhopeless indignity of my pose.\n\nI saw Mary color quickly before I looked away.\n\n\"Charming, isn't she?\" said Lady Viping, and I discovered those infernal\nglasses were for a moment honoring me. They shut with a click. \"Ham,\"\nsaid Lady Viping. \"I told him no ham--and now I remember--I like ham. Or\nrather I like spinach. I forgot the spinach. One has the ham for the\nspinach,--don't you think? Yes,--tell him. She's a perfect Dresden\nornament, Mr. Stratton. She's adorable ... (lorgnette and search for\nfresh topics). Who is the dark lady with the slight moustache--sitting\nthere next to Guy? Sir Godfrey, who is the dark lady? No, I don't mean\nMary Fitton. Over there! Mrs. Roperstone. Ooh. _The_ Mrs. Roperstone.\n(Renewed lorgnette and click.) Yes--ham. With spinach. A lot of spinach.\nThere's Mr. Evesham laughing again. He's greatly amused. Unusual for him\nto laugh twice. At least, aloud. (Rustle and adjustment of lorgnette.)\nMr. Stratton, don't you think?--exactly like a little shepherdess. Only\nI can't say I think Mr. Justin is like a shepherd. On the whole, more\nlike a large cloisonn\u00c3\u00a9 jar. Now Guy would do. As a pair they're\nbeautiful. Pity they're brother and sister. Curious how that boy manages\nto be big and yet delicate. H'm. Mixed mantel ornaments. Sir Godfrey,\nhow old _is_ Mrs. Roperstone?... You never know on principle. I think I\nshall make Mr. Stratton guess. What do you think, Mr. Stratton?... You\nnever guess on principle! Well, we're all very high principled. (Fresh\nexploratory movements of the lorgnette.) Mr. Stratton, tell me; is that\nlittle peaked man near Lady Ladislaw Mr. Roperstone? I thought as much!\"\n\nAll this chatter is mixed up in my mind with an unusual sense of\nhovering attentive menservants, who seemed all of them to my heated\nimagination to be watching me (and particularly one clean-shaven,\nreddish-haired, full-faced young man) lest I looked too much at the Lady\nMary Christian. Of course they were merely watching our plates and\nglasses, but my nerves and temper were now in such a state that if my\nman went off to the buffet to get Sir Godfrey the pickled walnuts, I\nfancied he went to report the progress of my infatuation, and if a\nstrange face appeared with the cider cup, that this was a new observer\ncome to mark the revelation of my behavior. My food embarrassed me. I\nfound hidden meanings in the talk of the Roden girl and her guardsman,\nand an ironical discovery in Sir Godfrey's eye....\n\nI felt indignant with Mary. I felt she disowned me and deserted me and\nrepudiated me, that she ought in some manner to have recognized me. I\ngave her no credit for her speech to me before the lunch, or her promise\nto measure against me again. I blinded myself to all her frank\nfriendliness. I felt she ought not to notice Justin, ought not to answer\nhim....\n\nClearly she liked those men to flatter her, she liked it....\n\nI remember too, so that I must have noted it and felt it then as a thing\nperceived for the first time, the large dignity of the room, the tall\nwindows and splendid rich curtains, the darkened Hoppners upon the\nwalls. I noted too the quality and abundance of the table things, and\nthere were grapes and peaches, strawberries, cherries and green almonds,\npiled lavishly above the waiting dessert plates with the golden knives\nand forks, upon a table in the sunshine of the great bay. The very\nsunshine filtered through the tall narrow panes from the great chestnut\ntrees without, seemed of a different quality from the common light of\nday....\n\nI felt like a poor relation. I sympathized with Anarchists. We had come\nout of the Park now finally, both Mary and I--into this....\n\n\"Mr. Stratton I am sure agrees with me.\"\n\nFor a time I had been marooned conversationally, and Lady Viping had\nengaged Sir Godfrey. Evidently he was refractory and she was back at me.\n\n\"Look at it now in profile,\" she said, and directed me once more to that\nunendurable grouping. Justin again!\n\n\"It's a heavy face,\" I said.\n\n\"It's a powerful face. I wouldn't care anyhow to be up against it--as\npeople say.\" And the lorgnette shut with a click. \"What is this?\nPeaches!--Yes, and give me some cream.\" ...\n\nI hovered long for that measuring I had been promised on the steps, but\neither Mary had forgotten or she deemed it wiser to forget.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 11\n\nI took my leave of Lady Ladislaw when the departure of Evesham broke the\nparty into dispersing fragments. I started down the drive towards the\nrectory and then vaulted the railings by the paddock and struck across\nbeyond the mere. I could not go home with the immense burthen of thought\nand new ideas and emotions that had come upon me. I felt confused and\nshattered to incoherence by the new quality of Mary's atmosphere. I\nturned my steps towards the wilder, lonelier part of the park beyond the\nKilling Wood, and lay down in a wide space of grass between two\ndivergent thickets of bracken, and remained there for a very long time.\n\nThere it was in the park that for the first time I pitted myself against\nlife upon a definite issue, and prepared my first experience of defeat.\n\"I _will_ have her,\" I said, hammering at the turf with my fist. \"I\nwill. I do not care if I give all my life....\"\n\nThen I lay still and bit the sweetness out of joints of grass, and\npresently thought and planned.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FOURTH\n\nTHE MARRIAGE OF THE LADY MARY CHRISTIAN\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 1\n\nFor three or four days I could get no word with Mary. I could not now\ncome and go as I had been able to do in the days when we were still \"the\nchildren.\" I could not work, I could not rest, I prowled as near as I\ncould to Burnmore House hoping for some glimpse of her, waiting for the\nmoment when I could decently present myself again at the house.\n\nWhen at last I called, Justin had gone and things had some flavor of the\nancient time. Lady Ladislaw received me with an airy intimacy, all the\ncareful responsibility of her luncheon party manner thrown aside. \"And\nhow goes Cambridge?\" she sang, sailing through the great saloon towards\nme, and I thought that for the occasion Cambridge instead of Oxford\nwould serve sufficiently well. \"You'll find them all at tennis,\" said\nLady Ladislaw, and waved me on to the gardens. There I found all four of\nthem and had to wait until their set was finished.\n\n\"Mary,\" I said at the first chance, \"are we never to talk again?\"\n\n\"It's all different,\" she said.\n\n\"I am dying to talk to you--as we used to talk.\"\n\n\"And I--Stevenage. But---- You see?\"\n\n\"Next time I come,\" I said, \"I shall bring you a letter. There is so\nmuch----\"\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"Can't you get up in the morning? Very early--five or\nsix. No one is up until ever so late.\"\n\n\"I'd stay up all night.\"\n\n\"Serve!\" said Maxton, who was playing the two of us and had stopped I\nthink to tighten a shoe.\n\nThings conspired against any more intimacy for a time. But we got our\nmoment on the way to tea. She glanced back at Philip, who was loosening\nthe net, and then forward to estimate the distance of Maxton and Guy.\n\"They're all three going,\" she said, \"after Tuesday. Then--before six.\"\n\n\"Wednesday?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Suppose after all,\" she threw out, \"I can't come.\"\n\n\"Fortunes of war.\"\n\n\"If I can't come one morning I may come another,\" she spoke hastily, and\nI perceived that Guy and Maxton had turned and were waiting for us.\n\n\"You know the old Ice House?\"\n\n\"Towards the gardens?\"\n\n\"Yes. On the further side. Don't come by the road, come across by the\nend of the mere. Lie in the bracken until you see me coming.... I've not\nplayed tennis a dozen times this year. Not half a dozen.\"\n\nThis last was for the boys.\n\n\"You've played twenty times at least since you've been here,\" said Guy,\nwith the simple bluntness of a brother. \"I'm certain.\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 2\n\nTo this day a dewy morning in late August brings back the thought of\nMary and those stolen meetings. I have the minutest recollection of the\nmisty bloom upon the turf, and the ragged, filmy carpet of gossamer on\neither hand, of the warm wetness of every little blade and blossom and\nof the little scraps and seeds of grass upon my soaking and discolored\nboots. Our footsteps were dark green upon the dew-grey grass. And I feel\nthe same hungry freshness again at the thought of those stolen meetings.\nPresently came the sunrise, blinding, warming, dew-dispelling arrows of\ngold smiting through the tree stems, a flood of light foaming over the\nbracken and gilding the under sides of the branches. Everything is\ndifferent and distinctive in those opening hours; everything has a\ndifferent value from what it has by day. All the little things upon the\nground, fallen branches, tussocks, wood-piles, have a peculiar intensity\nand importance, seem magnified, because of the length of their shadows\nin the slanting rays, and all the great trees seem lifted above the\nlight and merged with the sky. And at last, a cool grey outline against\nthe blaze and with a glancing iridescent halo about her, comes Mary,\nflitting, adventurous, friendly, wonderful.\n\n\"Oh Stevenage!\" she cries, \"to see you again!\"\n\nWe each hold out both our hands and clasp and hesitate and rather shyly\nkiss.\n\n\"Come!\" she says, \"we can talk for an hour. It's still not six. And\nthere is a fallen branch where we can sit and put our feet out of the\nwet. Oh! it's so good to be out of things again--clean out of\nthings--with you. Look! there is a stag watching us.\"\n\n\"You're glad to be with me?\" I ask, jealous of the very sunrise.\n\n\"I am always glad,\" she says, \"to be with you. Why don't we always get\nup at dawn, Stevenage, every day of our lives?\"\n\nWe go rustling through the grass to the prostrate timber she has chosen.\n(I can remember even the thin bracelet on the wrist of the hand that\nlifted her skirt.) I help her to clamber into a comfortable fork from\nwhich her feet can swing....\n\nSuch fragments as this are as bright, as undimmed, as if we had met this\nmorning. But then comes our conversation, and that I find vague and\nirregularly obliterated. But I think I must have urged her to say she\nloved me, and beat about the bush of that declaration, too fearful to\nput my heart's wish to the issue, that she would promise to wait three\nyears for me--until I could prove it was not madness for her to marry\nme. \"I have been thinking of it all night and every night since I have\nbeen here,\" I said. \"Somehow I will do something. In some way--I will\nget hold of things. Believe me!--with all my strength.\"\n\nI was standing between the forking boughs, and she was looking down upon\nme.\n\n\"Stephen dear,\" she said, \"dear, dear Boy; I have never wanted to kiss\nyou so much in all my life. Dear, come close to me.\"\n\nShe bent her fresh young face down to mine, her fingers were in my hair.\n\n\"My Knight,\" she whispered close to me. \"My beautiful young Knight.\"\n\nI whispered back and touched her dew fresh lips....\n\n\"And tell me what you would do to conquer the world for me?\" she asked.\n\nI cannot remember now a word of all the vague threatenings against the\nsundering universe with which I replied. Her hand was on my shoulder as\nshe listened....\n\nBut I do know that even on this first morning she left me with a sense\nof beautiful unreality, of having dipped for some precious moments into\nheroic gossamer. All my world subjugation seemed already as evanescent\nas the morning haze and the vanishing dews as I stood, a little hidden\nin the shadows of the Killing Wood and ready to plunge back at the first\nhint of an observer, and watched her slender whiteness flit\ncircumspectly towards the house.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 3\n\nOur next three or four meetings are not so clearly defined. We did not\nmeet every morning for fear that her early rising should seem too\npunctual to be no more than a chance impulse, nor did we go to the same\nplace. But there stands out very clearly a conversation in a different\nmood. We had met at the sham ruins at the far end of the great\nshrubbery, a huge shattered Corinthian portico of rather damaged stucco\ngiving wide views of the hills towards Alfridsham between its three\nerect pillars, and affording a dry seat upon its fallen ones. It was an\novercast morning, I remember probably the hour was earlier; a kind of\ntwilight clearness made the world seem strange and the bushes and trees\nbetween us and the house very heavy and still and dark. And we were at\ncross purpose, for now it was becoming clear to me that Mary did not\nmean to marry me, that she dreaded making any promise to me for the\nfuture, that all the heroic common cause I wanted with her, was quite\nalien to her dreams.\n\n\"But Mary,\" I said looking at her colorless delicate face, \"don't you\nlove me? Don't you want me?\"\n\n\"You know I love you, Stevenage,\" she said. \"You know.\"\n\n\"But if two people love one another, they want to be always together,\nthey want to belong to each other.\"\n\nShe looked at me with her face very intent upon her meaning.\n\"Stevenage,\" she said after one of those steadfast pauses of hers, \"I\nwant to belong to myself.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" I said with an air of disposing of an argument, and then\npaused.\n\n\"Why should one have to tie oneself always to one other human being?\"\nshe asked. \"Why must it be like that?\"\n\nI do not remember how I tried to meet this extraordinary idea. \"One\nloves,\" I may have said. The subtle scepticisms of her mind went\naltogether beyond my habits of thinking; it had never occurred to me\nthat there was any other way of living except in these voluntary and\ninvoluntary mutual servitudes in which men and women live and die. \"If\nyou love me,\" I urged, \"if you love me---- I want nothing better in all\nmy life but to love and serve and keep you and make you happy.\"\n\nShe surveyed me and weighed my words against her own.\n\n\"I love meeting you,\" she said. \"I love your going because it means\nthat afterwards you will come again. I love this--this slipping out to\nyou. But up there, there is a room in the house that is _my_\nplace--me--my own. Nobody follows me there. I want to go on living,\nStevenage, just as I am living now. I don't want to become someone's\ncertain possession, to be just usual and familiar to anyone. No, not\neven to you.\"\n\n\"But if you love,\" I cried.\n\n\"To you least of all. Don't you see?--I want to be wonderful to you,\nStevenage, more than to anyone. I want--I want always to make your heart\nbeat faster. I want always to be coming to you with my own heart beating\nfaster. Always and always I want it to be like that. Just as it has been\non these mornings. It has been beautiful--altogether beautiful.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, rather helplessly, and struggled with great issues I had\nnever faced before.\n\n\"It isn't,\" I said, \"how people live.\"\n\n\"It is how I want to live,\" said Mary.\n\n\"It isn't the way life goes.\"\n\n\"I want it to be. Why shouldn't it be? Why at any rate shouldn't it be\nfor me?\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 4\n\nI made some desperate schemes to grow suddenly rich and powerful, and I\nlearnt for the first time my true economic value. Already my father and\nI had been discussing my prospects in life and he had been finding me\nvague and difficult. I was full of large political intentions, but so\nfar I had made no definite plans for a living that would render my\npolitical ambitions possible. It was becoming apparent to me that for a\npoor man in England, the only possible route to political distinction is\nthe bar, and I was doing my best to reconcile myself to the years of\nwaiting and practice that would have to precede my political d\u00c3\u00a9but.\n\nMy father disliked the law. And I do not think it reconciled him to the\nidea of my being a barrister that afterwards I hoped to become a\npolitician. \"It isn't in our temperament, Stephen,\" he said. \"It's a\npushing, bullying, cramming, base life. I don't see you succeeding\nthere, and I don't see myself rejoicing even if you do succeed. You have\nto shout, and Strattons don't shout; you have to be smart and tricky and\nthere's never been a smart and tricky Stratton yet; you have to snatch\nopportunities and get the better of the people and misrepresent the\nrealities of every case you touch. You're a paid misrepresenter. They\nsay you'll get a fellowship, Stephen. Why not stay up, and do some\nthinking for a year or so. There'll be enough to keep you. Write a\nlittle.\"\n\n\"The bar,\" I said, \"is only a means to an end.\"\n\n\"If you succeed.\"\n\n\"If I succeed. One has to take the chances of life everywhere.\"\n\n\"And what is the end?\"\n\n\"Constructive statesmanship.\"\n\n\"Not in that way,\" said my father, pouring himself a second glass of\nport, and turned over my high-sounding phrase with a faint hint of\ndistaste; \"Constructive Statesmanship. No. Once a barrister always a\nbarrister. You'll only be a party politician.... Vulgar men....\nVulgar.... If you succeed that is....\"\n\nHe criticized me but he did not oppose me, and already in the beginning\nof the summer we had settled that I should be called to the bar.\n\nNow suddenly I wanted to go back upon all these determinations. I began\nto demand in the intellectual slang of the time \"more actuality,\" and to\namaze my father with talk about empire makers and the greatness of Lord\nStrathcona and Cecil Rhodes. Why, I asked, shouldn't I travel for a year\nin search of opportunity? At Oxford I had made acquaintance with a son\nof Pramley's, the big Mexican and Borneo man, and to him I wrote,\napropos of a half-forgotten midnight talk in the rooms of some common\nfriend. He wrote back with the suggestion that I should go and talk to\nhis father, and I tore myself away from Mary and went up to see that\ngreat exploiter of undeveloped possibilities and have one of the most\nilluminating and humiliating conversations in the world. He was, I\nremember, a little pale-complexioned, slow-speaking man with a humorous\nblue eye, a faint, just perceptible northern accent and a trick of\nkeeping silent for a moment after you had finished speaking, and he\ntalked to me as one might talk to a child of eight who wanted to know\nhow one could become a commander-in-chief. His son had evidently\nemphasized my Union reputation, and he would have been quite willing, I\nperceived, to give me employment if I had displayed the slightest\nintelligence or ability in any utilizable direction. But quite\ndreadfully he sounded my equipment with me and showed me the emptiness\nof my stores.\n\n\"You want some way that gives you a chance of growing rich rapidly,\" he\nsaid. \"Aye. It's not a bad idea. But there's others, you know, have\ntried that game before ye.\n\n\"You don't want riches just for riches but for an end. Aye! Aye! It's\nthe spending attracts ye. You'd not have me think you'd the sin of\navarice. I'm clear on that about ye.\n\n\"Well,\" he explained, \"it's all one of three things we do, you\nknow--prospecting and forestalling and--just stealing, and the only\nrespectable way is prospecting. You'd prefer the respectable way, I\nsuppose?... I knew ye would. Well, let's see what chances ye have.\"\n\nAnd he began to probe my practical knowledge. It was like an unfit man\nstripping for a medical inspection. Did I know anything of oil, of\nrubber, of sugar, of substances generally, had I studied mineralogy or\ngeology, had I any ideas of industrial processes, of technical\nchemistry, of rare minerals, of labor problems and the handling of alien\nlabor, of the economics of railway management or of camping out in dry,\nthinly populated countries, or again could I maybe speak Spanish or\nItalian or Russian? The little dons who career about Oxford afoot and\nawheel, wearing old gowns and mortarboards, giggling over Spooner's\nlatest, and being tremendous \"characters\" in the intervals of concocting\nthe ruling-class mind, had turned my mind away from such matters\naltogether. I had left that sort of thing to Germans and east-end Jews\nand young men from the upper-grade board schools of Sheffield and\nBirmingham. I was made to realize appalling wildernesses of\nignorance....\n\n\"You see,\" said old Pramley, \"you don't seem to know anything whatever.\nIt's a deeficulty. It'll stand in your way a little now, though no\ndoubt you'd be quick at the uptake--after all the education they've\ngiven ye.... But it stands in your way, if ye think of setting out to do\nsomething large and effective, just immediately....\"\n\nMoreover it came out, I forget now how, that I hadn't clearly grasped\nthe difference between cumulative and non-cumulative preference\nshares....\n\nI remember too how I dined alone that evening in a mood between frantic\nexasperation and utter abasement in the window of the Mediated\nUniversities Club, of which I was a junior member under the\nundergraduate rule. And I lay awake all night in one of the austere club\nbedrooms, saying to old Pramley a number of extremely able and\npenetrating things that had unhappily not occurred to me during the\nprogress of our interview. I didn't go back to Burnmore for several\ndays. I had set my heart on achieving something, on returning with some\nearnest of the great attack I was to make upon the separating great\nworld between myself and Mary. I am far enough off now from that angry\nand passionate youngster to smile at the thought that my subjugation of\nthings in general and high finance in particular took at last the form\nof proposing to go into the office of Bean, Medhurst, Stockton, and\nSchnadhorst upon half commission terms. I was awaiting my father's reply\nto this startling new suggestion when I got a telegram from Mary. \"We\nare going to Scotland unexpectedly. Come down and see me.\" I went home\ninstantly, and told my father I had come to talk things over with him. A\nnote from Mary lay upon the hall-table as I came in and encountered my\nfather. \"I thought it better to come down to you,\" I said with my\nglance roving to find that, and then I met his eye. It wasn't altogether\nan unkindly eye, but I winced dishonestly.\n\n\"Talking is better for all sorts of things,\" said my father, and wanted\nto know if the weather had been as hot in London as it had been in\nBurnmore.\n\nMary's note was in pencil, scribbled hastily. I was to wait after eleven\nthat night near the great rose bushes behind the pavilion. Long before\neleven I was there, on a seat in a thick shadow looking across great\nlakes of moonlight towards the phantom statuary of the Italianate garden\nand the dark laurels that partly masked the house. I waited nearly an\nhour, an hour of stillness and small creepings and cheepings and goings\nto and fro among the branches.\n\nIn the bushes near by me a little green glow-worm shared my vigil.\n\nAnd then, wrapped about in a dark velvet cloak, still in her white\ndinner dress, with shining, gleaming, glancing stones about her dear\nthroat, warm and wonderful and glowing and daring, Mary came flitting\nout of the shadows to me.\n\n\"My dear,\" she whispered, panting and withdrawing a little from our\nfirst passionate embrace, \"Oh my dear!... How did I come? Twice before,\nwhen I was a girl, I got out this way. By the corner of the conservatory\nand down the laundry wall. You can't see from here, but it's easy--easy.\nThere's a tree that helps. And now I have come that way to you.\n_You!..._\n\n\"Oh! love me, my Stephen, love me, dear. Love me as if we were never to\nlove again. Am I beautiful, my dear? Am I beautiful in the moonlight?\nTell me!...\n\n\"Perhaps this is the night of our lives, dear! Perhaps never again will\nyou and I be happy!...\n\n\"But the wonder, dear, the beauty! Isn't it still? It's as if nothing\nreally stood solid and dry. As if everything floated....\n\n\"Everyone in all the world has gone to sleep to-night and left the world\nto us. Come! Come this way and peep at the house, there. Stoop--under\nthe branches. See, not a light is left! And all its blinds are drawn and\nits eyes shut. One window is open, _my_ little window, Stephen! but that\nis in the shadow where that creeper makes everything black.\n\n\"Along here a little further is night-stock. Now--Now! Sniff, Stephen!\nSniff! The scent of it! It lies--like a bank of scented air.... And\nStephen, there! Look!... A star--a star without a sound, falling out of\nthe blue! It's gone!\"\n\nThere was her dear face close to mine, soft under the soft moonlight,\nand the breath of her sweet speech mingled with the scent of the\nnight-stock....\n\nThat was indeed the most beautiful night of my life, a night of\nmoonlight and cool fragrance and adventurous excitement. We were\ntransported out of this old world of dusty limitations; it was as if for\nthose hours the curse of man was lifted from our lives. No one\ndiscovered us, no evil thing came near us. For a long time we lay close\nin one another's arms upon a bank of thyme. Our heads were close\ntogether; her eyelashes swept my cheek, we spoke rarely and in soft\nwhispers, and our hearts were beating, beating. We were as solemn as\ngreat mountains and as innocent as sleeping children. Our kisses were\nkisses of moonlight. And it seemed to me that nothing that had ever\nhappened or could happen afterwards, mattered against that happiness....\n\nIt was nearly three when at last I came back into my father's garden. No\none had missed me from my room and the house was all asleep, but I could\nnot get in because I had closed a latch behind me, and so I stayed in\nthe little arbor until day, watching the day break upon long beaches of\npale cloud over the hills towards Alfridsham. I slept at last with my\nhead upon my arms upon the stone table, until the noise of shooting\nbolts and doors being unlocked roused me to watch my chance and slip\nback again into the house, and up the shuttered darkened staircase to my\ntranquil, undisturbed bedroom.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 5\n\nIt was in the vein of something evasive in Mary's character that she let\nme hear first of her engagement to Justin through the _Times_. Away\nthere in Scotland she got I suppose new perspectives, new ideas; the\nglow of our immediate passion faded. The thing must have been drawing in\nupon her for some time. Perhaps she had meant to tell me of it all that\nnight when she had summoned me to Burnmore. Looking back now I am the\nmore persuaded that she did. But the thing came to me in London with the\neffect of an immense treachery. Within a day or so of the newspaper's\nannouncement she had written me a long letter answering some argument of\nmine, and saying nothing whatever of the people about her. Even then\nJustin must have been asking her to marry him. Her mind must have been\nfull of that question. Then came a storm of disappointment, humiliation\nand anger with this realization. I can still feel myself writing and\ndestroying letters to her, letters of satire, of protest. Oddly enough I\ncannot recall the letter that at last I sent her, but it is eloquent of\nthe weak boyishness of my position that I sent it in our usual furtive\nmanner, accepted every precaution that confessed the impossibility of\nour relationship. \"No,\" she scribbled back, \"you do not understand. I\ncannot write. I must talk to you.\"\n\nWe had a secret meeting.\n\nWith Beatrice Normandy's connivance she managed to get away for the\nbetter part of the day, and we spent a long morning in argument in the\nBotanical Gardens--that obvious solitude--and afterwards we lunched upon\nham and ginger beer at a little open-air restaurant near the Broad Walk\nand talked on until nearly four. We were so young that I think we both\nfelt, beneath our very real and vivid emotions, a gratifying sense of\nromantic resourcefulness in this prolonged discussion. There is\nsomething ridiculously petty and imitative about youth, something too,\nna\u00c3\u00afvely noble and adventurous. I can never determine if older people are\nless generous and imaginative or merely less absurd. I still recall the\nautumnal melancholy of that queer, neglected-looking place, in which I\nhad never been before, and which I have never revisited--a memory of\nwalking along narrow garden paths beside queer leaf-choked artificial\nchannels of water under yellow-tinted trees, of rustic bridges going\nnowhere in particular, and of a kind of brickwork ruined castle, greatly\ndecayed and ivy-grown, in which we sat for a long time looking out upon\na lawn and a wide gravel path leading to a colossal frontage of\nconservatory.\n\nI must have been resentful and bitter in the beginning of that talk. I\ndo not remember that I had any command of the situation or did anything\nbut protest throughout that day. I was too full of the egotism of the\nyoung lover to mark Mary's moods and feelings. It was only afterwards\nthat I came to understand that she was not wilfully and deliberately\nfollowing the course that was to separate us, that she was taking it\nwith hesitations and regrets. Yet she spoke plainly enough, she spoke\nwith a manifest sincerity of feeling. And while I had neither the grasp\nnor the subtlety to get behind her mind I perceive now as I think things\nout that Lady Ladislaw had both watched and acted, had determined her\ndaughter's ideas, sown her mind with suggestions, imposed upon her a\nconception of her situation that now dominated all her thoughts.\n\n\"Dear Stephen,\" reiterated Mary, \"I love you. I do, clearly, definitely,\ndeliberately love you. Haven't I told you that? Haven't I made that\nplain to you?\"\n\n\"But you are going to marry Justin!\"\n\n\"Stephen dear, can I possibly marry you? Can I?\"\n\n\"Why not? Why not make the adventure of life with me? Dare!\"\n\nShe looked down on me. She was sitting upon a parapet of the brickwork\nand I was below her. She seemed to be weighing possibilities.\n\n\"Why not?\" I cried. \"Even now. Why not run away with me, throw our two\nlives together? Do as lovers have dared to do since the beginning of\nthings! Let us go somewhere together----\"\n\n\"But Stephen,\" she asked softly, \"_where_?\"\n\n\"Anywhere!\"\n\nShe spoke as an elder might do to a child. \"No! tell me where--exactly.\nWhere would it be? Where should we go? How should we live? Tell me. Make\nme see it, Stephen.\"\n\n\"You are too cruel to me, Mary,\" I said. \"How can I--on the spur of the\nmoment--arrange----?\"\n\n\"But dear, suppose it was somewhere very grimy and narrow!\nSomething--like some of those back streets I came through to get here.\nSuppose it was some dreadful place. And you had no money. And we were\nboth worried and miserable. One gets ill in such places. If I loved you,\nStephen--I mean if you and I--if you and I were to be together, I should\nwant it to be in sunshine, I should want it to be among beautiful\nforests and mountains. Somewhere very beautiful....\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because--to-day I know. There are no such places in the world for us.\nStephen, they are dreams.\"\n\n\"For three years now,\" I said, \"I have dreamed such dreams.\n\n\"Oh!\" I cried out, stung by my own words, \"but this is cowardice! Why\nshould we submit to this old world! Why should we give up--things you\nhave dreamed as well as I! You said once--to hear my voice--calling in\nthe morning.... Let us take each other, Mary, now. _Now!_ Let us take\neach other, and\"--I still remember my impotent phrase--\"afterwards count\nthe cost!\"\n\n\"If I were a queen,\" said Mary. \"But you see I am not a queen.\" ...\n\nSo we talked in fragments and snatches of argument, and all she said\nmade me see more clearly the large hopelessness of my desire. \"At\nleast,\" I urged, \"do not marry Justin now. Give me a chance. Give me\nthree years, Mary, three short years, to work, to do something!\"\n\nShe knew so clearly now the quality of her own intentions.\n\n\"Dear Stephen,\" she explained, \"if I were to come away with you and\nmarry you, in just a little time I should cease to be your lover, I\nshould be your squaw. I should have to share your worries and make your\ncoffee--and disappoint you, disappoint you and fail you in a hundred\nways. Think! Should I be any good as a squaw? How can one love when one\nknows the coffee isn't what it should be, and one is giving one's lover\nindigestion? And I don't _want_ to be your squaw. I don't want that at\nall. It isn't how I feel for you. I don't _want_ to be your servant and\nyour possession.\"\n\n\"But you will be Justin's--squaw, you are going to marry him!\"\n\n\"That is all different, Stevenage. Between him and me there will be\nspace, air, dignity, endless servants----\"\n\n\"But,\" I choked. \"You! He! He will make love to you, Mary.\"\n\n\"You don't understand, Stephen.\"\n\n\"He will make love to you, Mary. Mary! don't you understand? These\nthings---- We've never talked of them.... You will bear him children!\"\n\n\"No,\" she said.\n\n\"But----\"\n\n\"No. He promises. Stephen,--I am to own myself.\"\n\n\"But--He marries you!\"\n\n\"Yes. Because he--he admires me. He cannot live without me. He loves my\ncompany. He loves to be seen with me. He wants me with him to enjoy all\nthe things he has. Can't you understand, Stephen?\"\n\n\"But do you mean----?\"\n\nOur eyes met.\n\n\"Stephen,\" she said, \"I swear.\"\n\n\"But---- He hopes.\"\n\n\"I don't care. He has promised. I have his promise. I shall be free. Oh!\nI shall be free--free! He is a different man from you, Stephen. He isn't\nso fierce; he isn't so greedy.\"\n\n\"But it parts us!\"\n\n\"Only from impossible things.\"\n\n\"It parts us.\"\n\n\"It does not even part us, Stevenage. We shall see one another! we shall\ntalk to one another.\"\n\n\"I shall lose you.\"\n\n\"I shall keep you.\"\n\n\"But I--do you expect me to be content with _this_?\"\n\n\"I will make you content. Oh! Stephen dear, can't there be love--love\nwithout this clutching, this gripping, this carrying off?\"\n\n\"You will be carried altogether out of my world.\"\n\n\"If I thought that, Stephen, indeed I would not marry him.\"\n\nBut I insisted we should be parted, and parted in the end for ever, and\nthere I was the wiser of the two. I knew the insatiable urgency within\nmyself. I knew that if I continued to meet Mary I should continue to\ndesire her until I possessed her altogether.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 6\n\nI cannot reproduce with any greater exactness than this the quality and\ngist of our day-long conversation. Between us was a deep affection, and\ninstinctive attraction, and our mental temperaments and our fundamental\nideas were profoundly incompatible. We were both still very young in\nquality, we had scarcely begun to think ourselves out, we were greatly\nswayed by the suggestion of our circumstances, complex, incoherent and\nformless emotions confused our minds. But I see now that in us there\nstruggled vast creative forces, forces that through a long future, in\nforms as yet undreamt of, must needs mould the destiny of our race. Far\nmore than Mary I was accepting the conventions of our time. It seemed to\nme not merely reasonable but necessary that because she loved me she\nshould place her life in my youthful and inexpert keeping, share my\nstruggles and the real hardships they would have meant for her, devote\nherself to my happiness, bear me children, be my inspiration in\nimaginative moments, my squaw, helper and possession through the whole\ntwenty-four hours of every day, and incidentally somehow rear whatever\nfamily we happened to produce, and I was still amazed in the depths of\nmy being that she did not reciprocate this simple and comprehensive\nintention. I was ready enough I thought for equivalent sacrifices. I was\nprepared to give my whole life, subordinate all my ambitions, to the\neffort to maintain our home. If only I could have her, have her for my\nown, I was ready to pledge every hour I had still to live to that\nservice. It seemed mere perversity to me then that she should turn even\nsuch vows as that against me.\n\n\"But I don't want it, Stevenage,\" she said. \"I don't want it. I want you\nto go on to the service of the empire, I want to see you do great\nthings, do all the things we've talked about and written about. Don't\nyou see how much better that is for you and for me--and for the world\nand our lives? I don't want you to become a horrible little specialist\nin feeding and keeping me.\"\n\n\"Then--then _wait_ for me!\" I cried.\n\n\"But--I want to live myself! I don't want to wait. I want a great house,\nI want a great position, I want space and freedom. I want to have\nclothes--and be as splendid as your career is going to be. I want to be\na great and shining lady in your life. I can't always live as I do now,\ndependent on my mother, whirled about by her movements, living in her\nlight. Why should I be just a hard-up Vestal Virgin, Stephen, in your\nhonor? You will not be able to marry me for years and years and\nyears--unless you neglect your work, unless you throw away everything\nthat is worth having between us in order just to get me.\"\n\n\"But I want _you_, Mary,\" I cried, drumming at the little green table\nwith my fist. \"I want you. I want nothing else in all the world unless\nit has to do with you.\"\n\n\"You've got me--as much as anyone will ever have me. You'll always have\nme. Always I will write to you, talk to you, watch you. Why are you so\ngreedy, Stephen? Why are you so ignoble? If I were to come now and marry\nyou, it wouldn't help you. It would turn you into--a wife-keeper, into\nthe sort of uninteresting preoccupied man one sees running after and\ngloating over the woman he's bought--at the price of his money and his\ndignity--and everything.... It's not proper for a man to live so for a\nwoman and her children. It's dwarfish. It's enslaving. It's--it's\nindecent. Stephen! I'd hate you so.\" ...\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 7\n\nWe parted at last at a cab-rank near a bridge over the Canal at the\nwestern end of Park Village. I remember that I made a last appeal to her\nas we walked towards it, and that we loitered on the bridge, careless of\nwho might see us there, in a final conflict of our wills. \"Before it is\ntoo late, Mary, dear,\" I said.\n\nShe shook her head, her white lips pressed together.\n\n\"But after the things that have happened. That night--the moonlight!\"\n\n\"It's not fair,\" she said, \"for you to talk of that. It isn't fair.\"\n\n\"But Mary. This is parting. This indeed is parting.\"\n\nShe answered never a word.\n\n\"Then at least talk to me again for one time more.\"\n\n\"Afterwards,\" she said. \"Afterwards I will talk to you. Don't make\nthings too hard for me, Stephen.\"\n\n\"If I could I would make this impossible. It's--it's hateful.\"\n\nShe turned to the kerb, and for a second or so we stood there without\nspeaking. Then I beckoned to a hansom.\n\nShe told me Beatrice Normandy's address.\n\nI helped her into the cab. \"Good-bye,\" I said with a weak affectation\nof an everyday separation, and I turned to the cabman with her\ninstructions.\n\nThen again we looked at one another. The cabman waited. \"All right,\nsir?\" he asked.\n\n\"Go ahead!\" I said, and lifted my hat to the little white face within.\n\nI watched the cab until it vanished round the curve of the road. Then I\nturned about to a world that had become very large and empty and\nmeaningless.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 8\n\nI struggled feebly to arrest the course of events. I wrote Mary some\nviolent and bitter letters. I treated her as though she alone were\nresponsible for my life and hers; I said she had diverted my energies,\nbetrayed me, ruined my life. I hinted she was cold-blooded, mercenary,\nshameless. Someday you, with that quick temper of yours and your power\nof expression, will understand that impulse to write, to pour out a\npassionately unjust interpretation of some nearly intolerable situation,\nand it is not the least of all the things I owe to Mary that she\nunderstood my passion and forgave those letters and forgot them. I tried\ntwice to go and see her. But I do not think I need tell you, little son,\nof these self-inflicted humiliations and degradations. An angry man is\nnone the less a pitiful man because he is injurious. The hope that had\nheld together all the project of my life was gone, and all my thoughts\nand emotions lay scattered in confusion....\n\nYou see, my little son, there are two sorts of love; we use one name\nfor very different things. The love that a father bears his children,\nthat a mother feels, that comes sometimes, a strange brightness and\ntenderness that is half pain, at the revelation of some touching aspect\nof one long known to one, at the sight of a wife bent with fatigue and\nunsuspicious of one's presence, at the wretchedness and perplexity of\nsome wrong-doing brother, or at an old servant's unanticipated tears,\nthat is love--like the love God must bear us. That is the love we must\nspread from those of our marrow until it reaches out to all mankind,\nthat will some day reach out to all mankind. But the love of a young man\nfor a woman takes this quality only in rare moments of illumination and\ncomplete assurance. My love for Mary was a demand, it was a wanton claim\nI scored the more deeply against her for every moment of happiness she\ngave me. I see now that as I emerged from the first abjection of my\nadmiration and began to feel assured of her affection, I meant nothing\nby her but to possess her, I did not want her to be happy as I want you\nto be happy even at the price of my life; I wanted her. I wanted her as\nbarbarians want a hunted enemy, alive or dead. It was a flaming jealousy\nto have her mine. That granted, then I was prepared for all\ndevotions....\n\nThis is how men love women. Almost as exclusively and fiercely I think\ndo women love men. And the deepest question before humanity is just how\nfar this jealous greed may be subdued to a more generous passion. The\nfierce jealousy of men for women and women for men is the very heart of\nall our social jealousies, the underlying tension of this crowded modern\nlife that has grown out of the ampler, simpler, ancient life of men.\nThat is why we compete against one another so bitterly, refuse\nassociation and generous co-operations, keep the struggle for existence\nhard and bitter, hamper and subordinate the women as they in their turn\nwould if they could hamper and subordinate the men--because each must\nthoroughly have his own.\n\nAnd I knew my own heart too well to have any faith in Justin and his\nword. He was taking what he could, and his mind would never rest until\nsome day he had all. I had seen him only once, but the heavy and\nresolute profile above his bent back and slender shoulders stuck in my\nmemory.\n\nIf he was cruel to Mary, I told her, or broke his least promise to her,\nI should kill him.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 9\n\nMy distress grew rather than diminished in the days immediately before\nher marriage, and that day itself stands out by itself in my memory, a\nday of wandering and passionate unrest. My imagination tormented me with\nthoughts of Justin as a perpetual privileged wooer.\n\nWell, well,--I will not tell you, I will not write the ugly mockeries my\nimagination conjured up. I was constantly on the verge of talking and\ncursing aloud to myself, or striking aimlessly at nothing with clenched\nfists. I was too stupid to leave London, too disturbed for work or any\ndistraction of my mind. I wandered about the streets of London all day.\nIn the morning I came near going to the church and making some\npreposterous interruptions. And I remember discovering three or four\ncarriages adorned with white favors and a little waiting crowd outside\nthat extinguisher-spired place at the top of Regent Street, and\nwondering for a moment or so at their common preoccupation, and then\nunderstanding. Of course, another marriage! Of all devilish\ninstitutions!\n\nWhat was I to do with my life now? What was to become of my life? I can\nstill recall the sense of blank unanswerableness with which these\nquestions dominated my mind, and associated with it is an effect of\nmyself as a small human being, singular and apart, wandering through a\nnumber of London landscapes. At one time I was in a great grey\nsmoke-rimmed autumnal space of park, much cut up by railings and worn by\ncricket pitches, far away from any idea of the Thames, and in the\ndistance over the tops of trees I discovered perplexingly the clustering\nmasts and spars of ships. I have never seen that place since. Then the\nAngel at Islington is absurdly mixed up with the distresses of this day.\nI attempted some great detour thence, and found myself with a dumb\nirritation returning to the place from another direction. I remember too\na wide street over which passes a thundering railway bridge borne upon\ncolossal rounded pillars of iron, and carrying in white and blue some\nbig advertisement, I think of the _Daily Telegraph_. Near there I\nthought a crowd was gathered about the victim of some accident, and\nthrusting myself among the people with a vague idea of help, discovered\na man selling a remedy for corns. And somewhere about this north region\nI discovered I was faint with hunger, and got some bread and cheese and\nbeer in a gaudily decorated saloon bar with a sanded floor. I resisted\na monstrous impulse to stay in that place and drink myself into\ninactivity and stupefaction with beer.\n\nThen for a long time I sat upon an iron seat near some flower beds in a\nkind of garden that had the headstones of graves arranged in a row\nagainst a yellow brick wall. The place was flooded with the amber\nsunshine of a September afternoon. I shared the seat with a nursemaid in\ncharge of a perambulator and several scuffling uneasy children, and I\nkept repeating to myself: \"By now it is all over. The thing is done.\"\n\nMy sense of the enormity of London increased with the twilight, and\nbegan to prevail a little against my intense personal wretchedness. I\nremember wastes of building enterprise, interminable vistas of wide dark\nstreets, with passing trams, and here and there at strategic corners\ncoruscating groups of shops. And somewhere I came along a narrow street\nsuddenly upon the distant prospect of a great monstrous absurd place on\na steep hill against the last brightness of the evening sky, a burlesque\nblock of building with huge truncated pyramids at either corner, that I\nhave since learnt was the Alexandra Palace. It was so queer and bulky\nthat it arrested and held my attention, struck on my memory with an\nalmost dreamlike quality, so that years afterwards I went to Muswell\nHill to see if indeed there really was such a place on earth, or whether\nI had had a waking nightmare during my wanderings....\n\nI wandered far that night, very far. Some girl accosted me, a thin-faced\nruined child younger by a year or so than myself. I remembered how I\ntalked to her, foolish rambling talk. \"If you loved a man, and he was\npoor, you'd wait,\" I said, \"you'd stick to him. You'd not leave him\njust to get married to a richer man.\"\n\nWe prowled talking for a time, and sat upon a seat somewhere near the\nRegent's Park canal. I rather think I planned to rescue her from a\nfallen life, but somehow we dropped that topic. I know she kissed me. I\nhave a queer impression that it came into my head to marry her. I put\nall my loose money in her hands at last and went away extraordinarily\ncomforted by her, I know not how, leaving her no doubt wondering\ngreatly.\n\nI did not go to bed that night at all, nor to the office next morning. I\nnever showed myself in the office again. Instead I went straight down to\nmy father, and told him I wanted to go to the war forthwith. I had an\nindistinct memory of a promise I had made Mary to stay in England, but I\nfelt it was altogether unendurable that I should ever meet her again. My\nfather sat at table over the remains of his lunch, and regarded me with\nastonishment, with the beginnings of protest.\n\n\"I want to get away,\" I said, and to my own amazement and shame I burst\ninto tears.\n\n\"My boy!\" he gasped, astonished and terrified. \"You've--you've not\ndone--some foolish thing?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, already wiping the tears from my face, \"nothing.... But I\nwant to go away.\"\n\n\"You shall do as you please,\" he said, and sat for a moment regarding\nhis only son with unfathomable eyes.\n\nThen he got up with a manner altogether matter-of-fact, came half-way\nround the table and mixed me a whisky and soda. \"It won't be much of a\nwar, I'm told,\" he said with the syphon in his hands, breaking a\nsilence. \"I sometimes wish--I had seen a bit of soldiering. And this\nseems to be an almost unavoidable war. Now, at any rate, it's\nunavoidable.... Drink this and have a biscuit.\"\n\nHe turned to the mantelshelf, and filled his pipe with his broad back to\nme. \"Yes,\" he said, \"you---- You'll be interested in the war. I hope----\nI hope you'll have a good time there....\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FIFTH\n\nTHE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 1\n\nMary and I did not meet again for five years, and for nearly all that\ntime I remained in South Africa. I went from England a boy; I came back\nseasoned into manhood. They had been years of crowded experience, rapid\nyet complicated growth, disillusionment and thought. Responsibility had\ncome to me. I had seen death, I had seen suffering, and held the lives\nof men in my hands.\n\nOf course one does not become a soldier on active service at once for\nthe wishing, and there was not at first that ready disposition on the\npart of the home military authorities which arose later, to send out\nyoung enthusiasts. I could ride and shoot fairly well, and accordingly I\ndecided to go on my own account to Durban--for it was manifest that\nthings would begin in Natal--and there attach myself to some of the\nlocal volunteer corps that would certainly be raised. This took me out\nof England at once, a thing that fell in very well with my mood. I\nwould, I was resolved, begin life afresh. I would force myself to think\nof nothing but the war. I would never if I could help it think of Mary\nagain.\n\nThe war had already begun when I reached Durban. The town was seething\nwith the news of a great British victory at Dundee. We came into the\nport through rain and rough weather and passed a big white liner loaded\nup feverishly from steam tenders with wealthy refugees going\nEngland-ward. From two troopships against the wharves there was a great\nbusiness of landing horses--the horses of the dragoons and hussars from\nIndia. I spent the best part of my first night in South Africa in the\nstreets looking in vain for a bedroom, and was helped at last by a\nkindly rickshaw Zulu to a shanty where I slept upon three chairs. I\nremember I felt singularly unwanted.\n\nThe next day I set about my volunteering. By midday I had opened\ncommunications with that extremely untried and problematical body, the\nImperial Light Horse, and in three days more I was in the company of a\nmixed batch of men, mostly Australian volunteers, on my way to a place I\nhad never heard of before called Ladysmith, through a country of\nincreasing picturesqueness and along a curious curving little line whose\ndown traffic seemed always waiting in sidings, and consisted of crowded\nlittle trains full of pitiful fugitives, white, brown, and black,\nstifled and starving. They were all clamoring to buy food and drink--and\nnone seemed forthcoming. We shunted once to allow a southbound train to\npass, a peculiar train that sent everyone on to the line to\nsee--prisoners of war! There they were, real live enemies, rather glum,\nlooking out at us with faces very like our own--but rather more\nunshaven. They had come from the battle of Elandslaagte....\n\nI had never been out of England before except for a little\nmountaineering in the French Alps and one walking excursion in the Black\nForest, and the scenery of lower Natal amazed me. I had expected\nnothing nearly so tropical, so rich and vivid. There were little\nMozambique monkeys chattering in the thick-set trees beside the line and\na quantity of unfamiliar birds and gaudy flowers amidst the abundant\ndeep greenery. There were aloe and cactus hedges, patches of unfamiliar\ncultivation upon the hills; bunchy, frondy growths that I learnt were\nbananas and plantains, and there were barbaric insanitary-looking Kaffir\nkraals which I supposed had vanished before our civilization. There\nseemed an enormous quantity of Kaffirs all along the line--and all of\nthem, men, women, and children, were staring at the train. The scenery\ngrew finer and bolder, and more bare and mountainous, until at last we\ncame out into the great basin in which lay this Ladysmith. It seemed a\npoor unimportant, dusty little street of huts as we approached it, but\nthe great crests beyond struck me as very beautiful in the morning\nlight....\n\nI forgot the beauty of those hills as we drew into the station. It was\nthe morning after the surrender of Nicholson's Nek. I had come to join\nan army already tremendously astonished and shattered. The sunny\nprospect of a triumphal procession to Pretoria which had been still in\nmen's minds at Durban had vanished altogether. In rather less than a\nfortnight of stubborn fighting we had displayed a strategy that was\nflighty rather than brilliant, and lost a whole battery of guns and\nnearly twelve hundred prisoners. We had had compensations, our common\nsoldiers were good stuff at any rate, but the fact was clear that we\nwere fighting an army not only very much bigger than ours but better\nequipped, with bigger guns, better information, and it seemed superior\nstrategy. We were being shoved back into this Ladysmith and encircled.\nThis confused, disconcerted, and thoroughly bad-tempered army, whose\nmules and bullocks cumbered the central street of the place, was all\nthat was left of the British Empire in Natal. Behind it was an\nunprotected country and the line to Pietermaritzburg, Durban, and the\nsea.\n\nYou cannot imagine how amazed I felt at it. I had been prepared for a\nsort of Kentucky quality in the enemy, illiteracy, pluck, guile and good\nshooting, but to find them with more modern arms than our own, more\nmodern methods! Weren't we there, after all, to teach _them_! Weren't we\nthe Twentieth and they the Eighteenth Century? The town had been shelled\nthe day before from those very hills I had admired; at any time it might\nbe shelled again. The nose of a big gun was pointed out to me by a\nblasphemous little private in the Devons. It was a tremendous, a\nprofoundly impressive, black snout. His opinions of the directing wisdom\nat home were unquotable. The platform was a wild confusion of women and\nchildren and colored people,--there was even an invalid lady on a\nstretcher. Every non-combatant who could be got out of Ladysmith was\nbeing hustled out that day. Everyone was smarting with the sense of\ndefeat in progress, everyone was disappointed and worried; one got short\nanswers to one's questions. For a time I couldn't even find out where I\nhad to go....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 2\n\nI fired my first shot at a fellow-creature within four days of my\narrival. We rode out down the road to the south to search some hills,\nand found the Boers in fair strength away to the east of us. We were\ndismounted and pushed up on foot through a wood to a grassy crest. There\nfor the first time I saw the enemy, little respectable-looking\nunsoldierlike figures, mostly in black, dodging about upon a ridge\nperhaps a mile away. I took a shot at one of these figures just before\nit vanished into a gully. One or two bullets came overhead, and I tried\nto remember what I had picked up about cover. They made a sound,\n_whiff-er-whiff_, a kind of tearing whistle, and there was nothing but a\ndistant crackling to give one a hint of their direction until they took\neffect. I remember the peculiar smell of the grass amidst which I\ncrouched, my sudden disgust to realize I was lying, and had to lie now\nfor an indefinite time, in the open sunlight and far from any shade, and\nhow I wondered whether after all I had wanted to come to this war.\n\nWe lay shooting intermittently until the afternoon, I couldn't\nunderstand why; we went forward a little, and at last retired upon\nLadysmith. On the way down to the horses, I came upon my first dead man.\nHe was lying in a crumpled heap not fifty yards from where I had been\nshooting. There he lay, the shattered mirror of a world. One side of his\nskull over the ear had been knocked away by a nearly spent bullet, and\nhe was crumpled up and face upward as though he had struggled to his\nfeet and fallen back. He looked rather horrible, with blue eyes wide\nopen and glassily amazed, and the black flies clustering upon his\nclotted wound and round his open mouth....\n\nI halted for a moment at the sight, and found the keen scrutiny of a\nfellow trooper upon me. \"No good waiting for him,\" I said with an\naffectation of indifference. But all through the night I saw him again,\nand marvelled at the stupendous absurdity of such a death. I was a\nlittle feverish, I remember, and engaged in an interminable theological\nargument with myself, why when a man is dead he should leave so queer\nand irrelevant a thing as a body to decay....\n\nI was already very far away from London and Burnmore Park. I doubt if I\nthought of Mary at all for many days.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 3\n\nIt isn't my business to write here any consecutive story of my war\nexperiences. Luck and some latent quality in my composition made me a\nfairly successful soldier. Among other things I have an exceptionally\ngood sense of direction, and that was very useful to me, and in Burnmore\nPark I suppose I had picked up many of the qualities of a scout. I did\nsome fair outpost work during the Ladysmith siege, I could report as\nwell as crawl and watch, and I was already a sergeant when we made a\nnight attack and captured and blew up Long Tom. There, after the fight,\nwhile we were covering the engineers, I got a queer steel ball about the\nsize of a pea in my arm, a bicycle bearings ball it was, and had my\nfirst experience of an army surgeon's knife next day. It was much less\npainful than I had expected. I was also hit during the big assault on\nthe sixth of January in the left shoulder, but so very slightly that I\nwasn't technically disabled. They were the only wounds I got in the war,\nbut I went under with dysentery before the relief; and though I was by\nno means a bad case I was a very yellow-faced, broken-looking\nconvalescent when at last the Boer hosts rolled northward again and\nBuller's men came riding across the flats....\n\nI had seen some stimulating things during those four months of actual\nwarfare, a hundred intense impressions of death, wounds, anger,\npatience, brutality, courage, generosity and wasteful destruction--above\nall, wasteful destruction--to correct the easy optimistic patriotism of\nmy university days. There is a depression in the opening stages of fever\nand a feebleness in a convalescence on a starvation diet that leads men\nto broad and sober views. (Heavens! how I hated the horse\nextract--'chevril' we called it--that served us for beef tea.) When I\ncame down from Ladysmith to the sea to pick up my strength I had not an\nillusion left about the serene, divinely appointed empire of the\nEnglish. But if I had less national conceit, I had certainly more\npatriotic determination. That grew with every day of returning health.\nThe reality of this war had got hold of my imagination, as indeed for a\ntime it got hold of the English imagination altogether, and I was now\nalmost fiercely keen to learn and do. At the first chance I returned to\nactive service, and now I was no longer a disconsolate lover taking war\nfor a cure, but an earnest, and I think reasonably able, young officer,\nvery alert for chances.\n\nI got those chances soon enough. I rejoined our men beyond Kimberley, on\nthe way to Mafeking,--we were the extreme British left in the advance\nupon Pretoria--and I rode with Mahon and was ambushed with him in a\nlittle affair beyond Koodoosrand. It was a sudden brisk encounter. We\ngot fired into at close quarters, but we knew our work by that time,\nand charged home and brought in a handful of prisoners to make up for\nthe men we had lost. A few days later we came into the flattened ruins\nof the quaintest siege in history....\n\nThree days after we relieved Mafeking I had the luck to catch one of\nSnyman's retreating guns rather easily, the only big gun that was taken\nat Mafeking. I came upon it unexpectedly with about twenty men, spotted\na clump of brush four hundred yards ahead, galloped into it before the\nBoers realized the boldness of our game, shot all the draught oxen while\nthey hesitated, and held them up until Chambers arrived on the scene.\nThe incident got perhaps a disproportionate share of attention in the\npapers at home, because of the way in which Mafeking had been kept in\nfocus. I was mentioned twice again in despatches before we rode across\nto join Roberts in Pretoria and see what we believed to be the end of\nthe war. We were too late to go on up to Komatipoort, and had some\nrather blank and troublesome work on the north side of the town. That\nwas indeed the end of the great war; the rest was a struggle with\nguerillas.\n\nEveryone thought things were altogether over. I wrote to my father\ndiscussing the probable date of my return. But there were great chances\nstill to come for an active young officer; the guerilla war was to\nprolong the struggle yet for a whole laborious, eventful year, and I was\nto make the most of those later opportunities....\n\nThose years in South Africa are stuck into my mind like--like those pink\ncolored pages about something else one finds at times in a railway\n_Indicateur_. Chance had put this work in my way, and started me upon\nit with a reputation that wasn't altogether deserved, and I found I\ncould only live up to it and get things done well by a fixed and extreme\nconcentration of my attention. But the whole business was so interesting\nthat I found it possible to make that concentration. Essentially warfare\nis a game of elaborate but witty problems in precaution and\nanticipation, with amazing scope for invention. You so saturate your\nmind with the facts and possibilities of the situation that intuitions\nemerge. It did not do to think of anything beyond those facts and\npossibilities and dodges and counterdodges, for to do so was to let in\nirrelevant and distracting lights. During all that concluding year of\nservice I was not so much myself as a forced and artificial thing I made\nout of myself to meet the special needs of the time. I became a\nBoer-outwitting animal. When I was tired of this specialized thinking,\nthen the best relief, I found, was some quite trivial\noccupation--playing poker, yelling in the chorus of some interminable\nsong one of the men would sing, or coining South African Limericks or\nplaying burlesque _bouts-rim\u00c3\u00a9s_ with Fred Maxim, who was then my second\nin command....\n\nYet occasionally thought overtook me. I remember lying one night out\nupon a huge dark hillside, in a melancholy wilderness of rock-ribbed\nhills, waiting for one of the flying commandoes that were breaking\nnorthward from Cape Colony towards the Orange River in front of Colonel\nEustace. We had been riding all day, I was taking risks in what I was\ndoing, and there is something very cheerless in a fireless bivouac. My\nmind became uncontrollably active.\n\nIt was a clear, still night. The young moon set early in a glow of white\nthat threw the jagged contours of a hill to the south-east into\nstrange, weird prominence. The patches of moonshine evaporated from the\nsummits of the nearer hills, and left them hard and dark. Then there was\nnothing but a great soft black darkness below that jagged edge and above\nit the stars very large and bright. Somewhere under that enormous\nserenity to the south of us the hunted Boers must be halting to snatch\nan hour or so of rest, and beyond them again extended the long thin net\nof the pursuing British. It all seemed infinitely small and remote,\nthere was no sound of it, no hint of it, no searchlight at work, no\nfaintest streamer of smoke nor the reflection of a solitary fire in the\nsky....\n\nAll this business that had held my mind so long was reduced to\ninsignificance between the blackness of the hills and the greatness of\nthe sky; a little trouble, it seemed of no importance under the Southern\nCross. And I fell wondering, as I had not wondered for long, at the\nforces that had brought me to this occupation and the strangeness of\nthis game of war which had filled the minds and tempered the spirit of a\nquarter of a million of men for two hard-living years.\n\nI fell thinking of the dead.\n\nNo soldier in a proper state of mind ever thinks of the dead. At times\nof course one suspects, one catches a man glancing at the pair of boots\nsticking out stiffly from under a blanket, but at once he speaks of\nother things. Nevertheless some suppressed part of my being had been\nstirring up ugly and monstrous memories, of distortion, disfigurement,\ntorment and decay, of dead men in stained and ragged clothes, with their\nsole-worn boots drawn up under them, of the blood trail of a dying man\nwho had crawled up to a dead comrade rather than die alone, of Kaffirs\nheaping limp, pitiful bodies together for burial, of the voices of\ninaccessible wounded in the rain on Waggon Hill crying in the night, of\na heap of men we found in a donga three days dead, of the dumb agony of\nshell-torn horses, and the vast distressful litter and heavy brooding\nstench, the cans and cartridge-cases and filth and bloody rags of a\nshelled and captured laager. I will confess I have never lost my horror\nof dead bodies; they are dreadful to me--dreadful. I dread their stiff\nattitudes, their terrible intent inattention. To this day such memories\nhaunt me. That night they nearly overwhelmed me.... I thought of the\ngrim silence of the surgeon's tent, the miseries and disordered ravings\nof the fever hospital, of the midnight burial of a journalist at\nLadysmith with the distant searchlight on Bulwana flicking suddenly upon\nour faces and making the coffin shine silver white. What a vast trail of\ndestruction South Africa had become! I thought of the black scorched\nstones of burnt and abandoned farms, of wretched natives we had found\nshot like dogs and flung aside, rottenly amazed, decaying in infinite\nindignity; of stories of treachery and fierce revenges sweeping along in\nthe trail of the greater fighting. I knew too well of certain\natrocities,--one had to believe them incredibly stupid to escape the\nconviction that they were incredibly evil.\n\nFor a time my mind could make no headway against its monstrous\nassemblage of horror. There was something in that jagged black hill\nagainst the moonshine and the gigantic basin of darkness out of which it\nrose that seemed to gather all these gaunt and grisly effects into one\nappalling heap of agonizing futility. That rock rose up and crouched\nlike something that broods and watches.\n\nI remember I sat up in the darkness staring at it.\n\nI found myself murmuring: \"Get the proportions of things, get the\nproportions of things!\" I had an absurd impression of a duel between\nmyself and the cavernous antagonism of the huge black spaces below me. I\nargued that all this pain and waste was no more than the selvedge of a\nproportionately limitless fabric of sane, interested, impassioned and\njoyous living. These stiff still memories seemed to refute me. But why\nus? they seemed to insist. In some way it's essential,--this margin. I\nstopped at that.\n\n\"If all this pain, waste, violence, anguish is essential to life, why\ndoes my spirit rise against it? What is wrong with me?\" I got from that\ninto a corner of self-examination. Did I respond overmuch to these\npainful aspects in life? When I was a boy I had never had the spirit\neven to kill rats. Siddons came into the meditation, Siddons, the\nessential Englishman, a little scornful, throwing out contemptuous\nphrases. Soft! Was I a soft? What was a soft? Something not rough, not\nhearty and bloody! I felt I had to own to the word--after years of\nresistance. A dreadful thing it is when a great empire has to rely upon\nsoft soldiers.\n\nWas civilization breeding a type of human being too tender to go on\nliving? I stuck for a time as one does on these nocturnal occasions at\nthe word \"hypersensitive,\" going round it and about it....\n\nI do not know now how it was that I passed from a mood so darkened and\nsunless to one of exceptional exaltation, but I recall very clearly that\nI did. I believe that I made a crowning effort against this despair and\nhorror that had found me out in the darkness and overcome. I cried in\nmy heart for help, as a lost child cries, to God. I seem to remember a\nrush of impassioned prayer, not only for myself, not chiefly for myself,\nbut for all those smashed and soiled and spoilt and battered residues of\nmen whose memories tormented me. I prayed to God that they had not lived\nin vain, that particularly those poor Kaffir scouts might not have lived\nin vain. \"They are like children,\" I said. \"It was a murder of\nchildren.... _By children!_\"\n\nMy horror passed insensibly. I have to feel the dreadfulness of these\nthings, I told myself, because it is good for such a creature as I to\nfeel them dreadful, but if one understood it would all be simple. Not\ndreadful at all. I clung to that and repeated it,--\"it would all be\nperfectly simple.\" It would come out no more horrible than the things\nthat used to frighten me as a child,--the shadow on the stairs, the\nwhite moonrise reflected on a barked and withered tree, a peculiar dream\nof moving geometrical forms, an ugly illustration in the \"Arabian\nNights.\" ...\n\nI do not know how long I wrestled with God and prayed that night, but\nabruptly the shadows broke; and very suddenly and swiftly my spirit\nseemed to flame up into space like some white beacon that is set alight.\nEverything became light and clear and confident. I was assured that all\nwas well with us, with us who lived and fought and with the dead who\nrotted now in fifty thousand hasty graves....\n\nFor a long time it seemed I was repeating again and again with soundless\nlips and finding the deepest comfort in my words:--\"And out of our\nagonies comes victory, out of our agonies comes victory! Have pity on\nus, God our Father!\"\n\nI think that mood passed quite insensibly from waking to a kind of\nclear dreaming. I have an impression that I fell asleep and was aroused\nby a gun. Yet I was certainly still sitting up when I heard that gun.\n\nI was astonished to find things darkly visible about me. I had not noted\nthat the stars were growing pale until the sound of this gun very far\naway called my mind back to the grooves in which it was now accustomed\nto move. I started into absolute wakefulness. A gun?...\n\nI found myself trying to see my watch.\n\nI heard a slipping and clatter of pebbles near me, and discovered Fred\nMaxim at my side. \"Look!\" he said, hoarse with excitement. \"Already!\" He\npointed to a string of dim little figures galloping helter-skelter over\nthe neck and down the gap in the hills towards us.\n\nThey came up against the pale western sky, little nodding swaying black\ndots, and flashed over and were lost in the misty purple groove towards\nus. They must have been riding through the night--the British following.\nTo them we were invisible. Behind us was the shining east, we were in a\nshadow still too dark to betray us.\n\nIn a moment I was afoot and called out to the men, my philosophy, my\ndeep questionings, all torn out of my mind like a page of scribbled\npoetry plucked out of a business note-book. Khaki figures were up all\nabout me passing the word and hurrying to their places. All the\ndispositions I had made overnight came back clear and sharp into my\nmind. We hadn't long for preparations....\n\nIt seems now there were only a few busy moments before the fighting\nbegan. It must have been much longer in reality. By that time we had\nseen their gun come over and a train of carts. They were blundering\nright into us. Every moment it was getting lighter, and the moment of\ncontact nearer. Then \"Crack!\" from down below among the rocks, and there\nwas a sudden stoppage of the trail of dark shapes upon the hillside.\n\"Crack!\" came a shot from our extreme left. I damned the impatient men\nwho had shot away the secret of our presence. But we had to keep them at\na shooting distance. Would the Boers have the wit to charge through us\nbefore the daylight came, or should we hold them? I had a swift,\ndisturbing idea. Would they try a bolt across our front to the left? Had\nwe extended far enough across the deep valley to our left? But they'd\nhesitate on account of their gun. The gun couldn't go that way because\nof the gullies and thickets.... But suppose they tried it! I hung\nbetween momentous decisions....\n\nThen all up the dim hillside I could make out the Boers halting and\nriding back. One rifle across there flashed.\n\nWe held them!...\n\nWe had begun the fight of Pieters Nek which ended before midday with the\nsurrender of Simon Botha and over seven hundred men. It was the crown of\nall my soldiering.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 4\n\nI came back to England at last when I was twenty-six. After the peace of\nVereeniging I worked under the Repatriation Commission which controlled\nthe distribution of returning prisoners and concentrated population to\ntheir homes; for the most part I was distributing stock and grain, and\npresently manoeuvring a sort of ploughing flying column that the dearth\nof horses and oxen made necessary, work that was certainly as hard as if\nfar less exciting than war. That particular work of replanting the\ndesolated country with human beings took hold of my imagination, and for\na time at least seemed quite straightforward and understandable. The\ncomfort of ceasing to destroy!\n\nNo one has written anything that really conveys the quality of that\nrepatriation process; the queer business of bringing these suspicious,\nilliterate, despondent people back to their desolated homes, reuniting\nswarthy fathers and stockish mothers, witnessing their touchingly\ninexpressive encounters, doing what one could to put heart into their\nresumption. Memories come back to me of great littered heaps of luggage,\nbundles, blankets, rough boxes, piled newly purchased stores, ready-made\ndoors, window sashes heaped ready for the waggons, slow-moving,\napathetic figures sitting and eating, an infernal squawking of parrots,\nsometimes a wailing of babies. Repatriation went on to a parrot\nobligato, and I never hear a parrot squawk without a flash of South\nAfrica across my mind. All the prisoners, I believe, brought back\nparrots--some two or three. I had to spread these people out, over a\ncountry still grassless, with teams of war-worn oxen, mules and horses\nthat died by the dozen on my hands. The end of each individual instance\nwas a handshake, and one went lumbering on, leaving the children one had\ndeposited behind one already playing with old ration-tins or hunting\nabout for cartridge-cases, while adults stared at the work they had to\ndo.\n\nThere was something elementary in all that redistribution. I felt at\ntimes like a child playing in a nursery and putting out its bricks and\nsoldiers on the floor. There was a kind of greatness too about the\nprocess, a quality of atonement. And the people I was taking back, the\nmen anyhow, were for the most part charming and wonderful people, very\nsimple and emotional, so that once a big bearded man, when I wanted him\nin the face of an overflowing waggon to abandon about half-a-dozen great\nangular colored West Indian shells he had lugged with him from Bermuda,\nburst into tears of disappointment. I let him take them, and at the end\nI saw them placed with joy and reverence in a little parlor, to become\nthe war heirlooms no doubt of a long and bearded family. As we shook\nhands after our parting coffee he glanced at them with something between\ngratitude and triumph in his eyes.\n\nYes, that was a great work, more especially for a ripening youngster\nsuch as I was at that time. The memory of long rides and tramps over\nthat limitless veld returns to me, lonely in spite of the creaking,\nlumbering waggons and transport riders and Kaffirs that followed behind.\nSouth Africa is a country not only of immense spaces but of an immense\nspaciousness. Everything is far apart; even the grass blades are far\napart. Sometimes one crossed wide stony wastes, sometimes came great\nstretches of tall, yellow-green grass, wheel-high, sometimes a little\ngreen patch of returning cultivation drew nearer for an hour or so,\nsometimes the blundering, toilsome passage of a torrent interrupted our\nslow onward march. And constantly one saw long lines of torn and twisted\nbarbed wire stretching away and away, and here and there one found\narchipelagoes as it were in this dry ocean of the skeletons of cattle,\nand there were places where troops had halted and their scattered\nration-tins shone like diamonds in the sunshine. Occasionally I struck\ntalk, some returning prisoner, some group of discharged British soldiers\nbecome carpenters or bricklayers again and making their pound a day by\nthe work of rebuilding; always everyone was ready to expatiate upon the\nsituation. Usually, however, I was alone, thinking over this immense now\nvanished tornado of a war and this equally astonishing work of healing\nthat was following it.\n\nI became keenly interested in all this great business, and thought at\nfirst of remaining indefinitely in Africa. Repatriation was presently\ndone and finished. I had won Milner's good opinion, and he was anxious\nfor me to go on working in relation to the labor difficulty that rose\nnow more and more into prominence behind the agricultural re-settlement.\nBut when I faced that I found myself in the middle of a tangle\ninfinitely less simple than putting back an agricultural population upon\nits land.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 5\n\nFor the first time in my life I was really looking at the social\nfundamental of Labor.\n\nThere is something astonishingly na\u00c3\u00afve in the unconsciousness with which\npeople of our class float over the great economic realities. All my life\nI had been hearing of the Working Classes, of Industrialism, of Labor\nProblems and the Organization of Labor; but it was only now in South\nAfrica, in this chaotic, crude illuminating period of putting a smashed\nand desolated social order together again, that I perceived these\nfamiliar phrases represented something--something stupendously real.\nThere were, I began to recognize, two sides to civilization; one\ntraditional, immemorial, universal, the side of the homestead, the side\nI had been seeing and restoring; and there was another, ancient, too,\nbut never universal, as old at least as the mines of Syracuse and the\nbuilding of the pyramids, the side that came into view when I emerged\nfrom the dusty station and sighted the squat shanties and slender\nchimneys of Johannesburg, that uprooted side of social life, that\naccumulation of toilers divorced from the soil, which is Industrialism\nand Labor and which carries such people as ourselves, and whatever\nsignificance and possibilities we have, as an elephant carries its\nrider.\n\nNow all Johannesburg and Pretoria were discussing Labor and nothing but\nLabor. Bloemfontein was in conference thereon. Our work of repatriation\nwhich had loomed so large on the southernward veld became here a\nbusiness at once incidental and remote. One felt that a little sooner or\na little later all that would resume and go on, as the rains would, and\nthe veld-grass. But this was something less kindred to the succession of\nthe seasons and the soil. This was a hitch in the upper fabric. Here in\nthe great ugly mine-scarred basin of the Rand, with its bare hillsides,\nhalf the stamps were standing idle, machinery was eating its head off,\ntime and water were running to waste amidst an immense exasperated\ndisputation. Something had given way. The war had spoilt the Kaffir\n\"boy,\" he was demanding enormous wages, he was away from Johannesburg,\nand above all, he would no longer \"go underground.\"\n\nImplicit in all the argument and suggestion about me was this profoundly\nsuggestive fact that some people, quite a lot of people, scores of\nthousands, had to \"go underground.\" Implicit too always in the discourse\nwas the assumption that the talker or writer in question wasn't for a\nmoment to be expected to go there. Those others, whoever they were, had\nto do that for us. Before the war it had been the artless Portuguese\nKaffir, but he alas! was being diverted to open-air employment at\nDelagoa Bay. Should we raise wages and go on with the fatal process of\n\"spoiling the workers,\" should we by imposing a tremendous hut-tax drive\nthe Kaffir into our toils, should we carry the labor hunt across the\nZambesi into Central Africa, should we follow the lead of Lord Kitchener\nand Mr. Creswell and employ the rather dangerous unskilled white labor\n(with \"ideas\" about strikes and socialism) that had drifted into\nJohannesburg, should we do tremendous things with labor-saving\nmachinery, or were we indeed (desperate yet tempting resort!) to bring\nin the cheap Indian or Chinese coolie?\n\nSteadily things were drifting towards that last tremendous experiment.\nThere was a vigorous opposition in South Africa and in England (growing\nthere to an outcry), but behind that proposal was the one vitalizing\nconviction in modern initiative:--indisputably it would pay, _it would\npay_!...\n\nThe human mind has a much more complex and fluctuating process than most\nof those explanatory people who write about psychology would have us\nbelieve. Instead of that simple, direct movement, like the movement of a\npoint, forward and from here to there, one's thoughts advance like an\narmy, sometimes extended over an enormous front, sometimes in \u00c3\u00a9chelon,\nsometimes bunched in a column throwing out skirmishing clouds of\nemotion, some flying and soaring, some crawling, some stopping and\ndying.... In this matter of Labor, for example, I have thought so much,\nthought over the ground again and again, come into it from this way and\nfrom that way, that for the life of me I find it impossible to state at\nall clearly how much I made of these questions during that Johannesburg\ntime. I cannot get back into those ancient ignorances, revive my old\nastonishments and discoveries. Certainly I envisaged the whole process\nmuch less clearly than I do now, ignored difficulties that have since\nentangled me, regarded with a tremendous perplexity aspects that have\nnow become lucidly plain. I came back to England confused, and doing\nwhat confused people are apt to do, clinging to an inadequate phrase\nthat seemed at any rate to define a course of action. The word\n\"efficiency\" had got hold of me. All our troubles came, one assumed,\nfrom being \"inefficient.\" One turned towards politics with a bustling\nair, and was all for fault-finding and renovation.\n\nI sit here at my desk, pen in hand, and trace figures on the\nblotting-paper, and wonder how much I understood at that time. I came\nback to England to work on the side of \"efficiency,\" that is quite\ncertain. A little later I was writing articles and letters about it, so\nthat much is documented. But I think I must have apprehended too by that\ntime some vague outline at least of those wider issues in the s\u00c3\u00a6cular\nconflict between the new forms of human association and the old, to\nwhich contemporary politics and our national fate are no more than\ntransitory eddies and rufflings of the surface waters. It was all so\nnakedly plain there. On the one hand was the primordial, on the other\nthe rankly new. The farm on the veld stood on the veld, a thing of the\nveld, a thing rooted and established there and nowhere else. The dusty,\ncrude, brick-field desolation of the Rand on the other hand did not\nreally belong with any particularity to South Africa at all. It was one\nwith our camps and armies. It was part of something else, something\nstill bigger: a monstrous shadowy arm had thrust out from Europe and\ntorn open this country, erected these chimneys, piled these heaps--and\nsent the ration-tins and cartridge-cases to follow them. It was gigantic\nkindred with that ancient predecessor which had built the walls of\nZimbabwe. And this hungry, impatient demand for myriads of toilers, this\nthreatening inundation of black or brown or yellow bond-serfs was just\nthe natural voice of this colossal system to which I belonged, which had\nbrought me hither, and which I now perceived I did not even begin to\nunderstand....\n\nOne day when asking my way to some forgotten destination, I had pointed\nout to me the Grey and Roberts Deep Mine. Some familiarity in the name\nset me thinking until I recalled that this was the mine in which I had\nonce heard Lady Ladislaw confess large holdings, this mine in which\ngangs of indentured Chinamen would presently be sweating to pay the\nwages of the game-keepers and roadmenders in Burnmore Park....\n\nYes, this was what I was taking in at that time, but it found\nme--inexpressive; what I was saying on my return to England gave me no\nintimation of the broad conceptions growing in my mind. I came back to\nbe one of the many scores of energetic and ambitious young men who were\nparroting \"Efficiency,\" stirring up people and more particularly\nstirring up themselves with the utmost vigor,--and all the time within\ntheir secret hearts more than a little at a loss....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 6\n\nWhile I had been in South Africa circumstances had conspired to alter my\nprospects in life very greatly. Unanticipated freedoms and opportunities\nhad come to me, and it was no longer out of the question for me to think\nof a parliamentary career. Our fortunes had altered. My father had\nceased to be rector of Burnmore, and had become a comparatively wealthy\nman.\n\nMy second cousin, Reginald Stratton, had been drowned in Finland, and\nhis father had only survived the shock of his death a fortnight; his\nsister, Arthur Mason's first wife, had died in giving birth to a\nstillborn child the year before, and my father found himself suddenly\nthe owner of all that large stretch of developing downland and building\nland which old Reginald had bought between Shaddock and Golding on the\nsouth and West Esher station on the north, and in addition of\nconsiderable investments in northern industrials. It was an odd\ncollusion of mortality; we had had only the coldest relations with our\ncousins, and now abruptly through their commercial and speculative\nactivities, which we had always affected to despise and ignore, I was in\na position to attempt the realization of my old political ambitions.\n\nMy cousins' house had not been to my father's taste. He had let it, and\nI came to a new home in a pleasant, plain red-brick house, a hundred and\nfifty years old perhaps, on an open and sunny hillside, sheltered by\ntrees eastward and northward, a few miles to the south-west of\nGuildford. It had all the gracious proportions, the dignified\nsimplicity, the roomy comfort of the good building of that time. It\nlooked sunward; we breakfasted in sunshine in the library, and outside\nwas an old wall with peach trees and a row of pillar roses heavily in\nflower. I had a little feared this place; Burnmore Rectory had been so\nabsolutely home to me with its quiet serenities, its ample familiar\ngarden, its greenhouses and intimately known corners, but I perceived I\nmight have trusted my father's character to preserve his essential\natmosphere. He was so much himself as I remembered him that I did not\neven observe for a day or so that he had not only aged considerably but\ndiscarded the last vestiges of clerical costume in his attire. He met me\nin front of the house and led me into a wide panelled hall and wrung my\nhand again and again, deeply moved and very inexpressive. \"Did you have\na good journey?\" he asked again and again, with tears in his eyes. \"Did\nyou have a comfortable journey?\"\n\n\"I've not seen the house,\" said I. \"It looks fine.\"\n\n\"_You're_ a man,\" he said, and patted my shoulder. \"Of course! It was at\nBurnmore.\"\n\n\"You're not changed,\" I said. \"You're not an atom changed.\"\n\n\"How could I?\" he replied. \"Come--come and have something to eat. You\nought to have something to eat.\"\n\nWe talked of the house and what a good house it was, and he took me out\ninto the garden to see the peaches and grape vine and then brought me\nback without showing them to me in order to greet my cousin. \"It's very\nlike Burnmore,\" he said with his eyes devouring me, \"very like. A\nlittle more space and--no services. No services at all. That makes a gap\nof course. There's a little chap about here, you'll find--his name is\nWednesday--who sorts my papers and calls himself my secretary.... Not\nnecessary perhaps but--_I missed the curate_.\"\n\nHe said he was reading more than he used to do now that the parish was\noff his hands, and he was preparing material for a book. It was, he\nexplained later, to take the form of a huge essay ostensibly on Secular\nCanons, but its purport was to be no less than the complete\nsecularization of the Church of England. At first he wanted merely to\nthrow open the cathedral chapters to distinguished laymen, irrespective\nof their theological opinions, and to make each English cathedral a\ncentre of intellectual activity, a college as it were of philosophers\nand writers. But afterwards his suggestions grew bolder, the Articles of\nReligion were to be set aside, the creeds made optional even for the\nclergy. His dream became more and more richly picturesque until at last\nhe saw Canterbury a realized Thelema, and St. Paul's a new Academic\nGrove. He was to work at that remarkable proposal intermittently for\nmany years, and to leave it at last no more than a shapeless mass of\nmemoranda, fragmentary essays, and selected passages for quotation. Yet\nmere patchwork and scrapbook as it would be, I still have some thought\nof publishing it. There is a large human charity about it, a sun too\nbroad and warm, a reasonableness too wide and free perhaps for the timid\nconvulsive quality of our time, yet all good as good wine for the wise.\nIs it incredible that a day should come when our great grey monuments to\nthe Norman spirit should cease to be occupied by narrow-witted parsons\nand besieged by narrow-souled dissenters, the soul of our race in exile\nfrom the home and place our fathers built for it?...\n\nIf he was not perceptibly changed, I thought my cousin Jane had become\nmore than a little sharper and stiffer. She did not like my uncle's own\npersonal secularization, and still less the glimpses she got of the\nampler intentions of his book. She missed the proximity to the church\nand her parochial authority. But she was always a silent woman, and made\nher comments with her profile and not with her tongue....\n\n\"I'm glad you've come back, Stephen,\" said my father as we sat together\nafter dinner and her departure, with port and tall silver candlesticks\nand shining mahogany between us. \"I've missed you. I've done my best to\nfollow things out there. I've got, I suppose, every press mention\nthere's been of you during the war and since. I've subscribed to two\npress-cutting agencies, so that if one missed you the other fellow got\nyou. Perhaps you'll like to read them over one of these days.... You\nsee, there's not been a soldier in the family since the Peninsular War,\nand so I've been particularly interested.... You must tell me all the\nthings you're thinking of, and what you mean to do. This last\nstuff--this Chinese business--it puzzles me. I want to know what you\nthink of it--and everything.\"\n\nI did my best to give him my ideas such as they were. And as they were\nstill very vague ideas I have no doubt he found me rhetorical. I can\nimagine myself talking of the White Man's Burthen, and how in Africa it\nhad seemed at first to sit rather staggeringly upon our under-trained\nshoulders. I spoke of slackness and planlessness.\n\n\"I've come back in search of efficiency.\" I have no doubt I said that\nat any rate.\n\n\"We're trying to run this big empire,\" I may have explained, \"with\nunder-trained, under-educated, poor-spirited stuff, and we shall come a\ncropper unless we raise our quality. I'm still Imperialist, more than\never I was. But I'm an Imperialist on a different footing. I've no great\nillusions left about the Superiority of the Anglo-Saxons. All that has\ngone. But I do think it will be a monstrous waste, a disaster to human\npossibilities if this great liberal-spirited empire sprawls itself\nasunder for the want of a little gravity and purpose. And it's here the\nwork has to be done, the work of training and bracing up and stimulating\nthe public imagination....\"\n\nYes, that would be the sort of thing I should have said in those days.\nThere's an old _National Review_ on my desk as I write, containing an\narticle by me with some of those very phrases in it. I have been looking\nat it in order to remind myself of my own forgotten eloquence.\n\n\"Yes,\" I remember my father saying. \"Yes.\" And then after reflection,\n\"But those coolies, those Chinese coolies. You can't build up an\nimperial population by importing coolies.\"\n\n\"I don't like that side of the business myself,\" I said. \"It's detail.\"\n\n\"Perhaps. But the Liberals will turn you out on it next year. And then\nstart badgering public houses and looting the church.... And then this\nTariff talk! Everybody on our side seems to be mixing up the unity of\nthe empire with tariffs. It's a pity. Salisbury wouldn't have stood it.\nUnity! Unity depends on a common literature and a common language and\ncommon ideas and sympathies. It doesn't unite people for them to be\nforced to trade with each other. Trading isn't friendship. I don't trade\nwith my friends and I don't make friends with my tradesmen. Natural\nenemies--polite of course but antagonists. Are you keen over this Tariff\nstuff, Steve?\"\n\n\"Not a bit,\" I said. \"That too seems a detail.\"\n\n\"It doesn't seem to be keeping its place as a detail,\" said my father.\n\"Very few men can touch tariffs and not get a little soiled. I hate all\nthis international sharping, all these attempts to get artificial\nadvantages, all this making poor people buy inferior goods dear, in the\nname of the flag. If it comes to that, damn the flag! Custom-houses are\nugly things, Stephen; the dirty side of nationality. Dirty things,\nignoble, cross, cunning things.... They wake you up in the small hours\nand rout over your bags.... An imperial people ought to be an urbane\npeople, a civilizing people--above such petty irritating things. I'd as\nsoon put barbed wire along the footpath across that field where the\nvillage children go to school. Or claim that our mushrooms are\ncultivated. Or prosecute a Sunday-Society Cockney for picking my\nprimroses. Custom-houses indeed! It's Chinese. There are things a Great\nCountry mustn't do, Stephen. A country like ours ought to get along\nwithout the manners of a hard-breathing competitive cad.... If it can't\nI'd rather it didn't get along.... What's the good of a huckster\ncountry?--it's like having a wife on the streets. It's no excuse that\nshe brings you money. But since the peace, and that man Chamberlain's\nvisit to Africa, you Imperialists seem to have got this nasty spirit all\nover you.... The Germans do it, you say!\"\n\nMy father shut one eye and regarded the color of his port against the\nwaning light. \"Let _'em_,\" he said.... \"Fancy!--quoting the _Germans_!\nWhen I was a boy, there weren't any Germans. They came up after '70.\nStatecraft from Germany! And statesmen from Birmingham! German silver\nand Electroplated Empires.... No.\"\n\n\"It's just a part of our narrow outlook,\" I answered from the hearthrug,\nafter a pause. \"It's because we're so--limited that everyone is\ntranslating the greatness of empire into preferential trading and\njealousy of Germany. It's for something bigger than that that I've\nreturned.\"\n\n\"Those big things come slowly,\" said my father. And then with a sigh:\n\"Age after age. They seem at times--to be standing still. Good things go\nwith the bad; bad things come with the good....\"\n\nI remember him saying that as though I could still hear him.\n\nIt must have been after dinner, for he was sitting, duskily indistinct,\nagainst the light, with a voice coming out to him. The candles had not\nbeen brought in, and the view one saw through the big plate glass window\nbehind him was very clear and splendid. Those little Wealden hills in\nSurrey and Sussex assume at times, for all that by Swiss standards they\nare the merest ridges of earth, the dignity and mystery of great\nmountains. Now, the crests of Hindhead and Blackdown, purple black\nagainst the level gold of the evening sky, might have been some\nhigh-flung boundary chain. Nearer there gathered banks and pools of\nluminous lavender-tinted mist out of which hills of pinewood rose like\nislands out of the sea. The intervening spaces were magnified to\ncontinental dimensions. And the closer lowlier things over which we\nlooked, the cottages below us, were grey and black and dim, pierced by a\nfew luminous orange windows and with a solitary street lamp shining like\na star; the village might have been nestling a mountain's height below\ninstead of a couple of hundred feet.\n\nI left my hearthrug, and walked to the window to survey this.\n\n\"Who's got all that land stretching away there; that little blunted\nsierra of pines and escarpments I mean?\"\n\nMy father halted for an instant in his answer, and glanced over his\nshoulder.\n\n\"Wardingham and Baxter share all those coppices,\" he remarked. \"They\ncome up to my corner on each side.\"\n\n\"But the dark heather and pine land beyond. With just the gables of a\nhouse among the trees.\"\n\n\"Oh? _that_,\" he said with a careful note of indifference.\n\"That's--Justin. You know Justin. He used to come to Burnmore Park.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE SIXTH\n\nLADY MARY JUSTIN\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 1\n\nI did not see Lady Mary Justin for nearly seven months after my return\nto England. Of course I had known that a meeting was inevitable, and I\nhad taken that very carefully into consideration before I decided to\nleave South Africa. But many things had happened to me during those\ncrowded years, so that it seemed possible that that former magic would\nno longer sway and distress me. Not only had new imaginative interests\ntaken hold of me but--I had parted from adolescence. I was a man. I had\nbeen through a great war, seen death abundantly, seen hardship and\npassion, and known hunger and shame and desire. A hundred disillusioning\nrevelations of the quality of life had come to me; once for example when\nwe were taking some people to the concentration camps it had been\nnecessary to assist at the premature birth of a child by the wayside, a\nstartlingly gory and agonizing business for a young man to deal with.\nHeavens! how it shocked me! I could give a score of such grim\npictures--and queer pictures....\n\nAnd it wasn't only the earthlier aspects of the life about me but also\nof the life within me that I had been discovering. The first wonder and\ninnocence, the worshipping, dawn-clear passion of youth, had gone out of\nme for ever....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 2\n\nWe met at a dinner. It was at a house the Tarvrilles had taken for the\nseason in Mayfair. The drawing-room was a big white square apartment\nwith several big pictures and a pane of plate glass above the fireplace\nin the position in which one usually finds a mirror; this showed another\nroom beyond, containing an exceptionally large, gloriously colored\nportrait in pastel--larger than I had ever thought pastels could be.\nExcept for the pictures both rooms were almost colorless. It was a\nbrilliant dinner, with a predominating note of ruby; three of the women\nwore ruby velvet; and Ellersley was present just back from Arabia, and\nEthel Manton, Lady Hendon and the Duchess of Clynes. I was greeted by\nLady Tarvrille, spoke to Ellersley and Lady Hendon, and then discovered\na lady in a dress of blue and pearls standing quite still under a\npicture in the opposite corner of the room and regarding me attentively.\nIt was Mary. Some man was beside her, a tall grey man with a broad\ncrimson ribbon, and I think he must have spoken of me to her. It was as\nif she had just turned to look at me.\n\nConstantly during those intervening months I had been thinking of\nmeeting her. None the less there was a shock, not so much of surprise as\nof deferred anticipation. There she stood like something amazingly\nforgotten that was now amazingly recalled. She struck me in that brief\ncrowded instant of recognition as being exactly the person she had been\nwhen we had made love in Burnmore Park; there were her eyes, at once\nfrank and sidelong, the old familiar sweep of her hair, the old familiar\ntilt of the chin, the faint humor of her lip, and at the same time she\nseemed to be something altogether different from the memories I had\ncherished, she was something graver, something inherently more splendid\nthan they had recorded. Her face lit now with recognition.\n\nI went across to her at once, with some dull obviousness upon my lips.\n\n\"And so you are back from Africa at last,\" she said, still unsmiling. \"I\nsaw about you in the papers.... You had a good time.\"\n\n\"I had great good luck,\" I replied.\n\n\"I never dreamt when we were boy and girl together that you would make a\nsoldier.\"\n\nI think I said that luck made soldiers.\n\nThen I think we found a difficulty in going on with our talk, and began\na dull little argument that would have been stupidly egotistical on my\npart if it hadn't been so obviously merely clumsy, about luck making\nsoldiers or only finding them out. I saw that she had not intended to\nconvey any doubt of my military capacity but only of that natural\ninsensitiveness which is supposed to be needed in a soldier. But our\nminds were remote from the words upon our lips. We were like aphasiacs\nwho say one thing while they intend something altogether different. The\nimpulse that had brought me across to her had brought me up to a wall of\nimpossible utterances. It was with a real quality of rescue that our\nhostess came between us to tell us our partners at the dinner-table,\nand to introduce me to mine. \"You shall have him again on your other\nside,\" she said to Lady Mary with a charming smile for me, treating me\nas if I was a lion in request instead of the mere outsider I was.\n\nWe talked very little at dinner. Both of us I think were quite unequal\nto the occasion. Whatever meetings we had imagined, certainly neither of\nus had thought of this very possible encounter, a long disconcerting\nhour side by side. I began to remember old happenings with an\nastonishing vividness; there within six inches of me was the hand I had\nkissed; her voice was the same to its lightest shade, her hair flowed\noff her forehead with the same amazingly familiar wave. Was she too\nremembering? But I perhaps had changed altogether....\n\n\"Why did you go away as you did?\" she asked abruptly, when for a moment\nwe were isolated conversationally. \"Why did you never write?\"\n\nShe had still that phantom lisp.\n\n\"What else could I do?\"\n\nShe turned away from me and answered the man on her left, who had just\naddressed her....\n\nWhen the mid-dinner change came we talked a little about indifferent\nthings, making a stiff conversation like a bridge over a torrent of\nunspoken intimacies. We discussed something; I think Lady Tarvrille's\nflowers and the Cape Flora and gardens. She told me she had a Japanese\ngarden with three Japanese gardeners. They were wonderful little men to\nwatch. \"Humming-bird gardeners,\" she called them. \"They wear their\nnative costume.\"\n\n\"We are your neighbors in Surrey,\" she said, going off abruptly from\nthat. \"We are quite near to your father.\"\n\nShe paused with that characteristic effect of deliberation in her\nclosed lips. Then she added: \"I can see the trees behind your father's\nhouse from the window of my room.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"You take all our southward skyline.\"\n\nShe turned her face to me with the manner of a great lady adding a new\nacquaintance to her collection. But her eyes met mine very steadily and\nintimately. \"Mr. Stratton,\" she said--it was the first time in her life\nshe had called me that--\"when we come back to Surrey I want you to come\nand see me and tell me of all the things you are going to do. Will you?\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 3\n\nThat meeting, that revival, must have been late in November or early in\nDecember. Already by that time I had met your mother. I write to you,\nlittle son, not to you as you are now, but to the man you are someday to\nbe. I write to understand myself, and, so far as I can understand, to\nmake you understand. So that I want you to go back with me for a time\ninto the days before your birth, to think not of that dear spirit of\nlove who broods over you three children, that wise, sure mother who\nrules your life, but of a young and slender girl, Rachel More, younger\nthen than you will be when at last this story comes into your hands. For\nunless you think of her as being a girl, if you let your present\nknowledge of her fill out this part in our story, you will fail to\nunderstand the proportions of these two in my life. So I shall write of\nher here as Rachel More, as if she were someone as completely\ndissociated from yourself as Lady Mary; as if she were someone in the\nstory of my life who had as little to do with yours.\n\nI had met her in September. The house my father lived in is about twelve\nmiles away from your mother's home at Ridinghanger, and I was taken over\nby Percy Restall in his motor-car. Restall had just become a convert to\nthis new mode of locomotion, and he was very active with a huge,\nmalignant-looking French car that opened behind, and had a kind of poke\nbonnet and all sorts of features that have since disappeared from the\nautomobile world. He took everyone that he could lay hands upon for\nrides,--he called it extending their range, and he called upon everyone\nelse to show off the car; he was responsible for more introduction and\nsocial admixture in that part of Surrey than had occurred during the\nprevious century. We punctured in the Ridinghanger drive, Restall did\nhis own repairs, and so it was we stayed for nearly four hours and\ninstead of a mere caller I became a familiar friend of the family.\n\nYour mother then was still not eighteen, a soft white slip of being,\ntall, slender, brown-haired and silent, with very still deep dark eyes.\nShe and your three aunts formed a very gracious group of young women\nindeed; Alice then as now the most assertive, with a gay initiative and\na fluent tongue; Molly already a sun-brown gipsy, and Norah still a\npig-tailed thing of lank legs and wild embraces and the pinkest of swift\npink blushes; your uncle Sidney, with his shy lank moodiness, acted the\nbrotherly part of a foil. There were several stray visitors, young men\nand maidens, there were always stray visitors in those days at\nRidinghanger, and your grandmother, rosy and bright-eyed, maintained a\ngentle flow of creature comforts and kindly but humorous observations. I\ndo not remember your grandfather on this occasion; probably he wasn't\nthere.\n\nThere was tea, and we played tennis and walked about and occasionally\nvisited Restall, who was getting dirtier and dirtier, and crosser and\ncrosser at his repairs, and spreading a continually more remarkable\nassemblage of parts and instruments over the grass about him. He looked\nat last more like a pitch in the Caledonian market than a decent country\ngentleman paying an afternoon call. And then back to more tennis and\nmore talk. We fell into a discussion of Tariff Reform as we sat taking\ntea. Two of the visitor youths were strongly infected by the new\nteachings which were overshadowing the outlook of British Imperialism.\nSome mean phrase about not conquering Africa for the German bagman, some\nugly turn of thought that at a touch brought down Empire to the level of\na tradesman's advantage, fell from one of them, and stirred me to sudden\nindignation. I began to talk of things that had been gathering in my\nmind for some time.\n\nI do not know what I said. It was in the vein of my father's talk no\ndoubt. But I think that for once I may have been eloquent. And in the\nmidst of my demand for ideals in politics that were wider and deeper\nthan artful buying and selling, that looked beyond a vulgar aggression\nand a churl's dread and hatred of foreign things, while I struggled to\nsay how great and noble a thing empire might be, I saw Rachel's face.\nThis, it was manifest, was a new kind of talk to her. Her dark eyes were\nalight with a beautiful enthusiasm for what I was trying to say, and\nfor what in the light of that glowing reception I seemed to be.\n\nI felt that queer shame one feels when one is taken suddenly at the full\nvalue of one's utmost expressions. I felt as though I had cheated her,\nwas passing myself off for something as great and splendid as the Empire\nof my dreams. It is hard to dissociate oneself from the fine things to\nwhich one aspires. I stopped almost abruptly. Dumbly her eyes bade me go\non, but when I spoke again it was at a lower level....\n\nThat look in Rachel's eyes remained with me. My mind had flashed very\nrapidly from the realization of its significance to the thought that if\none could be sure of that, then indeed one could pitch oneself high.\nRachel, I felt, had something for me that I needed profoundly, without\never having known before that I needed it. She had the supreme gifts of\nbelief and devotion; in that instant's gleam it seemed she held them out\nto me.\n\nNever before in my life had it seemed credible to me that anyone could\ngive me that, or that I could hope for such a gift of support and\nsacrifice. Love as I had known it had been a community and an alliance,\na frank abundant meeting; but this was another kind of love that shone\nfor an instant and promised, and vanished shyly out of sight as I and\nRachel looked at one another.\n\nSome interruption occurred. Restall came, I think, blackened by\nprogress, to drink a cup of tea and negotiate the loan of a kitchen\nskewer. A kitchen skewer it appeared was all that was needed to complete\nhis reconstruction in the avenue. Norah darted off for a kitchen skewer,\nwhile Restall drank. And then there was a drift to tennis, and Rachel\nand I were partners. All this time I was in a state of startled\nattention towards her, full of this astounding impression that something\nwonderful and unprecedented had flowed out from her towards my life,\nfull too of doubts now whether that shining response had ever occurred,\nwhether some trick of light and my brain had not deceived me. I wanted\ntremendously to talk to her, and did not know how to begin in any\nserious fashion. Beyond everything I wanted to see again that deep onset\nof belief....\n\n\"Come again,\" said your grandmother to me, \"come again!\" after she had\ntried in vain to make Restall stay for an informal supper. I was all for\nstaying, but Restall said darkly, \"There are the Lamps.\"\n\n\"But they will be all right,\" said Mrs. More.\n\n\"I can't trust 'em,\" said Restall, with a deepening gloom. \"Not after\n_that_.\" The motor-car looked self-conscious and uncomfortable, but said\nnothing by way of excuse, and Restall took me off in it like one whose\nsun has set for ever. \"I wouldn't be surprised,\" said Restall as we went\ndown the drive, \"if the damned thing turned a somersault. It might\ndo--anything.\" Those were the brighter days of motoring.\n\nThe next time I went over released from Restall's limitations, and\nstayed to a jolly family supper. I found remarkably few obstacles in my\nway to a better acquaintance with Rachel. You see I was an entirely\neligible and desirable young man in Mrs. More's eyes....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 4\n\nWhen I recall these long past emotions again, I am struck by the\nprofound essential difference between my feelings for your mother and\nfor Mary. They were so different that it seems scarcely rational to me\nthat they should be called by the same name. Yet each was love,\nprofoundly deep and sincere. The contrast lies, I think, in our relative\nages, and our relative maturity; that altered the quality of all our\nemotions. The one was the love of a man of six-and-twenty, exceptionally\nseasoned and experienced and responsible for his years, for a girl still\nat school, a girl attractively beautiful, mysterious and unknown to him;\nthe other was the love of coevals, who had been playmates and intimate\ncompanions, and of whom the woman was certainly as capable and wilful as\nthe man.\n\nNow it is exceptional for men to love women of their own age, it is the\ncommoner thing that they should love maidens younger and often much\nyounger than themselves. This is true more particularly of our own\nclass; the masculine thirties and forties marry the feminine twenties,\nall the prevailing sentiment and usage between the sexes rises naturally\nout of that. We treat this seniority as though it were a virile\ncharacteristic; we treat the man as though he were a natural senior, we\nexpect a weakness, a timid deference, in the girl. I and Mary had loved\none another as two rivers run together on the way to the sea, we had\ngrown up side by side to the moment when we kissed; but I sought your\nmother, I watched her and desired her and chose her, very tenderly and\nworshipfully indeed, to be mine. I do not remember that there was any\ncorresponding intention in my mind to be hers. I do not think that that\nidea came in at all. She was something to be won, something playing an\ninferior and retreating part. And I was artificial in all my attitudes\nto her, I thought of what would interest her, what would please her, I\nknew from the outset that what she saw in me to rouse that deep, shy\nglow of exaltation in her face was illusion, illusion it was my business\nto sustain. And so I won her, and long years had to pass, years of\nsecret loneliness and hidden feelings, of preposterous pretences and\ncovert perplexities, before we escaped from that crippling tradition of\ninequality and looked into one another's eyes with understanding and\nforgiveness, a woman and a man.\n\nI made no great secret of the interest and attraction I found in Rachel,\nand the Mores made none of their entire approval of me. I walked over on\nthe second occasion, and Ridinghanger opened out, a great flower of\ngenial appreciation that I came alone, hiding nothing of its dawning\nperception that it was Rachel in particular I came to see.\n\nYour grandmother's match-making was as honest as the day. There was the\nsame salad of family and visitors as on the former afternoon, and this\ntime I met Freshman, who was destined to marry Alice; there was tea,\ntennis, and, by your grandmother's suggestion, a walk to see the sunset\nfrom the crest of the hill. Rachel and I walked across the breezy\nmoorland together, while I talked and tempted her to talk.\n\nWhat, I wonder, did we talk about? English scenery, I think, and African\nscenery and the Weald about us, and the long history of the Weald and\nits present and future, and at last even a little of politics. I had\nnever explored the mind of a girl of seventeen before; there was a\nsurprise in all she knew and a delight in all she didn't know, and about\nherself a candor, a fresh simplicity of outlook that was sweeter than\nthe clear air about us, sweeter than sunshine or the rising song of a\nlark. She believed so gallantly and beautifully, she was so perfectly,\nunaffectedly and certainly prepared to be a brave and noble person--if\nonly life would let her. And she hadn't as yet any suspicion that life\nmight make that difficult....\n\nI went to Ridinghanger a number of times in the spring and early summer.\nI talked a great deal with Rachel, and still I did not make love to her.\nIt was always in my mind that I would make love to her, the heavens and\nearth and all her family were propitious, glowing golden with consent\nand approval, I thought she was the most wonderful and beautiful thing\nin life, and her eyes, the intonation of her voice, her hurrying color\nand a hundred little involuntary signs told me how she quickened at my\ncoming. But there was a shyness. I loved her as one loves and admires a\nwhite flower or a beautiful child--some stranger's child. I felt that I\nmight make her afraid of me. I had never before thought that to make\nlove is a coarse thing. But still at high summer when I met Mary again\nno definite thing had been said between myself and Rachel. But we knew,\neach of us knew, that somewhere in a world less palpable, in fairyland,\nin dreamland, we had met and made our vows.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 5\n\nYou see how far my imagination had gone towards readjustment when Mary\nreturned into my life. You see how strange and distant it was to meet\nher again, changed completely into the great lady she had intended to\nbe, speaking to me with the restrained and practised charm of a woman\nwho is young and beautiful and prominent and powerful and secure. There\nwas no immediate sense of shock in that resumption of our broken\nintercourse, it seemed to me that night simply that something odd and\ncurious had occurred. I do not remember how we parted that evening or\nwhether we even saw each other after dinner was over, but from that hour\nforth Mary by insensible degrees resumed her old predominance in my\nmind. I woke up in the night and thought about her, and next day I found\nmyself thinking of her, remembering things out of the past and recalling\nand examining every detail of the overnight encounter. How cold and\nineffective we had been, both of us! We had been like people resuming a\ndisused and partially forgotten language. Had she changed towards me?\nDid she indeed want to see me again or was that invitation a mere\ndemonstration of how entirely unimportant seeing me or not seeing me had\nbecome?\n\nThen I would find myself thinking with the utmost particularity of her\nface. Had it changed at all? Was it altogether changed? I seemed to have\nforgotten everything and remembered everything; that peculiar slight\nthickness of her eyelids that gave her eyes their tenderness, that light\nfirmness of her lips. Of course she would want to talk to me, as now I\nperceived I wanted to talk to her.\n\nWas I in love with her still? It seemed to me then that I was not. It\nhad not been that hesitating fierceness, that pride and demand and\ndoubt, which is passionate love, that had made all my sensations strange\nto me as I sat beside her. It had been something larger and finer,\nsomething great and embracing, a return to fellowship. Here beside me,\nveiled from me only by our transient embarrassment and the tarnish of\nseparation and silences, was the one person who had ever broken down the\ncrust of shy insincerity which is so incurably my characteristic and\ntalked intimately of the inmost things of life to me. I discovered now\nfor the first time how intense had been my loneliness for the past five\nyears. I discovered now that through all those years I had been hungry\nfor such talk as Mary alone could give me. My mind was filled with talk,\nfilled with things I desired to say to her; that chaos began to take on\na multitudinous expression at the touch of her spirit. I began to\nimagine conversations with her, to prepare reports for her of those new\nworlds of sensation and activity I had discovered since that boyish\nparting.\n\nBut when at last that talk came it was altogether different from any of\nthose I had invented.\n\nShe wrote to me when she came down into Surrey and I walked over to\nMartens the next afternoon. I found her in her own sitting-room, a\nbeautiful characteristic apartment with tall French windows hung with\nblue curtains, a large writing-desk and a great litter of books. The\nroom gave upon a broad sunlit terrace with a balustrading of yellowish\nstone, on which there stood great oleanders. Beyond was a flower garden\nand then the dark shadows of cypresses. She was standing as I came in to\nher, as though she had seen me coming across the lawns and had been\nawaiting my entrance. \"I thought you might come to-day,\" she said, and\ntold the manservant to deny her to other callers. Again she produced\nthat queer effect of being at once altogether the same and altogether\ndifferent from the Mary I had known. \"Justin,\" she said, \"is in Paris.\nHe comes back on Friday.\" I saw then that the change lay in her bearing,\nthat for the easy confidence of the girl she had now the deliberate\ndignity and control of a married woman--a very splendidly and spaciously\nmarried woman. Her manner had been purged of impulse. Since we had met\nshe had stood, the mistress of great houses, and had dealt with\nthousands of people.\n\n\"You walked over to me?\"\n\n\"I walked,\" I said. \"It is nearly a straight path. You know it?\"\n\n\"You came over the heather beyond our pine wood,\" she confirmed. And\nthen I think we talked some polite unrealities about Surrey scenery and\nthe weather. It was so formal that by a common impulse we let the topic\nsuddenly die. We stood through a pause, a hesitation. Were we indeed to\ngo on at that altitude of cold civility? She turned to the window as if\nthe view was to serve again.\n\n\"Sit down,\" she said and dropped into a chair against the light, looking\naway from me across the wide green space of afternoon sunshine. I sat\ndown on a little sofa, at a loss also.\n\n\"And so,\" she said, turning her face to me suddenly, \"you come back into\nmy life.\" And I was amazed to see that the brightness of her eyes was\ntears. \"We've lived--five years.\"\n\n\"You,\" I said clumsily, \"have done all sorts of things. I hear of\nyou--patronizing young artists--organizing experiments in village\neducation.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"I've done all sorts of things. One has to. Forced,\nunreal things for the most part. You I expect have done--all sorts of\nthings also.... But yours have been real things....\"\n\n\"All things,\" I remarked sententiously, \"are real. And all of them a\nlittle unreal. South Africa has been wonderful. And now it is all over\none doubts if it really happened. Like that incredulous mood after a\nstorm of passion.\"\n\n\"You've come back for good?\"\n\n\"For good. I want to do things in England.\"\n\n\"Politics?\"\n\n\"If I can get into that.\"\n\nAgain a pause. There came the characteristic moment of deliberation that\nI remembered so well.\n\n\"I never meant you,\" she said, \"to go away.... You could have written.\nYou never answered the notes I sent.\"\n\n\"I was frantic,\" I said, \"with loss and jealousy. I wanted to forget.\"\n\n\"And you forgot?\"\n\n\"I did my best.\"\n\n\"I did my best,\" said Mary. \"And now---- Have you forgotten?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Nor I. I thought I had. Until I saw you again. I've thought of you\nendlessly. I've wanted to talk to you. We had a way of talking together.\nBut you went away. You turned your back as though all that was\nnothing--not worth having. You--you drove home my marriage, Stephen. You\nmade me know what a thing of sex a woman is to a man--and how little\nelse....\"\n\nShe paused.\n\n\"You see,\" I said slowly. \"You had made me, as people say, in love with\nyou.... I don't know--if you remember everything....\"\n\nShe looked me in the eyes for a moment.\n\n\"I hadn't been fair,\" she said with an abrupt abandonment of accusation.\n\"But you know, Stephen, that night---- I meant to explain. And\nafterwards.... Things sometimes go as one hasn't expected them to go,\neven the things one has planned to say. I suppose--I treated\nyou--disgustingly.\"\n\nI protested.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"I treated you as I did--and I thought you would stand\nit. I _knew_, I knew then as well as you do now that male to my female\nyou wouldn't stand it, but somehow--I thought there were other things.\nThings that could override that....\"\n\n\"Not,\" I said, \"for a boy of one-and-twenty.\"\n\n\"But in a man of twenty-six?\"\n\nI weighed the question. \"Things are different,\" I said, and then, \"Yes.\nAnyhow now--if I may come back penitent,--to a friendship.\"\n\nWe looked at one another gravely. Faintly in our ears sounded the music\nof past and distant things. We pretended to hear nothing of that, tried\nhonestly to hear nothing of it. I had not remembered how steadfast and\nquiet her face could be. \"Yes,\" she said, \"a friendship.\"\n\n\"I've always had you in my mind, Stephen,\" she said. \"When I saw I\ncouldn't marry you, it seemed to me I had better marry and be free of\nany further hope. I thought we could get over that. 'Let's get it over,'\nI thought. Now--at any rate--we have got over that.\" Her eyes verified\nher words a little doubtfully. \"And we can talk and you can tell me of\nyour life, and the things you want to do that make life worth living.\nOh! life has been _stupid_ without you, Stephen, large and expensive and\naimless....Tell me of your politics. They say--Justin told me--you think\nof parliament?\"\n\n\"I want to do that. I have been thinking---- In fact I am going to\nstand.\" I found myself hesitating on the verge of phrases in the quality\nof a review article. It was too unreal for her presence. And yet it was\nthis she seemed to want from me. \"This,\" I said, \"is a phase of great\nopportunities. The war has stirred the Empire to a sense of itself, to a\nsense of what it might be. Of course this Tariff Reform row is a squalid\nnuisance; it may kill out all the fine spirit again before anything is\ndone. Everything will become a haggle, a chaffering of figures.... All\nthe more reason why we should try and save things from the commercial\ntraveller. If the Empire is anything at all, it is something infinitely\nmore than a combination in restraint of trade....\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"And you want to take that line. The high line.\"\n\n\"If one does not take the high line,\" I said, \"what does one go into\npolitics for?\"\n\n\"Stephen,\" she smiled, \"you haven't lost a sort of simplicity---- People\ngo into politics because it looks important, because other people go\ninto politics, because they can get titles and a sense of influence\nand--other things. And then there are quarrels, old grudges to serve.\"\n\n\"These are roughnesses of the surface.\"\n\n\"Old Stephen!\" she cried with the note of a mother. \"They will worry you\nin politics.\"\n\nI laughed. \"Perhaps I'm not altogether so simple.\"\n\n\"Oh! you'll get through. You have a way of going on. But I shall have\nto watch over you. I see I shall have to watch over you. Tell me of the\nthings you mean to do. Where are you standing?\"\n\nI began to tell her a little disjointedly of the probabilities of my\nYorkshire constituency....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 6\n\nI have a vivid vignette in my memory of my return to my father's house,\ndown through the pine woods and by the winding path across the deep\nvalley that separated our two ridges. I was thinking of Mary and nothing\nbut Mary in all the world and of the friendly sweetness of her eyes and\nthe clean strong sharpness of her voice. That sweet white figure of\nRachel that had been creeping to an ascendancy in my imagination was\nmoonlight to her sunrise. I knew it was Mary I loved and had always\nloved. I wanted passionately to be as she desired, the friend she\ndemanded, that intimate brother and confederate, but all my heart cried\nout for her, cried out for her altogether.\n\nI would be her friend, I repeated to myself, I would be her friend. I\nwould talk to her often, plan with her, work with her. I could put my\nmeanings into her life and she should throw her beauty over mine. I\nbegan already to dream of the talk of to-morrow's meeting....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 7\n\nAnd now let me go on to tell at once the thing that changed life for\nboth of us altogether, that turned us out of the courses that seemed\nset for us, our spacious, successful and divergent ways, she to the\ntragedy of her death and I from all the prospects of the public career\nthat lay before me to the work that now, toilsomely, inadequately and\nblunderingly enough, I do. It was to pierce and slash away the\nappearances of life for me, it was to open my way to infinite\ndisillusionment, and unsuspected truths. Within a few weeks of our\nsecond meeting Mary and I were passionately in love with one another; we\nhad indeed become lovers. The arrested attractions of our former love\nreleased again, drew us inevitably to that. We tried to seem outwardly\nonly friends, with this hot glow between us. Our tormented secret was\nhalf discovered and half betrayed itself. There followed a tragi-comedy\nof hesitations and disunited struggle. Within four months the crisis of\nour two lives was past....\n\nIt is not within my purpose to tell you, my son, of the particular\nevents, the particular comings and goings, the chance words, the chance\nmeetings, the fatal momentary misunderstandings that occurred between\nus. I want to tell of something more general than that. This\nmisadventure is in our strain. It is our inheritance. It is a\npossibility in the inheritance of all honest and emotional men and\nwomen. There are no doubt people altogether cynical and adventurous to\nwhom these passions and desires are at once controllable and permissible\nindulgences without any radiation of consequences, a secret and\ndetachable part of life, and there may be people of convictions so\nstrong and simple that these disturbances are eliminated, but we\nStrattons are of a quality neither so low nor so high, we stoop and\nrise, we are not convinced about our standards, and for many\ngenerations to come, with us and with such people as the Christians, and\nindeed with most of our sort of people, we shall be equally desirous of\nfree and intimate friendship and prone to blaze into passion and\ndisaster at that proximity.\n\nThis is one of the essential riddles in the adaptation of such human\nbeings as ourselves to that greater civilized state of which I dream. It\nis the gist of my story. It is one of the two essential riddles that\nconfront our kind. The servitude of sex and the servitude of labor are\nthe twin conditions upon which human society rests to-day, the two\nlimitations upon its progress towards a greater social order, to that\ngreater community, those uplands of light and happy freedom, towards\nwhich that Being who was my father yesterday, who thinks in myself\nto-day, and who will be you to-morrow and your sons after you, by his\nvery nature urges and must continue to urge the life of mankind. The\nstory of myself and Mary is a mere incident in that gigantic, scarce\nconscious effort to get clear of toils and confusions and encumbrances,\nand have our way with life. We are like little figures, dots ascendant\nupon a vast hillside; I take up our intimacy for an instant and hold it\nunder a lens for you. I become more than myself then, and Mary stands\nfor innumerable women. It happened yesterday, and it is just a part of\nthat same history that made Edmond Stratton of the Hays elope with\nCharlotte Anstruther and get himself run through the body at Haddington\ntwo hundred years ago, which drove the Laidlaw-Christians to Virginia in\n'45, gave Stratton Street to the moneylenders when George IV. was\nRegent, and broke the heart of Margaret Stratton in the days when\nCharles the First was king. With our individual variations and under\nchanged conditions the old desires and impulses stirred us, the old\nantagonisms confronted us, the old difficulties and sloughs and\nimpassable places baffled us. There are times when I think of my history\namong all those widespread repeated histories, until it seems to me that\nthe human Lover is like a creature who struggles for ever through a\nthicket without an end....\n\nThere are no universal laws of affection and desire, but it is\nmanifestly true that for the most of us free talk, intimate association,\nand any real fellowship between men and women turns with an extreme\nreadiness to love. And that being so it follows that under existing\nconditions the unrestricted meeting and companionship of men and women\nin society is a monstrous sham, a merely dangerous pretence of\nencounters. The safe reality beneath those liberal appearances is that a\nwoman must be content with the easy friendship of other women and of one\nman only, letting a superficial friendship towards all other men veil\nimpassable abysses of separation, and a man must in the same way have\none sole woman intimate. To all other women he must be a little blind, a\nlittle deaf, politely inattentive. He must respect the transparent,\nintangible, tacit purdah about them, respect it but never allude to it.\nTo me that is an intolerable state of affairs, but it is reality. If you\nlive in the spirit of any other understanding you will court social\ndisaster. I suppose it is a particularly intolerable state of affairs to\nus Strattons because it is in our nature to want things to seem what\nthey are. That translucent yet impassible purdah outrages our veracity.\nAnd it is plain to me that our social order cannot stand and is not\nstanding the tensions it creates. The convention that passions and\nemotions are absent when they are palpably present broke down between\nMary and myself, as it breaks down in a thousand other cases, as it\nbreaks down everywhere. Our social life is honeycombed and rotten with\nsecret hidden relationships. The rigid, the obtuse and the\nunscrupulously cunning escape; the honest passion sooner or later flares\nout and destroys.... Here is a difficulty that no bullying imposition of\narbitrary rules on the one hand nor any reckless abandonment of law on\nthe other, can solve. Humanity has yet to find its method in sexual\nthings; it has to discover the use and the limitation of jealousy. And\nbefore it can even begin to attempt to find, it has to cease its present\ntimid secret groping in shame and darkness and turn on the light of\nknowledge. None of us knows much and most of us do not even know what is\nknown.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 8\n\nThe house is very quiet to-day. It is your mother's birthday, and you\nthree children have gone with her and Mademoiselle Potin into the forest\nto celebrate the occasion. Presently I shall join you. The sunlit\ngarden, with its tall dreaming lilies against the trellised vines upon\nthe wall, the cedars and the grassy space about the sundial, have that\ndistinguished stillness, that definite, palpable and almost outlined\nemptiness which is so to speak your negative presence. It is like a\nsheet of sunlit colored paper out of which your figures have been cut.\nThere is a commotion of birds in the jasmine, and your Barker reclines\nwith an infinite tranquillity, a masterless dog, upon the lawn. I take\nup this writing again after an interval of some weeks. I have been in\nParis, attending the Sabotage Conference, and dealing with those\nintricate puzzles of justice and discipline and the secret sources of\ncontentment that have to be solved if sabotage is ever to vanish from\nlabor struggles again. I think a few points have been made clearer in\nthat curious riddle of reconciliations....\n\nNow I resume this story. I turn over the sheets that were written and\nfinished before my departure, and come to the notes for what is to\nfollow.\n\nPerhaps my days of work in Paris have carried my mind on beyond the\npoint at which I left the narrative. I sit as it were among a pile of\nmemories that are now all disordered and mixed up together, their proper\nsequences and connexions lost. I cannot trace the phases through which\nour mutual passion rode up through the restrained and dignified\nintentions of our friendship. But I know that presently we were in a\nwhite heat of desire. There must have been passages that I now\naltogether forget, moments of tense transition. I am more and more\nconvinced that our swiftest, intensest, mental changes leave far less\nvivid memories than impressions one receives when one is comparatively\npassive. And of this phase in my life of which I am now telling I have\nclear memories of a time when we talked like brother and sister, or like\nangels if you will, and hard upon that came a time when we were planning\nin all our moments together how and when and where we might meet in\nsecret and meet again.\n\nThings drift with a phantom-like uncertainty into my mind and pass\nagain; those fierce motives of our transition have lost now all stable\nform and feature, but I believe there was a curious tormenting urgency\nin our jealousy of those others, of Justin on my part and of Rachel on\nhers. At first we had talked quite freely about Rachel, had discussed my\nconceivable marriage with her. We had indeed a little forced that topic,\nas if to reassure ourselves of the honesty of our new footing. But the\nforce that urged us nearer pervaded all our being. It was hard enough to\nbe barred apart, to snatch back our hands from touching, to avoid each\nother's eyes, to hurry a little out of the dusk towards the lit house\nand its protecting servants, but the constant presence and suggestion of\nthose others from whom there were no bars, or towards whom bars could be\nabolished at a look, at an impulse, exacerbated that hardship, roused a\nfierce insatiable spirit of revolt within us. At times we grew angry\nwith each other's formalism, came near to quarrelling....\n\nI associate these moods with the golden stillnesses of a prolonged and\nsultry autumn, and with slowly falling leaves....\n\nI will not tell you how that step was taken, it matters very little to\nmy story, nor will I tell which one of us it was first broke the\nbarriers down.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 9\n\nBut I do want to tell you certain things. I want to tell you them\nbecause they are things that affect you closely. There was almost from\nthe first a difference between Mary and myself in this, that I wanted to\nbe public about our love, I wanted to be open and defiant, and\nshe--hesitated. She wanted to be secret. She wanted to keep me; I\nsometimes think that she was moved to become my mistress because she\nwanted to keep me. But she also wanted to keep everything else in her\nlife,--her position, her ample freedoms and wealth and dignity. Our love\nwas to be a secret cavern, Endymion's cave. I was ready enough to do\nwhat I could to please her, and for a time I served that secrecy, lied,\npretended, agreed to false addresses, assumed names, and tangled myself\nin a net-work of furtive proceedings. These are things that poison and\nconsume honest love.\n\nYou will learn soon enough as you grow to be a man that beneath the\nrespectable assumptions of our social life there is an endless intricate\nworld of subterfuge and hidden and perverted passion,--for all passion\nthat wears a mask is perversion--and that thousands of people of our\nsort are hiding and shamming about their desires, their gratifications,\ntheir true relationships. I do not mean the open offenders, for they are\nmostly honest and gallant people, but the men and women who sin in the\nshadows, the people who are not clean and scandalous, but immoral and\nrespectable. This underworld is not for us. I wish that I who have\nlooked into it could in some way inoculate you now against the\nrepetition of my misadventure. We Strattons are daylight men, and if I\nwork now for widened facilities of divorce, for an organized freedom and\nindependence of women, and greater breadth of toleration, it is because\nI know in my own person the degradations, the falsity, the bitterness,\nthat can lurk beneath the inflexible pretentions of the established code\nto-day.\n\nAnd I want to tell you too of something altogether unforeseen that\nhappened to us, and that was this, that from the day that passion\ncarried us and we became in the narrower sense of the word lovers, all\nthe wider interests we had in common, our political intentions, our\nimpersonal schemes, began to pass out of our intercourse. Our situation\nclosed upon us like a trap and hid the sky. Something more intense had\nour attention by the feet, and we used our wings no more. I do not think\nthat we even had the real happiness and beauty and delight of one\nanother. Because, I tell you, there is no light upon kiss or embrace\nthat is not done with pride. I do not know why it should be so, but\npeople of our race and quality are a little ashamed of mere\ngratification in love. Always we seem in my memory to have been\nwhispering with flushed cheeks, and discussing\ninterminably--_situation_. Had something betrayed us, might something\nbetray, was this or that sufficiently cunning? Had we perhaps left a\nfootmark or failed to burn a note, was the second footman who was\ndetailed as my valet even now pausing astonished in the brushing of my\nclothes with our crumpled secret in his hand? Between myself and the\nclear vision of this world about me this infernal net-work of\nprecautions spread like a veil.\n\nAnd it was not only a matter of concealments but of positive deceptions.\nThe figure of Justin comes back to me. It is a curious thing that in\nspite of our bitter antagonism and the savage jealousy we were to feel\nfor one another, there has always been, and there remains now in my\nthought of him, a certain liking, a regret at our opposition, a quality\nof friendliness. His broad face, which the common impression and the\ncaricaturist make so powerful and eagle-like, is really not a brutal or\nheavy face at all. It is no doubt aquiline, after the fashion of an\neagle-owl, the mouth and chin broad and the eyes very far apart, but\nthere is a minute puckering of the brows which combines with that queer\nstreak of brown discoloration that runs across his cheek and into the\nwhite of his eyes, to give something faintly plaintive and pitiful to\nhis expression, an effect enhanced by the dark softness of his eyes.\nThey are gentle eyes; it is absurd to suppose them the eyes of a\nviolently forceful man. And indeed they do not belie Justin. It is not\nby vehemence or pressure that his wealth and power have been attained;\nit is by the sheer detailed abundance of his mind. In that queer big\nbrain of his there is something of the calculating boy and not a little\nof the chess champion; he has a kind of financial gift, he must be rich,\nand grows richer. What else is there for him to do? How many times have\nI not tried to glance carelessly at his face and scrutinize that look in\nhis eyes, and ask myself was that his usual look, or was it lit by an\ninstinctive jealousy? Did he perhaps begin to suspect? I had become a\npersistent visitor in the house, he might well be jealous of such minor\nfavors as she showed me, for with him she talked but little and shared\nno thoughts. His manner with her was tinctured by an habituated despair.\nThey were extraordinarily polite and friendly with one another....\n\nI tried a hundred sophistications of my treachery to him. I assured\nmyself that a modern woman is mistress and owner of herself; no chattel,\nand so forth. But he did not think so, and neither she nor I were\nbehaving as though we thought so. In innumerable little things we were\ndoing our best tacitly to reassure him. And so you see me shaking hands\nwith this man, affecting an interest in his topics and affairs, staying\nin his house, eating his food and drinking his wine, that I might be the\nnearer to his wife. It is not the first time that has been done in the\nworld, there are esoteric codes to justify all I did; I perceive there\nare types of men to whom such relationships are attractive by the very\nreason of their illicit excitement. But we Strattons are honest people,\nthere is no secretive passion in our blood; this is no game for us;\nnever you risk the playing of it, little son, big son as you will be\nwhen you read this story. Perhaps, but I hope indeed not, this may reach\nyou too late to be a warning, come to you in mid-situation. Go through\nwith it then, inheritor of mine, and keep as clean as you can, follow\nthe warped honor that is still left to you--and if you can, come out of\nthe tangle....\n\nIt is not only Justin haunts the memories of that furtive time, but\nRachel More. I see her still as she was then, a straight, white-dressed\ngirl with big brown eyes that regarded me now with perplexity, now with\na faint dismay. I still went over to see her, and my manner had changed.\nI had nothing to say to her now and everything to hide. Everything\nbetween us hung arrested, and nothing could occur to make an end.\n\nI told Mary I must cease my visits to the Mores. I tried to make her\nfeel my own sense of an accumulating cruelty to Rachel. \"But it explains\naway so much,\" she said. \"If you stop going there--everyone will talk.\nEverything will swing round--and point here.\"\n\n\"Rachel!\" I protested.\n\n\"No,\" she said, overbearing me, \"you must keep on going to Ridinghanger.\nYou must. You must.\" ...\n\nFor a long time I had said nothing to Mary of the burthen these\npretences were to me; it had seemed a monstrous ingratitude to find the\nslightest flaw in the passionate love and intimacy she had given me. But\nat last the divergence of our purposes became manifest to us both. A\ntime came when we perceived it clearly and discussed it openly. I have\nstill a vivid recollection of a golden October day when we had met at\nthe edge of the plantation that overlooks Bearshill. She had come\nthrough the gardens into the pine-wood, and I had jumped the rusty\nbanked stream that runs down the Bearshill valley, and clambered the\nbarbed wire fence. I came up the steep bank and through a fringe of\nfurze to where she stood in the shade; I kissed her hand, and discovered\nmine had been torn open by one of the thorns of the wire and was\ndripping blood. \"Mind my dress,\" she said, and we laughed as we kissed\nwith my arm held aloof.\n\nWe sat down side by side upon the warm pine needles that carpeted the\nsand, and she made a mothering fuss about my petty wound, and bound it\nin my handkerchief. We looked together across the steep gorge at the\nblue ridge of trees beyond. \"Anyone,\" she said, \"might have seen us this\nminute.\"\n\n\"I never thought,\" I said, and moved a foot away from her.\n\n\"It's too late if they have,\" said she, pulling me back to her. \"Over\nbeyond there, that must be Hindhead. Someone with a telescope----!\"\n\n\"That's less credible,\" I said. And it occurred to me that the grey\nstretch of downland beyond must be the ridge to the west of\nRidinghanger.\n\n\"I wish,\" I said, \"it didn't matter. I wish I could come and go and\nfear nobody--and spend long hours with you--oh! at our ease.\"\n\n\"Now,\" she said, \"we spend short hours. I wonder if I would like----\nIt's no good, Stephen, letting ourselves think of things that can't be.\nHere we are. Kiss that hand, my lover, there, just between wrist and\nthumb--the little hollow. Yes, exactly there.\"\n\nBut thoughts had been set going in my mind. \"Why,\" I said presently,\n\"should you always speak of things that can't be? Why should we take all\nthis as if it were all that there could be? I want long hours. I want\nyou to shine all the day through on my life. Now, dear, it's as if the\nsun was shown ever and again, and then put back behind an eclipse. I\ncome to you half-blinded, I go away unsatisfied. All the world is dark\nin between, and little phantom _yous_ float over it.\"\n\nShe rested her cheek on her hand and looked at me gravely.\n\n\"You are hard to satisfy, brother heart,\" she said.\n\n\"I live in snatches of brightness and all the rest of life is waiting\nand thinking and waiting.\"\n\n\"What else is there? Haven't we the brightness?\"\n\n\"I want you,\" I said. \"I want _you_ altogether.\"\n\n\"After so much?\"\n\n\"I want the more. Mary, I want you to come away with me. No, listen!\nthis life--don't think I'm not full of the beauty, the happiness, the\nwonder---- But it's a suspense. It doesn't go on. It's just a dawn,\ndear, a splendid dawn, a glory of color and brightness and freshness and\nhope, and--no sun rises. I want the day. Everything else has stopped\nwith me and stopped with you. I do nothing with my politics now,--I\npretend. I have no plans in life except plans for meeting you and again\nmeeting you. I want to go on, I want to go on with you and take up work\nand the world again--you beside me. I want you to come out of all this\nlife--out of all this immense wealthy emptiness of yours----\"\n\n\"Stop,\" she said, \"and listen to me, Stephen.\"\n\nShe paused with her lips pressed together, her brows a little knit.\n\n\"I won't,\" she said slowly. \"I am going on like this. I and you are\ngoing to be lovers--just as we are lovers now--secret lovers. And I am\ngoing to help you in all your projects, hold your party together--for\nyou will have a party--my house shall be its centre----\"\n\n\"But Justin----\"\n\n\"He takes no interest in politics. He will do what pleases me.\"\n\nI took some time before I answered. \"You don't understand how men feel,\"\nI said.\n\nShe waited for what else I had to say. I lay prone, and gathered\ntogether and shaped and reshaped a little heap of pine needles. \"You\nsee---- I can't do it. I want you.\"\n\nShe gripped a handful of my hair, and tugged hard between each word.\n\"Haven't you got me?\" she asked between her teeth. \"What more _could_\nyou have?\"\n\n\"I want you openly.\"\n\nShe folded her arms beneath her. \"_No_,\" she said.\n\nFor a little while neither of us spoke.\n\n\"It's the trouble of the deceit?\" she asked.\n\n\"It's--the deceit.\"\n\n\"We can stop all that,\" she said.\n\nI looked up at her face enquiringly.\n\n\"By having no more to hide,\" she said, with her eyes full of tears. \"If\nit's nothing to you----\"\n\n\"It's everything to me,\" I said. \"It's overwhelming me. Oh Mary, heart\nof my life, my dear, come out of this! Come with me, come and be my\nwife, make a clean thing of it! Let me take you away, and then let me\nmarry you. I know it's asking you--to come to a sort of poverty----\"\n\nBut Mary's blue eyes were alight with anger. \"Isn't it a clean thing\n_now_, Stephen?\" she was crying. \"Do you mean that you and I aren't\nclean now? Will you never understand?\"\n\n\"Oh clean,\" I answered, \"clean as Eve in the garden. But can we keep\nclean? Won't the shadow of our falsehoods darken at all? Come out of it\nwhile we are still clean. Come with me. Justin will divorce you. We can\nstay abroad and marry and come back.\"\n\nMary was kneeling up now with her hands upon her knees.\n\n\"Come back to what?\" she cried. \"Parliament?--after that? You _boy!_ you\nsentimentalist! you--you duffer! Do you think I'd let you do it for your\nown sake even? Do you think I want you--spoilt? We should come back to\nmope outside of things, we should come back to fret our lives out. I\nwon't do it, Stephen, I won't do it. End _this_ if you like, break our\nhearts and throw them away and go on without them, but to turn all our\nlives into a scandal, to give ourselves over to the mean and the\nmalicious, a prey to old women--and _you_ damned out of everything! A\nman partly forgiven! A man who went wrong for a woman! _No!_\"\n\nShe sprang lightly to her feet and stood over me as I knelt before her.\n\"And I came here to be made love to, Stephen! I came here to be loved!\nAnd you talk that nonsense! You remind me of everything--wretched!\"\n\nShe lifted up her hands and then struck down with them, a gesture of\ninfinite impatience. Her face as she bent to me was alive with a\nfriendly anger, her eyes suddenly dark. \"You _duffer_!\" she repeated....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 10\n\nDiscovery followed hard upon that meeting. I had come over to Martens\nwith some book as a pretext; the man had told me that Lady Mary awaited\nme in her blue parlor, and I went unannounced through the long gallery\nto find her. The door stood a little ajar, I opened it softly so that\nshe did not hear me, and saw her seated at her writing-desk with her\nback to me, and her cheek and eyebrow just touched by the sunlight from\nthe open terrace window. She was writing a note. I put my hand about her\nshoulder, and bent to kiss her as she turned. Then as she came round to\nme she started, was for a moment rigid, then thrust me from her and rose\nvery slowly to her feet.\n\nI turned to the window and became as rigid, facing Justin. He was\nstanding on the terrace, staring at us, with a face that looked stupid\nand inexpressive and--very white. The sky behind him, appropriately\nenough, was full of the tattered inky onset of a thunderstorm. So we\nremained for a lengthy second perhaps, a trite _tableau vivant_. We two\nseemed to hang helplessly upon Justin, and he was the first of us to\nmove.\n\nHe made a queer, incomplete gesture with one hand, as if he wanted to\nundo the top button of his waistcoat and then thought better of it. He\ncame very slowly into the room. When he spoke his voice had neither rage\nnor denunciation in it. It was simply conversational. \"I felt this was\ngoing on,\" he said. And then to his wife with the note of one who\nremarks dispassionately on a peculiar situation. \"Yet somehow it seemed\nwrong and unnatural to think such a thing of you.\"\n\nHis face took on something of the vexed look of a child who struggles\nwith a difficult task. \"Do you mind,\" he said to me, \"will you go?\"\n\nI took a moment for my reply. \"No,\" I said. \"Since you know at last----\nThere are things to be said.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mary, suddenly. \"Go! Let me talk to him.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"my place is here beside you.\"\n\nHe seemed not to hear me. His eyes were fixed on Mary. He seemed to\nthink he had dismissed me, and that I was no longer there. His mind was\nnot concerned about me, but about her. He spoke as though what he said\nhad been in his mind, and no doubt it had been in his mind, for many\ndays. \"I didn't deserve this,\" he said to her. \"I've tried to make your\nlife as you wanted your life. It's astonishing to find--I haven't. You\ngave no sign. I suppose I ought to have felt all this happening, but it\ncomes upon me surprisingly. I don't know what I'm to do.\" He became\naware of me again. \"And _you_!\" he said. \"What am I to do? To think that\nyou--while I have been treating her like some sacred thing....\"\n\nThe color was creeping back into his face. Indignation had come into\nhis voice, the first yellow lights of rising jealousy showed in his\neyes.\n\n\"Stephen,\" I heard Mary say, \"will you leave me to talk to my husband?\"\n\n\"There is only one thing to do,\" I said. \"What is the need of talking?\nWe two are lovers, Justin.\" I spoke to both of them. \"We two must go out\ninto the world, go out now together. This marriage of yours--it's no\nmarriage, no real marriage....\"\n\nI think I said that. I seem to remember saying that; perhaps with other\nphrases that I have forgotten. But my memory of what we said and did,\nwhich is so photographically clear of these earlier passages that I\nbelieve I can answer for every gesture and nearly every word that I have\nset down, becomes suddenly turbid. The high tension of our first\nconfrontation was giving place to a flood of emotional impulse. We all\nbecame eager to talk, to impose interpretations and justifications upon\nour situation. We all three became divided between our partial attention\nto one another and our urgent necessity to keep hold of our points of\nview. That I think is the common tragedy of almost all human conflicts,\nthat rapid breakdown from the first cool apprehension of an issue to\nheat, confusion, and insistence. I do not know if indeed we raised our\nvoices, but my memory has an effect of raised voices, and when at last I\nwent out of the house it seemed to me that the men-servants in the hall\nwere as hushed as beasts before a thunderstorm, and all of them quite\nfully aware of the tremendous catastrophe that had come to Martens. And\nmoreover, as I recalled afterwards with astonishment, I went past them\nand out into the driving rain unprotected, and not one of them stirred\na serviceable hand....\n\nWhat was it we said? I have a vivid sense of declaring not once only but\nseveral times that Mary and I were husband and wife \"in the sight of\nGod.\" I was full of the idea that now she must inevitably be mine. I\nmust have spoken to Justin at times as if he had come merely to confirm\nmy view of the long dispute there had been between us. For a while my\nmind resisted his extraordinary attitude that the matter lay between him\nand Mary, that I was in some way an interloper. It seemed to me there\nwas nothing for it now but that Mary should stand by my side and face\nJustin with the world behind him. I remember my confused sense that\npresently she and I would have to go straight out of Martens. And she\nwas wearing a tea-gown, easy and open, and the flimsiest of slippers.\nAny packing, any change of clothing, struck me as an incredible\nanti-climax. I had visions of our going forth, hand in hand. Outside was\nthe soughing of a coming storm, a chill wind drove a tumult of leaves\nalong the terrace, the door slammed and yawned open again, and then came\nthe rain. Justin, I remember, still talking, closed the door. I tried to\nthink how I could get to the station five miles away, and then what we\ncould do in London. We should seem rather odd visitors to an\nhotel--without luggage. All this was behind my valiant demand that she\nshould come with me, and come now.\n\nAnd then my mind was lanced by the thin edge of realization that she did\nnot intend to come now, and that Justin was resolved she should not do\nso. After the first shock of finding herself discovered she had stood\npale but uncowed before her bureau, with her eyes rather on him than on\nme. Her hands, I think, were behind her upon the edge of the writing\nflap, and she was a little leaning upon them. She had the watchful alert\nexpression of one who faces an unanticipated but by no means\noverwhelming situation. She cast a remark to me. \"But I do not want to\ncome with you,\" she said. \"I have told you I do not want to come with\nyou.\" All her mind seemed concentrated upon what she should do with\nJustin. \"You must send him away,\" he was saying. \"It's an abominable\nthing. It must stop. How can you dream it should go on?\"\n\n\"But you said when you married me I should be free, I should own myself!\nYou gave me this house----\"\n\n\"What! To disgrace myself!\"\n\nI was moved to intervene.\n\n\"You must choose between us, Mary,\" I cried. \"It is impossible you\nshould stay here! You cannot stay here.\"\n\nShe turned upon me, a creature at bay. \"Why shouldn't I stay here? Why\nmust I choose between two men? I want neither of you. I want myself. I'm\nnot a thing. I'm a human being. I'm not your thing, Justin--nor yours,\nStephen. Yet you want to quarrel over me--like two dogs over a bone. I\nam going to stay here--in my house! It's my house. I made it. Every room\nof it is full of me. Here I am!\"\n\nShe stood there making this magnificently extravagant claim; her eyes\nblazing blue, her hair a little dishevelled with a strand across her\ncheek.\n\nBoth I and Justin spoke together, and then turned in helpless anger upon\none another. I remember that with the clumsiest of weak gestures he bade\nme begone from the house, and that I with a now rather deflated\nrhetoric answered I would go only with Mary at my side. And there she\nstood, less like a desperate rebel against the most fundamental social\nrelations than an indignant princess, and demanded of us and high\nheaven, \"Why should I be fought for? Why should I be fought for?\"\n\nAnd then abruptly she gathered her skirts in her hand and advanced.\n\"Open that door, Stephen,\" she said, and was gone with a silken whirl\nand rustle from our presence.\n\nWe were left regarding one another with blank expressions.\n\nHer departure had torn the substance out of our dispute. For the moment\nwe found ourselves left with a new situation for which there is as yet\nno tradition of behavior. We had become actors in that new human comedy\nthat is just beginning in the world, that comedy in which men still\ndispute the possession and the manner of the possession of woman\naccording to the ancient rules, while they on their side are determining\never more definitely that they will not be possessed....\n\nWe had little to say to one another,--mere echoes and endorsements of\nour recent declarations. \"She must come to me,\" said I. And he, \"I will\nsave her from that at any cost.\"\n\nThat was the gist of our confrontation, and then I turned about and\nwalked along the gallery towards the entrance, with Justin following me\nslowly. I was full of the wrath of baffled heroics; I turned towards him\nwith something of a gesture. Down the perspective of the white and empty\ngallery he appeared small and perplexed. The panes of the tall French\nwindows were slashed with rain....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 11\n\nI forget now absolutely what I may have expected to happen next. I\ncannot remember my return to my father's house that day. But I know that\nwhat did happen was the most unanticipated and incredible experience of\nmy life. It was as if the whole world of mankind were suddenly to turn\nupside down and people go about calmly in positions of complete\ninversion. I had a note from Mary on the morning after this discovery\nthat indeed dealt with that but was otherwise not very different from\nendless notes I had received before our crisis. It was destroyed, so\nthat I do not know its exact text now, but it did not add anything\nmaterial to the situation, or give me the faintest shadow to intimate\nwhat crept close upon us both. She repeated her strangely thwarting\nrefusal to come away and live with me. She seemed indignant that we had\nbeen discovered--as though Justin had indulged in an excess of existence\nby discovering us. I completed and despatched to her a long letter I had\nalready been writing overnight in which I made clear the hopeless\nimpossibility of her attitude, vowed all my life and strength to her,\ntried to make some picture of the happiness that was possible for us\ntogether, sketched as definitely as I could when and where we might meet\nand whither we might go. It must have made an extraordinary jumble of\nprotest, persuasion and practicality. It never reached her; it was\nintercepted by Justin.\n\nI have gathered since that after I left Martens he sent telegrams to Guy\nand Philip and her cousin Lord Tarvrille. He was I think amazed beyond\nmeasure at this revelation of the possibilities of his cold and distant\nwife, with a vast passion of jealousy awaking in him, and absolutely\nincapable of forming any plan to meet the demands of his extraordinary\nsituation. Guy and Philip got to him that night, Tarvrille came down\nnext morning, and Martens became a debate. Justin did not so much\nexpress views and intentions as have them extracted from him; it was\nmanifest he was prepared for the amplest forgiveness of his wife if only\nI could be obliterated from their world. Confronted with her brothers,\nthe two men in the world who could be frankly brutal to her, Mary's\ndignity suffered; she persisted she meant to go on seeing me, but she\nwas reduced to passionate tears.\n\nInto some such state of affairs I came that morning on the heels of my\nletter, demanding Lady Mary of a scared evasive butler.\n\nMaxton and Tarvrille appeared: \"Hullo, Stratton!\" said Tarvrille, with a\nfine flavor of an agreeable chance meeting. Philip had doubts about his\ngreeting me, and then extended his reluctant hand with a nervous grin to\nexcuse the delay.\n\n\"I want to see Lady Mary,\" said I, stiffly.\n\n\"She's not up yet,\" said Tarvrille, with a hand on my shoulder. \"Come\nand have a talk in the garden.\"\n\nWe went out with Tarvrille expanding the topic of the seasons. \"It's a\ndamned good month, November, say what you like about it.\" Philip walked\ngrimly silent on my other hand.\n\n\"And it's a damned awkward situation you've got us into, Stratton,\" said\nTarvrille, \"say what you like about it.\"\n\n\"It isn't as though old Justin was any sort of beast,\" he reflected,\n\"or anything like that, you know. He's a most astonishing decent chap,\nclean as they make them.\"\n\n\"This isn't a beastly intrigue,\" I said.\n\n\"It never is,\" said Tarvrille genially.\n\n\"We've loved each other a long time. It's just flared out here.\"\n\n\"No doubt of that,\" said Tarvrille. \"It's been like a beacon to all\nSurrey.\"\n\n\"It's one of those cases where things have to be readjusted. The best\nthing to do is for Mary and me to go abroad----\"\n\n\"Yes, but does Mary think so?\"\n\n\"Look here!\" said Philip in a voice thick with rage. \"I won't have Mary\ndivorced. I won't. See? I won't.\"\n\n\"What the devil's it got to do with _you_?\" I asked with an answering\nflash of fury.\n\nTarvrille's arm ran through mine. \"Nobody's going to divorce Mary,\" he\nsaid reassuringly. \"Not even Justin. He doesn't want to, and nobody else\ncan, and there you are!\"\n\n\"But we two----\"\n\n\"You two have had a tremendously good time. You've got found out--and\nthere you are!\"\n\n\"This thing has got to stop absolutely now,\" said Philip and echoed with\na note of satisfaction in his own phrasing, \"absolutely _now_.\"\n\n\"You see, Stratton,\" said Tarvrille as if he were expanding Philip's\nassertion, \"there's been too many divorces in society. It's demoralizing\npeople. It's discrediting us. It's setting class against class.\nEverybody is saying why don't these big people either set about\nrespecting the law or altering it. Common people are getting too\ninfernally clear-headed. Hitherto it's mattered so little.... But we\ncan't stand any more of it, Stratton, now. It's something more than a\nprivate issue; it's a question of public policy. We can't stand any more\ndivorces.\"\n\nHe reflected. \"We have to consider something more than our own personal\ninclinations. We've got no business to be here at all if we're not a\nresponsible class. We owe something--to ourselves.\"\n\nIt was as if Tarvrille was as concerned as I was for this particular\ndivorce, as if he struggled with a lively desire to see me and Mary\nhappily married after the shortest possible interval. And indeed he\nmanifestly wasn't unsympathetic; he had the strongest proclivity for the\nromantic and picturesque, and it was largely the romantic\npicturesqueness of renunciation that he urged upon me. Philip for the\nmost part maintained a resentful silence; he was a clenched anger\nagainst me, against Mary, against the flaming possibilities that\nthreatened the sister of Lord Maxton, that most promising and\ndistinguished young man.\n\nOf course their plans must have been definitely made before this talk,\nprobably they had made them overnight, and probably it was Tarvrille had\ngiven them a practicable shape, but he threw over the whole of our talk\nso satisfying a suggestion of arrest and prolonged discussion that it\nnever occurred to me that I should not be able to come again on the\nmorrow and renew my demand to see Mary. Even when next day I turned my\nface to Martens and saw the flag had vanished from the flagstaff, it\nseemed merely a token of that household's perturbation. I thought the\nhouse looked oddly blank and sleepy as I drew near, but I did not\nperceive that this was because all the blinds were drawn. The door upon\nthe lawn was closed, and presently the butler came to open it. He was in\nan old white jacket, and collarless. \"Lady Mary!\" he said. \"Lady Mary\nhas gone, sir. She and Mr. Justin went yesterday after you called.\"\n\n\"Gone!\" said I. \"But where?\"\n\n\"I _think_ abroad, sir.\"\n\n\"Abroad!\"\n\n\"I _think_ abroad.\"\n\n\"But---- They've left an address?\"\n\n\"Only to Mr. Justin's office,\" said the man. \"Any letters will be\nforwarded from there.\"\n\nI paused upon the step. He remained stiffly deferential, but with an air\nof having disposed of me. He reproved me tacitly for forgetting that I\nought to conceal my astonishment at this disappearance. He was indeed an\nadmirable man-servant. \"Thank you,\" said I, and dropped away defeated\nfrom the door.\n\nI went down the broad steps, walked out up the lawn, and surveyed house\nand trees and garden and sky. To the heights and the depths and the\nuttermost, I knew now what it was to be amazed....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 12\n\nI had felt myself an actor in a drama, and now I had very much the\nfeeling an actor would have who answers to a cue and finds himself in\nmid-stage with the scenery and the rest of the cast suddenly vanished\nbehind him. By that mixture of force and persuasion which avails itself\nof a woman's instinctive and cultivated dread of disputes and raised\nvoices and the betrayal of contention to strangers, by the sheer tiring\ndown of nerves and of sleepless body and by threats of an immediate\ndivorce and a campaign of ruin against me, these three men had obliged\nMary to leave Martens and go with them to Southampton, and thence they\ntook her in Justin's yacht, the _Water-Witch_, to Waterford, and thence\nby train to a hired house, an adapted old castle at Mirk near Crogham in\nMayo. There for all practical purposes she was a prisoner. They took\naway her purse, and she was four miles from a pillar-box and ten from a\ntelegraph office. This house they had taken furnished without seeing it\non the recommendation of a London agent, and in the name of Justin's\nsolicitor. Thither presently went Lady Ladislaw, and an announcement\nappeared in the _Times_ that Justin and Lady Mary had gone abroad for a\ntime and that no letters would be forwarded.\n\nI have never learnt the particulars of that abduction, but I imagine\nMary astonished, her pride outraged, humiliated, helpless, perplexed and\nmaintaining a certain outward dignity. Moreover, as I was presently to\nbe told, she was ill. Guy and Philip were, I believe, the moving spirits\nin the affair; Tarvrille was their apologetic accomplice, Justin took\nthe responsibility for what they did and bore the cost, he was bitterly\nashamed to have these compulsions applied to his wife, but full now of a\ngusty fury against myself. He loved Mary still with a love that was\nshamed and torn and bleeding, but his ruling passion was that infinitely\nstronger passion than love in our poor human hearts, jealousy. He was\nprepared to fight for her now as men fight for a flag, tearing it to\npieces in the struggle. He meant now to keep Mary. That settled, he was\nprepared to consider whether he still loved her or she him....\n\nNow here it may seem to you that we are on the very verge of romance.\nHere is a beautiful lady carried off and held prisoner in a wild old\nplace, standing out half cut off from the mainland among the wintry\nbreakers of the west coast of Ireland. Here is the lover, baffled but\ninsistent. Here are the fierce brothers and the stern dragon husband,\nand you have but to make out that the marriage was compulsory, irregular\nand, on the ground of that irregularity, finally dissoluble, to furnish\nforth a theme for Marriott Watson in his most admirable and adventurous\nvein. You can imagine the happy chances that would have guided me to the\nhiding-place, the trusty friend who would have come with me and told the\nstory, the grim siege of the place--all as it were _sotto voce_ for fear\nof scandal--the fight with Guy in the little cave, my attempted\nassassination, the secret passage. Would to heaven life had those rich\nsimplicities, and one could meet one's man at the end of a sword! My\nsiege of Mirk makes a very different story from that.\n\nIn the first place I had no trusted friend of so extravagant a\nfriendship as such aid would demand. I had no one whom it seemed\npermissible to tell of our relations. I was not one man against three or\nfour men in a romantic struggle for a woman. I was one man against\nsomething infinitely greater than that, I was one man against nearly all\nmen, one man against laws, traditions, instincts, institutions, social\norder. Whatever my position had been before, my continuing pursuit of\nMary was open social rebellion. And I was in a state of extreme\nuncertainty how far Mary was a willing agent in this abrupt\ndisappearance. I was disposed to think she had consented far more than\nshe had done to this astonishing step. Carrying off an unwilling woman\nwas outside my imaginative range. It was luminously clear in my mind\nthat so far she had never countenanced the idea of flight with me, and\nuntil she did I was absolutely bound to silence about her. I felt that\nuntil I saw her face to face again, and was sure she wanted me to\nrelease her, that prohibition held. Yet how was I to get at her and hear\nwhat she had to say? Clearly it was possible that she was under\nrestraint, but I did not know; I was not certain, I could not prove it.\nAt Guildford station I gathered, after ignominious enquiries, that the\nJustins had booked to London. I had two days of nearly frantic\ninactivity at home, and then pretended business that took me to London,\nfor fear that I should break out to my father. I came up revolving a\ndozen impossible projects of action in my mind. I had to get into touch\nwith Mary, at that my mind hung and stopped. All through the twenty-four\nhours my nerves jumped at every knock upon my door; this might be the\nletter, this might be the telegram, this might be herself escaped and\ncome to me. The days passed like days upon a painful sick-bed, grey or\nfoggy London days of an appalling length and emptiness. If I sat at home\nmy imagination tortured me; if I went out I wanted to be back and see if\nany communication had come. I tried repeatedly to see Tarvrille. I had\nan idea of obtaining a complete outfit for an elopement, but I was\nrestrained by my entire ignorance of what a woman may need. I tried to\nequip myself for a sudden crisis by the completest preparation of every\npossible aspect. I did some absurd and ill-advised things. I astonished\na respectable solicitor in a grimy little office behind a queer little\ncourt with trees near Cornhill, by asking him to give advice to an\nanonymous client and then putting my anonymous case before him.\n\"Suppose,\" said I, \"it was for the plot of a play.\" He nodded gravely.\n\nMy case as I stated it struck me as an unattractive one.\n\n\"Application for a Writ of Habeas Corpus,\" he considered with eyes that\ntried to remain severely impartial, \"by a Wife's Lover, who wants to\nfind out where she is.... It's unusual. You will be requiring the\nhusband to produce her Corpus.... I don't think--speaking in the same\ngeneral terms as those in which you put the circumstances, it would be\nlikely to succeed.... No.\"\n\nThen I overcame a profound repugnance and went to a firm of private\ndetectives. It had occurred to me that if I could have Justin,\nTarvrille, Guy or Philip traced I might get a clue to Mary's\nhiding-place. I remember a queer little office, a blusterous,\nfrock-coated creature with a pock-marked face, iron-grey hair, an\neyeglass and a strained tenor voice, who told me twice that he was a\ngentleman and several times that he would prefer not to do business than\nto do it in an ungentlemanly manner, and who was quite obviously ready\nand eager to blackmail either side in any scandal into which spite or\nweakness admitted his gesticulating fingers. He alluded vaguely to his\nstaff, to his woman helpers, \"some personally attached to me,\" to his\nremarkable underground knowledge of social life--\"the illicit side.\"\nWhat could he do for me? There was nothing, I said, illicit about me.\nHis interest waned a little. I told him that I was interested in\ncertain financial matters, no matter what they were, and that I wanted\nto have a report of the movements of Justin and his brothers-in-law for\nthe past few weeks and for a little time to come. \"You want them\nwatched?\" said my private enquiry agent, leaning over the desk towards\nme and betraying a slight squint. \"Exactly,\" said I. \"I want to know\nwhat sort of things they are looking at just at present.\"\n\n\"Have you any inkling----?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"If our agents have to travel----\"\n\nI expressed a reasonable generosity in the matter of expenses, and left\nhim at last with a vague discomfort in my mind. How far mightn't this\nundesirable unearth the whole business in the course of his\ninvestigations? And then what could he do? Suppose I went back forthwith\nand stopped his enquiries before they began! I had a disagreeable\nfeeling of meanness that I couldn't shake off; I felt I was taking up a\nweapon that Justin didn't deserve. Yet I argued with myself that the\nabduction of Mary justified any such course.\n\nAs I was still debating this I saw Philip. He was perhaps twenty yards\nahead of me, he was paying off a hansom which had just put him down\noutside Blake's. \"Philip,\" I cried, following him up the steps and\novertaking him and seizing his arm as the commissionaire opened the door\nfor him. \"Philip! What have you people done with Mary? Where is Mary?\"\n\nHe turned a white face to me. \"How dare you,\" he said with a catch of\nthe breath, \"mention my sister?\"\n\nI spoke in an undertone, and stepped a little between him and the man at\nthe door in order that the latter might not hear what I said. \"I want\nto see her,\" I expostulated. \"I _must_ see her. What you are doing is\nnot playing the game. I've _got_ to see her.\"\n\n\"Let go of my arm, sir!\" cried he, and suddenly I felt a whirlwind of\nrage answering the rage in his eyes. The pent-up exasperation of three\nweeks rushed to its violent release. He struck me in the face with the\nhand that was gripped about his umbrella. He meant to strike me in the\nface and then escape into his club, but before he could get away from me\nafter his blow I had flung out at him, and had hit him under the\njawbone. My blow followed his before guard or counter was possible. I\nhit with all my being. It was an amazing flare up of animal passion;\nfrom the moment that I perceived he was striking at me to the moment\nwhen both of us came staggering across the door-mat into the dignified\nand spacious hall-way of Blake's, we were back at the ancestral ape, and\nwe did exactly what the ancestral ape would have done. The arms of the\ncommissionaire about my waist, the rush of the astonished porter from\nhis little glass box, two incredibly startled and delighted pages, and\nan intervening member bawling out \"Sir! Sir!\" converged to remind us\nthat we were a million years or so beyond those purely arboreal days....\n\nWe seemed for a time to be confronted before an audience that hesitated\nto interfere. \"How dare you name my sister to me?\" he shouted at me, and\nbrought to my mind the amazing folly of which he was capable. I\nperceived Mary's name flung to the four winds of heaven.\n\n\"You idiot, Philip!\" I cried. \"I don't _know_ your sister. I've not seen\nher--scarcely seen her for years. I ask you--I ask you for a match-box\nor something and you hit me.\"\n\n\"If you dare to speak to her----!\"\n\n\"You fool!\" I cried, going nearer to him and trying to make him\nunderstand. But he winced and recoiled defensively. \"I'm sorry,\" I said\nto the commissionaire who was intervening. \"Lord Maxton has made a\nmistake.\"\n\n\"Is he a member?\" said someone in the background, and somebody else\nsuggested calling a policeman. I perceived that only a prompt retreat\nwould save the whole story of our quarrel from the newspapers. So far as\nI could see nobody knew me there except Philip. I had to take the risks\nof his behavior; manifestly I couldn't control it. I made no further\nattempt to explain anything to anybody. Everyone was a little too\nperplexed for prompt action, and so the advantage in that matter lay\nwith me. I walked through the door, and with what I imagined to be an\nappearance of the utmost serenity down the steps. I noted an ascending\nmember glance at me with an expression of exceptional interest, but it\nwas only after I had traversed the length of Pall Mall that I realized\nthat my lip and the corner of my nostril were both bleeding profusely. I\ncalled a cab when I discovered my handkerchief scarlet, and retreated to\nmy flat and cold ablutions. Then I sat down to write a letter to\nTarvrille, with a clamorous \"Urgent, Please forward if away\" above the\naddress, and tell him at least to suppress Philip. But within the club\nthat blockhead, thinking of nothing but the appearances of our fight and\nhis own credit, was varying his assertion that he had thrashed me, with\ndenunciations of me as a \"blackguard,\" and giving half a dozen men a\nhighly colored, improvised, and altogether improbable account of my\nrelentless pursuit and persecution of Lady Mary Justin, and how she had\nleft London to avoid me. They listened, no doubt, with extreme avidity.\nThe matrimonial relations of the Justins had long been a matter for\nspeculative minds.\n\nAnd while Philip was doing this, Guy, away in Mayo still, was writing a\ntender, trusting, and all too explicit letter to a well-known and\nextremely impatient lady in London to account for his continued absence\nfrom her house. \"So that is it!\" said the lady, reading, and was at\nleast in the enviable position of one who had confirmatory facts to\nimpart....\n\nAnd so quite suddenly the masks were off our situation and we were open\nto an impertinent world. For some days I did not realize what had\nhappened, and lived in hope that Philip had been willing and able to\ncover his lapse. I went about with my preoccupation still, as I\nimagined, concealed, and with an increasing number of typed letters from\nmy private enquiry agent in my pocket containing inaccurate and\nworthless information about the movements of Justin, which appeared to\nhave been culled for the most part from a communicative young policeman\nstationed at the corner nearest to the Justins' house, or expanded from\n_Who's Who_ and other kindred works of reference. The second letter, I\nremember, gave some particulars about the financial position of the\nyounger men, and added that Justin's credit with the west-end tradesmen\nwas \"limitless,\" points upon which I had no sort of curiosity\nwhatever....\n\nI suppose a couple of hundred people in London knew before I did that\nLady Mary Justin had been carried off to Ireland and practically\nimprisoned there by her husband because I was her lover. The thing\nreached me at last through little Fred Riddling, who came to my rooms in\nthe morning while I was sitting over my breakfast. \"Stratton!\" said he,\n\"what is all this story of your shaking Justin by the collar, and\nthreatening to kill him if he didn't give up his wife to you? And why do\nyou want to fight a duel with Maxton? What's it all about? Fire-eater\nyou must be! I stood up for you as well as I could, but I heard you\nabused for a solid hour last night, and there was a chap there simply\nsquirting out facts and dates and names. Got it all.... What have you\nbeen up to?\"\n\nHe stood on my hearthrug with an air of having called for an explanation\nto which he was entitled, and he very nearly got one. But I just had\nsome scraps of reserve left, and they saved me. \"Tell me first,\" I said,\ndelaying myself with the lighting of a cigarette, \"the particulars ...\nas you heard them.\"\n\nRiddling embarked upon a descriptive sketch, and I got a minute or so to\nthink.\n\n\"Go on,\" I said with a note of irony, when he paused. \"Go on. Tell me\nsome more. Where did you say they have taken her; let us have it right.\"\n\nBy the time his little store had run out I knew exactly what to do with\nhim. \"Riddling,\" said I, and stood up beside him suddenly and dropped my\nhand with a little added weight upon his shoulder, \"Riddling, do you\nknow the only right and proper thing to do when you hear scandal about a\nfriend?\"\n\n\"Come straight to him,\" said Riddling virtuously, \"as I have done.\"\n\n\"No. Say you don't believe it. Ask the scandal-monger how he knows and\ninsist on his telling you--insist. And if he won't--be very, very rude\nto him. Insist up to the quarrelling point. Now who were those people?\"\n\n\"Well--that's a bit stiff.... One chap I didn't know at all.\"\n\n\"You should have pulled him up and insisted upon knowing who he was, and\nwhat right he had to lie about me. For it's lying, Riddling. Listen! It\nisn't true that I'm besieging Lady Mary Justin. So far from besieging\nher I didn't even know where she was until you told me. Justin is a\nneighbor of my father's and a friend of mine. I had tea with him and his\nwife not a month ago. I had tea with them together. I knew they were\ngoing away, but it was a matter of such slight importance to me, such\nslight importance\"--I impressed this on his collarbone--\"that I was left\nwith the idea that they were going to the south of France. I believe\nthey are in the south of France. And there you are. I'm sorry to spoil\nsport, but that's the bleak unromantic truth of the matter.\"\n\n\"You mean to say that there is nothing in it all?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nHe was atrociously disappointed. \"But everybody,\" he said, \"everybody\nhas got something.\"\n\n\"Somebody will get a slander case if this goes on. I don't care what\nthey've got.\"\n\n\"Good Lord!\" he said, and stared at the rug. \"You'll take your oath----\"\nHe glanced up and met my eye. \"Oh, of course it's all right what you\nsay.\" He was profoundly perplexed. He reflected. \"But then, I say\nStratton, why did you go for Maxton at Blake's? _That_ I had from an\neye-witness. You can't deny a scrap like that--in broad daylight. Why\ndid you do that?\"\n\n\"Oh _that's_ it,\" said I. \"I begin to have glimmerings. There's a little\nmatter between myself and Maxton....\" I found it a little difficult to\nimprovise a plausible story.\n\n\"But he said it was his sister,\" persisted Riddling. \"He said so\nafterwards, in the club.\"\n\n\"Maxton,\" said I, losing my temper, \"is a fool and a knave and a liar.\nHis sister indeed! Lady Mary! If he can't leave his sister out of this\nbusiness I'll break every bone of his body.\" ... I perceived my temper\nwas undoing me. I invented rapidly but thinly. \"As a matter of fact,\nRiddling, it's quite another sort of lady has set us by the ears.\"\n\nRiddling stuck his chin out, tucked in the corners of his mouth, made\nround eyes at the breakfast things and, hands in pockets, rocked from\nheels to toes and from toes to heels. \"I see Stratton, yes, I see. Yes,\nall this makes it very plain, of course. Very plain.... Stupid thing,\nscandal is.... Thanks! no, I won't have a cigarette.\"\n\nAnd he left me presently with an uncomfortable sense that he did see,\nand didn't for one moment intend to restrain his considerable histrionic\nskill in handing on his vision to others. For some moments I stood\nsavoring this all too manifest possibility, and then my thoughts went\nswirling into another channel. At last the curtain was pierced. I was no\nlonger helplessly in the dark. I got out my Bradshaw, and sat with the\nmap spread out over the breakfast things studying the routes to Mayo.\nThen I rang for Williams, the man I shared with the two adjacent\nflat-holders, and told him to pack my kit-bag because I was suddenly\ncalled away.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 13\n\nMany of the particulars of my journey to Ireland have faded out of my\nmind altogether. I remember most distinctly my mood of grim elation that\nat last I had to deal with accessible persons again....\n\nThe weather was windy and violent, and I was sea-sick for most of the\ncrossing, and very tired and exhausted when I landed. Williams had\nthought of my thick over-coat and loaded me with wraps and rugs, and I\nsat in the corner of a compartment in that state of mental and bodily\nfatigue that presses on the brows like a painless headache. I got to\nsome little junction at last where I had to wait an hour for a\nbranch-line train. I tasted all the bitterness of Irish hospitality, and\nsuch coffee as Ireland alone can produce. Then I went on to a station\ncalled Clumber or Clumboye, or some such name, and thence after some\ndifficulty I got a car for my destination. It was a wretched car in\nwhich hens had been roosting, and it was drawn by a steaming horse that\nhad sores under its mended harness.\n\nAn immense wet wind was blowing as we came over the big hill that lies\nto the south of Mirk. Everything was wet, the hillside above me was\neither intensely green sodden turf or great streaming slabs of\nlimestone, seaward was a rocky headland, a ruin of a beehive shape, and\nbeyond a vast waste of tumbling waters unlit by any sun. Not a tree\nbroke that melancholy wilderness, nor any living thing but ourselves.\nThe horse went stumblingly under the incessant stimulation of the\ndriver's lash and tongue....\n\n\"Yonder it is,\" said my man, pointing with his whip, and I twisted\nround to see over his shoulder, not the Rhine-like castle I had\nexpected, but a long low house of stone upon a headland, backed by a\ndistant mountain that vanished in a wild driven storm of rain as I\nlooked. But at the sight of Mirk my lassitude passed, my nerves\ntightened, and my will began to march again. Now, thought I, we bring\nthings to an issue. Now we come to something personal and definite. The\nvagueness is at an end. I kept my eyes upon the place, and thought it\nmore and more like a prison as we drew nearer. Perhaps from that window\nMary was looking for me now. Had she wondered why I did not come to her\nbefore? Now at any rate I had found her. I sprang off the car, found a\nbell-handle, and set the house jangling.\n\nThe door opened, and a little old man appeared with his fingers thrust\ninside his collar as though he were struggling against strangulation. He\nregarded me for a second, and spoke before I could speak.\n\n\"What might you be wanting?\" said he, as if he had an answer ready.\n\n\"I want to see Lady Mary Justin,\" I said.\n\n\"You can't,\" he said. \"She's gone.\"\n\n\"Gone!\"\n\n\"The day before yesterday she went to London. You'll have to be getting\nback there.\"\n\n\"She's gone to London.\"\n\n\"No less.\"\n\n\"Willingly?\"\n\nThe little old man struggled with his collar. \"Anyone would go\nwillingly,\" he said, and seemed to await my further commands. He eyed me\nobliquely with a shadow of malice in his eyes.\n\nIt was then my heart failed, and I knew that we lovers were beaten. I\nturned from the door without another word to the janitor. \"Back,\" said I\nto my driver, and got up behind him.\n\nBut it is one thing to decide to go back, and another to do it. At the\nlittle station I studied time-tables, and I could not get to England\nagain without a delay of half a day. Somewhere I must wait. I did not\nwant to wait where there was any concourse of people. I decided to stay\nin the inn by the station for the intervening six hours, and get some\nsleep before I started upon my return, but when I saw the bedroom I\nchanged my plan and went down out of the village by a steep road towards\nthe shore. I wandered down through the rain and spindrift to the very\nedge of the sea, and there found a corner among the rocks a little\nsheltered from the wind, and sat, inert and wretched; my lips salt, my\nhair stiff with salt, and my body wet and cold; a miserable defeated\nman. For I had now an irrational and entirely overwhelming conviction of\ndefeat. I saw as if I ought always to have seen that I had been pursuing\na phantom of hopeless happiness, that my dream of ever possessing Mary\nagain was fantastic and foolish, and that I had expended all my strength\nin vain. Over me triumphed a law and tradition more towering than those\ncliffs and stronger than those waves. I was overwhelmed by a sense of\nhuman weakness, of the infinite feebleness of the individual man against\nwind and wave and the stress of tradition and the ancient usages of\nmankind. \"We must submit,\" I whispered, crouching close, \"we must\nsubmit.\" ...\n\nFar as the eye could reach the waves followed one another in long\nunhurrying lines, an inexhaustible succession, rolling, hissing,\nbreaking, and tossing white manes of foam, to gather at last for a\ncrowning effort and break thunderously, squirting foam two hundred feet\nup the streaming faces of the cliffs. The wind tore and tugged at me,\nand wind and water made together a clamor as though all the evil voices\nin the world, all the violent passions and all the hasty judgments were\nseeking a hearing above the more elemental uproar....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 14\n\nAnd while I was in this phase of fatigue and despair in Mayo, the scene\nwas laid and all the other actors were waiting for the last act of my\ndefeat in London. I came back to find two letters from Mary and a little\naccumulation of telegrams and notes, one written in my flat, from\nTarvrille.\n\nMary's letters were neither of them very long, and full of a new-born\ndespair. She had not realized how great were the forces against her and\nagainst us both. She let fall a phrase that suggested she was ill. She\nhad given in, she said, to save herself and myself and others from the\nshame and ruin of a divorce, and I must give in too. We had to agree not\nto meet or communicate for three years, and I was to go out of England.\nShe prayed me to accept this. She knew, she said, she seemed to desert\nme, but I did not know everything,--I did not know everything,--I must\nagree; she could not come with me; it was impossible. _Now_ certainly it\nwas impossible. She had been weak, but I did not know all. If I knew all\nI should be the readier to understand and forgive her, but it was part\nof the conditions that I could not know all. Justin had been generous,\nin his way.... Justin had everything in his hands, the whole world was\nbehind him against us, and I must give in. Those letters had a quality I\nhad never before met in her, they were broken-spirited. I could not\nunderstand them fully, and they left me perplexed, with a strong desire\nto see her, to question her, to learn more fully what this change in her\nmight mean.\n\nTarvrille's notes recorded his repeated attempts to see me, I felt that\nhe alone was capable of clearing up things for me, and I went out again\nat once and telegraphed to him for an appointment.\n\nHe wired to me from that same house in Mayfair in which I had first met\nMary after my return. He asked me to come to him in the afternoon, and\nthither I went through a November fog, and found him in the drawing-room\nthat had the plate glass above the fireplace. But now he was vacating\nthe house, and everything was already covered up, the pictures and their\nframes were under holland, the fine furniture all in covers of faded\nstuff, the chandeliers and statues wrapped up, the carpets rolled out of\nthe way. Even the window-curtains were tucked into wrappers, and the\nblinds, except one he had raised, drawn down. He greeted me and\napologized for the cold inhospitality of the house. \"It was convenient\nhere,\" he said. \"I came here to clear out my papers and boxes. And\nthere's no chance of interruptions.\"\n\nHe went and stood before the empty fireplace, and plunged into the\nmiddle of the matter.\n\n\"You know, my dear Stratton, in this confounded business my heart's with\nyou. It has been all along. If I could have seen a clear chance before\nyou--for you and Mary to get away--and make any kind of life of\nit--though she's my cousin--I'd have helped you. Indeed I would. But\nthere's no sort of chance--not the ghost of a chance....\"\n\nHe began to explain very fully, quite incontrovertibly, that entire\nabsence of any chance for Mary and myself together. He argued to the\nconverted. \"You know as well as I do what that romantic flight abroad,\nthat Ouidaesque casa in some secluded valley, comes to in reality. All\nround Florence there's no end of such scandalous people, I've been among\nthem, the nine circles of the repenting scandalous, all cutting one\nanother.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" I said. \"And yet----\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"We could have come back.\"\n\nTarvrille paused, and then leant forward. \"No.\"\n\n\"But people have done so. It would have been a clean sort of divorce.\"\n\n\"You don't understand Justin. Justin would ruin you. If you were to take\nMary away.... He's a queer little man. Everything is in his hands.\nEverything always is in the husband's hands in these affairs. If he\nchooses. And keeps himself in the right. For an injured husband the law\nsanctifies revenge....\n\n\"And you see, you've got to take Justin's terms. He's changed. He didn't\nat first fully realize. He feels--cheated. We've had to persuade him.\nThere's a case for Justin, you know. He's had to stand--a lot. I don't\nwonder at his going stiff at last. No doubt it's hard for you to see\nthat. But you have to see it. You've got to go away as he\nrequires--three years out of England, you've got to promise not to\ncorrespond, not to meet afterwards----\"\n\n\"It's so extravagant a separation.\"\n\n\"The alternative is--not for you to have Mary, but for you two to be\nflung into the ditch together--that's what it comes to, Stratton.\nJustin's got his case. He's set like--steel. You're up against the law,\nup against social tradition, up against money--any one of those a man\nmay fight, but not all three. And she's ill, Stratton. You owe her\nconsideration. You of all people. That's no got-up story; she's truly\nill and broken. She can no longer fly with you and fight with you,\ntravel in uncomfortable trains, stay in horrible little inns. You don't\nunderstand. The edge is off her pluck, Stratton.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked, and questioned his face.\n\n\"Just exactly what I say.\"\n\nA gleam of understanding came to me....\n\n\"Why can't I see her?\" I broke in, with my voice full of misery and\nanger. \"Why can't I see her? As if seeing her once more could matter so\nvery greatly now!\"\n\nHe appeared to weigh something in his mind. \"You can't,\" he said.\n\n\"How do I know that she's not being told some story of my abandonment of\nher? How do I know she isn't being led to believe I no longer want her\nto come to me?\"\n\n\"She isn't,\" said Tarvrille, still with that arrested judicial note in\nhis voice. \"You had her letters?\" he said.\n\n\"Two.\"\n\n\"Yes. Didn't they speak?\"\n\n\"I want to see her. Damn it, Tarvrille!\" I cried with sudden tears in\nmy smarting eyes. \"Let _her_ send me away. This isn't---- Not treating\nus like human beings.\"\n\n\"Women,\" said Tarvrille and looked at his boot toes, \"are different from\nmen. You see, Stratton----\"\n\nHe paused. \"You always strike me, Stratton, as not realizing that women\nare weak things. We've got to take _care_ of them. You don't seem to\nfeel that as I do. Their moods--fluctuate--more than ours do. If you\nhold 'em to what they say in the same way you hold a man--it isn't\nfair....\"\n\nHe halted as though he awaited my assent to that proposition.\n\n\"If you were to meet Mary now, you see, and if you were to say to her,\ncome--come and we'll jump down Etna together, and you said it in the\nproper voice and with the proper force, she'd do it, Stratton. You know\nthat. Any man knows a thing like that. And she wouldn't _want_ to do\nit....\"\n\n\"You mean that's why I can't see her.\"\n\n\"That's why you can't see her.\"\n\n\"Because we'd become--dramatic.\"\n\n\"Because you'd become--romantic and uncivilized.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said sullenly, realizing the bargain we were making, \"I\nwon't.\"\n\n\"You won't make any appeal?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nHe made no answer, and I looked up to discover him glancing over his\nshoulder through the great glass window into the other room. I stood up\nvery quickly, and there in the further apartment were Guy and Mary,\nstanding side by side. Our eyes met, and she came forward towards the\nwindow impulsively, and paused, with that unpitying pane between us....\n\nThen Guy was opening the door for her and she stood in the doorway. She\nwas in dark furs wrapped about her, but in the instant I could see how\nill she was and how broken. She came a step or so towards me and then\nstopped short, and so we stood, shyly and awkwardly under Guy and\nTarvrille's eyes, two yards apart. \"You see,\" she said, and stopped\nlamely.\n\n\"You and I,\" I said, \"have to part, Mary. We---- We are beaten. Is that\nso?\"\n\n\"Stephen, there is nothing for us to do. We've offended. We broke the\nrules. We have to pay.\"\n\n\"By parting?\"\n\n\"What else is there to do?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"There's nothing else.\" ...\n\n\"I tried,\" she said, \"that you shouldn't be sent from England.\"\n\n\"That's a detail,\" I answered.\n\n\"But your politics--your work?\"\n\n\"That does not matter. The great thing is that you are ill and\nunhappy--that I can't help you. I can't do anything.... I'd go anywhere\n... to save you.... All I can do, I suppose, is to part like this and\ngo.\"\n\n\"I shan't be--altogether unhappy. And I shall think of you----\"\n\nShe paused, and we stood facing one another, tongue-tied. There was only\none word more to say, and neither of us would say it for a moment.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" she whispered at last, and then, \"Don't think I deserted\nyou, Stephen my dear. Don't think ill of me. I couldn't come--I couldn't\ncome to you,\" and suddenly her face changed slowly and she began to\nweep, my fearless playmate whom I had never seen weeping before; she\nbegan to weep as an unhappy child might weep.\n\n\"Oh my Mary!\" I cried, weeping also, and held out my arms, and we clung\ntogether and kissed with tear-wet faces.\n\n\"No,\" cried Guy belatedly, \"we promised Justin!\"\n\nBut Tarvrille restrained his forbidding arm, and then after a second's\ninterval put a hand on my shoulder. \"Come,\" he said....\n\nAnd so it was Mary and I parted from one another.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE SEVENTH\n\nBEGINNING AGAIN\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 1\n\nIn operas and romances one goes from such a parting in a splendid\ndignity of gloom. But I am no hero, and I went down the big staircase of\nTarvrille's house the empty shuck of an abandoned desire. I was acutely\nashamed of my recent tears. In the centre of the hall was a marble\nfigure swathed about with yellow muslin. \"On account of the flies,\" I\nsaid, breaking our silence.\n\nMy words were far too unexpected for Tarvrille to understand. \"The\nflies,\" I repeated with an air of explanation.\n\n\"You're sure she'll be all right?\" I said abruptly.\n\n\"You've done the best thing you can for her.\"\n\n\"I suppose I have. I have to go.\" And then I saw ahead of me a world\nfull of the tiresome need of decisions and arrangements and empty of all\ninterest. \"Where the _devil_ am I to go, Tarvrille? I can't even get out\nof things altogether....\"\n\nAnd then with a fresh realization of painful difficulties ahead: \"I have\nto tell this to my father. I've got to explain---- And he thought--he\nexpected----\"\n\nTarvrille opened the half of the heavy front door for me, hesitated,\nand came down the broad steps into the chilly grey street and a few\nyards along the pavement with me. He wanted to say something that he\nfound difficult to say. When at last he did find words they were quite\nridiculous in substance, and yet at the time I took them as gravely as\nhe intended them. \"It's no good quoting Marcus Aurelius,\" said\nTarvrille, \"to a chap with his finger in the crack of a door.\"\n\n\"I suppose it isn't,\" I said.\n\n\"One doesn't want to be a flatulent ass of course,\" said Tarvrille,\n\"still----\"\n\nHe resumed with an air of plunging. \"It will sound just rot to you now,\nStratton, but after all it comes to this. Behind us is\na--situation--with half-a-dozen particular persons. Out here--I mean\nhere round the world--before you've done with them--there's a thousand\nmillion people--men and women.\"\n\n\"Oh! what does that matter to me?\" said I.\n\n\"Everything,\" said Tarvrille. \"At least--it ought to.\"\n\nHe stopped and held out his hand. \"Good-bye, Stratton--good luck to you!\nGood-bye.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"Good-bye.\"\n\nI turned away from him. The image of Mary crying as a child cries\nsuddenly blinded me and blotted out the world.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 2\n\nI want to give you as clearly as I can some impression of the mental\nstates that followed this passion and this collapse. It seems to me one\nof the most extraordinary aspects of all that literature of speculative\nattack which is called psychology, that there is no name and no\ndescription at all of most of the mental states that make up life.\nPsychology, like sociology, is still largely in the scholastic stage, it\nis ignorant and intellectual, a happy refuge for the lazy industry of\npedants; instead of experience and accurate description and analysis it\nbegins with the rash assumption of elements and starts out upon\nridiculous syntheses. Who with a sick soul would dream of going to a\npsychologist?...\n\nNow here was I with a mind sore and inflamed. I did not clearly\nunderstand what had happened to me. I had blundered, offended, entangled\nmyself; and I had no more conception than a beast in a bog what it was\nhad got me, or the method or even the need of escape. The desires and\npassionate excitements, the anger and stress and strain and suspicion of\nthe last few months had worn deep grooves in my brain, channels without\nend or issue, out of which it seemed impossible to keep my thoughts. I\nhad done dishonorable things, told lies, abused the confidence of a\nfriend. I kept wrestling with these intolerable facts. If some momentary\ndistraction released me for a time, back I would fall presently before I\nknew what was happening, and find myself scheming once more to reverse\nthe accomplished, or eloquently restating things already intolerably\noverdiscussed in my mind, justifying the unjustifiable or avenging\ndefeat. I would dream again and again of some tremendous appeal to Mary,\nsome violent return and attack upon the situation....\n\nOne very great factor in my mental and moral distress was the uncertain\nvalues of nearly every aspect of the case. There is an invincible sense\nof wild rightness about passionate love that no reasoning and no\ntraining will ever altogether repudiate; I had a persuasion that out of\nthat I would presently extract a magic to excuse my deceits and\ntreacheries and assuage my smarting shame. And round these deep central\npreoccupations were others of acute exasperation and hatred towards\nsecondary people. There had been interventions, judgments upon\ninsufficient evidence, comments, and often quite justifiable comments,\nthat had filled me with an extraordinary savagery of resentment.\n\nI had a persuasion, illogical but invincible, that I was still entitled\nto all the respect due to a man of unblemished honor. I clung fiercely\nto the idea that to do dishonorable things isn't necessarily to be\ndishonorable.... This state of mind I am describing is, I am convinced,\nthe state of every man who has involved himself in any affair at once\nquestionable and passionate. He seems free, but he is not free; he is\nthe slave of the relentless paradox of his position.\n\nAnd we were all of us more or less in deep grooves we had made for\nourselves, Philip, Guy, Justin, the friends involved, and all in the\nmeasure of our grooves incapable of tolerance or sympathetic\nrealization. Even when we slept, the clenched fist of the attitudes we\nhad assumed gave a direction to our dreams.\n\nYou see the same string of events that had produced all this system of\nintense preoccupations had also severed me from the possible resumption\nof those wider interests out of which our intrigue had taken me. I had\nhad to leave England and all the political beginnings I had been\nplanning, and to return to those projects now, those now impossible\nprojects, was to fall back promptly into hopeless exasperation....\n\nAnd then the longing, the longing that is like a physical pain, that\nhunger of the heart for some one intolerably dear! The desire for a\nvoice! The arrested habit of phrasing one's thoughts for a hearer who\nwill listen in peace no more! From that lonely distress even rage, even\nthe concoction of insult and conflict, was a refuge. From that pitiless\ntravail of emptiness I was ready to turn desperately to any offer of\nexcitement and distraction.\n\nFrom all those things I was to escape at last unhelped, but I want you\nto understand particularly these phases through which I passed; it falls\nto many and it may fall to you to pass through such a period of darkness\nand malign obsession. Make the groove only a little deeper, a little\nmore unclimbable, make the temperament a little less sanguine, and\nsuicide stares you in the face. And things worse than suicide, that\nsuicide of self-respect which turns men to drugs and inflammatory vices\nand the utmost outrageous defiance of the dreaming noble self that has\nbeen so despitefully used. Into these same inky pools I have dipped my\nfeet, where other men have drowned. I understand why they drown. And my\ntaste of misdeed and resentment has given me just an inkling of what men\nmust feel who go to prison. I know what it is to quarrel with a world.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 3\n\nMy first plan when I went abroad was to change my Harbury French, which\nwas poor stuff and pedantic, into a more colloquial article, and then go\ninto Germany to do the same thing with my German, and then perhaps to\nremain in Germany studying German social conditions--and the quality of\nthe German army. It seemed to me that when the term of my exile was over\nI might return to England and re-enter the army. But all these were very\nan\u00c3\u00a6mic plans conceived by a tired mind, and I set about carrying them\nout in a mood of slack lassitude. I got to Paris, and in Paris I threw\nthem all overboard and went to Switzerland.\n\nI remember very clearly how I reached Paris. I arrived about sunset--I\nsuppose at St. Lazare or the Gare du Nord--sent my luggage to the little\nhotel in the Rue d'Antin where I had taken rooms, and dreading their\nloneliness decided to go direct to a restaurant and dine. I remember\nwalking out into the streets just as shops and windows and street lamps\nwere beginning to light up, and strolling circuitously through the clear\nbright stir of the Parisian streets to find a dinner at the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 de la\nPaix. Some day you will know that peculiar sharp definite excitement of\nParis. All cities are exciting, and each I think in a different way. And\nas I walked down along some boulevard towards the centre of things I saw\na woman coming along a side street towards me, a woman with something in\nher body and something in her carriage that reminded me acutely of Mary.\nHer face was downcast, and then as we converged she looked up at me, not\nwith the meretricious smile of her class but with a steadfast, friendly\nlook. Her face seemed to me sane and strong. I passed and hesitated. An\nextraordinary impulse took me. I turned back. I followed this woman\nacross the road and a little way along the opposite pavement. I remember\nI did that, but I do not remember clearly what was in my mind at the\ntime; I think it was a vague rush towards the flash of companionship in\nher eyes. There I had seemed to see the glimmer of a refuge from my\ndesolation. Then came amazement and reaction. I turned about and went on\nmy way, and saw her no more.\n\nBut afterwards, later, I went out into the streets of Paris bent upon\nfinding that woman. She had become a hope, a desire.\n\nI looked for her for what seemed a long time, half an hour perhaps or\ntwo hours. I went along, peering at the women's faces, through the\nblazing various lights, the pools of shadowy darkness, the flickering\nreflections and transient glitter, one of a vast stream of slow-moving\nadventurous human beings. I crossed streams of traffic, paused at\nluminous kiosks, became aware of dim rows of faces looking down upon me\nfrom above the shining enamel of the omnibuses.... My first intentness\nupon one person, so that I disregarded any distracting intervention,\ngave place by insensible degrees to a more general apprehension of the\nthings about me. That original woman became as it were diffused. I began\nto look at the men and women sitting at the little tables behind the\npanes of the caf\u00c3\u00a9s, and even on the terraces--for the weather was still\ndry and open. I scrutinized the faces I passed, faces for the most part\nanimated by a sort of shallow eagerness. Many were ugly, many vile with\nan intense vulgarity, but some in that throng were pretty, some almost\ngracious. There was something pathetic and appealing for me in this\ngreat sweeping together of people into a little light, into a weak\ncommunity of desire for joy and eventfulness. There came to me a sense\nof tolerance, of fellowship, of participation. From an outer darkness\nof unhappiness or at least of joylessness, they had all come hither--as\nI had come.\n\nI was like a creature that slips back again towards some deep waters out\nof which long since it came, into the light and air. It was as if old\nforgotten things, prenatal experiences, some magic of ancestral\nmemories, urged me to mingle again with this unsatisfied passion for\nlife about me....\n\nThen suddenly a wave of feeling between self-disgust and fear poured\nover me. This vortex was drawing me into deep and unknown things.... I\nhailed a passing _fiacre_, went straight to my little hotel, settled my\naccount with the proprietor, and caught a night train for Switzerland.\n\nAll night long my head ached, and I lay awake swaying and jolting and\nlistening to the rhythms of the wheels, Paris clean forgotten so soon as\nit was left, and my thoughts circling continually about Justin and\nPhilip and Mary and the things I might have said and done.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 4\n\nOne day late in February I found myself in Vevey. I had come down with\nthe break-up of the weather from Montana, where I had met some Oxford\nmen I knew and had learned to ski. I had made a few of those vague\nacquaintances one makes in a winter-sport hotel, but now all these\npeople were going back to England and I was thrown back upon myself once\nmore. I was dull and angry and unhappy still, full of self-reproaches\nand dreary indignations, and then very much as the sky will sometimes\nbreak surprisingly through storm clouds there began in me a new series\nof moods. They came to me by surprise. One clear bright afternoon I sat\nupon the wall that runs along under the limes by the lake shore, envying\nall these people who were going back to England and work and usefulness.\nI thought of myself, of my career spoilt, my honor tarnished, my\ncharacter tested and found wanting. So far as English politics went my\nprospects had closed for ever. Even after three years it was improbable\nthat I should be considered by the party managers again. And besides, it\nseemed to me I was a man crippled. My other self, the mate and\nconfirmation of my mind, had gone from me. I was no more than a\nmutilated man. My life was a thing condemned; I had joined the ranks of\nloafing, morally-limping, English exiles.\n\nI looked up. The sun was setting, a warm glow fell upon the dissolving\nmountains of Savoy and upon the shining mirror of the lake. The\nluminous, tranquil breadth of it caught me and held me. \"I am done for.\"\nThe light upon the lake and upon the mountains, the downward swoop of a\nbird over the water and something in my heart, gave me the lie.\n\n\"What nonsense!\" I said, and felt as if some dark cloud that had\novershadowed me had been thrust back.\n\nI stared across at Savoy as though that land had spoken. Why should I\nlet all my life be ruled by the blunders and adventures of one short\nyear of adventure? Why should I become the votary of a train of\nconsequences? What had I been dreaming of all this time? Over there were\ngigantic uplands I had never seen and trodden; and beyond were great\nplains and cities, and beyond that the sea, and so on, great spaces and\nmultitudinous things all round about the world. What did the things I\nhad done, the things I had failed to do, the hopes crushed out of me,\nthe tears and the anger, matter to _that_? And in some amazing way this\nthought so took possession of me that the question seemed also to carry\nwith it the still more startling collateral, what then did they matter\nto me? \"Come out of yourself,\" said the mountains and all the beauty of\nthe world. \"Whatever you have done or suffered is nothing to the\ninexhaustible offer life makes you. We are you, just as much as the past\nis you.\"\n\nIt was as though I had forgotten and now remembered how infinitely\nmultitudinous life can be. It was as if Tarvrille's neglected words to\nme had sprouted in the obscurity of my mind and borne fruit....\n\nI cannot explain how that mood came, I am doing my best to describe it,\nand it is not easy even to describe. And I fear that to you who will\nhave had I hope no experience of such shadows as I had passed through,\nit is impossible to convey its immense elation.... I remember once I\ncame in a boat out of the caves of Han after two hours in the darkness,\nand there was the common daylight that is nothing wonderful at all, and\nits brightness ahead there seemed like trumpets and cheering, like\nwaving flags and like the sunrise. And so it was with this mood of my\nrelease.\n\nThere is a phrase of Peter E. Noyes', that queer echo of Emerson whom\npeople are always rediscovering and forgetting again, a phrase that\nsticks in my mind,--\"Every living soul is heir to an empire and has\nfallen into a pit.\" It's an image wonderfully apt to describe my change\nof mental attitude, and render the contrast between those intensely\npassionate personal entanglements that had held me tight and that wide\nestate of life that spreads about us all, open to all of us in just the\nmeasure that we can scramble out of our individual selves--to a more\ngeneral self. I seemed to be hanging there at the brim of my stale and\npainful den, staring at the unthought-of greatness of the world, with an\nunhoped-for wind out of heaven blowing upon my face.\n\nI suppose the intention of the phrase \"finding salvation,\" as religious\npeople use it, is very much this experience. If it is not the same thing\nit is something very closely akin. It is as if someone were scrambling\nout of a pit into a largeness--a largeness that is attainable by every\nman just in the measure that he realizes it is there.\n\nI leave these fine discriminations to the theologian. I know that I went\nback to my hotel in Vevey with my mind healed, with my will restored to\nme, and my ideas running together into plans. And I know that I had come\nout that day a broken and apathetic man.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 5\n\nThe next day my mood declined again; it was as if that light, that sense\nof release that had shone so clear and strong in my mind, had escaped\nme. I sought earnestly to recover it. But I could not do so, and I found\nmy old narrow preoccupations calling urgently to me again.\n\nI thought that perhaps I might get back those intimations of outlook and\nrelief if I clambered alone into some high solitude and thought. I had\na crude attractive vision of myself far above the heat and noise,\ncommuning with the sky. It was the worst season for climbing, and on the\nspur of the moment I could do nothing but get up the Rochers de Naye on\nthe wrong side, and try and find some eyrie that was neither slippery\nnor wet. I did not succeed. In one place I slipped down a wet bank for\nsome yards and held at last by a root; if I had slipped much further I\nshould not be writing here now; and I came back a very weary and bruised\nclimber, without any meditation....\n\nThree nights after when I was in bed I became very lucidly awake--it\nmust have been about two or three in the morning--and the vision of life\nreturned to me, with that same effect of enlargement and illumination.\nIt was as if the great stillness that is behind and above and around the\nworld of sense did in some way communicate with me. It bade me rouse my\nspirit and go on with the thoughts and purposes that had been stirring\nand proliferating in my mind when I had returned to England from the\nCape. \"Dismiss your passion.\" But I urged that that I could not do;\nthere was the thought of Mary subjugated and weeping, the smarting\nmemory of injury and defeat, the stains of subterfuge and discovery, the\naching separation. No matter, the stillness answered, in the end all\nthat is just to temper you for your greater uses.... I cannot forget, I\ninsisted. Do not forget, but for the present this leads you no whither;\nthis chapter has ended; dismiss it and turn to those other things. You\nare not only Stephen Stratton who fell into adultery; in these silences\nhe is a little thing and far away; here and with me you are\nMan--Everyman--in this round world in which your lot has fallen. But\nMary, I urged, to forget Mary is a treason, an ingratitude, seeing that\nshe loved me. But the stillness did not command me to forget her, but\nonly to turn my face now to the great work that lies before mankind. And\nthat work? That work, so far as your share goes, is first to understand,\nto solve, and then to achieve, to work out in the measure of yourself\nthat torment of pity and that desire for order and justice which\ntogether saturate your soul. Go about the world, embrue yourself with\nlife, make use of that confusedly striving brain that I have lifted so\npainfully out of the deadness of matter....\n\n\"But who are you?\" I cried out suddenly to the night. \"Who are you?\"\n\nI sat up on the side of my bed. The dawn was just beginning to break up\nthe featureless blackness of the small hours. \"This is just some odd\ncorner of my brain,\" I said....\n\nYet---- How did I come to have this odd corner in my brain? What _is_\nthis lucid stillness?...\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 6\n\nLet me tell you rather of my thoughts than of my moods, for there at\nleast one comes to something with a form that may be drawn and a\nsubstance that is measurable; one ceases to struggle with things\nindefinable and the effort to convey by metaphors and imaginary voices\nthings that are at once bodiless and soundless and lightless and yet\ninfinitely close and real. And moreover with that mysterious and subtle\nchange of heart in me there came also a change in the quality and range\nof my ideas. I seemed to rise out of a tangle of immediacies and\nmisconceptions, to see more largely and more freely than I had ever done\nbefore.\n\nI have told how in my muddled and wounded phase I had snatched at the\ndull project of improving my languages, and under the cloak of that\nspying a little upon German military arrangements. Now my mind set such\npetty romanticism on one side. It had recovered the strength to look on\nthe whole of life and on my place in it. It could resume the ideas that\nour storm of passion had for a time thrust into the background of my\nthoughts. I took up again all those broad generalizations that had\narisen out of my experiences in South Africa, and which I had been not\nso much fitting into as forcing into the formul\u00c3\u00a6 of English politics; I\nrecalled my disillusionment with British Imperialism, my vague but\nelaborating apprehension of a profound conflict between enterprise and\nlabor, a profound conflict between the life of the farm and the life of\ntrade and finance and wholesale production, as being something far truer\nto realities than any of the issues of party and patriotism upon which\nmen were spending their lives. So far as this rivalry between England\nand Germany, which so obsessed the imagination of Europe, went, I found\nthat any faith I may have had in its importance had simply fallen out of\nmy mind. As a danger to civilization, as a conceivable source of\ndestruction and delay, it was a monstrous business enough, but that in\nthe long run it mattered how or when they fought and which won I did not\nbelieve. In the development of mankind the thing was of far less\nimportance than the struggle for Flanders or the wars of France and\nBurgundy. I was already coming to see Europe as no more than the\ndog's-eared corner of the page of history,--like most Europeans I had\nthought it the page--and my recovering mind was eager and open to see\nthe world beyond and form some conception of the greater forces that lay\noutside our insularities. What is humanity as a whole doing? What is the\nnature of the world process of which I am a part? Why should I drift\nfrom cradle to grave wearing the blinkers of my time and nationality, a\nmere denizen of Christendom, accepting its beliefs, its stale\nantagonisms, its unreal purposes? That perhaps had been tolerable while\nI was still an accepted member of the little world into which my lot had\nfallen, but now that I was thrust out its absurdity glared. For me the\nalternative was to be a world-man or no man. I had seemed sinking\ntowards the latter: now I faced about and began to make myself what I\nstill seek to make myself to-day, a son of mankind, a conscious part of\nthat web of effort and perplexity which wraps about our globe....\n\nAll this I say came into my mind as if it were a part of that recovery\nof my mind from its first passionate abjection. And it seemed a simple\nand obvious part of the same conversion to realize that I was ignorant\nand narrow, and that, too, in a world which is suffering like a beast in\na slime pit by reason of ignorance and narrowness of outlook, and that\nit was my manifest work and purpose to make myself less ignorant and to\nsee and learn with all my being. It came to me as a clear duty that I\nshould get out of the land of hotels and leisure and go seeking the\nfacts and clues to human inter-relationship nearer the earthy roots of\nthings, and I turned my thoughts to India and China, those vast enigmas\nof human accumulation, in a spirit extraordinarily like that of some\nmystic who receives a call. I felt I must go to Asia and from Asia\nperhaps round the world. But it was the greatness of Asia commanded me.\nI wanted to see the East not as a spectacle but as the simmering vat in\nwhich the greater destiny of man brews and brews....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 7\n\nIt was necessary to tell my father of my intentions. I made numerous\nbeginnings. I tore up several letters and quarrelled bitterly with the\nhotel pens. At first I tried to describe the change that had happened to\nmy mind, to give him some impression of the new light, the release that\nhad come to me. But how difficult this present world is with its tainted\nand poisoned phrases and its tangled misunderstandings! Here was I\nwriting for the first time in my life of something essentially religious\nand writing it to him whose profession was religion, and I could find no\nwords to convey my meaning to him that did not seem to me fraught with\nthe possibilities of misinterpretation. One evening I made a desperate\nresolve to let myself go, and scrawled my heart out to him as it seemed\nthat night, a strange, long letter. It was one of the profoundest\nregrets that came to me when I saw him dead last winter that I did not\nrisk his misunderstanding and post that letter. But when I re-read it in\nthe next morning's daylight it seemed to me so rhetorical, so full\nof--what shall I call it?--spiritual bombast, it so caricatured and\nreflected upon the deep feelings sustaining me, that I could not post it\nfor shamefacedness, and I tore it up into little pieces and sent\ninstead the briefest of notes.\n\n\"I am doing no good here in Switzerland,\" I wrote. \"Would you mind if I\nwent east? I want to see something of the world outside Europe. I have a\nfancy I may find something to do beyond there. Of course, it will cost\nrather more than my present allowance. I will do my best to economize.\nDon't bother if it bothers you--I've been bother enough to you....\"\n\nHe replied still more compactly. \"By all means. I will send you some\ncircular notes, Poste Restante, Rome. That will be on your way. Good\nwishes to you, Stephen. I'm glad you want to go east instead of just\nstaying in Switzerland.\"\n\nI sit here now and wonder, little son, what he thought, what he\nsupposed, what he understood.\n\nI loved my father, and I began to perceive he loved me wonderfully. I\ncan imagine no man I would have sooner had for a priest than him; all\npriestcraft lays hands if it can, and with an excellent wisdom, upon the\ntitles and dignity of fatherhood; and yet here am I left to guessing--I\ndo not know whether my father ever worshipped, whether he ever prayed\nwith his heart bared to God. There are times when the inexpressiveness\nof life comes near to overwhelming me, when it seems to me we are all\nasleep or entranced, and but a little way above the still cows who stand\nmunching slowly in a field. Why couldn't we and why didn't we talk\ntogether?... We fear bathos too much, are shyly decent to the pitch of\nmania. We have neither the courage of our bodies nor of our souls....\n\nI went almost immediately to Rome. I stayed in Rome some days, getting\ntogether an outfit, and incidentally seeing that greater city of the\ndead in whose embrace the modern city lies. I was now becoming\ninterested in things outside my grooves, though my grooves were still\nthere, deep and receptive, and I went about the place at last almost\neagerly, tracing the outlines of that great departed city on whose\ncolossal bones the churches and palaces of the middle ages cluster like\nweeds in the spaces and ruins of a magnificent garden. I found myself\none day in the Forum, thinking of that imperialism that had built the\nBasilica of Julius C\u00c3\u00a6sar, and comparing its cramped vestiges with that\nvaster second administrative effort which has left the world the\nmonstrous arches of Constantine. I sat down over against these last\namong the ruins of the Vestals' House, and mused on that later\nreconstruction when the Empire, with its science aborted and its\nliterature and philosophy shrivelled to nothing, its social fabric\nruined by the extravagances of financial adventure and its honor and\npatriotism altogether dead, united itself, in a desperate effort to\ncontinue, with all that was most bickeringly intolerant and destructive\nin Christianity--only to achieve one common vast decay. All Europe to\nthis day is little more than the sequel to that failure. It is the Roman\nEmpire in disintegration. The very churches whose domes rise to the\nnorthward of the ancient remains are built of looted stones and look\nlike parasitic and fungoid growths, and the tourists stream through\nthose spaces day by day, stare at the marble fragments, the arches, the\nfallen carvings and rich capitals, with nothing greater in their minds\nand nothing clearer....\n\nI discovered I was putting all this into the form of a letter to Mary.\nI was writing to her in my mind, as many people talk to themselves. And\nI remember that I wandered upon the Palatine Hill musing over the idea\nof writing a long letter to her, a long continuous letter to her, a sort\nof diary of impressions and ideas, that somewhen, years ahead, I might\nbe able to put into her hands.\n\nOne does not carry out such an idea into reality; it is so much easier\nto leave the letter imagined and unwritten if there lives but little\nhope of its delivery; yet for many years I kept up an impalpable\ncorrespondence in my thoughts, a stream of expression to which no answer\ncame--until at last the habits of public writing and the gathering\ninterests of a new r\u00c3\u00b4le in life diverted it to other ends.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 8\n\nOne morning on the way from Brindisi to Egypt I came up on deck at dawn\nbecause my mind was restless and I could not sleep. Another solitary\npassenger was already up, so intently watching a pink-lit rocky\ncoast-line away to the north of us that for a time he did not observe\nme.\n\n\"That's Crete,\" he said, when at last he became aware of me close at\nhand.\n\n\"Crete!\" said I.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"Crete.\"\n\nHe came nearer to me. \"That, sir,\" he said with a challenging emphasis,\n\"is the most wonderful island I've ever yet set eyes on,--quite the most\nwonderful.\"\n\n\"Five thousand years ago,\" he remarked after a pause that seemed to me\nto be calculated, \"they were building palaces there, better than the\nbest we can build to-day. And things--like modern things. They had\nbathrooms there, beautifully fitted bathrooms--and admirable\nsanitation--admirable. Practically--American. They had better artists to\nserve them than your King Edward has, why! Minos would have laughed or\nscreamed at all that Windsor furniture. And the things they made of\ngold, sir--you couldn't get them done anywhere to-day. Not for any\nmoney. There was a Go about them.... They had a kind of writing,\ntoo--before the Phoenicians. No man can read it now, and there it is.\nFifty centuries ago it was; and to-day--They grow oranges and lemons.\nAnd they riot.... Everything else gone.... It's as if men struggled up\nto a certain pitch and then--grew tired.... All this Mediterranean; it's\na tired sea....\"\n\nThat was the beginning of a curious conversation. He was an American, a\nyear or so younger than myself, going, he said, \"to look at Egypt.\"\n\n\"In our country,\" he explained, \"we're apt to forget all these\nworked-out regions. Too apt. We don't get our perspectives. We think the\nwhole blessed world is one everlasting boom. It hit me first down in\nYucatan that that wasn't so. Why! the world's littered with the remains\nof booms and swaggering beginnings. Americanism!--there's always been\nAmericanism. This Mediterranean is just a Museum of old Americas. I\nguess Tyre and Sidon thought they were licking creation all the time.\nIt's set me thinking. What's _really_ going on? Why--anywhere,--you're\nrunning about among ruins--anywhere. And ruins of something just as good\nas anything we're doing to-day. Better--in some ways. It takes the heart\nout of you....\"\n\nIt was Gidding, who is now my close friend and ally. I remember very\nvividly the flavor of morning freshness as we watched Crete pass away\nnorthward and I listened to his talk.\n\n\"I was coming out of New York Harbor a month ago and looking back at the\nskyscrapers,\" he said, \"and suddenly it hit me in the mind;--'That's\njust the next ruin,' I thought.\"\n\nI remember that much of our first talk, but the rest of it now is\nindistinct.\n\nWe had however struck up an acquaintance, we were both alone, and until\nhe left me on his way to Abydos we seem now to have been conversing all\nthe time. And almost all the time we were discussing human destiny and\nthe causes of effort and decay, and whether the last few ascendant\ncenturies the world has seen have in them anything more persistent than\nthe countless beginnings that have gone before.\n\n\"There's Science,\" said I a little doubtfully.\n\n\"At Cnossus there they had D\u00c3\u00a6dalus, sir, fifty centuries ago. D\u00c3\u00a6dalus!\nHe was an F.R.S. all right. I haven't a doubt he flew. If they hadn't\nsteel they had brass. We're too conceited about our little modern\nthings.\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 9\n\nI found something very striking and dramatic in the passage from Europe\nto Asia. One steams slowly through a desert that comes up close to the\nship; the sand stretches away, hillock and mound beyond hillock and\nmound; one sees camels in the offing stringing out to some ancient\ndestination; one is manifestly passing across a barrier,--the canal has\nchanged nothing of that. Suez is a first dab of tumultuous Orientalism,\nnoisy and vivid. And then, after that gleam of turmoil, one opens out\ninto the lonely dark blue waters of the Red Sea. Right and left the\nshore is a bitter, sun-scorched desolation; eastward frowns a great\nrampart of lowering purple mountains towering up to Sinai. It is like no\nEuropean landscape. The boat goes slowly as if uncharted dangers lurked\nahead. It is a new world with a new atmosphere. Then comes wave upon\nwave of ever more sultry air, and the punkahs begin to swing and the\nwhite clothes appear. Everyone casts off Europe, assumes an Asiatic\nlivery. The very sun, rushing up angrily and abruptly after a heated\nnight, is unfamiliar, an Asiatic sun.\n\nAnd so one goes down that reef-fringed waterway to Aden; it is studded\nwith lonely-looking lighthouses that burn, it seems, untended, and\nsometimes in their melancholy isolation swing great rhythmic arms of\nlight. And then, land and the last lateen sails of Aden vanishing\ntogether, one stands out into the hot thundery monotonies of the Indian\nOcean; into imprisonment in a blue horizon across whose Titan ring the\nengines seem to throb in vain. How one paces the ship day by day, and\neats and dozes and eats again, and gossips inanely and thanks Heaven\neven for a flight of flying fish or a trail of smoke from over the\nhorizon to take one's mind a little out of one's oily quivering\nprison!... A hot portentous delay; a sinister significant pause; that is\nthe voyage from Europe to India still.\n\nI suppose by the time that you will go to India all this prelude will\nhave vanished, you will rattle through in a train-de-luxe from Calais,\nby way of Baku or Constantinople; you will have none of this effect of\na deliberate sullen approach across limitless miles of sea. But that is\nhow I went to India. Everything seemed to expand; I was coming out of\nthe frequent landfalls, the neighborly intimacies and neighborly\nconflicts of the Mediterranean into something remoter; into larger seas\nand greater lands, rarer communications and a vaster future....\n\nTo go from Europe to Asia is like going from Norway to Russia, from\nsomething slight and \"advanced\" to something massive and portentous. I\nfelt that nearly nine years ago; to-day all Asia seems moving forward to\njustify my feelings....\n\nAnd I remember too that as I went down the Red Sea and again in the\nIndian Ocean I had a nearly intolerable passion of loneliness. A wound\nmay heal and still leave pain. I was coming out of Europe as one comes\nout of a familiar house into something larger and stranger, I seemed but\na little speck of life, and behind me, far away and silent and receding,\nwas the one other being to whom my thoughts were open. It seemed very\ncruel to me that I could not write to her.\n\nSuch moods were to come to me again and again, and particularly during\nthe inactivities of voyages and in large empty spaces and at night when\nI was weary. At other times I could banish and overcome them by forcing\nmyself to be busy and by going to see novel and moving things.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE EIGHTH\n\nTHIS SWARMING BUSINESS OF MANKIND\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 1\n\nI do not think I could now arrange into a consecutive history my\ntravellings, my goings and returnings in my wandering effort to see and\ncomprehend the world. And certainly even if I could arrange my facts I\nshould still be at a loss to tell of the growth of ideas that is so much\nmore important than any facts, to trace the increasing light to its\ninnumerable sources, to a chink here, to a glowing reflection there, to\na leap of burning light from some long inert darkness close at hand. But\nsteadily the light grew, and this vast world of man, in which our world,\nlittle son, is the world of a limited class in a small island, began to\ntake on definite forms, to betray broad universal movements; what seemed\nat first chaotic, a drift and tangle of passions, traditions, foolish\nideas, blundering hostilities, careless tolerances, became confusedly\nsystematic, showed something persistent and generalized at work among\nits multitudinous perplexity.\n\nI wonder now if I can put before you very briefly the main\ngeneralizations that were growing up in my mind during my exile, the\nsimplified picture into which I translated the billions of sights and\nsounds and--smells, for every part of the world has its distinctive\nolfactory palette as much as its palette of colors--that rained daily\nand nightly upon my mind.\n\nBefore, my eyes again as I sit here in this quiet walled French garden,\nthe great space before the Jumna Musjid at Delhi reappears, as I saw it\nin the evening stillness against a glowing sky of gold, and the memory\nof countless worshippers within, praying with a devotion no European\ndisplays. And then comes a memory of that long reef of staircases and\ntemples and buildings, the ghats of Benares, in the blazing morning sun,\nswarming with a vast multitude of multicolored people and the water also\nswarming with brown bodies. It has the colors of a bed of extravagantly\nsplendid flowers and the light that is Indian alone. Even as I sit here\nthese places are alive with happening. It is just past midday here; at\nthis moment the sun sinks in the skies of India, the Jumna Musjid\nflushes again with the glow of sunset, the smoke of evening fires\nstreams heavenward against its subtle lines, and upon those steps at\nBenares that come down the hillside between the conquering mosque of\nAurangzeb and the shining mirror of the Ganges a thousand silent seated\nfigures fall into meditation. And other memories recur and struggle with\none another; the crowded river-streets of Canton, the rafts and\nhouseboats and junks innumerable, riding over inky water, begin now to\ntwinkle with a thousand lights. They are ablaze in Osaka and Yokohama\nand Tokio, and the swarming staircase streets of Hong Kong glitter with\na wicked activity now that night has come. I flash a glimpse of Burmese\ntemples, of villages in Java, of the sombre purple masses of the walls\nof the Tartar city at Pekin with squat pagoda-guarded gates. How those\ngreat outlines lowered at me in the twilight, full of fresh memories and\ngrim anticipations of baseness and violence and bloodshed! I sit here\nrecalling it--feeling it all out beyond the trellised vine-clad wall\nthat bounds my physical vision.... Vast crowded world that I have seen!\ngoing from point to point seeking for clues, for generalities, until at\nlast it seems to me that there emerges--something understandable.\n\nI think I have got something understandable out of it all.\n\nWhat a fantastically courageous thing is this mind of ours! My thoughts\nseem to me at once presumptuous and inevitable. I do not know why it is\nthat I should dare, that any of us should dream of this attempt to\ncomprehend. But we who think are everyone impelled to this amazing\neffort to get it all together into some simple generality. It is not\nreason but a deep-seated instinct that draws our intelligence towards\nexplanations, that sets us perpetually seeking laws, seeking statements\nthat will fit into infinite, incessantly interweaving complexities, and\nbe true of them all! There is I perceive a valiant and magnificent\nstupidity about the human mind, a disregard of disproportion and\ninsufficiency--like the ferret which will turn from the leveret it has\nseized to attack even man if he should interfere. By these desperate\nfeats of thinking it is that our species has achieved its victories. By\nthem it survives. By them it must stand the test of ultimate survival.\nSome forgotten man in our ancestry--for every begetting man alive was in\nmy individual ancestry and yours three thousand years ago--first dared\nto think of the world as round,--an astounding temerity. He rolled up\nthe rivers and mountains, the forests and plains and broad horizons\nthat stretched beyond his ken, that seemed to commonsense to go on\ncertainly for ever, into a ball, into a little ball \"like an orange.\"\nMagnificent feat of the imagination, outdoing Thor's deep draught of the\nsea! And once he had done it, all do it and no one falters at the deed.\nYou are not yet seven as I write and already you are serenely aware that\nyou live upon a sphere. And in much the same manner it is that we, who\nare sociologists and economists, publicists and philosophers and what\nnot, are attempting now to roll up the vast world of facts which concern\nhuman intercourse, the whole indeed of history and arch\u00c3\u00a6ology, into some\nsimilar imaginable and manageable shape, that presently everyone will be\nable to grasp.\n\nI suppose there was a time when nobody bothered at all about the shape\nof the earth, when nobody had even had the idea that the earth could be\nconceived as having a shape, and similarly it is true that it is only in\nrecent centuries that people have been able to suppose that there was a\nshape to human history. It is indeed not much more than a century since\nthere was any real emergence from theological assumptions and pure\nromanticism and accidentalism in these matters. Old Adam Smith it was,\nprobing away at the roots of economics, who set going the construction\nof ampler propositions. From him spring all those new interpretations\nwhich have changed the writing of history from a record of dramatic\nreigns and wars and crises to an analysis of economic forces. How\nimpossible it would be for anyone now to write that great chapter of\nGibbon's in which he sweeps together into one contempt the history of\nsixty Emperors and six hundred years of time. His note of weariness and\nfutility vanishes directly one's vision penetrates the immediate\nsurface. Those Heraclians and Isaurians and Comneni were not history, a\nschoolboy nowadays knows that their record is not history, knows them\nfor the mere scum upon the stream.\n\nAnd still to-day we have our great interpretations to make. Ours is a\ntime of guesses, theories and provisional generalizations. Our phase\ncorresponds to the cosmography that was still a little divided between\ndiscs and domes and spheres and cosmic eggs; that was still a thousand\nyears from measuring and weighing a planet. For a long time my mind\nhovered about the stimulating theories of Socialism and particularly\nabout those more systematic forms of Socialist teaching that centre\nabout Karl Marx. He rose quite naturally out of those early economists\nwho saw all the world in terms of production and saving. He was a\nnecessary step for me at least, on the way to understanding. For a time\nI did so shape the world in my mind that it seemed to me no more than a\nvast enterprise for the organization and exploitation of labor. For a\ntime I thought human life was essentially a labor problem, that working\nand controlling work and lending and selling and \"speculating\" made the\nessential substance of human life, over which the forms of politics ran\nas the stripes of a tiger's skin run and bend over its living muscles. I\nfollowed my period in thinking that. You will find in Ferrero's \"Roman\nDecline,\" which was published early in this century, and which waits for\nyou in the library, almost exactly the method of interpretation that was\nrecommending itself to me in 1904 and 1905.\n\nWell, the labor problem concerns a great--_substantial_, shall I\nsay?--in human society. It is only I think the basis and matter of\nsociety, not its shape and life and reality, but it had to be\napprehended before I could get on to more actual things. Insensibly the\nidea that contemporary political forms mattered very fundamentally to\nmen, was fading out of my mind. The British Empire and the German\nEmpire, the Unity of Italy, and Anglo-Saxon ascendency, the Yellow Peril\nand all the other vast phantoms of the World-politician's mythology were\nfading out of my mind in those years, as the Olympic cosmogony must have\nfaded from the mind of some inquiring Greek philosopher in the days of\nHeraclitus. And I revised my history altogether in the new light. The\nworld had ceased to be chaotic in my mind; it had become a vast if as\nyet a quite inconclusive drama between employer and employed.\n\nIt makes a wonderful history, this history of mankind as a history of\nLabor, as a history of the perpetual attempts of an intelligent minority\nto get things done by other people. It does not explain how that\naggression of the minority arose nor does it give any conception of a\nprimordial society which corresponds with our knowledge of the realities\nof primitive communities. One begins rather in the air with a human\nsociety that sells and barters and sustains contracts and permits land\nto be privately owned, and having as hastily as possible got away from\nthat difficulty of beginnings, having ignored the large areas of the\nworld which remain under a pacific and unprogressive agriculture to this\nday, the rest of the story becomes extremely convincing and\nilluminating. It does indeed give a sustaining explanation to a large\npart of recorded history, this generalization about the proclivity of\nable and energetic people to make other people do things. One ignores\nwhat is being done as if that mattered nothing, and concentrates upon\nthe use and enslavement of men.\n\nOne sees that enslavement to labor progressing from crude directness to\nthe most subtly indirect methods. The first expedient of enterprise was\nthe sword and then the whip, and still there are remote and ugly corners\nof the world, in the Mexican Valle Nazionale or in Portuguese South\nAfrica, where the whip whistles still and the threat of great suffering\nand death follows hard upon the reluctant toiler. But the larger part of\nour modern slavery is past the stage of brand and whip. We have fallen\ninto methods at once more subtle and more effective. We stand\nbenevolently in front of our fellow man, offering, almost as if it were\nfood and drink and shelter and love, the work we want him to do; and\nbehind him, we are acutely aware, is necessity, sometimes quite of our\nmaking, as when we drive him to work by a hut-tax or a poll tax or a\nrent, that obliges him to earn money, and sometimes not so obviously of\nour making, sometimes so little of our making that it is easy to believe\nwe have no power to remove it. Instead of flicking the whip, we groan at\nlast with Harriet Martineau at the inexorable laws of political economy\nthat condemn us to comfort and direction, and those others to toil and\nhardship and indignity....\n\nAnd through the consideration of these latter later aspects it was that\nI came at last to those subtler problems of tacit self-deception, of\nimperfect and unwilling apprehension, of innocently assumed advantages,\nof wilfully disregarded unfairness; and also to all those other problems\nof motive, those forgotten questions of why we make others work for us\nlong after our personal needs are satisfied, why men aggrandize and\nundertake, which gradually have become in my mind the essential problems\nof human relationship, replacing the crude problems of labor altogether\nin that position, making _them_ at last only questions of contrivance\nand management on the way to greater ends.\n\nI have come to believe now that labor problems are problems merely by\nthe way. They have played their part in a greater scheme. This phase of\nexpropriation and enslavement, this half designed and half unconscious\ndriving of the duller by the clever, of the pacific by the bolder, of\nthose with weak appetites and imaginations by those with stronger\nappetites and imaginations, has been a necessary phase in human\ndevelopment. With my innate passionate desire to find the whole world\npurposeful, I cannot but believe that. But however necessary it has\nbeen, it is necessary no longer. Strangest of saviors, there rises over\nthe conflicts of mankind the glittering angular promise of the machine.\nThere is no longer any need for slavery, open or disguised. We do not\nneed slaves nor toilers nor mere laborers any more; they are no longer\nessential to a civilization. Man has ridden on his brother man out of\nthe need of servitude. He struggles through to a new phase, a phase of\nrelease, a phase when leisure and an unexampled freedom is possible to\nevery human being. Is possible. And it is there one halts seeing that\nsplendid possibility of aspiration and creation before mankind--and\nseeing mankind for the most part still downcast, quite unaware or\nincredulous, following the old rounds, the grooves of ancient and\nsuperseded assumptions and subjections....\n\nBut here I will not trace in any detail the growth of my conviction\nthat the ancient and heavy obligation to work hard and continually\nthroughout life has already slipped from man's shoulders. Suffice it\nthat now I conceive of the task before mankind as a task essentially of\nrearrangement, as a problem in relationships, extremely complex and\ndifficult indeed, but credibly solvable. During my Indian and Chinese\njourney I was still at the Marxist stage. I went about the east looking\nat labor, watching its organization and direction, seeing great\ninterests and enterprises replace the diffused life of an earlier phase;\nthe disputes and discussions in the Transvaal which had first opened my\nmind to these questions came back to me, and steadily I lost my interest\nin those mere political and national issues with their paraphernalia of\nkings and flags and governments and parties that had hitherto blinded me\nto these more fundamental interactions.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 2\n\nIt happened that in Bombay circumstances conspired to bring the crude\nfacts of labor enslavement vividly before me. I found a vigorous\nagitation raging in the English press against the horrible sweating that\nwas going on in the cotton mills, I met the journalist most intimately\nconcerned in the business on my second day in India, and before a week\nwas out I was hard at work getting up the question and preparing a\nmemorandum with him on the possibility of immediate legislative\nintervention. The very name of Bombay, which for most people recalls a\nspacious and dignified landfall, lateen sails, green islands and\njutting precipices, a long city of trees and buildings like a bright and\nvarious breakwater between the great harbor and the sea, and then\nexquisite little temples, painted bullock carriages, Towers of Silence,\nParsis, and an amazingly kaleidoscopic population,--is for me a reminder\nof narrow, foetid, plague-stricken streets and tall insanitary\ntenement-houses packed and dripping with humanity, and of terrible\nthrobbing factories working far into the night, blazing with electric\nlight against the velvet-black night-sky of India, damp with the\nsteam-clouds that are maintained to moisten the thread, and swarming\nwith emaciated overworked brown children--for even the adults, spare and\nsmall, in those mills seem children to a western eye.\n\nI plunged into this heated dreadful business with a passionate interest\nand went back to the Yacht Club only when the craving for air and a good\nbath and clean clothes and space and respect became unendurable. I waded\ndeep in labor, in this process of consuming humanity for gain, chasing\nmy facts through throbbing quivering sheds reeking of sweat and\nexcrement under the tall black-smoking chimneys,--chasing them in very\ntruth, because when we came prying into the mills after the hour when\nchild-labor should cease, there would be a shrill whistle, a patter of\nfeet and a cuffing and hiding of the naked little creatures we were\ntrying to rescue. They would be hidden under rugs, in boxes, in the most\nimpossible places, and we dragged them out scared and lying. Many of\nthem were perhaps seven years old at most; and the adults--men and women\nof fourteen that is to say--we could not touch at all, and they worked\nin that Indian heat, in a noisome air drenched with steam for fourteen\nand fifteen hours a day. And essential to that general impression is a\nmemory of a slim Parsi mill-manager luminously explaining the inherited\npassion for toil in the Indian weaver, and a certain bulky Hindu with a\nlemon-yellow turban and a strip of plump brown stomach showing between\nhis clothes, who was doing very well, he said, with two wives and five\nchildren in the mills.\n\nThat is my Bombay, that and the columns of crossed circles marking\nplague cases upon the corners of houses and a peculiar acrid smell, and\nthe polychromatic stir of crowded narrow streets between cliffs of\narchitecture with carved timbers and heavy ornamentations, into which\nthe sun strikes obliquely and lights a thousand vivid hues....\n\nBombay, the gateway of what silly people were still calling in those\ndays \"the immemorial East,\" Bombay, which is newer than Boston or New\nYork, Bombay which has grown beneath the Englishman's shadow out of a\nPortuguese fort in the last two hundred years....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 3\n\nI came out of these dark corners presently into the sunblaze of India. I\nwas now intensely interested in the whole question of employment and\nengaged in preparing matter for my first book, \"Enterprise and India,\"\nand therein you may read how I went first to Assam and then down to\nCeylon following up this perplexing and complicated business of human\nenslavement to toil, exercised by this great spectacle of human labor,\nand at once attracted by and stimulated by and dissatisfied with those\nsocialist generalizations that would make all this vast harsh spectacle\nof productive enterprise a kind of wickedness and outrage upon humanity.\nAnd behind and about the things I was looking for were other things for\nwhich I was not looking, that slowly came into and qualified the\nproblem. It dawned upon me by degrees that India is not so much one\ncountry as a vast spectacle of human development at every stage, in\ninfinite variety. One ranges between naked savages and the most\nsophisticated of human beings. I pursued my enquiries about great modern\nenterprises, about railway labor, canal labor, tea-planting, across vast\nstretches of country where men still lived, illiterate, agricultural,\nunprogressive and simple, as men lived before the first stirrings of\nrecorded history. One sees by the tanks of those mud-built villages\ngroups of women with brass vessels who are identical in pose and figure\nand quality with the women modelled in Tanagra figures, and the droning\nwall-wheel is the same that irrigated the fields of ancient Greece, and\nthe crops and beasts and all the life is as it was in Greece and Italy,\nPhoenicia and Judea before the very dawn of history.\n\nBy imperceptible degrees I came to realize that this matter of\nexpropriation and enslavement and control, which bulks so vastly upon\nthe modern consciousness, which the Socialists treat as though it was\nthe comprehensive present process of mankind, is no more than one aspect\nof an overlife that struggles out of a massive ancient and traditional\ncommon way of living, struggles out again and again--blindly and always\nso far with a disorderly insuccess....\n\nI began to see in their proper proportion the vast enduring normal human\nexistence, the peasant's agricultural life, unlettered, laborious and\nessentially unchanging on the one hand, and on the other those\nexcrescences of multitudinous city aggregation, those stormy excesses of\nproductive energy that flare up out of that life, establish for a time\ngreat unstable strangenesses of human living, palaces, cities, roads,\nempires, literatures, and then totter and fall back again into ruin. In\nIndia even more than about the Mediterranean all this is spectacular.\nThere the peasant goes about his work according to the usage of fifty\nthousand years. He has a primitive version of religion, a moral\ntradition, a social usage, closely adapted by countless years of trial\nand survival to his needs, and the whole land is littered with the\nvestiges and abandoned material of those newer, bolder, more\nexperimental beginnings, beginnings that merely began.\n\nIt was when I was going through the panther-haunted palaces of Akbar at\nFatehpur Sikri that I first felt how tremendously the ruins of the past\nmay face towards the future; the thing there is like a frozen wave that\nrose and never broke; and once I had caught that light upon things, I\nfound the same quality in all the ruins I saw, in Amber and Vijayanagar\nand Chitor, and in all that I have seen or heard of, in ancient Rome and\nancient Verona, in P\u00c3\u00a6stum and Cnossus and ancient Athens. None of these\nplaces was ever really finished and done with; the Basilicas of C\u00c3\u00a6sar\nand Constantine just as much as the baths and galleries and halls of\naudience at Fatehpur Sikri express not ends achieved but thwarted\nintentions of permanence. They embody repulse and rejection. They are\ntrials, abandoned trials, towards ends vaguely apprehended, ends felt\nrather than known. Even so was I moved by the Bruges-like emptinesses of\nPekin, in the vast pretensions of its Forbidden City, which are like a\ncry, long sustained, that at last dies away in a wail. I saw the place\nin 1905 in that slack interval after the European looting and before the\ngreat awakening that followed the Russo-Japanese war. Pekin in a century\nor so may be added in its turn to the list of abandoned endeavors.\nInsensibly the sceptre passes.... Nearer home than any of these places\nhave I imagined the same thing; in Paris it seemed to me I felt the\nfirst chill shadow of that same arrest, that impalpable ebb and\ncessation at the very crest of things, that voice which opposes to all\nthe hasty ambitions and gathering eagerness of men: \"It is not here, it\nis not yet.\"\n\nOnly the other day as I came back from Paris to this quiet place and\nwalked across the fields from the railway station to this house, I saw\nan old woman, a grandmother, a bent old crone with two children playing\nabout her as she cut grass by the wayside, and she cut it, except that\nher sickle was steel, exactly as old women were cutting grass before\nthere was writing, before the dawn of history, before men laid the first\nstones one upon the other of the first city that ever became a ruin....\n\nYou see Civilization has never yet existed, it has only continually and\nobstinately attempted to be. Our Civilization is but the indistinct\ntwilight before the dawn. It is still only a confused attempt, a\nflourish out of barbarism, and the normal life of men, the toiling\nearthy life of the field and the byre, goes on still like a stream that\nat once supports and carries to destruction the experimental ships of\nsome still imperfect inventor. India gives it all from first to last,\nand now the modern movement, the latest half-conscious struggle of the\nNew Thing in mankind, throws up Bombay and Calcutta, vast feverish\npustules upon the face of the peninsula, bridges the sacred rivers with\nhideous iron lattice-work and smears the sky of the dusty ruin-girdled\ncity of Delhi,--each ruin is the vestige of an empire,--with the black\nsmoke of factory chimneys.\n\nAltogether scattered over that sun-burnt plain there are the remains of\nfive or six extinguished Delhis, that played their dramas of frustration\nbefore the Delhi of the Great Mogul. This present phase of human\nliving--its symbol at Delhi is now, I suppose, a scaffold-bristling pile\nof neo-Georgian building--is the latest of the constructive synthetic\nefforts to make a newer and fuller life for mankind. Who dares call it\nthe last? I question myself constantly whether this life we live to-day,\nwhether that too, is more than a trial of these blind constructive\nforces, more universal perhaps, more powerful perhaps than any\npredecessor but still a trial, to litter the world with rusting material\nwhen the phase of recession recurs.\n\nBut yet I can never quite think that is so. This time, surely, it is\ndifferent. This time may indeed be the beginning of a permanent change;\nthis time there are new elements, new methods and a new spirit at work\nupon construction that the world has never known before. Mankind may be\nnow in the dawn of a fresh phase of living altogether. It is possible.\nThe forces of construction are proportionally gigantic. There was never\nso much clear and critical thought in the world as there is now, never\nso large a body of generally accessible knowledge and suggestion, never\nanything like the same breadth of outlook, the same universality of\nimaginative freedom. That is so in spite of infinite turmoil and\nconfusion. Moreover the effort now is less concentrated, less dramatic.\nThere is no one vital center to the modern movement which disaster can\nstrike or decay undermine. If Paris or New York slacken and grow dull\nand materialist, if Berlin and London conspire for a mutual destruction,\nTokio or Baku or Valparaiso or Christiania or Smyrna or Delhi will\nshelter and continue the onward impetus.\n\nAnd this time too it is not any one person, any one dynasty, any one\ncult or race which carries our destiny. Human thought has begun to free\nitself from individual entanglements and dramatic necessities and\naccidental standards. It becomes a collective mind, a collective will\ntowards achievement, greater than individuals or cities or kingdoms or\npeoples, a mind and will to which we all contribute and which none of us\nmay command nor compromise by our private errors. It ceases to be\naristocratic; it detaches itself from persons and takes possession of us\nall. We are involved as it grows free and dominant, we find ourselves,\nin spite of ourselves, in spite of quarrels and jealousies and\nconflicts, helping and serving in the making of a new world-city, a new\ngreater State above our legal States, in which all human life becomes a\nsplendid enterprise, free and beautiful, whose aptest symbol in all our\nworld is a huge Gothic Cathedral lit to flame by the sun, whose scheme\nis the towering conquest of the universe, whose every little detail is\nthe wrought-out effort of a human soul....\n\nSuch were the ideas that grew together in my mind as I went about India\nand the East, across those vast sunlit plains, where men and women still\ntoil in their dusty fields for a harsh living and live in doorless\nhovels on floors of trampled cow-dung, persecuted by a hundred hostile\nbeasts and parasites, caught and eaten by tigers and panthers as cats\neat mice, and grievously afflicted by periodic famine and pestilence,\neven as men and women lived before the dawn of history, for untold\ncenturies, for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 4\n\nHow strange we English seem in India, a little scattered garrison. Are\nwe anything more than accidental, anything more than the messenger-boy\nwho has brought the impetus of the new effort towards civilization\nthrough the gates of the East? Are we makers or just a means, casually\ntaken up and used by the great forces of God?\n\nI do not know, I have never been able to tell. I have never been able to\ndecide whether we are the greatest or the dullest of peoples.\n\nI think we are an imaginative people with an imagination at once\ngigantic, heroic and shy, and also we are a strangely restrained and\ndisciplined people who are yet neither subdued nor subordinated....\nThese are flat contradictions to state, and yet how else can one render\nthe paradox of the English character and this spectacle of a handful of\nmute, snobbish, not obviously clever and quite obviously ill-educated\nmen, holding together kingdoms, tongues and races, three hundred\nmillions of them, in a restless fermenting peace? Again and again in\nIndia I would find myself in little circles of the official\nEnglish,-supercilious, pretentious, conventional, carefully \"turned out\"\npeople, living gawkily, thinking gawkily, talking nothing but sport and\ngossip, relaxing at rare intervals into sentimentality and levity as\nmean as a banjo tune, and a kind of despairful disgust would engulf me.\nAnd then in some man's work, in some huge irrigation scheme, some feat\nof strategic foresight, some simple, penetrating realization of\ndeep-lying things, I would find an effect, as if out of a thickly rusted\nsheath one had pulled a sword and found it--flame....\n\nI recall one evening I spent at a little station in Bengal, between\nLucknow and Delhi, an evening given over to private theatricals. The\ntheatre was a huge tent, and the little roughly improvised stage was lit\nby a row of oil footlights and so small as barely to give a foothold for\nthe actors and actresses in the more crowded scenes. About me were the\ngreat people, the colonel's wife, a touring young man of family,\nofficers and the wife of the manager of the big sugar refinery close at\nhand. Behind were English of a more dubious social position, also\nconnected with the sugar refinery, a Eurasian family or so, very dressy\nand aggressive and terribly snubbed, and then I think various Portuguese\nand other nondescripts and groups of non-commissioned officers and men,\nsome with their wives. The play, admirably chosen, was that\ncrystallization of liberal Victorian snobbery, _Caste_, and I remember\nthere was a sub-current of amusement because the young officer who\nplayed--what _is_ the name of the hero's friend? I forget--had in the\nhaste of his superficiality adopted a moustache that would not keep on\nand an eyeglass that would not keep in.\n\nEverybody was acting very badly, nobody was word-perfect and a rasping\nprompter would not keep ahead as he ought to have done; the scenery and\nthe make-ups were daubs, and I was filled with amazement that having\nquite wantonly undertaken to do this thing these people could then do it\nso slackly. Then a certain sudden warmth in the applause about me\nquickened my attention, and I realized the satirical purport of drunken\nold father Eccles, and the moral intention of his son-in-law, the\nplumber. Between them they expressed the whole duty of the workingman as\nthe prosperous Victorians conceived it. He was to work hard always at\nany job he could find for any wages he could get, and if he didn't he\nwas a \"drunken shirker\" and the dupe of \"paid agitators.\" A comforting\nbut misleading doctrine. And here were these people a decade on in the\ntwentieth century, with Time, Death, and Judgment close upon them, still\neagerly applauding, eager to excuse their minds with this one-sided,\nungracious, old-fashioned nonsense, that has done so much to intensify\nthe deepening class antagonisms that strain us now at home almost to the\nbreaking point!\n\nHow amazingly, it seemed, those people didn't understand and wouldn't\nunderstand any class but their own, any race but their own, any usage\nother than their use! Covertly I surveyed the colonel's profile. It\nexpressed nothing but entire satisfaction with these disastrous\ninterpretations. What a weather-worn thought-free face that grizzled\nveteran showed the world!\n\nI was seized with a sudden curiosity to see how the private soldiers\nbehind me were taking old Eccles. I turned round to discover cropped\nheads and faces as expressionless as masks, and behind them dusky faces\nwatching very alertly, and then other dusky faces, Eurasians, inferiors,\nservants, natives.\n\nThen at a sharp edge the glare of our lighting ceased and the canvas\nwalls of our narrow world of illusion opened into a vast blue twilight.\nAt the opening stood two white-clad Sikhs, very, very still and\nattentive, watching the performance, and beyond them was a great space\nof sky over a dim profile of trees and roofs and a minaret, a sky\ndarkling down to the flushed red memory--such a short memory it is in\nIndia--of a day that had gone for ever.\n\nI remained staring at that for some time.\n\n\"Isn't old Eccles _good_?\" whispered the colonel's wife beside me, and\nrecalled me to the play....\n\nSomehow that picture of a narrow canvas tent in the midst of immensities\nhas become my symbol for the whole life of the governing English, the\nEnglish of India and Switzerland and the Riviera and the West End and\nthe public services....\n\nBut they are not England, they are not the English reality, which is a\nthing at once bright and illuminating and fitful, a thing humorous and\nwise and adventurous--Shakespeare, Dickens, Newton, Darwin, Nelson,\nBacon, Shelley--English names every one--like the piercing light of\nlanterns swinging and swaying among the branches of dark trees at night.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 5\n\nI went again to Ceylon to look into the conditions of Coolie\nimportation, and then I was going back into Assam once more, still in\nthe wake of indentured labor, when I chanced upon a misadventure. I had\nmy first and only experience of big game shooting in the Garo Hills, I\nwas clawed out of a tree by a wounded panther, he missed his hold and I\ngot back to my branch, but my shoulder was put out, my thigh was badly\ntorn, and my blood was poisoned by the wound. I had an evil\nuncomfortable time. My injury hampered me greatly, and for a while it\nseemed likely I should be permanently lamed. I had to keep to vehicles\nand reasonably good roads. I wound up my convalescence with a voyage to\nSingapore, and from thence I went on rather disconnectedly to a number\nof exploratory journeys--excursions rather than journeys--into China. I\ngot to Pekin and then suddenly faced back to Europe, returning overland\nthrough Russia.\n\nI wanted now to study the conditions of modern industrialism at its\nsources, and my disablement did but a little accelerate a return already\ndecided upon. I had got my conception of the East as a whole and of the\nshape of the historical process. I no longer felt adrift in a formless\nchaos of forces. I perceived now very clearly that human life is\nessentially a creative struggle out of the usage of immemorial years,\nthat the synthesis of our contemporary civilization is this creative\nimpulse rising again in its latest and greatest effort, the creative\nimpulse rising again, as a wave rises from the trough of its\npredecessors, out of the ruins of our parent system, imperial Rome. But\nthis time, and for the first time, the effort is world-wide, and China\nand Iceland, Patagonia and Central Africa all swing together with us to\nmake--or into another catastrophic failure to make--the Great State of\nmankind. All this I had now distinctly in my mind. The new process I\nperceive had gone further in the west; was most developed in the west.\nThe lighter end lifts first. So back I came away from the great body of\nmankind, which is Asia, to its head. And since I was still held by my\npromise from returning to England I betook myself first to the Pas de\nCalais and then to Belgium and thence into industrial Germany, to study\nthe socialistic movement at its sources.\n\nAnd I was beginning to see too very clearly by the time of my return\nthat what is confusedly called the labor problem is really not one\nproblem at all, but two. There is the old problem, the problem as old as\nZimbabwe and the pyramids, the declining problem, the problem of\norganizing masses of unskilled labor to the constructive ends of a Great\nState, and there is the new modification due to machinery, which has\nrendered unskilled labor and labor of a low grade of skill almost\nunnecessary to mankind, added coal, oil, wind and water, the elementary\nschool and the printing-press to our sources of power, and superseded\nthe ancient shepherding and driving of men by the possibility of their\nintelligent and willing co-operation. The two are still mixed in every\ndiscussion, even as they are mixed in the practice of life, but\ninevitably they will be disentangled. We break free from slavery, open\nor disguised, just as we illuminate and develop this disentanglement....\n\nI have long since ceased to trouble about the economics of human\nsociety. Ours are not economic but psychological difficulties. There is\nenough for everyone, and only a fool can be found to deny it. But our\nmethods of getting and making are still ruled by legal and social\ntraditions from the time before we had tapped these new sources of\npower, before there was more than enough for everyone, and when a bare\nsupply was only secured by jealous possession and unremitting toil. We\nhave no longer to secure enough by a stern insistence. We have come to a\nplenty. The problem now is to make that plenty go round, and _keep it\nenough_ while we do.\n\nOur real perplexities are altogether psychological. There are no valid\narguments against a great-spirited Socialism but this, that people will\nnot. Indolence, greed, meanness of spirit, the aggressiveness of\nauthority, and above all jealousy, jealousy for our pride and vanity,\njealousy for what we esteem our possessions, jealousy for those upon\nwhom we have set the heavy fetters of our love, a jealousy of criticism\nand association, these are the real obstacles to those brave large\nreconstructions, those profitable abnegations and brotherly feats of\ngenerosity that will yet turn human life--of which our individual lives\nare but the momentary parts--into a glad, beautiful and triumphant\nco-operation all round this sunlit world.\n\nIf but humanity could have its imagination touched----\n\nI was already beginning to see the great problem of mankind as indeed\nnothing other than a magnification of the little problem of myself, as a\nproblem in escape from grooves, from preoccupations and suspicions,\nprecautions and ancient angers, a problem of escape from these spiritual\nbeasts that prowl and claw, to a new generosity and a new breadth of\nview.\n\nFor all of us, little son, as for each of us, salvation is that. We have\nto get away from ourselves to a greater thing, to a giant's desire and\nan unending life, ours and yet not our own.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 6\n\nIt is a queer experience to be even for a moment in the grip of a great\nbeast. I had been put into the fork of a tree, so that I could shoot\nwith the big stem behind my back. The fork wasn't, I suppose, more than\na score of feet from the ground. It was a safe enough place from a\ntiger, and that is what we expected. We had been misled by our tracker,\nwho had mistaken the pugs of a big leopard for a tiger's,--they were\nover rocky ground for the most part and he had only the spoor of a\nchance patch of half-dried mud to go upon. The beast had killed a goat\nand was beaten out of a thicket near by me in which he had been lying\nup. The probability had seemed that he would go away along a tempting\nravine to where Captain Crosby, who was my host, awaited him; I, as the\namateur, was intended to be little more than a spectator. But he broke\nback towards the wing of the line of beaters and came across the sunlit\nrocks within thirty yards of my post.\n\nSeen going along in that way, flattened almost to the ground, he wasn't\na particularly impressive beast, and I shot at his shoulder as one might\nblaze away at a rabbit,--perhaps just a little more carefully, feeling\nas a Lord of Creation should who dispenses a merited death. I expected\nhim either to roll over or bolt.\n\nThen instantly he was coming in huge bounds towards me....\n\nHe came so rapidly that he was covered by the big limb of the tree on\nwhich I was standing until he was quite beneath me, and my second shot,\nwhich I thought in the instant must have missed him, was taken rapidly\nas he crouched to spring up the trunk.\n\nThen you know came a sort of astonishment, and I think,--because\nafterwards Crosby picked up a dropped cartridge at the foot of the\ntree--that I tried to reload. I believe I was completely incredulous\nthat the beast was going to have me until he actually got me. The thing\nwas too completely out of my imaginative picture. I don't believe I\nthought at all while he was coming up the tree. I merely noted how\nastonishingly he resembled an angry cat. Then he'd got my leg, he was\nhanging on to it first by two claws and then by one claw, and the whole\nweight of him was pulling me down. It didn't seem to be my leg. I wasn't\nfrightened, I felt absolutely nothing, I was amazed. I slipped, tried to\nget a hold on the tree trunk, felt myself being hauled down, and then\ngot my arm about the branch. I still clung to my unloaded gun as an\nimpoverished aristocrat might cling to his patent of nobility. That was,\nI felt, my answer for him yet.\n\nI suppose the situation lasted a fraction of a second, though it seemed\nto me to last an interminable time. Then I could feel my leggings rip\nand his claw go scoring deeply down my calf. That hurt in a kind of\npainless, impersonal interesting way. Was my leg coming off? Boot? The\nweight had gone, that enormous weight!\n\nHe'd missed his hold altogether! I heard his claws tear down the bark of\nthe tree and then his heavy, soft fall upon the ground.\n\nI achieved a cat-like celerity. In another second I was back in my fork\nreloading, my legs tucked up as tightly as possible.\n\nI peered down through the branches ready for him. He wasn't there. Not\nup the tree again?... Then I saw him making off, with a halting gait,\nacross the scorching rocks some thirty yards away, but I could not get\nmy gun into a comfortable position before he was out of sight behind a\nridge.... I wondered why the sunlight seemed to be flickering like an\nelectric light that fails, was somehow aware of blood streaming from my\nleg down the tree-stem; it seemed a torrent of blood, and there was a\nlong, loose ribbon of flesh very sickening to see; and then I fainted\nand fell out of the tree, bruising my arm and cheek badly and\ndislocating my shoulder in the fall.... Some of the beaters saw me fall,\nand brought Crosby in sufficient time to improvise a _torniquet_ and\nsave my life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE NINTH\n\nTHE SPIRIT OF THE NEW WORLD\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 1\n\nI met Rachel again in Germany through the devices of my cousin the\nF\u00c3\u00bcrstin Letzlingen. I had finished seeing what I wanted to see in\nWestphalia and I was preparing to go to the United States. There I\nthought I should be able to complete and round off that large view of\nthe human process I had been developing in my mind. But my departure was\ndelayed by an attack of influenza that I picked up at a Socialist\nCongress in Munich, and the dear Durchlaucht, hearing of this and having\nher own views of my destiny, descended upon me while I was still in bed\nthere, made me get up and carried me off in her car, to take care of me\nherself at her villa at Boppard, telling me nothing of any fellow-guests\nI might encounter.\n\nShe had a villa upon the Rhine under a hill of vineyards, where she\ndevoted herself--she was a widow--to matchmaking and belated regrets for\nthe childlessness that necessitated a perpetual borrowing of material\nfor her pursuit. She had a motor-car, a steam-launch, several rowing\nboats and canoes, a tennis-lawn, a rambling garden, a devious house and\na rapid mind, and in fact everything that was necessary for throwing\nyoung people together. She made her surprise seem easy and natural, and\nwith returning health I found myself already back upon my old footing of\nfriendly intimacy with Rachel.\n\nI found her a new and yet a familiar Rachel. She had grown up, she was\nno longer a schoolgirl, crystalline clear with gleams of emotion and\nunderstanding, and what she had lost in transparency she had gained in\ndepth. And she had become well-informed, she had been reading very\nwidely and well, I could see, and not simply reading but talking and\nlistening and thinking. She showed a vivid interest in the current of\nhome politics,--at that time the last government of Mr. Balfour was\nebbing to its end and my old Transvaal friends, the Chinese coolies,\nwere to avenge themselves on their importers. The Tariff Reformers my\nfather detested were still struggling to unseat the Premier from his\nleadership of Conservatism....\n\nIt was queer to hear once more, after my Asiatic wanderings and\ndreamings, those West-End dinner-table politics, those speculations\nabout \"Winston's\" future and the possibility of Lloyd George or Ramsay\nMacdonald or Macnamara taking office with the Liberals and whether there\nmight not ultimately be a middle party in which Haldane and Balfour,\nGrey and the Cecils could meet upon common ground. It seemed now not\nonly very small but very far off. She told me too of the huge popularity\nof King Edward. He had proved to be interested, curious, understanding\nand clever, an unexpectedly successful King. She described how he was\nbreaking out of the narrow official limits that had kept his mother in a\nkind of social bandbox, extending his solvent informality of\nfriendliness to all sorts of men. He had won the heart of Will Crooks,\nthe labor member for Poplar, for example, made John Burns a social\nsuccess and warmed all France for England.\n\nI surveyed this novel picture of the English throne diffusing\namiability.\n\n\"I suppose it's what the throne ought to do,\" said Rachel. \"If it can't\nbe inspiration, at any rate it can tolerate and reconcile and take the\nill-bred bitterness out of politics.\"\n\n\"My father might have said that.\"\n\n\"I got that from your father,\" she said; and added after a momentary\npause, \"I go over and talk to him.\"\n\n\"You talk to my father!\"\n\n\"I like to. Or rather I listen and take it in. I go over in the\nafternoon. I go sometimes twice or three times a week.\"\n\n\"That's kind of you.\"\n\n\"Not at all. You see---- It sounds impudent, I know, for a girl to say\nso, but we've so many interests in common.\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 2\n\nI was more and more interested by Rachel as the days went on. A man must\nbe stupid who does not know that a woman is happy in his presence, and\nfor two years now and more I had met no one with a very strong personal\nfeeling for me. And quite apart from that, her mind was extraordinarily\ninteresting to me because it was at once so active and so clear and so\nlimited by her entirely English circumstances. She had the prosperous\nEnglish outlook. She didn't so much see the wide world as get glimpses\nof it through the tangle of Westminster and of West End and week-end\nlimitations. She wasn't even aware of that greater unprosperous England,\nalready sulking and darkling outside her political world, that greater\nEngland which was presently to make its first audible intimations of\ndiscontent in that remarkable anti-climax to King George's Coronation,\nthe Railway Strike. India for her was the land of people's cousins,\nGermany and the German Dreadnoughts bulked far larger, and all the\ntremendous gathering forces of the East were beyond the range of her\nimagination. I set myself to widen her horizons.\n\nI told her something of the intention and range of my travels, and\nsomething of the views that were growing out of their experiences.\n\nI have a clear little picture in my mind of an excursion we made to that\nhuge national Denkmal which rears its head out of the amiable vineyards\nof Assmannshausen and Rudesheim over against Bingen. We landed at the\nformer place, went up its little funicular to eat our lunch and drink\nits red wine at the pleasant inn above, and then strolled along through\nthe woods to the monument.\n\nThe F\u00c3\u00bcrstin fell behind with her unwilling escort, a newly arrived\nmedical student from England, a very pleasant youngster named Berwick,\nwho was all too obviously anxious to change places with me. She devised\ndelays, and meanwhile I, as yet unaware of the state of affairs, went on\nwith Rachel to that towering florid monument with its vast gesticulating\nGermania, which triumphs over the conquered provinces.\n\nWe fell talking of war and the passions and delusions that lead to war.\nRachel's thoughts were strongly colored by those ideas of a natural\nrivalry between Germany and England and of a necessary revenge for\nFrance which have for nearly forty years diverted the bulk of European\nthought and energy to the mere waste of military preparations. I jarred\nwith an edifice of preconceptions when I scoffed and scolded at these\nassumptions.\n\n\"Our two great peoples are disputing for the leadership of the world,\" I\nsaid, \"and meanwhile the whole world sweeps past us. We're drifting into\na quarrelsome backwater.\"\n\nI began to tell of the fermentation and new beginnings that were\neverywhere perceptible throughout the East, of the vast masses of human\nability and energy that were coming into action in China and India, of\nthe unlimited future of both North and South America, of the mere\naccidentalness of the European advantage. \"History,\" I said, \"is already\nshifting the significance out of Western Europe altogether, and we\nEnglish cannot see it; we can see no further than Berlin, and these\nGermans can think of nothing better than to taunt the French with such\ntawdry effigies as _this_! Europe goes on to-day as India went on in the\neighteenth century, making aimless history. And the sands of opportunity\nrun and run....\"\n\nI shrugged my shoulders and we stood for a little while looking down on\nthe shining crescent of the Rhine.\n\n\"Suppose,\" said Rachel, \"that someone were to say that--in the House.\"\n\n\"The House,\" I said, \"doesn't hear things at my pitch. Bat outcries. Too\nshrill altogether.\"\n\n\"It might. If _you_----\"\n\nShe halted, hesitated for a moment on the question and asked abruptly:\n\n\"When are you coming back to England, Mr. Stratton?\"\n\n\"Certainly not for six months,\" I said.\n\nA movement of her eyes made me aware of the F\u00c3\u00bcrstin and Berwick emerging\nfrom the trees. \"And then?\" asked Rachel.\n\nI didn't want to answer that question, in which the personal note\nsounded so clearly. \"I am going to America to see America,\" I said, \"and\nAmerica may be rather a big thing to see.\"\n\n\"You must see it?\"\n\n\"I want to be sure of it--as something comprehensive. I want to get a\ngeneral effect of it....\"\n\nRachel hesitated, looked back to measure the distance of the F\u00c3\u00bcrstin and\nher companion and put her question again, but this time with a\nsignificance that did not seem even to want to hide itself. \"_Then_ will\nyou come back?\" she said.\n\nHer face flamed scarlet, but her eyes met mine boldly. Between us there\nwas a flash of complete understanding.\n\nMy answer, if it was lame and ungallant to such a challenge, was at\nleast perfectly honest. \"I can't make up my mind,\" I said. \"I've been\nnear making plans--taking steps.... Something holds me back....\"\n\nI had no time for an explanation.\n\n\"I can't make up my mind,\" I repeated.\n\nShe stood for a moment rather stiffly, staring away towards the blue\nhills of Alsace.\n\nThen she turned with a smiling and undisturbed countenance to the\nF\u00c3\u00bcrstin. Her crimson had given place to white. \"The triumph of it,\" she\nsaid with a slight gesture to the flamboyant Teutonism that towered\nover us, and boldly repeating words I had used scarcely five minutes\nbefore, \"makes me angry. They conquered--ungraciously....\"\n\nShe had overlooked something in her effort to seem entirely\nself-possessed. She collapsed. \"My dear!\" she cried,--\"I forgot!\"\n\n\"Oh! I'm only a German by marriage!\" cried the F\u00c3\u00bcrstin. \"And I can\nassure you I quite understand--about the triumph of it....\" She surveyed\nthe achievement of her countrymen. \"It is--ungracious. But indeed it's\nonly a sort of artlessness if you see the thing properly.... It's not\nvulgarity--it's childishness.... They've hardly got over it yet--their\nintense astonishment at being any good at war.... That large throaty\nVictory! She's not so militant as she seems. She's too plump.... Of\ncourse what a German really appreciates is nutrition. But I quite agree\nwith you both.... I'm beginning to want my tea, Mr. Stratton....\nRachel!\"\n\nHer eyes had been on Rachel as she chattered. The girl had turned to the\ndistant hills again, and had forgotten even to pretend to listen to the\nanswer she had evoked. Now she came back sharply to the sound of her\nname.\n\n\"Tea?\" said the F\u00c3\u00bcrstin.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Rachel. \"Yes. Yes, certainly. Rather. Tea.\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 3\n\nIt was clear to me that after that I must as people say \"have things\nout\" with Rachel. But before I could do anything of the sort the\nF\u00c3\u00bcrstin pounced upon me. She made me sit up that night after her other\nguests had gone to their rooms, in the cosy little turret apartment she\ncalled her study and devoted to the reading of whatever was most\nnotorious in contemporary British fiction. \"Sit down,\" said she, \"by the\nfire in that chair there and tell me all about it. It's no good your\npretending you don't know what I mean. What are you up to with her, and\nwhy don't you go straight to your manifest destiny as a decent man\nshould?\"\n\n\"Because manifestly it isn't my destiny,\" I said.\n\n\"Stuff,\" said the F\u00c3\u00bcrstin.\n\n\"You know perfectly well why I am out of England.\"\n\n\"Everybody knows--except of course quite young persons who are being\ncarefully brought up.\"\n\n\"Does _she_ know?\"\n\n\"She doesn't seem to.\"\n\n\"Well, that's what I want to know.\"\n\n\"Need she know?\"\n\n\"Well, it does seem rather essential----\"\n\n\"I suppose if you think so----\"\n\n\"Will you tell her?\"\n\n\"Tell her yourself, if she must be told. Down there in Surrey, she\n_must_ have seen things and heard things. But I don't see that she wants\na lot of ancient history.\"\n\n\"If it is ancient history!\"\n\n\"Oh! two years and a half,--it's an Era.\"\n\nI made no answer to that, but sat staring into the fire while my cousin\nwatched my face. At length I made my confession. \"I don't think it is\nancient history at all,\" I said. \"I think if I met Mary again now----\"\n\n\"You mean Lady Mary Justin?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"It would be good for your mind if you remembered to call her by her\nproper name.... You think if you met her again you two would begin to\ncarry on. But you see,--you aren't going to meet her. Everybody will see\nthat doesn't happen.\"\n\n\"I mean that I---- Well----\"\n\n\"You'd better not say it. Besides, it's nonsense. I doubt if you've\ngiven her a thought for weeks and weeks.\"\n\n\"Until I came here perhaps that was almost nearly true. But you've\nstirred me up, sweet cousin, and old things, old memories and habits\nhave come to the surface again. Mary wrote herself over my life--in all\nsorts of places.... I can't tell you. I've never talked of her to\nanyone. I'm not able, very well, to talk about my feelings.... Perhaps a\nman of my sort--doesn't love twice over.\"\n\nI disregarded a note of dissent from my cousin. \"That was all so magic,\nall my youth, all my hope, all the splendid adventure of it. Why should\none pretend?... I'm giving none of that to Rachel. It isn't there any\nmore to give....\"\n\n\"One would think,\" remarked the F\u00c3\u00bcrstin, \"there was no gift of healing.\"\n\nShe waited for me to speak, and then irritated by my silence struck at\nme sharply with that wicked little tongue of hers.\n\n\"Do you think that Lady Mary Justin thinks of you--as you think of her?\nDo you think she hasn't settled down?\"\n\nI looked up at her quickly.\n\n\"She's just going to have a second child,\" the F\u00c3\u00bcrstin flung out.\n\nYes, that did astonish me. I suppose my face showed it.\n\n\"That girl,\" said the F\u00c3\u00bcrstin, \"that clean girl would have sooner\ndied--ten thousand deaths.... And she's never--never been anything to\nyou.\"\n\nI think that for an instant she had been frightened at her own words.\nShe was now quite angry and short of breath. She had contrived a rapid\nindignation against Mary and myself.\n\n\"I didn't know Mary had had any child at all,\" I said.\n\n\"This makes two,\" said the F\u00c3\u00bcrstin, and held up a brace of fingers,\n\"with scarcely a year and a half between them. Not much more anyhow....\nIt was natural, I suppose. A natural female indecency. I don't blame\nher. When a woman gives in she ought to do it thoroughly. But I don't\nsee that it leaves _you_ much scope for philandering, Stephen, does\nit?... And there you are, and here is Rachel. And why don't you make a\nclean job of your life?...\"\n\n\"I didn't understand.\"\n\n\"I wonder what you imagined.\"\n\nI reflected. \"I wonder what I did. I suppose I thought of Mary--just as\nI had left her--always.\"\n\nI remained with my mind filled with confused images of Mary, memories,\nastonishment....\n\nI perceived the F\u00c3\u00bcrstin was talking.\n\n\"Maundering about,\" she was saying, \"like a huntsman without a horse....\nYou've got work to do--blood in your veins. I'm not one of your ignorant\nwomen, Stephen. You ought to have a wife....\"\n\n\"Rachel's too good,\" I said, at the end of a pause and perceiving I had\nto say something, \"to be that sort of wife.\"\n\n\"No woman's too good for a man,\" said the F\u00c3\u00bcrstin von Letzlingen with\nconviction. \"It's what God made her for.\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 4\n\nMy visit to Boppard was drawing to an end before I had a clear\nopportunity to have things out with Rachel. It was in a little garden,\nunder the very shadow of that gracious cathedral at Worms, the sort of\nlittle garden to which one is admitted by ringing a bell and tipping a\ncustodian. I think Worms is in many respects one of the most beautiful\ncathedrals I have ever seen, so perfectly proportioned, so delicately\nfaded, so aloof, so free from pride or presumption, and it rises over\nthis green and flowery peace, a towering, lithe, light brown, sunlit,\neasy thing, as unconsciously and irrelevantly splendid as a tall ship in\nthe evening glow under a press of canvas. We looked up at it for a time\nand then went on with the talk to which we had been coming slowly since\nthe F\u00c3\u00bcrstin had packed us off for it, while she went into the town with\nBerwick to buy toys for her gatekeeper's children. I had talked about\nmyself, and the gradual replacement of my ambition to play a part in\nimperial politics by wider intentions. \"You know,\" I asked abruptly,\n\"why I left England?\"\n\nShe thought through the briefest of pauses. \"No,\" she decided at last.\n\n\"I made love,\" I said, \"to Lady Mary Justin, and we were found out. We\ncouldn't go away together----\"\n\n\"Why not?\" she interjected.\n\n\"It was impossible.\"\n\nFor some moments neither of us spoke. \"Something,\" she said, and then,\n\"Some vague report,\" and left these fragments to be her reply.\n\n\"We were old playmates; we were children together. We\nhave--something--that draws us to each other. She--she made a mistake in\nmarrying. We were both very young and the situation was difficult. And\nthen afterwards we were thrown together.... But you see that has made a\ngreat difference to my life; it's turned me off the rails on which men\nof my sort usually run. I've had to look to these other things....\nThey've become more to me than to most people if only because of\nthat....\"\n\n\"You mean these ideas of yours--learning as much as you can about the\nworld, and then doing what you can to help other people to a better\nunderstanding.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.\n\n\"And that--will fill your life.\"\n\n\"It ought to.\"\n\n\"I suppose it ought. I suppose--you find--it does.\"\n\n\"Don't you think it ought to fill my life?\"\n\n\"I wondered if it did.\"\n\n\"But why shouldn't it?\"\n\n\"It's so--so cold.\"\n\nMy questioning silence made her attempt to explain.\n\n\"One wants life more beautiful than that,\" she said. \"One wants----\nThere are things one needs, things nearer one.\"\n\nWe became aware of a jangling at the janitor's bell. Our opportunity for\ntalk was slipping away. And we were both still undecided, both\nblunderingly nervous and insecure. We were hurried into clumsy phrases\nthat afterwards we would have given much to recall.\n\n\"But how could life be more beautiful,\" I said, \"than when it serves big\nhuman ends?\"\n\nHer brows were knit. She seemed to be listening for the sound of the\nunlocking gate.\n\n\"But,\" she said, and plunged, \"one wants to be loved. Surely one needs\nthat.\"\n\n\"You see, for me--that's gone.\"\n\n\"Why should it be gone?\"\n\n\"It is. One doesn't begin again. I mean--myself. _You_--can. You've\nnever begun. Not when you've loved--loved really.\" I forced that on her.\nI over emphasized. \"It was real love, you know; the real thing.... I\ndon't mean the mere imaginative love, blindfold love, but love that\nsees.... I want you to understand that. I loved--altogether....\"\n\nAcross the lawn under its trim flowering-trees appeared Berwick loaded\nwith little parcels, and manifestly eager to separate us, and the\nF\u00c3\u00bcrstin as manifestly putting on the drag.\n\n\"There's a sort of love,\" I hurried, \"that doesn't renew itself ever.\nDon't let yourself believe it does. Something else may come in its\nplace, but that is different. It's youth,--a wonderful newness.... Look\nat that youngster. _He_ can love you like that. I've watched him. He\ndoes. You know he does....\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, as hurriedly; \"but then, you see, I don't love him.\"\n\n\"You don't?\"\n\n\"I can't.\"\n\n\"But he's such a fresh clean human being----\"\n\n\"That's not all,\" said Rachel. \"That's not all.... You don't\nunderstand.\"\n\nThe two drew near. \"It is so hard to explain,\" she said. \"Things that\none hardly sees for oneself. Sometimes it seems one cannot help oneself.\nYou can't choose. You are taken....\" She seemed about to say something\nmore, and stopped and bit her lip.\n\nIn another moment I was standing up, and the F\u00c3\u00bcrstin was calling to us\nacross ten feet of space. \"Such amoosin' little toyshops. We've got a\nheap of things. Just look at him!\"\n\nHe smiled over his load with anxious eyes upon our faces.\n\n\"Ten separate parcels,\" he said, appealing for Rachel's sympathy. \"I'm\ndoing my best not to complain.\"\n\nAnd rather adroitly he contrived to let two of them slip, and captured\nRachel to assist him.\n\nHe didn't relinquish her again.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 5\n\nThe F\u00c3\u00bcrstin and I followed them along the broad, pleasant, tree-lined\nstreet towards the railway station.\n\n\"A boy of that age ought not to marry a girl of that age,\" said the\nF\u00c3\u00bcrstin, breaking a silence.\n\nI didn't answer.\n\n\"Well?\" she said, domineering.\n\n\"My dear cousin,\" I said, \"I know all that you have in your mind. I\nadmit--I covet her. You can't make me more jealous than I am. She's\nclean and sweet--it is marvellous how the God of the rest of the world\ncan have made a thing so brave and honest and wonderful. She's better\nthan flowers. But I think I'm going away to-night, nevertheless.\"\n\n\"You don't mean you're going to carry chivalry to the point of giving\nthat boy a chance--for he hasn't one while you're about.\"\n\n\"No. You see--I want to give Rachel a chance. You know as well as I\ndo--the things in my mind.\"\n\n\"That you've got to forget.\"\n\n\"That I don't forget.\"\n\n\"That you're bound in honor to forget. And who could help you better?\"\n\n\"I'm going,\" I said and then, wrathfully, \"If you think I want to use\nRachel as a sort of dressing--for my old sores----\"\n\nI left the sentence unfinished.\n\n\"Oh _nonsense_!\" cried the F\u00c3\u00bcrstin, and wouldn't speak to me again until\nwe got to that entirely Teutonic \"art\" station that is not the least\namong the sights of Worms.\n\n\"Sores, indeed!\" said the F\u00c3\u00bcrstin presently, as we walked up the end of\nthe platform.\n\n\"There's nothing,\" said the F\u00c3\u00bcrstin, with an unusual note of petulance,\n\"she'd like better.\"\n\n\"I can't think what men are coming to,\" she went on. \"You're in love\nwith her, or you wouldn't be so generous. And she's head over heels with\nyou. And here you are! I'll give you one more chance----\"\n\n\"I won't take it,\" I interrupted. \"It isn't fair. I tell you I won't\ntake it. I'll go two days earlier to prevent you. Unless you promise\nme---- Of course I see how things are with her. She's not a sphinx. But\nit isn't fair. It isn't. Not to her, or to him--or myself. _He's_ got\nsome claims. He's got more right to her than I....\"\n\n\"A boy like that! No man has any rights about women--until he's thirty.\nAnd as for me and all the pains _I've_ taken---- Oh! I _hate_ Worms.\nDust and ashes! Well here thank heaven! comes the train. If nothing else\ncould stir you, Stephen, at least I could have imagined some decent\nimpulse of gratitude to me. Stephen, you're disgusting. You've\nabsolutely spoilt this trip for me--absolutely. When only a little\nreasonableness on your part---- Oh!\"\n\nShe left her sentence unfinished.\n\nBerwick and I had to make any conversation that was needed on the way\nback to Boppard. Rachel did not talk and the F\u00c3\u00bcrstin did not want to.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 6\n\nDirectly I had parted from Rachel's questioning eyes I wanted to go back\nto them. It seems to me now that all the way across to America, in that\nmagnificent German liner I joined at Hamburg, I was thinking in confused\nalternations of her and of Mary. There are turns of thought that still\nbring back inseparably with them the faint echo of the airs of the\nexcellent but industrious band that glorified our crossing.\n\nI had been extraordinarily shocked and concerned at the thought of Mary\nbearing children. It is a grotesque thing to confess but I had never let\nmyself imagine the possibility of such a thing for her who had been so\nimmensely mine....\n\nWe are the oddest creatures, little son, beasts and barbarians and\nbrains, neither one nor the other but all confusedly, and here was I who\nhad given up Mary and resigned her and freed myself from her as I\nthought altogether, cast back again into my old pit by the most obvious\nand necessary consequence of her surrender and mine. And it's just there\nand in that relation that we men and women are so elaborately insecure.\nWe try to love as equals and behave as equals and concede a level\nfreedom, and then comes a crisis,--our laboriously contrived edifice of\nliberty collapses and we perceive that so far as sex goes the woman\nremains to the man no more than a possession--capable of loyalty or\ntreachery.\n\nThere, still at that barbaric stage, the situation stands. You see I had\nalways wanted to own Mary, and always she had disputed that. That is our\nwhole story, the story of an instinctive subjugation struggling against\na passionate desire for fellowship. She had denied herself to me, taken\nherself away; that much I could endure; but now came this blazing fact\nthat showed her as it seemed in the most material and conclusive\nway--overcome. I had storms of retrospective passion at the thoroughness\nof her surrender.... Yes, and that's in everyone of us,--in everyone. I\nwonder if in all decent law-abiding London there lives a single healthy\nadult man who has not at times longed to trample and kill....\n\nFor once I think the F\u00c3\u00bcrstin miscalculated consequences. I think I\nshould have engaged myself to Rachel before I went to America if it had\nnot been for the F\u00c3\u00bcrstin's revelation, but this so tore me that I could\nno longer go on falling in love again, naturally and sweetly. No man\nfalls in love if he has just been flayed.... I could no longer think of\nRachel except as a foil to Mary. I was moved to marry her by a new set\nof motives; to fling her so to speak in Mary's face, and from the fierce\nvulgarity of that at least I recoiled--and let her go as I have told\nyou.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 7\n\nI had thought all that was over.\n\nI remember my struggles to recover my peace.\n\nI remember how very late one night I went up to the promenade deck to\nsmoke a cigar before turning in. It was a warm moonlight night. The\nbroad low waves of ebony water that went seething past below, foamed\nluminous and were streaked and starred with phosphorescence. The\nrecumbent moon, past its full and sinking westward, seemed bigger than I\nhad ever seen it before, and the roundness of the watery globe was\nmanifest about the edge of the sky. One had that sense so rare on land,\nso common in the night at sea, of the world as a conceivable sphere, and\nof interstellar space as of something clear and close at hand.\n\nThere came back to me again that feeling I had lost for a time in\nGermany of being not myself but Man consciously on his little planet\ncommuning with God.\n\nBut my spirit was saying all the time, \"I am still in my pit, in my pit.\nAfter all I am still in my pit.\"\n\nAnd then there broke the answer on my mind, that all our lives we must\nstruggle out of our pits, that to struggle out of our pit is this life,\nthere is no individual life but that, and that there comes no escape\nhere, no end to that effort, until the release of death. Continually or\nfrequently we may taste salvation, but never may we achieve it while we\nare things of substance. Each moment in our lives we come to the test\nand are lost again or saved again. To be assured of one's security is to\nforget and fall away.\n\nAnd standing at the rail with these thoughts in my mind, suddenly I\nprayed....\n\nI remember how the engine-throbs beat through me like the beating of a\nheart, and that far below, among the dim lights that came up from the\nemigrants in the steerage, there was a tinkling music as I prayed and a\nman's voice singing a plaintive air in some strange Slavonic tongue.\n\nThat voice of the invisible singer and the spirit of the unknown\nsong-maker and the serenity of the sky, they were all, I perceived, no\nmore and no less than things in myself that I did not understand. They\nwere out beyond the range of understanding. And yet they fell into the\ncompletest harmony that night with all that I seemed to understand....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 8\n\nThe onset of New York was extraordinarily stimulating to me. I write\nonset. It is indeed that. New York rides up out of the waters, a cliff\nof man's making; its great buildings at a distance seem like long\nChinese banners held up against the sky. From Sandy Hook to the great\nlanding stages and the swirling hooting traffic of the Hudson River\nthere fails nothing in that magnificent crescendo of approach.\n\nAnd New York keeps the promise of its first appearance. There is no\nsuch fulness of life elsewhere in all the world. The common man in the\nstreets is a bigger common man than any Old World city can show,\nphysically bigger; there is hope in his eyes and a braced defiance. New\nYork may be harsh and blusterous and violent, but there is a breeze from\nthe sea and a breeze of fraternity in the streets, and the Americans of\nall peoples in the world are a nation of still unbroken men.\n\nI went to America curious, balancing between hope and scepticism. The\nEuropean world is full of the criticism of America, and for the matter\nof that America too is full of it; hostility and depreciation\nprevail,--overmuch, for in spite of rawness and vehemence and a scum of\nblatant, oh! quite asinine folly, the United States of America remains\nthe greatest country in the world and the living hope of mankind. It is\nthe supreme break with the old tradition; it is the freshest and most\nvaliant beginning that has ever been made in human life.\n\nHere was the antithesis of India; here were no peasants whatever, no\ntraditional culture, no castes, no established differences (except for\nthe one schism of color); this amazing place had never had a famine,\nnever a plague; here were no temples and no priesthoods dominating the\nlives of the people,--old Trinity church embedded amidst towering\nsky-scrapers was a symbol for as much as they had of all that; and here\ntoo there was no crown, no affectations of an ancient loyalty, no\nvisible army, no traditions of hostility, for the old defiance of\nBritain is a thing now ridiculous and dead; and everyone I met had an\nair as if he knew that to-morrow must be different from to-day and\ndifferent and novel and remarkable by virtue of himself and such as\nhimself.\n\nI went about New York, with the incredulous satisfaction of a man who\nhas long doubted, to find that after all America was coming true. The\nvery clatter pleased me, the crowds, the camp-like slovenliness, a\ndisorder so entirely different from the established and accepted\nuntidiness of China or India. Here was something the old world had never\nshown me, a new enterprise, a fresh vigor. In the old world there is\nChange, a mighty wave now of Change, but it drives men before it as if\nit were a power outside them and not in them; they do not know, they do\nnot believe; but here the change is in the very blood and spirit of\nmankind. They breathe it in even before the launch has brought their\nfeet to Ellis Island soil. In six months they are Americanized. Does it\nmatter that a thing so gigantic should be a little coarse and blundering\nin detail, if this stumbling giant of the new time breaks a gracious\nrelic or so in his eager clutch and treads a little on the flowers?\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 9\n\nAnd in this setting of energy and activity, towering city life and\nbracing sea breezes, I met Gidding again, whom I had last seen departing\ninto Egypt to look more particularly at the prehistoric remains and the\ntemples of the first and second dynasty at Abydos. It was at a\ndinner-party, one of those large gatherings that welcome interesting\nvisitors. It wasn't, of course, I who was the centre of interest, but a\ndistinguished French portrait painter; I was there as just any guest. I\nhadn't even perceived Gidding until he came round to me in that\nprecious gap of masculine intercourse that ensues upon the departure of\nthe ladies. That gap is one of the rare opportunities for conversation\nmen get in America.\n\n\"I don't know whether you will remember me,\" he said, \"but perhaps you\nremember Crete--in the sunrise.\"\n\n\"And no end of talk afterwards,\" I said, grasping his hand, \"no end--for\nwe didn't half finish. Did you have a good time in Egypt?\"\n\n\"I'm not going to talk to you about Egypt,\" said Gidding. \"I'm through\nwith ruins. I'm going to ask you--you know what I'm going to ask you.\"\n\n\"What I think of America. It's the same inevitable question. I think\neverything of it. It's the stepping-off place. I've come here at last,\nbecause it matters most.\"\n\n\"That's what we all want to believe,\" said Gidding. \"That's what we want\nyou to tell us.\"\n\nHe reflected. \"It's immense, isn't it, perfectly immense? But---- I am\nafraid at times we're too disposed to forget just what it's all about.\nWe've got to be reminded. That, you know, is why we keep on asking.\"\n\nHe went on to question me where I had been, what I had done, what I made\nof things. He'd never, he said, forgotten our two days' gossip in the\nLevant, and all the wide questions about the world and ourselves that we\nhad broached then and left so open. I soon found myself talking very\nfreely to him. I am not a ready or abundant talker, but Gidding has the\nknack of precipitating my ideas. He is America to my Europe, and at his\ntouch all that has been hanging in concentrated solution in my mind\ncomes crystallizing out. He has to a peculiar degree that directness\nand simplicity which is the distinctive American quality. I tried to\nexplain to his solemnly nodding head and entirely intelligent eyes just\nexactly what I was making of things, of the world, of humanity, of\nmyself....\n\nIt was an odd theme for two men to attempt after dinner, servants\nhovering about them, their two faces a little flushed by wine and good\neating, their keen interest masked from the others around them by a\ngossiping affectation, their hands going out as they talked for matches\nor cigarette, and before we had gone further than to fling out a few\nintimations to each other our colloquy was interrupted by our host\nstanding up and by the general stir that preluded our return to feminine\nsociety. \"We've got more to say than this,\" said Gidding. \"We've got to\n_talk_.\" He brought out a little engagement book that at once drew out\nmine in response. And a couple of days after, we spent a morning and\nafternoon together and got down to some very intimate conversation. We\nmotored out to lunch at a place called Nyack, above the Palisades, we\ncrossed on a ferry to reach it, and we visited the house of Washington\nIrving near Yonkers on our way.\n\nI've still a vivid picture in my mind of the little lawn at Irvington\nthat looks out upon the rushing steel of Hudson River, where Gidding\nopened his heart to me. I can see him now as he leant a little forward\nover the table, with his wrists resting upon it, his long clean-shaven\nface very solemn and earnest and grey against the hard American sunlight\nin the greenery about us, while he told me in that deliberate American\nvoice of his and with the deliberate American solemnity, of his desire\nto \"do some decent thing with life.\"\n\nHe was very anxious to set himself completely before me, I remember, on\nthat occasion. There was a peculiar mental kinship between us that even\nthe profound differences of our English and American trainings could not\nmask. And now he told me almost everything material about his life. For\nthe first time I learnt how enormously rich he was, not only by reason\nof his father's acquisitions, but also because of his own almost\ninstinctive aptitude for business. \"I've got,\" he said, \"to begin with,\nwhat almost all men spend their whole lives in trying to get. And it\namounts to nothing. It leaves me with life like a blank sheet of paper,\nand nothing in particular to write on it.\"\n\n\"You know,\" he said, \"it's--exasperating. I'm already half-way to\nthree-score and ten, and I'm still wandering about wondering what to do\nwith this piece of life God has given me....\"\n\nHe had \"lived\" as people say, he had been in scrapes and scandals,\ntasted to the full the bitter intensities of the personal life; he had\ncome by a different route to the same conclusions as myself, was as\nanxious as I to escape from memories and associations and feuds and that\nexcessive vividness of individual feeling which blinds us to the common\nhumanity, the common interest, the gentler, larger reality, which lies\nbehind each tawdrily emphatic self....\n\n\"It's a sort of inverted homoeopathy I want,\" he said. \"The big thing to\ncure the little thing....\"\n\nBut I will say no more of that side of our friendship, because the ideas\nof it are spread all through this book from the first page to the\nlast.... What concerns me now is not our sympathy and agreement, but\nthat other aspect of our relations in which Gidding becomes impulse and\nurgency. \"Seeing we have these ideas,\" said he,--\"and mind you there\nmust be others who have them or are getting to them, for nobody thinks\nall alone in this world,--seeing we have these ideas what are we going\nto _do_?\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 10\n\nThat meeting was followed by another before I left New York, and\npresently Gidding joined me at Denver, where I was trying to measure the\ntrue significance of a labor paper called _The Appeal to Reason_ that,\nin spite of a rigid boycott by the ordinary agencies for news\ndistribution went out in the middle west to nearly half a million\nsubscribers, and was filled with such a fierceness of insurrection\nagainst labor conditions, such a hatred, blind and impassioned, as I had\nnever known before. Gidding remained with me there and came back with me\nto Chicago, where I wanted to see something of the Americanization of\nthe immigrant, and my survey of America, the social and economic problem\nof America, resolved itself more and more into a conference with him.\n\nThere is no more fruitless thing in the world than to speculate how life\nwould have gone if this thing or that had not happened. Yet I cannot\nhelp but wonder how far I might have travelled along the lines of my\npresent work if I had gone to America and not met Gidding, or if I had\nmet him without visiting America. The man and his country are\ninextricably interwoven in my mind. Yet I do think that his simplicity\nand directness, his force of initiative that turned me from a mere\nenquirer into an active writer and organizer, are qualities less his in\nparticular than America's in general. There is in America a splendid\ncrudity, a directness that cleared my spirit as a bracing wind will\nsweep the clouds from mountain scenery. Compared with our older\ncontinents America is mankind stripped for achievement. So many things\nare not there at all, need not be considered; no institutional\naristocracy, no Kaisers, Czars, nor King-Emperors to maintain a\nlitigious sequel to the Empire of Rome; it has no uneducated immovable\npeasantry rooted to the soil, indeed it has no rooting to the soil at\nall; it is, from the Forty-ninth Parallel to the tip of Cape Horn, one\ntriumphant embodiment of freedom and deliberate agreement. For I mean\nall America, Spanish-speaking as well as English-speaking; they have\nthis detachment from tradition in common. See how the United States, for\nexample, stands flatly on that bare piece of eighteenth-century\nintellectualism the Constitution, and is by virtue of that a structure\neither wilful and intellectual or absurd. That sense of incurable\nservitude to fate and past traditions, that encumbrance with ruins,\npledges, laws and ancient institutions, that perpetual complication of\nconsiderations and those haunting memories of preceding human failures\nwhich dwarf the courage of destiny in Europe and Asia, vanish from the\nmind within a week of one's arrival in the New World. Naturally one\nbegins to do things. One is inspired to do things. One feels that one\nhas escaped, one feels that the time is _now_. All America, North and\nSouth alike, is one tremendous escape from ancient obsessions into\nactivity and making.\n\nAnd by the time I had reached America I had already come to see that\njust as the issues of party politics at home and international politics\nabroad are mere superficialities above the greater struggle of an\nenergetic minority to organize and exploit the labor of the masses of\nmankind, so that struggle also is only a huge incident in the still more\nthan half unconscious impulse to replace the ancient way of human living\nby a more highly organized world-wide social order, by a world\ncivilization embodying itself in a World State. And I saw now how that\nimpulse could neither cease nor could it on the other hand realize\nitself until it became conscious and deliberate and merciful, free from\nhaste and tyranny, persuasive and sustained by a nearly universal\nsympathy and understanding. For until that arrives the creative forces\nmust inevitably spend themselves very largely in blind alleys, futile\nrushes and destructive conflicts. Upon that our two minds were agreed.\n\n\"We have,\" said Gidding, \"to understand and make understanding. That is\nthe real work for us to do, Stratton, that is our job. The world, as you\nsay, has been floundering about, half making civilization and never\nachieving it. Now _we_, I don't mean just you and me, Stratton,\nparticularly, but every intelligent man among us, have got to set to and\nmake it thorough. There is no other sane policy for a man outside his\nprivate passions but that. So let's get at it----\"\n\nI find it now impossible to trace the phases by which I reached these\nbroad ideas upon which I rest all my work, but certainly they were\npresent very early in my discussions with Gidding. We two men had been\nthinking independently but very similarly, and it is hard to say just\nwhat completing touches either of us gave to the other's propositions.\nWe found ourselves rather than arrived at the conception of ourselves\nas the citizens neither of the United States nor of England but of a\nstate that had still to come into being, a World State, a great unity\nbehind and embracing the ostensible political fabrics of to-day--a unity\nto be reached by weakening antagonisms, by developing understandings and\ntoleration, by fostering the sense of brotherhood across the ancient\nbounds.\n\nWe believed and we believe that such a creative conception of a human\ncommonweal can be fostered in exactly the same way that the idea of\nGerman unity was fostered behind the dukedoms, the free cities and\nkingdoms of Germany, a conception so creative that it can dissolve\ntraditional hatreds, incorporate narrower loyalties and replace a\nthousand suspicions and hostilities by a common passion for collective\nachievement, so creative that at last the national boundaries of to-day\nmay become obstacles as trivial to the amplifying good-will of men as\nthe imaginary line that severs Normandy from Brittany, or Berwick from\nNorthumberland.\n\nAnd it is not only a great peace about the earth that this idea of a\nWorld State means for us, but social justice also. We are both convinced\naltogether that there survives no reason for lives of toil, for\nhardship, poverty, famine, infectious disease, for the continuing\ncruelties of wild beasts and the greater multitude of crimes, but\nmismanagement and waste, and that mismanagement and waste spring from no\nother source than ignorance and from stupid divisions and jealousies,\nbase patriotisms, fanaticisms, prejudices and suspicions that are all no\nmore than ignorance a little mingled with viciousness. We have looked\nclosely into this servitude of modern labor, we have seen its injustice\nfester towards syndicalism and revolutionary socialism, and we know\nthese things for the mere aimless, ignorant resentments they are;\npunishments, not remedies. We have looked into the portentous threat of\nmodern war, and it is ignorant vanity and ignorant suspicion, the\nbargaining aggression of the British prosperous and the swaggering\nvulgarity of the German junker that make and sustain that monstrous\nEuropean devotion to arms. And we are convinced there is nothing in\nthese evils and conflicts that light may not dispel. We believe that\nthese things can be dispelled, that the great universals, Science which\nhas limitations neither of race nor class, Art which speaks to its own\nin every rank and nation, Philosophy and Literature which broaden\nsympathy and banish prejudice, can flood and submerge and will yet flow\nover and submerge every one of these separations between man and man.\n\nI will not say that this Great State, this World Republic of civilized\nmen, is our dream, because it is not a dream, it is a manifestly\nreasonable possibility. It is our intention. It is what we are\ndeliberately making and what in a little while very many men and women\nwill be making. We are secessionists from all contemporary nationalities\nand loyalties. We have set ourselves with all the capacity and energy at\nour disposal to create a world-wide common fund of ideas and knowledge,\nand to evoke a world-wide sense of human solidarity in which the\nexisting limitations of political structure must inevitably melt away.\n\nIt was Gidding and his Americanism, his inborn predisposition to\ninnovation and the large freedom of his wealth that turned these ideas\ninto immediate concrete undertakings. I see more and more that it is\nhere that we of the old European stocks, who still grow upon the old\nwood, differ most from those vigorous grafts of our race in America and\nAfrica and Australia on the one hand and from the renascent peoples of\nthe East on the other: that we have lost the courage of youth and have\nnot yet gained the courage of desperate humiliations, in taking hold of\nthings. To Gidding it was neither preposterous nor insufferably\nmagnificent that we should set about a propaganda of all science, all\nknowledge, all philosophical and political ideas, round about the\nhabitable globe. His mind began producing concrete projects as a\nfire-work being lit produces sparks, and soon he was \"figuring out\" the\nmost colossal of printing and publishing projects, as a man might work\nout the particulars for an alteration to his bathroom. It was so\nentirely natural to him, it was so entirely novel to me, to go on from\nthe proposition that understanding was the primary need of humanity to\nthe systematic organization of free publishing, exhaustive discussion,\nintellectual stimulation. He set about it as a company of pharmacists\nmight organize the distribution of some beneficial cure.\n\n\"Say, Stratton,\" he said, after a conversation that had seemed to me\nhalf fantasy; \"Let's _do_ it.\"\n\nThere are moments still when it seems to me that this life of mine has\nbecome the most preposterous of adventures. We two absurd human beings\nare spending our days and nights in a sustained and growing attempt to\ndo what? To destroy certain obsessions and to give the universal human\nmind a form and a desire for expression. We have put into the shape of\none comprehensive project that force of released wealth that has already\ndotted America with universities, libraries, institutions for research\nand enquiry. Already there are others at work with us, and presently\nthere will be a great number. We have started an avalanche above the old\npolitics and it gathers mass and pace....\n\nAnd there never was an impulse towards endeavor in a human heart that\nwasn't preposterous. Man is a preposterous animal. Thereby he ceases to\nbe a creature and becomes a creator, he turns upon the powers that made\nhim and subdues them to his service; by his sheer impudence he\nestablishes his claim to possess a soul....\n\nBut I need not write at all fully of my work here. This book is not\nabout that but about my coming to that. Long before this manuscript\nreaches your hands--if ultimately I decide that it shall reach your\nhands--you will be taking your share, I hope, in this open conspiracy\nagainst potentates and prejudices and all the separating powers of\ndarkness.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 11\n\nI would if I could omit one thing that I must tell you here, because it\ngoes so close to the very core of all this book has to convey. I wish I\ncould leave it out altogether. I wish I could simplify my story by\nsmoothing out this wrinkle at least and obliterating a thing that was at\nonce very real and very ugly. You see I had at last struggled up to a\nsustaining idea, to a conception of work and duty to which I could\nsurely give my life. I had escaped from my pit so far. And it was\nnatural that now with something to give I should turn not merely for\nconsolation and service but for help and fellowship to that dear human\nbeing across the seas who had offered them to me so straightly and\nsweetly. All that is brave and good and as you would have me, is it not?\nOnly, dear son, that is not all the truth.\n\nThere was still in my mind, for long it remained in my mind, a\nbitterness against Mary. I had left her, I had lost her, we had parted;\nbut from Germany to America and all through America and home again to my\nmarriage and with me after my marriage, it rankled that she could still\ngo on living a life independent of mine. I had not yet lost my desire to\npossess her, to pervade and dominate her existence; my resentment that\nthough she loved me she had first not married me and afterwards not\nconsented to come away with me was smouldering under the closed hatches\nof my mind. And so while the better part of me was laying hold of this\nwork because it gave me the hope of a complete distraction and escape\nfrom my narrow and jealous self, that lower being of the pit was also\nrejoicing in the great enterprises before me and in the marriage upon\nwhich I had now determined, because it was a last trampling upon my\ndevotion to Mary, because it defied and denied some lurking claims to\nempire I could suspect in her. I want to tell you that particularly\nbecause so I am made, so you are made, so most of us are made. There is\nscarcely a high purpose in all the world that has no dwarfish footman at\nits stirrup, no base intention over which there does not ride at least\nthe phantom of an angel.\n\nConstantly in those days, it seems to me now, I was haunted by my own\nimagination of Mary amiably reconciled to Justin, bearing him children,\nforgetful of or repudiating all the sweetness, all the wonder and beauty\nwe had shared.... It was an unjust and ungenerous conception, I knew it\nfor a caricature even as I entertained it, and yet it tormented me. It\nstung me like a spur. It kept me at work, and if I strayed into\nindolence brought me back to work with a mind galled and bleeding....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 12\n\nAnd I suppose it is mixed up with all this that I could not make love\neasily and naturally to Rachel. I could not write love-letters to her.\nThere is a burlesque quality in these scruples, I know, seeing that I\nwas now resolved to marry her, but that is the quality, that is the\nmixed texture of life. We overcome the greater things and are\nconscience-stricken by the details.\n\nI wouldn't, even at the price of losing her--and I was now passionately\nanxious not to lose her--use a single phrase of endearment that did not\ncome out of me almost in spite of myself. At any rate I would not cheat\nher. And my offer of marriage when at last I sent it to her from Chicago\nwas, as I remember it, almost business-like. I atoned soon enough for\nthat arid letter in ten thousand sweet words that came of themselves to\nmy lips. And she paid me at any rate in my own coin when she sent me her\nanswer by cable, the one word \"Yes.\"\n\nAnd indeed I was already in love with her long before I wrote. It was\nonly a dread of giving her a single undeserved cheapness that had held\nme back so long. It was that and the perplexity that Mary still gripped\nmy feelings; my old love for her was there in my heart in spite of my\nnew passion for Rachel, it was blackened perhaps and ruined and changed\nbut it was there. It was as if a new crater burnt now in the ampler\ncircumference of an old volcano, which showed all the more desolate and\nsorrowful and obsolete for the warm light of the new flames....\n\nHow impatiently I came home! Thoughts of England I had not dared to\nthink for three long years might now do what they would in me. I dreamt\nof the Surrey Hills and the great woods of Burnmore Park, of the\nchanging skies and stirring soft winds of our grey green Motherland.\nThere was fog in the Irish Sea, and we lost the better part of a day\nhooting our way towards Liverpool while I fretted about the ship with\nall my luggage packed, staring at the grey waters that weltered under\nthe mist. It was the longest day in my life. My heart was full of\ndesire, my eyes ached for the little fields and golden October skies of\nEngland, England that was waiting to welcome me back from my exile with\nsuch open arms. I was coming home,--home.\n\nI hurried through London into Surrey and in my father's study, warned by\na telegram, I found a bright-eyed, resolute young woman awaiting me,\nwith the quality about her of one who embarks upon a long premeditated\nadventure. And I found too a family her sisters and her brother all\ngladly ready for me, my father too was a happy man, and on the eighth of\nNovember in 1906 Rachel and I were married in the little church at\nShere. We stayed for a week or so in Hampshire near Ringwood, the season\nwas late that year and the trees still very beautiful; and then we went\nto Portofino on the Ligurian coast.\n\nThere presently Gidding joined us and we began to work out the schemes\nwe had made in America, the schemes that now fill my life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE TENTH\n\nMARY WRITES\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 1\n\nIt was in the early spring of 1909 that I had a letter from Mary.\n\nBy that time my life was set fully upon its present courses, Gidding and\nI had passed from the stage of talking and scheming to definite\nundertakings. Indeed by 1909 things were already organized upon their\npresent lines. We had developed a huge publishing establishment with one\nbig printing plant in Barcelona and another in Manchester, and we were\nstudying the peculiar difficulties that might attend the establishment\nof a third plant in America. Our company was an English company under\nthe name of Alphabet and Mollentrave, and we were rapidly making it the\nbroadest and steadiest flow of publication the world had ever seen. Its\nstreams already reached further and carried more than any single firm\nhad ever managed to do before. We were reprinting, in as carefully\nedited and revised editions as we could, the whole of the English,\nSpanish and French literature, and we were only waiting for the release\nof machinery to attack German, Russian and Italian, and were giving each\nlanguage not only its own but a very complete series of good\ntranslations of the classical writers in every other tongue. We had a\nlittle band of editors and translators permanently in our service at\neach important literary centre. We had, for example, more than a score\nof men at work translating Bengali fiction and verse into English,--a\nlot of that new literature is wonderfully illuminating to an intelligent\nEnglishman--and we had a couple of men hunting about for new work in\nArabic. We meant to give so good and cheap a book, and to be so\ncomprehensive in our choice of books, excluding nothing if only it was\nreal and living, on account of any inferiority of quality, obscurity of\nsubject or narrowness of demand, that in the long run anybody, anywhere,\ndesiring to read anything would turn naturally and inevitably to our\nlists.\n\nOurs was to be in the first place a world literature. Then afterwards\nupon its broad currents of distribution and in the same forms we meant\nto publish new work and new thought. We were also planning an\nencyclop\u00c3\u00a6dia. Behind our enterprise of translations and reprints we were\ngetting together and putting out a series of guide-books, gazetteers,\ndictionaries, text-books and books of reference, and we were organizing\na revising staff for these, a staff that should be constantly keeping\nthem up to date. It was our intention to make every copy we printed bear\nthe date of its last revision in a conspicuous place, and we hoped to\nget the whole line of these books ultimately upon an annual basis, and\nto sell them upon repurchasing terms that would enable us to issue a new\ncopy and take back and send the old one to the pulping mill at a narrow\nmargin of profit. Then we meant to spread our arms wider, and\nconsolidate and offer our whole line of text-books, guide-books and\ngazetteers, bibliographies, atlases, dictionaries and directories as a\nnew World Encyclop\u00c3\u00a6dia, that should also annually or at longest\nbiennially renew its youth.\n\nSo far we had gone in the creation of a huge international organ of\ninformation, and of a kind of gigantic modern Bible of world literature,\nand in the process of its distribution we were rapidly acquiring an\nimmense detailed knowledge of the book and publishing trade, finding\ncongestions here, neglected opportunities there, and devising and\ndrawing up a hundred schemes for relief, assistance, amalgamation and\nrearrangement. We had branches in China, Japan, Peru, Iceland and a\nthousand remote places that would have sounded as far off as the moon to\nan English or American bookseller in the seventies. China in particular\nwas a growing market. We had a subsidiary company running a flourishing\nline of book shops in the east-end of London, and others in New Jersey,\nChicago, Buenos Ayres, the South of France, and Ireland. Incidentally we\nhad bought up some thousands of miles of Labrador forest to ensure our\npaper supply, and we could believe that before we died there would not\nbe a corner of the world in which any book of interest or value whatever\nwould not be easily attainable by any intelligent person who wanted to\nread it. And already we were taking up the more difficult and ambitious\nphase of our self-appointed task, and considering the problem of using\nthese channels we were mastering and deepening and supplementing for the\nstimulation and wide diffusion of contemporary thought.\n\nThere we went outside the province of Alphabet and Mollentrave and into\nan infinitely subtler system of interests. We wanted to give sincere and\nclear-thinking writers encouragement and opportunity, to improve the\ncritical tribunal and make it independent of advertising interests, so\nthat there would be a readier welcome for luminous thinking and writing\nand a quicker explosion of intellectual imposture. We sought to provide\nguides and intelligencers to contemporary thought. We had already set up\nor subsidized or otherwise aided a certain number of magazines and\nperiodicals that seemed to us independent-spirited, out-spoken and well\nhandled, but we had still to devise our present scheme of financing\ngroups of men to create magazines and newspapers, which became their own\nseparate but inalienable property after so many years of success.\n\nBut all this I hope you will already have become more or less familiar\nwith when this story reaches your hands, and I hope by the time it does\nso we shall be far beyond our present stage of experiment and that you\nwill have come naturally to play your part in this most fascinating\nbusiness of maintaining an onward intellectual movement in the world, a\nmovement not simply independent of but often running counter to all\nsorts of political and financial interests. I tell you this much here\nfor you to understand that already in 1909 and considering the business\nside of my activities alone, I was a hard worker and very strenuously\nemployed. And in addition to all this huge network of enterprises I had\ndeveloped with Gidding, I was still pretty actively a student. I\nwasn't--I never shall be--absolutely satisfied with my general ideas. I\nwas enquiring keenly and closely into those problems of group and crowd\npsychology from which all this big publishing work has arisen, and\ngiving particular attention to the war-panics and outbreaks of\ninternational hostility that were then passing in deepening waves\nacross Europe. I had already accumulated a mass of notes for the book\nupon \"Group Jealousy in Religious Persecution, Racial Conflicts and War\"\nwhich I hope to publish the year after next, and which therefore I hope\nyou will have read long before this present book can possibly come to\nyou. And moreover Rachel and I had established our home in London--in\nthe house we now occupy during the winter and spring--and both you and\nyour little sister had begun your careers as inhabitants of this earth.\nYour little sister had indeed but just begun.\n\nAnd then one morning at the breakfast-table I picked a square envelope\nout of a heap of letters, and saw the half-forgotten and infinitely\nfamiliar handwriting of Lady Mary Justin.... The sight of it gave me an\nodd mixture of sensations. I was startled, I was disturbed, I was a\nlittle afraid. I hadn't forgiven her yet; it needed but this touch to\ntell me how little I had forgotten....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 2\n\nI sat with it in my hand for a moment or so before I opened it,\nhesitating as one hesitates before a door that may reveal a dramatic\nsituation. Then I pushed my chair a little back from the table and\nripped the envelope.\n\nIt was a far longer letter than Mary had ever written me in the old\ndays, and in a handwriting as fine as ever but now rather smaller. I\nhave it still, and here I open its worn folds and, except for a few\ntrifling omissions, copy it out for you.... A few trifling omissions, I\nsay,--just one there is that is not trifling, but that I must needs\nmake....\n\nYou will never see any of these letters because I shall destroy them so\nsoon as this copy is made. It has been difficult--or I should have\ndestroyed them before. But some things can be too hard for us....\n\nThis first letter is on the Martens note-paper; its very heading was\nfamiliar to me. The handwriting of the earlier sentences is a little\nstiff and disjointed, and there are one or two scribbled obliterations;\nit is like someone embarrassed in speaking; and then it passes into her\nusual and characteristic ease....\n\nAnd as I read, slowly my long-cherished anger evaporated, and the real\nMary, outspoken and simple, whom I had obscured by a cloud of fancied\ninfidelities, returned to me....\n\n\"My dear Stephen,\" she begins, \"About six weeks ago I saw in the _Times_\nthat you have a little daughter. It set me thinking, picturing you with\na mite of a baby in your arms--what _little_ things they are,\nStephen!--and your old face bent over it, so that presently I went to my\nroom and cried. It set me thinking about you so that I have at last\nwritten you this letter.... I love to think of you with wife and\nchildren about you Stephen,--I heard of your son for the first time\nabout a year ago, but--don't mistake me,--something wrings me too....\n\n\"Well, I too have children. Have you ever thought of me as a mother? I\nam. I wonder how much you know about me now. I have two children and the\nyoungest is just two years old. And somehow it seems to me that now that\nyou and I have both given such earnests of our good behavior, such\nevidence that _that_ side of life anyhow is effectually settled for us,\nthere is no reason remaining why we shouldn't correspond. You are my\nbrother, Stephen, and my friend and my twin and the core of my\nimagination, fifty babies cannot alter that, we can live but once and\nthen die, and, promise or no promise, I will not be dead any longer in\nyour world when I'm not dead, nor will I have you, if I can help it, a\ncold unanswering corpse in mine....\n\n\"Too much of my life and being, Stephen, has been buried, and I am in\nrebellion. This is a breach of the tomb if you like, an irregular\nprivate premature resurrection from an interment in error. Out of my\nalleged grave I poke my head and say Hello! to you. Stephen, old friend!\ndear friend! how are you getting on? What is it like to you? How do you\nfeel? I want to know about you.... I'm not doing this at all furtively,\nand you can write back to me, Stephen, as openly as your heart desires.\nI have told Justin I should do this. I rise, you see, blowing my own\nTrump. Let the other graves do as they please....\n\n\"Your letters will be respected, Stephen.... If you choose to rise also\nand write me a letter.\n\n\"Stephen, I've been wanting to do this for--for all the time. If there\nwas thought-reading you would have had a thousand letters. But formerly\nI was content to submit, and latterly I've chafed more. I think that as\nwhat they call passion has faded, the immense friendliness has become\nmore evident, and made the bar less and less justifiable. You and I have\nhad so much between us beyond what somebody the other day--it was in a\nreport in the _Times_, I think--was calling _Materia Matrimoniala_. And\nof course I hear about you from all sorts of people, and in all sorts\nof ways--whatever you have done about me I've had a woman's sense of\nhonor about you and I've managed to learn a great deal without asking\nforbidden questions. I've pricked up my ears at the faintest echo of\nyour name.\n\n\"They say you have become a publisher with an American partner, a sort\nof Harmsworth and Nelson and Times Book Club and Hooper and Jackson all\nrolled into one. That seems so extraordinary to me that for that alone I\nshould have had to write to you. I want to know the truth of that. I\nnever see any advertisement of Stratton & Co. or get any inkling of what\nit is you publish. Are you the power behind the respectable Murgatroyd\nand the honest Milvain? I know them both and neither has the slightest\nappearance of being animated by you. And equally perplexing is your\nbeing mixed up with an American like that man Gidding in Peace\nConferences and Social Reform Congresses and so forth. It's\nso--Carnegieish. There I'm surer because I've seen your name in reports\nof meetings and I've read your last two papers in the _Fortnightly_. I\ncan't imagine you of all people, with your touch of reserve, launching\ninto movements and rubbing shoulders with faddists. What does it mean,\nStephen? I had expected to find you coming back into English\npolitics--speaking and writing on the lines of your old beginning,\ntaking up that work you dropped--it's six years now ago. I've been\naccumulating disappointment for two years. Mr. Arthur, you see, on our\nside,\"--this you will remember was in 1909--\"still steers our devious\nparty courses, and the Tariff Reformers have still to capture us. Weston\nMassinghay was comparing them the other night, at a dinner at the\nClynes', to a crowded piratical galley trying to get alongside a good\nseaman in rough weather. He was very funny about Leo Maxse in the poop,\nwhite and shrieking with passion and the motion, and all the capitalists\narmed to the teeth and hiding snug in the hold until the grappling-irons\nwere fixed.... Why haven't you come into the game? I'd hoped it if only\nfor the sake of meeting you again. What are you doing out beyond there?\n\n\"We are in it so far as I can contrive. But I contrive very little. We\nare pillars of the Conservative party--on that Justin's mind is firmly\nsettled--and every now and then I clamor urgently that we must do more\nfor it. But Justin's ideas go no further than writing cheques--doing\nmore for the party means writing a bigger cheque--and there are moments\nwhen I feel we shall simply bring down a peerage upon our heads and bury\nmy ancient courtesy title under the ignominy of a new creation. He would\ncertainly accept it. He writes his cheque and turns back at the earliest\nopportunity to his miniature gardens and the odd little freaks of\ncollecting that attract him. Have you ever heard of chintz oil jars?\n'No,' you will say. Nor has anyone else yet except our immediate circle\nof friends and a few dealers who are no doubt industriously increasing\nthe present scanty supply. We possess three. They are matronly shaped\njars about two feet or a yard high, of a kind of terra-cotta with wooden\ntops surmounted by gilt acorns, and they have been covered with white\npaint and on this flowers and birds and figures from some very rich old\nchintz have been stuck very cunningly, and then everything has been\nvarnished--and there you are. Our first and best was bought for\nseven-and-sixpence, brought home in the car, put upon a console table\non the second landing and worshipped. It's really a very pleasant mellow\nthing to see. Nobody had ever seen the like. Guests, sycophantic people\nof all sorts were taken to consider it. It was looked at with heads at\nevery angle, one man even kept his head erect and one went a little\nupstairs and looked at it under his arm. Also the most powerful lenses\nhave been used for a minute examination, and one expert licked the\nvarnish and looked extremely thoughtful and wise at me as he turned the\nbooty over his gifted tongue. And now, God being with us, we mean to\npossess every specimen in existence--before the Americans get hold of\nthe idea. Yesterday Justin got up and motored sixty miles to look at an\nalleged fourth....\n\n\"Oh my dear! I am writing chatter. You perceive I've reached the\nchattering stage. It is the fated end of the clever woman in a good\nsocial position nowadays, her mind beats against her conditions for the\nlast time and breaks up into this carping talk, this spume of\nobservation and comment, this anecdotal natural history of the\nrestraining husband, as waves burst out their hearts in a foam upon a\nreef. But it isn't chatter I want to write to you.\n\n\"Stephen, I'm intolerably wretched. No creature has ever been gladder to\nhave been born than I was for the first five and twenty years of my\nlife. I was full of hope and I was full, I suppose, of vanity and rash\nconfidence. I thought I was walking on solid earth with my head reaching\nup to the clouds, and that sea and sky and all mankind were mine for the\nsmiling. And I am nothing and worse than nothing, I am the ineffectual\nmother of two children, a daughter whom I adore--but of her I may not\ntell you--and a son,--a son who is too like his father for any fury of\nworship, a stolid little creature.... That is all I have done in the\nworld, a mere blink of maternity, and my blue Persian who is scarcely\ntwo years old, has already had nine kittens. My husband and I have never\nforgiven each other the indefinable wrong of not pleasing each other;\nthat embitters more and more; to take it out of each other is our r\u00c3\u00b4le;\nI have done my duty to the great new line of Justin by giving it the\nheir it needed, and now a polite and silent separation has fallen\nbetween us. We hardly speak except in company. I have not been so much\nmarried, Stephen, I find, as collected, and since our tragic\nmisadventure--but there were beautiful moments, Stephen, unforgettable\nglimpses of beauty in that--thank God, I say impenitently for that--the\ndoor of the expensively splendid cabinet that contains me, when it is\nnot locked, is very discreetly--watched. I have no men friends, no\nsocial force, no freedom to take my line. My husband is my official\nobstacle. We barb the limitations of life for one another. A little\nwhile ago he sought to chasten me--to rouse me rather--through jealousy,\nand made me aware indirectly but a little defiantly of a young person of\nartistic gifts in whose dramatic career he was pretending a conspicuous\ninterest. I was jealous and roused, but scarcely in the way he desired.\n'This,' I said quite cheerfully, 'means freedom for _me_, Justin,'--and\nthe young woman vanished from the visible universe with an incredible\ncelerity. I hope she was properly paid off and not simply made away with\nby a minion, but I become more and more aware of my ignorance of a\ngreat financier's methods as I become more and more aware of them....\n\n\"Stephen, my dear, my brother, I am intolerably unhappy. I do not know\nwhat to do with myself, or what there is to hope for in life. I am like\na prisoner in a magic cage and I do not know the word that will release\nme. How is it with you? Are you unhappy beyond measure or are you not;\nand if you are not, what are you doing with life? Have you found any\nsecret that makes living tolerable and understandable? Write to me,\nwrite to me at least and tell me that.... Please write to me.\n\n\"Do you remember how long ago you and I sat in the old Park at Burnmore,\nand how I kept pestering you and asking you what is all this _for_? And\nyou looked at the question as an obstinate mule looks at a narrow bridge\nhe could cross but doesn't want to. Well, Stephen, you've had\nnearly--how many years is it now?--to get an answer ready. What _is_ it\nall for? What do you make of it? Never mind my particular case, or the\ncase of Women with a capital _W_, tell me _your_ solution. You are\nactive, you keep doing things, you find life worth living. Is publishing\na way of peace for the heart? I am prepared to believe even that. But\njustify yourself. Tell me what you have got there to keep your soul\nalive.\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 3\n\nI read this letter to the end and looked up, and there was my home about\nme, a room ruddy-brown and familiar, with the row of old pewter things\nupon the dresser, the steel engravings of former Strattons that came to\nme from my father, a convex mirror exaggerating my upturned face. And\nRachel just risen again sat at the other end of the table, a young\nmother, fragile and tender-eyed. The clash of these two systems of\nreality was amazing. It was as though I had not been parted from Mary\nfor a day, as though all that separation and all that cloud of bitter\njealousy had been a mere silence between two people in the same room.\nIndeed it was extraordinarily like that, as if I had been sitting at a\ndesk, imagining myself alone, reading my present life as one reads in a\nbook at a shaded lamp, and then suddenly that silent other had spoken.\n\nAnd then I looked at the page of my life before me and became again a\ncharacter in the story.\n\nI met the enquiry in Rachel's eyes. \"It's a letter from Mary Justin,\" I\nsaid.\n\nShe did not answer for a few moments. She became interested in the flame\nof the little spirit lamp that kept her coffee hot. She finished what\nshe had to do with that and then remarked, \"I thought you two were not\nto correspond.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, putting the letter down; \"that was the understanding.\"\n\nThere was a little interval of silence, and then I got up and went to\nthe fireplace where the bacon and sausages stood upon a trivet.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Rachel, \"she wants to hear from you again.\"\n\n\"She thinks that now we have children, and that she has two, we can\nconsider what was past, past and closed and done with, and she wants to\nhear--about me.... Apart from everything else--we were very great\nfriends.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Rachel with lips a little awry, \"of course. You must\nhave been great friends. And it's natural for her to write.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" she added, \"her husband knows.\"\n\n\"She's told him, she says....\"\n\nHer eye fell on the letter in my hand for the smallest fraction of a\nsecond, and it was as if hastily she snatched away a thought from my\nobservation. I had a moment of illuminating embarrassment. So far we had\ncontrived to do as most young people do when they marry, we had sought\nto make our lives unreservedly open to one another, we had affected an\nentire absence of concealments about our movements, our thoughts. If\nperhaps I had been largely silent to her about Mary it was not so much\nthat I sought to hide things from her as that I myself sought to forget.\nIt is one of the things that we learn too late, the impossibility of any\nsuch rapid and wilful coalescences of souls. But we had maintained a\nconvention of infinite communism since our marriage; we had shown each\nother our letters as a matter of course, shared the secrets of our\nfriends, gone everywhere together as far as we possibly could.\n\nI wanted now to give her the letter in my hand to read--and to do so was\nmanifestly impossible. Something had arisen between us that made out of\nour unity two abruptly separated figures masked and veiled. Here were\nthings I knew and understood completely and that I could not even\ndescribe to Rachel. What would she make of Mary's \"Write to me. Write to\nme\"? A mere wish to resume.... I would not risk the exposure of Mary's\nmind and heart and unhappiness, to her possible misinterpretation....\n\nThat letter fell indeed like a pitiless searchlight into all that\nregion of differences ignored, over which we had built the vaulted\nconvention of our complete mutual understanding. In my memory it seems\nto me now as though we hung silent for quite a long time over the\nevasions that were there so abruptly revealed.\n\nThen I put the letter into my pocket with a clumsy assumption of\ncarelessness, and knelt down to the fender and sausages.\n\n\"It will be curious,\" I said, \"to write to her again.... To tell her\nabout things....\"\n\nAnd then with immense interest, \"Are these Chichester sausages you've\ngot here, Rachel, or some new kind?\"\n\nRachel roused herself to respond with an equal affectation, and we made\nan eager conversation about bacon and sausages--for after that startling\ngleam of divergence we were both anxious to get back to the\nsuperficialities of life again.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 4\n\nI did not answer Mary's letter for seven or eight days.\n\nDuring that period my mind was full of her to the exclusion of every\nother interest. I re-read all that she had to say many times, and with\neach reading the effect of her personality deepened. It was all so\nintensely familiar, the flashes of insight, the blazing frankness, the\nquick turns of thought, and her absurd confidence in a sort of sane\nstupidity that she had always insisted upon my possessing. And her\nunembarrassed affectionateness. Her quick irregular writing seemed to\nbring back with it the changing light in her eyes, the intonations of\nher voice, something of her gesture....\n\nI didn't go on discussing with myself whether we two ought to\ncorrespond; that problem disappeared from my thoughts. Her challenge to\nme to justify myself took possession of my mind. That thrust towards\nself-examination was the very essence of her ancient influence. How did\nI justify myself? I was under a peculiar compulsion to answer that to\nher satisfaction. She had picked me up out of my work and accumulating\nroutines with that demand, made me look at myself and my world again as\na whole.... I had a case. I have a case. It is a case of passionate\nfaith triumphing over every doubt and impossibility, a case real enough\nto understand for those who understand, but very difficult to state. I\ntried to convey it to her.\n\nI do not remember at all clearly what I wrote to her. It has disappeared\nfrom existence. But it was certainly a long letter. Throughout this book\nI have been trying to tell you the growth of my views of life and its\npurpose, from my childish dreams and Harbury attitudes to those ideas of\nhuman development that have made me undertake the work I do. It is not\nglorious work I know, as the work of great artists and poets and leaders\nis glorious, but it is what I find best suits my gifts and my want of\ngifts. Greater men will come at last to build within my scaffoldings. In\nsome summary phrasing I must have set out the gist of this. I must have\nexplained my sense of the supreme importance of mental clarification in\nhuman life. All this is manifest in her reply. And I think too I did my\nbest to tell her plainly the faith that was in me, and why life seemed\nworth while to me....\n\nHer second letter came after an interval of only a few days from the\ndespatch of mine. She began abruptly.\n\n\"I won't praise your letter or your beliefs. They are fine and\nlarge--and generous--like you. Just a little artificial (but you will\nadmit that), as though you had felt them _give_ here and there and had\nmade up your mind they shouldn't. At times it's oddly like looking at\nthe Alps, the real Alps, and finding that every now and then the\nmountains have been eked out with a plank and canvas Earl's Court\nbackground.... Yes, I like what you say about Faith. I believe you are\nright. I wish I could--perhaps some day I shall--light up and _feel_ you\nare right. But--but---- That large, _respectable_ project, the increase\nof wisdom and freedom and self-knowledge in the world, the calming of\nwars, the ending of economic injustice and so on and so on----\n\n\"When I read it first it was like looking at a man in profile and\nfinding him solid and satisfactory, and then afterwards when I thought\nit all over and looked for the particular things that really matter to\nme and tried to translate it into myself--nothing is of the slightest\nimportance in the world that one cannot translate into oneself--then I\nbegan to realize just how amazingly deficient you are. It was like\nwalking round that person in profile and finding his left side wasn't\nthere--with everything perfect on the right, down to the buttons. A kind\nof intellectual Lorelei--sideways. You've planned out your\nunderstandings and tolerances and enquiries and clearings-up as if the\nworld were all just men--or citizens--and nothing doing but racial and\nnational and class prejudices and the exacting and shirking of labor,\nand you seem to ignore altogether that man is a sexual animal\nfirst--first, Stephen, first--that he has that in common with all the\nanimals, that it made him indeed because he has it more than they\nhave--and after that, a long way after that, he is the\nlabor-economizing, war-and feud-making creature you make him out to be.\nA long way after that....\n\n\"Man is the most sexual of all the beasts, Stephen. Half of him,\nwomankind, rather more than half, isn't simply human at all, it's\nspecialized, specialized for the young, not only naturally and\nphysically as animals are, but mentally and artificially. Womankind\nisn't human, it's reduced human. It's 'the sex' as the Victorians used\nto say, and from the point of view of the Lex Julia and the point of\nview of Mr. Malthus, and the point of view of biologists and saints and\nartists and everyone who deals in feeling and emotion--and from the\npoint of view of all us poor specialists, smothered up in our clothes\nand restrictions--the future of the sex is the centre of the whole\nproblem of the human future, about which you are concerned. All this\ngreat world-state of your man's imagination is going to be wrecked by us\nif you ignore us, we women are going to be the Goths and Huns of another\nDecline and Fall. We are going to sit in the conspicuous places of the\nworld and _loot_ all your patient accumulations. We are going to abolish\nyour offspring and turn the princes among you into undignified slaves.\nBecause, you see, specialized as we are, we are not quite specialized,\nwe are specialized under duress, and at the first glimpse of a chance we\nabandon our cradles and drop our pots and pans and go for the vast and\nelegant side possibilities--of our specialization. Out we come, looking\nfor the fun the men are having. Dress us, feed us, play with us! We'll\npay you in excitement,--tremendous excitement. The State indeed! All\nyour little triumphs of science and economy, all your little\naccumulations of wealth that you think will presently make the struggle\nfor life an old story and the millennium possible--_we spend_. And all\nyour dreams of brotherhood!--we will set you by the ears. We hold\nourselves up as my little Christian nephews--Philip's boys--do some\ncoveted object, and say _Quis?_ and the whole brotherhood shouts\n'_Ego!_' to the challenge.... Back you go into Individualism at the word\nand all your Brotherhood crumbles to dust again.\n\n\"How are you going to remedy it, how are you going to protect that Great\nState of your dreams from this anti-citizenship of sex? You give no\nhint.\n\n\"You are planning nothing, Stephen, nothing to meet this. You are\nfighting with an army all looting and undisciplined, frantic with the\nprivate jealousies that centre about _us_, feuds, cuts, expulsions,\nrevenges, and you are giving out orders for an army of saints. You treat\nus as a negligible quantity, and we are about as negligible as a fire in\nthe woodwork of a house that is being built....\n\n\"I read what I have written, Stephen, and I perceive I have the makings\nof a fine scold in me. Perhaps under happier conditions----... I should\ncertainly have scolded you, constantly, continually.... Never did a man\nso need scolding.... And like any self-respecting woman I see that I use\nhalf my words in the wrong meanings in order to emphasize my point. Of\ncourse when I write woman in all that has gone before I don't mean\nwoman. It is a woman's privilege to talk or write incomprehensibly and\ninsist upon being understood. So that I expect you already to understand\nthat what I mean isn't that men are creative and unselfish and brotherly\nand so forth and that women are spoiling and going to spoil the\ngame--although and notwithstanding that is exactly what I have\nwritten--but that humans are creative and unselfish et cetera and so\nforth, and that it is their sexual, egotistical, passionate side (which\nis ever so much bigger relatively in a woman than in a man, and that is\nwhy I wrote as I did) which is going to upset your noble and beautiful\napple-cart. But it is not only that by nature we are more largely and\ngravely and importantly sexual than men but that men have shifted the\nresponsibility for attraction and passion upon us and made us pay in\nservitude and restriction and blame for the common defect of the\nspecies. So that you see really I was right all along in writing of this\nas though it was women when it wasn't, and I hope now it is unnecessary\nfor me to make my meaning clearer than it is now and always has been in\nthis matter. And so, resuming our discourse, Stephen, which only my\nsense of your invincible literalness would ever have interrupted, what\nare you going to do with us?\n\n\"I gather from a hint rather than accept as a statement that you propose\nto give us votes.\n\n\"Stephen!--do you really think that we are going to bring anything to\nbear upon public affairs worth having? I know something of the\ncontemporary feminine intelligence. Justin makes no serious objection to\na large and various circle of women friends, and over my little\nsitting-room fire in the winter and in my corners of our various gardens\nin the summer and in walks over the heather at Martens and in Scotland\nthere are great talks and confessions of love, of mental freedom, of\nambitions, and belief and unbelief--more particularly of unbelief. I\nhave sometimes thought of compiling a dictionary of unbelief, a great\nlist of the things that a number of sweet, submissive,\nvalue-above-rubies wives have told me they did not believe in. It would\namaze their husbands beyond measure. The state of mind of women about\nthese things, Stephen, is dreadful--I mean about all these\nquestions--you know what I mean. The bold striving spirits do air their\nviews a little, and always in a way that makes one realize how badly\nthey need airing--but most of the nicer women are very chary of talk,\nthey have to be drawn out, a hint of opposition makes them start back or\nprevaricate, and I see them afterwards with their husbands, pretty\nsilken furry feathery jewelled _silences_. All their suppression doesn't\nkeep them orthodox, it only makes them furtive and crumpled and creased\nin their minds--in just the way that things get crumpled and creased if\nthey are always being shoved back into a drawer. You have only to rout\nabout in their minds for a bit. They pretend at first to be quite\ncorrect, and then out comes the nasty little courage of the darkness.\nSometimes there is even an apologetic titter. They are quite\nemancipated, they say; I have misunderstood them. Their emancipation is\nlike those horrid white lizards that grow in the Kentucky caves out of\nthe sunlight. They tell you they don't see why they shouldn't do this or\nthat--mean things, underhand things, cheap, vicious, sensual things....\nAre there, I wonder, the same dreadful little caverns in men? I doubt\nit. And then comes a situation that really tries their quality.... Think\nof the quandary I got into with you, Stephen. And for my sex I'm rather\na daring person. The way in which I went so far--and then ran away. I\nhad a kind of excuse--in my illness. That illness! Such a queer untimely\nfeminine illness....\n\n\"We're all to pieces, Stephen. That's what brought down Rome. The women\nwent to pieces then, and the women are going to pieces to-day. What's\nthe good of having your legions in the Grampians and marching up to\nPhilae, while the wives are talking treason in your houses? It's no good\ntelling us to go back to the Ancient Virtues. The Ancient Virtues\nhaven't _kept_. The Ancient Virtues in an advanced state of decay is\nwhat was the matter with Rome and what is the matter with us. You can't\ntell a woman to go back to the spinning-wheel and the kitchen and the\ncradle, when you have power-looms, French cooks, hotels, restaurants and\nmodern nurseries. We've overflowed. We've got to go on to a lot of New\nVirtues. And in all the prospect before me--I can't descry one clear\nsimple thing to do....\n\n\"But I'm running on. I want to know, Stephen, why you've got nothing to\nsay about all this. It must have been staring you in the face ever since\nI spent my very considerable superfluous energies in wrecking your\ncareer. Because you know I wrecked it, Stephen. I _knew_ I was wrecking\nit and I wrecked it. I knew exactly what I was doing all the time. I had\nmeant to be so fine a thing for you, a mothering friend, to have that\ndear consecutive kindly mind of yours steadying mine, to have seen you\ngrow to power over men, me helping, me admiring. It was to have been so\nfine. So fine! Didn't I urge you to marry Rachel, make you talk of her.\nDon't you remember that? And one day when I saw you thinking of Rachel,\nsaw a kind of pride in your eyes!--suddenly I couldn't stand it. I went\nto my room after you had gone and thought of you and her until I wanted\nto scream. I couldn't bear it. It was intolerable. I was violent to my\ntoilet things. I broke a hand-glass. Your dignified, selfish,\nself-controlled Mary _smashed_ a silver hand-mirror. I never told you\nthat. You know what followed. I pounced on you and took you. Wasn't I--a\nsoft and scented hawk? Was either of us better than some creature of\ninstinct that does what it does because it must? It was like a gust of\nmadness--and I cared, I found, no more for your career than I cared for\nany other little thing, for honor, for Rachel, for Justin, that stood\nbetween us....\n\n\"My dear, wasn't all that time, all that heat and hunger of desire, all\nthat secret futility of passion, the very essence of the situation\nbetween men and women now? We are all trying most desperately to be\nhuman beings, to walk erect, to work together--what was your\nphrase?--'in a multitudinous unity,' to share what you call a common\ncollective thought that shall rule mankind, and this tremendous force\nwhich seizes us and says to us: 'Make that other being yours, bodily\nyours, mentally yours, wholly yours--at any price, no matter the price,'\nbars all our unifications. It splits the whole world into couples\nwatching each other. Until all our laws, all our customs seem the\nservants of that. It is the passion of the body swamping the brain; it's\nan ape that has seized a gun, a beautiful modern gun. Here am I,\nJustin's captive, and he mine, he mine because at the first escapade of\nhis I get my liberty. Here are we two, I and you, barred for ever from\nthe sight of one another, and I and you writing--I at any rate--in spite\nof the ill-concealed resentment of my partner. We're just two, peeping\nthrough our bars, of a universal multitude. Everywhere this prison of\nsex. Have you ever thought just all that it means when every woman in\nthe world goes dressed in a costume to indicate her sex, her cardinal\nfact, so that she dare not even mount a bicycle in knickerbockers, she\nhas her hair grown long to its longest because yours is short, and\neverything conceivable is done to emphasize and remind us (and you) of\nthe fundamental trouble between us? As if there was need of reminding!\nStephen, is there no way out of this? Is there no way at all? Because if\nthere is not, then I had rather go back to the hareem than live as I do\nnow imprisoned in glass--with all of life in sight of me and none in\nreach. I had rather Justin beat me into submission and mental\ntranquillity and that I bore him an annual--probably deciduous--child. I\ncan understand so well now that feminine attitude that implies, 'Well,\nif I must have a master, then the more master the better.' Perhaps that\nis the way; that Nature will not let us poor humans get away from sex,\nand I am merely--what is it?--an abnormality--with whiskers of enquiry\nsprouting from my mind. Yet I don't feel like that....\n\n\"I'm pouring into these letters, Stephen, the concentrated venom of\nyears of brooding. My heart is black with rebellion against my lot and\nagainst the lot of woman. I have been given life and a fine position in\nthe world, I made one fatal blunder in marrying to make these things\nsecure, and now I can do nothing with it all and I have nothing to do\nwith it. It astounds me to think of the size of our establishments,\nStephen, of the extravagant way in which whole counties and great\ncountries pay tribute to pile up the gigantic heap of wealth upon which\nwe two lead our lives of futile entanglement. In this place alone there\nare fourteen gardeners and garden helps, and this is not one of our\ngarden places. Three weeks ago I spent a thousand pounds on clothes in\none great week of shopping, and our yearly expenditure upon personal\neffect, upon our magnificence and our margins cannot be greatly less\nthan forty-five thousand pounds. I walk about our house and gardens, I\ntake one of the carriages or one of the automobiles and go to some large\npointless gathering of hundreds and thousands and thousands of pounds,\nand we walk about and say empty little things, and the servants don't\nlaugh at us, the butlers don't laugh at us, the people in the street\ntolerate us.... It has an effect of collective insanity.... You know the\nstory of one of those dear Barons of the Cinque Ports--a decent\nplumber-body from Rye or Winchelsea--one of the six--or eight--who\nclaimed the privilege of carrying the canopy over the King\"--she is\nspeaking of King Edward's coronation of course--\"how that he was\ndiscovered suddenly to be speaking quite audibly to the sacred presence\nso near to him: 'It is very remarkable--we should be here, your\nmajesty--very remarkable.' And then he subsided--happily unheard--into\nhopeless embarrassment. That is exactly how I feel, Stephen. I feel I\ncan't stand it much longer, that presently I shall splutter and spoil\nthe procession....\n\n\"Perhaps I don't properly estimate our position in the fabric, but I\ncan't get away from the feeling that everything in social life leads up\nto this--to us,--the ridiculous canopy. If so, then the universe\nmeans--_nothing_; it's blowing great forms and shapes as a swamp blows\nbubbles; a little while ago it was megatheriums and plesiosauriums--if\nthat's the name for them--and now it is country-houses and motor-cars\nand coronation festivals. And in the end--it is all nonsense, Stephen.\nIt is utter nonsense.\n\n\"If it isn't nonsense, tell me what it is. For me at any rate it's\nnonsense, and for every intelligent woman about me--for I talk to some\nof them, we indulge in seditious whisperings and wit--and there isn't\none who seems to have been able to get to anything solider than I have\ndone. Each of us has had her little fling at maternity--about as much as\na washerwoman does in her odd time every two or three years--and that is\nour uttermost reality. All the rest,--trimmings! We go about the world,\nStephen, dressing and meeting each other with immense ceremony, we have\nour seasonal movements in relation to the ritual of politics and sport,\nwe travel south for the Budget and north for the grouse, we play games\nto amuse the men who keep us--not a woman would play a game for its own\nsake--we dabble with social reform and politics, for which few of us\ncare a rap except as an occupation, we 'discover' artists or musicians\nor lecturers (as though we cared), we try to believe in lovers or, still\nharder, try to believe in old or new religions, and most of us--I\ndon't--do our best to give the gratifications and exercise the\nfascinations that are expected of us....\n\n\"Something has to be done for women, Stephen. We are the heart of life,\nbirth and begetting, the home where the future grows, and your schemes\nignore us and slide about over the superficialities of things. We are\nspoiling the whole process of progress, we are turning all the\nachievements of mankind to nothingness. Men invent, create, do miracles\nwith the world, and we translate it all into shopping, into a glitter of\ndresses and households, into an immense parade of pride and excitement.\nWe excite men, we stir them to get us and keep us. Men turn from their\nideas of brotherhood to elaborate our separate cages....\n\n\"I am Justin's wife; not a thing in my heavens or my earth that is not\nsubordinated to that.\n\n\"Something has to be done for women, Stephen, something--urgently--and\nnothing is done until that is done, some release from their intolerable\nsubjection to sex, so that for us everything else in life, respect,\nfreedom, social standing, is entirely secondary to that. But what has to\nbe done? We women do not know. Our efforts to know are among the most\ndesolating of spectacles. I read the papers of those suffrage women; the\neffect is more like agitated geese upon a common than anything human has\na right to be.... That's why I turn to you. Years ago I felt, and now I\nknow, there is about you a simplicity of mind, a foolishness of faith,\nthat is stronger and greater than the cleverness of any woman alive. You\nare one of those strange men who take high and sweeping views--as larks\nsoar. It isn't that you yourself are high and sweeping.... No, but still\nI turn to you. In the old days I used to turn to you and shake your mind\nand make you think about things you seemed too sluggish to think about\nwithout my clamor. Once do you remember at Martens I shook you by the\nears.... And when I made you think, you thought, as I could never do.\nThink now--about women.\n\n\"Stephen, there are moments when it seems to me that this futility of\nwomen, this futility of men's effort _through_ women, is a fated\nfutility in the very nature of things. We may be saddled with it as we\nare with all the animal infirmities we have, with appendixes and\nsuchlike things inside of us, and the passions and rages of apes and a\ntail--I believe we have a tail curled away somewhere, haven't we?\nPerhaps mankind is so constituted that badly as they get along now they\ncouldn't get along at all if they let women go free and have their own\nway with life. Perhaps you can't have _two_ sexes loose together. You\nmust shut up one. I've a horrible suspicion that all these anti-suffrage\nmen like Lord Cromer and Sir Ray Lankester must know a lot about life\nthat I do not know. And that other man Sir Something-or-other Wright,\nwho said plainly that men cannot work side by side with women because\nthey get excited.... And yet, you know, women have had glimpses of a\nfreedom that was not mischievous. I could have been happy as a Lady\nAbbess--I must have space and dignity, Stephen--and those women had\nthings in their hands as no women have things in their hands to-day.\nThey came to the House of Lords. But they lost all that. Was there some\nsort of natural selection?...\n\n\"Stephen, you were made to answer my mind, and if you cannot do it\nnobody can. What is your outlook for women? Are we to go back to\nseclusion or will it be possible to minimize sex? If you are going to\nminimize sex how are you going to do it? Suppression? There is plenty of\nsuppression now. Increase or diminish the pains and penalties? My\nnephew, Philip's boy, Philip Christian, was explaining to me the other\nday that if you boil water in an open bowl it just boils away, and that\nif you boil it in a corked bottle it bangs everything to pieces, and\nyou have, he says, 'to look out.' But I feel that's a bad image.\nBoiling-water isn't frantically jealous, and men and women are. But\nstill suppose, suppose you trained people not to make such an awful fuss\nabout things. _Now_ you train them to make as much fuss as possible....\n\n\"Oh bother it all, Stephen! Where's your mind in these matters? Why\nhaven't you tackled these things? Why do you leave it to _me_ to dig\nthese questions into you--like opening a reluctant oyster? Aren't they\npatent? You up and answer them, Stephen--or this correspondence will\nbecome abusive....\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 5\n\nIt was true that I did ignore or minimize sexual questions as much as I\ncould. I was forced now to think why I did this. That carried me back to\nthose old days of passion, memories I had never stirred for many years.\nAnd I wrote to Mary that there was indeed no reason but a reasonable\nfear, that in fact I had dismissed them because they had been beyond my\npatience and self-control, because I could not think very much about\nthem without an egotistical reversion to the bitterness of my own case.\nAnd in avoiding them I was only doing what the great bulk of men in\nbusiness and men in affairs find themselves obliged to do. They train\nthemselves not to think of the rights and wrongs of sexual life, not to\ntolerate liberties even in their private imaginations. They know it is\nlike carrying a torch into a powder magazine. They feel they cannot\ntrust their own minds beyond the experience, tested usages, and\nconventions of the ages, because they know how many of those who have\nventured further have been blinded by mists and clouds of rhetoric, lost\nin inexplicable puzzles and wrecked disastrously. There in those half\nexplored and altogether unsettled hinterlands, lurk desires that sting\nlike adders and hatreds cruel as hell....\n\nAnd then I went on--I do not clearly remember now the exact line of\nargument I adopted--to urge upon her that our insoluble puzzles were not\nnecessarily insoluble puzzles for the world at large, that no one\nsoldier fights anything but a partial battle, and that it wasn't an\nabsolute condemnation of me to declare that I went on living and working\nfor social construction with the cardinal riddles of social order, so\nfar as they affected her, unsolved. Wasn't I at any rate preparing\napparatus for that huge effort at solution that mankind must ultimately\nmake? Wasn't this dredging out and deepening of the channels of thought\nabout the best that we could hope to do at the present time, seeing that\nto launch a keel of speculation prematurely was only to strand oneself\namong hopeless reefs and confusions? Better prepare for a voyage\nto-morrow than sail to destruction to-day.\n\nWhatever I put in that forgotten part of my letter was put less\nstrikingly than my first admissions, and anyhow it was upon these that\nMary pounced to the disregard of any other point. \"There you are,\" she\nwrote, with something like elation, \"there is a tiger in the garden and\nyou won't talk or think about it for fear of growing excited. That is my\ngrievance against so much historical and political and social\ndiscussion; its hopeless futility because of its hopeless omissions. You\nplan the world's future, taking the women and children for granted, with\nEgotistical Sex, as you call it, a prowling monster upsetting\neverything you do....\"\n\nBut I will not give you that particular letter in its order, nor its\nsuccessors. Altogether she wrote me twenty-two letters, and I one or two\nmore than that number to her, and--a thing almost inevitable in a\ndiscussion by correspondence--there is a lot of overlapping and\nrecapitulation. Those letters spread over a space of nearly two and a\nhalf years. Again and again she insists upon the monstrous exaggeration\nof the importance of sex in human life and of the need of some reduction\nof its importance, and she makes the boldest experimental suggestions\nfor the achievement of that end. But she comes slowly to recognize that\nthere is a justification for an indirect attack, that sex and the\nposition of women do not constitute the primary problem in that\nbristling system of riddles that lies like a hostile army across the\npath of mankind. And she realized too that through art, through science\nand literature and the whole enquiring and creative side of man's\nnature, lies the path by which those positions are to be outflanked, and\nthose eternal-looking impossibles and inconceivables overcome. Here is a\nfragment--saturated with the essence of her thought. Three-quarters of\nher earlier letters are variations on this theme....\n\n\"What you call 'social order,' Stephen, all the arrangements seem to me\nto be _built_ on subjection to sex even more than they are built (as you\nsay) on labor subjection. And this is an age of release, you say it is\nan age of release for the workers and they know it. And so do the women.\nJust as much. 'Wild hopes' indeed! The workers' hopes are nothing to the\nwomen's! It is not only the workers who are saying let us go free,\nmanage things differently so that we may have our lives relieved from\nthis intolerable burthen of constant toil, but the women also are saying\nlet us go free. They are demanding release just as much from their\nintolerable endless specialization as females. The tramp on the roads\nwho won't work, the swindler and the exploiter who contrive not to work,\nthe strikers who throw down their tools, no longer for twopences and\nsixpences as you say but because their way of living is no longer\ntolerable to them, and we women, who don't bear children or work or\nhelp; we are all in one movement together. We are part of the General\nStrike. I have been a striker all my life. We are doing nothing--by the\nhundred thousand. Your old social machine is working without us and in\nspite of us, it carries us along with it and we are sand in the\nbearings. I'm not a wheel, Stephen, I'm grit. What you say about the\nreactionaries and suppressionists who would stifle the complaints of\nlabor and crush out its struggles to be free, is exactly true about the\nreactionaries and suppressionists who would stifle the discussion of the\nwoman's position and crush out her hopes of emancipation....\"\n\nAnd here is a page of the peculiar doubt that was as characteristic of\nher as the quick changes of her eyes. It gives just that pessimistic\ntouch that tempered her valiant adventurousness, that gave a color at\nlast to the tragedy of her death....\n\n\"Have you ever thought, Stephen, that perhaps these (repressionist)\npeople are righter than you are--that if the worker gets free he _won't_\nwork and that if the woman gets free she won't furl her sex and stop\ndisturbing things? Suppose she _is_ wicked as a sex, suppose she _will_\ntrade on her power of exciting imaginative men. A lot of these new\nwomen run with the hare and hunt with the hounds, beguile some poor\ninnocent of a man to ruin them and then call in fathers, brother,\nhusbands, friends, chivalry, all the rest of it, and make the best of\nboth sides of a sex. Suppose we go on behaving like that. After we've\ngot all our emancipations. Suppose that the liberation of common people\nsimply means loafing, no discipline, nothing being done, an end to labor\nand the beginning of nothing to replace it, and that the liberation of\nwomen simply means the elaboration of mischief. Suppose that it is so.\nSuppose you are just tumbling the contents of the grate into the middle\nof the room. Then all this emancipation _is_ a decay, even as\nconservative-minded people say,--it's none the less a decay because we\nwant it,--and the only thing to stop it is to stop it, and to have more\ndiscipline and more suppression and say to women and the common people:\n'Back to the Sterner Virtues; Back to Servitude!' I wish I hadn't these\nreactionary streaks in my thoughts, but I have and there you are....\"\n\nAnd then towards the second year her letters began to break away from\nher preoccupation with her position as a woman and to take up new\naspects of life, more general aspects of life altogether. It had an\neffect not of her having exhausted the subject but as if, despairing of\na direct solution, she turned deliberately to the relief of other\nconsiderations. She ceased to question her own life, and taking that for\ngranted, wrote more largely of less tangible things. She remembered that\nshe had said that life, if it was no more than its present appearances,\nwas \"utter nonsense.\" She went back to that. \"One says things like\nthat,\" she wrote \"and not for a moment does one believe it. I grumble\nat my life, I seem to be always weakly and fruitlessly fighting my life,\nand I love it. I would not be willingly dead--for anything. I'd rather\nbe an old match-woman selling matches on a freezing night in the streets\nthan be dead. Nothing nonsensical ever held me so tightly or kept me so\ninterested. I suppose really I am full of that very same formless faith\non which you rely. But with me it's not only shapeless but\nintangible.... I nibble at religion. I am immensely attracted. I stand\nin the doorway. Only when they come out to persuade me to come in I am\nlike a shy child and I go away. The temples beguile me and the music,\nbut not the men. I feel I want to join _it_ and they say 'join _us_.'\nThey are--like vergers. Such small things! Such dreadful little\n_arguing_ men! They don't let you come in, they want you to say they are\nright. All the really religious people seem to be outside nowadays and\nall the pretending, cheating, atheistical, vain and limited people\nwithin....\n\n\"But the beautiful things religion gives! The beauty! Do you know Saint\nPaul's, Stephen? Latterly I have been there time after time. It is the\nmost beautiful interior in all the world, so great, so sombrely\ndignified, so perfectly balanced--and filled with such wonderful music,\nbrimming with music just as crystal water brims in a bowl of crystal.\nThe other day I went there, up into a little gallery high up under the\ndome, to hear Bach's Passion Music, the St. Matthew Passion. One hangs\nhigh and far above the little multitudes below, the white-robed singers,\nthe white-robed musicians, ranks and ranks, the great organ, the rows\nand rows and rows of congregation, receding this way, that way, into the\nhaze of the aisle and the transepts, and out of it all streams the\nsound and the singing, it pours up past you like a river, a river that\nrushes upward to some great sea, some unknown sea. The whole place is\nmusic and singing.... I hang on to the railings, Stephen, and weep--I\nhave to weep--and I wonder and wonder....\n\n\"One prays then as naturally as one drinks when one is thirsty and cold\nwater comes to hand. I don't know whom I pray to, but I pray;--of course\nI pray. Latterly, Stephen, I have been reading devotional works and\ntrying to catch that music again. I never do--definitely. Never. But at\ntimes I put down the book and it seems to me that surely a moment ago I\nheard it, that if I sit very still in a moment I shall hear it again.\nAnd I can feel it is there, I know it is there, like a bat's cry,\npitched too high for my ears. I know it is there, just as I should still\nknow there was poetry somewhere if some poor toothless idiot with no\nroof to his mouth and no knowledge of any but the commonest words tried\nto read Shelley to me....\n\n\"I wish I could pray with you, Stephen; I wish I could kneel down\nsomewhere with you of all people and pray.\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 6\n\nPresently our correspondence fell away. The gaps between our letters\nlengthened out. We never wrote regularly because for that there must be\na free exchange upon daily happenings, and neither of us cared to dwell\ntoo closely on our immediate lives. We had a regard for one another that\nleft our backgrounds vague and shadowy. She had made her appeal across\nthe sundering silences to me and I had answered, and we had poured out\ncertain things from our minds. We could not go on discussing. I was a\nvery busy man now, and she did not write except on my replies.\n\nFor a gap of nearly four months neither of us had anything to say in a\nletter at all. I think that in time our correspondence might have\naltogether died away. Then she wrote again in a more familiar strain to\ntell me of certain definite changes of relationship and outlook. She\nsaid that the estrangement between herself and Justin had increased\nduring the past year; that they were going to live practically apart;\nshe for the most part in the Surrey house where her two children lived\nwith their governesses and maids. But also she meant to snatch weeks and\nseasons for travel. Upon that they had been disputing for some time. \"I\nknow it is well with the children,\" she wrote; \"why should I be in\nperpetual attendance? I do nothing for them except an occasional kiss,\nor half-an-hour's romping. Why should one pretend? Justin and I have\nwrangled over this question of going away, for weeks, but at last\nfeminine persistence has won. I am going to travel in my own fashion and\nsee the world. With periodic appearances at his side in London and\nScotland. We have agreed at least on one thing, and that is upon a\ncompanion; she is to be my secretary in title, my moral guarantor in\nfact, and her name which is her crowning glory is Stella Summersley\nSatchel. She is blonde, erect, huffy-mannered and thoroughly up to both\nsides of her work. I partly envy her independence and rectitude--partly\nonly. It's odd and quite inconsistent of me that I don't envy her\naltogether. In theory I insist that a woman should not have charm,--it\nis our undoing. But when I meet one without it----!\n\n\"I shall also trail a maid, but I guess that young woman will learn what\nit is to be left behind in half the cities of Europe before I have done\nwith her. I always lose my maids. They are so much more passive and\nforgettable than luggage--abroad that is. And Justin usually in the old\ndays used to remember about them. And his valet used to see after\nthem,--a most attentive man. Justin cannot, he says, have his wife\nabroad with merely a companion; people would talk; maid it must be as\nwell. And so in a week or less I shall start, unusually tailor-made, for\nSouth Germany and all that jolly country, companioned and maided. I\nshall tramp--on the feet God has given me--in stout boots. Miss\nSummersley Satchel marches, I understand, like the British infantry but\non a vegetarian 'basis,'--fancy calling your nourishment a 'basis'!--the\nmaid and so forth by _\u00c3\u0088ilgut_....\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 7\n\nAfter the letter containing that announcement she wrote to me twice\nagain, once from Oban and then after a long interval from Siena. The\nformer was a scornfully minute description of the English at their\nholidays and how the conversation went among the women after dinner.\n\"They are like a row of Japanese lanterns, all blown out long ago and\nswinging about in a wind,\" she wrote--an extravagant image that yet\nconveys something of the large, empty, unilluminating effect of a sort\nof social intercourse very vividly. In the second letter she was\nconcerned chiefly with the natural beauty of Italy and how latterly she\nhad thrice wept at beautiful things, and what this mystery of beauty\ncould be that had such power over her emotions.\n\n\"All up the hillside before the window as I write the herbage is thick\nwith anemones. They aren't scattered evenly and anyhow amongst the other\nthings but in little clusters and groups that die away and begin again,\nlike the repetitions of an air in some musical composition. I have been\nsitting and looking at them for the better part of an hour, loving them\nmore and then more, and the sweet sunlight that is on them and in among\nthem.... How marvellous are these things, Stephen! All these little\nexquisite things that are so abundant in the world, the gleaming lights\nand blossoms, the drifting scents! At times these things bring me to\nweeping.... I can't help it. It is as if God who is so stern and high,\nso terrible to all our appeals, took pity for a moment and saw fit to\nspeak very softly and tenderly....\"\n\nThat was the last letter I was ever to have from her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE ELEVENTH\n\nTHE LAST MEETING\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 1\n\nIn the summer of 1911 immediately after the coronation of King George\nthere came one of those storms of international suspicion that ever and\nagain threaten Europe with war. It seems to have been brewed by some\nGerman adepts at Welt-Politik, those privileged makers of giant bombs\nwho sit at the ears of foreign ministers suggesting idiotic wickedness,\nand it was brewed with a sublime ignorance of nearly every reality in\nthe case. A German warship without a word of notice seized Agadir on the\nAtlantic coast of Morocco, within the regions reserved to French\ninfluence; an English demand for explanations was uncivilly disregarded\nand England and France and presently Germany began vigorous preparations\nfor war. All over the world it was supposed that Germany had at last\nflung down the gauntlet. In England the war party was only too eager to\ngrasp what it considered to be a magnificent opportunity. Heaven knows\nwhat the Germans had hoped or intended by their remarkable coup; the\namazing thing to note is that they were not prepared to fight, they had\nnot even the necessary money ready and they could not get it; they had\nperhaps never intended to fight, and the autumn saw the danger disperse\nagain into diplomatic bickerings and insincerely pacific professions.\nBut in the high summer the danger had not dispersed, and in common with\nevery reasonable man I found myself under the shadow of an impending\ncatastrophe that would have been none the less gigantic and tragic\nbecause it was an imbecility. It was an occasion when everyone needs\nmust act, however trivially disproportionate his action may be to the\ndanger. I cabled Gidding who was in America to get together whatever\ninfluences were available there upon the side of pacific intervention,\nand I set such British organs as I could control or approach in the same\ndirection. It seemed probable that Italy would be drawn into any\nconflict that might ensue; it happened that there was to be a Conference\nof Peace Societies in Milan early in September, and thither I decided to\ngo in the not very certain hope that out of that assemblage some form of\nEuropean protest might be evolved.\n\nThat August I was very much run down. I had been staying in London\nthrough almost intolerably hot weather to attend a Races Congress that\nhad greatly disappointed me. I don't know particularly now why I had\nbeen disappointed nor how far the feeling was due to my being generally\nrun down by the pressure of detailed work and the stress of thinking\nabout large subjects in little scraps of time. But I know that a kind of\ndespair came over me as I sat and looked at that multicolored assembly\nand heard in succession the heavy platitudes of white men, the slick,\nthin cleverness of Hindoos, the rich-toned florid rhetoric of negroes. I\nlost sight of any germ of splendid possibility in all those people, and\nsaw all too plainly the vanity, the jealousy, the self-interests that\nshow up so harshly against the professions of every altruistic movement.\nIt seemed all such a windy business against the firm prejudices, the\nvast accumulated interests that grind race against race. We had no\ncommon purpose at all at that conference, no proposal to hold us\ntogether. So much of it was like bleating on a hillside....\n\nI wanted a holiday badly, and then came this war crisis and I felt\nunable to go away for any length of time. Even bleating it seemed to me\nwas better than acquiescence in a crime against humanity. So to get\nheart to bleat at Milan I snatched at ten days in the Swiss mountains en\nroute. A tour with some taciturn guide involving a few middling climbs\nand glacier excursions seemed the best way of recuperating. I had never\nhad any time for Switzerland since my first exile there years ago. I\ntook the advice of a man in the club whose name I now forget--if ever I\nknew it, a dark man with a scar--and went up to the Schwarzegg Hut above\nGrindelwald, and over the Strahlegg to the Grimsel. I had never been up\ninto the central mass of the Bernese Oberland before, and I was amazed\nand extraordinarily delighted by the vast lonely beauty of those\ninterminable uplands of ice. I wished I could have lingered up there.\nBut that is the tragedy of those sunlit desolations; one may not stay;\none sees and exclaims and then looks at a watch. I wonder no one has\never taken an arctic equipment up into that wilderness, and had a good\nhealing spell of lonely exaltation. I found the descent from the\nStrahlegg as much of a climb as I was disposed to undertake; for an hour\nwe were coming down frozen snow that wasn't so much a slope as a\nslightly inclined precipice....\n\nFrom the Grimsel I went over the Rhone glacier to the inn on the Furka\nPass, and then, paying off my guide and becoming frankly a pedestrian, I\nmade my way round by the Sch\u00c3\u00b6llenen gorge to Goeschenen, and over the\nSusten Joch to the Susten Pass and Stein, meaning to descend to\nMeiringen.\n\nBut I still had four days before I went on to Italy, and so I decided to\ntake one more mountain. I slept at the Stein inn, and started in the\nmorning to do that agreeable first mountain of all, the Titlis, whose\nshining genial head attracted me. I did not think a guide necessary, but\na boy took me up by a track near Gadmen, and left me to my Siegfried map\nsome way up the great ridge of rocks that overlooks the Engstlen Alp. I\na little overestimated my mountaineering, and it came about that I was\nbenighted while I was still high above the Joch Pass on my descent. Some\nof this was steep and needed caution. I had to come down slowly with my\nfolding lantern, in which a reluctant candle went out at regular\nintervals, and I did not reach the little inn at Engstlen Alp until long\nafter eleven at night. By that time I was very tired and hungry.\n\nThey told me I was lucky to get a room, only one stood vacant; I should\ncertainly not have enjoyed sleeping on a billiard table after my day's\nwork, and I ate a hearty supper, smoked for a time, meditated emptily,\nand went wearily to bed.\n\nBut I could not sleep. Usually, I am a good sleeper, but ever and again\nwhen I have been working too closely or over-exerting myself I have\nspells of wakefulness, and that night after perhaps an hour's heavy\nslumber I became thinly alert and very weary in body and spirit, and I\ndo not think I slept again. The pain in my leg that the panther had torn\nhad been revived by the day's exertion. For the greater part of my life\ninsomnia has not been disagreeable to me. In the night, in the\nstillness, one has a kind of detachment from reality, one floats there\nwithout light, without weight, feeling very little of one's body. One\nhas a certain disembodiment and one can achieve a magnanimity of\nthought, forgiveness and self-forgetfulness that are impossible while\nthe body clamors upon one's senses. But that night, because, I suppose,\nI was so profoundly fatigued, I was melancholy and despondent. I could\nfeel again the weight of the great beast upon me as he clawed me down\nand I clung--desperately, in that interminable instant before he lost\nhis hold....\n\nYes, I was extraordinarily wretched that night. I was filled with\nself-contempt and self-disgust. I felt that I was utterly weak and vain,\nand all the pretensions and effort of my life mere florid, fruitless\npretensions and nothing more. I had lost all control over my mind.\nThings that had seemed secondary before became primary, difficult things\nbecame impossible things. I had been greatly impeded and irritated in\nLondon by the manoeuvres of a number of people who were anxious to make\ncapital out of the crisis, self-advertising people who wanted at any\ncost to be lifted into a position of unique protest.... You see, that\nunfortunate Nobel prize has turned the advocacy of peace into a highly\nspeculative profession; the qualification for the winner is so vaguely\ndefined that a vast multitude of voluntary idealists has been created\nand a still greater number diverted from the unendowed pursuit of human\nwelfare in other directions. Such a man as myself who is known to\ncommand a considerable publicity is necessarily a prey to those moral\n_entrepreneurs_. All sorts of ridiculous and petty incidents had forced\nthis side of public effort upon me, but hitherto I had been able to say,\nwith a laugh or sigh as the case warranted, \"So much is dear old\nhumanity and all of us\"; and to remember the great residuum of nobility\nthat remained. Now that last saving consideration refused to be\ncredible. I lay with my body and my mind in pain thinking these people\nover, thinking myself over too with the rest of my associates, thinking\ndrearily and weakly, recalling spites, dishonesties and vanities, feuds\nand absurdities, until I was near persuaded that all my dreams of wider\nhuman understandings, of great ends beyond the immediate aims and\npassions of common everyday lives, could be at best no more than the\nrefuge of shy and weak and ineffective people from the failure of their\npersonal lives....\n\nWe idealists are not jolly people, not honest simple people; the strain\ntells upon us; even to ourselves we are unappetizing. Aren't the burly,\nbellowing fellows after all righter, with their simple natural hostility\nto everything foreign, their valiant hatred of everything unlike\nthemselves, their contempt for aspiring weakness, their beer and lush\nsentiment, their here-to-day-and-gone-tomorrow conviviality and\nfellowship? Good fellows! While we others, lost in filmy speculations,\nin moon-and-star snaring and the chase of dreams, stumble where even\nthey walk upright....\n\nYou know I have never quite believed in myself, never quite believed in\nmy work or my religion. So it has always been with me and always, I\nsuppose, will be. I know I am purblind, I know I do not see my way\nclearly nor very far; I have to do with things imperfectly apprehended.\nI cannot cheat my mind away from these convictions. I have a sort of\nhesitation of the soul as other men have a limp in their gait. God, I\nsuppose, has a need for lame men. God, I suppose, has a need for blind\nmen and fearful and doubting men, and does not intend life to be\naltogether swallowed up in staring sight. Some things are to be reached\nbest by a hearing that is not distracted by any clearer senses. But so\nit is with me, and this is the innermost secret I have to tell you.\n\nI go valiantly for the most part I know, but despair is always near to\nme. In the common hours of my life it is as near as a shark may be near\na sleeper in a ship; the thin effectual plank of my deliberate faith\nkeeps me secure, but in these rare distresses of the darkness the plank\nseems to become transparent, to be on the verge of dissolution, a sense\nof life as of an abyssmal flood, full of cruelty, densely futile,\nblackly aimless, penetrates my defences....\n\nI don't think I can call these stumblings from conviction unbelief; the\nlimping man walks for all his limping, and I go on in spite of my falls.\n\"Though he slay me yet will I trust in him....\"\n\nI fell into an inconsecutive review of my life under this light that\ntouched every endeavor with the pale tints of failure. And as that flow\nof melancholy reflection went on, it was shot more and more frequently\nwith thoughts of Mary. It was not a discursive thinking about Mary but a\ndefinite fixed direction of thought towards her. I had not so thought of\nher for many years. I wanted her, I felt, to come to me and help me out\nof this distressful pit into which my spirit had fallen. I believed she\ncould. I perceived our separation as an irreparable loss. She had a\nharder, clearer quality than I, a more assured courage, a readier, surer\nmovement of the mind. Always she had \"lift\" for me. And then I had a\ncurious impression that I had heard her voice calling my name, as one\nmight call out in one's sleep. I dismissed it as an illusion, and then I\nheard it again. So clearly that I sat up and listened--breathless....\n\nMixed up with all this was the intolerable uproar and talking of a\nlittle cascade not fifty yards from the hotel. It is curious how\ndistressing that clamor of running water, which is so characteristic of\nthe Alpine night, can become. At last those sounds can take the likeness\nof any voice whatever. The water, I decided, had called to me, and now\nit mocked and laughed at me....\n\nThe next morning I descended at some late hour by Swiss reckoning, and\ndiscovered two ladies in the morning sunlight awaiting breakfast at a\nlittle green table. One rose slowly at the sight of me, and stood and\nsurveyed me with a glad amazement.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 2\n\nThere she stood real and solid, a little unfamiliar in her tweeds and\nwith her shining eyes intimate and unforgettable, as though I had never\nceased to see them for all those intervening years. And bracing us both\nand holding back our emotion was, quite unmistakably, Miss Summersley\nSatchel, a blonde business-like young woman with a stumpy nose very\ncruelly corrugated and inflamed by a pince-nez that savagely did much\nmore than its duty by its name. She remained seated, tilting her chair\na little, pushing herself back from the table and regarding\nme--intelligently.\n\nIt was one of those moments in life when one is taken unawares. I think\nour common realization of the need of masking the reality of our\nencounter, the hasty search in our minds for some plausible face upon\nthis meeting, must have been very obvious to the lady who observed us.\nMary's first thought was for a pseudonym. Mine was to make it plain we\nmet by accident.\n\n\"It's Mr.--Stephen!\" said Mary.\n\n\"It's you!\"\n\n\"Dropped out of the sky!\"\n\n\"From over there. I was benighted and go there late.\"\n\n\"Very late?\"\n\n\"One gleam of light--and a yawning waiter. Or I should have had to break\nwindows.... And then I meet you!\"\n\nThen for a moment or so we were silent, with our sense of the immense\ngravity of this position growing upon us. A little tow-headed waiter-boy\nappeared with their coffee and rolls on a tray poised high on his hand.\n\n\"You'll have your coffee out here with us?\" said Mary.\n\n\"Where else?\" said I, as though there was no conceivable alternative,\nand told the tow-headed waiter.\n\nBelatedly Mary turned to introduce me to her secretary: \"My friend Miss\nSummersley Satchel. Mr.--Stephen.\" Miss Satchel and I bowed to each\nother and agreed that the lake was very beautiful in the morning light.\n\"Mr. Stephen,\" said Mary, in entirely unnecessary explanation, \"is an\nold friend of my mother's. And I haven't seen him for years. How is\nMrs. Stephen--and the children?\"\n\nI answered briefly and began to tell of my climb down the Titlis. I\naddressed myself with unnecessary explicitness to Miss Satchel. I did\nperhaps over-accentuate the extreme fortuitousness of my appearance....\nFrom where I stood, the whole course of the previous day after I had\ncome over the shoulder was visible. It seemed a soft little shining\npathway to the top, but the dangers of the descent had a romantic\nintensification in the morning light. \"The rule of the game,\" said I,\n\"is that one stops and waits for daylight. I wonder if anyone keeps that\nrule.\"\n\nWe talked for a time of mountains, I still standing a little aloof until\nmy coffee came. Miss Summersley Satchel produced that frequent and most\nunpleasant bye-product of a British education, an intelligent interest\nin etymology. \"I wonder,\" she said, with a brow of ruffled omniscience\nand eyeing me rather severely with a magnified eye, \"why it is _called_\nTitlis. There must be _some_ reason....\"\n\nPresently Miss Satchel was dismissed indoors on a transparent excuse and\nMary and I were alone together. We eyed one another gravely. Perhaps all\nthe more gravely because of the wild excitement that was quickening our\npulse and breathing, and thrilling through our nerves. She pushed back\nthe plate before her and put her dear elbows on the table and dropped\nher chin between her hands in an attitude that seemed all made of little\nmemories.\n\n\"I suppose,\" she said, \"something of this kind was bound to happen.\"\n\nShe turned her eyes to the mountains shining in the morning light. \"I'm\nglad it has happened in a beautiful place. It might have\nbeen--anywhere.\"\n\n\"Last night,\" I said, \"I was thinking of you and wanting to hear your\nvoice again. I thought I did.\"\n\n\"I too. I wonder--if we had some dim perception....\"\n\nShe scanned my face. \"Stephen, you're not much changed. You're looking\nwell.... But your eyes--they're dog-tired eyes. Have you been working\ntoo hard?\"\n\n\"A conference--what did you call them once?--a Carnegieish conference in\nLondon. Hot weather and fussing work and endless hours of weak grey\ndusty speeches, and perhaps that clamber over there yesterday was too\nmuch. It _was_ too much. In India I damaged a leg.... I had meant to\nrest here for a day.\"\n\n\"Well,--rest here.\"\n\n\"With you!\"\n\n\"Why not? Now you are here.\"\n\n\"But---- After all, we've promised.\"\n\n\"It's none of our planning, Stephen.\"\n\n\"It seems to me I ought to go right on--so soon as breakfast is over.\"\n\nShe weighed that with just the same still pause, the same quiet moment\nof lips and eyes that I recalled so well. It was as things had always\nbeen between us that she should make her decision first and bring me to\nit.\n\n\"It isn't natural,\" she decided, \"with the sun rising and the day still\nfreshly beginning that you should go or that I should go. I've wanted to\nmeet you like this and talk about things,--ten thousand times. And as\nfor me Stephen I _won't_ go. And I won't let you go if I can help it.\nNot this morning, anyhow. No. Go later in the day if you will, and let\nus two take this one talk that God Himself has given us. We've not\nplanned it. It's His doing, not ours.\"\n\nI sat, yielding. \"I am not so sure of God's participation,\" I said. \"But\nI know I am very tired, and glad to be with you. I can't tell you how\nglad. So glad---- I think I should weep if I tried to say it....\"\n\n\"Three, four, five hours perhaps--even if people know. Is it so much\nworse than thirty minutes? We've broken the rules already; we've been\nflung together; it's not our doing, Stephen. A little while longer--adds\nso little to the offence and means to us----\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"but--if Justin knows?\"\n\n\"He won't.\"\n\n\"Your companion?\"\n\nThere was the briefest moment of reflection. \"She's discretion itself,\"\nshe said.\n\n\"Still----\"\n\n\"If he's going to know the harm is done. We may as well be hung for a\nsheep as a lamb. And he won't know. No one will know.\"\n\n\"The people here.\"\n\n\"Nobody's here. Not a soul who matters. I doubt if they know my name....\nNo one ever talks to me.\"\n\nI sat in the bright sunshine, profoundly enervated and quite convinced,\nbut still maintaining out of mere indolence a show of hesitation....\n\n\"You take the good things God sends you, Stephen--as I do. You stay and\ntalk with me now, before the curtain falls again. We've tired of\nletters. You stay and talk to me.\n\n\"Here we are, Stephen, and it's the one chance that is ever likely to\ncome to us in all our lives. We'll keep the point of honor; and you\nshall go to-day. But don't let's drive the point of honor into the\nquick. Go easy Stephen, old friend.... My dear, my dear! What has\nhappened to you? Have you forgotten? Of course! Is it possible for you\nto go, mute, with so much that we can say.... And these mountains and\nthis sunlight!...\"\n\nI looked up to see her with her elbows on the table and her hands\nclasped under her chin; that face close to mine, her dear blue eyes\nwatching me and her lips a little apart.\n\nNo other human being has ever had that effect upon me, so that I seem to\nfeel the life and stir in that other body more than I feel my own.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 3\n\nFrom the moment when I confessed my decision to stay we gave no further\nthought to the rightfulness or wisdom of spending the next few hours\ntogether. We thought only of those hours. Things lent themselves to us.\nWe stood up and walked out in front of the hotel and there moored to a\nstake at the edge of the water was a little leaky punt, the one vessel\non the Engstlen See. We would take food with us as we decided and row\nout there to where the vast cliffs came sheer from the water, out of\nearshot or interference and talk for all the time we had. And I remember\nnow how Mary stood and called to Miss Satchel's window to tell her of\nthis intention, and how I discovered again that exquisite slender grace\nI knew so well.\n\nYou know the very rowing out from the shore had in it something sweet\nand incredible. It was as if we were but dreaming together and might at\nany moment awaken again, countless miles and a thousand things apart. I\nrowed slowly with those clumsy Swiss oars that one must thrust forward,\nbreaking the smooth crystal of the lake, and she sat sideways looking\nforward, saying very little and with much the same sense I think of\nenchantment and unreality. And I saw now for the first time as I watched\nher over my oars that her face was changed; she was graver and, I\nthought, stronger than the Mary I had known.\n\nEven now I can still doubt if that boat and lake were real. And yet I\nremember even minute and irrelevant details of the day's impressions\nwith an extraordinary and exquisite vividness. Perhaps it is that very\nluminous distinctness which distinguishes these events from the common\nexperiences of life and puts them so above the quality of things that\nare ordinarily real.\n\nWe rowed slowly past a great headland and into the bay at the upper end\nof the water. We had not realized at first that we could row beyond the\nrange of the hotel windows. The rock that comes out of the lake is a\nclear dead white when it is dry, and very faintly tinted, but when it is\nwetted it lights warmly with flashes and blotches of color, and is seen\nto be full of the most exquisite and delicate veins. It splinters\nvertically and goes up in cliffs, very high and sculptured, with a\nquality almost of porcelain, that at a certain level suddenly become\nmore rude and massive and begin to overhang. Under the cliffs the water\nis very deep and blue-green, and runs here and there into narrow clefts.\nThis place where we landed was a kind of beach left by the recession of\nthe ice, all the rocks immediately about us were ice-worn, and the place\nwas paved with ice-worn boulders. Two huge bluffs put their foreheads\ntogether above us and hid the glacier from us, but one could feel the\nnear presence of ice in the air. Out between them boiled a little\ntorrent, and spread into a hundred intercommunicating channels amidst\nthe great pebbles. And those pebbles were covered by a network of\nmarvellously gnarled and twisted stems bearing little leaves and\nblossoms, a network at once very ancient and very fresh, giving a\npeculiar gentleness and richness to the Alpine severity that had dwarfed\nand tangled them. It was astounding that any plant could find\nnourishment among those stones. The great headland, with patches of\nyellowish old snow still lingering here and there upon its upper masses,\nhad crept insensibly between us and the remote hotel and now hid it\naltogether. There was nothing to remind us of the world that had\nseparated us, except that old and leaky boat we had drawn up upon the\nstones at the limpid water's edge.\n\n\"It is as if we had come out of life together,\" she whispered, giving a\nvoice to my thought.\n\nShe sat down upon a boulder and I sat on a lower slab a yard or so away,\nand we looked at one another. \"It's still unreal,\" she said.\n\nI felt awkward and at a loss as I sat there before her, as a man unused\nto drawing-rooms might feel in the presence of a strange hostess.\n\n\"You are so _you_,\" I said; \"so altogether my nearest thing--and so\nstrange too, so far off, that I feel--shy....\n\n\"I'm shy,\" I repeated. \"I feel that if I speak loudly all this will\nvanish....\"\n\nI looked about me. \"But surely this is the most beautiful place in the\nwhole world! Is it indeed in the world?\"\n\n\"Stephen, my dear,\" she began presently, \"what a strange thing life is!\nStrange! The disproportions! The things that will not fit together. The\nlittle things that eat us up, and the beautiful things that might save\nus and don't save us, don't seem indeed to have any meaning in regard to\nordinary sensible affairs.... This _beauty_....\n\n\"Do you remember, Stephen, how long ago in the old park you and I talked\nabout immortality and you said then you did not want to know anything of\nwhat comes after life. Even now do you want to know? You are too busy\nand I am not busy enough. I want to be sure, not only to know, but to\nknow that it is so, that this life--no, not _this_ life, but that life,\nis only the bleak twilight of the morning. I think death--just dead\ndeath--after the life I have had is the most impossible of ends.... You\ndon't want--particularly? I want to passionately. I _want_ to live\nagain--out of this body, Stephen, and all that it carves with it, to be\nfree--as beautiful things are free. To be free as this is free--an\nexquisite clean freedom....\n\n\"I can't believe that the life of this earth is all that there is for\nus--or why should we ever think it strange? Why should we still find the\nordinary matter-of-fact things of everyday strange? We do--because they\naren't--_us_.... Eating. Stuffing into ourselves thin slices of what\nwere queer little hot and eager beasts.... The perpetual need to do such\nthings. And all the mad fury of sex, Stephen!... We don't live, we\nsuffocate in our living bodies. They storm and rage and snatch; it isn't\n_us_, Stephen, really. It can't be us. It's all so excessive--if it is\nanything more than the first furious rush into existence of beings that\nwill go on--go on at last to quite beautiful real things. Like this\nperhaps. To-day the world is beautiful indeed with the sun shining and\nlove shining and you, my dear, so near to me.... It's so incredible that\nyou and I must part to-day. It's as if--someone told me the sun was a\nlittle mad. It's so perfectly natural to be with you again....\"\n\nHer voice sank. She leant a little forward towards me. \"Stephen, suppose\nthat you and I were dead to-day. Suppose that when you imagined you were\nclimbing yesterday, you died. Suppose that yesterday you died and that\nyou just thought you were still climbing as you made your way to me.\nPerhaps you are dead up there on the mountain and I am lying dead in my\nroom in this hotel, and this is the Great Beginning....\n\n\"Stephen, I am talking nonsense because I am so happy to be with you\nhere....\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 4\n\nFor a time we said very little. Then irregularly, disconnectedly, we\nbegan to tell each other things about ourselves.\n\nThe substance of our lives seemed strangely objective that day; we had\nas it were come to one another clean out of our common conditions. She\ntold me of her troubles and her secret weaknesses; we bared our spirits\nand confessed. Both of us had the same tale of mean and angry and hasty\nimpulses, both of us could find kindred inconsistencies, both had an\nexalted assurance that the other would understand completely and forgive\nand love. She talked for the most part, she talked much more than I,\nwith a sort of wonder at the things that had happened to her, and for\nlong spaces we did not talk at all nor feel the need of talking, and\nwhat seems very strange to me now, seeing that we had been impassioned\nlovers, we never kissed; we never kissed at all; I do not even remember\nthat I thought of kissing her. We had a shyness between us that kept us\na little apart, and I cannot remember that we ever touched one another\nexcept that for a time she took me and led me by the hand towards a\nlittle place of starry flowers that had drawn her eyes and which she\nwished me to see. Already for us two our bodies were dead and gone. We\nwere shy, shy of any contact, we were a little afraid of one another,\nthere was a kind of awe between us that we had met again.\n\nAnd in that strange and beautiful place her fancy that we were dead\ntogether had a fitness that I cannot possibly convey to you. I cannot\ngive you by any writing the light and the sweet freshness of that high\ndesolation. You would need to go there. What was lovely in our talk,\nbeing said in that setting, would seem but a rambling discourse were I\nto write it down,--as I believe that even now I could write it\ndown--word for word almost, every thought of it, so fresh does it remain\nwith me....\n\nMy dear, some moments are eternal. It seems to me that as I write to\ntell you of this I am telling you not of something that happened two\nyears ago but of a thing immortal. It is as if I and Mary were together\nthere holding the realities of our lives before us as though they were\nlittle sorry tales written in books upon our knees....\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 5\n\nIt was still in the early afternoon that we came down again across the\nmeandering ice-water streams to our old boat, and pushed off and rowed\nslowly out of that magic corner back to every-day again....\n\nLittle we knew to what it was we rowed.\n\nAs we glided across the water and rounded the headland and came slowly\ninto view of the hotel again, Mary was reminded of our parting and for a\nlittle while she was disposed to make me remain. \"If you could stay a\nlittle longer,\" she said,--\"Another day? If any harm is done, it's\ndone.\"\n\n\"It has been beautiful,\" I said, \"this meeting. It's just as if--when I\nwas so jaded and discouraged that I could have put my work aside and\ndespaired altogether,--some power had said, 'Have you forgotten the\nfriendship I gave you?' ... But we shall have had our time. We've\nmet,--we've seen one another, we've heard one another. We've hurt no\none....\"\n\n\"You will go?\"\n\n\"To-day. Before sunset. Isn't it right that I should go?\"\n\n\"Stay,\" she whispered, with a light in her eyes.\n\n\"No. I dare not.\"\n\nShe did not speak for a long time.\n\n\"Of course,\" she said at last, \"you're right. You only said--I would\nhave said it for you if you had not. You're so right, Stephen.... I\nsuppose, poor silly little things, that if you stayed we should\ncertainly begin making love to each other. It would be--necessary. We\nshould fence about a little and then there it would be. No barrier--to\nstop us. And neither of us wants it to happen. It isn't what we want.\nYou would become urgent, I suppose, and I should be--coquettish. In\nspite of ourselves that power would make us puppets. As if already we\nhadn't made love.... I could find it in my heart now.... Stephen I could\n_make_ you stay....\n\n\"Oh! Why are we so tormented, Stephen? In the next world we shall meet,\nand this will trouble us no longer. The love will be there--oh, the love\nwill be there, like something that has at last got itself fully born,\ngot itself free from some queer clinging seed-case....\n\n\"We shall be rid of jealousy, Stephen, that inflammation of the mind,\nthat bitterness, that pitiless sore, so that I shan't be tormented by\nthe thought of Rachel and she will be able to tolerate me. She was so\nsweet and wonderful a girl--with those dark eyes. And I've never done\nher justice--never. Nor she me. I snatched you from her. I snatched\nyou....\n\n\"Someday we shall be different.... All this putting oneself round\nanother person like a fence, against everyone else, almost against\neverything else; it's so wicked, so fierce.\n\n\"It's so possible to be different. Sometimes now, sometimes for long\nparts of a day I have no base passions at all--even in this life. To be\nlike that always! But I can't see clearly how these things can be; one\ndreams of them in a kind of luminous mist, and if one looks directly at\nthem, they vanish again....\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 6\n\nAnd at last we came to the landing, and moored the little boat and\nwalked up the winding path to the hotel. The dull pain of separation was\nalready upon us.\n\nI think we had forgotten Miss Summersley Satchel altogether. But she\nappeared as we sat down to tea at that same table at which we had\nbreakfasted, and joined us as a matter of course. Conceivably she found\nthe two animated friends of the morning had become rather taciturn.\nIndeed there came a lapse of silence so portentous that I roused myself\nto effort and told her, all over again, as I realized afterwards, the\ndifficulties that had benighted me upon Titlis. Then Miss Satchel\nregaled Mary with some particulars of the various comings and goings of\nthe hotel. I became anxious to end this tension and went into the inn to\npay my bill and get my knapsack. When I came out Mary stood up.\n\n\"I'll come just a little way with you, Stephen,\" she said, and I could\nhave fancied the glasses of the companion flashed to hear the surname of\nthe morning reappear a Christian name in the afternoon....\n\n\"Is that woman behind us safe?\" I asked, breaking the silence as we went\nup the mountain-side.\n\nMary looked over her shoulder for a contemplative second.\n\n\"She's always been--discretion itself.\"\n\nWe thought no more of Miss Satchel.\n\n\"This parting,\" said Mary, \"is the worst of the price we have to\npay.... Now it comes to the end there seem a thousand things one hasn't\nsaid....\"\n\nAnd presently she came back to that. \"We shan't remember this so much\nperhaps. It was there we met, over there in the sunlight--among those\nrocks. I suppose--perhaps--we managed to say something....\"\n\nAs the ascent grew steeper it became clear that if I was to reach the\nMelch See Inn by nightfall, our moment for parting had come. And with a\n\"Well,\" and a white-lipped smile and a glance at the Argus-eyed hotel,\nshe held out her hand to me. \"I shall live on this, brother Stephen,\"\nshe said, \"for years.\"\n\n\"I too,\" I answered....\n\nIt was wonderful to stand and face her there, and see her real and\nliving with the warm sunlight on her, and her face one glowing\ntenderness. We clasped hands; all the warm life of our hands met and\nclung and parted.\n\nI went on alone up the winding path,--it zigzags up the mountain-side in\nfull sight of the hotel for the better part of an hour--climbing\nsteadily higher and looking back and looking back until she was just a\nlittle strip of white--that halted and seemed to wave to me. I waved\nback and found myself weeping. \"You fool!\" I said to myself, \"Go on\";\nand it was by an effort that I kept on my way instead of running back to\nher again. Presently the curvature of the slope came up between us and\nhid her altogether, hid the hotel, hid the lakes and the cliffs....\n\nIt seemed to me that I could not possibly see her any more. It was as if\nI knew that sun had set for ever.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 7\n\nI lay at the Melch See Inn that night, and rose betimes and started down\nthat wild grey gorge in the early morning light. I walked to Sachseln,\ncaught an early train to Lucerne and went on in the afternoon to Como.\nAnd there I stayed in the sunshine taking a boat and rowing alone far up\nthe lake and lying in it, thinking of love and friendship and the\naccidents and significance of my life, and for the most part not\nthinking at all but feeling, feeling the glow of our meeting and the\nfinality of our separation, as one feels the clear glow of a sunset when\nthe wind rises and the cold night draws near. Everything was pervaded by\nthe sense of her. Just over those mountains, I thought, is Mary. I was\nalone in my boat, but her presence filled the sky. It seemed to me that\nat any moment I could go to her. And the last vestige of any cloud\nbetween us for anything we had done or failed to do in these crises of\ndistress and separation, had vanished and gone altogether.\n\nIn the afternoon I wrote to Rachel. I had not written to her for three\ndays, and even now I told her nothing of my meeting with Mary. I had not\nwritten partly because I could not decide whether I should tell her of\nthat or not; in the end I tried to hide it from her. It seemed a little\nthing in regard to her, a thing that could not hurt her, a thing as\ndetached from her life and as inconsecutive as a dream in my head.\n\nThree days later I reached Milan, a day before the formal opening of the\nPeace Congress. But I found a telegram had come that morning to the\nPoste Restante to banish all thought of my pacific mission from my\nmind. It came from Paris and its blue ribbon of text ran:\n\n\n     _\"Come back at once to London. Justin has been told of our meeting\n     and is resolved upon divorce. Will do all in my power to explain\n     and avert but feel you should know at once.\"_\n\n\nThere are some things so monstrously destructive to all we hold dear\nthat for a time it is impossible to believe them. I remember now that as\nI read that amazing communication through--at the first reading it was a\nlittle difficult to understand because the Italian operator had guessed\nat one or two of the words, no real sense of its meaning came to me.\nThat followed sluggishly. I felt as one might feel when one opens some\noffensive anonymous letter or hears some preposterous threat.\n\n\"What _nonsense_!\" I said, faint-heartedly. I stood for a time at my\nbedroom window trying to shake this fact altogether off my mind. But it\nstayed, and became more and more real. Suddenly with a start I perceived\nit was real. I had to do things forthwith.\n\nI rang the bell and asked for an _Orario_. \"I shan't want these rooms. I\nhave to go back to England,\" I said. \"Yes,--I have had bad news.\" ...\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 8\n\n\"We've only got to explain,\" I told myself a hundred times during that\nlong sleepless journey. The thundering wheels so close beneath my head\nechoed: \"Explain. Oh yes! Explain! Explain! Explain!\"\n\nAnd something, a voice to which I would not listen, urged: \"Suppose\nthey do not choose to believe what you explain.\"\n\nWhen I sat face to face with Maxwell Hartington, my solicitor, in his\nink-splashed, dirty, yellow-grained room with its rows of black tin\nboxes, I could no longer ignore that possibility. Maxwell Hartington sat\nback in his chair after his fashion, listening to my story, breathing\nnoisily through his open mouth, perspiring little beads and looking more\nout of condition than ever. I never knew a man so wine-sodden and so\nsharp-witted.\n\n\"That's all very well, Stratton,\" he said, \"between ourselves. Very\nunfortunate and all that sort of thing. But it doesn't satisfy Justin\nevidently; and we've got to put a different look on it if we can, before\nwe go before a jury: You see----\" He seemed to be considering and\nrejecting unpalatable phrases \"They won't understand.\"\n\n\"But,\" I said, \"after all--, a mere chance of the same hotel. There must\nbe more evidence than that.\"\n\n\"You spent the night in adjacent rooms,\" he said dryly.\n\n\"Adjacent rooms!\" I cried.\n\nHe regarded me for a moment with something bordering on admiration.\n\"Didn't you know?\" he said.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"They've routed that out. You were sleeping with your two heads within a\nyard of one another anyhow. Thirty-six you had, and she had\nthirty-seven.\"\n\n\"But,\" I said and stopped.\n\nMaxwell Hartington's admiration gave place I think to a slight\nresentment at my sustained innocence. \"And Lady Mary changed rooms with\nher secretary two nights before--to be near the vacant room. The\nsecretary went into number 12 on the floor below,--a larger room, at\nthirteen francs a day, and one not exposed to the early daylight....\"\n\nHe turned over a paper on his desk. \"You didn't know, of course,\" he\nsaid. \"But what I want to have\"--and his voice grew wrathful--\"is sure\nevidence that you didn't know. No jury on earth is going to believe you\ndidn't know. No jury!---- Why,\"--his mask dropped--\"no man on earth is\ngoing to believe a yarn like that! If that's all you have, Stratton----\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 9\n\nOur London house was not shut up--two servants were there on board-wages\nagainst the possibility of such a temporary return as I was now\nmaking--Rachel was away with you three children at Cromingham. I had not\ntold her I was returning to London, and I had put up at one of my clubs.\nUntil I had had a second interview with Maxwell Hartington I still would\nnot let myself think that it was possible that Mary and I would fail\nwith our explanations. We had the common confidence of habitually\nunchallenged people that our word would be accepted. I had hoped indeed\nto get the whole affair settled and abolished without anything of it\ncoming to Rachel's ears. Then at my leisure I should be able to tell her\nexactly how things had come about. But each day made it clearer that\nthings were not going to be settled, that the monstrous and the\nincredible was going to happen and that Justin had set his mind\nimplacably upon a divorce. My sense of complete innocence had already\nbeen shaken by Maxwell Hartington; I had come to perceive that we had\nbeen amazingly indiscreet, I was beginning to think we had been\ncriminally indiscreet.\n\nI saw Maxwell Hartington for a second time, and it became clear to me I\nmust abandon any hope of keeping things further from Rachel. I took my\nluggage round to my house, to the great astonishment of the two\nservants,--they had supposed of course that I was in Italy--and then\nwent down on the heels of a telegram to Rachel. I forget the wording of\nthat telegram, but it was as little alarming as possible; I think I said\nsomething about \"back in London for documents; shall try to get down to\nyou.\" I did not specify any particular train or indeed state definitely\nthat I was coming that day.\n\nI had never been to Cromingham before. I went to the house you occupied\non the Esplanade and learnt that you were all upon the beach. I walked\nalong the sea-wall scrutinizing the various bright groups of children\nand nursemaids and holiday people that were scattered over the sands. It\nwas a day of blazing sunshine, and, between the bright sky and the\nsilver drabs of the sand stretched the low levels of a sea that had its\ncustomary green-grey touched for once with something of the sapphire\nglow of the Mediterranean. Here and there were gay little umbrella tents\nor canvas shelters, and a bather or so and pink and white wading\nchildren broke the dazzling edge of foam. And I sought you with a kind\nof reluctance as though finding you would bring nearer the black\nirrational disaster that hung over us all.\n\nAnd when I found you at last you were all radiantly happy and healthy,\nthe prettiest of families, and only your mother was touched with any\ngravity deeper than the joy of sunshine and sea. You and Mademoiselle\nPotin--in those days her ministrations were just beginning--were busy\nconstructing a great sea-wall that should really and truly stop the\nadvancing tide. Rachel Two was a little apart, making with infinite\ncontentment an endless multitude of conical sand pies with her little\ntin pail. Margaret, a pink inarticulate lump, scrabbled in the warm sand\nunder Jessica's care. Your mother sat and watched you--thoughtfully. And\nbefore any of you knew that I was there my shadow fell across you all.\n\nYou accepted my appearance when I ought to have been in Italy with the\nunquestioning confidence with which you still take all my comings and\ngoings. For you, Italy, America, any place is just round the corner. I\nwas kissed with affection but haste, and you got back to your sand-works\nas speedily as possible. I inspected Rachel Two's mounds,--she was\ngiving them the names of her various aunts and uncles--and patted the\ncrowing Margaret, who ignored me. Rachel had sprung to her feet and\nkissed me and now hovered radiant over me as I caressed you youngsters.\nIt was all so warm, so real, that for an instant the dark threat that\nhung over us all vanished from my skies, to return with the force of a\nblow.\n\n\"And what has brought you back?\" said Rachel. \"I had expected a month of\nwidowhood. What can have brought you back?\"\n\nThe dancing gladness in her eyes vanished swiftly as she waited for an\nanswer to her question. She caught the note of tragedy from my face.\n\"Why have you come back from Italy?\" she asked in an altered voice.\n\n\"Rachel,\" I said taking her arm, with a desolating sense of the\nfutility in my gesture of protection; \"let us walk along the beach. I\nwant to tell you something---- Something rather complicated.\"\n\n\"Is there going to be war, Stephen?\" she asked abruptly.\n\nIt seemed then that this question which merely concerned the welfare of\na hundred million people or so and pain, destruction and disaster beyond\nmeasure, was the most trivial of digressions.\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"I haven't thought about the war.\"\n\n\"But I thought--you were thinking of nothing else.\"\n\n\"This has put it out of my head. It's something---- Something disastrous\nto us.\"\n\n\"Something has happened to our money?\"\n\n\"I wish that was all.\"\n\n\"Then what is it?\" Her mind flashed out. \"It has something to do with\nMary Justin.\"\n\n\"How did you know that?\"\n\n\"I guessed.\"\n\n\"Well. It is. You see--in Switzerland we met.\"\n\n\"You _met_!\"\n\n\"By accident. She had been staying at the hotel on Engstlen Alp.\"\n\n\"You slept there!\" cried Rachel.\n\n\"I didn't know she was in the hotel until the next day.\"\n\n\"And then you came away!\"\n\n\"That day.\"\n\n\"But you talked together?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And for some reason---- You never told me, Stephen! You never told me.\nAnd you met. But---- Why is this, disaster?\"\n\n\"Because Justin knows and he means to divorce her--and it may be he\nwill succeed....\"\n\nRachel's face had become white, for some time she said nothing. Then\nslowly, \"And if he had not known and done that--I should never have\nknown.\"\n\nI had no answer to make to that. It was true. Rachel's face was very\nstill, and her eyes stared at the situation laid bare to her.\n\n\"When you began,\" she choked presently, \"when she wrote--I knew--I\nfelt----\"\n\nShe ceased for fear she might weep, and for a time we walked in silence.\n\n\"I suppose,\" she said desperately at last, \"he will get his divorce.\"\n\n\"I am afraid he will.\"\n\n\"There's no evidence--you didn't....\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And I never dreamt----!\"\n\nThen her passion tore at her. \"Stephen my dear,\" she wept, \"you didn't?\nyou didn't? Stephen, indeed you didn't, did you? You kept faith with me\nas a husband should. It was an accident--a real accident--and there was\nno planning for you to meet together. It was as you say? I've never\ndoubted your word ever--I've never doubted you.\"\n\nWell, at any rate I could answer that plainly, and I did.\n\n\"And you know, Stephen,\" she said, \"I believe you. And I _can't_ believe\nyou. My heart is tormented. Why did you write to her? Why did you two\nwrite and go on writing? And why did you tell me nothing of that\nmeeting? I believe you because I can't do anything but believe you. It\nwould kill me not to believe you in a thing that came so near to us. And\nyet, there it is, like a knife being twisted in my heart--that you met.\nShould I have known of your meeting, Stephen--ever? I know I'm talking\nbadly for you.... But this thing strikes me suddenly. Out of this clear\nbeautiful sky! And the children there--so happy in the sunshine! I was\nso happy. So happy. With you coming.... It will mean shames and\nlaw-courts and newspapers, losses of friends, losses of money and\nfreedom.... My mother and my people!... And you and all the work you\ndo!... People will never forget it, never forgive it. They will say you\npromised.... If she had never written, if she had kept to her\nbargain----\"\n\n\"We should still have met.\"\n\n\"Stephen!... Stephen, you must bear with me....\"\n\n\"This is a thing,\" I said, \"that falls as you say out of the sky. It\nseemed so natural--for her to write.... And the meeting ... it is like\nsome tremendous disaster of nature. I do not feel I have deserved it. It\nis--irrational. But there it is, little Rachel of my heart, and we have\nto face it. Whatever happens we have to go on. It doesn't alter the work\nwe have to do. If it clips our wings--we have to hop along with clipped\nwings.... For you--I wish it could spare you. And she--she too is a\nvictim, Rachel.\"\n\n\"She need not have written,\" said Rachel. \"She need not have written.\nAnd then if you had met----\"\n\nShe could not go on with that.\n\n\"It is so hard,\" I said, \"to ask you to be just to her--and me. I wish I\ncould have come to you and married you--without all that legacy--of\nthings remembered.... I was what I was.... One can't shake off a thing\nin one's blood. And besides--besides----\"\n\nI stopped helplessly.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 10\n\nAnd then Mary came herself to tell me there would be no divorce.\n\nShe came to me unexpectedly. I had returned to town that evening, and\nnext morning as I was sitting down in my study to answer some\nunimportant questions Maxwell Hartington had sent me, my parlormaid\nappeared. \"Can you speak,\" she asked, \"to Lady Mary Justin?\"\n\nI stood up to receive my visitor.\n\nShe came in, a tall dark figure, and stood facing me in silence until\nthe door had closed behind her. Her face was white and drawn and very\ngrave. She stooped a little, I could see she had had no sleep, never\nbefore had I seen her face marked by pain. And she hesitated.... \"My\ndear!\" I said; \"why have you come to me?\"\n\nI put a chair for her and she sat down.\n\nFor a moment she controlled herself with difficulty. She put her hand\nover her eyes, she seemed on the verge of bitter weeping....\n\n\"I came,\" she said at last.... \"I came. I had to come ... to see you.\"\n\nI sat down in a chair beside her.\n\n\"It wasn't wise,\" I said. \"But--never mind. You look so tired, my dear!\"\n\nShe sat quite still for a little while.\n\nThen she moved her arm as though she felt for me blindly, and I put my\narms about her and drew her head to my shoulder and she wept....\n\n\"I knew,\" she sobbed, \"if I came to you....\"\n\nPresently her weeping was over.\n\n\"Get me a little cold water, Stephen,\" she said. \"Let me have a little\ncold water on my face. I've got my courage now again. Just then,--I was\ndown too low. Yes--cold water. Because I want to tell you--things you\nwill be glad to hear.\"\n\n\"You see, Stephen,\" she said--and now all her self-possession had\nreturned; \"there mustn't be a divorce. I've thought it all out. And\nthere needn't be a divorce.\"\n\n\"Needn't be?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I can stop it.\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"I can stop it. I can manage---- I can make a bargain.... It's very\nsweet, dear Stephen, to be here talking to you again.\"\n\nShe stood up.\n\n\"Sit at your desk, my dear,\" she said. \"I'm all right now. That water\nwas good. How good cold things can be! Sit down at your desk and let me\nsit here. And then I will talk to you. I've had such a time, my dear.\nAh!\"\n\nShe paused and stuck her elbows on the desk and looked me in the eyes.\nAnd suddenly that sweet, frank smile of hers swept like sunshine across\nthe wintry desolation of her face. \"We've both been having a time,\" she\nsaid. \"This odd little world,--it's battered us with its fists. For such\na little. And we were both so ridiculously happy. Do you remember it,\nthe rocks and the sunshine and all those twisted and tangled little\nplants? And how the boat leaked and you baled it out! And the parting,\nand how you trudged up that winding path away from me! A grey figure\nthat stopped and waved--a little figure--such a virtuous figure! And\nthen, this storm! this _awful_ hullabaloo! Lawyers, curses, threats----.\nAnd Stella Summersley Satchel like a Fury of denunciation. What hatred\nthat woman has hidden from me! It must have accumulated.... It's\nterrible to think, Stephen, how much I must have tried her.... Oh! how\nfar away those Alps are now, Stephen! Like something in another life....\nAnd here we are!--among the consequences.\"\n\n\"But,--you were saying we could stop the divorce.\"\n\n\"Yes. We can. I can. But I wanted to see you,--before I did. Somehow I\ndon't feel lonely with you. I had to see you.... It's good to see you.\"\n\nShe looked me in the face. Her tired eyes lit with a gleam of her former\nhumor.\n\n\"Have you thought,\" she asked, \"of all that will happen if there is a\ndivorce?\"\n\n\"I mean to fight every bit of it.\"\n\n\"They'll beat you.\"\n\n\"We'll see that.\"\n\n\"But they will. And then?\"\n\n\"Why should one meet disaster half way?\"\n\n\"Stephen!\" she said; \"what will happen to you when I am not here to make\nyou look at things? Because I shan't be here. Not within reach of\nyou.... There are times when I feel like a mother to you. Never more\nthan now....\"\n\nAnd then with rapid touches she began to picture the disaster before\nme. She pictured the Court and our ineffectual denials, she made me\nrealize the storm of hostility that was bound to burst over us. \"And\nthink of me,\" she said. \"Stripped I shall be and outcast.\"\n\n\"Not while I live!\"\n\n\"But what can you do for me? You will have Rachel. How can you stand by\nme? You can't be cruel to Rachel. You know you can't be cruel to Rachel.\nLook me in the face, Stephen; tell me. Yes.... Then how can you stand by\nme?\"\n\n\"Somehow!\" I cried foolishly and stopped.\n\n\"They'll use me to break your back with costs and damages. There'll be\nthose children of yours to think of....\"\n\n\"My God!\" I cried aloud. \"Why do you torment me? Haven't I thought\nenough of those things?... Haven't I seen the ruin and the shame, the\nhopeless trap, men's trust in me gone, my work scattered and ended\nagain, my children growing up to hear this and that exaggeration of our\nstory. And you----. All the bravery of your life scattered and wasted.\nThe thing will pursue us all, cling to us. It will be all the rest of\nour lives for us....\"\n\nI covered my face with my hands.\n\nWhen I looked up, her face was white and still, and full of a strange\ntenderness. \"I wouldn't have you, Stephen--I wouldn't have you be cruel\nto Rachel.... I just wanted to know--something.... But we're wandering.\nWe're talking nonsense. Because as I said, there need be no divorce.\nThere will be no divorce at all. That's what I came to tell you. I shall\nhave to pay--in a way, Stephen.... Not impossibly. Don't think it is\nanything impossible....\"\n\nThen she bit her lips and sat still....\n\n\"My dear,\" I whispered, \"if we had taken one another at the\nbeginning....\"\n\nBut she went on with her own thoughts.\n\n\"You love those little children of yours,\" she said. \"And that trusting\ngirl-wife.... Of course you love them. They're yours. Oh! they're so\ndeeply--yours.... Yours....\"\n\n\"Oh my dear! don't torture me! I do love them. But I love you too.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"not as you do them.\"\n\nI made a movement of protest.\n\n\"No,\" she said, whitely radiant with a serenity I had never seen before\nin her face. \"You love me with your brain. With your soul if you like. I\n_know_, my poor bleeding Stephen!--Aren't those tears there? Don't mind\nmy seeing them, Stephen.... Poor dear! Poor dear!.... You love _them_\nwith your inmost heart. Why should you mind that I see you do?... All my\nlife I've been wrong, Stephen, and now I know too late. It's the things\nwe own we love, the things we buy with our lives.... Always I have been\nhard, I've been a little hard.... Stephen, my dear, I loved you, always\nI have loved you, and always I have tried to keep myself.... It's too\nlate.... I don't know why I am talking like this.... But you see I can\nmake a bargain now--it's not an impossible bargain--and save you and\nsave your wife and save your children----\"\n\n\"But how?\" I said, still doubting.\n\n\"Never mind how, Stephen. Don't ask me how now. Nothing very difficult.\nEasy. But I shall write you no more letters--see you--no more. Never.\nAnd that's why I had to come, you see, why I was able to come to you,\njust to see you and say good-bye to you, and take leave of you, dear\nLove that I threw away and loved too late....\"\n\nShe bit her lip and faced me there, a sweet flushed living thing, with a\ntear coursing down her cheek, and her mouth now firm and steady.\n\n\"You can stop this divorce?\" I said, \"But how, Mary?\"\n\n\"No, don't ask me how. At a price. It's a bargain. No, no! Don't think\nthat,--a bargain with Justin, but not degrading. Don't, my dear, let the\nthought of it distress you. I have to give earnests.... Never, dear,\nnever through all the dusty rest of life again will you and I speak\ntogether. Never! Even if we come face to face once more--no word....\"\n\n\"Mary,\" I said, \"what is it you have to do? You speak as if---- What is\nit Justin demands?\"\n\n\"No! do not ask me that.... Tell me--you see we've so much to talk\nabout, Stephen--tell me of all you are going to do. Everything. Because\nI've got to make a great vow of renunciation--of you. Not to think\nagain--not even to think of you again.... No, no. I'm not even to look\nfor you in the papers any more. There's to be no tricks this time. And\nso you see I want to fill up my mind with you. To store myself with you.\nTell me your work is worth it--that it's not like the work of everyone.\nTell me, Stephen--_that_. I want to believe that--tremendously. Don't be\nmodest now. That will be cruel. I want to believe that I am at last to\ndo something that is worth doing, something not fruitless....\"\n\n\"Are you to go into seclusion,\" I asked suddenly, \"to be a nun----?\"\n\n\"It is something like that,\" she said; \"very like that. But I have\npromised--practically--not to tell you that. Tell me your soul, Stephen,\nnow. Give me something I may keep in my mind through--through all those\nyears of waiting....\"\n\n\"But where?\" I cried. \"What years of waiting?\"\n\n\"In a lonely place, my dear--among mountains. High and away. Very\nbeautiful, but lonely. A lake. Great rocks.... Yes,--like that place. So\nodd.... I shall have so much time to think, and I shall have no\npapers--no news. I mustn't talk to you of that. Don't let me talk to you\nof that. I want to hear about this world, this world I am going to\nleave, and how you think you are going on fighting in the hot and dusty\nstruggle--to make the world cool and kind and reasonable, to train minds\nbetter, to broaden ideas ... all those things you believe in. All those\nthings you believe in and stick to--even when they are dull. Now I am\nleaving it, I begin to see how fine it is--to fight as you want to\nfight. A tiresome inglorious lifelong fight.... You really believe,\nStephen?\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 11\n\nAnd then suddenly I read her purpose.\n\n\"Mary,\" I cried, and stood up and laid my hand upon her arm, \"Tell me\nwhat is it you mean to do. What do you mean to do?\"\n\nShe looked up at me defensively and for a moment neither of us spoke.\n\n\"Mary,\" I said, and could not say what was in my thoughts.\n\n\"You are wrong,\" she lied at last....\n\nShe stood up too and faced me. I held her shoulder and looked into her\neyes.\n\nThe gong of my little clock broke the silence.\n\n\"I must go, Stephen,\" she said. \"I did not see how the time was slipping\nby.\"\n\nI began to entreat her and she to deny. \"You don't understand,\" she\nsaid, \"you don't understand. Stephen!--I had hoped you would understand.\nYou see life,--not as I see it. I wanted--all sorts of splendid things\nand you--begin to argue. You are shocked, you refuse to understand....\nNo. No. Take your hands off me, Stephen dear, and let me go. Let me go!\"\n\n\"But,\" I said, stupid and persistent, \"what are you going to do?\"\n\n\"I've told you. Stephen. I've told you. As much as I can tell you. And\nyou think--this foolish thing. As though I could do that! Stephen, if I\npromise, will you let me go?...\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 12\n\nMy mind leaps from that to the moment in the afternoon, when torn by\nintolerable distresses and anxiety I knocked and rang, and again knocked\nat the door of the house she occupied in South Street, with the\nintention of making one last appeal to her to live--if, indeed, it was\ndeath she had in mind. I had let her go from me and instantly a hundred\nneglected things had come into my head. I could go away with her, I\ncould threaten to die with her; it seemed to me that nothing in all the\nworld mattered if only I could thrust back the dark hand of death to\nwhich she had so manifestly turned. I knew, I knew all along that her\nextorted promise would not bind her. I knew and I let the faintest\nshadow of uncertainty weaken and restrain me. And I went to her too\nlate. I saw instantly that I was too late when the door opened and\nshowed me the scared face of a young footman whose eyes were red with\ntears.\n\n\"Are you Doctor----?\" he asked of my silence.\n\n\"I want----\" I said. \"I must speak to Lady Mary.\"\n\nHe was wordless for a moment. \"She--she died, sir,\" he said. \"She's died\nsuddenly.\" His face quivered, he was blubbering. He couldn't say\nanything more; he stood snivelling in the doorway.\n\nFor some moments I remained confronting him as if I would dispute his\nwords. Some things the mind contests in the face of invincible\nconviction. One wants to thrust back time....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE TWELFTH\n\nTHE ARRAIGNMENT OF JEALOUSY\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 1\n\nI sit here in this graciously proportioned little room which I shall\nleave for ever next week, for already your mother begins to pack for\nEngland again. I look out upon the neat French garden that I have\nwatched the summer round, and before me is the pile of manuscript that\nhas grown here, the story of my friendship and love for Mary and of its\ntragic end, and of all the changes of my beliefs and purposes that have\narisen out of that. I had meant it to be the story of my life, but how\nlittle of my life is in it! It gives, at most, certain acute points,\ncertain salient aspects. I begin to realize for the first time how thin\nand suggestive and sketchy a thing any novel or biography must be. How\nwe must simplify! How little can we convey the fullness of life, the\nglittering interests, the interweaving secondary aspects, the dawns and\ndreams and double refractions of experience! Even Mary, of whom I have\nlabored to tell you, seems not so much expressed as hidden beneath these\ncorrected sheets. She who was so abundantly living, who could love like\na burst of sunshine and give herself as God gives the world, is she here\nat all in this pile of industrious inexpert writing?\n\nLife is so much fuller than any book can be. All this story can be\nread, I suppose, in a couple of hours or so, but I have been living and\nreflecting upon and reconsidering the substance of it for over forty\nyears. I do not see how this book can give you any impression but that\nof a career all strained upon the frame of one tragic relationship, yet\nno life unless it is a very short young life can have that simplicity.\nOf all the many things I have found beautiful and wonderful, Mary was\nthe most wonderful to me, she is in my existence like a sunlit lake seen\namong mountains, of all the edges by which life has wrought me she was\nthe keenest. Nevertheless she was not all my life, nor the form of all\nmy life. For a time after her death I could endure nothing of my home, I\ncould not bear the presence of your mother or you, I hated the\npossibility of consolation, I went away into Italy, and it was only by\nan enormous effort that I could resume my interest in that scheme of\nwork to which my life is given. But it is manifest I still live, I live\nand work and feel and share beauty....\n\nIt seems to me more and more as I live longer, that most poetry and most\nliterature and particularly the literature of the past is discordant\nwith the vastness and variety, the reserves and resources and\nrecuperations of life as we live it to-day. It is the expression of life\nunder cruder and more rigid conditions than ours, lived by people who\nloved and hated more na\u00c3\u00afvely, aged sooner and died younger than we do.\nSolitary persons and single events dominated them as they do not\ndominate us. We range wider, last longer, and escape more and more from\nintensity towards understanding. And already this astounding blow begins\nto take its place among other events, as a thing strange and terrible\nindeed, but related to all the strangeness and mystery of life, part of\nthe universal mysteries of despair and futility and death that have\ntroubled my consciousness since childhood. For a time the death of Mary\nobscured her life for me, but now her living presence is more in my mind\nagain. I begin to see that it is the reality of her existence and not\nthe accidents of her end that matter most. It signifies less that she\nshould have flung out of life when it seemed that her living could only\nhave meant disaster to herself and to all she loved, than that all her\nlife should have been hampered and restricted. Through all her life this\nbrave and fine and beautiful being was for the most part of her\npossibilities, wasted in a splendid setting, magnificently wasted if you\nwill, but wasted.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 2\n\nIt was that idea of waste that dominated my mind in a strange interview\nI had with Justin. For it became necessary for me to see Justin in order\nthat we should stamp out the whispers against her that followed her\ndeath. He had made it seem an accidental death due to an overdose of the\nnarcotic she employed, but he had not been able to obliterate altogether\nthe beginnings of his divorce proceedings. There had been talk on the\npart of clerks and possible witnesses. But of all that I need not tell\nyou here; what matters is that Justin and I could meet without hatred or\nviolence. I met a Justin grey-haired and it seemed to me physically\nshrunken, more than ever slow-speaking, with his habit of attentive\nsilences more marked and that dark scar spread beyond his brows.\n\nWe had come to our parting, we had done our business with an\naffectation of emotional aloofness, and then suddenly he gripped me by\nthe arm. \"Stratton,\" he said, \"we two---- We killed her. We tore her to\npieces between us....\"\n\nI made no answer to this outbreak.\n\n\"We tore her to pieces,\" he repeated. \"It's so damned silly. One gets\nangry--like an animal.\"\n\nI became grotesquely anxious to assure him that, indeed, she and I had\nbeen, as they say, innocent throughout our last day together. \"You were\nwrong in all that,\" I said. \"She kept her faith with you. We never\nplanned to meet and when we met----. If we had been brother and\nsister----. Indeed there was nothing.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" he said, \"I ought to be glad of that. But now it doesn't\nseem to matter very much. We killed her.... What does that matter to me\nnow?\"\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 3\n\nAnd it is upon this effect of sweet and beautiful possibilities, caught\nin the net of animal jealousies and thoughtless motives and ancient\nrigid institutions, that I would end this writing. In Mary, it seems to\nme, I found both womanhood and fellowship, I found what many have dreamt\nof, love and friendship freely given, and I could do nothing but clutch\nat her to make her my possession. I would not permit her to live except\nas a part of my life. I see her now and understand her better than when\nshe was alive, I recall things that she said and wrote and it is clear\nto me, clearer perhaps than it ever was to her, that she, with her\nresentment at being in any sense property, her self-reliant thought, her\nindependence of standard, was the very prototype of that sister-lover\nwho must replace the seductive and abject womanhood, owned, mastered and\ndeceiving, who waste the world to-day. And she was owned, she was\nmastered, she was forced into concealment. What alternative was there\nfor her? What alternative is there for any woman? She might perhaps have\nkept her freedom by some ill-paid work and at the price of every other\nimpulse in her swift and eager nature. She might have become one of\nthose poor neuters, an independent woman.... Life was made impossible\nfor her and she was forced to die, according to the fate of all untimely\nthings. She was destroyed, not merely by the unconsidered, undisciplined\npassions of her husband and her lover, but by the vast tradition that\nsustains and enforces the subjugation of her sex. What I had from her,\nand what she was, is but a mere intimation of all that she and I might\nhave made of each other and the world.\n\nAnd perhaps in this story I have said enough for you to understand why\nMary has identified herself with something world-wide, has added to\nherself a symbolical value, and why it is I find in the whole crowded\nspectacle of mankind, a quality that is also hers, a sense of fine\nthings entangled and stifled and unable to free themselves from the\nancient limiting jealousies which law and custom embody. For I know that\na growing multitude of men and women outwear the ancient ways. The\nblood-stained organized jealousies of religious intolerance, the\ndelusions of nationality and cult and race, that black hatred which\nsimple people and young people and common people cherish against all\nthat is not in the likeness of themselves, cease to be the undisputed\nruling forces of our collective life. We want to emancipate our lives\nfrom this slavery and these stupidities, from dull hatreds and\nsuspicion. The ripening mind of our race tires of these boorish and\nbrutish and childish things. A spirit that is like hers, arises and\nincreases in human affairs, a spirit that demands freedom and gracious\nliving as our inheritance too long deferred, and I who loved her so\nblindly and narrowly now love her spirit with a dawning understanding.\n\nI will not be content with that compromise of jealousies which is the\nestablished life of humanity to-day. I give myself, and if I can I will\ngive you, to the destruction of jealousy and of the forms and shelters\nand instruments of jealousy, both in my own self and in the thought and\nlaws and usage of the world.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPopular Copyright Novels\n\nAT MODERATE PRICES\n\nAsk your dealer for a complete list of A.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1416,"split":"test"}
