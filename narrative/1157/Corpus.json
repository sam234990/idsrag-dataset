{"ori_id":"21b5f862d86b23b2ed446dcbfbfb572ba70471d0","title":"War and the Future","context":"War and the Future\n War and the Future is divided into four parts.\nIn the first part, entitled \"The Passing of the Effigy\", Wells argues that \"the great man of this war is the common man\", and sketches a portrait of General Joffre as \"a single figure to stand for the finest quality of the Allies' war\", on account of his \"leadership without vulgar ambition...He is as it were the ordinary commonsense of men, incarnate.\" In an account of a visit with the King of Italy, \"the first king I had ever met\", Wells is struck by the monarch's lack of pomp and, indeed, regality.\nThe second part, titled \"The War in Italy\" (August 1916), describes the city of Udine and the mountain warfare of the Isonzo front as well as visits to Verona, Venice, and Milan.\nThe third part, \"The Western War\" (September 1916), describes visits to the Western Front near Arras and Soissons in France. Wells expresses confidence that methods of aerial dominance, combined with photography, have permitted the Allies to develop tactics that are sure ultimately to defeat Germany. Wells praises British soldiers but criticises the officer corps for its mental rigidity. He emphasises that new technologies have transformed the art of war in ways that military professionals are all too slow to grasp. In particular, fighting in disciplined formations and cavalry are no longer of any military importance, while \"[a]rtillery is now the most essential instrument of the war.\" Wells describes a tour of a munitions factory given by Andr\u0102\u0160 Citro\u0102\u0164n. He devotes a chapter to tanks as \"a beginning in a new phase of warfare\" noting that in 1903 he had described a tank in a short story (\"The Land Ironclads\").\nWar and the Future's final part is entitled \"How People Think about the War\" and addresses a miscellany of subjects: (1) the failure of contemporaries to grasp the nature and causes of the war; (2) the psychology of what he calls \"the Yielding Pacifist\" (willing to accept any sort of peace), whose origins he finds in \"the Resentful Employ\u0102\u0160,\" and of \"the Conscientious Objector,\" pages he later deeply regretted; (3) the effect of the war on religious thought; (4) French and Italian doubts about the British; (5) the effect of the war on future labour relations; (6) the prospects for ending the war. On the last subject, Wells saw a possibility of victory in 1917, but allowed that \"the war, universally detested, may go on into 1918 or 1919.\" Wells said that \"America should ultimately undertake the responsibility of a world peace settlement.\"\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of War and the Future, by H.

The Ending of the War\n\n\n\n\nTHE PASSING OF THE EFFIGY\n\n\n1\n\nOne of the minor peculiarities of this unprecedented war is the Tour of\nthe Front. After some months of suppressed information--in which even\nthe war correspondent was discouraged to the point of elimination--it\nwas discovered on both sides that this was a struggle in which Opinion\nwas playing a larger and more important part than it had ever done\nbefore. This wild spreading weed was perhaps of decisive importance;\nthe Germans at any rate were attempting to make it a cultivated flower.\nThere was Opinion flowering away at home, feeding rankly on rumour;\nOpinion in neutral countries; Opinion getting into great tangles\nof misunderstanding and incorrect valuation between the Allies. The\nconfidence and courage of the enemy; the amiability and assistance of\nthe neutral; the zeal, sacrifice, and serenity of the home population;\nall were affected. The German cultivation of opinion began long\nbefore the war; it is still the most systematic and, because of the\npsychological ineptitude of the Germans, it is probably the clumsiest.\nThe French _Maison de la Presse_ is certainly the best organisation in\nexistence for making things clear, counteracting hostile suggestion, the\nBritish official organisations are comparatively ineffective; but what\nis lacking officially is very largely made up for by the good will\nand generous efforts of the English and American press. An interesting\nmonograph might be written upon these various attempts of the\nbelligerents to get themselves and their proceedings explained.\n\nBecause there is perceptible in these developments, quite over and\nabove the desire to influence opinion, a very real effort to get things\nexplained. It is the most interesting and curious--one might almost\nwrite touching--feature of these organisations that they do not\nconstitute a positive and defined propaganda such as the Germans\nmaintain. The German propaganda is simple, because its ends are simple;\nassertions of the moral elevation and loveliness of Germany; of the\ninsuperable excellences of German Kultur, the Kaiser, and Crown Prince,\nand so forth; abuse of the \"treacherous\" English who allied themselves\nwith the \"degenerate\" French and the \"barbaric\" Russians; nonsense about\n\"the freedom of the seas\"--the emptiest phrase in history--childish\nattempts to sow suspicion between the Allies, and still more childish\nattempts to induce neutrals and simple-minded pacifists of allied\nnationality to save the face of Germany by initiating peace\nnegotiations. But apart from their steady record and reminder of German\nbrutalities and German aggression, the press organisations of the Allies\nhave none of this definiteness in their task. The aim of the national\nintelligence in each of the allied countries is not to exalt one's own\nnation and confuse and divide the enemy, but to get a real understanding\nwith the peoples and spirits of a number of different nations, an\nunderstanding that will increase and become a fruitful and permanent\nunderstanding between the allied peoples. Neither the English, the\nRussians, the Italians, nor the French, to name only the bigger European\nallies, are concerned in setting up a legend, as the Germans are\nconcerned in setting up a legend of themselves to impose upon mankind.\nThey are reality dealers in this war, and the Germans are effigy\nmongers. Practically the Allies are saying each to one another, \"Pray\ncome to me and see for yourself that I am very much the human stuff that\nyou are. Come and see that I am doing my best--and I think that is\nnot so very bad a best....\" And with that is something else still more\nsubtle, something rather in the form of, \"And please tell me what you\nthink of me--and all this.\"\n\nSo we have this curious byplay of the war, and one day I find Mr.\nNabokoff, the editor of the _Retch_, and Count Alexy Tolstoy, that\nwriter of delicate short stories, and Mr. Chukovsky, the subtle critic,\ncalling in upon me after braving the wintry seas to see the British\nfleet; M. Joseph Reinach follows them presently upon the same errand;\nand then appear photographs of Mr. Arnold Bennett wading in the trenches\nof Flanders, Mr. Noyes becomes discreetly indiscreet about what he has\nseen among the submarines, and Mr. Hugh Walpole catches things from Mr.\nStephen Graham in the Dark Forest of Russia. All this is quite over and\nabove such writing of facts at first hand as Mr. Patrick McGill and a\ndozen other real experiencing soldiers--not to mention the soldiers'\nletters Mr. James Milne has collected, or the unforgettable and\nimmortal _Prisoner of War_ of Mr. Arthur Green--or such admirable war\ncorrespondents' work as Mr. Philip Gibbs or Mr. Washburne has done. Some\nof us writers--I can answer for one--have made our Tour of the Fronts\nwith a very understandable diffidence. For my own part I did not want\nto go. I evaded a suggestion that I should go in 1915. I travel badly,\nI speak French and Italian with incredible atrocity, and am an extreme\nPacifist. I hate soldiering. And also I did not want to write anything\n\"under instruction\". It is largely owing to a certain stiffness in the\ncomposition of General Delme-Radcliffe is resolved that Italy shall not\nfeel neglected by the refusal of the invitation from the Comando\nSupremo by anyone who from the perspective of Italy may seem to be a\nrepresentative of British opinion. If Herbert Spencer had been\nalive General Radcliffe would have certainly made him come,\ntravelling-hammock, ear clips and all--and I am not above confessing\nthat I wish that Herbert Spencer was alive--for this purpose. I found\nUdine warm and gay with memories of Mr. Belloc, Lord Northcliffe, Mr.\nSidney Low, Colonel Repington and Dr. Conan Doyle, and anticipating the\narrival of Mr. Harold Cox. So we pass, mostly in automobiles that bump\ntremendously over war roads, a cloud of witnesses each testifying after\nhis manner. Whatever else has happened, we have all been photographed\nwith invincible patience and resolution under the direction of Colonel\nBarberich in a sunny little court in Udine.\n\nMy own manner of testifying must be to tell what I have seen and what\nI have thought during this extraordinary experience. It has been my\nnatural disposition to see this war as something purposeful and epic,\nas it is great, as an epoch, as \"the War that will end War\"--but of\nthat last, more anon. I do not think I am alone in this inclination to a\ndramatic and logical interpretation. The caricatures in the French shops\nshow civilisation (and particularly Marianne) in conflict with a huge\nand hugely wicked Hindenburg Ogre. Well, I come back from this tour with\nsomething not so simple as that. If I were to be tied down to one word\nfor my impression of this war, I should say that this war is _Queer._ It\nis not like anything in a really waking world, but like something in a\ndream. It hasn't exactly that clearness of light against darkness or\nof good against ill. But it has the quality of wholesome instinct\nstruggling under a nightmare. The world is not really awake. This vague\nappeal for explanations to all sorts of people, this desire to exhibit\nthe business, to get something in the way of elucidation at present\nmissing, is extraordinarily suggestive of the efforts of the mind to\nwake up that will sometimes occur at a deep crisis. My memory of this\ntour I have just made is full of puzzled-looking men. I have seen\nthousands of _poilus_ sitting about in cafes, by the roadside, in\ntents, in trenches, thoughtful. I have seen Alpini sitting restfully and\nstaring with speculative eyes across the mountain gulfs towards unseen\nand unaccountable enemies. I have seen trainloads of wounded staring\nout of the ambulance train windows as we passed. I have seen these dim\nintimations of questioning reflection in the strangest juxtapositions;\nin Malagasy soldiers resting for a spell among the big shells they were\nhoisting into trucks for the front, in a couple of khaki-clad Maoris\nsitting upon the step of a horse-van in Amiens station. It is always the\nsame expression one catches, rather weary, rather sullen, inturned. The\nshoulders droop. The very outline is a note of interrogation. They look\nup as the privileged tourist of the front, in the big automobile or\nthe reserved compartment, with his officer or so in charge,\npasses--importantly. One meets a pair of eyes that seems to say:\n\"Perhaps _you_ understand....\n\n\"In which case---...?\"\n\nIt is a part, I think, of this disposition to investigate what makes\neveryone collect \"specimens\" of the war. Everywhere the souvenir forces\nitself upon the attention. The homecoming permissionaire brings with\nhim invariably a considerable weight of broken objects, bits of shell,\ncartridge clips, helmets; it is a peripatetic museum. It is as if he\nhoped for a clue. It is almost impossible, I have found, to escape these\npieces in evidence. I am the least collecting of men, but I have brought\nhome Italian cartridges, Austrian cartridges, the fuse of an Austrian\nshell, a broken Italian bayonet, and a note that is worth half a franc\nwithin the confines of Amiens. But a large heavy piece of exploded shell\nthat had been thrust very urgently upon my attention upon the Carso I\ncontrived to lose during the temporary confusion of our party by the\narrival and explosion of another prospective souvenir in our close\nproximity. And two really very large and almost complete specimens of\nsome species of _Ammonites_ unknown to me, from the hills to the east\nof the Adige, partially wrapped in a back number of the _Corriere\ndella Sera_, that were pressed upon me by a friendly officer, were\nunfortunately lost on the line between Verona and Milan through the\ngross negligence of a railway porter. But I doubt if they would have\nthrown any very conclusive light upon the war.\n\n\n2\n\nI avow myself an extreme Pacifist. I am against the man who first takes\nup the weapon. I carry my pacifism far beyond the ambiguous little group\nof British and foreign sentimentalists who pretend so amusingly to be\nsocialists in the _Labour Leader_, whose conception of foreign policy is\nto give Germany now a peace that would be no more than a breathing time\nfor a fresh outrage upon civilisation, and who would even make heroes of\nthe crazy young assassins of the Dublin crime. I do not understand those\npeople. I do not merely want to stop this war. I want to nail down war\nin its coffin. Modern war is an intolerable thing. It is not a thing\nto trifle with in this Urban District Council way, it is a thing to\nend forever. I have always hated it, so far that is as my imagination\nenabled me to realise it; and now that I have been seeing it, sometimes\nquite closely for a full month, I hate it more than ever. I never\nimagined a quarter of its waste, its boredom, its futility, its\ndesolation. It is merely a destructive and dispersive instead of a\nconstructive and accumulative industrialism. It is a gigantic, dusty,\nmuddy, weedy, bloodstained silliness. It is the plain duty of every man\nto give his life and all that he has if by so doing he may help to end\nit. I hate Germany, which has thrust this experience upon mankind, as\nI hate some horrible infectious disease. The new war, the war on the\nmodern level, is her invention and her crime. I perceive that on our\nside and in its broad outlines, this war is nothing more than a gigantic\nand heroic effort in sanitary engineering; an effort to remove German\nmilitarism from the life and regions it has invaded, and to bank it\nin and discredit and enfeeble it so that never more will it repeat its\npresent preposterous and horrible efforts. All human affairs and all\ngreat affairs have their reservations and their complications, but that\nis the broad outline of the business as it has impressed itself on my\nmind and as I find it conceived in the mind of the average man of the\nreading class among the allied peoples, and as I find it understood in\nthe judgement of honest and intelligent neutral observers.\n\nIt is my unshakeable belief that essentially the Allies fight for a\npermanent world peace, that primarily they do not make war but resist\nwar, that has reconciled me to this not very congenial experience of\ntouring as a spectator all agog to see, through the war zones. At any\nrate there was never any risk of my playing Balaam and blessing the\nenemy. This war is tragedy and sacrifice for most of the world, for\nthe Germans it is simply the catastrophic outcome of fifty years of\nelaborate intellectual foolery. Militarism, Welt Politik, and here we\nare! What else _could_ have happened, with Michael and his infernal War\nMachine in the very centre of Europe, but this tremendous disaster?\n\nIt is a disaster. It may be a necessary disaster; it may teach a lesson\nthat could be learnt in no other way; but for all that, I insist, it\nremains waste, disorder, disaster.\n\nThere is a disposition, I know, in myself as well as in others, to\nwriggle away from this verity, to find so much good in the collapse that\nhas come to the mad direction of Europe for the past half-century as to\nmake it on the whole almost a beneficial thing. But at most I can find\nit in no greater good than the good of a nightmare that awakens the\nsleeper in a dangerous place to a realisation of the extreme danger of\nhis sleep. Better had he been awake--or never there. In Venetia Captain\nPirelli, whose task it was to keep me out of mischief in the war zone,\nwas insistent upon the way in which all Venetia was being opened up\nby the new military roads; there has been scarcely a new road made in\nVenetia since Napoleon drove his straight, poplar-bordered highways\nthrough the land. M. Joseph Reinach, who was my companion upon the\nFrench front, was equally impressed by the stirring up and exchange of\nideas in the villages due to the movement of the war. Charles Lamb's\nstory of the discovery of roast pork comes into one's head with an\neffect of repartee. More than ideas are exchanged in the war zone,\nand it is doubtful how far the sanitary precautions of the military\nauthorities avails against a considerable propaganda of disease. A more\nserious argument for the good of war is that it evokes heroic qualities\nthat it has brought out almost incredible quantities of courage,\ndevotion, and individual romance that did not show in the suffocating\npeace time that preceded the war. The reckless and beautiful zeal of\nthe women in the British and French munition factories, for example, the\ngaiety and fearlessness of the common soldiers everywhere; these things\nhave always been there--like champagne sleeping in bottles in a cellar.\nBut was there any need to throw a bomb into the cellar?\n\nI am reminded of a story, or rather of the idea for a story that I\nthink I must have read in that curious collection of fantasies and\nobservations, Hawthorne's _Note Book._ It was to be the story of a man\nwho found life dull and his circumstances altogether mediocre. He had\nloved his wife, but now after all she seemed to be a very ordinary human\nbeing. He had begun life with high hopes--and life was commonplace. He\nwas to grow fretful and restless. His discontent was to lead to some\naction, some irrevocable action; but upon the nature of that action I do\nnot think the _Note Book_ was very clear. It was to carry him in such\na manner that he was to forget his wife. Then, when it was too late,\nhe was to see her at an upper window, stripped and firelit, a glorious\nthing of light and loveliness and tragic intensity....\n\nThe elementary tales of the world are very few, and Hawthorne's story\nand Lamb's story are, after all, only variations upon the same\ntheme. But can we poor human beings never realise our quality without\ndestruction?\n\n\n3\n\nOne of the larger singularities of the great war is its failure to\nproduce great and imposing personalities, mighty leaders, Napoleons,\nCaesars. I would indeed make that the essential thing in my reckoning\nof the war. It is a drama without a hero; without countless incidental\nheroes no doubt, but no star part. Even the Germans, with a national\npredisposition for hero-cults and living still in an atmosphere of\nVictorian humbug, can produce nothing better than that timber image,\nHindenburg.\n\nIt is not that the war has failed to produce heroes so much as that\nit has produced heroism in a torrent. The great man of this war is the\ncommon man. It becomes ridiculous to pick out particular names. There\nare too many true stories of splendid acts in the past two years ever to\nbe properly set down. The V.C.'s and the palms do but indicate samples.\nOne would need an encyclopaedia, a row of volumes, of the gloriousness\nof human impulses. The acts of the small men in this war dwarf all the\npretensions of the Great Man. Imperatively these multitudinous heroes\nforbid the setting up of effigies. When I was a young man I imitated\nSwift and posed for cynicism; I will confess that now at fifty and\ngreatly helped by this war, I have fallen in love with mankind.\n\nBut if I had to pick out a single figure to stand for the finest quality\nof the Allies' war, I should I think choose the figure of General\nJoffre. He is something new in history. He is leadership without vulgar\nambition. He is the extreme antithesis to the Imperial boomster of\nBerlin. He is as it were the ordinary common sense of men, incarnate. He\nis the antithesis of the effigy.\n\nBy great good luck I was able to see him. I was delayed in Paris on my\nway to Italy, and my friend Captain Millet arranged for a visit to the\nFrench front at Soissons and put me in charge of Lieutenant de Tessin,\nwhom I had met in England studying British social questions long before\nthis war. Afterwards Lieutenant de Tessin took me to the great hotel--it\nstill proclaims \"_Restaurant_\" in big black letters on the garden\nwall--which shelters the General Headquarters of France, and here I\nwas able to see and talk to Generals Pelle and Castelnau as well as to\nGeneral Joffre. They are three very remarkable and very different men.\nThey have at least one thing in common; it is clear that not one of\nthem has spent ten minutes in all his life in thinking of himself as\na Personage or Great Man. They all have the effect of being active and\nable men doing an extremely complicated and difficult but extremely\ninteresting job to the very best of their ability. With me they had all\none quality in common. They thought I was interested in what they were\ndoing, and they were quite prepared to treat me as an intelligent man of\na different sort, and to show me as much as I could understand....\n\nLet me confess that de Tessin had had to persuade me to go to\nHeadquarters. Partly that was because I didn't want to use up even\nten minutes of the time of the French commanders, but much more was it\nbecause I have a dread of Personages.\n\nThere is something about these encounters with personages--as if one was\ndealing with an effigy, with something tremendous put up to be seen.\nAs one approaches they become remoter; great unsuspected crevasses are\ndiscovered. Across these gulfs one makes ineffective gestures. They do\nnot meet you, they pose at you enormously. Sometimes there is something\nmore terrible than dignity; there is condescension. They are affable. I\nhad but recently had an encounter with an imported Colonial statesman,\nwho was being advertised like a soap as the coming saviour of England.\nI was curious to meet him. I wanted to talk to him about all sorts of\nthings that would have been profoundly interesting, as for example his\nimpressions of the Anglican bishops. But I met a hoarding. I met a thing\nlike a mask, something surrounded by touts, that was dully trying--as we\nsay in London--to \"come it\" over me. He said he had heard of me. He\nhad read _Kipps._ I intimated that though I had written _Kipps_ I had\ncontinued to exist--but he did not see the point of that. I said certain\nthings to him about the difference in complexity between political\nlife in Great Britain and the colonies, that he was manifestly totally\ncapable of understanding. But one could as soon have talked with one of\nthe statesmen at Madame Tussaud's. An antiquated figure.\n\nThe effect of these French commanders upon me was quite different from\nmy encounter with that last belated adventurer in the effigy line. I\nfelt indeed that I was a rather idle and flimsy person coming into the\npresence of a tremendously compact and busy person, but I had none of\nthat unpleasant sensation of a conventional role, of being expected to\nplay the minute worshipper in the presence of the Great Image. I was so\nmoved by the common humanity of them all that in each case I broke\naway from the discreet interpretations of de Tessin and talked to them\ndirectly in the strange dialect which I have inadvertently made for\nmyself out of French, a disemvowelled speech of epicene substantives and\nverbs of incalculable moods and temperaments, \"_Entente Cordiale._\" The\ntalked back as if we had met in a club. General Pelle pulled my leg\nvery gaily with some quotations from an article I had written upon the\nconclusion of the war. I think he found my accent and my idioms very\nrefreshing. I had committed myself to a statement that Bloch has been\njustified in his theory that under modern conditions the defensive wins.\nThere were excellent reasons, and General Pelle pointed them out, for\ndoubting the applicability of this to the present war.\n\nBoth he and General Castelnau were anxious that I should see a French\noffensive sector as well as Soissons. Then I should understand.\nAnd since then I have returned from Italy and I have seen and I do\nunderstand. The Allied offensive was winning; that is to say, it was\ninflicting far greater losses than it experienced; it was steadily\nbeating the spirit out of the German army and shoving it back towards\nGermany. Only peace can, I believe, prevent the western war ending in\nGermany. And it is the Frenchmen mainly who have worked out how to do\nit.\n\nBut of that I will write later. My present concern is with General\nJoffre as the antithesis of the Effigy. The effigy,\n\n     \"Thou Prince of Peace,\n     Thou God of War,\"\n\nas Mr. Sylvester Viereck called him, prances on a great horse, wears a\nWagnerian cloak, sits on thrones and talks of shining armour and \"unser\nGott.\" All Germany gloats over his Jovian domesticities; when I was\nlast in Berlin the postcard shops were full of photographs of a sort\nof procession of himself and his sons, all with long straight noses and\nsidelong eyes. It is all dreadfully old-fashioned. General Joffre\nsits in a pleasant little sitting-room in a very ordinary little villa\nconveniently close to Headquarters. He sits among furniture that has no\nquality of pose at all, that is neither magnificent nor ostentatiously\nsimple and hardy. He has dark, rather sleepy eyes under light eyelashes,\neyes that glance shyly and a little askance at his interlocutor and\nthen, as he talks, away--as if he did not want to be preoccupied by your\nattention. He has a broad, rather broadly modelled face, a soft voice,\nthe sort of persuasive reasoning voice that many Scotchmen have. I had\na feeling that if he were to talk English he would do so with a Scotch\naccent. Perhaps somewhere I have met a Scotchman of his type. He sat\nsideways to his table as a man might sit for a gossip in a cafe.\n\nHe is physically a big man, and in my memory he grows bigger and bigger.\nHe sits now in my memory in a room like the rooms that any decent people\nmight occupy, like that vague room that is the background of so many\ngood portraits, a great blue-coated figure with a soft voice and rather\ntired eyes, explaining very simply and clearly the difficulties that\nthis vulgar imperialism of Germany, seizing upon modern science and\nmodern appliances, has created for France and the spirit of mankind.\n\nHe talked chiefly of the strangeness of this confounded war. It was\nexactly like a sanitary engineer speaking of the unexpected difficulties\nof some particularly nasty inundation. He made little stiff horizontal\ngestures with his hands. First one had to build a dam and stop the rush\nof it, so; then one had to organise the push that would send it back. He\nexplained the organisation of the push. They had got an organisation\nnow that was working out most satisfactorily. Had I seen a sector? I\nhad seen the sector of Soissons. Yes, but that was not now an offensive\nsector. I must see an offensive sector; see the whole method. Lieutenant\nde Tessin must see that that was arranged....\n\nNeither he nor his two colleagues spoke of the Germans with either\nhostility or humanity. Germany for them is manifestly merely an\nobjectionable Thing. It is not a nation, not a people, but a nuisance.\nOne has to build up this great counter-thrust bigger and stronger until\nthey go back. The war must end in Germany. The French generals have\nno such delusions about German science or foresight or capacity as\ndominates the smart dinner chatter of England. One knows so well that\ndetestable type of English folly, and its voice of despair: \"They _plan_\neverything. They foresee everything.\" This paralysing Germanophobia is\nnot common among the French. The war, the French generals said, might\ntake--well, it certainly looked like taking longer than the winter. Next\nsummer perhaps. Probably, if nothing unforeseen occurred, before a full\nyear has passed the job might be done. Were any surprises in store? They\ndidn't seem to think it was probable that the Germans had any surprises\nin store.... The Germans are not an inventive people; they are merely a\nthorough people. One never knew for certain.\n\nIs any greater contrast possible than between so implacable, patient,\nreasonable--and above all things _capable_--a being as General Joffre\nand the rhetorician of Potsdam, with his talk of German Might, of Hammer\nBlows and Hacking Through? Can there be any doubt of the ultimate issue\nbetween them?\n\nThere are stories that sound pleasantly true to me about General\nJoffre's ambitions after the war. He is tired; then he will be very\ntired. He will, he declares, spend his first free summer in making a\ntour of the waterways of France in a barge. So I hope it may be. One\nimagines him as sitting quietly on the crumpled remains of the last\nand tawdriest of Imperial traditions, with a fishing line in the placid\nwater and a large buff umbrella overhead, the good ordinary man who does\nwhatever is given to him to do--as well as he can. The power that has\ntaken the great effigy of German imperialism by the throat is something\nvery composite and complex, but if we personify it at all it is\nsomething more like General Joffre than any other single human figure I\ncan think of or imagine.\n\nIf I were to set a frontispiece to a book about this War I would make\nGeneral Joffre the frontispiece.\n\n\n4\n\nAs we swung back along the dusty road to Paris at a pace of fifty\nmiles an hour and upwards, driven by a helmeted driver with an aquiline\nprofile fit to go upon a coin, whose merits were a little flawed by a\nchildish and dangerous ambition to run over every cat he saw upon the\nroad, I talked to de Tessin about this big blue-coated figure of Joffre,\nwhich is not so much a figure as a great generalisation of certain\nhitherto rather obscured French qualities, and of the impression he had\nmade upon me. And from that I went on to talk about the Super Man, for\nthis encounter had suddenly crystallised out a set of realisations that\nhad been for some time latent in my mind.\n\nHow much of what follows I said to de Tessin at the time I do not\nclearly remember, but this is what I had in mind.\n\nThe idea of the superman is an idea that has been developed by various\npeople ignorant of biology and unaccustomed to biological ways of\nthinking. It is an obvious idea that follows in the course of half an\nhour or so upon one's realisation of the significance of Darwinism. If\nman has evolved from something different, he must now be evolving onward\ninto something sur-human. The species in the future will be different\nfrom the species of the past. So far at least our Nietzsches and Shaws\nand so on went right.\n\nBut being ignorant of the elementary biological proposition that\nmodification of a species means really a secular change in its average,\nthey jumped to a conclusion--to which the late Lord Salisbury also\njumped years ago at a very memorable British Association meeting--that\na species is modified by the sudden appearance of eccentric individuals\nhere and there in the general mass who interbreed--preferentially.\nHelped by a streak of antic egotism in themselves, they conceived of\nthe superman as a posturing personage, misunderstood by the vulgar,\nfantastic, wonderful. But the antic Personage, the thing I have called\nthe Effigy, is not new but old, the oldest thing in history, the\ndeparting thing. It depends not upon the advance of the species but upon\nthe uncritical hero-worship of the crowd. You may see the monster drawn\ntwenty times the size of common men upon the oldest monuments of Egypt\nand Assyria. The true superman comes not as the tremendous personal\nentry of a star, but in the less dramatic form of a general increase of\ngoodwill and skill and common sense. A species rises not by thrusting up\npeaks but by the brimming up as a flood does. The coming of the superman\nmeans not an epidemic of personages but the disappearance of the\nPersonage in the universal ascent. That is the point overlooked by the\nmegalomaniac school of Nietzsche and Shaw.\n\nAnd it is the peculiarity of this war, it is the most reassuring\nevidence that a great increase in general ability and critical ability\nhas been going on throughout the last century, that no isolated\ngreat personages have emerged. Never has there been so much ability,\ninvention, inspiration, leadership; but the very abundance of good\nqualities has prevented our focusing upon those of any one individual.\nWe all play our part in the realisation of God's sanity in the world,\nbut, as the strange, dramatic end of Lord Kitchener has served to remind\nus, there is no single individual of all the allied nations whose death\ncan materially affect the great destinies of this war.\n\nIn the last few years I have developed a religious belief that has\nbecome now to me as real as any commonplace fact. I think that mankind\nis still as it were collectively dreaming and hardly more awakened to\nreality than a very young child. It has these dreams that we express by\nthe flags of nationalities and by strange loyalties and by irrational\ncreeds and ceremonies, and its dreams at times become such nightmares as\nthis war. But the time draws near when mankind will awake and the dreams\nwill fade away, and then there will be no nationality in all the world\nbut humanity, and no kind, no emperor, nor leader but the one God of\nmankind. This is my faith. I am as certain of this as I was in 1900 that\nmen would presently fly. To me it is as if it must be so.\n\nSo that to me this extraordinary refusal of the allied nations under\nconditions that have always hitherto produced a Great Man to produce\nanything of the sort, anything that can be used as an effigy and carried\nabout for the crowd to follow, is a fact of extreme significance and\nencouragement. It seems to me that the twilight of the half gods must\nhave come, that we have reached the end of the age when men needed a\nPersonal Figure about which they could rally. The Kaiser is perhaps\nthe last of that long series of crowned and cloaked and semi-divine\npersonages which has included Caesar and Alexander and Napoleon the\nFirst--and Third. In the light of the new time we see the emperor-god\nfor the guy he is. In the August of 1914 he set himself up to be the\nparamount Lord of the World, and it will seem to the historian to come,\nwho will know our dates so well and our feelings, our fatigues and\nefforts so little, it will seem a short period from that day to this,\nwhen the great figure already sways and staggers towards the bonfire.\n\n\n5\n\nI had the experience of meeting a contemporary king upon this journey.\nHe was the first king I had ever met. The Potsdam figure--with perhaps\nsome local exceptions behind the Gold Coast--is, with its collection of\nuniforms and its pomps and splendours, the purest survival of the old\ntradition of divine monarchy now that the Emperor at Pekin has followed\nthe Shogun into the shadows. The modern type of king shows a disposition\nto intimate at the outset that he cannot help it, and to justify or at\nany rate utilise his exceptional position by sound hard work. It is an\nage of working kings, with the manners of private gentlemen. The King\nof Italy for example is far more accessible than was the late Pierpont\nMorgan or the late Cecil Rhodes, and he seems to keep a smaller court.\n\nI went to see him from Udine. He occupied a moderate-sized country villa\nabout half an hour by automobile from headquarters. I went over with\nGeneral Radcliffe; we drove through the gates of the villa past a single\nsentinel in an ordinary infantry uniform, up to the door of the house,\nand the number of guards, servants, attendants, officials, secretaries,\nministers and the like that I saw in that house were--I counted very\ncarefully--four. Downstairs were three people, a tall soldier of the\nbodyguard in grey; an A.D.C., Captain Moreno, and Col. Matteoli, the\nminister of the household. I went upstairs to a drawing-room of much\nthe same easy and generalised character as the one in which I had met\nGeneral Joffre a few days before. I gave my hat to a second bodyguard,\nand as I did so a pleasantly smiling man appeared at the door of the\nstudy whom I thought at first must be some minister in attendance. I did\nnot recognise him instantly because on the stamps and coins he is always\nin profile. He began to talk in excellent English about my journey,\nand I replied, and so talking we went into the study from which he had\nemerged. Then I realised I was talking to the king.\n\nAddicted as I am to the cinematograph, in which the standard of study\nfurniture is particularly rich and high, I found something very cooling\nand simple and refreshing in the sight of the king's study furniture. He\nsat down with me at a little useful writing table, and after asking me\nwhat I had seen in Italy and hearing what I had seen and what I was to\nsee, he went on talking, very good talk indeed.\n\nI suppose I did a little exceed the established tradition of courts\nby asking several questions and trying to get him to talk upon certain\npoints as to which I was curious, but I perceived that he had had to\ncarry on at least so much of the regal tradition as to control the\nconversation. He was, however, entirely un-posed. His talk reminded me\nsomehow of Maurice Baring's books; it had just the same quick, positive\nunderstanding. And he had just the same detachment from the war as the\nFrench generals. He spoke of it--as one might speak of an inundation.\nAnd of its difficulties and perplexities.\n\nHere on the Adriatic side there were political entanglements that by\ncomparison made our western after-the-war problems plain sailing. He\ntalked of the game of spellicans among the Balkan nationalities. How was\nthat difficulty to be met? In Macedonia there were Turkish villages that\nwere Christian and Bulgarians that were Moslem. There were families that\nchanged the termination of their names from _ski_ to _off_ as Serbian or\nBulgarian prevailed. I remarked that that showed a certain passion for\npeace, and that much of the mischief might be due to the propaganda\nof the great Powers. I have a prejudice against that blessed Whig\n\"principle of nationality,\" but the King of Italy was not to be drawn\ninto any statement about that. He left the question with his admission\nof its extreme complexity.\n\nHe went on to talk of the strange contrasts of war, of such things as\nthe indifference of the birds to gunfire and desolation. One day on\nthe Carso he had been near the newly captured Austrian trenches, and\nsuddenly from amidst a scattered mass of Austrian bodies a quail had\nrisen that had struck him as odd, and so too had the sight of a pack of\ncards and a wine flask on some newly-made graves. The ordinary life was\na very _obstinate_ thing....\n\nHe talked of the courage of modern men. He was astonished at the\nquickness with which they came to disregard shrapnel. And they were\nso quietly enduring when they were wounded. He had seen a lot of the\nwounded, and he had expected much groaning and crying out. But unless\na man is hit in the head and goes mad he does not groan or scream! They\nare just brave. If you ask them how they feel it is always one of two\nthings: either they say quietly that they are very bad or else they say\nthere is nothing the matter....\n\nHe spoke as if these were mere chance observations, but everyone tells\nme that nearly every day the king is at the front and often under fire.\nHe has taken more risks in a week than the Potsdam War Lord has taken\nsince the war began. He keeps himself acutely informed upon every aspect\nof the war. He was a little inclined to fatalism, he confessed. There\nwere two stories current of two families of four sons, in each three\nhad been killed and in each there was an attempt to put the fourth in a\nplace of comparative safety. In one case a general took the fourth\nson in as an attendant and embarked upon a ship that was immediately\ntorpedoed; in the other the fourth son was killed by accident while he\nwas helping to carry dinner in a rest camp. From those stories we came\nto the question whether the uneducated Italians were more superstitious\nthan the uneducated English; the king thought they were much less so.\nThat struck me as a novel idea. But then he thought that English rural\npeople believe in witches and fairies.\n\nI have given enough of this talk to show the quality of this king of the\nnew dispensation. It was, you see, the sort of easy talk one might hear\nfrom fine-minded people anywhere. When we had done talking he came\nto the door of the study with me and shook hands and went back to his\ndesk--with that gesture of return to work which is very familiar and\nsympathetic to a writer, and with no gesture of regality at all.\n\nJust to complete this impression let me repeat a pleasant story about\nthis king and our Prince of Wales, who recently visited the Italian\nfront. The Prince is a source of anxiety on these visits; he has a very\nstrong and very creditable desire to share the ordinary risks of war.\nHe is keenly interested, and unobtrusively bent upon getting as near\nthe fighting as line as possible. But the King of Italy was firm upon\nkeeping him out of anything more than the most incidental danger. \"We\ndon't want any historical incidents here,\" he said. I think that might\nwell become an historical phrase. For the life of the Effigy is a series\nof historical incidents.\n\n\n6\n\nManifestly one might continue to multiply portraits of fine people\nworking upon this great task of breaking and ending the German\naggression, the German legend, the German effigy, and the effigy\nbusiness generally; the thesis being that the Allies have no effigy.\nOne might fill a thick volume with pictures of men up the scale and down\nworking loyally and devotedly upon the war, to make this point clear\nthat the essential king and the essential loyalty of our side is the\ncommonsense of mankind.\n\nThere comes into my head as a picture at the other extreme of this\nseries, a memory of certain trenches I visited on my last day in\nFrance. They were trenches on an offensive front; they were not those\narchitectural triumphs, those homes from home, that grow to perfection\nupon the less active sections of the great line. They had been first\nmade by men who had run rapidly forward with spade and rifle, stooping\nas they ran, who had dropped into the craters of big shells, who had\norganised these chiefly at night and dug the steep ditches sideways to\njoin up into continuous trenches. Now they were pushing forward saps\ninto No Man's Land, linking them across, and so continually creeping\nnearer to the enemy and a practicable jumping-off place for an attack.\n(It has been made since; the village at which I peeped was in our hands\na week later.) These trenches were dug into a sort of yellowish sandy\nclay; the dug-outs were mere holes in the earth that fell in upon the\nclumsy; hardly any timber had been got up the line; a storm might flood\nthem at any time a couple of feet deep and begin to wash the sides.\nOvernight they had been \"strafed\" and there had been a number of\ncasualties; there were smashed rifles about and a smashed-up machine gun\nemplacement, and the men were dog-tired and many of them sleeping like\nlogs, half buried in clay. Some slept on the firing steps. As one\nwent along one became aware ever and again of two or three pairs of\nclay-yellow feet sticking out of a clay hole, and peering down one\nsaw the shapes of men like rudely modelled earthen images of soldiers,\nmotionless in the cave.\n\nI came round the corner upon a youngster with an intelligent face and\nsteady eyes sitting up on the firing step, awake and thinking. We looked\nat one another. There are moments when mind leaps to mind. It is natural\nfor the man in the trenches suddenly confronted by so rare a beast as\na middle-aged civilian with an enquiring expression, to feel oneself\nsomething of a spectacle and something generalised. It is natural for\nthe civilian to look rather in the vein of saying, \"Well, how do you\ntake it?\" As I pushed past him we nodded slightly with an effect of\nmutual understanding. And we said with our nods just exactly what\nGeneral Joffre had said with his horizontal gestures of the hand and\nwhat the King of Italy conveyed by his friendly manner; we said to each\nother that here was the trouble those Germans had brought upon us and\nhere was the task that had to be done.\n\nOur guide to these trenches was a short, stocky young man, a cob; with\na rifle and a tight belt and projecting skirts and a helmet, a queer\nlittle figure that, had you seen it in a picture a year or so before the\nwar, you would most certainly have pronounced Chinese. He belonged to a\nNorthumbrian battalion; it does not matter exactly which. As we returned\nfrom this front line, trudging along the winding path through the barbed\nwire tangles before the smashed and captured German trench that had been\ntaken a fortnight before, I fell behind my guardian captain and had\na brief conversation wit this individual. He was a lad in the early\ntwenties, weather-bit and with bloodshot eyes. He was, he told me, a\nminer. I asked my stock question in such cases, whether he would go back\nto the old work after the war. He said he would, and then added--with\nthe events of overnight on his mind: \"If A'hm looky.\"\n\nFollowed a little silence. Then I tried my second stock remark for such\ncases. One does not talk to soldiers at the front in this war of Glory\nor the \"Empire on which the sun never sets\" or \"the meteor flag of\nEngland\" or of King and Country or any of those fine old headline\nthings. On the desolate path that winds about amidst the shell craters\nand the fragments and the red-rusted wire, with the silken shiver of\npassing shells in the air and the blue of the lower sky continually\nbreaking out into eddying white puffs, it is wonderful how tawdry such\npanoplies of the effigy appear. We knew that we and our allies are upon\na greater, graver, more fundamental business than that sort of thing\nnow. We are very near the waking point.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"it's got to be done.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" he said, easing the strap of his rifle a little; \"it's got to be\ndone.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE WAR IN ITALY (AUGUST, 1916)\n\n\n\n\nI. THE ISONZO FRONT\n\n\n1\n\nMy first impressions of the Italian war centre upon Udine. So far I had\nhad only a visit to Soissons on an exceptionally quiet day and the\nsound of a Zeppelin one night in Essex for all my experience of actual\nwarfare. But my bedroom at the British mission in Udine roused perhaps\nextravagant expectations. There were holes in the plaster ceiling and\nwall, betraying splintered laths, holes, that had been caused by a bomb\nthat had burst and killed several people in the little square outside.\nSuch excitements seem to be things of the past now in Udine. Udine keeps\nitself dark nowadays, and the Austrian sea-planes, which come raiding\nthe Italian coast country at night very much in the same aimless,\ncasually malignant way in which the Zeppelins raid England, apparently\nbecause there is nothing else for them to do, find it easier to locate\nVenice.\n\nMy earlier rides in Venetia began always with the level roads of the\nplain, roads frequently edged by watercourses, with plentiful willows\nbeside the road, vines and fields of Indian corn and suchlike lush\ncrops. Always quite soon one came to some old Austrian boundary posts;\nalmost everywhere the Italians are fighting upon what is technically\nenemy territory, but nowhere does it seem a whit less Italian than\nthe plain of Lombardy. When at last I motored away from Udine to the\nnorthern mountain front I passed through Campo-Formio and saw the\nwhite-faced inn at which Napoleon dismembered the ancient republic\nof Venice and bartered away this essential part of Italy into foreign\ncontrol. It just gravitates back now--as though there had been no\nNapoleon.\n\nAnd upon the roads and beside them was the enormous equipment of a\nmodern army advancing. Everywhere I saw new roads being made, railways\npushed up, vast store dumps, hospitals; everywhere the villages swarmed\nwith grey soldiers; everywhere our automobile was threading its way\nand taking astonishing risks among interminable processions of motor\nlorries, strings of ambulances or of mule carts, waggons with timber,\nwaggons with wire, waggons with men's gear, waggons with casks, waggons\ndiscreetly veiled, columns of infantry, cavalry, batteries _en route._\nEvery waggon that goes up full comes back empty, and many wounded were\ncoming down and prisoners and troops returning to rest. Goritzia had\nbeen taken a week or so before my arrival; the Isonzo had been crossed\nand the Austrians driven back across the Carso for several miles; all\nthe resources of Italy seemed to be crowding up to make good these\ngains and gather strength for the next thrust. The roads under all this\ntraffic remained wonderful; gangs of men were everywhere repairing the\nfirst onset of wear, and Italy is the most fortunate land in the world\nfor road metal; her mountains are solid road metal, and in this Venetian\nplain you need but to scrape through a yard of soil to find gravel.\n\nOne travelled through a choking dust under the blue sky, and above the\nsteady incessant dusty succession of lorry, lorry, lorry, lorry that\npassed one by, one saw, looking up, the tree tops, house roofs, or the\nsolid Venetian campanile of this or that wayside village. Once as we\nwere coming out of the great grey portals of that beautiful old relic of\na former school of fortification, Palmanova, the traffic became suddenly\nbright yellow, and for a kilometre or so we were passing nothing but\nSicilian mule carts loaded with hay. These carts seem as strange among\nthe grey shapes of modern war transport as a Chinese mandarin in painted\nsilk would be. They are the most individual of things, all two-wheeled,\nall bright yellow and the same size it is true, but upon each there are\nthey gayest of little paintings, such paintings as one sees in England\nat times upon an ice-cream barrow. Sometimes the picture will present\na scriptural subject, sometimes a scene of opera, sometimes a dream\nlandscape or a trophy of fruits or flowers, and the harness--now much\nout of repair--is studded with brass. Again and again I have passed\nstrings of these gay carts; all Sicily must be swept of them.\n\nThrough the dust I came to Aquileia, which is now an old cathedral,\nbuilt upon the remains of a very early basilica, standing in a space in\na scattered village. But across this dusty space there was carried the\nhead of the upstart Maximinus who murdered Alexander Severus, and\nlater Aquileia brought Attila near to despair. Our party alighted; we\ninspected a very old mosaic floor which has been uncovered since the\nAustrian retreat. The Austrian priests have gone too, and their Italian\nsuccessors are already tracing out a score of Roman traces that it was\nthe Austrian custom to minimise. Captain Pirelli refreshed my historical\nmemories; it was rather like leaving a card on Gibbon _en route_ for\ncontemporary history.\n\nBy devious routes I went on to certain batteries of big guns which had\nplayed their part in hammering the Austrian left above Monfalcone across\nan arm of the Adriatic, and which were now under orders to shift and\nmove up closer. The battery was the most unobtrusive of batteries; its\none desire seemed to be to appear a simple piece of woodland in the eye\nof God and the aeroplane. I went about the network of railways and paths\nunder the trees that a modern battery requires, and came presently upon\na great gun that even at the first glance seemed a little less carefully\nhidden than its fellows. Then I saw that it was a most ingenious dummy\nmade of a tree and logs and so forth. It was in the emplacement of a\nreal gun that had been located; it had its painted sandbags about it\njust the same, and it felt itself so entirely a part of the battery that\nwhenever its companions fired t burnt a flash and kicked up a dust. It\nwas an excellent example of the great art of camouflage which this war\nhas developed.\n\nI went on through the wood to a shady observation post high in a tree,\ninto which I clambered with my guide. I was able from this position to\nget a very good idea of the lie of the Italian eastern front. I was in\nthe delta of the Isonzo. Directly in front of me were some marshes\nand the extreme tip of the Adriatic Sea, at the head of which was\nMonfalcone, now in Italian hands. Behind Monfalcone ran the red ridge\nof the Carso, of which the Italians had just captured the eastern half.\nBehind this again rose the mountains to the east of the Isonzo which\nthe Austrians still held. The Isonzo came towards me from out of the\nmountains, in a great westward curve. Fifteen or sixteen miles away\nwhere it emerged from the mountains lay the pleasant and prosperous town\nof Goritzia, and at the westward point of the great curve was Sagrado\nwith its broken bridge. The battle of Goritzia was really not fought at\nGoritzia at all. What happened was the brilliant and bloody storming\nof Mounts Podgora and Sabotino on the western side of the river above\nGoritzia, and simultaneously a crossing at Sagrado below Goritzia and\na magnificent rush up the plateau and across the plateau of the Carso.\nGoritzia itself was not organised for defence, and the Austrians were\nso surprised by the rapid storm of the mountains to the north-west of it\nand of the Carso to the south-east, that they made no fight in the town\nitself.\n\nAs a consequence when I visited it I found it very little\ninjured--compared, that is, with such other towns as have been fought\nthrough. Here and there the front of a house has been knocked in by\nan Austrian shell, or a lamp-post prostrated. But the road bridge had\nsuffered a good deal; its iron parapet was twisted about by shell bursts\nand interwoven with young trees and big boughs designed to screen the\npasser-by from the observation of the Austrian gunners upon Monte Santo.\nHere and there were huge holes through which one could look down upon\nthe blue trickles of water in the stony river bed far below. The driver\nof our automobile displayed what seemed to me an extreme confidence in\nthe margins of these gaps, but his confidence was justified. At Sagrado\nthe bridge had been much more completely demolished; no effort had been\nmade to restore the horizontal roadway, but one crossed by a sort of\ntimber switchback that followed the ups and downs of the ruins.\n\nIt is not in these places that one must look for the real destruction\nof modern war. The real fight on the left of Goritzia went through the\nvillage of Lucinico up the hill of Podgora. Lucinico is nothing more\nthan a heap of grey stones; except for a bit of the church wall and the\ngable end of a house one cannot even speak of it as ruins. But in one\nplace among the rubble I saw the splintered top and a leg of a grand\npiano. Podgora hill, which was no doubt once neatly terraced and\ncultivated, is like a scrap of landscape from some airless, treeless\nplanet. Still more desolate was the scene upon the Carso to the right\n(south) of Goritzia. Both San Martino and Doberdo are destroyed beyond\nthe limits of ruination. The Carso itself is a waterless upland with but\na few bushy trees; it must always have been a desolate region, but now\nit is an indescribable wilderness of shell craters, smashed-up Austrian\ntrenches, splintered timber, old iron, rags, and that rusty thorny\nvileness of man's invention, worse than all the thorns and thickets of\nnature, barbed wire. There are no dead visible; the wounded have been\ncleared away; but about the trenches and particularly near some of the\ndug-outs there was a faint repulsive smell....\n\nYet into this wilderness the Italians are now thrusting a sort of order.\nThe German is a wonderful worker, they say on the Anglo-French front\nthat he makes his trenches by way of resting, but I doubt if he can\ntouch the Italian at certain forms of toil. All the way up to San\nMartino and beyond, swarms of workmen were making one of those carefully\ngraded roads that the Italians make better than any other people. Other\nswarms were laying water-pipes. For upon the Carso there are neither\nroads nor water, and before the Italians can thrust farther both must be\nbrought up to the front.\n\nAs we approached San Martino an Austrian aeroplane made its presence\nfelt overhead by dropping a bomb among the tents of some workmen, in a\nlittle scrubby wood on the hillside near at hand. One heard the report\nand turned to see the fragments flying and the dust. Probably they got\nsomeone. And then, after a little pause, the encampment began to spew\nout men; here, there and everywhere they appeared among the tents,\nrunning like rabbits at evening-time, down the hill. Soon after and\nprobably in connection with this signal, Austrian shells began to come\nover. They do not use shrapnel because the rocky soil of Italy makes\nthat unnecessary. They fire a sort of shell that goes bang and releases\na cloud of smoke overhead, and then drops a parcel of high explosive\nthat bursts on the ground. The ground leaps into red dust and smoke. But\nthese things are now to be seen on the cinema. Forthwith the men working\non the road about us begin to down tools and make for the shelter\ntrenches, a long procession going at a steady but resolute walk. Then\nlike a blow in the chest came the bang of a big Italian gun somewhere\nclose at hand....\n\nAlong about four thousand miles of the various fronts this sort of thing\nwas going on that morning....\n\n\n2\n\nThis Carso front is the practicable offensive front of Italy. From the\nleft wing on the Isonzo along the Alpine boundary round to the Swiss\nboundary there is mountain warfare like nothing else in the world; it\nis warfare that pushes the boundary backward, but it is mountain warfare\nthat will not, for so long a period that the war will be over first,\nhold out any hopeful prospects of offensive movements on a large scale\nagainst Austria or Germany. It is a short distance as the crow flies\nfrom Rovereto to Munich, but not as the big gun travels. The Italians,\ntherefore, as their contribution to the common effort, are thrusting\nrather eastwardly towards the line of the Julian Alps through Carinthia\nand Carniola. From my observation post in the tree near Monfalcone I saw\nTrieste away along the coast to my right. It looked scarcely as distant\nas Folkestone from Dungeness. The Italian advanced line is indeed\nscarcely ten miles from Trieste. But the Italians are not, I think,\ngoing to Trieste just yet. That is not the real game now. They are\nplaying loyally with the Allies for the complete defeat of the Central\nPowers, and that is to be achieved striking home into Austria. Meanwhile\nthere is no sense in knocking Trieste to pieces, or using Italians\ninstead of Austrian soldiers to garrison it.\n\n\n\n\nII. THE MOUNTAIN WAR\n\n\n1\n\nThe mountain warfare of Italy is extraordinarily unlike that upon any\nother front. From the Isonzo to the Swiss frontier we are dealing with\nhigh mountains, cut by deep valleys between which there is usually no\npracticable lateral communication. Each advance must have the nature of\nan unsupported shove along a narrow channel, until the whole mountain\nsystem, that is, is won, and the attack can begin to deploy in front\nof the passes. Geographically Austria has the advantage. She had the\ngentler slope of the mountain chains while Italy has the steep side,\nand the foresight of old treaties has given her deep bites into what is\nnaturally Italian territory; she is far nearer the Italian plain\nthan Italy is near any practicable fighting ground for large forces;\nparticularly is this the case in the region of the Adige valley and Lake\nGarda.\n\nThe legitimate war, so to speak, in this region is a mountaineering war.\nThe typical position is roughly as follows. The Austrians occupy valley\nA which opens northward; the Italians occupy valley B which opens\nsouthward. The fight is for the crest between A and B. The side that\nwins that crest gains the power of looking down into, firing into and\noutflanking the positions of the enemy valley. In most cases it is the\nItalians now who are pressing, and if the reader will examine a map of\nthe front and compare it with the official reports he will soon realise\nthat almost everywhere the Italians are up to the head of the southward\nvalleys and working over the crests so as to press down upon the\nAustrian valleys. But in the Trentino the Austrians are still well over\nthe crest on the southward slopes. When I was in Italy they still held\nRovereto.\n\nNow it cannot be said that under modern conditions mountains favour\neither the offensive or the defensive. But they certainly make\noperations far more deliberate than upon a level. An engineered road or\nrailway in an Alpine valley is the most vulnerable of things; its curves\nand viaducts may be practically demolished by shell fire or swept by\nshrapnel, although you hold the entire valley except for one vantage\npoint. All the mountains round about a valley must be won before that\nvalley is safe for the transport of an advance. But on the other hand a\nsurprise capture of some single mountain crest and the hoisting of one\ngun into position there may block the retreat of guns and material\nfrom a great series of positions. Mountain surfaces are extraordinarily\nvarious and subtle. You may understand Picardy on a map, but mountain\nwarfare is three-dimensional. A struggle may go on for weeks or months\nconsisting of apparently separate and incidental skirmishes, and then\nsuddenly a whole valley organisation may crumble away in retreat\nor disaster. Italy is gnawing into the Trentino day by day, and\nparticularly around by her right wing. At no time I shall be surprised\nto see a sudden lunge forward on that front, and hear a tale of guns\nand prisoners. This will not mean that she has made a sudden attack, but\nthat some system of Austrian positions has collapsed under her continual\npressure.\n\nSuch briefly is the _idea_ of mountain struggle. Its realities, I\nshould imagine, are among the strangest and most picturesque in all this\ntremendous world conflict. I know nothing of the war in the east, of\ncourse, but there are things here that must be hard to beat. Happily\nthey will soon get justice done to them by an abler pen than mine.\nI hear that Kipling is to follow me upon this ground; nothing can be\nimagined more congenial to his extraordinary power of vivid rendering\nthan this struggle against cliffs, avalanches, frost and the Austrian.\n\nTo go the Italian round needs, among other things, a good head.\nEverywhere it has been necessary to make roads where hitherto there have\nbeen only mule tracks or no tracks at all; the roads are often still in\nthe making, and the automobile of the war tourist skirts precipices and\ntakes hairpin bends upon tracks of loose metal not an inch too broad\nfor the operation, or it floats for a moment over the dizzy edge while\na train of mule transport blunders by. The unruly imagination of man's\nheart (which is \"only evil continually\") speculates upon what would be\nthe consequences of one good bump from the wheel of a mule cart. Down\nbelow, the trees that one sees through a wisp of cloud look far too\nsmall and spiky and scattered to hold out much hope for a fallen man\nof letters. And at the high positions they are too used to the\nvertical life to understand the secret feelings of the visitor from\nthe horizontal. General Bompiani, whose writings are well known to all\nEnglish students of military matters, showed me the Gibraltar he is\nmaking of a great mountain system east of the Adige.\n\n\"Let me show you,\" he said, and flung himself on to the edge of the\nprecipice into exactly the position of a lady riding side-saddle. \"You\nwill find it more comfortable to sit down.\"\n\nBut anxious as I am abroad not to discredit my country by unseemly\nexhibitions I felt unequal to such gymnastics without a proper rehearsal\nat a lower level. I seated myself carefully at a yard (perhaps it was a\ncouple of yards) from the edge, advanced on my trousers without dignity\nto the verge, and so with an effort thrust my legs over to dangle in the\ncrystalline air.\n\n\"That,\" proceeded General Bompiani, pointing with a giddy flourish of\nhis riding whip, \"is Monte Tomba.\"\n\nI swayed and half-extended my hand towards him. But he was still\nthere--sitting, so to speak, on the half of himself.... I was astonished\nthat he did not disappear abruptly during his exposition....\n\n\n2\n\nThe fighting man in the Dolomites has been perhaps the most wonderful\nof all these separate campaigns. I went up by automobile as far as the\nclambering new road goes up the flanks of Tofana No. 2; thence for a\ntime by mule along the flank of Tofana No. 1, and thence on foot to the\nvestiges of the famous Castelletto.\n\nThe aspect of these mountains is particularly grim and wicked; they are\nworn old mountains, they tower overhead in enormous vertical cliffs\nof sallow grey, with the square jointings and occasional clefts and\ngullies, their summits are toothed and jagged; the path ascends and\npasses round the side of the mountain upon loose screes, which descend\nsteeply to a lower wall of precipices. In the distance rise other harsh\nand desolate-looking mountain masses, with shining occasional scars\nof old snow. Far below is a bleak valley of stunted pine trees through\nwhich passes the road of the Dolomites.\n\nAs I ascended the upper track two bandages men were coming down on led\nmules. It was mid-August, and they were suffering from frostbite.\nAcross the great gap between the summits a minute traveller with\nsome provisions was going up by wire to some post upon the crest. For\neverywhere upon the icy pinnacles are observation posts directing the\nfire of the big guns on the slopes below, or machine-gun stations, or\nlittle garrisons that sit and wait through the bleak days. Often\nthey have no link with the world below but a precipitous climb or a\n\"teleferic\" wire. Snow and frost may cut them off absolutely for weeks\nfrom the rest of mankind. The sick and wounded must begin their journey\ndown to help and comfort in a giddy basket that swings down to the head\nof the mule track below.\n\nOriginally all these crests were in Austrian hands; they were stormed\nby the Alpini under almost incredible conditions. For fifteen days, for\nexample, they fought their way up these screes on the flanks of Tofana\nNo. 2 to the ultimate crags, making perhaps a hundred metres of ascent\neach day, hiding under rocks and in holes in the daylight and receiving\nfresh provisions and ammunition and advancing by night. They were\nsubjected to rifle fire, machine-gun fire and bombs of a peculiar sort,\nbig iron balls of the size of a football filled with explosive that were\njust flung down the steep. They dodged flares and star shells. At one\nplace they went up a chimney that would be far beyond the climbing\npowers of any but a very active man. It must have been like storming the\nskies. The dead and wounded rolled away often into inaccessible ravines.\nStray skeletons, rags of uniform, fragments of weapons, will add to the\nclimbing interest of these gaunt masses for many years to come. In this\nmanner it was that Tofana No. 2 was taken.\n\nNow the Italians are organising this prize, and I saw winding up far\nabove me on the steep grey slope a multitudinous string of little things\nthat looked like black ants, each carrying a small bright yellow egg.\nThey were mules bringing back balks of timber....\n\nBut one position held out invincibly; this was the Castelletto, a great\nnatural fortress of rock standing out at an angle of the mountain\nin such a position that it commanded the Italian communications (the\nDolomite road) in the valley below, and rendered all their positions\nuncomfortable and insecure. This obnoxious post was practically\ninaccessible either from above or below, and it barred the Italians\neven from looking into the Val Travenanzes which it defended. It was, in\nfact, an impregnable position, and against it was pitted the invincible\n5th Group of the Alpini. It was the old problem of the irresistible\nforce in conflict with the immovable object. And the outcome has been\nthe biggest military mine in all history.\n\nThe business began in January, 1916, with surveys of the rock in\nquestion. The work of surveying for excavations, never a very simple\none, becomes much more difficult when the site is occupied by hostile\npersons with machine guns. In March, as the winter's snows abated, the\nboring machinery began to arrive, by mule as far as possible and then by\nhand. Altogether about half a kilometre of gallery had to be made to the\nmine chamber, and meanwhile the explosive was coming up load by load and\nresting first here, then there, in discreetly chosen positions. There\nwere at the last thirty-five tons of it in the inner chamber. And while\nthe boring machines bored and the work went on, Lieutenant Malvezzi was\ncarefully working out the problem of \"il massimo effetto dirompimento\"\nand deciding exactly how to pack and explode his little hoard. On the\neleventh of July, at 3.30, as he rejoices to state in his official\nreport, \"the mine responded perfectly both in respect of the\ncalculations made and of the practical effects,\" that is to say, the\nAustrians were largely missing and the Italians were in possession of\nthe crater of the Castelletto and looking down the Val Travenanzes from\nwhich they had been barred for so long. Within a month things had been\nso tidied up, and secured by further excavations and sandbags against\nhostile fire, that even a middle-aged English writer, extremely fagged\nand hot and breathless, could enjoy the same privilege. All this, you\nmust understand, had gone on at a level to which the ordinary tourist\nrarely climbs, in a rarefied, chest-tightening atmosphere, with wisps of\nclouds floating in the clear air below and club-huts close at hand....\n\nAmong these mountains avalanches are frequent; and they come down\nregardless of human strategy. In many cases the trenches cross avalanche\ntracks; they and the men in them are periodically swept away and\nperiodically replaced. They are positions that must be held; if the\nItalians will not face such sacrifices, the Austrians will. Avalanches\nand frostbite have slain and disabled their thousands; they have\naccounted perhaps for as many Italians in this austere and giddy\ncampaign as the Austrians....\n\n\n3\n\nIt seems to be part of the stern resolve of Fate that this, the greatest\nof wars, shall be the least glorious; it is manifestly being decided\nnot by victories but by blunders. It is indeed a history of colossal\nstupidities. Among the most decisive of these blunders, second only\nperhaps of the blunder of the Verdun attack and far outshining the wild\nraid of the British towards Bagdad, was the blunder of the Trentino\noffensive. It does not need the equipment of a military expert, it\ndemands only quite ordinary knowledge and average intelligence,\nto realise the folly of that Austrian adventure. There is some\njustification for a claim that the decisive battle of the war was fought\nupon the soil of Italy. There is still more justification for saying\nthat it might have been.\n\nThere was only one good point about the Austrian thrust. No one could\nhave foretold it. And it did so completely surprise the Italians as to\ncatch them without any prepared line of positions in the rear. On the\nvery eve of the big Russian offensive, the Austrians thrust eighteen\ndivisions hard at the Trentino frontier. The Italian posts were then in\nAustrian territory; they held on the left wing and the right, but they\nwere driven by the sheer weight of men and guns in the centre; they lost\nguns and prisoners because of the difficulty of mountain retreats to\nwhich I have alluded, and the Austrians pouring through reached not\nindeed the plain of Venetia, but to the upland valleys immediately above\nit, to Asiago and Arsiero. They probably saw the Venetian plain through\ngaps in the hills, but they were still separated from it even at Arsiero\nby what are mountains to an English eye, mountains as high as Snowdon.\nBut the Italians of such beautiful old places and Vicenza, Marostica,\nand Bassano could watch the Austrian shells bursting on the last line of\nhills above the plain, and I have no doubt they felt extremely uneasy.\n\nAs one motors through these ripe and beautiful towns and through the\nrich valleys that link them--it is a smiling land abounding in old\ncastles and villas, Vicenza is a rich museum of Palladio's architecture\nand Bassano is full of irreplaceable painted buildings--one feels that\nthe things was a narrow escape, but from the military point of view it\nwas merely an insane escapade. The Austrians had behind them--and some\nway behind them--one little strangulated railway and no good pass road;\ntheir right was held at Pasubio, their left was similarly bent back. In\nfront of them was between twice and three times their number of first\nclass troops, with an unlimited equipment. If they had surmounted\nthat last mountain crest they would have come down to almost certain\ndestruction in the plain. They could never have got back. For a time\nit was said that General Cadorna considered that possibility. From the\npoint of view of purely military considerations, the Trentino offensive\nshould perhaps have ended in the capitulation of Vicenza.\n\nI will confess I am glad it did not do so. This tour of the fronts has\nmade me very sad and weary with a succession of ruins. I can bear no\nmore ruins unless they are the ruins of Dusseldorf, Cologne, Berlin,\nor suchlike modern German city. Anxious as I am to be a systematic\nPhilistine, to express my preference for Marinetti over the Florentine\nBritish and generally to antagonise aesthetic prigs, I rejoiced over\nthat sunlit land as one might rejoice over a child saved from beasts.\n\nOn the hills beyond Schio I walked out through the embrasure of a big\ngun in a rock gallery, and saw the highest points upon the hillside\nto which the Austrian infantry clambered in their futile last attacks.\nBelow me were the ruins of Arsiero and Velo d'Astico recovered, and\nacross the broad valley rose Monte Cimone with the Italian trenches\nupon its crest and the Austrians a little below to the north. A very\nconsiderable bombardment was going on and it reverberated finely. (It\nis only among mountains that one hears anything that one can call the\nthunder of guns. The heaviest bombardments I heard in France sounded\nmerely like Brock's benefit on a much large scale, and disappointed me\nextremely.) As I sat and listened to the uproar and watched the shells\nburst on Cimone and far away up the valley over Castelletto above\nPedescala, Captain Pirelli pointed out the position of the Austrian\nfrontier. I doubt if the English people realise that the utmost depth to\nwhich this great Trentino offensive, which exhausted Austria, wasted the\nflower of the Hungarian army and led directly to the Galician disasters\nand the intervention of Rumania, penetrated into Italian territory was\nabout six miles.\n\n\n\n\nIII. BEHIND THE FRONT\n\n\n1\n\nI have a peculiar affection for Verona and certain things in Verona.\nItalians must forgive us English this little streak of impertinent\nproprietorship in the beautiful things of their abundant land. It is\nquite open to them to revenge themselves by professing a tenderness for\nLiverpool or Leeds. It was, for instance, with a peculiar and\npersonal indignation that I saw where an Austrian air bomb had killed\nfive-and-thirty people in the Piazza Erbe. Somehow in that jolly old\nplace, a place that have very much of the quality of a very pretty and\ncheerful old woman, it seemed exceptionally an outrage. And I made a\nspecial pilgrimage to see how it was with that monument of Can Grande,\nthe equestrian Scaliger with the sidelong grin, for whom I confess a\nridiculous admiration. Can Grande, I rejoice to say, has retired into a\ncase of brickwork, surmounted by a steep roof of thick iron plates; no\naeroplane exists to carry bombs enough to smash that covering; there he\nwill smile securely in the darkness until peace comes again.\n\nAll over Venetia the Austrian seaplanes are making the same sort of\nidiot raid on lighted places that the Zeppelins have been making over\nEngland. These raids do no effective military work. What conceivable\nmilitary advantage can there be in dropping bombs into a marketing\ncrowd? It is a sort of anti-Teutonic propaganda by the Central Powers to\nwhich they seem to have been incited by their own evil genius. It is\nas if they could convince us that there is an essential malignity in\nGermans, that until the German powers are stamped down into the mud\nthey will continue to do evil things. All of the Allies have borne the\nthrusting and boasting of Germany with exemplary patience for half a\ncentury; England gave her Heligoland and stood out of the way of her\ncolonial expansion, Italy was a happy hunting ground for her\nbusiness enterprise, France had come near resignation on the score of\nAlsace-Lorraine. And then over and above the great outrage of the\nwar come these incessant mean-spirited atrocities. A great and simple\nwickedness it is possible to forgive; the war itself, had it been\nfought greatly by Austria and Germany, would have made no such deep and\nenduring breach as these silly, futile assassinations have down between\nthe Austro-Germans and the rest of the civilised world. One great\nmisdeed is a thing understandable and forgivable; what grows upon the\nconsciousness of the world is the persuasion that here we fight not a\nnational sin but a national insanity; that we dare not leave the German\nthe power to attack other nations any more for ever....\n\nVenice has suffered particularly from this ape-like impulse to hurt and\nterrorise enemy non-combatants. Venice has indeed suffered from this war\nfar more than any other town in Italy. Her trade has largely ceased;\nshe has no visitors. I woke up on my way to Udine and found my train at\nVenice with an hour to spare; after much examining and stamping of my\npassport I was allowed outside the station wicket to get coffee in the\nrefreshment room and a glimpse of a very sad and silent Grand Canal.\nThere was nothing doing; a black despondent remnant of the old crowd\nof gondolas browsed dreamily among against the quay to stare at me the\nbetter. The empty palaces seemed to be sleeping in the morning sunshine\nbecause it was not worth while to wake up....\n\n\n2\n\nExcept in the case of Venice, the war does not seem as yet to have made\nnearly such a mark upon life in Italy as it has in England or provincial\nFrance. People speak of Italy as a poor country, but that is from a\nbanker's point of view. In some respects she is the richest country on\nearth, and in the matter of staying power I should think she is\nbetter off than any other belligerent. She produces food in abundance\neverywhere; her women are agricultural workers, so that the interruption\nof food production by the war has been less serious in Italy than in any\nother part of Europe. In peace time, she has constantly exported labour;\nthe Italian worker has been a seasonal emigrant to America, north and\nsouth, to Switzerland, Germany and the south of France. The cessation of\nthis emigration has given her great reserves of man power, so that she\nhas carried on her admirable campaign with less interference with her\nnormal economic life than any other power. The first person I spoke to\nupon the platform at Modane was a British officer engaged in forwarding\nItalian potatoes to the British front in France. Afterwards, on my\nreturn, when a little passport irregularity kept me for half a day in\nModane, I went for a walk with him along the winding pass road that goes\ndown into France. \"You see hundreds and hundreds of new Fiat cars,\" he\nremarked, \"along here--going up to the French front.\"\n\nBut there is a return trade. Near Paris I saw scores of thousands of\nshells piled high to go to Italy....\n\nI doubt if English people fully realise either the economic sturdiness\nor the political courage of their Italian ally. Italy is not merely\nfighting a first-class war in first-class fashion but she is doing\na big, dangerous, generous and far-sighted thing in fighting at all.\nFrance and England were obliged to fight; the necessity was as plain as\ndaylight. The participation of Italy demanded a remoter wisdom. In the\nlong run she would have been swallowed up economically and politically\nby Germany if she had not fought; but that was not a thing staring her\nplainly in the face as the danger, insult and challenge stared France\nand England in the face. What did stare her in the face was not merely a\nconsiderable military and political risk, but the rupture of very close\nfinancial and commercial ties. I found thoughtful men talking everywhere\nI have been in Italy of two things, of the Jugo-Slav riddle and of the\nquestion of post war finance. So far as the former matter goes, I think\nthe Italians are set upon the righteous solution of all such riddles,\nthey are possessed by an intelligent generosity. They are clearly set\nupon deserving Jugo-Slav friendship; they understand the plain necessity\nof open and friendly routes towards Roumania. It was an Italian who set\nout to explain to me that Fiume must be at least a free port; it\nwould be wrong and foolish to cut the trade of Hungary off from the\nMediterranean. But the banking puzzle is a more intricate and puzzling\nmatter altogether than the possibility of trouble between Italian and\nJugo-Slav.\n\nI write of these things with the simplicity of an angel, but without an\nangelic detachment. Here are questions into which one does not so much\nrush as get reluctantly pushed. Currency and banking are dry distasteful\nquestions, but it is clear that they are too much in the hands of\nmystery-mongers; it is as much the duty of anyone who talks and writes\nof affairs, it is as much the duty of every sane adult, to bring his\npossibly poor and unsuitable wits to bear upon these things, as it is\nfor him to vote or enlist or pay his taxes. Behind the simple ostensible\nspectacle of Italy recovering the unredeemed Italy of the Trentino\nand East Venetia, goes on another drama. Has Italy been sinking into\nsomething rather hard to define called \"economic slavery\"? Is she or is\nshe not escaping from that magical servitude? Before this question has\nbeen under discussion for a minute comes a name--for a time I was really\nquite unable to decide whether it is the name of the villain in the\npiece or of the maligned heroine, or a secret society or a gold mine,\nor a pestilence or a delusion--the name of the _Banca Commerciale\nItaliana._\n\nBanking in a country undergoing so rapid and vigorous an economic\ndevelopment as Italy is very different from the banking we simple\nEnglish know of at home. Banking in England, like land-owning, has\nhitherto been a sort of hold up. There were always borrowers, there were\nalways tenants, and all that had to be done was to refuse, obstruct,\ndelay and worry the helpless borrower or would-be tenant until the\nmaximum of security and profit was obtained. I have never borrowed but\nI have built, and I know something of the extreme hauteur of property of\nEngland towards a man who wants to do anything with land, and with\nmoney I gather the case is just the same. But in Italy, which already\npossessed a sunny prosperity of its own upon mediaeval lines, the banker\nhas had to be suggestive and persuasive, sympathetic and helpful. These\nare unaccustomed attitudes for British capital. The field has been far\nmore attractive to the German banker, who is less of a proudly impassive\nusurer and more of a partner, who demands less than absolute security\nbecause he investigates more industriously and intelligently. This great\nbank, the Banca Commerciale Italiana, is a bank of the German type: to\nbegin with, it was certainly dominated by German directors; it was a\nbank of stimulation, and its activities interweave now into the whole\nfabric of Italian commercial life. But it has already liberated\nitself from German influence, and the bulk of its capital is Italian.\nNevertheless I found discussion ranging about firstly what the Banca\nCommerciale essentially _was_, secondly what it might _become_, thirdly\nwhat it might _do_, and fourthly what, if anything, had to be done to\nit.\n\nIt is a novelty to an English mind to find banking thus mixed up with\npolitics, but it is not a novelty in Italy. All over Venetia there are\nagricultural banks which are said to be \"clerical.\" I grappled with this\nmystery. \"How are they clerical?\" I asked Captain Pirelli. \"Do they lend\nmoney on bad security to clerical voters, and on no terms whatever\nto anti-clericals?\" He was quite of my way of thinking. \"_Pecunia non\nolet_,\" he said; \"I have never yet smelt a clerical fifty lira note.\"...\nBut on the other hand Italy is very close to Germany; she wants easy\nmoney for development, cheap coal, a market for various products. The\ncase against the Germans--this case in which the Banca Commerciale\nItaliana appears, I am convinced unjustly, as a suspect--is that they\nhave turned this natural and proper interchange with Italy into the\nacquisition of German power. That they have not been merely easy\ntraders, but patriotic agents. It is alleged that they used their\nearly \"pull\" in Italian banking to favour German enterprises and German\npolitical influence against the development of native Italian business;\nthat their merchants are not bona-fide individuals, but members of\na nationalist conspiracy to gain economic controls. The German is a\npatriotic monomaniac. He is not a man but a limb, the worshipper of a\nnational effigy, the digit of an insanely proud and greedy Germania, and\nhere are the natural consequences.\n\nThe case of the individual Italian compactly is this: \"We do not like\nthe Austrians and Germans. These Imperialisms look always over the Alps.\nWhatever increases German influence here threatens Italian life. The\nGerman is a German first and a human being afterwards.... But on the\nother hand England seems commercially indifferent to us and France has\nbeen economically hostile...\"\n\n\"After all,\" I said presently, after reflection, \"in that matter of\n_Pecunia non olet_; there used to be fusses about European loans in\nChina. And one of the favourite themes of British fiction and drama\nbefore the war was the unfortunate position of the girl who accepted a\nloan from the wicked man to pay her debts at bridge.\"\n\n\"Italy,\" said Captain Pirelli, \"isn't a girl. And she hasn't been\nplaying bridge.\"\n\nI incline on the whole to his point of view. Money is facile\ncosmopolitan stuff. I think that any bank that settles down in Italy is\ngoing to be slowly and steadily naturalised Italian, it will become more\nand more Italian until it is wholly Italian. I would trust Italy to make\nand keep the Banca Commerciale Italiana Italian. I believe the Italian\nbrain is a better brain than the German article. But still I heard\npeople talking of the implicated organisation as if it were engaged in\nthe most insidious duplicities. \"Wait for only a year or so after the\nwar,\" said one English authority to me, \"and the mask will be off and it\nwill be frankly a 'Deutsche Bank' once more.\" They assure me that\nthen German enterprises will be favoured again, Italian and Allied\nenterprises blockaded and embarrassed, the good understanding of\nItalians and English poisoned, entirely through this organisation....\n\nThe reasonable uncommercial man would like to reject all this last sort\nof talk as \"suspicion mania.\" So far as the Banca Commerciale Italiana\ngoes, I at least find that easy enough; I quote that instance simply\nbecause it is a case where suspicion has been dispelled, but in\nregard to a score of other business veins it is not so easy to dispel\nsuspicion. This war has been a shock to reasonable men the whole world\nover. They have been forced to realise that after all a great number\nof Germans have been engaged in a crack-brained conspiracy against the\nnon-German world; that in a great number of cases when one does business\nwith a German the business does not end with the individual German. We\nhated to believe that a business could be tainted by German partners or\nGerman associations. If now we err on the side of over-suspicion, it is\nthe German's little weakness for patriotic disingenuousness that is most\nto blame....\n\nBut anyhow I do not think there is much good in a kind of witch-smelling\namong Italian enterprises to find the hidden German. Certain things are\nnecessary for Italian prosperity and Italy must get them. The Italians\nwant intelligent and helpful capital. They want a helpful France.\nThey want bituminous coal for metallurgical purposes. They want cheap\nshipping. The French too want metallurgical coal. It is more important\nfor civilisation, for the general goodwill of the Allies and for Great\nBritain that these needs should be supplied than that individual British\nmoney-owners or ship-owners should remain sluggishly rich by insisting\nupon high security or high freights. The control of British coal-mining\nand shipping is in the national interests--for international\ninterests--rather than for the creation of that particularly passive,\nobstructive, and wasteful type of wealth, the wealth of the mere\nprofiteer, is as urgent a necessity for the commercial welfare of France\nand Italy and the endurance of the Great Alliance as it is for the\nwell-being of the common man in Britain.\n\n\n3\n\nI left my military guide at Verona on Saturday afternoon and reached\nMilan in time to dine outside Salvini's in the Galleria Vittorio\nEmanuele, with an Italian fellow story-writer. The place was as full as\never; we had to wait for a table. It is notable that there were still\ngreat numbers of young men not in uniform in Milan and Turin and Vicenza\nand Verona; there was no effect anywhere of a depletion of men. The\nwhole crowded place was smouldering with excitement. The diners\nlooked about them as they talked, some talked loudly and seemed to be\nexpressing sentiments. Newspaper vendors appeared at the intersection\nof the arcades, uttering ambiguous cries, and did a brisk business of\nflitting white sheets among the little tables.\n\n\"To-night,\" said my companion, \"I think we shall declare war upon\nGermany. The decision is being made.\"\n\nI asked intelligently why this had not been done before. I forget the\nprecise explanation he gave. A young soldier in uniform, who had been\ndining at an adjacent table and whom I had not recognised before as a\nwriter I had met some years previously in London, suddenly joined in our\nconversation, with a slightly different explanation. I had been carrying\non a conversation in slightly ungainly French, but now I relapsed into\nEnglish.\n\nBut indeed the matter of that declaration of war is as plain as\ndaylight; the Italian national consciousness has not at first that\ndirect sense of the German danger that exists in the minds of the three\nnorthern Allies. To the Italian the traditional enemy is Austria, and\nthis war is not primarily a war for any other end than the emancipation\nof Italy. Moreover we have to remember that for years there has been\nserious commercial friction between France and Italy, and considerable\nmutual elbowing in North Africa. Both Frenchmen and Italians are\nresolute to remedy this now, but the restoration of really friendly\nand trustful relations is not to be done in a day. It has been an\nextraordinary misfortune for Great Britain that instead of boldly taking\nover her shipping from its private owners and using it all, regardless\nof their profit, in the interests of herself and her allies, her\ngovernment has permitted so much of it as military and naval needs have\nnot requisitioned to continue to ply for gain, which the government\nitself has shared by a tax on war profits. The Anglophobe elements in\nItalian public life have made the utmost of this folly or laxity in\nrelation more particularly to the consequent dearness of coal in Italy.\nThey have carried on an amazingly effective campaign in which this\nBritish slackness with the individual profiteer, is represented as if\nit were the deliberate greed of the British state. This certainly\ncontributed very much to fortify Italy's disinclination to slam the door\non the German connection.\n\nI did my best to make it clear to my two friends that so far from\nEngland exploiting Italy, I myself suffered in exactly the same way\nas any Italian, through the extraordinary liberties of our shipping\ninterest. \"I pay as well as you do,\" I said; \"the shippers' blockade of\nGreat Britain is more effective than the submarines'. My food, my coal,\nmy petrol are all restricted in the sacred name of private property.\nYou see, capital in England has hitherto been not an exploitation but\na hold-up. We are learning differently now.... And anyhow, Mr. Runciman\nhas been here and given Italy assurances....\"\n\nIn the train to Modane this old story recurred again. It is imperative\nthat English readers should understand clearly how thoroughly these\nlittle matters have been _worked_ by the enemy.\n\nSome slight civilities led to a conversation that revealed the Italian\nlady in the corner as an Irishwoman married to an Italian, and also\nbrought out the latent English of a very charming elderly lady opposite\nto her. She had heard a speech, a wonderful speech from a railway train,\nby \"the Lord Runciman.\" He had said the most beautiful things about\nItaly.\n\nI did my best to echo these beautiful things.\n\nThen the Irishwoman remarked that Mr. Runciman had not satisfied\neverybody. She and her husband had met a minister--I found afterwards\nhe was one of the members of the late Giolotti government--who had been\ntalking very loudly and scornfully of the bargain Italy was making with\nEngland. I assured her that the desire of England was simply to give\nItaly all that she needed.\n\n\"But,\" said the husband casually, \"Mr. Runciman is a shipowner.\"\n\nI explained that he was nothing of the sort. It was true that he came\nof a shipowning family--and perhaps inherited a slight tendency to\nsee things from a shipowning point of view--but in England we did not\nsuspect a man on such a score as that.\n\n\"In Italy I think we should,\" said the husband of the Irish lady.\n\n\n4\n\nThis incidental discussion is a necessary part of my impression of Italy\nat war. The two western allies and Great Britain in particular have to\nremember Italy's economic needs, and to prepare to rescue them from the\nblind exploitation of private profit. They have to remember these needs\ntoo, because, if they are left out of the picture, then it becomes\nimpossible to understand the full measure of the risk Italy has faced in\nundertaking this war for an idea. With a Latin lucidity she has counted\nevery risk, and with a Latin idealism she has taken her place by the\nside of those who fight for a liberal civilisation against a Byzantine\nimperialism.\n\nAs I came out of the brightly lit Galleria Vittorio Emanuele into the\ndarkened Piazza del Duomo I stopped under the arcade and stood looking\nup at the shadowy darkness of that great pinnacled barn, that marble\nbride-cake, which is, I suppose, the last southward fortress of the\nFranco-English Gothic.\n\n\"It was here,\" said my host, \"that we burnt the German stuff.\"\n\n\"What German stuff?\"\n\n\"Pianos and all sorts of things. From the shops. It is possible,\nyou know, to buy things too cheaply--and to give too much for the\ncheapness.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE WESTERN WAR (SEPTEMBER, 1916)\n\n\n\n\nI. RUINS\n\n\n1\n\nIf I had to present some particular scene as typical of the peculiar\nvileness and mischief wrought by this modern warfare that Germany has\nelaborated and thrust upon the world, I do not think I should choose as\nmy instance any of those great architectural wrecks that seem most to\nimpress contemporary writers. I have seen the injuries and ruins of the\ncathedrals at Arras and Soissons and the wreckage of the great church\nat Saint Eloi, I have visited the Hotel de Ville at Arras and seen\nphotographs of the present state of the Cloth Hall at Ypres--a building\nI knew very well indeed in its days of pride--and I have not been very\ndeeply moved. I suppose that one is a little accustomed to Gothic ruins,\nand that there is always something monumental about old buildings; it is\nonly a question of degree whether they are more or less tumble-down. I\nwas far more desolated by the obliteration of such villages as Fricourt\nand Dompierre, and by the horrible state of the fields and gardens\nround about them, and my visit to Arras railway station gave me all the\nsensations of coming suddenly on a newly murdered body.\n\nBefore I visited the recaptured villages in the zone of the actual\nfighting, I had an idea that their evacuation was only temporary,\nthat as soon as the war line moved towards Germany the people of the\ndevastated villages would return to build their houses and till their\nfields again. But I see now that not only are homes and villages\ndestroyed almost beyond recognition, but the very fields are destroyed.\nThey are wildernesses of shell craters; the old worked soil is buried\nand great slabs of crude earth have been flung up over it. No ordinary\nplough will travel over this frozen sea, let along that everywhere\nchunks of timber, horrible tangles of rusting wire, jagged fragments of\nbig shells, and a great number of unexploded shells are entangled in the\nmess. Often this chaos is stained bright yellow by high explosives, and\nacross it run the twisting trenches and communication trenches eight,\nten, or twelve feet deep. These will become water pits and mud pits into\nwhich beasts will fall. It is incredible that there should be crops from\nany of this region of the push for many years to come. There is no shade\nleft; the roadside trees are splintered stumps with scarcely the spirit\nto put forth a leaf; a few stunted thistles and weeds are the sole\nproofs that life may still go on.\n\nThe villages of this wide battle region are not ruined; they are\nobliterated. It is just possible to trace the roads in them, because\nthe roads have been cleared and repaired for the passing of the guns\nand ammunition. Fricourt is a tangle of German dug-outs. One dug-out\nin particular there promises to become a show place. It must be the\nmasterpiece of some genius for dug-outs; it is made as if its makers\nenjoyed the job; it is like the work of some horrible badger among\nthe vestiges of what were pleasant human homes. You are taken down a\ntimbered staircase into its warren of rooms and passages; you are shown\nthe places under the craters of the great British shells, where the wood\nsplintered but did not come in. (But the arrival of those shells must\nhave been a stunning moment.) There are a series of ingenious bolting\nshafts set with iron climbing bars. In this place German officers and\nsoldiers have lived continually for nearly two years. This war is,\nindeed, a troglodytic propaganda. You come up at last at the far end\ninto what was once a cellar of a decent Frenchman's home.\n\nBut there are stranger subterranean refuges than that at Fricourt. At\nDompierre the German trenches skirted the cemetery, and they turned the\ndead out of their vaults and made lurking places of the tombs. I walked\nwith M. Joseph Reinach about this place, picking our way carefully\namidst the mud holes and the wire, and watched the shells bursting away\nover the receding battle line to the west. The wreckage of the graves\nwas Durereqsue. And here would be a fragment of marble angle and here\na split stone with an inscription. Splinters of coffins, rusty iron\ncrosses and the petals of tin flowers were trampled into the mud, amidst\nthe universal barbed wire. A little distance down the slope is a brand\nnew cemetery, with new metal wreaths and even a few flowers; it is\na disciplined array of uniform wooden crosses, each with its list of\nsoldiers' names. Unless I am wholly mistaken in France no Germans will\never get a chance for ever more to desecrate that second cemetery as\nthey have done its predecessor.\n\nWe walked over the mud heaps and litter that had once been houses\ntowards the centre of Dompierre village, and tried to picture to\nourselves what the place had been. Many things are recognisable in\nDompierre that have altogether vanished at Fricourt; for instance,\nthere are quire large triangular pieces of the church wall upstanding\nat Dompierre. And a mile away perhaps down the hill on the road towards\nAmiens, the ruins of the sugar refinery are very distinct. A sugar\nrefinery is an affair of big iron receptacles and great flues and pipes\nand so forth, and iron does not go down under gun fire as stone or brick\ndoes. The whole fabric wars rust, bent and twisted, gaping with shell\nholes, that raggedest display of old iron, but it still kept its general\nshape, as a smashed, battered, and sunken ironclad might do at the\nbottom of the sea.\n\nThere wasn't a dog left of the former life of Dompierre. There was not\neven much war traffic that morning on the worn and muddy road. The guns\nmuttered some miles away to the west, and a lark sang. But a little way\nfarther on up the road was an intermediate dressing station, rigged up\nwith wood and tarpaulins, and orderlies were packing two wounded men\ninto an ambulance. The men on the stretchers were grey faced, as though\nthey had been trodden on by some gigantic dirty boot.\n\nAs we came back towards where our car waited by the cemetery I heard\nthe jingle of a horseman coming across the space behind us. I turned and\nbeheld one of the odd contrasts that seem always to be happening in\nthis incredible war. This man was, I suppose, a native officer of some\ncavalry force from French north Africa. He was a handsome dark brown\nArab, wearing a long yellow-white robe and a tall cap about which ran\na band of sheepskin. He was riding one of those little fine lean horses\nwith long tails that I think are Barbary horses, his archaic saddle rose\nfore and aft of him, and the turned-up toes of his soft leather boots\nwere stuck into great silver stirrups. He might have ridden straight\nout of the Arabian nights. He passed thoughtfully, picking his way\ndelicately among the wire and the shell craters, and coming into\nthe road, broke into a canter and vanished in the direction of the\nsmashed-up refinery.\n\n\n2\n\nAbout such towns as Rheims or Arras or Soissons there is an effect of\nwaiting stillness like nothing else I have ever experienced. At Arras\nthe situation is almost incredible to the civilian mind. The British\nhold the town, the Germans hold a northern suburb; at one point near the\nriver the trenches are just four metres apart. This state of tension has\nlasted for long months.\n\nUnless a very big attack is contemplated, I suppose there is no\nadvantage in an assault; across that narrow interval we should only\nget into trenches that might be costly or impossible to hold, and so it\nwould be for the Germans on our side. But there is a kind of etiquette\nobserved; loud vulgar talking on either side of the four-metre gap leads\nat once to bomb throwing. And meanwhile on both sides guns of various\ncalibre keep up an intermittent fire, the German guns register--I think\nthat is the right term--on the cross of Arras cathedral, the British\nguns search lovingly for the German batteries. As one walks about the\nsilent streets one hears, \"_Bang_---Pheeee---woooo\" and then\nfar away \"_dump._\" One of ours. Then presently back comes\n\"Pheeee---woooo---_Bang!_\" One of theirs.\n\nAmidst these pleasantries, the life of the town goes on. _Le Lion\nd'Arras_, an excellent illustrated paper, produces its valiant sheets,\nand has done so since the siege began.\n\nThe current number of _Le Lion d'Arras_ had to report a local German\nsuccess. Overnight they had killed a gendarme. There is to be a public\nfuneral and much ceremony. It is rare for anyone now to get killed;\neverything is so systematised.\n\nYou may buy postcards with views of the destruction at various angles,\nand send them off with the Arras postmark. The town is not without a\ncertain business activity. There is, I am told, a considerable influx\nof visitors of a special sort; they wear khaki and lead the troglodytic\nlife. They play cards and gossip and sleep in the shadows, and may not\nwalk the streets. I had one glimpse of a dark crowded cellar. Now and\nthen one sees a British soldier on some special errand; he keeps to the\npavement, mindful of the spying German sausage balloon in the air. The\nstreets are strangely quite and grass grows between the stones.\n\nThe Hotel de Ville and the cathedral are now mostly heaps of litter,\nbut many streets of the town have suffered very little. Here and there\na house has been crushed and one or two have been bisected, the front\nreduced to a heap of splinters and the back halves of the rooms left\nso that one sees the bed, the hanging end of the carpet, the clothes\ncupboard yawning open, the pictures still on the wall. In one place\na lamp stands on a chest of drawers, on a shelf of floor cut off\ncompletely from the world below.... Pheeee---woooo---_Bang!_ One would\nbe irresistibly reminded of a Sunday afternoon in the city of London, if\nit were not for those unmeaning explosions.\n\nI went to the station, a dead railway station. A notice-board requested\nus to walk around the silent square on the outside pavement and not\nacross it. The German sausage balloon had not been up for days; it had\nprobably gone off to the Somme; the Somme was a terrible vortex just\nthen which was sucking away the resources of the whole German line; but\nstill discipline is discipline. The sausage might come peeping up at any\nmoment over the station roof, and so we skirted the square. Arras was\nfought for in the early stages of the war; two lines of sand-bagged\nbreastworks still run obliquely through the station; one is where the\nporters used to put luggage upon cabs and one runs the length of the\nplatform. The station was a fine one of the modern type, with a glass\nroof whose framework still remains, though the glass powders the floor\nand is like a fine angular gravel underfoot. The rails are rails of\nrust, and cornflowers and mustard and tall grasses grow amidst the\nballast. The waiting-rooms have suffered from a shell or so, but there\nare still the sofas of green plush, askew, a little advertisement hung\nfrom the wall, the glass smashed. The ticket bureau is as if a giant had\nscattered a great number of tickets, mostly still done up in bundles, to\nDouai, to Valenciennes, to Lens and so on. These tickets are souvenirs\ntoo portable to resist. I gave way to that common weakness.\n\nI went out and looked up and down the line; two deserted goods trucks\nstood as if they sheltered under a footbridge. The grass poked out\nthrough their wheels. The railway signals seemed uncertain in their\nintimations; some were up and some were down. And it was as still and\nempty as a summer afternoon in Pompeii. No train has come into Arras for\ntwo long years now.\n\nWe lunched in a sunny garden with various men who love Arras but are\nweary of it, and we disputed about Irish politics. We discussed the\npolitical future of Sir F. E. Smith. We also disputed whether there was\nan equivalent in English for _embusque._ Every now and then a shell came\nover--an aimless shell.\n\nA certain liveliness marked our departure from the town. Possibly the\nGermans also listen for the rare infrequent automobile. At any rate, as\nwe were just starting our way back--it is improper to mention the exact\npoint from which we started--came \"Pheeee---woooo.\" Quite close. But\nthere was no _Bang!_ One's mind hung expectant and disappointed. It was\na dud shell.\n\nAnd then suddenly I became acutely aware of the personality of our\nchauffeur. It was not his business to talk to us, but he turned his\nhead, showed a sharp profile, wry lips and a bright excited eye, and\nremarked, \"_That_ was a near one--anyhow.\" He then cut a corner over\nthe pavement and very nearly cut it through a house. He bumped us over\na shell hole and began to toot his horn. At every gateway, alley, and\ncross road on this silent and empty streets of Arras and frequently in\nbetween, he tooted punctiliously. (It is not proper to sound motor horns\nin Arras.) I cannot imagine what the listening Germans made of it. We\npassed the old gates of that city of fear, still tooting vehemently, and\nthen with shoulders eloquent of his feelings, our chauffeur abandoned\nthe horn altogether and put his whole soul into the accelerator....\n\n\n3\n\nSoissons was in very much the same case as Arras. There was the same\npregnant silence in her streets, the same effect of waiting for the\nmoment which draws nearer and nearer, when the brooding German lines\naway there will be full of the covert activities of retreat, when the\nstreets of the old town will stir with the joyous excitement of the\nconclusive advance.\n\nThe organisation of Soissons for defence is perfect. I may not describe\nit, but think of whatever would stop and destroy an attacking party or\nfoil the hostile shell. It is there. Men have had nothing else to do and\nnothing else to think of for two years. I crossed the bridge the English\nmade in the pursuit after the Marne, and went into the first line\ntrenches and peeped towards the invisible enemy. To show me exactly\nwhere to look a seventy-five obliged with a shell. In the crypt of the\nAbbey of St. Medard near by it--it must provoke the Germans bitterly to\nthink that all the rest of the building vanished ages ago--the French\nboys sleep beside the bones of King Childebert the Second. They shelter\nsafely in the prison of Louis the Pious. An ineffective shell from a\nGerman seventy-seven burst in the walled garden close at hand as I came\nout from those thousand-year-old memories again.\n\nThe cathedral at Soissons had not been nearly so completely smashed up\nas the one at Arras; I doubt if it has been very greatly fired into.\nThere is a peculiar beauty in the one long vertical strip of blue sky\nbetween the broken arches in the chief gap where the wall has tumbled\nin. And the people are holding on in many cases exactly as they are\ndoing in Arras; I do not know whether it is habit or courage that is\nmost apparent in this persistence. About the chief place of the town\nthere are ruined houses, but some invisible hand still keeps the grass\nof the little garden within bounds and has put out a bed of begonias. In\nParis I met a charming American writer, the wife of a French artist, the\nlady who wrote _My House on the Field of Honour._ She gave me a queer\nlittle anecdote. On account of some hospital work she had been allowed\nto visit Soissons--a rare privilege for a woman--and she stayed the\nnight in a lodging. The room into which she was shown was like any other\nFrench provincial bedroom, and after her Anglo-Saxon habit she walked\nstraight to the windows to open them.\n\nThey looked exactly like any other French bedroom windows, with neat,\nclean white lace curtains across them. The curtains had been put there,\nbecause they were the proper things to put there.\n\n\"Madame,\" said the hostess, \"need not trouble to open the glass. There\nis no more glass in Soissons.\"\n\nBut there were curtains nevertheless. There was all the precise delicacy\nof the neatly curtained home life of France.\n\nAnd she told me too of the people at dinner, and how as the little\nserving-maid passed about a proud erection of cake and conserve and\ncream, came the familiar \"Pheeee---woooo---_Bang!_\"\n\n\"That must have been the Seminaire,\" said someone.\n\nAs one speaks of the weather or a passing cart.\n\n\"It was in the Rue de la Bueire, M'sieur,\" the little maid asserted with\nquiet conviction, poising the trophy of confectionery for Madame Huard\nwith an unshaking hand.\n\nSo stoutly do the roots of French life hold beneath the tramplings of\nwar.\n\n\n\n\nII. THE GRADES OF WAR\n\n\n1 Soissons and Arras when I visited them were samples of the deadlock\nwar; they were like Bloch come true. The living fact about war so far\nis that Bloch has not come true--_yet._ I think in the end he will come\ntrue, but not so far as this war is concerned, and to make that clear\nit is necessary to trouble the reader with a little disquisition upon\nwar--omitting as far as humanly possible all mention of Napoleon's\ncampaigns.\n\nThe development of war has depended largely upon two factors. One of\nthese is invention. New weapons and new methods have become available,\nand have modified tactics, strategy, the relative advantage of offensive\nand defensive. The other chief factor in the evolution of the war has\nbeen social organisation. As Machiavelli points out in his _Art of War_,\nthere was insufficient social stability in Europe to keep a properly\ntrained and disciplined infantry in the field from the passing of the\nRoman legions to the appearance of the Swiss footmen. He makes it very\nclear that he considers the fighting of the Middle Ages, though frequent\nand bloody, to be a confused, mobbing sort of affair, and politically\nand technically unsatisfactory. The knight was an egotist in armour.\nMachiavelli does small justice to the English bowmen. It is interesting\nto note that Switzerland, that present island of peace, was regarded by\nhim as the mother of modern war. Swiss aggression was the curse of the\nMilanese. That is a remark by the way; our interest here is to note that\nmodern war emerges upon history as the sixteenth century unfolds, as\nan affair in which the essential factor is the drilled and trained\ninfantryman. The artillery is developing as a means of breaking the\ninfantry; cavalry for charging them when broken, for pursuit and\nscouting. To this day this triple division of forces dominates soldiers'\nminds. The mechanical development of warfare has consisted largely in\nthe development of facilities for enabling or hindering the infantry\nto get to close quarters. As that has been made easy or difficult the\noffensive or the defensive has predominated.\n\nA history of military method for the last few centuries would be a\nrecord of successive alternate steps in which offensive and defensive\ncontrivances pull ahead, first one and then the other. Their relative\nfluctuations are marked by the varying length of campaigns. From the\nvery outset we have the ditch and the wall; the fortified place upon a\npass or main road, as a check to the advance. Artillery improves, then\nfortification improves. The defensive holds its own for a long period,\nwars are mainly siege wars, and for a century before the advent of\nNapoleon there are no big successful sweeping invasions, no marches\nupon the enemy capital and so on. There were wars of reduction, wars\nof annoyance. Napoleon developed the offensive by seizing upon the\nenthusiastic infantry of the republic, improving transport and mobile\nartillery, using road-making as an aggressive method. In spite of the\nsuccessful experiment of Torres Vedras and the warning of Plevna the\noffensive remained dominant throughout the nineteenth century.\n\nBut three things were working quietly towards the rehabilitation of the\ndefensive; firstly the increased range, accuracy and rapidity of rifle\nfire, with which we may include the development of the machine gun;\nsecondly the increasing use of the spade, and thirdly the invention of\nbarbed wire. By the end of the century these things had come so far into\nmilitary theory as to produce the great essay of Bloch, and to surprise\nthe British military people, who are not accustomed to read books or\ntalk shop, in the Boer war. In the thinly populated war region of South\nAfrica the difficulties of forcing entrenched positions were largely met\nby outflanking, the Boers had only a limited amount of barbed wire\nand could be held down in their trenches by shrapnel, and even at the\nbeginning of the present war there can be little doubt that we and\nour Allies were still largely unprepared for the full possibilities of\ntrench warfare, we attempted a war of manoeuvres, war at about the grade\nto which war had been brought in 1898, and it was the Germans who first\nbrought the war up to date by entrenching upon the Aisne. We had, of\ncourse, a few aeroplanes at that time, but they were used chiefly as a\nsort of accessory cavalry for scouting; our artillery was light and our\nshell almost wholly shrapnel.\n\nNow the grades of warfare that have been developed since the present\nwar began, may be regarded as a series of elaborations and counter\nelaborations of the problem which begins as a line of trenches behind\nwire, containing infantry with rifles and machine guns. Against this an\ninfantry attack with bayonet, after shrapnel fails. This we will call\nGrade A. To this the offensive replies with improved artillery, and\nparticularly with high explosive shell instead of shrapnel. By this the\nwire is blown away, the trench wrecked and the defender held down as\nthe attack charges up. This is Grade B. But now appear the dug-out\nelaborating the trench and the defensive battery behind the trench. The\ndefenders, under the preliminary bombardment, get into the dug-outs\nwith their rifles and machine guns, and emerge as fresh as paint as\nthe attack comes up. Obviously there is much scope for invention and\ncontrivance in the dug-out as the reservoir of counter attacks. Its\npossibilities have been very ably exploited by the Germans. Also the\ndefensive batteries behind, which have of course the exact range of the\ncaptured trench, concentrate on it and destroy the attack at the moment\nof victory. The trench falls back to its former holders under this fire\nand a counter attack. Check again for the offensive. Even if it can\ntake, it cannot hold a position under these conditions. This we will\ncall Grade A2; a revised and improved A. What is the retort from\nthe opposite side? Obviously to enhance and extend the range of the\npreliminary bombardment behind the actual trench line, to destroy\nor block, if it can, the dug-outs and destroy or silence the counter\noffensive artillery. If it can do that, it can go on; otherwise Bloch\nwins.\n\nIf fighting went on only at ground level Bloch would win at this stage,\nbut here it is that the aeroplane comes in. From the ground it would\nbe practically impossible to locate the enemies' dug-outs, secondary\ndefences, and batteries. But the aeroplane takes us immediately into a\nnew grade of warfare, in which the location of the defender's secondary\ntrenches, guns, and even machine-gun positions becomes a matter of\nextreme precision--provided only that the offensive has secured command\nof the air and can send his aeroplanes freely over the defender lines.\nThen the preliminary bombardment becomes of a much more extensive\ncharacter; the defender's batteries are tackled by the overpowering fire\nof guns they are unable to locate and answer; the secondary dug-outs and\nstrong places are plastered down, a barrage fire shuts off support\nfrom the doomed trenches, the men in these trenches are held down by a\nconcentrated artillery fire and the attack goes up at last to hunt\nthem out of the dug-outs and collect the survivors. Until the attack is\ncomfortably established in the captured trench, the fire upon the old\ncounter attack position goes on. This is the grade, Grade B2, to which\nmodern warfare has attained upon the Somme front. The appearance of\nthe Tank has only increased the offensive advantage. There at present\nwarfare rests.\n\nThere is, I believe, only one grade higher possible. The success of B2\ndepends upon the completeness of the aerial observation. The invention\nof an anti-aircraft gun which would be practically sure of hitting and\nbringing down an aeroplane at any height whatever up to 20,000 feet,\nwould restore the defensive and establish what I should think must be\nthe final grade of war, A3. But at present nothing of the sort exists\nand nothing of the sort is likely to exist for a very long time; at\npresent hitting an aeroplane by any sort of gun at all is a rare and\nuncertain achievement. Such a gun is not impossible and therefore we\nmust suppose such a gun will some day be constructed, but it will be of\na novel type and character, unlike anything at present in existence.\nThe grade of fighting that I was privileged to witness on the Somme, the\ngrade at which a steady successful offensive is possible, is therefore,\nI conclude, the grade at which the present war will end.\n\n\n2\n\nBut now having thus spread out the broad theory of the business, let me\ngo on to tell some of the actualities of the Somme offensive. They key\nfact upon both British and French fronts was the complete ascendancy of\nthe Allies aeroplanes. It is the necessary preliminary condition for\nthe method upon which the great generals of the French army rely in this\nsanitary task of shoving the German Thing off the soil of Belgium and\nFrance back into its own land. A man who is frequently throwing out\nprophecies is bound to score a few successes, and one that I may\nlegitimately claim is my early insistence upon that fact that the\nequality of the German aviator was likely to be inferior to that of his\nFrench or British rival. The ordinary German has neither the flexible\nquality of body, the quickness of nerve, the temperament, nor the mental\nhabits that make a successful aviator. This idea was first put into my\nhead by considering the way in which Germans walk and carry themselves,\nand by nothing the difference in nimbleness between the cyclists in the\nstreets of German and French towns. It was confirmed by a conversation I\nhad with a German aviator who was also a dramatist, and who came to\nsee me upon some copyright matter in 1912. He broached the view that\naviation would destroy democracy, because he said only aristocrats make\naviators. (He was a man of good family.) With a duke or so in my mind I\nasked him why. Because, he explained, a man without aristocratic quality\nin tradition, cannot possibly endure the \"high loneliness\" of the air.\nThat sounded rather like nonsense at the time, and then I reflected that\nfor a Prussian that might be true. There may be something in the German\ncomposition that does demand association and the support of pride\nand training before dangers can be faced. The Germans are social\nand methodical, the French and English are by comparison chaotic and\ninstinctive; perhaps the very readiness for a conscious orderliness\nthat makes the German so formidable upon the ground, so thorough and\nfore-seeking, makes him slow and unsure in the air. At any rate the\nexperiences of this war have seemed to carry out this hypothesis. The\nGerman aviators will not as a class stand up to those of the Allies.\nThey are not nimble in the air. Such champions as they have produced\nhave been men of one trick; one of their great men, Immelmann--he was\nput down by an English boy a month or so ago--had a sort of hawk's\nswoop. He would go very high and then come down at his utmost pace at\nhis antagonist, firing his machine gun at him as he came. If he missed\nin this hysterical lunge, he went on down.... This does not strike the\nAllied aviator as very brilliant. A gentleman of that sort can sooner or\nlater be caught on the rise by going for him over the German lines.\n\nThe first phase, then, of the highest grade offensive, the ultimate\ndevelopment of war regardless of expense, is the clearance of the air.\nSuch German machines as are up are put down by fighting aviators. These\nlast fly high; in the clear blue of the early morning they look exactly\nlike gnats; some trail a little smoke in the sunshine; they take\ntheir machine guns in pursuit over the German lines, and the German\nanti-aircraft guns, the Archibalds, begin to pattern the sky about them\nwith little balls of black smoke. From below one does not see men nor\nfeel that men are there; it is as if it were an affair of midges. Close\nafter the fighting machines come the photographic aeroplanes, with\ncameras as long as a man is high, flying low--at four or five thousand\nfeet that is--over the enemy trenches. The Archibald leaves these latter\nalone; it cannot fire a shell to explode safely so soon after firing;\nbut they are shot at with rifles and machine guns. They do not mind\nbeing shot at; only the petrol tank and the head and thorax of the pilot\nare to be considered vital. They will come back with forty or fifty\nbullet holes in the fabric. They will go under this fire along the\nlength of the German positions exposing plate after plate; one machine\nwill get a continuous panorama of many miles and then come back straight\nto the aerodrome to develop its plates.\n\nThere is no waste of time about the business, the photographs are\ndeveloped as rapidly as possible. Within an hour and a half after the\nphotographs were taken the first prints are going back into the bureau\nfor the examination of the photographs. Both British and French air\nphotographs are thoroughly scrutinised and marked.\n\nAn air photograph to an inexperienced eye is not a very illuminating\nthing; one makes our roads, blurs of wood, and rather vague buildings.\nBut the examiner has an eye that has been in training; he is a picked\nman; he has at hand yesterday's photographs and last week's photographs,\nmarked maps and all sorts of aids and records. If he is a Frenchman he\nis only too happy to explain his ideas and methods. Here, he will point\nout, is a little difference between the German trench beyond the wood\nsince yesterday. For a number of reasons he thinks that will be a new\nmachine gun emplacement; here at the centre of the farm wall they have\nbeen making another. This battery here--isn't it plain? Well, it's a\ndummy. The grass in front of it hasn't been scorched, and there's been\nno serious wear on the road here for a week. Presently the Germans will\nsend one or two waggons up and down that road and instruct them to make\nfigures of eight to imitate scorching on the grass in front of the gun.\nWe know all about that. The real wear on the road, compare this and this\nand this, ends here at this spot. It turns off into the wood. There's a\nsort of track in the trees. Now look where the trees are just a little\ndisplaced! (This lens is rather better for that.) _That's_ one gun. You\nsee? Here, I will show you another....\n\nThat process goes on two or three miles behind the front line. Very\nclean young men in white overalls do it as if it were a labour of love.\nAnd the Germans in the trenches, the German gunners, _know it is going\non._ They know that in the quickest possible way these observations of\nthe aeroplane that was over them just now will go to the gunners. The\ncareful gunner, firing by the map and marking by aeroplane, kite balloon\nor direct observation, will be getting onto the located guns and machine\nguns in another couple of hours. The French claim that they have located\nnew batteries, got their _tir de demolition_ upon them in and destroyed\nthem within five hours. The British I told of that found it incredible.\nEvery day the French print special maps showing the guns, sham guns,\ntrenches, everything of significance behind the German lines, showing\neverything that has happened in the last four-and-twenty hours. It is\npitiless. It is indecent. The map-making and printing goes on in the\nroom next and most convenient to the examination of the photographs.\nAnd, as I say, the German army knows of this, and knows that it cannot\nprevent it because of its aerial weakness. That knowledge is not the\nlast among the forces that is crumpling up the German resistance upon\nthe Somme.\n\nI visited some French guns during the _tir de demolition_ phase. I\ncounted nine aeroplanes and twenty-six kite balloons in the air at the\nsame time. There was nothing German visible in the air at all.\n\nIt is a case of eyes and no eyes.\n\nThe French attack resolves itself into a triple system of gunfire. First\nfor a day or so, or two or three days, there is demolition fire to smash\nup all the exactly located batteries, organisation, supports, behind the\nfront line enemy trenches; then comes barrage fire to cut off supplies\nand reinforcements; then, before the advance, the hammering down\nfire, \"heads down,\" upon the trenches. When at last this stops and the\ninfantry goes forward to rout out the trenches and the dug-outs, they\ngo forward with a minimum of inconvenience. The first wave of attack\nfights, destroys, or disarms the surviving Germans and sends them back\nacross the open to the French trenches. They run as fast as they can,\nhands up, and are shepherded farther back. The French set to work to\nturn over the captured trenches and organise themselves against any\ncounter attack that may face the barrage fire.\n\nThat is the formula of the present fighting, which the French have\ndeveloped. After an advance there is a pause, while the guns move up\nnearer the Germans and fresh aeroplane reconnaissance goes on. Nowhere\non this present offensive has a German counter attack had more than the\nmost incidental success; and commonly they have had frightful losses.\nThen after a few days of refreshment and accumulation, the Allied attack\nresumes.\n\nThat is the perfected method of the French offensive. I had the pleasure\nof learning its broad outlines in good company, in the company of M.\nJoseph Reinach and Colonel Carence, the military writer. Their talk\ntogether and with me in the various messes at which we lunched was for\nthe most part a keen discussion of every detail and every possibility\nof the offensive machine; every French officer's mess seems a little\ncouncil upon the one supreme question in France, _how to do it best._\nM. Reinach has made certain suggestions about the co-operation of the\nFrench and British that I will discuss elsewhere, but one great theme\nwas the constitution of \"the ideal battery.\" For years French military\nthought has been acutely attentive to the best number of guns for\neffective common action, and has tended rather to the small battery\ntheory. My two companies were playing with the idea that the ideal\nbattery was a battery of one big gun, with its own aeroplane and kite\nballoon marking for it.\n\nThe British seem to be associated with the adventurous self-reliance\nneeded in the air. The British aeroplanes do not simply fight the\nGermans out of the sky; they also make themselves an abominable nuisance\nby bombing the enemy trenches. For every German bomb that is dropped by\naeroplane on or behind the British lines, about twenty go down on\nthe heads of the Germans. British air bombs upon guns, stores and\ncommunications do some of the work that the French effect by their\nsystematic demolition fire.\n\nAnd the British aviator has discovered and is rapidly developing an\naltogether fresh branch of air activity in the machine-gun attack at a\nvery low altitude. Originally I believe this was tried in western Egypt,\nbut now it is being increasingly used upon the British front in France.\nAn aeroplane which comes down suddenly, travelling very rapidly, to\na few hundred feet, is quite hard to hit, even if it is not squirting\nbullets from a machine gun as it advances. Against infantry in the open\nthis sort of thing is extremely demoralising. It is a method of attack\nstill in its infancy, but there are great possibilities for it in the\nfuture, when the bending and cracking German line gives, as ultimately\nit must give if this offensive does not relax. If the Allies persist in\ntheir pressure upon the western front, if there is no relaxation in the\nsupply of munitions from Britain and no lapse into tactical stupidity, a\nGerman retreat eastward is inevitable.\n\nNow a cavalry pursuit alone may easily come upon disaster, cavalry can\nbe so easily held up by wire and a few machine guns. I think the Germans\nhave reckoned on that and on automobiles, probably only the decay of\ntheir _morale_ prevents their opening their lines now on the chance of\nthe British attempting some such folly as a big cavalry advance, but\nI do not think the Germans have reckoned on the use of machine guns in\naeroplanes, supported by and supporting cavalry or automobiles. At the\npresent time I should imagine there is no more perplexing consideration\namidst the many perplexities of the German military intelligence than\nthe new complexion put upon pursuit by these low level air developments.\nIt may mean that in all sorts of positions where they had counted\nconfidently on getting away, they may not be able to get away--from\nthe face of a scientific advance properly commanding and using modern\nmaterial in a dexterous and intelligent manner.\n\n\n\n\nIII. THE WAR LANDSCAPE\n\n\n1\n\nI saw rather more of the British than of the French aviators because\nof the vileness of the weather when I visited the latter. It is quite\nimpossible for me to institute comparisons between these two services. I\nshould think that the British organisation I saw would be hard to beat,\nand that none but the French could hope to beat it. On the Western front\nthe aviation has been screwed up to a very much higher level than on\nthe Italian line. In Italy it has not become, as it has in France, the\ndecisive factor. The war on the Carso front in Italy--I say nothing of\nthe mountain warfare, which is a thing in itself--is in fact still in\nthe stage that I have called B. It is good warfare well waged, but not\nsuch an intensity of warfare. It has not, as one says of pianos and\nvoices, the same compass.\n\nThis is true in spite of the fact that the Italians along of all the\nwestern powers have adopted a type of aeroplane larger and much more\npowerful than anything except the big Russian machines. They are not at\nall suitable for any present purpose upon the Italian front, but at\na later stage, when the German is retiring and Archibald no longer\nsearches the air, they would be invaluable on the western front because\nof their enormous bomb or machine gun carrying capacity. \"But sufficient\nfor the day is the swat thereof,\" as the British public schoolboy says,\nand no doubt we shall get them when we have sufficiently felt the need\nfor them. The big Caproni machines which the Italians possess are of 300\nh.p. and will presently be of 500 h.p. One gets up a gangway into them\nwas one gets into a yacht; they wave a main deck, a forward machine gun\ndeck and an aft machine gun; one may walk about in them; in addition\nto guns and men they carry a very considerable weight of bombs beneath.\nThey cannot of course beget up with the speed nor soar to the height\nof our smaller aeroplanes; it is as carriers in raids behind a force of\nfighting machines that they should find their use.\n\nThe British establishment I visited was a very refreshing and reassuring\npiece of practical organisation. The air force of Great Britain has\nhad the good fortune to develop with considerable freedom from old army\ntradition; many of its officers are ex-civil engineers and so forth;\nHeadquarters is a little shy of technical direction; and all this in\na service that is still necessarily experimental and plastic is to the\ngood. There is little doubt that, given a release from prejudice,\nbad associations and the equestrian tradition, British technical\nintelligence and energy can do just as well as the French. Our problem\nwith our army is not to create intelligence, there is an abundance of\nit, but to release it from a dreary social and official pressure. The\nair service ransacks the army for men with technical training and sees\nthat it gets them, there is a real keenness upon the work, and the men\nin these great mobile hangars talk shop readily and clearly.\n\nI have already mentioned and the newspapers have told abundantly of\nthe pluck, daring, and admirable work of our aviators; what is still\nuntellable in any detail is the energy and ability of the constructive\nand repairing branch upon whose efficiency their feats depend. Perhaps\nthe most interesting thing I saw in connection with the air work was\nthe hospital for damaged machines and the dump to which those hopelessly\ninjured are taken, in order that they may be disarticulated and all that\nis sound in them used for reconstruction. How excellently this work\nis being done may be judged from the fact that our offensive in July\nstarted with a certain number of aeroplanes, a number that would\nhave seemed fantastic in a story a year before the war began. These\naeroplanes were in constant action; they fought, they were shot down,\nthey had their share of accidents. Not only did the repair department\nmake good every loss, but after three weeks of the offensive the army\nwas fighting with fifty more machines than at the outset. One goes\nthrough a vast Rembrandtesque shed opening upon a great sunny field, in\nwhose cool shadows rest a number of interesting patients; captured and\nslightly damaged German machines, machines of our own with scars of\nbattle upon them, one or two cases of bad landing. The star case came\nover from Peronne. It had come in two days ago.\n\nI examined this machine and I will tell the state it was in, but I\nperceive that what I have to tell will read not like a sober statement\nof truth but like strained and silly lying. The machine had had a direct\nhit from an Archibald shell. The propeller had been clean blown away; so\nhad the machine gun and all its fittings. The engines had been stripped\nnaked and a good deal bent about. The timber stay over the aviator had\nbeen broken, so that it is marvellous the wings of the machine did not\njust up at once like the wings of a butterfly. The solitary aviator had\nbeen wounded in the face. He had then come down in a long glide into the\nBritish lines, and made a tolerable landing....\n\n\n2\n\nOne consequence of the growing importance of the aeroplane in warfare is\nthe development of a new military art, the art of camouflage. Camouflage\nis humbugging disguise, it is making things--and especially in this\nconnection, military things--seem not what they are, but something\npeaceful and rural, something harmless and quite uninteresting to\naeroplane observers. It is the art of making big guns look like\nhaystacks and tents like level patches of field.\n\nAlso it includes the art of making attractive models of guns, camps,\ntrenches and the like that are not bona-fide guns, camps, or trenches at\nall, so that the aeroplane bomb-dropper and the aeroplane observer may\nwaste his time and energies and the enemy gunfire be misdirected.\nIn Italy I saw dummy guns so made as to deceive the very elect at a\ndistance of a few thousand feet. The camouflage of concealment aims\neither at invisibility or imitation; I have seen a supply train look\nlike a row of cottages, its smoke-stack a chimney, with the tops of sham\npalings running along the back of the engine and creepers painted up\nits sides. But that was a flight of the imagination; the commonest\ncamouflage is merely to conceal. Trees are brought up and planted\nnear the object to be hidden, it is painted in the same tones as its\nbackground, it is covered with an awning painted to look like grass or\nearth. I suppose it is only a matter of development before a dummy cow\nor so is put up to chew the cud on the awning.\n\nBut camouflage or no camouflage, the bulk of both the French and British\nforces in the new won ground of the great offensive lay necessarily in\nthe open. Only the big guns and the advanced Red Cross stations had got\ninto pits and subterranean hiding places. The advance has been too rapid\nand continuous for the armies to make much of a toilette as they halted,\nand the destruction and the desolation of the country won afforded few\nfacilities for easy concealment. Tents, transport, munitions, these all\nindicated an army on the march--at the rate of half a mile in a week or\nso, to Germany. If the wet and mud of November and December have for a\ntime delayed that advance, the force behind has but accumulated for the\nresumption of the thrust.\n\n\n3\n\nA journey up from the base to the front trenches shows an interesting\nseries of phases. One leaves Amiens, in which the normal life threads\nits way through crowds of resting men in khaki and horizon blue, in\nwhich staff officers in automobiles whisk hither and thither, in which\nthere are nurses and even a few inexplicable ladies in worldly costume,\nin which restaurants and cafes are congested and busy, through which\nthere is a perpetual coming and going of processions of heavy vans to\nthe railway sidings. One dodges past a monstrous blue-black gun going\nup to the British front behind two resolute traction engines--the\nthree sun-blistered young men in the cart that trails behind lounge in\nattitudes of haughty pride that would shame the ceiling gods of Hampton\nCourt. One passes through arcades of waiting motor vans, through arcades\nof waiting motor vans, through suburbs still more intensely khaki or\nhorizon blue, and so out upon the great straight poplar-edged road--to\nthe front. Sometimes one laces through spates of heavy traffic,\nsometimes the dusty road is clear ahead, now we pass a vast aviation\ncamp, now a park of waiting field guns, now an encampment of cavalry.\nOne turns aside, and abruptly one is in France--France as one knew it\nbefore the war, on a shady secondary road, past a delightful chateau\nbehind its iron gates, past a beautiful church, and then suddenly we are\nin a village street full of stately Indian soldiers.\n\nIt betrays no military secret to say that commonly the rare tourist to\nthe British offensive passes through Albert, with its great modern red\ncathedral smashed to pieces and the great gilt Madonna and Child\nthat once surmounted the tower now, as everyone knows, hanging out\nhorizontally in an attitude that irresistibly suggests an imminent dive\nupon the passing traveller. One looks right up under it.\n\nPresently we begin to see German prisoners. The whole lot look entirely\ncontented, and are guarded by perhaps a couple of men in khaki. These\nGerman prisoners do not attempt to escape, they have not the slightest\ndesire for any more fighting, they have done their bit, they say, honour\nis satisfied; they give remarkably little trouble. A little way further\non perhaps we pass their cage, a double barbed-wire enclosure with a few\ntents and huts within.\n\nA string of covered waggons passes by. I turn and see a number of men\nsitting inside and looking almost as cheerful as a beanfeast in Epping\nForest. They make facetious gestures. They have a subdued sing-song going\non. But one of them looks a little sick, and then I notice not very\nobtrusive bandages. \"Sitting-up cases,\" my guide explains.\n\nThese are part of the casualties of last night's fight.\n\nThe fields on either side are now more evidently in the war zone.\nThe array of carts, the patches of tents, the coming and going of men\nincreases. But here are three women harvesting, and presently in a\ncornfield are German prisoners working under one old Frenchman. Then\nthe fields become trampled again. Here is a village, not so very much\nknocked about, and passing through it we go slowly beside a long column\nof men going up to the front. We scan their collars for signs of some\nfamiliar regiment. These are new men going up for the first time; there\nis a sort of solemn elation in many of their faces.\n\nThe men coming down are usually smothered in mud or dust, and unless\nthere has been a fight they look pretty well done up. They stoop under\ntheir equipment, and some of the youngsters drag. One pleasant thing\nabout this coming down is the welcome of the regimental band, which is\nusually at work as soon as the men turn off from the high road. I hear\nseveral bands on the British front; they do much to enhance the general\ncheerfulness. On one of these days of my tour I had the pleasure of\nseeing the ---th Blankshires coming down after a fight. As we drew\nnear I saw that they combined an extreme muddiness with an unusual\nelasticity. They all seemed to be looking us in the face instead of\nbeing too fagged to bother. Then I noticed a nice grey helmet dangling\nfrom one youngster's bayonet, in fact his eye directed me to it. A man\nbehind him had a black German helmet of the type best known in English\nillustrations; then two more grey appeared. The catch of helmets was\nindeed quite considerable. Then I perceived on the road bank above\nand marching parallel with this column, a double file of still muddier\nGermans. Either they wore caps or went bare-headed. There were no\nhelmets among them. We do not rob our prisoners but--a helmet is a\nweapon. Anyhow, it is an irresistible souvenir.\n\nNow and then one sees afar off an ammunition dump, many hundreds of\nstacks of shells--without their detonators as yet--being unloaded from\nrailway trucks, transferred from the broad gauge to the narrow gauge\nline, or loaded onto motor trolleys. Now and then one crosses a railway\nline. The railway lines run everywhere behind the British front, the\nconstruction follows the advance day by day. They go up as fast as the\nguns. One's guide remarks as the car bumps over the level\ncrossing, \"That is one of Haig's railways.\" It is an aspect of the\nCommander-in-Chief that has much impressed and pleased the men. And at\nlast we begin to enter the region of the former Allied trenches, we pass\nthe old German front line, we pass ruined houses, ruined fields, and\nthick patches of clustering wooden crosses and boards where the dead\nof the opening assaults lie. There are no more reapers now, there is no\nmore green upon the fields, there is no green anywhere, scarcely a tree\nsurvives by the roadside, but only overthrown trunks and splintered\nstumps; the fields are wildernesses of shell craters and coarse weeds,\nthe very woods are collections of blasted stems and stripped branches.\nThis absolutely ravaged and ruined battlefield country extends now along\nthe front of the Somme offensive for a depth of many miles; across it\nthe French and British camps and batteries creep forward, the stores,\nthe dumps, the railways creep forward, in their untiring, victorious\nthrust against the German lines. Overhead hum and roar the aeroplanes,\naway towards the enemy the humped, blue sausage-shaped kite balloons\nbrood thoughtfully, and from this point and that, guns, curiously\ninvisible until they speak, flash suddenly and strike their one short\nhammer-blow of sound.\n\nThen one sees an enemy shell drop among the little patch of trees on\nthe crest to the right, and kick up a great red-black mass of smoke and\ndust. We see it, and then we hear the whine of its arrival and at last\nthe bang. The Germans are blind now, they have lost the air, they are\nfiring by guesswork and their knowledge of the abandoned territory.\n\n\"They think they have got divisional headquarters there,\" someone\nremarks.... \"They haven't. But they keep on.\"\n\nIn this zone where shells burst the wise automobile stops and tucks\nitself away as inconspicuously as possible close up to a heap of ruins.\nThere is very little traffic on the road now except for a van or so that\nhurries up, unloads, and gets back as soon as possible. Mules and men\nare taking the stuff the rest of the journey. We are in a flattened\nvillage, all undermined by dug-outs that were in the original German\nsecond line. We report ourselves to a young troglodyte in one of these,\nand are given a guide, and so set out on the last part of the journey\nto the ultimate point, across the land of shell craters and barbed\nwire litter and old and new trenches. We have all put on British steel\nhelmets, hard but heavy and inelegant head coverings. I can write little\nthat is printable about these aesthetic crimes. The French and German\nhelmets are noble and beautiful things. These lumpish _pans._..\n\nThey ought to be called by the name of the man who designed them.\n\nPresently we are advised to get into a communication trench. It is not\na very attractive communication trench, and we stick to our track across\nthe open. Three or four shells shiver overhead, but we decide they are\nBritish shells, going out. We reach a supporting trench in which men are\nwaiting in a state of nearly insupportable boredom for the midday\nstew, the one event of interest in a day-long vigil. Here we are told\nimperatively to come right in at once, and we do.\n\nAll communication trenches are tortuous and practically endless. On\nan offensive front they have vertical sides of unsupported earth and\noccasional soakaways for rain, covered by wooden gratings, and they go\non and on and on. At rare intervals they branch, and a notice board says\n\"To Regent Street,\" or \"To Oxford Street,\" or some such lie. It is all\njust trench. For a time you talk, but talking in single file soon palls.\nYou cease to talk, and trudge. A great number of telephone wires come\ninto the trench and cross and recross it. You cannot keep clear of them.\nYour helmet pings against them and they try to remove it. Sometimes you\nhave to stop and crawl under wires. Then you wonder what the trench is\nlike in really wet weather. You hear a shell burst at no great distance.\nYou pass two pages of _The Strand Magazine._ Perhaps thirty yards on\nyou pass a cigarette end. After these sensational incidents the trench\nquiets down again and continues to wind endlessly--just a sandy,\nextremely narrow vertical walled trench. A giant crack.\n\nAt last you reach the front line trench. On an offensive sector it has\nnone of the architectural interest of first line trenches at such places\nas Soissons or Arras. It was made a week or so ago by joining up shell\ncraters, and if all goes well we move into the German trench along by\nthe line of scraggy trees, at which we peep discreetly, to-morrow night.\nWe can peep discreetly because just at present our guns are putting\nshrapnel over the enemy at the rate of about three shells a minute, the\npuffs follow each other up and down the line, and no Germans are staring\nout to see us.\n\nThe Germans \"strafed\" this trench overnight, and the men are tired and\nsleepy. Our guns away behind us are doing their best now to give them\na rest by strafing the Germans. One or two men are in each forward sap\nkeeping a look out; the rest sleep, a motionless sleep, in the earthy\nshelter pits that have been scooped out. One officer sits by a telephone\nunder an earth-covered tarpaulin, and a weary man is doing the toilet of\na machine gun. We go on to a shallow trench in which we must stoop, and\nwhich has been badly knocked about.... Here we have to stop. The road to\nBerlin is not opened up beyond this point.\n\nMy companion on this excursion is a man I have admired for years and\nnever met until I came out to see the war, a fellow writer. He is a\njournalist let loose. Two-thirds of the junior British officers I met\non this journey were really not \"army men\" at all. One finds that the\napparent subaltern is really a musician, or a musical critic, or an\nEgyptologist, or a solicitor, or a cloth manufacturer, or a writer. At\nthe outbreak of the war my guide dyed his hair to conceal its tell-tale\nsilver, and having been laughed to scorn by the ordinary recruiting\npeople, enlisted in the sportsmen's battalion. He was wounded, and then\nthe authorities discovered that he was likely to be of more use with a\ncommission and drew him, in spite of considerable resistance, out of the\nfiring line. To which he always returns whenever he can get a visitor\nto take with him as an excuse. He now stood up, fairly high and clear,\nexplaining casually that the Germans were no longer firing, and showed\nme the points of interest.\n\nI had come right up to No Man's Land at last. It was under my chin. The\nskyline, the last skyline before the British could look down on Bapaume,\nshowed a mangy wood and a ruined village, crouching under repeated\ngobbings of British shrapnel. \"They've got a battery just there, and\nwe're making it uncomfortable.\" No Man's Land itself is a weedy space\nbroken up by shell craters, with very little barbed wire in front of us\nand very little in front of the Germans. \"They've got snipers in most of\nthe craters, and you see them at twilight hopping about from one to the\nother.\" We have very little wire because we don't mean to stay for very\nlong in this trench, but the Germans have very little wire because they\nhave not been able to get it up yet. They never will get it up now....\n\nI had been led to believe that No Man's Land was littered with the\nunburied dead, but I saw nothing of the sort at this place. There had\nbeen no German counter attack since our men came up here. But at one\npoint as we went along the trench there was a dull stench. \"Germans, I\nthink,\" said my guide, though I did not see how he could tell.\n\nHe looked at his watch and remarked reluctantly, \"If you start at once,\nyou may just do it.\"\n\nI wanted to catch the Boulogne boat. It was then just past one in\nthe afternoon. We met the stew as we returned along the communication\ntrench, and it smelt very good indeed.... We hurried across the great\nspaces of rusty desolation upon which every now and again a German shell\nwas bursting....\n\nThat night I was in my flat in London. I had finished reading the\naccumulated letters of some weeks, and I was just going comfortably to\nbed.\n\n\n\n\nIV. NEW ARMS FOR OLD ONES\n\n\n1\n\nSuch are the landscapes and method of modern war. It is more difficult\nin its nature from war as it was waged in the nineteenth century than\nthat was from the nature of the phalanx or the legion. The nucleus\nfact--when I talked to General Joffre he was very insistent upon\nthis point--is still as ever the ordinary fighting man, but all the\naccessories and conditions of his personal encounter with the fighting\nman of the other side have been revolutionised in a quarter of a\ncentury. The fighting together in a close disciplined order, shoulder\nto shoulder, which has held good for thousands of years as the best and\nmost successful fighting, has been destroyed; the idea of _breaking_\ninfantry formation as the chief offensive operation has disappeared, the\ncavalry charge and the cavalry pursuit are as obsolete as the cross-bow.\nThe modern fighting man is as individualised as a half back or a centre\nforward in a football team. Personal fighting has become \"scrapping\"\nagain, an individual adventure with knife, club, bomb, revolver or\nbayonet. In this war we are working out things instead of thinking them\nout, and these enormous changes are still but imperfectly apprehended.\nThe trained and specialised military man probably apprehends them as\nfeebly as anyone.\n\nThis is a thing that I want to state as emphatically as possible. It is\nthe pith of the lesson I have learnt at the front. The whole method of\nwar has been so altered in the past five and twenty years as to make\nit a new and different process altogether. Much the larger part of this\nalteration has only become effective in the last two years. Everyone is\na beginner at this new game; everyone is experimenting and learning.\n\nThe idea has been put admirably by _Punch._ That excellent picture\nof the old-fashioned sergeant who complains to his officer of the new\nrecruit; \"'E's all right in the trenches, Sir; 'e's all right at a\nscrap; but 'e won't never make a soldier,\" is the quintessence of\neverything I am saying here. And were there not the very gravest doubts\nabout General Smuts in British military circles because he had \"had no\nmilitary training\"? A Canadian expressed the new view very neatly on\nbeing asked, in consequence of a deficient salute, whether he wanted to\nbe a soldier, by saying, \"Not I! I want to be a fighter!\"\n\nThe professional officer of the old dispensation was a man specialised\nin relation to one of the established \"arms.\" He was an infantryman, a\ncavalryman, a gunner or an engineer. It will be interesting to trace the\nchanges that have happened to all these arms.\n\nBefore this war began speculative writers had argued that infantry drill\nin close formation had now no fighting value whatever, that it was no\ndoubt extremely necessary for the handling, packing, forwarding and\ndistribution of men, but that the ideal infantry fighter was now a\nhighly individualised and self-reliant man put into a pit with a machine\ngun, and supported by a string of other men bringing him up supplies and\nready to assist him in any forward rush that might be necessary.\n\nThe opening phases of the war seemed to contradict this. It did not\nat first suit the German game to fight on this most modern theory,\nand isolated individual action is uncongenial to the ordinary German\ntemperament and opposed to the organised social tendencies of German\nlife. To this day the Germans attack only in close order; they are\nunable to produce a real modern infantry for aggressive purposes, and it\nis a matter of astonishment to military minds on the English side that\nour hastily trained new armies should turn out to be just as good at\nthe new fighting as the most \"seasoned troops.\" But there is no reason\nwhatever why they should not be. \"Leading,\" in the sense of going\nahead of the men and making them move about mechanically at the word of\ncommand, has ceased. On the British side our magnificent new subalterns\nand our equally magnificent new non-commissioned officers play the part\nof captains of football teams; they talk their men individually into\nan understanding of the job before them; they criticise style and\nperformance. On the French side things have gone even farther. Every man\nin certain attacks has been given a large scale map of the ground over\nwhich he has to go, and has had his own individual job clearly marked\nand explained to him. All the Allied infantrymen tend to become\nspecialised, as bombers, as machine-gun men, and so on. The\nunspecialised common soldier, the infantryman who has stood and marched\nand moved in ranks and ranks, the \"serried lines of men,\" who are the\nmain substance of every battle story for the last three thousand years,\nare as obsolete as the dodo. The rifle and bayonet very probably are\nbecoming obsolete too. Knives and clubs and revolvers serve better in\nthe trenches. The krees and the Roman sword would be as useful. The fine\nflourish of the bayonet is only possible in the rare infrequent open.\nEven the Zulu assegai would serve as well.\n\nThe two operations of the infantry attack now are the rush and the\n\"scrap.\" These come after the artillery preparation. Against the rush,\nthe machine gun is pitted. The machine gun becomes lighter and more and\nmore controllable by one man; as it does so the days of the rifle draw\nto a close. Against the machine gun we are now directing the \"Tank,\"\nwhich goes ahead and puts out the machine gun as soon as it begins to\nsting the infantry rush. We are also using the swooping aeroplane with a\nmachine gun. Both these devices are of British origin, and they promise\nvery well.\n\nAfter the rush and the scrap comes the organisation of the captured\ntrench. \"Digging in\" completes the cycle of modern infantry fighting.\nYou may consider this the first or the last phase of an infantry\noperation. It is probably at present the least worked-out part of the\nentire cycle. Here lies the sole German superiority; they bunch and\ncrowd in the rush, they are inferior at the scrap, but they do dig like\nmoles. The weakness of the British is their failure to settle down. They\nlike the rush and the scrap; they press on too far, they get outflanked\nand lost \"in the blue\"; they are not naturally clever at the excavating\npart of the work, and they are not as yet well trained in making\ndug-outs and shelter-pits rapidly and intelligently. They display most\nof the faults that were supposed to be most distinctively French before\nthis war came to revolutionise all our conceptions of French character.\n\n\n2\n\nNow the operations of this modern infantry, which unlike any preceding\ninfantry in the history of war does not fight in disciplined formations\nbut as highly individualised specialists, are determined almost\ncompletely by the artillery preparation. Artillery is now the most\nessential instrument of war. You may still get along with rather bad\ninfantry; you may still hold out even after the loss of the aerial\nascendancy, but so soon as your guns fail you approach defeat.\nThe backbone process of the whole art of war is the manufacture in\noverwhelming quantities, the carriage and delivery of shell upon the\nvulnerable points of the enemy's positions. That is, so to speak,\nthe essential blow. Even the infantryman is now hardly more than the\nresiduary legatee after the guns have taken their toll.\n\nI have now followed nearly every phase in the life history of a shell\nfrom the moment when it is a segment of steel bar just cut off, to the\nmoment when it is no more than a few dispersed and rusting rags and\nfragments of steel--pressed upon the stray visitor to the battlefield as\nsouvenirs. All good factories are intensely interesting places to visit,\nbut a good munition factory is romantically satisfactory. It is as\nnearly free from the antagonism of employer and employed as any factory\ncan be. The busy sheds I visited near Paris struck me as being the most\nliving and active things in the entire war machine. Everywhere else I\nsaw fitful activity, or men waiting. I have seen more men sitting about\nand standing about, more bored inactivity, during my tour than I have\never seen before in my life. Even the front line trenches seem to\nslumber; the Angel of Death drowses over them, and moves in his sleep\nto crush out men's lives. The gunfire has an indolent intermittence.\nBut the munition factories grind on night and day, grinding against\nthe factories in Central Europe, grinding out the slow and costly and\nnecessary victory that should end aggressive warfare in the world for\never.\n\nIt would be very interesting if one could arrange a meeting between\nany typical Allied munition maker on the one hand, and the Kaiser and\nHindenburg, those two dominant effigies of the German nationalists'\ndream of \"world might.\" Or failing that, Mr. Dyson might draw the\nencounter. You imagine these two heroic figures got up for the\ninterview, very magnificent in shining helms and flowing cloaks,\ndecorations, splendid swords, spurs. \"Here,\" one would say, \"is the\npower that has held you. You were bolstered up very loyally by the Krupp\nfirm and so forth, you piled up shell, guns, war material, you hoped to\nsnatch your victory before the industrialisation and invention of the\nworld could turn upon you. But you failed. You were not rapid enough.\nThe battle of the Marne was your misfortune. And Ypres. You lost some\nchances at Ypres. Two can play at destructive industrialism, and now\nwe out-gun you. We are piling up munitions now faster than you. The\nessentials of this Game of the War Lord are idiotically simple, but it\nwas not of our choosing. It is now merely a question of months before\nyou make your inevitable admission. This is no war to any great\ncommander's glory. This gentleman in the bowler hat is the victor, Sire;\nnot you. Assisted, Sire, by these disrespectful-looking factory girls in\noveralls.\"\n\nFor example, there is M. Citroen. Before the war I understand he made\nautomobiles; after the war he wants to turn to and make automobiles\nagain. For the duration of the war he makes shell. He has been\ntemporarily diverted from constructive to destructive industrialism. He\ndid me the honours of his factory. He is a compact, active man in dark\nclothes and a bowler hat, with a pencil and notebook conveniently at\nhand. He talked to me in carefully easy French, and watched my face with\nan intelligent eye through his pince-nez for the signs of comprehension.\nThen he went on to the next point.\n\nHe took me through every stage of his process. In his office he showed\nme the general story. Here were photographs of certain vacant fields\nand old sheds--\"this place\"--he indicated the altered prospect from the\nwindow--\"at the outbreak of the war.\" He showed me a plan of the first\nundertaking. \"Now we have rather over nine thousand workpeople.\"\n\nHe showed me a little row of specimens. \"These we make for Italy. These\ngo to Russia. These are the Rumanian pattern.\"\n\nThence to the first stage, the chopping up of the iron bars, the\nfurnace, the punching out of the first shape of the shell; all this is\nmen's work. I had seen this sort of thing before in peace ironworks,\nbut I saw it again with the same astonishment, the absolute precision\nof movement on the part of the half-naked sweating men, the calculated\nefficiency of each worker, the apparent heedlessness, the real\ncertitude, with which the blazing hot cylinder is put here, dropped\nthere, rolls to its next appointed spot, is chopped up and handed on,\nthe swift passage to the cooling crude, pinkish-purple shell shape. Down\na long line one sees in perspective a practical symmetry, of furnace\nand machine group and the shells marching on from this first series\nof phases to undergo the long succession of operations, machine after\nmachine, across the great width of the shed in which eighty per cent\nof the workers are women. There is a thick dust of sounds in the air, a\nrumble of shafting, sudden thuddings, clankings, and M. Citroen has\nto raise his voice. He points out where he has made little changes in\nprocedures, cut out some wasteful movement.... He has an idea and makes\na note in the ever-ready notebook.\n\nThere is a beauty about all these women, there is extraordinary grace in\ntheir finely adjusted movements. I have come from an after-lunch coffee\nupon the boulevards and from watching the ugly fashion of our time;\nit is a relief to be reminded that most women can after all be\nbeautiful--if only they would not \"dress.\" these women wear simple\noveralls and caps. In the cap is a rosette. Each shed has its own colour\nof rosette.\n\n\"There is much esprit de corps here,\" says M. Citroen.\n\n\"And also,\" he adds, showing obverse as well as reverse of the world's\nproblem of employment and discipline, \"we can see at once if a woman is\nnot in her proper shed.\"\n\nAcross the great sheds under the shafting--how fine it must look at\nnight!--the shells march, are shaped, cut, fitted with copper bands,\ncalibrated, polished, varnished....\n\nThen we go on to another system of machines in which lead is reduced to\nplastic ribbons and cut into shrapnel bullets as the sweetstuff\nmakers pull out and cut up sweetstuff. And thence into a warren of hot\nunderground passages in which run the power cables. There is not a cable\nin the place that is not immediately accessible to the electricians. We\nvisit the dynamos and a vast organisation of switchboards....\n\nThese things are more familiar to M. Citroen than they are to me. He\nwants me to understand, but he does not realise that I would like a\nlittle leisure to wonder. What is interesting him just now, because it\nis the newest thing, is his method of paying his workers. He lifts\na hand gravely: \"I said, what we must do is abolish altogether the\ncounting of change.\"\n\nAt a certain hour, he explained, came pay-time. The people had done; it\nwas to his interest and their that they should get out of the works\nas quickly as possible and rest and amuse themselves. He watched them\nstanding in queues at the wickets while inside someone counted; so many\nfrancs, so many centimes. It bored him to see this useless, tiresome\nwaiting. It is abolished. Now at the end of each week the worker goes\nto a window under the initial of his name, and is handed a card on which\nthese items have been entered:\n\nBalance from last week. So many hours at so much. Premiums.\n\nThe total is so many francs, so many centimes. This is divided into\nthe nearest round number, 100, 120, 80 francs as the case may be, and a\nbalance of the odd francs and centimes. The latter is carried forward to\nthe next week's account. At the bottom of the card is a tear-off coupon\nwith a stamp, coloured to indicate the round sum, green, let us say, for\n100, blue for 130 francs. This is taken to a wicket marked 100 or 130 as\nthe case may be, and there stands a cashier with his money in piles of\n100 or 130 francs counted ready to hand; he sweeps in the coupon, sweeps\nout the cash. \"_Next!_\"\n\nI became interested in the worker's side of this organisation. I insist\non seeing the entrances, the clothes-changing places, the lavatories,\nand so forth of the organisation. As we go about we pass a string of\nelectric trolleys steered by important-looking girls, and loaded with\nshell, finished as far as these works are concerned and on their way\nto the railway siding. We visit the hospital, for these works demand a\nmedical staff. It is not only that men and women faint or fall ill, but\nthere are accidents, burns, crushings, and the like. The war casualties\nbegin already here, and they fall chiefly among the women. I saw a\nwounded woman with a bandaged face sitting very quietly in the corner.\n\nThe women here face danger, perhaps not quite such obvious danger as the\nwomen who, at the next stage in the shell's career, make and pack the\nexplosives in their silk casing, but quite considerable risk. And they\nwork with a real enthusiasm. They know they are fighting the Bloches as\nwell as any men. Certain of them wear Russian decorations. The women of\nthis particular factory have been thanked by the Tsar, and a number of\ndecorations were sent by him for distribution among them.\n\n\n3\n\nThe shell factory and the explosives shed stand level with the drill\nyard as the real first stage in one of the two essential _punches_ in\nmodern war. When one meets the shell again it is being unloaded from the\nrailway truck into an ammunition dump. And here the work of control is\nmuch more the work of a good traffic manager than of the old-fashioned\nsoldier.\n\nThe dump I best remember I visited on a wet and windy day. Over a great\nspace of ground the sidings of the rail-head spread, the normal gauge\nrail-head spread out like a fan and interdigitated with the narrow gauge\nlines that go up practically to the guns. And also at the sides camions\nwere loading, and an officer from the Midi in charge of one of these was\nbeing dramatically indignant at five minutes' delay. Between these\ntwo sets of lines, shells were piled of all sizes, I should think some\nhundreds of thousands of shells altogether, wet and shining in the rain.\nFrench reservists, soldiers from Madagascar, and some Senegalese were\nbusy at different points loading and unloading the precious freights.\nA little way from me were despondent-looking German prisoners handling\ntimber. All this dump was no more than an eddy as it were in the path\nof the shell from its birth from the steel bars near Paris to the\naccomplishment of its destiny in the destruction or capture of more\nGermans.\n\nAnd next the visitor meets the shell coming up upon a little trolley to\nthe gun. He sees the gunners, as drilled and precise as the men he saw\nat the forges, swing out the breech block and run the shell, which\nhas met and combined with its detonators and various other industrial\nproducts since it left the main dump, into the gun. The breech\ncloses like a safe door, and hides the shell from the visitor. It is\n\"good-bye.\" He receives exaggerated warning of the danger to his ears,\nstuffs his fingers into them, and opens his mouth as instructed, hears a\nloud but by no means deafening report, and sees a spit of flame near the\nbreech. Regulations of a severe character prevent his watching from an\naeroplane the delivery of the goods upon the customers opposite.\n\nI have already described the method of locating enemy guns and so forth\nby photography. Many of the men at this work are like dentists rather\nthan soldiers; they are busy in carefully lit rooms, they wear white\noveralls, they have clean hands and laboratory manners. The only really\nromantic figure in the whole of this process, the only figure that has\nanything of the old soldierly swagger about him still, is the aviator.\nAnd, as one friend remarked to me when I visited the work of the\nBritish flying corps, \"The real essential strength of this arm is the\norganisation of its repairs. Here is one of the repair vans through\nwhich our machine guns go. It is a motor workshop on wheels. But at any\ntime all this park, everything, can pack up and move forward like\nBarnum and Bailey's Circus. The machine guns come through this shop in\nrotation; they go out again, cleaned, repaired, made new again. Since we\ngot all that working we have heard nothing of a machine gun jamming in\nany air fight at all.\"...\n\nThe rest of the career of the shell after it has left the gun one must\nimagine chiefly from the incoming shell from the enemy. You see suddenly\na flying up of earth and stones and anything else that is movable in the\nneighbourhood of the shell-burst, the instantaneous unfolding of a dark\ncloud of dust and reddish smoke, which comes very quickly to a certain\nsize and then begins slowly to fray out and blow away. Then, after\nseeing the cloud of the burst you hear the hiss of the shell's approach,\nand finally you are hit by the sound of the explosion. This is the\nclimax and end of the life history of any shell that is not a dud\nshell. Afterwards the battered fuse may serve as some journalist's\npaper-weight. The rest is scrap iron.\n\nSuch is, so to speak, the primary process of modern warfare. I will\nnot draw the obvious pacifist moral of the intense folly of human\nconcentration upon such a process. The Germans willed it. We Allies\nhave but obeyed the German will for warfare because we could not do\notherwise, we have taken up this simple game of shell delivery, and we\nare teaching them that we can play it better, in the hope that so we\nand the world may be freed from the German will-to-power and all its\nhumiliating and disgusting consequences henceforth for ever. Europe\nnow is no more than a household engaged in holding up and if possible\noverpowering a monomaniac member.\n\n\n4\n\nNow the whole of this process of the making and delivery of a shell,\nwhich is the main process of modern warfare, is one that can be far\nbetter conducted by a man accustomed to industrial organisation or\ntransit work than by the old type of soldier. This is a thing that\ncannot be too plainly stated or too often repeated. Germany nearly won\nthis way because of her tremendously modern industrial resources; but\nshe blundered into it and she is losing it because she has too many men\nin military uniform and because their tradition and interests were to\npowerful with her. All the state and glories of soldiering, the bright\nuniforms, the feathers and spurs, the flags, the march-past, the\ndisciplined massed advance, the charge; all these are as needless and\nobsolete now in war as the masks and shields of an old-time Chinese\nbrave. Liberal-minded people talk of the coming dangers of militarism in\nthe face of events that prove conclusively that professional militarism\nis already as dead as Julius Caesar. What is coming is not so much the\nconversion of men into soldiers as the socialisation of the economic\norganisation of the country with a view to both national and\ninternational necessities. We do not want to turn a chemist or\na photographer into a little figure like a lead soldier, moving\nmechanically at the word of command, but we do want to make his\nchemistry or photography swiftly available if the national organisation\nis called upon to fight.\n\nWe have discovered that the modern economic organisation is in itself a\nfighting machine. It is so much so that it is capable of taking on and\ndefeating quite easily any merely warrior people that is so rash as to\npit itself against it. Within the last sixteen years methods of fighting\nhave been elaborated that have made war an absolutely hopeless adventure\nfor any barbaric or non-industrialised people. In the rush of larger\nevents few people have realised the significance of the rapid squashing\nof the Senussi in western Egypt, and the collapse of De Wet's rebellion\nin South Africa. Both these struggles would have been long, tedious\nand uncertain even in A.D. 1900. This time they have been, so to speak,\nchild's play.\n\nOccasionally into the writer's study there come to hand drifting\nfragments of the American literature upon the question of\n\"preparedness,\" and American papers discussing the Mexican situation. In\nnone of these is there evident any clear realisation of the fundamental\nrevolution that has occurred in military methods during the last two\nyears. It looks as if a Mexican war, for example, was thought of as an\naffair of rather imperfectly trained young men with rifles and horses\nand old-fashioned things like that. A Mexican war on that level might be\nas tedious as the South African war. But if the United States preferred\nto go into Mexican affairs with what I may perhaps call a 1916 autumn\noutfit instead of the small 1900 outfit she seems to possess at present,\nthere is no reason why America should not clear up any and every Mexican\nguerilla force she wanted to in a few weeks.\n\nTo do that she would need a plant of a few hundred aeroplanes, for the\nmost part armed with machine guns, and the motor repair vans and so\nforth needed to go with the aeroplanes; she would need a comparatively\nsmall army of infantry armed with machine guns, with motor transport,\nand a few small land ironclads. Such a force could locate, overtake,\ndestroy and disperse any possible force that a country in the present\nindustrial condition of Mexico could put into the field. No sort of\nentrenchment or fortification possible in Mexico could stand against\nit. It could go from one end of the country to the other without serious\nloss, and hunt down and capture anyone it wished....\n\nThe practical political consequence of the present development of\nwarfare, of the complete revolution in the conditions of warfare since\nthis century began, is to make war absolutely hopeless for any\npeoples not able either to manufacture or procure the very complicated\nappliances and munitions now needed for its prosecution. Countries like\nMexico, Bulgaria, Serbia, Afghanistan or Abyssinia are no more capable\nof going to war without the connivance and help of manufacturing states\nthan horses are capable of flying. And this makes possible such a\ncomplete control of war by the few great states which are at the\nnecessary level of industrial development as not the most Utopian of us\nhave hitherto dared to imagine.\n\n\n5\n\nInfantrymen with automobile transport, plentiful machine guns, Tanks and\nsuch-like accessories; that is the first Arm in modern war. The factory\nhand and all the material of the shell route from the factory to the gun\nconstitute the second Arm. Thirdly comes the artillery, the guns and the\nphotographic aeroplanes working with the guns. Next I suppose we\nmust count sappers and miners as a fourth Arm of greatly increased\nimportance. The fifth and last combatant Arm is the modern substitute\nfor cavalry; and that also is essentially a force of aeroplanes\nsupported by automobiles. Several of the French leaders with whom I\ntalked seemed to be convinced that the horse is absolutely done with in\nmodern warfare. There is nothing, they declared, that cavalry ever did\nthat cannot now be done better by aeroplane.\n\nThis is something to break the hearts of the Prussian junkers and\nof old-fashioned British army people. The hunt across the English\ncountryside, the preservation of the fox as a sacred animal, the race\nmeeting, the stimulation of betting in all classes of the public; all\nthese things depend ultimately upon the proposition that the \"breed\nof horses\" is of vital importance to the military strength of Great\nBritain. But if the arguments of these able French soldiers are sound,\nthe cult of the horse ceases to be of any more value to England than the\nelegant activities of the Toxophilite Society. Moreover, there has\nbeen a colossal buying of horses for the British army, a tremendous\norganisation for the purchase and supply of fodder, then employment\nof tens of thousands of men as grooms, minders and the like, who would\notherwise have been in the munition factories or the trenches.\n\nTo what possible use can cavalry be put? Can it be used in attack?\nNot against trenches; that is better done by infantrymen following up\ngunfire. Can it be used against broken infantry in the open? Not if the\nenemy has one or two machine guns covering their retreat. Against expose\ninfantry the swooping aeroplane with a machine gun is far more deadly\nand more difficult to hit. Behind it your infantry can follow to receive\nsurrenders; in most circumstances they can come up on cycles if it is\na case of getting up quickly across a wide space. Similarly for\npursuit the use of wire and use of the machine gun have abolished the\npossibility of a pouring cavalry charge. The swooping aeroplane does\neverything that cavalry can do in the way of disorganising the enemy,\nand far more than it can do in the way of silencing machine guns. It can\ncapture guns in retreat much more easily by bombing traction engines\nand coming down low and shooting horses and men. An ideal modern\npursuit would be an advance of guns, automobiles full of infantry, motor\ncyclists and cyclists, behind a high screen of observation aeroplanes\nand a low screen of bombing and fighting aeroplanes. Cavalry _might_\nadvance across fields and so forth, but only as a very accessory part of\nthe general advance....\n\nAnd what else is there for the cavalry to do?\n\nIt may be argued that horses can go over country that is impossible for\nautomobiles. That is to ignore altogether what has been done in this war\nby such devices as caterpillar wheels. So far from cavalry being able to\nnegotiate country where machines would stick and fail, mechanism can now\nride over places where any horse would flounder.\n\nI submit these considerations to the horse-lover. They are not my\noriginal observations; they have been put to me and they have convinced\nme. Except perhaps as a parent of transport mules I see no further part\nhenceforth for the horse to play in war.\n\n\n6\n\nThe form and texture of the coming warfare--if there is still warfare\nto come--are not yet to be seen in their completeness upon the modern\nbattlefield. One swallow does not make a summer, nor a handful of\naeroplanes, a \"Tank\" or so, a few acres of shell craters, and a village\nhere and there, pounded out of recognition, do more than foreshadow\nthe spectacle of modernised war on land. War by these developments has\nbecome the monopoly of the five great industrial powers; it is their\nalternative to end or evolve it, and if they continue to disagree, then\nit must needs become a spectacle of majestic horror such as no man\ncan yet conceive. It has been wise of Mr. Pennell therefore, who has\nrecently been drawing his impressions of the war upon stone, to make\nhis pictures not upon the battlefield, but among the huge industrial\napparatus that is thrusting behind and thrusting up through the war of\nthe gentlemen in spurs. He gives us the splendours and immensities of\nforge and gun pit, furnace and mine shaft. He shows you how great they\nare and how terrible. Among them go the little figures of men, robbed of\nall dominance, robbed of all individual quality. He leaves it for you to\ndraw the obvious conclusion that presently, if we cannot contrive to\nput an end to war, blacknessess like these, enormities and flares\nand towering threats, will follow in the track of the Tanks and come\ntrampling over the bickering confusion of mankind.\n\nThere is something very striking in these insignificant and incidental\nmen that Mr. Pennell shows us. Nowhere does a man dominate in all these\nwonderful pictures. You may argue perhaps that that is untrue to the\nessential realities; all this array of machine and workshop, all this\nmarshalled power and purpose, has been the creation of inventor and\nbusiness organiser. But are we not a little too free with that word\n\"_creation_\"? Falstaff was a \"creation\" perhaps, or the Sistine sibyls;\nthere we have indubitably an end conceived and sought and achieved; but\ndid these inventors and business organisers do more than heed certain\nunavoidable imperatives? Seeking coal they were obliged to mine in a\ncertain way; seeking steel they had to do this and this and not that and\nthat; seeking profit they had to obey the imperative of the economy. So\nlittle did they plan their ends that most of these manufacturers speak\nwith a kind of astonishment of the deadly use to which their works are\nput. They find themselves making the new war as a man might wake out of\nsome drugged condition to find himself strangling his mother.\n\nSo that Mr. Pennell's sketchy and transient human figures seem\naltogether right to me. He sees these forges, workshops, cranes and the\nlike, as inhuman and as wonderful as cliffs or great caves or icebergs\nor the stars. They are a new aspect of the logic of physical necessity\nthat made all these older things, and he seizes upon the majesty and\nbeauty of their dimensions with an entire impartiality. And they are\nas impartial. Through all these lithographs runs one present motif, the\nmotif of the supreme effort of western civilisation to save itself and\nthe world from the dominance of the reactionary German Imperialism of\nmodern science. The pictures are arranged to shape out the life of a\nshell, from the mine to the great gun; nothing remains of their\nhistory to show except the ammunition dump, the gun in action and the\nshell-burst. Upon this theme all these great appearances are strung\nto-day. But to-morrow they may be strung upon some other and nobler\npurpose. These gigantic beings of which the engineer is the master\nand slave, are neither benevolent nor malignant. To-day they produce\ndestruction, they are the slaves of the spur; to-morrow we hope they\nwill bridge and carry and house and help again.\n\nFor that peace we struggle against the dull inflexibility of the German\nWill-to-Power.\n\n\n\n\nV. TANKS\n\n\n1\n\nIt is the British who have produced the \"land ironclad\" since I returned\nfrom France, and used it apparently with very good effect. I felt no\nlittle chagrin at not seeing them there, because I have a peculiar\ninterest in these contrivances. It would be more than human not to\nclaim a little in this matter. I described one in a story in _The Strand\nMagazine_ in 1903, and my story could stand in parallel columns beside\nthe first account of these monsters in action given by Mr. Beach Thomas\nor Mr. Philip Gibbs. My friend M. Joseph Reinach has successfully\npassed off long extracts from my story as descriptions of the Tanks upon\nBritish officers who had just seen them. The filiation was indeed quite\ntraceable. They were my grandchildren--I felt a little like King Lear\nwhen first I read about them. Yet let me state at once that I was\ncertainly not their prime originator. I took up an idea, manipulated\nit slightly, and handed it on. The idea was suggested to me by the\ncontrivances of a certain Mr. Diplock, whose \"ped-rail\" notion, the\nnotion of a wheel that was something more than a wheel, a wheel that\nwould take locomotives up hill-sides and over ploughed fields, was\npublic property nearly twenty years ago. Possibly there were others\nbefore Diplock. To the Ped-rail also Commander Murray Sueter, one of the\nmany experimentalists upon the early tanks, admits his indebtedness,\nand it would seem that Mr. Diplock was actually concerned in the earlier\nstage of the tanks.\n\nSince my return I have been able to see the Tank at home, through the\ncourtesy of the Ministry of Munitions. They have progressed far beyond\nany recognisable resemblance to the initiatives of Mr. Diplock; they\nhave approximated rather to the American caterpillar. As I suspected\nwhen first I heard of these devices, the War Office and the old army\npeople had practically nothing to do with their development. They took\nto it very reluctantly--as they have taken to every novelty in this\nwar. One brilliant general scrawled over an early proposal the entirely\ncharacteristic comment that it was a pity the inventor could not use his\nimagination to better purpose. (That foolish British trick of sneering\nat \"imagination\" has cost us hundreds of thousands of useless casualties\nand may yet lose us the war.) Tanks were first mooted at the front about\na year and a half ago; Mr. Winston Churchill was then asking questions\nabout their practicability; he filled many simple souls with terror;\nthey thought him a most dangerous lunatic. The actual making of the\nTanks arose as an irregular side development of the armoured-car branch\nof the Royal Naval Air Service work. The names most closely associated\nwith the work are (I quote a reply of Dr. Macnamara's in the House of\nCommons) Mr. d'Eyncourt, the Director of Naval Construction, Mr. W. O.\nTritton, Lieut. Wilson, R.N.A.S., Mr. Bussell, Lieut. Stern, R.N.A.S.,\nwho is now Colonel Stern, Captain Symes, and Mr. F. Skeens. There are\nmany other claims too numerous to mention in detail.\n\nBut however much the Tanks may disconcert the gallant Colonel Newcomes\nwho throw an air of restraint over our victorious front, there can be no\ndoubt that they are an important as well as a novel development of the\nmodern offensive. Of course neither the Tanks nor their very obvious\nnext developments going to wrest the decisive pre-eminence from the\naeroplane. The aeroplane remains now more than ever the instrument of\nvictory upon the western front. Aerial ascendancy, properly utilised, is\nvictory. But the mobile armoured big gun and the Tank as a machine-gun\nsilencer must enormously facilitate an advance against the blinded\nenemy. Neither of them can advance against properly aimed big gun fire.\nThat has to be disposed of before they make their entrance. It remains\nthe function of the aeroplane to locate the hostile big guns and\nto direct the _tir de demolition_ upon them before the advance\nbegins--possibly even to bomb them out. But hitherto, after the\ndestruction of driving back of the defender's big guns has been\neffected, the dug-out and the machine gun have still inflicted heavy\nlosses upon the advancing infantry until the fight is won. So soon as\nthe big guns are out, the tanks will advance, destroying machine guns,\ncompleting the destruction of the wire, and holding prisoners immobile.\nThen the infantry will follow to gather in the sheaves.\nMultitudinously produced and--I write it with a defiant eye on Colonel\nNewcome--_properly handled_, these land ironclads are going to do very\ngreat things in shortening the war, in pursuit, in breaking up the\nretreating enemy. Given the air ascendancy, and I am utterly unable to\nimagine any way of conclusively stopping or even greatly delaying an\noffensive thus equipped.\n\n\n2\n\nThe young of even the most horrible beasts have something piquant and\nengaging about them, and so I suppose it is in the way of things that\nthe land ironclad which opens a new and more dreadful and destructive\nphase in the human folly of warfare, should appear first as if it were a\njoke. Never has any such thing so completely masked its wickedness under\nan appearance of genial silliness. The Tank is a creature to which one\nnaturally flings a pet name; the five or six I was shown wandering,\nrooting and climbing over obstacles, round a large field near X, were as\namusing and disarming as a little of lively young pigs.\n\nAt first the War Office prevented the publication of any pictures or\ndescriptions of these contrivances except abroad; then abruptly the\nembargo was relaxed, and the press was flooded with photographs. The\nreader will be familiar now with their appearance. They resemble\nlarge slugs with an underside a little like the flattened rockers of\na rocking-horse, slugs between 20 and 40 feet long. They are like\nflat-sided slugs, slugs of spirit, who raise an enquiring snout, like\nthe snout of a dogfish, into the air. They crawl upon their bellies in\na way that would be tedious to describe to the general reader and\nunnecessary to describe to the enquiring specialists. They go over the\nground with the sliding speed of active snails. Behind them trail two\nwheels, supporting a flimsy tail, wheels that strike one as incongruous\nas if a monster began kangaroo and ended doll's perambulator. (These\nwheels annoy me.) They are not steely monsters; they are painted with\ndrab and unassuming colours that are fashionable in modern warfare, so\nthat the armour seems rather like the integument of a rhinoceros. At the\nsides of the head project armoured checks, and from above these stick\nout guns that look like stalked eyes. That is the general appearance of\nthe contemporary tank.\n\nIt slides on the ground; the silly little wheels that so detract from\nthe genial bestiality of its appearance dandle and bump behind it. It\nswings about its axis. It comes to an obstacle, a low wall let us say,\nor a heap of bricks, and sets to work to climb it with its snout. It\nrears over the obstacle, it raises its straining belly, it overhangs\nmore and more, and at last topples forward; it sways upon the heap and\nthen goes plunging downwards, sticking out the weak counterpoise of its\nwheeled tail. If it comes to a house or a tree or a wall or such-like\nobstruction it rams against it so as to bring all its weight to bear\nupon it--it weighs _some_ tons--and then climbs over the debris. I saw\nit, and incredulous soldiers of experience watched it at the same time,\ncross trenches and wallow amazingly through muddy exaggerations of small\nholes. Then I repeated the tour inside.\n\nAgain the Tank is like a slug. The slug, as every biological student\nknows, is unexpectedly complicated inside. The Tank is as crowded\nwith inward parts as a battleship. It is filled with engines, guns and\nammunition, and in the interstices men.\n\n\"You will smash your hat,\" said Colonel Stern. \"No; keep it on, or else\nyou will smash your head.\"\n\nOnly Mr. C. R. W. Nevinson could do justice to the interior of a Tank.\nYou see a hand gripping something; you see the eyes and forehead of\nan engineer's face; you perceive that an overall bluishness beyond the\nengine is the back of another man. \"Don't hold that,\" says someone; \"it\nis too hot. Hold on to that.\" The engines roar, so loudly that I doubt\nwhether one could hear guns without; the floor begins to slope and\nslopes until one seems to be at forty-five degrees or thereabouts; then\nthe whole concern swings up and sways and slants the other way. You have\ncrossed a bank. You heel sideways. Through the door which has been left\nopen you see the little group of engineers, staff officers and naval men\nreceding and falling away behind you. You straighten up and go up hill.\nYou halt and begin to rotate. Through the open door, the green field,\nwith its red walls, rows of worksheds and forests of chimneys in\nthe background, begins a steady processional movement. The group of\nengineers and officers and naval men appears at the other side of the\ndoor and farther off. Then comes a sprint down hill. You descend and\nstretch your legs.\n\nAbout the field other Tanks are doing their stunts. One is struggling in\nan apoplectic way in the mud pit with a cheek half buried. It noses its\nway out and on with an air of animal relief.\n\nThey are like jokes by Heath Robinson. One forgets that these things\nhave already saved the lives of many hundreds of our soldiers and\nsmashed and defeated thousands of Germans.\n\nSaid one soldier to me: \"In the old attacks you used to see the British\ndead lying outside the machine-gun emplacements like birds outside a\nbutt with a good shot inside. _Now_, these things walk through.\"\n\n\n3\n\nI saw other things that day at X. The Tank is only a beginning in a new\nphase of warfare. Of these other things I may only write in the most\ngeneral terms.\n\nBut though Tanks and their collaterals are being made upon a very\nconsiderable scale in X, already I realised as I walked through gigantic\nforges as high and marvellous as cathedrals, and from workshed to\nworkshed where gun carriages, ammunition carts and a hundred such things\nwere flowing into existence with the swelling abundance of a river that\nflows out of a gorge, that as the demand for the new developments\ngrows clear and strong, the resources of Britain are capable still of\na tremendous response. _If only we do not rob these great factories and\nworks of their men._\n\nUpon this question certain things need to be said very plainly. The\ndecisive factor in the sort of war we are now waging is production and\nright use of mechanical material; victory in this war depends now\nupon three things: the aeroplane, the gun, and the Tank developments.\nThese--and not crowds of men--are the prime necessity for a successful\noffensive. Every man we draw from munition making to the ranks brings\nour western condition nearer to the military condition of Russia. In\nthese things we may be easily misled by military \"experts\" We have to\nremember that the military \"expert\" is a man who learnt his business\nbefore 1914, and that the business of war has been absolutely\nrevolutionised since 1914; the military expert is a man trained to think\nof war as essentially an affair of cavalry, infantry in formation, and\nfield guns, whereas cavalry is entirely obsolete, infantry no longer\nfights in formation, and the methods of gunnery have been entirely\nchanged. The military man I observe still runs about the world in spurs,\nhe travels in trains in spurs, he walks in spurs, he thinks in terms of\nspurs. He has still to discover that it is about as ridiculous as if he\nwere to carry a crossbow. I take it these spurs are only the outward and\nvisible sign of an inward obsolescence. The disposition of the military\n\"expert\" is still to think too little of machinery and to demand too\nmuch of the men. Behind our front at the time of my visit there were,\nfor example, many thousands of cavalry, men tending horses, men engaged\nin transporting bulky fodder for horses and the like. These men were\ndoing about as much in this war as if they had been at Timbuctoo. Every\nman who is taken from munition making at X to spur-worshipping in khaki,\nis a dead loss to the military efficiency of the country. Every man that\nis needed or is likely to be needed for the actual operations of\nmodern warfare can be got by combing out the cavalry, the brewing\nand distilling industries, the theatres and music halls, and the like\nunproductive occupations. The under-staffing of munition works, the\ndiminution of their efficiency by the use of aged and female labour, is\nthe straight course to failure in this war.\n\nIn X, in the forges and machine shops, I saw already too large a\nproportion of boys and grey heads.\n\nWar is a thing that changes very rapidly, and we have in the Tanks only\nthe first of a great series of offensive developments. They are bound to\nbe improved, at a great pace. The method of using them will change very\nrapidly. Any added invention will necessitate the scrapping of old types\nand the production of the new patterns in quantity. It is of supreme\nnecessity to the Allies if they are to win this war outright that the\nlead in inventions and enterprise which the British have won over the\nGermans in this matter should be retained. It is our game now to press\nthe advantage for all it is worth. We have to keep ahead to win. We\ncannot do so unless we have unstinted men and unstinted material to\nproduce each new development as its use is realised.\n\nGiven that much, the Tank will enormously enhance the advantage of the\nnew offensive method on the French front; the method that is of gun\ndemolition after aerial photography, followed by an advance; it is a\nhuge addition to our prospect of decisive victory. What does it do?\nIt solves two problems. The existing Tank affords a means of advancing\nagainst machine-gun fire and of destroying wire and machine guns without\nmuch risk of loss, so soon as the big guns have done their duty by the\nenemy guns. And also behind the Tank itself, it is useless to conceal,\nlies the possibility of bringing up big guns and big gun ammunition,\nacross nearly any sort of country, as fast as the advance can press\nforward. Hitherto every advance has paid a heavy toll to the machine\ngun, and every advance has had to halt after a couple of miles or so\nwhile the big guns (taking five or six days for the job) toiled up to\nthe new positions.\n\n\n4\n\nIt is impossible to restrain a note of sharp urgency from what one has\nto say about these developments. The Tanks remove the last technical\ndifficulties in our way to decisive victory and a permanent peace; they\nalso afford a reason for straining every nerve to bring about a decision\nand peace soon. At the risk of seeming an imaginative alarmist I would\nlike to point out the reasons these things disclose for hurrying this\nwar to a decision and doing our utmost to arrange the world's affairs\nso as to make another war improbable. Already these serio-comic Tanks,\nweighing something over twenty tons or so, have gone slithering around\nand sliding over dead and wounded men. That is not an incident for\nsensitive minds to dwell upon, but it is a mere little child's play\nanticipation of what the big land ironclads _that are bound to come if\nthere is no world pacification_, are going to do.\n\nWhat lies behind the Tank depends upon this fact; there is no definable\nupward limit of mass. Upon that I would lay all the stress possible,\nbecause everything turns upon that.\n\nYou cannot make a land ironclad so big and heavy but that you cannot\nmake a caterpillar track wide enough and strong enough to carry it\nforward. Tanks are quite possible that will carry twenty-inch or\ntwenty-five inch guns, besides minor armament. Such Tanks may be\nundesirable; the production may exceed the industrial resources of\nany empire to produce; but there is no inherent impossibility in such\nthings. There are not even the same limitations as to draught and\ndocking accommodation that sets bounds to the size of battleships. It\nfollows, therefore, as a necessary deduction that if the world's affairs\nare so left at the end of the war that the race of armaments continues,\nthat Tank will develop steadily into a tremendous instrument of warfare,\ndriven by engines of scores of thousands of horse-power, tracking on\na track scores of hundreds of yards wide and weighing hundreds or\nthousands of tons. Nothing but a world agreement not to do so can\nprevent this logical development of the land ironclad. Such a structure\nwill make wheel-ruts scores of feet deep; it will plough up, devastate\nand destroy the country it passes over altogether.\n\nFor my own part I never imagined the land ironclad idea would get loose\ninto war. I thought that the military intelligence was essentially\nunimaginative and that such an aggressive military power as Germany,\ndominated by military people, would never produce anything of the sort.\nI thought that this war would be fought out without Tanks and that then\nwar would come to an end. For of course it is mere stupidity that makes\npeople doubt the ultimate ending of war. I have been so far justified\nin these expectations of mine, that it is not from military sources that\nthese things have come. They have been thrust upon the soldiers from\nwithout. But now that they are loose, now that they are in war, we have\nto face their full possibilities, to use our advantage in them and press\non to the end of the war. In support of a photo-aero directed artillery,\neven our present Tanks can be used to complete an invisible offensive.\nWe shall not so much push as ram. It is doubtful if the Germans can get\nanything of the sort into action before six months are out. We ought to\nget the war on to German soil before the Tanks have grown to more than\nthree or four times their present size. Then it will not matter so much\nhow much bigger they grow. It will be the German landscape that will\nsuffer.\n\nAfter one has seen the actual Tanks it is not very difficult to close\none's eyes and figure the sort of Tank that may be arguing with Germany\nin a few months' time about the restoration of Belgium and Serbia and\nFrance, the restoration of the sunken tonnage, the penalties of the\nvarious Zeppelin and submarine murders, the freedom of seas and land\nalike from piracy, the evacuation of all Poland including Posen and\nCracow, and the guarantees for the future peace of Europe. The machine\nwill be perhaps as big as a destroyer and more heavily armed and\nequipped. It will swim over and through the soil at a pace of ten or\ntwelve miles an hour. In front of it will be corn, land, neat woods,\norchards, pasture, gardens, villages and towns. It will advance upon its\nbelly with a swaying motion, devouring the ground beneath it. Behind it\nmasses of soil and rock, lumps of turf, splintered wood, bits of houses,\noccasional streaks of red, will drop from its track, and it will leave\na wake, six or seven times as wide as a high road, from which all soil,\nall cultivation, all semblance to cultivated or cultivatable land will\nhave disappeared. It will not even be a track of soil. It will be a\ntrack of subsoil laid bare. It will be a flayed strip of nature. In the\ncourse of its fighting the monster may have to turnabout. It will then\nhalt and spin slowly round, grinding out an arena of desolation with\na diameter equal to its length. If it has to retreat and advance again\nthese streaks and holes of destruction will increase and multiply.\nBehind the fighting line these monsters will manoeuvre to and fro,\ndestroying the land for all ordinary agricultural purposes for ages to\ncome. The first imaginative account of the land ironclad that was ever\nwritten concluded with the words, \"They are the _reductio ad absurdum_\nof war.\" They are, and it is to the engineers, the ironmasters, the\nworkers and the inventive talent of Great Britain and France that we\nmust look to ensure that it is in Germany, the great teacher of war,\nthat this demonstration of war's ultimate absurdity is completed.\n\nFor forty years Frankenstein Germany invoked war, turned every\ndevelopment of material and social science to aggressive ends, and at\nlast when she felt the time was ripe she let loose the new monster that\nshe had made of war to cow the spirit of mankind. She set the thing\ntrampling through Belgium. She cannot grumble if at last it comes home,\nstranger and more dreadful even than she made it, trampling the German\ntowns and fields with German blood upon it and its eyes towards Berlin.\n\nThis logical development of the Tank idea may seem a gloomy prospect for\nmankind. But it is open to question whether the tremendous development\nof warfare that has gone on in the last two years does after all open a\nprospect of unmitigated gloom. There has been a good deal of cheap and\ndespondent sneering recently at the phrase, \"The war that will end war.\"\nIt is still possible to maintain that that may be a correct description\nof this war. It has to be remembered that war, as the aeroplane and\nthe Tank have made it, has already become an impossible luxury for any\nbarbaric or uncivilised people. War on the grade that has been achieved\non the Somme predicates an immense industrialism behind it. Of all the\nStates in the world only four can certainly be said to be fully capable\nof sustaining war at the level to which it has now been brought upon the\nwestern front. These are Britain, France, Germany, and the United States\nof America. Less certainly equal to the effort are Italy, Japan, Russia,\nand Austria. These eight powers are the only powers _capable of warfare\nunder modern conditions._ Five are already Allies and one is incurably\npacific. There is no other power or people in the world that can go to\nwar now without the consent and connivance of these great powers. If\nwe consider their alliances, we may count it that the matter rests now\nbetween two groups of Allies and one neutral power. So that while on\nthe one hand the development of modern warfare of which the Tank is the\npresent symbol opens a prospect of limitless senseless destruction, it\nopens on the other hand a prospect of organised world control. This\nTank development must ultimately bring the need of a real permanent\nsettlement within the compass of the meanest of diplomatic\nintelligences. A peace that will restore competitive armaments has now\nbecome a less desirable prospect for everyone than a continuation of the\nwar. Things were bad enough before, when the land forces were still in\na primitive phase of infantry, cavalry and artillery, and when the only\nreal race to develop monsters and destructors was for sea power. But the\nrace for sea power before 1914 was mere child's play to the breeding\nof engineering monstrosities for land warfare that must now follow any\nindeterminate peace settlement. I am no blind believer in the wisdom of\nmankind, but I cannot believe that men are so insensate and headstrong\nas to miss the plain omens of the present situation.\n\nSo that after all the cheerful amusement the sight of a Tank causes may\nnot be so very unreasonable. These things may be no more than one of\nthose penetrating flashes of wit that will sometimes light up and dispel\nthe contentions of an angry man. If they are not that, then they are the\ngrimmest jest that ever set men grinning. Wait and see, if you do not\nbelieve me.\n\n\n\n\nHOW PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THE WAR\n\n\n\n\nI. DO THEY REALLY THINK AT ALL?\n\nAll human affairs are mental affairs; the bright ideas of to-day are the\nrealities of to-morrow. The real history of mankind is the history of\nhow ideas have arisen, how they have taken possession of men's minds,\nhow they have struggled, altered, proliferated, decayed. There is\nnothing in this war at all but a conflict of ideas, traditions, and\nmental habits. The German Will clothed in conceptions of aggression and\nfortified by cynical falsehood, struggles against the fundamental sanity\nof the German mind and the confused protest of mankind. So that the most\npermanently important thing in the tragic process of this war is the\nchange of opinion that is going on. What are people making of it? Is it\nproducing any great common understandings, any fruitful unanimities?\n\nNo doubt it is producing enormous quantities of cerebration, but is it\nanything more than chaotic and futile cerebration? We are told all\nsorts of things in answer to that, things without a scrap of evidence\nor probability to support them. It is, we are assured, turning people to\nreligion, making them moral and thoughtful. It is also, we are assured\nwith equal confidence, turning them to despair and moral disaster. It\nwill be followed by (1) a period of moral renascence, and (2) a debauch.\nIt is going to make the workers (1) more and (2) less obedient and\nindustrious. It is (1) inuring men to war and (2) filling them with a\npassionate resolve never to suffer war again. And so on. I propose now\nto ask what is really happening in this matter? How is human opinion\nchanging? I have opinions of my own and they are bound to colour my\ndiscussion. The reader must allow for that, and as far as possible I\nwill remind him where necessary to make his allowance.\n\nNow first I would ask, is any really continuous and thorough\nmental process going on at all about this war? I mean, is there any\nconsiderable number of people who are seeing it as a whole, taking it in\nas a whole, trying to get a general idea of it from which they can form\ndirecting conclusions for the future? Is there any considerable number\nof people even trying to do that? At any rate let me point out first\nthat there is quite an enormous mass of people who--in spite of the fact\nthat their minds are concentrated on aspects of this war, who are at\npresent hearing, talking, experiencing little else than the war--are\nnevertheless neither doing nor trying to do anything that deserves to\nbe called thinking about it at all. They may even be suffering quite\nterribly by it. But they are no more mastering its causes, reasons,\nconditions, and the possibility of its future prevention than a monkey\nthat has been rescued in a scorching condition from the burning of a\nhouse will have mastered the problem of a fire. It is just happening to\nand about them. It may, for anything they have learnt about it, happen\nto them again.\n\nA vast majority of people are being swamped by the spectacular side of\nthe business. It was very largely my fear of being so swamped myself\nthat made me reluctant to go as a spectator to the front. I knew that my\nchances of being hit by a bullet were infinitesimal, but I was extremely\nafraid of being hit by some too vivid impression. I was afraid that I\nmight see some horribly wounded man or some decayed dead body that would\nso scar my memory and stamp such horror into me as to reduce me to a\nmere useless, gibbering, stop-the-war-at-any-price pacifist. Years ago\nmy mind was once darkened very badly for some weeks with a kind of fear\nand distrust of life through a sudden unexpected encounter one tranquil\nevening with a drowned body. But in this journey in Italy and France,\nalthough I have had glimpses of much death and seen many wounded men,\nI have had no really horrible impressions at all. That side of the\nbusiness has, I think, been overwritten. The thing that haunts me most\nis the impression of a prevalent relapse into extreme untidiness, of\na universal discomfort, of fields, and of ruined houses treated\ndisregardfully.... But that is not what concerns us now in this\ndiscussion. What concerns us now is the fact that this war is producing\nspectacular effects so tremendous and incidents so strange, so\nremarkable, so vivid, that the mind forgets both causes and consequences\nand simply sits down to stare.\n\nFor example, there is this business of the Zeppelin raids in England. It\nis a supremely silly business; it is the most conclusive demonstration\nof the intellectual inferiority of the German to the Western European\nthat is should ever have happened. There was the clearest _a priori_\ncase against the gas-bag. I remember the discussions ten or twelve years\nago in which it was established to the satisfaction of every reasonable\nman that ultimately the \"heavier than air\" machine (as we called it\nthen) must fly better than the gas-bag, and still more conclusively\nthat no gas-bag was conceivable that could hope to fight and defeat\naeroplanes. Nevertheless the German, with that dull faith of his in mere\n\"Will,\" persisted along his line. He knew instinctively that he could\nnot produce aviators to meet the Western European; all his social\ninstincts made him cling to the idea of a great motherly, almost\nsow-like bag of wind above him. At an enormous waste of resources\nGermany has produced these futile monsters, that drift in the darkness\nover England promiscuously dropping bombs on fields and houses. They\nare now meeting the fate that was demonstrably certain ten years ago.\nIf they found us unready for them it is merely that we were unable to\nimagine so idiotic an enterprise would ever be seriously sustained and\npersisted in. We did not believe in the probability of Zeppelin raids\nany more than we believed that Germany would force the world into war.\nIt was a thing too silly to be believed. But they came--to their certain\nfate. In the month after I returned from France and Italy, no less than\nfour of these fatuities were exploded and destroyed within thirty miles\nof my Essex home.... There in chosen phrases you have the truth about\nthese things. But now mark the perversion of thought due to spectacular\neffect.\n\nI find over the Essex countryside, which has been for more than a year\nand a half a highway for Zeppelins, a new and curious admiration for\nthem that has arisen out of these very disasters. Previously they were\nregarded with dislike and a sort of distrust, as one might regard a\nsneaking neighbour who left his footsteps in one's garden at night. But\nthe Zeppelins of Billericay and Potter's Bar are--heroic things. (The\nCuffley one came down too quickly, and the fourth one which came down\nfor its crew to surrender is despised.) I have heard people describe the\ntwo former with eyes shining with enthusiasm.\n\n\"First,\" they say, \"you saw a little round red glow that spread. Then\nyou saw the whole Zeppelin glowing. Oh, it was _beautiful!_ Then it\nbegan to turn over and come down, and it flames and pieces began to\nbreak away. And then down it came, leaving flaming pieces all up the\nsky. At last it was a pillar of fire eight thousand feet high....\nEveryone said, 'Ooooo!' And then someone pointed out the little\naeroplane lit up by the flare--such a leetle thing up there in\nthe night! It is the greatest thing I have ever seen. Oh! the most\nwonderful--most wonderful!\"\n\nThere is a feeling that the Germans really must after all be a splendid\npeople to provide such magnificent pyrotechnics.\n\nSome people in London the other day were pretending to be shocked by an\nAmerican who boasted that he had been in \"two _bully_ bombardments,\"\nbut he was only saying what everyone feels more or less. We are at\na spectacle that--as a spectacle--our grandchildren will envy. I\nunderstand now better the story of the man who stared at the sparks\nraining up from his own house as it burnt in the night and whispered\n\"_Lovely! Lovely!_\"\n\nThe spectacular side of the war is really an enormous distraction from\nthought. And against thought there also fights the native indolence of\nthe human mind. The human mind, it seems, was originally developed to\nthink about the individual; it thinks reluctantly about the species.\nIt takes refuge from that sort of thing if it possibly can. And so\nthe second great preventive of clear thinking is the tranquillising\nplatitude.\n\nThe human mind is an instrument very easily fatigued. Only a few\nexceptions go on thinking restlessly--to the extreme exasperation of\ntheir neighbours. The normal mind craves for decisions, even wrong or\nfalse decisions rather than none. It clutches at comforting falsehoods.\nIt loves to be told, \"_There_, don't you worry. That'll be all right.\nThat's _settled._\" This war has come as an almost overwhelming challenge\nto mankind. To some of us it seems as it if were the Sphynx proffering\nthe alternative of its riddle or death. Yet the very urgency of this\nchallenge to think seems to paralyse the critical intelligence of very\nmany people altogether. They will say, \"This war is going to produce\nenormous changes in everything.\" They will then subside mentally with a\nfeeling of having covered the whole ground in a thoroughly safe manner.\nOr they will adopt an air of critical aloofness. They will say, \"How\nis it possible to foretell what may happen in this tremendous sea of\nchange?\" And then, with an air of superior modesty, they will go on\ndoing--whatever they feel inclined to do. Many others, a degree less\nsimple in their methods, will take some entirely partial aspect, arrive\nat some guesswork decision upon that, and then behave as though that met\nevery question we have to face. Or they will make a sort of admonitory\nforecast that is conditional upon the good behaviour of other people.\n\"Unless the Trade Unions are more reasonable,\" they will say. Or,\n\"Unless the shipping interest is grappled with and controlled.\" Or,\n\"Unless England wakes up.\" And with that they seem to wash their hands\nof further responsibility for the future.\n\nOne delightful form of put-off is the sage remark, \"Let us finish the\nwar first, and then let us ask what is going to happen after it.\" One\nlikes to think of the beautiful blank day after the signing of the peace\nwhen these wise minds swing round to pick up their deferred problems....\n\nI submit that a man has not done his duty by himself as a rational\ncreature unless he has formed an idea of what is going on, as one\ncomplicated process, until he has formed an idea sufficiently definite\nfor him to make it the basis of a further idea, which is his own\nrelationship to that process. He must have some notion of what the\nprocess is going to do to him, and some notion of what he means to do,\nif he can, to the process. That is to say, he must not only have an idea\nhow the process is going, but also an idea of how he wants it to go. It\nseems so natural and necessary for a human brain to do this that it is\nhard to suppose that everyone has not more or less attempted it. But\nfew people, in Great Britain at any rate, have the habit of frank\nexpression, and when people do not seem to have made out any of these\nthings for themselves there is a considerable element of secretiveness\nand inexpressiveness to be allowed for before we decide that they have\nnot in some sort of fashion done so. Still, after all allowances have\nbeen made, there remains a vast amount of jerry-built and ready-made\nborrowed stuff in most of people's philosophies of the war. The systems\nof authentic opinion in this world of thought about the war are like\ncomparatively rare thin veins of living mentality in a vast world of\ndead repetitions and echoed suggestions. And that being the case, it is\nquite possible that history after the war, like history before the war,\nwill not be so much a display of human will and purpose as a resultant\nof human vacillations, obstructions, and inadvertences. We shall still\nbe in a drama of blind forces following the line of least resistance.\n\nOne of the people who is often spoken of as if he were doing an enormous\namount of concentrated thinking is \"the man in the trenches.\" We are\ntold--by gentlemen writing for the most part at home--of the most\nextraordinary things that are going on in those devoted brains, how they\nare getting new views about the duties of labour, religion, morality,\nmonarchy, and any other notions that the gentleman at home happens to\nfancy and wished to push. Now that is not at all the impression of the\nkhaki mentality I have reluctantly accepted as correct. For the most\npart the man in khaki is up against a round of tedious immediate duties\nthat forbid consecutive thought; he is usually rather crowded and not\nvery comfortable. He is bored.\n\nThe real horror of modern war, when all is said and done, is the\nboredom. To get killed our wounded may be unpleasant, but it is at\nany rate interesting; the real tragedy is in the desolated fields, the\ndesolated houses, the desolated hours and days, the bored and desolated\nminds that hang behind the melee and just outside the melee. The\npeculiar beastliness of the German crime is the way the German war cant\nand its consequences have seized upon and paralysed the mental movement\nof Western Europe. Before 1914 war was theoretically unpopular in every\nEuropean country; we thought of it as something tragic and dreadful.\nNow everyone knows by experience that it is something utterly dirty and\ndetestable. We thought it was the Nemean lion, and we have found it\nis the Augean stable. But being bored by war and hating war is quite\nunproductive _unless you are thinking about its nature and causes\nso thoroughly that you will presently be able to take hold of it and\ncontrol it and end it._ It is no good for everyone to say unanimously,\n\"We will have no more war,\" unless you have thought out how to avoid it,\nand mean to bring that end about. It is as if everyone said, \"We will\nhave no more catarrh,\" or \"no more flies,\" or \"no more east wind.\" And\nmy point is that the immense sorrows at home in every European country\nand the vast boredom of the combatants are probably not really producing\nany effective remedial mental action at all, and will not do so unless\nwe get much more thoroughly to work upon the thinking-out process.\n\nIn such talks as I could get with men close up to the front I found\nbeyond this great boredom and attempts at distraction only very\nspecialised talk about changes in the future. Men were keen upon\nquestions of army promotion, of the future of conscription, of the\nfuture of the temporary officer, upon the education of boys in relation\nto army needs. But the war itself was bearing them all upon its way,\nas unquestioned and uncontrolled as if it were the planet on which they\nlived.\n\n\n\n\nII. THE YIELDING PACIFIST AND THE CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR\n\n\n1 Among the minor topics that people are talking about behind the\nwestern fronts is the psychology of the Yielding Pacifist and the\nConscientious Objector. Of course, we are all pacifists nowadays; I know\nof no one who does not want not only to end this war but to put an end\nto war altogether, except those blood-red terrors Count Reventlow, Mr.\nLeo Maxse--how he does it on a vegetarian dietary I cannot imagine!--and\nour wild-eyed desperados of _The Morning Post._ But most of the people\nI meet, and most of the people I met on my journey, are pacifists like\nmyself who want to _make_ peace by beating the armed man until he gives\nin and admits the error of his ways, disarming him and reorganising the\nworld for the forcible suppression of military adventures in the future.\nThey want belligerency put into the same category as burglary, as a\nmatter of forcible suppression. The Yielding Pacifist who will accept\nany sort of peace, and the Conscientious Objector who will not fight at\nall, are not of that opinion.\n\nBoth Italy and France produce parallel types to those latter, but it\nwould seem that in each case England displays the finer developments.\nThe Latin mind is directer than the English, and its standards--shall\nI say?--more primitive; it gets more directly to the fact that here are\nmen who will not fight. And it is less charitable. I was asked quite a\nnumber of times for the English equivalent of an _embusque._ \"We don't\ngeneralise,\" I said, \"we treat each case on its merits!\"\n\nOne interlocutor near Udine was exercised by our Italian Red Cross work.\n\n\"Here,\" he said, \"are sixty or seventy young Englishmen, all fit for\nmilitary service.... Of course they go under fire, but it is not like\nbeing junior officers in the trenches. Not one of them has been killed\nor wounded.\"\n\nHe reflected. \"One, I think, has been decorated,\" he said....\n\nMy French and Italian are only for very rough common jobs; when it came\nto explaining the Conscientious Objector sympathetically they broke\ndown badly. I had to construct long parenthetical explanations of\nour antiquated legislative methods to show how it was that the\n\"conscientious objector\" had been so badly defined. The foreigner does\nnot understand the importance of vague definition in British life.\n\"Practically, of course, we offered to exempt anyone who conscientiously\nobjected to fight or serve. Then the Pacifist and German people started\na campaign to enrol objectors. Of course every shirker, every coward and\nslacker in the country decided at once to be a conscientious objector.\nAnyone but a British legislator could have foreseen that. Then we\nstarted Tribunals to wrangle with the objectors about their _bona\nfides._ Then the Pacifists and the Pro-Germans issued little leaflets\nand started correspondence courses to teach people exactly how to lie to\nthe Tribunals. Trouble about freedom of the pamphleteer followed. I had\nto admit--it has been rather a sloppy business. The people who made the\nlaw knew their own minds, but we English are not an expressive people.\"\n\nThese are not easy things to say in Elementary (and slightly Decayed)\nFrench or in Elementary and Corrupt Italian.\n\n\"But why do people support the sham conscientious objector and issue\nleaflets to help him--when there is so much big work clamouring to be\ndone?\"\n\n\"That,\" I said, \"is the Whig tradition.\"\n\nWhen they pressed me further, I said: \"I am really the questioner. I\nam visiting _your_ country, and you have to tell _me_ things. It is\nnot right that I should do all the telling. Tell me all about Romain\nRolland.\"\n\nAnd so I pressed them about the official socialists in Italy and the\nSocialist minority in France until I got the question out of the net\nof national comparisons and upon a broader footing. In several\nconversations we began to work out in general terms the psychology of\nthose people who were against the war. But usually we could not get to\nthat; my interlocutors would insist upon telling me just what they would\nlike to do or just what they would like to see done to stop-the-war\npacifists and conscientious objectors; pleasant rather than fruitful\nimaginative exercises from which I could effect no more than\nplatitudinous uplifts.\n\nBut the general drift of such talks as did seem to penetrate the\nquestion was this, that among these stop-the-war people there are really\nthree types. First there is a type of person who hates violence and\nthe infliction of pain under any circumstances, and who have a mystical\nbelief in the rightness (and usually the efficacy) of non-resistance.\nThese are generally Christians, and then their cardinal text is the\ninstruction to \"turn the other cheek.\" Often they are Quakers. If they\nare consistent they are vegetarians and wear _Lederlos_ boots. They do\nnot desire police protection for their goods. They stand aloof from all\nthe force and conflict of life. They have always done so. This is an\nunderstandable and respectable type. It has numerous Hindu equivalents.\nIt is a type that finds little difficulty about exemptions--provided the\nindividual has not been too recently converted to his present habits.\nBut it is not the prevalent type in stop-the-war circles. Such genuine\nascetics do not number more than a thousand or so, all three of our\nwestern allied countries. The mass of the stop-the-war people is made up\nquite other elements.\n\n\n2\n\nIn the complex structure of the modern community there are two groups\nor strata or pockets in which the impulse of social obligation, the\ngregarious sense of a common welfare, is at its lowest; one of these is\nthe class of the Resentful Employee, the class of people who, without\nexplanation, adequate preparation or any chance, have been shoved at an\nearly age into uncongenial work and never given a chance to escape, and\nthe other is the class of people with small fixed incomes or with small\nsalaries earnt by routine work, or half independent people practising\nsome minor artistic or literary craft, who have led uneventful,\nirresponsible lives from their youth up, and never came at any point\ninto relations of service to the state. This latter class was more\ndifficult to define than the former--because it is more various within\nitself. My French friends wanted to talk of the \"Psychology of the\nRentier.\" I was for such untranslatable phrases as the \"Genteel Whig,\"\nor the \"Donnish Liberal.\" But I lit up an Italian--he is a Milanese\nmanufacturer--with \"these Florentine English who would keep Italy in a\nglass case.\" \"I know,\" he said. Before I go on to expand this congenial\ntheme, let me deal first with the Resentful Employee, who is a much\nmore considerable, and to me a much more sympathetic, figure in European\naffairs. I began life myself as a Resentful Employee. By the extremest\ngood luck I have got my mind and spirit out of the distortions of that\ncramping beginning, but I can still recall even the anger of those old\ndays.\n\nHe becomes an employee between thirteen and fifteen; he is made to do\nwork he does not like for no other purpose that he can see except the\nprofit and glory of a fortunate person called his employer, behind whom\nstand church and state blessing and upholding the relationship. He is\nnot allowed to feel that he has any share whatever in the employer's\nbusiness, or that any end is served but the employer's profit. He cannot\nsee that the employer acknowledges any duty to the state. Neither church\nnor state seems to insist that the employer has any public function.\nAt no point does the employee come into a clear relationship of mutual\nobligation with the state. There does not seem to be any way out for the\nemployee from a life spent in this subordinate, toilsome relationship.\nHe feels put upon and cheated out of life. He is without honour. If\nhe is a person of ability or stubborn temper he struggles out of his\nposition; if he is a kindly and generous person he blames his \"luck\" and\ndoes his work and lives his life as cheerfully as possible--and so live\nthe bulk of our amazing European workers; if he is a being of great\nmagnanimity he is content to serve for the ultimate good of the race; if\nhe has imagination, he says, \"Things will not always be like this,\"\nand becomes a socialist or a guild socialist, and tries to educate the\nemployer to a sense of reciprocal duty; but if he is too human for any\nof these things, then he begins to despise and hate the employer and the\nsystem that made him. He wants to hurt them. Upon that hate it is easy\nto trade.\n\nA certain section of what is called the Socialist press and the\nSocialist literature in Europe is no doubt great-minded; it seeks to\ncarve a better world out of the present. But much of it is socialist\nonly in name. Its spirit is Anarchistic. Its real burthen is not\nconstruction but grievance; it tells the bitter tale of the employee, it\nfeeds and organises his malice, it schemes annoyance and injury for the\nhated employer. The state and the order of the world is confounded with\nthe capitalist. Before the war the popular so-called socialist press\nreeked with the cant of rebellion, the cant of any sort of rebellion.\n\"I'm a rebel,\" was the silly boast of the young disciple. \"Spoil\nsomething, set fire to something,\" was held to be the proper text for\nany girl or lad of spirit. And this blind discontent carried on into\nthe war. While on the one hand a great rush of men poured into the army\nsaying, \"Thank God! we can serve our country at last instead of some\nbeastly profiteer,\" a sourer remnant, blind to the greater issues of\nthe war, clung to the reasonless proposition, \"the state is only for\nthe Capitalist. This war is got up by Capitalists. Whatever has to be\ndone--_we are rebels._\"\n\nSuch a typical paper as the British _Labour Leader_, for example, may\nbe read in vain, number after number, for any sound and sincere\nconstructive proposal. It is a prolonged scream of extreme\nindividualism, a monotonous repetition of incoherent discontent with\nauthority, with direction, with union, with the European effort. It\nwants to do nothing. It just wants effort to stop--even at the price of\nGerman victory. If the whole fabric of society in western Europe were to\nbe handed over to those pseudo-socialists to-morrow, to be administered\nfor the common good, they would fly the task in terror. They would make\nexcuses and refuse the undertaking. They do not want the world to go\nright. The very idea of the world going right does not exist in their\nminds. They are embodied discontent and hatred, making trouble, and that\nis all they are. They want to be \"rebels\"--to be admired as \"rebels\".\n\nThat is the true psychology of the Resentful Employee. He is a\nde-socialised man. His sense of the State has been destroyed.\n\nThe Resentful Employees are the outcome of our social injustices. They\nare the failures of our social ad educational systems. We may regret\ntheir pitiful degradation, we may exonerate them from blame; none the\nless they are a pitiful crew. I have seen the hardship of the trenches,\nthe gay and gallant wounded. I do a little understand what our soldiers,\nofficers and men alike, have endured and done. And though I know I ought\nto allow for all that I have stated, I cannot regard these conscientious\nobjectors with anything but contempt. Into my house there pours a dismal\nliterature rehearsing the hardships of these men who set themselves\nup to be martyrs for liberty; So and So, brave hero, has been sworn\nat--positively sworn at by a corporal; a nasty rough man came into\nthe cell of So and So and dropped several h's; So and So, refusing to\nundress and wash, has been undressed and washed, and soap was rubbed\ninto his eyes--perhaps purposely; the food and accommodation are not of\nthe best class; the doctors in attendance seem hasty; So and So was put\ninto a damp bed and has got a nasty cold. Then I recall a jolly vanload\nof wounded men I saw out there....\n\nBut after all, we must be just. A church and state that permitted\nthese people to be thrust into dreary employment in their early 'teens,\nwithout hope or pride, deserves such citizens as these. The marvel\nis that there are so few. There are a poor thousand or so of these\nhopeless, resentment-poisoned creatures in Great Britain. Against five\nwilling millions. The Allied countries, I submit, have not got nearly\nall the conscientious objectors they deserve.\n\n\n3\n\nIf the Resentful Employee provides the emotional impulse of the\nresisting pacifist, whose horizon is bounded by his one passionate\ndesire that the particular social system that has treated him so ill\nshould collapse and give in, and its leaders and rulers be humiliated\nand destroyed, the intellectual direction of a mischievous pacifism\ncomes from an entirely different class.\n\nThe Genteel Whig, though he differs very widely in almost every other\nrespect from the Resentful Employee, has this much in common, that he\nhas never been drawn into the whirl of collective life in any real and\nassimilative fashion. This is what is the matter with both of them.\nHe is a little loose, shy, independent person. Except for eating and\ndrinking--in moderation, he has never done anything real from the day\nhe was born. He has frequently not even faced the common challenge of\nmatrimony. Still more frequently is he childless, or the daring parent\nof one particular child. He has never traded nor manufactured. He has\ndrawn his dividends or his salary with an entire unconsciousness of any\nobligations to policemen or navy for these punctual payments. Probably\nhe has never ventured even to reinvest his little legacy. He is acutely\naware of possessing an exceptionally fine intelligence, but he is\nentirely unconscious of a fundamental unreality. Nothing has ever\noccurred to him to make him ask why the mass of men were either not\npossessed of his security or discontented with it. The impulses that\ntook his school friends out upon all sorts of odd feats and adventures\nstruck him as needless. As he grew up he turned with an equal distrust\nfrom passion or ambition. His friends went out after love, after\nadventure, after power, after knowledge, after this or that desire, and\nbecame men. But he noted merely that they became fleshly, that effort\nstrained them, that they were sometimes angry or violent or heated. He\ncould not but feel that theirs were vulgar experiences, and he sought\nsome finer exercise for his exceptional quality. He pursued art or\nphilosophy or literature upon their more esoteric levels, and realised\nmore and more the general vulgarity and coarseness of the world about\nhim, and his own detachment. The vulgarity and crudity of the things\nnearest him impressed him most; the dreadful insincerity of the Press,\nthe meretriciousness of success, the loudness of the rich, the baseness\nof common people in his own land. The world overseas had by comparison\na certain glamour. Except that when you said \"United States\" to him he\nwould draw the air sharply between his teeth and beg you not to...\n\nNobody took him by the collar and shook him.\n\nIf our world had considered the advice of William James and insisted\nupon national service from everyone, national service in the drains or\nthe nationalised mines or the nationalised deep-sea fisheries if not\nin the army or navy, we should not have had any such men. If it had\ninsisted that wealth and property are no more than a trust for the\npublic benefit, we should have had no genteel indispensables. These\ndiscords in our national unanimity are the direct consequence of our bad\nsocial organisation. We permit the profiteer and the usurer; they evoke\nthe response of the Reluctant Employee, and the inheritor of their\nwealth becomes the Genteel Whig.\n\nBut that is by the way. It was of course natural and inevitable that the\nGerman onslaught upon Belgium and civilisation generally should strike\nthese recluse minds not as a monstrous ugly wickedness to be resisted\nand overcome at any cost, but merely as a nerve-racking experience. Guns\nwere going off on both sides. The Genteel Whig was chiefly conscious\nof a repulsive vast excitement all about him, in which many people did\ninelegant and irrational things. They waved flags--nasty little flags.\nThis child of the ages, this last fruit of the gigantic and tragic tree\nof life, could no more than stick its fingers in its ears as say,\n\"Oh, please, do _all_ stop!\" and then as the strain grew intenser and\nintenser set itself with feeble pawings now to clamber \"Au-dessus de la\nMelee,\" and now to--in some weak way--stop the conflict. (\"Au-dessus\nde la Melee\"--as the man said when they asked him where he was when the\nbull gored his sister.) The efforts to stop the conflict at any price,\neven at the price of entire submission to the German Will, grew more\nurgent as the necessity that everyone should help against the German\nThing grew more manifest.\n\nOf all the strange freaks of distressed thinking that this war has\nproduced, the freaks of the Genteel Whig have been among the most\nremarkable. With an air of profound wisdom he returns perpetually to\nhis proposition that there are faults on both sides. To say that is his\nconception of impartiality. I suppose that if a bull gored his sister he\nwould say that there were faults on both sides; his sister ought not\nto have strayed into the field, she was wearing a red hat of a highly\nprovocative type; she ought to have been a cow and then everything would\nhave been different. In the face of the history of the last forty years,\nthe Genteel Whig struggles persistently to minimise the German outrage\nupon civilisation and to find excuses for Germany. He does this, not\nbecause he has any real passion for falsehood, but because by training,\ncircumstance, and disposition he is passionately averse from action\nwith the vulgar majority and from self-sacrifice in a common cause, and\nbecause he finds in the justification of Germany and, failing that, in\nthe blackening of the Allies to an equal blackness, one line of defence\nagainst the wave of impulse that threatens to submerge his private\nself. But when at last that line is forced he is driven back upon others\nequally extraordinary. You can often find simultaneously in the same\nPacifist paper, and sometimes even in the utterances of the same writer,\ntwo entirely incompatible statements. The first is that Germany is so\ninvincible that it is useless to prolong the war since no effort of the\nAllies is likely to produce any material improvement in their position,\nand the second is that Germany is so thoroughly beaten that she is now\nready to abandon militarism and make terms and compensations entirely\nacceptable to the countries she has forced into war. And when finally\nfacts are produced to establish the truth that Germany, though still\nlargely wicked and impenitent, is being slowly and conclusively beaten\nby the sanity, courage and persistence of the Allied common men, then\nthe Genteel Whig retorts with his last defensive absurdity. He invents a\nnational psychology for Germany. Germany, he invents, loves us and wants\nto be our dearest friend. Germany has always loved us. The Germans are\na loving, unenvious people. They have been a little mislead--but nice\npeople do not insist upon that fact. But beware of beating Germany,\nbeware of humiliating Germany; then indeed trouble will come. Germany\nwill begin to dislike us. She will plan a revenge. Turning aside from\nher erstwhile innocent career, she may even think of hate. What are our\nobligations to France, Italy, Serbia and Russia, what is the happiness\nof a few thousands of the Herero, a few millions of the Belgians--whose\nnumbers moreover are constantly diminishing--when we might weigh them\nagainst the danger, the most terrible danger, of incurring _permanent\nGerman hostility?..._\n\nA Frenchman I talked to knew better than that. \"What will happen to\nGermany,\" I asked, \"if we are able to do so to her and so; would she\ntake to dreams of a _Revanche?_\"\n\n\"She will take to Anglomania,\" he said, and added after a flash of\nreflection, \"In the long run it will be the worse for you.\"\n\n\n\n\nIII. THE RELIGIOUS REVIVAL\n\n\n1\n\nOne of the indisputable things about the war, so far as Britain and\nFrance go--and I have reason to believe that on a lesser scale things\nare similar in Italy--is that it has produced a very great volume of\nreligious thought and feeling. About Russia in these matters we hear\nbut little at the present time, but one guesses at parallelism. People\nhabitually religious have been stirred to new depths of reality and\nsincerity, and people are thinking of religion who never thought of\nreligion before. But as I have already pointed out, thinking and feeling\nabout a matter is of no permanent value unless something is _thought\nout_, unless there is a change of boundary or relationship, and it an\naltogether different question to ask whether any definite change is\nresulting from this universal ferment. If it is not doing so, then the\nsleeper merely dreams a dream that he will forget again....\n\nNow in no sort of general popular mental activity is there so much froth\nand waste as in religious excitements. This has been the case in all\nperiods of religious revival. The number who are rather impressed, who\nfor a few days or weeks take to reading their Bibles or going to a new\nplace of worship or praying or fasting or being kind and unselfish, is\nalways enormous in relation to the people whose lives are permanently\nchanged. The effort needed if a contemporary is to blow off the froth,\nis always very considerable.\n\nAmong the froth that I would blow off is I think most of the tremendous\nefforts being made in England by the Anglican church to attract\nfavourable attention to itself _apropos_ of the war. I came back from\nmy visit to the Somme battlefields to find the sylvan peace of Essex\ninvaded by a number of ladies in blue dresses adorned with large\nwhite crosses, who, regardless of the present shortage of nurses, were\nvisiting every home in the place on some mission of invitation whose\ndetails remained obscure. So far as I was able to elucidate this\nproject, it was in the nature of a magic incantation; a satisfactory end\nof the war was to be brought about by convergent prayer and religious\nassiduities. The mission was shy of dealing with me personally, although\nas a lapsed communicant I should have thought myself a particularly\nhopeful field for Anglican effort, and it came to my wife and myself\nmerely for our permission and countenance in an appeal to our domestic\nservants. My wife consulted the household; it seemed very anxious to\nescape from that appeal, and as I respect Christianity sufficiently\nto detest the identification of its services with magic processes, the\nmission retired--civilly repulsed. But the incident aroused an uneasy\ncuriosity in my mind with regard to the general trend of Anglican\nteaching and Anglican activities at the present time. The trend of my\nenquiries is to discover the church much more incoherent and much less\nreligious--in any decent sense of the word--than I had supposed it to\nbe.\n\nOrganisation is the life of material and the death of mental and\nspiritual processes. There could be no more melancholy exemplification\nof this than the spectacle of the Anglican and Catholic churches at the\npresent time, one using the tragic stresses of war mainly for pew-rent\ntouting, and the other paralysed by its Austrian and South German\npolitical connections from any clear utterance upon the moral issues of\nthe war. Through the opening phases of the war the Established Church\nof England was inconspicuous; this is no longer the case, but it may be\ndoubted whether the change is altogether to its advantage. To me this\nis a very great disappointment. I have always had a very high opinion of\nthe intellectual values of the leading divines of both the Anglican and\nCatholic communions. The self-styled Intelligentsia of Great Britain\nis all too prone to sneer at their equipment; but I do not see how\nany impartial person can deny that Father Bernard Vaughn is in mental\nenergy, vigour of expression, richness of thought and variety of\ninformation fully the equal of such an influential lay publicist as\nMr. Horatio Bottomley. One might search for a long time among prominent\nlaymen to find the equal of the Bishop of London. Nevertheless it is\nimpossible to conceal the impression of tawdriness that this latter\ngentleman's work as head of the National Mission has left upon my mind.\nAttired in khaki he has recently been preaching in the open air to the\npeople of London upon Tower Hill, Piccadilly, and other conspicuous\nplaces. Obsessed as I am by the humanities, and impressed as I have\nalways been by the inferiority of material to moral facts, I would\nwillingly have exchanged the sight of two burning Zeppelins for this\nspectacle of ecclesiastical fervour. But as it is, I am obliged to trust\nto newspaper reports and the descriptions of hearers and eye-witnesses.\nThey leave to me but little doubt of the regrettable superficiality of\nthe bishop's utterances.\n\nWe have a multitude of people chastened by losses, ennobled by a common\neffort, needing support in that effort, perplexed by the reality of evil\nand cruelty, questioning and seeking after God. What does the National\nMission offer? On Tower Hill the bishop seems to have been chiefly busy\nwith a wrangling demonstration that ten thousand a year is none too\nbig a salary for a man subject to such demands and expenses as his\nsee involves. So far from making anything out of his see he was, he\ndeclared, two thousand a year to the bad. Some day, when the church\nhas studied efficiency, I suppose that bishops will have the leisure\nto learn something about the general state of opinion and education in\ntheir dioceses. The Bishop of London was evidently unaware of the almost\nautomatic response of the sharp socialists among his hearers. Their\nfirst enquiry would be to learn how he came by that mysterious extra two\nthousand a year with which he supplemented his stipend. How did he earn\n_that?_ And if he didn't earn it---! And secondly, they would probably\nhave pointed out to him that his standard of housing, clothing, diet and\nentertaining was probably a little higher than theirs. It is really no\nproof of virtuous purity that a man's expenditure exceeds his income.\nAnd finally some other of his hearers were left unsatisfied by his\nsilence with regard to the current proposal to pool all clerical\nstipends for the common purposes of the church. It is a reasonable\nproposal, and if bishops must dispute about stipends instead of\npreaching the kingdom of God, then they are bound to face it. The sooner\nthey do so, the more graceful will the act be. From these personal\napologetics the bishop took up the question of the exemption, at the\nrequest of the bishops, of the clergy from military service. It is\none of our contrasts with French conditions--and it is all to the\ndisadvantage of the British churches.\n\nIn his Piccadilly contribution to the National Mission of Repentance and\nHope the bishop did not talk politics but sex. He gave his hearers the\nsort of stuff that is handed out so freely by the Cinema Theatres, White\nSlave Traffic talk, denunciations of \"Night Hawks\"--whatever \"Night\nHawks\" may be--and so on. One this or another occasion the bishop--he\nboasts that he himself is a healthy bachelor--lavished his eloquence\nupon the Fall in the Birth Rate, and the duty of all married people,\nfrom paupers upward, to have children persistently. Now sex, like diet,\nis a department of conduct and a very important department, but _it\nisn't religion!_ The world is distressed by international disorder, by\nthe monstrous tragedy of war; these little hot talks about indulgence\nand begetting have about as much to do with the vast issues that concern\nus as, let us say, a discussion of the wickedness of eating very new and\nindigestible bread. It is talking round and about the essential issue.\nIt is fogging the essential issue, which is the forgotten and neglected\nkingship of God. The sin that is stirring the souls of men is the sin of\nthis war. It is the sin of national egotism and the devotion of men to\nloyalties, ambitions, sects, churches, feuds, aggressions, and divisions\nthat are an outrage upon God's universal kingdom.\n\n\n2\n\nThe common clergy of France, sharing the military obligations and the\nfood and privations of their fellow parishioners, contrast very vividly\nwith the home-staying types of the ministries of the various British\nchurches. I met and talked to several. Near Frise there were some barge\ngunboats--they have since taken their place in the fighting, but then\nthey were a surprise--and the men had been very anxious to have their\ncraft visited and seen. The priest who came after our party to see if\nhe could still arrange that, had been decorated for gallantry. Of course\nthe English too have their gallant chaplains, but they are men of the\nofficer caste, they are just young officers with peculiar collars; not\nmen among men, as are the French priests.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the behaviour of the French priests in this\nwar has enormously diminished anti-clerical bitterness in France. There\ncan be no doubt that France is far more a religious country than it\nwas before the war. But if you ask whether that means any return to the\nchurch, any reinstatement of the church, the answer is a doubtful\none. Religion and the simple priest are stronger in France to-day; the\nchurch, I think, is weaker.\n\nI trench on no theological discussion when I record the unfavourable\nimpression made upon all western Europe by the failure of the Holy\nFather to pronounce definitely upon the rights and wrongs of the war.\nThe church has abrogated its right of moral judgement. Such at least\nseemed to be the opinion of the Frenchmen with whom I discussed a\nremarkable interview with Cardinal Gasparri that I found one morning in\n_Le Journal._\n\nIt was not the sort of interview to win the hearts of men who were ready\nto give their lives to set right what they believe to be the greatest\noutrage that has ever been inflicted upon Christendom, that is to\nsay the forty-three years of military preparation and of diplomacy by\nthreats that culminated in the ultimatum to Serbia, the invasion of\nBelgium and the murder of the Vise villagers. It was adorned with a\nlarge portrait of \"Benoit XV.,\" looking grave and discouraging over his\nspectacles, and the headlines insisted it was \"_La Pensee du Pape._\"\nCross-heads sufficiently indicated the general tone. One read:\n\n_\"Le Saint Siege impartial... Au-dessus de la bataille....\"_ The good\nCardinal would have made a good lawyer. He had as little to say about\nGod and the general righteousness of things as the Bishop of London. But\nhe got in some smug reminders of the severance of diplomatic relations\nwith the Vatican. Perhaps now France will be wiser. He pointed out\nthat the Holy See in its Consistorial Allocution of January 22nd, 1915,\ninvited the belligerents to observe the rules of war. Could anything\nmore be done than that? Oh!--in the general issue of the war, if you\nwant a judgement on the war as a whole, how is it possible that the\nVatican to decide? Surely the French know that excellent principle of\njustice, _Audiatur et altera pars_, and how under existing circumstances\ncan the Vatican do that...? The Vatican is cut off from communication\nwith Austria and Germany. The Vatican has been deprived of its temporal\npower and local independence (another neat point)....\n\nSo France is bowed out. When peace is restored, the Vatican will perhaps\nbe able to enquire if there was a big German army in 1914, if German\ndiplomacy was aggressive from 1875 onward, if Belgium was invaded\nunrighteously, if (Catholic) Austria forced the pace upon (non-Catholic)\nRussia. But now--now the Holy See must remain as impartial as an\nunbought mascot in a shop window....\n\nThe next column of _Le Journal_ contained an account of the Armenian\nmassacres; the blood of the Armenian cries out past the Holy Father to\nheaven; but then Armenians are after all heretics, and here again the\nprinciple of _Audiatur et altera pars_ comes in. Communications are not\nopen with the Turks. Moreover, Armenians, like Serbs, are worse than\ninfidels; they are heretics. Perhaps God is punishing them....\n\n_Audiatur et altera pars_, and the Vatican has not forgotten the\ninfidelity and disrespect of both France and Italy in the past. These\nare the things, it seems, that really matter to the Vatican. Cardinal\nGasparri's portrait, in the same issue of _Le Journal_, displays a\ncountenance of serene contentment, a sort of incarnate \"Told-you-so.\"\n\nSo the Vatican lifts its pontifical skirts and shakes the dust of\nwestern Europe off its feet.\n\nIt is the most astounding renunciation in history.\n\nIndubitably the Christian church took a wide stride from the kingship of\nGod when it placed a golden throne for the unbaptised Constantine in\nthe midst of its most sacred deliberations at Nicaea. But it seems to\nme that this abandonment of moral judgements in the present case by the\nHoly See is an almost wider step from the church's allegiance to God....\n\n\n3\n\nThought about the great questions of life, thought and reasoned\ndirection, this is what the multitude demands mutely and weakly, and\nwhat the organised churches are failing to give. They have not the\ncourage of their creeds. Either their creeds are intellectual flummery\nor they are the solution to the riddles with which the world is\nstruggling. But the churches make no mention of their creeds. They\nchatter about sex and the magic effect of church attendance and simple\nfaith. If simple faith is enough, the churches and their differences are\nan imposture. Men are stirred to the deepest questions about life and\nGod, and the Anglican church, for example, obliges--as I have described.\n\nIt is necessary to struggle against the unfavourable impression made by\nthese things. They must not blind us to the deeper movement that is in\nprogress in a quite considerable number of minds in England and France\nalike towards the realisation of the kingdom of God.\n\nWhat I conceive to be the reality of the religious revival is to be\nfound in quarters remote from the religious professionals. Let me give\nbut one instance of several that occur to me. I met soon after my return\nfrom France a man who has stirred my curiosity for years, Mr. David\nLubin, the prime mover in the organisation of the International\nInstitute of Agriculture in Rome. It is a movement that has always\nappealed to my imagination. The idea is to establish and keep up to date\na record of the food supplies in the world with a view to the ultimate\nworld control of food supply and distribution. When its machinery has\ndeveloped sufficiently to a control in the interests of civilisation of\nmany other staples besides foodstuffs. It is in fact the suggestion and\nbeginning of the economic world peace and the economic world state, just\nas the Hague Tribunal is the first faint sketch of a legal world state.\nThe King of Italy has met Mr. Lubin's idea with open hands. (It was\nbecause of this profoundly interesting experiment that in a not very\nwidely known book of mine, _The World Set Free_ (May, 1914), in which I\nrepresented a world state as arising out of Armageddon, I made the\nfirst world conference meet at Brissago in Italian Switzerland under the\npresidency of the King of Italy.) So that when I found I could meet Mr.\nLubin I did so very gladly. We lunched together in a pretty little room\nhigh over Knightsbridge, and talked through an afternoon.\n\nHe is a man rather after the type of Gladstone; he could be made to look\nlike Gladstone in a caricature, and he has that compelling quality of\nintense intellectual excitement which was one of the great factors in\nthe personal effectiveness of Gladstone. He is a Jew, but until I had\ntalked to him for some time that fact did not occur to me. He is in very\nill health, he has some weakness of the heart that grips him and holds\nhim at times white and silent.\n\nAt first we talked of his Institute and its work. Then we came to\nshipping and transport. Whenever one talks now of human affairs one\ncomes presently to shipping and transport generally. In Paris, in Italy,\nwhen I returned to England, everywhere I found \"cost of carriage\"\nwas being discovered to be a question of fundamental importance. Yet\ntransport, railroads and shipping, these vitally important services in\nthe world's affairs, are nearly everywhere in private hands and run\nfor profit. In the case of shipping they are run for profit on such\nantiquated lines that freights vary from day to day and from hour to\nhour. It makes the business of food supply a gamble. And it need not be\na gamble.\n\nBut that is by the way in the present discussion. As we talked, the\nprospect broadened out from a prospect of the growing and distribution\nof food to a general view of the world becoming one economic community.\n\nI talked of various people I had been meeting in the previous few weeks.\n\"So many of us,\" I said, \"seem to be drifting away from the ideas of\nnationalism and faction and policy, towards something else which is\nlarger. It is an idea of a right way of doing things for human purposes,\nindependently of these limited and localised references. Take such\nthings as international hygiene for example, take _this_ movement. We\nare feeling our way towards a bigger rule.\"\n\n\"The rule of Righteousness,\" said Mr. Lubin.\n\nI told him that I had been coming more and more to the idea--not as a\nsentimentality or a metaphor, but as the ruling and directing idea, the\nstructural idea, of all one's political and social activities--of the\nwhole world as one state and community and of God as the King of that\nstate.\n\n\"But _I_ say that,\" cried Mr. Lubin, \"I have put my name to that.\nAnd--it is _here!_\"\n\nHe struggled up, seized an Old Testament that lay upon a side table.\nHe stood over it and rapped its cover. \"It is _here_,\" he said, looking\nmore like Gladstone than ever, \"in the Prophets.\"\n\n\n4\n\nThat is all I mean to tell at present of that conversation.\n\nWe talked of religion for two hours. Mr. Lubin sees things in terms of\nIsrael and I do not. For all that we see things very much after the same\nfashion. That talk was only one of a number of talks about religion\nthat I have had with hard and practical men who want to get the world\nstraighter than it is, and who perceive that they must have a leadership\nand reference outside themselves. That is why I assert so confidently\nthat there is a real deep religious movement afoot in the world. But\nnot one of those conversations could have gone on, it would have ceased\ninstantly, if anyone bearing the uniform and brand of any organised\nreligious body, any clergyman, priest, mollah, of suchlike advocate of\nthe ten thousand patented religions in the world, had come in. He would\nhave brought in his sectarian spites, his propaganda of church-going,\nhis persecution of the heretic and the illegitimate, his ecclesiastical\npolitics, his taboos, and his doctrinal touchiness.... That is why,\nthough I perceive there is a great wave of religious revival in the\nworld to-day, I doubt whether it bodes well for the professional\nreligions....\n\nThe other day I was talking to an eminent Anglican among various other\npeople and someone with an eye to him propounded this remarkable view.\n\n\"There are four stages between belief and utter unbelief. There are\nthose who believe in God, those who doubt like Huxley the Agnostic,\nthose who deny him like the Atheists but who do at least keep his place\nvacant, and lastly those who have set up a Church in his place. That is\nthe last outrage of unbelief.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV. THE RIDDLE OF THE BRITISH\n\n\nAll the French people I met in France seemed to be thinking and talking\nabout the English. The English bring their own atmosphere with them;\nto begin with they are not so talkative, and I did not find among\nthem anything like the same vigour of examination, the same resolve to\nunderstand the Anglo-French reaction, that I found among the French.\nIn intellectual processes I will confess that my sympathies are\nundisguisedly with the French; the English will never think nor talk\nclearly until the get clerical \"Greek\" and sham \"humanities\" out of\ntheir public schools and sincere study and genuine humanities in; our\ndisingenuous Anglican compromise is like a cold in the English head,\nand the higher education in England is a training in evasion. This is\nan always lamentable state of affairs, but just now it is particularly\nlamentable because quite tremendous opportunities for the good of\nmankind turn on the possibility of a thorough and entirely frank mutual\nunderstanding between French, Italians, and English. For years there\nhas been a considerable amount of systematic study in France of English\nthought and English developments. Upon almost any question of current\nEnglish opinion and upon most current English social questions, the\nbest studies are in French. But there has been little or no reciprocal\nactivity. The English in France seem to confine their French studies to\n_La Vie Parisienne._ It is what they have been led to expect of French\nliterature.\n\nThere can be no doubt in any reasonable mind that this war is binding\nFrance and England very closely together. They dare not quarrel for the\nnext fifty years. They are bound to play a central part in the World\nLeague for the Preservation of Peace that must follow this struggle.\nThere is no question of their practical union. It is a thing that must\nbe. But it is remarkable that while the French mind is agog to apprehend\nevery fact and detail it can about the British, to make the wisest\nand fullest use of our binding necessities, that strange English\n\"incuria\"--to use the new slang--attains to its most monumental in this\nmatter.\n\nSo there is not much to say about how the British think about the\nFrench. They do not think. They feel. At the outbreak of the war, when\nthe performance of France seemed doubtful, there was an enormous feeling\nfor France in Great Britain; it was like the formless feeling one has\nfor a brother. It was as if Britain had discovered a new instinct. If\nFrance had crumpled up like paper, the English would have fought on\npassionately to restore her. That is ancient history now. Now the\nEnglish still feel fraternal and fraternally proud; but in a mute way\nthey are dazzled. Since the German attack on Verdun began, the French\nhave achieved a crescendo. None of us could have imagined it. It did not\nseem possible to very many of us at the end of 1915 that either France\nor Germany could hold on for another year. There was much secret\nanxiety for France. It has given place now to unstinted confidence and\nadmiration. In their astonishment the British are apt to forget the\nimpressive magnitude of their own effort, the millions of soldiers, the\ninnumerable guns, the endless torrent of supplies that pour into France\nto avenge the little army of Mons. It seems natural to us that we should\nso exert ourselves under the circumstances. I suppose it is wonderful,\nbut, as a sample Englishman, I do not feel that it is at all wonderful.\nI did not feel it wonderful even when I saw the British aeroplanes\nlording it in the air over Martinpuich, and not a German to be seen.\nSince Michael would have it so, there, at last, they were.\n\nThere was a good deal of doubt in France about the vigour of the British\neffort, until the Somme offensive. All that had been dispelled in August\nwhen I reached Paris. There was not the shadow of a doubt remaining\nanywhere of the power and loyalty of the British. These preliminary\nassurances have to be made, because it is in the nature of the French\nmind to criticise, and it must not be supposed that criticisms of detail\nand method affect the fraternity and complete mutual confidence which is\nthe stuff of the Anglo-French relationship.\n\n\n2\n\nNow first the French have been enormously astonished by the quality of\nthe ordinary British soldiers in our new armies. One Colonial colonel\nsaid something almost incredible to me--almost incredible as coming\nas from a Frenchman; it was a matter to solemn for any compliments or\npolite exaggerations; he said in tones of wonder and conviction, \"_They\nare as good as ours._\" It was his acme of all possible praise.\n\nThat means any sort of British soldier. Unless he is assisted by a kilt\nthe ordinary Frenchman is unable to distinguish between one sort of\nBritish soldier and another. He cannot tell--let the ardent nationalist\nmark the fact!--a Cockney from an Irishman or the Cardiff from the Essex\nnote. He finds them all extravagantly and unquenchably cheerful and with\na generosity--\"like good children.\" There his praise is a little tinged\nby doubt. The British are reckless--recklessness in battle a Frenchman\ncan understand, but they are also reckless about to-morrow's bread and\nwhether the tent is safe against a hurricane in the night. He is struck\ntoo by the fact that they are much more vocal than the French troops,\nand that they seem to have a passion for bad lugubrious songs. There he\nsmiles and shrugs his shoulders, and indeed what else can any of us\ndo in the presence of that mystery? At any rate the legend of the\n\"phlegmatic\" Englishman has been scattered to the four winds of heaven\nby the guns of the western front. The men are cool in action, it is\ntrue; but for the rest they are, by the French standards, quicksilver.\n\nBut I will not expand further upon the general impression made by the\nEnglish in France. Philippe Millet's _En Liaison avec les Anglais_ gives\nin a series of delightful pictures portraits of British types from the\nFrench angle. There can be little doubt that the British quality, genial\nnaive, plucky and generous, has won for itself a real affection in\nFrance wherever it has had a chance to display itself....\n\nBut when it comes to British methods then the polite Frenchman's\ndifficulties begin. Translating hints into statements and guessing at\nreservations, I would say that the French fall very short of admiration\nof the way in which our higher officers set about their work, they\nare disagreeably impressed by a general want of sedulousness and close\nmethod in our leading. They think we economise brains and waste\nblood. They are shocked at the way in which obviously incompetent or\ninefficient men of the old army class are retained in their positions\neven after serious failures, and they were profoundly moved by the bad\nstaff work and needlessly heavy losses of our opening attacks in July.\nThey were ready to condone the blunderings and flounderings of the 1915\noffensive as the necessary penalties of an \"amateur\" army, they had had\nto learn their own lesson in Champagne, but they were surprised to\nfind how much the British had still to learn in July, 1916. The British\nofficers excuse themselves because, they plead, they are still\namateurs. \"That is no reason,\" says the Frenchman, \"why they should be\namateurish.\"\n\nNo Frenchman said as much as this to me, but their meaning was as plain\nas daylight. I tackled one of my guides on this matter; I said that it\nwas the plain duty of the French military people to criticise British\nmilitary methods sharply if they thought they were wrong. \"It is not\neasy,\" he said. \"Many British officers do not think they have anything\nto learn. And English people do not like being told things. What could\nwe do? We could hardly send a French officer or so to your headquarters\nin a tutorial capacity. You have to do things in your own way.\" When\nI tried to draw General Castelnau into this dangerous question by\nsuggesting that we might borrow a French general or so, he would say\nonly, \"There is only one way to learn war, and that is to make war.\"\nWhen it was too late, in the lift, I thought of the answer to that.\nThere is only one way to make war, and that is by the sacrifice of\nincapables and the rapid promotion of able men. If old and tried types\nfail now, new types must be sought. But to do that we want a standard of\nefficiency. We want a conception of intellectual quality in performance\nthat is still lacking....\n\nM. Joseph Reinach, in whose company I visited the French part of the\nSomme front, was full of a scheme, which he has since published, for the\nbreaking up and recomposition of the French and British armies into a\nseries of composite armies which would blend the magnificent British\nmanhood and material with French science and military experience. He\npointed out the endless advantages of such an arrangement; the stimulus\nof emulation, the promotion of intimate fraternal feeling between the\npeoples of the two countries. \"At present,\" he said, \"no Frenchman ever\nsees an Englishman except at Amiens or on the Somme. Many of them still\nhave no idea of what the English are doing....\"\n\n\"Have I ever told you the story of compulsory Greek at Oxford and\nCambridge?\" I asked abruptly.\n\n\"What has that to do with it?\"\n\n\"Or how two undistinguished civil service commissioners can hold up the\nscientific education of our entire administrative class?\"\n\nM. Reinach protested further.\n\n\"Because you are proposing to loosen the grip of a certain narrow and\nlimited class upon British affairs, and you propose it as though it were\na job as easy as rearranging railway fares or sending a van to Calais.\nThat is the problem that every decent Englishman is trying to solve\nto-day, every man of that Greater Britain which has supplied these five\nmillion volunteers, these magnificent temporary officers and all this\nwealth of munitions. And the oligarchy is so invincibly fortified! Do\nyou think it will let in Frenchmen to share its controls? It will\nnot even let in Englishmen. It holds the class schools; the class\nuniversities; the examinations for our public services are its class\nshibboleths; it is the church, the squirearchy, the permanent army\nclass, permanent officialdom; it makes every appointment, it is the\nfountain of honour; what it does not know is not knowledge, what it\ncannot do must not be done. It rules India ignorantly and obstructively;\nit will wreck the empire rather than relinquish its ascendancy in\nIreland. It is densely self-satisfied and instinctively monopolistic. It\nis on our backs, and with it on our backs we common English must bleed\nand blunder to victory.... And you make this proposal!\"\n\n\n3\n\nThe antagonistic relations of the Anglican oligarchy with the greater\nand greater-spirited Britain that thrust behind it in this war\nare probably paralleled very closely in Germany, probably they are\nexaggerated in Germany with a bigger military oligarchy and a relatively\nlesser civil body under it. This antagonism is the oddest outcome of the\ntremendous _de-militarisation_ of war that has been going on. In France\nit is probably not so marked because of the greater flexibility and\nadaptability of the French culture.\n\nAll military people--people, that is, professionally and primarily\nmilitary--are inclined to be conservative. For thousands of years the\nmilitary tradition has been a tradition of discipline. The conception of\nthe common soldier has been a mechanically obedient, almost dehumanised\nman, of the of officer a highly trained autocrat. In two years all this\nhas been absolutely reversed. Individual quality, inventive organisation\nand industrialism will win this war. And no class is so innocent of\nthese things as the military caste. Long accustomed as they are to the\nimportance of moral effect they put a brave face upon the business;\nthey save their faces astonishingly, but they are no longer guiding and\ndirecting this war, they are being pushed from behind by forces they\nnever foresaw and cannot control. The aeroplanes and great guns have\nbolted with them, the tanks begotten of naval and civilian wits, shove\nthem to victory in spite of themselves.\n\nWherever I went behind the British lines the officers were going about\nin spurs. These spurs at last got on my nerves. They became symbolical.\nThey became as grave an insult to the tragedy of the war as if they were\nfalse noses. The British officers go for long automobile rides in spurs.\nThey walk about the trenches in spurs. Occasionally I would see a horse;\nI do not wish to be unfair in this matter, there were riding horses\nsometimes within two or three miles of the ultimate front, but they were\nrarely used.\n\nI do not say that the horse is entirely obsolescent in this war. In\nwas nothing is obsolete. In the trenches men fight with sticks. In the\nPasubio battle the other day one of the Alpini silenced a machine gun\nby throwing stones. In the West African campaign we have employed troops\narmed with bows and arrows, and they have done very valuable work. But\nthese are exceptional cases. The military use of the horse henceforth\nwill be such an exceptional case. It is ridiculous for these spurs still\nto clink about the modern battlefield. What the gross cost of the spurs\nand horses and trappings of the British army amount to, and how many men\nare grooming and tending horses who might just as well be ploughing\nand milking at home, I cannot guess; it must be a total so enormous as\nseriously to affect the balance of the war.\n\nAnd these spurs and their retention are only the outward and visible\nsymbol of the obstinate resistance of the Anglican intelligence to\nthe clear logic of the present situation. It is not only the external\nequipment of our leaders that falls behind the times; our political\nand administrative services are in the hands of the same desolatingly\ninadaptable class. The British are still wearing spurs in Ireland; they\nare wearing them in India; and the age of the spur has passed. At the\noutset of this war there was an absolute cessation of criticism of the\nmilitary and administrative castes; it is becoming a question whether\nwe may not pay too heavily in blundering and waste, in military and\neconomic lassitude, in international irritation and the accumulation of\nfuture dangers in Ireland, Egypt, India, and elsewhere, for an apparent\nabsence of internal friction. These people have no gratitude for tacit\nhelp, no spirit of intelligent service, and no sense of fair play to the\noutsider. The latter deficiency indeed they call _esprit de corps_ and\nprize it as if it were a noble quality.\n\nIt becomes more and more imperative that the foreign observer should\ndistinguish between this narrower, older official Britain and\nthe greater newer Britain that struggles to free itself from the\nentanglement of a system outgrown. There are many Englishmen who would\nlike to say to the French and Irish and the Italians and India, who\nindeed feel every week now a more urgent need of saying, \"Have patience\nwith us.\" The Riddle of the British is very largely solved if you will\nthink of a great modern liberal nation seeking to slough an exceedingly\ntough and tight skin....\n\nNothing is more illuminating and self-educational than to explain one's\nhome politics to an intelligent foreigner enquirer; it strips off all\nthe secondary considerations, the allusiveness, the merely tactical\nconsiderations, the allusiveness, the merely tactical considerations.\nOne sees the forest not as a confusion of trees but as something with\na definite shape and place. I was asked in Italy and in France, \"Where\ndoes Lord Northcliffe come into the British system--or Lloyd George?\nWho is Mr. Redmond? Why is Lloyd George a Minister, and why does not\nMr. Redmond take office? Isn't there something called an ordnance\ndepartment, and why is there a separate ministry of munitions? Can Mr.\nLloyd George remove an incapable general?...\"\n\nI found it M. Joseph Reinach particularly penetrating and persistent.\nIt is an amusing but rather difficult exercise to recall what I tried\nto convey to him by way of a theory of Britain. He is by no means an\nuncritical listener. I explained that there is an \"inner Britain,\"\nofficial Britain, which is Anglican or official Presbyterian, which at\nthe outside in the whole world cannot claim to speak for twenty million\nAnglican or Presbyterian communicants, which monopolises official\npositions, administration and honours in the entire British empire,\ndominates the court, and, typically, is spurred and red-tabbed. (It was\njust at this time that the spurs were most on my nerves.)\n\nThis inner Britain, I went on to explain, holds tenaciously to its\npositions of advantage, from which it is difficult to dislodge it\nwithout upsetting the whole empire, and it insists upon treating\nthe rest of the four hundred millions who constitute that empire as\noutsiders, foreigners, subject races and suspected persons.\n\n\"To you,\" I said, \"it bears itself with an appearance of faintly\nhostile, faintly contemptuous apathy. It is still so entirely insular\nthat it shudders at the thought of the Channel Tunnel. This is the\nBritain which irritates and puzzles you so intensely--that you are quite\nunable to conceal these feelings from me. Unhappily it is the Britain\nyou see most of. Well, outside this official Britain is 'Greater\nBritain'--the real Britain with which you have to reckon in the\nfuture.\" (From this point a faint flavour of mysticism crept into\nmy dissertation. I found myself talking with something in my voice\ncuriously reminiscent of those liberal Russians who set themselves to\nexplain the contrasts and contradictions of \"official\" Russia and \"true\"\nRussia.) \"This Greater Britain,\" I asserted, \"is in a perpetual conflict\nwith official Britain, struggling to keep it up to its work, shoving it\ntowards its ends, endeavouring in spite of its tenacious mischievousness\nof the privileged to keep the peace and a common aim with the French and\nIrish and Italians and Russians and Indians. It is to that outer Britain\nthat those Englishmen you found so interesting and sympathetic, Lloyd\nGeorge and Lord Northcliffe, for example, belong. It is the Britain of\nthe great effort, the Britain of the smoking factories and the torrent\nof munitions, the Britain of the men and subalterns of the new armies,\nthe Britain which invents and thinks and achieves, and stands now\nbetween German imperialism and the empire of the world. I do not want to\nexaggerate the quality of greater Britain. If the inner set are narrowly\neducated, the outer set if often crudely educated. If the inner set is\nso close knit as to seem like a conspiracy, the outer set is so\nloosely knit as to seem like a noisy confusion. Greater Britain is only\nbeginning to realise itself and find itself. For all its crudity there\nis a giant spirit in it feeling its way towards the light. It has quite\nother ambitions for the ending of the war than some haggled treaty of\nalliance with France and Italy; some advantage that will invalidate\nGerman competition; it begins to realise newer and wider sympathies,\npossibilities of an amalgamation of interests and community of aim that\nis utterly beyond the habits of the old oligarchy to conceive, beyond\nthe scope of that tawdry word 'Empire' to express....\"\n\nI descended from my rhetoric to find M. Reinach asking how and when this\ngreater Britain was likely to become politically effective.\n\n\n\n\nV. THE SOCIAL CHANGES IN PROGRESS\n\n\n1\n\n\"Nothing will be the same after the war.\" This is one of the consoling\nplatitudes with which people cover over voids of thought. They utter\nit with an air of round-eyed profundity. But to ask in reply, \"Then how\nwill things be different?\" is in many cases to rouse great resentment.\nIt is almost as rude as saying, \"Was that thought of yours really a\nthought?\"\n\nLet us in this chapter confine ourselves to the social-economic\nprocesses that are going on. So far as I am able to distinguish among\nthe things that are being said in these matters, they may be classified\nout into groups that centre upon several typical questions. There is\nthe question of \"How to pay for the war?\" There is the question of the\nbehaviour of labour after the war. \"Will there be a Labour Truce or a\nviolent labour struggle?\" There is the question of the reconstruction of\nEuropean industry after the war in the face of an America in a state\nof monetary and economic repletion through non-intervention. My present\npurpose in this chapter is a critical one; it is not to solve problems\nbut to set out various currents of thought that are flowing through\nthe general mind. Which current is likely to seize upon and carry human\naffairs with it, is not for our present speculation.\n\nThere seem to be two distinct ways of answering the first of the\nquestions I have noted. They do not necessarily contradict each other.\nOf course the war is being largely paid for immediately out of the\naccumulated private wealth of the past. We are buying off the \"hold-up\"\nof the private owner upon the material and resources we need, and paying\nin paper money and war loans. This is not in itself an impoverishment of\nthe community. The wealth of individuals is not the wealth of nations;\nthe two things may easily be contradictory when the rich man's wealth\nconsists of land or natural resources or franchises or privileges the\nuse of which he reluctantly yields for high prices. The conversion of\nheld-up land and material into workable and actively used material in\nexchange for national debt may be indeed a positive increase in the\nwealth of the community. And what is happening in all the belligerent\ncountries is the taking over of more and more of the realities of wealth\nfrom private hands and, in exchange, the contracting of great masses of\ndebt to private people. The nett tendency is towards the disappearance\nof a reality holding class and the destruction of realities in warfare,\nand the appearance of a vast _rentier_ class in its place. At the end\nof the war much material will be destroyed for evermore, transit, food\nproduction and industry will be everywhere enormously socialised, and\nthe country will be liable to pay every year in interest, a sum of money\nexceeding the entire national expenditure before the war. From the point\nof view of the state, and disregarding material and moral damages, that\nannual interest is the annual instalment of the price to be paid for the\nwar.\n\nNow the interesting question arises whether these great belligerent\nstates may go bankrupt, and if so to what extent. States may go bankrupt\nto the private creditor without repudiating their debts or seeming to\npay less to him. They can go bankrupt either by a depreciation of their\ncurrency or--without touching the gold standard--through a rise in\nprices. In the end both these things work out to the same end; the\ncreditor gets so many loaves or pairs of boots or workman's hours of\nlabour for his pound _less_ than he would have got under the previous\nconditions. One may imagine this process of price (and of course wages)\nincrease going on to a limitless extent. Many people are inclined to\nlook to such an increase in prices as a certain outcome of the war, and\njust so far as it goes, just so far will the burthen of the _rentier_\nclass, their call, tat is, for goods and services, be lightened. This\nexpectation is very generally entertained, and I can see little reason\nagainst it. The intensely stupid or dishonest \"labour\" press, however,\nwhich in the interests of the common enemy misrepresents socialism and\nseeks to misguide labour in Great Britain, ignores these considerations,\nand positively holds out this prospect of rising prices as an alarming\none to the more credulous and ignorant of its readers.\n\nBut now comes the second way of meeting the after-the-war obligations.\nThis second way is by increasing the wealth of the state and by\nincreasing the national production to such an extent that the payment of\nthe _rentier_ class will not be an overwhelming burthen. Rising prices\nbilk the creditor. Increased production will check the rise in prices\nand get him a real payment. The outlook for the national creditor seems\nto be that he will be partly bilked and partly paid; how far he will be\nbilked and how far depends almost entirely upon this possible increase\nin production; and there is consequently a very keen and quite\nunprecedented desire very widely diffused among intelligent and active\npeople, holding War Loan scrip and the like, in all the belligerent\ncountries, to see bold and hopeful schemes for state enrichment pushed\nforward. The movement towards socialism is receiving an impulse from a\nnew and unexpected quarter, there is now a _rentier_ socialism, and it\nis interesting to note that while the London _Times_ is full of schemes\nof great state enterprises, for the exploitation of Colonial state\nlands, for the state purchase and wholesaling of food and many natural\nproducts, and for the syndication of shipping and the great staple\nindustries into vast trusts into which not only the British but the\nFrench and Italian governments may enter as partners, the so-called\nsocialist press of Great Britain is chiefly busy about the draughts in\nthe cell of Mr. Fenner Brockway and the refusal of Private Scott\nDuckers to put on his khaki trousers. _The New Statesman_ and the Fabian\nSociety, however, display a wider intelligence.\n\nThere is a great variety of suggestions for this increase of public\nwealth and production. Many of them have an extreme reasonableness. The\nextent to which they will be adopted depends, no doubt, very largely\nupon the politician and permanent official, and both these classes are\nprone to panic in the presence of reality. In spite of its own interests\nin restraining a rise in prices, the old official \"salariat\" is likely\nto be obstructive to any such innovations. It is the resistance of spurs\nand red tabs to military innovations over again. This is the resistance\nof quills and red tape. On the other hand the organisation of Britain\nfor war has \"officialised\" a number of industrial leaders, and created\na large body of temporary and adventurous officials. They may want\nto carry on into peace production the great new factories the war has\ncreated. At the end of the war, for example, every belligerent country\nwill be in urgent need of cheap automobiles for farmers, tradesmen, and\nindustrial purposes generally, America is now producing such automobiles\nat a price of eighty pounds. But Europe will be heavily in debt to\nAmerica, her industries will be disorganised, and there will therefore\nbe no sort of return payment possible for these hundreds of thousands of\nautomobiles. A country that is neither creditor nor producer cannot be\nan importer. Consequently though those cheap tin cars may be stacked\nas high as the Washington Monument in America, they will never come to\nEurope. On the other hand the great shell factories of Europe will be\nstanding idle and ready, their staffs disciplined and available, for\nconversion to the new task. The imperative common sense of the position\nseems to be that the European governments should set themselves straight\naway to out-Ford Ford, and provide their own people with cheap road\ntransport.\n\nBut here comes in the question whether this common-sense course is\ninevitable. Suppose the mental energy left in Europe after the war is\ninsufficient for such a constructive feat as this. There will certainly\nbe the obstruction of official pedantry, the hold-up of this vested\ninterest and that, the greedy desire of \"private enterprise\" to exploit\nthe occasion upon rather more costly and less productive lines, the\ngeneral distrust felt by ignorant and unimaginative people of a new way\nof doing things. The process after all may not get done in the obviously\nwise way. This will not mean that Europe will buy American cars. It will\nbe quite unable to buy American cars. It will be unable to make anything\nthat America will not be able to make more cheaply for itself. But it\nwill mean that Europe will go on without cheap cars, that is to say\nit will go on a more sluggishly and clumsily and wastefully at a lower\neconomic level. Hampered transport means hampered production of other\nthings, and in increasing inability to buy abroad. And so we go down and\ndown.\n\nIt does not follow that because a course is the manifestly right and\nadvantageous course for the community that it will be taken. I am\nreminded of this by a special basket in my study here, into which I\npitch letters, circulars, pamphlets and so forth as they come to hand\nfrom a gentleman named Gattie, and his friends Mr. Adrian Ross, Mr. Roy\nHorniman, Mr. Henry Murray and others. His particular project is the\nconstruction of a Railway Clearing House for London. It is an absolutely\nadmirable scheme. It would cut down the heavy traffic in the streets of\nLondon to about one-third; it would enable us to run the goods traffic\nof England with less than half the number of railway trucks we now\nemploy; it would turn over enormous areas of valuable land from their\npresent use as railway goods yards and sidings; it would save time\nin the transit of goods and labour in their handling. It is a quite\nbeautifully worked out scheme. For the last eight or ten years this\ngroup of devoted fanatics has been pressing this undertaking upon an\nindifferent country with increasing vehemence and astonishment at that\nindifference. The point is that its adoption, though it would be of\ngeneral benefit, would be of no particular benefit to any leading man\nor highly placed official. On the other hand it would upset all sorts\nof individuals who are in a position to obstruct it quietly--and they\ndo so. Meaning no evil. I dip my hand in the accumulation and extract\na leaflet by the all too zealous Mr. Murray. In it he denounces various\npublic officials by name as he cheats and scoundrels, and invites a\nprosecution for libel.\n\nIn that fashion nothing will ever get done. There is no prosecution,\nbut for all that I do not agree with Mr. Murray about the men he names.\nThese gentlemen are just comfortable gentlemen, own brothers to these\nold generals of ours who will not take off their spurs. They are\nprobably quite charming people except that they know nothing of that\nFear of God which searches by heart. Why should they bother?\n\nSo many of these after-the-war problems bring one back to the\nquestion of how far the war has put the Fear of God into the hearts of\nresponsible men. There is really no other reason in existence that I\ncan imagine why they should ask themselves the question, \"Have I done my\nbest?\" and that still more important question, \"Am I doing my best now?\"\nAnd so while I hear plenty of talk about the great reorganisations that\nare to come after the war, while there is the stir of doubt among the\n_rentiers_ whether, after all, they will get paid, while the unavoidable\nstresses and sacrifices of the war are making many people question the\nrightfulness of much that they did as a matter of course, and of much\nthat they took for granted, I perceive there is also something dull\nand not very articulate in this European world, something resistant and\ninert, that is like the obstinate rolling over of a heavy sleeper after\nhe has been called upon to get up. \"Just a little longer.... Just for\n_my_ time.\"\n\nOne thought alone seems to make these more intractable people anxious.\nI thrust it in as my last stimulant when everything else has failed.\n\"There will be _frightful_ trouble with labour after the war,\" I say.\n\nThey try to persuade themselves that military discipline is breaking in\nlabour....\n\n\n2\n\nWhat does British labour think of the outlook after the war?\n\nAs a distinctive thing British labour does not think. \"Class-conscious\nlabour,\" as the Marxists put it, scarcely exists in Britain. The only\nconvincing case I ever met was a bath-chairman of literary habits\nEastbourne. The only people who are, as a class, class-conscious in\nthe British community are the Anglican gentry and their fringe of the\ngenteel. Everybody else is \"respectable.\" The mass of British workers\nfind their thinking in the ordinary halfpenny papers or in _John Bull._\nThe so-called labour papers are perhaps less representative of British\nLabour than any other section of the press; the _Labour Leader_, for\nexample, is the organ of such people as Bertrand Russell, Vernon Lee,\nMorel, academic _rentiers_ who know about as much as of the labour side\nof industrialism as they do of cock-fighting. All the British peoples\nare racially willing and good-tempered people, quite ready to be led\nby those they imagine to be abler than themselves. They make the most\ncheerful and generous soldiers in the whole world, without insisting\nupon that democratic respect which the Frenchman exacts. They do not\ncriticise and they do not trouble themselves much about the general plan\nof operations, so long as they have confidence in the quality and good\nwill of their leading. But British soldiers will of their loading. But\nBritish soldiers will hiss a general when they think he is selfish,\nunfeeling, or a muff. And the socialist propaganda has imported ideas\nof public service into private employment. Labour in Britain has been\ngrowing increasingly impatient of bad or selfish industrial leadership.\nLabour trouble in Great Britain turns wholly upon the idea crystallised\nin the one word \"profiteer.\" Legislation and regulation of hours of\nlabour, high wages, nothing will keep labour quiet in Great Britain if\nlabour thinks it is being exploited for private gain.\n\nLabour feels very suspicious of private gain. For that suspicion a\ncertain rather common type of employer is mainly to blame. Labour\nbelieves that employers is mainly to blame. Labour believes that\nemployers as a class cheat workmen as a class, plan to cheat them of\ntheir full share in the common output, and drive hard bargains. It\nbelieves that private employers are equally ready to sacrifice the\nwelfare of the nation and the welfare of the workers for mere personal\nadvantage. It has a traditional experience to support these suspicions.\n\nIn no department of morals have ideas changed so completely during the\nlast eight years as in relation to \"profits\". Eighty years ago everyone\nbelieved in the divine right of property to do what it pleased its\nadvantages, a doctrine more disastrous socially than the divine right\nof kings. There was no such sense of the immorality of \"holding up\" as\npervades the public conscience to-day. The worker was expected not only\nto work, but to be grateful for employment. The property owner held his\nproperty and handed it out for use and development or not, just as he\nthought fit. These ideas are not altogether extinct today. Only a few\ndays ago I met a magnificent old lady of seventy nine or eighty, who\ndiscoursed upon the wickedness of her gardener in demanding another\nshilling a week because of war prices.\n\nShe was a valiant and handsome personage. A face that had still a\nhealthy natural pinkness looked out from under blond curls, and an\nelegant and carefully tended hand tossed back some fine old lace to\ngesticulate more freely. She had previously charmed her hearers by\nsweeping aside certain rumours that were drifting about.\n\n\"Germans invade _Us!_\" she cried. \"Who'd _let_ 'em, I'd like to know?\nWho'd _let_ 'em?\"\n\nAnd then she reverted to her grievance about the gardener.\n\n\"I told him that after the war he'd be glad enough to get anything.\nGrateful! They'll all be coming back after the war--all of 'em, glad\nenough to get anything. Asking for another shilling indeed!\"\n\nEveryone who heard her looked shocked. But that was the tone of everyone\nof importance in the dark years that followed the Napoleonic wars.\nThat is just one survivor of the old tradition. Another is Blight\nthe solicitor, who goes about bewailing the fact that we writers are\n\"holding out false hopes of higher agricultural wages after the war.\"\nBut these are both exceptions. They are held to be remarkable people\neven by their own class. The mass of property owners and influential\npeople in Europe to-day no more believe in the sacred right of property\nto hold up development and dictate terms than do the more intelligent\nworkers. The ideas of collective ends and of the fiduciary nature of\nproperty, had been soaking through the European community for years\nbefore the war. The necessity for sudden and even violent co-operations\nand submersions of individuality in a common purpose, is rapidly\ncrystallising out these ideas into clear proposals.\n\nWar is an evil thing, but most people who will not learn from reason\nmust have an ugly teacher. This war has brought home to everyone the\nsupremacy of the public need over every sort of individual claim.\n\nOne of the most remarkable things in the British war press is the amount\nof space given to the discussion of labour developments after the war.\nThis in its completeness peculiar to the British situation. Nothing on\nthe same scale is perceptible in the press of the Latin allies. A great\nmovement on the part of capitalists and business organisers is manifest\nto assure the worker of a change of heart and a will to change method.\nLabour is suspicious, not foolishly but wisely suspicious. But labour is\nconsidering it.\n\n\"National industrial syndication,\" say the business organisers.\n\n\"Guild socialism,\" say the workers.\n\nThere is also a considerable amount of talking and writing about\n\"profit-sharing\" and about giving the workers a share in the business\ndirection. Neither of these ideas appeals to the shrewder heads among\nthe workers. So far as direction goes their disposition is to ask\nthe captain to command the ship. So far as profits go, they think the\ncaptain has no more right than the cabin boy to speculative gains; he\nshould do his work for his pay whether it is profitable or unprofitable\nwork. There is little balm for labour discontent in these schemes for\nmaking the worker also an infinitesimal profiteer.\n\nDuring my journey in Italy and France I met several men who were keenly\ninterested in business organisation. Just before I started my friend N,\nwho has been the chief partner in the building up of a very big and very\nextensively advertised American business, came to see me on his way back\nto America. He is as interested in his work as a scientific specialist,\nand as ready to talk about it to any intelligent and interested\nhearer. He was particularly keen upon the question of continuity in the\nbusiness, when it behoves the older generation to let in the younger\nto responsible management and to efface themselves. He was a man of\nfive-and-forty. Incidentally he mentioned that he had never taken\nanything for his private life out of the great business he had built up\nbut a salary, \"a good salary,\" and that now he was gong to grant himself\na pension. \"I shan't interfere any more. I shall come right away and\nlive in Europe for a year so as not to be tempted to interfere. The boys\nhave got to run it some day, and they had better get their experience\nwhile they're young and capable of learning by it. I did.\"\n\nI like N's ideas. \"Practically,\" I said, \"you've been a public official.\nYou've treated your business like a public service.\"\n\nThat was his idea.\n\n\"Would you mind if it was a public service?\"\n\nHe reflected, and some disagreeable memory darkened his face. \"Under the\npoliticians?\" he said.\n\nI took the train of thought N had set going abroad with me next day. I\nhad the good luck to meet men who were interesting industrially. Captain\nPirelli, my guide in Italy, has a name familiar to every motorist; his\nname goes wherever cars go, spelt with a big long capital P. Lieutenant\nde Tessin's name will recall one of the most interesting experiments\nin profit-sharing to the student of social science. I tried over N's\nproblem on both of them. I found in both their minds just the same\nattitude as he takes up towards his business. They think any businesses\nthat are worthy of respect, the sorts of businesses that interest them,\nare public functions. Money-lenders and speculators, merchants and\ngambling gentlefolk may think in terms of profit; capable business\ndirectors certainly do nothing of the sort.\n\nI met a British officer in France who is also a landowner. I got him to\ntalk about his administrative work upon his property. He was very keen\nupon new methods. He said he tried to do his duty by his land.\n\n\"How much land?\" I asked.\n\n\"Just over nine thousand acres,\" he said.\n\n\"But you could manage forty or fifty thousand with little more trouble.\"\n\n\"If I had it. In some ways it would be easier.\"\n\n\"What a waste!\" I said. \"Of course you ought not to _own_ these acres;\nwhat you ought to be is the agricultural controller of just as big an\nestate of the public lands as you could manage--with a suitable salary.\"\n\nHe reflected upon that idea. He said he did not get much of a salary\nout of his land as it was, and made a regrettable allusion to Mr. Lloyd\nGeorge. \"When a man tries to do his duty by his land,\" he said...\n\nBut here running through the thoughts of the Englishman and the Italian\nand the Frenchman and the American alike one finds just the same idea\nof a kind of officialdom in ownership. It is an idea that pervades our\nthought and public discussion to-day everywhere, and it is an idea that\nis scarcely traceable at all in the thought of the early half of the\nnineteenth century. The idea of service and responsibility in property\nhas increased and is increasing, the conception of \"hold-up,\" the\nusurer's conception of his right to be bought out of the way, fades.\nAnd the process has been enormously enhanced by the various big-scale\nexperiments in temporary socialism that have been forced upon the\nbelligerent powers. Men of the most individualistic quality are being\neducated up to the possibilities of concerted collective action. My\nfriend and fellow-student Y, inventor and business organiser, who used\nto make the best steam omnibuses in the world, and who is now making all\nsorts of things for the army, would go pink with suspicious anger at the\nmere words \"inspector\" or \"socialism\" three or four years ago. He does\nnot do so now.\n\nA great proportion of this sort of man, this energetic directive sort\nof man in England, is thinking socialism to-day. They may not be saying\nsocialism, but they are thinking it. When labour begins to realise what\nis adrift it will be divided between two things: between appreciative\nco-operation, for which guild socialism in particular has prepared its\nmind, and traditional suspicion. I will not over to guess here which\nwill prevail.\n\n\n3\n\nThe impression I have of the present mental process in the European\ncommunities is that while the official class and the _rentier_ class\nis thinking very poorly and inadequately and with a merely obstructive\ndisposition; while the churches are merely wasting their energies in\nfutile self-advertisement; while the labour mass is suspicious and\ndisposed to make terms for itself rather than come into any large\nschemes of reconstruction that will abolish profit as a primary aim in\neconomic life, there is still a very considerable movement towards such\na reconstruction. Nothing is so misleading as a careless analogy. In the\ndead years that followed the Napoleonic wars, which are often quoted as\na precedent for expectation now, the spirit of collective service\nwas near its minimum; it was never so strong and never so manifestly\nspreading and increasing as it is to-day.\n\nBut service to what?\n\nI have my own very strong preconceptions here, and since my temperament\nis sanguine they necessarily colour my view. I believe that this impulse\nto collective service can satisfy itself only under the formula that\nmankind is one state of which God is the undying king, and that the\nservice of men's collective needs is the true worship of God. But\neagerly as I would grasp at any evidence that this idea is being\ndeveloped and taken up by the general consciousness, I am quite unable\nto persuade myself that anything of the sort is going on. I do perceive\na search for large forms into which the prevalent impulse to devotion\ncan be thrown. But the organised religious bodies, with their creeds\nand badges and their instinct for self-preservation at any cost,\nstand between men and their spiritual growth in just the same way the\nforestallers stand between men and food. Their activities at present are\nan almost intolerable nuisance. One cannot say \"God\" but some tout is\ninstantly seeking to pluck one into his particular cave of flummery and\northodoxy. What a rational man means by God is just God. The more you\ndefine and argue about God the more he remains the same simple thing.\nJudaism, Christianity, Islam, modern Hindu religious thought, all agree\nin declaring that there is one God, master and leader of all mankind, in\nunending conflict with cruelty, disorder, folly and waste. To my mind,\nit follows immediately that there can be no king, no government of any\nsort, which is not either a subordinate or a rebel government, a local\nusurpation, in the kingdom of God. But no organised religious body has\never had the courage and honesty to insist upon this. They all pander to\nnationalism and to powers and princes. They exists so to pander. Every\norganised religion in the world exists only to exploit and divert and\nwaste the religious impulse in man.\n\nThis conviction that the world kingdom of God is the only true method\nof human service, is so clear and final in my own mind, it seems\nso inevitably the conviction to which all right-thinking men must\nultimately come, that I feel almost like a looker-on at a game of\nblind-man's bluff as I watch the discussion of synthetic political\nideas. The blind man thrusts his seeking hands into the oddest corners,\nhe clutches at chairs and curtains, but at last he must surely find and\nhold and feel over and guess the name of the plainly visible quarry.\n\nSome of the French and Italian people I talked to said they were\nfighting for \"Civilisation.\" That is one name for the kingdom of God,\nand I have heard English people use it too. But much of the contemporary\nthought of England stills wanders with its back to the light. Most of it\nis pawing over jerry-built, secondary things. I have before me a\nlittle book, the joint work of Dr. Grey and Mr. Turner, of an ex-public\nschoolmaster and a manufacturer, called _Eclipse or Empire?_ (The title\n_World Might or Downfall?_ had already been secured in another quarter.)\nIt is a book that has been enormously advertised; it has been almost\nimpossible to escape its column-long advertisements; it is billed upon\nthe hoardings, and it is on the whole a very able and right-spirited\nbook. It calls for more and better education, for more scientific\nmethods, for less class suspicion and more social explicitness and\nunderstanding, for a franker and fairer treatment of labour. But why\ndoes it call for these things? Does it call for them because they are\nright? Because in accomplishing them one serves God?\n\nNot at all. But because otherwise this strange sprawling empire of ours\nwill drop back into a secondary place in the world. These two writers\nreally seem to think that the slack workman, the slacker wealthy man,\nthe negligent official, the conservative schoolmaster, the greedy\nusurer, the comfortable obstructive, confronted with this alternative,\nterrified at this idea of something or other called the Empire being\n\"eclipsed,\" eager for the continuance of this undefined glory over their\nfellow-creatures called \"Empire,\" will perceive the error of their ways\nand become energetic, devoted, capable. They think an ideal of that sort\nis going to change the daily lives of men.... I sympathise with their\npurpose, and I deplore their conception of motives. If men will not\ngive themselves for righteousness, they will not give themselves for\na geographical score. If they will not work well for the hatred of bad\nwork, they will not work well for the hatred of Germans. This \"Empire\"\nidea has been cadging about the British empire, trying to collect\nenthusiasm and devotion, since the days of Disraeli. It is, I submit,\ntoo big for the mean-spirited, and too tawdry and limited for the fine\nand generous. It leaves out the French and the Italians and the Belgians\nand all our blood brotherhood of allies. It has no compelling force\nin it. We British are not naturally Imperialist; we are something\ngreater--or something less. For two years and a half now we have been\nfighting against Imperialism in its most extravagant form. It is a\npoor incentive to right living to propose to parody the devil we fight\nagainst.\n\nThe blind man must lunge again.\n\nFor when the right answer is seized it answers not only the question why\nmen should work for their fellow-men but also why nation should cease to\narm and plan and contrive against nation. The social problem is only the\ninternational problem in retail, the international problem is only the\nsocial one in gross.\n\nMy bias rules me altogether here. I see men in social, in economic\nand in international affairs alike, eager to put an end to conflict,\ninexpressibly weary of conflict and the waste and pain and death it\ninvolves. But to end conflict one must abandon aggressive or uncordial\npretensions. Labour is sick at the idea of more strikes and struggles\nafter the war, industrialism is sick of competition and anxious for\nservice, everybody is sick of war. But how can they end any of these\nclashes except by the definition and recognition of a common end which\nwill establish a standard for the trial of every conceivable issue, to\nwhich, that is, every other issue can be subordinated; and what common\nend can there be in all the world except this idea of the world kingdom\nof God? What is the good of orienting one's devotion to a firm, or to\nclass solidarity, or _La Republique Francais_, or Poland, or Albania, or\nsuch love and loyalty as people profess for King George or King Albert\nor the Duc d'Orleans--it puzzles me why--or any such intermediate object\nof self-abandonment? We need a standard so universal that the platelayer\nmay say to the barrister or the duchess, or the Red Indian to the\nLimehouse sailor, or the Anzac soldier to the Sinn Feiner or the\nChinaman, \"What are we two doing for it?\" And to fill the place of that\n\"it,\" no other idea is great enough or commanding enough, but only the\nworld kingdom of God.\n\nHowever long he may have to hunt, the blind man who is seeking service\nand an end to bickerings will come to that at last, because of all the\nthousand other things he may clutch at, nothing else can satisfy his\nmanifest need.\n\n\n\n\nVI. THE ENDING OF THE WAR\n\n\n1\n\nAbout the end of the war there are two chief ways of thinking, there is\na simpler sort of mind which desires merely a date, and a more complex\nkind which wants particulars. To the former class belong most of the men\nout at the front. They are so bored by this war that they would\nwelcome any peace that did not definitely admit defeat--and examine\nthe particulars later. The \"tone\" of the German army, to judge by its\ncaptured letters, is even lower. It would welcome peace in any form.\nNever in the whole history of the world has a war been so universally\nunpopular as this war.\n\nThe mind of the soldier is obsessed by a vision of home-coming for\ngood, so vivid and alluring that it blots out nearly every other\nconsideration. The visions of people at home are of plenty instead\nof privation, lights up, and the cessation of a hundred tiresome\nrestrictions. And it is natural therefore that a writer rather given to\nguesses and forecasts should be asked very frequently to guess how long\nthe war has still to run.\n\nAll such forecasting is the very wildest of shooting. There are the\nchances of war to put one out, and of a war that changes far faster than\nthe military intelligence. I have made various forecasts. At the outset\nI thought that military Germany would fight at about the 1899 level,\nwould be lavish with cavalry and great attacks, that it would be\nreluctant to entrench, and that the French and British had learnt\nthe lesson of the Boer war better than the Germans. I trusted to\nthe melodramatic instinct of the Kaiser. I trusted to the quickened\nintelligence of the British military caste. The first rush seemed to\nbear me out, and I opened my paper day by day expecting to read of the\nBritish and French entrenched and the Germans beating themselves to\ndeath against wire and trenches. In those days I wrote of the French\nbeing over the Rhine before 1915. But it was the Germans who entrenched\nfirst.\n\nSince then I have made some other attempts. I did not prophesy at all in\n1915, so far as I can remember. If I had I should certainly have backed\nthe Gallipoli attempt to win. It was the right thing to do, and it was\ndone abominably. It should have given us Constantinople and brought\nBulgaria to our side; it gave us a tragic history of administrative\nindolence and negligence, and wasted bravery and devotion. I was very\nhopeful of the western offensive in 1915; and in 1916 I counted still on\nour continuing push. I believe we were very near something like decision\nthis last September, but some archaic dream of doing it with cavalry\ndashed these hopes. The \"Tanks\" arrived to late to do their proper work,\nand their method of use is being worked out very slowly.... I still\nbelieve in the western push, if only we push it for all we are worth.\nIf only we push it with our brains, with our available and still\nunorganised brains; if only we realise that the art of modern war is to\ninvent and invent and invent. Hitherto I have always hoped and looked\nfor decision, a complete victory that would enable the Allies to dictate\npeace. But such an expectation is largely conditioned by these delicate\nquestions of adaptability that my tour of the front has made very urgent\nin my mind. A spiteful German American writer has said that the British\nwould rather kill twenty thousand of their men than break one general.\nEven a grain of truth in such a remark is a very valid reasoning for\nlengthening one's estimate of the duration of the war.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the Western allies are playing a winning game\nupon the western front, and that this is the front of decision now. It\nis not in doubt that they are beating the Germans and shoving them back.\nThe uncertain factor is the rate at which they are shoving them back.\nIf they can presently get to so rapid an advance as to bring the average\nrate since July 1st up to two or three miles a day, then we shall still\nsee the Allies dictating terms. But if the shove drags on at its present\npace of less than a mile and four thousand prisoners a week over the\nlimited Somme front only, if nothing is attempted elsewhere to increase\nthe area of pressure, [*This was written originally before the French\noffensive at Verdun.] then the intolerable stress and boredom of the war\nwill bring about a peace long before the Germans are decisively crushed.\nBut the war, universally detested, may go on into 1918 or 1919. Food\nriots, famine, and general disorganisation will come before 1920, if it\ndoes. The Allies have a winning game before them, but they seem unable\nto discover and promote the military genius needed to harvest an\nunquestionable victory. In the long run this may not be an unmixed evil.\nVictory, complete and dramatic, may be bought too dearly. We need not\ntriumphs out of this war but the peace of the world.\n\nThis war is altogether unlike any previous war, and its ending, like its\ndevelopment, will follow a course of its own. For a time people's minds\nran into the old grooves, the Germans were going _nach Paris_ and _nach\nLondon_; Lord Curzon filled our minds with a pleasant image of the\nBombay Lancers riding down _Unter den Linden._ But the Versailles\nprecedent of a council of victors dictating terms to the vanquished is\nnot now so evidently in men's minds. The utmost the Allies talk upon\nnow is to say, \"We must end the war on German soil.\" The Germans talk\nfrankly of \"holding out.\" I have guessed that the western offensive will\nbe chiefly on German soil by next June; it is a mere guess, and I admit\nit is quite conceivable that the \"push\" may still be grinding out its\ndaily tale of wounded and prisoners in 1918 far from that goal.\n\nNone of the combatants expected such a war as this, and the consequence\nis that the world at large has no idea how to get out of it. The war may\nstay with us like a schoolboy caller, because it does not know how to\ngo. The Italians said as much to me. \"Suppose we get to Innsbruck and\nLaibach and Trieste,\" they said, \"it isn't an end!\" Lord Northcliffe,\nI am told, came away from Italy with the conviction that the war would\nlast six years.\n\nThere is the clearest evidence that nearly everyone is anxious to get\nout of the war now. Nobody at all, except perhaps a few people who may\nbe called to account, and a handful of greedy profit-seekers, wants to\nkeep it going. Quietly perhaps and unobtrusively, everyone I know is now\ntrying to find the way out of the war, and I am convinced that the\nsame is the case in Germany. That is what makes the Peace-at-any-price\ncampaign so exasperating. It is like being chased by clamorous geese\nacross a common in the direction in which you want to go. But how are\nwe to get out--with any credit--in such a way as to prevent a subsequent\ncollapse into another war as frightful?\n\nAt present three programmes are before the world of the way in which the\nwar can be ended. The first of these assumes a complete predominance\nof our Allies. It has been stated in general terms by Mr. Asquith.\nEvacuation, reparation, due punishment of those responsible for the war,\nand guarantees that nothing of the sort shall happen again. There is as\nyet no mention of the nature of these guarantees. Just exactly what is\nto happen to Poland, Austria, and the Turkish Empire does not appear in\nthis prospectus. The German Chancellor is equally elusive. The Kaiser\nhas stampeded the peace-at-any-price people of Great Britain by\nproclaiming that Germany wants peace. We knew that. But what sort\nof peace? It would seem that we are promised vaguely evacuation and\nreparation on the western frontier, and in addition there are to be\nguarantees--but it is quite evident that they are altogether different\nguarantees from Mr. Asquith's--that nothing of the sort is ever to\nhappen again. The programme of the British and their Allies seems\nto contemplate something like a forcible disarmament and military\noccupation of Belgium, the desertion of Serbia and Russia, and the\nsurrender to Germany of every facility for a later and more successful\nGerman offensive in the west. But it is clear that on these terms as\nstated the war must go on to the definite defeat of one side or the\nother, or a European chaos. They are irreconcilable sets of terms.\n\nYet it is hard to say how they can be modified on either side, if the\nwar is to be decided only between the belligerents and by standards of\nnational interest only, without reference to any other considerations.\nOur Allies would be insane to leave the Hohenzollern at the end of\nthe war with a knife in his hand, after the display he has made of\nhis quality. To surrender his knife means for the Hohenzollern the\nabandonment of his dreams, the repudiation of the entire education and\ntraining of Germany for half a century. When we realise the fatality of\nthis antagonism, we realise how it is that, in this present anticipation\nof hell, the weary, wasted and tormented nations must still sustain\ntheir monstrous dreary struggle. And that is why this thought that\npossible there may be a side way out, a sort of turning over of the\npresent endlessly hopeless game into a new and different and manageable\ngame through the introduction of some external factor, creeps and\nspreads as I find it creeping and spreading.\n\nThat is what the finer intelligences of America are beginning to\nrealise, and why men in Europe continually turn their eyes to America,\nwith a surmise, with a doubt.\n\nA point of departure for very much thinking in this matter is the recent\nspeech of President Wilson that heralded the present discussion. All\nEurope was impressed by the truth, and by President Wilson's recognition\nof the truth, that from any other great war after this America will\nbe unable to abstain. Can America come into this dispute at the end to\ninsist upon something better than a new diplomatic patchwork, and so\nobviate the later completer Armageddon? Is there, above the claims\nand passions of Germany, France, Britain, and the rest of them, a\nconceivable right thing to do for all mankind, that it might also be in\nthe interest of America to support? Is there a Third Party solution, so\nto speak, which may possibly be the way out from this war?\n\nAnd further I would go on to ask, is not this present exchange of Notes,\nappealing to the common sense of the world, really the beginning, and\nthe proper beginning, of the unprecedented Peace Negotiations to end\nthis unprecedented war? And, I submit, the longer this open discussion\ngoes on before the doors close upon the secret peace congress the better\nfor mankind.\n\n\n2\n\nLet me sketch out here what I conceive to be the essentials of a world\nsettlement. Some of the items are the mere commonplaces of everyone who\ndiscusses this question; some are less frequently insisted upon. I have\nbeen joining up one thing to another, suggestions I have heard from\nthis man and that, and I believe that it is really possible to state a\nsolution that will be acceptable to the bulk of reasonable men all about\nthe world. Directly we put the panic-massacres of Dinant and Louvain,\nthe crime of the _Lusitania_ and so on into the category of symptoms\nrather than essentials, outrages that call for special punishments and\nreparations, but that do not enter further into the ultimate settlement,\nwe can begin to conceive a possible world treaty. Let me state the broad\noutlines of this pacification. The outlines depend one upon the other;\neach is a condition of the other. It is upon these lines that the\nthoughtful, as distinguished from the merely the combative people, seem\nto be drifting everywhere.\n\nIn the first place, it is agreed that there would have to be an\nidentical treaty between all the great powers of the world binding them\nto certain things. It would have to provide:--\n\nThat the few great industrial states capable of producing modern war\nequipment should take over and control completely the manufacture of all\nmunitions of war in the world. And that they should absolutely close the\nsupply of such material to all the other states in the world. This is a\nfar easier task than many people suppose. War has now been so developed\non its mechanical side that the question of its continuance or abolition\nrests now entirely upon four or five great powers.\n\nNext comes the League of Peace idea; that there should be an\nInternational Tribunal for the discussion and settlement of\ninternational disputes. That the dominating powers should maintain land\nand sea forces only up to a limit agreed upon and for internal police\nuse only or for the purpose of enforcing the decisions of the Tribunal.\nThat they should all be bound to attack and suppress any power amongst\nthem which increases its war equipment beyond its defined limits.\n\nThat much has already been broached in several quarters. But so far is\nnot enough. It ignores the chief processes of that economic war that\naids and abets and is inseparably a part of modern international\nconflicts. If we are to go as far as we have already stated in the\nmatter of international controls, then we must go further and provide\nthat the International Tribunal should have power to consider and set\naside all tariffs and localised privileges that seem grossly unfair or\nseriously irritating between the various states of the world. It\nshould have power to pass or revise all new tariff, quarantine, alien\nexclusion, or the like legislation affecting international relations.\nMoreover, it should take over and extend the work of the International\nBureau of Agriculture at Rome with a view to the control of all staple\nproducts. It should administer the sea law of the world, and control and\nstandardise freights in the common interests of mankind. Without these\nprovisions it would be merely preventing the use of certain weapons; it\nwould be doing nothing to prevent countries strangling or suffocating\neach other by commercial warfare. It would not abolish war.\n\nNow upon this issue people do not seem to me to be yet thinking very\nclearly. It is the exception to find anyone among the peace talkers who\nreally grasps how inseparably the necessity for free access for everyone\nto natural products, to coal and tropical products, e.g. free shipping\nat non-discriminating tariffs, and the recognition by a Tribunal of the\nprinciple of common welfare in trade matters, is bound up with the ideal\nof a permanent world peace. But any peace that does not provide for\nthese things will be merely laying down of the sword in order to take up\nthe cudgel. And a \"peace\" that did not rehabilitate industrial Belgium,\nPoland, and the north of France would call imperatively for the\nimposition upon the Allies of a system of tariffs in the interests of\nthese countries, and for a bitter economic \"war after the war\" against\nGermany. That restoration is, of course, an implicit condition to any\nattempt to set up an economic peace in the world.\n\nThese things being arranged for the future, it would be further\nnecessary to set up an International Boundary Commission, subject to\ncertain defining conditions agreed upon by the belligerents, to re-draw\nthe map of Europe, Asia, and Africa. This war does afford an occasion\nsuch as the world may never have again of tracing out the \"natural map\"\nof mankind, the map that will secure the maximum of homogeneity and the\nminimum of racial and economic freedom. All idealistic people hope for\na restored Poland. But it is a childish thing to dream of a contented\nPoland with Posen still under the Prussian heel, with Cracow cut off,\nand without a Baltic port. These claims of Poland to completeness have a\nhigher sanction than the mere give and take of belligerents in congress.\n\nMoreover this International Tribunal, if it was indeed to prevent war,\nwould need also to have power to intervene in the affairs of any country\nor region in a state of open and manifest disorder, for the protection\nof foreign travellers and of persons and interests localised in that\ncountry but foreign to it.\n\nSuch an agreement as I have here sketched out would at once lift\ninternational politics out of the bloody and hopeless squalor of\nthe present conflict. It is, I venture to assert, the peace of the\nreasonable man in any country whatever. But it needs the attention\nof such a disengaged people as the American people to work it out and\nsupply it with--weight. It needs putting before the world with some sort\nof authority greater than its mere entire reasonableness. Otherwise\nit will not come before the minds of ordinary men with the effect of a\npracticable proposition. I do not see any such plant springing from the\nEuropean battlefields. It is America's supreme opportunity. And yet it\nis the common sense of the situation, and the solution that must satisfy\na rational German as completely as a rational Frenchman or Englishman.\nIt has nothing against it but the prejudice against new and entirely\nnovel things.\n\n\n3\n\nIn throwing out the suggestion that America should ultimately undertake\nthe responsibility of proposing a world peace settlement, I admit that\nI run counter to a great deal of European feeling. Nowhere in Europe now\ndo people seem to be in love with the United States. But feeling is\na colour that passes. And the question is above matters of feeling.\nWhether the belligerents dislike Americans or the Americans dislike the\nbelligerents is an incidental matter. The main question is of the duty\nof a great and fortunate nation towards the rest of the world and the\nfuture of mankind.\n\nI do not know how far Americans are aware of the trend of feeling in\nEurope at the present time. Both France and Great Britain have a sense\nof righteousness in this war such as no nation, no people, has ever felt\nin war before. We know we are fighting to save all the world from the\nrule of force and the unquestioned supremacy of the military idea. Few\nFrenchmen or Englishmen can imagine the war presenting itself to an\nAmerican intelligence under any other guise. At the invasion of Belgium\nwe were astonished that America did nothing. At the sinking of the\n_Lusitania_ all Europe looked to America. The British mind contemplates\nthe spectacle of American destroyers acting as bottleholders to German\nsubmarines with a dazzled astonishment. \"Manila,\" we gasp. In England we\nfind excuses for America in our own past. In '64 we betrayed Denmark; in\n'70 we deserted France. The French have not these memories. They do\nnot understand the damning temptations of those who feel they are\n\"_au-dessus de la melee._\" They believe they had some share in the\nindependence of America, that there is a sacred cause in republicanism,\nthat there are grounds for a peculiar sympathy between France and the\nUnited States in republican institutions. They do not realise that\nGermany and America have a common experience in recent industrial\ndevelopment, and a common belief in the \"degeneracy\" of all nations with\na lower rate of trade expansion. They do not realise how a political\ncampaign with the slogan of \"Peace and a Full Dinner-Pail\" looks in the\nmiddle west, what an honest, simple, rational appeal it makes there.\nAtmospheres alter values. In Europe, strung up to tragic and majestic\nissues, to Europe gripping a gigantic evil in a death struggle, that\nwould seem an inscription worthy of a pigsty. A child in Europe would\nknow now that the context is, \"until the bacon-buyer calls,\" and it is\ndifficult to realise that adult citizens in America may be incapable of\nrealising that obvious context.\n\nI set these things down plainly. There is a very strong disposition in\nall the European countries to believe America fundamentally indifferent\nto the rights and wrongs of the European struggle; sentimentally\ninterested perhaps, but fundamentally indifferent. President Wilson\nis regarded as a mere academic sentimentalist by a great number of\nEuropeans. There is a very widespread disposition to treat America\nlightly and contemptuously, to believe that America, as one man put it\nto me recently, \"hasn't the heart to do anything great or the guts to do\nanything wicked.\" There is a strong undercurrent of hostility therefore\nto the idea of America having any voice whatever in the final settlement\nafter the war. It is not for a British writer to analyse the appearance\nthat have thus affected American world prestige. I am telling what I\nhave observed.\n\nLet me relate two trivial anecdotes.\n\nX came to my hotel in Paris one day to take me to see a certain\nmunitions organisation. He took from his pocket a picture postcard that\nhad been sent him by a well-meaning American acquaintance from America.\nIt bore a portrait of General Lafayette, and under it was printed the\nwords, \"General Lafayette, _Colonel in the United States army._\"\n\n\"Oh! These Americans!\" said X with a gesture.\n\nAnd as I returned to Paris from the French front, our train stopped at\nsome intermediate station alongside of another train of wounded\nmen. Exactly opposite our compartment was a car. It arrested our\nconversation. It was, as it were, an ambulance _de grand luxe_; it was a\nthing of very light, bright wood and very golden decorations; at one end\nof it was painted very large and fair the Stars and Stripes, and at the\nother fair-sized letters of gold proclaimed--I am sure the lady will\nnot resent this added gleam of publicity--\"Presented by Mrs. William\nVanderbilt.\"\n\nMy companions were French writers and French military men, and they were\ndiscussing with very keen interest that persistent question, \"the ideal\nbattery.\" But that ambulance sent a shaft of light into our carriage,\nand we stared together.\n\nThen Colonel Z pointed with two fingers and remarked to us, without any\nexcess of admiration:\n\n\"_America!_\"\n\nThen he shrugged his shoulders and pulled down the corners of his mouth.\n\nWe felt there was nothing more to add to that, and after a little pause\nthe previous question was resumed.\n\nI state these things in order to make it clear that America will start\nat a disadvantage when she starts upon the mission of salvage and\nreconciliation which is, I believe, her proper role in this world\nconflict. One would have to be blind and deaf on this side to be\nignorant of European persuasion of America's triviality. I would not\nlike to be an American travelling in Europe now, and those I meet here\nand there have some of the air of men who at any moment may be\ndunned for a debt. They explode without provocation into excuses and\nexpostulations.\n\nAnd I will further confess that when Viscount Grey answered the\nintimations of President Wilson and ex-President Taft of an American\ninitiative to found a World League for Peace, by asking if America\nwas prepared to back that idea with force, he spoke the doubts of all\nthoughtful European men. No one but an American deeply versed in the\nidiosyncrasies of the American population can answer that question, or\ntell us how far the delusion of world isolation which has prevailed in\nAmerica for several generations has been dispelled. But if the answer\nto Lord Grey is \"Yes,\" then I think history will emerge with a complete\njustification of the obstinate maintenance of neutrality by America. It\nis the end that reveals a motive. It is our ultimate act that sometimes\nteaches us our original intention. No one can judge the United States\nyet. Were you neutral because you are too mean and cowardly, or too\nstupidly selfish, or because you had in view an end too great to be\nsacrificed to a moment of indignant pride and a force in reserve too\nprecious to dispel? That is the still open question for America.\n\nEvery country is a mixture of many strands. There is a Base America,\nthere is a Dull America, there is an Ideal and Heroic America. And I\nam convinced that at present Europe underrates and misjudges the\npossibilities of the latter.\n\nAll about the world to-day goes a certain freemasonry of thought. It is\nan impalpable and hardly conscious union of intention. It thinks not\nin terms of national but human experience; it falls into directions and\nchannels of thinking that lead inevitably to the idea of a world-state\nunder the rule of one righteousness. In no part of the world is this\nmodern type of mind so abundantly developed, less impeded by antiquated\nand perverse political and religious forms, and nearer the sources of\npolitical and administrative power, than in America. It does not seem to\nmatter what thousand other things America may happen to be, seeing that\nit is also that. And so, just as I cling to the belief, in spite of\nhundreds of adverse phenomena, that the religious and social stir of\nthese times must ultimately go far to unify mankind under the kingship\nof God, so do I cling also to the persuasion that there are intellectual\nforces among the rational elements in the belligerent centres, among\nthe other neutrals and in America, that will co-operate in enabling the\nUnited States to play that role of the Unimpassioned Third Party, which\nbecomes more and more necessary to a generally satisfactory ending of\nthe war.\n\n\n4\n\nThe idea that the settlement of this war must be what one might call an\nunimpassioned settlement or, if you will, a scientific settlement or a\njudicial and not a treaty settlement, a settlement, that is, based upon\nsome conception of what is right and necessary rather than upon the\nrelative success or failure of either set of belligerents to make its\nWill the standard of decision, is one that, in a great variety of forms\nand partial developments, I find gaining ground in the most different\ncircles. The war was an adventure, it was the German adventure under the\nHohenzollern tradition, to dominate the world. It was to be the last of\nthe Conquests. It has failed. Without calling upon the reserve strength\nof America the civilised world has defeated it, and the war continues\nnow partly upon the issue whether it shall be made for ever impossible,\nand partly because Germany has no organ but its Hohenzollern\norganisation through which it can admit its failure and develop its\nlatent readiness for a new understanding on lines of mutual toleration.\nFor that purpose nothing more reluctant could be devised than\nHohenzollern imperialism. But the attention of every new combatant--it\nis not only Germany now--has been concentrated upon military\nnecessities; every nation is a clenched nation, with its powers of\naction centred in its own administration, bound by many strategic\nthreats and declarations, and dominated by the idea of getting and\nsecuring advantages. It is inevitable that a settlement made in a\nconference of belligerents alone will be shortsighted, harsh, limited by\nmerely incidental necessities, and obsessed by the idea of hostilities\nand rivalries continuing perennially; it will be a trading of advantages\nfor subsequent attacks. It will be a settlement altogether different in\neffect as well as in spirit from a world settlement made primarily to\nestablish a new phase in the history of mankind.\n\nLet me take three instances of the impossibility of complete victory\n_on either side_ giving a solution satisfactory to the conscience and\nintelligence of reasonable men.\n\nThe first--on which I will not expatiate, for everyone knows of its\npeculiar difficulty--is Poland.\n\nThe second is a little one, but one that has taken hold of my\nimagination. In the settlement of boundaries preceding this war the\nboundary between Serbia and north-eastern Albania was drawn with an\nextraordinary disregard of the elementary needs of the Albanians of that\nregion. It ran along the foot of the mountains which form their summer\npastures and their refuge from attack, and it cut their mountains off\nfrom their winter pastures and market towns. Their whole economic life\nwas cut to pieces and existence rendered intolerable for them. Now an\nintelligent Third Party settling Europe would certainly restore these\nmarket towns, Ipek, Jakova, and Prisrend, to Albania. But the Albanians\nhave no standing in this war; theirs is the happy lot that might have\nfallen to Belgium had she not resisted; the war goes to and fro through\nAlbania; and when the settlement comes, it is highly improbable that\nthe slightest notice will be taken of Albania's plight in the region. In\nwhich case these particular Albanians will either be driven into exile\nto America or they will be goaded to revolt, which will be followed no\ndoubt by the punitive procedure usual in the Balkan peninsula.\n\nFor my third instance I would step from a matter as small as three\nmarket towns and the grazing of a few thousand head of sheep to a matter\nas big as the world. What is going to happen to the shipping of the\nworld after this war? The Germans, with that combination of cunning\nand stupidity which baffles the rest of mankind, have set themselves to\ndestroy the mercantile marine not merely of Britain and France but of\nNorway and Sweden, Holland, and all the neutral countries. The German\npapers openly boast that they are building up a big mercantile marine\nthat will start out to take up the world's overseas trade directly peace\nis declared. Every such boast receives careful attention in the British\npress. We have heard a very great deal about the German will-to-power\nin this war, but there is something very much older and tougher and less\nblatant and conspicuous, the British will. In the British papers there\nhas appeared and gained a permanent footing this phrase, \"ton for ton.\"\nThis means that Britain will go on fighting until she has exacted and\ntaken over from Germany the exact equivalent of all the British shipping\nGermany has submarined. People do not realise that a time may come when\nGermany will be glad and eager to give Russia, France and Italy all that\nthey require of her, when Great Britain may be quite content to let\nher allies make an advantageous peace and herself still go on fighting\nGermany. She does not intend to let that furtively created German\nmercantile marine ship or coal or exist upon the high seas--so long as\nit can be used as an economic weapon against her. Neither Britain nor\nFrance nor Italy can tolerate anything of the sort.\n\nIt has been the peculiar boast of Great Britain that her shipping has\nbeen unpatriotic. She has been the impartial carrier of the whole world.\nHer shippers may have served their own profit; they have never served\nhers. The fluctuations of freight charges may have been a universal\nnuisance, but they have certainly not been an aggressive national\nconspiracy. It is Britain's case against any German ascendancy at sea,\nan entirely convincing case, that such an ascendancy would be used\nruthlessly for the advancement of German world power. The long-standing\nfreedom of the seas vanishes at the German touch. So beyond the present\nwar there opens the agreeable prospect of a mercantile struggle, a\nbitter freight war and a war of Navigation Acts for the ultimate control\nin the interests of Germany or of the Anti-German allies, of the world's\ntrade.\n\nNow how in any of these three cases can the bargaining and trickery of\ndiplomatists and the advantage-hunting of the belligerents produce any\nstable and generally beneficial solution? What all the neutrals want,\nwhat every rational and far-sighted man in the belligerent countries\nwants, what the common sense of the whole world demands, is neither the\n\"ascendancy\" of Germany nor the \"ascendancy\" of Great Britain nor the\n\"ascendancy\" of any state or people or interest in the shipping of the\nworld. The plain right thing is a world shipping control, as impartial\nas the Postal Union. What right and reason and the welfare of coming\ngenerations demand in Poland is a unified and autonomous Poland,\nwith Cracow, Danzig, and Posen brought into the same Polish-speaking\nring-fence with Warsaw. What everyone who has looked into the Albanian\nquestion desires is that the Albanians shall pasture their flocks and\nmarket their sheepskins in peace, free of Serbian control. In every\ncountry at present at war, the desire of the majority of people is for\na non-contentious solution that will neither crystallise a triumph nor\npropitiate an enemy, but which will embody the economic and ethnological\nand geographical common sense of the matter. But while the formulae\nof national belligerence are easy, familiar, blatant, and instantly\npresent, the gentler, greater formulae of that wider and newer world\npacifism has still to be generally understood. It is so much easier to\nhate and suspect than negotiate generously and patiently; it is so\nmuch harder to think than to let go in a shrill storm of hostility. The\nrational pacifist is hampered not only by belligerency, but by a sort\nof malignant extreme pacifism as impatient and silly as the extremest\npatriotism.\n\n\n5\n\nI sketch out these ideas of a world pacification from a third-party\nstandpoint, because I find them crystallising out in men's minds. I note\nhow men discuss the suggestion that America may play a large part in\nsuch a permanent world pacification. There I end my account rendered.\nThese things are as much a part of my impression of the war as a\nshell-burst on the Carso or the yellow trenches at Martinpuich. But I\ndo not know how opinion is going in America, and I am quite unable to\nestimate the power of these new ideas I set down, relative to the blind\nforces of instinct and tradition that move the mass of mankind. On the\nwhole I believe more in the reason-guided will-power of men than I did\nin the early half of 1914. If I am doubtful whether after all this war\nwill \"end war,\" I think on the other hand it has had such an effect of\ndemonstration that it may start a process of thought and conviction,\nit may sow the world with organisations and educational movements\nconsiderable enough to grapple with an either arrest or prevent the next\ngreat war catastrophe. I am by no means sure even now that this is not\nthe last great war in the experience of men. I still believe it may be.\n\nThe most dangerous thing in the business so far is concerned is the wide\ndisregard of the fact that national economic fighting is bound to cause\nwar, and the almost universal ignorance of the necessity of subjecting\nshipping and overseas and international trade to some kind of\ninternational control. These two things, restraint of trade and\nadvantage of shipping, are the chief material causes of anger between\nmodern states. But they would not be in themselves dangerous things if\nit were not for the exaggerated delusions of kind and difference, and\nthe crack-brained \"loyalties\" arising out of these, that seem still to\nrule men's minds. Years ago I came to the conviction that much of the\nevil in human life was due to the inherent vicious disposition of the\nhuman mind to intensify classification.[*See my \"First and Last Things,\"\nBook I. and my \"Modern Utopia,\" Chapter X.] I do not know how it will\nstrike the reader, but to me this war, this slaughter of eight or nine\nmillion people, is due almost entirely to this little, almost universal\nlack of clear-headedness; I believe that the share of wickedness in\nmaking war is quite secondary to the share of this universal shallow\nsilliness of outlook. These effigies of emperors and kings and statesmen\nthat lead men into war, these legends of nationality and glory, would\ncollapse before our universal derision, if they were not stuffed tight\nand full with the unthinking folly of the common man.\n\nThere is in all of us an indolent capacity for suffering evil and\ndangerous things, that I contemplate each year of my life with a\ndeepening incredulity. I perceive we suffer them; I record the futile\nprotests of the intelligence. It seems to me incredible that men should\nnot rise up out of this muddy, bloody, wasteful mess of a world war,\nwith a resolution to end for ever the shams, the prejudices, the\npretences and habits that have impoverished their lives, slaughtered our\nsons, and wasted the world, a resolution so powerful and sustained that\nnothing could withstand it.\n\nBut it is not apparent that any such will arises. Does it appear at all?\nI find it hard to answer that question because my own answer varies with\nmy mood. There are moods when it seems to me that nothing of the sort\nis happening. This war has written its warning in letters of blood and\nflame and anguish in the skies of mankind for two years and a half. When\nI look for the collective response to that warning, I see a multitude\nof little chaps crawling about their private ends like mites in an old\ncheese. The kings are still in their places, not a royal prince has been\nkilled in this otherwise universal slaughter; when the fatuous portraits\nof the monarchs flash upon the screen the widows and orphans still break\ninto loyal song. The ten thousand religions of mankind are still ten\nthousand religions, all busy at keeping men apart and hostile. I see\nscarcely a measurable step made anywhere towards that world kingdom of\nGod, which is, I assert, the manifest solution, the only formula that\ncan bring peace to all mankind. Mankind as a whole seems to have learnt\nnothing and forgotten nothing in thirty months of war.\n\nAnd then on the other hand I am aware of much quiet talking. This\nbook tells of how I set out to see the war, and it is largely\nconversation.... Perhaps men have always expected miracles to happen;\nif one had always lived in the night and only heard tell of the day, I\nsuppose one would have expected dawn to come as a vivid flash of light.\nI suppose one would still think it was night long after the things about\none had crept out of the darkness into visibility. In comparison with\nall previous wars there has been much more thinking and much more\ndiscussion. If most of the talk seems to be futile, if it seems as if\neveryone were talking and nobody doing, it does not follow that things\nare not quietly slipping and sliding out of their old adjustments\namidst the babble and because of the babble. Multitudes of men must be\nstruggling with new ideas. It is reasonable to argue that there must\nbe reconsideration, there must be time, before these millions of mental\nefforts can develop into a new collective purpose and really _show_--in\nconsequences.\n\nBut that they will do so is my hope always and, on the whole, except in\nmoods of depression and impatience, my belief. When one has travelled\nto a conviction so great as mine it is difficult to doubt that other men\nfaced by the same universal facts will not come to the same conclusion.\nI believe that only through a complete simplification o religion to its\nfundamental idea, to a world-wide realisation of God as the king of the\nheart and of all mankind, setting aside monarchy and national egotism\naltogether, can mankind come to any certain happiness and security. The\nprecedent of Islam helps my faith in the creative inspiration of such\na renascence of religion. The Sikh, the Moslem, the Puritan have shown\nthat men can fight better for a Divine Idea than for any flag or monarch\nin the world. It seems to me that illusions fade and effigies lose\ncredit everywhere. It is a very wonderful thing to me that China is now\na republic.... I take myself to be very nearly an average man, abnormal\nonly by reason of a certain mental rapidity. I conceive myself to be\nthinking as the world thinks, and if I find no great facts, I find a\nhundred little indications to reassure me that God comes. Even those who\nhave neither the imagination nor the faith to apprehend God as a\nreality will, I think, realise presently that the Kingdom of God over\na world-wide system of republican states, is the only possible formula\nunder which we may hope to unify and save mankind.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of War and the Future, by H.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1157,"split":"test"}
