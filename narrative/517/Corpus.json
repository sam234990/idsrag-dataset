{"ori_id":"78ee76ea661bf5bc910ea56dcf0307b03f26a5f2","title":"The Nether World","context":"The Nether World\n The old Michael Snowdon returns from Australia to London after inheriting a substantial sum of money from his deceased son. Despite being able to live a comfortable, if not luxurious life, he spends only on necessities and lives like a poor man, keeping his fortune secret. In London he finds his granddaughter, Jane, a weak child whom he rescues from the tyranny of the Peckovers (mother and daughter), in whose house she is employed as a household drudge. Jane's father, Joseph, is another son of Michael's who disappeared a few years ago in search of work, leaving Jane with the Peckovers. Michael nurtures a plan to bestow his fortune on Jane after his death, but he wants Jane to spend this money on charity and social work rather than on her own needs. He engages Jane in charitable activities and everyday work even before he reveals the secret of his wealth to her, trying to inculcate to her the principles of benevolence.\nJoseph Snowdon returns suddenly to London. Formerly he argued with his father and is not on amiable terms with him. Joseph is preyed upon by the young Clem Peckover who marries him after she and her mother begin suspecting that Joseph's father is rich. Michael receives Joseph reservedly, without revealing intent of sharing the fortune with him. Joseph, pestered by his disappointed wife, also believes that Michael is rich, and tries to win his father's respect by improving relations with Jane. He also befriends Jane's older friend, Sidney Kirkwood. Sidney, an honest and sympathetic character, apparently intends to marry Jane in the future, unaware of Michael's fortune. Joseph, fearing that if Sidney, Michael's favorite, marries Jane, then Michael will leave most of the fortune to the young couple. Therefore, he develops a plan to make Clara Hewett, Sidney's former love, more fond of Sidney, and catalyze their marriage.\nClara Hewett is a young attractive woman who left her poor family with an intention of becoming a famous actress and escaping poverty. Clara's brother Bob, a promising artist, chooses to remain in the same social class: he marries a poor and unfortunate girl Pennyloaf whom he does not love. When Clara was living with her family, she, proud and ambitious, scorned the attention of Sidney. Sidney is a friend of her father John and the two quarrel because of Clara after she left. John believes that the loss of his daughter is Sidney's fault. Later, when John's sickly wife dies, Sidney helps the struggling Hewett family with some of his savings, and John becomes contrite about his earlier misunderstanding of Sidney's nature. In search of fame and fortune Clara joins a traveling theatre and shows talent, but her plans are thwarted by a rival actress who, jealous of Clara's success, disfigures Clara's face with an acid. Clara is admitted to a hospital, and Joseph informs John anonymously of her whereabouts. Clara is taken home, but now that all her hopes for better life are ended, she starts re-evaluating her ungratefulness towards her father and Sidney, and also contemplates suicide.\nMeanwhile, Michael reveals his secret separately to Jane and Sidney and emphasizes his plan for how the fortune should be spent. At first, Sidney seems to like the idea of life's work for charity, but later believes that Michael's plan is futile and that the money should rather be spent on Jane's education and her enjoyment of life. Disagreeing with Michael's plans, and feeling that his dignity is compromised by Joseph's broaching the question of the old man's money, Sidney reduces his relationship with Jane and instead offers marriage to Clara who accepts it gratefully.\nJane, heartbroken and uncertain of her firmness to carry out Michael's plan, becomes disfavored by the old man. After his explanation with Jane, Michael destroys his will, contemplates the matter, but before he can compose a new will he suffers a stroke and dies. In the absence of a will, the scheming Joseph inherits all the money. His wife is making plans to kill him, but Joseph escapes abroad with the money, content to leave Jane only a small pension.\nThe novel has a tragic end for all its characters. Sidney and Clara have an unhappy marriage exacerbated by material wants. Jane rejects her father's pension after discovering his intrigues and declines an offer of marriage from a well-to-do business clerk, thus accepting a life of toil. Bob Hewett largely abandons his wife and children and dies fleeing arrest for forging coins. Clem is accused of trying to poison her mother and is tried in court. Joseph's fortune is squandered in the financial markets of the United States, a misfortune that he cannot survive.\n'The Nether World' opens near Clerkenwell Close in central London, and throughout the novel focusses on the Clerkenwell area, then largely working class and a centre of workshop and small factory trades. The novel is remarkable for its very strong sense of place.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfSThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Nether World, by George Gissing\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

His age could not\nbe far from seventy, but, despite the stoop of his shoulders, he gave\nlittle sign of failing under the burden of years; his sober step\nindicated gravity of character rather than bodily feebleness, and his\ngrasp of a stout stick was not such as bespeaks need of support. His\nattire was neither that of a man of leisure, nor of the kind usually\nworn by English mechanics. Instead of coat and waistcoat, he wore a\ngarment something like a fisherman's guernsey, and over this a coarse\nshort cloak, picturesque in appearance as it was buffeted by the wind.\nHis trousers were of moleskin; his boots reached almost to his knees;\nfor head-covering he had the cheapest kind of undyed felt, its form\nexactly that of the old petasus. To say that his aspect was Venerable\nwould serve to present him in a measure, yet would not be wholly\naccurate, for there was too much of past struggle and present anxiety\nin his countenance to permit full expression of the natural dignity of\nthe features. It was a fine face and might have been distinctly noble,\nbut circumstances had marred the purpose of Nature; you perceived that\nhis cares had too often been of the kind which are created by ignoble\nnecessities, such as leave to most men of his standing a bare humanity\nof visage. He had long thin white hair; his beard was short and merely\ngrizzled. In his left hand he carried a bundle, which probably\ncontained clothing.\n\nThe burial-ground by which he had paused was as little restful to the\neye as are most of those discoverable in the byways of London. The\nsmall trees that grew about it shivered in their leaflessness; the rank\ngrass was wan under the failing day; most of the stones leaned this way\nor that, emblems of neglect (they were very white at the top, and\ndarkened downwards till the damp soil made them black), and certain\ncats and dogs were prowling or sporting among the graves. At this\ncorner the east wind blew with malice such as it never puts forth save\nwhere there are poorly clad people to be pierced; it swept before it\nthin clouds of unsavoury dust, mingled with the light refuse of the\nstreets. Above the shapeless houses night was signalling a murky\napproach; the sky--if sky it could be called--gave threatening of\nsleet, perchance of snow. And on every side was the rumble of traffic,\nthe voiceful evidence of toil and of poverty; hawkers were crying their\ngoods; the inevitable organ was clanging before a public-house hard by;\nthe crumpet-man was hastening along, with monotonous ringing of his\nbell and hoarse rhythmic wail.\n\nThe old man had fixed his eyes half absently on the inscription of a\ngravestone near him; a lean cat springing out between the iron railings\nseemed to recall his attention, and with a slight sigh he went forward\nalong the narrow street which is called St. James's Walk. In a few\nminutes he had reached the end of it, and found himself facing a high\ngrey-brick wall, wherein, at this point, was an arched gateway closed\nwith black doors. He looked at the gateway, then fixed his gaze on\nsomething that stood just above--something which the dusk half\nconcealed, and by so doing made more impressive. It was the sculptured\ncounterfeit of a human face, that of a man distraught with agony. The\neyes stared wildly from their sockets, the hair struggled in maniac\ndisorder, the forehead was wrung with torture, the cheeks sunken, the\nthroat fearsomely wasted, and from the wide lips there seemed to be\nissuing a horrible cry. Above this hideous effigy was carved the\nlegend: 'MIDDLESEX HOUSE OF DETENTION.'\n\nSomething more than pain came to the old man's face as he looked and\npondered; his lips trembled like those of one in anger, and his eyes\nhad a stern resentful gleaming. He walked on a few paces, then suddenly\nstopped where a woman was standing at an open door.\n\n'I ask your pardon,' he said, addressing her with the courtesy which\nowes nothing to refined intercourse, 'but do you by chance know anyone\nof the name of Snowdon hereabouts?'\n\nThe woman replied with a brief negative; she smiled at the appearance\nof the questioner, and, with the vulgar instinct, looked about for\nsomeone to share her amusement.\n\n'Better inquire at the 'ouse at the corner,' she added, as the man was\nmoving away. 'They've been here a long time, I b'lieve.'\n\nHe accepted her advice. But the people at the public-house could not\naid his search. He thanked them, paused for a moment with his eyes\ndown, then again sighed slightly and went forth into the gathering\ngloom.\n\nLess than five minutes later there ran into the same house of\nrefreshment a little slight girl, perhaps thirteen years old; she\ncarried a jug, and at the bar asked for 'a pint of old six.' The\nbarman, whilst drawing the ale, called out to a man who had entered\nimmediately after the child:\n\n'Don't know nobody called Snowdon about 'ere, do you, Mr. Squibbs?'\n\nThe individual addressed was very dirty, very sleepy, and seemingly at\nodds with mankind. He replied contemptuously with a word which, in\nphonetic rendering may perhaps be spelt 'Nay-oo.'\n\nBut the little girl was looking eagerly from one man to the other; what\nhad been said appeared to excite keen interest in her. She forgot all\nabout the beer-jug that was waiting, and, after a brief but obvious\nstruggle with timidity, said in an uncertain voice:\n\n'Has somebody been asking for that name, sir?'\n\n'Yes, they have,' the barman answered, in surprise. 'Why?'\n\nMy name's Snowdon, sir--Jane Snowdon.'\n\nShe reddened over all her face as soon as she had given utterance to\nthe impulsive words. The barman was regarding her with a sort of\nsemi-interest, and Mr. Squibbs also had fixed his bleary (or beery)\neyes upon her. Neither would have admitted an active interest in so\npale and thin and wretchedly-clad a little mortal. Her hair hung loose,\nand had no covering; it was hair of no particular colour, and seemed to\nhave been for a long time utterly untended; the wind, on her run\nhither, had tossed it into much disorder. Signs there were of some kind\nof clothing beneath the short, dirty, worn dress, but it was evidently\nof the scantiest description. The freely exposed neck was very thin,\nbut, like the outline of her face, spoke less of a feeble habit of body\nthan of the present pinch of sheer hunger. She did not, indeed, look\nlike one of those children who are born in disease and starvation, and\nput to nurse upon the pavement; her limbs were shapely enough, her back\nwas straight, she had features that were not merely human, but\ngirl-like, and her look had in it the light of an intelligence\ngenerally sought for in vain among the children of the street. The\nblush and the way in which she hung her head were likewise tokens of a\nnature endowed with ample sensitiveness.\n\n'Oh, your name's Jane Snowdon, is it?' said the barman. 'Well, you're\njust three minutes an' three-quarters too late. P'r'aps it's a fortune\na-runnin' after you. He was a rum old party as inquired. Never mind;\nit's all in a life. There's fortunes lost every week by a good deal\nless than three minutes when it's 'orses--eh, Mr. Squibbs?'\n\nMr. Squibbs swore with emphasis.\n\nThe little girl took her jug of beer and was turning away.\n\n'Hollo!' cried the barman. 'Where's the money, Jane?--if _you_ don't\nmind.'\n\nShe turned again in increased confusion, and laid coppers on the\ncounter. Thereupon the man asked her where she lived; she named a house\nin Clerkenwell Close, near at hand.\n\n'Father live there?'\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n'Mother?'\n\n'I haven't got one, sir.'\n\n'Who is it as you live with, then?'\n\n'Mrs. Peckover, sir.'\n\n'Well, as I was sayin', he was a queer old joker as arsted for the name\nof Snowdon. Shouldn't wonder if you see him goin' round.'\n\nAnd he added a pretty full description of this old man, to which the\ngirl listened closely. Then she went thoughtfully--a little sadly--on\nher way.\n\nIn the street, all but dark by this time, she cast anxious glances\nonwards and behind, but no old man in an odd hat and cloak and with\nwhite hair was discoverable. Linger she might not. She reached a house\nof which the front-door stood open; it looked black and cavernous\nwithin; but she advanced with the step of familiarity, and went\ndownstairs to a front-kitchen. Through the half-open door came a strong\nodour and a hissing sound, plainly due to the frying of sausages.\nBefore Jane could enter she was greeted sharply in a voice which was\nyoung and that of a female, but had no other quality of graciousness.\n\n'You've taken your time, my lady! All right! just wait till I've 'ad my\ntea, that's all! Me an' you'll settle accounts to-night, see if we\ndon't. Mother told me as she owed you a lickin', and I'll pay it off,\nwith a little on my own account too. Only wait till I've 'ad my tea,\nthat's all. What are you standin' there for, like a fool? Bring that\nbeer 'ere, an' let's see 'ow much you've drank.'\n\n'I haven't put my lips near it, miss; indeed I haven't,' pleaded the\nchild, whose face of dread proved both natural timidity and the\nconstant apprehension of ill-usage.\n\n'Little liar! that's what you always was, an' always will be.-- Take\nthat!'\n\nThe speaker was a girl of sixteen, tall, rather bony, rudely handsome;\nthe hand with which she struck was large and coarse-fibred, the muscles\nthat impelled it vigorous. Her dress was that of a work-girl,\nunsubstantial, ill-fitting, but of ambitious cut; her hair was very\nabundant, and rose upon the back of her head in thick coils, an elegant\nfringe depending in front. The fire had made her face scarlet, and in\nthe lamplight her large eyes glistened with many joys.\n\nFirst and foremost, Miss Clementina Peckover rejoiced because she had\nleft work much earlier than usual, and was about to enjoy what she\nwould have described as a 'blow out.' Secondly, she rejoiced because\nher mother, the landlady of the house, was absent for the night, and\nconsequently she would exercise sole authority over the domestic slave,\nJane Snowdon--that is to say, would indulge to the uttermost her\ninstincts of cruelty in tormenting a defenceless creature. Finally--a\ncause of happiness antecedent to the others, but less vivid in her mind\nat this moment--in the next room lay awaiting burial the corpse of Mrs.\nPeckover's mother-in-law, whose death six days ago had plunged mother\nand daughter into profound delight, partly because they were relieved\nat length from making a pretence of humanity to a bed-ridden old woman,\npartly owing to the fact that the deceased had left behind her a sum of\nseventy-five pounds, exclusive of moneys due from a burial-club.\n\n'Ah!' exclaimed Miss Peckover (who was affectionately known to her\nintimates as 'Clem'), as she watched Jane stagger back from the blow,\nand hide her face in silent endurance of pain. 'That's just a morsel to\nstay your appetite, my lady! You didn't expect me back 'ome at this\ntime, did you? You thought as you was goin' to have the kitchen to\nyourself when mother went. Ha ha! ho ho!--These sausages is done; now\nyou clean that fryin'-pan; and if I can find a speck of dirt in it as\nbig as 'arlf a farden, I'll take you by the 'air of the 'ed an' clean\nit with your face, _that's_ what I'll do! Understand? Oh, I mean what\nI say, my lady! Me an' you's a-goin' to spend a evenin' together,\nthere's no two ways about that. He ho! he he!'\n\nThe frankness of Clem's brutality went far towards redeeming her\ncharacter. The exquisite satisfaction with which she viewed Jane's\npresent misery, the broad joviality with which she gloated over the\nprospect of cruelties shortly to be inflicted, put her at once on a par\nwith the noble savage running wild in woods. Civilisation could bring\nno charge against this young woman; it and she had no common criterion.\nWho knows but this lust of hers for sanguinary domination was the\nnatural enough issue of the brutalising serfdom of her predecessors in\nthe family line of the Peckovers? A thrall suddenly endowed with\nauthority will assuredly make bitter work for the luckless creature in\nthe next degree of thraldom.\n\nA cloth was already spread across one end of the deal table, with such\nother preparations for a meal as Clem deemed adequate. The\nsausages--five in number--she had emptied from the frying-pan directly\non to her plate, and with them all the black rich juice that had exuded\nin the process of cooking--particularly rich, owing to its having\nseveral times caught fire and blazed triumphantly. On sitting down and\nsquaring her comely frame to work, the first thing Clem did was to take\na long draught out of the beer-jug; refreshed thus, she poured the\nremaining liquor into a glass. Ready at hand was mustard, made in a\ntea-cup; having taken a certain quantity of this condiment on to her\nknife, she proceeded to spread each sausage with it from end to end,\npatting them in a friendly way as she finished the operation. Next she\nsprinkled them with pepper, and after that she constructed a little\npile of salt on the side of the plate, using her fingers to convey it\nfrom the salt-cellar. It remained to cut a thick slice of bread--she\nheld the loaf pressed to her bosom whilst doing this--and to crush it\ndown well into the black grease beside the sausages; then Clem was\nready to begin.\n\nFor five minutes she fed heartily, showing really remarkable skill in\nconveying pieces of sausage to her mouth by means of the knife alone.\nFinding it necessary to breathe at last, she looked round at Jane. The\nhand-maiden was on her knees near the fire, scrubbing very hard at the\npan with successive pieces of newspaper. It was a sight to increase the\ngusto of Clem's meal, but of a sudden there came into the girl's mind a\nyet more delightful thought. I have mentioned that in the back-kitchen\nlay the body of a dead woman; it was already encoffined, and waited for\ninterment on the morrow, when Mrs. Peckover would arrive with a certain\nfemale relative from St. Albans. Now the proximity of this corpse was a\nceaseless occasion of dread and misery to Jane Snowdon; the poor child\nhad each night to make up a bed for herself in this front-room,\ndragging together a little heap of rags when mother and daughter were\ngone up to their chamber, and since the old woman's death it was much\nif Jane had enjoyed one hour of unbroken sleep. She endeavoured to hide\nthese feelings, but Clem, with her Red Indian scent, divined them\naccurately enough. She hit upon a good idea.\n\n'Go into the next room,' she commanded suddenly, 'and fetch the matches\noff of the mantel-piece. I shall want to go upstairs presently, to see\nif you've scrubbed the bed-room well.'\n\nJane was blanched; but she rose from her knees at once, and reached a\ncandlestick from above the fireplace.\n\n'What's that for?' shouted Clem, with her mouth full. 'You've no need\nof a light to find the mantel-piece. If you're not off--'\n\nJane hastened from the kitchen. Clem yelled to her to close the door,\nand she had no choice but to obey. In the dark passage outside there\nwas darkness that might be felt. The child all but fainted with the\nsickness of horror as she turned the handle of the other door and began\nto grope her way. She knew exactly where the coffin was; she knew that\nto avoid touching it in the diminutive room was all but impossible. And\ntouch it she did. Her anguish uttered itself, not in a mere sound of\nterror, but in a broken word or two of a prayer she knew by heart,\nincluding a name which sounded like a charm against evil. She had\nreached the mantel-piece; oh, she could not, could not find the matches!\nYes, at last her hand closed on them. A blind rush, and she was out\nagain in the passage. She re-entered the front-kitchen with limbs that\nquivered, with the sound of dreadful voices ringing about her, and\nblankness before her eyes.\n\nClem laughed heartily, then finished her beer in a long, enjoyable\npull. Her appetite was satisfied; the last trace of oleaginous matter\nhad disappeared from her plate, and now she toyed with little pieces of\nbread lightly dipped into the mustard-pot. These _bonnes bouches_ put\nher into excellent humour; presently she crossed her arms and leaned\nback. There was no denying that Clem was handsome; at sixteen she had\nall her charms in apparent maturity, and they were of the coarsely\nmagnificent order. Her forehead was low and of great width; her nose\nwas well shapen, and had large sensual apertures; her cruel lips may be\nseen on certain fine antique busts; the neck that supported her heavy\nhead was splendidly rounded. In laughing, she became a model for an\nartist, an embodiment of fierce life independent of morality. Her\nhealth was probably less sound than it seemed to be; one would have\ncompared her, not to some piece of exuberant normal vegetation, but\nrather to a rank, evilly-fostered growth. The putrid soil of that\nnether world yields other forms besides the obviously blighted and\nsapless.\n\n'Have you done any work for Mrs. Hewett to-day?' she asked of her\nvictim, after sufficiently savouring the spectacle of terror.\n\n'Yes, miss; I did the front-room fireplace, an' fetched fourteen of\ncoals, an' washed out a few things.'\n\n'What did she give you?'\n\n'A penny, miss. I gave it to Mrs. Peckover before she went.'\n\n'Oh, you did? Well, look 'ere; you'll just remember in future that all\nyou get from the lodgers belongs to me, an' not to mother. It's a new\narrangement, understand. An' if you dare to give up a 'apenny to\nmother, I'll lick you till you're nothin' but a bag o' bones.\nUnderstand?'\n\nHaving on the spur of the moment devised this ingenious difficulty for\nthe child, who was sure to suffer in many ways from such a conflict of\nauthorities, Clem began to consider how she should spend her evening.\nAfter all, Jane was too poor-spirited a victim to afford long\nentertainment. Clem would have liked dealing with some one who showed\nfight--some one with whom she could try savage issue in real\ntooth-and-claw conflict. She had in mind a really exquisite piece of\ncruelty, but it was a joy necessarily postponed to a late hour of the\nnight. In the meantime, it would perhaps be as well to take a stroll,\nwith a view of meeting a few friends as they came away from the\nwork-rooms. She was pondering the invention of some long and hard task\nto be executed by Jane in her absence, when a knocking at the\nhouse-door made itself heard. Clem at once went up to see who the\nvisitor was.\n\nA woman in a long cloak and a showy bonnet stood on the step,\nprotecting herself with an umbrella from the bitter sleet which the\nwind was now driving through the darkness. She said that she wished to\nsee Mrs. Hewett.\n\n'Second-floor front,' replied Clem in the offhand, impertinent tone\nwherewith she always signified to strangers her position in the house.\n\nThe visitor regarded her with a look of lofty contempt, and, having\ndeliberately closed her umbrella, advanced towards the stairs. Clem\ndrew into the back regions for a few moments, but as soon as she heard\nthe closing of a door in the upper part of the house, she too ascended,\ngoing on tip-toe, with a noiselessness which indicated another side of\nher character. Having reached the room which the visitor had entered,\nshe brought her ear close to the keyhole, and remained in that attitude\nfor a long time--nearly twenty minutes, in fact. Her sudden and swift\nreturn to the foot of the stairs was followed by the descent of the\nwoman in the showy bonnet.\n\n'Miss Peckover!' cried the latter when she had reached the foot of the\nstairs.\n\n'Well, what is it?' asked Clem, seeming to come up from the kitchen.\n\n'Will you 'ave the goodness to go an' speak to Mrs. Hewett for a\nhinstant?' said the woman, with much affectation of refined speech.\n\n'All right! I will just now, if I've time.'\n\nThe visitor tossed her head and departed, whereupon Clem at once ran\nupstairs. In five minutes she was back in the kitchen.\n\n'See 'ere,' she addressed Jane. 'You know where Mr. Kirkwood works in\nSt. John's Square? You've been before now. Well, you're to go an' wait\nat the door till he comes out, and then you're to tell him to come to\nMrs. Hewett at wunst. Understand?--Why ain't these tea-things all\ncleared away? All right! Wait till you come back, that's all. Now be\noff, before I skin you alive!'\n\nOn the floor in a corner of the kitchen lay something that had once\nbeen a girl's hat. This Jane at once snatched up and put on her head.\nWithout other covering, She ran forth upon her errand.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nA FRIEND IN REQUEST\n\nIt was the hour of the unyoking of men. In the highways and byways of\nClerkenwell there was a thronging of released toilers, of young and\nold, of male and female. Forth they streamed from factories and\nworkrooms, anxious to make the most of the few hours during which they\nmight live for themselves. Great numbers were still bent over their\nlabour, and would be for hours to come, but the majority had leave to\nwend stablewards. Along the main thoroughfares the wheel-track was\nclangorous; every omnibus that clattered by was heavily laden with\npassengers; tarpaulins gleamed over the knees of those who sat outside.\nThis way and that the lights were blurred into a misty radiance;\noverhead was mere blackness, whence descended the lashing rain. There\nwas a ceaseless scattering of mud; there were blocks in the traffic,\nattended with rough jest or angry curse; there was jostling on the\ncrowded pavement. Public-houses began to brighten up, to bestir\nthemselves for the evening's business. Streets that had been hives of\nactivity since early morning were being abandoned to silence and\ndarkness and the sweeping wind.\n\nAt noon to-day there was sunlight on the Surrey hills; the fields and\nlanes were fragrant with the first breath of spring, and from the\nshelter of budding copses many a primrose looked tremblingly up to the\nvision of blue sky. But of these things Clerkenwell takes no count;\nhere it had been a day like any other, consisting of so many hours,\neach representing a fraction of the weekly wage. Go where you may in\nClerkenwell, on every hand are multiform evidences of toil, intolerable\nas a nightmare. It is not as in those parts of London where the main\nthoroughfares consist of shops and warehouses and workrooms, whilst the\nstreets that are hidden away on either hand are devoted in the main to\ndwellings Here every alley is thronged with small industries; all but\nevery door and window exhibits the advertisement of a craft that is\ncarried on within. Here you may see how men have multiplied toil for\ntoil's sake, have wrought to devise work superfluous, have worn their\nlives away in imagining new forms of weariness. The energy, the\ningenuity daily put forth in these grimy burrows task the brain's power\nof wondering. But that those who sit here through the livelong day,\nthrough every season, through all the years of the life that is granted\nthem, who strain their eyesight, who overtax their muscles, who nurse\ndisease in their frames, who put resolutely from them the thought of\nwhat existence _might_ be--that these do it all without prospect or\nhope of reward save the permission to eat and sleep and bring into the\nworld other creatures to strive with them for bread, surely that\nthought is yet more marvellous.\n\nWorkers in metal, workers in glass and in enamel, workers in weed,\nworkers in every substance on earth, or from the waters under the\nearth, that can be made commercially valuable. In Clerkenwell the\ndemand is not so much for rude strength as for the cunning fingers and\nthe contriving brain. The inscriptions on the house-fronts would make\nyou believe that you were in a region of gold and silver and precious\nstones. In the recesses of dim byways, where sunshine and free air are\nforgotten things, where families herd together in dear-rented garrets\nand cellars, craftsmen are for ever handling jewellery, shaping bright\nornaments for the necks and arms of such as are born to the joy of\nlife. Wealth inestimable is ever flowing through these workshops, and\nthe hands that have been stained with gold-dust may, as likely as not,\nsome day extend themselves in petition for a crust. In this house, as\nthe announcement tells you, business is carried on by a trader in\ndiamonds, and next door is a den full of children who wait for their\nday's one meal until their mother has come home with her chance\nearnings. A strange enough region wherein to wander and muse.\nInextinguishable laughter were perchance the fittest result of such\nmusing; yet somehow the heart grows heavy, somehow the blood is\ntroubled in its course, and the pulses begin to throb hotly.\n\nAmid the crowds of workpeople, Jane Snowdon made what speed she might.\nIt was her custom, whenever dispatched on an errand, to run till she\ncould run no longer, then to hasten along panting until breath and\nstrength were recovered. When it was either of the Peckovers who sent\nher, she knew that reprimand was inevitable on her return, be she ever\nso speedy; but her nature was incapable alike of rebellion and of that\nsullen callousness which would have come to the aid of most girls in\nher position. She did not serve her tyrants with willingness, for their\nbrutality filled her with a sense of injustice; yet the fact that she\nwas utterly dependent upon them for her livelihood, that but for their\ngrace--as they were perpetually reminding her--she would have been a\nworkhouse child, had a mitigating effect upon the bitterness she could\nnot wholly subdue.\n\nThere was, however, another reason why she sped eagerly on her present\nmission. The man to whom she was conveying Mrs. Hewett's message was\none of the very few persons who had ever treated her with human\nkindness. She had known him by name and by sight for some years, and\nsince her mother's death (she was eleven when that happened) he had by\ndegrees grown to represent all that she understood by the word\n'friend.' It was seldom that words were exchanged between them; the\nopportunity came scarcely oftener than once a month; but whenever it\ndid come, it made a bright moment in her existence. Once before she had\nfetched him of an evening to see Mrs. Hewett, and as they walked\ntogether he had spoken with what seemed to her wonderful gentleness,\nwith consideration inconceivable from a tall, bearded man,\nwell-dressed, and well to do in the world. Perhaps he would speak in\nthe same way to-night; the thought of it made her regardless of the\ncold rain that was drenching her miserable garment, of the wind that\nnow and then, as she turned a corner, took away her breath, and made\nher cease from running.\n\nShe reached St. John's Square, and paused at length by a door on which\nwas the inscription: 'H. Lewis, Working Jeweller.' It was just possible\nthat the men had already left; she waited for several minutes with\nanxious mind. No; the door opened, and two workmen came forth. Jane's\neagerness impelled her to address one of them.\n\n'Please, sir, Mr. Kirkwood hasn't gone yet, has he?'\n\n'No, he ain't,' the man answered pleasantly; and turning back, he\ncalled to some one within the doorway; 'Hello, Sidney! here's your\nsweetheart waiting for you.'\n\nJane shrank aside; but in a moment she saw a familiar figure; she\nadvanced again, and eagerly delivered her message.\n\n'All right, Jane! I'll walk on with you,' was the reply. And whilst the\nother two men were laughing good-naturedly, Kirkwood strode away by the\ngirl's side. He seemed to be absent-minded, and for some hundred yards'\ndistance was silent; then he stopped of a sudden and looked down at his\ncompanion.\n\n'Why, Jane,' he said, 'you'll get your death, running about in weather\nlike this.' He touched her dress. 'I thought so; you're wet through.'\n\nThere followed an inarticulate growl, and immediately he stripped off\nhis short overcoat.\n\n'Here, put this on, right over your head. Do as I tell you, child!'\n\nHe seemed impatient to-night. Wasn't he going to talk with her as\nbefore? Jane felt her heart sinking. With her hunger for kind and\ngentle words, she thought nothing of the character of the night, and\nthat Sidney Kirkwood might reasonably be anxious to get over the ground\nas quickly as possible.\n\n'How is Mrs. Hewett?' Sidney asked, when they were walking on again.\n'Still poorly, eh? And the baby?'\n\nThen he was again mute. Jane had something she wished to say to\nhim--wished very much indeed, yet she felt it would have been difficult\neven if he had encouraged her. As he kept silence and walked so\nquickly, speech on her part was utterly forbidden. Kirkwood, however,\nsuddenly remembered that his strides were disproportionate to the\nchild's steps. She was an odd figure thus disguised in his over-jacket;\nhe caught a glimpse of her face by a street lamp, and smiled, but with\na mixture of pain.\n\n'Feel a bit warmer so?' he asked.\n\n'Oh yes, sir.'\n\n'Haven't you got a jacket, Jane?'\n\n'It's all to pieces, sir. They're goin' to have it mended, I think.'\n\n'They' was the word by which alone Jane ventured to indicate her aunt.\n\n'Going to, eh? I think they'd better be quick about it.'\n\nHa! that was the old tone of kindness! How it entered into her blood\nand warmed it! She allowed herself one quick glance at him.\n\n'Do I walk too quick for you?'\n\n'Oh no, sir. Mr. Kirkwood, please, there's something I--'\n\nThe sentence had, as it were, begun itself, but timidity cut it short.\nSidney stopped and looked at her.\n\n'What? Something you wanted to tell me, Jane?'\n\nHe encouraged her, and at length she made her disclosure. It was of\nwhat had happened in the public-house. The young man listened with much\nattention, walking very slowly. He got her to repeat her second-hand\ndescription of the old man who had been inquiring for people named\nSnowdon.\n\n'To think that you should have been just too late!' he exclaimed with\nannoyance. 'Have you any idea who he was?'\n\n'I can't think, sir,' Jane replied sadly.\n\nSidney took a hopeful tone--thought it very likely that the inquirer\nwould pursue his search with success, being so near the house where\nJane's parents had lived.\n\n'I'll keep my eyes open,' he said. 'Perhaps I might see him. He'd be\neasy to recognise, I should think.'\n\n'And would you tell him, sir,' Jane asked eagerly.\n\n'Why, of course I would. You'd like me to, wouldn't you?'\n\nJane's reply left small doubt on that score. Her companion looked down\nat her again, and said with compassionate gentleness:\n\n'Keep a good heart, Jane. Things'll be better some day, no doubt.'\n\n'Do you think so, sir?'\n\nThe significance of the simple words was beyond all that eloquence\ncould have conveyed. Sidney muttered to himself, as he had done before,\nlike one who is angry. He laid his hand on the child's shoulder for a\nmoment.\n\nA few minutes more, and they were passing along by the prison wall,\nunder the ghastly head, now happily concealed by darkness. Jane stopped\na little short of the house and removed the coat that had so\neffectually sheltered her.\n\n'Thank you, sir,' she said, returning it to Sidney.\n\nHe took it without speaking, and threw it over his arm. At the door,\nnow closed, Jane gave a single knock; they were admitted by Clem, who,\nin regarding Kirkwood, wore her haughtiest demeanour. This young man\nhad never paid homage of any kind to Miss Peckover, and such neglect\nwas by no means what she was used to. Other men who came to the house\ntook every opportunity of paying her broad compliments, and some went\nso far as to offer practical testimony of their admiration. Sidney\nmerely had a 'How do you do, miss?' at her service. Coquetry had failed\nto soften him; Clem accordingly behaved as if he had given her mortal\noffence on some recent occasion. She took care, moreover, to fling a\nfew fierce words at Jane before the latter disappeared into the house.\nThereupon Sidney looked at her sternly; he said nothing, knowing that\ninterference would only result in harsher treatment for the poor little\nslave.\n\n'You know your way upstairs, I b'lieve,' said Clem, as if he were all\nbut a stranger.\n\n'Thank you, I do,' was Sidney's reply.\n\nIndeed he had climbed these stairs innumerable times during the last\nthree years; the musty smells were associated with ever so many bygone\nthoughts and states of feeling; the stains on the wall (had it been\ndaylight), the irregularities of the bare wooden steps, were\nremembrancers of projects and hopes and disappointments. For many\nmonths now every visit had been with heavier heart; his tap at the\nHewetts' door had a melancholy sound to him.\n\nA woman's voice bade him enter. He stepped into a room which was not\ndisorderly or unclean, but presented the chill discomfort of poverty.\nThe principal, almost the only, articles of furniture were a large bed,\na wash-hand stand; a kitchen table, and two or three chairs, of which\nthe cane seats were bulged and torn. A few meaningless pictures hung\nhere and there, and on the mantel-piece, which sloped forward somewhat,\nstood some paltry ornaments, secured in their places by a piece of\nstring stretched in front of them. The living occupants were four\nchildren and their mother. Two little girls, six and seven years old\nrespectively, were on the floor near the fire; a boy of four was\nplaying with pieces of fire-wood at the table. The remaining child was\nan infant, born but a fortnight ago, lying at its mother's breast. Mrs.\nHewett sat on the bed, and bent forward in an attitude of physical\nweakness. Her age was twenty-seven, but she looked several years older.\nAt nineteen she had married; her husband, John Hewett, having two\nchildren by a previous union. Her face could never have been very\nattractive, but it was good-natured, and wore its pleasantest aspect as\nshe smiled on Sidney's entrance. You would have classed her at once\nwith those feeble-willed, weak-minded, yet kindly-disposed women, who\nare only too ready to meet affliction half-way, and who, if\ncircumstances be calamitous, are more harmful than an enemy to those\nthey hold dear. She was rather wrapped up than dressed, and her hair,\nthin and pale-coloured, was tied in a ragged knot. She wore slippers,\nthe upper parts of which still adhered to the soles only by miracle. It\nlooked very much as if the same relation subsisted between her frame\nand the life that informed it, for there was no blood in her cheeks, no\nlustre in her eye. The baby at her bosom moaned in the act of sucking;\none knew not how the poor woman could supply sustenance to another\nbeing.\n\nThe children were not dirty nor uncared for, but their clothing hung\nvery loosely upon them; their flesh was unhealthy, their voices had an\nunnatural sound.\n\nSidney stepped up to the bed and gave his hand.\n\n'I'm so glad you've come before Clara,' said Mrs. Hewett. 'I hoped you\nwould. But she can't be long, an' I want to speak to you first. It's a\nbad night, isn't it? Yes, I feel it in my throat, and it goes right\nthrough my chest--just 'ere, look! And I haven't slep' not a hour a\nnight this last week; it makes me feel that low. I want to get to the\nOrspital, if I can, in a day or two.'\n\n'But doesn't the doctor come still?' asked Sidney, drawing a chair near\nto her.\n\n'Well, I didn't think it was right to go on payin' him, an' that's the\ntruth. I'll go to the Orspital, an' they'll give me somethin'. I look\nbad, don't I, Sidney?'\n\n'You look as if you'd no business to be out of bed,' returned the young\nman in a grumbling voice.\n\n'Oh, I _can't_ lie still, so it's no use talkin'! But see, I want to\nspeak about Clara. That woman Mrs. Tubbs has been here to see me,\ntalkin' an' talkin'. She says she'll give Clara five shillin' a week,\nas well as board an' lodge her. I don't know what to do about it, that\nI don't. Clara, she's that set on goin', an' her father's that set\nagainst it. It seems as if it 'ud be a good thing, don't it, Sidney? I\nknow _you_ don't want her to go, but what's to be done? What _is_ to be\ndone?'\n\nHer wailing voice caused the baby to wail likewise. Kirkwood looked\nabout the room with face set in anxious discontent.\n\n'Is it no use, Mrs. Hewett?' he exclaimed suddenly, turning to her.\n'Does she mean it? Won't she ever listen to me?'\n\nThe woman shook her head miserably; her eyes filled with tears.\n\n'I've done all I could,' she replied, half sobbing. 'I have; you know I\nhave, Sidney! She's that 'eadstrong, it seems as if she wouldn't listen\nto nobody--at least nobody as we knows anything about.'\n\n'What do you mean by that?' he inquired abruptly. 'Do you think there's\nany one else?'\n\n'How can I tell? I've got no reason for thinkin' it, but how can I\ntell? No, I believe it's nothin' but her self-will an' the fancies\nshe's got into her 'ead. Both her an' Bob, there's no doin' nothin'\nwith them. Bob, he's that wasteful with his money; an' now he talks\nabout goin' an' gettin' a room in another 'ouse, when he might just as\nwell make all the savin' he can. But no, that ain't his idea, nor yet\nhis sister's. I suppose it's their mother as they take after, though\ntheir father he won't own to it, an' I don't blame him for not speakin'\nill of her as is gone. I should be that wretched if I thought my own\nwas goin' to turn out the same. But there's John, he ain't a wasteful\nman; no one can't say it of him. He's got his fancies, but they've\nnever made him selfish to others, as well you know, Sidney. He's been\nthe best 'usband to me as ever a poor woman had, an' I'll say it with\nmy last breath.'\n\nShe cried pitifully for a few moments. Sidney, mastering his own\nwretchedness, which he could not altogether conceal, made attempts to\nstrengthen her.\n\n'When things are at the worst they begin to mend,' he said. 'It can't\nbe much longer before he gets work. And look here, Mrs. Hewett, I won't\nhear a word against it; you must and shall let me lend you something to\ngo on with!'\n\n'I dursn't, I dursn't, Sidney! John won't have it. He's always\na-saying: \"Once begin that, an' it's all up; you never earn no more of\nyour own.\" It's one of his fancies, an' you know it is. You'll only\nmake trouble, Sidney.'\n\n'Well, all I can say is, he's an unreasonable and selfish man!'\n\n'No, no; John ain't selfish! Never say that! It's only his fancies,\nSidney.'\n\n'Well, there's one trouble you'd better get rid of, at all events. Let\nClara go to Mrs. Tubbs. You'll never have any peace till she does, I\ncan see that. Why shouldn't she go, after all? She's seventeen; if she\ncan't respect herself now, she never will, and there's no help for it.\nTell John to let her go.'\n\nThere was bitterness in the tone with which he gave this advice; he\nthrew out his hands impatiently, and then flung himself back, so that\nthe cranky chair creaked and tottered.\n\n'An' if 'arm comes to her, what then?' returned Mrs. Hewett\nplaintively. 'We know well enough why Mrs. Tubbs wants her; it's only\nbecause she's good-lookin', an' she'll bring more people to the bar.\nJohn knows that, an' it makes him wild. Mind what I'm tellin' you,\nSidney; if any 'arm comes to that girl, her father'll go out of his\n'ead. I know he will! I know he will! He worships the ground as she\nwalks on, an' if it hadn't been for that, she'd never have given him\nthe trouble as she is doin'. It 'ud a been better for her if she'd had\na father like mine, as was a hard, careless man. I don't wish to say no\n'arm of him as is dead an' buried, an' my own father too, but he was a\nhard father to us, an' as long as he lived we dursn't say not a word as\nhe didn't like. He'd a killed me if I'd gone on like Clara. It was a\ngood thing as he was gone, before--'\n\n'Don't, don't speak of that,' interposed Kirkwood, with kindly\nfirmness. 'That's long since over and done with and forgotten.'\n\n'No, no; not forgotten. Clara knows, an' that's partly why she makes so\nlittle of me; I know it is.'\n\n'I don't believe it! She's a good-hearted girl--'\n\nA heavy footstep on the stairs checked him. The door was thrown open,\nand there entered a youth of nineteen, clad as an artisan. He was a\nshapely fellow, though not quite so stout as perfect health would have\nmade him, and had a face of singular attractiveness,\nclear-complexioned, delicate featured, a-gleam with intelligence. The\nintelligence was perhaps even too pronounced; seen in profile, the\ncountenance had an excessive eagerness; there was selfish force about\nthe lips, moreover, which would have been better away. His noisy\nentrance indicated an impulsive character, and the nod with which he\ngreeted Kirkwood was self-sufficient.\n\n'Where's that medal I cast last night, mother?' he asked, searching in\nvarious corners of the room and throwing things about.\n\n'Now, do mind what you're up to, Bob!' remonstrated Mrs. Hewett.\n'You'll find it on the mantel in the other room. Don't make such a\nnoise.'\n\nThe young man rushed forth, and in a moment returned. In his hand,\nwhich was very black, and shone as if from the manipulation of metals,\nhe held a small bright medal. He showed it to Sidney, saying, 'What\nd'you think o' that?'\n\nThe work was delicate and of clever design; it represented a racehorse\nat full speed, a jockey rising in the stirrups and beating it with\northodox brutality.\n\n'That's \"Tally-ho\" at the Epsom Spring Meetin',' he said. 'I've got\nmoney on him!'\n\nAnd, with another indifferent nod, he flung out of the room.\n\nBefore Mrs. Hewett and Kirkwood could renew their conversation, there\nwas another step at the door, and the father of the family presented\nhimself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nA SUPERFLUOUS FAMILY\n\nKirkwood's face, as he turned to greet the new-comer, changed suddenly\nto an expression of surprise.\n\n'Why, what have you been doing to your hair?' he asked abruptly.\n\nA stranger would have seen nothing remarkable in John Hewett's hair,\nunless he had reflected that, being so sparse, it had preserved its\ndark hue and its gloss somewhat unusually. The short beard and whiskers\nwere also of richer colour than comported with the rest of the man's\nappearance. Judging from his features alone, one would have taken John\nfor sixty at least; his years were in truth not quite two-and-fifty. He\nhad the look of one worn out with anxiety and hardship; the lines\nengraven upon his face were of extraordinary depth and frequency; there\nseemed to be little flesh between the dry skin and the bones which\nsharply outlined his visage. The lips were, like those of his son,\nprominent and nervous, but none of Bob's shrewdness was here\ndiscoverable; feeling rather than intellect appeared to be the father's\ncharacteristic. His eyes expressed self-will, perhaps obstinacy, and he\nhad a peculiarly dogged manner of holding his head. At the present\nmoment he was suffering from extreme fatigue; he let himself sink upon\na chair, threw his hat on to the floor, and rested a hand on each knee.\nHis boots were thickly covered with mud; his corduroy trousers were\nsplashed with the same. Rain had drenched him; it trickled to the floor\nfrom all his garments.\n\nFor answer to Sidney's question, he nodded towards his wife, and said\nin a thick voice, 'Ask her.'\n\n'He's dyed it,' Mrs. Hewett explained, with no smile. 'He thought one\nof the reasons why he couldn't get work was his lookin' too old.'\n\n'An' so it was,' exclaimed Hewett, with an angry vehemence which at\nonce declared his position and revealed much of his history. 'So it was.\nMy hair was a bit turned, an' nowadays there's no chance for old men.\nAsk any one you like. Why, there's Sam Lang couldn't even get a job at\ngardenin' 'cause his hair was a bit turned. It was him as told me what\nto do. \"Dye your hair, Jack,\" he says; \"it's what I've had to myself,\"\nhe says. \"They won't have old men nowadays, at no price.\" Why, there's\nJarvey the painter; you know him, Sidney. His guvnor sent him on a job\nto Jones's place, an' they sent him back. \"Why, he's an old man,\" they\nsays. \"What good's a man of that age for liftin' ladders about?\" An'\nJarvey's no older than me.'\n\nSidney knitted his brows. He had heard the complaint from too many men\nto be able to dispute its justice.\n\n'When there's twice too many of us for the work that's to be done,'\npursued John, 'what else can you expect? The old uns have to give way,\nof course. Let 'em beg; let 'em starve! What use are they?'\n\nMrs. Hewett had put a kettle on the fire, and began to arrange the\ntable for a meal.\n\n'Go an' get your wet things off, John,' she said. 'You'll be havin'\nyour rheumatics again.'\n\n'Never mind me, Maggie. What business have you to be up an' about? You\nneed a good deal more takin' care of than I do. Here, let Amy get the\ntea.'\n\nThe three children, Amy, Annie, and Tom, had come forward, as only\nchildren do who are wont to be treated affectionately on their father's\nreturn. John had a kiss and a caress for each of them; then he stepped\nto the bed and looked at his latest born. The baby was moaning feebly;\nhe spoke no word to it, and on turning away glanced about the room\nabsently. In the meantime his wife had taken some clothing from a chest\nof drawers, and at length he was persuaded to go into the other room\nand change. When he returned, the meal was ready. It consisted of a\nscrap of cold steak, left over from yesterday, and still upon the\noriginal dish amid congealed fat; a spongy half-quartern loaf, that\nspecies of baker's bread of which a great quantity can be consumed with\nsmall effect on the appetite; a shapeless piece of something purchased\nunder the name of butter, dabbed into a shallow basin; some pickled\ncabbage in a tea-cup; and, lastly, a pot of tea, made by adding a\nteaspoonful or two to the saturated leaves which had already served at\nbreakfast and mid-day. This repast was laid on a very dirty cloth. The\ncups were unmatched and chipped, the knives were in all stages of\ndecrepitude; the teapot was of dirty tin, with a damaged spout.\n\nSidney began to affect cheerfulness. He took little Annie on one of his\nknees, and Tom on the other. The mature Amy presided. Hewett ate the\nmorsel of meat, evidently without thinking about it; he crumbled a\npiece of bread, and munched mouthfuls in silence. Of the vapid liquor\ncalled tea he drank cup after cup.\n\n'What's the time?' he asked at length. 'Where's Clara?'\n\n'I daresay she's doin' overtime,' replied his wife. 'She won't be much\nlonger.'\n\nThe man was incapable of remaining in one spot for more than a few\nminutes. Now he went to look at the baby; now he stirred the fire; now\nhe walked across the room aimlessly. He was the embodiment of worry. As\nsoon as the meal was over, Amy, Annie, and Tom were sent off to bed.\nThey occupied the second room, together with Clara; Bob shared the bed\nof a fellow-workman upstairs. This was great extravagance, obviously;\nother people would have made two rooms sufficient for all, and many\nsuch families would have put up with one. But Hewett had his ideas of\ndecency, and stuck to them with characteristic wilfulness.\n\n'Where do you think I've been this afternoon?' John began, when the\nthree little ones were gone, and Mrs. Hewett had been persuaded to lie\ndown upon the bed. 'Walked to Enfleld an' back. I was told of a job out\nthere; but it's no good; they're full up. They say exercise is good for\nthe 'ealth. I shall be a 'ealthy man before long, it seems to me. What\ndo _you_ think?'\n\n'Have you been to see Corder again?' asked Sidney, after reflecting\nanxiously.\n\n'No, I haven't!' was the angry reply; 'an' what's more, I ain't goin'\nto! He's one o' them men I can't get on with. As long as you make\nyourself small before him, an' say \"sir\" to him with every other word,\nan' keep tellin' him as he's your Providence on earth, an' as you don't\nknow how ever you'd get on without him--well, it's all square, an'\nhe'll keep you on the job. That's just what I _can't_ do--never could,\nan' never shall. I should have to hear them children cryin' for food\nbefore I could do it. So don't speak to me about Corder again. It makes\nme wild!'\n\nSidney tapped the floor with his foot. Himself a single man, without\nresponsibilities, always in fairly good work, he could not invariably\nsympathise with Hewett's sore and impracticable pride. His own temper\ndid not err in the direction of meekness, but as he looked round the\nroom he felt that a home such as this would drive him to any degree of\nhumiliation. John knew what the young man's thoughts were; he resumed\nin a voice of exasperated bitterness.\n\n'No, I haven't been to Corder--I beg his pardon; _Mister_ Corder--James\nCorder, Esquire. But where do you think I went this mornin'? Mrs.\nPeckover brought up a paper an' showed me an advertisement. Gorbutt in\nGoswell Bead wanted a man to clean windows an' sweep up, an' so\non;--offered fifteen bob a week. Well, I went. Didn't I, mother? Didn't\nI go after that job? I got there at half-past eight; an' what do you\nthink I found? If there was one man standin' at Gorbutt's door, _there\nwas five hundred_! Don't you believe me? You go an' ask them as lives\nabout there. If there was one, there was five hundred! Why, the p'lice\nhad to come an' keep the road clear. Fifteen bob! What was the use o' me\nstandin' there, outside the crowd? What was the use, I say? Such a lot\no' poor starvin' devils you never saw brought together in all your\nlife. There they was, lookin' ready to fight with one another for the\nfifteen bob a week. Didn't I come back and tell you about it, mother?\nAn' if they'd all felt like me, they'd a turned against the shop an'\nsmashed it up--ay, an' every other shop in the street! What use? Why,\nno use; but I tell you that's how I felt. If any man had said as much\nas a rough word to me, I'd a gone at him like a bulldog. I felt like a\nbeast. I wanted to fight, I tell you--to fight till the life was kicked\nan' throttled out of me!'\n\n'John, don't, don't go on in that way,' cried his wife, sobbing\nmiserably. 'Don't let him go on like that, Sidney.'\n\nHewett jumped up and walked about.\n\n'What's the time?' he asked the next moment. And when Sidney told him\nthat it was half-past nine, he exclaimed, 'Then why hasn't Clara come\n'ome? What's gone with her?'\n\n'Perhaps she's at Mrs. Tubbs's,' replied his wife, in a low voice,\nlooking at Kirkwood.\n\n'An' what call has she to be there? Who gave her leave to go there?'\n\nThere was another exchange of looks between Sidney and Mrs. Hewett;\nthen the latter with hesitation and timidity told of Mrs. Tubbs's visit\nto her that evening, and of the proposals the woman had made.\n\n'I won't hear of it:' cried John. 'I won't have my girl go for a\nbarmaid, so there's an end of it. I tell you she shan't go!'\n\n'I can understand you, Mr. Hewett,' said Sidney, in a tone of argument\nsoftened by deference; 'but don't you think you'd better make a few\ninquiries, at all events? You see, it isn't exactly a barmaid's place.\nI mean to say, Mrs. Tubbs doesn't keep a public-house where people\nstand about drinking all day. It is only a luncheon-bar, and\nrespectable enough.'\n\nJohn turned and regarded him with astonishment.\n\n'Why, I thought you was as much set against it as me? What's made you\ncome round like this? I s'pose you've got tired of her, an' that's made\nyou so you don't care.'\n\nThe young man's eyes flashed angrily, but before he could make a\nrejoinder Mrs. Hewett interposed.\n\n'For shame o' yourself, John. If you can't talk better sense than that,\ndon't talk at all. He don't mean it, Sidney. He's half drove off his\nhead with trouble.'\n\n'If he does think it,' said Kirkwood, speaking sternly but with\nself-command, 'let him say what he likes. He can't say worse than I\nshould deserve.'\n\nThere was an instant of silence. Hewett's head hung with more than the\nusual doggedness. Then he addressed Sidney, sullenly, but in a tone\nwhich admitted his error.\n\n'What have you got to say? Never mind me. I'm only the girl's father,\nan' there's not much heed paid to fathers nowadays. What have you got\nto say about Clara? If you've changed your mind about her goin' there,\njust tell me why.'\n\nSidney could not bring himself to speak at once, but an appealing look\nfrom Mrs. Hewett decided him.\n\n'Look here, Mr. Hewett,' he began, with blunt earnestness. If any harm\ncame to Clara I should feel it every bit as much as you, and that you\nought to know by this time. All the same, what I've got to say is this:\nLet her go to Mrs. Tubbs for a month's trial. If you persist in\nrefusing her, mark my words, you'll be sorry. I've thought it all over,\nand I know what I'm talking about. The girl can't put up with the work\nroom any longer. It's ruining her health, for one thing, anybody can\nsee that, and it's making her so discontented, she'll soon get\nreckless. I understand your feeling well enough, but I understand her\nas well; at all events, I believe I do. She wants a change; she's\ngetting tired of her very life.'\n\n'Very well,' cried the father in shrill irritation, 'why doesn't she\ntake the change that's offered to her? She's no need to go neither to\nworkroom nor to bar. There's a good home waiting for her, isn't there?\nWhat's come to the girl? She used to go on as if she liked you well\nenough.'\n\n'A girl alters a deal between fifteen and seventeen,' Sidney replied,\nforcing himself to speak with an air of calmness, of impartiality. 'She\nwasn't old enough to know her own mind. I'm tired of plaguing her. I\nfeel ashamed to say another word to her, and that's the truth. She only\ngets more and more set against me. If it's ever to come right, it'll\nhave to be by waiting; we won't talk about that any more. Think of her\nquite apart from me, and what I've been hoping. She's seventeen years\nold. You can't deal with a girl of that age like you can with Amy and\nAnnie. You'll have to trust her, Mr. Hewett. You'll have to, because\nthere's no help for it. We're working people, we are; we're the lower\norders; our girls have to go out and get their livings. We teach them\nthe best we can, and the devil knows they've got examples enough of\nmisery and ruin before their eyes to help them to keep straight. Rich\npeople can take care of their daughters as much as they like; they can\ntreat them like children till they're married; people of our kind can't\ndo that, and it has to be faced.'\n\nJohn sat with dark brow, his eyes staring on vacancy.\n\n'It's right what Sidney says, father,' put in Mrs. Hewett; 'we can't\nhelp it.'\n\n'You may perhaps have done harm when you meant only to do good,'\npursued Sidney. 'Always being so anxious, and showing what account you\nmake of her, perhaps you've led her to think a little too much of\nherself. She knows other fathers don't go on in that way. And now she\nwants more freedom, she feels it worse than other girls do when you\nbegin to deny her. Talk to her in a different way; talk as if you\ntrusted her. Depend upon it, it's the only hold you have upon her.\nDon't be so much afraid. Clara has her faults--I see them as well as any\none--but I'll never believe she'd darken your life of her own free\nwill.'\n\nThere was an unevenness, a jerky vehemence, in his voice, which told\nhow difficult it was for him to take this side in argument. He often\nhesitated, obviously seeking phrases which should do least injury to\nthe father's feelings. The expression of pain on his forehead and about\nhis lips testified to the sincerity with which he urged his views, at\nthe same time to a lurking fear lest impulse should be misleading him.\nHewett kept silence, in aspect as far as ever from yielding. Of a\nsudden he raised his hand, and said, 'Husht!' There was a familiar step\non the stairs. Then the door opened and admitted Clara.\n\nThe girl could not but be aware that the conversation she interrupted\nhad reference to herself. Her father gazed fixedly at her; Sidney\nglanced towards her with self-consciousness, and at once averted his\neyes; Mrs. Hewett examined her with apprehension. Having carelessly\nclosed the door with a push, she placed her umbrella in the corner and\nbegan to unbutton her gloves. Her attitude was one of affected\nunconcern; she held her head stiffly, and let her eyes wander to the\nfarther end of the room. The expression of her face was cold,\npreoccupied; she bit her lower lip so that the under part of it\nprotruded.\n\n'Where have you been, Clara?' her father asked.\n\nShe did not answer immediately, but finished drawing off her gloves and\nrolled them up by turning one over the other. Then she said\nindifferently:\n\n'I've been to see Mrs. Tubbs.'\n\n'And who gave you leave?' asked Hewett with irritation.\n\n'I don't see that I needed any leave. I knew she was coming here to\nspeak to you or mother, so I went, after work, to ask what you'd said.'\n\nShe was not above the middle stature of women, but her slimness and\nerectness, and the kind of costume she wore made her seem tall as she\nstood in this low-ceiled room. Her features were of very uncommon type,\nat once sensually attractive and bearing the stamp of intellectual\nvigour. The profile was cold, subtle, original; in full face, her high\ncheekbones and the heavy, almost horizontal line of her eyebrows were\nthe points that first drew attention, conveying an idea of force of\ncharacter. The eyes themselves were hazel-coloured, and, whatever her\nmood, preserved a singular pathos of expression, a look as of\nself-pity, of unconscious appeal against some injustice. In contrast\nwith this her lips were defiant, insolent, unscrupulous; a shadow of\nthe naivete of childhood still lingered upon them, but, though you\ndivined the earlier pout of the spoilt girl, you felt that it must have\nforetold this danger-signal in the mature woman. Such cast of\ncountenance could belong only to one who intensified in her personality\nan inheritance of revolt; who, combining the temper of an ambitious\nwoman with the forces of a man's brain, had early learnt that the world\nwas not her friend nor the world's law.\n\nHer clothing made but poor protection against the rigours of a London\nwinter. Its peculiarity (bearing in mind her position) was the lack of\nany pretended elegance. A close-fitting, short jacket of plain cloth\nmade evident the grace of her bust; beneath was a brown dress with one\nrow of kilting. She wore a hat of brown felt, the crown rising from\nback to front, the narrow brim closely turned up all round. The high\ncollar of the jacket alone sheltered her neck. Her gloves, though worn,\nwere obviously of good kid; her boots--strangest thing of all in a\nwork-girl's daily attire--were both strong and shapely. This simplicity\nseemed a declaration that she could not afford genuine luxuries and\nscorned to deck herself with shams.\n\nThe manner of her reply inflamed Hewett with impotent wrath. He smote\nthe table violently, then sprang up and flung his chair aside.\n\n'Is that the way you've learnt to speak to your father?' he shouted.\n'Haven't I told you you're not to go nowhere without my leave or your\nmother's? Do you pay no heed to what I bid you? If so, say it! Say it\nat once, and have done with it.'\n\nClara was quietly removing her hat. In doing so, she disclosed the one\nthing which gave proof of regard for personal appearance. Her hair was\nelaborately dressed. Drawn up from the neck, it was disposed in thick\nplaits upon the top of her head; in front were a few rows of crisping.\nShe affected to be quite unaware that words had been spoken to her, and\nstood smoothing each side of her forehead.\n\nJohn strode forward and laid his hands roughly upon her shoulders.\n\n'Look at me, will you? Speak, will you?'\n\nClara jerked herself from his grasp and regarded him with insolent\nsurprise. Of fear there was no trace upon her countenance; she seemed\nto experience only astonishment at such unwonted behaviour from her\nfather, and resentment on her own behalf. Sidney Kirkwood had risen,\nand advanced a step or two, as if in apprehension of harm to the girl,\nbut his interference was unneeded. Hewett recovered his self-control as\nsoon as Clara repelled him. It was the first time he had ever laid a\nhand upon one of his children other than gently; his exasperation came\nof over-tried nerves, of the experiences he had gone through in search\nof work that day, and the keen suffering occasioned by his argument\nwith Sidney. The practical confirmation of Sidney's warning that he\nmust no longer hope to control Clara like a child stung him too\npoignantly; he obeyed an unreasoning impulse to recover his authority\nby force.\n\nThe girl's look entered his heart like a stab; she had never faced him\nlike this before, saying more plainly than with words that she defied\nhim to control her. His child's face, the face he loved best of all!\nyet at this moment he was searching it vainly for the lineaments that\nwere familiar to him. Something had changed her, had hardened her\nagainst him, in a moment. It seemed impossible that there should come\nsuch severance between them. John revolted against it, as against all\nthe other natural laws that visited him harshly.\n\n'What's come to you, my girl?' he said in a thick voice. 'What's wrong\nbetween us, Clara? Haven't I always done my best for you? If I was the\nworst enemy you had, you couldn't look at me crueller.'\n\n'I think it's me that should ask what's come to _you_, father,' she\nreturned with her former self-possession. 'You treat me as if I was a\nbaby. I want to know what you're going to say about Mrs. Tubbs. I\nsuppose mother's told you what she offers me?'\n\nSidney had not resumed his chair. Before Hewett could reply he said:\n\n'I think I'll leave you to talk over this alone.'\n\n'No; stay where you are,' said John gruffly. 'Look here, Clara.\nSidney's been talkin' to me; he's been sayin' that I ought to let you\nhave your own way in this. Yes, you may well look as if it surprised\nyou.' Clara had just glanced at the young man, slightly raising her\neyebrows, but at once looked away again with a careless movement of the\nhead. 'He says what it's hard an' cruel for me to believe, though I\nhalf begin to see that he's right; he says you won't pay no more heed\nto what _I_ wish, an' it's me now must give way to you. I didn't use to\nthink me an' Clara would come to that; but it looks like it--it looks\nlike it.'\n\nThe girl stood with downcast eyes. Once more her face had suffered a\nchange; the lips were no longer malignant, her forehead had relaxed\nfrom its haughty frown. The past fortnight had been a period of contest\nbetween her father's stubborn fears and her own determination to change\nthe mode of her life. Her self-will was only intensified by opposition.\nJohn had often enough experienced this, but hitherto the points at\nissue had been trifles, matters in which the father could yield for the\nsake of pleasing his child. Serious resistance brought out for the\nfirst time all the selfish forces of her nature. She was prepared to go\nall lengths rather than submit, now the question of her liberty had\nonce been broached. Already there was a plan in her mind for quitting\nhome, regardless of all the misery she would cause, reckless of what\nfuture might be in store for herself. But the first sign of yielding on\nher father's part touched the gentler elements of her nature. Thus was\nshe constituted; merciless in egotism when put to the use of all her\nweapons, moved to warmest gratitude as soon as concession was made to\nher. To be on ill terms with her father had caused her pain, the only\neffect of which, however, was to heighten the sullen impracticability\nof her temper. At the first glimpse of relief from overstrained\nemotions, she desired that all angry feeling should be at an end.\nHaving gained her point, she could once more be the affectionately\nwilful girl whose love was the first necessity of John Hewett's\nexistence.\n\n'Well,' John pursued, reading her features eagerly, 'I'll say no more\nabout that, and I won't stand in the way of what you've set your mind\non. But understand, Clara, my girl! It's because Sidney persuaded me.\nSidney answers for it, mind you that!'\n\nHis voice trembled, and he looked at the young man with something like\nanger in his eyes.\n\n'I'm willing to do that, Mr. Hewett,' said Kirkwood in a low but firm\nvoice, his eyes turned away from Clara. 'No human being can answer for\nanother in the real meaning of the word; but I take upon myself to say\nthat Clara will bring you no sorrow. She hears me say it. They're not\nthe kind of words that a man speaks without thought of what they mean.'\n\nClara had seated herself by the table, and was moving a finger along\nthe pattern of the dirty white cloth. She bit her under-lip in the\nmanner already described, seemingly her habit when she wished to avoid\nany marked expression of countenance.\n\n'I can't see what Mr. Kirkwood's got to do with it at all,' she said,\nwith indifference, which now, however, was rather good-humoured than\nthe reverse. 'I'm sure I don't want anybody to answer for _me_.' A\nslight toss of the head. 'You'd have let me go in any case, father; so\nI don't see you need bring Mr. Kirkwood's name in.'\n\nHewett turned away to the fireplace and hung his head. Sidney, gazing\ndarkly at the girl, saw her look towards him, and she smiled. The\nstrange effect of that smile upon her features! It gave gentleness to\nthe mouth, and, by making more manifest the intelligent light of her\neyes, emphasised the singular pathos inseparable from their regard. It\nwas a smile to which a man would concede anything, which would vanquish\nevery prepossession, which would inspire pity and tenderness and\ndevotion in the heart of sternest resentment.\n\nSidney knew its power only too well; he averted his face. Then Clara\nrose again and said:\n\n'I shall just walk round and tell Mrs. Tubbs. It isn't late, and she'd\nlike to know as soon as possible.'\n\n'Oh, surely it'll do in the mornin'!' exclaimed Mrs. Hewett, who had\nfollowed the conversation in silent anxiety.\n\nClara paid no attention, but at once put on her hat again. Then she\nsaid, 'I won't be long, father,' and moved towards the door.\n\nHewett did not look round.\n\n'Will you let me walk part of the way with you?' Sidney asked abruptly.\n\n'Certainly, if you like.'\n\nHe bade the two who remained 'Good-night,' and followed Clara\ndownstairs.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nCLARA AND JANE\n\nRain no longer fell, but the gusty and bitter wind still swept about\nthe black streets. Walking side by side without speech, Clara and her\ncompanion left the neighbourhood of the prison, and kept a northward\ndirection till they reached the junction of highways where stands the\n'Angel.' Here was the wonted crowd of loiterers and the press of people\nwaiting for tramcar or omnibus--east, west, south, or north; newsboys,\neager to get rid of their last batch, were crying as usual, 'Ech-ow!\nExteree speciul! Ech-ow! Steendard!' and a brass band was blaring out\nits saddest strain of merry dance-music. The lights gleamed dismally in\nrain-puddles and on the wet pavement. With the wind came whiffs of\ntobacco and odours of the drinking-bar.\n\nThey crossed, and walked the length of Islington High Street, then a\nshort way along its continuation, Upper Street. Once or twice Clara had\nbarely glanced at Kirkwood, but his eyes made no reply, and his lips\nwere resolutely closed. She did not seem offended by this silence; on\nthe contrary, her face was cheerful, and she smiled to herself now and\nthen. One would have imagined that she found pleasure in the sombreness\nof which she was the cause.\n\nShe stopped at length, and said:\n\n'I suppose you don't want to go in with me?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'Then I'll say good-night. Thank you for coming so far out of your way.'\n\n'I'll wait. I may as well walk back with you, if you don't mind.'\n\n'Oh, very well. I shan't be many minutes.'\n\nShe passed on and entered the place of refreshment that was kept by\nMrs. Tubbs. Till recently it had been an ordinary eating-house or\ncoffee-shop; but having succeeded in obtaining a license to sell strong\nliquors, Mrs. Tubbs had converted the establishment into one of a more\npretentious kind. She called it 'Imperial Restaurant and Luncheon Bar.'\nThe front shone with vermilion paint; the interior was aflare with many\ngas-jets; in the window was disposed a tempting exhibition of 'snacks'\nof fish, cold roast fowls, ham-sandwiches, and the like; whilst farther\nback stood a cooking-stove, whereon frizzled and vapoured a savoury\nmess of sausages and onions.\n\nSidney turned away a few paces. The inclemency of the night made Upper\nStreet--the promenade of a great district on account of its spacious\npavement--less frequented than usual; but there were still numbers of\npeople about, some hastening homewards, some sauntering hither and\nthither in the familiar way, some gathered into gossiping groups.\nKirkwood was irritated by the conversation and laughter that fell on\nhis ears, irritated by the distant strains of the band, irritated above\nall by the fume of frying that pervaded the air for many yards about\nMrs. Tubbs's precincts. He observed that the customers tending that way\nwere numerous. They consisted mainly of lads and young men who had come\nforth from neighbouring places of entertainment. The locality and its\ncharacteristics had been familiar to him from youth upwards; but his\nnature was not subdued to what it worked in, and the present fit of\ndisgust was only an accentuation of a mood by which he was often\npossessed. To the Hewetts he had spoken impartially of Mrs. Tubbs and\nher bar; probably that was the right view; but now there came back upon\nhim the repugnance with which he had regarded Clara's proposal when it\nwas first made.\n\nIt seemed to him that he had waited nearly half an hour when Clara came\nforth again. In silence she walked on beside him. Again they crossed by\nthe 'Angel' and entered St. John Street Road.\n\n'You've made your arrangements?' Sidney said, now that there were few\npeople passing.\n\n'Yes; I shall go on Monday.'\n\n'You're going to live there altogether?'\n\n'Yes; it'll be more convenient, and then it'll give them more room at\nhome. Bob can sleep with the children, and save money.'\n\n'To be sure!' observed the young man with bitter irony.\n\nClara flashed a glance at him. It was a new thing for Sidney to take\nthis tone with her; not seldom he had expressed unfavourable judgments\nby silence, but he had never spoken to her otherwise than with\ndeference and gentleness.\n\n'You don't seem in a very good temper to-night, Mr. Kirkwood.' she\nremarked in a suave tone.\n\nHe disregarded her words, but in a few moments turned upon her and said\nscornfully:\n\n'I hope you'll enjoy the pleasant, ladylike work you've found! I should\nthink it'll improve your self-respect to wait on the gentlemen of Upper\nStreet!'\n\nIrony is not a weapon much in use among working people; their wits in\ngeneral are too slow. With Sidney, however, it had always been a habit\nof speech in indignant criticism, and sympathy made him aware that\nnothing would sting Clara more acutely. He saw that he was successful\nwhen she turned her head away and moved it nervously.\n\n'And do you suppose I go there because the place pleases me?' she asked\nin a cold, hostile voice. 'You make a great mistake, as you always do\nwhen you pretend to know anything about me. Wait till I've learned a\nlittle about the business; you won't find me in Upper Street then.'\n\n'I understand.'\n\nAgain they walked on in silence. They were nearing Clerkenwell Close,\nand had to pass a corner of the prison in a dark lane, where the wind\nmoaned drearily. The line of the high blank wall was relieved in\ncolourless gloom against a sky of sheer night. Opposite, the shapes of\npoverty-eaten houses and grimy workshops stood huddling in the\nobscurity. From near at hand came shrill voices of children chasing\neach other about--children playing at midnight between slum and gaol!\n\n'We're not likely to see much of each other after to-night,' said\nSidney, stopping.\n\n'The less the better, I should say, if this is how you're going to talk\nto me.'\n\n'The less the better, perhaps--at all events for a time. But there's\none or two things on my mind, and I'll say them now. I don't know\nwhether you think anything about it, but you must have seen that things\nare getting worse and worse at home. Your mother--'\n\n'She's no mother of mine!' broke in Clara angrily.\n\n'She's been a mother to you in kindness, that's certain, and you've\nrepaid her almost as ill as you could have done. Another girl would\nhave made her hard life a bit easier. No; you've only thought of\nyourself. Your father walks about day after day trying to get work, and\nhow do you meet him when he comes home? You fret him and anger him; you\nthrow him back ill-tempered words when he happens to think different\nfrom you; you almost break his heart, because you won't give way in\nthings that he only means for your good--he that would give his life\nfor you! It's as well you should hear the truth for once, and hear it\nfrom me, too. Anyone else might speak from all sorts of motives; as for\nme, it makes me suffer more to say such things than it ever could you\nto hear them. Laugh if you like! I don't ask you to pay any heed to\nwhat _I_'ve wished and hoped; but just give a thought to your father,\nand the rest of them at home. I told him to-night he'd only to trust\nyou, that you never could do anything to make him ashamed of you. I\nsaid so, and I believe it. Look, Clara! with all my heart I believe it.\nBut now you've got your way, think of them a little.'\n\n'It isn't your fault if I don't know how bad I am,' said the girl with\na half-smile. That she did not resent his lecture more decidedly was no\ndoubt due to its having afforded new proof of the power she had over\nhim. Sidney was shaken with emotion; his voice all but failed him at\nthe last.\n\n'Good-bye,' he said, turning away.\n\nClara hesitated, looked at him, but finally also said 'Good-bye,' and\nwent on alone.\n\nShe walked with bent head, and almost passed the house-door in absence\nof thought. On the threshold was standing Miss Peckover; she drew aside\nto let Clara pass. Between these two was a singular rivalry. Though by\ndate a year younger than Clara, Clem gave no evidence of being\nphysically less mature. In the matter of personal charms she regarded\nherself as by far Miss Hewett's superior, and resented vigorously the\ntone of the latter's behaviour to her. Clara, on the other hand, looked\ndown upon Miss Peckover as a mere vulgar girl; she despised her brother\nBob because he had allowed himself to be inveigled by Clem; in\nintellect, in social standing, she considered herself out of all\ncomparison with the landlady's daughter. Clem had the obvious advantage\nof being able to ridicule the Hewetts' poverty, and did so without\nsparing. Now, for instance, when Clara was about to pass with a distant\n'Good-night,' Clem remarked:\n\n'It's cold, ain't it? I wonder you don't put on a ulster, a night like\nthis.'\n\n'Thank you,' was the reply. 'I shan't consult you about how I'm to\ndress.'\n\nClem laughed, knowing she had the best of the joke.\n\nThe other went upstairs, and entered the back-room, where it was quite\ndark.\n\n'That you, Clara?' asked Amy's voice. 'The candle's on the\nmantel-shelf.'\n\n'Why aren't you asleep?' Clara returned sharply. But the irritation\ninduced by Clem's triumph quickly passed in reflection on Sidney's mode\nof leave-taking. That had not at all annoyed her, but it had made her\nthoughtful. She lit the candle. Its light disclosed a room much barer\nthan the other one. There was one bed, in which Amy and Annie lay\n(Clara had to share it with them), and a mattress placed on the floor,\nwhere reposed little Tom; a low chest of drawers with a very small\nlooking-glass upon it, a washstand, a few boxes. Handsome girls,\nunfortunate enough to have brains to boot, do not cultivate the patient\nvirtues in chambers of this description.\n\nThere was a knock at the door. Clara found her father standing there.\n\n'Have you anything to tell me, my girl?' he asked in a subdued voice,\nfurtively regarding her.\n\n'I shall go on Monday.'\n\nHe drew back a step, and seemed about to return to the other room.\n\n'Father, I shall have to give Mrs. Tubbs the five shillings for a few\nweeks. She's going to let me have a new dress.'\n\n'Your earnin's is your own, Clara.'\n\n'Yes; but I hope very soon to be able to give you something. It's hard\nfor you, having no work.'\n\nJohn brightened wonderfully.\n\n'Don't you trouble, my dear. That's all right. Things'll come round\nsomehow. You're a good girl. Good-night, my darlin'!'\n\nHe kissed her, and went consoled to his rest.\n\nMiss Peckover kept going up and down between the kitchen and the\nfront-door. Down below, Jane was cleaning a copper kettle. Clem, who\nhad her sweetest morsel of cruelty yet in store, had devised this\npleasant little job as a way of keeping the child employed till all was\nquiet.\n\nShe had just come down to watch the progress of the work, and to give a\nsmart rap or two on the toiling fingers, when a heavy footstep in the\npassage caused her to dart upstairs again. It was Bob Hewett, returned\nfrom his evening recreations.\n\n'Oh, that's you, is it?' cried Clem. 'Come down; I want to speak to\nyou.'\n\n'Wait till to-morrow,' answered Bob, advancing towards the stairs.\n\n'Wait! we'll see about that!'\n\nShe sprang forward, and with a prompt exertion of muscle, admirable in\nits way, whirled Bob round and dragged him to the head of the kitchen\nflight. The young fellow took it in good part, and went down with her.\n\n'You go up into the passage,' said Clem to her servant, and was\nimmediately obeyed.\n\n'Now,' resumed Miss Peckover, when she had closed the door, 'who have\nyou been goin' about with to-night?'\n\n'What are you talking about?' returned Bob, who had seated himself on\nthe table, and was regarding Clem jocosely. 'I've been with some pals,\nthat's all.'\n\n'Pals! what sort o' pals? Do you call Pennyloaf Candy one o' your pals?'\n\nShe stood before him in a superb attitude, her head poised fiercely,\nher arms quivering at her sides, all the stature and vigour of her\nyoung body emphasised by muscular strain.\n\n'Pennyloaf Candy!' Bob repeated, as if in scorn of the person so named.\n'Get on with you! I'm sick of hearing you talk about her. Why I haven't\nseen her not these three weeks.'\n\n'It's a ---- lie!' Clem's epithet was too vigorous for reproduction.\n'Sukey Jollop saw you with her down by the meat-market, an' Jeck\nBartley saw you too.'\n\n'Jeck did?' He laughed with obstreperous scorn. 'Why, Jeck's gone to\nHomerton to his mother till Saturday night. Don't be such a bloomin'\nfool! Just because Suke Jollop's dead nuts on me, an' I won't have\nnothin' to say to her, she goes tellin' these bloomin' lies. When I see\nher next, I'll make her go down on her marrow-bones an' beg my pardon.\nSee if I don't just!'\n\nThere was an engaging frankness in Bob's way of defending himself which\nevidently impressed Miss Peckover, though it did not immediately soothe\nher irritation. She put her arms a-kimbo, and examined him with a\nsteady suspicion which would have disconcerted most young men. Bob,\nhowever, only laughed more heartily. The scene was prolonged. Bob had\nno recourse to tenderness to dismiss the girl's jealousy. His\nself-conceit was supreme, and had always stood him in such stead with\nthe young ladies who, to use his own expression, were 'dead nuts on\nhim,' that his love-making, under whatever circumstances, always took\nthe form of genial banter _de haut en bas_. 'Don't be a bloomin' fool!'\nwas the phrase he deemed of most efficacy in softening the female\nheart; and the result seemed to justify him, for after some half-hour's\nwrangling, Clem abandoned her hostile attitude, and eyed him with a\nsavage kind of admiration.\n\n'When are you goin' to buy me that locket, Bob, to put a bit of your\n'air in?' she inquired pertinently.\n\n'You just wait, can't you? There's a event coming off next week. I\nwon't say nothing, but you just wait.'\n\n'I'm tired o' waitin'. See here; you ain't goin' to best me out of it?'\n\n'Me best you? Don't be a bloomin' fool, Clem!'\n\nHe laughed heartily, and in a few minutes allowed himself to be\nembraced and sent off to his chamber at the top of the house.\n\nClem summoned her servant from the passage. At the same moment there\nentered another lodger, the only one whose arrival Clem still awaited.\nHis mode of ascending the stairs was singular; one would have imagined\nthat he bore some heavy weight, for he proceeded very slowly, with a\ngreat clumping noise, surmounting one step at a time in the manner of a\nchild. It was Mr. Marple, the cab-driver, and his way of going up to\nbed was very simply explained by the fact that a daily sixteen hours of\nsitting on the box left his legs in a numb and practically useless\ncondition.\n\nThe house was now quiet. Clem locked the front-door and returned to the\nkitchen, eager with anticipation of the jest she was going to carry\nout. First of all she had to pick a quarrel with Jane; this was very\neasily managed. She pretended to look about the room for a minute, then\nasked fiercely:\n\n'What's gone with that sixpence I left on the dresser?'\n\nJane looked up in terror. She was worn almost to the last point of\nendurance by her day and night of labour and agitation. Her face was\nbloodless, her eyelids were swollen with the need of sleep.\n\n'Sixpence!' she faltered, 'I'm sure I haven't seen no sixpence, miss.'\n\n'You haven't? Now, I've caught you at last. There's been nobody 'ere\nbut you. Little thief! We'll see about this in the mornin', an'\nto-night _you shall sleep in the back-kitchen_!'\n\nThe child gasped for breath. The terror of sudden death could not have\nexceeded that which rushed upon her heart when she was told that she\nmust pass her night in the room where lay the coffin.\n\n'An' you shan't have no candle, neither,' proceeded Clem, delighted\nwith the effect she was producing. 'Come along! I'm off to bed, an'\nI'll see you safe locked in first, so as no one can come an' hurt you.'\n\n'Miss! please!--I can't, I durstn't!'\n\nJane pleaded in inarticulate anguish. But Clem had caught her by the\narm, was dragging her on, on, till she was at the very door of that\nghastly death-cellar. Though thirteen years old, her slight frame was\nas incapable of resisting Clem Peckover's muscles as an infant's would\nhave been. The door was open, but at that moment Jane uttered a shriek\nwhich rang and echoed through the whole house. Startled, Clem relaxed\nher grasp. Jane tore herself away, fled up the kitchen stairs, fled\nupwards still, flung herself at the feet of someone who had come out on\nto the landing and held a light.\n\n'Oh, help me! Don't let her! Help me!'\n\n'What's up with you, Jane?' asked Clara, for it was she who, not being\nyet in bed, had come forth at once on hearing the scream.\n\nJane could only cling to her garment, pant hysterically, repeat the\nsame words of entreaty again and again. Another door opened, and John\nHewett appeared half-dressed.\n\n'What's wrong?' he cried. 'The 'ouse o' fire? Who yelled out like that?'\n\nClem was coming up; she spoke from the landing below.\n\n'It's that Jane, just because I gave her a rap as she deserved. Send\nher down again.'\n\n'Oh, no!' cried the poor girl. 'Miss Hewett! be a friend to me! She's\ngoin' to shut me up all night with the coffin. Don't let her, miss! I\ndurstn't! Oh, be a friend to me!'\n\n'Little liar!' shouted Clem. 'Oh, that bloomin' little liar! when I\nnever said a word o' such a thing!'\n\n'I'll believe her a good deal sooner than you,' returned Clara sharply.\n'Why, anybody can see she's tellin' the truth--can't they, father?\nShe's half-scared out of her life. Come in here, Jane; you shall stay\nhere till morning.'\n\nBy this time all the grown-up people in the house were on the\nstaircase; the clang of tongues was terrific. Clem held her ground\nstoutly, and in virulence was more than a match for all her opponents.\nEven Bob did not venture to take her part; he grinned down over the\nbanisters, and enjoyed the entertainment immensely. Dick Snape, whose\nroom Bob shared, took the opportunity of paying off certain old scores\nhe had standing against Clem. Mr. Marple, the cab-driver, was very loud\nand very hoarse in condemnation of such barbarity. Mrs. Hewett, looking\nas if she had herself risen from a coffin, cried shame on the general\nheartlessness with which Jane was used.\n\nClara held to her resolve. She led Jane into the bedroom, then, with a\nparting shot at Miss Peckover, herself entered and locked the door.\n\n'Drink some water, Jane,' she said, doing her best to reassure the\nchild. 'You're safe for to-night, and we'll see what Mrs. Peckover says\nabout this when she comes back to-morrow.'\n\nJane looked at her rescuer with eyes in which eternal gratitude mingled\nwith fear for the future. She could cry now, poor thing, and so little\nby little recover herself. Words to utter her thanks she had none; she\ncould only look something of what she felt. Clara made her undress and\nlie down with little Tom on the mattress. In a quarter of an hour the\ncandle was extinguished, and but for the wind, which rattled sashes and\ndoors, and made ghostly sounds in the chimneys, there was silence\nthroughout the house.\n\nSomething awoke Clara before dawn. She sat up, and became aware that\nJane was talking and crying wildly, evidently re-acting in her sleep\nthe scene of a few hours ago. With difficulty Clara broke her slumber.\n\n'Don't you feel well, Jane?' she asked, noticing a strangeness in the\nchild's way of replying to her.\n\n'Not very, miss. My head's bad, an' I'm so thirsty. May I drink out of\nthe jug, miss?'\n\n'Stay where you are. I'll bring it to you.'\n\nJane drank a great deal. Presently she fell again into slumber, which\nwas again broken in the same way. Clara did not go to sleep, and as\nsoon as it was daylight she summoned her father to come and look at the\nchild. Jane was ill, and, as everyone could see, rapidly grew worse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nJANE IS VISITED\n\nAt ten o'clock next morning Mrs. Peckover reached home. She was a tall,\nbig-boned woman of fifty, with an arm like a coalheaver's. She had dark\nhair, which shone and was odorous with unguents; a sallow, uncomely\nface, and a handsome moustache. Her countenance was more difficult to\nread than Clem's; a coarse, and most likely brutal, nature was plain\nenough in its lines, but there was also a suggestion of self-restraint,\nof sagacity, at all events of cunning--qualities which were decidedly\nnot inherited by her daughter. With her came the relative whose\npresence had been desired at the funeral to-day. This was Mrs. Gully, a\nstout person with a very red nose and bleared eyes. The credit of the\nfamily demanded that as many relatives as possible should follow the\nhearse, and Mrs. Peckover's reason for conducting Mrs. Gully hither was\na justifiable fear lest, if she came alone, the latter would arrive in\ntoo manifest a state of insobriety. A certain amount of stimulant had\nbeen permitted on the way, just enough to assist a genteel loquacity,\nfor which Mrs. Gully had a reputation. She had given her word to\nabstain from further imbibing until after the funeral.\n\nThe news which greeted her arrival was anything but welcome to Mrs.\nPeckover. In the first place, there would be far more work than usual\nto be performed in the house to-day, and Jane could be ill spared.\nWorse than that, however, Clara Hewett, who was losing half a day's\nwork on Jane's account, made a very emphatic statement as to the origin\nof the illness, and said that if anything happened to Jane, there would\nbe disagreeable facts forthcoming at a coroner's inquest. Having looked\nat the sick child, Mrs. Peckover went downstairs and shut herself up\nwith Clem. There was a stormy interview.\n\n'So you thought you'd have yer fling, did you, just because I wasn't\n'ere? You must go makin' trouble, just to suit yer own fancies! I'll\npay you, my lady! Gr-r-r!'\n\nWhereupon followed the smack of a large hand on a fleshy cheek, so\nvigorous and unexpected a blow that even the sturdy Clem staggered back.\n\n'You leave me alone, will you?' she roared out, her smitten cheek in a\nflame. 'Do that again, an' I'll give you somethin' for yerself! See if\nI don't! You just try it on!'\n\nThe room rang with uproarious abuse, with disgusting language, with the\nterrific threats which are such common flowers of rhetoric in that\nworld, and generally mean nothing whatever. The end of it all was that\nClem went to fetch a doctor; one in whom Mrs. Peckover could repose\nconfidence. The man was, in fact, a druggist, with a shop in an obscure\nstreet over towards St. Luke's; in his window was exhibited a card\nwhich stated that a certain medical man could be consulted here daily.\nThe said medical man had, in fact, so much more business than he could\nattend to--his name appearing in many shops--that the druggist was\ndeputed to act as his assistant, and was considerately supplied with\ndeath-certificates, already signed, and only needing to be filled in\nwith details. Summoned by Mrs. Peckover, whose old acquaintance he was,\nthe druggist left the shop in care of his son, aged fifteen, and sped\nto Clerkenwell Close. He made light of Jane's ailment. 'A little fever,\nthat was all--soon pull her round. Any wounds, by-the-by? No? Oh, soon\npull her round. Send for medicines.'\n\n'We'll have her down in the back-kitchen as soon as the corffin's\naway,' said Mrs. Peckover to Mrs. Hewett. 'Don't you upset yerself\nabout it, my dear; you've got quite enough to think about. Yer 'usband\ngot anythink yet? Dear, dear! Don't you put yerself out. I'm sure it\nwas a great kindness of you to let the troublesome thing lay 'ere all\nnight.'\n\nFuneral guests were beginning to assemble. On arriving, they were\nconducted first of all into the front-room on the ground-floor, the\nPeckovers' parlour. It was richly furnished. In the centre stood a\nround table, which left small space for moving about, and was at\npresent covered with refreshments. A polished sideboard supported a row\nof dessert-plates propped on their edges, and a number of glass\nvessels, probably meant for ornament alone, as they could not possibly\nhave been put to any use. A low cupboard in a recess was surmounted by\na frosted cardboard model of St. Paul's under a glass case, behind\nwhich was reared an oval tray painted with flowers. Over the\nmantel-piece was the regulation mirror, its gilt frame enveloped in\ncoarse yellow gauze; the mantel-piece itself bore a 'wealth' of\nembellishments in glass and crockery. On each side of it hung a framed\nsilhouette, portraits of ancestors. Other pictures there were many, the\nmost impressive being an ancient oil-painting, of which the canvas\nbulged forth from the frame; the subject appeared to be a ship, but was\njust as likely a view of the Alps. Several German prints conveyed\ninstruction as well as delight; one represented the trial of Strafford\nin Westminster Hall; another, the trial of William Lord Russell, at the\nOld Bailey. There was also a group of engraved portraits, the Royal\nFamily of England early in the reign of Queen Victoria; and finally,\n'The Destruction of Nineveh,' by John Martin. Along the window-sill\nwere disposed flower-pots containing artificial plants; one or other\nwas always being knocked down by the curtains or blinds.\n\nEach guest having taken a quaff of ale or spirits or what was called\nwine, with perhaps a mouthful of more solid sustenance, was then led\ndown into the back-kitchen to view the coffin and the corpse. I mention\nthe coffin first, because in everyone's view this was the main point of\ninterest. Could Mrs. Peckover have buried the old woman in an\norange-crate, she would gladly have done so for the saving of expense;\nbut with relatives and neighbours to consider, she drew a great deal of\nvirtue out of necessity, and dealt so very handsomely with the\nundertaker, that this burial would be the talk of the Close for some\nweeks. The coffin was inspected inside and out, was admired and\nappraised, Mrs. Peckover being at hand to check the estimates. At the\nsame time every most revolting detail of the dead woman's last illness\nwas related and discussed and mused over and exclaimed upon. 'A lovely\ncorpse, considerin' her years,' was the general opinion. Then all went\nupstairs again, and once more refreshed themselves. The house smelt\nlike a bar-room.\n\n'Everythink most respectable, I'm sure!' remarked the female mourners\nto each other, as they crowded together in the parlour.\n\n'An' so it had ought to be!' exclaimed one, in an indignant tone, such\nas is reserved for the expression of offence among educated people, but\namong the poor--the London poor, least original and least articulate\nbeings within the confines of civilisation--has also to do duty for\nfriendly emphasis. 'If Mrs. Peckover can't afford to do things\nrespectable, who can?'\n\nAnd the speaker looked defiantly about her, as if daring contradiction.\nBut only approving murmurs replied. Mrs. Peckover had, in fact, the\nreputation of being wealthy; she was always inheriting, always\naccumulating what her friends called 'interess,' never expending as\nother people needs must. The lodgings she let enabled her to live\nrent-free and rate-free. Clem's earnings at an artificial-flower\nfactory more than paid for that young lady's board and clothing, and\nall other outlay was not worth mentioning as a deduction from the\nincome created by her sundry investments. Her husband--ten years\ndeceased--had been a 'moulder'; he earned on an average between three\nand four pounds a week, and was so prudently disposed that, for the\nlast decade of his life, he made it a rule never to spend a farthing of\nhis wages. Mrs. Peckover at that time kept a small beer-shop in Rosoman\nStreet--small and unpretending in appearance, but through it there ran\na beery Pactolus. By selling the business shortly after her husband's\ndeath, Mrs. Peckover realised a handsome capital. She retired into\nprivate life, having a strong sense of personal dignity, and feeling it\nnecessary to devote herself to the moral training of her only child.\n\nAt half-past eleven Mrs. Peckover was arrayed in her mourning\nrobes--new, dark-glistening. During her absence Clem had kept guard\nover Mrs. Gully, whom it was very difficult indeed to restrain from the\nbottles and decanters; the elder lady coming to relieve, Clem could\nrush away and don her own solemn garments. The undertaker with his men\narrived; the hearse and coaches drove up; the Close was in a state of\nexcitement. 'Now that's what I call a respectable turn-out!' was the\nphrase passed from mouth to mouth in the crowd gathering near the door.\nChildren in great numbers had absented themselves from school for the\npurpose of beholding this procession. 'I do like to see spirited 'orses\nat a funeral!' remarked one of the mourners, who had squeezed his way\nto the parlour window. 'It puts the finishin' touch, as you may say,\ndon't it?' When the coffin was borne forth, there was such a press in\nthe street that the men with difficulty reached the hearse. As the\nfemale mourners stepped across the pavement with handkerchiefs held to\ntheir mouths, a sigh of satisfaction was audible throughout the crowd;\nthe males were less sympathetically received, and some jocose comments\nfrom a costermonger, whose business was temporarily interrupted,\nexcited indulgent smiles.\n\nThe procession moved slowly away, and the crowd, unwilling to disperse\nimmediately, looked about for some new source of entertainment. They\nwere fortunate, for at this moment came round the corner an individual\nnotorious throughout Clerkenwell as 'Mad Jack.' Mad he presumably\nwas--at all events, an idiot. A lanky, raw-boned, red-beaded man,\nperhaps forty years old; not clad, but hung over with the filthiest\nrags; hatless, shoeless. He supported himself by singing in the\nstreets, generally psalms, and with eccentric modulations of the voice\nwhich always occasioned mirth in hearers. Sometimes he stood at a\ncorner and began the delivery of a passage of Scripture in French; how,\nwhere, or when he could have acquired this knowledge was a mystery, and\nJack would throw no light on his own past. At present, having watched\nthe funeral coaches pass away, he lifted up his voice in a terrific\nblare, singing, 'All ye works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord, praise\nHim and magnify Him for ever.' Instantly he was assailed by the\njuvenile portion of the throng, was pelted with anything that came to\nhand, mocked mercilessly, buffeted from behind. For a while he\npersisted in his psalmody, but at length, without warning, he rushed\nupon his tormentors, and with angry shrieks endeavoured to take\nrevenge. The uproar continued till a policeman came and cleared the\nway. Then Jack went off again, singing, 'All ye works of the Lord.'\nWith his voice blended that of the costermonger, 'Penny a bundill!'\n\nUp in the Hewetts' back-room lay Jane Snowdon, now seemingly asleep,\nnow delirious. When she talked, a name was constantly upon her lips;\nshe kept calling for 'Mr. Kirkwood.' Amy was at school; Annie and Tom\nfrequently went into the room and gazed curiously at the sick girl.\nMrs. Hewett felt so ill to-day that she could only lie on the bed and\ntry to silence her baby's crying.\n\nThe house-door was left wide open between the departure and return of\nthe mourners; a superstition of the people demands this. The Peckovers\nbrought back with them some half a dozen relatives and friends, invited\nto a late dinner. The meal had been in preparation at an eating-house\nclose by, and was now speedily made ready in the parlour. A liberal\nsupply of various ales was furnished by the agency of a pot-boy (Jane's\nabsence being much felt), and in the course of half an hour or so the\ncompany were sufficiently restored to address themselves anew to the\nbottles and decanters. Mrs. Gully was now permitted to obey her\ninstincts; the natural result could be attributed to overstrung\nfeelings.\n\nJust when the mourners had grown noisily hilarious, testifying thereby\nto the respectability with which things were being conducted to the\nvery end, Mrs. Peckover became aware of a knocking at the front-door.\nShe bade her daughter go and see who it was. Clem, speedily returning,\nbeckoned her mother from among the guests.\n\n'It's somebody wants to know if there ain't somebody called Snowdon\nlivin' 'ere,' she whispered in a tone of alarm. 'An old man.'\n\nMrs. Peckover never drank more than was consistent with the perfect\nclearness of her brain. At present she had very red cheeks, and her\ncat-like eyes gleamed noticeably, but any kind of business would have\nfound her as shrewdly competent as ever.\n\n'What did you say?' she whispered savagely\n\n'Said I'd come an' ask.'\n\n'You stay 'ere. Don't say nothink.'\n\nMrs. Peckover left the room, closed the door behind her, and went along\nthe passage. On the doorstep stood a man with white hair, wearing an\nunusual kind of cloak and a strange hat. He looked at the landlady\nwithout speaking.\n\n'What was you wantin', mister?'\n\n'I have been told,' replied the man in a clear, grave voice, 'that a\nchild of the name of Snowdon lives in your house, ma'am.'\n\n'Eh? Who told you that?'\n\n'The people next door but one. I've been asking at many houses in the\nneighbourhood. There used to be relations of mine lived somewhere here;\nI don't know the house, nor the street exactly. The name isn't so very\ncommon. If you don't mind, I should like to ask you who the child's\nparents was.'\n\nMrs. Peckover's eyes were searching the speaker with the utmost\ncloseness.\n\n'I don't mind tellin' you,' she said, 'that there _is_ a child of that\nname in the 'ouse, a young girl, at least. Though I don't rightly know\nher age, I take her for fourteen or fifteen.'\n\nThe old man seemed to consult his recollections.\n\n'If it's anyone I'm thinking of,' he said slowly, 'she can't be quite\nas old as that.'\n\nThe woman's face changed; she looked away for a moment.\n\n'Well, as I was sayin', I don't rightly know her age. Any way, I'm\nresponsible for her. I've been a mother to her, an' a good\nmother--though I say it myself--these six years or more. I look on her\nnow as a child o' my own. I don't know who you may be, mister. P'r'aps\nyou've come from abroad?'\n\n'Yes, I have. There's no reason why I shouldn't tell you that I'm\ntrying to find any of my kin that are still alive. There was a married\nson of mine that once lived somewhere about here. His name was Joseph\nJames Snowdon. When I last heard of him, he was working at a\n'lectroplater's in Clerkenwell. That was thirteen years ago. I deal\nopenly with you; I shall thank you if you'll do the like with me.'\n\n'See, will you just come in? I've got a few friends in the front-room;\nthere's been a death in the 'ouse, an' there's sickness, an' we're out\nof order a bit, I'll ask you to come downstairs.'\n\nIt was late in the afternoon, and though lights were not yet required\nin the upper rooms, the kitchen would have been all but dark save for\nthe fire. Mrs. Peckover lit a lamp and bade her visitor be seated. Then\nshe re-examined his face, his attire, his hands. Everything about him\ntold of a life spent in mechanical labour. His speech was that of an\nuntaught man, yet differed greatly from the tongue prevailing in\nClerkenwell; he was probably not a Londoner by birth, and--a point of\nmore moment--he expressed himself in the tone of one who is habitually\nthoughtful, who, if the aid of books has been denied to him, still has\nwon from life the kind of knowledge which develops character. Mrs.\nPeckover had small experience of faces which bear the stamp of simple\nsincerity. This man's countenance put her out. As a matter of course,\nhe wished to overreach her in some way, but he was obviously very deep\nindeed. And then she found it so difficult to guess his purposes. How\nwould he proceed if she gave him details of Jane's history, admitting\nthat she was the child of Joseph James Snowdon? What, again, had he\nbeen told by the people of whom he had made inquiries? She needed time\nto review her position.\n\n'As I was sayin',' she resumed, poking the fire, 'I've been a mother to\nher these six years or more, an' I feel I done the right thing by her.\nShe was left on my 'ands by them as promised to pay for her keep; an' a\nfew months, I may say a few weeks, was all as ever I got. Another woman\nwould a sent the child to the 'Ouse; but that's always the way with me;\nI'm always actin' against my own interesses.'\n\n'You say that her parents went away and left her?' asked the old man,\nknitting his brows.\n\n'Her father did. Her mother, she died in this very 'ouse, an' she was\nburied from it. He gave her a respectable burial, I'll say that much\nfor him. An' I shouldn't have allowed anything but one as was\nrespectable to leave this 'ouse; I'd sooner a paid money out o' my own\npocket. That's always the way with me. Mr. Willis, he's my undertaker;\nyou'll find him at Number 17 Green Passage. He buried my 'usband; though\nthat wasn't from the Close; but I never knew a job turned out more\nrespectable. He was 'ere to-day; we've only just buried my 'usband's\nmother. That's why I ain't quite myself--see?'\n\nMrs. Peckover was not wont to be gossippy. She became so at present,\npartly in consequence of the stimulants she had taken to support her\nthrough a trying ceremony, partly as a means of obtaining time to\nreflect. Jane's unlucky illness made an especial difficulty in her\ncalculations. She felt that the longer she delayed mention of the fact,\nthe more likely was she to excite suspicion; on the other hand, she\ncould not devise the suitable terms in which to reveal it. The steady\ngaze of the old man was disconcerting. Not that he searched her face\nwith a cunning scrutiny, such as her own eyes expressed; she would have\nfound that less troublesome, as being familiar. The anxiety, the\ntroubled anticipation, which her words had aroused in him, were wholly\nfree from shadow of ignoble motive; he was pained, and the frequent\nturning away of his look betrayed that part of the feeling was caused\nby observation of the woman herself, but every movement visible on his\nfeatures was subdued by patience and mildness. Suffering was a life's\nhabit with him, and its fruit in this instance that which (spite of\nmoral commonplace) it least often bears--self-conquest.\n\n'You haven't told me yet,' he said, with quiet disregard of her\nirrelevancies, 'whether or not her father's name was Joseph Snowdon.'\n\n'There's no call to hide it. That was his name. I've got letters of his\nwritin'. \"J. J. Snowdon\" stands at the end, plain enough. And he was\nyour son, was he?'\n\n'He was. But have you any reason to think he's dead?'\n\n'Dead! I never heard as he was. But then I never heard as he was\nlivin', neither. When his wife went, poor thing--an' it was a chill on\nthe liver, they said; it took her very sudden--he says to me, \"Mrs.\nPeckover,\" he says, \"I know you for a motherly woman\"--just like\nthat--see?--\"I know you for a motherly woman,\" he says, \"an' the idea I\nhave in my 'ed is as I should like to leave Janey in your care,\n'cause,\" he says, \"I've got work in Birmingham, an' I don't see how I'm\nto take her with me. Understand me?\" he says. \"Oh!\" I says--not feelin'\nquite sure what I'd ought to do--see? \"Oh!\" I says. \"Yes,\" he says;\n\"an' between you an' me,\" he says, \"there won't be no misunderstanding.\nIf you'll keep Janey with you\"--an' she was goin' to school at the\ntime, 'cause she went to the same as my own Clem--that's\nClemintiner--understand?--\"if you'll keep Janey with you,\" he says,\n\"for a year, or maybe two years, or maybe three years--'cause that\ndepends on cirkinstances\"--understand?--\"I'm ready,\" he says, \"to pay\nyou what it's right that pay I should, an' I'm sure,\" he says, \"as we\nshouldn't misunderstand one another.\" Well, of course I had my own girl\nto bring up, an' my own son to look after too. A nice sort o' son; just\nwhen he was beginnin' to do well, an' ought to a paid me back for all\nthe expense I was at in puttin' him to a business, what must he do but\ntake his 'ook to Australia.'\n\nHer scrutiny discerned something in the listener's face which led her\nto ask:\n\n'Perhaps you've been in Australia yourself, mister?'\n\n'I have.'\n\nThe woman paused, speculation at work in her eyes.\n\n'Do you know in what part of the country your son is?' inquired the old\nman absently.\n\n'He's wrote me two letters, an' the last, as come more than a year ago,\nwas from a place called Maryborough.'\n\nThe other still preserved an absent expression; his eyes travelled\nabout the room.\n\n'I always said,' pursued Mrs. Peckover, 'as it was Snowdon as put\nAustralia into the boy's 'ed. He used to tell us he'd got a brother\nthere, doin' well. P'r'aps it wasn't true.'\n\n'Yes, it was true,' replied the old man coldly. 'But you haven't told\nme what came to pass about the child.'\n\nAn exact report of all that Mrs. Peckover had to say on this subject\nwould occupy more space than it merits. The gist of it was that for\nless than a year she had received certain stipulated sums irregularly;\nthat at length no money at all was forthcoming; that in the tenderness\nof her heart she had still entertained the child, sent her to school,\nprivately instructed her in the domestic virtues, trusting that such\nhumanity would not lack even its material reward, and that either\nJoseph Snowdon or someone akin to him would ultimately make good to her\nthe expenses she had not grudged.\n\n'She's a child as pays you back for all the trouble you take, so much I\n_will_ say for her,' observed the matron in conclusion. 'Not as it\nhasn't been a little 'ard to teach her tidiness, but she's only a young\nthing still. I shouldn't wonder but she's felt her position a little\nnow an' then; it's only natural in a growin' girl, do what you can to\nprevent it. Still, she's willin'; that nobody can deny, an' I'm sure I\nshould never wish to. Her cirkinstances has been peculiar; that you'll\nunderstand, I'm sure. But I done my best to take the place of the\nmother as is gone to a better world. An' now that she's layin' ill, I'm\nsure no mother could feel it more--'\n\n'Ill? Why didn't you mention that before?'\n\n'Didn't I say as she was ill? Why, I thought it was the first word I\nspoke as soon as you got into the 'ouse. You can't a noticed it, or\nelse it was me as is so put about. What with havin' a burial--'\n\n'Where is she?' asked the old man anxiously.\n\n'Where? Why, you don't think as I'd a sent her to be looked after by\nstrangers? She's layin' in Mrs. Hewett's room--that's one o' the\nlodgers--all for the sake o' comfort. A better an' kinder woman than\nMrs. Hewett you wouldn't find, not if you was to--'\n\nWith difficulty the stranger obtained a few details of the origin and\ncourse of the illness--details wholly misleading, but devised to\nreassure. When he desired to see Jane, Mrs. Peckover assumed an air of\nperfect willingness, but reminded him that she had nothing save his\nword to prove that he had indeed a legitimate interest in the girl.\n\n'I can do no more than tell you that Joseph James Snowdon was my\nyounger son,' replied the old man simply. 'I've come back to spend my\nlast years in England, and I hoped--I hope still--to find my son. I\nwish to take his child into my own care; as he left her to\nstrangers--perhaps he didn't do it willingly; he may be dead--he could\nhave nothing to say against me giving her the care of a parent. You've\nbeen at expense--'\n\nMrs. Peckover waited with eagerness, but the sentence remained\nincomplete. Again the old man's eyes strayed about the room. The\ncurrent of his thoughts seemed to change, and he said:\n\n'You could show me those letters you spoke of--of my son's writing?'\n\n'Of course I could,' was the reply, in the tone of coarse resentment\nwhereby the scheming vulgar are wont to testify to their dishonesty.\n\n'Afterwards--afterwards. I should like to see Jane, if you'll be so\ngood.'\n\nThe mild voice, though often diffident, now and then fell upon a note\nof quiet authority which suited well with the speaker's grave, pure\ncountenance. As he spoke thus, Mrs. Peckover rose, and said she would\nfirst go upstairs just to see how things were. She was absent ten\nminutes, then a little girl--Amy Hewett--came into the kitchen and\nasked the stranger to follow her.\n\nJane had been rapidly transferred from the mattress to the bedstead,\nand the room had been put into such order as was possible. A whisper\nfrom Mrs. Peckover to Mrs. Hewett, promising remission of half a week's\nrent, had sufficed to obtain for the former complete freedom in her\nmovements. The child, excited by this disturbance, had begun to moan\nand talk inarticulately. Mrs. Peckover listened for a moment, but heard\nnothing dangerous. She bade the old man enter noiselessly, and herself\nwent about on tip-toe, speaking only in a hoarse whisper.\n\nThe visitor had just reached the bedside, and was gazing with deep,\ncompassionate interest at the unconscious face, when Jane, as if\nstartled, half rose and cried painfully, 'Mr. Kirkwood! oh, Mr.\nKirkwood!' and she stretched her hand out, appearing to believe that\nthe friend she called upon was near her.\n\n'Who is that?' inquired the old man, turning to his companion.\n\n'Only a friend of ours,' answered Mrs. Peckover, herself puzzled and\nuneasy.\n\nAgain the sick girl called 'Mr. Kirkwood!' but without other words.\nMrs. Peckover urged the danger of this excitement, and speedily led the\nway downstairs.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nGLIMPSES OF THE PAST\n\nSidney Kirkwood had a lodging in Tysoe Street, Clerkenwell. It is a\nshort street, which, like so many in London, begins reputably and\ndegenerates in its latter half. The cleaner end leads into Wilmington\nSquare, which consists of decently depressing houses, occupied in the\nmain, as the lower windows and front-doors indicate, by watchmakers,\nworking jewellers, and craftsmen of allied pursuits. The open space,\ngrateful in this neighbourhood, is laid out as a garden, with trees,\nbeds, and walks. Near the iron gate, which, for certain hours in the\nday, gives admission, is a painted notice informing the public that, by\nthe grace of the Marquis of Northampton, they may here take their ease\non condition of good behaviour; to children is addressed a distinct\nwarning that 'This is not a playing ground.' From his window Sidney had\na good view of the Square. The house in which he lived was of two\nstoreys; a brass plate on the door showed the inscription, 'Hodgson,\nDial Painter.' The window on the ground-floor was arched, as in the\nother dwellings at this end of the street, and within stood an artistic\narrangement of wax fruit under a glass shade, supported by a heavy\nvolume of Biblical appearance. The upper storey was graced with a small\niron balcony, on which straggled a few flower-pots. However, the\nexterior of this abode was, by comparison, promising; the curtains and\nblinds were clean, the step was washed and whitened, the brass plate\nshone, the panes of glass had at all events acquaintance with a duster.\nA few yards in the direction away from the Square, and Tysoe Street\nfalls under the dominion of dry-rot.\n\nIt was not until he set forth to go to work next morning that Sidney\ncalled to mind his conversation with Jane. That the child should have\nmissed by five minutes a meeting with someone who perchance had the\nwill and the power to befriend her, seemed to him, in his present mood,\nmerely an illustration of a vice inherent in the nature of things. He\ndetermined to look in at the public-house of which she had spoken, and\nhear for himself what manner of man had made inquiries for people named\nSnowdon. The name was not a common one; it was worth while to spend a\nhope or two on the chance of doing Jane a kindness. Her look and voice\nwhen he bade her be of good courage had touched him. In his rejected\nstate, he felt that it was pleasant to earn gratitude even from so\nhumble a being as the Peckovers' drudge.\n\nHis workshop, it has been mentioned, was in St. John's Square. Of all\nareas in London thus defined, this Square of St. John is probably the\nmost irregular in outline. It is cut in two by Clerkenwell Road, and\nthe buildings which compose it form such a number of recesses, of\nabortive streets, of shadowed alleys, that from no point of the Square\ncan anything like a general view of its totality be obtained. The exit\nfrom it on the south side is by St. John's Lane, at the entrance to\nwhich stands a survival from a buried world--the embattled and windowed\narchway which is all that remains above ground of the great Priory of\nSt. John of Jerusalem. Here dwelt the Knights Hospitallers, in days\nwhen Clerkenwell was a rural parish, distant by a long stretch of green\ncountry from the walls of London. But other and nearer memories are\nrevived by St. John's Arch. In the rooms above the gateway dwelt, a\nhundred and fifty years ago, one Edward Cave, publisher of the\n_Gentleman's Magazine_, and there many a time has sat a journeyman\nauthor of his, by name Samuel Johnson, too often _impransus_. There it\nwas that the said Samuel once had his dinner handed to him behind a\nscreen, because of his unpresentable costume, when Cave was\nentertaining an aristocratic guest. In the course of the meal, the\nguest happened to speak with interest of something he had recently read\nby an obscure Mr. Johnson; whereat there was joy behind the screen, and\nprobably increased appreciation of the unwonted dinner. After a walk\namid the squalid and toil-infested ways of Clerkenwell, it impresses\none strangely to come upon this monument of old time. The archway has a\nsad, worn, grimy aspect. So closely is it packed in among buildings\nwhich suggest nothing but the sordid struggle for existence, that it\nlooks depressed, ashamed, tainted by the ignobleness of its\nsurroundings. The wonder is that it has not been swept away, in\nobedience to the great law of traffic and the spirit of the time.\n\nSt. John's Arch had a place in Sidney Kirkwood's earliest memories.\nFrom the window of his present workshop he could see its grey\nbattlements, and they reminded him of the days when, as a lad just\nbeginning to put questions about the surprising world in which he found\nhimself, he used to listen to such stories as his father could tell him\nof the history of Clerkenwell. Mr. Kirkwood occupied part of a house in\nSt. John's Lane, not thirty yards from the Arch; he was a printers'\nroller maker, and did but an indifferent business. A year after the\nbirth of Sidney, his only child, he became a widower. An intelligent,\nwarm-hearted man, the one purpose of his latter years was to realise\nsuch moderate competency as should place his son above the anxieties\nwhich degrade. The boy had a noticeable turn for drawing and colouring;\nat ten years old, when (as often happened) his father took him for a\nSunday in the country, he carried a sketch-book and found his delight\nin using it. Sidney was to be a draughtsman of some kind; perhaps an\nartist, if all went well. Unhappily things went the reverse of well. In\nhis anxiety to improve his business, Mr. Kirkwood invented a new kind\nof 'composition' for printers' use; he patented it, risked capital upon\nit, made in a short time some serious losses. To add to his troubles,\nyoung Sidney was giving signs of an unstable character; at fifteen he\nhad grown tired of his drawing, wanted to be this, that, and the other\nthing, was self-willed, and showed no consideration for his father's\ndifficulties. It was necessary to take a decided step, and, though\nagainst his will, Sidney was apprenticed to an uncle, a Mr. Roach, who\nalso lived in Clerkenwell, and was a working jeweller. Two years later\nthe father died, all but bankrupt. The few pounds realised from his\neffects passed into the hands of Mr. Roach, and were soon expended in\npayment for Sidney's board and lodging.\n\nHis bereavement possibly saved Sidney from a young-manhood of\nfoolishness and worse. In the upper world a youth may 'sow his wild\noats' and have done with it; in the nether, 'to have your fling' is\nalmost necessarily to fall among criminals. The death was sudden; it\naffected the lad profoundly, and filled him with a remorse which was to\ninfluence the whole of his life. Mr. Roach, a thick-skinned and rather\nthick-headed person, did not spare to remind his apprentice of the most\npainful things wherewith the latter had to reproach himself. Sidney\nbore it, from this day beginning a course of self-discipline of which\nnot many are capable at any age, and very few indeed at seventeen.\nStill, there had never been any sympathy between him and his uncle, and\nbefore very long the young man saw his way to live under another roof\nand find work with a new employer.\n\nIt was just after leaving his uncle's house that Sidney came to know\nJohn Hewett; the circumstances which fostered their friendship were\nsuch as threw strong light on the characters of both. Sidney had taken\na room in Islington, and two rooms on the floor beneath him were\ntenanted by a man who was a widower and had two children. In those\ndays, our young friend found much satisfaction in spending his Sunday\nevenings on Clerkenwell Green, where fervent, if ungrammatical, oratory\nwas to be heard, and participation in debate was open to all whom the\nspirit moved. One whom the spirit did very frequently move was Sidney's\nfellow-lodger; he had no gift of expression whatever, but his brief,\nstammering protests against this or that social wrong had such an\nhonest, indeed such a pathetic sound, that Sidney took an opportunity\nof walking home with him and converting neighbourship into friendly\nacquaintance. John Hewett gave the young man an account of his life. He\nhad begun as a lath-render; later he had got into cabinet-making,\nstarted a business on his own account, and failed. A brother of his,\nwho was a builder's foreman, then found employment for him in general\ncarpentry on some new houses; but John quarrelled with his brother, and\nafter many difficulties fell to the making of packing-cases; that was\nhis work at present, and with much discontent he pursued it. John was\ncuriously frank in owning all the faults in himself which had helped to\nmake his career so unsatisfactory. He confessed that he had an\nuncertain temper, that he soon became impatient with work 'which led to\nnothing,' that he was tempted out of his prudence by anything which\nseemed to offer 'a better start.' With all these admissions, he\nmaintained that he did well to be angry. It was wrong that life should\nbe so hard; so much should not be required of a man. In body he was not\nstrong; the weariness of interminable days over-tried him and excited\nhis mind to vain discontent. His wife was the only one who could ever\nkeep him cheerful under his lot, and his wedded life had lasted but six\nyears; now there was his lad Bob and his little girl Clara to think of,\nand it only made him more miserable to look forward and see them going\nthrough hardships like his own. Things were wrong somehow, and it\nseemed to him that 'if only we could have universal suffrage--'\n\nSidney was only eighteen, and strong in juvenile Radicalism, but he had\na fund of common sense, and such a conclusion as this of poor John's\nhalf-astonished, half-amused him. However, the man's personality\nattracted him; it was honest, warm-hearted, interesting; the logic of\nhis pleadings might be at fault, but Sidney sympathised with him, for\nall that. He too felt that 'things were wrong somehow,' and had a\npleasure in joining the side of revolt for revolt's sake.\n\nNow in the same house with them dwelt a young woman of about nineteen\nyears old; she occupied a garret, was seldom seen about, and had every\nappearance of being a simple, laborious girl, of the kind familiar\nenough as the silent victims of industrialism. One day the house was\nthrown into consternation by the news that Miss Barnes--so she was\nnamed--had been arrested on a charge of stealing her employer's goods.\nIt was true, and perhaps the best way of explaining it will be to\nreproduce a newspaper report which Sidney Kirkwood thereafter preserved.\n\n'On Friday, Margaret Barnes, nineteen, a single woman, was indicted for\nstealing six jackets, value 5_l_., the property of Mary Oaks, her\nmistress. The prisoner, who cried bitterly during the proceedings,\npleaded guilty. The prosecutrix is a single woman, and gets her living\nby mantle-making. She engaged the prisoner to do what is termed\n\"finishing off,\" that is, making the button-holes and sewing on the\nbuttons. The prisoner was also employed to fetch the work from the\nwarehouse, and deliver it when finished. On September 7th her mistress\nsent her with the six jackets, and she never returned. Sergeant Smith,\na detective, who apprehended the prisoner, said he had made inquiries\nin the case, and found that up to this time the prisoner had borne a\ngood character as an honest, hard-working girl. She had quitted her\nformer lodgings, which had no furniture but a small table and a few\nrags in a corner, and he discovered her in a room which was perfectly\nbare. Miss Oaks was examined, and said the prisoner was employed from\nnine in the morning to eight at night. The Judge: How much did you pay\nher per week? Miss Oaks: Four shillings. The Judge: Did you give her\nher food? Miss Oaks: No; I only get one shilling each for the jackets\nmyself when completed. I have to use two sewing-machines, find my own\ncotton and needles, and I can, by working hard, make two in a day. The\nJudge said it was a sad state of things. The prisoner, when called\nupon, said she had had nothing to eat for three days, and so gave way\nto temptation, hoping to get better employment. The Judge, while\ncommiserating with the prisoner, said it could not be allowed that\ndistress should justify dishonesty, and sentenced the prisoner to six\nweeks' imprisonment.'\n\nThe six weeks passed, and about a fortnight after that, John Hewett\ncame into Sidney's room one evening with a strange look on his face.\nHis eyes were very bright, the hand which he held out trembled.\n\n'I've something to tell you,' he said. 'I'm going to get married again.'\n\n'Really? Why, I'm glad to hear it!'\n\n'And who do you think? Miss Barnes.'\n\nSidney was startled for a moment. John had had no acquaintance with the\ngirl prior to her imprisonment. He had said that he should meet her\nwhen she came out and give her some money, and Sidney had added a\ncontribution. For a man in Hewett's circumstances this latest step was\nsomewhat astonishing, but his character explained it.\n\n'I'm goin' to marry her,' he exclaimed excitedly, 'and I'm doing the\nright thing! I respect her more than all the women as never went wrong\nbecause they never had occasion to. I'm goin' to put her as a mother\nover my children, and I'm goin' to make a happier life for her. She's a\ngood girl, I tell you. I've seen her nearly every day this fortnight; I\nknow all about her. She wouldn't have me when I first asked her--that\nwas a week ago. She said no; she'd disgrace me. If you can't respect\nher as you would any other woman, never come into my lodging!'\n\nSidney was warm with generous glow. He wrung Hewett's hand and\nstammered incoherent words.\n\nJohn took new lodgings in an obscure part of Clerkenwell, and seemed to\nhave become a young man once more. His complaints ceased; the energy\nwith which he went about his work was remarkable. He said his wife was\nthe salvation of him. And then befell one of those happy chances which\nsupply mankind with instances for its pathetic faith that a good deed\nwill not fail of reward. John's brother died, and bequeathed to him\nsome four hundred pounds. Hereupon, what must the poor fellow do but\nopen workshops on his own account, engage men, go about crying that his\nopportunity had come at last. Here was the bit of rock by means of\nwhich he could save himself from the sea of competition that had so\nnearly whelmed him! Little Clara, now eleven years old, could go on\nsteadily at school; no need to think of how the poor child should earn\na wretched living. Bob, now thirteen, should shortly be apprenticed to\nsome better kind of trade. New rooms were taken and well furnished.\nMaggie, the wife, could have good food, such as she needed in her\nconstant ailing, alas! The baby just born was no longer a cause of\nanxious thought, but a joy in the home. And Sidney Kirkwood came to\nsupper as soon as the new rooms were in order, and his bright, manly\nface did everyone good to look at. He still took little Clara upon his\nknee. Ha! there would come a day before long when he would not venture\nto do that, and then perhaps--perhaps! What a supper that was, and how\nsmoothly went the great wheels of the world that evening!\n\nOne baby, two babies, three babies; before the birth of the third,\nJohn's brow was again clouded, again he had begun to rail and fume at\nthe unfitness of things. His business was a failure, partly because he\ndealt with a too rigid honesty, partly because of his unstable nature,\nwhich left him at the mercy of whims and obstinacies and airy projects.\nHe did not risk the ordinary kind of bankruptcy, but came down and\ndown, until at length he was the only workman in his own shop; then the\nshop itself had to be abandoned; then he was searching for someone who\nwould employ him.\n\nBob had been put to the die-sinker's craft; Clara was still going to\nschool, and had no thought of earning a livelihood--ominous state of\nthings, When it shortly became clear even to John Hewett that he would\nwrong the girl if he did not provide her with some means of supporting\nherself, she was sent to learn 'stamping' with the same employer for\nwhom her brother worked. The work was light; it would soon bring in a\nlittle money. John declared with fierceness that his daughter should\nnever be set to the usual needle-slavery, and indeed it seemed very\nunlikely that Clara would ever be fit for that employment, as she could\nnot do the simplest kind of sewing. In the meantime the family kept\nchanging their abode, till at length they settled in Mrs. Peckover's\nhouse. All the best of their furniture was by this time sold; but for\nthe two eldest children, there would probably have been no home at all.\nBob, aged nineteen, earned at this present time a pound weekly; his\nsister, an average of thirteen shillings. Mrs. Hewett's constant\nill-health (the result, doubtless, of semi-starvation through the years\nof her girlhood), would have excused defects of housekeeping; but\nindeed the poor woman was under any circumstances incapable of domestic\nmanagement, and therein represented her class. The money she received\nwas wasted in comparison with what might have been done with it. I\nsuppose she must not be blamed for bringing children into the world\nwhen those already born to her were but half-clothed, half-fed; she\nincreased the sum total of the world's misery in obedience to the laws\nof the Book of Genesis. And one virtue she had which compensated for\nall that was lacking--a virtue merely negative among the refined, but\nin that other world the rarest and most precious of moral\ndistinctions--she resisted the temptations of the public-house.\n\nThis was the story present in Sidney Kirkwood's mind as often as he\nclimbed the staircase in Clerkenwell Close. By contrast, his own life\nseemed one of unbroken ease. Outwardly it was smooth enough. He had no\nliking for his craft, and being always employed upon the meaningless\nwork which is demanded by the rich vulgar, he felt such work to be\npaltry and ignoble; but there seemed no hope of obtaining better, and\nhe made no audible complaint. His wages were considerably more than he\nneeded, and systematically he put money aside each week.\n\nBut this orderly existence concealed conflicts of heart and mind which\nSidney himself could not have explained, could not lucidly have\ndescribed. The moral shock which he experienced at his father's death\nput an end to the wanton play of his energies, but it could not ripen\nhim before due time; his nature was not of the sterile order common in\nhis world, and through passion, through conflict, through endurance, it\nhad to develop such maturity as fate should permit. Saved from\nself-indulgence, he naturally turned into the way of political\nenthusiasm; thither did his temper point him. With some help--mostly\nnegative--from Clerkenwell Green, he reached the stage of confident and\naspiring Radicalism, believing in the perfectibility of man, in human\nbrotherhood, in--anything you like that is the outcome of a noble heart\nsheltered by ignorance. It had its turn, and passed.\n\nTo give place to nothing very satisfactory. It was not a mere\ncoincidence that Sidney was going through a period of mental and moral\nconfusion just in those years which brought Clara Hewett from childhood\nto the state of woman. Among the acquaintances of Sidney's boyhood\nthere was not one but had a chosen female companion from the age of\nfifteen or earlier; he himself had been no exception to the rule in his\nclass, but at the time of meeting with Hewett he was companionless, and\nremained so. The Hewetts became his closest friends; in their brief\nprosperity he rejoiced with them, in their hardships he gave them all\nthe assistance to which John's pride would consent; his name was never\nspoken among them but with warmth and gratitude. And of course the day\ncame to which Hewett had looked forward--the day when Sidney could no\nlonger take Clara upon his knee and stroke her brown hair and joke with\nher about her fits of good and ill humour. Sidney knew well enough what\nwas in his friend's mind, and, though with no sense of constraint, he\nfelt that this handsome, keen-eyed, capricious girl was destined to be\nhis wife. He liked Clara; she always attracted him and interested him;\nbut her faults were too obvious to escape any eye, and the older she\ngrew, the more was he impressed and troubled by them. The thought of\nClara became a preoccupation, and with the love which at length he\nrecognised there blended a sense of fate fulfilling itself. His\nenthusiasms, his purposes, never defined as education would have\ndefined them, were dissipated into utter vagueness. He lost his guiding\ninterests, and found himself returning to those of boyhood. The country\nonce more attracted him; he took out his old sketch-books, bought a new\none, revived the regret that he could not be a painter of landscape. A\nvisit to one or two picture-galleries, and then again profound\ndiscouragement, recognition of the fact that he was a mechanic and\nnever could be anything else.\n\nIt was the end of his illusions. For him not even passionate love was\nto preserve the power of idealising its object. He loved Clara with all\nthe desire of his being, but could no longer deceive himself in judging\nher character. The same sad clearness of vision affected his judgment\nof the world about him, of the activities in which he had once been\nzealous, of the conditions which enveloped his life and the lives of\nthose dear to him. The spirit of revolt often enough stirred within\nhim, but no longer found utterance in the speech which brings relief;\nhe did his best to dispel the mood, mocking at it as folly. Consciously\nhe set himself the task of becoming a practical man, of learning to\nmake the best of life as he found it, of shunning as the fatal error\nthat habit of mind which kept John Hewett on the rack. Who was he that\nhe should look for pleasant things in his course through the world? 'We\nare the lower orders; we are the working classes,' he said bitterly to\nhis friend, and that seemed the final answer to all his aspirations.\n\nThis was a dark day with him. The gold he handled stung him to hatred\nand envy, and every feeling which he had resolved to combat as worse\nthan profitless. He could not speak to his fellow-workmen. From morning\nto night it had rained. St. John's Arch looked more broken-spirited\nthan ever, drenched in sooty moisture.\n\nDuring the dinner-hour he walked over to the public-house of which Jane\nhad spoken, and obtained from the barman as full a description as\npossible of the person he hoped to encounter. Both then and on his\nreturn home in the evening he shunned the house where his friends dwelt.\n\nIt came round to Monday. For the first time for many months he had\nallowed Sunday to pass without visiting the Hewetts. He felt that to go\nthere at present would only be to increase the parents' depression by\nhis own low spirits. Clara had left them now, however, and if he still\nstayed away, his behaviour might be misinterpreted. On returning from\nwork, he washed, took a hurried meal, and was on the point of going out\nwhen someone knocked at his door. He opened, and saw an old man who was\na stranger to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nMRS. BYASS'S LODGINGS\n\n'You are Mr. Kirkwood?' said his visitor civilly. 'My name is Snowdon.\nI should be glad to speak a few words with you, if you could spare the\ntime.'\n\nSidney's thoughts were instantly led into the right channel; he\nidentified the old man by his white hair and the cloak. The hat,\nhowever, which had been described to him, was now exchanged for a soft\nfelt of a kind common enough; the guernsey, too, had been laid aside.\nWith ready goodwill he invited Mr. Snowdon to enter.\n\nThere was not much in the room to distinguish it from the dwelling of\nany orderly mechanic. A small bed occupied one side; a small table\nstood before the window; the toilet apparatus was, of course,\nunconcealed; a half-open cupboard allowed a glimpse of crockery,\nsundries, and a few books. The walls, it is true, were otherwise\nornamented than is usual; engravings, chromo-lithographs, and some\nsketches of landscape in pencil, were suspended wherever light fell,\nand the choice manifested in this collection was nowise akin to that\nwhich ruled in Mrs. Peckover's parlour, and probably in all the\nparlours of Tysoe Street. To select for one's chamber a woodcut after\nConstable or Gainsborough is at all events to give proof of a capacity\nfor civilisation.\n\nThe visitor made a quick survey of these appearances; then he seated\nhimself on the chair Sidney offered. He was not entirely at his ease,\nand looked up at the young man twice or thrice before he began to speak\nagain.\n\n'Mr. Kirkwood, were you ever acquainted with my son, by name Joseph\nSnowdon?'\n\n'No; I never knew him,' was the reply. 'I have heard his name, and I\nknow where he once lived--not far from here.'\n\n'You're wondering what has brought me to you. I have heard of you from\npeople a grandchild of mine is living with. I dare say it is the house\nyou mean--in Clerkenwell Close.'\n\n'So you have found it!' exclaimed Sidney with pleasure. 'I've been\nlooking about for you as I walked along the streets these last two or\nthree days.'\n\n'Looking for me?' said the other, astonished.\n\nSidney supplied the explanation, but without remarking on the\ncircumstances which made Jane so anxious to discover a possible friend.\nSnowdon listened attentively, and at length, with a slight smile; he\nseemed to find pleasure in the young man's way of expressing himself.\nWhen silence ensued, he looked about absently for a moment; then,\nmeeting Sidney's eyes, said in a grave voice:\n\n'That poor child is very ill.'\n\n'Ill? I'm sorry to hear it.'\n\n'The reason I've come to you, Mr. Kirkwood, is because she's called out\nyour name so often. They don't seem able to tell me how she came into\nthis state, but she's had a fright of some kind, or she's been living\nvery unhappily. She calls on your name, as if she wanted you to protect\nher from harm. I didn't know what to think about it at first. I'm a\nstranger to everybody--I may tell you I've been abroad for several\nyears--and they don't seem very ready to put trust in me; but I decided\nat last that I'd come and speak to you. It's my grandchild, and perhaps\nthe only one of my family left; nobody can give me news of her father\nsince he went away four or five years ago. She came to herself this\nmorning for a little, but I'm afraid she couldn't understand what I\ntried to tell her; then I mentioned your name, and I could see it did\nher good at once. What I wish to ask of you is, would you come to her\nbedside for a few minutes? She might know you, and I feel sure it would\nbe a kindness to her.'\n\nSidney appeared to hesitate. It was not, of course, that he dreamt of\nrefusing, but he was busy revolving all he knew of Jane's life with the\nPeckovers, and asking himself what it behoved him to tell, what to\nwithhold. Daily experience guarded him against the habit of gossip,\nwhich is one of the innumerable curses of the uneducated (whether poor\nor wealthy), and, notwithstanding the sympathy with which his visitor\ninspired him, he quickly decided to maintain reserve until he\nunderstood more of the situation.\n\n'Yes, yes; I'll go with you at once,' he made haste to reply, when he\nperceived that his hesitancy was occasioning doubt and trouble. 'In\nfact, I was just starting to go and see the Hewetts when you knocked at\nthe door. They're friends of mine--living in Mrs. Peckover's house.\nThat's how I came to know Jane. I haven't been there for several days,\nand when I last saw her, as I was saying, she seemed as well as usual.'\n\n'I'm afraid that wasn't much to boast of,' said Snowdon. 'She's a poor,\nthin-looking child.'\n\nSidney was conscious that the old man did not give expression to all he\nthought. This mutual exercise of tact seemed, however, to encourage a\ngood understanding between them rather than the reverse.\n\n'You remain in the house?' Kirkwood asked as they went downstairs.\n\n'I stay with her through the night. I didn't feel much confidence in\nthe doctor that was seeing her, so I made inquiries and found a better\nman.'\n\nWhen they reached the Close, the door was opened to them by Clem\nPeckover. She glared haughtily at Sidney, but uttered no word. To\nKirkwood's surprise, they went up to the Hewetts' back-room. The\nmattress that formerly lay upon the floor had been removed; the bed was\noccupied by the sick girl, with whom at present Mrs. Peckover was\nsitting. That benevolent person rose on seeing Sidney, and inclined her\nhead with stateliness.\n\n'She's just fell asleep,' was her whispered remark. 'I shouldn't say\nmyself as it was good to wake her up, but of course you know best.'\n\nThis was in keeping with the attitude Mrs. Peckover had adopted as soon\nas she understood Snowdon's resolve to neglect no precaution on the\nchild's behalf. Her sour dignity was meant to express that she felt\nhurt at the intervention of others where her affections were so nearly\nconcerned. Sidney could not help a certain fear when he saw this woman\ninstalled as sick-nurse. It was of purpose that he caught her eye and\nregarded her with a gravity she could scarcely fail to comprehend.\n\nJane awoke from her fitful slumber. She looked with but half-conscious\nfearfulness at the figures darkening her view. Sidney moved so that his\nface was in the light, and, bending near to her, asked if she\nrecognised him. A smile--slow-forming, but unmistakable at last--amply\njustified what her grandfather had said. She made an effort to move her\nhand towards him. Sidney responded to her wish, and again she smiled,\nself-forgetfully, contentedly.\n\nSnowdon turned to Mrs. Peckover, and, after a few words with regard to\nthe treatment that was being pursued, said that he would now relieve\nher; she lingered, but shortly left the room. Sidney, sitting by the\nbed, in a few minutes saw that Jane once more slept, or appeared to do\nso. He whispered to Snowdon that he was going to see his friends in the\nnext room, and would look in again before leaving.\n\nHis tap at the door was answered by Amy, who at once looked back and\nsaid:\n\n'Can Mr. Kirkwood come in, mother?'\n\n'Yes; I want to see him,' was the answer.\n\nMrs. Hewett was lying in bed; she looked, if possible, more wretchedly\nill than four days ago. On the floor were two mattresses, covered to\nmake beds for the children. The baby, held in its mother's arms, was\ncrying feebly.\n\n'Why, I hoped you were getting much better by now,' said Sidney.\n\nMrs. Hewett told him that she had been to the hospital on Saturday, and\nseemed to have caught cold. A common enough occurrence; hours of\nwaiting in an out-patients' room frequently do more harm than the\ndoctor's advice can remedy. She explained that Mrs. Peckover had\nrequested the use of the other room.\n\n'There's too many of us to be livin' an' sleepin' in this little\nplace,' she said; 'but, after all, it's a savin' of rent. It's a good\nthing Clara isn't here. An' you've heard as John's got work?'\n\nHe had found a job at length with a cabinet-maker; tonight he would\nprobably be working till ten or eleven o'clock. Good news so far. Then\nMrs. Hewett began to speak with curiosity of the old man who claimed\nJane as his grandchild. Sidney told her what had just happened.\n\n'An' what did you say about the girl?' she asked anxiously.\n\n'I said as little as I could; I thought it wisest. Do you know what\nmade her ill?'\n\n'It was that Clem as did it,' Mrs. Hewett replied, subduing her voice,\nAnd she related what had befallen after Sidney's last visit. 'Mrs.\nPeckover, she's that afraid the truth should get out. Of course I don't\nwant to make no bother, but I do feel that glad the poor thing's got\nsomebody to look after her at last. I never told you half the things as\nused to go on. That Clem's no better than a wild-beast tiger; but then\nwhat can you do? There's never any good comes out of makin' a bother\nwith other people's business, is there? Fancy him comin' to see you!\nMrs. Peckover's afraid of him, I can see that, though she pretends she\nisn't goin' to stand him interferin'. What do you think about him,\nSidney? He's sent for a doctor out of Islington; wouldn't have nothin'\nto say to the other. He must have plenty of money, don't you think?\nMrs. Peckover says he's goin' to pay the money owin' to her for Jane's\nkeep. As if the poor thing hadn't more than paid for her bits of meals\nan' her bed in the kitchen! Do you think that woman 'ud ever have kept\nher if it wasn't she could make her a servant with no wages? If Jane\n'ud been a boy, she'd a gone to the workhouse long ago. She's been that\nhandy, poor little mite! I've always done what I could for her; you\nknow that, Sidney. I do hope she'll get over it. If anything happens,\nmind my word, there'll be a nice to-do! Clara says she'll go to a\nmagistrate an' let it all out, if nobody else will. She hates the\nPeckovers, Clara does.'\n\n'It won't come to that,' said Sidney. 'I can see the old man'll take\nher away as soon as possible. He may have a little money; he's just\ncome back from Australia. I like the look of him myself.'\n\nHe began to talk of other subjects; waxed wrath at the misery of this\nhousing to which the family had shrunk; urged a removal from the vile\nden as soon as ever it could be managed. Sidney always lost control of\nhimself when he talked with the Hewetts of their difficulties; the\npeople were, from his point of view, so lacking in resource, so\nstubbornly rooted in profitless habit. Over and over again he had\nimplored them to take a rational view of the case, to borrow a few\npounds of him, to make a new beginning on clean soil. It was like\ncontending with some hostile force of nature; he spent himself in vain.\n\nAs Hewett did not return, he at length took his leave, and went into\nthe back-room for a moment.\n\n'She's asleep,' said Snowdon, rising from the chair where he had been\nsitting deep in thought. 'It's a good sign.'\n\nSidney just looked towards the bed, and nodded with satisfaction. The\nold man gave him a warm pressure of the hand, and he departed. All the\nway home, he thought with singular interest of the bare sick-room, of\nthe white-headed man watching through the night; the picture impressed\nhim in a way that could not be explained by its natural pathos merely;\nit kept suggesting all sorts of fanciful ideas, due in a measure,\npossibly, to Mrs. Hewett's speculations. For an hour he was so lost in\nmusing on the subject that he even rested from the misery of his\nceaseless thought of Clara.\n\nHe allowed three days to pass, then went to inquire about Jane's\nprogress. It had been satisfactory. Subsequent visits brought him to\nterms of a certain intimacy with Snowdon. The latter mentioned at\nlength that he was looking for two rooms, suitable for himself and\nJane. He wished them to be in a decent house, somewhere in Clerkenwell,\nand the rent was not to be more than a working man could afford.\n\n'You don't know of anything in your street?' he asked diffidently.\n\nSomething in the tone struck Sidney. It half expressed a wish to live\nin his neighbourhood if possible. He looked at his companion (they were\nwalking together), and was met in return with a glance of calm\nfriendliness; it gratified him, strengthened the feeling of respect and\nattachment which had already grown out of this intercourse. In Tysoe\nStreet, however, no accommodation could be found. Sidney had another\nproject in his thoughts; pursuing it, he paid a visit the next evening\nto certain acquaintances of his named Byass, who had a house in Hanover\nStreet, Islington, and let lodgings. Hanover Street lies to the north\nof City Road; it is a quiet byway, of curving form, and consists of\ndwellings only. Squalor is here kept at arm's length; compared with\nregions close at hand, this and the contiguous streets have something\nof a suburban aspect.\n\nThree or four steps led up to the house-door. Sidney's knock summoned a\nyoung, healthy-faced, comely woman, who evinced hearty pleasure on\nseeing who her visitor was. She brought him at once into a parlour on\nthe ground-floor.\n\n'Well, an' I was only this mornin' tellin' Sam to go an' look after\nyou, or write a note, or somethin'! Why can't you come round oftener?\nI've no patience with you! You just sit at 'ome an' get humped, an'\nwhat's the good o' that, I should like to know? I thought you'd took\noffence with me, an' so I told Sam. Do you want to know how baby is?\nWhy don't you ask, then, as you ought to do the first thing? He's a\ngood deal better than he deserves to be, young rascal--all the trouble\nhe gives me! He's fast asleep, I'm glad to say, so you can't see him.\nSam'll be back in a few minutes; at least I expect him, but there's no\nknowin' nowadays when he can leave the warehouse. What's brought you\nto-night, I wonder? You needn't tell me anything about the Upper Street\nbusiness; _I_ know all about _that_!'\n\n'Oh, do you? From Clara herself?'\n\n'Yes. Don't talk to me about her! There! I'm sick an tired of her--an'\nso are you, I should think, if you've any sense left. Her an' me can't\nget along, an' that's the truth. Why, when I met her on Sunday\nafternoon, she was that patronisin' you'd have thought she'd got a\nplace in Windsor Castle. Would she come an' have a cup of tea? Oh dear,\nno! Hadn't time! The Princess of Wales, I suppose, was waitin' round\nthe corner!'\n\nHaving so relieved her mind, Mrs. Byass laughed with a genuine gaiety\nwhich proved how little malice there was in her satire. Sidney could\nnot refuse a smile, but it was a gloomy one.\n\n'I'm not sure you've done all you might have to keep her friends with\nyou,' he said seriously, but with a good-natured look.\n\n'There you go!' exclaimed Mrs. Byass, throwing back her head. 'Of\ncourse everybody must be in fault sooner than _her_! She's an angel is\nMiss Hewett! Poor dear! to think how shameful she's been used! Now I do\nwonder how you've the face to say such things, Mr. Kirkwood! Why,\nthere's nobody else livin' would have been as patient with her as I\nalways was. I'm not bad-tempered, I will say that for myself, an' I've\nput up with all sorts of things (me, a married woman), when anyone else\nwould have boxed her ears and told her she was a conceited minx. I used\nto be fond of Clara; you know I did. But she's got beyond all bearin';\nand if you wasn't just as foolish as men always are, you'd see her in\nher true colours. Do shake yourself a bit, do! Oh, you silly, silly\nman!'\n\nAgain she burst into ringing laughter, throwing herself backwards and\nforwards, and at last covering her face with her hands. Sidney looked\nannoyed, but the contagion of such spontaneous merriment in the end\nbrought another smile to his face. He moved his head in sign of giving\nup the argument, and, as soon as there was silence, turned to the\nobject of his visit.\n\n'I see you've still got the card in the window. I shouldn't wonder if I\ncould find you a lodger for those top-rooms.'\n\n'And who's that? No children, mind.'\n\nSidney told her what he could of the old man. Of Jane he only said that\nshe had hitherto lived with the Hewetts' landlady, and was now going to\nbe removed by her grandfather, having just got through an illness. Dire\nvisions of infection at once assailed Mrs. Byass; impossible to admit\nunder the same roof with her baby a person who had just been ill. This\nscruple was, however, overcome; the two rooms at the top of the\nhouse--unfurnished--had been long vacant, owing to fastidiousness in\nMr. and Mrs. Byass, since their last lodger, after a fortnight of\ncontinuous drunkenness, broke the windows, ripped the paper off the\nwalls, and ended by trying to set fire to the house. Sidney was\nintrusted with an outline treaty, to be communicated to Mr. Snowdon.\n\nThis discussion was just concluded when Mr. Samuel Byass presented\nhimself--a slender, large-headed young man, with very light hair\ncropped close upon the scalp, and a foolish face screwed into an\nexpression of facetiousness. He was employed in some clerkly capacity\nat a wholesale stationer's in City Road. Having stepped into the room,\nhe removed a very brown silk hat and laid it on a chair, winking the\nwhile at Sidney with his right eye; then he removed his overcoat,\nwinking with the left eye. Thus disembarrassed, he strode gravely to\nthe fireplace, took up the poker, held it in the manner of a weapon\nupright against his shoulder, and exclaimed in a severe voice, 'Eyes\nright!' Then, converting the poker into a sword, he drew near to Sidney\nand affected to practise upon him the military cuts, his features\ndistorted into grotesque ferocity. Finally, assuming the attitude of a\njuggler, he made an attempt to balance the poker perpendicularly upon\nhis nose, until it fell with a crash, just missing the ornaments on the\nmantel-piece. All this time Mrs. Byass shrieked with laughter, with\ndifficulty keeping her chair.\n\n'Oh, Sam,' she panted forth, her handkerchief at her eyes, 'what a fool\nyou are! Do stop, or you'll kill me!'\n\nVastly gratified, Samuel advanced with ludicrous gestures towards the\nvisitor, held out his hand, and said with affected nasality, 'How do\nyou do, sir? It's some time since I had the pleasure of seeing you,\nsir. I hope you have been pretty tolerable.'\n\n'_Isn't_ he a fool, Mr. Kirkwood?' cried the delighted wife. 'Do just\ngive him a smack on the side of the head, to please me! Sam, go an'\nwash, an' we'll have supper. What do you mean by being so late\nto-night?'\n\n'Where's the infant?' asked Mr. Byass, thrusting his hands into his\nwaistcoat pockets and peering about the room. 'Bring forth the infant!\nLet a fond parent look upon his child.'\n\n'Go an' wash, or I'll throw something at you. Baby's in bed, and mind,\nyou wake him if you dare!'\n\nSidney would have taken his leave, but found it impossible. Mrs. Byass\ndeclared that if he would not stay to supper he should never enter the\nhouse again.\n\n'Let's make a night of it!' cried Sam, standing in the doorway. 'Let's\nhave three pots of six ale and a bottle of old Tom! Let us be reckless!'\n\nHis wife caught up the pillow from the sofa and hurled it at him.\nSamuel escaped just in time. The next moment his head was again thrust\nforward.\n\n'Let's send to the High Street for three cold roast fowls and a\nbeef-steak pie! Let's get custards and cheese-cakes and French pastry!\nLet's have a pine-apple and preserved ginger! Who says, Go it for once?'\n\nMrs. Byass caught up the poker and sprang after him. From the passage\ncame sounds of scuffling and screaming, and in the end of something\nproduced by the lips. Mrs. Byass then showed a very red face at the\ndoor, and said:\n\n'_Isn't_ he a fool? Just wait a minute while I get the table laid.'\n\nSupper was soon ready in the comfortable kitchen. A cold shoulder of\nmutton, a piece of cheese, pickled beetroot, a seed-cake, and raspberry\njam; such was the fare to which Bessie Byass invited her husband and\nher guest. On a side-table were some open cardboard boxes containing\nartificial flowers and leaves; for Bessie had now and then a little\n'mounting' to do for a shop in Upper Street, and in that way aided the\nincome of the family. She was in even better spirits than usual at the\nprospect of letting her top-rooms. On hearing that piece of news,\nSamuel, who had just come from the nearest public-house with a foaming\njug, executed a wild dance round the room and inadvertently knocked two\nplates from the dresser. This accident made his wife wrathful, but only\nfor a moment; presently she was laughing as unrestrainedly as ever, and\nbestowing upon the repentant young man her familiar flattery.\n\nAt eleven o'clock Sidney left them, and mused with smiles on his way\nhome. This was not exactly his ideal of domestic happiness, yet it was\nbetter than the life led by the Hewetts--better than that of other\nhouseholds with which he was acquainted--better far, it seemed to him,\nthan the aspirations which were threatening to lead poor Clara--who\nknew whither? A temptation beset him to walk round into Upper Street\nand pass Mrs. Tubbs's bar. He resisted it, knowing that the result\nwould only be a night of sleepless anger and misery.\n\nThe next day he again saw Snowdon, and spoke to him of Mrs. Byass's\nrooms. The old man seemed at first indisposed to go so far; but when he\nhad seen the interior of the house and talked with the landlady, his\nobjections disappeared. Before another week had passed the two rooms\nwere furnished in the simplest possible way, and Snowdon brought Jane\nfrom Clerkenwell Close.\n\nKirkwood came by invitation as soon as the two were fairly established\nin their home. He found Jane sitting by the fire in her grandfather's\nroom; a very little exertion still out-wearied her, and the strange\nthings that had come to pass had made her habitually silent. She looked\nabout her wonderingly, seemed unable to realise her position, was\npainfully conscious of her new clothes, ever and again started as if in\nfear.\n\n'Well, what did I say that night?' was Sidney's greeting. 'Didn't I\ntell you it would be all right soon?'\n\nJane made no answer in words, but locked at him timidly; and then a\nsmile came upon her face, an expression of joy that could not trust\nitself, that seemed to her too boldly at variance with all she had yet\nknown of life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nPENNYLOAF CANDY\n\nIn the social classification of the nether world--a subject which so\neminently adapts itself to the sportive and gracefully picturesque mode\nof treatment--it will be convenient to distinguish broadly, and with\nreference to males alone, the two great sections of those who do, and\nthose who do not, wear collars. Each of these orders would, it is\nobvious, offer much scope to an analyst delighting in subtle gradation.\nTaking the collarless, how shrewdly might one discriminate between the\nmany kinds of neckcloth which our climate renders necessary as a\nsubstitute for the nobler article of attire! The navvy, the scaffolder,\nthe costermonger, the cab-tout--innumerable would be the varieties of\ntexture, of fold, of knot, observed in the ranks of unskilled labour.\nAnd among these whose higher station is indicated by the linen or paper\nsymbol, what a gap between the mechanic with collar attached to a\nflannel shirt, and just visible along the top of a black tie, and the\nshopman whose pride it is to adorn himself with the very ugliest\nneck-encloser put in vogue by aristocratic sanction. For such attractive\ndisquisition I have, unfortunately, no space; it must suffice that I\nindicate the two genera. And I was led to do so in thinking of Bob\nHewett.\n\nBob wore a collar. In the die-sinking establishment which employed him\nthere were, it is true, two men who belonged to the collarless; but\ntheir business was down in the basement of the building, where they\nkept up a furnace, worked huge stamping-machines, and so on. Bob's\nworkshop was upstairs, and the companions with whom he sat, without\nexception, had something white and stiff round their necks; in fact,\nthey were every bit as respectable as Sidney Kirkwood, and such as he,\nwho bent over a jeweller's table. To John Hewett it was no slight\ngratification that he had been able to apprentice his son to a craft\nwhich permitted him always to wear a collar. I would not imply that\nJohn thought of the matter in these terms, but his reflections bore\nthis significance. Bob was raised for ever above the rank of those who\ndepend merely upon their muscles, even as Clara was saved from the\ndismal destiny of the women who can do nothing but sew.\n\nThere was, on the whole, some reason why John Hewett should feel pride\nin his eldest son. Like Sidney Kirkwood, Bob had early shown a faculty\nfor draughtsmansbip; when at school, he made decidedly clever\ncaricatures of such persons as displeased him, and he drew such\nwonderful horses (on the race-course or pulling cabs), such laughable\ndonkeys in costers' carts, such perfect dogs, that on several occasions\nsome friend had purchased with a veritable shilling a specimen of his\nwork. 'Put him to the die-sinking,' said an acquaintance of the family,\nhimself so employed; 'he'll find a use for this kind of thing some\nday.' Die-sinking is not the craft it once was; cheap methods,\nvulgarising here as everywhere, have diminished the opportunities of\ncapable men; but a fair living was promised the lad if he stuck to his\nwork, and at the age of nineteen he was already earning his pound a\nweek. Then he was clever in a good many other ways. He had an ear for\nmusic, played (nothing else was within his reach) the concertina, sang\na lively song with uncommon melodiousness--a gift much appreciated at\nthe meetings of a certain Mutual Benefit Club, to which his father had\npaid a weekly subscription, without fail, through all adversities. In\nthe regular departments of learning Bob had never shown any particular\naptitude; he wrote and read decently, but his speech, as you have had\noccasion for observing, was not marked by refinement, and for books he\nhad no liking. His father, unfortunately, had spoilt him, just as he\nhad spoilt Clara. Being of the nobly independent sex, between fifteen\nand sixteen he practically freed himself from parental control. The use\nhe made of his liberty was not altogether pleasing to John, but the\ntime for restraint and training had hopelessly gone by. The lad was\nselfish, that there was no denying; he grudged the money demanded of\nhim for his support; but in other matters he always showed himself so\neasy-tempered, so disposed to a genial understanding, that the great\nfault had to be blinked. Many failings might have been forgiven him in\nconsideration of the fact that he had never yet drunk too much, and\nindeed cared little for liquor.\n\nMen of talent, as you are aware, not seldom exhibit low tastes in their\nchoice of companionship. Bob was a case in point; he did not\nsufficiently appreciate social distinctions. He, who wore a collar,\nseemed to prefer associating with the collarless. There was Jack--more\nproperly 'Jeck'--Bartley, for instance, his bosom friend until they\nbegan to cool in consequence of a common interest in Miss Peckover.\nJack never wore a collar in his life, not even on Sundays, and was\nclosely allied with all sorts of blackguards, who somehow made a living\non the outskirts of turf-land. And there was Eli Snape, compared with\nwhom Jack was a person of refinement and culture. Eli dealt\nsurreptitiously in dogs and rats, and the mere odour of him was\nintolerable to ordinary nostrils; yet he was a species of hero in Bob's\nregard, such invaluable information could he supply with regard to\n'events' in which young Hewett took a profound interest. Perhaps a more\nserious aspect of Bob's disregard for social standing was revealed in\nhis relations with the other sex. Susceptible from his tender youth, he\nshowed no ambition in the bestowal of his amorous homage. At the age of\nsixteen did he not declare his resolve to wed the daughter of old Sally\nBudge, who went about selling watercress? and was there not a desperate\nconflict at home before this project could be driven from his head? It\nwas but the first of many such instances. Had he been left to his own\ndevices, he would already, like numbers of his coevals, have been\nsupporting (or declining to support) a wife and two or three children.\nAt present he was 'engaged' to Clem Peckover; that was an understood\nthing. His father did not approve it, but this connection was\nundeniably better than those he had previously declared or concealed.\nBob, it seemed evident, was fated to make a _mesalliance_--a pity,\nseeing his parts and prospects. He might have aspired to a wife who had\nscarcely any difficulty with her _h_'s; whose bringing-up enabled her\nto look with compassion on girls who could not play the piano; who\ncounted among her relatives not one collarless individual.\n\nClem, as we have seen, had already found, or imagined, cause for\ndissatisfaction with her betrothed. She was well enough acquainted with\nBob's repute, and her temper made it improbable, to say the least, that\nthe course of wooing would in this case run very smoothly. At present,\nvarious little signs were beginning to convince her that she had a\nrival, and the hints of her rejected admirer, Jack Bartley, fixed her\nsuspicions upon an acquaintance whom she had hitherto regarded merely\nwith contempt. This was Pennyloaf Candy, formerly, with her parents, a\nlodger in Mrs. Peckover's house. The family had been ousted some\neighteen months ago on account of failure to pay their rent and of the\nfrequent intoxication of Mrs. Candy. Pennyloaf's legal name was\nPenelope, which, being pronounced as a trisyllable, transformed itself\nby further corruption into a sound at all events conveying some\nmeaning. Applied in the first instance jocosely, the title grew\ninseparable from her, and was the one she herself always used. Her\nemployment was the making of shirts for export; she earned on an\naverage tenpence a day, and frequently worked fifteen hours between\nleaving and returning to her home. That Bob Hewett could interest\nhimself, with whatever motive, in a person of this description, Miss\nPeckover at first declined to believe. A hint, however, was quite\nenough to excite her jealous temperament; as proof accumulated, cunning\nand ferocity wrought in her for the devising of such a declaration of\nwar as should speedily scare Pennyloaf from the field. Jane Snowdon's\nremoval had caused her no little irritation; the hours of evening were\nheavy on her hands, and this new emotion was not unwelcome as a\ntemporary resource.\n\nAs he came home from work one Monday towards the end of April, Bob\nencountered Pennyloaf; she had a bundle in her hands and was walking\nhurriedly.\n\n'Hallo! that you?' he exclaimed, catching her by the arm. 'Where are\nyou going?'\n\n'I can't stop now. I've got some things to put away, an' it's nearly\neight.'\n\n'Come round to the Passage to-night. Be there at ten.'\n\n'I can't give no promise. There's been such rows at 'ome. You know\nmother summonsed father this mornin'?'\n\n'Yes, I've heard. All right! come if you can; I'll be there.'\n\nPennyloaf hastened on. She was a meagre, hollow-eyed, bloodless girl of\nseventeen, yet her features had a certain charm--that dolorous kind of\nprettiness which is often enough seen in the London needle-slave. Her\nhabitual look was one of meaningless surprise; whatever she gazed upon\nseemed a source of astonishment to her, and when she laughed, which was\nnot very often, her eyes grew wider than ever. Her attire was\nmiserable, but there were signs that she tried to keep it in order; the\nboots upon her feet were sewn and patched into shapelessness; her limp\nstraw hat had just received a new binding.\n\nBy saying that she had things 'to put away,' she meant that her\nbusiness was with the pawnbroker, who could not receive pledges after\neight o'clock. It wanted some ten minutes of the hour when she entered\na side-doorway, and, by an inner door, passed into one of a series of\ncompartments constructed before the pawnbroker's counter. She deposited\nher bundle, and looked about for someone to attend to her. Two young\nmen were in sight, both transacting business; one was conversing\nfacetiously with a customer on the subject of a pledge. Two or three\ngas-jets lighted the interior of the shop, but the boxes were in\nshadow. There was a strong musty odour; the gloom, the narrow\ncompartments, the low tones of conversation, suggested stealth and\nshame.\n\nPennyloaf waited with many signs of impatience, until one of the\nassistants approached, a smartly attired youth, with black hair greased\ninto the discipline he deemed becoming, with an aquiline nose, a coarse\nmouth, a large horseshoe pin adorning his necktie, and rings on his\nfingers. He caught hold of the packet and threw it open; it consisted\nof a petticoat and the skirt of an old dress.\n\n'Well, what is it?' he asked, rubbing his tongue along his upper lip\nbefore and after speaking.\n\n'Three an' six, please, sir.'\n\nHe rolled the things up again with a practised turn of the hand, and\nsaid indifferently, glancing towards another box, 'Eighteenpence.'\n\n'Oh, sir, we had two shillin's on the skirt not so long ago,' pleaded\nPennyloaf, with a subservient voice. 'Make it two shillin's--please do,\nsir!\n\nThe young man paid no attention; he was curling his moustache and\nexchanging a smile of intelligence with his counter-companion with\nrespect to a piece of business the latter had in hand. Of a sudden he\nturned and said sharply:\n\n'Well, are you goin' to take it or not?'\n\nPennyloaf sighed and nodded.\n\n'Got a 'apenny?' he asked.\n\n'No.'\n\nHe fetched a cloth, rolled the articles in it very tightly, and pinned\nthem up; then he made out ticket and duplicate, handling his pen with\nfacile flourish, and having blotted the little piece of card on a box\nof sand (a custom which survives in this conservative profession), he\nthrew it to the customer. Lastly, he counted out one shilling and\nfive pence halfpenny. The coins were sandy, greasy, and of scratched\nsurface.\n\nPennyloaf sped homewards. She lived in Shooter's Gardens, a picturesque\nlocality which demolition and rebuilding have of late transformed. It\nwas a winding alley, with paving raised a foot above the level of the\nstreet whence was its main approach. To enter from the obscurer end,\nyou descended a flight of steps, under a low archway, in a court itself\nnot easily discovered. From without, only a glimpse of the Gardens was\nobtainable; the houses curved out of sight after the first few yards,\nand left surmise to busy itself with the characteristics of the hidden\nportion. A stranger bold enough to explore would have discovered that\nthe Gardens had a blind offshoot, known simply as 'The Court.' Needless\nto burden description with further detail; the slum was like any other\nslum; filth, rottenness, evil odours, possessed these dens of\nsuperfluous mankind and made them gruesome to the peering imagination.\nThe inhabitants of course felt nothing of the sort; a room in Shooter's\nGardens was the only kind of home that most of them knew or desired.\nThe majority preferred it, on all grounds, to that offered them in a\nblock of model lodgings not very far away; here was independence, that\nis to say, the liberty to be as vile as they pleased. How they came to\nlove vileness, well, that is quite another matter, and shall not for\nthe present concern us.\n\nPennyloaf ran into the jaws of this black horror with the indifference\nof habit; it had never occurred to her that the Gardens were fearful in\nthe night's gloom, nor even that better lighting would have been a\nconvenience. Did it happen that she awoke from her first sleep with the\nring of ghastly shrieking in her ears, that was an incident of too\ncommon occurrence to cause her more than a brief curiosity; she could\nwait till the morning to hear who had half-killed whom. Four days ago\nit was her own mother's turn to be pounded into insensibility; her\nfather (a journeyman baker, often working nineteen hours out of the\ntwenty-four, which probably did not improve his temper), maddened by\nhis wife's persistent drunkenness, was stopped just on the safe side of\nmurder. To the amazement and indignation of the Gardens, Mrs. Candy\nprosecuted her sovereign lord; the case had been heard to-day, and\nCandy had been cast in a fine. The money was paid, and the baker went\nhis way, remarking that his family were to 'expect him back when they\nsaw him.' Mrs. Candy, on her return, was hooted through all the length\nof the Gardens, a demonstration of public feeling probably rather of\nbase than of worthy significance.\n\nAs Pennyloaf drew near to the house, a wild, discordant voice suddenly\nbroke forth somewhere in the darkness, singing in a high key, 'All ye\nworks of the Lord, bless ye the Lord, praise Him and magnify Him for\never!' It was Mad Jack, who had his dwelling in the Court, and at all\nhours was wont to practise the psalmody which made him notorious\nthroughout Clerkenwell. A burst of laughter followed from a group of\nmen and boys gathered near the archway. Unheeding, the girl passed in\nat an open door and felt her way up a staircase; the air was noisome,\nnotwithstanding a fierce draught which swept down the stairs. She\nentered a room lighted by a small metal lamp hanging on the wall--a\nprecaution of Pennyloaf's own contrivance. There was no bed, but one\nmattress lay with a few rags of bed-clothing spread upon it, and two\nothers were rolled up in a corner. This chamber accommodated, under\nordinary circumstances, four persons: Mr. and Mrs. Candy, Pennyloaf,\nand a son named Stephen, whose years were eighteen. (Stephen pursued\nthe occupation of a potman; his hours were from eight in the morning\ntill midnight on week-days, and on Sunday the time during which a\npublic-house is permitted to be open; once a month he was allowed\nfreedom after six o'clock.) Against the window was hung an old shawl\npierced with many rents. By the fire sat Mrs. Candy; she leaned\nforward, her head, which was bound in linen swathes, resting upon her\nhands.\n\n'What have you got?' she asked, in the thick voice of a drunkard,\nwithout moving.\n\n'Eighteenpence; it's all they'd give me.'\n\nThe woman cursed in her throat, but exhibited no anger with Pennyloaf.\n\n'Go an' get some tea an' milk,' she said, after a pause. 'There is\nsugar. An' bring seven o' coals; there's only a dust.'\n\nShe pointed to a deal box which stood by the hearth. Pennyloaf went out\nagain.\n\nOver the fireplace, the stained wall bore certain singular ornaments.\nThese were five coloured cards, such as are signed by one who takes a\npledge of total abstinence; each presented the signature, 'Maria\nCandy,' and it was noticeable that at each progressive date the\nhandwriting had become more unsteady. Yes, five times had Maria Candy\npromised, with the help of God, to abstain,' &c. &c.; each time she was\nin earnest. But it appeared that the help of God availed little against\nthe views of one Mrs. Green, who kept the beer-shop in Rosoman Street,\nonce Mrs. Peckover's, and who could on no account afford to lose so\ngood a customer. For many years that house, licensed for the sale of\nnon-spirituous liquors, had been working Mrs. Candy's ruin; not a\nparticle of her frame but was vitiated by the drugs retailed there\nunder the approving smile of civilisation. Spirits would have been\nharmless in comparison. The advantage of Mrs. Green's ale was that the\nvery first half-pint gave conscience its bemuddling sop; for a penny\nyou forgot all the cares of existence; for threepence you became a\nyelling maniac.\n\nPoor, poor creature. She was sober to-night, sitting over the fire with\nher face battered into shapelessness; and now that her fury had had its\nway, she bitterly repented invoking the help of the law against her\nhusband. What use? what use? Perhaps he had now abandoned her for good,\nand it was certain that the fear of him was the only thing that ever\nchecked her on the ruinous road she would so willingly have quitted.\nBut for the harm to himself, the only pity was he had not taken her\nlife outright. She knew all the hatefulness of her existence; she knew\nalso that only the grave would rescue her from it. The struggle was too\nunequal between Mrs. Candy with her appeal to Providence, and Mrs.\nGreen with the forces of civilisation at her back.\n\nPennyloaf speedily returned with a ha'p'orth of milk, a pennyworth of\ntea, and seven pounds (also price one penny) of coals in an apron. It\nwas very seldom indeed that the Candys had more of anything in their\nroom than would last them for the current day. There being no kettle,\nwater was put on to boil in a tin saucepan; the tea was made in a jug.\nPennyloaf had always been a good girl to her mother; she tended her as\nwell as she could to-night; but there was no word of affection from\neither. Kindly speech was stifled by the atmosphere of Shooter's\nGardens.\n\nHaving drunk her tea, Mrs. Candy lay down, as she was, on the already\nextended mattress, and drew the ragged coverings about her. In half an\nhour she slept.\n\nPennyloaf then put on her hat and jacket again and left the house. She\nwalked away from the denser regions of Clerkenwell, came to Sadler's\nWells Theatre (gloomy in its profitless recollection of the last worthy\nmanager that London knew), and there turned into Myddelton Passage. It\nis a narrow paved walk between brick walls seven feet high; on the one\nhand lies the New River Head, on the other are small gardens behind\nMyddelton Square. The branches of a few trees hang over; there are\ndoors, seemingly never opened, belonging one to each garden; a couple\nof gas-lamps shed feeble light. Pennyloaf paced the length of the\nPassage several times, meeting no one. Then a policeman came along with\nechoing tread, and eyed her suspiciously. She had to wait more than a\nquarter of an hour before Bob Hewett made his appearance. Greeting her\nwith a nod and a laugh, he took up a leaning position against the wall,\nand began to put questions concerning the state of things at her home.\n\n'And what'll your mother do if the old man don't give her nothing to\nlive on?' he inquired, when he had listened good-naturedly to the\nrecital of domestic difficulties.\n\n'Don't knew,' replied the girl, shaking her head, the habitual surprise\nof her countenance becoming a blank interrogation of destiny.\n\nBob kept kicking the wall, first with one heel, then with the other. He\nwhistled a few bars of the last song he had learnt at the music-hall.\n\n'Say, Penny,' he remarked at length, with something of shamefacedness,\n'there's a namesake of mine here as I shan't miss, if you can do any\ngood with it.'\n\nHe held a shilling towards her under his hand. Pennyloaf turned away,\ncasting down her eyes and looking troubled.\n\n'We can get on for a bit,' she said indistinctly.\n\nBob returned the coin to his pocket. He whistled again for a moment,\nthen asked abruptly:\n\n'Say! have you seen Clem again?'\n\n'No,' replied the girl, examining him with sudden acuteness. 'What\nabout her?'\n\n'Nothing much. She's got her back up a bit, that's all.'\n\n'About me?' Pennyloaf asked anxiously.\n\nBob nodded. As he was making some further remarks on the subject, a\nman's figure appeared at a little distance, and almost immediately\nwithdrew again round a winding of the Passage. A moment after there\nsounded from that direction a shrill whistle. Bob and the girl regarded\neach other.\n\n'Who was that?' said the former suspiciously. 'I half believe it was\nJeck Bartley. If Jeck is up to any of his larks, I'll make him remember\nit. You wait here a minute!'\n\nHe walked at a sharp pace towards the suspected quarter. Scarcely had\nhe gone half a dozen yards, when there came running from the other end\nof the Passage a girl whom Pennyloaf at once recognised. It was Clem\nPeckover; with some friend's assistance she had evidently tracked the\ncouple and was now springing out of ambush. She rushed upon Pennyloaf,\nwho for very alarm could not flee, and attacked her with clenched\nfists. A scream of terror and pain caused Bob to turn and run back.\nPennyloaf could not even ward off the blows that descended upon her\nhead; she was pinned against the wall, her hat was torn away, her hair\nbegan to fly in disorder. But Bob effected a speedy rescue. He gripped\nClem's muscular arms, and forced them behind her back as if he meant to\ndismember her. Even then it was with no slight effort that he\nrestrained the girl's fury.\n\n'You run off 'ome!' he shouted to Pennyloaf. 'If she tries this on\nagain, I'll murder her!'\n\nPennyloaf's hysterical cries and the frantic invectives of her\nassailant made the Passage ring. Again Bob roared to the former to be\noff, and was at length obeyed. When Pennyloaf was out of sight he\nreleased Clem. Her twisted arms caused her such pain that she threw\nherself against the wall, mingling maledictions with groans. Bob burst\ninto scornful laughter.\n\nClem went home vowing vengeance. In the nether world this trifling\ndissension might have been expected to bear its crop of violent\nlanguage and straightway pass into oblivion; but Miss Peckover's\nmalevolence was of no common stamp, and the scene of to-night\noriginated a feud which in the end concerned many more people than\nthose immediately interested.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nPATHOLOGICAL\n\nThrough the day and through the evening Clara Hewett had her place\nbehind Mrs. Tubbs's bar. For daylight wear, the dress which had\nformerly been her best was deemed sufficient; it was simple, but not\nbadly made, and became her figure. Her evening attire was provided by\nMrs. Tubbs, who recouped herself by withholding the promised wages for\na certain number of weeks. When Clara had surveyed this garment in the\nbar mirror, she turned away contemptuously; the material was cheap, the\nmode vulgar. It must be borne with for the present, like other\nindignities which she found to be inseparable from her position. As\nsoon as her employer's claim was satisfied, and the weekly five\nshillings began to be paid, Clara remembered the promise she had\nvolunteered to her father. But John was once more at work; for the\npresent there really seemed no need to give him any of her money, and\nshe herself, on the other hand, lacked so many things. This dress\nplainly would not be suitable for the better kind of engagement she had\nin view; it behoved her first of all to have one made in accordance\nwith her own taste. A mantle, too, a silk umbrella, gloves--It would be\nunjust to herself to share her scanty earnings with those at home.\n\nYes; but you must try to understand this girl of the people, with her\nunfortunate endowment of brains and defect of tenderness. That smile of\nhers, which touched and fascinated and made thoughtful, had of course a\nsignificance discoverable by study of her life and character. It was no\nmere affectation; she was not conscious, in smiling, of the expression\nupon her face. Moreover, there was justice in the sense of wrong\ndiscernible upon her features when the very self looked forth from\nthem. All through his life John Hewett had suffered from the same\nimpulse of revolt; less sensitively constructed than his daughter,\nuncalculating, inarticulate, he fumed and fretted away his energies in\na conflict with forces ludicrously personified. In the matter of his\nsecond marriage he was seen at his best, generously defiant of social\ncruelties; but self-knowledge was denied him, and circumstances\ncondemned his life to futility. Clara inherited his temperament;\ntransferred to her more complex nature, it gained in subtlety and in\npower of self-direction, but lost in its nobler elements. Her mother\nwas a capable and ambitious woman, one in whom active characteristics\nwere more prominent than the emotional. With such parents, every\nprobability told against her patient acceptance of a lot which allowed\nher faculties no scope. And the circumstances of her childhood were\nsuch as added a peculiar bitterness to the trials waiting upon her\nmaturity.\n\nClara, you remember, had reached her eleventh year when her father's\nbrother died and left the legacy of which came so little profit. That\nwas in 1878. State education had recently made a show of establishing\nitself, and in the Hewetts' world much argument was going on with\nreference to the new Board schools, and their advantages or\ndisadvantages when compared with those in which working-folk's children\nhad hitherto been taught. Clara went to a Church school, and the\nexpense was greater than the new system rendered necessary. Her\nfather's principles naturally favoured education on an independent\nbasis, but a prejudice then (and still) common among workpeople of\ndecent habits made him hesitate about sending his girl to sit side by\nside with the children of the street; and he was confirmed by Clara's\nown view of the matter. She spoke with much contempt of Board schools,\nand gave it to be understood that her religious convictions would not\nsuffer her to be taught by those who made light of orthodoxy. This\nattitude was intelligible enough in a child of sharp wit and abundant\nself-esteem. Notwithstanding her father's indifferentism, little Clara\nperceived that a regard for religion gave her a certain distinction at\nhome, and elsewhere placed her apart from 'common girls.' She was\nsubject also to special influences: on the one hand, from her favourite\nteacher, Miss Harrop; on the other, from a school-friend, Grace Rudd.\n\nMiss Harrop was a good, warm-hearted woman of about thirty, one of\nthose unhappy persons who are made for domestic life, but condemned by\nfate to school-celibacy. Lonely and impulsive, she drew to herself the\nmost interesting girl in her classes, and, with complete indiscretion,\nmade a familiar, a pet, a prodigy of one whose especial need was\ndiscipline. By her confidences and her flatteries she set Clara aflame\nwith spiritual pride. Ceaselessly she excited her to ambition, remarked\non her gifts, made dazzling forecast of her future. Clara was to be a\nteacher first of all, but only that she might be introduced to the\nnotice of people who would aid her to better things. And the child came\nto regard this as the course inevitably before her. Had she not already\nreceived school-prizes, among them a much-gilded little volume 'for\nreligious knowledge'? Did she not win universal applause when she\nrecited a piece of verse on prize-day--Miss Harrop (disastrous\nkindness!) even saying that the delivery reminded her of Mrs. ----, the\ncelebrated actress!\n\nGrace Rudd was busy in the same fatal work. Four years older than\nClara, weakly pretty, sentimental, conceited, she had a fancy for\npatronising the clever child, to the end that she might receive homage\nin return. Poor Grace! She left school, spent a year or two at home\nwith parents as foolish as herself, and--disappeared. Prior to that,\nMiss Harrop had also passed out of Clara's ken, driven by restlessness\nto try another school, away from London.\n\nThese losses appeared to affect Clara unfavourably. She began to\nneglect her books, to be insubordinate, to exhibit arrogance, which\nbrought down upon her plenty of wholesome reproof. Her father was not\nwithout a share in the responsibility for it all. Entering upon his\nfour hundred pounds, one of the first things John did was to hire a\npiano, that his child might be taught to play. Pity that Sidney\nKirkwood could not then cry with effective emphasis, 'We are the\nworking classes! we are the lower orders!' It was exactly what Hewett\nwould not bring himself to understand. What! His Clara must be robbed\nof chances just because her birth was not that of a young lady? Nay, by\nall the unintelligible Powers, she should enjoy every help that he\ncould possibly afford her. Bless her bright face and her clever tongue!\nYes, it was now a settled thing that she should be trained for a\nschoolteacher. An atmosphere of refinement must be made for her; she\nmust be better dressed, more delicately fed.\n\nThe bitter injustice of it! In the outcome you are already instructed.\nLong before Clara was anything like ready to enter upon a teacher's\ncareer, her father's ill-luck once more darkened over the home. Clara\nhad made no progress since Miss Harrop's day. The authorities directing\nher school might have come forward with aid of some kind, had it\nappeared to them that the girl would repay such trouble; but they had\ntheir forebodings about her. Whenever she chose, she could learn in\nfive minutes what another girl could scarcely commit to memory in\ntwenty; but it was obviously for the sake of display. The teachers\ndisliked her; among the pupils she had no friends. So at length there\ncame the farewell to school and the beginning of practical life, which\ntook the shape of learning to stamp crests and addresses on note-paper.\nThere was hope that before long Clara might earn thirteen shillings a\nweek.\n\nThe bitter injustice of it! Clara was seventeen now, and understood the\nfolly of which she had been guilty a few years ago, but at the same\ntime she felt in her inmost heart the tyranny of a world which takes\nrevenge for errors that are inevitable, which misleads a helpless child\nand then condemns it for being found astray. She could judge herself,\nyes, better than Sidney Kirkwood could judge her. She knew her defects,\nknew her vices, and a feud with fate caused her to accept them\ndefiantly. Many a time had she sobbed out to herself, 'I wish I could\nneither read nor write! I wish I had never been told that there is\nanything better than to work with one's hands and earn daily bread!'\nBut she could not renounce the claims that Nature had planted in her,\nthat her guardians had fostered. The better she understood how\ndifficult was every way of advancement, the more fiercely resolute was\nshe to conquer satisfactions which seemed beyond the sphere of her\ndestiny.\n\nOf late she had thought much of her childish successes in reciting\npoetry. It was not often that she visited a theatre (her father had\nalways refused to let her go with any one save himself or Sidney), but\non the rare occasions when her wish was gratified, she had watched each\nactress with devouring interest, with burning envy, and had said to\nherself, 'Couldn't I soon learn to do as well as that? Can't I see\nwhere it might be made more lifelike? Why should it be impossible for\nme to go on the stage?' In passing a shop-window where photographs were\nexposed, she looked for those of actresses, and gazed at them with\nterrible intensity. 'I am as good-looking as she is. Why shouldn't _my_\nportrait be seen some day in the windows?' And then her heart throbbed,\nsmitten with passionate desire. As she walked on there was a turbid\ngloom about her, and in her ears the echoing of a dread temptation. Of\nall this she spoke to nobody.\n\nFor she had no friends. A couple of years ago something like an\nintimacy had sprung up between her and Bessie Jones (since married and\nbecome Bessie Byass), seemingly on the principle of contrast in\nassociation. Bessie, like most London workgirls, was fond of the\ntheatre, and her talk helped to nourish the ambition which was secretly\ndeveloping in Clara. But the two could not long harmonise. Bessie, just\nafter her marriage, ventured to speak with friendly reproof of Clara's\nbehaviour to Sidney Kirkwood. Clara was not disposed to admit freedoms\nof that kind; she half gave it to be understood that, though others\nmight be easily satisfied, she had views of her own on such subjects.\nThereafter Mrs. Byass grew decidedly cool. The other girls with whom\nClara had formal intercourse showed no desire to win her confidence;\nthey were kept aloof by her reticent civility.\n\nAs for Sidney himself, it was not without reason that he had seen\nencouragement in the girl's first reply to his advances. At sixteen,\nClara found it agreeable to have her good graces sought by the one man\nin whom she recognised superiority of mind and purpose. Of all the\nunbetrothed girls she knew not one but would have felt flattered had\nKirkwood thus distinguished her. Nothing common adhered to his\ndemeanour, to his character; he had the look of one who will hold his\nown in life; his word had the ring of truth. Of his generosity she had\ninnumerable proofs, and it contrasted nobly with the selfishness of\nyoung men as she knew them; she appreciated it all the more because her\nown frequent desire to be unselfish was so fruitless. Of awakening\ntenderness towards him she knew nothing, but she gave him smiles and\nwords which might mean little or much, just for the pleasure of\ncompleting a conquest. Nor did she, in truth, then regard it as\nimpossible that, sooner or later, she might become his wife. If she\n_must_ marry a workman, assuredly it should be Sidney. He thought so\nhighly of her, he understood things in her to which the ordinary\nartisan would have been dead; he had little delicacies of homage which\ngave her keen pleasure. And yet--well, time enough!\n\nTime went very quickly, and changed both herself and Sidney in ways she\ncould not foresee. It was true, all he said to her in anger that night\nby the prison wall--true and deserved every word of it. Even in\nacknowledging that, she hardened herself against him implacably. Since\nhe chose to take this tone with her, to throw aside all his graceful\nblindness to her faults, he had only himself to blame if she considered\neverything at an end between them. She tried to believe herself glad\nthis had happened; it relieved her from an embarrassment, and made her\nabsolutely free to pursue the ambitions which now gave her no rest. For\nall that, she could not dismiss Sidney from her mind; indeed,\nthroughout the week that followed their parting, she thought of him\nmore persistently than for many months. That he would before long seek\npardon for his rudeness she felt certain, she felt also that such\nsubmission would gratify her in a high degree. But the weeks were\npassing and no letter came; in vain she glanced from the window of the\nbar at the faces which moved by. Even on Sunday, when she went home for\nan hour or two, she neither saw nor heard of Kirkwood. She could not\nbring herself to ask a question.\n\nUnder any circumstances Clara would ill have borne a suspense that\nirritated her pride, and at present she lived amid conditions so\nrepugnant, that her nerves were ceaselessly strung almost beyond\nendurance. Before entering upon this engagement she had formed but an\nimperfect notion of what would be demanded of her. To begin with, Mrs.\nTubbs belonged to the order of women who are by nature slave-drivers;\nthough it was her interest to secure Clara for a permanency, she began\nby exacting from the girl as much labour as could possibly be included\nin their agreement. The hours were insufferably long; by nine o'clock\neach evening Clara was so outworn that with difficulty she remained\nstanding, yet not until midnight was she released. The unchanging\nodours of the place sickened her, made her head ache, and robbed her of\nall appetite. Many of the duties were menial, and to perform them\nfevered her with indignation. Then the mere waiting upon such men as\nformed the majority of the customers, vulgarly familiar, when not\ninsolent, in their speech to her, was hateful beyond anything she had\nconceived. Had there been no one to face but her father, she would have\nreturned home and resumed her old occupation at the end of the first\nfortnight, so extreme was her suffering in mind and body; but rather\nthan give Sidney Kirkwood such a triumph, she would work on, and\nbreathe no word of what she underwent. Even in her anger against him,\nthe knowledge of his forgiving disposition, of the sincerity of his\nlove, was an unavowed support. She knew he could not utterly desert\nher; when some day he sought a reconciliation, the renewal of conflict\nbetween his pride and her own would, she felt, supply her with new\ncourage.\n\nEarly one Saturday afternoon she was standing by the windows, partly\nfrom heavy idleness of thought, partly on the chance that Kirkwood\nmight go by, when a young, well-dressed man, who happened to be passing\nat a slow walk, turned his head and looked at her. He went on, but in a\nfew moments Clara, who had moved back into the shop, saw him enter and\ncome forwards. He took a seat at the counter and ordered a luncheon.\nClara waited upon him with her customary cold reserve, and he made no\nremark until she returned him change out of the coin he offered.\n\nThen he said with an apologetic smile:\n\n'We are old acquaintances, Miss Hewett, but I'm afraid you've forgotten\nme.'\n\nClara regarded him in astonishment. His age seemed to be something\nshort of thirty; he had a long, grave, intelligent face, smiled\nenigmatically, spoke in a rather slow voice. His silk hat, sober\nnecktie drawn through a gold ring, and dark morning-coat, made it\nprobable that he was 'in the City.'\n\n'We used to know each other very well about five years ago,' he\npursued, pocketing his change carelessly. 'Don't you remember a Mr.\nScawthorne, who used to be a lodger with some friends of yours called\nRudd?'\n\nOn the instant memory revived in Clara. In her schooldays she often\nspent a Sunday afternoon with Grace Rudd, and this Mr. Scawthorne was\ngenerally at the tea-table. Mr. and Mrs. Rudd made much of him, said\nthat he held a most important post in a lawyer's office, doubtless had\nprivate designs concerning him and their daughter. Thus aided, she even\nrecognised his features.\n\n'And you knew me again after all this time?'\n\n'Yours isn't an easy face to forget,' replied Mr. Scawthorne, with the\nsubdued polite smile which naturally accompanied his tone of\nunemotional intimacy. 'To tell you the whole truth, however, I happened\nto hear news of you a few days ago. I met Grace Rudd; she told me you\nwere here. Some old friend had told _her_.'\n\nGrace's name awoke keen interest in Clara. She was startled to hear it,\nand did not venture to make the inquiry her mind at once suggested. Mr.\nScawthorne observed her for an instant, then proceeded to satisfy her\ncuriosity. Grace Rudd was on the stage; she had been acting in\nprovincial theatres under the name of Miss Danvers, and was now waiting\nfor a promised engagement at a minor London theatre.\n\n'Do you often go to the theatre?' he added carelessly. 'I have a great\nmany acquaintances connected with the stage in one way or another. If\nyou would like, I should be very glad to send you tickets now and then.\nI always have more given me than I can well use.'\n\nClara thanked him rather coldly, and said that she was very seldom free\nin the evening. Thereupon Mr. Scawthorne again smiled, raised his hat,\nand departed.\n\nPossibly he had some consciousness of the effect of his words, but it\nneeded a subtler insight, a finer imagination than his, to interpret\nthe pale, beautiful, harassed face which studiously avoided looking\ntowards him as he paused before stepping out on to the pavement. The\nrest of the evening, the hours of night that followed, passed for Clara\nin hot tumult of heart and brain. The news of Grace Rudd had flashed\nupon her as revelation of a clear possibility where hitherto she had\nseen only mocking phantoms of futile desire. Grace was an actress; no\nmatter by what course, to this she had attained. This man, Scawthorne,\nspoke of the theatrical life as one to whom all its details were\nfamiliar; acquaintance with him of a sudden bridged over the chasm\nwhich had seemed impassable. Would he come again to see her? Had her\ninvoluntary reserve put an end to any interest he might have felt in\nher? Of him personally she thought not at all; she could not have\nrecalled his features; he was a mere abstraction, the representative of\na wild hope which his conversation had inspired.\n\nFrom that day the character of her suffering was altered; it became\nless womanly, it defied weakness and grew to a fever of fierce,\nunscrupulous rebellion. Whenever she thought of Sidney Kirkwood, the\ninjury he was inflicting upon her pride rankled into bitter resentment,\nunsoftened by the despairing thought of self-subdual which had at times\nvisited her sick weariness. She bore her degradations with the sullen\nindifference of one who is supported by the hope of a future revenge.\nThe disease inherent in her being, that deadly outcome of social\ntyranny which perverts the generous elements of youth into mere seeds\nof destruction, developed day by day, blighting her heart, corrupting\nher moral sense, even setting marks of evil upon the beauty of her\ncountenance. A passionate desire of self-assertion familiarised her\nwith projects, with ideas, which formerly she had glanced at only to\ndismiss as ignoble. In proportion as her bodily health failed, the\nworst possibilities of her character came into prominence. Like a\ncreature that is beset by unrelenting forces, she summoned and surveyed\nall the craft faculties lurking in the dark places of her nature;\ntheoretic y she had now accepted every debasing compact by which a\nwoman can spite herself on the world's injustice. Self-assertion; to be\nno longer an unregarded atom in the mass of those who are born only to\nlabour for others; to find play for the strength and the passion which,\nby no choice of her own, distinguished her from the tame slave.\nSometimes in the silence of night she suffered from a dreadful need of\ncrying aloud, of uttering her anguish in a scream like that of\ninsanity. She stifled it only by crushing her face into the pillow\nuntil the hysterical fit had passed, and she lay like one dead.\n\nA fortnight after his first visit Mr. Scawthorne again presented\nhimself, polite, smiling, perhaps rather more familiar. He stayed\ntalking for nearly an hour, chiefly of the theatre. Casually he\nmentioned that Grace Rudd had got her engagement--only a little part in\na farce. Suppose Clara came to see her play some evening? Might he take\nher? He could at any time have places in the dress-circle.\n\nClara accepted the invitation. She did so without consulting Mrs.\nTubbs, and when it became necessary to ask for the evening's freedom,\ndifficulties were made. 'Very well,' said Clara, in a tone she had\nnever yet used to her employer, 'then I shall leave you.' She spoke\nwithout a moment's reflection; something independent of her will seemed\nto direct her in speech and act. Mrs. Tubbs yielded.\n\nClara had not yet been able to obtain the dress she wished for. Her\nsavings, however, were sufficient for the purchase of a few\naccessories, which made her, she considered, not unpresentable.\nScawthorne was to have a cab waiting for her at a little distance from\nthe luncheon-bar. It was now June, and at the hour of their meeting\nstill broad daylight, but Clara cared nothing for the chance that\nacquaintances might see her; nay, she had a reckless desire that Sidney\nKirkwood might pass just at this moment. She noticed no one whom she\nknew, however; but just as the cab was turning into Pentonville Road,\nScawthorne drew her attention to a person on the pavement.\n\n'You see that old fellow,' he said. 'Would you believe that he is very\nwealthy?'\n\nClara had just time to perceive an old man with white hair, dressed as\na mechanic.\n\n'But I know him,' she replied. 'His name's Snowdon.'\n\n'So it is. How do you come to know him?' Scawthorne inquired with\ninterest.\n\nShe explained.\n\n'Better not say anything about it,' remarked her companion. 'He's an\neccentric chap. I happen to know his affairs in the way of business. I\noughtn't to have told secrets, but I can trust you.'\n\nA gentle emphasis on the last word, and a smile of more than usual\nintimacy. But his manner was, and remained through the evening,\nrespectful almost to exaggeration. Clara seemed scarcely conscious of\nhis presence, save in the act of listening to what he said. She never\nmet his look, never smiled. From entering the theatre to leaving it,\nshe had a high flush on her face. Impossible to recognise her friend in\nthe actress whom Scawthorne indicated; features and voice were wholly\nstrange to her. In the intervals, Scawthorne spoke of the difficulties\nthat beset an actress's career at its beginning.\n\n'I suppose you never thought of trying it?' he asked. 'Yet I fancy you\nmight do well, if only you could have a few months' training, just to\nstart you. Of course it all depends on knowing how to go about it. A\nlittle money would be necessary--not much.'\n\nClara made no reply. On the way home she was mute. Scawthorne took\nleave of her in Upper Street, and promised to look in again before\nlong. . . .\n\nUnder the heat of these summer days, in the reeking atmosphere of the\nbar, Clara panted fever-stricken. The weeks went on; what strength\nsupported her from the Monday morning to the Saturday midnight she\ncould not tell. Acting and refraining, speaking and holding silence,\nthese things were no longer the consequences of her own volition. She\nwished to break free from her slavery, but had not the force to do so;\nsomething held her voice as often as she was about to tell Mrs. Tubbs\nthat this week would be the last. Her body wasted so that all the\ngarments she wore were loose upon her. The only mental process of which\nshe was capable was reviewing the misery of days just past and\nanticipating that of the days to come. Her only feelings were infinite\nself-pity and a dull smouldering hatred of all others in the world. A\ndoctor would have bidden her take to bed, as one in danger of grave\nillness. She bore through it without change in her habits, and in time\nthe strange lethargy passed.\n\nScawthorne came to the bar frequently. He remarked often on her look of\nsuffering, and urged a holiday. At length, near the end of July, he\ninvited her to go up the river with him on the coming Bank-holiday.\nClara consented, though aware that her presence would be more than ever\nnecessary at the bar on the day of much drinking. Later in the evening\nshe addressed her demand to Mrs. Tubbs. It was refused.\n\nWithout a word of anger, Clara went upstairs, prepared herself for\nwalking, and set forth among the by-ways of Islington. In half an hour\nshe had found a cheap bedroom, for which she paid a week's rent in\nadvance. She purchased a few articles of food and carried them to her\nlodging, then lay down in the darkness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE LAST COMBAT\n\nDuring these summer months Sidney Kirkwood's visits to the house in\nClerkenwell Close were comparatively rare. It was not his own wish to\nrelax in any degree the close friendship so long subsisting between the\nHewetts and himself, but from the day of Clara's engagement with Mrs.\nTubbs John Hewett began to alter in his treatment of him. At first\nthere was nothing more than found its natural explanation in regret of\nwhat had happened, a tendency to muteness, to troubled brooding; but\nbefore long John made it unmistakable that the young man's presence was\nirksome to him. If, on coming home, he found Sidney with Mrs. Hewett\nand the children, a cold nod was the only greeting he offered; then\nfollowed signs of ill-humour, such as Sidney could not in the end fail\nto interpret as unfavourable to himself. He never heard Clara's name on\nher father's lips, and himself never uttered it when John was in\nhearing.\n\n'She told him what passed between us that night,' Sidney argued\ninwardly. But it was not so. Hewett had merely abandoned himself to an\nunreasonable resentment. Notwithstanding his concessions, he blamed\nSidney for the girl's leaving home, and, as his mood grew more\nirritable, the more hopeless it seemed that Clara would return, he\nnursed the suspicion of treacherous behaviour on Sidney's part. He\nwould not take into account any such thing as pride which could forbid\nthe young man to urge a rejected suit. Sidney had grown tired of Clara,\nthat was the truth, and gladly caught at any means of excusing himself.\nHe had made new friends. Mrs. Peckover reported that he was a constant\nvisitor at the old man Snowdon's lodgings; she expressed her belief\nthat Snowdon had come back from Australia with a little store of money,\nand if Kirkwood had knowledge of that, would it not explain his\ninterest in Jane Snowdon?\n\n'For shame to listen to such things!' cried Mrs. Hewett angrily, when\nher husband once repeated the landlady's words, 'I'd be ashamed of\nmyself, John! If you don't know him no better than that, you ought to\nby this time.'\n\nAnd John did, in fact, take to himself no little shame, but his\nunsatisfied affection turned all the old feelings to bitterness. In\nspite of himself, he blundered along the path of perversity. Sidney,\ntoo, had his promptings of obstinate humour. When he distinctly\nrecognised Hewett's feeling it galled him; he was being treated with\ngross injustice, and temper suggested reprisals which could answer no\npurpose but to torment him with self-condemnation. However, he must\nneeds consult his own dignity; he could not keep defending himself\nagainst ignoble charges. For the present, there was no choice but to\naccept John's hints, and hold apart as much as was possible without\nabsolute breach of friendly relations. Nor could he bring himself to\napproach Clara. It was often in his mind to write to her; had he obeyed\nthe voice of his desire he would have penned such letters as only the\nself-abasement of a passionate lover can dictate. But herein, too, the\nstrain of sternness that marked his character made its influence felt.\nHe said to himself that the only hope of Clara's respecting him lay in\nhis preservation of the attitude he had adopted, and as the months went\non he found a bitter satisfaction in adhering so firmly to his purpose.\nThe self-flattery with which no man can dispense whispered assurance\nthat Clara only thought the more of him the longer he held aloof. When\nthe end of July came, he definitely prescribed to his patience a trial\nof yet one more month. Then he would write Clara a long letter, telling\nher what it had cost him to keep silence, and declaring the constancy\nhe devoted to her.\n\nThis resolve he registered whilst at work one morning. The triumphant\nsunshine, refusing to be excluded even from London workshops, gleamed\nupon his tools and on the scraps of jewellery before him; he looked up\nto the blue sky, and thought with heavy heart of many a lane in Surrey\nand in Essex where he might be wandering but for this ceaseless\nnecessity of earning the week's wage. A fly buzzed loudly against the\ngrimy window, and by one of those associations which time and change\ncannot affect, he mused himself back into boyhood. The glimpse before\nhim of St. John's Arch aided the revival of old impressions; his hand\nceased from its mechanical activity, and he was absorbed in a waking\ndream, when a voice called to him and said that he was wanted. He went\ndown to the entrance, and there found Mrs. Hewett. Her coming at all\nwas enough to signal some disaster, and the trouble on her face caused\nSidney to regard her with silent interrogation.\n\n'I couldn't help comin' to you,' she began, gazing at him fixedly. 'I\nknow you can't do anything, but I had to speak to somebody, an' I know\nnobody better than you. It's about Clara.'\n\n'What about her?'\n\n'She's left Mrs. Tubbs. They had words about Bank-holiday last night,\nan' Clara went off at once. Mrs. Tubbs thought she'd come 'ome, but\nthis mornin' her box was sent for, an' it was to be took to a house in\nIslington. An' then Mrs. Tubbs came an' told me. An' there's worse than\nthat, Sidney. She's been goin' about to the theatre an' such places\nwith a man as she got to know at the bar, an' Mrs. Tubbs says she\nbelieves it's him has tempted her away.'\n\nShe spoke the last sentences in a low voice, painfully watching their\neffect.\n\n'And why hasn't Mrs. Tubbs spoken about this before?' Sidney asked,\nalso in a subdued voice, but without other show of agitation.\n\n'That's just what, I said to her myself. The girl was in her charge,\nan' it was her duty to let us know if things went wrong. But how am I\nto tell her father? I dursn't do it, Sidney; for my life, I dursn't!\nI'd go an' see her where she's lodging--see, I've got the address wrote\ndown here--but I should do more harm than good; she'd never pay any\nheed to me at the best of times, an' it isn't likely she would now.'\n\n'Look here if she's made no attempt to hide away, you may be quite sure\nthere's no truth in what Mrs. Tubbs says. They've quarrelled, and of\ncourse the woman makes Clara as black as she can. Tell her father\neverything as soon as he comes home; you've no choice.'\n\nMrs. Hewett averted her face in profound dejection. Sidney learnt at\nlength what her desire had been in coming to him; she hoped he would\nsee Clara and persuade her to return home.\n\n'I dursn't tell her' father,' she kept repeating. 'But perhaps it isn't\ntrue what Mrs. Tubbs says. Do go an' speak to her before it's too late.\nSay we won't ask her to come 'ome, if only she'll let us know what\nshe's goin' to do.'\n\nIn the end he promised to perform this service, and to communicate the\nresult that evening. It was Saturday; at half-past one he left the\nworkroom, hastened home to prepare himself for the visit, and, without\nthinking of dinner, set out to find the address Mrs. Hewett had given\nhim. His steps were directed to a dull street on the north of\nPentonville Road; the house at which he mad e inquiry was occupied by a\ndrum-manufacturer. Miss Hewett, he learnt, was not at home; she had\ngone forth two hours ago, and nothing was known of her movements.\nSidney turned away and began to walk up and down the shadowed side of\nthe street; there was no breath of air stirring, and from the open\nwindows radiated stuffy odours. A quarter of an hour sufficed to\nexasperate him with anxiety and physical malaise. He suffered from his\ninability to do anything at once, from conflict with himself as to\nwhether or not it behoved him to speak with John Hewett; of Clara he\nthought with anger rather than fear, for her behaviour seemed to prove\nthat nothing had happened save the inevitable breach with Mrs. Tubbs.\nJust as he had said to himself that it was no use waiting about all the\nafternoon, he saw Clara approaching. At sight of him she manifested\nneither surprise nor annoyance, but came forward with eyes carelessly\naverted. Not having seen her for so long, Sidney was startled by the\nchange in her features; her cheeks had sunk, her eyes were unnaturally\ndark, there was something worse than the familiar self-will about her\nlips.\n\n'I've been waiting to see you,' he said. 'Will you walk along here for\na minute or two?'\n\n'What do you want to say? I'm tired.'\n\n'Mrs. Tubbs has told your mother what has happened, and she came to me.\nYour father doesn't know yet.'\n\n'It's nothing to me whether he knows or not. I've left the place,\nthat's all, and I'm going to live here till I've got another.'\n\n'Why not go home?'\n\n'Because I don't choose to. I don't see that it concerns you, Mr.\nKirkwood.'\n\nTheir eyes met, and Sidney felt how little fitted he was to reason with\nthe girl, even would she consent to hear him. His mood was the wrong\none; the torrid sunshine seemed to kindle an evil fire in him, and with\ndifficulty he kept back words of angry unreason; he even--strangest of\ninconsistencies--experienced a kind of brutal pleasure in her obvious\nmisery. Already she was reaping the fruit of obstinate folly. Clara\nread what his eyes expressed; she trembled with responsive hostility.\n\n'No, it doesn't concern me,' Sidney replied, half turning away. 'But\nit's perhaps as well you should know that Mrs. Tubbs is doing her best\nto take away your good name. However little we are to each other, it's\nmy duty to tell you that, and put you on your guard. I hope your father\nmayn't hear these stories before you have spoken to him yourself.'\n\nClara listened with a contemptuous smile.\n\n'What has she been saying?'\n\n'I shan't repeat it.'\n\nAs he gazed at her, the haggardness of her countenance smote like a\nsword-edge through all the black humours about his heart, piercing the\nvery core of love and pity. He spoke in a voice of passionate appeal.\n\n'Clara, come home before it is too late! Come with me--now--come at\nonce? Thank heaven you have got out of that place! Come home, and stay\nthere quietly till we can find you something better.'\n\n'I'll die rather than go home!' was her answer, flung at him as if in\nhatred. 'Tell my father that, and tell him anything else you like. I\nwant no one to take any thought for me; and I wouldn't do as _you_\nwish, not to save my soul!'\n\nHow often, in passing along the streets, one catches a few phrases of\ndiscord such as this! The poor can seldom command privacy; their scenes\nalike of tenderness and of anger must for the most part be enacted on\nthe peopled ways. It is one of their misfortunes, one of the many\nnecessities which blunt feeling, which balk reconciliation, which\nenhance the risks of dialogue at best semi-articulate.\n\nClara, having uttered the rancour which had so long poisoned her mind,\nstraightway crossed the street and entered the house where she was\nlodging. She had just returned from making several applications for\nemployment--futile, as so many were likely to be, if she persevered in\nher search for a better place than the last. The wages due to her for\nthe present week she had of course sacrificed; her purchases of\nclothing--essential and superfluous--had left only a small sum out of\nher earnings. Food, fortunately, would cost her little; the difficulty,\nindeed, was to eat anything at all.\n\nShe was exhausted after her long walk, and the scene with Sidney had\nmade her tremulous. In thrusting open the windows, as soon as she\nentered, she broke a pane which was already cracked; the glass cut into\nher palm, and blood streamed forth. For a moment she watched the red\ndrops falling to the floor, then began to sob miserably, almost as a\nchild might have done. The exertion necessary for binding the wound\nseemed beyond her strength; sobbing and moaning, she stood in the same\nattitude until the blood began to congeal. The tears, too, she let dry\nunneeded upon her eyelashes and her cheeks; the mist with which for a\ntime they obscured her vision was nothing amid that cloud of misery\nwhich blackened about her spirit as she brooded. The access of\nself-pity was followed, as always, by a persistent sense of intolerable\nwrong, and that again by a fierce desire to plunge herself into ruin,\nas though by such act she could satiate her instincts of defiance. It\nis a phase of exasperated egotism common enough in original natures\nfrustrated by circumstance--never so pronounced as in those who suffer\nfrom the social disease. Such mood perverts everything to cause of\nbitterness. The very force of sincerity, which Clara could not but\nrecognise in Kirkwood's appeal, inflamed the resentment she nourished\nagainst him; she felt that to yield would be salvation and happiness,\nyet yield she might not, and upon him she visited the anger due to the\nevil impulses in her own heart. He spoke of her father, and in so doing\nstruck the only nerve in her which conveyed an emotion of tenderness;\ninstantly the feeling begot self-reproach, and of self-reproach was\nborn as quickly the harsh self-justification with which her pride ever\nanswered blame. She had made her father's life even more unhappy than\nit need have been, and to be reminded of that only drove her more\nresolutely upon the recklessness which would complete her ingratitude.\n\nThe afternoon wore away, the evening, a great part of the night. She\nate a few mouthfuls of bread, but could not exert herself to make tea.\nIt would be necessary to light a fire, and already the air of the room\nwas stifling.\n\nAfter a night of sleeplessness, she could only lie on her bed through\nthe Sunday morning, wretched in a sense of abandonment. And then began\nto assail her that last and subtlest of temptations, the thought that\nalready she had taken an irrevocable step, that an endeavour to return\nwould only be trouble spent in vain, that the easy course was, in\ntruth, the only one now open to her. Mrs. Tubbs was busy circulating\ncalumnies; that they were nothing more than calumnies could never be\nproved; all who heard them would readily enough believe. Why should she\nstruggle uselessly to justify herself in the eyes of people predisposed\nto condemn her? Fate was busy in all that had happened during the last\ntwo days. Why had she quitted her situation at a moment's notice? Why\non this occasion rather than fifty times previously? It was not her own\ndoing; something impelled her, and the same force--call it chance or\ndestiny--would direct the issue once more. All she could foresee was\nthe keeping of her appointment with Scawthorne to-morrow morning; what\nuse to try and look further, when assuredly a succession of\ncircumstances impossible to calculate would in the end constrain her?\nThe best would be if she could sleep out the interval.\n\nAt mid-day she rose, ate and drank mechanically, then contemplated the\nhours that must somehow be killed. There was sunlight in the sky, but\nto what purpose should she go out? She went to the window, and surveyed\nthe portion of street that was visible. On the opposite pavement, at a\nlittle distance, a man was standing; it was Sidney Kirkwood. The sight\nof him roused her from apathy; her blood tingled, rushed into her\ncheeks and throbbed at her temples. So, for all she had said, he was\ndaring to act the spy! He suspected her; he was lurking to surprise\nvisitors, to watch her outgoing and coming in. Very well; at least he\nhad provided her with occupation.\n\nFive minutes later she saw that he had gone away. Thereupon--having in\nthe meantime clad herself--she left the house and walked at a quick\nstep towards a region of North London with which she had no\nacquaintance. In an hour's time she had found another lodging, which\nshe took by the day only. Then back again to Islington. She told her\nlandlady that a sudden necessity compelled her to leave; she would have\na cab and remove her box at once. There was the hazard that Sidney\nmight return just as she was leaving; she braved it, and in another ten\nminutes was out of reach. .\n\nLet his be the blame. She had warned him, and he chose to disregard her\nwish. Now she had cut the last bond that fretted her, and the hours\nrushed on like a storm-wind driving her whither they would.\n\nHer mind was relieved from the stress of conflict; despair had given\nplace to something that made her laugh at all the old scruples. So far\nfrom dreading the judgments that would follow her disappearance, she\nfelt a pride in evil repute. Let them talk of her! If she dared\neverything, it would be well understood that she had not done so\nwithout a prospect worthy of herself. If she broke away from the\nobligations of a life that could never be other than poor and\ncommonplace, those who knew her would estimate the compensation she had\nfound. Sidney Kirkwood was aware of her ambitions; for his own sake he\nhad hoped to keep her on the low level to which she was born; now let\nhim recognise his folly! Some day she would present herself before\nhim:--'Very sorry that I could not oblige you, my dear sir, but you see\nthat my lot was to be rather different from that you kindly planned for\nme.' Let them gossip and envy!\n\nIt was a strange night that followed. Between one and two o'clock the\nheavens began to be overflashed with summer lightning; there was no\nthunder, no rain. The blue gleams kept illuminating the room for more\nthan an hour. Clara could not lie in bed. The activity of her brain\nbecame all but delirium; along her nerves, through all the courses of\nher blood, seemed to run fires which excited her with an indescribable\nmingling of delight and torment. She walked to and fro, often speaking\naloud, throwing up her arms. She leaned from the open window and let\nthe lightning play freely upon her face: she fancied it had the effect\nof restoring her wasted health. Whatever the cause, she felt stronger\nand more free from pain than for many months.\n\nAt dawn she slept. The striking of a church-clock woke her at nine,\ngiving her just time to dress with care and set forth to keep her\nappointment.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nA DISAPPOINTMENT\n\nOn ordinary Sundays the Byasses breakfasted at ten o'clock; this\nmorning the meal was ready at eight, and Bessie's boisterous spirits\ndeclared the exception to be of joyous significance. Finding that\nSamuel's repeated promises to rise were the merest evasion, she rushed\ninto the room where he lay fly-fretted, dragged the pillows from under\nhis tousled head, and so belaboured him in schoolboy fashion that he\nhad no choice but to leap towards his garments. In five minutes he\nroared down the kitchen-stairs for shaving-water, and in five minutes\nmore was seated in his shirt-sleeves, consuming fried bacon with\nprodigious appetite. Bessie had the twofold occupation of waiting upon\nhim and finishing the toilet of the baby; she talked incessantly and\nlaughed with an echoing shrillness which would have given a headache\nfor the rest of the day to any one of average nervous sensibility.\n\nThey were going to visit Samuel's parents, who lived at Greenwich.\nBessie had not yet enjoyed an opportunity of exhibiting her first-born\nto the worthy couple; she had, however, written many and long letters\non the engrossing subject, and was just a little fluttered with natural\nanxiety lest the infant's appearance or demeanour should disappoint the\nexpectations she had excited. Samuel found his delight in foretelling\nthe direst calamities.\n\n'Don't say I didn't advise you to draw it mild,' he remarked whilst\nbreakfasting, when Bessie had for the tenth time obliged him to look\nround and give his opinion on points of costume. 'Remember it was only\nlast week you told them that the imp had never cried since the day of\nhis birth, and I'll bet you three half-crowns to a bad halfpenny he\nroars all through to-night.'\n\n'Hold your tongue, Sam, or I'll throw something at you!'\n\nSamuel had just appeased his morning hunger, and was declaring that the\nday promised to be the hottest of the year, such a day as would bring\nout every vice inherent in babies, when a very light tap at the door\ncaused Bessie to abandon her intention of pulling his ears.\n\n'That's Jane,' she said. 'Come in!'\n\nThe Jane who presented herself was so strangely unlike her namesake who\nlay ill at Mrs. Peckover's four months ago, that one who had not seen\nher in the interval would with difficulty have recognised her. To begin\nwith, she had grown a little; only a little, but enough to give her the\nappearance of her full thirteen years. Then her hair no longer\nstraggled in neglect, but was brushed very smoothly back from her\nforehead, and behind was plaited in a coil of perfect neatness; one\ncould see now that it was soft, fine, mouse-coloured hair, such as\nwould tempt the fingers to the lightest caress. No longer were her\nlimbs huddled over with a few shapeless rags; she wore a full-length\ndress of quiet grey, which suited well with her hair and the pale tones\nof her complexion. As for her face--oh yes, it was still the good,\nsimple, unremarkable countenance, with the delicate arched eyebrows,\nwith the diffident lips, with the cheeks of exquisite smoothness, but\nso sadly thin.\n\nHere too, however, a noteworthy change was beginning to declare itself.\nYou were no longer distressed by the shrinking fear which used to be\nher constant expression; her eyes no longer reminded you of a poor\nanimal that has been beaten from every place where it sought rest and\nno longer expects anything but a kick and a curse. Timid they were,\ndrooping after each brief glance, the eyes of one who has suffered and\ncannot but often brood over wretched memories, who does not venture to\nlook far forward lest some danger may loom inevitable--meet them for an\ninstant, however, and you saw that lustre was reviving in their still\ndepths, that a woman's soul had begun to manifest itself under the\nshadow of those gently falling lids. A kind word, and with what purity\nof silent gratitude the grey pupils responded! A merry word, and mark\nif the light does not glisten on them, if the diffident lips do not\nform a smile which you would not have more decided lest something of\nits sweetness should be sacrificed.\n\n'Now come and tell me what you think about baby,' cried Bessie. 'Will\nhe do? Don't pay any attention to my husband; he's a vulgar man!'\n\nJane stepped forward.\n\n'I'm sure he looks very nice, Mrs. Byass.'\n\n'Of course he does, bless him! Sam, get your coat on, and brush your\nhat, and let Miss Snowdon teach you how to behave yourself. Well, we're\ngoing to leave the house in your care, Jane. We shall be back _some\ntime_ to-morrow night, but goodness knows when. Don't you sit up for\nus.'\n\n'You know where to wire to if there's a fire breaks out in the back\nkitchen,' observed Samuel facetiously. 'If you hear footsteps in the\npassage at half-past two to-morrow morning don't trouble to come down;\nwait till daylight to see whether they've carried off the dresser.'\n\nBessie screamed with laughter.\n\n'What a fool you are, Sam! If you don't mind, you'll be making Jane\nlaugh. You're sure you'll be home before dark to-morrow, Jane?'\n\n'Oh, quite sure. Mr. Kirkwood says there's a train gets to Liverpool\nStreet about seven, and grandfather thought that would suit us.'\n\n'You'll be here before eight then. Do see that your fire's out before\nyou leave. And you'll be sure to pull the door to? And see that the\narea-gate's fastened.'\n\n'Can't you find a few more orders?' observed Samuel.\n\n'Hold your tongue! Jane doesn't mind; do you, Jane? Now, Sam, are you\nready? Bless the man, if he hasn't got a great piece of bread sticking\nin his whiskers! How _did_ it get there? Off you go!'\n\nJane followed them, and stood at the front door for a moment, watching\nthem as they departed.\n\nThen she went upstairs. On the first floor the doors of the two rooms\nstood open, and the rooms were bare. The lodgers who had occupied this\npart of the house had recently left; a card was again hanging in the\nwindow of Bessie's parlour. Jane passed up the succeeding flight and\nentered the chamber which looked out upon Hanover Street. The\ntruckle-bed on which her grandfather slept had been arranged for the\nday some two hours ago; Snowdon rose at six, and everything was orderly\nin the room when Jane came to prepare breakfast an hour later. At\npresent the old man was sitting by the open window, smoking a pipe. He\nspoke a few words with reference to the Byasses, then seemed to resume\na train of thought, and for a long time there was unbroken silence.\nJane seated herself at a table, on which were a few books and writing\nmaterials. She began to copy something, using the pen with difficulty,\nand taking extreme pains. Occasionally her eyes wandered, and once they\nrested upon her grandfather's face for several minutes. But for the cry\nof a milkman or a paper-boy in the street, no sound broke the quietness\nof the summer morning. The blessed sunshine, so rarely shed from a\nLondon sky--sunshine, the source of all solace to mind and\nbody--reigned gloriously in heaven and on earth.\n\nWhen more than an hour had passed, Snowdon came and sat down beside the\ngirl. Without speaking she showed him what she had written. He nodded\napprovingly.\n\n'Shall I say it to you, grandfather?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\nJane collected her thoughts, then began to repeat the parable of the\nSamaritan. From the first words it was evident that she frequently thus\ndelivered passages committed to memory; evident, too, that instruction\nand a natural good sense guarded her against the gabbling method of\nrecitation. When she had finished Snowdon spoke with her for awhile on\nthe subject of the story. In all he said there was the earnestness of\ndeep personal feeling. His theme was the virtue of Compassion; he\nappeared to rate it above all other forms of moral goodness, to regard\nit as the saving principle of human life.\n\n'If only we had pity on one another, all the worst things we suffer\nfrom in this world would be at an end. It's because men's hearts are\nhard that life is so full of misery. If we could only learn to be kind\nand gentle and forgiving--never mind anything else. We act as if we\nwere all each other's enemies; we can't be merciful, because we expect\nno mercy; we struggle to get as much as we can for ourselves and care\nnothing for others. Think about it; never let it go out of your mind.\nPerhaps some day it'll help you in your own life.'\n\nThen there was silence again. Snowdon went back to his seat by the\nwindow and relit his pipe; to muse in the sunshine seemed sufficient\noccupation for him. Jane opened another book and read to herself.\n\nIn the afternoon they went out together. The old man had grown more\ntalkative. He passed cheerfully from subject to subject, now telling a\nstory of his experiences abroad, now reviving recollections of London\nas he had known it sixty years ago. Jane listened with quiet interest.\nShe did not say much herself, and when she did speak it was with a\nnoticeable effort to overcome her habit of diffidence. She was happy,\nbut her nature had yet to develop itself under these strangely novel\nconditions.\n\nA little before sunset there came a knocking at the house-door. Jane\nwent down to open, and found that the visitor was Sidney Kirkwood. The\njoyful look with which she recognised him changed almost in the same\nmoment; his face wore an expression that alarmed her; it was stern,\nhard-set in trouble, and his smile could not disguise the truth.\nWithout speaking, he walked upstairs and entered Snowdon's room. To\nSidney there was always something peculiarly impressive in the first\nview of this quiet chamber; simple as were its appointments, it\nproduced a sense of remoteness from the common conditions of life.\nInvariably he subdued his voice when conversing here. A few flowers\nsuch as can be bought in the street generally diffused a slight scent\nthrough the air, making another peculiarity which had its effect on\nSidney's imagination. When Jane moved about, it was with a soundless\nstep; if she placed a chair or arranged things on the table, it was as\nif with careful avoidance of the least noise. When his thoughts turned\nhitherwards, Sidney always pictured the old man sitting in his familiar\nmood of reverie, and Jane, in like silence, bending over a book at the\ntable. Peace, the thing most difficult to find in the world that Sidney\nknew, had here made itself a dwelling.\n\nHe shook hands with Snowdon and seated himself. A few friendly words\nwere spoken, and the old man referred to an excursion they had agreed\nto make together on the morrow, the general holiday.\n\n'I'm very sorry,' replied Kirkwood, 'but it'll be impossible for me to\ngo.'\n\nJane was standing near him; her countenance fell, expressing uttermost\ndisappointment.\n\n'Something has happened,' pursued Sidney, 'that won't let me go away,\neven for a few hours. I don't mean to say that it would really prevent\nme, but I should be so uneasy in my mind all the time that I couldn't\nenjoy myself, and I should only spoil your pleasure. Of course you'll\ngo just the same?'\n\nSnowdon reassured him on this point. Jane had just been about to lay\nsupper; she continued her task, and Sidney made a show of sharing the\nmeal. Soon after, as if conscious that Sidney would speak with more\nfreedom of his trouble but for her presence, Jane bade them good-night\nand went to her own room. There ensued a break in the conversation;\nthen Kirkwood said, with the abruptness of one who is broaching a\ndifficult subject:\n\n'I should like to tell you what it is that's going wrong with me. I\ndon't think anyone's advice would be the least good, but it's a\nmiserable affair, and I shall feel better for speaking about it.'\n\nSnowdon regarded him with eyes of calm sympathy. There is a look of\nhelpful attention peculiar to the faces of some who have known much\nsuffering; in this instance, the grave force of character which at all\ntimes made the countenance impressive heightened the effect of its\ngentleness. In external matters, the two men knew little more of each\nother now than after their first meeting, but the spiritual alliance\nbetween them had strengthened with every conversation. Each understood\nthe other's outlook upon problems of life, which are not commonly\ndiscussed in the top rooms of lodging-houses; they felt and thought\ndifferently at times, but in essentials they were at one, and it was\nthe first time that either had found such fruitful companionship.\n\n'Did you hear anything from the Peckovers of Clara Hewett?' Sidney\nbegan by asking.\n\n'Not from them. Jane has often spoken of her.'\n\nSidney again hesitated, then, from a fragmentary beginning, passed into\na detailed account of his relations with Clara. The girl herself, had\nshe overheard him, could not have found fault with the way in which the\nstory was narrated. He represented his love as from the first without\nresponse which could give him serious hope; her faults he dealt with\nnot as characteristics to be condemned, but as evidences of suffering,\nthe outcome of cruel conditions. Her engagement at the luncheon-bar he\nspoke of as a detestable slavery, which had wasted her health and\ndriven her in the end to an act of desperation. What now could be done\nto aid her? John Hewett was still in ignorance of the step she had\ntaken, and Sidney described himself as distracted by conflict between\nwhat he felt to be his duty, and fear of what might happen if he\ninvoked Hewett's authority. At intervals through the day he had been\ngoing backwards and forwards in the street where Clara had her lodging.\nHe did not think she would seek to escape from her friends altogether,\nbut her character and circumstances made it perilous for her to live\nthus alone.\n\n'What does she really wish for?' inquired Snowdon, when there had been\na short silence.\n\n'She doesn't know, poor girl! Everything in the life she has been\nliving is hateful to her--everything since she left school. She can't\nrest in the position to which she was born; she aims at an impossible\nchange of circumstances. It comes from her father; she can't help\nrebelling against what seem to her unjust restraints. But what's to\ncome of it? She may perhaps get a place in a large restaurant--and what\ndoes that mean?'\n\nHe broke off, but in a moment resumed even more passionately:\n\n'What a vile, cursed world this is, where you may see men and women\nperish before your eyes, and no more chance of saving them than if they\nwere going down in mid-ocean! She's only a child--only just\nseventeen--and already she's gone through a lifetime of miseries. And\nI, like a fool, I've often been angry with her; I was angry yesterday.\nHow can she help her nature? How can we any of us help what we're\ndriven to in a world like this? Clara isn't made to be one of those who\nslave to keep themselves alive. Just a chance of birth! Suppose she'd\nbeen the daughter of a rich man; then everything we now call a fault in\nher would either have been of no account or actually a virtue. Just\nbecause we haven't money we may go to perdition, and comfortable people\ntell us we've only ourselves to blame. Put _them_ in our place!'\n\nSnowdon's face had gone through various changes as Sidney flung out his\nvehement words. When he spoke, it was in a tone of some severity.\n\n'Has she no natural affection for her father? Does she care nothing for\nwhat trouble she brings him?'\n\nSidney did not reply at once; as he was about to speak, Snowdon bent\nforward suddenly and touched his arm.\n\n'Let me see her. Let me send Jane to her to-morrow morning, and ask her\nto come here. I might--I can't say--but I might do some good.'\n\nTo this Sidney gave willing assent, but without sanguine expectation.\nIn further talk it was agreed between them that, if this step had no\nresult, John Hewett ought to be immediately informed of the state of\nthings.\n\nThis was at ten o'clock on Sunday evening. So do we play our\ntragi-comedies in the eye of fate.\n\nThe mention of Jane led to a brief conversation regarding her before\nSidney took his leave. Since her recovery she had been going regularly\nto school, to make up for the time of which she had been defrauded by\nMrs. Peckover. Her grand-father's proposal was, that she should\ncontinue thus for another six months, after which, he said, it would be\ntime for her to learn a business. Mrs. Byass had suggested the choice\nof artificial-flower making, to which she herself had been brought up;\npossibly that would do as well as anything else.\n\n'I suppose so,' was Sidney's reluctant acquiescence. 'Or as ill as\nanything else, would be a better way to put it.'\n\nSnowdon regarded him with unusual fixedness, and seemed on the point of\nmaking some significant remark; but immediately his face expressed\nchange of purpose, and he said, without emphasis:\n\n'Jane must be able to earn her own living.'\n\nSidney, before going home, walked round to the street in which he had\nalready lingered several times to-day, and where yesterday he had\nspoken with Clara. The windows of the house he gazed at were dark.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n'IO SATURNALIA!'\n\nSo at length came Monday, the first Monday in August, a day gravely set\napart for the repose and recreation of multitudes who neither know how\nto rest nor how to refresh themselves with pastime. To-day will the\nslaves of industrialism don the _pileus_. It is high summertide. With\njoy does the awaking publican look forth upon the blue-misty heavens,\nand address his adorations to the Sun-god, inspirer of thirst. Throw\nwide the doors of the temple of Alcohol! Behold, we come in our\nthousands, jingling the coins that shall purchase us this one day of\ntragical mirth. Before us is the dark and dreary autumn; it is a far\ncry to the foggy joys of Christmas. Io Saturnalia!\n\nFor certain friends of ours this morning brought an event of\nimportance. At a church in Clerkenwell were joined together in holy\nmatrimony Robert Hewett and Penelope (otherwise Pennyloaf) Candy, the\nformer aged nineteen, the latter less than that by nearly three years.\nJohn Hewett would have nothing to do with an alliance so disreputable;\nMrs. Hewett had in vain besought her stepson not to marry so\nunworthily. Even as a young man of good birth has been known to enjoy a\nsubtle self-flattery in the thought that he graciously bestows his name\nupon a maiden who, to all intents and purposes, may be said never to\nhave been born at all, so did Bob Hewett feel when he put a ring upon\nthe scrubby finger of Pennyloaf. Proudly conscious was Bob that he a\n'married beneath him'--conscious also that Clem Peckover was gnawing\nher lips in rage.\n\nMrs. Candy was still sober at the hour of the ceremony. Her husband,\nnot a bad fellow in his way, had long since returned to her, and as yet\nhad not done more than threaten a repetition of his assault. Both were\npresent at church. A week ago Bob had established himself in a room in\nShooter's Gardens, henceforth to be shared with him by his bride.\nProbably he might have discovered a more inviting abode for the early\ndays of married life, but Bob had something of the artist's temperament\nand could not trouble about practical details; for the present this\nroom would do as well as another. It was cheap, and he had need of all\nthe money he could save from everyday expenses. Pennyloaf would go en\nwith her shirt-making, of course, and all they wanted was a roof over\ntheir heads at night.\n\nAnd in truth he was fond of Pennyloaf. The poor little slave worshipped\nhim so sincerely; she repaid his affectionate words with such fervent\ngratitude; and there was no denying that she had rather a pretty face,\nwhich had attracted him from the first. But above all, this preference\naccorded to so humble a rival had set Clem Peckover beside herself. It\nwas all very well for Clem to make pretence of having transferred her\naffections to Jack Bartley. Why, Suke Jollop (ostensibly Clem's bosom\nfriend, but treacherous at times because she had herself given an eye\nto Jack)--Suke Jollop reported that Clem would have killed Pennyloaf\nhad she dared. Pennyloaf had been going about in fear for her life\nsince that attack upon her in Myddelton Passage. 'I dursn't marry you,\nBob! I dursn't!' she kept saying, when the proposal was first made. But\nBob laughed with contemptuous defiance. He carried his point, and now\nhe was going to spend his wedding-day at the Crystal Palace--choosing\nthat resort because he knew Clem would be there, and Jack Bartley, and\nSuke Jollop, and many another acquaintance, before whom he was resolved\nto make display of magnanimity.\n\nPennyloaf shone in most unwonted apparel. Everything was new except her\nboots--it had been decided that these only needed soleing. Her\nbroad-brimmed hat of yellow straw was graced with the reddest feather\npurchasable in the City Road; she had a dolman of most fashionable cut,\nblue, lustrous; blue likewise was her dress, hung about with bows and\nstreamers. And the gleaming ring on the scrubby small finger! On that\nhand most assuredly Pennyloaf would wear no glove. How proud she was of\nher ring! How she turned it round and round when nobody was looking!\nGold, Pennyloaf, real gold! The pawnbroker would lend her\nseven-and-sixpence on it, any time.\n\nAt Holborn Viaduct there was a perpetual rush of people for the trains\nto the 'Paliss.' As soon as a train was full, off it went, and another\nlong string of empty carriages drew up in its place. No distinction\nbetween 'classes' to-day; get in where you like, where you can.\nPositively, Pennyloaf found herself seated in a first-class carriage;\nshe would have been awe-struck, but that Bob flung himself back on the\ncushions with such an easy air, and nodded laughingly at her. Among\ntheir companions was a youth with a concertina; as soon as the train\nmoved he burst into melody. It was the natural invitation to song, and\nall joined in the latest ditties learnt at the music-hall. Away they\nsped, over the roofs of South London, about them the universal glare of\nsunlight, the carriage dense with tobacco-smoke. He for the bottle of\nmuddy ale, passed round in genial fellowship from mouth to mouth!\nPennyloaf would not drink of it; she had a dread of all such bottles.\nIn her heart she rejoiced that Bob knew no craving for strong liquor.\nTowards the end of the journey the young man with the concertina passed\nround his hat.\n\nClem Peckover had come by the same train; she was one of a large party\nwhich had followed close behind Bob and Pennyloaf to the railway\nstation. Now they followed along the long corridors into the 'Paliss,'\nwith many a loud expression of mockery, with hee-hawing laughter, with\ncoarse jokes. Depend upon it, Clem was gorgeously arrayed; amid her\nsatellites she swept on 'like a stately ship of Tarsus, bound for the\nisles of Javan or Gadire;' her face was aflame, her eyes flashed in\nenjoyment of the uproar. Jack Bartley wore a high hat--Bob never had\nowned one in his life--and about his neck was a tie of crimson; yellow\nwas his waistcoat, even such a waistcoat as you may see in Pall Mall,\nand his walking-stick had a nigger's head for handle. He was the oracle\nof the maidens around him; every moment the appeal was to 'Jeck! Jeck!'\nSuke Jollop, who would in reality have preferred to accompany Bob and\nhis allies, whispered it about that Jack had two-pound-ten in his\npocket, and was going to spend every penny of it before he left the\n'Paliss'--yes, 'every bloomin' penny!'\n\nThus early in the day, the grounds were of course preferred to the\ninterior of the glass house. Bob and Pennyloaf bent their steps to the\nfair. Here already was gathered much goodly company; above their heads\nhung a thick white wavering cloud of dust. Swing-boats and\nmerry-go-rounds are from of old the chief features of these rural\nfestivities; they soared and dipped and circled to the joyous music of\norgans which played the same tune automatically for any number of\nhours, whilst raucous voices invited all and sundry to take their turn.\nShould this delight pall, behold on every hand such sports as are\ndearest to the Briton, those which call for strength of sinew and\nexactitude of aim. The philosophic mind would have noted with interest\nhow ingeniously these games were made to appeal to the patriotism of\nthe throng. Did you choose to 'shy' sticks in the contest for\ncocoa-nuts, behold your object was a wooden model of the treacherous\nAfghan or the base African. If you took up the mallet to smite upon a\nspring and make proof of how far you could send a ball flying upwards,\nyour blow descended upon the head of some other recent foeman. Try your\nfist at the indicator of muscularity, and with zeal you smote full in\nthe stomach of a guy made to represent a Russian. If you essayed the\npop-gun, the mark set you was on the flank of a wooden donkey, so\ncontrived that it would kick when hit in the true spot. What a joy to\nobserve the tendency of all these diversions! How characteristic of a\nhigh-spirited people that nowhere could be found any amusement\nappealing to the mere mind, or calculated to effeminate by encouraging\na love of beauty.\n\nBob had a sovereign to get rid of. He shied for cocoa-nuts, he swung in\nthe boat with Pennyloaf, he rode with her on the whirligigs. When they\nwere choked, and whitened from head to foot, with dust, it was natural\nto seek the nearest refreshment-booth. Bob had some half-dozen male and\nfemale acquaintances clustered about him by now; of course. He must\ncelebrate the occasion by entertaining all of them. Consumed with\nthirst, he began to drink without counting the glasses. Pennyloaf\nplucked at his elbow, but Bob was beginning to feel that he must\ndisplay spirit. Because he was married, that was no reason for his\nrelinquishing the claims to leadership in gallantry which had always\nbeen recognised. Hollo! Here was Suke Jollop! She had just quarrelled\nwith Clem, and had been searching for the hostile camp. 'Have a drink,\nSuke!' cried Bob, when he heard her acrimonious charges against Clem\nand Jack. A pretty girl, Suke, and with a hat which made itself proudly\nmanifest a quarter of a mile away. Drink! of course she would drink;\nthat thirsty she could almost drop! Bob enjoyed this secession from the\nenemy. He knew Suke's old fondness for him, and began to play upon it.\nElated with beer and vanity, he no longer paid the least attention to\nPennyloaf's remonstrances; nay, he at length bade her 'hold her\nbloomin' row!' Pennyloaf had a tear in her eye; she looked fiercely at\nMiss Jollop.\n\nThe day wore on. For utter weariness Pennyloaf was constrained to beg\nthat they might go into the 'Paliss' and find a shadowed seat. Her tone\nrevived tenderness in Bob; again he became gracious, devoted; he\npromised that not another glass of beer should pass his lips, and Sake\nJollop, with all her like, might go to perdition. But heavens! how\nsweltering it was under this glass canopy. How the dust rose from the\ntrampled boards! Come, let's have tea. The programme says there'll be a\nmilitary band playing presently, and we shall return refreshed to hear\nit.\n\nSo they made their way to the 'Shilling Tea-room.' Having paid at the\nentrance, they were admitted to feed freely on all that lay before\nthem. With difficulty could a seat be found in the huge room; the\nuproar of voices was deafening. On the tables lay bread, butter, cake\nin hunches, tea-pots, milk-jugs, sugar-basins--all things to whomso\ncould secure them in the conflict. Along the gangways coursed\nperspiring waiters, heaping up giant structures of used plates and\ncups, distributing clean utensils, and miraculously sharp in securing\nthe gratuity expected from each guest as he rose satiate. Muscular men\nin aprons wheeled hither the supplies of steaming fluid in immense cans\non heavy trucks. Here practical joking found the most graceful of\nopportunities, whether it were the deft direction of a piece of cake at\nthe nose of a person sitting opposite, or the emptying of a saucer down\nyour neighbour's back, or the ingenious jogging of an arm which was in\nthe act of raising a full tea-cup. Now and then an ill-conditioned\nfellow, whose beer disagreed with him, would resent some piece of\nelegant trifling, and the waiters would find it needful to request\ngentlemen not to fight until they had left the room. These cases,\nhowever, were exceptional. On the whole there reigned a spirit of\nimbecile joviality. Shrieks of female laughter testified to the success\nof the entertainment.\n\nAs Bob and his companion quitted this sphere of delight, ill-luck\nbrought it to pass that Mr. Jack Bartley and his train were on the\npoint of entering. Jack uttered a phrase of stinging sarcasm with\nreference to Pennyloaf's red feather; whereupon Bob smote him exactly\nbetween the eyes. Yells arose; there was a scuffle, a rush, a tumult.\nThe two were separated before further harm came of the little\nmisunderstanding, but Jack went to the tea-tables vowing vengeance.\n\nPoor Pennyloaf shed tears as Bob led her to the place where the band\nhad begun playing. Only her husband's anger prevented her from yielding\nto utter misery. But now they had come to the centre of the building,\nand by dint of much struggle in the crowd they obtained a standing\nwhence they could see the vast amphitheatre, filled with thousands of\nfaces. Here at length was quietness, intermission of folly and\nbrutality. Bob became another man as he stood and listened. He looked\nwith kindness into Pennyloaf's pale, weary face, and his arm stole\nabout her waist to support her. Ha! Pennyloaf was happy! The last trace\nof tears vanished. She too was sensible of the influences of music; her\nheart throbbed as she let herself lean against her husband.\n\nWell, as every one must needs have his panacea for the ills of society,\nlet me inform you of mine. To humanise the multitude two things are\nnecessary--two things of the simplest kind conceivable. In the first\nplace, you must effect an entire change of economic conditions: a\npreliminary step of which every tyro will recognise the easiness; then\nyou must bring to bear on the new order of things the constant\ninfluence of music. Does not the prescription recommend itself? It is\njesting in earnest. For, work as you will, there is no chance of a new\nand better world until the old be utterly destroyed. Destroy, sweep\naway, prepare the ground; then shall music the holy, music the\nciviliser, breathe over the renewed earth, and with Orphean magic raise\nin perfected beauty the towers of the City of Man.\n\nHours yet before the fireworks begin. Never mind; here by good luck we\nfind seats where we can watch the throng passing and repassing. It is a\ngreat review of the People. On the whole how respectable they are, how\nsober, how deadly dull! See how worn-out the poor girls are becoming,\nhow they gape, what listless eyes most of them have! The stoop in the\nshoulders so universal among them merely means over-toil in the\nworkroom. Not one in a thousand shows the elements of taste in dress;\nvulgarity and worse glares in all but every costume. Observe the\nmiddle-aged women; it would be small surprise that their good looks had\nvanished, but whence comes it they are animal, repulsive, absolutely\nvicious in ugliness? Mark the men in their turn: four in every six have\nvisages so deformed by ill-health that they excite disgust; their hair\nis cut down to within half an inch of the scalp; their legs are twisted\nout of shape by evil conditions of life from birth upwards. Whenever a\nyouth and a girl come along arm-in-arm, how flagrantly shows the man's\ncoarseness! They are pretty, so many of these girls, delicate of\nfeature, graceful did but their slavery allow them natural development;\nand the heart sinks as one sees them side by side with the men who are\nto be their husbands.\n\nOne of the livelier groups is surging hitherwards; here we have frolic,\nhere we have humour. The young man who leads them has been going about\nall day with the lining of his hat turned down over his forehead; for\nthe thousandth time those girls are screaming with laughter at the\nsight of him. Ha, ha! He has slipped and fallen upon the floor, and\nmakes an obstruction; his companions treat him like a horse that is\n'down' in the street. 'Look out for his 'eels!' cries one; and another,\n'Sit on his 'ed!' If this doesn't come to an end we shall die of\nlaughter. Lot one of the funniest of the party is wearing a gigantic\ncardboard nose and flame-coloured whiskers. There, the stumbler is on\nhis feet again. ''Ere he comes up smilin'!' cries his friend of the\ncardboard nose, and we shake our diaphragms with mirth. One of the\nparty is an unusually tall man. 'When are you comin' down to have a\nlook at us?' cries a pert lass as she skips by him.\n\nA great review of the People. Since man came into being did the world\never exhibit a sadder spectacle?\n\nEvening advances; the great ugly building will presently be lighted\nwith innumerable lamps. Away to the west yonder the heavens are afire\nwith sunset, but at that we do not care to look; never in our lives did\nwe regard it. We know not what is meant by beauty or grandeur. Here\nunder the glass roof stand white forms of undraped men and women--casts\nof antique statues--but we care as little for the glory of art as for\nthat of nature; we have a vague feeling that, for some reason or other,\nantiquity excuses the indecent, but further than that we do not get.\n\nAs the dusk descends there is a general setting of the throng towards\nthe open air; all the pathways swarm with groups which have a tendency\nto disintegrate into couples; universal is the protecting arm. Relief\nfrom the sweltering atmosphere of the hours of sunshine causes a\nrevival of hilarity; those who have hitherto only bemused themselves\nwith liquor now pass into the stage of jovial recklessness, and others,\ndetermined to prolong a flagging merriment, begin to depend upon their\ncompanions for guidance. On the terraces dancing has commenced; the\nplayers of violins, concertinas, and penny-whistles do a brisk trade\namong the groups eager for a rough-and-tumble valse; so do the\npickpockets. Vigorous and varied is the jollity that occupies the\nexternal galleries, filling now in expectation of the fireworks;\nindescribable the mingled tumult that roars heavenwards. Girls linked\nby the half-dozen arm-in-arm leap along with shrieks like grotesque\nmaenads; a rougher horseplay finds favour among the youths,\noccasionally leading to fisticuffs. Thick voices bellow in fragmentary\nchorus; from every side comes the yell, the eat-call, the ear-rending\nwhistle; and as the bass, the never-ceasing accompaniment, sounds\nmyriad-footed tramp, tramp along the wooden flooring. A fight, a scene\nof bestial drunkenness, a tender whispering between two lovers, proceed\nconcurrently in a space of five square yards.--Above them glimmers the\ndawn of starlight.\n\nFor perhaps the first time in his life Bob Hewett has drunk more than\nhe can well carry. To Pennyloaf's remonstrances he answers more and\nmore impatiently: 'Why does she talk like a bloomin' fool?--one doesn't\nget married every day.' He is on the look-out for Jack Bartley now;\nonly let him meet Jack, and it shall be seen who is the better man.\nPennyloaf rejoices that the hostile party are nowhere discoverable. She\nis persuaded to join in a dance, though every moment it seems to her\nthat she must sink to the ground in uttermost exhaustion. Naturally she\ndoes not dance with sufficient liveliness to please Bob; he seizes\nanother girl, a stranger, and whirls round the six-foot circle with a\nlaugh of triumph. Pennyloaf's misery is relieved by the beginning of\nthe fireworks. Up shoot the rockets, and all the reeking multitude\nutters a huge 'Oh' of idiot admiration.\n\nNow at length must we think of tearing ourselves away from these\ndelights. Already the more prudent people are hurrying to the railway,\nknowing by dire experience what it means to linger until the last\ncargoes. Pennyloaf has hard work to get her husband as far as the\nstation; Bob is not quite steady upon his feet, and the hustling of the\ncrowd perpetually excites him to bellicose challenges. They reach the\nplatform somehow; they stand wedged amid a throng which roars\npersistently as a substitute for the activity of limb Row become\nimpossible. A train is drawing up slowly; the danger is lest people in\nthe front row should be pushed over the edge of the platform, but\nporters exert themselves with success. A rush, a tumble, curses, blows,\nlaughter, screams of pain--and we are in a carriage. Pennyloaf has to\nbe dragged up from under the seat, and all her indignation cannot free\nher from the jovial embrace of a man who insists that there is plenty\nof room on his knee. Off we go! It is a long third-class coach, and\nalready five or six musical instruments have struck up. We smoke and\nsing at the same time; we quarrel and make love--the latter in somewhat\nprimitive fashion; we roll about with the rolling of the train; we nod\ninto hoggish sleep.\n\nThe platform at Holborn Viaduct; and there, to Pennyloaf's terror, it\nis seen that Clem Peckover and her satellites have come by the same\ntrain. She does her best to get Bob quickly away, but Clem keeps close\nin their neighbourhood. Just as they issue from the station Pennyloaf\nfeels herself bespattered from head to foot with some kind of fluid;\nturning, she is aware that all her enemies have squirts in their hands,\nand are preparing for a second discharge of filthy water. Anguish for\nthe ruin of her dress overcomes all other fear; she calls upon Bob to\ndefend her.\n\nBut an immediate conflict was not Jack Bartley's intention. He and\nthose with him made off at a run, Bob pursuing as closely as his\nunsteadiness would permit. In this way they all traversed the short\ndistance to Clerkenwell Green, either party echoing the other's\nobjurgations along the thinly-peopled streets. At length arrived the\nsuitable moment. Near St. James's Church Jack Bartley made a stand, and\ndefied his enemy to come on. Bob responded with furious eagerness; amid\na press of delighted spectators, swelled by people just turned out of\nthe public-houses, the two lads fought like wild animals. Nor were they\nthe only combatants. Exasperated by the certainty that her hat and\ndolman were ruined, Pennyloaf flew with erected nails at Clem Peckover.\nIt was just what the latter desired. In an instant she had rent half\nPennyloaf's garments off her back, and was tearing her face till the\nblood streamed. Inconsolable was the grief of the crowd when a couple\nof stalwart policemen came hustling forward, thrusting to left and\nright, irresistibly clearing the corner. There was no question of\nmaking arrests; it was the night of Bank-holiday, and the capacity of\npolice-cells is limited. Enough that the fight perforce came to an end.\nAmid frenzied blasphemy Bob and Jack went their several ways; so did\nClem and Pennyloaf.\n\nPoor Pennyloaf! Arrived at Shooter's Gardens, and having groped her way\nblindly up to the black hole which was her wedding-chamber, she just\nmanaged to light a candle, then sank down upon the bare floor and wept.\nYou could not have recognised her; her pretty face was all blood and\ndirt. She held in her hand the fragment of a hat, and her dolman had\ndisappeared. Her husband was not in much better plight; his waistcoat\nand shirt were rent open, his coat was filth-smeared, and it seemed\nlikely that he had lost the sight of one eye. Sitting there in drunken\nlassitude, he breathed nothing but threats of future vengeance.\n\nAn hour later noises of a familiar kind sounded beneath the window. A\nwoman's voice was raised in the fury of mad drunkenness, and a man\nanswered her with threats and blows.\n\n'That's mother,' sobbed Pennyloaf. 'I knew she wouldn't get over\nto-day. She never did get over a Bank-holiday.'\n\nMrs. Candy had taken the pledge when her husband consented to return\nand live with her. Unfortunately she did not at the same time transfer\nherself to a country where there are no beer-shops and no\nBank-holidays. Short of such decisive change, what hope for her?\n\nBob was already asleep, breathing stertorously. As for Pennyloaf, she\nwas so overwearied that hours passed before oblivion fell upon her\naching eyelids. She was thinking all the time that on the morrow it\nwould be necessary to pawn her wedding-ring.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTHE BRINGER OF ILL NEWS\n\nKnowing the likelihood that Clara Hewett would go from home for\nBank-holiday, Sidney made it his request before he left Hanover Street\non Sunday night that Jane might be despatched on her errand at an early\nhour next morning. At eight o'clock, accordingly, Snowdon went forth\nwith his granddaughter, and, having discovered the street to which\nSidney had directed him, he waited at a distance whilst Jane went to\nmake her inquiries. In a few minutes the girl rejoined him.\n\n'Miss Hewett has gone away,' she reported.\n\n'To spend the day, do you mean?' was Snowdon's troubled question.\n\n'No, she has left the house. She went yesterday, in the afternoon. It\nwas very sudden, the landlady says, and she doesn't know where she's\ngone to.'\n\nJane had no understanding of what her information implied; seeing that\nit was received as grave news, she stood regarding her grandfather\nanxiously. Though Clara had passed out of her world since those first\ndays of illness, Jane held her in a memory which knew no motive of\nretention so strong as gratitude. The thought of harm or sorrow coming\nupon her protector had a twofold painfulness. Instantly she divined\nthat Clara was in some way the cause of Sidney Kirkwood's inability to\ngo into the country to-day. For a long time the two had been closely\nlinked in her reflections; Mrs. Peckover and Clem used constantly to\nexchange remarks which made this inevitable. But not until now had Jane\nreally felt the significance of the bond. Of a sudden she had a\nthrobbing at her heart, and a confusion of mind which would not allow\nher to pursue the direct train of thought naturally provoked by the\nvisit she had just paid. A turbid flood of ideas, of vague surmises, of\napprehensions, of forecasts, swept across her consciousness. The blood\nforsook her cheeks. But that the old man began to move away, she could\nhave remained thus for many minutes, struggling with that new,\nhalf-understood thing which was taking possession of her life.\n\nThe disappointment of the day was no longer simple, and such as a child\nexperiences. Nor ever from this hour onwards would Jane regard things\nas she had been wont to do, with the simple feelings of childhood.\n\nSnowdon walked on in silence until the street they had visited was far\nbehind them. Jane was accustomed to his long fits of musing, but now\nshe with difficulty refrained from questioning him. He said at length:\n\n'Jane, I'm afraid we shall have to give up our day in the country.'\n\nShe assented readily, gladly; all the joy had gone out of the proposed\nexcursion, and she wished Dow to be by herself in quietness.\n\n'I think I'll let you go home alone,' Snowdon continued. 'I want to see\nMr. Kirkwood, and I dare say I shall find him in, if I walk on at once.'\n\nThey went in different directions, and Snowdon made what speed he could\nto Tysoe Street. Sidney had already been out, walking restlessly and\naimlessly for two or three hours. The news he now heard was the\nhalf-incredible fulfilment of a dread that had been torturing him\nthrough the night. No calamity is so difficult to realise when it\nbefalls as one which has haunted us in imagination.\n\n'That means nothing!' he exclaimed, as if resentfully. 'She was\ndissatisfied with the lodging, that's all. Perhaps she's already got a\nplace. I dare say there's a note from her at home this morning.'\n\n'Shall you go and see if there is?' asked Snowdon, allowing, as usual,\na moment's silence to intervene.\n\nSidney hesitated, avoiding the other's look.\n\n'I shall go to that house first of all, I think. Of course I shall hear\nno more than they told Jane; but--'\n\nHe took a deep breath.\n\n'Yes, go there,' said Snowdon; 'but afterwards go to the Hewetts'. If\nshe _hasn't_ written to them, or let them have news of any kind, her\nfather oughtn't to be kept in ignorance for another hour.'\n\n'He ought to have been told before this,' replied Sidney ill a thick\nunder-voice. 'He ought to have been told on Saturday. And the blame'll\nbe mine.'\n\nIt is an experience familiar to impulsive and self-confident men that a\nmoment's crisis may render scarcely intelligible a mode of thought or\ncourse of action which till then one had deemed perfectly rational.\nSidney, hopeless in spite of the pretences he made, stood aghast at the\nresponsibility he had taken upon himself. It was so obvious to him now\nthat he ought to have communicated to John Hewett without loss of time\nthe news which Mrs. Hewett brought on Saturday morning. But could he be\nsure that John was still in ignorance of Clara's movements? Was it not\nall but certain that Mrs. Hewett must have broken the news before this?\nIf not, there lay before him a terrible duty.\n\nThe two went forth together, and another visit was paid to the\nlodging-house. After that Sidney called upon Mrs. Tubbs, and made a\nsimple inquiry for Clara, with the anticipated result.\n\n'You won't find her in this part of London, it's my belief,' said the\nwoman significantly. 'She's left the lodgings as she took--so much I\nknow. Never meant to stay there, not she! You're a friend of her\nfather's, mister?'\n\nSidney could not trust himself to make a reply. He rejoined Snowdon at\na little distance, and expressed his intention of going at once to\nClerkenwell Close.\n\n'Let me see you again to-day,' said the old man sadly.\n\nSidney promised, and they took leave of each other. It was now nearing\nten o'clock. In the Close an organ was giving delight to a great crowd\nof children, some of them wearing holiday garb, but most clad in the\nnative rags which served them for all seasons and all days. The volume\nof clanging melody fell with torture upon Kirkwood's ear, and when he\nsaw that the instrument was immediately before Mrs. Peckover's house,\nhe stood aside in gloomy impatience, waiting till it should move away.\nThis happened in a few minutes. The house door being open, he walked\nstraight upstairs.\n\nOn the landing he confronted Mrs. Hewett; she started on seeing him,\nand whispered a question. The exchange of a few words apprised Sidney\nthat Hewett did not even know of Clara's having quitted Mrs. Tubbs'.\n\n'Then I must tell him everything,' he said. To put the task upon the\npoor woman would have been simple cowardice. Merely in hearing his news\nshe was blanched with dread. She could only point to the door of the\nfront room--the only one rented by the family since Jane Snowdon's\noccupation of the other had taught them to be as economical in this\nrespect as their neighbours were.\n\nSidney knocked and entered. Two months had passed since his latest\nvisit, and he observed that in the meantime everything had become more\nsqualid. The floor, the window, the furniture, were not kept so clean\nas formerly--inevitable result of the overcrowding of a room; the air\nwas bad, the children looked untidy. The large bed had not been set in\norder since last night; in it lay the baby, crying as always, ailing as\nit had done from the day of its birth. John Hewett was engaged in\nmending one of the chairs, of which the legs had become loose. He\nlooked with surprise at the visitor, and at once averted his face\nsullenly.\n\n'Mr. Hewett,' Kirkwood began, without form of greeting, 'on Saturday\nmorning I heard something that I believe I ought to have let you know\nat once. I felt, though, that it was hardly my business; and somehow we\nhaven't been quite so open with each other just lately as we used to\nbe.'\n\nHis voice sank. Hewett had risen from his crouching attitude, and was\nlooking him full in the face with eyes which grew momentarily darker\nand more hostile.\n\n'Well? Why are you stopping? What have you got to say?'\n\nThe words came from a dry throat; the effort to pronounce them clearly\nmade the last all but violent.\n\n'On Friday night,' Sidney resumed, his own utterance uncertain, 'Clara\nleft her place. She took a room not far from Upper Street, and I saw\nher, spoke to her. She'd quarrelled with Mrs. Tubbs. I urged her to\ncome home, but she wouldn't listen to me. This morning I've been to try\nand see her again, but they tell me she went away yesterday afternoon.\nI can't find where she's living now.'\n\nHewett took a step forward. His face was so distorted, so fierce, that\nSidney involuntarily raised an arm, as if to defend himself.\n\n'An' it's you as comes tellin' me this!' John exclaimed, a note of\nanguish blending with his fury. 'You have the face to stand there an'\nspeak like that to me, when you know it's all your own doing! Who was\nthe cause as the girl went away from 'ome? Who was it, I say? Haven't\nbeen as friendly as we used to be, haven't we? An' why? Haven't I seen\nit plainer an' plainer what you was thinkin' when you told me to let\nher have her own way? I spoke the truth then--'cause I felt it; an' I\nwas fool enough, for all that, to try an' believe I was in the wrong.\nNow you come an' stand before me--why, I couldn't a' thought there was\na man had so little shame in him!'\n\nMrs. Hewett entered the room; the loud angry voice had reached her\nears, and in spite of terror she came to interpose between the two men.\n\n'Do you know what he's come to tell me?' cried her husband. 'Oh, you\ndo! He's been tryin' to talk you over, has he? You just answer to me,\nan' tell the truth. Who was it persuaded me to let Clara go from 'ome?\nWho was it come here an' talked an' talked till he got his way? He knew\nwhat 'ud be the end of it--he knew, I tell you,--an' it's just what he\nwanted. Hasn't he been drawin' away from us ever since the girl left? I\nsaw it all that night when he came here persuadin' me, an' I told it\nhim plain. He wanted to 'a done with her, and to a' done with us. Am I\nspeakin' the truth or not?'\n\n'Why should he think that way, John?' pleaded the woman faintly. 'You\nknow very well as Clara 'ud never listen to him. What need had he to do\nsuch things?'\n\n'Oh yes, I'm wrong! Of course I'm wrong! You always did go against me\nwhen there was anything to do with Clara. She'd never listen to him?\nNo, of course she wouldn't, an' he couldn't rest until he saw her come\nto harm. What do _you_ care either? She's no child of yours. But I tell\nyou I'd see you an' all your children beg an' die in the streets rather\nthan a hair of my own girl's head should be touched!'\n\nIndulgence of his passion was making a madman of him. Never till now\nhad he uttered an unfeeling word to his wife, but the look with which\nlie accompanied this brutal speech was one of fiery hatred.\n\n'Don't turn on _her_!' cried Sidney, with bitterness. 'Say what you\nlike to me, and believe the worst you can of me; I shouldn't have come\nhere if I hadn't been ready to bear everything. It's no good speaking\nreason to you now, but maybe you'll understand some day.'\n\n'Who know's as she's come to harm?' urged Mrs. Hewett. 'Nobody can say\nit of her for certain, yet.'\n\n'I'd have told him that, if he'd only listened to me and given me\ncredit for honesty,' said Kirkwood. 'It is as likely as not she's gone\naway just because I angered her on Saturday. Perhaps she said to\nherself she'd have done with me once for all. It would be just her way.'\n\n'Speak another word against my girl,' Hewett shouted, misinterpreting\nthe last phrase, 'an' I'll do more than say what I think of you--old\nman though they call me! Take yourself out of this room; it was the\nworst day of my life that ever you came into it. Never let me an' you\ncome across each other again. I hate the sight of you, an' I hate the\nsound of your voice!'\n\nThe animal in Sidney Kirkwood made it a terrible minute for him as he\nturned away in silence before this savage injustice. The veins upon his\nforehead were swollen; his clenched teeth gave an appearance of\nferocity to his spirited features. With head bent, and shoulders\nquivering as if in supreme muscular exertion, he left the room without\nanother word.\n\nIn a few minutes Hewett also quitted the house. He went to the\nluncheon-bar in Upper Street, and heard for the first time Mrs. Tubbs's\nrancorous surmises. He went to Clara's recent lodgings; a girl of ten\nwas the only person in the house, and she could say nothing more than\nthat Miss Hewett no longer lived there. Till midway in the afternoon\nJohn walked about the streets of Islington, Highbury, Hoxton,\nClerkenwell, impelled by the unreasoning hope that he might see Clara,\nbut also because he could not rest in any place. He was half-conscious\nnow of the madness of his behaviour to Kirkwood, but this only\nconfirmed him in hostility to the young man; the thought of losing\nClara was anguish intolerable, yet with it mingled a bitter resentment\nof the girl's cruelty to him. And all these sources of misery swelled\nthe current of rebellious feeling which had so often threatened to\nsweep his life into wreckage. He was Clara's father, and the same\nimpulse of furious revolt which had driven the girl to recklessness now\ninflamed him with the rage of despair.\n\nOn a Bank-holiday only a few insignificant shops remain open even in\nthe poor districts of London; sweets you can purchase, and tobacco, but\nnot much else that is sold across an ordinary counter. The more\nnoticeable becomes the brisk trade of public-houses. At the gin-shop\ncentres the life of each street; here is a wide door and a noisy\nwelcome, the more attractive by contrast with the stretch of closed\nshutters on either hand. At such a door, midway in the sultry\nafternoon, John Hewett paused. To look at his stooping shoulders, his\nuncertain swaying this way and that, his flushed, perspiring face, you\nmight have taken him for one who had already been drinking. No; it was\nonly a struggle between his despairing wretchedness and a lifelong\nhabit of mind. Not difficult to foresee which would prevail; the\npublic-house always has its doors open in expectation of such\ninstances. With a gesture which made him yet more like a drunken man he\nturned from the pavement and entered. . . .\n\nAbout nine o'clock in the evening, just when Mrs. Hewett had put the\nunwilling children to bed, and had given her baby a sleeping-dose--it\nhad cried incessantly for eighteen hours,--the door of the room was\npushed open. Her husband came in. She stood looking at him--unable to\ncredit the evidence of her eyes.\n\n'John!'\n\nShe laid her hand upon him and stared into his face. The man shook her\noff, without speaking, and moved staggeringly forward. Then he turned\nround, waved his arm, and shouted:\n\n'Let her go to the devil. She cares nothing for her father.'\n\nHe threw himself upon the bed, and soon sank into drunken sleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nA WELCOME GUEST\n\nThe bells of St. James's, Clerkenwell, ring melodies in intervals of\nthe pealing for service-time. One morning of spring their music, like\nthe rain that fell intermittently, was flung westwards by the\nboisterous wind, away over Clerkenwell Close, until the notes failed\none by one, or were clashed out of existence by the clamour of a less\ncivilised steeple. Had the wind been under mortal control it would\ndoubtless have blown thus violently and in this quarter in order that\nthe inhabitants of the House of Detention might derive no solace from\nthe melody. Yet I know not; just now the bells were playing 'There is a\nhappy land, far, far away,' and that hymn makes too great a demand upon\nthe imagination to soothe amid instant miseries.\n\nIn Mrs. Peckover's kitchen the music was audible in bursts. Clem and\nher mother, however, it neither summoned to prepare for church, nor\nlulled into a mood of restful reverie. The two were sitting very close\ntogether before the fire, and holding intimate converse; their voices\nkept a low murmur, as if; though the door was shut, they felt it\nnecessary to use every precaution against being overheard. Three years\nhave come and gone since we saw these persons. On the elder time has\nmade little impression; but Clem has developed noticeably. The girl is\nnow in the very prime of her ferocious beauty. She has grown taller and\nsomewhat stouter; her shoulders spread like those of a caryatid; the\narm with which she props her head is as strong as a carter's and\nmagnificently moulded. The head itself looks immense with its pile of\nglossy hair. Reddened by the rays of the fire, her features had a\nsplendid savagery which seemed strangely at discord with the paltry\nsurroundings amid which she sat; her eyes just now were gleaming with a\ncrafty and cruel speculation which would have become those of a\nbarbarian in ambush. I wonder how it came about that her strain, after\npassing through the basest conditions of modern life, had thus reverted\nto a type of ancestral exuberance.\n\n'If only he doesn't hear about the old man or the girl from somebody!'\nsaid Mrs. Peckover. 'I've been afraid of it ever since he come into the\n'ouse. There's so many people might tell him. You'll have to come round\nhim sharp, Clem.'\n\nThe mother was dressed as her kind are wont to be on Sunday\nmorning--that is to say, not dressed at all, but hung about with coarse\ngarments, her hair in unbeautiful disarray. Clem, on the other hand,\nseemed to have devoted much attention to her morning toilet; she wore a\ndark dress trimmed with velveteen, and a metal ornament of primitive\ntaste gleamed amid her hair.\n\n'There ain't no mistake?' she asked, after a pause. 'You're jolly sure\nof that?'\n\n'Mistake? What a blessed fool you must be! Didn't they advertise in the\npapers for him? Didn't the lawyers themselves say as it was something\nto his advantage? Don't you say yourself as Jane says her grandfather's\noften spoke about him and wished he could find him? How can it be a\nmistake? If it was only Bill's letter we had to go on, you might talk;\nbut--there, don't be a ijiot!'\n\n'If it turned out as he hadn't nothing,' remarked Clem resolutely, 'I'd\nleave him, if I was married fifty times.'\n\nHer mother uttered a contemptuous sound. At the same time she moved her\nhead as if listening; some one was, in fact, descending the stairs.\n\n'Here he comes,' she whispered. 'Get the eggs ready, an' I'll make the\ncorffee.'\n\nA tap at the door, then entered a tallish man of perhaps forty, though\nhe might be a year or two younger. His face was clean-shaven,\nharsh-featured, unwholesome of complexion; its chief peculiarity was\nthe protuberance of the bone in front of each temple, which gave him a\ncuriously animal aspect. His lower lip hung and jutted forward; when he\nsmiled, as now in advancing to the fire, it slightly overlapped the one\nabove. His hair was very sparse; he looked, indeed, like one who has\nreceived the tonsure. The movement of his limbs betokened excessive\nindolence; he dragged his feet rather than walked. His attire was\nequally suggestive; not only had it fallen into the last degree of\nshabbiness (having originally been such as is worn by a man above the\nmechanic ranks), but it was patched with dirt of many kinds, and held\ntogether by a most inadequate supply of buttons. At present he wore no\ncollar, and his waistcoat, half-open, exposed a red shirt.\n\n'Why, you're all a-blowin' and a-growin' this morning, Peckover,' was\nhis first observation, as he dropped heavily into a wooden arm-chair.\n'I shall begin to think that colour of yours ain't natural. Dare you\nlet me rub it with a handkerchief?'\n\n'Course I dare,' replied Clem, tossing her head. 'Don't be so forward,\nMr. Snowdon.'\n\n'Forward? Not I. I'm behind time if anything. I hope I haven't kept you\nfrom church.'\n\nHe chuckled at his double joke. Mother and daughter laughed\nappreciatively.\n\n'Will you take your eggs boiled or fried?' inquired Mrs. Peckover.\n\n'Going to give me eggs, are you? Well, I've no objection, I assure you.\nAnd I think I'll have them fried, Mrs. Peckover. But, I say, you\nmustn't be running up too big a bill. The Lord only knows when I shall\nget anything to do, and it ain't very likely to be a thousand a year\nwhen it does come.'\n\n'Oh, that's all right,' replied the landlady, as if sordid calculation\nwere a thing impossible to her. 'I can't say as you behaved quite\nstraightforward years ago, Mr. Snowdon, but I ain't one to make a row\nabout bygones, an' as you say you'll put it all straight as soon as you\ncan, well, I won't refuse to trust you once more.'\n\nMr. Snowdon lay back in the chair, his hands in his waistcoat pockets,\nhis legs outstretched upon the fender. He was smiling placidly, now at\nthe preparing breakfast, now at Clem. The latter he plainly regarded\nwith much admiration, and cared not to conceal it. When, in a few\nminutes, it was announced to him that the meal was ready, he dragged\nhis chair up to the table and reseated himself with a sigh of\nsatisfaction. A dish of excellent ham, and eggs as nearly fresh as can\nbe obtained in Clerkenwell, invited him with appetising odour; a large\ncup of what is known to the generality of English people as coffee\nsteamed at his right hand; slices of new bread lay ready cut upon a\nplate; a slab of the most expensive substitute for butter caught his\neye with yellow promise; vinegar and mustard appealed to the\nrefinements of his taste.\n\n'I've got a couple more eggs, if you'd like them doin',' said Mrs.\nPeckover, when she had watched the beginning of his attack upon the\nviands.\n\n'I think I shall manage pretty well with this supply,' returned Mr.\nSnowdon.\n\nAs he ate he kept silence, partly because it was his habit, partly in\nconsequence of the activity of his mind. He was, in fact, musing upon a\nquestion which he found it very difficult to answer in any satisfactory\nway. 'What's the meaning of all this?' he asked himself, and not for\nthe first time. 'What makes them treat me in this fashion? A week ago I\ncame here to look up Mrs. Peckover, just because I'd run down to my\nlast penny, and I didn't know where to find a night's lodging. I'd got\nan idea, too, that I should like to find out what had become of my\nchild, whom I left here nine or ten years ago; possibly she was still\nalive, and might welcome the duty of supporting her parent. The chance\nwas, to be sure, that the girl had long since been in her grave, and\nthat Mrs. Peckover no longer lived in the old quarters; if I discovered\nthe woman, on the other hand, she was not very likely to give me an\naffectionate reception, seeing that I found it inconvenient to keep\nsending her money for Jane's keep in the old days. The queer thing is,\nthat everything turned out exactly the opposite of what I had expected.\nMrs. Peckover had rather a sour face at first, but after a little talk\nshe began to seem quite glad to see me. She put me into a room,\nundertook to board me for a while--till I find work, and I wonder when\n_that_'ll be?--and blest if this strapping daughter of hers doesn't\nseem to have fallen in love with me from the first go off! As for my\ngirl, I'm told she was carried off by her grandfather, my old dad,\nthree years ago, and where they went nobody knows. Very puzzling all\nthis. How on earth came it that Mrs. Peckover kept the child so long,\nand didn't send her to the workhouse? If I'm to believe _her_, she took\na motherly kindness for the poor brat. But that won't exactly go down\nwith J. J. Snowdon; he's seen a bit too much in his knocking about the\nworld, Still, what if I'm making a mistake about the old woman? There\n_are_ some people do things of that sort; upon my soul, I've known\npeople be kind even to me, without a chance of being paid back! You may\nthink you know a man or a woman, and then all at once they'll go and do\nsomething you'd have taken your davy couldn't possibly happen. I'd have\nsworn she was nothing but a skinflint and a lying old witch. And so she\nmaybe; the chances are there's some game going on that I can't see\nthrough. Make inquiries? Why, so I have done, as far as I know how.\nI've only been able to hit on one person who knows anything about the\nmatter, and he tells me it's true enough the girl was taken away about\nthree years ago, but he's no idea where she went to. Surely the old man\nmust be dead b now, though he _was_ tough. Well, the fact of the matter\nis, I've got a good berth, and I'm a precious sight too lazy to go on\nthe private detective job. Here's this girl Clem, the finest bit of\nflesh I've seen for a long time; I've more than half a mind to see if\nshe won't be fool enough to marry me. I'm not a bad-looking fellow,\nthat's the truth, and she may have taken a real liking to me. Seems to\nme that I should have come in for a Comfortable thing in my old age; if\nI haven't a daughter to provide for my needs, at all events I shall\nhave a wife who can be persuaded into doing so. When the old woman gets\nout of the way I must have a little quiet talk with Clem.'\n\nThe opportunity he desired was not long in offering itself. Having made\nan excellent breakfast, he dragged his chair up to the fender again,\nand reached a pipe from the mantel-piece, where he had left it last\nnight. Tobacco he carried loose in his waistcoat pocket; it came forth\nin the form of yellowish dust, intermingled with all sorts of alien\nscraps. When he had lit his pipe, he poised the chair on its hind-legs,\nclasped his hands over his bald crown, and continued his musing with an\nair of amiable calm. Smoke curled up from the corner of his loose lips,\nand occasionally, removing his pipe for an instant, he spat skilfully\nbetween the bars of the grate. Assured of his comfort, Mrs. Peckover\nsaid she must go and look after certain domestic duties. Her daughter\nhad begun to clean some vegetables that would be cooked for dinner.\n\n'How old may you be, Clem?' Mr. Snowdon inquired genially, when they\nhad been alone together for a few minutes.\n\n'What's that to you? Guess.'\n\n'Why, let me see; you was not much more than a baby when I went away.\nYou'll be eighteen or nineteen, I suppose.'\n\n'Yes, I'm nineteen--last sixth of February. Pity you come too late to\ngive me a birthday present, ain't it?'\n\n'Ah! And who'd have thought you'd have grown up such a beauty! I say,\nClem, how many of the young chaps about here have been wanting to marry\nyou, eh?'\n\n'A dozen or two, I dessay,' Clem replied, shrugging her shoulders\nscornfully.\n\nMr. Snowdon laughed, and then spat into the fire.\n\n'Tell me about some o' them, will you? Who is it you're keeping company\nwith now?'\n\n'Who, indeed? Why, there isn't one I'd look at! Several of 'em's took\nto drinking 'cause I won't have nothing to do with 'em.'\n\nThis excited Mr. Snowdon's mirth in a high degree; he rolled on his\nchair, and almost pitched backwards.\n\n'I suppose you give one or other a bit of encouragement now and then,\njust to make a fool of him, eh?'\n\n'Course I do. There was Bob Hewett; he used to lodge here, but that was\nafter your time. I kep' him off an' on till he couldn't bear it no\nlonger; then he went an' married a common slut of a thing, just because\nhe thought it 'ud make me mad. Ha, ha! I believe he'd give her poison\nan' risk it any day, if only I promised to marry him afterwards. Then\nthere was a feller called Jeck Bartley. I set him an' Bob fightin' one\nBank-holiday--you should a' seen 'em go at it! Jack went an' got\nmarried a year ago to a girl called Suke Jollop; her mother forced him.\nHow I did laugh! Last Christmas Day they smashed up their 'ome an'\nthrew the bits out into the street. Jack got one of his eyes knocked\nout--I thought I should a' died o' laughin' when I saw him next\nmornin'.'\n\nThe hearer became uproarious in merriment.\n\n'Tell you what it is, Clem,' he cried, 'you're something like a girl!\nDarn me if I don't like you! I say, I wonder what my daughter's grown\nup? Like her mother, I suppose. You an' she was sort of sisters, wasn't\nyou?'\n\nHe observed her closely. Clem laughed and shrugged her shoulders.\n\n'Queer sort o' sisters. She was a bit too quiet-like for me. There\nnever was no fun in her.'\n\n'Aye, like her mother. And where did you say she went to with the old\nman?'\n\n'Where she went to?' repeated Clem, regarding him steadily with her big\neyes, 'I never said nothing about it, 'cause I didn't know.'\n\n'Well, I shan't cry about her, and I don't suppose she misses me much,\nwherever she is. All the same, Clem, I'm a domesticated sort of man;\nyou can see that, can't you? I shouldn't wonder if I marry again one of\nthese first days. Just tell me where to find a girl of the right sort.\nI dare say you know heaps.'\n\n'Dessay I do. What sort do you want?'\n\n'Oh, a littlish girl--yellow hair, you know--one of them that look as\nif they didn't weigh half-a-stone.'\n\n'I'll throw this parsnip at you, Mr. Snowdon!'\n\n'What's up now. You don't Call yourself littlish, do you?'\n\nClem snapped the small end off the vegetable she was paring, and aimed\nit at his head. He ducked just in time. Then there was an outburst of\nlaughter from both.\n\n'Say, Clem, you haven't got a glass of beer in the house?'\n\n'You'll have to wait till openin' time,' replied the girl sourly, going\naway to the far end of the room.\n\n'Have I offended you, Clem?'\n\n'Offended, indeed. As if I cared what you say!'\n\n'Do you care what I think?'\n\n'Not I!'\n\n'That means you do. Say, Clem, just come here; I've something to tell\nyou.'\n\n'You're a nuisance. Let me get on with my work, can't you?'\n\n'No, I can't. You just come here. You'd better not give me the trouble\nof fetching you!'\n\nThe girl obeyed him. Her cheeks were very hot, and the danger-signal\nwas flashing in her eyes. Ten minutes later she went upstairs, and had\na vivacious dialogue of whispers with Mrs. Peckover.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nSUNLIGHT IN DREARY PLACES\n\nAmong the by-ways of Clerkenwell you might, with some difficulty, have\ndiscovered an establishment known in its neighbourhood as\n'Whitehead's.' It was an artificial-flower factory, and the rooms of\nwhich it consisted were only to be reached by traversing a timber-yard,\nand then mounting a wooden staircase outside a saw-mill. Here at busy\nseasons worked some threescore women and girls, who, owing to the\nnature of their occupation, were spoken of by the jocose youth of the\nlocality as 'Whitehead's pastepots.'\n\nNaturally they varied much in age and aspect. There was the child who\nhad newly left school, and was now invited to consider the question of\nhow to keep herself alive; there was the woman of uncertain age, who\nhad spent long years of long days in the atmosphere of workrooms, and\nshowed the result in her parchmenty cheek and lack-lustre eye; and\nbetween these extremes came all the various types of the London\ncrafts-girl: she who is young enough to hope that disappointments may\nyet be made up for by the future; she who is already tasting such\nscanty good as life had in store for her; she who has outlived her\nillusions and no longer cares to look beyond the close of the week. If\nregularly engaged as time-workers, they made themselves easy in the\nprospect of wages that allowed them to sleep under a roof and eat at\ncertain intervals of the day; if employed on piece-work they might at\nany moment find themselves wageless, but this, being a familiar state\nof things, did not trouble them. With few exceptions, they were clad\nneatly; on the whole, they plied their task in wonderful contentment.\nThe general tone of conversation among them was not high; moralists\nunfamiliar with the ways of the nether world would probably have\napplied a term other than negative to the laughing discussions which\nnow and then enlivened this or that group; but it was very seldom\nindeed that a child newly arriving heard anything with which she was\nnot already perfectly familiar.\n\nOne afternoon at the end of May there penetrated into the largest of\nthe workrooms that rarest of visitants, a stray sunbeam. Only if the\nsun happened to shine at given moments could any of its light fall\ndirectly into the room I speak of; this afternoon, however, all\ncircumstances were favourable, and behold the floor chequered with\nuncertain gleam. The workers were arranged in groups of three, called\n'parties,' consisting of a learner, an improver, and a hand. All sat\nwith sleeves pushed up to their elbows, and had a habit of rocking to\nand fro as they plied their mechanical industry. Owing to the movement\nof a cloud, the sunlight spread gradually towards one of these groups;\nit touched the skirt, the arms, the head of one of the girls, who, as\nif gladdened by the kindly warmth, looked round and smiled. A smile you\nwould have been pleased to observe--unconscious, gently thoughtful,\nrich in possibilities of happiness. She was quite a young girl,\ncertainly not seventeen, and wore a smooth grey dress, with a white\nlinen collar; her brown hair was closely plaited, her head well-shaped,\nthe bend of her neck very graceful. From her bare arms it could be seen\nthat she was anything but robustly made, yet her general appearance was\nnot one of ill-health, and she held herself, even thus late in the day,\nfar more uprightly than most of her companions. Had you watched her for\na while, you would have noticed that her eyes occasionally strayed\nbeyond the work-table, and, perhaps unconsciously, fixed themselves for\nsome moments on one or other of the girls near her; when she remembered\nherself and looked down again upon her task, there rose to her face a\nsmile of the subtlest meaning, the outcome of busy reflection.\n\nBy her side was a little girl just beginning to learn the work, whose\nemployment it was to paper wires and make 'centres.' This toil always\nresults in blistered fingers, and frequent was the child's appeal to\nher neighbour for sympathy.\n\n'It'll be easier soon,' said the latter, on one of these occasions,\nbending her head to speak in a low voice. 'You should have seen what\nblisters I had when I began.'\n\n'It's all very well to say that. I can't do no more, so there Oh,\nwhen'll it be five o'clock?'\n\n'It's a quarter to. Try and go on, Annie.'\n\nFive o'clock did come at length, and with it twenty minutes' rest for\ntea. The rule at Whitehead's was, that you could either bring your own\ntea, sugar, and eatables, or purchase them here from a forewoman; most\nof the workers chose to provide themselves. It was customary for each\n'party' to club together, emptying their several contributions of tea\nout of little twists of newspaper into one teapot. Wholesome bustle and\nconfusion succeeded to the former silence. One of the learners, whose\nturn it was to run on errands, was overwhelmed with commissions to a\nchandler's shop close by; a wry-faced, stupid little girl she was, and\nthey called her, because of her slowness, the 'funeral horse.' She had\nstrange habits, which made laughter for those who knew of them; for\ninstance, it was her custom in the dinner-hour to go apart and eat her\npoor scraps on a doorstep close by a cook-shop; she confided to a\ncompanion that the odour of baked joints seemed to give her food a\nrelish. From her present errand she returned with a strange variety of\ndainties--for it was early in the week, and the girls still had coppers\nin their pockets; for two or three she had purchased a farthing's-worth\nof jam, which she carried in paper. A bite of this and a taste of that\nrewarded her for her trouble.\n\nThe quiet-mannered girl whom we were observing took her cup of tea from\nthe pot in which she had a share, and from her bag produced some folded\npieces of bread and butter. She had begun her meal, when there came and\nsat down by her a young woman of very different appearance--our friend,\nMiss Peckover. They were old acquaintances; but when we first saw them\ntogether it would have been difficult to imagine that they would ever\nsit and converse as at present, apparently in all friendliness. Strange\nto say, it was Clem who, during the past three years, had been the\nactive one in seeking to obliterate disagreeable memories. The younger\ngirl had never repelled her, but was long in overcoming the dread\nexcited by Clem's proximity. Even now she never looked straight into\nMiss Peckover's face, as she did when speaking with others; there was\nreserve in her manner, reserve unmistakable, though clothed with her\npleasant smile and amiable voice.\n\n'I've got something to tell you, Jane,' Clem began, in a tone inaudible\nto those who were sitting near. 'Something as'll surprise you.'\n\n'What is it, I wonder?'\n\n'You must swear you won't tell nobody.'\n\nJane nodded. Then the other brought her head a little nearer, and\nwhispered:\n\n'I'm goin' to be married!'\n\n'Are you really?'\n\n'In a week. Who do you think it is? Somebody as you know of, but if you\nguessed till next Christmas you'd never come right.'\n\nNor had Clem any intention of revealing the name, but she laughed\nconsumedly, as if her reticence covered the most amusing situation\nconceivable.\n\n'It'll be the biggest surprise you ever had in your life. You've swore\nyou won't speak about it. I don't think I shall come to work after this\nweek--but you'll have to come an' see us. You'll promise to, won't you?'\n\nStill convulsed with mirth, Clem went off to another part of the room.\nFrom Jane's countenance the look of amusement which she had perforce\nsummoned soon passed; it was succeeded by a shadow almost of pain, and\nnot till she had been at work again for nearly an hour was the former\nplacidity restored to her.\n\nWhen final release came, Jane was among the first to hasten down the\nwooden staircase and get clear of the timber yard. By the direct way,\nit took her twenty minutes to walk from Whitehead's to her home in\nHanover Street, but this evening she had an object in turning aside.\nThe visit she wished to pay took her into a disagreeable quarter, a\nstreet of squalid houses, swarming with yet more squalid children. On\nall the doorsteps Bat little girls, themselves only just out of\ninfancy, nursing or neglecting bald, red-eyed, doughy-limbed abortions\nin every stage of babyhood, hapless spawn of diseased humanity, born to\nembitter and brutalise yet further the lot of those who unwillingly\ngave them life. With wide, pitiful eyes Jane looked at each group she\npassed. Three years ago she would have seen nothing but the ordinary\nand the inevitable in such spectacles, but since then her moral and\nintellectual being had grown on rare nourishment; there was indignation\nas well as heartache in the feeling with which she had learnt to regard\nthe world of her familiarity. To enter the house at which she paused it\nwas necessary to squeeze through a conglomerate of dirty little bodies.\nAt the head of the first flight of stairs she came upon a girl sitting\nin a weary attitude on the top step and beating the wood listlessly\nwith the last remnant of a hearth-brush; on her lap was one more\nspecimen of the infinitely-multiplied baby, and a child of two years\nsprawled behind her on the landing.\n\n'Waiting for him to come home, Pennyloaf?' said Jane.\n\n'Oh, is that you, Miss Snowdon!' exclaimed the other, returning to\nconsciousness and manifesting some shame at being discovered in this\nposition. Hastily she drew together the front of her dress, which for\nthe baby's sake had been wide open, and rose to her feet. Pennyloaf was\nnot a bit more womanly in figure than on the day of her marriage; her\nvoice was still an immature treble; the same rueful irresponsibility\nmarked her features; but all her poor prettiness was wasted under the\ndisfigurement of pains and cares, Incongruously enough, she wore a gown\nof bright-patterned calico, and about her neck had a collar of\npretentious lace; her hair was dressed as if for a holiday, and a daub\nrecently made on her cheeks by the baby's fingers lent emphasis to the\nfact that she had but a little while ago washed herself with much care.\n\n'I can't stop,' said Jane, 'but I thought I'd just look in and speak a\nword. How have you been getting on?'\n\n'Oh, do come in for just a minute!' pleaded Pennyloaf, moving backwards\nto an open door, whither Jane followed. They entered a room--much like\nother rooms that we have looked into from time to time. Following the\nnomadic custom of their kind, Bob Hewett and his wife had lived in six\nor seven different lodgings since their honeymoon in Shooter's Gardens.\nMrs. Candy first of all made a change necessary, as might have been\nanticipated, and the restlessness of domestic ill-being subsequently\ndrove them from place to place. 'Come in 'ere, Johnny,' she Called to\nthe child lying on the landing. 'What's the good o' washin' you, I'd\nlike to know? Just see, Miss Snowdon, he's made his face all white with\nthe milk as the boy spilt on the stairs! Take this brush an' play with\nit, do! I _can't_ keep 'em clean, Miss Snowdon, so it's no use talkin'.'\n\n'Are you going somewhere to-night?' Jane inquired, with a glance at the\nstrange costume.\n\nPennyloaf looked up and down in a shamefaced way.\n\n'I only did it just because I thought he might like to see me. He\npromised me faithful as he'd come 'ome to-night, and I thought--it's\nonly somethink as got into my 'ed to-day, Miss Snowdon.'\n\n'But hasn't he been coming home since I saw you last?'\n\n'He did just once, an' then it was all the old ways again. I did what\nyou told me; I did, as sure as I'm a-standin' 'ere! I made the room so\nclean you wouldn't have believed; I scrubbed the floor an' the table,\nan' I washed the winders--you can see they ain't dirty yet. An' he'd\nnever a' paid a bit o' notice if I hadn't told him, He was jolly enough\nfor one night, just like he can be when he likes. But I knew as it\nwouldn't last, an' the next night he was off with a lot o' fellers an'\ngirls, same as ever. I didn't make no row when he came 'ome; I wish I\nmay die if I said a word to set his back up! An' I've gone on just the\nsame all the week; we haven't had not the least bit of a row; so you\nsee I kep' my promise. But it's no good; he won't come 'ome; he's\nalways got fellers an' girls to go round with. He took his hoath as\nhe'd come back to-night, an' then it come into my 'ed as I'd put my\nbest things on, just to--you know what I mean, Miss Snowdon. But he\nwon't come before twelve o'clock; I know he won't. An' I get that low\nsittin' 'ere, you can't think I can't go nowhere, because o' the\nchildren. If it wasn't for them I could go to work again, an' I'd be\nthat glad; I feel as if my 'ed would drop off sometimes! I _ham_ so\nglad you just come in!'\n\nJane had tried so many forms of encouragement, of consolation, on\nprevious occasions that she knew not how to repeat herself. She was\nashamed to speak words which sounded so hollow and profitless. This\nsilence was only too significant to Pennyloaf, and in a moment she\nexclaimed with querulous energy:\n\n'I know what'll be the bend of it! I'll go an' do like mother does--I\nwill! I will! I'll put my ring away, an' I'll go an' sit all night in\nthe public-'ouse! It's what all the others does, an' I'll do the same.\nI often feel I'm a fool to go on like this. I don't know what I live\nfor, P'r'aps he'll be sorry when I get run in like mother.'\n\n'Don't talk like that, Pennyloaf!' cried Jane, stamping her foot, (It\nwas odd how completely difference of character had reversed their\nnatural relations to each other; Pennyloaf was the child, Jane the\nmature woman.) 'You know better, and you've no right to give way to\nsuch thoughts. I was going to say I'd come and be with you all Saturday\nafternoon, but I don't know whether I shall now. And I'd been thinking\nyou might like to come and see me on Sunday, but I can't have people\nthat go to the public-house, so we won't say anything more about it. I\nshall have to be off; good-bye!'\n\nShe stepped to the door.\n\n'Miss Snowdon!'\n\nJane turned, and after an instant of mock severity, broke into a laugh\nwhich seemed to fill the wretched den with sunlight. Words, too, she\nfound; words of soothing influence such as leap from the heart to the\ntongue in spite of the heavy thoughts that try to check them. Pennyloaf\nwas learning to depend upon these words for strength in her desolation.\nThey did not excite her to much hopefulness, but there was a sustaining\npower in their sweet sincerity which made all the difference between\ndespair tending to evil and the sigh of renewed effort. 'I don't care,'\nPennyloaf had got into the habit of thinking, after her friend's\ndeparture, 'I won't give up as long as she looks in now and then.'\n\nOut from the swarm of babies Jane hurried homewards. She had a reason\nfor wishing to be back in good time to-night; it was Wednesday, and on\nWednesday evening there was wont to come a visitor, who sat for a\ncouple of hours in her grandfather's room and talked, talked--the most\ninteresting talk Jane had ever heard or could imagine. A latch-key\nadmitted her; she ran up to the second floor. A voice from the\nfront-room caught her ear; certainly not _his_ voice--it was too\nearly--but that of some unusual visitor. She was on the point of\nentering her own chamber, when the other door opened, and somebody\nexclaimed, 'Ah, here she is!'\n\nThe speaker was an old gentleman, dressed in black, bald, with small\nand rather rugged features; his voice was pleasant. A gold chain and a\nbunch of seals shone against his waistcoat, also a pair of eye-glasses.\nA professional man, obviously. Jane remembered that she had seen him\nonce before, about a year ago, when he had talked with her for a few\nminutes, very kindly.\n\n'Will you come in here, Jane?' her grandfather's voice called to her.\n\nSnowdon had changed much. Old age was heavy upon his shoulders, and had\neven produced a slight tremulousness in his hands; his voice told the\nsame story of enfeeblement. Even more noticeable was the ageing of his\ncountenance. Something more, however, than the progress of time seemed\nto be here at work. He looked strangely careworn; his forehead was set\nin lines of anxiety; his mouth expressed a nervousness of which\nformerly there had been no trace. One would have said that some\nharassing preoccupation must have seized his mind. His eyes were no\nlonger merely sad and absent, but restless with fatiguing thought. As\nJane entered the room he fixed his gaze upon her--a gaze that appeared\nto reveal worrying apprehension.\n\n'You remember Mr. Percival, Jane,' he said.\n\nThe old gentleman thus presented held out his hand with something of\nfatherly geniality.\n\n'Miss Snowdon, I hope to have the pleasure of seeing you again before\nlong, but just now I am carrying off your grandfather for a couple of\nhours, and indeed we mustn't linger that number of minutes. You look\nwell, I think?'\n\nHe stood and examined her intently, then cried:\n\n'Come, my dear sir, come! we shall be late.'\n\nSnowdon was already prepared for walking. He spoke a few words to Jane,\nthen followed Mr. Percival downstairs.\n\nFlurried by the encounter, Jane stood looking about her. Then came a\nrush of disappointment as she reflected that the visitor of Wednesday\nevenings would call in vain. Hearing that her grandfather was absent,\ndoubtless he would take his leave at once. Or, would he--\n\nIn a minute or two she ran downstairs to exchange a word with Mrs.\nByass. On entering the kitchen she was surprised to see Bessie sitting\nidly by the fire. At this hour it was usual for Mr. Byass to have\nreturned, and there was generally an uproar of laughing talk. This\nevening, dead silence, and a noticeable something in the air which told\nof trouble. The baby--of course a new baby--lay in a bassinette near\nits mother, seemingly asleep; the other child was sitting in a high\nchair by the table, clattering 'bricks.'\n\nBessie did not even look round.\n\n'Is Mr. Byass late?' inquired Jane, in an apprehensive voice.\n\n'He's somewhere in the house, I believe,' was the answer, in monotone.\n\n'Oh dear!' Jane recognised a situation which had already come under her\nnotice once or twice during the last six months. She drew near, and\nasked in a low voice:\n\n'What's happened, Mrs. Byass?'\n\n'He's a beast! If he doesn't mind I shall go and leave him. I mean it!'\n\nBessie was in a genuine fit of sullenness. One of her hands was\nclenched below her chin; her pretty lips were not pretty at all; her\nbrow was rumpled. Jane began to seek for the cause of dissension, to\nput affectionate questions, to use her voice soothingly.\n\n'He's a beast!' was Bessie's reiterated observation; but by degrees she\nadded phrases more explanatory. 'How can I help it if he cuts himself\nwhen he's shaving?--Serve him right!--What for? Why, for saying that\nbabies was nothing but a nuisance, and that _my_ baby was the ugliest\nand noisiest ever born!'\n\n'Did she cry in the night?' inquired Jane, with sympathy.\n\n'Of course she did! Hasn't she a right to?'\n\n'And then Mr. Byass cut himself with his razor?'\n\n'Yes. And he said it was because he was woke so often, and it made him\nnervous, and his hand shook. And then I told him he'd better cut\nhimself on the other side, and it wouldn't matter. And then he\ncomplained because he had to wait for breakfast. And he said there'd\nbeen no comfort in the house since we'd had children. And I cared\nnothing about him, he said, and only about the baby and Ernest. And he\nwent on like a beast, as he is! I hate him!'\n\n'Oh no, not a bit of it!' said Jane, seeing the opportunity for a\ntransition to jest.\n\n'I do! And you may go upstairs and tell him so.'\n\n'All right; I will.'\n\nJane ran upstairs and knocked at the door of the parlour. A gruff voice\nbade her enter, but the room was nearly in darkness.\n\n'Will you have a light, Mr. Byass?'\n\n'No--thank you.'\n\n'Mr. Byass, Mrs. Byass says I'm to say she hates you.'\n\n'All right. Tell her I've known it a long time. She needn't trouble\nabout me; I'm going out to enjoy myself.'\n\nJane ran back to the kitchen.\n\n'Mr. Byass says he's known it a long time,' she reported, with much\ngravity. 'And he's going out to enjoy himself.'\n\nBessie remained mute.\n\n'What message shall I take back, Mrs. Byass?'\n\n'Tell him if he dares to leave the house, I'll go to mother's the first\nthing to-morrow, and let them know how he's treating me.'\n\n'Tell her,' was Mr. Byass's reply, 'that I don't see what it matters to\nher whether I'm at home or away. And tell her she's a cruel wife to me.'\n\nSomething like the sound of a snivel came out of the darkness as he\nconcluded. Jane, in reporting his speech, added that she thought he was\nshedding tears. Thereupon Bessie gave a sob, quite in earnest.\n\n'So am I,' she said chokingly. 'Go and tell him, Jane.'\n\n'Mr. Byass, Mrs. Byass is crying,' whispered Jane at the parlour-door.\n'Don't you think you'd better, go downstairs?'\n\nHearing a movement, she ran to be out of the way. Samuel left the dark\nroom, and with slow step descended to the kitchen. Then Jane knew that\nit was all right, and tripped up to her room humming a song of\ncontentment.\n\nHad she, then, wholly outgrown the bitter experiences of her childhood?\nHad the cruelty which tortured her during the years when the soul is\nbeing fashioned left upon her no brand of slavish vice, nor the\nbaseness of those early associations affected her with any irremovable\ntaint? As far as human observation could probe her, Jane Snowdon had no\nspot of uncleanness in her being; she had been rescued while it was yet\ntime, and the subsequent period of fostering had enabled features of\nher character, which no one could have discerned in the helpless child,\nto expand with singular richness. Two effects of the time of her\nbondage were, however, clearly to be distinguished. Though nature had\nendowed her with a good intelligence, she could only with extreme\nlabour acquire that elementary book-knowledge which vulgar children get\neasily enough; it seemed as if the bodily overstrain at a critical\nperiod of life had affected her memory, and her power of mental\napplication generally. In spite of ceaseless endeavour, she could not\nyet spell words of the least difficulty; she could not do the easiest\nsums with accuracy; geographical names were her despair. The second\npoint in which she had suffered harm was of more serious nature. She\nwas subject to fits of hysteria, preceded and followed by the most\npainful collapse of that buoyant courage which was her supreme charm\nand the source of her influence. Without warning, an inexplicable\nterror would fall upon her; like the weakest child, she craved\nprotection from a dread inspired solely by her imagination, and solace\nfor an anguish of wretchedness to which she could give no form in\nwords. Happily this illness afflicted her only at long intervals, and\nher steadily improving health gave warrant for hoping that in time it\nwould altogether pass away.\n\nWhenever an opportunity had offered for struggling successfully with\nsome form of evil--were it poor Pennyloaf's dangerous despair, or the\nvery human difficulties between Bessie and her husband--Jane lived at\nher highest reach of spiritual joy. For all that there was a\ndisappointment on her mind, she felt this joy to-night, and went about\nher pursuits in happy self-absorption. So it befell that she did not\nhear a knock at the house-door. Mrs. Byass answered it, and not knowing\nthat Mr. Snowdon was from home, bade his usual visitor go upstairs. The\nvisitor did so, and announced his presence at the door of the room.\n\n'Oh, Mr. Kirkwood,' said Jane, 'I'm so sorry, but grandfather had to go\nout with a gentleman.'\n\nAnd she waited, looking at him, a gentle warmth on her face.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nDIALOGUE AND COMMENT\n\n'Will it be late before he comes back?' asked Sidney, his smile of\ngreeting shadowed with disappointment.\n\n'Not later than half-past ten, he said.'\n\nSidney turned his face to the stairs. The homeward prospect was dreary\nafter that glimpse of the familiar mom through the doorway. The breach\nof habit discomposed him, and something more positive strengthened his\nreluctance to be gone. It was not his custom to hang in hesitancy and\ncourt chance by indirectness of speech; recognising and admitting his\nmotives, he said simply:\n\n'I should like to stay a little, if you will let me--if I shan't be in\nyour way?'\n\n'Oh no! Please come in. I'm only sewing.'\n\nThere were two round-backed wooden chairs in the room; one stood on\neach side of the fireplace, and between them, beside the table, Jane\nalways had her place on a small chair of the ordinary comfortless kind.\nShe seated herself as usual, and Sidney took his familiar position,\nwith the vacant chair opposite. Snowdon and he were accustomed to smoke\ntheir pipes whilst conversing, but this evening Sidney dispensed with\ntobacco.\n\nIt was very quiet here. On the floor below dwelt at present two sisters\nwho kept themselves alive (it is quite inaccurate to use any other\nphrase in such instances) by doing all manner of skilful needlework;\nthey were middle-aged women, gentle-natured, and so thoroughly subdued\nto the hopelessness of their lot that scarcely ever could even their\nfootfall be heard as they went up and down stairs; their voices were\nalways sunk to a soft murmur. Just now no infant wailing came from the\nByasses' regions. Kirkwood enjoyed a sense of restfulness, intenser,\nperhaps, for the momentary disappointment he had encountered. He had no\ndesire to talk; enough for a few minutes to sit and watch Jane's hand\nas it moved backwards and forwards with the needle.\n\n'I went to see Pennyloaf as I came back from work,' Jane said at\nlength, just looking up.\n\n'Did you? Do things seem to be any better?'\n\n'Not much, I'm afraid. Mr. Kirkwood, don't you think you might do\nsomething? If you tried again with her husband?'\n\n'The fact is,' replied Sidney, 'I'm so afraid of doing more harm than\ngood.'\n\n'You think--But then perhaps that's just what _I'm_ doing?'\n\nJane let her hand fall on the sewing and regarded him anxiously.\n\n'No, no! I'm quite sure _you_ can't do harm. Pennyloaf can get nothing\nbut good from having you as a friend. She likes you; she misses you\nwhen you happen not to have seen her for a few days. I'm sorry to say\nit's quite a different thing with Bob and me. We're friendly enough--as\nfriendly as ever--but I haven't a scrap of influence with him like you\nhave with his wife. It was all very well to get hold of him once, and\ntry to make him understand, in a half-joking way, that he wasn't\nbehaving as well as he might. He didn't take it amiss--just that once.\nBut you can't think how difficult it is for one man to begin preaching\nto another. The natural thought is: Mind your own business. If I was\nthe parson of the parish--'\n\nHe paused, and in the same instant their eyes met. The suggestion was\nirresistible; Jane began to laugh merrily.\n\nWhat sweet laughter it was? How unlike the shrill discord whereby the\nordinary workgirl expresses her foolish mirth! For years Sidney\nKirkwood had been unused to utter any sound of merriment; even his\nsmiling was done sadly. But of late he had grown conscious of the\nelement of joy in Jane's character, had accustomed himself to look for\nits manifestations--to observe the brightening of her eyes which\nforetold a smile, the moving of her lips which suggested inward\nlaughter--and he knew that herein, as in many another matter, a\nprofound sympathy was transforming him. Sorrow such as he had suffered\nwill leave its mark upon the countenance long after time has done its\nkindly healing, and in Sidney's case there was more than the mere\npersonal affliction tending to confirm his life in sadness. With the\nripening of his intellect, he saw only more and more reason to condemn\nand execrate those social disorders of which his own wretched\nexperience was but an illustration. From the first, his friendship with\nSnowdon had exercised upon him a subduing influence; the old man was\nstern enough in his criticism of society, but he did not belong to the\nsame school as John Hewett, and the sober authority of his character\nmade appeal to much in Sidney that had found no satisfaction amid the\nuproar of Clerkenwell Green. For all that, Kirkwood could not become\nother than himself; his vehemence was moderated, but he never affected\nto be at one with Snowdon in that grave enthusiasm of far-off hope\nwhich at times made the old man's speech that of an exhorting prophet.\nTheir natural parts were reversed; the young eyes declared that they\ncould see nothing but an horizon of blackest cloud, whilst those\nenfeebled by years bore ceaseless witness to the raying forth of dawn.\n\nAnd so it was with a sensation of surprise that Sidney first became\naware of light-heartedness in the young girl who was a silent hearer of\nso many lugubrious discussions. Ridiculous as it may sound--as Sidney\nfelt it to be--he almost resented this evidence of happiness; to him,\nonly just recovering from a shock which would leave its mark upon his\nlife to the end, his youth wronged by bitter necessities, forced into\nbrooding over problems of ill when nature would have bidden him enjoy,\nit seemed for the moment a sign of shallowness that Jane could look and\nspeak cheerfully. This extreme of morbid feeling proved its own cure;\neven in reflecting upon it, Sidney was constrained to laugh\ncontemptuously at himself. And therewith opened for him a new world of\nthought. He began to study the girl. Of course he had already occupied\nhimself much with the peculiarities of her position, but of Jane\nherself he knew very little; she was still, in his imagination, the\nfearful and miserable child over whose shoulders he had thrown his coat\none bitter night; his impulse towards her was one of compassion merely,\njustified now by what he heard of her mental slowness, her bodily\nsufferings. It would take very long to analyse the process whereby this\nmode of feeling was changed, until it became the sense of\never-deepening sympathy which so possessed him this evening. Little by\nlittle Jane's happiness justified itself to him, and in so doing began\nsubtly to modify his own temper. With wonder he recognised that the\npoor little serf of former days had been meant by nature for one of the\nmost joyous among children. What must that heart have suffered, so\nscorned and trampled upon! But now that the days of misery were over,\nbehold nature having its way after all. If the thousands are never\nrescued from oppression, if they perish abortive in their wretchedness,\nis that a reason for refusing to rejoice with the one whom fate has\nblest? Sidney knew too much of Jane by this time to judge her\nshallow-hearted. This instinct of gladness had a very different\nsignificance from the animal vitality which prompted the constant\nlaughter of Bessie Byass; it was but one manifestation of a moral force\nwhich made itself nobly felt in many another way. In himself Sidney was\nexperiencing its pure effects, and it was owing to his conviction of\nJane's power for good that he had made her acquainted with Bob Hewett's\nwife. Snowdon warmly approved of this; the suggestion led him to speak\nexpressly of Jane, a thing he very seldom did, and to utter a strong\nwish that she should begin to concern herself with the sorrows she\nmight in some measure relieve.\n\nSidney joined in the laughter he had excited by picturing himself the\nparson of the parish. But the topic under discussion was a serious one,\nand Jane speedily recovered her gravity.\n\n'Yes, I see how hard it is,' she said. 'But it's a cruel thing for him\nto neglect poor Pennyloaf as he does. She never gave him any cause.'\n\n'Not knowingly, I quite believe,' replied Kirkwood. 'But what a\nmiserable home it is!'\n\n'Yes.' Jane shook her head. 'She doesn't seem to know how to keep\nthings in order. She doesn't seem even to understand me when I try to\nshow her how it might be different.'\n\n'There's the root of the trouble, Jane. What chance had Pennyloaf of\never learning how to keep a decent home, and bring up her children\nproperly? How was _she_ brought up? The wonder is that there's so much\ndownright good in her; I feel the same wonder about people every day.\nSuppose Pennyloaf behaved as badly as her mother does, who on earth\nwould have the right to blame her? But we can't expect miracles; so\nlong as she lives decently, it's the most that can be looked for. And\nthere you are; that isn't enough to keep a fellow like Bob Hewett in\norder. I doubt whether any wife would manage it, but as for poor\nPennyloaf--'\n\n'I shall speak to him myself,' said Jane quietly.\n\n'Do! There's much more hope in that than in anything I could say. Bob\nisn't a bad fellow; the worst thing I know of him is his conceit. He's\ngood-looking, and he's clever in all sorts of ways, and unfortunately\nhe can't think of anything but his own merits. Of course he'd no\nbusiness to marry at all whilst he was nothing but a boy.'\n\nJane plied her needle, musing.\n\n'Do you know whether he ever goes to see his father?' Sidney inquired\npresently.\n\n'No, I don't,' Jane answered, looking at him, but immediately dropping\nher eyes.\n\n'If he doesn't I should think worse of him. Nobody ever had a kinder\nfather, and there's many a reason why he should be careful to pay the\ndebt he owes.'\n\nJane waited a moment, then again raised her eyes to him. It seemed as\nthough she would ask a question, and Sidney's grave attentiveness\nindicated a surmise of what she was about to say. But her thought\nremained unuttered, and there was a prolongation of silence.\n\nOf course they were both thinking of Clara. That name had never been\nspoken by either of them in the other's presence, but as often as\nconversation turned upon the Hewetts, it was impossible for them not to\nsupplement their spoken words by a silent colloquy of which Clara was\nthe subject. From her grandfather Jane knew that, to this day, nothing\nhad been heard of Hewett's daughter; what people said at the time of\nthe girl's disappearance she had learned fully enough from Clem\nPeckover, who even yet found it pleasant to revive the scandal, and by\ncontemptuous comments revenge herself for Clara's haughty usage in old\ndays. Time had not impaired Jane's vivid recollection of that\nBank-holiday morning when she herself was the first to make it known\nthat Clara had gone away. Many a time since then she had visited the\nstreet whither Snowdon led her--had turned aside from her wonted paths\nin the thought that it was not impossible she might meet Clara, though\nwhether with more hope or fear of such a meeting she could not have\nsaid. When two years had gone by, her grandfather one day led the talk\nto that subject; he was then beginning to change in certain respects\nthe tone he had hitherto used with her, and to address her as one who\nhad outgrown childhood. He explained to her how it came about that\nSidney could no longer be even on terms of acquaintance with John\nHewett. The conversation originated in Jane's bringing the news that\nHewett and his family had at length left Mrs. Peckover's house. For two\nyears things had gone miserably with them, their only piece of good\nfortune being the death of the youngest child. John was confirmed in a\nhabit of drinking. Not that he had become a brutal sot; sometimes for\nas much as a month he would keep sober, and even when he gave way to\ntemptation he never behaved with violence to his wife and children.\nStill, the character of his life had once more suffered a degradation,\nand he possessed no friends who could be of the least use to him.\nSnowdon, for some reason of his own, maintained a slight intercourse\nwith the Peckovers, and through them he endeavoured to establish an\nintimacy with Hewett; but the project utterly failed. Probably on\nKirkwood's account, John met the old man's advances with something more\nthan coldness. Sternly he had forbidden his wife and the little ones to\nexchange a word of any kind with Sidney, or with any friend of his. He\nappeared to nourish incessantly the bitter resentment to which he gave\nexpression when Sidney and he last met.\n\nThere was no topic on which Sidney was more desirous of speaking with\nJane than this which now occupied both their minds. How far she\nunderstood Clara's story, and his part in it, he had no knowledge; for\nbetween Snowdon and himself there had long been absolute silence on\nthat matter. It was not improbable that Jane had been instructed in the\ntruth; he hoped she had not been left to gather what she could from\nClem Peckover's gossip. Yet the difficulty with which he found himself\nbeset, now that an obvious opportunity offered for frank speech, was so\ngreat that, after a few struggles, he fell back on the reflection with\nwhich he was wont to soothe himself: Jane was still so young, and the\nprogress of time, by confirming her knowledge of him, would make it all\nthe simpler to explain the miserable past. Had he, in fact, any right\nto relate this story, to seek her sympathy in that direct way? It was\none aspect of a very grave question which occupied more and more of\nSidney's thought.\n\nWith an effort, he turned the dialogue into quite a new direction, and\nJane, though a little absent for some minutes, seemed at length to\nforget the abruptness of the change. Sidney had of late been resuming\nhis old interest in pencil-work; two or three of his drawings hung on\nthese walls, and he spoke of making new sketches when he next went into\nthe country. Years ago, one of his favourite excursions--of the longer\nones which he now and then allowed himself--was to Danbury Hill, some\nfive miles to the east of Chelmsford, one of the few pieces of rising\nground in Essex, famous for its view over Maldon and the estuary of the\nBlackwater. Thither Snowdon and Jane accompanied him during the last\nsummer but one, and the former found so much pleasure in the place that\nhe took lodgings with certain old friends of Sidney's, and gave his\ngranddaughter a week of healthful holiday. In the summer that followed,\nthe lodgings were again taken for a week, and this year the same\nexpedition was in view. Sidney had as good as promised that he would\njoin his friends for the whole time of their absence, and now he talked\nwith Jane of memories and anticipations. Neither was sensible how the\nquarters and the half-hours went by in such chatting. Sidney abandoned\nhimself to the enjoyment of peace such as he had never known save in\nthis room, to a delicious restfulness such as was always inspired in\nhim by the girl's gentle voice, by her laughter, by her occasional\nquiet movements. The same influence was affecting his whole life. To\nJane he owed the gradual transition from tumultuous politics and social\nbitterness to the mood which could find pleasure as of old in nature\nand art. This was his truer self, emancipated from the distorting\neffect of the evil amid which he perforce lived. He was recovering\nsomewhat of his spontaneous boyhood; at the same time, reaching after a\nnew ideal of existence which only ripened manhood could appreciate.\n\nSnowdon returned at eleven; it alarmed Sidney to find how late he had\nallowed himself to remain, and he began shaping apologies. But the old\nman had nothing but the familiar smile and friendly words.\n\n'Haven't you given Mr. Kirkwood any supper?' he asked of Jane, looking\nat the table.\n\n'I really forgot all about it, grandfather,' was the laughing reply.\n\nThen Snowdon laughed, and Sidney joined in the merriment; but he would\nnot be persuaded to stay longer.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nCLEM MAKES A DISCLOSURE\n\nWhen Miss Peckover suggested to her affianced that their wedding might\nas well take place at the registry-office, seeing that there would then\nbe no need to go to expense in the article of costume, Mr. Snowdon\nreadily assented; at the same time it gave him new matter for\nspeculation. Clem was not exactly the kind of girl to relinquish\nwithout good reason that public ceremony which is the dearest of all\npossible ceremonies to women least capable of reverencing its\nsignificance. Every day made it more obvious that the Peckovers desired\nto keep this marriage a secret until it was accomplished. In one way\nonly could Joseph James account for the mystery running through the\nwhole affair; it must be that Miss Peckover had indiscretions to\nconceal, certain points in her history with which she feared lest her\nbridegroom should be made acquainted by envious neighbours. The thought\nhad no effect upon Mr. Snowdon save to excite his mirth; his attitude\nwith regard to such possibilities was that of a philosopher. The views\nwith which he was entering upon this alliance were so beautifully\nsimple that he really did not find it worth while to puzzle further as\nsoon as the plausible solution of his difficulties had presented\nitself. Should he hereafter discover that something unforeseen\nperturbed the smooth flow of life to which he looked forward, nothing\ncould be easier than his remedy; the world is wide, and a cosmopolitan\ndoes not attach undue importance to a marriage contracted in one of its\nsomewhat numerous parishes. In any case he would have found the\ntemporary harbour of refuge which stress of weather had made necessary.\nHe surrendered himself to the pleasant tickling of his vanity which was\nan immediate result of the adventure. For, whatever Clem might be\nhiding, it seemed to him beyond doubt that she was genuinely attracted\nby his personal qualities. Her demonstrations were not extravagant, but\nin one noteworthy respect she seemed to give evidence of a sensibility\nso little in keeping with her general character that it was only to be\nexplained as the result of a strong passion. In conversing with him she\nat times displayed a singular timidity, a nervousness, a self-subdual\nsurprisingly unlike anything that could be expected from her. It was\ntrue that at other moments her lover caught a gleam in her eyes, a\nmovement of her lips, expressive of anything rather than diffidence,\nand tending to confirm his view of her as a cunning as well as fierce\nanimal, but the look and tone of subjugation came often enough to make\ntheir impression predominant. One would have said that she suffered\nfrom jealous fears which for some reason she did not venture to utter.\nNow and then he surprised her gazing at him as if in troubled\napprehension, the effect of which upon Mr. Snowdon was perhaps more\nflattering than any other look.\n\n'What's up, Clem?' he inquired, on one of these occasions. 'Are you\nwondering whether I shall cut and leave you when we've had time to get\ntired of each other?'\n\nHer face was transformed; she looked at him for an instant with fierce\nsuspicion, then laughed disagreeably.\n\n'We'll see about that,' was her answer, with a movement of the head and\nshoulders strongly reminding one of a lithe beast about to spring.\n\nThe necessary delay passed without accident. As the morning of the\nmarriage approached there was, however, a perceptible increase of\nnervous restlessness in Clem. She had given up her work at Whitehead's,\nand contrived to keep her future husband within sight nearly all day\nlong. Joseph James found nothing particularly irksome in this, for beer\nand tobacco were supplied him _ad libitum_, and a succession of\nappetising meals made the underground kitchen a place of the\npleasantest associations. A loan from Mrs. Peckover had enabled him to\nrenew his wardrobe. When the last night arrived, Clem and her mother\nsat conversing to a late hour, their voices again cautiously subdued. A\npoint had been for some days at issue between them, and decision was\nnow imperative.\n\n'It's you as started the job,' Clem observed with emphasis, 'an' it's\nyou as'll have to finish it.'\n\n'And who gets most out of it, I'd like to know?' replied her mother.\n'Don't be such a fool! Can't you see as it'll come easier from you? A\nnice thing for his mother-in-law to tell him! If you don't like to do\nit the first day, then leave it to the second, or third. But if you\ntake my advice, you'll get it over the next morning.'\n\n'You'll have to do it yourself,' Clem repeated stubbornly, propping her\nchin upon her fists.\n\n'Well, I never thought as you was such a frightened babby! Frightened\nof a feller like him! I'd be ashamed o' myself!'\n\n'Who's frightened? Hold your row!'\n\n'Why, you are; what else?'\n\n'I ain't!'\n\n'You are!'\n\n'I ain't! You'd better not make me mad, or I'll tell him before, just\nto spite you.'\n\n'Spite _me_, you cat! What difference 'll it make to me? I'll tell you\nwhat: I've a jolly good mind to tell him myself beforehand, and then\nwe'll see who's spited.'\n\nIn the end Clem yielded, shrugging her shoulders defiantly.\n\n'I'll have a kitchen-knife near by when I tell him,' she remarked with\ndecision. 'If he lays a hand on me I'll cut his face open, an' chance\nit!'\n\nMrs. Peckover smiled with tender motherly deprecation of such extreme\nmeasures. But Clem repeated her threat, and there was something in her\neyes which guaranteed the possibility of its fulfilment.\n\nNo personal acquaintance of either the Peckover or the Snowdon family\nhappened to glance over the list of names which hung in the registrar's\noffice during these weeks. The only interested person who had\nforeknowledge of Clem's wedding was Jane Snowdon, and Jane, though\noften puzzled in thinking of the matter, kept her promise to speak of\nit to no one. It was imprudence in Clem to have run this risk, but the\njoke was so rich that she could not deny herself its enjoyment; she\nknew, moreover, that Jane was one of those imbecile persons who scruple\nabout breaking a pledge. On the eve of her wedding-day she met Jane as\nthe latter came from Whitehead's, and requested her to call in the\nClose next Sunday morning at twelve o'clock.\n\n'I want you to see my 'usband,' she said, grinning. 'I'm sure you'll\nlike him.'\n\nJane promised to come. On the next day, Saturday, Clem entered the\nregistry-office in a plain dress, and after a few simple formalities\ncame forth as Mrs. Snowdon; her usual high colour was a trifle\ndiminished, and she kept glancing at her husband from under nervously\nknitted brows. Still the great event was unknown to the inhabitants of\nthe Close. There was no feasting, and no wedding-journey; for the\npresent Mr. and Mrs. Snowdon would take possession of two rooms on the\nfirst floor.\n\nTwenty-four hours later, when the bells of St. James's were ringing\ntheir melodies before service, Clem requested her husband's attention\nto something of importance she had to tell him.\n\nMr. Snowdon had just finished breakfast and was on the point of\nlighting his pipe; with the match burning down to his fingers, he\nturned and regarded the speaker shrewdly. Clem's face put it beyond\nquestion that at last she was about to make a statement definitely\nbearing on the history of the past month. At this moment she was almost\npale, and her eyes avoided his. She stood close to the table, and her\nright hand rested near the bread-knife; her left held a piece of paper.\n\n'What is it?' asked Joseph James mildly. 'Go ahead, Clem.'\n\n'You ain't bad-tempered, are you? You said you wasn't.'\n\n'Not I! Best-tempered feller you could have come across. Look at me\nsmiling.'\n\nHis grin was in a measure reassuring, but he had caught sight of the\npiece of paper in her hand, and eyed it steadily.\n\n'You know you played mother a trick a long time ago,' Clem pursued,\n'when you went off an' left that child on her 'ands.'\n\n'Hollo! What about that?'\n\n'Well, it wouldn't be nothing but fair if someone was to go and play\ntricks with _you_--just to pay you off in a friendly sort o' way--see?'\n\nMr. Snowdon still smiled, but dubiously.\n\n'Out with it!' he muttered. 'I'd have bet a trifle there was some game\non. You're welcome, old girl. Out with it!'\n\n'Did you know as I'd got a brother in 'Stralia--him as you used to know\nwhen you lived here before?'\n\n'You said you didn't know where he was.'\n\n'No more we do--not just now. But he wrote mother a letter about this\ntime last year, an' there's something in it as I'd like you to see.\nYou'd better read for yourself.'\n\nHer husband laid down his pipe on the mantel-piece and began to cast\nhis eye over the letter, which was much defaced by frequent foldings,\nand in any case would have been difficult to decipher, so vilely was it\nscrawled. But Mr. Snowdon's interest was strongly excited, and in a few\nmoments he had made out the following communication:\n\n'I don't begin with no deering, because it's a plaid out thing, and\nbecause I'm riting to too people at onse, both mother and Clem, and\nit's so long since I've had a pen in my hand I've harf forgot how to\nuse it. If you think I'm making my pile, you think rong, so you've got\nno need to ask me when I'm going to send money home, like you did in\nthe last letter. I jest keep myself and that's about all, because\nthings ain't what they used to be in this busted up country. And that\nremminds me what it was as I ment to tell you when I cold get a bit of\ntime to rite. Not so long ago, I met a chap as used to work for\nsomebody called Snowdon, and from what I can make out it was Snowdon's\nbrother at home, him as we use to ere so much about. He'd made his\npile, this Snowdon, you bet, and Ned Williams says he died worth no end\nof thousands. Not so long before he died, his old farther from England\ncame out to live with him; then Snowdon and a son as he had both got\ndrownded going over a river at night. And Ned says as all the money\nwent to the old bloak and to a brother in England, and that's what he\nherd when he was paid off. The old farther made traks very soon, and\nthey sed he'd gone back to England. So it seams to me as you ouht to\nfind Snowdon and make him pay up what he ose you. And I don't know as\nI've anything more to tell you both, ecsep I'm working at a place as I\ndon't know how to spell, and it woldn't be no good if I did, because\nthere's no saying were I shall be before you could rite back. So good\nluck to you both, from yours truly, W. P.'\n\nIn reading, Joseph James scratched his bald head thoughtfully. Before\nhe had reached the end there were signs of emotion in his projecting\nlower lip. At length he regarded Clem, no longer smiling, but without\nany of the wrath she had anticipated.\n\n'Ha, ha! This was your game, was it? Well, I don't object, old girl--so\nlong as you tell me a bit more about it. Now there's no need for any\nmore lies, perhaps you'll mention where the old fellow is.'\n\n'He's livin' not so far away, an' Jane with him.'\n\nPut somewhat at her ease, Clem drew her hand from the neighbourhood of\nthe bread-knife, and detailed all she knew with regard to old Mr.\nSnowdon and his affairs. Her mother had from the first suspected that\nhe possessed money, seeing that he paid, with very little demur, the\nsum she demanded for Jane's board and lodging. True, he went to live in\npoor lodgings, but that was doubtless a personal eccentricity. An\nimportant piece of evidence subsequently forthcoming was the fact that\nin sundry newspapers there appeared advertisements addressed to Joseph\nJames Snowdon, requesting him to communicate with Messrs. Percival &\nPeel of Furnival's Inn, whereupon Mrs. Peckover made inquiries of the\nlegal firm in question (by means of an anonymous letter), and received\na simple assurance that Mr. Snowdon was being sought for his own\nadvantage.\n\n'You're cool hands, you and your mother,' observed Joseph James, with a\ncertain involuntary admiration. 'This was not quite three years ago,\nyou say; just when I was in America. Ha--hum! What I can't make out is,\nhow the devil that brother of mine came to leave anything to me. We\nnever did anything but curse each other from the time we were children\nto when we parted for good. And so the old man went out to Australia,\ndid he? That's a rum affair, too; Mike and he could never get on\ntogether. Well, I suppose there's no mistake about it. I shouldn't much\nmind if there was, just to see the face _you'd_ pull, young woman. On\nthe whole, perhaps it's as well for you that I _am_ fairly\ngood-tempered--eh?'\n\nClem stood apart, smiling dubiously, now and then eyeing him askance.\nHis last words once more put her on her guard; she moved towards the\ntable again.\n\n'Give me the address,' said her husband. 'I'll go and have a talk with\nmy relations. What sort of a girl's Janey grown up--eh?'\n\n'If you'll wait a bit, you can see for yourself. She's goin' to call\nhere at twelve.'\n\n'Oh, she is? I suppose you've arranged a pleasant little surprise for\nher? Well, I must say you're a cool band, Clem. I shouldn't wonder if\nshe's been in the house several times since I've been here?'\n\n'No, she hasn't. It wouldn't have been safe, you see.'\n\n'Give me the corkscrew, and I'll open this bottle of whisky. It takes\nit out of a fellow, this kind of thing. Here's to you, Mrs. Clem! Have\na drink? All right; go downstairs and show your mother you're alive\nstill; and let me know when Jane comes. I want to think a bit.'\n\nWhen he had sat for a quarter of an hour in solitary reflection the\ndoor opened, and Clem led into the room a young girl, whose face\nexpressed timid curiosity. Joseph James stood up, joined his hands\nunder his coat-tail, and examined the stranger.\n\n'Do you know who it is?' asked Clem of her companion.\n\n'Your husband--but I don't know his name.'\n\n'You ought to, it seems to me,' said Clem, giggling. 'Look at him.'\n\nJane tried to regard the man for a moment. Her cheeks flushed with\nconfusion. Again she looked at him, and the colour rapidly faded. In\nher eyes was a strange light of painfully struggling recollection. She\nturned to Clem, and read her countenance with distress.\n\n'Well, I'm quite sure I should never have known _you_, Janey,' said\nSnowdon, advancing. 'Don't you remember your father?'\n\nYes; as soon as consciousness could reconcile what seemed\nimpossibilities Jane had remembered him. She was not seven years old\nwhen he forsook her, and a life of anything but orderly progress had\ntold upon his features. Nevertheless Jane recognised the face she had\nnever had cause to love, recognised yet more certainly the voice which\ncarried her back to childhood. But what did it all mean? The shock was\nmaking her heart throb as it was wont to do before her fits of illness.\nShe looked about her with dazed eyes.\n\n'Sit down, sit down,' said her father, not without a note of genuine\nfeeling. 'It's been a bit too much for you--like something else was for\nme just now. Put some water in that glass, Clem; a drop of this will do\nher good.'\n\nThe smell of what was offered her proved sufficient to restore Jane;\nshe shook her head and put the glass away. After an uncomfortable\nsilence, during which Joseph dragged his feet about the floor, Clem\nremarked:\n\n'He wants you to take him home to see your grandfather, Jane. There's\nbeen reasons why he couldn't go before. Hadn't you better go at once,\nJo?'\n\nJane rose and waited whilst her father assumed his hat and drew on a\nnew pair of gloves. She could not look at either husband or wife.\nPresently she found herself in the street, walking without\nconsciousness of things in the homeward direction.\n\n'You've grown up a very nice, modest girl, Jane,' was her father's\nfirst observation. 'I can see your grandfather has taken good care of\nyou.'\n\nHe tried to speak as if the situation were perfectly simple. Jane could\nfind no reply.\n\n'I thought it was better,' he continued, in the same matter-of-fact\nvoice, 'not to see either of you till this marriage of mine was over.\nI've had a great deal of trouble in life--I'll tell you all about it\nsome day, my dear--and I wanted just to settle myself before--I dare\nsay you'll understand what I mean. I suppose your grandfather has often\nspoken to you about me?'\n\n'Not very often, father,' was the murmured answer.\n\n'Well, well; things'll soon be set right. I feel quite proud of you,\nJaney; I do, indeed. And I suppose you just keep house for him, eh?'\n\n'I go to work as well.'\n\n'What? You go to work? How's that, I wonder?'\n\n'Didn't Miss Peckover tell you?'\n\nJoseph laughed. The girl could not grasp all these astonishing facts at\nonce, and the presence of her father made her forget who Miss Peckover\nhad become.\n\n'You mean my wife, Janey! No, no; she didn't tell me you went to\nwork;--an accident. But I'm delighted you and Clem are such good\nfriends. Kind-hearted girl, isn't she?'\n\nJane whispered an assent.\n\n'No doubt your grandfather often tells you about Australia, and your\nuncle that died there?'\n\n'No, he never speaks of Australia. And I never heard of my uncle.'\n\n'Indeed? Ha--hum!'\n\nJoseph continued his examination all the way to Hanover Street, often\nexpressing surprise, but never varying from the tone of affection and\ngeniality. When they reached the door of the house he said:\n\n'Just let me go into the room by myself. I think it'll be better. He's\nalone, isn't he?'\n\n'Yes. I'll come up and show you the door.'\n\nShe did so, then turned aside into her own room, where she sat\nmotionless for a long time.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nTHE JOKE IS COMPLETED\n\nMichael Snowdon--to distinguish the old man by name from the son who\nthus unexpectedly returned to him--professed no formal religion. He\nattended no Sunday service, nor had ever shown a wish that Jane should\ndo so. We have seen that he used the Bible as a source of moral\ninstruction; Jane and he still read passages together on a Sunday\nmorning, but only such were chosen as had a purely human significance,\nand the comments to which they gave occasion never had any but a human\nbearing. Doubtless Jane reflected on these things; it was her\ngrandfather's purpose to lead her to such reflection, without himself\ndogmatising on questions which from his own point of view were\nunimportant. That Jane should possess the religious spirit was a desire\nhe never lost sight of; the single purpose of his life was involved\ntherein; but formalism was against the bent of his nature. Born and\nbred amid the indifference of the London working classes, he was one of\nthe very numerous thinking men who have never needed to cast aside a\nfaith of childhood; from the dawn of rationality, they simply stand\napart from all religious dogmas, unable to understand the desire of\nsuch helps to conduct, untouched by spiritual trouble--as that phrase\nis commonly interpreted. And it seemed that Jane closely resembled him\nin this matter. Sensitive to every prompting of humanity, instinct with\nmoral earnestness, she betrayed no slightest tendency to the religion\nof church, chapel, or street-corner. A promenade of the Salvation Army\nhalf-puzzled, half-amused her; she spoke of it altogether without\nintolerance, as did her grandfather, but never dreamt that it was a\nphenomenon which could gravely concern her. Prayers she had never said;\nenough that her last thought before sleeping was one of kindness to\nthose beings amid whom she lived her life, that on awaking her mind\nturned most naturally to projects of duty and helpfulness.\n\nExcepting the Bible, Snowdon seldom made use of books either for\ninquiry or amusement. Very imperfectly educated in his youth, he had\nnever found leisure for enriching his mind in the ordinary way until it\nwas too late; as an old man he had so much occupation in his thoughts\nthat the printed page made little appeal to him. Till quite recently he\nhad been in the habit of walking for several hours daily, always\nchoosing poor districts; now that his bodily powers were sensibly\nfailing him, he passed more and more of his time in profound brooding,\nso forgetful of external things that Jane, on her return from work, had\nmore than once been troubled by noticing that he had taken no midday\nmeal. It was in unconsciousness such as this that he sat when his son\nJoseph, receiving no reply to his knock, opened the door and entered;\nbut that his eyes were open, the posture of his body and the forward\ndrooping of his head would have made it appear that he slept. Joseph\nstepped towards him, and at length the old man looked up. He gazed at\nhis visitor first unintelligently, then with wonder and growing emotion.\n\n'Jo?--Jo, at last? You were in my mind only a few minutes ago, but I\nsaw you as a boy.'\n\nHe rose from the chair and held out both his hands, trembling more than\nthey were wont to do.\n\n'I almost wonder you knew me,' said Joseph. 'It's seventeen years since\nwe saw each other. It was all Jane could do to remember me.'\n\n'Jane? Where have you seen her? At the house in the Close?'\n\n'Yes. It was me she went to see, but she didn't know it. I've just been\nmarried to Miss Peckover. Sit down again, father, and let's talk over\nthings quietly.'\n\n'Married to Miss Peckover?' repeated the old man, as if making an\neffort to understand the words. 'Then why didn't you come here before?'\n\nJoseph gave the explanation which he had already devised for the\nbenefit of his daughter. His manner of speaking was meant to be very\nrespectful, but it suggested that he looked upon the hearer as\nsuffering from feebleness of mind, as well as of body. He supplemented\nhis sentences with gestures and smiles, glancing about the room\nmeantime with looks of much curiosity.\n\n'So you've been living here a long time, father? It was uncommonly good\nof you to take care of my girl. I dare say you've got so used to having\nher by you, you wouldn't care for her to go away now?'\n\n'Do you wish to take Jane away?' Michael inquired gravely.\n\n'No, no; not I! Why, it's nothing but her duty to keep you company and\nbe what use she can. She's happy enough, that I can see. Well, well;\nI've gone through a good deal since the old days, father, and I'm not\nwhat you used to know me. I'm gladder than I can say to find you so\neasy in your old age. Neither Mike nor me did our duty by you, that's\nonly too sure. I wish I could have the time back again; but what's the\ngood of that? Can you tell me anything about Mike?'\n\n'Yes. He died in Australia, about four years ago.'\n\n'Did he now? Well, I've been in America, but I never got so far as\nAustralia. So Mike's dead, is he? I hope he had better luck than me.'\n\nThe old man did not cease from examining his son's countenance.\n\n'What is your position, at present?' he asked, after a pause. 'You\ndon't look unprosperous.'\n\n'Nothing to boast of, father. I've gone through all kinds of trades. In\nthe States I both made and lost money. I invented a new method of\nnickel-plating, but it did me no good, and then I gave up that line\naltogether. Since I've been back in England--two years about--I've\nmostly gone in for canvassing, advertising agencies, and that kind of\nthing. I make an honest living, and that's about all. But I shouldn't\nwonder if things go a bit better now; I feel as if I was settled at\nlast. What with having a home of my own, and you and Janey near at\nhand--You won't mind if I come and see you both now and then?'\n\n'I shall hope to see you often,' replied the other, still keeping his\ngrave face and tone. 'It's been my strong desire that we might come\ntogether again, and I've done the best I could to find you. But, as you\nsaid, we've been parted for a very long time, and it isn't in a day\nthat we can come to understand each other. These seventeen years have\nmade an old man of me, Jo; I think and speak and act slowly:--better\nfor us all if I had learned to do so long ago! Your coming was\nunexpected; I shall need a little time to get used to the change it\nmakes.'\n\n'To be sure; that's true enough. Plenty of time to talk over things. As\nfar as I'm concerned, father, the less said about bygones the better;\nit's the future that I care about now. I want to put things right\nbetween us--as they ought to be between father and son. You understand\nme, I hope?'\n\nMichael nodded, keeping his eyes upon the ground. Again there was a\nsilence, then Joseph said that if Jane would come in and speak a few\nwords--so as to make things home-like--it would be time for him to take\nhis leave for the present. At her grandfather's summons Jane entered\nthe room. She was still oppressed by the strangeness of her position,\nand with difficulty took part in the colloquy. Joseph, still touching\nthe note of humility in his talk, eyed his relatives alternately, and\nexhibited reluctance to quit them.\n\nWhen he returned to the Close, it was with a face expressing\ndissatisfaction. Clem's eager inquiries he met at first with an\nill-tempered phrase or two, which informed her of nothing; but when\ndinner was over he allowed himself to be drawn into a confidential\ntalk, in which Mrs. Peckover took part. The old man, he remarked, was\ndevilish close; it looked as if 'some game was on.' Mrs. Peckover\nridiculed this remark; of course there was a game on; she spoke of\nSidney Kirkwood, the influence he had obtained over Snowdon, the\ndesigns he was obviously pursuing. If Joseph thought he would recover\nhis rights, at this time of day, save by direct measures, it only\nproved how needful it was for him to be instructed by shrewd people.\nThe old man was a hard nut to crack; why he lived in Hanover Street,\nand sent Jane to work, when it was certain that he had wealth at\ncommand, Mrs. Peckover could not pretend to explain, but in all\nprobability he found a pleasure in accumulating money, and was abetted\ntherein by Sidney Kirkwood. Clem could bear witness that Jane always\nseemed to have secrets to hide; nevertheless a good deal of information\nhad been extracted from the girl during the last year or so, and it all\nwent to confirm the views which Mrs. Peckover now put forth. After long\ndiscussion, it was resolved that Joseph should call upon the lawyers\nwhose names had appeared in the advertisement addressed to himself. If\nhe was met with any shuffling, or if they merely referred him to his\nfather, the next step would be plain enough.\n\nClem began to exhibit sullenness; her words were few, and it was\nfortunate for Joseph that he could oppose a philosophical indifference\nto the trouble with which his honeymoon was threatened. As early as\npossible on Monday morning he ascended the stairs of a building in\nFurnival's Inn and discovered the office of Messrs. Percival and Feel.\nHe was hesitating whether to knock or simply turn the handle, when a\nman came up to the same door, with the quick step of one at home in the\nplace.\n\n'Business with us?' inquired the newcomer, as Joseph drew back.\n\nThey looked at each other. He who had spoken was comparatively a young\nman, dressed with much propriety, gravely polite in manner.Of\n\n'Ha! How do you do?' exclaimed Snowdon, with embarrassment, and in an\nundertone. 'I wasn't expecting--'\n\nThe recognition was mutual, and whilst Joseph, though disconcerted,\nexpressed his feelings in a familiar smile, the other cast a quick\nglance of uneasiness towards the stairs, his mouth compressed, his\neyebrows twitching a little.\n\n'Business with Mr. Percival?' he inquired confidentially, but without\nJoseph's familiar accentuation.\n\n'Yes. That is--Is he here?'\n\n'Won't be for another hour. Anything I could see about for you?'\n\nJoseph moved in uncertainty, debating with himself. Their eyes met\nagain.\n\n'Well, we might have a word or two about it,' he said. 'Better meet\nsomewhere else, perhaps?'\n\n'Could you be at the top of Chancery Lane at six o'clock?'\n\nWith a look of mutual understanding, they parted. Joseph went home, and\nexplained that, to his surprise, he had found an old acquaintance at\nthe lawyer's office, a man named Scawthorne, whom lie was going to see\nin private before having an interview with the lawyer himself. At six\no'clock the appointed meeting took place, and from Chancery Lane the\npair walked to a quiet house of refreshment in the vicinity of\nLincoln's Inn Fields. On the way they exchanged a few insignificant\nremarks, having reference to a former intimacy and a period during\nwhich they had not come across each other. Established in a\nsemi-private room, with a modest stimulant to aid conversation, they\nbecame more at ease; Mr. Scawthorne allowed himself a discreet smile,\nand Joseph, fingering his glass, broached the matter at issue with a\ncautious question.\n\n'Do you know anything of a man called Snowdon?'\n\n'What Snowdon?'\n\n'Joseph James Snowdon--a friend of mine. Your people advertised for him\nabout three years ago. Perhaps you haven't been at the office as long\nas that?'\n\n'Oh yes. I remember the name. What about him?'\n\n'Your people wanted to find him--something to his advantage. Do you\nhappen to know whether it's any use his coming forward now?'\n\nMr. Scawthorne was not distinguished by directness of gaze. He had\nhandsome features, and a not unpleasant cast of countenance, but\nsomething, possibly the habit of professional prudence, made his regard\ncoldly, fitfully, absently observant. It was markedly so as he turned\nhis face towards Joseph whilst the latter was speaking. After a\nmoment's silence he remarked, without emphasis:\n\n'A relative of yours, you said?'\n\n'No, I said a friend--intimate friend. Polkenhorne knows him too.'\n\n'Does he? I haven't seen Polkenhorne for a long time.'\n\n'You don't care to talk about the business? Perhaps you'd better\nintroduce me to Mr. Percival.'\n\n'By the name of Camden?'\n\n'Hang it! I may as well tell you at once. Snowdon is my own name.'\n\n'Indeed? And how am I to be sure of that?'\n\n'Come and see me where I'm living, in Clerkenwell Close, and then make\ninquiries of my father, in Hanover Street, Islington. There's no reason\nnow for keeping up the old name--a little affair--all put right. But\nthe fact is, I'd as soon find out what this business is with your\noffice without my father knowing. I have reasons; shouldn't mind\ntalking them over with you, if you can give me the information I want.'\n\n'I can do that,' replied Scawthorne with a smile. 'If you are J. J.\nSnowdon, you are requested to communicate with Michael Snowdon--that's\nall.'\n\n'Oh! but I _have_ communicated with him, and he's nothing particular to\nsay to me, as far as I can see.'\n\nScawthorne sipped at his glass, gave a stroke to each side of his\nmoustache, and seemed to reflect.\n\n'You were coming to ask Mr. Percival privately for information?'\n\n'That's just it. Of course if you can't give me any, I must see him\nto-morrow.'\n\n'He won't tell you anything more than I have.'\n\n'And you don't _know_ anything more?'\n\n'I didn't say that, my dear fellow. Suppose you begin by telling me a\nlittle more about yourself?'\n\nIt was a matter of time, but at length the dialogue took another\ncharacter. The glasses of stimulant were renewed, and as Joseph grew\nexpansive Scawthorne laid aside something of his professional reserve,\nwithout, however, losing the discretion which led him to subdue his\nvoice and express himself in uncompromising phrases. Their sitting\nlasted about an hour, and before taking leave of each other they\narranged for a meeting at a different place in the course of a few days.\n\nJoseph walked homewards with deliberation, in absent mood, his\ncountenance alternating strangely between a look of mischievous\njocoseness and irritable concern; occasionally he muttered to himself.\nJust before reaching the Close he turned into a public-house; when he\ncame forth the malicious smile was on his face, and he walked with the\nair of a man who has business of moment before him. He admitted himself\nto the house.\n\n'That you, Jo?' cried Clem's voice from upstairs.\n\n'Me, sure enough,' was the reply, with a chuckle. 'Come up sharp, then.'\n\nHumming a tune, Joseph ascended to the sitting-room on the first floor,\nand threw himself on a seat. His wife stood just in front of him, her\nsturdy arms a-kimbo; her look was fiercely expectant, answering in some\ndegree to the smile with which he looked here and there.\n\n'Well, can't you speak?'\n\n'No hurry, Mrs. Clem; no hurry, my dear. It's all right. The old man's\nrolling in money.'\n\n'And what about your share?'\n\nJoseph laughed obstreperously, his wife's brow lowering the while.\n\n'Just tell me, can't you?' she cried.\n\n'Of course I will. The best joke you ever heard. You had yours\nyesterday, Mrs. Clem; my turn comes to-day. My share is--just nothing\nat all. Not a penny! Not a cent! Swallow that, old girl, and tell me\nhow it tastes.'\n\n'You're a liar!' shouted the other, her face flushing scarlet, her eyes\naflame with rage.\n\n'Never told a lie in my life,' replied her husband, still laughing\nnoisily. But for that last glass of cordial on the way home he could\nscarcely have enjoyed so thoroughly the dramatic flavour of the\nsituation. Joseph was neither a bully nor a man of courage; the joke\nwith which he was delighting himself was certainly a rich one, but it\nhad its element of danger, and only by abandoning himself to riotous\nmirth could he overcome the nervousness with which Clem's fury\nthreatened to affect him. She, coming forward in the attitude of an\nenraged fishwife, for a few moments made the room ring with foul abuse,\nthat vituperative vernacular of the nether world, which has never yet\nbeen exhibited by typography, and presumably never will be.\n\n'Go it, Clem!' cried her husband, pushing his chair a little back. 'Go\nit, my angel! When you've eased your mind a little, I'll explain how it\nhappens.'\n\nShe became silent, glaring at him with murderous eyes. But just at that\nmoment Mrs. Peckover put her head in at the door, inquiring 'What's up?'\n\n'Come in, if you want to know,' cried her daughter. 'See what you've\nlet me in for! Didn't I tell you as it might be all a mistake? Oh yes,\nyou may look!'\n\nMrs. Peckover was startled; her small, cunning eyes went rapidly from\nClem to Joseph, and she fixed the latter with a gaze of angry suspicion.\n\n'Got a bit of news for you, mother,' resumed Joseph, nodding. 'You and\nClem were precious artful, weren't you now? It's my turn now. Thought\nI'd got money--ha, ha!'\n\n'And so you have,' replied Mrs. Peckover. 'We know all about it, so you\nneedn't try your little game.'\n\n'Know all about it, do you? Well, see here. My brother Mike died out in\nAustralia, and his son died at the same time--they was drowned. Mike\nleft no will, and his wife was dead before him. What's the law, eh?\nPity you didn't make sure of that. Why, all his money went to the old\nman, every cent of it. I've no claim on a penny. That's the law, my\npretty dears!'\n\n'He's a ---- liar!' roared Clem, who at the best of times would have\nbrought small understanding to a legal question. 'What did my brother\nsay in his letter?'\n\n'He was told wrong, that's all, or else he got the idea out of his own\nhead.'\n\n'Then why did they advertise for you?' inquired Mrs. Peckover, keeping\nperfect command of her temper.\n\n'The old man thought he'd like to find his son again, that's all. Ha,\nha! Why can't you take it good-humoured, Clem? You had your joke\nyesterday, and you can't say I cut up rough about it. I'm a\ngood-natured fellow, I am. There's many a man would have broke every\nbone in your body, my angel, you just remember that!'\n\nIt rather seemed as if the merry proceeding would in this case be\nreversed; Joseph had risen, and was prepared to defend himself from an\nonslaught. But Mrs. Peckover came between the newly-wedded pair, and by\ndegrees induced Clem to take a calmer view of the situation, or at all\nevents to postpone her vengeance. It was absurd, she argued, to act as\nif the matter were hopeless. Michael Snowdon would certainly leave\nJoseph money in his will, if only the right steps were taken to secure\nhis favour. Instead of quarrelling, they must put their heads together\nand scheme. She had her ideas; let them listen to her.\n\n'Clem, you go and get a pot of old six for supper, and don't be such a\n---- fool,' was her final remark.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nA RETREAT\n\nVisiting his friends as usual on Sunday evening, Sidney Kirkwood felt,\nbefore he had been many minutes in the room, that something unwonted\nwas troubling the quiet he always found here. Michael Snowdon was\nunlike himself, nervously inattentive, moving frequently, indisposed to\nconverse on any subject. Neither had Jane her accustomed brightness,\nand the frequent glances she east at her grandfather seemed to show\nthat the latter's condition was causing her anxiety. She withdrew very\nearly, and, as at once appeared, in order that Sidney might hear in\nprivate what had that day happened. The story of Clem Peckover's\nmarriage naturally occasioned no little astonishment in Sidney.\n\n'And how will all this affect Jane?' he asked involuntarily.\n\n'That is what I cannot tell,' replied Michael. 'It troubles me. My son\nis a stranger; all these years have made him quite a different man from\nwhat I remember; and the worst is, I can no longer trust myself to\njudge him. Yet I must know the truth--Sidney, I must know the truth.\nIt's hard to speak ill of the only son left to me out of the four I\nonce had, but if I think of him as he was seventeen years ago--no, no,\nhe must have changed as he has grown older. But you must help me to\nknow him, Sidney.'\n\nAnd in a very few days Sidney had his first opportunity of observing\nJane's father. At this meeting Joseph seemed to desire nothing so much\nas to recommend himself by an amiable bearing. Impossible to speak with\nmore engaging frankness than he did whilst strolling away from Hanover\nStreet in Sidney's company. Thereafter the two saw a great deal of each\nother. Joseph was soon a familiar visitor in Tysoe Street; he would\ncome about nine o'clock of an evening, and sit till after midnight. The\nstaple of his talk was at first the painfully unnatural relations\nexisting between his father, his daughter, and himself. He had led a\nmost unsatisfactory life; he owned it, deplored it. That the old man\nshould distrust him was but natural; but would not Sidney, as a common\nfriend, do his best to dispel this prejudice? On the subject of his\nbrother Mike he kept absolute silence. The accident of meeting an\nintimate acquaintance at the office of Messrs. Percival and Peel had\nrendered it possible for him to pursue his inquiries in that direction\nwithout it becoming known to Michael Snowdon that he had done anything\nof the kind; and the policy he elaborated for himself demanded the\nappearance of absolute disinterestedness in all his dealings with his\nfather. Aided by the shrewd Mrs. Peckover, he succeeded in reconciling\nClem to a present disappointment, bitter as it was, by pointing out\nthat there was every chance of his profiting largely upon the old man's\ndeath, which could not be a very remote contingency. At present there\nwas little that could be done save to curry favour in Hanover Street,\nand keep an eye on what went forward between Kirkwood and Jane. This\nlatter was, of course, an issue of supreme importance. A very little\nobservation convinced Joseph that his daughter had learned to regard\nSidney as more than a friend; whether there existed any mutual\nunderstanding between them he could only discover by direct inquiry,\nand for the present it seemed wiser to make no reference to the\nsubject. He preserved the attitude of one who has forfeited his natural\nrights, and only seeks with humility the chance of proving that he is a\nreformed character. Was, or was not, Kirkwood aware of the old man's\nwealth? That too must be left uncertain, though it was more than\nprobable he had seen the advertisement in the newspapers, and, like\nMrs. Peckover, had based conclusions thereupon. Another possibility\nwas, that Kirkwood had wormed himself into Michael's complete\nconfidence. From Joseph's point of view, subtle machinations were\nnaturally attributed to the young man--whose appearance proved him\nanything but a commonplace person. The situation was full of\nobscurities and dangers. From Scawthorne Joseph received an assurance\nthat the whole of the Australian property had been capitalised and\nplaced in English investments; also, that the income was regularly\ndrawn and in some way disposed of; the manner of such disposal being\nkept private between old Mr. Percival and his client.\n\nIn the meantime family discussions in the Close had brought to Joseph's\nknowledge a circumstance regarding Kirkwood which interested him in a\nhigh degree. When talking of Sidney's character, it was natural that\nthe Peckovers should relate the story of his relations with Clara\nHewett.\n\n'Clara?' exclaimed Mr. Snowdon, as if struck by the name. 'Disappeared,\nhas she? What sort of a girl to look at?'\n\nClem was ready with a malicious description, whereto her husband\nattended very carefully. He mused over it, and proceeded to make\ninquiries about Clara's family. The Hewetts were now living in another\npart of Clerkenwell, but there was no hostility between them and the\nPeckovers. Was anything to be gained by keeping up intimacy with them?\nJoseph, after further musing, decided that it would be just as well to\ndo so; suppose Clem called upon them and presented the husband of whom\nshe was so proud? He would like, if possible, to hear a little more\nabout their daughter; an idea he had--never mind exactly what. So this\ncall was paid, and in a few weeks Joseph had established an\nacquaintance with John Hewett.\n\nSidney, on his part, had a difficulty in coming to definite conclusions\nrespecting Jane's father. Of course he was prejudiced against the man,\nand though himself too little acquainted with the facts of the case to\ndistinguish Joseph's motives, he felt that the middle-aged prodigal's\nreturn was anything but a fortunate event for Michael and his\ngranddaughter. The secret marriage with Clem was not likely, in were\nnot lacking grounds for hesitation in refusing to accept any case, to\nhave a respectable significance. True, there Joseph's account of\nhimself. He had a fund of natural amiability; he had a good provision\nof intellect; his talk was at times very persuasive and much like that\nof one who has been brought to a passable degree of honesty by the slow\ndevelopment of his better instincts. But his face was against him; the\nworn, sallow features, the eyes which so obviously made a struggle to\nlook with frankness, the vicious lower lip, awoke suspicion and told\ntales of base experience such as leaves its stamp upon a man for ever.\nAll the more repugnant was this face to Sidney because it presented, in\ncertain aspects, an undeniable resemblance to Jane's; impossible to say\nwhich feature put forth this claim of kindred, but the impression was\nthere, and it made Sidney turn away his eyes in disgust as often as he\nperceived it. He strove, however, to behave with friendliness, for it\nwas Michael's desire that he should do so. That Joseph was using every\nopportunity of prying into his thoughts, of learning the details of his\nhistory, he soon became perfectly conscious; but he knew of nothing\nthat he need conceal.\n\nIt was impossible that Sidney should not have reflected many a time on\nMichael Snowdon's position, and have been moved to curiosity by hints\nof the mysterious when he thought of his friends in Hanover Street. As\nit happened, he never saw those newspaper advertisements addressed to\nJoseph, and his speculation had nothing whatever to support it save the\nvery few allusions to the past which Michael had permitted himself in\nthe course of talk. Plainly the old man had means sufficient for his\nsupport, end in all likelihood this independence was connected with his\nvisit to Australia; but no act or word of Michael's had ever suggested\nthat he possessed more than a very modest competency. It was not,\nindeed, the circumstances, so much as the character and views, of his\nfriend that set Kirkwood pondering. He did not yet know Michael\nSnowdon; of that he was convinced. He had not fathomed his mind, got at\nthe prime motive of his being. Moreover, he felt that the old man was\nwaiting for some moment, or some event, to make revelation of himself.\nSince Joseph's appearance, it had become more noticeable than ever that\nSnowdon suffered from some agitation of the mind; Sidney had met his\neyes fixed upon him in a painful interrogation, and seemed to discern\nthe importunity of a desire that was refused utterance. His own\ncondition was affected by sympathy with this restlessness, and he could\nnot overcome the feeling that some decisive change was at hand for him.\nThough nothing positive justified the idea, he began to connect this\nanticipation of change with the holiday that was approaching, the week\nto be spent in Essex at the end of July. It had been his fear that\nJoseph's presence might affect these arrangements, but Michael was\nevidently resolved to allow nothing of the kind. One evening, a\nfortnight before the day agreed upon for leaving town, and when Joseph\nhad made a call in Hanover Street, the old man took occasion to speak\nof the matter. Joseph accepted the information with his usual pliancy.\n\n'I only wish my wife and me could join you,' he remarked. 'But it\nwouldn't do to take a holiday so soon after settling to business.\nBetter luck for me next year, father, let's hope.'\n\nThat he had settled to business was a fact of which Joseph made so much\njust now that one would have been tempted to suppose it almost a new\nexperience for him. His engagement, he declared, was with a firm of\nadvertising agents in the City; nothing to boast of, unfortunately, and\nremunerative only in the way of commission; but he saw his way to\nbetter things.\n\n'Jane, my girl,' he continued, averting his eyes as if in emotion, 'I\ndon't know how you and me are going to show our gratitude for all this\nkindness, I'm sure. I hope you haven't got so used to it that you think\nthere's no need to thank your grandfather?'\n\nThe girl and the old man exchanged a look. Joseph sighed, and began to\nspeak of another subject in a tone of cheery martyrdom.\n\nJane herself had not been quite so joyous as was her wont since the\noccurrence that caused her to take a new view of her position in the\nworld. She understood that her grandfather regarded the change very\ngravely, and in her own heart awoke all manner of tremulous\napprehensions when she tried to look onward a little to the\nuncertainties of the future. Forecasts had not hitherto troubled her;\nthe present was so rich in satisfactions that she could follow the bent\nof her nature and live with no anxiety concerning the unknown. It was a\ngreat relief to her to be assured that the long-standing plans for the\nholiday would suffer no change. The last week was a time of impatience,\nresolutely suppressed. On the Saturday afternoon Sidney was to meet\nthem at Liverpool Street. Would anything happen these last few\ndays--this last day--this last hour? No; all three stood together on\nthe platform, and their holiday had already begun.\n\nOver the pest-stricken regions of East London, sweltering in sunshine\nwhich served only to reveal the intimacies of abomination; across miles\nof a city of the damned, such as thought never conceived before this\nage of ours; above streets swarming with a nameless populace, cruelly\nexposed by the unwonted light of heaven; stopping at stations which it\ncrushes the heart to think should be the destination of any mortal; the\ntrain made its way at length beyond the outmost limits of dread, and\nentered upon a land of level meadows, of hedges and trees, of crops and\ncattle. Michael Snowdon was anxious that Jane should not regard with\nthe carelessness of familiarity those desolate tracts from which they\nwere escaping. In Bethnal Green he directed her attention with a\nwhispered word to the view from each window, and Jane had learnt well\nto understand him. But, the lesson over, it was none of his purpose to\nspoil her natural mood of holiday. Sidney sat opposite her, and as\noften as their eyes met a smile of contentment answered on either's\nface.\n\nThey alighted at Chelmsford, and were met by the farmer in whose house\nthey were going to lodge, a stolid, good-natured fellow named\nPammenter, with red, leathery cheeks, and a corkscrew curl of black\nhair coming forward on each temple. His trap was waiting, and in a few\nminutes they started on the drive to Danbury. The distance is about\nfive miles, and, until Danbury Hill is reached, the countryside has no\npoint of interest to distinguish it from any other representative bit\nof rural Essex. It is merely one of those quiet corners of flat, homely\nEngland, where man and beast seem on good terms with each other, where\nall green things grow in abundance, where from of old tilth and\npasture-land are humbly observant of seasons and alternations, where\nthe brown roads are familiar only with the tread of the labourer, with\nthe light wheel of the farmer's gig, or the rumbling of the solid warn.\nBy the roadside you pass occasionally a mantled pool, where perchance\nducks or geese are enjoying themselves; and at times there is a\npleasant glimpse of farm-yard, with stacks and barns and stables. All\nthings as simple as could be, but beautiful on this summer afternoon,\nand priceless when one has come forth from the streets of Clerkenwell.\n\nFarmer Pammenter was talkative, and his honest chest-voice sounded\npleasantly; but the matter of his discourse might have been more\ncheerful. Here, as elsewhere, the evil of the times was pressing upon\nmen and disheartening them from labour. Farms lying barren, ill-will\nbetween proprietor and tenant, between tenant and hind, departure of\nthe tillers of the soil to rot in towns that have no need of them--of\nsuch things did honest Pammenter speak, with many a sturdy malediction\nof landlords and land-laws, whereat Sidney smiled, not unsympathetic.\n\nDanbury Hill, rising thick-wooded to the village church, which is\nvisible for miles around, with stretches of heath about its lower\nslopes, with its far prospects over the sunny country, was the pleasant\nend of a pleasant drive. Mrs. Pammenter and her children (seven of\nthem, unhappily) gave the party a rough, warm-hearted welcome. Ha! how\ngood it was to smell the rooms through which the pure air breathed\nfreely! All the front of the house was draped with purple clematis; in\nthe garden were sun-flowers and hollyhocks and lowly plants\ninnumerable; on the red and lichened tiles pigeons were cooing\nthemselves into a doze; the horse's hoofs rang with a pleasant\nclearness on the stones as he was led to his cool stable. Her heart\nthrobbing with excess of delight, Jane pushed back the diamond-paned\ncasement of her bedroom, the same room she had occupied last year and\nthe year before, and buried her face in clematis. Then the tea that\nMrs. Pammenter had made ready;--how delicious everything tasted! how\nwhite the cloth was! how fragrant the cut flowers in the brown jug!\n\nBut Michael had found the journey a greater tax upon his strength than\nhe anticipated. Whilst Sidney and Jane talked merrily over the\ntea-table the old man was thinking. 'Another year they will come\nwithout me,' and he smiled just to hide his thoughts. In the evening he\nsmoked his pipe on a garden-seat, for the most part silent, and at\nsunset he was glad to go up to his chamber.\n\nJane was renewing her friendship with the Pammenters' eldest girl, an\napple-checked, red-haired, ungraceful, but good-natured lass of\nsixteen. Their voices sounded from all parts of the garden and the\nfarm-yard, Jane's clear-throated laugh contrasting with the rougher\nutterance of her companion. After supper, in the falling of the dusk,\nSidney strolled away from the gossiping circle within-doors, and found\na corner of the garden whence there was a view of wooded hillside\nagainst the late glow of the heavens. Presently he heard footsteps, and\nthrough the leafage of a tree that shadowed him he saw Jane looking\nthis way and that, as if she sought some one. Her dress was a light\ncalico, and she held in her hand a rough garden hat, the property of\nMiss Pammenter. Sidney regarded her for some moments, then called her\nby name. She could not see him at first, and looked about anxiously. He\nmoved a branch of the tree and again called her; whereupon she ran\nforward.\n\n'I thought perhaps you'd gone up the hill,' she said, resting her arms\non the wall by which he was standing.\n\nThen they kept silence, enjoying the sweetness of the hour.\nDifferently, it is true; for Kirkwood's natural sensitiveness had been\ndeveloped and refined by studies of which Jane had no conception.\nImperfect as his instruction remained, the sources of spiritual\nenjoyment were open to him, and with all his feeling there blended that\nreflective bitterness which is the sad privilege of such as he. Jane's\ndelight was as simple as the language in which she was wont to express\nherself. She felt infinitely more than Pennyloaf, for instance, would\nhave done under the circumstances; but her joy consisted, in the main,\nof a satisfaction of pure instincts and a deep sense of gratitude to\nthose who made her life what it was. She could as little have\nunderstood Sidney's mind at this moment as she could have given an\nanalytic account of her own sensations. For all that, the two were in\nprofound sympathy; how different soever the ways in which they were\naffected, the result, as they stood side by side, was identical in the\nhearts of both.\n\nSidney began to speak of Michael Snowdon, keeping his voice low, as if\nin fear of breaking those subtle harmonies wherewith the night\ndescended.\n\n'We must be careful not to over-tire him, He looked very pale when he\nwent upstairs. I've thought lately that he must suffer more than he\ntells us.'\n\n'Yes, I'm afraid he often does,' Jane assented, as if relieved to speak\nof it. 'Yet he always says it's nothing to trouble about, nothing but\nwhat is natural at his age. He's altered a great deal since father\ncame,' she added, regarding him diffidently.\n\n'I hope it isn't because he thinks your father may be wanting to take\nyou away?'\n\n'Oh, it can't be that! Oh, he knows I wouldn't leave him! Mr. Kirkwood,\nyou don't think my father will give us any trouble?'\n\nShe revealed an anxiety which delicacy of feeling had hitherto\nprevented her expressing. Sidney at once spoke reassuringly, though he\nhad in fact no little suspicion of Joseph Snowdon's tactics.\n\n'It's my grandfather that I ought to think most of,' pursued Jane\nearnestly. 'I can't feel to my father as I do to _him_. What should I\nhave been now if--'\n\nSomething caused her to leave the speech unfinished, and for a few\nmoments there was silence. From the ground exhaled a sweet fresh odour,\nsoothing to the senses, and at times a breath of air brought subtler\nperfume from the alleys of the garden. In the branches above them\nrustled a bird's wing. At a distance on the country road sounded the\ntrotting of a horse.\n\n'I feel ashamed and angry with myself,' said Sidney, in a tone of\nemotion, 'when I think now of t hose times. I might have done\nsomething, Jane. I had no right to know what you were suffering and\njust go by as if it didn't matter!'\n\n'Oh, but you didn't!' came eagerly from the girl's lips. 'You've\nforgotten, but I can't. You were very kind to me--you helped me more\nthan you can think--you never saw me without speaking kindly. Don't you\nremember that night when I came to fetch you from the workshop, and you\ntook off your coat and put it over me, because it was cold and raining?'\n\n'Jane, what a long, long time ago that seems!'\n\n'As long as I live I shall never forget it--never! You were the only\nfriend I had then.'\n\n'No; there was some one else who took thought for you,' said Sidney,\nregarding her gravely.\n\nJane met his look for an instant--they could just read each other's\nfeatures in the pale light--then dropped her eyes.\n\n'I don't think you've forgotten that either,' he added, in the same\nunusual voice.\n\n'No,' said Jane, below her breath.\n\n'Say who it is I mean.'\n\n'You mean Miss Hewett,' was the reply, after a troubled moment.\n\n'I wanted you to say her name. You remember one evening not long ago,\nwhen your grandfather was away? I had the same wish then. Why shouldn't\nwe speak of her? She was a friend to you when you needed one badly, and\nit's right that you should remember her with gratitude. I think of her\njust like we do of people that are dead.'\n\nJane stood with one hand on the low wall, half-turned to him, but her\nface bent downwards. Regarding her for what seemed a long time, Sidney\nfelt as though the fragrance of the earth and the flowers were mingling\nwith his blood and confusing him with emotions. At the same his tongue\nwas paralysed. Frequently of late he had known a timidity in Jane's\npresence, which prevented him from meeting her eyes, and now this\ntremor came upon him with painful intensity. He knew to what his last\nwords had tended; it was with consciousness of a distinct purpose that\nhe had led the conversation to Clara; but now he was powerless to speak\nthe words his heart prompted. Of a sudden he experienced a kind of\nshame, the result of comparison between himself and the simple girl who\nstood before him; she was so young, and the memory of passions from\nwhich he had suffered years ago affected him with a sense of\nunworthiness, almost of impurity. Jane had come to be his ideal of\nmaidenhood, but till this moment he had not understood the full\nsignificance of the feeling with which he regarded her. He could not\ntransform with a word their relations to each other. The temptation of\nthe hour had hurried him towards an end which he must approach with\nmore thought, more preparation of himself.\n\nIt was scarcely for ten heart-beats. Then Jane raised her eyes and said\nin a voice that trembled:\n\n'I've often wished I could see her again, and thank her for her\nkindness that night.'\n\n'That will help me to think with less pain of things that are long\nsince over and done with,' Sidney replied, forcing himself to speak\nfirmly. 'We can't alter the past, Jane, but we can try to remember only\nthe best part of it. You, I hope, very seldom look back at all.'\n\n'Grandfather wishes me never to forget it. He often says that.'\n\n'Does he? I think I understand.'\n\nJane drew down a branch and laid the broad cool leaves against her\ncheek; releasing it, she moved in the direction of the house. Her\ncompanion followed with slow step, his head bent. Before they came to\nthe door Jane drew his attention to a bat that was sweeping duskily\nabove their heads; she began to speak with her wonted cheerfulness.\n\n'How I should like Pennyloaf to be here! I wonder what she'd think of\nit?'\n\nAt the door they bade each other good night. Sidney took yet a few\nturns in the garden before entering. But that it would have seemed to\nthe Pammenters a crazy proceeding, he would have gladly struck away\nover the fields and walked for hours.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nA VISION OF NOBLE THINGS\n\nHe slept but for an hour or two, and even then with such disturbance of\nfitful dreams that he could not be said to rest. At the earliest sound\nof movements in the house he rose and went out into the morning air.\nThere had fallen a heavy shower just after sunrise, and the glory of\nthe east was still partly veiled with uncertain clouds. Heedless of\nweather-signs, Sidney strode away at a great pace, urged by his\nungovernable thoughts. His state was that miserable one in which a man\nrepeats for the thousandth time something he has said, and torments\nhimself with devising possible and impossible interpretations thereof.\nThrough the night he had done nothing but imagine what significance\nJane might have attached to his words about Clara Hewett. Why had he\nspoken of Clara at all? One moment he understood his reasons, and\napproved them; the next he was at a loss to account for such needless\nrevival of a miserable story. How had Jane interpreted him? And was it\nright or wrong to have paused when on the point of confessing that he\nloved her?\n\nRain caught him at a distance from home, and he returned to breakfast\nin rather a cheerless plight. He found that Michael was not feeling\nquite himself, and would not rise till midday. Jane had a look of\nanxiety, and he fancied she behaved to him with a constraint hitherto\nunknown. The fancy was dispelled, however, when, later in the morning,\nshe persuaded him to bring out his sketch-book, and suggested points of\nview for a drawing of the farm that had been promised to Mr. Pammenter\nHimself unable to recover the tone of calm intimacy which till\nyesterday had been natural between them, Sidney found himself studying\nthe girl, seeking to surprise some proof that she too was no longer the\nsame, and only affected this unconsciousness of change. There was,\nperhaps, a little less readiness in her eyes to meet his, but she\ntalked as naturally as ever, and the spontaneousness of her good-humour\nwas assuredly not feigned.\n\nOn Monday the farmer had business in Maldon. Occasionally when he drove\nover to that town he took one or other of his children with him to\nvisit a relative, and to-day he proposed that Jane should be of the\nparty. They started after an early dinner. Michael and Sidney stood\ntogether in the road, watching the vehicle as it rolled away; then they\nwalked in silence to a familiar spot where they could sit in shadow.\nSidney was glad of Jane's departure for the afternoon. He found it\nimpossible to escape the restlessness into which he had fallen, and was\nresolved to seek relief by opening his mind to the old man. There could\nbe little doubt that Michael already understood his thoughts, and no\nbetter opportunity for such a conversation was likely to present\nitself. When they had been seated for a minute or two, neither\nspeaking, Sidney turned to his companion with a grave look. At the same\ninstant Michael also had raised his eyes and seemed on the point of\nsaying something of importance. They regarded each other. The old man's\nface was set in an expression of profound feeling, and his lips moved\ntremulously before words rose to them.\n\n'What were you going to say, Sidney?' he asked, reading the other's\nfeatures.\n\n'Something which I hope won't be displeasing to you. I was going to\nspeak of Jane. Since she has been living with you she has grown from a\nchild to a woman. When I was talking with her in the garden on Saturday\nnight I felt this change more distinctly than I had ever done before. I\nunderstood that it had made a change in myself. I love her, Mr.\nSnowdon, and it's my dearest hope that she may come to feel the same\nfor me.'\n\nMichael was more agitated than the speaker; he raised a hand to his\nforehead and closed his eyes as if the light pained them. But the smile\nwith which he speedily answered Sidney's look of trouble was full of\nreassurance.\n\n'You couldn't have said anything that would give me more pleasure,' he\nreplied, just above his breath. 'Does she know it? Did you speak to\nher?'\n\n'We were talking of years ago, and I mentioned Clara Hewett. I said\nthat I had forgotten all about her except that she'd befriended Jane.\nBut nothing more than that. I couldn't say what I was feeling just\nthen. Partly I thought that it was right to speak to you first; and\nthen--it seemed to me almost as if I should be treating her unfairly.\nI'm so much older--she knows that it isn't the first time I--and she's\nalways thought of me just as a friend.'\n\n'So much older?' repeated Michael, with a grave smile. 'Why, you're\nboth children to my sight. Wait and let me think a bit, Sidney. I too\nhave something I want to say. I'm glad you've spoken this afternoon,\nwhen there's time for us to talk. Just wait a few minutes, and let me\nthink.'\n\nSidney had as good as forgotten that there was anything unusual in his\nfriend's circumstances; this last day or two he had thought of nothing\nbut Jane and his love for her. Now he recalled the\nanticipation--originating he scarcely knew how--that some kind of\ndisclosure would before long be made to him. The trouble of' his mind\nwas heightened; he waited with all but dread for the next words.\n\n'I think I've told you,' Michael resumed at length, steadying his\nvoice, 'that Joseph is my youngest son, and that I had three others.\nThree others: Michael, Edward, and Robert--all dead. Edward died when\nhe was a boy of fifteen; Robert was killed on the railway--he was a\nporter--at three-and-twenty. The eldest went out to Australia; he took\na wife there, and had one child; the wife died when they'd been married\na year or two, and Michael and his boy were drowned, both together. I\nwas living with them at the time, as you know. But what I've never\nspoken of' Sidney, is that my son had made his fortune. He left a deal\nof land, and many thousands of pounds, behind him. There was no finding\nany will; a lawyer in the nearest town, a man that had known him a long\ntime, said he felt sure there'd been no will made. So, as things were,\nthe law gave everything to his father.'\n\nHe related it with subdued voice, in a solemn and agitated tone. The\neffect of the news upon Sidney was a painful constriction of the heart,\na rush of confused thought, an involvement of all his perceptions in a\nsense of fear. The pallor of his cheeks and the pained parting of his\nlips bore witness to how little he was prepared for such a story.\n\n'I've begun with what ought by rights to have come last,' pursued\nMichael, after drawing a deep sigh. 'But it does me good to get it\ntold; it's been burdening me this long while. Now you must listen,\nSidney, whilst I show you why I've kept this a secret. I've no fear but\n_you_'ll understand me, though most people wouldn't. It's a secret from\neverybody except a lawyer in London, who does business for me; a\nright-hearted man he is, in most things, and I'm glad I met with him,\nbut he doesn't understand me as you will; he thinks I'm making a\nmistake. My son knows nothing about it; at least, it's my hope and\nbelief he doesn't. He told me he hadn't heard of his brother's death. I\nsay I hope he doesn't know; it isn't selfishness, that; I needn't tell\nyou. I've never for a minute thought of myself as a rich man, Sidney;\nI've never thought of the money as my own, never; and if Joseph proves\nhimself honest, I'm ready to give up to him the share of his brother's\nproperty that it seems to me ought to be rightly his, though the law\nfor some reason looks at it in a different way. I'm ready, but I must\nknow that he's an honest man; I must prove him first.'\n\nThe eagerness of his thought impelled him to repetitions and emphasis.\nHis voice fell upon a note of feebleness, and with an effort he\nrecovered the tone in which he had begun.\n\n'As soon as I knew that all this wealth had fallen to me I decided at\nonce to come back to England. What could I do out there? I decided to\ncome to England, but I couldn't see farther ahead than that. I sold all\nthe land; I had the business done for me by that lawyer I spoke of,\nthat had known my son, and he recommended me to a Mr. Percival in\nLondon. I came back, and I found little Jane, and then bit by bit I\nbegan to understand what my duty was. It got clear in my mind; I formed\na purpose, a plan, and it's as strong in me now as ever. Let me think\nagain for a little, Sidney. I want to make it as plain to you as it is\nto me. You'll understand me best if I go back and tell you more than I\nhave done yet about my life before I left England. Let me think a\nwhile.'\n\nHe was overcome with a fear that he might not be able to convey with\nsufficient force the design which had wholly possessed him. So painful\nwas the struggle in him between enthusiasm and a consciousness of\nfailing faculties, that Sidney grasped his hand and begged him to speak\nsimply, without effort.\n\n'Have no fear about my understanding you. We've talked a great deal\ntogether, and I know very well what your strongest motives are. Trust\nme to sympathise with you.'\n\n'I do! If I hadn't that trust, Sidney, I couldn't have felt the joy I\ndid when you spoke to me of my Jane. You'll help me to carry out my\nplan; you and Jane will; you and Jane! I've got to be such an old man\nall at once, as it seems, and I dursn't have waited much longer without\ntelling you what I had in my mind. See now, I'll go back to when I was\na boy, as far back as I can remember. You know I was born in\nClerkenwell, and I've told you a little now and then of the hard times\nI went through. My poor father and mother came out of the country,\nthinking to better themselves; instead of that, they found nothing but\ncold and hunger, and toil and moil. They were both dead by when I was\nbetween thirteen and fourteen. They died in the same winter--a cruel\nwinter. I used to go about begging bits of firewood from the\nneighbours. There was a man in our house who kept dogs, and I remember\nonce catching hold of a bit of dirty meat--I can't call it meat--that\none of them had gnawed and left on the stairs; and I ate it, as if I'd\nbeen a dog myself, I was that driven with hunger. Why, I feel the cold\nand the hunger at this minute! It was a cruel winter, that, and it left\nme alone. I had to get my own living as best I could.\n\n'No teaching. I was nineteen before I could read the signs over shops,\nor write my own name. Between nineteen and twenty I got all the\neducation I ever was to have, paying a man with what I could save out\nof my earnings. The blessing was I had health and strength, and with\nhard struggling I got into a regular employment. At five-and-twenty I\ncould earn my pound a week, pretty certain. When it got to five\nshillings more, I must needs have a wife to share it with me. My poor\ngirl came to live with me in a room in Hill Street.\n\nI've never spoken to you of her, but you shall hear it all now, cost me\nwhat it may in the telling. Of course she was out of a poor home, and\nshe'd known as well as me what it was to go cold and hungry. I\nsometimes think, Sidney, I can see a look of her in Jane's face--but\nshe was prettier than Jane; yes, yes, prettier than Jane. And to think\na man could treat a poor little thing like her the way I did!--you\ndon't know what sort of a man Michael Snowdon was then; no, you don't\nknow what I was then. You're not to think I ill-used her in the common\nway; I never raised my hand, thank God! and I never spoke a word a man\nshould be ashamed of. But I was a hard, self-willed, stubborn fool. How\nshe came to like me and to marry me, I don't know; we were so different\nin every way. Well, it was partly my nature and partly what I'd gone\nthrough; we hadn't been married more than a month or two when I began\nto find fault with her, and from that day on she could never please me.\nI earned five-and-twenty shillings a week, and I'd made up my mind that\nwe must save out of it. I wouldn't let _her_ work; no, what _she_ had\nto do was to keep the home on as little as possible, and always have\neverything clean and straight when I got back at night. But Jenny\nhadn't the same ideas about things as I had. She couldn't pinch and\npare, and our plans of saving came to nothing. It grew worse as the\nchildren were horn. The more need there was for carefulness, the more\nheedless Jenny seemed to get. And it was my fault, mine from beginning\nto end. Another man would have been gentle with her and showed her\nkindly when she was wrong, and have been thankful for the love she gave\nhim, whatever her faults. That wasn't my way. I got angry, and made her\nlife a burden to her. I must have things done exactly as I wished; if\nnot, there was no end to my fault-finding. And yet, if you'll believe\nit, I loved my wife as truly as man ever did. Jenny couldn't understand\nthat--and how should she? At last she began to deceive me in all sorts\nof little things; she got into debt with shop-people, she showed me\nfalse accounts, she pawned things without my knowing. Last of all, she\nbegan to drink. Our fourth child was born just at that time; Jenny had\na bad illness, and I believe it set her mind wrong. I lost all control\nof her, and she used to say if it wasn't for the children she'd go and\nleave me. One morning we quarrelled very badly, and I did as I'd\nthreatened to--I walked about the streets all the night that followed,\nnever coming home. I went to work next day, but at dinner-time I got\nfrightened and ran home just to speak a word. Little Mike, the eldest,\nwas playing on the stairs, and he said his mother was asleep. I went\ninto the room, and saw Jenny lying on the bed dressed. There was\nsomething queer in the way her arms were stretched out. When I got near\nI saw she was dead. She'd taken poison.\n\n'And it was I had killed her, just as much as if I'd put the poison to\nher lips. All because I thought myself such a wise fellow, because I'd\nresolved to live more prudently than other men of my kind did. I wanted\nto save money for the future--out of five-and-twenty shillings a week.\nMany and many a day I starved myself to try and make up for expenses of\nthe home. Sidney, you remember that man we once went to hear lecture,\nthe man that talked of nothing but the thriftlessness of the poor, and\nhow it was their own fault they suffered? I was very near telling you\nmy story when we came away that night. Why, look; I myself was just the\nkind of poor man that would have suited that lecturer. And what came of\nit? If I'd let my poor Jenny go her own way from the first, we should\nhave had hard times now and then, but there'd have been our love to\nhelp us, and we should have been happy enough. They talk about\nthriftiness, and it just means that poor people are expected to\npractise a self-denial that the rich can't even imagine, much less\ncarry out. You know now why this kind of talk always angers me.'\n\nMichael brooded for a few moments, his eyes straying sadly over the\nlandscape before him.\n\n'I was punished,' he continued, 'and in the fittest way. The two of my\nboys who showed most love for me, Edward and Robert, died young. The\neldest and youngest were a constant trouble to me. Michael was\nquick-tempered and self-willed, like myself; I took the wrong way with\nhim, just like I had with his mother, and there was no peace till he\nleft home. Joseph was still harder to deal with; but he's the only one\nleft alive, and there is no need to bring up things against him. With\nhim I wasn't to blame, unless I treated him too kindly and spoilt him.\nHe was my favourite, was Jo, and he repaid me cruelly. When he married,\nI only heard of it from other people; we'd been parted for a long time\nalready. And just about then I had a letter from Michael, asking me if\nI was willing to go out and live with him in Australia. I hadn't heard\nfrom him more than two or three times in twelve years, and when this\nletter came to me I was living in Sheffield; I'd been there about five\nyears. He wrote to say he was doing well, and that he didn't like to\nthink of me being left to spend my old age alone. It was a kind letter,\nand it warmed my heart. Lonely I was; as lonely and sorrowful a man as\nany in England. I wrote back to say that I'd come to him gladly if he\ncould promise to put me in the way of earning my own living. He agreed\nto that, and I left the old country, little thinking I should ever see\nit again. I didn't see Joseph before I went. All I knew of him was,\nthat he lived in Clerkenwell Close, married; and that was all I had to\nguide me when I tried to find him a few years after. I was bitter\nagainst him, and went without trying to say good-bye.\n\n'My son's fortune seems to have been made chiefly out of horse-dealing\nand what they call \"land-grabbing\"--buying sheep-runs over the heads of\nsquatters, to be bought out again at a high profit. Well, you know what\nmy opinion is of trading at the best, and as far as I could understand\nit, it was trading at about its worst that had filled Michael's\npockets. He'd had a partner for a time, and very ugly stories were told\nme about the man. However, Michael gave me as kind a welcome as his\nletter promised; prosperity had done him good, and he seemed only\nanxious to make up for the years of unkindness that had gone by. Had I\nbeen willing, I might have lived under his roof at my ease; but I held\nhim to his bargain, and worked like any other man who goes there\nwithout money. It's a comfort to me to think of those few years spent\nin quiet and goodwill with my eldest boy. His own lad would have given\ntrouble, I'm afraid, if he'd lived; Michael used to talk to me uneasily\nabout him, poor fellow! But they both came to their end before the\nworld had parted them.\n\n'If I'd been a young man, I dare say I should have felt different when\nthey told me how rich I was; it gave me no pleasure at first, and when\nI'd had time to think about it I only grew worried. I even thought once\nor twice of getting rid of the burden by giving all the money to a\nhospital in Sydney or Melbourne. But then I remembered that the poor in\nthe old country had more claim on me, and when I'd got used to the idea\nof being a wealthy man, I found myself recalling all sorts of fancies\nand wishes that used to come into my head when I was working hard for a\npoor living. It took some time to get all the lawyer's business\nfinished, and by when it was done I began to see a way before me. First\nof all I must find my son in England, and see if he needed help. I\nhadn't made any change in my way of living, and I came back from\nAustralia as a steerage passenger, wearing the same clothes that I'd\nworked in. The lawyer laughed at me, but I'm sure I should have laughed\nat myself if I'd dressed up as a gentleman and begun to play the fool\nin my old age. The money wasn't to be used in that way. I'd got my\nideas, and they grew clearer during the voyage home.\n\n'You know how I found Jane. Not long after, I put an advertisement in\nthe papers, asking my son, if he saw it, to communicate with Mr.\nPercival--that's the lawyer I was recommended to in London. There was\nno answer; Joseph was in America at that time. I hadn't much reason to\nlike Mrs. Peckover and her daughter, but I kept up acquaintance with\nthem because I thought they might hear of Jo some day. And after a\nwhile I sent Jane to learn a business. Do you know why I did that? Can\nyou think why I brought up the child as if I'd only had just enough to\nkeep us both, and never gave a sign that I could have made a rich lady\nof her?'\n\nIn asking the question, he bent forward and laid his hand on Sidney's\nshoulder. His eyes gleamed with that light which betrays the\nenthusiast, the idealist. As he approached the explanation to which his\nstory had tended, the signs of age and weakness disappeared before the\nintensity of his feeling. Sidney understood now why he had always been\nconscious of something in the man's mind that was not revealed to him,\nof a life-controlling purpose but vaguely indicated by the general\ntenor of Michael's opinions. The latter's fervour affected him, and he\nreplied with emotion:\n\n'You wish Jane to think of this money as you do yourself--not to regard\nit as wealth, but as the means of bringing help to the miserable.'\n\n'That is my thought, Sidney. It came to me in that form whilst I was\nsitting by her bed, when she was ill at Mrs. Peckover's. I knew nothing\nof her character then, and the idea I had might have come to nothing\nthrough her turning out untrustworthy. But I thought to myself: Suppose\nshe grows up to be a good woman--suppose I can teach her to look at\nthings in the same way as I do myself, train her to feel that no\nhappiness could be greater than the power to put an end to ever so\nlittle of the want and wretchedness about her--suppose when I die I\ncould have the certainty that all this money was going to be used for\nthe good of the poor by a woman who herself belonged to the poor? You\nunderstand me? It would have been easy enough to leave it among\ncharities in the ordinary way; but my idea went beyond that. I might\nhave had Jane schooled and fashioned into a lady, and still have hoped\nthat she would use the money well; but my idea went beyond _that_.\nThere's plenty of ladies nowadays taking an interest in the miserable,\nand spending their means unselfishly. What I hoped was to raise up for\nthe poor and the untaught a friend out of their own midst, some one who\nhad gone through all that they _suffer_, who was accustomed to earn her\nown living by the work of her hands as _they_ do, who had never thought\nherself their better, who saw the world as they see it and knew all\ntheir wants. A lady may do good, we know that; but she can't be the\nfriend of the poor as I understand it; there's too great a distance\nbetween her world and theirs. Can you picture to yourself how anxiously\nI've watched this child from the first day she came to live with me?\nI've scarcely had a thought but about her. I saw very soon that she had\ngood feelings, and I set myself to encourage them. I wanted her to be\nable to read and write, but there was no need of any more education\nthan that; it was the heart I cared about, not the mind. Besides, I had\nalways to keep saying to myself that perhaps, after all, she wouldn't\nturn out the kind of woman I wished, and in that case she mustn't be\nspoiled for an ordinary life. Sidney, it's this money that has made me\na weak old man when I might still have been as strong as many at fifty;\nthe care of it has worn me out; I haven't slept quietly since it came\ninto my hands. But the worst is over. I shan't be disappointed. Jane\nwill be the woman I've hoped for, and however soon my own life comes to\nan end, I shall die knowing that there's a true man by her side to help\nher to make my idea a reality.\n\n'I've mentioned Mr. Percival, the lawyer. He's an old man like myself,\nand we've had many a long talk together. About a year and a half ago I\ntold him what I've told you now. Since I came back to England he's been\nmanaging the money for me; he's paid me the little we needed, and the\nrest of the income has been used in charity by some people we could\ntrust. Well, Mr. Percival doesn't go with me in my plans for Jane. He\nthinks I'm making a mistake, that I ought to have had the child\neducated to fit her to live with rich people. It's no use; I can't get\nhim to feel what a grand thing it'll be for Jane to go about among her\nown people and help them as nobody ever could. He said to me not long\nago, \"And isn't the girl ever to have a husband?\" It's my hope that she\nwill, I told him. \"And do you suppose,\" he went on, \"that whoever\nmarries her will let her live in the way you talk of? Where are you\ngoing to find a working man that'll be content never to touch this\nmoney--to work on for his weekly wages, when he might be living at his\nease?\" And I told him that it wasn't as impossible as he thought. What\ndo you think, Sidney?'\n\nThe communication of a noble idea has the same effect upon the brains\nof certain men--of one, let us say, in every hundred thousand--as a\nwine that exalts and enraptures. As Sidney listened to the old man\ntelling of his wondrous vision, he became possessed with ardour such as\nhe had known but once or twice in his life. Idealism such as Michael\nSnowdon had developed in these latter years is a form of genius; given\nthe susceptible hearer, it dazzles, inspires, raises to heroic contempt\nof the facts of life. Had this story been related to him of some\nunknown person, Sidney would have admired, but as one admires the nobly\nimpracticable; subject to the electric influence of a man who was great\nenough to conceive and direct his life by such a project, who could\nrepose so supreme a faith in those he loved, all the primitive\nnobleness of his character asserted itself, and he could accept with a\nthrobbing heart the superb challenge addressed to him.\n\n'If Jane can think me worthy to be her husband,' he replied, 'your\nfriend shall see that he has feared without cause.'\n\n'I knew it, Sidney; I knew it!' exclaimed the old man. 'How much\nyounger I feel now that I have shared this burden with you!'\n\n'And shall you now tell Jane?' the other inquired.\n\n'Not yet; not just yet. She is very young; we must wait a little. But\nthere can be no reason why you shouldn't speak to her--of yourself.'\n\nSidney was descending from the clouds. As the flush of his humanitarian\nenthusiasm passed away, and he thought of his personal relations to\nJane, a misgiving, a scruple began to make itself heard within him.\nWorldly and commonplace the thought, but--had he a right to ask the\ngirl to pledge herself to him under circumstances such as these? To be\nsure, it was not as if Jane were an heiress in the ordinary way; for\nall that, would it not be a proceeding of doubtful justice to woo her\nwhen as yet she was wholly ignorant of the most important item in her\nsituation? His sincerity was unassailable, but--suppose, in fact, he\nhad to judge the conduct of another man thus placed? Upon the heated\npulsing of his blood succeeded a coolness, almost a chill; he felt as\nthough he had been on the verge of a precipice, and had been warned to\ndraw back only just in time. Every second showed him more distinctly\nwhat his duty was. He experienced a sensation of thankfulness that he\nhad not spoken definitely on Saturday evening. His instinct had guided\nhim aright; Jane was still too young to be called upon solemnly to\ndecide her whole future.\n\n'That, too, had better wait, Mr. Snowdon,' he said, after a pause of a\nminute. 'I should like her to know everything before I speak to her in\nthat way. In a year it will be time enough.'\n\nMichael regarded him thoughtfully.\n\n'Perhaps you are right. I wish you knew Mr. Percival; but there is\ntime, there is time. He still thinks I shall be persuaded to alter my\nplans. That night you came to Hanover Street and found me away, he took\nme to see a lady who works among the poor in Clerkenwell; she knew me\nby name, because Mr. Percival had given her money from me to use, but\nwe'd never seen each other till then. He wants me to ask her opinion\nabout Jane.'\n\n'Has he spoken of her to the lady, do you think?'\n\n'Oh no!' replied the other, with perfect confidence. 'He has promised\nme to keep all that a secret as long as I wish. The lady--her name is\nMiss Lant--seemed all that my friend said she was, and perhaps Jane\nmight do well to make her acquaintance some day; but that mustn't be\ntill Jane knows and approves the purpose of my life and hers. The one\nthing that troubles me still, Sidney, is--her father. It's hard that I\ncan't be sure whether my son will be a help or a hindrance. I must\nwait, and try to know him better.'\n\nThe conversation had so wearied Michael, that in returning to the house\nhe had to lean on his companion's arm. Sidney was silent, and yielded,\nhe scarce knew why, to a mood of depression. When Jane returned from\nMaldon in the evening, and he heard her happy voice as the children ran\nout to welcome her, there was a heaviness at his heart. Perhaps it came\nonly of hope deferred.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nDEATH THE RECONCILER\n\nThere is no accounting for tastes. Sidney Kirkwood, spending his Sunday\nevening in a garden away there in the chaw-bacon regions of Essex,\nwhere it was so deadly quiet that you could hear the flutter of a\nbird's wing or the rustle of a leaf, not once only congratulated\nhimself on his good fortune; yet at that hour he might have stood, as\nso often, listening to the eloquence, the wit, the wisdom, that give\nproud distinction to the name of Clerkenwell Green. Towards sundown,\nthat modern Agora rang with the voices of orators, swarmed with\nlisteners, with disputants, with mockers, with indifferent loungers.\nThe circle closing about an agnostic lecturer intersected with one\ngathered for a prayer-meeting; the roar of an enthusiastic\ntotal-abstainer blended with the shriek of a Radical politician.\nInnumerable were the little groups which had broken away from the\nlarger ones to hold semi-private debate on matters which demanded calm\nconsideration and the finer intellect. From the doctrine of the Trinity\nto the question of cabbage _versus_ beef; from Neo-Malthusianism to the\ngrievance of compulsory vaccination; not a subject which modernism has\nthrown out to the multitude but here received its sufficient mauling.\nAbove the crowd floated wreaths of rank tobacco smoke.\n\nStraying from circle to circle might have been seen Mr. Joseph Snowdon,\nthe baldness of his crown hidden by a most respectable silk hat, on one\nhand a glove, in the other his walking-stick, a yellow waistcoat\nenhancing his appearance of dignity, a white necktie spotted with blue\nand a geranium in his button-hole correcting the suspicion of age\nsuggested by his countenance. As a listener to harangues of the most\nvarious tendency, Mr. Snowdon exhibited an impartial spirit; he smiled\noccasionally, but was never moved to any expression of stronger\nfeeling. His placid front revealed the philosopher.\n\nYet at length something stirred him to a more pronounced interest. He\nwas on the edge of a dense throng which had just been delighted by the\nrhetoric of a well-known Clerkenwell Radical; the topic under\ndiscussion was Bent, and the last speaker had, in truth, put before\nthem certain noteworthy views of the subject as it affected the poor of\nLondon. What attracted Mr. Snowdon's attention was the voice of the\nspeaker who next rose. Pressing a little nearer, he got a glimpse of a\nlean, haggard, grey-headed man, shabbily dressed, no bad example of a\nsufferer from the hardships he was beginning to denounce. 'That's old\nHewett,' remarked somebody close by. 'He's the feller to let 'em 'ave\nit!' Yes, it was John Hewett, much older, much more broken, yet much\nfiercer than when we last saw him. Though it was evident that he spoke\noften at these meetings, he had no command of his voice and no\ncoherence of style; after the first few words he seemed to be overcome\nby rage that was little short of frenzy. Inarticulate screams and yells\ninterrupted the torrent of his invective; he raised both hands above\nhis head and clenched them in a gesture of frantic passion; his visage\nwas frightfully distorted, and in a few minutes there actually fell\ndrops of blood from his bitten lip. Rent!--it was a subject on which\nthe poor fellow could speak to some purpose. What was the root of the\ndifficulty a London workman found in making both ends meet? Wasn't it\nthat accursed law by which the owner of property can make him pay a\nhalf, and often more, of his earnings or permission to put his wife and\nchildren under a roof? And what sort of dwellings were they, these in\nwhich the men who made the wealth of the country were born and lived\nand died? What would happen to the landlords of Clerkenwell if they got\ntheir due? Ay, what _shall_ happen, my boys, and that before so very\nlong? For fifteen or twenty minutes John expended his fury, until, in\nfact, he was speechless. It was terrible to look at him when at length\nhe made his way out of the crowd; his face was livid, his eyes\nbloodshot, a red slaver covered his lips and beard; you might have\ntaken him for a drunken man, so feebly did his limbs support him, so\nshattered was he by the fit through which he had passed.\n\nJoseph followed him, and presently walked along at his side.\n\n'That was about as good a speech as I've heard for a long time, Mr.\nHewett,' he began by observing. 'I like to hear a man speak as if he\nmeant it.'\n\nJohn looked up with a leaden, rheumy eye, but the compliment pleased\nhim, and in a moment he smiled vacantly.\n\n'I haven't said my last word yet,' he replied, with difficulty making\nhimself audible through his hoarseness.\n\n'It takes it out of you, I'm afraid. Suppose we have a drop of\nsomething at the corner here?'\n\n'I don't mind, Mr. Snowdon. I thought of looking in at my club for a\nquarter of an hour; perhaps you'd come round with me afterwards?'\n\nThey drank at the public-house, then Hewett led the way by back streets\nto the quarters of the club of which he had been for many years a\nmember. The locality was not cheerful, and the house itself stood in\nmuch need of repair. As they entered, John requested his companion to\nsign his name in the visitors' book; Mr. Snowdon did so with a\nflourish. They ascended to the first floor and passed into a room where\nlittle could be seen but the gas-jets, and those dimly, owing to the\nfume of pipes. The rattle of bones, the strumming of a banjo, and a\nvoice raised at intervals in a kind of whoop announced that a nigger\nentertainment was in progress. Recreation of this kind is not uncommon\non Sunday evening at the workmen's clubs; you will find it announced in\nthe remarkable list of lectures, &c., printed in certain Sunday\nnewspapers. The company which was exerting itself in the present\ninstance had at all events an appreciative audience; laughter and\napplause broke forth very frequently.\n\n'I'd forgot it was this kind o' thing to-night,' said Hewett, when he\ncould discover no vacant seat. 'Do you care about it? No more don't I;\nlet's go down into the readin'-room.'\n\nDownstairs they established themselves at their ease. John ordered two\nhalf-pints of ale--the club supplied refreshment for the body as well\nas for the mind--and presently he was more himself.\n\n'How's your wife?' inquired Joseph. 'Better, I hope?'\n\n'I wish I could say so,' answered the other, shaking his head. 'She\nhasn't been up since Thursday. She's bad, poor woman! she's bad.'\n\nJoseph murmured his sympathy between two draughts of ale.\n\n'Seen young Kirkwood lately?' Hewett asked, averting his eyes and\nassuming a tone of half-absent indifference.\n\n'He's gone away for his holiday; gone into Essex somewhere. When was it\nhe was speaking of you? Why, one day last week, to be sure.'\n\n'Speakin' about me, eh?' said John, turning his glass round and round\non the table. And as the other remained silent, he added, 'You can tell\nhim, if you like, that my wife's been very bad for a long time. Him an'\nme don't have nothing to say to each other--but you can tell him that,\nif you like.'\n\n'So I will,' replied Mr. Snowdon, nodding with a confidential air.\n\nHe had noticed from the beginning of his acquaintance with Hewett that\nthe latter showed no disinclination to receive news of Kirkwood. As\nClem's husband, Joseph was understood to be perfectly aware of the\nstate of things between the Hewetts and their former friend, and in a\nrecent conversation with Mrs. Hewett he had assured himself that she,\nat all events, would be glad if the estrangement could come to an end.\nFor reasons of his own, Joseph gave narrow attention to these signs.\n\nThe talk was turning to other matters, when a man who had just entered\nthe room and stood looking about him with an uneasy expression caught\nsight of Hewett and approached him. He was middle-aged, coarse of\nfeature, clad in the creased black which a certain type of artisan\nwears on Sunday.\n\n'I'd like a word with you, John,' he said, 'if your friend'll excuse.'\n\nHewett rose from the table, and they walked together to an unoccupied\nspot.\n\n'Have you heard any talk about the Burial Club?' inquired the man, in a\nlow voice of suspicion, knitting his eyebrows.\n\n'Heard anything? No. What?'\n\n'Why, Dick Smales says he can't get the money for his boy, as died last\nweek.'\n\n'Can't get it? Why not?'\n\n'That's just what I want to know. Some o' the chaps is talkin' about it\nupstairs. M'Cosh ain't been seen for four or five days. Somebody had\nnews as he was ill in bed, and now there's no findin' him. I've got a\nnotion there's something wrong, my boy.'\n\nHewett's eyes grew large and the muscles of his mouth contracted.\n\n'Where's Jenkins?' he asked abruptly. 'I suppose he can explain it?'\n\n'No, by God, he can't! He won't say nothing, but he's been runnin'\nabout all yesterday and to-day, lookin' precious queer.'\n\nWithout paying any further attention to Snowdon, John left the room\nwith his companion, and they went upstairs. Most of the men present\nwere members of the Burial Club in question, an institution of some\nfifteen years' standing and in connection with the club which met here\nfor social and political purposes; they were in the habit, like John\nHewett, of depositing their coppers weekly, thus insuring themselves or\ntheir relatives for a sum payable at death. The rumour that something\nwas wrong, that the secretary M'Cosh could not be found, began to\ncreate a disturbance; presently the nigger entertainment came to an\nend, and the Burial Club was the sole topic of conversation.\n\nOn the morrow it was an ascertained fact that one of the catastrophes\nwhich occasionally befall the provident among wage-earners had come to\npass. Investigation showed that for a long time there had been\ncarelessness and mismanagement of funds, and that fraud had completed\nthe disaster. M'Cosh was wanted by the police.\n\nTo John Hewett the blow was a terrible one. In spite of his poverty, he\nhad never fallen behind with those weekly payments. The thing he\ndreaded supremely was, that his wife or one of the children should die\nand he be unable to provide a decent burial. At the death of the last\nchild born to him the club had of course paid, and the confidence he\nfelt in it for the future was a sensible support under the many\nmiseries of his life, a support of which no idea can be formed by one\nwho has never foreseen the possibility of those dear to him being\ncarried to a pauper's grave. It was a touching fact that he still kept\nup the payment for Clara; who could say but his daughter might yet come\nback to him to die? To know that he had lost that one stronghold\nagainst fate was a stroke that left him scarcely strength to go about\nhis daily work.\n\nAnd he could not breathe a word of it to his wife. Oh that better curse\nof poverty, which puts corrupting poison into the wounds inflicted by\nnature, which outrages the spirit's tenderness, which profanes with\nunutterable defilement the secret places of the mourning heart! He\ncould not, durst not, speak a word of this misery to her whose\ngratitude and love had resisted every trial, who had shared\nuncomplainingly all the evil of his lot, and had borne with supreme\npatience those added sufferings of which he had no conception. For she\nlay on her deathbed. The doctor told him so on the very day when he\nlearnt that it would be out of his power to discharge the fitting\npieties at her grave. So far from looking to her for sympathy, it\nbehoved him to keep from her as much as a suspicion of what had\nhappened.\n\nTheir home at this time was a kitchen in King's Cross Road. The eldest\nchild, Amy, was now between ten and eleven; Annie was nine; Tom seven.\nThese, of course, went to school every day, and were being taught to\nappreciate the woefulness of their inheritance. Amy was, on the whole,\na good girl; she could make purchases as well as her mother, and when\nin the mood, look carefully after her little brother and sister; but\nalready she had begun to display restiveness under the hard discipline\nto which the domestic poverty subjected her. Once she had played truant\nfrom school, and told falsehoods to the teachers to explain her\nabsence. It was discovered that she had been tempted by other girls to\ngo and see the Lord Mayor's show. Annie and Tom threatened to be\ntroublesome when they got a little older; the boy could not be taught\nto speak the truth, and his sister was constantly committing petty\nthefts of jam, sugar, even coppers; and during the past year their\nmother was seldom able to exert herself in correcting these faults.\nOnly by dint of struggle which cost her agonies could she discharge the\nsimplest duties of home. She made a brave fight against disease and\npenury and incessant dread of the coming day, but month after month her\nstrength failed. Now at length she tried vainly to leave her bed. The\nlast reserve of energy was exhausted, and the end near.\n\nAfter her death, what then? Through the nights of this week after her\ndoom had been spoken she lay questioning the future. She knew that but\nfor her unremitting efforts Hewett would have yielded to the despair of\na drunkard; the crucial moment was when he found himself forsaken by\nhis daughter, and no one but this poor woman could know what force of\nloving will, what entreaties, what tears, had drawn him back a little\nway from the edge of the gulf. Throughout his life until that day of\nClara's disappearance he had seemed in no danger from the deadliest\nenemy of the poor; one taste of the oblivion that could be bought at\nany street-corner, and it was as though drinking had been a recognised\nhabit with him. A year, two years, and he still drank himself into\nforgetfulness as often as his mental suffering waxed unendurable. On\nthe morrow of every such crime--interpret the word rightly--he hated\nhimself for his cruelty to that pale sufferer whose reproaches were\nonly the utterances of love. The third year saw an improvement, whether\nowing to conscious self-control or to the fact that time was blunting\nhis affliction. Instead of the public-house, he frequented all places\nwhere the woes of the nether world found fierce expression. He became a\nconstant speaker at the meetings on Clerkenwell Green and at the\nRadical clubs. The effect upon him of this excitement was evil enough,\nyet not so evil as the malady of drink. Mrs. Hewett was thankful for\nthe alternative. But when she was no longer at his side--what then?\n\nHis employment was irregular, but for the most part at cabinet-making.\nThe workshop where he was generally to be found was owned by two\nbrothers, who invariably spent the first half of each week in steady\ndrinking. Their money gone, they set to work and made articles of\nfurniture, which on Saturday they took round to the shops of small\ndealers and sold for what they could get. When once they took up their\ntools, these men worked with incredible persistency, and they expected\nthe same exertion from those they employed. 'I wouldn't give a ---- for\nthe chap as can't do his six-and-thirty hours at the bench!' remarked\none of them on the occasion of a workman falling into a fainting-fit,\ncaused by utter exhaustion. Hewett was anything but strong, and he\nearned little.\n\nLate on Saturday afternoon, Sidney Kirkwood and his friends were back\nin London. As he drew near to Tysoe Street, carrying the bag which was\nall the luggage he had needed, Sidney by chance encountered Joseph\nSnowdon, who, after inquiring about his relatives, said that he had\njust come from visiting the Hewetts. Mrs. Hewett was very ill indeed;\nand it was scarcely to be expected she would live more than a few days.\n\n'You mean that?' exclaimed Kirkwood, upon whom, after his week of\nholiday and of mental experiences which seemed to have changed the face\nof the world for him, this sudden announcement came with a painful\nshock, reviving all the miserable past. 'She is dying?'\n\n'There's no doubt of it.'\n\nAnd Joseph added his belief that John Hewett would certainly not take\nit ill if the other went there before it was too late.\n\nSidney had no appetite now for the meal he would have purchased on\nreaching home. A profound pity for the poor woman who had given him so\nmany proofs of her affection made his heart heavy almost to tears. The\nperplexities of the present vanished in a revival of old tenderness, of\nbygone sympathies and sorrows. He could not doubt but that it was his\nduty to go to his former friends at a time such as this. Perhaps, if he\nhad overcome his pride, he might have sooner brought the estrangement\nto an end.\n\nHe did not know, and had forgotten to ask of Snowdon, the number of the\nhouse in King's Cross Road where the Hewetts lived. He could find it,\nhowever, by visiting Pennyloaf. Conquering his hesitation, he was on\nthe point of going forth, when his landlady came up and told him that a\nyoung girl wished to see him. It was Amy Hewett, and her face told him\non what errand she had come.\n\n'Mr. Kirkwood,' she began, looking up with embarrassment, for he was\nall but a stranger to her now, 'mother wants to know if you'd come and\nsee her. She's very bad; they're afraid she's--'\n\nThe word was choked. Amy had been crying, and the tears again rose to\nher eyes.\n\n'I was just coming,' Sidney answered, as he took her hand and pressed\nit kindly.\n\nThey crossed Wilmington Square and descended by the streets that slope\nto Coldbath Fields Prison. The cellar in which John Hewett and his\nfamily were housed was underneath a milk-shop; Amy led the way down\nstone steps from the pavement of the street into an area, where more\nthan two people would have had difficulty in standing together. Sidney\nsaw that the window which looked upon this space was draped with a\nsheet. By an open door they entered a passage, then came to the door of\nthe room. Amy pushed it open, and showed that a lamp gave light within.\n\nTo poor homes Sidney Kirkwood was no stranger, but a poorer than this\nnow disclosed to him he had never seen. The first view of it made him\ndraw in his breath, as though a pang went through him. Hewett was not\nhere. The two younger children were sitting upon a mattress, eating\nbread. Amy stepped up to the bedside and bent to examine her mother's\nface.\n\n'I think she's asleep,' she whispered, turning round to Sidney.\n\nSleep, or loath? It might well be the latter, for anything Sidney could\ndetermine to the contrary. The face he could not recognise, or only\nwhen he had gazed at it for several minutes. Oh, pitiless world, that\npursues its business and its pleasure, that takes its fill of life from\nthe rising to the going down of the sun, and within sound of its\nclamour is this hiding-place of anguish and desolation!\n\n'Mother, here's Mr. Kirkwood.'\n\nRepeated several times, the words at length awoke consciousness. The\ndying woman could not move her head from the pillow; her eyes wandered,\nbut in the end rested upon Sidney. He saw an expression of surprise, of\nanxiety, then a smile of deep contentment.\n\n'I knew you'd come. I did so want to see you. Don't go just yet, will\nyou?'\n\nThe lump in his throat hindered Sidney from replying. Hot tears, an\nagony in the shedding, began to stream down his cheeks.\n\n'Where's John?' she continued, trying to look about the room. 'Amy,\nwhere's your father? He'll come soon, Sidney. I want you and him to be\nfriends again. He knows he'd never ought to a' said what he did. Don't\ntake on so, Sidney! There'll be Amy to look after the others. She'll be\na good girl. She's promised me. It's John I'm afraid for. If only he\ncan keep from drink. Will you try and help him, Sidney?'\n\nThere was a terrible earnestness of appeal in the look she fixed upon\nhim. Sidney replied that he would hold nothing more sacred than the\ncharge she gave him.\n\n'It'll be easier for them to live,' continued the feeble voice. 'I've\nbeen ill so long, and there's been so much expense. Amy'll be earning\nsomething before long.'\n\n'Don't trouble,' Sidney answered. 'They shall never want as long as I\nlive--never!'\n\n'Sidney, come a bit nearer. Do you know anything about _her_?'\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n'If ever--if ever she comes back, don't turn away from her--will you?'\n\n'I would welcome her as I would a sister of my own.'\n\n'There's such hard things in a woman's life. What would a' become of\nme, if John hadn't took pity on me! The world's a hard place; I should\nbe glad to leave it, if it wasn't for them as has to go on in their\ntrouble. I knew you'd come when I sent Amy. Oh, I feel that easier in\nmy mind!'\n\n'Why didn't you send long before? No, it's my fault. Why didn't I come?\nWhy didn't I come?'\n\nThere was a footstep in the passage, a slow, uncertain step; then the\ndoor moved a little. With blurred vision Sidney saw Hewett enter and\ncome forward. They grasped each other's hands without speaking, and\nJohn, as though his strength were at an end, dropped upon the chair by\nthe bedside. For the last four or five nights he had sat there; if he\ngot half an hour's painful slumber now and then it was the utmost. His\nface was like that of some prisoner, whom the long torture of a foul\ndungeon has brought to the point of madness. He uttered only a few\nwords during the half-hour that Sidney still remained in the room. The\nlatter, when Mrs. Hewett's relapse into unconsciousness made it useless\nfor him to stay, beckoned Amy to follow him out into the area and put\nmoney in her hand, begging her to get whatever was needed without\ntroubling her father. He would come again in the morning.\n\nMrs. Hewett died just before daybreak without a pang, as though death\nhad compassion on her. When Sidney came, about nine o'clock, he found\nAmy standing at the door of the milk-shop; the people who kept it had\nbrought the children up into their room. Hewett still sat by the bed;\nseeing Kirkwood, he pointed to the hidden face.\n\n'How am I to bury her?' he whispered hoarsely. 'Haven't you heard about\nit? They've stole the club-money; they've robbed me of it; I haven't as\nmuch as'll pay for her coffin.'\n\nSidney fancied at first that the man's mind was wandering, but Hewett\ntook out of his pocket a scrap of newspaper in which the matter was\nbriefly reported.\n\n'See, it's there. I've known since last Sunday, and I had to keep it\nfrom her. No need to be afraid of speakin' now. They've robbed me, and\nI haven't as much as'll pay for her coffin. It's a nice blasted world,\nthis is, where they won't let you live, and then make you pay if you\ndon't want to be buried like a dog! She's had nothing but pain and\npoverty all her life, and now they'll pitch her out of the way in a\nparish box. Do you remember what hopes I used to have when we were\nfirst married? See the end of 'em--look at this underground hole--look\nat this bed as she lays on! Is it my fault? By God, I wonder I haven't\nkilled myself before this! I've been drove mad, I tell you--mad! It's\nwell if I don't do murder yet; every man as I see go by with a good\ncoat on his back and a face fat with good feeding, it's all I can do to\nkeep from catchin' his throat an tearin' the life out of him!'\n\n'Let's talk about the burial,' interposed Sidney. 'Make your mind at\nease. I've got enough to pay for all that, and you must let me lend you\nwhat you want.'\n\n'Lend me money? You as I haven't spoke to for years?'\n\n'The more fault mine. I ought to have come back again long since; you\nwouldn't have refused an old friend that never meant an unkindness to\nyou.'\n\n'No, it was me as was to blame,' said the other, with choking voice.\n'She always told me so, and she always said what was right. But I can't\ntake it of you, Sidney; I can't! Lend it? An' where am I goin' to get\nit from to pay you back? It won't be so long before I lie like she does\nthere. It's getting too much for me.'\n\nThe first tears he had shed rose at this generosity of the man he had\nso little claim upon. His passionate grief and the spirit of rebellion,\nwhich grew more frenzied as he grew older, were subdued to a sobbing\ngratitude for the kindness which visited him in his need. Nerveless,\nvoiceless, he fell back again upon the chair and let his head lie by\nthat of the dead woman.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nWATCHING FROM AMBUSH\n\nMr. Joseph Snowdon, though presenting a calm countenance to the world\nand seeming to enjoy comparative prosperity, was in truth much harassed\nby the difficulties of his position. Domestic troubles he had\nanticipated, but the unforeseen sequel of his marriage resulted in a\nmartyrdom at the hands of Clem and her mother such as he had never\ndreamed of. His faults and weaknesses distinctly those of the civilised\nman, he found himself in disastrous alliance with two savages, whose\ncharacters so supplemented each other as to constitute in unison a\nformidable engine of tyranny. Clem--suspicious, revengeful, fierce,\nwatching with cruel eyes every opportunity of taking payment on account\nfor the ridicule to which she had exposed herself; Mrs.\nPeckover--ceaselessly occupied with the basest scheming, keen as an\nIndian on any trail she happened to strike, excited by the scent of\nmoney as a jackal by that of carrion; for this pair Joseph was no\nmatch. Not only did they compel him to earn his daily bread by dint of\nmethodical effort such as was torture to his indolent disposition, but,\nmoreover, in pursuance of Mrs. Peckover's crafty projects, he was\nconstrained to an assiduous hypocrisy in his relations with Michael and\nJane which wearied him beyond measure. Joseph did not belong to the\nmost desperate class of hungry mortals; he had neither the large\nambitions and the passionate sensual desires which make life an\nunending fever, nor was he possessed with that foul itch of\ncovetousness which is the explanation of the greater part of the\nworld's activity. He understood quite sufficiently the advantages of\nwealth, and was prepared to go considerable lengths for the sake of\nenjoying them, but his character lacked persistence. This defect\nexplained the rogueries and calamities of his life. He had brains in\nabundance, and a somewhat better education would have made of him\neither a successful honest man or a rascal of superior scope--it is\nalways a toss-up between these two results where a character such as\nhis is in question. Ever since he abandoned the craft to which his\nfather had had him trained, he had lived on his wits; there would be\nmatter for a volume in the history of his experiences at home and\nabroad, a volume infinitely more valuable considered as a treatise on\nmodern civilisation than any professed work on that subject in\nexistence. With one episode only in his past can we here concern\nourselves; the retrospect is needful to make clear his relations with\nMr. Scawthorne.\n\nOn his return from America, Joseph possessed a matter of a hundred\npounds; the money was not quite legally earned (pray let us reserve the\nword honesty for a truer use than the common one), and on the whole he\npreferred to recommence life in the old country under a pseudonym--that\nlittle affair of the desertion of his child would perhaps, in any case,\nhave made this advisable. A hundred pounds will not go very far, but\nJoseph took care to be well dressed, and allowed it to be surmised by\nthose with whom he came in contact that the resources at his command\nwere considerable. In early days, as we know, he had worked at\nelectroplating, and the natural bent of his intellect was towards\nmechanical and physical science; by dint of experimenting at his old\npursuit, he persuaded himself, or at all events attained plausibility\nfor the persuading of others, that he had discovered a new and valuable\nmethod of plating with nickel, He gave it out that he was in search of\na partner to join him in putting this method into practice. Gentlemen\nthus situated naturally avail themselves of the advertisement columns\nof the newspaper, and Joseph by this means had the happiness to form an\nacquaintance with one Mr. Polkenhorne, who, like himself, had sundry\nschemes for obtaining money without toiling for it in the usual vulgar\nway. Polkenhorne was a man of thirty-five, much of a blackguard, but\nkeen-witted, handsome, and tolerably educated; the son of a Clerkenwell\nclockmaker, he had run through an inheritance of a few thousand pounds,\nand made no secret of his history--spoke of his experiences, indeed,\nwith a certain pride. Between these two a close intimacy sprang up, one\nof those partnerships, beginning with mutual deception, which are so\ncommon in the border-land of enterprise just skirting the criminal\ncourts. Polkenhorne resided at this time in Kennington; he was\nmarried--or said that he was--to a young lady in the theatrical\nprofession, known to the public as Miss Grace Danver. To Mrs.\nPolkenhorne, or Miss Danver, Joseph soon had the honour of being\npresented, for she was just then playing at a London theatre; he found\nher a pretty but consumptive-looking girl, not at all likely to achieve\ngreat successes, earning enough, however, to support Mr. Polkenhorne\nduring this time of his misfortunes--a most pleasant and natural\narrangement.\n\nPolkenhorne's acquaintances were numerous, but, as he informed Joseph,\nmost of them were 'played out,' that is to say, no further use could be\nmade of them from Polkenhorne's point of view. One, however, as yet\nimperfectly known, promised to be useful, perchance as a victim, more\nprobably as an ally; his name was Scawthorne, and Polkenhorne had come\nacross him in consequence of a friendship existing between Grace Danver\nand Mrs. Scawthorne--at all events, a young lady thus known--who was\npreparing herself for the stage. This gentleman was 'something in the\nCity;' he had rather a close look, but proved genial enough, and was\nvery ready to discuss things in general with Mr. Polkenhorne and his\ncapitalist friend Mr. Camden, just from the United States.\n\nA word or two about Charles Henry Scawthorne, of the circumstances\nwhich made him what you know, or what you conjecture. His father had a\nsmall business as a dyer in Islington, and the boy, leaving school at\nfourteen, was sent to become a copying-clerk in a solicitor's office;\nhis tastes were so strongly intellectual that it seemed a pity to put\nhim to work he hated, and the clerkship was the best opening that could\nbe procured for him. Two years after, Mr. Scawthorne died; his wife\ntried to keep on the business, but soon failed, and thenceforth her son\nhad to support her as well as himself. From sixteen to three-and-twenty\nwas the period of young Scawthorne's life which assured his future\nadvancement--and his moral ruin. A grave, gentle, somewhat effeminate\nboy, with a great love of books and a wonderful power of application to\nstudy, he suffered so much during those years of early maturity, that,\nas in almost all such eases, his nature was corrupted. Pity that some\nself-made intellectual man of our time has not flung in the world's\nteeth a truthful autobiography. Scawthorne worked himself up to a\nposition which had at first seemed unattainable; what he paid for the\nsuccess was loss of all his pure ideals, of his sincerity, of his\ndisinterestedness, of the fine perceptions to which he was born.\nProbably no one who is half-starved and overworked during those\ncritical years comes out of the trial with his moral nature uninjured;\nto certain characters it is a wrong irreparable. To stab the root of a\nyoung tree, to hang crushing burdens upon it, to rend off its early\nbranches--that is not the treatment likely to result in growth such as\nnature purposed. There will come of it a vicious formation, and the\nprinciple applies also to the youth of men.\n\nScawthorne was fond of the theatre; as soon as his time of incessant\ntoll was over, he not only attended performances frequently, but\nmanaged to make personal acquaintance with sundry theatrical people.\nOpportunity for this was afforded by his becoming member of a club,\nconsisting chiefly of solicitors' clerks, which was frequently honoured\nby visits from former associates who had taken to the stage; these\nhappy beings would condescend to recite at times, to give help in\ngetting up a dramatic entertainment, and soon, in this way, Scawthorne\ncame to know an old actor named Drake, who supported himself by\ninstructing novices, male and female, in his own profession; one of Mr.\nDrake's old pupils was Miss Grace Danver, in whom, as soon as he met\nher, Scawthorne recognised the Grace Rudd of earlier days. And it was\nnot long after this that he brought to Mr. Drake a young girl of\ninteresting appearance, but very imperfect education, who fancied she\nhad a turn for acting; he succeeded in arranging for her instruction,\nand a year and a half later she obtained her first engagement at a\ntheatre in Scotland. The name she adopted was Clara Vale. Joseph\nSnowdon saw her once or twice before she left London, and from Grace\nDanver he heard that Grace and she had been schoolfellows in\nClerkenwell. These facts revived in his memory when he afterwards heard\nClem speak of Clara Hewett.\n\nNothing came of the alliance between Polkenhorne and Joseph; when the\nlatter's money was exhausted, they naturally fell apart. Joseph made a\nliving in sundry precarious ways, but at length sank into such straits\nthat he risked the step of going to Clerkenwell Close. Personal\ninterest in his child he had then none whatever; his short married life\nseemed an episode in the remote past, recalled with indifference. But\nin spite of his profound selfishness, it was not solely from the\nspeculative point of view that he regarded Jane, when he had had time\nto realise that she was his daughter, and in a measure to appreciate\nher character. With the merely base motives which led him to seek her\naffection and put him at secret hostility with Sidney Kirkwood, there\nmingled before long a strain of feeling which was natural and pure; he\nbecame a little jealous of his father and of Sidney on other grounds\nthan those of self-interest. Intolerable as his home was, no wonder\nthat he found it a pleasant relief to spend an evening in Hanover\nStreet; he never came away without railing at himself for his\nimbecility in having married Clem. For the present he had to plot with\nhis wife and Mrs. Peckover, but only let the chance for plotting\n_against_ them offer itself! The opportunity might come. In the\nmeantime, the great thing was to postpone the marriage--he had no doubt\nit was contemplated--between Jane and Sidney. That would be little less\nthan a fatality.\n\nThe week that Jane spent in Essex was of course a time of desperate\nanxiety with Joseph; immediately on her return he hastened to assure\nhimself that things remained as before. It seemed to him that Jane's\ngreeting had more warmth than she was wont to display when they met;\nsundry other little changes in her demeanour struck him at the same\ninterview, and he was rather surprised that she had not so much\nblitheness as before she went away. But his speculation on minutiae\nsuch as these was suddenly interrupted a day or two later by news which\nthrew him into a state of excitement; Jane sent word that her\ngrandfather was very unwell, that he appeared to have caught a chill in\nthe journey home, and could not at present leave his bed. For a week\nthe old man suffered from feverish symptoms, and, though he threw off\nthe ailment, it was in a state of much feebleness that he at length\nresumed the ordinary tenor of his way. Jane had of course stayed at\nhome to nurse him; a fortnight, a month passed, and Michael still kept\nher from work. Then it happened that, on Joseph's looking in one\nevening, the old man said quietly, 'I think I'd rather Jane stayed at\nhome in future. We've had a long talk about it this afternoon.'\n\nJoseph glanced at his daughter, who met the look very gravely. He had a\nfeeling that the girl was of a sudden grown older; when she spoke it\nwas in brief phrases, and with but little of her natural spontaneity;\nnoiseless as always in her movements, she walked with a staider gait,\nheld herself less girlishly, and on saying good-night she let her cheek\nrest for a moment against her father's, a thing she had never yet done.\n\nThe explanation of it all came a few minutes after Jane's retirement.\nMichael, warned by his illness bow unstable was the tenure on which he\nhenceforth held his life, had resolved to have an end of mystery and\nexplain to his son all that he had already made known to Sidney\nKirkwood. With Jane he had spoken a few hours ago, revealing to her the\npower that was in his hands, the solemn significance he attached to it,\nthe responsibility with which her future was to be invested. To make\nthe same things known to Joseph was a task of more difficulty. He could\nnot here count on sympathetic intelligence; it was but too certain that\nhis son would listen with disappointment, if not with bitterness. In\norder to mitigate the worst results, he began by making known the fact\nof his wealth and asking if Joseph had any practical views which could\nbe furthered by a moderate sum put at his disposal.\n\n'At my death,' he added, 'you'll find that I haven't dealt unkindly by\nyou. But you're a man of middle age, and I should like to see you in\nsome fixed way of life before I go.'\n\nHaving heard all, Joseph promised to think over the proposal which\nconcerned himself. It was in a strange state of mind that he returned\nto the Close; one thing only he was clear upon, that to Clem and her\nmother he would breathe no word of what had been told him. After a\nnight passed without a wink of sleep, struggling with the amazement,\nthe incredulity, the confusion of understanding caused by his father's\nwords, he betook himself to a familiar public-house, and there penned a\nnote to Scawthorne, requesting an interview as soon as possible. The\nmeeting took place that evening at the retreat behind Lincoln's Inn\nFields where the two had held colloquies on several occasions during\nthe last half-year. Scawthorne received with gravity what his\nacquaintance had to communicate. Then he observed:\n\n'The will was executed ten days ago.'\n\n'It was? And what's he left me?'\n\n'Seven thousand pounds--less legacy duty.'\n\n'And thirty thousand to Jane?'\n\n'Just so.'\n\nJoseph drew in his breath; his teeth ground together for a moment; his\neyes grew very wide. With a smile Scawthorne proceeded to explain that\nJane's trustees were Mr. Percival, senior, and his son. Should she die\nunmarried before attaining her twenty-first birthday, the money\nbequeathed to her was to be distributed among certain charities.\n\n'It's my belief there's a crank in the old fellow,' exclaimed Joseph.\n'Is he really such a fool as to think Jane won't use the money for\nherself? And what about Kirkwood? I tell you what it is; he's a deep\nfellow, is Kirkwood. I wish you knew him.'\n\nScawthorne confessed that he had the same wish, but added that there\nwas no chance of its being realised; prudence forbade any move in that\ndirection.\n\n'If he marries her,' questioned Joseph, 'will the money be his?'\n\n'No; it will be settled on her. But it comes to very much the same\nthing; there's to be no restraint on her discretion in using it.'\n\n'She might give her affectionate parent a hundred or so now and then,\nif she chose?'\n\n'If she chose.'\n\nScawthorne began a detailed inquiry into the humanitarian projects of\nwhich Joseph had given but a rude and contemptuous explanation. The\nfiner qualities of his mind enabled him to see the matter in quite a\ndifferent light from that in which it presented itself to Jane's\nfather; he had once or twice had an opportunity of observing Michael\nSnowdon at the office, and could realise in a measure the character\nwhich directed its energies to such an ideal aim. Concerning Jane he\nasked many questions; then the conversation turned once more to Sidney\nKirkwood.\n\n'I wish he'd married his old sweetheart,' observed Joseph, watching the\nother's face.\n\n'Who was that?'\n\n'A girl called Clara Hewett.'\n\nTheir looks met. Scawthorne, in spite of habitual self-command,\nbetrayed an extreme surprise.\n\n'I wonder what's become of her?' continued Joseph, still observing his\ncompanion, and speaking with unmistakable significance.\n\n'Just tell me something about this,' said Scawthorne peremptorily.\n\nJoseph complied, and ended his story with a few more hints.\n\n'I never saw her myself--at least I can't be sure that I did. There was\nsomebody of the same name--Clara--a friend of Polkenhorne's wife.'\n\nScawthorne appeared to pay no attention; he mused with a wrinkled brow.\n\n'If only I could put something between Kirkwood and the girl,' remarked\nJoseph, as if absently. 'I shouldn't wonder if it could be made worth\nsome one's while to give a bit of help that way. Don't you think so?'\n\nIn the tone of one turning to a different subject, Scawthorne asked\nsuddenly:\n\n'What use are you going to make of your father's offer?'\n\n'Well, I'm not quite sure, Shouldn't wonder if I go in for filters.'\n\n'Filters?'\n\nJoseph explained. In the capacity of 'commission agent'--denomination\nwhich includes and apologises for such a vast variety of casual\npursuits--he had of late been helping to make known to the public a new\nfilter, which promised to be a commercial success. The owner of the\npatent lacked capital, and a judicious investment might secure a share\nin the business; Joseph thought of broaching the subject with him next\nday.\n\n'You won't make a fool of yourself?' remarked Scawthorne.\n\n'Trust me; I think I know my way about.'\n\nFor the present these gentlemen had nothing more to say to each other;\nthey emptied their glasses with deliberation, exchanged a look which\nmight mean either much or nothing, and so went their several ways.\n\nThe filter project was put into execution. When Joseph had communicated\nit in detail to his father, the latter took the professional advice of\nhis friend Mr. Percival, and in the course of a few weeks Joseph found\nhimself regularly established in a business which had the--for\nhim--novel characteristic of serving the purposes of purity. The\nmanufactory was situated in a by-street on the north of Euston Road: a\nsmall concern, but at all events a genuine one. On the window of the\noffice you read, 'Lake, Snowdon, & Co.' As it was necessary to account\nfor this achievement to Clem and Mrs. Peckover, Joseph made known to\nthem a part of the truth; of the will he said nothing, and, for reasons\nof his own, he allowed these tender relatives to believe that he was in\na fair way to inherit the greater part of Michael's possessions. There\nwas jubilation in Clerkenwell Close, but mother and daughter kept stern\nwatch upon Joseph's proceedings.\n\nAnother acquaintance of ours benefited by this event. Michael made it a\nstipulation that some kind of work should be found at the factory for\nJohn Hewett, who, since his wife's death, had been making a wretched\nstruggle to establish a more decent home for the children. The firm of\nLake, Snowdon, & Co. took Hewett into their employment as a porter, and\npaid him twenty-five shillings a week--of which sum, however, the odd\nfive shillings were privately made up by Michael. On receiving this\nappointment, John drew the sigh of a man who finds himself in haven\nafter perilous beating about a lee shore. The kitchen in King's Cross\nBead was abandoned, and with Sidney Kirkwood's aid the family found\nmuch more satisfactory quarters. Friends of Sidney's, a man and wife of\nmiddle age without children, happened to be looking for lodgings: it\nwas decided that they and John Hewett should join in the tenancy of a\nfiat, up on the fifth storey of the huge block of tenements called\nFarringdon Road Buildings. By this arrangement the children would be\nlooked after, and the weekly twenty-five shillings could be made to go\nmuch further than on the ordinary system. As soon as everything had\nbeen settled, and when Mr. and Mrs. Eagles had already housed\nthemselves in the one room which was all they needed for their private\naccommodation, Hewett and the children began to pack together their\nmiserable sticks and rags for removal. Just then Sidney Kirkwood looked\nin.\n\n'Eagles wants to see you for a minute about something,' he said. 'Just\nwalk round with me, will you?'\n\nJohn obeyed, in the silent, spiritless way now usual with him. It was\nbut a short distance to the buildings: they went up the winding stone\nstaircase, and Sidney gave a hollow-sounding knock at one of the two\ndoors that faced each other on the fifth storey. Mrs. Eagles opened, a\ndecent, motherly woman, with a pleasant and rather curious smile on her\nface. She led the way into one of the rooms which John had seen empty\nonly a few hours ago. How was this? Oil-cloth on the floor, a blind at\nthe window, a bedstead, a table, a chest of drawers--\n\nMrs. Eagles withdrew, discreetly. Hewett stood with a look of uneasy\nwonderment, and at length turned to his companion.\n\n'Now, look here,' he growled, in an unsteady voice, 'what's all this\nabout?'\n\n'Somebody seems to have got here before you,' replied Sidney, smiling.\n\n'How the devil am I to keep any self-respect if you go on treatin' me\nin this fashion?' blustered John, hanging his head.\n\n'It isn't my doing, Mr. Hewett.'\n\n'Whose, then?'\n\n'A friend's. Don't make a fuss. You shall know the person some day.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nON THE EVE OF TRIUMPH\n\n'I have got your letter, but it tells me no more than the last did. Why\ndon't you say plainly what you mean? I suppose it's something you are\nashamed of. You say that there's a chance for me of earning a large sum\nof money, and if you are in earnest, I shall be only too glad to hear\nhow it's to be done. This life is no better than what I used to lead\nyears ago; I'm no nearer to getting a good part than I was when I first\nbegan acting, and unless I can get money to buy dresses and all the\nrest of it, I may go on for ever at this hateful drudgery. I shall take\nnothing more from you: I say it, and I mean it; but as you tell me that\nthis chance has nothing to do with yourself, let me know what it really\nis. For a large sum of money there are few things I wouldn't do. Of\ncourse it's something disgraceful, but you needn't be afraid on that\naccount; I haven't lost all my pride yet, but I know what I'm fighting\nfor, and I won't be beaten. Cost what it may, I'll make people hear of\nme and talk of me, and I'll pay myself back for all I've gone through.\n\nSo write in plain words, or come and see me.\n\nC. V.'\n\nShe wrote at a round table, shaky on its central support, in the\nparlour of an indifferent lodging-house; the October afternoon drew\ntowards dusk; the sky hung low and murky, or, rather, was itself\ninvisible, veiled by the fume of factory chimneys; a wailing wind\nrattled the sash and the door. A newly lighted fire refused to flame\ncheerfully, half smothered in its own smoke, which every now and then\nwas blown downwards and out into the room. The letter\nfinished--scribbled angrily with a bad pen and in pale ink--she put it\ninto its envelope--'C. H. Scawthorne, Esq.'\n\nThen a long reverie, such as she always fell into when alone and\nunoccupied. The face was older, but not greatly changed from that of\nthe girl who fought her dread fight with temptation, and lost it, in\nthe lodging at Islington, who, then as now, brooded over the wild\npassions in her heart and defied the world that was her enemy. Still a\nbeautiful face, its haughty characteristics strengthened, the lips a\nlittle more sensual, a little coarser; still the same stamp of\nintellect upon the forehead, the same impatient scorn and misery in her\neyes. She asked no one's pity, but not many women breathed at that\nmoment who knew more of suffering.\n\nFor three weeks she had belonged to a company on tour in the northern\ncounties. In accordance with the modern custom--so beneficial to actors\nand the public--their repertory consisted of one play, the famous\nmelodrama, 'A Secret of the Thames,' recommended to provincial\naudiences by its run of four hundred and thirty-seven nights at a\nLondon theatre. These, to be sure, were not the London actors, but\nadvertisements in local newspapers gave it to be understood that they\n'made an _ensemble_ in no respect inferior to that which was so long\nthe delight of the metropolis.' Starred on the placards was the name of\nMr. Samuel Peel, renowned in the North of England; his was the company,\nand his the main glory in the piece. As leading lady he had the\ndistinguished Miss Erminia Walcott; her part was a trying one, for she\nhad to be half-strangled by ruffians and flung--most decorously--over\nthe parapet of London Bridge. In the long list of subordinate\nperformers occurred two names with which we are familiar, Miss Grace\nDanver and Miss Clara Vale. The present evening would be the third and\nlast in a certain town of Lancashire, one of those remarkable centres\nof industry which pollute heaven and earth, and on that account are\nspoken of with somewhat more of pride than stirred the Athenian when he\nnamed his Acropolis.\n\nClara had just risen to stir the fire, compelled to move by the smoke\nthat was annoying her, when, after a tap at the door, there came in a\nyoung woman of about five-and-twenty, in a plain walking costume, tall,\nvery slender, pretty, but looking ill. At this moment there was a\nslight flush on her cheeks and a brightness in her eyes which obviously\ncame of some excitement. She paused just after entering and said in an\neager voice, which had a touch of huskiness:\n\n'What do you think? Miss Walcott's taken her hook!'\n\nClara did not allow herself to be moved at this announcement. For\nseveral days what is called unpleasantness had existed between the\nleading lady and the manager: in other words, they had been quarrelling\nviolently on certain professional matters, and Miss Walcott had\nthreatened to ruin the tour by withdrawing her invaluable services. The\nmenace was at last executed, in good earnest, and the cause of Grace\nDanver's excitement was that she, as Miss Walcott's understudy, would\nto-night, in all probability, be called upon to take the leading part.\n\n'I'm glad to hear it,' Clara replied, very soberly.\n\n'You don't look as if you cared much,' rejoined the other, with a\nlittle irritation.\n\n'What do you want me to do? Am I to scream with joy because the\ngreatest actress in the world has got her chance at last?'\n\nThere was bitterness in the irony. Whatever their friendship in days\ngone by, these two were clearly not on the most amiable terms at\npresent. This was their first engagement in the same company, and it\nhad needed but a week of association to put a jealousy and ill-feeling\nbetween them which proved fatal to such mutual kindness as they had\npreviously cherished. Grace, now no less than in her schooldays, was\nfond of patronising: as the elder in years and in experience, she\nadopted a tone which Clara speedily resented. To heighten the danger of\na conflict between natures essentially incompatible, both were in a\nmorbid and nervous state, consumed with discontent, sensitive to the\nmost trifling injury, abandoned to a fierce egoism, which the course of\ntheir lives and the circumstances of their profession kept constantly\ninflamed. Grace was of acrid and violent temper; when stung with words\nsuch as Clara was only too apt at using, she speedily lost command of\nherself and spoke, or even acted, frantically. Except that she had not\nClara's sensibilities, her lot was the harder of the two; for she knew\nherself stricken with a malady which would hunt her unsparingly to the\ngrave. On her story I have no time to dwell; it was fall of\nwretchedness, which had caused her, about a year ago, to make an\nattempt at suicide. A little generosity, and Clara might have helped to\nsoothe the pains of one so much weaker than herself; but noble feeling\nwas extinct in the girl, or so nearly extinct that a breath of petty\nrivalry could make her base, cruel, remorseless.\n\n'At all events I _have_ got my chance!' exclaimed Grace, with a harsh\nlaugh. 'When you get yours, ask me to congratulate you.'\n\nAnd she swept her skirts out of the room. In a few minutes Clara put a\nstamp on her letter and went out to the post. Her presence at the\ntheatre would not be necessary for another two hours, but as the\ndistance was slight, and nervousness would not let her remain at home,\nshe walked on to make inquiry concerning Grace's news. Rain had just\nbegun to fall, and with it descended the smut and grime that darkened\nabove the houses; the pavement was speedily over-smeared with sticky\nmud, and passing vehicles flung splashes in every direction. Odours of\noil and shoddy, and all such things as characterised the town, grew\nmore pungent under the heavy shower. On reaching the stage-door, Clara\nfound two or three of her companions just within; the sudden departure\nof Miss Walcott had become known to everyone, and at this moment Mr.\nPeel was holding a council, to which, as the doorkeeper testified, Miss\nDanver had been summoned.\n\nThe manager decided to make no public announcement of what had happened\nbefore the hour came for drawing up the curtain. A scrappy rehearsal\nfor the benefit of Grace Danver and the two or three other ladies who\nwere affected by the necessary rearrangement went on until the last\npossible moment, then Mr. Peel presented himself before the drop and\nmade a little speech. The gallery was fall of mill-hands; in the pit\nwas a sprinkling of people; the circles and boxes presented half a\ndozen occupants. 'Sudden domestic calamity . . . enforced absence of\nthe lady who played . . . efficient substitution . . . deep regret, but\nconfidence in the friendly feeling of audience on this last evening.'\n\nThey growled, but in the end applauded the actor-manager, who had\nsucceeded in delicately hinting that, after all, the great attraction\nwas still present in his own person. The play went very much as usual,\nbut those behind the scenes were not allowed to forget that Mr. Peel\nwas in a furious temper: the ladies noticed with satisfaction that more\nthan once he glared ominously at Miss Danver, who naturally could not\naid him to make his 'points' as Miss Walcott had accustomed herself to\ndo. At his final exit, it was observed that he shrugged his shoulders\nand muttered a few oaths.\n\nClara had her familiar part; it was a poor one from every point of\nview, and the imbecility of the words she had to speak affected her\nto-night with exceptional irritation. Clara always acted in ill-humour.\nShe despised her audience for their acceptance of the playwright's\nclaptrap; she felt that she could do better than any of the actresses\nentrusted with the more important characters; her imagination was for\never turning to powerful scenes in plays she had studied privately, and\ndespair possessed her at the thought that she would perhaps never have\na chance of putting forth her strength. Tonight her mood was one of\nsullen carelessness; she did little more than 'walk through' her part,\nfeeling a pleasure in thus insulting the house. One scrap of dialogue\nshe had with Grace, and her eyes answered with a flash of hatred to the\narrogance of the other's regard. At another point she all but missed\nher cue, for her thoughts were busy with that letter to which she had\nreplied this afternoon. Mr. Peel looked at her savagely, and she met\nhis silent rebuke with an air of indifference. After that the manager\nappeared to pay peculiar attention to her as often as they were\ntogether before the footlights. It was not the first time that Mr. Peel\nhad allowed her to see that she was an object of interest to him.\n\nThere was an after-piece, but Clara was not engaged in it. When, at the\nfall of the curtain on the melodrama, she went to the shabby\ndressing-room which she shared with two companions, a message delivered\nby the call boy bade her repair as soon as possible to the manager's\noffice. What might this mean? She was startled on the instant, but\nspeedily recovered her self-control; most likely she was to receive a\nrating--let it come! Without unusual hurry, she washed, changed her\ndress, and obeyed the summons.\n\nMr. Peel was still a young man, of tall and robust stature, sanguine,\nwith much sham refinement in his manner; he prided himself on the\ncivility with which he behaved to all who had business relations with\nhim, but every now and then the veneer gave an awkward crack, and, as\nin his debate with Miss Walcott, the man himself was discovered to be\nof coarse grain. His aspect was singular when, on Clara's entrance into\nthe private room, he laid down his cigarette and scrutinised her. There\nwas a fiery hue on his visage, and the scowl of his black eyebrows had\na peculiar ugliness.\n\n'Miss Vale,' he began, after hesitation, 'do you consider that you\nplayed your part this evening with the conscientiousness that may\nfairly be expected of you?'\n\n'Perhaps not,' replied the girl, averting her eyes, and resting her\nhand on the table.\n\n'And may I ask _why_ not?'\n\n'I didn't feel in the humour. The house saw no difference.'\n\n'Indeed? The house saw no difference? Do you mean to imply that you\nalways play badly?'\n\n'I mean that the part isn't worth any attention--even if they were able\nto judge.'\n\nThere was a perfection of insolence in her tone that in itself spoke\nstrongly for the abilities she could display if occasion offered.\n\n'This is rather an offhand way of treating the subject, madam,' cried\nMr. Peel. 'If you disparage our audiences, I beg you to observe that it\nis much the same thing as telling me that my own successes are\nworthless!'\n\n'I intended nothing of the kind.'\n\n'Perhaps not.' He thrust his hands into his pockets, and looked down at\nhis boots for an instant. 'So you are discontented with your part?'\n\n'It's only natural that I should be.'\n\n'I presume you think yourself equal to Juliet, or perhaps Lady Macbeth?'\n\n'I could play either a good deal better than most women do.'\n\nThe manager laughed, by no means ill-humouredly.\n\n'I'm sorry I can't bring you out in Shakespeare just at present, Miss\nVale; but--should you think it a condescension to play Laura Denton?'\n\nThis was Miss Walcott's part, now Grace Danver's. Clara looked at him\nwith mistrust; her breath did not come quite naturally.\n\n'How long would it take you, do you think,' pursued the other, 'to get\nthe words?'\n\n'An hour or two; I all but know them.'\n\nThe manager took a few paces this way and that.\n\n'We go on to Bolton to-morrow morning. Could you undertake to be\nperfect for the afternoon rehearsal?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Then I'll try you. Here's a copy you can take. I make no terms, you\nunderstand; it's an experiment. We'll have another talk to-morrow.\nGood-night.'\n\nShe left the room. Near the door stood Grace Danver and another\nactress, both of whom were bidden to wait upon the manager before\nleaving. Clara passed under the fire of their eyes, but scarcely\nobserved them.\n\nRain drenched her between the theatre and her lodgings, for she did not\nthink of putting up an umbrella; she thought indeed of nothing; there\nwas fire and tumult in her brain. On the round table in her\nsitting-room supper was made ready, but she did not heed it. Excitement\ncompelled her to walk incessantly round and round the scanty space of\nfloor. Already she had begun to rehearse the chief scenes of Laura\nDenton; she spoke the words with all appropriate loudness and emphasis;\nher gestures were those of the stage, as though an audience sat before\nher; she seemed to have grown taller. There came a double knock at the\nhouse-door, but it did not attract her attention; a knock at her own\nroom, and only when some one entered was she recalled to the present.\nIt was Grace again; her lodging was elsewhere, and this late visit\ncould have but one motive.\n\nThey stood face to face. The elder woman was so incensed that her lips\nmoved fruitlessly, like those of a paralytic.\n\n'I suppose you're going to make a scene,' Clara addressed her. 'Please\nremember how late it is, and don't let all the house hear you.'\n\n'You mean to tell me you accepted that offer of Peel's--without saying\na word--without as much as telling him that he ought to speak to me\nfirst?'\n\n'Certainly I did. I've waited long enough; I'm not going to beat about\nthe bush when my chance comes.'\n\n'And you called yourself my friend?'\n\n'I'm nobody's friend but my own in an affair of this kind. If you'd\nbeen in my place you'd have done just the same.'\n\n'I wouldn't! I _couldn't_ have been such a mean creature! Every man and\nwoman in the company'll cry shame on you.'\n\n'Don't deafen me with your nonsense! If you played the part badly, I\nsuppose some one else must take it. You were only on trial, like I\nshall be.'\n\nGrace was livid with fury.\n\n'Played badly! As if we didn't all know how you've managed it! Much it\nhas to do with good or bad acting! We know how creatures of your kind\nget what they want.'\n\nBefore the last word was uttered she was seized with a violent fit of\ncoughing; her cheeks flamed, and spots of blood reddened on the\nhandkerchief she put to her mouth. Half-stifled, she lay back in the\nangle of the wall by the door. Clara regarded her with a contemptuous\npity, and when the cough had nearly ceased, said coldly:\n\n'I'm not going to try and match you in insulting language; I dare say\nyou'd beat me at that. If you take my advice, you'll go home and take\ncare of yourself; you look ill enough to be in bed. I don't care what\nyou or anyone else thinks of me; what you said just now was a lie, but\nit doesn't matter. I've got the part, and I'll take good care that I\nkeep it. You talk about us being friends; I should have thought you\nknew by this time that there's no such thing as friendship or\ngenerosity or feeling for women who have to make their way in the\nworld. You've had your hard times as well as I, and what's the use of\npretending what you don't believe? You wouldn't give up a chance for\nme; I'm sure I should never expect you to. We have to fight, to fight\nfor everything, and the weak get beaten. That's what life has taught\nme.'\n\n'You're right,' was the other's reply, given with a strangely sudden\ncalmness. 'And we'll see who wins.'\n\nClara gave no thought to the words, nor to the look of deadly enmity\nthat accompanied them. Alone again, she speedily became absorbed in a\nvision of the triumph which she never doubted was near at hand. A long,\nlong time it seemed since she had sold herself to degradation: with\nthis one hope. You see that she had formulated her philosophy of life\nsince then; a child of the nether world whom fate had endowed with\nintellect, she gave articulate utterance to what is seething in the\nbrains of thousands who fight and perish in the obscure depths. The\nbitter bargain was issuing to her profit at last; she would yet attain\nthat end which had shone through all her misery--to be known as a\nsuccessful actress by those she had abandoned, whose faces were growing\ndim to her memory, but of whom, in truth, she still thought more than\nof all the multitudinous unknown public. A great success during the\nremainder of this tour, and she might hope for an engagement in London.\nHer portraits would at length be in the windows; some would recognise\nher.\n\nYet she was not so pitiless as she boasted. The next morning, when she\nmet Grace, there came a pain at her heart in seeing the ghastly,\nbloodless countenance which refused to turn towards her. Would Grace be\nable to act at all at the next town? Yes, one more scene.\n\nThey reached Bolton. In the afternoon the rehearsal took place, but the\nfirst representation was not until to-morrow. Clara saw her name\nattached to the leading female character on bills rapidly printed and\ndistributed through the town. She went about in a dream, rather a\ndelirium. Mr. Peel used his most affable manner to her; his compliments\nafter the rehearsal were an augury of great things. And the eventful\nevening approached.\n\nTo give herself plenty of time to dress (the costumes needed for the\npart were fortunately simple, and Mr. Peel had advanced her money to\nmake needful purchases) she left her lodgings at half-past six. It was\na fine evening, but very dark in the two or three by-streets along\nwhich she had to pass to reach the theatre. She waited a minute on the\ndoorstep to let a troop of female mill-hands go by; their shoes clanked\non the pavement, and they were singing in chorus, a common habit of\ntheir kind in leaving work. Then she started and walked quickly. .\n\nClose by the stage-door, which was in a dark, narrow passage, stood a\nwoman with veiled face, a shawl muffling the upper part of her body.\nSince six o'clock she had been waiting about the spot, occasionally\nwalking to a short distance, but always keeping her face turned towards\nthe door. One or two persons came up and entered; she observed them,\nbut held aloof. Another drew near. The woman advanced, and, as she did\nso, freed one of her arms from the shawl.\n\n'That you, Grace?' said Clara, almost kindly, for in her victorious joy\nshe was ready to be at peace with all the world.\n\nThe answer was something dashed violently in her face--something fluid\nand fiery--something that ate into her flesh, that frenzied her with\npain, that drove her shrieking she knew not whither.\n\nLate in the same night, a pointsman, walking along the railway a little\ndistance out of the town, came upon the body of a woman, train-crushed,\nhorrible to view. She wore the dress of a lady; a shawl was still\npartly wrapped about her, and her hands were gloved. Nothing\ndiscoverable upon her would have helped strangers in the task of\nidentification, and as for her face--But a missing woman was already\nsought by the police, and when certain persons were taken to view this\nbody, they had no difficulty in pronouncing it that of Grace Danver.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nTHE FAMILY HISTORY PROGRESSES\n\nWhat could possess John Hewett that, after resting from the day's work,\nhe often left his comfortable room late in the evening and rambled\nabout the streets of that part of London which had surely least\ninterest for him, the streets which are thronged with idlers, with\ncarriages going homeward from the theatres, with those who can only\ncome forth to ply their business when darkness has fallen? Did he seek\nfood for his antagonism in observing the characteristics of the world\nin which he was a stranger, the world which has its garners full and\ntakes its ease amid superfluity? It could scarcely be that, for since\nhis wife's death an indifference seemed to be settling upon him; he no\nlonger cared to visit the Green or his club on Sunday, and seldom spoke\non the subjects which formerly goaded him to madness. He appeared to be\ndrawn forth against his will, in spite of weariness, and his look as he\nwalked on was that of a man who is in search of some one. Yet whom\ncould he expect to meet in these highways of the West End?\n\nOxford Street, Regent Street, Piccadilly, the Strand, the ways about\nSt. James's Park; John Hewett was not the only father who has come\nforth after nightfall from an obscure home to look darkly at the faces\npassing on these broad pavements. At times he would shrink into a\nshadowed corner, and peer thence at those who went by under the\ngaslight. When he moved forward, it was with the uneasy gait of one who\nshuns observation; you would have thought, perchance, that he watched\nan opportunity of begging and was shamefaced: it happened now and then\nthat he was regarded suspiciously. A rough-looking man, with grizzled\nbeard, with eyes generally bloodshot, his shoulders stooping--naturally\nthe miserable are always suspected where law is conscious of its\ninjustice.\n\nTwo years ago he was beset for a time with the same restlessness, and\ntook night-walks in the same directions; the habit wore away, however.\nNow it possessed him even more strongly. Between ten and eleven\no'clock, when the children were in bed, he fell into abstraction, and\npresently, with an unexpected movement, looked up as if some one had\nspoken to him--just the look of one who hears a familiar voice; then he\nsighed, and took his hat and went forth. It happened sometimes when he\nwas sitting with his friends Mr. and Mrs. Eagles; in that case he would\nmake some kind of excuse. The couple suspected that his business would\ntake him to the public-house, but John never came back with a sign\nabout him of having drunk; of that failing he had broken himself. He\nwent cautiously down the stone stairs, averting his face if anyone met\nhim; then by cross-ways he reached Gray's Inn Road, and so westwards.\n\nHe had a well-ordered home, and his children were about him, but these\nthings did not compensate him for the greatest loss his life had\nsuffered. The children, in truth, had no very strong hold upon his\naffections. Sometimes, when Amy sat and talked to him, he showed a\ngrowing nervousness, an impatience, and at length turned away from her\nas if to occupy himself in some manner. The voice was not that which\nhad ever power to soothe him when it spoke playfully. Memory brought\nback the tones which had been so dear to him, and at times something\nmore than memory; he seemed really to hear them, as if from a distance.\nAnd then it was that he went out to wander in the streets.\n\nOf Bob in the meantime he saw scarcely anything. That young man\npresented himself one Sunday shortly after his father had become\nsettled in the new home, but practically he was a stranger. John and he\nhad no interests in common; there even existed a slight antipathy on\nthe father's part of late years. Strangely enough this feeling\nexpressed itself one day in the form of a rebuke to Bob for neglecting\nPennyloaf--Pennyloaf, whom John had always declined to recognise.\n\n'I hear no good of your goin's on,' remarked Hewett, on a casual\nencounter in the street. 'A married man ought to give up the kind of\ncompany as you keep.'\n\n'I do no harm,' replied Bob bluntly. 'Has my wife been complaining to\nyou?'\n\n'I've nothing to do with her; it's what I'm told.'\n\n'By Kirkwood, I suppose? You'd better not have made up with him again,\nif he's only making mischief.'\n\n'No, I didn't mean Kirkwood.'\n\nAnd John went his way. Odd thing, was it not, that this embittered\nleveller should himself practise the very intolerance which he reviled\nin people of the upper world. For his refusal to recognise Pennyloaf he\nhad absolutely no grounds, save--I use the words advisedly--an\naristocratic prejudice. Bob had married deplorably beneath him; it was\nunpardonable, let the character of the girl be what it might. Of course\nyou recognise the item in John Hewett's personality which serves to\nexplain this singular attitude. But, viewed generally, it was one of\nthose bits of human inconsistency over which the observer smiles, and\nwhich should be recommended to good people in search of arguments for\nthe equality of men.\n\nAfter that little dialogue, Bob went home in a disagreeable temper. To\nbegin with, his mood had been ruffled, for the landlady at his\nlodgings--the fourth to which he had removed this year--was 'nasty'\nabout a week or two of unpaid rent, and a man on whom he had counted\nthis evening for the payment of a debt was keeping out of his way. He\nfound Pennyloaf sitting on the stairs with her two children, as usual;\npoor Pennyloaf had not originality enough to discover new expressions\nof misery, and that one bright idea of donning her best dress was a\nsingle instance of ingenuity. In obedience to Jane Snowdon, she kept\nherself and the babies and the room tolerably clean, but everything was\ndone in the most dispirited way.\n\n'What are you kicking about here for?' asked Bob impatiently. 'That's\nhow that kid gets its cold--of course it is!--Ger out!'\n\nThe last remark was addressed to the elder child, who caught at his\nlegs as he strode past. Bob was not actively unkind to the little\nwretches for whose being he was responsible; he simply occupied the\nnatural position of unsophisticated man to children of that age, one of\nindifference, or impatience. The infants were a nuisance; no one\ndesired their coming, and the older they grew the more expensive they\nwere.\n\nIt was a cold evening of October; Pennyloaf had allowed the fire to get\nvery low (she knew not exactly where the next supply of coals was to\ncome from), and her husband growled as he made a vain endeavour to warm\nhis hands.\n\n'Why haven't you got tea ready?' he asked,\n\n'I couldn't be sure as you was comin', Bob; how could I? But I'll soon\nget the kettle boilin'.'\n\n'Couldn't be sure as I was coming? Why, I've been back every night this\nweek--except two or three.'\n\nIt was Thursday, but Bob meant nothing jocose.\n\n'Look here!' he continued, fixing a surly eye upon her. 'What do you\nmean by complaining about me to people? Just mind your own business.\nWhen was that girl Jane Snowdon here last?'\n\n'Yesterday, Bob.'\n\n'I thought as much, Did she give you anything?' He made this inquiry in\nrather a shamefaced way.\n\n'No, she didn't.'\n\n'Well, I tell you what it is. I'm not going to have her coming about\nthe place, so understand that. When she comes next, you'll just tell\nher she needn't come again.'\n\nPennyloaf looked at him with dismay. For the delivery of this command\nBob had seated himself on the corner of the table and crossed his arms.\nBut for the touch of black-guardism in his appearance, Bob would have\nbeen a very good-looking fellow; his face was healthy, by no means\ncommonplace in its mould, and had the peculiar vividness which\nindicates ability--so impressive, because so rarely seen, in men of his\nlevel. Unfortunately his hair was cropped all but to the scalp, in the\nfashionable manner; it was greased, too, and curled up on one side of\nhis forehead with a peculiarly offensive perkishness. Poor Pennyloaf\nwas in a great degree responsible for the ills of her married life; not\nonly did she believe Bob to be the handsomest man who walked the earth\nbut in her weakness she could not refrain from telling him as much. At\nthe present moment he was intensely self-conscious; with Pennyloaf's\neye upon him, he posed for effect. The idea of forbidding future\nintercourse with Jane had come to him quite suddenly; it was by no\nmeans his intention to make his order permanent, for Jane had now and\nthen brought little presents which were useful, but just now he felt a\nsatisfaction in asserting authority. Jane should understand that he\nregarded her censure of him with high displeasure.\n\n'You don't mean that, Bob?' murmured Pennyloaf.\n\n'Of course I do. And let me catch you disobeying me! I should think you\nmight find better friends than a girl as used to be the Peckovers'\ndirty little servant.'\n\nBob turned up his nose and sniffed the air. And Pennyloaf, in spite of\nthe keenest distress, actually felt that there was something in the\nobjection, thus framed! She herself had never been a servant--never;\nshe had never sunk below working with the needle for sixteen hours a\nday for a payment of ninepence. The work-girl regards a domestic slave\nas very distinctly her inferior.\n\n'But that's a long while ago,' she ventured to urge, after reflection.\n\n'That makes no difference. Do as I tell you, and don't argue.'\n\nIt was not often that visitors sought Bob at his home of an evening,\nbut whilst this dialogue was still going on an acquaintance made his\narrival known by a knock at the door. It was a lank and hungry\nindividual, grimy of face and hands, his clothing such as in the\ncountry would serve well for a scarecrow. Who could have recognised in\nhim the once spruce and spirited Mr. Jack Bartley, distinguished by his\nchimney-pot hat at the Crystal Palace on Bob's wedding-day? At the\nclose of that same day, as you remember, he and Bob engaged in terrific\ncombat, the outcome of earlier rivalry for the favour of Clem Peckover.\nNotwithstanding that memory, the two were now on very friendly terms.\nYou have heard from Clem's lips that Jack Bartley, failing to win\nherself, ended by espousing Miss Susan Jollop; also what was the result\nof that alliance. Mr. Bartley was an unhappy man. His wife had a\nferocious temper, was reckless with money, and now drank steadily; the\nconsequence was, that Jack had lost all regular employment, and only\nearned occasional pence in the most various ways. Broken in spirit, he\nhimself first made advances to his companion of former days, and Bob,\nflattered by the other's humility, encouraged him as a\nhanger-on.--Really, we shall soon be coming to a conclusion that the\ndifferences between the nether and the upper world are purely\nsuperficial.\n\nWhenever Jack came to spend an hour with Mr. and Mrs. Hewett, he was\nsure sooner or later to indulge the misery that preyed upon him and\ngive way to sheer weeping. He did so this evening, almost as soon as he\nentered.\n\n'I ain't had a mouthful past my lips since last night, I ain't!' he\nsobbed. 'It's 'ard on a feller as used to have his meals regular. I'll\nmurder Suke yet, see if I don't! I'll have her life! She met me last\nnight and gave me this black eye as you see--she did! It's 'ard on a\nfeller.'\n\n'You mean to say as she '_it_ you?' cried Pennyloaf.\n\nBob chuckled, thrust his hands into his pockets, spread himself out.\nHis own superiority was so gloriously manifest.\n\n'Suppose _you_ try it on with _me_, Penny!' he cried.\n\n'You'd give me something as I should remember,' she answered, smirking,\nthe good little slavey.\n\n'Shouldn't wonder if I did,' assented Bob.\n\nMr. Bartley's pressing hunger was satisfied with some bread and butter\nand a cup of tea. Whilst taking a share of the meal, Bob brought a\nsmall box on to the table; it had a sliding lid, and inside were\ncertain specimens of artistic work with which he was wont to amuse\nhimself when tired of roaming the streets in jovial company. Do you\nrecollect that, when we first made Bob's acquaintance, he showed Sidney\nKirkwood a medal of his own design and casting? His daily work at\ndie-sinking had of course supplied him with this suggestion, and he\nstill found pleasure in work of the same kind. In days before\ncommercialism had divorced art and the handicrafts, a man with Bob's\ndistinct faculty would have found encouragement to exercise it for\nserious ends; as it was, he remained at the semi-conscious stage with\nregard to his own aptitudes, and cast leaden medals just as a way of\noccupying his hands when a couple of hours hung heavy on them. Partly\nwith the thought of amusing the dolorous Jack, yet more to win\nlaudation, he brought forth now a variety of casts and moulds and\nspread them on the table. His latest piece of work was a medal in high\nrelief bearing the heads of the Prince and Princess of Wales surrounded\nwith a wreath. Bob had no political convictions; with complacency he\ndrew these royal features, the sight of which would have made his\nfather foam at the mouth. True, he might have found subjects\nartistically more satisfying, but he belonged to the people, and the\nEnglish people.\n\nJack Bartley, having dried his eyes and swallowed his bread and butter,\nconsidered the medal with much attention.\n\n'I say,' he remarked at length, 'will you give me this, Bob?'\n\n'I don't mind, You can take it if you like.'\n\n'Thanks!'\n\nJack wrapped it up and put it in his waistcoat pocket, and before long\nrose to take leave of his friends.\n\n'I only wish I'd got a wife like you,' he observed at the door, as he\nsaw Pennyloaf bending over the two children, recently put to bed.\n\nPennyloaf's eyes gleamed at the compliment, and she turned them to her\nhusband.\n\n'She's nothing to boast of,' said Bob, judicially and masculinely. 'All\nwomen are pretty much alike.'\n\nAnd Pennyloaf tried to smile at the snub.\n\nHaving devoted one evening to domestic quietude, Bob naturally felt\nhimself free to dispose of the next in a manner more to his taste. The\npleasures which sufficed to keep him from home had the same sordid\nmonotony which characterises life in general for the lower strata of\nsociety. If he had money, there was the music-hall; if he had none,\nthere were the streets. Being in the latter condition to-night, he\njoined a company of male and female intimates, and with them strolled\naimlessly from one familiar rendezvous to another. Would that it were\npossible to set down a literal report of the conversation which passed\nduring hours thus spent! Much of it, of course, would be merely\nrevolting, but for the most part it would consist of such wearying,\nsuch incredible imbecilities as no human patience could endure through\nfive minutes' perusal. Realise it, however, and you grasp the\nconditions of what is called the social problem. As regards Robert\nHewett in particular, it would help you to understand the momentous\nchange in his life which was just coming to pass.\n\nOn his reaching home at eleven o'clock, Pennyloaf met him with the news\nthat Jack Bartley had looked in twice and seemed very anxious to see\nhim. To-morrow being Saturday, Jack would call again early in the\nafternoon. When the time came, he presented himself, hungry and dirty\nas ever, but with an unwonted liveliness in his eye.\n\n'I've got something to say to you,' he began, in a low voice, nodding\nsignificantly towards Pennyloaf.\n\n'Go and buy what you want for to-morrow,' said Bob to his wife, giving\nher some money out of his wages. 'Take the kids.'\n\nDisappointed in being thus excluded from confidence, but obedient as\never, Pennyloaf speedily prepared herself and the children, the younger\nof whom she still had to carry. When she was gone Mr. Bartley assumed a\npeculiar attitude and began to speak in an undertone.\n\n'You know that medal as you gave me the other night?'\n\n'What about it?'\n\n'I sold it for fourpence to a chap I know. It got me a bed at the\nlodgings in Pentonville Road.'\n\n'Oh, you did! Well, what else?'\n\nJack was writhing in the most unaccountable way, peering hither and\nthither out of the corners of his eyes, seeming to have an obstruction\nin his throat.\n\n'It was in a public-house as I sold it--a chap I know. There was\nanother chap as I didn't know standing just by--see? He kep' looking at\nthe medal, and he kep' looking at me. When I went out the chap as I\ndidn't know followed behind me. I didn't see him at first, but he come\nup with me just at the top of Rosoman Street--a red-haired chap, looked\nlike a corster. \"Hollo!\" says he. \"Hollo!\" says I. \"Got any more o'\nthem medals?\" he says, in a quiet way like. \"What do you want to know\nfor?\" I says--'cos you see he was a bloke as I didn't know nothing\nabout, and there's no good being over-free with your talk. He got me to\nwalk on a bit with him, and kept talking. \"You didn't buy that\nnowhere,\" he says, with a sort of wink. \"What if I didn't?\" I says.\n\"There's no harm as I know.\" Well, he kept on with his sort o' winks,\nand then he says, \"Got any _queer_ to put round?\"'\n\nAt this point Jack lowered his voice to a whisper and looked timorously\ntowards the door.\n\n'You know what he meant, Bob?'\n\nBob nodded and became reflective.\n\n'Well, I didn't say nothing.' pursued Bartley, 'but the chap stuck to\nme. \"A fair price for a fair article,\" he says. \"You'll always find me\nthere of a Thursday night, if you've got any business going. Give me a\nlook round,\" he says. \"It ain't in my line,\" I says. So he gave a grin\nlike, and kep' on talking. \"If you want a _four-half shiner_,\" he says,\n\"you know where to come. Reasonable with them as is reasonable.\nThursday night,\" he says, and then he slung his hook round the corner.'\n\n'What's a four-half shiner?' inquired Bob, looking from under his\neyebrows.\n\n'Well, I didn't know myself, just then: but I've found out. It's a\npublic-house pewter--see?'\n\nA flash of intelligence shot across Bob's face.\n\nWhen Pennyloaf returned she found her husband with his box of moulds\nand medals on the table. He was turning over its contents,\nmeditatively. On the table there also lay a half crown and a florin, as\nthough Bob had been examining these products of the Royal Mint with a\nview to improving the artistic quality of his amateur workmanship. He\ntook up the coins quietly as his wife entered and put them in his\npocket.\n\n'Mrs. Rendal's been at me again, Bob,' Pennyloaf said, as she set down\nher market-basket. 'You'll have to give her something to-day.'\n\nHe paid no attention, and Pennyloaf had a difficulty in bringing him to\ndiscuss the subject of the landlady's demands. Ultimately, however, he\nadmitted with discontent the advisability of letting Mrs. Rendal have\nsomething on account. Though it was Saturday night, he let hour after\nhour go by and showed no disposition to leave home; to Pennyloaf's\nsurprise, he sat almost without moving by the fire, absorbed in thought.\n\nGenuine respect for law is the result of possessing something which the\nlaw exerts itself to guard. Should it happen that you possess nothing,\nand that your education in metaphysics has been grievously neglected,\nthe strong probability is, that your mind will reduce the principle of\nsociety to its naked formula: Get, by whatever means, so long as with\nimpunity. On that formula Bob Hewett was brooding; in the hours of this\nSaturday evening he exerted his mind more strenuously than ever before\nin the course of his life. And to a foregone result. Here is a man with\nno moral convictions, with no conscious relations to society save those\nwhich are hostile, with no personal affections; at the same time,\nvaguely aware of certain faculties in himself for which life affords no\nscope and encouraged in various kinds of conceit by the crass stupidity\nof all with whom he associates. It is suggested to him all at once that\nthere is a very easy way of improving his circumstances, and that by\nexercise of a certain craft with which he is perfectly familiar; only,\nthe method happens to be criminal. 'Men who do this kind of thing are\nconstantly being caught and severely punished. Yes; men of a certain\nkind; not Robert Hewett. Robert Hewett is altogether an exceptional\nbeing; he is head and shoulders above the men with whom he mixes; he is\nclever, he is remarkably good-looking. If anyone in this world, of a\ntruth Robert Hewett may reckon on impunity when he sets his wits\nagainst the law. Why, his arrest and punishment is an altogether\ninconceivable thing; he never in his life had a charge brought against\nhim.'\n\nAgain and again it came back to that. Every novice in unimpassioned\ncrime has that thought, and the more self-conscious the man, the more\nimpressed with a sense of his own importance, so much the weightier is\nits effect with him.\n\nWe know in what spirit John Hewett regarded rebels against the law. Do\nnot imagine that any impulse of that nature actuated his son. Clara\nalone had inherited her father's instinct of revolt. Bob's temperament\nwas, in a certain measure, that of the artist; he felt without\nreasoning; he let himself go whither his moods propelled him. Not a man\nof evil propensities; entertain no such thought for a moment. Society\nproduces many a monster, but the mass of those whom, after creating\nthem, it pronounces bad are merely bad from the conventional point of\nview; they are guilty of weaknesses, not of crimes. Bob was not\nincapable of generosity; his marriage had, in fact, implied more of\nthat quality than you in the upper world can at all appreciate. He\nneglected his wife, of course, for he had never loved her, and the\nburden of her support was too great a trial for his selfishness.\nWeakness, vanity, a sense that he has not satisfactions proportionate\nto his desert, a strong temptation--here are the data which, in\nordinary cases, explain a man's deliberate attempt to profit by\ncriminality.\n\nIn a short time Pennyloaf began to be aware of peculiarities of\nbehaviour in her husband for which she could not account. Though there\nappeared no necessity for the step, he insisted on their once more\nseeking new lodgings, and, before the removal, he destroyed all his\nmedals and moulds.\n\n'What's that for, Bob?' Pennyloaf inquired.\n\n'I'll tell you, and mind you hold your tongue about it. Somebody's been\nsaying as these things might get me into trouble. Just you be careful\nnot to mention to people that I used to make these kind of things.'\n\n'But why should it get you into trouble?'\n\n'Mind what I tell you, and don't ask questions. You're always too ready\nat talking.'\n\nHis absences of an evening were nothing new, but his manner on\nreturning was such as Pennyloaf had never seen in him. He appeared to\nbe suffering from some intense excitement; his hands were unsteady; he\nshowed the strangest nervousness if there were any unusual sounds in\nthe house. Then he certainly obtained money of which his wife did not\nknow the source; he bought new articles of clothing, and in explanation\nsaid that he had won bets. Pennyloaf remarked these things with\nuneasiness; she had a fear during her lonely evenings for which she\ncould give no reason. Poor slowwitted mortal though she was, a devoted\nfidelity attached her to her husband, and quickened wonderfully her\napprehension in everything that concerned him.\n\n'Miss Snowdon came to-day, Bob,' she had said, about a week after his\norder with regard to Jane.\n\n'Oh, she did? And did you tell her she'd better keep away?'\n\n'Yes,' was the dispirited answer.\n\n'Glad to hear it.'\n\nAs for Jack Bartley, he never showed himself at the new lodgings.\n\nBob shortly became less regular in his attendance at the workshop. An\noccasional Monday he had, to be sure, been in the habit of allowing\nhimself, but as the winter wore on he was more than once found straying\nabout the streets in midweek. One morning towards the end of November,\nas he strolled along High Holborn, a hand checked his progress; he gave\nalmost a leap, and turned a face of terror upon the person who stopped\nhim. It was Clem--Mrs. Snowdon. They had, of course, met casually since\nBob's marriage, and in progress of time the ferocious glances they were\nwont to exchange had softened into a grin of half-friendly recognition;\nClem's behaviour at present was an unexpected revival of familiarity.\nWhen he had got over his shock Bob felt surprised, and expressed the\nfeeling in a--'Well, what have _you_ got to say for yourself?'\n\n'You jumped as if I'd stuck a pin in you,' replied Clem. 'Did you think\nit was a copper?'\n\nBob looked at her with a surly smile. Though no one could have mistaken\nthe class she belonged to, Clem was dressed in a way which made her\ncompanionship with Bob in his workman's clothing somewhat incongruous;\nshe wore a heavily trimmed brown hat, a long velveteen jacket, and\ncarried a little bag of imitation fur.\n\n'Why ain't you at work?' she added. 'Does Mrs. Pennyloaf Hewett know\nhow you spend your time?'\n\n'Hasn't your husband taught you to mind your own business?'\n\nClem took the retort good-humouredly, and they walked on conversing.\nNot altogether at his ease thus companioned, Bob turned out of the main\nstreet, and presently they came within sight of the British Museum.\n\n'Ever been in that place?' Clem asked.\n\n'Of course I have,' he replied, with his air of superiority.\n\n'I haven't. Is there anything to pay? Let's go in for half an hour.'\n\nIt was an odd freak, but Bob began to have a pleasure in this renewal\nof intimacy; he wished he had been wearing his best suit. Years ago his\nfather had brought him on a public holiday to the Museum, and his\ninterest was chiefly excited by the collection of the Royal Seals. To\nthat quarter he first led his companion, and thence directed her\ntowards objects more likely to supply her with amusement; he talked\nfreely, and was himself surprised at the show of information his memory\nallowed him to make--desperately vague and often ludicrously wide of\nthe mark, but still a something of knowledge, retained from all sorts\nof chance encounters by his capable mind. Had the British Museum been\nopen to visitors in the hours of the evening, or on Sundays, Bob Hewitt\nwould possibly have been employing his leisure nowadays in more\nprofitable pursuits. Possibly; one cannot say more than that; for the\nworld to which he belonged is above all a world of frustration, and\nonly the one man in half a million has fate for his friend.\n\nMuch Clem cared for antiquities; when she had wearied herself in\npretending interest, a seat in an unvisited corner gave her an\nopportunity for more congenial dialogue.\n\n'How's Mrs. Pennyloaf?' she asked, with a smile of malice.\n\n'How's Mr. What's-his-name Snowdon?' was the reply.\n\n'My husband's a gentleman. Good thing for me I had the sense to wait.'\n\n'And for me too, I dare say.'\n\n'Why ain't you at work? Got the sack?'\n\n'I can take a day off if I like, can't I?'\n\n'And you'll go 'ome and tell your wife as you've been working. I know\nwhat you men are. What 'ud Mrs. Pennyloaf say if she knew you was here\nwith me? You daren't tell her; you daren't!'\n\n'I'm not doing any harm as I know of. I shall tell her if I choose, and\nif I choose I shan't. I don't ask _her_ what I'm to do.'\n\n'I dare say. And how does that mother of hers get on? And her brother\nat the public? Nice relations for Mr. Bob Hewett. Do they come to tea\non a Sunday?'\n\nBob glared at her, and Clem laughed, showing all her teeth. From this\nexchange of pleasantries the talk passed to various subjects--the\naffairs of Jack Bartley and his precious wife, changes in Clerkenwell\nClose, then to Clem's own circumstances; she threw out hints of\nbrilliant things in store for her.\n\n'Do you come here often?' she asked at length.\n\n'Can't say I do.'\n\n'Thought p'r'aps you brought Mrs. Pennyloaf. When'll you be here again?'\n\n'Don't know,' Bob replied, fidgeting and looking to a distance.\n\n'I shouldn't wonder if I'm here this day next week,' said Clem, after a\npause. 'You can bring Pennyloaf if you like.'\n\nIt was dinner-time, and they left the building together. At the end of\nMuseum Street they exchanged a careless nod and went their several ways.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nA DOUBLE CONSECRATION\n\nBessie Byass and her husband had, as you may suppose, devoted many an\nhour to intimate gossip on the affairs of their top-floor lodgers.\nHaving no relations with Clerkenwell Close, they did not even hear the\nrumours which spread from Mrs. Peckover's house at the time of Jane's\ndeparture thence; their curiosity, which only grew keener as time went\non, found no appeasement save in conjecture. That Sidney Kirkwood was\nin the secret from the first they had no doubt; Bessie made a sly\nattempt now and then to get a hint from him, but without the least\nresult. The appearance on the scene of Jane's father revived their\nspeculation, and just after the old man's illness in the month of\nAugust occurred something which gave them still fresh matter for\nargument. The rooms on the first floor having become vacant, Michael\nproposed certain new arrangements. His own chamber was too much that of\nan invalid to serve any longer as sitting-room for Jane; he desired to\ntake the front room below for that purpose, to make the other on the\nsame floor Jane's bed-room, and then to share with the Byasses the\nexpense of keeping a servant, whose lodging would be in the chamber\nthus set free. Hitherto Bessie and Jane and an occasional charwoman had\ndone all the work of the house; it was a day of jubilation for Mrs.\nByass when she found herself ruling over a capped and aproned maid. All\nthese things set it beyond doubt that Michael Snowdon had means greater\nthan one would have supposed from his way of living hitherto. Jane's\nremoval from work could, of course, be explained by her grandfather's\ngrowing infirmities, but Bessie saw more than this in the new order of\nthings; she began to look upon the girl with a certain awe, as one\nwhose future might reveal marvels.\n\nFor Jane, as we know, the marvels had already begun. She came back from\nDanbury not altogether like herself; unsettled a little, as it\nappeared; and Michael's illness, befalling so soon, brought her into a\nnervous state such as she had not known for a long time. The immediate\neffect of the disclosure made to her by Michael whilst he was\nrecovering was to overwhelm her with a sense of responsibilities, to\nthrow her mind into painful tumult. Slow of thought, habituated to the\nsimplest views of her own existence, very ignorant of the world beyond\nthe little circle in which her life had been passed, she could not at\nonce bring into the control of her reflection this wondrous future to\nwhich her eyes had been opened. The way in which she had been made\nacquainted with the facts was unfortunate. Michael Snowdon, in spite of\nhis deep affection for her, and of the trust he had come to repose in\nher character, did not understand Jane well enough to bring about this\nrevelation with the needful prudence. Between him, a man burdened with\nthe sorrowful memories of a long life, originally of stern temperament,\nand now, in the feebleness of his age, possessed by an enthusiasm which\nin several respects disturbed his judgment, which made him desperately\neager to secure his end now that he felt life slipping away from\nhim--between him and such a girl as Jane there was a wider gulf than\neither of them could be aware of. Little as he desired it, he could not\nhelp using a tone which seemed severe rather than tenderly trustful.\nAbsorbed in his great idea, conscious that it had regulated every\ndetail in his treatment of Jane since she came to live with him, he\nforgot that the girl herself was by no means adequately prepared to\nreceive the solemn injunctions which he now delivered to her. His\nlanguage was as general as were the ideas of beneficent activity which\nhe desired to embody in Jane's future; but instead of inspiring her\nwith his own zeal, he afflicted her with grievous spiritual trouble.\nFor a time she could only feel that something great and hard and high\nwas suddenly required of her; the old man's look seemed to keep\nrepeating, 'Are you worthy?' The tremor of bygone days came back upon\nher as she listened, the anguish of timidity, the heart-sinking, with\nwhich she had been wont to strain her attention when Mrs. Peckover or\nClem imposed a harsh task.\n\nOne thing alone had she grasped as soon as it was uttered; one word of\nreassurance she could recall when she sat down in solitude to collect\nher thoughts. Her grandfather had mentioned that Sidney Kirkwood\nalready knew this secret. To Sidney her whole being turned in this hour\nof distress; he was the friend who would help her with counsel and\nteach her to be strong. But hereupon there revived in her a trouble\nwhich for the moment she had forgotten, and it became so acute that she\nwas driven to speak to Michael in a way which had till now seemed\nimpossible. When she entered his room--it was the morning after their\ngrave conversation--Michael welcomed her with a face of joy, which,\nhowever, she still felt to be somewhat stern and searching in its look.\nWhen they had talked for a few moments, Jane said:\n\n'I may speak about this to Mr. Kirkwood, grandfather?'\n\n'I hope you will, Jane. Strangers needn't know of it yet, but we can\nspeak freely to him.'\n\nAfter many endeavours to find words that would veil her thought, she\nconstrained herself to ask:\n\n'Does he think I can be all you wish?'\n\nMichael looked at her with a smile.\n\n'Sidney has no less faith in you than I have, be sure of that.'\n\n'I've been thinking--that perhaps he distrusted me a little.'\n\n'Why, my child?'\n\n'I don't quite know. But there's been a little difference in him, I\nthink, since we came back.'\n\nMichael's countenance fell.\n\n'Difference? How?'\n\nBut Jane could not go further. She wished she had not spoken. Her face\nbegan to grow hot, and she moved away.\n\n'It's only your fancy,' continued Michael. 'But may be that--You think\nhe isn't quite so easy in his talking to you as he was?'\n\n'I've fancied it. But it was only--'\n\n'Well, you may be partly right,' said her grandfather, softening his\nvoice. 'See, Jane, I'll tell you something. I think there's no harm;\nperhaps I ought to. You must know that I hadn't meant to speak to\nSidney of these things just when I did. It came about, because _he_ had\nsomething to tell _me_, and something I was well pleased to hear. It\nwas about you, Jane, and in that way I got talking--something about\nyou, my child. Afterwards, I asked him whether he wouldn't speak to you\nyourself, but he said no--not till you'd heard all that was before you.\nI think I understood him, and I dare say you will, if you think it\nover.'\n\nMatter enough for thinking over, in these words. Did she understand\nthem aright? Before leaving the room she had not dared to look her\ngrandfather in the face, but she knew well that he was regarding her\nstill with the same smile. Did she understand him aright?\n\nTry to read her mind. The world had all at once grown very large, a\ndistress to her imagination; worse still, she had herself become a\nperson of magnified importance, irrecognisable in her own sight,\nmoving, thinking so unnaturally. Jane, I assure you, had thought very\nlittle of herself hitherto--in both senses of the phrase. Joyous\nbecause she could not help it, full of gratitude, admiration,\ngenerosity, she occupied her thoughts very much with other people, but\nknew not self-seeking, knew not self-esteem. The one thing affecting\nherself over which she mused frequently was her suffering as a little\nthrall in Clerkenwell Close, and the result was to make her very\nhumble. She had been an ill-used, ragged, work-worn child, and\nsomething of that degradation seemed, in her feeling, still to cling to\nher. Could she have known Bob Hewett's view of her position, she would\nhave felt its injustice, but at the same time would have bowed her\nhead. And in this spirit had she looked up to Sidney Kirkwood,\nregarding him as when she was a child, save for that subtle\nmodification which began on the day when she brought news of Clara\nHewett's disappearance. Perfect in kindness, Sidney had never addressed\na word to her which implied more than friendship--never until that\nevening at the farm; then for the first time had he struck a new note.\nHis words seemed spoken with the express purpose of altering his and\nher relations to each other. So much Jane had felt, and his change\nsince then was all the more painful to her, all the more confusing. Now\nthat of a sudden she had to regard herself in an entirely new way, the\ndearest interest of her life necessarily entered upon another phase.\nStruggling to understand how her grandfather could think her worthy of\nsuch high trust, she inevitably searched her mind for testimony as to\nthe account in which Sidney held her. A fearful hope had already\nflushed her cheeks before Michael spoke the words which surely could\nhave but one meaning.\n\nOn one point Sidney had left her no doubts; that his love for Clara\nHewett was a thing of the past he had told her distinctly. And why did\nhe wish her to be assured of that? Oh, had her grandfather been\nmistaken in those words he reported? Durst she put faith in them,\ncoming thus to her by another's voice?\n\nDoubts and dreads and self-reproofs might still visit her from hour to\nhour, but the instinct of joy would not allow her to refuse admission\nto this supreme hope. As if in spite of herself, the former\ngladness--nay, a gladness multiplied beyond conception--reigned once\nmore in her heart. Her grandfather would not speak lightly in such a\nmatter as this; the meaning of his words was confessed, to all eternity\nimmutable. Had it, then, come to this? The friend to whom she looked up\nwith such reverence, with voiceless gratitude, when he condescended to\nspeak kindly to _her_, the Peckovers' miserable little servant--he,\nafter all these changes and chances of life, sought her now that she\nwas a woman, and had it on his lips to say that he loved her. Hitherto\nthe impossible, the silly thought to be laughed out of her head, the\ndesire for which she would have chid herself durst she have faced it\nseriously--was it become a very truth? 'Keep a good heart, Jane;\nthings'll be better some day.' How many years since the rainy and windy\nnight when he threw his coat over her and spoke those words? Yet she\ncould hear them now, and the tears that rushed to her eyes as she\nblessed him for his manly goodness were as much those of the desolate\nchild as of the full-hearted woman.\n\nAnd the change that she had observed in him since that evening at\nDanbury? A real change, but only of manner. He would not say to her\nwhat he had meant to say until she knew the truth about her own\ncircumstances. In simple words, she being rich and he having only what\nhe earned by his daily work, Sidney did not think it right to speak\nwhilst she was still in ignorance. The delicacy of her instincts, and\nthe sympathies awakened by her affection, made this perfectly clear to\nher, strange and difficult to grasp as the situation was at first. When\nshe understood, how her soul laughed with exulting merriment!\nConsecration to a great idea, endowment with the means of wide\nbeneficence--this not only left her cold, but weighed upon her,\nafflicted her beyond her strength. What was it, in truth, that restored\nher to herself and made her heart beat joyously? Knit your brows\nagainst her; shake your head and raze her name from that catalogue of\nsaints whereon you have inscribed it in anticipation. Jane rejoiced\nsimply because she loved a poor man, and had riches that she could lay\nat his feet.\n\nGreat sums of money, vague and disturbing to her imagination when she\nwas bidden hold them in trust for unknown people, gleamed and made\nmusic now that she could think of them as a gift of love. By this way\nof thought she could escape from the confusion in which Michael's\nsolemn appeal had left her. Exalted by her great hope, calmed by the\nassurance of aid that would never fail her, she began to feel the\nbeauty of the task to which she was summoned; the appalling\nresponsibility became a high privilege now that it was to be shared\nwith one in whose wisdom and strength she had measureless confidence.\nShe knew now what wealth meant; it was a great and glorious power, a\nsource of blessings incalculable. This power it would be hers to\nbestow, and no man more worthy than he who should receive it at her\nhands.\n\nIt was not without result that Jane had been so long a listener to the\nconversations between Michael and Kirkwood. Defective as was her\ninstruction in the ordinary sense, those evenings spent in the company\nof the two men had done much to refine her modes of thought. In spite\nof the humble powers of her mind and her narrow experience, she had\nlearned to think on matters which are wholly strange to girls of her\nstation, to regard the life of the world and the individual in a light\nof idealism and with a freedom from ignoble association rare enough in\nany class. Her forecast of the future to be spent with Sidney was\npathetic in its simplicity, but had the stamp of nobleness. Thinking of\nthe past years, she made clear to herself all the significance of her\ntraining. In her general view of things, wealth was naturally allied\nwith education, but she understood why Michael had had her taught so\nlittle. A wealthy woman is called a lady; yes, but that was exactly\nwhat she was not to become. On that account she had gone to work, when\nin reality there was no need for her to do so. Never must she remove\nherself from the poor and the laborious, her kin, her care; never must\nshe forget those bitter sufferings of her childhood, precious as\nenabling her to comprehend the misery of others for whom had come no\nrescue. She saw, moreover, what was meant by Michael's religious\nteaching, why he chose for her study such parts of the Bible as taught\nthe beauty of compassion, of service rendered to those whom the world\ncasts forth and leaves to perish. All this grew upon her, when once the\ngladness of her heart was revived. It was of the essence of her being\nto exercise all human and self-forgetful virtues, and the consecration\nto a life of beneficence moved her profoundly now that it followed upon\nconsecration to the warmer love.\n\nWhen Sidney paid his next visit Jane was alone in the new sitting-room;\nher grandfather said he did not feel well enough to come down this\nevening. It was the first time that Kirkwood had seen the new room.\nAfter making his inquiries about Michael he surveyed the arrangements,\nwhich were as simple as they could be, and spoke a few words regarding\nthe comfort Jane would find in them. He had his hand on a chair, but\ndid not sit down, nor lay aside his hat. Jane suffered from a\nconstraint which she had never before felt in his presence.\n\n'You know what grandfather has been telling me?' she said at length,\nregarding him with grave eyes.\n\n'Yes. He told me of his intention.'\n\n'I asked him if I might speak to you about it. It was hard to\nunderstand at first.'\n\n'It would be, I've no doubt.'\n\nJane moved a little, took up some sewing, and seated herself. Sidney\nlet his hat drop on to the chair, but remained standing, his arms\nresting on the back.\n\n'It's a very short time since I myself knew of it,' he continued. 'Till\nthen, I as little imagined as you did that--' He paused, then resumed\nmore quickly, 'But it explains many things which I had always\nunderstood in a simpler way.'\n\n'I feel, too, that I know grandfather much better than I did,' Jane\nsaid. 'He's always been thinking about the time when I should be old\nenough to hear what plans he'd made for me. I do so hope he really\ntrusts me, Mr. Kirkwood! I don't know whether I speak about it as he\nwishes. It isn't easy to say all I think, but I mean to do my best to\nbe what he--'\n\n'He knows that very well. Don't be anxious; he feels that all his hopes\nhave been realised in you.'\n\nThere was silence. Jane made a pretence of using her needle, and Sidney\nwatched her hands.\n\n'He spoke to you of a lady called Mrs. Lant?' were his next words.\n\n'Yes. He just mentioned her.'\n\n'Are you going to see her soon?'\n\n'I don't know. Have _you_ seen her?'\n\n'No. But I believe she's a woman you could soon be friendly with. I\nhope your grandfather will ask her to come here before long.'\n\n'I'm rather afraid of strangers.'\n\n'No doubt,' said the other, smiling. 'But you'll get over that. I shall\ndo my best to persuade Mr. Snowdon to make you acquainted with her.'\n\nJane drew in her breath uneasily.\n\n'She won't want me to know other people, I hope?'\n\n'Oh, if she does, they'll be kind and nice and easy to talk to.'\n\nJane raised her eyes and said half-laughingly:\n\n'I feel as if I was very childish, and that makes me feel it still\nmore. Of course, if it's necessary, I'll do my best to talk to\nstrangers. But they won't expect too much of me, at first? I mean, if\nthey find me a little slow, they won't be impatient?'\n\n'You mustn't think that hard things are going to be asked of you.\nYou'll never be required to say or do anything that you haven't already\nsaid and done many a time, quite naturally. Why, it's some time since\nyou began the kind of work of which your grandfather has been speaking.'\n\n'I have begun it? How?'\n\n'Who has been such a good friend to Pennyloaf, and helped her as nobody\nelse could have done?'\n\n'Oh, but that's nothing!'\n\nSidney was on the point of replying! but suddenly altered his\nintention. He raised himself from the leaning attitude, and took his\nhat.\n\n'Well, we'll talk about it another time,' he said carelessly. 'I can't\nstop long to-night, so I'll go up and see your grandfather.'\n\nJane rose silently.\n\n'I'll just look in and say good-night before I go,' Sidney added, as he\nleft the room.\n\nHe did so, twenty minutes after. When he opened the door Jane was\nsewing busily, but it was only on hearing his footsteps that she had so\napplied herself. He gave a friendly nod, and departed.\n\nStill the same change in his manner. A little while ago he would have\nchatted freely and forgotten the time.\n\nAnother week, and Jane made the acquaintance of the lady whose name we\nhave once or twice heard, Miss Lant, the friend of old Mr. Percival. Of\nmiddle age and with very plain features, Miss Lant had devoted herself\nto philanthropic work; she had an income of a few hundred pounds, and\nlived almost as simply as the Snowdons in order to save money for\ncharitable expenditure. Unfortunately the earlier years of her life had\nbeen joyless, and in the energy which she brought to this self-denying\nenterprise there was just a touch of excess, common enough in those who\nhave been defrauded of their natural satisfactions and find a resource\nin altruism. She was no pietist, but there is nowadays coming into\nexistence a class of persons who substitute for the old religious\nacerbity a narrow and oppressive zeal for good works of purely human\nsanction, and to this order Miss Lant might be said to belong. However,\nnothing but what was agreeable manifested itself in her intercourse\nwith Michael and Jane; the former found her ardent spirit very\ncongenial, and the latter was soon at ease in her company.\n\nIt was a keen distress to Jane when she heard from Pennyloaf that Bob\nwould allow no future meetings between them. In vain she sought an\nexplanation; Pennyloaf professed to know nothing of her husband's\nmotives, but implored her friend to keep away for a time, as any\ndisregard of Bob's injunction would only result in worse troubles than\nshe yet had to endure. Jane sought the aid of Kirkwood, begging him to\ninterfere with young Hewett; the attempt was made, but proved\nfruitless. '_Sic volo, sic jubeo_,' was Bob's standpoint, and he as\ngood as bade Sidney mind his own affairs.\n\nJane suffered, and more than she herself would have anticipated. She\nhad conceived a liking, almost an affection, for poor, shiftless\nPennyloaf, strengthened, of course, by the devotion with which the\nlatter repaid her. But something more than this injury to her feelings\nwas involved in her distress on being excluded from those sorry\nlodgings. Pennyloaf was comparatively an old friend; she represented\nthe past, its contented work, its familiar associations, its abundant\nhappiness. And now, though Jane did not acknowledge to herself that she\nregretted the old state of things, still less that she feared the\nfuture, it was undeniable that the past seemed very bright in her\nmemory, and that something weighed upon her heart, forbidding such\ngladsomeness as she had known.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nSIDNEY'S STRUGGLE\n\nIn the dreary days when autumn is being choked by the first fogs,\nSidney Kirkwood had to bestir himself and to find new lodgings. The\ncheerless task came upon him just when he had already more than\nsufficient trouble, and to tear himself out of the abode in which he\nhad spent eight years caused him more than regret; he felt\nsuperstitiously about it, and questioned fate as to what sorrows might\nbe lurking for him behind this corner in life's journey. Move he must;\nhis landlady was dead, and the house would perhaps be vacant for a long\ntime. After making search about Islington one rainy evening, he found\nhimself at the end of Hanover Street, and was drawn to the familiar\nhouse; not, however, to visit the Snowdons, but to redeem a promise\nrecently made to Bessie Byass, who declared herself vastly indignant at\nthe neglect with which he treated her. So, instead of going up the\nsteps to the front door, he descended into the area. Bessie herself\nopened to him, and after a shrewd glance, made as though she would\nclose the door again. 'Nothing for you! The idea of beggars coming down\nthe area-steps. Be off!'\n\n'I'm worse than a beggar,' replied Sidney. 'Housebreaking's more in my\nline.'\n\nAnd he attempted to force an entrance. Bessie struggled, but had to\ngive in, overcome with laughter. Samuel was enjoying a pipe in the\nfront kitchen; in spite of the dignity of keeping a servant (to whom\nthe back kitchen was sacred), Mr. and Mrs. Byass frequently spent their\nevenings below stairs in the same manner as of old.\n\nThe talk began with Sidney's immediate difficulties.\n\n'Now if it had only happened half a year ago,' said Bessie, 'I should\nhave got you into our first-floor rooms.'\n\n'Shouldn't wonder if we have him there yet, some day,' remarked Sam,\nwinking at his wife.\n\n'Not him,' was Bessie's rejoinder, with a meaning smile. 'He's a cool\nhand, is Mr. Kirkwood. He knows how to wait. When _something_ happens,\nwe shall have him taking a house out at Highbury, you see if he don't.'\n\nSidney turned upon her with anything but a jesting look.\n\n'What do you mean by that, Mrs. Byass?' he asked, sharply. 'When _what_\nhappens? What are you hinting at?'\n\n'Bless us and save us!' cried Bessie. 'Here, Sam, he's going to swallow\nme. What harm have I done?'\n\n'Please tell me what you meant?' Sidney urged, his face expressing\nstrong annoyance. 'Why do you call me a \"cool hand,\" and say that \"I\nknow how to wait\"? What did you mean? I'm serious; I want you to\nexplain.'\n\nWhilst he was speaking there came a knock at the kitchen door. Bessie\ncried, 'Come in,' and Jane showed herself; she glanced in a startled\nway at Sidney, murmured a 'good-evening' to him, and made a request of\nBessie for some trifle she needed. Sidney, after just looking round,\nkept his seat and paid no further attention to Jane, who speedily\nretired.\n\nSilence followed, and in the midst of it Kirkwood pushed his chair\nimpatiently.\n\n'Bess,' cried Samuel, with an affected jocoseness, 'you're called upon\nto apologise. Don't make a fool of yourself again.'\n\n'I don't see why he need be so snappish with me,' replied his wife. 'I\nbeg his pardon, if he wants me.'\n\nBut Sidney was laughing now, though not in a very natural way. He put\nan end to the incident, and led off into talk of quite a different\nkind. When supper-time was at hand he declared that it was impossible\nfor him to stay. The hour had been anything but a lively one, and when\nhe was gone his friends discussed at length this novel display of\nill-humour on Sidney's part.\n\nHe went home muttering to himself, and passed as bad a night as he had\never known. Two days later his removal to new lodgings was effected;\nnotwithstanding his desire to get into a cleaner region, he had taken a\nroom at the top of a house in Red Lion Street, in the densest part of\nClerkenwell, where his neighbours under the same roof were craftsmen,\ncarrying on their business at home.\n\n'It'll do well enough just for a time,' he said to himself. 'Who can\nsay when I shall be really settled again, or whether I ever shall?'\n\nMidway in an attempt to put his things in order, to nail his pictures\non the walls and ring forth his books again, he was seized with such\nutter discouragement that he let a volume drop from his hand and threw\nhimself into a seat. A moan escaped his lips--'That cursed money!'\n\nEver since the disclosure made to him by Michael Snowdon at Danbury he\nhad been sensible of a grave uneasiness respecting his relations with\nJane. At the moment he might imagine himself to share the old man's\nenthusiasm, or dream, or craze--whichever name were the most\nappropriate--but not an hour had passed before he began to lament that\nsuch a romance as this should envelop the life which had so linked\nitself with his own. Immediately there arose in him a struggle between\nthe idealist tendency, of which he had his share, and stubborn everyday\nsense, supported by his knowledge of the world and of his own being--a\nstruggle to continue for months, thwarting the natural current of his\nlife, racking his intellect, embittering his heart's truest emotions.\nConscious of mystery in Snowdon's affairs, he had never dreamed of such\na solution as this; the probability was--so he had thought--that\nMichael received an annuity under the will of his son who died in\nAustralia. No word of the old man's had ever hinted at wealth in his\npossession; the complaints he frequently made of the ill use to which\nwealthy people put their means seemed to imply a regret that he, with\nhis purer purposes, had no power of doing anything. There was no\nexplaining the manner of Jane's bringing-up if it were not necessary\nthat she should be able to support herself; the idea on which Michael\nacted was not such as would suggest itself, even to Sidney's mind.\nDeliberately to withhold education from a girl who was to inherit any\nproperty worth speaking of would be acting with such boldness of\noriginality that Sidney could not seriously have attributed it to his\nfriend. In fact, he did not know Michael until the revelation was made;\nthe depths of the man's character escaped him.\n\nThe struggle went all against idealism. It was a noble vision, that of\nMichael's, but too certainly Jane Snowdon was not the person to make it\na reality; the fearful danger was, that all the possibilities of her\nlife might be sacrificed to a vain conscientiousness. Her character was\nfull of purity and sweetness and self-forgetful warmth, but it had not\nthe strength necessary for the carrying out of a purpose beset with\ndifficulties and perils. Michael, it was true, appeared to be aware of\nthis; it did not, however, gravely disturb him, and for the simple\nreason that not to Jane alone did he look for the completion of his\ndesign; destiny had brought him aid such as he could never have\nanticipated; Jane's helpmate was at hand, in whom his trust was\nunbounded.\n\nWhat was in his way, that Sidney should not accept the responsibility?\nConscience from the first whispered against his doing so, and the\nwhisper was grown to so loud a voice that not an adverse argument could\nget effective hearing. Temptations lurked for him and sprang out in\nmoments of his weakness, but as temptations they were at once\nrecognised. 'He had gone too far to retire; he would be guilty of sheer\ntreachery to Jane; he would break the old man's heart.' All which meant\nmerely that he loved the girl, and that it would be like death to part\nfrom her. But why part? What had conscience got hold of, that it made\nall this clamour? Oh, it was simple enough; Sidney not only had no\nfaith in the practicability of such a life's work as Michael visioned,\nbut he had the profoundest distrust of his own moral strength if he\nshould allow himself to be committed to lifelong renunciation. 'I am no\nhero,' he said, 'no enthusiast. The time when my whole being could be\nstirred by social questions has gone by. I am a man in love, and in\nproportion as my love has strengthened, so has my old artist-self\nrevived in me, until now I can imagine no bliss so perfect as to marry\nJane Snowdon and go off to live with her amid fields and trees, where\nno echo of the suffering world should ever reach us.' To confess this\nwas to make it terribly certain that sooner or later the burden of\nconscientiousness would become intolerable. Not from Jane would support\ncome in that event; she, poor child! I would fall into miserable\nperplexity, in conflict between love and duty, and her life would be\nruined.\n\nOf course a man might have said, 'What matter how things arrange\nthemselves when Michael is past knowledge of them? I will marry the\nwoman I honestly desire, and together we will carry out this\nhumanitarian project so long as it be possible. When it ceases to be\nso, well--.' But Sidney could not take that view. It shamed him beyond\nendurance to think that he must ever avoid Jane's look, because he had\nproved himself dishonest, and, what were worse, had tempted her to\nbecome so.\n\nThe conflict between desire and scruple made every day a weariness.\nInstead of looking forward eagerly to the evening in the week which he\nspent with Michael and Jane, he dreaded its approach. Scarcely had he\nmet Jane's look since this trouble began; he knew that her voice when\nshe spoke to him expressed consciousness of something new in their\nrelations, and even whilst continuing to act his part he suffered\nceaselessly. Had Michael ever repeated to his granddaughter the\nconfession which Sidney would now have given anything to recall? It was\nmore than possible. Of Jane's feeling Sidney could not entertain a\nserious doubt, and he knew that for a long time he had done his best to\nencourage it. It was unpardonable to draw aloof from her just because\nthese circumstances had declared themselves, circumstances which\nbrought perplexity into her life and doubtless made her long for\nanother kind of support than Michael could afford her. The old man\nhimself appeared to be waiting anxiously; he had fallen back into his\nhabit of long silences, and often regarded Sidney in a way which the\nlatter only too well understood.\n\nHe tried to help himself through the time of indecision by saying that\nthere was no hurry. Jane was very young, and with the new order of\nthings her life had in truth only just begun. She must have a space to\nlook about her; all the better if she could form various acquaintances.\nOn that account he urged so strongly that she should be brought into\nrelation with Miss Lant, and, if possible, with certain of Miss Lant's\nfriends. All very well, had not the reasoning been utterly insincere.\nIt might have applied to another person; in Jane's case it was mere\nsophistry. Her nature was home-keeping; to force her into alliance with\nconscious philanthropists was to set her in the falsest position\nconceivable; striving to mould herself to the desires of those she\nloved, she would suffer patiently and in secret mourn for the time when\nshe had been obscure and happy. These things Sidney knew with a\ncertainty only less than that wherewith he judged his own sensations;\nbetween Jane and himself the sympathy was perfect. And in despite of\nscruple he would before long have obeyed the natural impulse of his\nheart, had it not been that still graver complications declared\nthemselves, and by exasperating his over-sensitive pride made him\nreckless of the pain he gave to others so long as his own self-torture\nwas made sufficiently acute.\n\nWith Joseph Snowdon he was doing his best to be on genial terms, but\nthe task was a hard one. The more he saw of Joseph, the less he liked\nhim. Of late the filter manufacturer had begun to strike notes in his\nconversation which jarred on Sidney's sensibilities, and made him\ndisagreeably suspicious that something more was meant than Joseph cared\nto put into plain speech. Since his establishment in business Joseph\nhad become remarkably attentive to his father; he appeared to enter\nwith much zeal into all that concerned Jane; he conversed privately\nwith the old man for a couple of hours at a time, and these dialogues,\nfor some reason or other, he made a point of reporting to Sidney.\nAccording to these reports--and Sidney did not wholly discredit\nthem--Michael was coming to have a far better opinion of his son than\nformerly, was even disposed to speak with him gravely of his dearest\ninterests.\n\n'We talked no end about you, Sidney, last night,' said Joseph on one\noccasion, with the smile, whereby he meant to express the last degree\nof friendly intelligence.\n\nAnd Sidney, though anxiously desiring to know the gist of the\nconversation, in this instance was not gratified. He could not bring\nhimself to put questions, and went away in a mood of vague annoyance\nwhich Joseph had the especial power of exciting.\n\nWith the Byasses, Joseph was forming an intimacy; of this too Sidney\nbecame aware, and it irritated him. The exact source of this irritation\nhe did not at first recognise, but it was disclosed at length\nunmistakably enough, and that on the occasion of the visit recently\ndescribed. Bessie's pleasantry, which roused him in so unwonted a\nmanner, could bear, of course, but one meaning; as soon as he heard it,\nSidney saw as in a flash that one remaining aspect of his position\nwhich had not as yet attracted his concern. The Byasses had learnt, or\nhad been put in the way of surmising, that Michael Snowdon was wealthy;\ninstantly they passed to the reflection that in marrying Jane their old\nacquaintance would be doing an excellent stroke of business. They were\ncoarse-minded, and Bessie could even venture to jest with him on this\ndetestable view of his projects. But was it not very likely that they\nderived their information from Joseph Snowdon? And if so, was it not\nall but certain that Joseph had suggested to them this way of regarding\nSidney himself?\n\nSo when Jane's face appeared at the door he held himself in stubborn\ndisregard of her. A thing impossible to him, he would have said a few\nminutes ago. He revenged himself upon Jane. Good; in this way he was\nlikely to make noble advances.\n\nThe next evening he was due at the Snowdons', and for the very first\ntime he voluntarily kept away. He posted a note to say that the\nbusiness of his removal had made him irregular; he would come next\nweek, when things were settled once more.\n\nThus it came to pass that he sat wretchedly in his unfamiliar room and\ngroaned about 'that accursed money.' His only relief was in bursts of\nanger. Why had he not the courage to go to Michael and say plainly what\nhe thought? 'You have formed a wild scheme, the project of a fanatic.\nIts realisation would be a miracle, and in your heart you must know\nthat Jane's character contains no miraculous possibilities. You are\nplaying with people's lives, as fanatics always do. For Heaven's sake,\nbestow your money on the practical folks who make a solid business of\nrelieving distress! Jane, I know, will bless you for making her as poor\nas ever. Things are going on about you which you do not suspect. Your\nson is plotting, plotting; I can see it. This money will be the cause\nof endless suffering to those you really love, and will never be of as\nmuch benefit to the unknown as if practical people dealt with it. Jane\nis a simple girl, of infinite goodness; what possesses you that you\nwant to make her an impossible sort of social saint?' Too hard to speak\nthus frankly. Michael had no longer the mental pliancy of even six\nmonths ago; his _idea_ was everything to him; as he became weaker, it\nwould gain the dire force of an hallucination. And in the meantime he,\nSidney, must submit to be slandered by that fellow who had his own ends\nto gain.\n\nTo marry Jane, and, at the old man's death, resign every farthing of\nthe money to her trustees, for charitable uses?--But the old pang of\nconscience; the life-long wound to Jane's tender heart.\n\nA day of headache and incapacity, during which it was all he could do\nto attend to his mechanical work, and again the miserable loneliness of\nhis attic. It rained, it rained. He had half a mind to seek refuge at\nsome theatre, but the energy to walk so far was lacking. And whilst he\nstood stupidly abstracted there came a knock at his door.\n\n'I thought I'd just see if you'd got straight,' said Joseph Snowdon,\nentering with his genial smile.\n\nSidney made no reply, but turned as if to stir the fire. Hands in\npockets, Joseph sauntered to a seat.\n\n'Think you'll be comfortable here?' he went on. 'Well, well; of course\nit's only temporary.'\n\n'I don't know about that,' returned Sidney. 'I may stay here as long as\nI was at the last place--eight years.'\n\nJoseph laughed, with exceeding good-nature.\n\n'Oh yes; I shouldn't wonder,' he said, entering into the joke.\n'Still'--becoming serious--'I wish you'd found a pleasanter place. With\nthe winter coming on, you see--'\n\nSidney broke in with splenetic perversity.\n\n'I don't know that I shall pass the winter here. My arrangements are\nall temporary--all of them.'\n\nAfter glancing at him the other crossed his legs and seemed to dispose\nhimself for a stay of some duration.\n\n'You didn't turn up the other night--in Hanover Street.'\n\n'No.'\n\n'I was there. We talked about you. My father has a notion you haven't\nbeen quite well lately. I dare say you're worrying a little, eh?'\n\nSidney remained standing by the fireplace, turned so that his face was\nin shadow.\n\n'Worry? Oh, I don't know,' he replied, idly.\n\n'Well, _I'm_ worried a good deal, Sidney, and that's the fact.'\n\n'What about?'\n\n'All sorts of things. I've meant to have a long talk with you; but then\nI don't quite know how to begin. Well, see, it's chiefly about Jane.'\n\nSidney neither moved nor spoke.\n\n'After all, Sidney,' resumed the other, softening his voice, 'I _am_\nher father, you see. A precious bad one I've been, that there's no\ndenying, and dash it if I don't sometimes feel ashamed of myself. I do\nwhen she speaks to me in that pleasant way she has--you know what I\nmean. For all that, I am her father, and I think it's only right I\nshould do my best to make her happy. You agree with that, I know.'\n\n'Certainly I do.'\n\n'You won't take it ill if I ask whether--in fact, whether you've ever\nasked her--you know what I mean.'\n\n'I have not,' Sidney replied, in a clear, unmoved tone, changing his\nposition at the same time so as to look his interlocutor in the face.\n\nJoseph seemed relieved.\n\n'Still,' he continued, 'you've given her to understand--eh? I suppose\nthere's no secret about that?'\n\n'I've often spoken to her very intimately, but I have used no words\nsuch as you are thinking of. It's quite true that my way of behaving\nhas meant more than ordinary friendship.'\n\n'Yes, yes; you're not offended at me bringing this subject up, old man?\nYou see, I'm her father, after all, and I think we ought to understand\neach other.'\n\n'You are quite right.'\n\n'Well, now, see.' He fidgeted a little. 'Has my father ever told you\nthat his friend the lawyer, Percival, altogether went against that way\nof bringing up Jane?'\n\n'Yes, I know that.'\n\n'You do?' Joseph paused before proceeding. 'To tell you the truth, I\ndon't much care about Percival. I had a talk with him, you know, when\nmy business was being settled. No, I don't quite take to him, so to\nsay. Now, you won't be offended? The fact of the matter is, he asked\nsome rather queer questions about you--or, at all events, if they\nweren't exactly questions, they--they came to the same thing.'\n\nSidney was beginning to glare under his brows. Commonsense told him how\nvery unlikely it was that a respectable solicitor should compromise\nhimself in talk with a stranger, and that such a man as J. J. Snowdon;\nyet, whether the story were true or not, it meant that Joseph was\nplotting in some vile way, and thus confirmed his suspicions. He\ninquired, briefly and indifferently, what Mr. Percival's insinuations\nhad been.\n\n'Well, I told you I don't much care for the fellow. He didn't say as\nmuch, mind, but he seemed to be hinting-like that, as Jane's father, I\nshould do well to--to keep an eye on you--ha, ha! It came to that, I\nthought--though, of course, I may have been mistaken. It shows how\nlittle he knows about you and father. I fancy he'd got it into his head\nthat it was _you_ set father on those plans about Jane--though _why_\nI'd like to know.'\n\nHe paused. Sidney kept his eyes down, and said nothing.\n\n'Well, there's quite enough of that; too much. Still I thought I'd tell\nyou, you see. It's well to know when we've got enemies behind our\nbacks. But see, Sidney; to speak seriously, between ourselves.' He\nleaned forward in the confidential attitude. 'You say you've gone just\na bit further than friendship with our Janey. Well, I don't know a\nbetter man, and that's the truth--but don't you think we might put this\noff for a year or two? Look now, here's this lady, Miss Lant, taking up\nthe girl, and it's an advantage to her; you won't deny that. I\nsympathise with my good old dad; I do, honestly; but I can't help\nthinking that Janey, in her position, ought to see a little of the\nworld. There's no secrets between _us_; you know what she'll have as\nwell as I do. I should be a brute if I grudged it her, after all she's\nsuffered from my neglect. But don't you think we might leave her free\nfor a year or two?'\n\n'Yes, I agree with you.'\n\n'You do? I thought you and I could understand each other, if we only\ngot really talking. Look here, Sidney; I don't mind just whispering to\nyou. For anything I know, Percival is saying disagreeable things to the\nold man; but don't you worry about that. It don't matter a scrap, you\nsee, so long as you and I keep friendly, eh? I'm talking very open to\nyou, but it's all for Janey's sake. If you went and told father I'd\nbeen saying anything against Percival--well, it would make things nasty\nfor me. I've put myself in your hands, but I know the kind of man you\nare. It's only right you should hear of what's said. Don't worry; we'll\njust wait a little, that's all. I mean it all for the little girl's\nsake. It wouldn't be nice if you married her and then she was told--eh?'\n\nSidney looked at the speaker steadily, then stirred the fire and moved\nabout for a few moments. As he kept absolute silence, Joseph, after\nthrowing out a few vague assurances of goodwill and trust, rose to take\nhis leave. Kirkwood shook hands with him, but spoke not a word. Late\nthe same night Sidney penned a letter to Michael Snowdon. In the\nmorning he read it over, and instead of putting it into an envelope,\nlocked it away in one of his drawers.\n\nWhen the evening for his visit to Hanover Street again came round he\nagain absented himself, this time just calling to leave word with the\nservant that business kept him away. The business was that of walking\naimlessly about Clerkenwell, in mud and fog. About ten o'clock he came\nto Farringdon Road Buildings, and with a glance up towards the Hewetts'\nwindow he was passing by when a hand clutched at him. Turning, he saw\nthe face of John Hewett, painfully disturbed, strained in some wild\nemotion.\n\n'Sidney! Come this way; I want to speak to you.'\n\n'Why, what's wrong?'\n\n'Come over here. Sidney--I've found my girl--I've found Clara!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nCLARA'S RETURN\n\nMrs. Eagles, a middle-aged woman of something more than average girth,\nalways took her time in ascending to that fifth storey where she and\nher husband shared a tenement with the Hewett family. This afternoon\nher pause on each landing was longer than usual, for a yellow fog,\nwhich mocked the pale glimmer of gas-jets on the staircase, made her\ngasp asthmatically. She carried, too, a heavy market-bag, having done\nher Saturday purchasing earlier than of wont on account of the\nintolerable weather. She reached the door at length, and being too much\nexhausted to search her pocket for the latchkey, knocked for admission.\nAmy Hewett opened to her, and she sank on a chair in the first room,\nwhere the other two Hewett children were bending over 'home-lessons'\nwith a studiousness not altogether natural. Mrs. Eagles had a shrewd\neye; having glanced at Annie and Tom with a discreet smile, she turned\nher look towards the elder girl, who was standing full in the lamplight.\n\n'Come here, Amy,' she said after a moment's scrutiny. 'So you _will_\nkeep doin' that foolish thing! Very well, then, I shall have to speak\nto your father about it; I'm not goin' to see you make yourself ill and\ndo nothing to prevent you.'\n\nAmy, now a girl of eleven, affected much indignation.\n\n'Why, I haven't touched a drop, Mrs. Eagles!'\n\n'Now, now, now, now, now! Why, your lips are shrivelled up like a bit\nof o' dried orange-peel! You're a silly girl, that's what you are!'\n\nOf late Amy Hewett had become the victim of a singular propensity;\nwhenever she could obtain vinegar, she drank it as a toper does\nspirits. Inadequate nourishment, and especially an unsatisfied palate,\nfrequently have this result in female children among the poor; it is an\nanticipation of what will befall them as soon as they find their way to\nthe publichouse.\n\nHaving administered a scolding, Mrs. Eagles went into the room which\nshe and her husband occupied. It was so encumbered with furniture that\nnot more than eight or ten square feet of floor can have been available\nfor movement. On the bed sat Mr. Eagles, a spare, large-headed, ugly,\nbut very thoughtful-looking man; he and Sidney Kirkwood had been\nacquaintances and fellow-workmen for some years, but no close intimacy\nhad arisen between them, owing to the difference of their tastes and\nviews. Eagles was absorbed in the study of a certain branch of\npolitical statistics; the enthusiasm of his life was Financial Reform.\nEvery budget presented to Parliament he criticised with extraordinary\nthoroughness, and, in fact, with an acumen which would have made him no\ninefficient auxiliary of the Chancellor himself. Of course he took the\nview that the nation's resources were iniquitously wasted, and of\ncourse had little difficulty in illustrating a truth so obvious; what\ndistinguished him from the ordinary malcontent of Clerkenwell Green was\nhis logical faculty and the surprising extent of the information with\nwhich he had furnished himself. Long before there existed a 'Financial\nReform Almanack,' Eagles practically represented that work in his own\nperson. Disinterested, ardent, with thoughts for but one subject in the\nscope of human inquiry, he lived contentedly on his two pounds a week,\nand was for ever engaged in the theoretic manipulation of millions.\nUtopian budgets multiplied themselves in his brain and his note-books.\nHe devised imposts such as Minister never dreamt of, yet which, he\ndeclared, could not fail of vast success. 'You just look at these\nfigures!' he would exclaim to Sidney, in his low, intense voice. 'There\nit is in black and white!' But Sidney's faculties were quite unequal to\ncalculations of this kind, and Eagles could never summon resolve to\nexplain his schemes before an audience. Indefatigably he worked on, and\nthe work had to be its own reward.\n\nHe was busy in the usual way this afternoon, as he sat on the bed,\ncoatless, a trade journal open on his knees. His wife never disturbed\nhim; she was a placid, ruminative woman, generally finding the details\nof her own weekly budget quite a sufficient occupation. When she had\ntaken off her bonnet and was turning out the contents of her bag,\nEagles remarked quietly:\n\n'They'll have a bad journey.'\n\n'What a day for her to be travelling all that distance, poor thing! But\nperhaps it ain't so bad out o' London.'\n\nLowering their voices, they began to talk of John Hewett and the\ndaughter he was bringing from Lancashire, where she had lain in\nhospital for some weeks. Of the girl and her past they knew next to\nnothing, but Hewett's restricted confidences suggested disagreeable\nthings. The truth of the situation was, that John had received by post,\nfrom he knew not whom, a newspaper report of the inquest held on the\nbody of Grace Danver, wherein, of course, was an account of what had\nhappened to Clara Vale; in the margin was pencilled, 'Clara Vale's real\nname is Clara Hewett.' An hour after receiving this John encountered\nSidney Kirkwood. They read the report together. Before the coroner it\nhad been made public that the dead woman was in truth named Rudd; she\nwho was injured refused to give any details concerning herself, and her\nhistory escaped the reporters. Harbouring no doubt of the information\nthus mysteriously sent him--the handwriting seemed to be that of a man,\nbut gave no further hint as to its origin--Hewett the next day\njourneyed down into Lancashire, Sidney supplying him with money. He\nfound Clara in a perilous condition; her face was horribly burnt with\nvitriol, and the doctors could not as yet answer for the results of the\nshock she had suffered. One consolation alone offered itself in the\ncourse of Hewett's inquiries; Clara, if she recovered, would not have\nlost her eyesight. The fluid had been thrown too low to effect the\nworst injury; the accident of a trembling hand, of a movement on her\npart, had kept her eyes untouched.\n\nNecessity brought the father back to London almost at once, but the\nnews sent him at brief intervals continued to be favourable. Now that\nthe girl could be removed from the infirmary, there was no retreat for\nher but her father's home. Mr. Peel, the manager, had made her a\npresent of 20_l_.--it was all he could do; the members of the company\nhad subscribed another 5_l_., generously enough, seeing that their tour\nwas come perforce to an abrupt close. Clara's career as an actress had\nended. . . .\n\nWhen the fog's artificial night deepened at the close of the winter\nevening, Mrs. Eagles made the Hewetts' two rooms as cheerful as might\nbe, expecting every moment the arrival of John and his companion. The\nchildren were aware that an all but forgotten sister was returning to\nthem, and that she had been very ill; they promised quietude. Amy set\nthe tea-table in order, and kept the kettle ready. . . . The knock for\nwhich they were waiting! Mrs. Eagles withdrew into her own room; Amy\nwent to the door.\n\nA tall figure, so wrapped and veiled that nothing but the womanly\noutline could be discerned, entered, supported by John Hewett.\n\n'Is there a light in the other room, Amy?' John inquired in a thick\nvoice.\n\n'Yes, father.'\n\nHe led the muffled form into the chamber where Amy and Annie slept. The\ndoor closed, and for several minutes the three children stood regarding\neach other, alarmed, mute. Then their father joined them. He looked\nabout in an absent way, slowly drew off his overcoat, and when Amy\noffered to take it, bent and kissed her cheek. The girl was startled to\nhear him sob and to see tears starting from his eyes. Turning suddenly\naway, he stood before the fire and made a pretence of warming himself;\nbut his sobs overmastered him. He leaned his arms on the mantel-piece.\n\n'Shall I pour out the tea, father?' Amy ventured to ask, when there was\nagain perfect silence.\n\n'Haven't you had yours?' he replied, half-facing her.\n\n'Not yet.'\n\n'Get it, then--all of you. Yes, you can pour me out a cup--and put\nanother on the little tray. Is this stuff in the saucepan ready?' 'Mrs.\nEagles said it would be in five minutes.'.\n\n'All right. Get on with your eatin', all of you.'\n\nHe went to Mrs. Eagles' room and talked there for a short time.\nPresently Mrs. Eagles herself came out and silently removed from the\nsaucepan a mixture of broth and meat. Having already taken the cup of\ntea to Clara, Hewett now returned to her with this food. She was\nsitting by the fire, her face resting upon her hands. The lamp was\nextinguished; she had said that the firelight was enough. John\ndeposited his burden on the table, then touched her shoulder gently and\nspoke in so soft a voice that one would not have recognised it as his.\n\n'You'll try an' eat a little, my dear? Here's somethin' as has been\nmade particular. After travellin'--just a spoonful or two.'\n\nClara expressed reluctance.\n\n'I don't feel hungry, father. Presently, perhaps.'\n\n'Well, well; it do want to cool a bit. Do you feel able to sit up?'\n\n'Yes. Don't take so much trouble, father. I'd rather you left me alone.'\n\nThe tone was not exactly impatient; it spoke a weary indifference to\neverything and every person.\n\n'Yes, I'll go away, dear. But you'll eat just a bit? If you don't like\nthis, you must tell me, and I'll get something you could fancy.'\n\n'It'll do well enough. I'll eat it presently; I promise you.'\n\nJohn hesitated before going.\n\n'Clara--shall you mind Amy and Annie comin' to sleep here? If you'd\nrather, we'll manage it somehow else.'\n\n'No. What does it matter? They can come when they like, only they\nmustn't want me to talk to them.'\n\nHe went softly from the room, and joined the children at their tea. His\nmood had grown brighter. Though in talking he kept his tone much\nsoftened, there was a smile upon his face, and he answered freely the\nquestions put to him about his journey. Overcome at first by the dark\naspect of this home-coming, he now began to taste the joy of having\nClara under his roof, rescued alike from those vague dangers of the\npast and from the recent peril. Impossible to separate the sorrow he\nfelt for her blighted life, her broken spirit, and the solace lurking\nin the thought that henceforth she could not abandon him. Never a word\nto reproach her for the unalterable; it should be as though there were\nno gap between the old love and its renewal in the present. For Clara\nused to love him, and already she had shown that his tenderness did not\nappeal to her in vain; during the journey she had once or twice pressed\nhis hand in gratitude. How well it was that he had this home in which\nto receive her! Half a year ago, and what should he have done? He would\nnot admit to himself that there were any difficulties ahead; if it came\nto that, he would manage to get some extra work in the evening and on\nSaturday afternoons. He would take Sidney into council. But thereupon\nhis face darkened again, and he lost himself in troubled musing.\n\nMidway in the Sunday morning Amy told him that Clara had risen and\nwould like him to go and sit with her. She would not leave her room;\nAmy had put it in order, and the blind was drawn low. Clara sat by the\nfireside, in her attitude of last night, hiding her face as far as she\nwas able. The beauty of her form would have impressed anyone who\napproached her, the grace of her bent head; but the countenance was no\nlonger that of Clara Hewett; none must now look at her, unless to pity.\nFeeling herself thus utterly changed, she could not speak in her former\nnatural voice; her utterance was oppressed, unmusical, monotonous.\n\nWhen her father had taken a place near her she asked him, 'Have you got\nthat piece of newspaper still?'\n\nHe had, and at her wish produced it. Clara held it in the light of the\nfire, and regarded the pencilled words closely. Then she inquired if he\nwished to keep it, and on his answering in the negative threw it to be\nburnt. Hewett took her hand, and for a while they kept silence.\n\n'Do you live comfortably here, father?' she said presently.\n\n'We do, Clara. It's a bit high up, but that don't matter much.'\n\n'You've got new furniture.'\n\n'Yes, some new things. The old was all done for, you know.'\n\n'And where did you live before you came here?'\n\n'Oh, we had a place in King's Cross Road--it wasn't much of a place,\nbut I suppose it might a' been worse.'\n\n'And that was where--?'\n\n'Yes--yes--it was there.'\n\n'And how did you manage to buy this furniture?' Clara asked, after a\npause.\n\n'Well, my dear, to tell you the truth--it was a friend as--an old\nfriend helped us a bit.'\n\n'You wouldn't care to say who it was?'\n\nJohn was gravely embarrassed. Clara moved her head a little, so as to\nregard him, but at once turned away, shrinkingly, when she met his eyes.\n\n'Why don't you like to tell me, father? Was it Mr. Kirkwood?'\n\n'Yes, my dear, it was.'\n\nNeither spoke for a long time. Clara's head sank lower; she drew her\nhand away from her father's, and used it to shield her face. When she\nspoke, it was as if to herself.\n\n'I suppose he's altered in some ways?'\n\n'Not much; I don't see much change, myself, but then of course-- No,\nhe's pretty much the same.'\n\n'He's married, isn't he?\n\n'Married? Why, what made you think that. Clara? No, not he. He had to\nmove not long ago; his lodgin's is in Red Lion Street now.'\n\n'And does he ever come here?'\n\n'He has been--just now an' then.'\n\n'Have you told him?'\n\n'Why--yes, dear--I felt I had to.'\n\n'There's no harm. You couldn't keep it a secret. But he mustn't come\nwhilst I'm here; you understand that, father?'\n\n'No, no, he shan't. He shall never come, if you don't wish it.'\n\n'Only whilst I'm here.'\n\n'But--Clara--you'll _always_ be here.'\n\n'Oh no! Do you think I'm going to burden you all the rest of my life? I\nshall find some way of earning a living, and then I shall go and get a\nroom for myself.'\n\n'Now don't--now don't talk like that!' exclaimed her father, putting\nhis hand on her. 'You shall do what else you like, my girl, but don't\ntalk about goin' away from me. That's the one thing as I couldn't bear.\nI ain't so young as I was, and I've had things as was hard to go\nthrough--I mean when the mother died and--and other things at that\ntime. Let you an' me stay by each other whilst we may, my girl. You\nknow it was always you as I thought most of, and I want to keep you by\nme--I do, Clara. You won't speak about goin' away?'\n\nShe remained mute. Shadows from the firelight rose and fell upon the\nwalls of the half-darkened room. It was a cloudy morning; every now and\nthen a gust flung rain against the window.\n\n'If you went,' he continued, huskily, 'I should be afraid myself. I\nhaven't told you. I didn't behave as I'd ought have done to the poor\nmother, Clara; I got into drinkin' too much; yes, I did. I've broke\nmyself off that; but if you was to leave me--I've had hard things to go\nthrough. Do you know the Burial Club broke up just before she died? I\ncouldn't get not a ha'penny! A lot o' the money was stolen. You may\nthink how I felt, Clara, with her lyin' there, and I hadn't got as much\nas would pay for a coffin. It was Sidney Kirkwood found the money--he\ndid! There was never man had as good a friend as he's been to me; I\nshall never have a chance of payin' what I owe him. Things is better\nwith me now, but I'd rather beg my bread in the streets than you should\ngo away. Don't be afraid, my dearest. I promise you nobody shan't come\nnear. You won't mind Mrs. Eagles; she's very good to the children. But\nI must keep you near to me, my poor girl!'\n\nPerhaps sit was that word of pity--though the man's shaken voice was\nthroughout deeply moving. For the first time since the exultant hope of\nher life was blasted, Clara shed tears.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nTHE SOUP-KITCHEN\n\nWith the first breath of winter there passes a voice half-menacing,\nhalf-mournful, through all the barren ways and phantom-haunted refuges\nof the nether world. Too quickly has vanished the brief season when the\nsky is clement, when a little food suffices, and the chances of earning\nthat little are more numerous than at other times; this wind that gives\nutterance to its familiar warning is the vaunt-courier of cold and\nhunger and solicitude that knows not sleep. Will the winter be a hard\none? It is the question that concerns this world before all others,\nthat occupies alike the patient workfolk who have yet their home\nunbroken, the strugglers foredoomed to loss of such scant needments as\nthe summer gifted them withal, the hopeless and the self-abandoned and\nthe lurking creatures of prey. To all of them the first chill breath\nfrom a lowering sky has its voice of admonition; they set their faces;\nthey sigh, or whisper a prayer, or fling out a curse, each according to\nhis nature.\n\nAnd as though the strife here were not already hard enough, behold from\nmany corners of the land come needy emigrants, prospectless among their\nown people, fearing the dark season which has so often meant for them\nthe end of wages and of food, tempted hither by thought that in the\nshadow of palaces work and charity are both more plentiful. Vagabonds,\ntoo, no longer able to lie about the country roads, creep back to their\nremembered lairs and join the combat for crusts flung forth by casual\nhands. Day after day the stress becomes more grim. One would think that\nhosts of the weaker combatants might surely find it seasonable to let\nthemselves be trodden out of existence, and so make room for those of\nmore useful sinew; somehow they cling to life; so few in comparison\nyield utterly. The thoughtful in the world above look about them with\ncontentment when carriage-ways are deep with new-fallen snow. 'Good;\nhere is work for the unemployed.' Ah, if the winter did but last a few\nmonths longer, if the wonted bounds of endurance were but, by some\nfreak of nature, sensibly overpassed, the carriage-ways would find\nanother kind of sweeping! . . .\n\nThis winter was the last that Shooter's Gardens were destined to know.\nThe leases had all but run out; the middlemen were garnering their\nlatest profits; in the spring there would come a wholesale demolition,\nand model-lodgings would thereafter occupy the site. Meanwhile the\nGardens looked their surliest; the walls stood in a perpetual black\nsweat; a mouldy reek came from the open doorways; the beings that\npassed in and out seemed soaked with grimy moisture, puffed into\ndistortions, hung about with rotting garments. One such was Mrs. Candy,\nPennyloaf's mother. Her clothing consisted of a single gown and a shawl\nmade out of the fragments of an old counterpane; her clothing--with\nexception of the shoes on her feet, those two articles were literally\nall that covered her bare body. Rage for drink was with her reaching\nthe final mania. Useless to bestow anything upon her; straightway it or\nits value passed over the counter of the beershop in Rosoman Street.\nShe cared only for beer, the brave, thick, medicated draught, that was\nso cheap and frenzied her so speedily.\n\nHer husband was gone for good. One choking night of November he beat\nher to such purpose that she was carried off to the police-station as\ndead; the man effected his escape, and was not likely to show himself\nin the Gardens again. With her still lived her son Stephen, the potman.\nHis payment was ten shillings a week (with a daily allowance of three\npints), and he saw to it that there was always a loaf of bread in the\nroom they occupied together. Stephen took things with much philosophy;\nhis mother would, of course, drink herself to death--what was there\nastonishing in that? He himself had heart disease, and surely enough\nwould drop down dead one of these days; the one doom was no more to be\nquarrelled with than the other. Pennyloaf came to see them at very long\nintervals; what was the use of making her visits more frequent? She,\ntoo, viewed with a certain equanimity the progress of her mother's\nfate. Vain every kind of interposition; worse than imprudence to give\nthe poor creature money or money's worth. It could only be hoped that\nthe end would come before very long.\n\nAn interesting house, this in which Mrs. Candy resided. It contained in\nall seven rooms, and each room was the home of a family; under the roof\nslept twenty-five persons, men, women, and children; the lowest rent\npaid by one of these domestic groups was four-and-sixpence. You would\nhave enjoyed a peep into the rear chamber on the ground floor. There\ndwelt a family named Hope--Mr. and Mrs. Hope, Sarah Hope, aged fifteen,\nDick Hope, aged twelve, Betsy Hope, aged three. The father was a\ncripple; he and his wife occupied themselves in the picking of rags--of\ncourse at home--and I can assure you that the atmosphere of their abode\nwas worthy of its aspect. Mr. Hope drank, but not desperately. His\nforte was the use of language so peculiarly violent that even in\nShooter's Gardens it gained him a proud reputation. On the slightest\nexcuse he would threaten to brain one of his children, to disembowel\nanother, to gouge out the eyes of the third. He showed much ingenuity\nin varying the forms of menaced punishment. Not a child in the Gardens\nbut was constantly threatened by its parents with a violent death; this\nwas so familiar that it had lost its effect; where the nurse or mother\nin the upper world cries, 'I shall scold you!' in the nether the phrase\nis, 'I'll knock yer 'ed orff!' To 'I shall be very angry with you' in\nthe one sphere, corresponds in the other, 'I'll murder you!' These are\nconventions--matters of no importance. But Mr. Rope was a man of\nindividuality; he could make his family tremble; he could bring lodgers\nabout the door to listen and admire his resources.\n\nIn another room abode a mother with four children. This woman drank\nmoderately, but was very conscientious in despatching her three younger\nchildren to school. True, there was just a little inconvenience in this\npunctuality of hers, at all events from the youngsters' point of view,\nfor only on the first three days of the week had they the slightest\nchance of a mouthful of breakfast before they departed. 'Never mind,\nI'll have some dinner for you,' their parent was wont to say. Common\nenough in the Board schools, this pursuit of knowledge on an empty\nstomach. But then the end is so inestimable!\n\nYet another home. It was tenanted by two persons only; they appeared to\nbe man and wife, but in the legal sense were not so, nor did they for a\nmoment seek to deceive their neighbours. With the female you are\nslightly acquainted; christened Sukey Jollop, she first became Mrs.\nJack Bartley, and now, for courtesy's sake, was styled Mrs. Higgs.\nSukey had strayed on to a downward path; conscious of it, she abandoned\nherself to her taste for strong drink, and braved out her degradation.\nJealousy of Clem Peckover was the first cause of discord between her\nand Jack Bartley; a robust young woman, she finally sent Jack about his\nbusiness by literal force of arms, and entered into an alliance with\nNed Higgs, a notorious swashbuckler, the captain of a gang of young\nruffians who at this date were giving much trouble to the Clerkenwell\npolice. Their speciality was the skilful use, as an offensive weapon,\nof a stout leathern belt heavily buckled; Mr. Higgs boasted that with\none stroke of his belt he could, if it seemed good to him, kill his\nman, but the fitting opportunity for this display of prowess had not\nyet offered. . . .\n\nNow it happened that, at the time of her making Jane Snowdon's\nacquaintance, Miss Lant was particularly interested in Shooter's\nGardens and the immediate vicinity. She had associated herself with\ncertain ladies who undertook the control of a soup-kitchen in the\nneighbourhood, and as the winter advanced she engaged Jane in this work\nof charity. It was a good means, as Michael Snowdon agreed, of enabling\nthe girl to form acquaintances among the very poorest, those whom she\nhoped to serve effectively--not with aid of money alone, but by her\npersonal influence. And I think it will be worth while to dwell a\nlittle on the story of this same soup-kitchen; it is significant, and\nshall take the place of abstract comment on Miss Lant's philanthropic\nenterprises.\n\nThe kitchen had been doing successful work for some years; the society\nwhich established it entrusted its practical conduct to very practical\npeople, a man and wife who were themselves of the nether world, and\nknew the ways thereof. The 'stock' which formed the basis of the soup\nwas wholesome and nutritious; the peas were of excellent quality;\ntwopence a quart was the price at which this fluid could be purchased\n(one penny if a ticket from a member of the committee were presented),\nand sometimes as much as five hundred quarts would be sold in a day.\nSatisfactory enough this. When the people came with complaints, saying\nthat they were tired of this particular soup, and would like another\nkind for a change, Mr. and Mrs. Batterby, with perfect understanding of\nthe situation, bade their customers 'take it or leave it--an' none o'\nyour cheek here, or you won't get nothing at all!' The result was much\ngood-humour all round.\n\nBut the present year saw a change in the constitution of the committee:\ntwo or three philanthropic ladies of great conscientiousness began to\ninquire busily into the working of the soup-kitchen, and they soon\nfound reason to be altogether dissatisfied with Mr. and Mrs. Batterby.\nNo, no; these managers were of too coarse a type; they spoke grossly;\nwhat possibility of their exerting a humanising influence on the people\nto whom they dispensed soup? Soup and refinement must be disseminated\nat one and the same time, over the same counter. Mr. and Mrs. Batterby\nwere dismissed, and quite a new order of things began. Not only were\nthe ladies zealous for a high ideal in the matter of soup-distributing,\nthey also aimed at practical economy in the use of funds. Having\nengaged a cook after their own hearts, and acting upon the advice of\ncompetent physiologists, they proceeded to make a 'stock' out of\nsheep's and bullocks' heads; moreover, they ordered their peas from the\nCity, thus getting them at two shillings a sack less than the price\nformerly paid by the Batterbys to a dealer in Clerkenwell. But, alas!\nthese things could not be done secretly; the story leaked out;\nShooter's Gardens and vicinity broke into the most excited feeling. I\nneed not tell you that the nether world will consume--when others\nsupply it--nothing but the very finest quality of food, that the heads\nof sheep and bullocks are peculiarly offensive to its stomach, that a\nsaving effected on sacks of peas outrages its dearest sensibilities.\nWhat was the result? Shooter's Gardens, convinced of the fraud\npractised upon them, nobly brought back their quarts of soup to the\nkitchen, and with proud independence of language demanded to have their\nmoney returned. On being met with a refusal, they--what think\nyou?--emptied the soup on to the floor, and went away with heads\nexalted.\n\nVast was the indignation of Miss Lant and the other ladies. 'This is\ntheir gratitude!' Now if you or I had been there, what an opportunity\nfor easing our minds! 'Gratitude, mesdames? You have entered upon this\nwork with expectation of gratitude?--And can you not perceive that\nthese people of Shooter's Gardens are poor, besotted, disease-struck\ncreatures, of whom--in the mass--scarcely a human quality is to be\nexpected? Have you still to learn what this nether world has been made\nby those who belong to the sphere above it?--Gratitude, quotha?--Nay,\ndo _you_ be grateful that these hapless, half-starved women do not turn\nand rend you. At present they satisfy themselves with insolence. Take\nit silently, you who at all events hold some count of their dire state;\nand endeavour to feed them without arousing their animosity!'\n\nWell, the kitchen threatened to be a failure. It turned out that the\ncheaper peas were, in fact, of inferior quality, and the ladies\nhastened to go back to the dealer in Clerkenwell. This was something,\nbut now came a new trouble; the complaint with which Mr. and Mrs.\nBatterby had known so well how to deal revived in view of the\nconcessions made by the new managers. Shooter's Gardens would have no\nmore peas; let some other vegetable be used. Again the point was\nconceded; a trial was made of barley soup. Shooter's Gardens came,\nlooked, smelt, and shook their heads. 'It don't look nice,' was their\ncomment; they would none of it.\n\nFor two or three weeks, just at this crisis in the kitchen's fate, Jane\nSnowdon attended with Miss Lant to help in the dispensing of the\ndecoction. Jane was made very nervous by the disturbances that went on,\nbut she was able to review the matter at issue in a far more fruitful\nway than Miss Lant and the other ladies. Her opinion was not asked,\nhowever. In the homely grey dress, with her modest, retiring manner,\nher gentle, diffident countenance, she was taken by the customers for a\npaid servant, and if ever it happened that she could not supply a can\nof soup quickly enough sharp words reached her ear. 'Now then, you\ngyurl there! Are you goin' to keep me all d'y? I've got somethink else\nto do but stand 'ere.' And Jane, by her timid hastening, confirmed the\noriginal impression, with the result that she was treated yet more\nunceremoniously next time. Of all forms of insolence there is none more\nflagrant than that of the degraded poor receiving charity which they\nhave come to regard as a right.\n\nJane did speak at length. Miss Lant had called to see her in Hanover\nStreet; seated quietly in her own parlour, with Michael Snowdon to\napprove--with him she had already discussed the matter--Jane ventured\nsoftly to compare the present state of things and that of former\nwinters, as described to her by various people.\n\n'Wasn't it rather a pity,' she suggested, 'that the old people were\nsent away?'\n\n'You think so?' returned Miss Lant, with the air of one to whom a novel\nthought is presented. 'You really think so, Miss Snowdon?'\n\n'They got on so well with everybody,' Jane continued. 'And don't you\nthink it's better, Miss Lant, for everybody to feel satisfied?'\n\n'But really, Mr. Batterby used to speak so very harshly. He destroyed\ntheir self-respect.'\n\n'I don't think they minded it,' said Jane, with simple good faith. 'And\nI'm always hearing them wish he was back, instead of the new managers.'\n\n'I think we shall have to consider this,' remarked the lady,\nthoughtfully.\n\nConsidered it was, and with the result that the Batterbys before long\nfound themselves in their old position, uproariously welcomed by\nShooter's Gardens. In a few weeks the soup was once more concocted of\nfamiliar ingredients, and customers, as often as they grumbled, had the\npleasure of being rebuked in their native tongue.\n\nIt was with anything but a cheerful heart that Jane went through this\ninitiation into the philanthropic life. Her brief period of joy and\nconfidence was followed by a return of anxiety, which no resolve could\nsuppress. It was not only that the ideals to which she strove to form\nherself made no genuine appeal to her nature; the imperative hunger of\nher heart remained unsatisfied. At first, when the assurance received\nfrom Michael began to lose a little of its sustaining force, she could\nsay to herself, 'Patience, patience; be faithful, be trustful, and your\nreward will soon come.' Nor would patience have failed her had but the\ncurrent of life flowed on in the old way. It was the introduction of\nnew and disturbing things that proved so great a test of fortitude.\nThose two successive absences of Sidney on the appointed evening were\nstrangely unlike him, but perhaps could be explained by the\nunsettlement of his removal; his manner when at length he did come\nproved that the change in himself was still proceeding. Moreover, the\nchange affected Michael, who manifested increase of mental trouble at\nthe same time that he yielded more and more to physical infirmity.\n\nThe letter which Sidney wrote after receiving Joseph Snowdon's\nconfidential communications was despatched two days later. He expressed\nhimself in carefully chosen words, but the purport of the letter was to\nmake known that he no longer thought of Jane save as a friend; that the\nchange in her position had compelled him to take another view of his\nrelations to her than that he had confided to Michael at Danbury. Most\nfortunately--he added--no utterance of his feelings had ever escaped\nhim to Jane herself, and henceforth he should be still more careful to\navoid any suggestion of more than brotherly interest. In very deed\nnothing was altered; he was still her steadfast friend, and would\nalways aid her to his utmost in the work of her life.\n\nThat Sidney could send this letter, after keeping it in reserve for a\ncouple of days, proved how profoundly his instincts were revolted by\nthe difficulties and the ambiguity of his position. It had been bad\nenough when only his own conscience was in play; the dialogue with\nJoseph, following upon Bessie Byass's indiscretion, threw him wholly\noff his balance, and he could give no weight to any consideration but\nthe necessity of recovering self-respect. Even the sophistry of that\nrepeated statement that he had never approached Jane as a lover did not\ntrouble him in face of the injury to his pride. Every word of Joseph\nSnowdon's transparently artful hints was a sting to his sensitiveness;\nthe sum excited him to loathing. It was as though the corner of a\ncurtain had been raised, giving him a glimpse of all the vile greed,\nthe base machination, hovering about this fortune that Jane was to\ninherit. Of Scawthorne he knew nothing, but his recollection of the\nPeckovers was vivid enough to suggest what part Mrs. Joseph Snowdon was\nplaying in the present intrigues, and he felt convinced that in the\nbackground were other beasts of prey, watching with keen, envious eyes.\nThe sudden revelation was a shock from which he would not soon recover;\nhe seemed to himself to be in a degree contaminated; he questioned his\nmost secret thoughts again and again, recognizing with torment the\nfears which had already bidden him draw back; he desired to purify\nhimself by some unmistakable action.\n\nThat which happened he had anticipated. On receipt of the letter\nMichael came to see him; he found the old man waiting in front of the\nhouse when he returned to Red Lion Street after his work. The\nconversation that followed was a severe test of Sidney's resolve. Had\nMichael disclosed the fact of his private understanding with Jane,\nSidney would probably have yielded; but the old man gave no hint of\nwhat he had done--partly because he found it difficult to make the\nadmission, partly in consequence of an indecision in his own mind with\nregard to the very point at issue. Though agitated by the consciousness\nof suffering in store for Jane, his thoughts disturbed by the\nderangement of a part of his plan, he did not feel that Sidney's change\nof mind gravely affected the plan itself. Age had cooled his blood;\nenthusiasm had made personal interests of comparatively small account\nto him; he recognised his granddaughter's feeling, but could not\nappreciate its intensity, its surpreme significance. When Kirkwood made\na show of explaining himself, saying that he shrank from that form of\nresponsibility, that such a marriage suggested to him many and\ninsuperable embarrassments, Michael began to reflect that perchance\nthis was the just view. With household and family cares, could Jane\ndevote herself to the great work after the manner of his ideal? Had he\nnot been tempted by his friendship for Sidney to introduce into his\nscheme what was really an incompatible element? Was it not decidedly,\ninfinitely better that Jane should be unmarried?\n\nMichael had taken the last step in that process of dehumanisation which\nthreatens idealists of his type. He had reached at length the pass of\nthose frenzied votaries of a supernatural creed who exact from their\ndisciples the sacrifice of every human piety. Returning home, he\nmurmured to himself again and again, 'She must not marry. She must\novercome this desire of a happiness such as ordinary women may enjoy.\nFor my sake, and for the sake of her suffering fellow-creatures, Jane\nmust win this victory over herself.'\n\nHe purposed speaking to her, but put it off from day to day. Sidney\npaid his visits as usual, and tried desperately to behave as though he\nhad no trouble. Could he have divined why it was that Michael had ended\nby accepting his vague pretences with apparent calm, indignation,\nwrath, would have possessed him; he believed, however, that the old man\nout of kindness subdued what he really felt. Sidney's state was\npitiable. He knew not whether he more shrank from the thought of being\ninfected with Joseph Snowdon's baseness or despised himself for his\nattitude to Jane. Despicable entirely had been his explanations to\nMichael, but how could he make them more sincere? To tell the whole\ntruth, to reveal Joseph's tactics would be equivalent to taking a part\nin the dirty contest; Michael would probably do him justice, but who\ncould say how far Joseph's machinations were becoming effectual? The\nslightest tinct of uncertainty in the old man's thought, and he,\nKirkwood, became a plotter, like the others, meeting mine with\ncountermine.\n\n'There will be no possibility of perfect faith between men until there\nis no such thing as money! H'm, and when is that likely to come to\npass?'\n\nThus he epigrammatised to himself one evening, savagely enough, as with\nhead bent forward he plodded to Red Lion Street. Some one addressed\nhim; he looked up and saw Jane. Seemingly it was a chance meeting, but\nshe put a question at once almost as though she had been waiting for\nhim. 'Have you seen Pennyloaf lately, Mr. Kirkwood?'\n\nPennyloaf? The name suggested Bob Hewett, who again suggested John\nHewett, and so Sidney fell upon thoughts of some one who two days ago\nhad found a refuge in John's home. To Michael he had said nothing of\nwhat he knew concerning Clara; a fresh occasion of uneasy thought. Bob\nHewett--so John said--had no knowledge of his sister's situation,\notherwise Pennyloaf might have come to know about it, and in that case,\nperchance, Jane herself. Why not? Into what a wretched muddle of\nconcealments and inconsistencies and insincerities had he fallen!\n\n'It's far too long since I saw her,' he replied, in that softened tone\nwhich he found it impossible to avoid when his eyes met Jane's.\n\nShe was on her way home from the soup-kitchen, where certain\noccupations had kept her much later than usual; this, however, was far\nout of her way, and Sidney remarked on the fact, perversely, when she\nhad offered this explanation of her meeting him, Jane did not reply.\nThey walked on together, towards Islington.\n\n'Are you going to help at that place all the winter?' he inquired.\n\n'Yes; I think so.'\n\nIf he had spoken his thought, he would have railed against the\nsoup-kitchen and all that was connected with it. So far had he got in\nhis revolt against circumstances; Jane's 'mission' was hateful to him;\nhe could not bear to think of her handing soup over a counter to ragged\nwretches.\n\n'You're nothing like as cheerful as you used to be, he said, suddenly,\nand all but roughly. 'Why is it?'\n\nWhat a question! Jane reddened as she tried to look at him with a\nsmile; no words would come to her tongue.\n\n'Do you go anywhere else, besides to--to that place?'\n\nNot often. She had accompanied Miss Lant on a visit to some people in\nShooter's Gardens.\n\nSidney bent his brows. A nice spot, Shooter's Gardens.\n\n'The houses are going to be pulled down, I'm glad to say,' continued\nJane. 'Miss Lant thinks it'll be a good opportunity for helping a few\nof the families into better lodgings. We're going to buy furniture for\nthem--so many have as good as none at all, you know. It'll be a good\nstart for them, won't it?'\n\nSidney nodded. He was thinking of another family who already owed their\nfurniture to Jane's beneficence, though they did not know it.\n\n'Mind you don't throw away kindness on worthless people,' he said\npresently.\n\n'We can only do our best, and hope they'll keep comfortable for their\nown sakes.'\n\n'Yes, yes. Well, I'll say good-night to you here. Go home and rest; you\nlook tired.'\n\nHe no longer called her by her name. Tearing himself away, with a last\nlook, he raged inwardly that so sweet and gentle a creature should be\ncondemned to such a waste of her young life.\n\nJane had obtained what she came for. At times the longing to see him\ngrew insupportable, and this evening she had yielded to it, going out\nof her way in the hope of encountering him as he came from work. He\nspoke very strangely. What did it all mean, and when would this winter\nof suspense give sign of vanishing before sunlight?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nPHANTOMS\n\nMr. and Mrs. Joseph Snowdon were now established in rooms in Burton\nCrescent, which is not far from King's Cross. Joseph had urged that\nClerkenwell Close was scarcely a suitable quarter for a man of his\nstanding, and, though with difficulty, he had achieved thus much\ndeliverance. Of Clem he could not get rid--just yet; but it was\nsomething to escape Mrs. Peckover's superintendence. Clem herself\nfavoured the removal, naturally for private reasons. Thus far working\nin alliance with her shrewd mother, she was now forming independent\nprojects. Mrs. Peckover's zeal was assuredly not disinterested, and\nwhy, Clem mused with herself, should the fruits of strategy be shared?\nHer husband's father could not, she saw every reason to believe, be\nmuch longer for this world. How his property was to be divided she had\nno means of discovering; Joseph professed to have no accurate\ninformation, but as a matter of course he was deceiving her. Should he\ninherit a considerable sum, it was more than probable he would think of\nagain quitting his native land--and without encumbrances. That movement\nmust somehow be guarded against; how, it was difficult as yet to\ndetermine. In the next place, Jane was sure to take a large share of\nthe fortune. To that Clem strongly objected, both on abstract grounds\nand because she regarded Jane with a savage hatred--a hatred which had\nits roots in the time of Jane's childhood, and which had grown in\nproportion as the girl reaped happiness from life. The necessity of\ncloaking this sentiment had not, you may be sure, tended to mitigate\nit. Joseph said that there was no longer any fear of a speedy marriage\nbetween Jane and Kirkwood, but that such a marriage would come off some\nday,--if not prevented--Clem held to be a matter of certainty. Sidney\nKirkwood was a wide-awake young man; of course he had his satisfactory\nreasons for delay. Now Clem's hatred of Sidney was, from of old, only\nless than that wherewith she regarded Jane. To frustrate the hopes of\nthat couple would be a gratification worth a good deal of risk.\n\nShe heard nothing of what had befallen Clara Hewett until the latter's\nreturn home, and then not from her husband. Joseph and Scawthorne,\nfoiled by that event in an ingenious scheme which you have doubtless\nunderstood (they little knowing how easily the severance between Jane\nand Kirkwood might be effected), agreed that it was well to get Clara\nrestored to her father's household--for, though it seemed unlikely, it\nwas not impossible that she might in one way or another aid their\nschemes--and on that account the anonymous letter was despatched which\ninformed John Hewett of his daughter's position. Between John and\nSnowdon, now that they stood in the relations of master and servant,\nthere was naturally no longer familiar intercourse, and, in begging\nleave of absence for his journey northwards, Hewett only said that a\nnear relative had met with a bad accident. But it would be easy, Joseph\ndecided, to win the man's confidence again, and thus be apprised of all\nthat went on. With Clem he kept silence on the subject; not improbably\nshe would learn sooner or later what had happened, and indeed, as\nthings now stood, it did not matter much; but on principle he excluded\nher as much as possible from his confidence. He knew she hated him, and\nhe was not backward in returning the sentiment, though constantly\naffecting a cheerful friendliness in his manner to her; after all,\ntheir union was but temporary. In Hanover Street he was also silent\nregarding the Hewetts, for there his role was that of a good,\nsimple-minded fellow, incapable of intrigue, living for the domestic\naffections. If Kirkwood chose to speak to Michael or Jane of the\nmatter, well, one way or another, that would advance things a stage,\nand there was nothing for it but to watch the progress.\n\nAlone all through the day, and very often in the evening Clem was not\nat all disposed to occupy herself in domestic activity. The lodgings\nwere taken furnished, and a bondmaid of the house did such work as was\nindispensable. Dirt and disorder were matters of indifference to the\npair, who represented therein the large class occupying cheap London\nlodgings; an impure atmosphere, surroundings more or less squalid,\nconstant bickering with the landlady, coarse usage of the\nservant--these things Clem understood as necessaries of independent\nlife, and it would have cost her much discomfort had she been required\nto live in a more civilised manner. Her ambitions were essentially\ngross. In the way of social advancement she appreciated nothing but an\nincreased power of spending money, and consequently of asserting\nherself over others. She had no desire whatever to enter a higher class\nthan that in which she was born; to be of importance in her familiar\ncircle was the most she aimed at. In visiting the theatre, she did not\nso much care to occupy a superior place--indeed, such a position made\nher ill at ease--as to astonish her neighbours in the pit by a lavish\nstyle of costume, by loud remarks implying a free command of cash, by\npurchase between the acts of something expensive to eat or drink.\nNeedless to say that she never read anything but police news; in the\nfiction of her world she found no charm, so sluggishly unimaginative\nwas her nature. Till of late she had either abandoned herself all day\nlong to a brutal indolence, eating rather too much, and finding quite\nsufficient occupation for her slow brain in the thought of how pleasant\nit was not to be obliged to work, and occasionally in reviewing the\nchances that she might eventually have plenty of money and no Joseph\nSnowdon as a restraint upon her; or else, her physical robustness\ndemanding exercise, she walked considerable distances about the\nlocalities she knew, calling now and then upon an acquaintance.\n\nTill of late; but a change had come upon her life. It was now seldom\nthat she kept the house all day; when within doors she was restless,\nquarrelsome. Joseph became aware with surprise that she no longer tried\nto conceal her enmity against him; on a slight provocation she broke\ninto a fierceness which reminded him of the day when he undeceived her\nas to his position, and her look at such times was murderous. It might\ncome, he imagined, of her being released from the prudent control of\nher mother. However, again a few weeks and things were somewhat\nimproved; she eyed him like a wild beast, but was less frequent in her\noutbreaks. Here, too, it might be that Mrs. Peckover's influence was at\nwork, for Clara spent at least four evenings of the seven away from\nhome, and always said she had been at the Close. As indifferent as it\nwas possible to be, Joseph made no attempt to restrain her\nindependence; indeed he was glad to have her out of his way.\n\nWe must follow her on one of these evenings ostensibly passed at Mrs.\nPeckover's--no, not follow, but discover her at nine o'clock.\n\nIn Old Street, not far from Shoreditch Station, was a shabby little\nplace of refreshment, kept by an Italian; pastry and sweet-stuff filled\nthe window; at the back of the shop, through a doorway on each side of\nwhich was looped a pink curtain, a room, furnished with three\nmarble-topped tables, invited those who wished to eat and drink more at\nease than was possible before the counter. Except on Sunday evening\nthis room was very little used, and there, on the occasion of which I\nspeak, Clem was sitting with Bob Hewett. They had been having supper\ntogether--French pastry and a cup of cocoa.\n\nShe leaned forward on her elbows, and said imperatively, 'Tell\nPennyloaf to make it up with her again.'\n\n'Why?'\n\n'Because I want to know what goes on in Hanover Street. You was a fool\nto send her away, and you'd ought to have told me about it before now.\nIf they was such friends, I suppose the girl told her lots o' things.\nBut I expect they see each other just the same. You don't suppose she\ndoes all _you_ tell her?'\n\n'I'll bet you what you like she does!' cried Bob.\n\nClem glared at him.\n\n'Oh, you an' your Pennyloaf! Likely she tells you the truth. You're so\nfond of each other, ain't you! Tells you everything, does she?--and the\nway you treat her!'\n\n'Who's always at me to make me treat her worse still?' Bob retorted\nhalf angrily, half in expostulation.\n\n'Well, and so I am, 'cause I hate the name of her! I'd like to hear as\nyou starve her and her brats half to death. How much money did you give\nher last week? Now you just tell me the truth. How much was it?'\n\n'How can I remember? Three or four bob, I s'pose.'\n\n'Three or four bob!' she repeated, snarling. 'Give her one, and make\nher live all the week on it. Wear her down! Make her pawn all she has,\nand go cold!'\n\nHer cheeks were on fire; her eyes started in the fury of jealousy; she\nset her teeth together.\n\n'I'd better do for her altogether,' said Bob, with an evil grin.\n\nClem looked at him, without speaking; kept her gaze on him; then she\nsaid in a thick voice:\n\n'There's many a true word said in joke.'\n\nBob moved uncomfortably. There was a brief silence, then the other,\nputting her face nearer his:\n\n'Not just yet. I want to use her to get all I can about that girl and\nher old beast of a grandfather. Mind you do as I tell you. Pennyloaf's\nto have her back again, and she's to make her talk, and you're to get\nall you can from Pennyloaf--understand?'\n\nThere came noises from the shop. Three work-girls had just entered and\nwere buying cakes, which they began to eat at the counter. They were\nloud in gossip and laughter, and their voices rang like brass against\nbrass. Clem amused herself in listening to them for a few minutes; then\nshe became absent, moving a finger round and round on her plate. A\ndisagreeable flush still lingered under her eyes.\n\n'Have you told her about Clara?'\n\n'Told who?'\n\n'Who? Pennyloaf, of course.'\n\n'No, I haven't. Why should I?'\n\n'Oh, you're such a affectionate couple! See, you're only to give her\ntwo shillin's next week. Let her go hungry this nice weather.'\n\n'She won't do that if Jane Snowdon comes back, so there you're out of\nit!'\n\nClem bit her lip.\n\n'What's the odds? Make it up with a hit in the mouth now and then.'\n\n'What do you expect to know from that girl?' inquired Bob.\n\n'Lots o' things. I want to know what the old bloke's goin' to do with\nhis money, don't I? And I want to know what my beast of a 'usband's got\nout of him. And I want to know what that feller Kirkwood's goin' to do.\nHe'd ought to marry your sister by rights.'\n\n'Not much fear of that now.'\n\n'Trust him! He'll stick where there's money. See, Bob; if that Jane was\nto kick the bucket, do you think the old bloke 'ud leave it all to Jo?'\n\n'How can I tell?'\n\n'Well, look here. Supposin' he died an' left most to her; an' then\nsupposin' _she_ was to go off; would Jo have all her tin?'\n\n'Course he would.'\n\nClem mused, eating her lower lip.\n\n'But supposin' Jo was to go off first, after the old bloke? Should I\nhave all he left?'\n\n'I think so, but I'm not sure.'\n\n'You think so? And then should I have all _hers_? If she had a\naccident, you know.'\n\n'I suppose you would. But then that's only if they didn't make wills,\nand leave it away from you.'\n\nClem started. Intent as she had been for a long time on the\npossibilities hinted at, the thought of unfavourable disposition by\nwill had never occurred to her. She shook it away.\n\n'Why should they make wills? They ain't old enough for that, neither of\nthem.'\n\n'And you might as well say they ain't old enough to be likely to take\ntheir hook, either,' suggested Bob, with a certain uneasiness in his\ntone.\n\nClem looked about her, as if her fierce eyes sought something. Her\nbrows twitched a little. She glanced at Bob, but he did not meet her\nlook. 'I don't care so much about the money,' she said, in a lower and\naltered voice. 'I'd be content with a bit of it, if only I could get\nrid of him at the same time.'\n\nBob looked gloomy.\n\n'Well, it's no use talking,' he muttered.\n\n'It's all your fault.'\n\n'How do you make that out? It was you quarrelled first.'\n\n'You're a liar!'\n\n'Oh, there's no talking to you!'\n\nHe shuffled with his feet, then rose.\n\n'Where can I see you on Wednesday morning?' asked Clem. 'I want to hear\nabout that girl.'\n\n'It can't be Wednesday morning. I tell you I shall be getting the sack\nnext thing; they've promised it. Two days last week I wasn't at the\nshop, and one day this. It can't go on.'\n\nHis companion retorted angrily, and for five minutes they stood in\nembittered colloquy. It ended in Bob's turning away and going out into\nthe street. Clem followed, and they walked westwards in silence.\nReaching City Road, and crossing to the corner where lowers St. Luke's\nHospital--grim abode of the insane, here in the midst of London's\nsqualor and uproar--they halted to take leave. The last words they\nexchanged, after making an appointment, were of brutal violence.\n\nThis was two days after Clara Hewett's arrival in London, and the same\nfog still hung about the streets, allowing little to be seen save the\nblurred glimmer of gas. Bob sauntered through it, his hands in his\npockets, observant of nothing; now and then a word escaped his lips,\ngenerally an oath. Out of Old Street he turned into Whitecross Street,\nwhence by black and all but deserted ways--Barbican and Long Lane--he\nemerged into West Smithfield. An alley in the shadow of Bartholomew's\nHospital brought him to a certain house: just as he was about to knock\nat the door it opened, and Jack Bartley appeared on the threshold. They\nexchanged a 'Hello!' of surprise, and after a whispered word or two on\nthe pavement, went in. They mounted the stairs to a bedroom which Jack\noccupied. When the door was closed:\n\n'Bill's got copped! 'whispered Bartley.\n\n'Copped? Any of it on him?'\n\n'Only the half-crown as he was pitchin', thank God! They let him go\nagain after he'd been to the station. It was a conductor, I'd never try\nthem blokes myself; they're too downy.'\n\n'Let's have a look at 'em,' said Bob, after musing. 'I thought myself\nas they wasn't quite the reg'lar.'\n\nAs he spoke he softly turned the key in the door. Jack then put his arm\nup the chimney and brought down a small tin box, soot-blackened; he\nopened it, and showed about a dozen pieces of money--in appearance\nhalf-crowns and florins. One of the commonest of offences against the\nlaw in London, this to which our young friends were not unsuccessfully\ndirecting their attention; one of the easiest to commit, moreover, for\na man with Bob's craft at his finger-ends. A mere question of a mould\nand a pewter-pot, if one be content with the simpler branches of the\nindustry. 'The snyde' or 'the queer' is the technical name by which\nsuch products are known. Distribution is, of course, the main\ndifficulty; it necessitates mutual trust between various confederates.\nBob Hewett still kept to his daily work, but gradually he was being\ndrawn into alliance with an increasing number of men who scorned the\nyoke of a recognised occupation. His face, his clothing, his speech,\nall told whither he was tending, had one but the experience necessary\nfor the noting of such points. Bob did not find his life particularly\npleasant; he was in perpetual fear; many a time he said to himself that\nhe would turn back. Impossible to do so; for a thousand reasons\nimpossible; yet he still believed that the choice lay with him.\n\nHis colloquy with Jack only lasted a few minutes, then he walked\nhomewards, crossing the Metropolitan Meat-market, going up St. John's\nLane, beneath St. John's Arch, thence to Rosoman Street and Merlin\nPlace, where at present he lived. All the way he pondered Clem's words.\nAlready their import had become familiar enough to lose that first\nterribleness. Of course he should never take up the proposal seriously;\nno, no, that was going a bit too far; but suppose Clem's husband were\nreally contriving this plot on his own account? Likely, very likely;\nbut he'd be a clever fellow if he managed such a thing in a way that\ndid not immediately subject him to suspicion. How could it be done? No\nharm in thinking over an affair of that kind when you have no intention\nof being drawn into it yourself. There was that man at Peckham who\npoisoned his sister not long ago; he was a fool to get found out in the\nway he did; he might have--\n\nThe room in which he found Pennyloaf sitting was so full of fog that\nthe lamp seemed very dim; the fire had all but died out. One of the\nchildren lay asleep; the other Pennyloaf was nursing, for it had a bad\ncough and looked much like a wax doll that has gone through a great\ndeal of ill-usage. A few more weeks and Pennyloaf would be again a\nmother; she felt very miserable as often as she thought of it, and Bob\nhad several times spoken with harsh impatience on the subject.\n\nAt present he was in no mood for conversation; to Pennyloaf's remarks\nand questions he gave not the slightest heed, but in a few minutes\ntumbled himself into bed.\n\n'Get that light put out,' he exclaimed, after lying still for a while.\n\nPennyloaf said she was uneasy about the child; its cough seemed to be\nbetter, but it moved about restlessly and showed no sign of getting to\nsleep.\n\n'Give it some of the mixture, then. Be sharp and put the light out.'\n\nPennyloaf obeyed the second injunction, and she too lay down, keeping\nthe child in her arms; of the 'mixture' she was afraid, for a few days\nsince the child of a neighbour had died in consequence of an overdose\nof this same anodyne. For a long time there was silence in the room.\nOutside, voices kept sounding with that peculiar muffled distinctness\nwhich they have on a night of dense fog, when there is little or no\nwheel-traffic to make the wonted rumbling.\n\n'Are y'asleep?' Bob asked suddenly.\n\n'No.'\n\n'There's something I wanted to tell you. You can have Jane Snowdon here\nagain, if you like.'\n\n'I can? Really?'\n\n'You may as well make use of her. That'll do; shut up and go to sleep.'\n\nIn the morning Pennyloaf was obliged to ask for money; she wished to\ntake the child to the hospital again, and as the weather was very bad\nshe would have to pay an omnibus fare. Bob growled at the demand, as\nwas nowadays his custom. Since he had found a way of keeping his own\npocket tolerably well supplied from time to time, he was becoming so\npenurious at home that Pennyloaf had to beg for what she needed copper\nby copper. Excepting breakfast, he seldom took a meal with her. The\neasy good-nature which in the beginning made him an indulgent husband\nhad turned in other directions since his marriage was grown a weariness\nto him. He did not, in truth, spend much upon himself, but in his\nleisure time was always surrounded by companions whom he had a pleasure\nin treating with the generosity of the public-house. A word of flattery\nwas always sure of payment if Bob had a coin in his pocket. Ever hungry\nfor admiration, for prominence, he found new opportunities of\ngratifying his taste now that he had a resource when his wages ran out.\nSo far from becoming freer-handed again with his wife and children, he\ngrudged every coin that he was obliged to expend on them. Pennyloaf's\nsubmissiveness encouraged him in this habit; where other wives would\nhave 'made a row,' she yielded at once to his grumbling and made shift\nwith the paltriest allowance. You should have seen the kind of diet on\nwhich she habitually lived. Like all the women of her class, utterly\nignorant and helpless in the matter of preparing food, she abandoned\nthe attempt to cook anything, and expended her few pence daily on\nwhatever happened to tempt her in a shop, when meal-time came round. In\nthe present state of her health she often suffered from a morbid\nappetite and fed on things of incredible unwholesomeness. Thus, there\nwas a kind of cake exposed in a window in Rosoman Street, two layers of\npastry with half an inch of something like very coarse mincemeat\nbetween; it cost a halfpenny a square, and not seldom she ate four, or\neven six, of these squares, as heavy as lead, making this her dinner. A\ncookshop within her range exhibited at midday great dough-puddings,\nkept hot by jets of steam that came up through the zinc on which they\nlay; this food was cheap and satisfying, and Pennyloaf often regaled\nboth herself and the children on thick slabs of it. Pease-pudding also\nattracted her; she fetched it from the pork-butcher's in a little\nbasin, which enabled her to bring away at the same time a spoonful or\ntwo of gravy from the joints of which she was not rich enough to\npurchase a cut. Her drink was tea; she had the pot on the table all\nday, and kept adding hot water. Treacle she purchased now and then, but\nonly as a treat when her dinner had cost even less than usual; she did\nnot venture to buy more than a couple of ounces at a time, knowing by\nexperience that she could not resist this form of temptation, and must\neat and eat till all was finished.\n\nBob flung sixpence on the table. He was ashamed of himself--you will\nnot understand him if you fail to recognise that--but the shame only\nserved to make him fret under his bondage. Was he going to be tied to\nPennyloaf all his life, with a family constantly increasing?\nPractically he had already made a resolve to be free before very long;\nthe way was not quite clear to him as yet. But he went to work still\nbrooding over Clem's words of the night before.\n\nPennyloaf let the fire go out, locked the elder child into the room for\nsafety against accidents, and set forth for the hospital. It rained\nheavily, and the wind rendered her umbrella useless. She had to stand\nfor a long time at a street-corner before the omnibus came; the water\nsoaked into her leaky shoes, but that didn't matter; it was the child\non whose account she was anxious. Having reached her destination, she\nsat for a long time waiting her turn among the numerous out-patients.\nJust as the opportunity for passing into the doctor's room arrived, a\nmovement in the bundle she held made her look closely at the child's\nface; at that instant it had ceased to live.\n\nThe medical man behaved kindly to her, but she gave way to no outburst\nof grief; with tearless eyes she stared at the unmoving body in a sort\nof astonishment. The questions addressed to her she could not answer\nwith any intelligence; several times she asked stupidly, 'Is she really\ndead?' There was nothing to wonder at, however; the doctor glanced at\nthe paper on which he had written prescriptions twice or thrice during\nthe past few weeks, and found the event natural enough. . . .\n\nTowards the close of the afternoon Pennyloaf was in Hanover Street. She\nwished to see Jane Snowdon, but had a fear of going up to the door and\nknocking. Jane might not be at home, and, if she were, Pennyloaf did\nnot know in what words to explain her coming and say what had happened.\nShe was in a dazed, heavy, tongue-tied state; indeed she did not\nclearly remember how she had come thus far, or what she had done since\nleaving the hospital at midday. However, her steps drew nearer to the\nhouse, and at last she had raised the knocker--just raised it and let\nit fall.\n\nMrs. Byass opened; she did not know Pennyloaf by sight. The latter\ntried to say something, but only stammered a meaningless sound;\nthereupon Bessie concluded she was a beggar, and with a shake of the\nhead shut the door upon her.\n\nPennyloaf turned away in confusion and dull misery. She walked to the\nend of the street and stood there. On leaving home she had forgotten\nher umbrella, and now it was raining heavily again. Of a sudden her\nneed became powerful enough to overcome all obstacles; she knew that\nshe _must_ see Jane Snowdon, that she could not go home till she had\ndone so. Jane was the only friend she had; the only creature who would\nspeak the kind of words to her for which she longed.\n\nAgain the knocker fell, and again Mrs. Byass appeared.\n\n'What do you want? I've got nothing for you,' she cried impatiently.\n\n'I want to see Miss Snowdon, please, mum--Miss Snowdon, please--'\n\n'Miss Snowdon? Then why didn't you say so? Step inside.'\n\nA few moments and Jane came running downstairs.\n\n'Pennyloaf!'\n\nAh! that was the voice that did good. How it comforted and blessed,\nafter the hospital, and the miserable room in which the dead child was\nleft lying, and the rainy street!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nON A BARREN SHORE\n\nAbout this time Mr. Scawthorne received one morning a letter which,\nthough not unexpected, caused him some annoyance, and even anxiety. It\nwas signed 'C. V.,' and made brief request for an interview on the\nevening of the next day at Waterloo Station.\n\nThe room in which our friend sat at breakfast was of such very modest\nappearance that it seemed to argue but poor remuneration for the\nservices rendered by him in the office of Messrs. Percival & Peel. It\nwas a parlour on the second floor of a lodging-house in Chelsea;\nScawthorne's graceful person and professional bearing were out of place\namid the trivial appointments. He lived here for the simple reason that\nin order to enjoy a few of the luxuries of civilisation he had to spend\nas little as possible on bare necessaries. His habits away from home\nwere those of a man to whom a few pounds are no serious consideration;\nhis pleasant dinner at the restaurant, his occasional stall at a\ntheatre, his easy acquaintance with easy livers of various kinds, had\nbecome indispensable to him, and as a matter of course his expenditure\nincreased although his income kept at the same figure. That figure was\nnot contemptible, regard had to the path by which he had come thus far;\nMr. Percival esteemed his abilities highly, and behaved to him with\ngenerosity. Ten years ago Scawthorne would have lost his senses with\njoy at the prospect of such a salary; to-day he found it miserably\ninsufficient to the demands he made upon life. Paltry debts harassed\nhim; inabilities fretted his temperament and his pride; it irked him to\nhave no better abode than this musty corner to which he could never\ninvite an acquaintance. And then, notwithstanding his mental\nendowments, his keen social sense, his native tact, in all London not\none refined home was open to him, not one domestic circle of educated\npeople could he approach and find a welcome.\n\nScawthorne was passing out of the stage when a man seeks only the\ngratification of his propensities; he began to focus his outlook upon\nthe world, and to feel the significance of maturity. The double\nexistence he was compelled to lead--that of a laborious and\nclear-brained man of business in office hours, that of a hungry rascal\nin the time which was his own--not only impressed him with a sense of\ndanger, but made him profoundly dissatisfied with the unreality of what\nhe called his enjoyments. What, he asked himself, had condemned him to\nthis kind of career? Simply the weight under which he started, his poor\norigin, his miserable youth. However carefully regulated his private\nlife had been, his position to-day could not have been other than it\nwas; no degree of purity would have opened to him the door of a\ncivilised house. Suppose he had wished to marry; where, pray, was he to\nfind his wife? A barmaid? Why, yes, other men of his standing wedded\nbarmaids and girls from the houses of business, and so on; but they had\nneither his tastes nor his brains. Never had it been his lot to\nexchange a word with an educated woman--save in the office on rare\noccasions. There is such a thing as self-martyrdom in the cause of\npersonal integrity; another man might have said to himself, 'Providence\nforbids me the gratification of my higher instincts, and I must be\ncontent to live a life of barrenness, that I may at least be above\nreproach.' True, but Scawthorne happened not to be so made. He was of\nthe rebels of the earth. Formerly he revolted because he could not\nindulge his senses to their full; at present his ideal was changed, and\nthe past burdened him.\n\nYesterday he had had an interview with old Mr. Percival which, for the\nfirst time in his life, opened to him a prospect of the only kind of\nadvancement conformable with his higher needs. The firm of Percival &\nPeel was, in truth, Percival & Son, Mr. Peel having been dead for many\nyears; and the son in question lacked a good deal of being the capable\nlawyer whose exertions could supplement the failing energy of the\nsenior partner. Mr. Percival having pondered the matter for some time,\nnow proposed that Scawthorne should qualify himself for admission as a\nsolicitor (the circumstances required his being under articles for\nthree years only), and then, if everything were still favourable,\naccept a junior partnership in the firm. Such an offer was a testimony\nof the high regard in which Scawthorne was held by his employer; it\nstirred him with hope he had never dared to entertain since his eyes\nwere opened to the realities of the world, and in a single day did more\nfor the ripening of his prudence than years would have effected had his\nposition remained unaltered. Scawthorne realised more distinctly what a\nhazardous game he had been playing.\n\nAnd here was this brief note, signed 'C. V.' An ugly affair to look\nback upon, all that connected itself with those initials. The worst of\nit was, that it could not be regarded as done with. Had he anything to\nfear from 'C. V.' directly? The meeting must decide that. He felt now\nwhat a fortunate thing it was that his elaborate plot to put an end to\nthe engagement between Kirkwood and Jane Snowdon had been accidentally\nfrustrated--a plot which _might_ have availed himself nothing, even had\nit succeeded. But was he, in his abandonment of rascality in general,\nto think no more of the fortune which had so long kept his imagination\nuneasy? Had he not, rather, a vastly better chance of getting some of\nthat money into his own pocket? It really seemed as if Kirkwood--though\nhe might be only artful--had relinquished his claim on the girl, at all\nevents for the present; possibly he was an honest man, which would\nexplain his behaviour. Michael Snowdon could not live much longer; Jane\nwould be the ward of the Percivals, and certainly would be aided to a\nposition more correspondent with her wealth. Why should it then be\nimpossible for _him_ to become Jane's husband? Joseph, beyond a doubt,\ncould be brought to favour that arrangement, by means of a private\nunderstanding more advantageous to him than anything he could\nreasonably hope from the girl's merely remaining unmarried. This change\nin his relations to the Percivals would so far improve his social\nclaims that many of the difficulties hitherto besieging such a scheme\nas this might easily be set aside. Come, come; the atmosphere was\nclearing. Joseph himself, now established in a decent business, would\nbecome less a fellow-intriguer than an ordinary friend bound to him, in\nthe way of the world, by mutual interests. Things must be put in order;\nby some device the need of secrecy in his intercourse with Joseph must\ncome to an end. In fact, there remained but two hazardous points. Could\nthe connection between Jane and Kirkwood be brought definitely to an\nend. And was anything to be feared from poor 'C. V.'?\n\nWaterloo Station is a convenient rendezvous; its irregular form\nprovides many corners of retirement, out-of-the-way recesses where talk\ncan be carried on in something like privacy. To one of these secluded\nspots Scawthorne drew aside with the veiled woman who met him at the\nentrance from Waterloo Road. So closely was her face shrouded, that he\nhad at first a difficulty in catching the words she addressed to him.\nThe noise of an engine getting up steam, the rattle of cabs and\nporters' barrows, the tread and voices of a multitude of people made\nfitting accompaniment to a dialogue which in every word presupposed the\ncorruptions and miseries of a centre of modern life.\n\n'Why did you send that letter to my father?' was Clara's first question.\n\n'Letter? What letter?'\n\n'Wasn't it you who let him know about me?'\n\n'Certainly not, How should I have known his address? When I saw the\nnewspapers, I went down to Bolton and made inquiries. When I heard your\nfather had been, I concluded you had yourself sent for him. Otherwise,\nI should, of course, have tried to be useful to you in some way. As it\nwas, I supposed you would scarcely thank me for coming forward.'\n\nIt might or might not be the truth, as far as Clara was able to decide.\nPossibly the information had come from some one else. She knew him well\nenough to be assured by his tone that nothing more could be elicited\nfrom him on that point.\n\n'You are quite recovered, I hope?' Scawthorne added, surveying her as\nshe stood in the obscurity. 'In your general health?'\n\nHe was courteous, somewhat distant.\n\n'I suppose I'm as well as I shall ever be,' she answered coldly. 'I\nasked you to meet me because I wanted to know what it was you spoke of\nin your last letters. You got my answer, I suppose.'\n\n'Yes, I received your answer. But--in fact, it's too late. The time has\ngone by; and perhaps I was a little hasty in the hopes I held out. I\nhad partly deceived myself.'\n\n'Never mind. I wish to know what it was,' she said im-patiently.\n\n'It can't matter now. Well, there's no harm in mentioning it. Naturally\nyou went out of your way to suppose it was something dishonourable.\nNothing of the kind; I had an idea that you might come to terms with an\nAustralian who was looking out for actresses for a theatre in\nMelbourne--that was all. But he wasn't quite the man I took him for. I\ndoubt whether it could have been made as profitable as I thought at\nfirst.'\n\n'You expect me to believe that story?'\n\n'Not unless you like. It's some time since you put any faith in my\ngoodwill. The only reason I didn't speak plainly was because I felt\nsure that the mention of a foreign country would excite your\nsuspicions. You have always attributed evil motives to me rather than\ngood. However, this is not the time to speak of such things. I\nsympathise with you--deeply. Will you tell me if I can--can help you at\nall?'\n\n'No, you can't. I wanted to make quite sure that you were what I\nthought you, that's all.'\n\n'I don't think, on the whole, you have any reason to complain of\nill-faith on my part. I secured you the opportunities that are so hard\nto find.'\n\n'Yes, you did. We don't owe each other anything--that's one comfort.\nI'll just say that you needn't have any fear I shall trouble you in\nfuture; I know that's what you're chiefly thinking about.'\n\n'You misjudge me; but that can't be helped. I wish very much it were in\nmy power to be of use to you.'\n\n'Thank you.'\n\nOn that last note of irony they parted. True enough, in one sense, that\nthere remained debt on neither side. But Clara, for all the fierce\nambition which had brought her life to this point, could not divest\nherself of a woman's instincts. That simple fact explained various\ninconsistencies in her behaviour to Scawthorne since she had made\nherself independent of him; it explained also why this final interview\nbecame the bitterest charge her memory preserved against him.\n\nHer existence for some three weeks kept so gloomy a monotony that it\nwas impossible she should endure it much longer. The little room which\nshe shared at night with Annie and Amy was her cell throughout the day.\nOf necessity she had made the acquaintance of Mrs. Eagles, but they\nscarcely saw more of each other than if they had lived in different\ntenements on the same staircase; she had offered to undertake a share\nof the housework, but her father knew that everything of the kind was\ndistasteful to her, and Mrs. Eagles continued to assist Amy as\nhitherto. To save trouble, she came into the middle room for her meals,\nat these times always keeping as much of her face as possible hidden.\nThe children could not overcome a repulsion, a fear, excited by her\nveil and the muteness she preserved in their presence; several nights\npassed before little Annie got to sleep with any comfort. Only with her\nfather did Clara hold converse; in the evening he always sat alone with\nher for an hour. She went out perhaps every third day, after dark,\nstealing silently down the long staircase, and walking rapidly until\nshe had escaped the neighbourhood--like John Hewett when formerly he\nwandered forth in search of her. Her strength was slight; after\nhalf-an-hour's absence she came back so wearied that the ascent of\nstairs cost her much suffering.\n\nThe economy prevailing in to-day's architecture takes good care that no\ndepressing circumstance shall be absent from the dwellings in which the\npoor find shelter. What terrible barracks, those Farringdon Road\nBuildings! Vast, sheer walls, unbroken by even an attempt at ornament;\nrow above row of windows in the mud-coloured surface, upwards, upwards,\nlifeless eyes, murky openings that tell of bareness, disorder,\ncomfortlessness within. One is tempted to say that Shooter's Gardens\nare a preferable abode. An inner courtyard, asphalted, swept\nclean--looking up to the sky as from a prison. Acres of these edifices,\nthe tinge of grime declaring the relative dates of their erection;\nmillions of tons of brute brick and mortar, crushing the spirit as you\ngaze. Barracks, in truth; housing for the army of industrialism, an\narmy fighting with itself, rank against rank, man against man, that the\nsurvivors may have whereon to feed. Pass by in the night, and strain\nimagination to picture the weltering mass of human weariness, of\nbestiality, of unmerited dolour, of hopeless hope, of crushed\nsurrender, tumbled together within those forbidding walls.\n\nClara hated the place from her first hour in it. It seemed to her that\nthe air was poisoned with the odour of an unclean crowd. The yells of\nchildren at play in the courtyard tortured her nerves; the regular\nsounds on the staircase, day after day repeated at the same hours,\nincidents of the life of poverty, irritated her sick brain and filled\nher with despair to think that as long as she lived she could never\nhope to rise again above this world to which she was born. Gone for\never, for ever, the promise that always gleamed before her whilst she\nhad youth and beauty and talent. With the one, she felt as though she\nhad been robbed of all three blessings; her twenty years were now a\nmeaningless figure; the energies of her mind could avail no more than\nan idiot's mummery. For the author of her calamity she nourished no\nmemory of hatred; her resentment was against the fate which had cursed\nher existence from its beginning.\n\nFor this she had dared everything, had made the supreme sacrifice.\nConscience had nothing to say to her, but she felt herself an outcast\neven among these wretched toilers whose swarming aroused her disgust.\nGiven the success which had been all but in her grasp, and triumphant\npride would have scored out every misgiving as to the cost at which the\nvictory had been won. Her pride was unbroken; under the stress of\nanguish it became a scorn for goodness and humility; but in the\ndesolation of her future she read a punishment equal to the daring\nwherewith she had aspired. Excepting her poor old father, not a living\nsoul that held account of her. She might live for years and years. Her\nfather would die, and then no smallest tribute of love or admiration\nwould be hers for ever. More than that; perforce she must gain her own\nliving, and in doing so she must expose herself to all manner of\ninsulting wonder and pity. Was it a life that could be lived?\n\nHour after hour she sat with her face buried in her hands. She did not\nweep; tears were trivial before a destiny such as this. But groans and\nsmothered cries often broke the silence of her solitude--cries of\nfrenzied revolt, wordless curses. Once she rose up suddenly, passed\nthrough the middle room, and out on to the staircase; there a gap in\nthe wall, guarded by iron railings breast-high, looked down upon the\ncourtyard. She leaned forward over the bar and measured the distance\nthat separated her from the ground; a ghastly height! Surely one would\nnot feel much after such a fall? In any case, the crashing agony of but\nan instant. Had not this place tempted other people before now?\n\nSome one coming upstairs made her shrink back into her room, She had\nfelt the horrible fascination of that sheer depth, and thought of it\nfor days, thought of it until she dreaded to quit the tenement, lest a\npower distinct from will should seize and hurl her to destruction. She\nknew that that must not happen here; for all her self-absorption, she\ncould not visit with such cruelty the one heart that loved her. And\nthinking of him, she understood that her father's tenderness was not\nwholly the idle thing that it had been to her at first; her love could\nnever equal his, had never done so in her childhood, but she grew\nconscious of a soothing power in the gentle and timid devotion with\nwhich he tended her. His appearance of an evening was something more\nthan a relief after the waste of hours which made her day. The rough,\npassionate man made himself as quiet and sympathetic as a girl when he\ntook his place by her. Compared with her, his other children were as\nnothing to him. Impossible that Clara should not be touched by the\nsense that he who had everything to forgive, whom she had despised and\nabandoned, behaved now as one whose part it is to beseech forgiveness.\nShe became less impatient when he tried to draw her into conversation;\nwhen he held her thin soft hand in those rude ones of his, she knew a\nsolace in which there was something of gratitude.\n\nYet it was John who revived her misery in its worst form. Pitying her\nunoccupied loneliness, he brought home one day a book that he had\npurchased from a stall in Farringdon Street; it was a novel (with a\npicture on the cover which seemed designed to repel any person not\nwholly without taste), and might perhaps serve the end of averting her\nthoughts from their one subject. Clara viewed it contemptuously, but\nmade a show of being thankful, and on the next day she did glance at\nits pages. The story was better than its illustration; it took a hold\nupon her; she read all day long. But when she returned to herself, it\nwas to find that she had been exasperating her heart's malady. The book\ndealt with people of wealth and refinement, with the world to which she\nhad all her life been aspiring, and to which she might have attained.\nThe meanness of her surroundings became in comparison more mean, the\nbitterness of her fate more bitter. You must not lose sight of the fact\nthat since abandoning her work-girl existence Clara had been constantly\neducating herself, not only by direct study of books, but through her\nassociation with people, her growth in experience. Where in the old\ndays of rebellion she had only an instinct, a divination to guide her,\nthere was now just enough of knowledge to give occupation to her\ndeveloped intellect and taste. Far keener was her sense of the loss she\nhad suffered than her former longing for what she knew only in dream.\nThe activity of her mind received a new impulse when she broke free\nfrom Scawthorne and began her upward struggle in independence. Whatever\nbooks were obtainable she read greedily; she purchased numbers of plays\nin the acting-editions, and studied with the utmost earnestness such\nparts as she knew by repute; no actress entertained a more superb\nambition, none was more vividly conscious of power. But it was not only\nat stage-triumph that Clara aimed; glorious in itself, this was also to\nserve her as a means of becoming nationalised among that race of beings\nwhom birth and breeding exalt above the multitude. A notable illusion;\npathetic to dwell upon. As a work-girl, she nourished envious hatred of\nthose the world taught her to call superiors; they were then as remote\nand unknown to her as gods on Olympus. From her place behind the\nfootlights she surveyed the occupants of boxes and stalls in a changed\nspirit; the distance was no longer insuperable; she heard of fortunate\nplayers who mingled on equal terms with men and women of refinement.\nThere, she imagined, was her ultimate goal. 'It is to _them_ that I\nbelong! Be my origin what it may, I have the intelligence and the\ndesires of one born to freedom. Nothing in me, nothing, is akin to that\ngross world from which I have escaped!' So she thought--with every drop\nof her heart's blood crying its source from that red fountain of revolt\nwhereon never yet did the upper daylight gleam! Brain and pulses such\nas hers belong not to the mild breed of mortals fostered in sunshine.\nBut for the stroke of fate, she might have won that reception which was\nin her dream, and with what self-mockery when experience had matured\nitself! Never yet did true rebel, who has burst the barriers of social\nlimitation, find aught but _ennui_ in the trim gardens beyond.\n\nWhen John asked if the book had given her amusement, she said that\nreading made her eyes ache. He noticed that her hand felt feverish, and\nthat the dark mood had fallen upon her as badly as ever to-night.\n\n'It's just what I said,' she exclaimed with abruptness, after long\nrefusal to speak. 'I knew your friend would never come as long as I was\nhere.'\n\nJohn regarded her anxiously. The phrase 'your friend' had a peculiar\nsound that disturbed him. It made him aware that she had been thinking\noften of Sidney Kirkwood since his name had been dismissed from their\nconversation. He, too, had often turned his mind uneasily in the same\ndirection, wondering whether he ought to have spoken of Sidney so\nfreely. At the time it seemed best, indeed almost inevitable; but habit\nand the force of affection were changing his view of Clara in several\nrespects. He recognised the impossibility of her continuing to live as\nnow, yet it was as difficult as ever to conceive a means of aiding her.\nUnavoidably he kept glancing towards Kirkwood. He knew that Sidney was\nno longer a free man; he knew that, even had it been otherwise, Clara\ncould be nothing to him. In spite of facts, the father kept brooding on\nwhat might have been. His own love was perdurable; how could it other\nthan intensify when its object was so unhappy? His hot, illogical mood\nall but brought about a revival of the old resentment against Sidney.\n\n'I haven't seen him for a week or two,' he replied, in an embarrassed\nway.\n\n'Did he tell you he shouldn't come?'\n\n'No. After we'd talked about it, you know--when you told me you didn't\nmind--I just said a word or two; and he nodded, that was all.'\n\nShe became silent. John, racked by doubts as to whether he should say\nmore of Sidney or still hold his peace, sat rubbing the back of one\nhand with the other and looking about the room.\n\n'Father,' Clara resumed presently, 'what became of that child at Mrs.\nPeckover's, that her grandfather came and took away? Snowdon; yes, that\nwas her name; Jane Snowdon.'\n\n'You remember they went to live with somebody you used to know,' John\nreplied, with hesitation. 'They're still in the same house.'\n\n'So she's grown up. Did you ever hear about that old man having a lot\nof money?'\n\n'Why, my dear, I never heard nothing but what them Peckovers talked at\nthe time. But there was a son of his turned up as seemed to have some\nmoney. He married Mrs. Peckover's daughter.'\n\nClara expressed surprise.\n\n'A son of his? Not the girl's father?\n\n'Yes; her father. I don't know nothing about his history. It's for him,\nor partly for him, as I'm workin' now, Clara. The firm's Lake, Snowdon\n& Co.'\n\n'Why didn't you mention it before?'\n\n'I don't hardly know, my dear.'\n\nShe looked at him, aware that something was being kept back.\n\n'Tell me about the girl. What does she do?'\n\n'She goes to work, I believe; but I haven't heard much about her since\na good time. Sidney Kirkwood's a friend of her grandfather. He often\ngoes there, I believe.'\n\n'What is she like?' Clara asked, after a pause. 'She used to be such a\nweak, ailing thing, I never thought she'd grow up. What's she like to\nlook at?'\n\n'I can't tell you, my dear. I don't know as ever I see her since those\ntimes.'\n\nAgain a silence.\n\n'Then it's Mr. Kirkwood that has told you what you know of her?'\n\n'Why, no. It was chiefly Mrs. Peckover told me. She did say, Clara--but\nthen I can't tell whether it's true or not--she did say something about\nSidney and her.'\n\nHe spoke with difficulty, feeling constrained to make the disclosure,\nbut anxious as to its result. Clara made no movement, seemed to have\nheard with indifference.\n\n'It's maybe partly 'cause of that,' added John, in a low voice, 'that\nhe doesn't like to come here.'\n\n'Yes; I understand.'\n\nThey spoke no more on the subject.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nWOMAN AND ACTRESS\n\nIn a tenement on the same staircase, two floors below, lived a family\nwith whom John Hewett was on friendly terms. Necessity calling these\npeople out of London for a few days, they had left with John the key of\ntheir front door; a letter of some moment might arrive in their\nabsence, and John undertook to re-post it to them. The key was hung on\na nail in Clara's room.\n\n'I'll just go down and see if the postman's left anything at Holland's\nthis morning,' said Amy Hewett, coming in between breakfast and the\ntime of starting for school.\n\nShe reached up to the key, but Clara, who sat by the fire with a cup of\ntea on her lap, the only breakfast she ever took, surprised her by\nsaying, 'You needn't trouble, Amy. I shall be going out soon, and I'll\nlook in as I pass.'\n\nThe girl was disappointed, for she liked this private incursion into\nthe abode of other people, but the expression of a purpose by her\nsister was so unusual that, after a moment's hesitating, she said,\n'Very well,' and left the room again.\n\nWhen silence informed Clara that the children were gone, Mrs. Eagles\nbeing the only person besides herself who remained in the tenement, she\nput on her hat, drew down the veil which was always attached to it, and\nwith the key in her hand descended to the Hollands' rooms. Had a letter\nbeen delivered that morning, it would have been--in default of\nbox--just inside the door; there was none, but Clara seemed to have\nanother purpose in view. She closed the door and walked forward into\nthe nearest room; the blind was down, but the dusk thus produced was\nfamiliar to her in consequence of her own habit, and, her veil thrown\nback, she examined the chamber thoughtfully. It was a sitting-room,\nugly, orderly; the air felt damp, and even in semi-darkness she was\nconscious of the layers of London dust which had softly deposited\nthemselves since the family went away forty-eight hours ago. A fire was\nlaid ready for lighting, and the smell of moist soot spread from the\ngrate. Having stood on one spot for nearly ten minutes, Clara made a\nquick movement and withdrew; she latched the front door with as little\nnoise as possible, ran upstairs and shut herself again in her own room.\n\nPresently she was standing at her window, the blind partly raised. On a\nclear day the view from this room was of wide extent, embracing a great\npart of the City; seen under a low, blurred, dripping sky, through the\nragged patches of smoke from chimneys innumerable, it had a gloomy\nimpressiveness well in keeping with the mind of her who brooded over\nit. Directly in front, rising mist-detached from the lower masses of\nbuilding, stood in black majesty the dome of St. Paul's; its vastness\nsuffered no diminution from this high outlook, rather was exaggerated\nby the flying scraps of mirky vapour which softened its outline and at\ntimes gave it the appearance of floating on a vague troubled sea.\nSomewhat nearer, amid many spires and steeples, lay the surly bulk of\nNewgate, the lines of its construction shown plan-wise; its little\nwindows multiplied for points of torment to the vision. Nearer again,\nthe markets of Smithfield, Bartholomew's Hospital, the tract of modern\ndeformity, cleft by a gulf of railway, which spreads between\nClerkenwell Road and Charterhouse Street. Down in Farringdon Street the\ncarts, waggons, vans, cabs, omnibuses, crossed and intermingled in a\nsteaming splash-bath of mud; human beings, reduced to their due\npaltriness, seemed to toil in exasperation along the strips of\npavement, bound on errands, which were a mockery, driven automaton-like\nby forces they neither understood nor could resist.\n\n'Can I go out into a world like that--alone?' was the thought which\nmade Clara's spirit fail as she stood gazing. 'Can I face life as it is\nfor women who grow old in earning bare daily bread among those terrible\nstreets? Year after year to go in and out from some wretched garret\nthat I call home, with my face hidden, my heart stabbed with misery\ntill it is cold and bloodless!\n\nThen her eye fell upon the spire of St. James's Church, on Clerkenwell\nGreen, whose bells used to be so familiar to her. The memory was only\nof discontent and futile aspiration, but--Oh, if it were possible to be\nagain as she was then, and yet keep the experience with which life had\nsince endowed her! With no moral condemnation did she view the records\nof her rebellion; but how easy to see now that ignorance had been one\nof the worst obstacles in her path, and that, like all unadvised\npurchasers, she had paid a price that might well have been spared. A\nlittle more craft, a little more patience--it is with these that the\nworld is conquered. The world was her enemy, and had proved too strong;\nwoman though she was--only a girl striving to attain the place for\nwhich birth adapted her--pursuing only her irrepressible\ninstincts--fate flung her to the ground pitilessly, and bade her live\nout the rest of her time in wretchedness.\n\nNo! There remained one more endeavour that was possible to her, one\nbare hope of saving herself from the extremity which only now she\nestimated at its full horror. If that failed, why, then, there was a\nway to cure all ills.\n\nFrom her box, that in which were hidden away many heart-breaking\nmementoes of her life as an actress, she took out a sheet of notepaper\nand an envelope. Without much thought, she wrote nearly three pages,\nfolded the letter, addressed it with a name only 'Mr. Kirkwood.'\nSidney's address she did not know; her father had mentioned Red Lion\nStreet, that was all. She did not even know whether he still worked at\nthe old place, but in that way she must try to find him. She cloaked\nherself, took her umbrella, and went out.\n\nAt a corner of St. John's Square she soon found an urchin who would run\nan errand for her. He was to take this note to a house that she\nindicated, and to ask if Mr. Kirkwood was working there. She scarcely\ndurst hope to see the messenger returning with empty hands, but he did\nso. A terrible throbbing at her heart, she went home again.\n\nIn the evening, when her father returned, she surprised him by saying\nthat she expected a visitor.\n\n'Do you want me to go out of the way?' he asked, eager to submit to her\nin everything.\n\n'No. I've asked my friend to come to Mrs. Holland's. I thought there\nwould be no great harm. I shall go down just before nine o'clock.'\n\n'Oh no, there's no harm,' conceded her father. 'It's only if the\nneighbours opposite got talkin' to them when they come back.'\n\n'I can't help it. They won't mind. I can't help it.'\n\nJohn noticed her agitated repetition, the impatience with which she\nflung aside difficulties.\n\n'Clara--it ain't anything about work, my dear?'\n\n'No, father. I wouldn't do anything without telling you; I've promised.'\n\n'Then I don't care; it's all right.'\n\nShe had begun to speak immediately on his entering the room, and so it\nhappened that he had not kissed her as he always did at home-coming.\nWhen she had sat down, he came with awkwardness and timidity and bent\nhis face to hers.\n\n'What a hot cheek it is to-night, my little girl!' he murmured. 'I\ndon't like it; you've got a bit of fever hangin' about you.'\n\nShe wished to be alone; the children must not come into the room until\nshe had gone downstairs. When her father had left her, she seated\nherself before the looking-glass, abhorrent as it was to her to look\nthus in her own face, and began dressing her hair with quite unusual\nattention. This beauty at least remained to her; arranged as she had\nlearned to do it for the stage, the dark abundance of her tresses\ncrowned nobly the head which once held itself with such defiant grace.\nShe did not change her dress, which, though it had suffered from wear,\nwas well-fitting and of better material than Farringdon Road Buildings\nwere wont to see; a sober draping which became her tall elegance as she\nmoved. At a quarter to nine she arranged the veil upon her head so that\nshe could throw her hat aside without disturbing it; then, taking the\nlamp in her hand, and the key of the Hollands' door, she went forth.\n\nNo one met her on the stairs. She was safe in the cold deserted parlour\nwhere she had stood this morning. Cold, doubtless, but she could not be\nconscious of it; in her veins there seemed rather to be fire than\nblood. Her brain was clear, but in an unnatural way; the throbbing at\nher temples ought to have been painful, but only excited her with a\nstrange intensity of thought. And she felt, amid it all, a dread of\nwhat was before her; only the fever, to which she abandoned herself\nwith a sort of reckless confidence, a faith that it would continue till\nthis interview was over, overcame an impulse to rush back into her\nhiding-place, to bury herself in shame, or desperately whelm her\nwretchedness in the final oblivion. . . .\n\nHe was very punctual. The heavy bell of St. Paul's had not reached its\nninth stroke when she heard his knock at the door.\n\nHe came in without speaking, and stood as if afraid to look at her. The\nlamp, placed on a side-table, barely disclosed all the objects within\nthe four walls; it illumined Sidney's face, but Clara moved so that she\nwas in shadow. She began to speak.\n\n'You understood my note? The people who live here are away, and I have\nventured to borrow their room. They are friends of my father's.'\n\nAt the first word, he was surprised by the change in her voice and\naccentuation. Her speech was that of an educated woman; the melody\nwhich always had such a charm for him had gained wonderfully in\nrichness. Yet it was with difficulty that she commanded utterance, and\nher agitation touched him in a way quite other than he was prepared\nfor. In truth, he knew not what experience he had anticipated, but the\nreality, now that it came, this unimaginable blending of memory with\nthe unfamiliar, this refinement of something that he had loved, this\nnote of pity struck within him by such subtle means, affected his\ninmost self. Immediately he laid stern control upon his feelings, but\nall the words which he had designed to speak were driven from memory.\nHe could say nothing, could only glance at her veiled face and await\nwhat she had to ask of him.\n\n'Will you sit down? I shall feel grateful if you can spare me a few\nminutes. I have asked you to see me because--indeed, because I am sadly\nin want of the kind of help a friend might give me. I don't venture to\ncall you that, but I thought of you; I hoped you wouldn't refuse to let\nme speak to you. I am in such difficulties--such a hard position--'\n\n'You may be very sure I will do anything I can to be of use to you,'\nSidney replied, his thick voice contrasting so strongly with that which\nhad just failed into silence that he coughed and lowered his tone after\nthe first few syllables. He meant to express himself without a hint of\nemotion, but it was beyond his power. The words in which she spoke of\nher calamity seemed so pathetically simple that they went to his heart.\nClara had recovered all her faculties. The fever and the anguish and\nthe dread were no whit diminished, but they helped instead of checking\nher. An actress improvising her part, she regulated every tone with\nperfect skill, with inspiration; the very attitude in which she seated\nherself was a triumph of the artist's felicity.\n\n'I just said a word or two in my note,' she resumed, 'that you might\nhave replied if you thought nothing could be gained by my speaking to\nyou. I couldn't explain fully what I had in mind. I don't know that\nI've anything very clear to say even now, but--you know what has\nhappened to me; you know that I have nothing to look forward to, that I\ncan only hope to keep from being a burden to my father. I am getting\nstronger; it's time I tried to find something to do. But I--'\n\nHer voice failed again. Sidney gazed at her, and saw the dull lamplight\njust glisten on her hair. She was bending forward a little, her hands\njoined and resting on her knee.\n\n'Have you thought what kind of--of work would be best for you?' Sidney\nasked. The 'work' stuck in his throat, and he seemed to himself brutal\nin his way of uttering it. But he was glad when he had put the question\nthus directly; one at least of his resolves was carried out.\n\n'I know I've no right to choose, when there's necessity,' she answered,\nin a very low tone. 'Most women would naturally think of needlework;\nbut I know so little of it; I scarcely ever did any. If I could--I\nmight perhaps do that at home, and I feel--if I could only avoid--if I\ncould only be spared going among strangers--'\n\nHer faltering voice sank lower and lower; she seemed as if she would\nhave hidden her face even under its veil.\n\n'I feel sure you will have no difficulty,' Sidney hastened to reply,\nhis own voice unsteady. 'Certainly you can get work at home. Why do you\ntrouble yourself with the thought of going among strangers? There'll\nnever be the least need for that; I'm sure there won't. Haven't you\nspoken about it to your father?'\n\n'Yes. But he is so kind to me that he won't hear of work at all. It was\npartly on that account that I took the step of appealing to you. He\ndoesn't know who I am meeting here to-night. Would you--I don't know\nwhether I ought to ask--but perhaps if you spoke to him in a day or\ntwo, and made him understand how strong my wish is. He dreads lest we\nshould be parted, but I hope I shall never have to leave him. And then,\nof course, father is not very well able to advise me--about work, I\nmean. You have more experience. I am so helpless. Oh, if you knew how\nhelpless I feel!'\n\n'If you really wish it, I will talk with your father--'\n\n'Indeed, I do wish it. My coming to live here has made everything so\nuncomfortable for him and the children. Even his friends can't visit\nhim as they would; I feel that, though he won't admit that it's made\nany difference.'\n\nSidney looked to the ground. He heard her voice falter as it continued.\n\n'If I'm to live here still, it mustn't be at the cost of all his\ncomfort. I keep almost always in the one room. I shouldn't be in the\nway if anyone came. I've been afraid, Mr. Kirkwood, that perhaps you\nfeared to come lest, whilst I was not very well, it might have been an\ninconvenience to us. Please don't think that. I shall never--see either\nfriends or strangers unless it is absolutely needful.'\n\nThere was silence.\n\n'You do feel much better, I hope?' fell from Sidney's lips.\n\n'Much stronger. It's only my mind; everything is so dark to me. You\nknow how little patience I always had. It was enough if any one said,\n'You _must_ do this,' or 'You _must_ put up with that'--at once I\nresisted. It was my nature; I couldn't bear the feeling of control.\nThat's what I've had to struggle with since I recovered from my\ndelirium at the hospital, and hadn't even the hope of dying. Can you\nput yourself in my place, and imagine what I have suffered?'\n\nSidney was silent. His own life had not been without its passionate\nmiseries, but the modulations of this voice which had no light of\ncountenance to aid it raised him above the plane of common experience\nand made actual to him the feelings he knew only in romantic story. He\ncould not stir, lest the slightest sound should jar on her speaking.\nHis breath rose visibly upon the chill air, but the discomfort of the\nroom was as indifferent to him as to his companion. Clara rose, as if\nimpelled by mental anguish; she stretched out her hand to the\nmantel-piece, and so stood, between him and the light, her admirable\nfigure designed on a glimmering background.\n\n'I know why you say nothing,' she continued, abruptly but without\nresentment. 'You cannot use words of sympathy which would be anything\nbut formal, and you prefer to let me understand that. It is like you.\nOh, you mustn't think I mean the phrase as a reproach. Anything but\nthat. I mean that you were always honest, and time hasn't changed\nyou--in that.' A slight, very slight, tremor on the close. 'I'd rather\nyou behaved to me like your old self. A sham sympathy would drive me\nmad.'\n\n'I said nothing,' he replied, 'only because words seemed meaningless.'\n\n'Not only that. You feel for me, I know, because you are not heartless;\nbut at the same time you obey your reason, which tells you that all I\nsuffer comes of my own self-will.'\n\n'I should like you to think better of me than that. I'm not one of\nthose people, I hope, who use every accident to point a moral, and\nbegin by inventing the moral to suit their own convictions. I know all\nthe details of your misfortune.'\n\n'Oh, wasn't it cruel that she should take such revenge upon me!' Her\nvoice rose in unrestrained emotion. 'Just because she envied me that\npoor bit of advantage over her! How could I be expected to refuse the\nchance that was offered? It would have been no use; she couldn't have\nkept the part. And I was so near success. I had never had a chance of\nshowing what I could do. It wasn't much of a part, really, but it was\nthe lead, at all events, and it would have made people pay attention to\nme. You don't know how strongly I was always drawn to the stage; there\nI found the work for which I was meant. And I strove so hard to make my\nway. I had no friends, no money. I earned only just enough to supply my\nneeds. I know what people think about actresses. Mr. Kirkwood, do you\nimagine I have been living at my ease, congratulating myself that I had\nescaped from all hardships?'\n\nHe could not raise his eyes. As she still awaited his answer, he said\nin rather a hard voice:\n\n'As I have told you, I read all the details that were published.\n\n'Then you know that I was working hard and honestly--working far, far\nharder than when I lived in Clerkenwell Close. But I don't know why I\nam talking to you about it. It's all over. I went my own way, and I all\nbut won what I fought for. You may very well say, what's the use of\nmourning over one's fate?'\n\nSidney had risen.\n\n'You were strong in your resolve to succeed,' he said gravely, 'and you\nwill find strength to meet even this trial.'\n\n'A weaker woman would suffer far less. One with a little more strength\nof character would kill herself.'\n\n'No. In that you mistake. You have not yourself only to think of. It\nwould be an easy thing to put an end to your life. You have a duty to\nyour father.'\n\nShe bent her head.\n\n'I think of him. He is goodness itself to me. There are fathers who\nwould have shut the door in my face. I know better now than I could\nwhen I was only a child how hard his life has been; he and I are like\neach other so many ways; he has always been fighting against cruel\ncircumstances. It's right that you, who have been his true and helpful\nfriend, should remind me of my duty to him.'\n\nA pause; then Sidney asked:\n\n'Do you wish me to speak to him very soon about your finding\noccupation?'\n\n'If you will. If you could think of anything.'\n\nHe moved, but still delayed his offer to take leave.\n\n'You said just now,' Clara continued, falteringly, 'that you did not\ntry to express sympathy, because words seemed of no use. How am I to\nfind words of thanks to you for coming here and listening to what I had\nto say?'\n\n'But surely so simple an act of friendship--'\n\n'Have I so many friends? And what right have I to look to you for an\nact of kindness? Did I merit it by my words when I last--'\n\nThere came a marvellous change--a change such as it needed either\nexquisite feeling or the genius of simulation to express by means so\nsimple. Unable to show him by a smile, by a light in her eyes, what\nmood had come upon her, what subtle shifting in the direction of her\nthought had checked her words--by her mere movement as she stepped\nlightly towards him, by the carriage of her head, by her hands half\nheld out and half drawn back again, she prepared him for what she was\nabout to say. No piece of acting was ever more delicately finished. He\nknew that she smiled, though nothing of her face was visible; he knew\nthat her look was one of diffident, half-blushing pleasure. And then\ncame the sweetness of her accents, timorous, joyful, scarcely to be\nrecognised as the voice which an instant ago had trembled sadly in\nself-reproach.\n\n'But that seems to you so long ago, doesn't it? You can forgive me now.\nFather has told me what happiness you have found, and I--I am so glad!'\n\nSidney drew back a step, involuntarily; the movement came of the shock\nwith which he heard her make such confident reference to the supposed\nrelations between himself and Jane Snowdon. He reddened--stood mute.\nFor a few seconds his mind was in the most painful whirl and conflict;\na hundred impressions, arguments, apprehensions, crowded upon him, each\nwith its puncturing torment. And Clara stood there waiting for his\nreply, in the attitude of consummate grace.\n\n'Of course I know what you speak of,' he said at length, with the\nbluntness of confusion. 'But your father was mistaken. I don't know who\ncan have led him to believe that--It's a mistake, altogether.'\n\nSidney would not have believed that anyone could so completely rob him\nof self-possession, least of all Clara Hewett. His face grew still more\nheated. He was angry with he knew not whom, he knew not why--perhaps\nwith himself in the first instance.\n\n'A mistake?' Clara murmured, under her breath. 'Oh, you mean people\nhave been too hasty in speaking about it. Do pardon me. I ought never\nto have taken such a liberty--but I felt--'\n\nShe hesitated.\n\n'It was no liberty at all. I dare say the mistake is natural enough to\nthose who know nothing of Miss Snowdon's circumstances. I myself,\nhowever, have no right to talk about her. But what you have been told\nis absolute error.'\n\nClara walked a few paces aside.\n\n'Again I ask you to forgive me.' Her tones had not the same clearness\nas hitherto. 'In any case, I had no right to approach such a subject in\nspeaking with you.'\n\n'Let us put it aside,' said Sidney, mastering himself. 'We were just\nagreeing that I should see your father, and make known your wish to\nhim.'\n\n'Thank you. I shall tell him, when I go upstairs, that you were the\nfriend whom I had asked to come here. I felt it to be so uncertain\nwhether you would come.'\n\n'I hope you couldn't seriously doubt it.'\n\n'You teach me to tell the truth. No. I knew too well your kindness. I\nknew that even to me--'\n\nSidney could converse no longer. He felt the need of being alone, to\nput his thoughts in order, to resume his experiences during this\nstrange hour. An extreme weariness was possessing him, as though he had\nbeen straining his intellect in attention to some difficult subject.\nAnd all at once the dank, cold atmosphere of the room struck into his\nblood; he had a fit of trembling.\n\n'Let us say good-bye for the present.'\n\nClara gave her hand silently. He touched it for the first time, and\ncould not but notice its delicacy; it was very warm, too, and moist.\nWithout speaking she went with him to the outer door. His footsteps\nsounded along the stone staircase; Clara listened until the last echo\nwas silent.\n\nShe too had begun to feel the chilly air. Hastily putting on her hat,\nshe took up the lamp, glanced round the room to see that nothing was\nleft in disorder, and hastened up to the fifth storey.\n\nIn the middle room, through which she had to pass, her father and Mr.\nEagles were talking together. The latter gave her a 'good-evening,'\nrespectful, almost as to a social superior. Within, Amy and Annie were\njust going to bed. She sat with them in her usual silence for a quarter\nof an hour, then, having ascertained that Eagles was gone into his own\nchamber, went out to speak to her father.\n\n'My friend came,' she said. 'Do you suspect who it was?'\n\n'Why, no, I can't guess, Clara.'\n\n'Haven't you thought of Mr. Kirkwood?'\n\n'You don't mean that?'\n\n'Father, you are quite mistaken about Jane Snowdon--quite.'\n\nJohn started up from his seat.\n\n'Has he told you so, himself?'\n\n'Yes. But listen; you are not to say a word on that subject to him. You\nwill be very careful, father?'\n\nJohn gazed at her wonderingly. She kissed his forehead, and withdrew to\nthe other room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nA HAVEN\n\nJohn Hewett no longer had membership in club or society. The loss of\nhis insurance-money made him for the future regard all such\ninstitutions with angry suspicion. 'Workin' men ain't satisfied with\nbein' robbed by the upper classes; they must go and rob one another.'\nHe had said good-bye to Clerkenwell Green; the lounging crowd no longer\nfound amusement in listening to his frenzied voice and in watching the\ncontortions of his rugged features. He discussed the old subjects with\nEagles, but the latter's computative mind was out of sympathy with zeal\nof the tumid description; though quite capable of working himself into\nmadness on the details of the Budget, John was easily soothed by his\nfriend's calmer habits of debate. Kirkwood's influence, moreover, was\nagain exerting itself upon him--an influence less than ever likely to\nencourage violence of thought or speech. In Sidney's company the worn\nrebel became almost placid; his rude, fretted face fell into a singular\nhumility and mildness. Having ended by accepting what he would formerly\nhave called charity, and that from a man whom he had wronged with\nobstinate perverseness, John neither committed the error of obtruding\nhis gratitude, nor yet suffered it to be imagined that obligation sat\nupon him too lightly. He put no faith in Sidney's assertion that some\nunknown benefactor was to be thanked for the new furniture; one and the\nsame pocket had supplied that and the money for Mrs. Hewett's burial.\nGratitude was all very well, but he could not have rested without\ntaking some measures towards a literal repayment of his debt. The\nweekly coppers which had previously gone for club subscriptions were\nnow put away in a money-box; they would be long enough in making an\nappreciable sum, but yet, if he himself could never discharge the\nobligation, his children must take it up after him, and this he\nfrequently impressed upon Amy, Annie, and Tom.\n\nNothing, however, could have detached John's mind so completely from\nits habits of tumult, nor have fixed it so firmly upon the interests of\nhome, as his recovery of his daughter. From the day of Clara's\nestablishment under his roof he thought of her, and of her only. Whilst\nworking at the filter-factory he remained in imagination by her side,\nceaselessly repeating her words of the night before, eagerly looking\nfor the hour that would allow him to return to her. Joy and trouble\nmingled in an indescribable way to constitute his ordinary mood; one\nmoment he would laugh at a thought, and before a companion could glance\nat him his gladness would be overshadowed as if with the heaviest\nanxiety. Men who saw him day after day said at this time that he seemed\nto be growing childish; he muttered to himself a good deal, and looked\nblankly at you when you addressed him. In the course of a fortnight his\nstate became more settled, but it was not the cheerful impulse that\npredominated. Out of the multitude of thoughts concerning Clara, one\nhad fixed itself as the main controller of his reflection.\nCharacteristically, John hit upon what seemed an irremediable\nmisfortune, and brooded over it with all his might. If only Sidney\nKirkwood were in the same mind as four years ago!\n\nAnd now was he to believe that what he had been told about Sidney and\nJane Snowdon was misleading? Was the impossible no longer so? He almost\nleapt from his chair when he heard that Sidney was the visitor with\nwhom his daughter had been having her private conversation. How came\nthey to make this appointment? There was something in Clara's voice\nthat set his nerves a-tremble. That night he could not sleep, and next\nmorning he went to work with a senile quiver in his body. For the first\ntime for more than two months he turned into a public-house on his way,\njust to give himself a little 'tone.' The natural result of such a\ntonic was to heighten the fever of his imagination; goodness knows how\nfar he had got in a drama of happiness before he threw off his coat and\nsettled to his day's labour.\n\nClara, in the meanwhile, suffered a corresponding agitation, more\npenetrative in proportion to the finer substance of her nature. She did\nnot know until the scene was over how much vital force it had cost her;\nwhen she took off the veil a fire danced before her eyes, and her limbs\nached and trembled as she lay down in the darkness. All night long she\nwas acting her part over and over; when she woke up, it was always at\nthe point where Sidney replied to her, 'But you are mistaken!'\n\nActing her part; yes, but a few hours had turned the make-believe into\nsomething earnest enough. She could not now have met Kirkwood with the\nself-possession of last evening. The fever that then sustained her was\nmuch the same as she used to know before she had thoroughly accustomed\nherself to appearing in front of an audience; it exalted all her\nfaculties, gifted her with a remarkable self-consciousness. It was all\nvery well as long as there was need of it, but why did it afflict her\nin this torturing form now that she desired to rest, to think of what\nshe had gained, of what hope she might reasonably nourish? The purely\nselfish project which, in her desperation, had seemed the only resource\nremaining to her against a life of intolerable desolateness, was taking\nhold upon her in a way she could not understand. Had she not already\nmade a discovery that surpassed all expectation? Sidney Kirkwood was\nnot bound to another woman; why could she not accept that as so much\nclear gain, and deliberate as to her next step? She had been fully\nprepared for the opposite state of things, prepared to strive against\nany odds, to defy all probabilities, all restraints; why not thank her\nfortune and plot collectedly now that the chances were so much improved?\n\nBut from the beginning of her interview with him, Clara knew that\nsomething more entered into her designs on Sidney than a cold\nself-interest. She had never loved him; she never loved anyone; yet the\ninclinations of her early girlhood had been drawn by the force of the\nlove he offered her, and to this day she thought of him with a respect\nand liking such as she had for no other man. When she heard from her\nfather that Sidney had forgotten her, had found some one by whom his\nlove was prized, her instant emotion was so like a pang of jealousy\nthat she marvelled at it. Suppose fate had prospered her, and she had\nheard in the midst of triumphs that Sidney Kirkwood, the working man in\nClerkenwell, was going to marry a girl he loved, would any feeling of\nthis kind have come to her? Her indifference would have been complete.\nIt was calamity that made her so sensitive. Self-pity longs for the\ncompassion of others. That Sidney, who was once her slave, should stand\naloof in freedom now that she wanted sympathy so sorely, this was a\nwound to her heart. That other woman had robbed her of something she\ncould not spare.\n\nJane Snowdon, too! She found it scarcely conceivable that the wretched\nlittle starveling of Mrs. Peckover's kitchen should have grown into\nanything that a man like Sidney could love. To be sure, there was a\nmystery in her lot. Clara remembered perfectly how Scawthorne pointed\nout of the cab at the old man Snowdon, and said that he was very rich.\nA miser, or what? More she had never tried to discover. Now Sidney\nhimself had hinted at something in Jane's circumstances which, he\nprofessed, put it out of the question that he could contemplate\nmarrying her. Had he told her the truth? Could she in fact consider him\nfree? Might there not be some reason for his wishing to keep a secret?\n\nWith burning temples, with feverish lips, she moved about her little\nroom like an animal in a cage, finding the length of the day\nintolerable. She was constrained to inaction, when it seemed to her\nthat every moment in which she did not do something to keep Sidney in\nmind of her was worse than lost. Could she not see that girl, Jane\nSnowdon? But was not Sidney's denial as emphatic as it could be? She\nrecalled his words, and tried numberless interpretations. Would\nanything that he had said bear being interpreted as a sign that\nsomething of the old tenderness still lived in him? And the strange\nthing was, that she interrogated herself on these points not at all\nlike a coldly scheming woman, who aims at something that is to be won,\nif at all, by the subtlest practising on another's emotions, whilst she\nremains unaffected. Rather like a woman who loves passionately, whose\nardour and jealous dread wax moment by moment.\n\nFor what was she scheming? For food, clothing, assured comfort during\nher life? Twenty-four hours ago Clara would most likely have believed\nthat she had indeed fallen to this; but the meeting with Sidney\nenlightened her. Least of all women could _she_ live by bread alone;\nthere was the hunger of her brain, the hunger of her heart. I spoke\nonce, you remember, of her 'defect of tenderness;' the fault remained,\nbut her heart was no longer so sterile of the tender emotions as when\nrevolt and ambition absorbed all her energies. She had begun to feel\ngently towards her father; it was an intimation of the need which would\npresently bring all the forces of her nature into play. She dreaded a\nlife of drudgery; she dreaded humiliation among her inferiors; but that\nwhich she feared most of all was the barrenness of a lot into which\nwould enter none of the passionate joys of existence. Speak to Clara of\nrenunciation, of saintly glories, of the stony way of perfectness, and\nyou addressed her in an unknown tongue; nothing in her responded to\nthese ideas. Hopelessly defeated in the one way of aspiration which\npromised a large life, her being, rebellious against the martyrdom it\nhad suffered, went forth eagerly towards the only happiness which was\nany longer attainable. Her beauty was a dead thing; never by that means\ncould she command homage. But there is love, ay, and passionate love,\nwhich can be independent of mere charm of face. In one man only could\nshe hope to inspire it; successful in that, she would taste victory,\nand even in this fallen estate could make for herself a dominion.\n\nIn these few hours she so wrought upon her imagination as to believe\nthat the one love of her life had declared itself. She revived every\nmemory she possibly could of those years on the far side of the gulf,\nand convinced herself that even then she had loved Sidney. Other love\nof a certainty she had not known. In standing face to face with him\nafter so long an interval, she recognised the qualities which used to\nimpress her, and appraised them as formerly she could not. His features\nhad gained in attractiveness; the refinement which made them an index\nto his character was more noticeable at the first glance, or perhaps\nshe was better able to distinguish it. The slight bluntness in his\nmanner reminded her of the moral force which she had known only as\nsomething to be resisted; it was now one of the influences that drew\nher to him. Had she not always admitted that he stood far above the\nother men of his class whom she used to know? Between his mind and hers\nthere was distinct kinship; the sense that he had both power and right\nto judge her explained in a great measure her attitude of defiance\ntowards him when she was determined to break away from her humble\nconditions. All along, had not one of her main incentives to work and\nstrive been the resolve to justify herself in _his_ view, to prove to\n_him_ that she possessed talent, to show herself to _him_ as one whom\nthe world admired? The repugnance with which she thought of meeting\nhim, when she came home with her father, meant in truth that she\ndreaded to be assured that he could only shrink from her. All her vital\nforce-setting in this wild current, her self-deception complete, she\nexperienced the humility of supreme egoism--that state wherein self\nmultiplies its claims to pity in passionate support of its demand for\nthe object of desire. She felt capable of throwing herself at Sidney's\nfeet, and imploring him not to withdraw from her the love of which he\nhad given her so many assurances. She gazed at her scarred face until\nthe image was blurred with tears; then, as though there were luxury in\nweeping, sobbed for an hour, crouching down in a corner of her room.\nEven though his love were as dead as her beauty, must he not be struck\nto the heart with compassion, realising her woeful lot? She asked\nnothing more eagerly than to humiliate herself before him, to confess\nthat her pride was broken. Not a charge he could bring against her but\nBile would admit its truth. Had she been humble enough last night? When\nhe came again--and he must soon--she would throw aside every vestige of\ndignity, lest he should think that she was strong enough to bear her\nmisery alone. No matter how poor-spirited she seemed, if only she could\nmove his sympathies.\n\nPoor rebel heart! Beat for beat, in these moments it matched itself\nwith that of the purest woman who surrenders to a despairing love. Had\none charged her with insincerity, how vehemently would her conscience\nhave declared against the outrage! Natures such as hers are as little\nto be judged by that which is conventionally the highest standard as by\nthat which is the lowest. The tendencies which we agree to call good\nand had became in her merely directions of a native force which was at\nall times in revolt against circumstance. Characters thus moulded may\ngo far in achievement, but can never pass beyond the bounds of\nsuffering. Never is the world their friend, nor the world's law. As\noften as our conventions give us the opportunity, we crush them out of\nbeing; they are noxious; they threaten the frame of society. Oftenest\nthe crushing is done in such a way that the hapless creatures seem to\nhave brought about their own destruction. Let us congratulate\nourselves; in one way or other it is assured that they shall not\ntrouble us long.\n\nHer father was somewhat later than usual in returning from work. When\nhe entered her room she looked at him anxiously, and as he seemed to\nhave nothing particular to say, she asked if he had seen Mr. Kirkwood.\n\n'No, my dear, I ain't seen him.'\n\nTheir eyes met for an instant. Clara was in anguish at the thought that\nanother night and day must pass and nothing be altered.\n\n'When did you see him last? A week or more ago, wasn't it?'\n\n'About that.'\n\n'Couldn't you go round to his lodgings to-night? I know he's got\nsomething he wants to speak to you about.'\n\nHe assented. But on his going into the other room Eagles met him with a\nmessage from Sidney, anticipating his design, and requesting him to\nstep over to Red Lion Street in the course of the evening. John\ninstantly announced this to his daughter. She nodded, but said nothing.\n\nIn a few minutes John went on his way. The day's work had tired him\nexceptionally, doubtless owing to his nervousness, and again on the way\nto Sidney's he had recourse to a dose of the familiar stimulant. With\nour eyes on a man of Hewett's station we note these little things; we\nset them down as a point scored against him; yet if our business were\nwith a man of leisure, who, owing to worry, found his glass of wine at\nluncheon and again at dinner an acceptable support, we certainly should\nnot think of paying attention to the matter. Poverty makes a crime of\nevery indulgence. John himself came out of the public-house in a\nslinking way, and hoped Kirkwood might not scent the twopenny-worth of\ngin.\n\nSidney was in anything but a mood to detect this little lapse in his\nvisitor. He gave John a chair, but could not sit still himself. The\ngarret was a spacious one, and whilst talking he moved from wall to\nwall.\n\n'You know that I saw Clara last night? She told me she should mention\nit to you.'\n\n'Yes, yes. I was afraid she'd never have made up her mind to it. It was\nthe best way for you to see her alone first, poor girl! You won't mind\ncomin' to us now, like you used?'\n\n'Did she tell you what she wished to speak to me about?'\n\n'Why, no, she hasn't. Was there--anything particular?'\n\n'She feels the time very heavy on her hands. It seems you don't like\nthe thought of her looking for employment?'\n\nJohn rose from his chair and grasped the back of it.\n\n'You ain't a-goin' to encourage her to leave us? It ain't that you was\ntalkin' about, Sidney?'\n\n'Leave you? Why, where should she go?'\n\n'No, no; it's all right; so long as you wasn't thinkin' of her goin'\naway again. See, Sidney, I ain't got nothing to say against it, if she\ncan find some kind of job for home. I know as the time must hang heavy.\nThere she sit, poor thing! from mornin' to night, an' can't get her\nthoughts away from herself. It's easy enough to understand, ain't it? I\ntook a book home for her the other day, but she didn't seem to care\nabout it. There she sit, with her poor face on her hands, thinkin' and\nthinkin'. It breaks my heart to see her. I'd rather she had some work,\nbut she mustn't go away from home for it.'\n\nSidney took a few steps in silence.\n\n'You don't misunderstand me,' resumed the other, with suddenness. 'You\ndon't think as I won't trust her away from me. If she went, it 'ud be\nbecause she thinks herself a burden--as if I wouldn't gladly live on a\ncrust for my day's food an' spare her goin' among strangers! You can\nthink yourself what it 'ud be to her, Sidney. No, no, it mustn't be\nnothing o' that kind. But I can't ear to see her livin' as she does;\nit's no life at all. I sit with her when I get back home at night, an'\nI'm glad to say she seems to find it a pleasure to have me by her; but\nit's the only bit o' pleasure she gets, an' there's all the hours\nwhilst I'm away. You see she don't take much to Mrs. Eagles; that ain't\nher sort of friend. Not as she's got any pride left about her, poor\ngirl don't think that. I tell you, Sidney, she's a dear good girl to\nher old father. If I could only see her a bit happier, I'd never\ngrumble again as long as I lived, I wouldn't!'\n\nIs there such a thing in this world as speech that has but one simple\ninterpretation, one for him who utters it and for him who hears?\nHonester words were never spoken than these in which Hewett strove to\nrepresent Clara in a favourable light, and to show the pitifulness of\nher situation; yet he himself was conscious that they implied a second\nmeaning, and Sidney was driven restlessly about the room by his\nperception of the same lurking motive in their pathos. John felt\nhalf-ashamed of himself when he ceased; it was a new thing for him to\nbe practising subtleties with a view to his own ends. But had he said a\nword more than the truth?\n\nI suppose it was the association of contrast that turned Sidney's\nthoughts to Joseph Snowdon. At all events it was of him he was thinking\nin the silence that followed. Which silence having been broken by a tap\nat the door, oddly enough there stood Joseph himself. Hewett, taken by\nsurprise, showed embarrassment and awkwardness; it was always hard for\nhim to reconcile his present subordination to Mr. Snowdon with the\nfamiliar terms on which they had been not long ago.\n\n'Ah, you here, Hewett!' exclaimed Joseph, in a genial tone, designed to\nput the other at his ease. 'I just wanted a word with our friend. Never\nmind; some other time.'\n\nFor all that, he did not seem disposed to withdraw, but stood with a\nhand on the door, smiling. Sidney, having nodded to him, walked the\nlength of the room, his head bent and his hands behind him.\n\n'Suppose I look in u bit later,' said Hewett. 'Or tomorrow night,\nSidney?'\n\n'Very well, to-morrow night.'\n\nJohn took his leave, and on the visitor who remained Sidney turned a\nface almost of anger. Mr. Snowdon seated himself, supremely indifferent\nto the inconvenience he had probably caused. He seemed in excellent\nhumour.\n\n'Decent fellow, Hewett,' he observed, putting up one leg against the\nfireplace. 'Very decent fellow. He's getting old, unfortunately. Had a\ngood deal of trouble, I understand; it breaks a man up.'\n\nSidney scowled, and said nothing.\n\n'I thought I'd stay, as I _was_ here,' continued Joseph, unbuttoning\nhis respectable overcoat and throwing it open. 'There was something\nrather particular I had in mind. Won't you sit down?'\n\n'No, thank you.'\n\nJoseph glanced at him, and smiled all the more.\n\n'I've had a little talk with the old man about Jane. By-the-by, I'm\nsorry to say he's very shaky; doesn't look himself at all. I didn't\nknow you had spoken to him quite so--you know what I mean. It seems to\nbe his idea that everything's at an end between you.'\n\n'Perhaps so.'\n\n'Well, now, look here. You won't mind me just--Do you think it was wise\nto put it in that way to him? I'm afraid you're making him feel just a\nlittle uncertain about you. I'm speaking as a friend, you know. In your\nown interest, Kirkwood. Old men get queer ideas into their heads. You\nknow, he _might_ begin to think that you had some sort of--eh?'\n\nIt was not the second, nor yet the third, time that Joseph had looked\nin and begun to speak in this scrappy way, continuing the tone of that\ndialogue in which he had assumed a sort of community of interest\nbetween Kirkwood and himself. But the limit of Sidney's endurance was\nreached.\n\n'There's no knowing,' he exclaimed, 'what anyone may think of me, if\npeople who have their own ends to serve go spreading calumnies. Let us\nunderstand each other, and have done with it. I told Mr. Snowdon that I\ncould never be anything but a friend to Jane. I said it, and I meant\nit. If you've any doubt remaining, in a few days I hope it'll be\nremoved. What your real wishes maybe I don't know, and I shall never\nafter this have any need to know. I can't help speaking in this way,\nand I want to tell you once for all that there shall never again be a\nword about Jane between us. Wait a day or two, and you'll know the\nreason.'\n\nJoseph affected an air of gravity--of offended dignity.\n\n'That's rather a queer sort of way to back out of your engagements,\nKirkwood. I won't say anything about myself, but with regard to my\ndaughter--'\n\n'What do you mean by speaking like that?' cried the young man, sternly.\n'You know very well that it's what you wish most of all, to put an end\nto everything between your daughter and me!  You've succeeded; be\nsatisfied. If you've anything to say to me on any other subject, say\nit. If not, please let's have done for the present. I don't feel in a\nmood for beating about the bush any longer.'\n\n'You've misunderstood me altogether, Kirkwood,' said Joseph, unable to\nconceal a twinkle of satisfaction in his eyes.\n\n'No; I've understood you perfectly well--too well. I don't want to hear\nanother word on the subject, and I won't. It's over; understand that.'\n\n'Well, well; you're a bit out of sorts. I'll say good-bye for the\npresent.'\n\nHe retired, and for a long time Sidney sat in black brooding.\n\nJohn Hewett did not fail to present himself next evening. As he entered\nthe room he was somewhat surprised at the cheerful aspect with which\nSidney met him; the grasp which his hand received seemed to have a\nsignificance. Sidney, after looking at him steadily, asked if he had\nnot been home.\n\n'Yes, I've been home. Why do you want to know?'\n\n'Hadn't Clara anything to tell you?'\n\n'No. What is it?'\n\n'Did she know you were coming here?'\n\n'Why, yes; I mentioned it.'\n\nSidney again regarded him fixedly, with a smile.\n\n'I suppose she preferred that I should tell you. I looked in at the\nBuildings this afternoon, and had a talk with Clara.'\n\nJohn hung upon his words, with lips slightly parted, with a trembling\nin the hairs of his grey beard.\n\n'You did?'\n\n'I had something to ask her, so I went when she was likely to be alone.\nIt's a long while ago since I asked her the question for the first\ntime--but I've got the right answer at last.'\n\nJohn stared at him in pathetic agitation.\n\n'You mean to tell me you've asked Clara to marry you?'\n\n'There's nothing very dreadful in that, I should think.'\n\n'Give us your hand again! Sidney Kirkwood, give us your hand again! If\nthere's a good-hearted man in this world, if there's a faithful, honest\nman, as only lives to do kindness--What am I to say to you? It's too\nmuch for me. I can't find a word as I'd wish to speak. Stand out and\nlet's look at you. You make me as I can't neither speak nor see--I'm\njust like a child--'\n\nHe broke down utterly, and shook with the choking struggle of laughter\nand sobs. His emotion affected Sidney, who looked pale and troubled in\nspite of the smile still clinging feebly about his lips.\n\n'If it makes you glad to hear it,' said the young man, in an uncertain\nvoice, 'I'm all the more glad myself, on that account.'\n\n'Makes me glad? That's no word for it, boy; that's no word for it! Give\nus your hand again. I feel as if I'd ought to go down on my old knees\nand crave your pardon. If only she could have lived to see this, the\npoor woman as died when things was at their worst! If I'd only listened\nto her there'd never have been them years of unfriendliness between us.\nYou've gone on with one kindness after another, but this is more than I\ncould ever a' thought possible. Why, I took it for certain as you was\ngoin' to marry that other young girl; they told me as it was all\nsettled.'\n\n'A mistake.'\n\n'I'd never have dared to hope it, Sidney. The one thing as I wished\nmore than anything else on earth, and I couldn't think ever to see it.\nGlad's no word for what I feel. And to think as my girl kep' it from\nme! Yes, yes; there was something on her face; I remember it now. \"I'm\njust goin' round to have a word with Sidney,\" I says. \"Are you,\nfather?\" she says. \"Don't stay too long.\" And she had a sort o' smile I\ncouldn't quite understand. She'll be a good wife to you, Sidney. Her\nheart's softened to all as she used to care for. She'll be a good and\nfaithful wife to you as long as she lives. But I must go back home and\nspeak to her. There ain't a man livin', let him be as rich as he may,\nthat feels such happiness as you've given me to-night.'\n\nHe went stumbling down the stairs, and walked homewards at a great\nspeed, so that when he reached the Buildings he had to wipe his face\nand stand for a moment before beginning the ascent. The children were\nat their home lessons; he astonished them by flinging his hat\nmirthfully on to the table.\n\n'Now then, father!' cried young Tom, the eight-year-old, whose pen was\nknocked out of his hand.\n\nWith a chuckle John advanced to Clara's room. As he closed the door\nbehind him she rose. His face was mottled; there were tear-stains about\nhis eyes, and he had a wild, breathless look.\n\n'An' you never told me! You let me go without half a word!'\n\nClara put her hands upon his shoulders and kissed him. 'I didn't quite\nknow whether it was true or not, father.'\n\n'My darling! My dear girl! Come an' sit on my knee, like you used to\nwhen you was a little 'un. I'm a rough old father for such as you, but\nnobody'll never love you better than I do, an' always have done. So\nhe's been faithful to you, for all they said. There ain't a better man\nlivin'! \"It's a long time since I first asked the question,\" he says,\n\"but she's give me the right answer at last.\" And he looks that glad of\nit.'\n\n'He does? You're sure he does?'\n\n'Sure? Why, you should a' seen him when I went into the room! There's\nnothing more as I wish for now. I only hope I may live a while longer,\nto see you forget all your troubles, my dear. He'll make you happy,\nwill Sidney; he's got a deal more education than anyone else I ever\nknew, and you'll suit each other. But you won't forget all about your\nold father? You'll let me come an' have a talk with you now and then,\nmy dear, just you an' me together, you know?'\n\n'I shall love you and be grateful to you always, father. You've kept a\nwarm heart for me all this time.'\n\n'I couldn't do nothing else, Clara; you've always been what I loved\nmost, and you always will be.'\n\n'If I hadn't had you to come back to, what would have become of me?'\n\n'We'll never think of that. We'll never speak another word of that.'\n\n'Father--Oh, if I had my face again! If I had my own face!'\n\nA great anguish shook her; she lay in his arms and sobbed. It was the\nfarewell, even in her fulness of heart and deep sense of consolation,\nto all she had most vehemently desired, Gratitude and self-pity being\nindivisible in her emotions, she knew not herself whether the ache of\nregret or the soothing restfulness of deliverance made her tears flow.\nBut at least there was no conscious duplicity, and for the moment no\ndoubt that she had found her haven. It is a virtuous world, and our\nfrequent condemnations are invariably based on justice; will it be\ngreatly harmful if for once we temper our righteous judgment with ever\nso little mercy?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nA FALL FROM THE IDEAL\n\nJoseph Snowdon waxed daily in respectability. He was, for one thing,\nclothing himself in flesh, and, though still anything but a portly man,\nbore himself as becomes one who can indulge a taste for eating and\ndrinking; his step was more deliberate, he no longer presented the\nsuppleness of limb that so often accompanies a needy condition in the\nman of wits, he grew attentive to his personal equipment, he was always\nwell combed and well shaven, and generally, in hours of leisure, you\nperceived a fragrance breathing from his handkerchief. Nor was this\nrefinement addressed only to the public. To Clem he behaved with a\ncorrectness which kept that lady in a state of acute suspicion; not\nseldom he brought her a trifling gift, which he would offer with\ncompliments, and he made a point of consulting her pleasure or\nconvenience in all matters that affected them in common. A similar\ndignity of bearing marked his relations with Hanover Street. When he\nentered Jane's parlour it was with a beautiful blending of familiarity\nand courtesy; he took his daughter's hand with an air of graceful\naffection, retaining it for a moment between his own, and regarding her\nwith a gentle smile which hinted the pride of a parent. In speaking\nwith the old man he habitually subdued his voice, respectfully bending\nforward, solicitously watching the opportunity of a service. Michael\nhad pleasure in his company and conversation. Without overdoing it,\nJoseph accustomed himself to speak of philanthropic interests. He\npropounded a scheme for supplying the poor with a certain excellent\nfilter at a price all but nominal; who did not know the benefit to\nhumble homes of pure water for use as a beverage? The filter was not\nmade yet, but Lake, Snowdon, & Co., had it under their consideration.\n\nMichael kept his room a good deal in these wretched days of winter, so\nthat Joseph had no difficulty in obtaining private interviews with his\ndaughter. Every such occasion he used assiduously, his great end being\nto possess himself of Jane's confidence. He did not succeed quite so\nwell with the girl as with her grandfather; there was always a reserve\nin her behaviour which as yet he found it impossible to overcome.\nObservation led him to conclude that much of this arose from the view\nshe took of his relations with Sidney Kirkwood. Jane was in love with\nSidney; on that point he could have no doubt; and in all likelihood she\nregarded him as unfriendly to Sidney's suit--women are so shrewd in\nthese affairs. Accordingly, Joseph made it his business by artful\ndegrees to remove this prepossession from her mind. In the course of\nthis endeavour he naturally pressed into his service the gradually\ndiscovered fact that Sidney had scruples of conscience regarding Jane's\nfortune. Marvellous as it appeared to him, he had all but come to the\nconclusion that this _was_ a fact. Now, given Jane's character, which\nhe believed he had sounded; given her love for Kirkwood, which was\nobviously causing her anxiety and unhappiness; Joseph saw his way to an\nadmirable piece of strategy. What could be easier, if he played his\ncards well and patiently enough, than to lead Jane to regard the\nfortune as her most threatening enemy? Valuable results might come of\nthat, whether before or after the death of the old man.\n\nThe conversation in which he first ventured to strike this note\nundisguisedly took place on the same evening as that unpleasant scene\nwhen Sidney as good as quarrelled with him--the evening before the day\non which Sidney asked Clara Hewett to be his wife. Having found Jane\nalone, he began to talk in his most paternal manner, his chair very\nnear hers, his eyes fixed on her sewing. And presently, when the ground\nwas prepared:\n\n'Jane, there's something I've been wanting to say to you for a long\ntime. My dear, I'm uneasy about you.'\n\n'Uneasy, father?' and she glanced at him nervously.\n\n'Yes, I'm uneasy. But whether I ought to tell you why, I'm sure I don't\nknow. You're my own child, Janey, and you become dearer to me every\nday; but--it's hard to say it--there naturally isn't all the confidence\nbetween us that there might have been if--well, well, I won't speak of\nthat.'\n\n'But won't you tell me what makes you anxious?'\n\nHe laid the tips of his fingers on her head. 'Janey, shall you be\noffended if I speak about Mr. Kirkwood?'\n\n'No, father.'\n\nShe tried in vain to continue sewing.\n\n'My dear--I believe there's no actual engagement between you?'\n\n'Oh no, father,' she replied, faintly.\n\n'And yet--don't be angry with me, my child--I think you are something\nmore than friends?'\n\nShe made no answer.\n\n'And I can't help thinking, Janey--I think about you very often\nindeed--that Mr. Kirkwood has rather exaggerated views about the\nnecessity of--of altering things between you.'\n\nQuite recently Joseph had become aware of the understanding between\nMichael and Kirkwood. The old man still hesitated to break the news to\nJane, saying to himself that it was better for Sidney to prepare her by\nthe change in his behaviour.\n\n'Of altering things?' Jane repeated, under her breath.\n\n'It seems to me wrong--wrong to both of you,' Joseph pursued, in a\npathetic voice. 'I can't help noticing my child's looks. I know she\nisn't what she used to be, poor little girl! And I know Kirkwood isn't\nwhat he used to be. It's very hard, and I feel for you--for both of\nyou.'\n\nJane sat motionless, not daring to lift her eyes, scarcely daring to\nbreathe.\n\n'Janey.'\n\n'Yes, father.'\n\n'I wonder whether I'm doing wrong to your grandfather in speaking to\nyou confidentially like this? I can't believe he notices things as I\ndo; he'd never wish you to be unhappy.'\n\n'But I don't quite understand, father. What do you mean about Mr.\nKirkwood? Why should he--'\n\nThe impulse failed her. A fear which she had harboured for many weary\ndays was being confirmed and she could not ask directly for the word\nthat would kill hope.\n\n'Have I a right to tell you? I thought perhaps you understood.'\n\n'As you have gone so far, I think you must explain. I don't see how you\ncan be doing wrong.'\n\n'Poor Kirkwood! You see, he's in such a delicate position, my dear. I\nthink myself that he's acting rather strangely, after everything; but\nit's--it's your money, Jane. He doesn't think he ought to ask you to\nmarry him, under the circumstances.'\n\nShe trembled.\n\n'Now who should stand by you, in a case like this, if not your own\nfather? Of course he can't say a word to you himself; and of course you\ncan't say a word to him; and altogether it's a pitiful business.'\n\nJane shrank from discussing such a topic with her father. Her next\nwords were uttered with difficulty.\n\n'But the money isn't my own--it'll never be my own. He--Mr. Kirkwood\nknows that.'\n\n'He does, to be sure. But it makes no difference. He has told your\ngrandfather, my love, that--that the responsibility would be too great.\nHe has told him distinctly that everything's at an end--everything that\n_might_ have happened.'\n\nShe just looked at him, then dropped her eyes on her sewing.\n\n'Now, as your father, Janey, I know it's right that you should be told\nof this. I feel you're being very cruelly treated, my child. And I wish\nto goodness I could only see any way out of it for you both. Of course\nI'm powerless either for acting or speaking: you can understand that.\nBut I want you to think of me as your truest friend, my love.'\n\nMore still he said, but Jane had no ears for it. When he left her, she\nbade him good-bye mechanically, and stood on the same spot by the door,\nwithout thought, stunned by what she had learnt.\n\nThat Sidney would be impelled to such a decision as this she had never\nimagined. His reserve whilst yet she was in ignorance of her true\nposition she could understand: also his delaying for a while even after\neverything had been explained to her. But that he should draw away from\nher altogether seemed inexplicable, for it implied a change in him\nwhich nothing had prepared her to think possible. Unaltered in his\nlove, he refused to share the task of her life, to aid in the work\nwhich he regarded with such fervent sympathy. Her mind was not subtle\nenough to conceive those objections to Michael's idea which had weighed\nwith Sidney almost from the first, for though she had herself shrunk\nfrom the great undertaking, it was merely in weakness--a reason she\nnever dreamt of attributing to him. Nor had she caught as much as a\nglimpse of those base, scheming interests, contact with which had\naroused Sidney's vehement disgust. Was her father to be trusted? This\nwas the first question that shaped itself in her mind. He did not like\nSidney; that she had felt all along, as well as the reciprocal coldness\non Sidney's part. But did his unfriendliness go so far as to prompt him\nto intervene with untruths? 'Of course you can't say a word to\nhim'--that remark would bear an evil interpretation, which her\ntormented mind did not fail to suggest. Moreover, he had seemed so\nanxious that she should not broach the subject with her grandfather.\nBut what constrained her to silence? If, indeed, he had nothing but her\nhappiness at heart, he could not take it ill that she should seek to\nunderstand the whole truth, and Michael must tell her whether Sidney\nhad indeed thus spoken to him.\n\nBefore she had obtained any show of control over her agitation Michael\ncame into the room. Evening was the old man's best time, and when he\nhad kept his own chamber through the day he liked to come and sit with\nJane as she had her supper.\n\n'Didn't I hear your father's voice?' he asked, as he moved slowly to\nhis accustomed chair.\n\n'Yes. He couldn't stay.'\n\nJane stood in an attitude of indecision. Having seated himself, Michael\nglanced at her. His regard had not its old directness; it seemed\napprehensive, as if seeking to probe her thought.\n\n'Has Miss Lant sent you the book she promised?'\n\n'Yes, grandfather.'\n\nThis was a recently published volume dealing with charitable enterprise\nin some part of London. Michael noticed with surprise the uninterested\ntone of Jane's reply. Again he looked at her, and more searchingly.\n\n'Would you like to read me a little of it?'\n\nShe reached the book from a side-table, drew near, and stood turning\nthe pages. The confusion of her mind was such that she could not have\nread a word with understanding. Then she spoke, involuntarily.\n\n'Grandfather, has Mr. Kirkwood said anything more--about me?'\n\nThe words made painful discord in her ears, but instead of showing\nheightened colour she grew pallid. Holding the book partly open, she\nfelt all her nerves and muscles strained as if in some physical effort;\nher feet were rooted to the spot.\n\n'Have you heard anything from him?' returned the old man, resting his\nhands on the sides of the easy-chair.\n\n'Father has been speaking about him. He says Mr. Kirkwood has told you\nsomething.'\n\n'Yes. Come and sit down by me, Jane.'\n\nShe could not move nearer. Though unable to form a distinct conception,\nshe felt a foreboding of what must come to pass. The dread failure of\nstrength was more than threatening her; her heart was sinking, and by\nno effort of will could she summon the thoughts that should aid her\nagainst herself.\n\n'What has your father told you?' Michael asked, when he perceived her\ndistress. He spoke with a revival of energy, clearly, commandingly.\n\n'He says that Mr. Kirkwood wishes you to forget what he told you, and\nwhat you repeated to me.'\n\n'Did he give you any reason?'\n\n'Yes. I don't understand, though.'\n\n'Come here by me, Jane. Let's talk about it quietly. Sidney doesn't\nfeel able to help you as he thought he could. We mustn't blame him for\nthat; he must judge for himself. He thinks it'll be better if you\ncontinue to be only friends.'\n\nJane averted her face, his steady look being more than she could bear.\nFor an instant a sense of uttermost shame thrilled through her, and\nwithout knowing what she did, she moved a little and laid the book down.\n\n'Come here, my child,' he repeated, in a gentler voice.\n\nShe approached him.\n\n'You feel it hard. But when you've thought about it a little you won't\ngrieve; I'm sure you won't. Remember, your life is not to be like that\nof ordinary women. You've higher objects before you, and you'll find a\nhigher reward. You know that, don't you? There's no need for me to\nremind you of what we've talked about so often, is there? If it's a\nsacrifice, you're strong enough to face it; yes, yes, strong enough to\nface more than this, my Jane is! Only fix your thoughts on the work\nyou're going to do. It'll take up all your life, Jane, won't it? You'll\nhave no time to give to such things as occupy other women--no mind for\nthem.'\n\nHis grey eyes searched her countenance with that horrible intensity of\nfanaticism which is so like the look of cruelty, of greed, of any\npassion originating in the baser self. Unlike too, of course, but it is\nthe pitilessness common to both extremes that shows most strongly in an\nold, wrinkled visage. He had laid his hand upon her. Every word was a\nstab in the girl's heart, and so dreadful became her torture, so\nintolerable the sense of being drawn by a fierce will away from all she\ndesired, that at length a cry escaped her lips. She fell on her knees\nby him, and pleaded in a choking voice.\n\n'I can't! Grandfather, don't ask it of me! Give it all to some one\nelse--to some one else! I'm not strong enough to make such a sacrifice.\nLet me be as I was before!'\n\nMichael's face darkened. He drew his hand away and rose from the seat;\nwith more than surprise, with anger and even bitterness, he looked down\nat the crouching girl. She did not sob; her face buried in her arms,\nshe lay against the chair, quivering, silent.\n\n'Jane, stand up and speak to me!'\n\nShe did not move.\n\n'Jane!'\n\nHe laid his hand on her. Jane raised her head, and endeavoured to obey\nhim; in the act she moaned and fell insensible.\n\nMichael strode to the door and called twice or thrice for Mrs. Byass;\nthen he stooped by the lifeless girl and supported her head. Bessie was\nimmediately at hand, with a cry of consternation, but also with helpful\nactivity.\n\n'Why, I thought she'd got over this; it's a long time since she was\ntook last isn't it? Sam's downstairs, Mr. Snowdon; do just shout out to\nhim to go for some brandy. Tell him to bring my smelling-bottle first,\nif he knows where it is--I'm blest if I do! Poor thing! She ain't been\nat all well lately, and that's the truth.'\n\nThe truth, beyond a doubt. Pale face, showing now the thinness which it\nhad not wholly outgrown, the inheritance from miserable childhood; no\nface of a stern heroine, counting as idle all the natural longings of\nthe heart, consecrated to a lifelong combat with giant wrongs. Nothing\nbetter nor worse than the face of one who can love and must be loved in\nturn.\n\nShe came to herself, and at the same moment Michael went from the room.\n\n'There now; there now,' crooned Bessie, with much patting of the hands\nand stroking of the checks. 'Why, what's come to you, Jane? Cry away;\ndon't try to prevent yourself; it'll do you good to cry a bit. Of\ncourse, here comes Sam with all sorts of things, when there's no need\nof him. He's always either too soon or too late, is Sam. Just look at\nhim, Jane; now if _he_ don't make you laugh, nothing will!'\n\nMr. Byass retired, shamefaced. Leaning against Bessie's shoulder, Jane\nsobbed for a long time, sobbed in the misery of shame. She saw that her\ngrandfather had gone away. How should she ever face him after this? It\nwas precious comfort to feel Bessie's sturdy arms about her, and to\nhear the foolish affectionate words, which asked nothing but that she\nshould take them kindly and have done with her trouble.\n\n'Did grandfather tell you how it was?' she asked, with a sudden fear\nlest Bessie should have learnt her pitiful weakness.\n\n'Why, no; how did it come?'\n\n'I don't know. We were talking. I can stand up now, Mrs. Byass, thank\nyou. I'll go up to my room. I've forgotten the time; is it late?'\n\nIt was only nine o'clock. Bessie would have gone upstairs with her, but\nJane insisted that she was quite herself. On the stairs she trod as\nlightly as possible, and she closed her door without a sound. Alone,\nshe again gave way to tears. Michael's face was angry in her memory; he\nhad never looked at her in that way before, and now he would never look\nwith the old kindness. What a change had been wrought in these few\nminutes!\n\nAnd Sidney never anything but her friend--cold, meaningless word! If he\nknew how she had fallen, would that be likely to bring him nearer to\nher? She had lost both things, that was all.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nTHE DEBT REPAID\n\nShe rose early, in the murky cola of the winter morning. When, at eight\no'clock, she knocked as usual at her grandfather's door his answer made\nher tremble.\n\n'I shall be down in a few minutes, Jane; I'll have breakfast with you.'\n\nIt was long since he had risen at this hour. His voice sounded less\nlike that of an old man, and, in spite of his calling her by her name,\nshe felt the tone to be severe. When he reached the parlour he did not\noffer to take her hand, and she feared to approach him. She saw that\nhis features bore the mark of sleeplessness. Hers, poor girl! were yet\nmore woeful in their pallor.\n\nThrough the meal he affected to occupy himself with the book Miss Lant\nhad sent--the sight of which was intolerable to Jane. And not for a\nfull hour did he speak anything but casual words. Jane had taken her\nsewing; unexpectedly he addressed her.\n\n'Let's have a word or two together, Jane. I think we ought to, oughtn't\nwe?'\n\nShe forced herself to regard him.\n\n'I think you meant what you said last night?'\n\n'Grandfather, I will do whatever you bid me. I'll do it faithfully. I\nwas ungrateful. I feel ashamed to have spoken so.'\n\n'That's nothing to do with it, Jane. You're not ungrateful; anything\nbut that. But I've had a night to think over your words. You couldn't\nspeak like that if you weren't driven to it by the strongest feeling\nyou ever knew or will know. I hadn't thought of it in that way; I\nhadn't thought of you in that way.'\n\nHe began gently, but in the last words was a touch of reproof, almost\nof scorn. He gazed at her from under his grey eyebrows, perhaps hoping\nto elicit some resistance of her spirit, some sign of strength that\nwould help him to reconstruct his shattered ideal.\n\n'Grandfather, I'll try with all my strength to be what you wish--I\nwill!'\n\n'And suppose the strength isn't sufficient, child?'\n\nEven in her humility she could not but feel that this was unjust. Had\nshe ever boasted? Had she ever done more than promise tremblingly what\nhe demanded? But the fear was legitimate. A weak thing, all but\nheart-broken, could she hope to tread firmly in any difficult path? She\nhung her head, making no answer.\n\nHe examined her, seeming to measure the slightness of her frame. Sad,\nunutterably sad, was the deep breath he drew as he turned his eyes away\nagain.\n\n'Do you feel well this morning, Jane?'\n\n'Yes, grandfather.'\n\n'Have you slept?'\n\n'I couldn't. You were grieving about me. I hoped never to have\ndisappointed you.'\n\nHe fell into reverie. Was he thinking of that poor wife of his, dead\nlong, long ago, the well-meaning girl of whom he had expected\nimpossible things? A second time had he thus erred, no longer with the\nexcuse of inexperience and hot blood. That cry of Jane's had made its\nway to his heart. An enthusiast, he was yet capable of seeing by the\ncommon light of day, when his affections were deeply stirred. And in\nthe night he had pondered much over his son's behaviour. Was he being\ndeceived in that quarter also, and there intentionally? Did Joseph know\nthis child better than he had done, and calculate upon her weakness?\nThe shock, instead of disabling him, had caused a revival of his\nstrength. He could walk more firmly this morning than at any time since\nhis accident. His brain was clear and active; he knew that it behoved\nhim to reconsider all he had been doing, and that quickly, ere it was\ntoo late. He must even forget that aching of the heart until he had\nleisure to indulge it.\n\n'You shan't disappoint me, my dear,' he said gravely. 'It's my own\nfault if I don't take your kindness as you mean it. I have to go out,\nJane, but I shall be back to dinner. Perhaps we'll talk again\nafterwards.'\n\nOf late, on the rare occasions of his leaving the house, he had always\ntold her where he was going, and for what purpose; Jane understood that\nthis confidence was at an end. When he was gone she found occupation\nfor a short time, but presently could only sit over the fire, nursing\nher many griefs. She was no longer deemed worthy of confidence; worse\nthan that, she had no more faith in herself. If Sidney learnt what had\nhappened he could not even retain his respect for her. In this way she\nthought of it, judging Kirkwood by the ideal standard, which\nfortunately is so unlike human nature; taking it for granted--so\noppressed was her mind by the habit of dwelling on artificial\nmotives--that he only liked her because he had believed her strong in\npurpose, forgetting altogether that his love had grown before he was\naware that anything unusual was required of her. She did remember,\nindeed, that it was only the depth of her love for him which had caused\nher disgrace; but, even if he came to understand that, it would not,\nshe feared, weigh in her favour against his judgment.\n\nIt was the natural result of the influences to which she had been\nsubjected. Her mind, overwrought by resolute contemplation of ideas\nbeyond its scope, her gentle nature bent beneath a burden of duty to\nwhich it was unequal, and taught to consider with painful solemnity\nthose impulses of kindness which would otherwise have been merely the\nsimple joys of life, she had come to distrust every instinct which did\nnot subserve the supreme purpose. Even of Sidney's conduct she could\nnot reason in a natural way. Instinct would have bidden her reproach\nhim, though ever so gently; was it well done to draw away when he must\nhave known how she looked for his aid? Her artificial self urged, on\nthe other hand, that he had not acted thus without some gravely\nconsidered motive. What it was she could not pretend to divine; her\nfaith in his nobleness overcame every perplexity. Of the persons\nconstituting this little group and playing their several parts, she\nalone had fallen altogether below what was expected of her. As humble\nnow as in the days of her serfdom, Jane was incapable of revolting\nagainst the tyranny of circumstances. Life had grown very hard for her\nagain, but she believed that this was to a great extent her own fault,\nthe outcome of her own unworthy weakness.\n\nAt Michael's return she did her best to betray no idle despondency.\nTheir midday meal was almost as silent as breakfast had been; his eyes\navoided her, and frequently he lost himself in thought. As he was\nrising from the table Jane observed an unsteadiness in his movement; he\nshook his head mechanically and leaned forward on both his hands, as if\nfeeling giddy. She approached him, but did not venture to speak.\n\n'I'll go upstairs,' he said, having sighed slightly.\n\n'May I come and read to you, grandfather?'\n\n'Not just now, Jane. Go out whilst it's a bit fine.'\n\nHe went from the room, still with an unsteady walk. Reaching his own\nroom, where there was a cheerful fire, he sat down, and remained for a\nlong time unoccupied, save with his reflections. This chamber had\nscarcely changed in a detail of its arrangement since he first came to\ninhabit it. There was the chair which Sidney always used, and that on\nwhich Jane had sat since she was the silent, frail child of thirteen.\nHere had his vision taken form, growing more definite with the growth\nof his granddaughter, seeming to become at length a splendid reality.\nWhat talk had been held here between Kirkwood and himself whilst Jane\nlistened! All gone into silence; gone, too, the hope it had encouraged.\n\nHe was weary after the morning's absence from home, and fell into a\nlight slumber. Dreams troubled him. First he found himself in\nAustralia; he heard again the sudden news of his son's death; the shock\nawoke him. Another dozing fit, and he was a young man with a wife and\nchildren to support; haunted with the fear of coming to want; harsh,\nunreasonable in his exactions at home. Something like a large black\ncoffin came into his dream, and in dread of it he again returned to\nconsciousness.\n\nAll night he had been thinking of the dark story of long ago--his\nwife's form motionless on the bed--the bottle which told him what had\nhappened. Why must that memory revive to trouble his last days? Part of\nhis zeal for the great project had come of a feeling that he might thus\nin some degree repair his former ill-doing; Jane would be a providence\nto many hapless women whose burden was as heavy as his own wife's had\nbeen. Must he abandon that solace? In any case he could bestow his\nmoney for charitable purposes, but it would not be the same, it would\nnot effect what he had aimed at.\n\nLate in the afternoon he drew from the inner pocket of his coat a long\nenvelope and took thence a folded paper. It was covered with clerkly\nwriting, which he perused several times. At length he tore the paper\nslowly across the middle, again tore the fragments, and threw them on\nto the fire. . . .\n\nJane obeyed her grandfather's word and went out for an hour. She wished\nfor news of Pennyloaf, who had been ill, and was now very near the time\nof her confinement. At the door of the house in Merlin Place she was\nsurprised to encounter Bob Hewett, who stood in a lounging attitude; he\nhad never appeared to her so disreputable--not that his clothes were\nworse than usual, but his face and hands were dirty, and the former was\nset in a hang-dog look.\n\n'Is your wife upstairs, Mr. Hewett?' Jane asked, when he had nodded\nsullenly in reply to her greeting.\n\n'Yes; and somebody else too as could have been dispensed with. There's\nanother mouth to feed.'\n\n'No, there ain't,' cried a woman's voice just behind him.\n\nJane recognised the speaker, a Mrs. Griffin, who lived in the house and\nwas neighbourly to Pennyloaf.\n\n'There ain't?' inquired Bob, gruffly.\n\n'The child's dead.'\n\n'Thank goodness for that, any way!'\n\nMrs. Griffin explained to Jane that the birth had taken place twelve\nhours ago. Pennyloaf was 'very low,' but not in a state to cause\nanxiety; perhaps it would be better for Jane to wait until to-morrow\nbefore seeing her.\n\n'She didn't say \"thank goodness,\" added the woman, with a scornful\nglance at Bob, 'but I don't think she's over sorry as it's gone, an'\nsmall blame to her. There's some people as doesn't care much what sort\no' times she has--not meanin' _you_, Miss, but them as had _ought_ to\ncare.'\n\nBob looked more disreputable than ever. His eyes were fixed on Jane,\nand with such a singular expression that the latter, meeting their\ngaze, felt startled, she did not know why. At the same moment he\nstepped down from the threshold and walked away without speaking.\n\n'I shouldn't care to have _him_ for a 'usband,' pursued Mrs. Griffin.\n'Of course he must go an' lose his work, just when his wife's wantin' a\nfew little extries, as you may say.'\n\n'Lost his work?'\n\n'Day 'fore yes'day. I don't like him, an' I don't like his ways; he'll\nbe gettin' into trouble before long, you mind what I say. His family's\na queer lot, 'cordin' to what they tell. Do you know them, Miss?'\n\n'I used to, a long time ago.'\n\n'You knew his sister--her as is come 'ome?'\n\n'His sister?'\n\n'Her as was a actress. Mrs. Bannister was tellin' me only last night;\nshe had it from Mrs. Horrocks, as heard from a friend of hers as lives\nin the Farrin'don Buildin's, where the Hewetts lives too. They tell me\nit was in the Sunday paper, though I don't remember nothing about it at\nthe time. It seems as how a woman threw vitrol over her an' burnt her\nface so as there's no knowin' her, an' she goes about with a veil, an'\n'cause she can't get her own livin' no more, of course she's come back\n'ome, for all she ran away an' disgraced herself shameful.'\n\nJane gazed fixedly at the speaker, scarcely able to gather the sense of\nwhat was said.\n\n'Miss Hewett, you mean? Mr. Hewett's eldest daughter?'\n\n'So I understand.'\n\n'She has come home? When?'\n\n'I can't just say; but a few weeks ago, I believe. They say it's nearly\ntwo months since it was in the paper.'\n\n'Does Mrs. Hewett know about it?'\n\n'I can't say. She's never spoke to me as if she did. And, as I tell\nyou, I only heard yes'day myself. If you're a friend of theirs, p'r'aps\nI hadn't oughtn't to a' mentioned it. It just come to my lips in the\nway o' tallin'. Of course I don't know nothin' about the young woman\nmyself; it's only what you comes to 'ear in the way o' talkin', you\nknow.'\n\nThis apology was doubtless produced by the listener's troubled\ncountenance. Jane asked no further question, but said she would come to\nsee Pennyloaf on the morrow, and so took her leave.\n\nAt ten o'clock next morning, just when Jane was preparing for her visit\nto Merlin Place, so possessed with anxiety to ascertain if Pennyloaf\nknew anything about Clara Hewett that all her troubles were for the\nmoment in the back ground, Bessie Byass came running upstairs with a\nstrange announcement. Sidney Kirkwood had called, and wished to see\nMiss Snowdon in private for a few minutes.\n\n'Something must have happened,' said Jane, her heart standing still.\n\nBessie had a significant smile, but suppressed it when she noticed the\nagitation into which her friend was fallen.\n\n'Shall I ask him up into the front room?'\n\nMichael was in his own chamber, which he had not left this morning. On\ngoing to the parlour Jane found her visitor standing in expectancy.\nYes, something had happened; it needed but to look at him to be\nconvinced of that. And before a word was spoken Jane knew that his\ncoming had reference to Clara Hewett, knew it with the strangest\ncertainty.\n\n'I didn't go to work this morning,' Sidney began, 'because I was very\nanxious to see you--alone. I have something to speak about--to tell\nyou.'\n\n'Let us sit down.'\n\nSidney waited till he met her look; she regarded him without\nself-consciousness, without any effort to conceal her agitated interest.\n\n'You see young Hewett and his wife sometimes. Have you heard from\neither of them that Clara Hewett is living with her father again?'\n\n'Not from them. A person in their house spoke about it yesterday. It\nwas the first I had heard.'\n\n'Spoke of Miss Hewett? In a gossiping way, do you mean?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Then you know what has happened to her?'\n\n'If the woman told the truth.'\n\nThere was silence.\n\n'Miss Snowdon--'\n\n'Oh, I don't like you to speak so. You used to call me Jane.'\n\nHe looked at her in distress. She had spoken impulsively, but not with\nthe kind of emotion the words seem to imply. It was for his sake, not\nfor hers, that she broke that formal speech.\n\n'You called me so when I was a child, Mr. Kirkwood,' she continued,\nsmiling for all she was so pale. 'It sounds as if something had\naltered. You're my oldest friend, and won't you always be so? Whatever\nyou're going to tell me, surely it doesn't prevent us from being\nfriends, just the same as always?'\n\nHe had not seen her in her weakness, the night before last. As little\nas he could imagine that, was he able to estimate the strength with\nwhich she now redeemed her womanly dignity. His face told her what he\nhad to disclose. No question now of proving herself superior to common\nfeelings; it was Sidney who made appeal to her, and her heart went\nforth to grant him all he desired.\n\n'Jane--dear, good Jane--you remember what I said to you in the garden\nat Danbury--that I had forgotten her. I thought it was true. But you\nknow what a terrible thing has befallen her. I should be less than a\nman if I could say that she is nothing to me.'\n\n'Have you spoken to her?'\n\n'I have asked her to be my wife. Jane, if I had come to you yesterday,\nbefore going to her, and had told you what I meant to do, and explained\nall I felt, how the love of years ago had grown in me again, wouldn't\nyou have given me a friendly hand?'\n\n'Just like I do now. Do you think I have forgotten one night when she\nstood by me and saved me from cruel treatment, and then nursed me when\nI fell ill?'\n\nNeither of them had the habit of making long speeches. They understood\neach other--very nearly; sufficiently, at all events, to make the bond\nof sympathy between them stronger than ever. Jane was misled a little,\nfor she thought that here was the explanation of Sidney's withdrawing\nhis word to her grandfather; doubtless he heard of the calamity when it\nhappened. But on a more essential point she fell into no misconception.\nDid Sidney desire that she should?\n\nHe held her hand until she gently drew it away.\n\n'You will go up and tell grandfather,' she said, gravely; then added,\nbefore he could speak, 'But I'll just see him first for a minute. He\nhasn't been out of his room this morning yet. Please wait here.'\n\nShe left him, and Sidney fell back on his chair, woebegone, distracted.\n\nMichael, brooding sorrowfully, at first paid no heed to Jane when she\nentered his room. It was not long since he had risen, and his simple\nbreakfast, scarcely touched, was still on the table.\n\n'Grandfather, Mr. Kirkwood is here, and wishes to speak to you.'\n\nHe collected himself, and, regarding her, became aware that she was\nstrongly moved.\n\n'Wishes to see me, Jane? Then I suppose he came to see you first?'\n\nPrepared now for anything unexpected, feeling that the links between\nhimself and these young people were artificial, and that he could but\nwatch, as if from a distance, the course of their lives, his first\nsupposition was, that Sidney had again altered his mind. He spoke\ncoldly, and had little inclination for the interview.\n\n'Yes,' Jane replied, 'he came to see me, but only to tell me that he is\ngoing to be married.'\n\nHis wrinkled face slowly gathered an expression of surprise.\n\n'He will tell you who it is; he will explain. But I wanted to speak to\nyou first. Grandfather, I was afraid you might say something about me.\nWill you--will you forget my foolishness? Will you think of me as you\ndid before? When he has spoken to you, you will understand why I am\ncontent to put everything out of my mind, everything you and I talked\nof. But I couldn't bear for him to know how I have disappointed you.\nWill you let me be all I was to you before? Will you trust me again,\ngrandfather? You haven't spoken to him yet about me, have you?'\n\nMichael shook his head.\n\n'Then you will let it be as if nothing had happened? Grandfather--'\n\nShe bent beside him and took his hand. Michael looked at her with a\nlight once more in his eyes.\n\n'Tell him to come. He shall hear nothing from me, Jane.'\n\n'And you will try to forget it?'\n\n'I wish nothing better. Tell him to come here, my child. When he's gone\nwe'll talk together again.'\n\nThe interview did not last long, and Sidney left the house without\nseeing Jane a second time.\n\nShe would have promised anything now. Seeing that life had but one path\nof happiness for her, the path hopelessly closed, what did it matter by\nwhich of the innumerable other ways she accomplished her sad journey?\nFor an instant, whilst Sidney was still speaking, she caught a gleam of\nhope in renunciation itself, the kind of strength which idealism is\nfond of attributing to noble natures. A gleam only, and deceptive; she\nknew it too well after the day spent by her grandfather's side,\nencouraging, at the expense of her heart's blood, all his revived faith\nin her. But she would not again give way. The old man should reap fruit\nof her gratitude and Sidney should never suspect how nearly she had\nproved herself unworthy of his high opinion.\n\nShe had dreamed her dream, and on awaking must be content to take up\nthe day's duties. Just in the same way, when she was a child at Mrs.\nPeckover's, did not sleep often bring a vision of happiness, of freedom\nfrom bitter tasks, and had she not to wake in the miserable mornings,\ntrembling lest she had lain too long? Her condition was greatly better\nthan then, so much better that it seemed wicked folly to lament because\none joy was not granted her.--Why, in the meantime she had forgotten\nall about Pennyloaf. That visit must be paid the first thing this\nmorning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nTHE TREASURY UNLOCKED\n\nA Sunday morning. In their parlour in Burton Crescent, Mr. and Mrs.\nJoseph Snowdon were breakfasting. The sound of church bells--most\ndepressing of all sounds that mingle in the voice of London--intimated\nthat it was nearly eleven o'clock, but neither of our friends had in\nview the attendance of public worship. Blended odours of bacon and\nkippered herrings filled the room--indeed, the house, for several\nbreakfasts were in progress under the same roof. For a wonder, the\nmorning was fine, even sunny; a yellow patch glimmered on the worn\ncarpet, and the grime of the window-panes was visible against an\nunfamiliar sky. Joseph, incompletely dressed, had a Sunday paper\npropped before him, and read whilst he ate. Clem, also in anything but\n_grande toilette_ was using a knife for the purpose of conveying to her\nmouth the juice which had exuded from crisp rashers. As usual, they had\nvery little to say to each other. Clem looked at her husband now and\nthen, from under her eyebrows, surreptitiously.\n\nAfter one of these glances she said, in a tone which was not exactly\nhostile, but had a note of suspicion:\n\n'I'd give something to know why he's going to marry Clara Hewett.'\n\n'Not the first time you've made that remark,' returned Joseph, without\nlooking up from his paper.\n\n'I suppose I can speak?'\n\n'Oh, yes. But I'd try to do so in a more lady-like way.'\n\nClem flashed at him a gleam of hatred. He had become fond lately of\ndrawing attention to her defects of breeding. Clem certainly did not\nkeep up with his own progress in the matter of external refinement; his\ncomments had given her a sense of inferiority, which irritated her\nsolely as meaning that she was not his equal in craft. She let a minute\nor two pass, then returned to the subject.\n\n'There's something at the bottom of it; I know that. Of course you know\nmore about it than you pretend.'\n\nJoseph leaned back in his chair and regarded her with a smile of the\nloftiest scorn.\n\n'It never occurs to you to explain it in the simplest way, of course.\nIf ever you hear of a marriage, the first thing you ask yourself is:\nWhat has he or she to gain by it? Natural enough--in you. Now do you\nreally suppose that all marriages come about in the way that _yours_\ndid--on your side, I mean?'\n\nClem was far too dull-witted to be capable of quick retort. She merely\nreplied:\n\n'I don't know what you're talking about.'\n\n'Of course not. But let me assure you that people sometimes think of\nother things besides making profit when they get married. It's a pity\nthat you always show yourself so coarse-minded.'\n\nJoseph was quite serious in administering this rebuke. He really felt\nhimself justified in holding the tone of moral superiority. The same\nphenomenon has often been remarked in persons conscious that their\naffairs are prospering, and whose temptations to paltry meanness are on\nthat account less frequent.\n\n'And what about yourself?' asked his wife, having found her retort at\nlength. 'Why did you want to marry _me_, I'd like to know?'\n\n'Why? You are getting too modest. How could I live in the same house\nwith such a good-looking and sweet-tempered and well-behaved--'\n\n'Oh, shut up!' she exclaimed, in a voice such as one hears at the\nstreet-corner. 'It was just because you thought we was goin' to be\nfools enough to keep you in idleness. Who was the fool, after all?'\n\nJoseph smiled, and returned to his newspaper. In satisfaction at having\nreduced him to silence, Clem laughed aloud and clattered with the knife\non her plate. As she was doing so there came a knock at the door.\n\n'A gentleman wants to know if you're in, sir,' said the house-thrall,\nshowing a smeary face. 'Mr. Byass is the name.'\n\n'Mr. Byass? I'll go down and see him.'\n\nClem's face became alive with suspicion. In spite of her careless\nattire she intercepted Joseph, and bade the servant ask Mr. Byass to\ncome upstairs. 'How can you go down without a collar?' she said to her\nhusband.\n\nHe understood, and was somewhat uneasy, but made no resistance. Mr.\nByass presented himself. He had a very long face, and obviously brought\nnews of grave import. Joseph shook hands with him.\n\n'You don't know my wife, I think. Mr. Byass, Clem. Nothing wrong, I\nhope?'\n\nSamuel, having made his best City bow, swung back from his toes to his\nheels, and stood looking down into his hat. 'I'm sorry to say,' he\nbegan, with extreme gravity, 'that Mr. Snowdon is rather ill--in fact,\nvery ill. Miss Jane asked me to come as sharp as I could.'\n\n'Ill? In what way?'\n\n'I'm afraid it's a stroke, or something in that line. He fell down\nwithout a word of warning, just before ten o'clock. He's lying\ninsensible.'\n\n'I'll come at once,' said Joseph. 'They've got a doctor, I hope?'\n\n'Yes; the doctor had been summoned instantly.'\n\n'I'll go with you,' said Clem, in a tone of decision.\n\n'No, no; what's the good? You'll only be in the way.'\n\n'No, I shan't. If he's as bad as all that, I shall come.'\n\nBoth withdrew to prepare themselves. Mr. Byass, who was very nervous\nand perspiring freely, began to walk round and round the table,\ninspecting closely, in complete absence of mind, the objects that lay\non it.\n\n'We'll have a cab,' cried Joseph, as he came forth equipped. 'Poor\nJane's in a sad state, I'm afraid, oh?'\n\nIn a few minutes they were driving up Pentonville Road. Clem scarcely\never removed her eye from Joseph's face; the latter held his lips close\ntogether and kept his brows wrinkled. Few words passed during the drive.\n\nAt the door of the house appeared Bessie, much agitated. All turned\ninto the parlour on the ground floor and spoke together for a few\nminutes. Michael had been laid on his bed; at present Jane only was\nwith him, but the doctor would return shortly.\n\n'Will you tell her I'm here?' said Joseph to Mrs. Byass. 'I'll see her\nin the sitting-room.'\n\nHe went up and waited. Throughout the house prevailed that unnatural,\nnerve-distressing quietude which tells the presence of calamity. The\nchurch bells had ceased ringing, and Sunday's silence in the street\nenhanced the effect of blankness and alarming expectancy. Joseph could\nnot keep still; he strained his ears in attention to any slight sound\nthat might come from the floor above, and his heart beat painfully when\nat length the door opened.\n\nJane fixed her eyes on him and came silently forward.\n\n'Does he show any signs of coming round?' her father inquired.\n\n'No. He hasn't once moved.'\n\nShe spoke only just above a whisper. The shock kept her still trembling\nand her face bloodless.\n\n'Tell me how it happened, Jane.'\n\n'He'd just got up. I'd taken him his breakfast, and we were talking.\nAll at once he began to turn round, and then he fell down--before I\ncould reach him.'\n\n'I'll go upstairs, shall I?'\n\nJane could not overcome her fear; at the door of the bedroom she drew\nback, involuntarily, that her father might enter before her. When she\nforced herself to follow, the first glimpse of the motionless form\nshook her from head to foot. The thought of death was dreadful to her,\nand death seemed to lurk invisibly in this quiet room. The pale\nsunlight affected her as a mockery of hope.\n\n'You won't go away again, father?' she whispered.\n\nHe shook his head.\n\nIn the meantime Bessie and Clem were conversing. On the single previous\noccasion of Clem's visit to the house they had not met. They examined\neach other's looks with curiosity. Clem wished it were possible to get\nat the secrets of which Mrs. Byass was doubtless in possession; Bessie\non her side was reserved, circumspect.\n\n'Will he get over it?' the former inquired, with native brutality.\n\n'I'm sure I don't know; I hope he may.'\n\nThe medical man arrived, and when he came downstairs again Joseph\naccompanied him. Clem, when she found that nothing definite could be\nlearned, and that her husband had no intention of leaving, expressed\nher wish to walk round to Clerkenwell Close and see her mother. Joseph\napproved.\n\n'You'd better have dinner there,' he said to her privately. 'We can't\nboth of us come down on the Byasses.'\n\nShe nodded, and with a parting glance of hostile suspicion set forth.\nWhen she had crossed City Road, Clem's foot was on her native soil; she\nbore herself with conscious importance, hoping to meet some\nacquaintance who would be impressed by her attire and demeanour.\nNothing of the kind happened, however. It was the dead hour of Sunday\nmorning, midway in service-time, and long before the opening of\npublic-houses. In the neighbourhood of those places of refreshment were\noccasionally found small groups of men and boys, standing with their\nhands in their pockets, dispirited, seldom caring even to smoke; they\nkicked their heels against the kerbstone and sighed for one o'clock.\nClem went by them with a haughty balance of her head.\n\nAs she entered by the open front door and began to descend the kitchen\nsteps, familiar sounds were audible. Mrs. Peckover's voice was raised\nin dispute with some one; it proved to be a quarrel with a female\nlodger respecting the sum of threepence-farthing, alleged by the\nlandlady to be owing on some account or other. The two women had\nalready reached the point of calling each other liar and thief. Clem,\nhaving no acquaintance with the lodger, walked into the kitchen with an\nair of contemptuous indifference. The quarrel continued for another ten\nminutes--if the head of either had been suddenly cut off it would\nassuredly have gone on railing for an appreciable time--and Clem\nwaited, sitting before the fire. At last the lodger had departed, and\nthe last note of her virulence died away.\n\n'And what do _you_ want?' asked Mrs. Peckover, turning sharply upon her\ndaughter.\n\n'I suppose I can come to see you, can't I?'\n\n'Come to see me! Likely! When did you come last? You're a ungrateful\nbeast, that's what you are!'\n\n'All right. Go a'ead! Anything else you'd like to call me?'\n\nMrs. Peckover was hurt by the completeness with which Clem had\nestablished her independence. To do the woman justice, she had been\nactuated, in her design of capturing Joseph Snowdon, at least as much\nby a wish to establish her daughter satisfactorily as by the\never-wakeful instinct which bade her seize whenever gain lay near her\nclutches. Clem was proving disloyal, had grown secretive. Mrs. Peckover\ndid not look for any direct profit worth speaking of from the marriage\nshe had brought about, but she did desire the joy of continuing to plot\nagainst Joseph with his wife. Moreover, she knew that Clem was a\nbungler, altogether lacking in astuteness, and her soul was pained by\nthe thought of chances being missed. Her encounter with the lodger had\nwrought her up to the point at which she could discuss matters with\nClem frankly. The two abused each other for a while, but Clem really\ndesired to communicate her news, so that calmer dialogue presently\nensued.\n\n'Old Snowdon's had a stroke, if you'd like to know, and it's my belief\nhe won't get over it.'\n\n'Your belief! And what's your belief worth? Had a stroke, has he? Who\ntold you?'\n\n'I've just come from the 'ouse. Jo's stoppin' there.'\n\nThey discussed the situation in all its aspects, but Mrs. Peckover gave\nit clearly to be understood that, from her point of view, 'the game was\nspoilt.' As long as Joseph continued living under her roof she could in\na measure direct the course of events; Clem had chosen to abet him in\nhis desire for removal, and if ill came of it she had only herself to\nblame.\n\n'I can look out for myself,' said Clem.\n\n'Can you? I'm glad to hear it.'\n\nAnd Mrs. Peckover sniffed the air, scornfully. The affectionate pair\ndined together, each imbibing a pint and a half of 'mild and bitter,'\nand Clem returned to Hanover Street. From Joseph she could derive no\ninformation as to the state of the patient.\n\n'If you will stay here, where you can do no good,' he said, 'sit down\nand keep quiet.'\n\n'Certainly I shall stay,' said his wife, 'because I know you want to\nget rid of me.'\n\nJoseph left her in the sitting-room, and went upstairs again to keep\nhis daughter company. Jane would not leave the bedside. To enter the\nroom, after an interval elsewhere, wrung her feelings too painfully;\nbetter to keep her eyes fixed on the unmoving form, to overcome the\ndread by facing it.\n\nShe and her father seldom exchanged a word. The latter was experiencing\nhuman emotion, but at the same time he had no little anxiety regarding\nhis material interests. It was ten days since he had learnt that there\nwas no longer the least fear of a marriage between Jane and Sidney,\nseeing that Kirkwood was going to marry some one else--a piece of news\nwhich greatly astonished him, and confirmed him in his judgment that he\nhad been on the wrong tack in judging Kirkwood's character. At the same\ntime he had been privily informed by Scawthorne of an event which had\never since kept him very uneasy--Michael's withdrawal of his will from\nthe hands of the solicitors. With what purpose this had been done\nScawthorne could not conjecture; Mr. Percival had made no comment in\nhis hearing. In all likelihood the will was now in this very room.\nJoseph surveyed every object again and again. He wondered whether Jane\nknew anything of the matter, but not all his cynicism could persuade\nhim that at the present time her thoughts were taking the same\ndirection as his own.\n\nThe day waned. Its sombre close was unspeakably mournful in this\nhaunted chamber. Jane could not bear it; she hid her face and wept.\n\nWhen the doctor came again, at six o'clock, he whispered to Joseph that\nthe end was nearer than he had anticipated. Near, indeed; less than ten\nminutes after the warning had been given Michael ceased to breathe.\n\nJane knelt by the bed, convulsed with grief, unable to hear the words\nher father addressed to her. He sat for five minutes, then again spoke.\nShe rose and replied.\n\n'Will you come with us, Jane, or would rather stay with Mrs. Byass?'\n\n'I will stay, please, father.'\n\nHe hesitated, but the thought that rose was even for him too ignoble to\nbe entertained.\n\n'As you please, my dear. Of course no one must enter your rooms but\nMrs. Byass. I must go now, but I shall look in again to-night.'\n\n'Yes, father.'\n\nShe spoke mechanically. He had to lead her from the room, and, on\nquitting the house, left her all but unconscious in Bessie's arms.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\nTHE HEIR\n\n'And you mean to say,' cried Clem, when she was in the cab with her\nhusband speeding back to Burton Crescent--'you mean to say as you've\nleft them people to do what they like?'\n\n'I suppose I know my own business,' re plied Joseph, wishing to convey\nthe very impression which in fact he did--that he had the will in his\npocket.\n\nOn reaching home he sat down at once and penned a letter to Messrs.\nPercival & Peel, formally apprising them of what had happened. Clem sat\nby and watched him. Having sealed the envelope, he remarked:\n\n'I'm going out for a couple of hours.'\n\n'Then I shall go with you.'\n\n'You'll do nothing of the kind. Why, what do you mean, you great gaping\nfool?' The agitation of his nerves made him break into unaccustomed\nviolence. 'Do you suppose you're going to follow me everywhere for the\nnext week? Are you afraid I shall run away? If I mean to do so, do you\nthink you can stop me? You'll just wait here till I come back, which\nwill be before ten o'clock. Do you hear?'\n\nShe looked at him fiercely, but his energy was too much for her, and\nperforce she let him go. As soon as he had left the house, she too sat\ndown and indited a letter. It ran thus:\n\n'DEAR MOTHER,--The old feller has gawn off, it apened at jest after six\ne'clock if you want to now I shall come and sea you at ten 'clock\nto-morow moning, and I beleve hes got the will but hes a beest and\ntheers a game up, you may take your hothe so I remain C. S.'\n\nThis document she took to the nearest pillar-post, then returned and\nsat brooding.\n\nBy the first hansom available Joseph was driven right across London to\na certain dull street in Chelsea. Before dismissing the vehicle he\nknocked at the door of a lodging-house and made inquiry for Mr.\nScawthorne. To his surprise and satisfaction, Mr. Scawthorne happened\nto be at home; so the cabman was paid, and Joseph went up to the second\nfloor.\n\nIn his shabby little room Scawthorne sat smoking and reading. It was a\nseason of impecuniosity with him, and his mood was anything but\ncheerful. He did not rise when his visitor entered.\n\n'Well now, what do you think brings me here?' exclaimed Joseph, when he\nhad carefully closed the door.\n\n'Hanged if I know, but it doesn't seem to be particularly bad news.'\n\nIndeed, Joseph had overcome his sensibilities by this time, and his\naspect was one of joyous excitement. Seeing on the table a bottle of\nsherry, loosely corked, he pointed to it.\n\n'If you don't mind, Scaw. I'm a bit upset, a bit flurried. Got another\nwine-glass?'\n\nFrom the cupboard Scawthorne produced one and bade the visitor help\nhimself. His face began to express curiosity. Joseph tilted the draught\ndown his throat and showed satisfaction.\n\n'That does me good. I've had a troublesome day. It ain't often my\nfeelings are tried.'\n\n'Well, what is it?'\n\n'My boy, we are all mortal. I dare say you've heard that observation\nbefore; can you apply it to any particular case?'\n\nScawthorne was startled; he delayed a moment before speaking.\n\n'You don't mean to say--'\n\n'Exactly. Died a couple of hours ago, after lying insensible all day,\npoor old man! I've just written your people a formal announcement. Now,\nwhat do you think of that? If you don't mind, old fellow.'\n\nHe filled himself another glass, and tilted it off as before.\nScawthorne had dropped his eyes to the ground, and stood in meditation.\n\n'Now what about the will?' pursued Joseph.\n\n'You haven't looked for it?' questioned his friend with an odd look.\n\n'Thought it more decent to wait a few hours. The girl was about, you\nsee, and what's more, my wife was. But have you heard anything since I\nsaw you?'\n\n'Why, yes. A trifle.'\n\n'Out with it! What are you grinning about? Don't keep me on hot coals.'\n\n'Well, it's amusing, and that's the fact. Take another glass of sherry;\nyou'll need support.'\n\n'Oh, I'm prepared for the worst. He's cut me out altogether, eh? That\ncomes of me meddling with the girl's affairs--damnation! When there\nwasn't the least need, either.'\n\n'A bad job. The fact is, Percival had a letter from him at midday\nyesterday. The senior had left the office; young Percival opened the\nletter, and spoke to me about it. Now, prepare yourself. The letter\nsaid that he had destroyed his former will, and would come to the\noffice on Monday--that's _to-marrow_--to give instructions for a new\none.'\n\nJoseph stood and stared.\n\n'To-morrow? Why, then, there's _no will at all_?'\n\n'An admirable deduction. I congratulate you on your logic.'\n\nSnowdon flung up his arms wildly, then began to leap about the room.\n\n'Try another glass,' said Scawthorne. 'There's still a bottle in the\ncupboard; don't be afraid.'\n\n'And you mean to tell me it's all mine?'\n\n'The wine? You're very welcome.'\n\n'Wine be damned! The money, my boy, the money! Scawthorne, I'm not a\nmean chap. As sure as you and me stand here, you shall have--you shall\nhave a hundred pounds! I mean it; dash me, I mean it! You've been\ndevilish useful to me; and what's more I haven't done with you yet. Do\nyou twig, old boy?'\n\n'You mean that a confidential agent in England, unsuspected, may be\nneeded?'\n\n'Shouldn't wonder if I do.'\n\n'Can't be managed under double the money, my good sir,' observed\nScawthorne, with unmistakable seriousness. 'Worth your while, I promise\nyou. Have another glass. Fair commission. Think it over.'\n\n'Look here! I shall have to make the girl an allowance.'\n\n'There's the filter-works. Don't be stingy.'\n\nJoseph was growing very red in the face. He drank glass after glass; he\nflung his arms about; he capered.\n\n'Damn me if you shall call me that, Scaw! Two hundred it shall be. But\nwhat was the old cove up to? Why did he destroy the other will? What\nwould the new one have been?'\n\n'Can't answer either question, but it's probably as well for you that\n_to-morrow_ never comes.'\n\n'Now just see how things turn out!' went on the other, in the joy of\nhis heart. 'All the thought and the trouble that I've gone through this\nlast year, when I might have taken it easy and waited for chance to\nmake me rich! Look at Kirkwood's business. There was you and me\nknocking our heads together and raising lumps on them, as you may say,\nto find out a plan of keeping him and Jane apart, when all the while\nwe'd nothing to do but to look on and wait, if only we'd known. Now\nthis is what I call the working of Providence, Scawthorne. Who's going\nto say after this, that things ain't as they should be? Everything's\nfor the best, my boy; I see that clearly enough.'\n\n'Decidedly,' assented Scawthorne, with a smile. 'The honest man is\nalways rewarded in the long run. And that reminds me; I too have had a\nstroke of luck.'\n\nHe went on to relate that his position in the office of Percival & Peel\nwas now nominally that of an articled clerk, and that in three years'\ntime, if all went well, he would be received in the firm as junior\npartner.\n\n'There's only one little project I am sorry to give up, in connection\nwith your affairs, Snowdon. If it had happened that your daughter had\ninherited the money, why shouldn't I have had the honour of becoming\nyour son-in-law?'\n\nJoseph stared, then burst into hearty laughter.\n\n'I tell you what,' he said, recovering himself, 'why should you give up\nthat idea? She's as good a girl as you'll ever come across, I can tell\nyou that, my boy. There's better-looking, but you won't find many as\nmodest and good-hearted. Just make her acquaintance, and tell me if\nI've deceived you. And look here, Scawthorne; by George, I'll make a\nbargain with you! You say you'll be a partner in three years. Marry Jane\nwhen that day comes, and I'll give you a thousand for a wedding\npresent. I mean it! What's more, I'll make my will on your marriage-day\nand leave everything I've got to you and her. There now!'\n\n'What makes you so benevolent all at once?' inquired Scawthorne,\nblandly.\n\n'Do you think I've got no fatherly feeling, man? Why, if it wasn't for\nmy wife I'd ask nothing better than to settle down with Jane to keep\nhouse for me. She's a good girl, I tell you, and I wish her happiness.'\n\n'And do you think I'm exactly the man to make her a model husband?'\n\n'I don't see why not--now you're going to be a partner in a good\nbusiness. Don't you think I'm ten times as honest a man to-day as I was\nyesterday? Poor devils can't afford to be what they'd wish, in the way\nof honesty and decent living.'\n\nTrue enough for once,' remarked the other, without irony.\n\n'You think it over, Scaw. I'm a man of my word. You shall have your\nmoney as soon as things are straight; and if you can bring about that\naffair, I'll do all I said--so there's my hand on it. Say the word, and\nI'll make you acquainted with her before--before I take that little\ntrip you know of, just for my health.'\n\n'We'll speak of it again.'\n\nThereupon they parted. In the course of the following day Scawthorne's\nreport received official confirmation. Joseph pondered deeply with\nhimself whether he should tell his wife the truth or not; there were\narguments for both courses. By Tuesday morning he had decided for the\ntruth; that would give more piquancy to a pleasant little jest he had\nin mind. At breakfast he informed her, as if casually, and it amused\nhim to see that she did not believe him.\n\n'You'll be anxious to tell your mother. Go and spend the day with her,\nbut be back by five o'clock; then we'll talk things over. I have\nbusiness with the lawyers again.'\n\nClem repaired to the Close. Late in the afternoon she and her husband\nagain met at home, and by this time Joseph's elation had convinced her\nthat he was telling the truth. Never had he been in such a suave\nhumour; he seemed to wish to make up for his late severities. Seating\nhimself near her, he began pleasantly:\n\n'Well, things might have been worse, eh?'\n\n'I s'pose they might.'\n\n'I haven't spoken to Jane yet. Time enough after the funeral. What\nshall we do for the poor girl, eh?'\n\n'How do I know?'\n\n'You won't grudge her a couple of pounds a week, or so, just to enable\nher to live with the Byasses, as she has been doing?'\n\n'I s'pose the money's your own to do what you like with.'\n\n'Very kind of you to say so, my dear. But we're well-to-do people now,\nand we must be polite to each other. Where shall we take a house, Clem?\nWould you like to be a bit out of town? There's very nice places within\neasy reach of King's Cross, you know, on the Great Northern. A man I\nknow lives at Potter's Bar, and finds it very pleasant; good air. Of\ncourse I must be within easy reach of business.'\n\nShe kept drawing her nails over a fold in her dress, making a scratchy\nsound.\n\n'It happened just at the right time,' he continued. 'The business wants\na little more capital put into it. I tell you what it is, Clem; in a\nyear or two we shall be coining money, old girl.'\n\n'Shall you?'\n\n'Right enough. There's just one thing I'm a little anxious about; you\nwon't mind me mentioning it? Do you think your mother'll expect us to\ndo anything for her?'\n\nClem regarded him with cautious scrutiny. He was acting well, and her\nprofound distrust began to be mingled with irritating uncertainty.\n\n'What can she expect? If she does, she'll have to be disappointed,\nthat's all.'\n\n'I don't want to seem mean, you know. But then she isn't so badly\nherself, is she?'\n\n'I know nothing about it. You'd better ask her.'\n\nAnd Clem grinned. Thereupon Joseph struck a facetious note, and for\nhalf an hour made himself very agreeable. Now for the first time, he\nsaid, could he feel really settled; life was smooth before him. They\nwould have a comfortable home, the kind of place to which he could\ninvite his friends; one or two excellent fellows he knew would bring\ntheir wives, and so Clem would have more society.\n\n'Suppose you learn the piano, old girl? It wouldn't be amiss.\nBy-the-by, I hope they'll turn you out some creditable mourning. You'll\nhave to find a West End dressmaker.'\n\nShe listened, and from time to time smiled ambiguously. . . .\n\nAt noon of the next day Clem was walking on that part of the Thames\nEmbankment which is between Waterloo Bridge and the Temple Pier. It was\na mild morning, misty, but illuminated now and then with rays of\nsunlight, which gleamed dully upon the river and gave a yellowness to\nremote objects. At the distance of a dozen paces walked Bob Hewett; the\ntwo had had a difference in their conversation, and for some minutes\nkept thus apart, looking sullenly at the ground. Clem turned aside, and\nleaned her arms on the parapet. Presently her companion drew near and\nleaned in the same manner.\n\n'What is it you want me to do?' he asked huskily. 'Just speak plain,\ncan't you?'\n\n'If you can't understand--if you _won't_, that is--it's no good\nspeakin' plainer.'\n\n'You said the other night as you didn't care about his money. If you\nthink he means hookin' it, let him go, and good riddance.'\n\n'That's a fool's way of talkin'. I'm not goin' to lose it all, if I can\nhelp it. There's a way of stoppin' him, and of gettin' the money too.'\n\nThey both stared down at the water; it was full tide, and the muddy\nsurface looked almost solid.\n\n'You wouldn't get it all,' were Bob's next words. 'I've been asking\nabout that.'\n\n'You have? Who did you ask?'\n\n'Oh, a feller you don't know. You'd only have a third part of it, and\nthe girl 'ud get the rest.'\n\n'What do you call a third part?'\n\nSo complete was her stupidity, that Bob had to make a laborious\nexplanation of this mathematical term. She could have understood what\nwas meant by a half or a quarter, but the unfamiliar 'third' conveyed\nno distinct meaning.\n\n'I don't care,' she said at length. 'That 'ud be enough.'\n\n'Clem--you'd better leave this job alone. You'd better, I warn you.'\n\n'I shan't,'\n\nAnother long silence. A steamboat drew up to the Temple Pier, and a\nyellow shaft of sunlight fell softly upon its track in the water.\n\n'What do you want me to do?' Bob recommenced. '_How_?'\n\nTheir eyes met, and in the woman's gaze he found a horrible\nfascination, a devilish allurement to that which his soul shrank from.\nShe lowered her voice.\n\n'There's lots of ways. It 'ud be easy to make it seem as somebody did\nit just to rob him. He's always out late at night.'\n\nHis face was much the colour of the muddy water yellowed by that shaft\nof sunlight. His lips quivered. 'I dursn't, Clem. I tell you plain, I\ndursn't.'\n\n'Coward!' she snarled at him, savagely. 'Coward! All right, Mr. Bob.\nYou go your way, and I'll go mine.'\n\n'Listen here, Clem,' he gasped out, laying his hand on her arm. 'I'll\nthink about it. I won't say no. Give me a day to think about it.'\n\n'Oh, we know what your thinkin' means.'\n\nThey talked for some time longer, and before they parted Bob had given\na promise to do more than think.\n\nThe long, slouching strides with which he went up from the Embankment\nto the Strand gave him the appearance of a man partly overcome with\ndrink. For hours he walked about the City, in complete oblivion of\neverything external. Only when the lights began to shine from\nshop-windows did he consciously turn to his own district. It was\nraining now. The splashes of cool moisture made him aware how\nfeverishly hot his face was.\n\nWhen he got among the familiar streets he went slinkingly, hurrying\nround corners, avoiding glances. Almost at a run he turned into Merlin\nPlace, and he burst into his room as though he were pursued.\n\nPennyloaf had now but one child to look after, a girl of two years, a\nfeeble thing. Her own state was wretched; professedly recovered from\nillness, she felt so weak, so low-spirited, that the greater part of\nher day was spent in crying. The least exertion was too much for her;\nbut for frequent visits from Jane Snowdon she must have perished for\nvery lack of wholesome food. She was crying when startled by her\nhusband's entrance, and though she did her best to hide the signs of\nit, Bob saw.\n\n'When are you going to stop that?' he shouted.\n\nShe shrank away, looking at him with fear in her red eyes.\n\n'Stop your snivelling, and get me some tea!'\n\nIt was only of late that Pennyloaf had come to regard him with fear.\nHis old indifference and occasional brutality of language had made her\nlife a misery, but she had never looked for his return home with\nanything but anxious longing. Now the anticipation was mingled with\ndread. He not only had no care for her, not only showed that he felt\nher a burden upon him; his disposition now was one of hatred, and the\nkind of hatred which sooner or later breaks out in ferocity. Bob would\nnot have come to this pass--at all events not so soon--if he had been\nleft to the dictates of his own nature; he was infected by the savagery\nof the woman who had taken possession of him. Her lust of cruelty crept\nupon him like a disease, the progress of which was hastened by all the\ncircumstances of his disorderly life. The man was conscious of his\ndegradation; he knew how he had fallen ever since he began criminal\npractices; he knew the increasing hopelessness of his resolves to have\ndone with dangers and recover his peace of mind. The loss of his daily\nwork, in consequence of irregularity, was the last thing needed to\ncomplete his ruin. He did not even try to get new employment, feeling\nthat such a show of honest purpose was useless. Corruption was eating\nto his heart; from every interview with Clem he came away a feebler and\na baser being. And upon the unresisting creature who shared his home he\nhad begun to expend the fury of his self-condemnation.\n\nHe hated her because Clem bade him do so. He hated her because her\nsuffering rebuked him, because he must needs be at the cost of keeping\nher alive, because he was bound to her.\n\nAs she moved painfully about the room he watched her with cruel,\ndangerous eyes. There was a thought tormenting his brain, a terrifying\nthought he had pledged himself not to dismiss, and it seemed to\nexasperate him against Pennyloaf. He had horrible impulses, twitches\nalong his muscles; every second the restraint of keeping in one\nposition grew more unendurable, yet he feared to move.\n\nPennyloaf had the ill-luck to drop a saucer, and it broke on the floor.\nIn the same instant he leapt up and sprang on her, seized her brutally\nby the shoulders and flung her with all his force against the nearest\nwall. At her scream the child set up a shrill cry, and this increased\nhis rage. With his clenched fist he dealt blow after blow at the\nhalf-prostrate woman, speaking no word, but uttering a strange sound,\nsuch as might come from some infuriate animal. Pennyloaf still\nscreamed, till at length the door was thrown open and their neighbour,\nMrs. Griffin, showed herself.\n\n'Well, I never!' she cried, wrathfully, rushing upon Bob. 'Now you just\nstop that, young man! I thought it 'ud be comin' to this before long. I\nsaw you was goin' that way.'\n\nThe mildness of her expressions was partly a personal characteristic,\npartly due to Mrs. Griffin's very large experience of such scenes as\nthis. Indignant she might be, but the situation could not move her to\nany unwonted force of utterance. Enough that Bob drew back as soon as\nhe was bidden, and seemed from his silence to be half-ashamed of\nhimself.\n\nPennyloaf let herself lie at full length on the floor, her hands\nclutched protectingly about her head; she sobbed in a quick, terrified\nway, and appeared powerless to stop, even when Mrs. Griffin tried to\nraise her.\n\n'What's he been a-usin' you like this for?' the woman kept asking.\n'There, there now! He shan't hit you no more, he shan't!'\n\nWhilst she spoke Bob turned away and went from the room.\n\nFrom Merlin Place he struck off into Pentonville and walked towards\nKing's Cross at his utmost speed. Not that he had any object in\nhastening, but a frenzy goaded him along, faster, faster, till the\nsweat poured from him. From King's Cross, northwards; out to Holloway,\nto Hornsey. A light rain was ceaselessly falling; at one time he took\noff his hat and walked some distance bareheaded, because it was a\npleasure to feel the rain trickle over him. From Hornsey by a great\ncircuit he made back for Islington. Here he went into a public-house,\nto quench the thirst that had grown unbearable. He had but a shilling\nin his pocket, and in bringing it out he was reminded of the necessity\nof getting more money. He was to have met Jack Bartley to-night, long\nbefore this hour.\n\nHe took the direction for Smithfield, and soon reached the alley near\nBartholomew's Hospital where Bartley dwelt. As he entered the street he\nsaw a small crowd gathered about a public-house door; he hurried\nnearer, and found that the object of interest was a man in the clutch\nof two others. The latter, he perceived at a glance, were\npolice-officers in plain clothes; the man arrested was--Jack Bartley\nhimself.\n\nJack was beside himself with terror; he had only that moment been\nbrought out of the bar, and was pleading shrilly in an agony of\ncowardice.\n\n'It ain't me as made 'em! I never made one in my life! I'll tell you\nwho it is--I'll tell you where to find him--it's Bob Hewett as lives in\nMerlin Place! You've took the wrong man. It ain't me as made 'em! I'll\ntell you the whole truth, or may I never speak another word! It's Bob\nHewett made 'em all--he lives in Merlin Place, Clerkenwell. I'll tell\nyou--'\n\nThus far had Bob heard before he recovered sufficiently from the shock\nto move a limb. The officers were urging their prisoner forward,\ngrinning and nodding to each other, whilst several voices from the\ncrowd shouted abusively at the poltroon whose first instinct was to\nbetray his associate. Bob turned his face away and walked on. He did\nnot dare to run, yet the noises behind him kept his heart leaping with\ndread. A few paces and he was out of the alley. Even yet he durst not\nrun. He had turned in the unlucky direction; the crowd was still\nfollowing. For five minutes he had to keep advancing, then at last he\nwas able to move off at right angles. The crowd passed the end of the\nstreet.\n\nOnly then did complete panic get possession of him. With a bound\nforward like that of a stricken animal he started in blind flight. He\ncame to a crossing, and rushed upon it regardless of the traffic.\nBefore he could gain the farther pavement the shaft of a cart struck\nhim on the breast and threw him down. The vehicle was going at a slow\npace, and could be stopped almost immediately; he was not touched by\nthe wheel. A man helped him to his feet and inquired if he were hurt.\n\n'Hurt? No, no; it's all right.'\n\nTo the surprise of those who had witnessed the accident, he walked\nquickly on, scarcely feeling any pain. But in a few minutes there came\na sense of nausea and a warm rush in his throat; he staggered against\nthe wall and vomited a quantity of blood. Again he was surrounded by\nsympathising people; again he made himself free of them and hastened\non. But by now he suffered acutely; he could not run, so great was the\npain it cost him when he began to breathe quickly. His mouth was full\nof blood again.\n\nWhere could he find a hiding-place? The hunters were after him, and,\nhowever great his suffering, he must go through it in secrecy. But in\nwhat house could he take refuge? He had not money enough to pay for a\nlodging.\n\nHe looked about him; tried to collect his thoughts. By this time the\npolice would have visited Merlin Place; they would be waiting there to\ntrap him. He was tempted towards Farringdon Road Buildings; surely his\nfather would not betray him, and he was in such dire need of kindly\nhelp. But it would not be safe; the police would search there.\n\nShooter's Gardens? There was the room where lived Pennyloaf's drunken\nmother and her brother. They would not give him up. He could think of\nno other refuge, at all events, and must go there if he would not drop\nin the street.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\nMAD JACK'S DREAM\n\nIt was not much more than a quarter of an hour's walk, but pain and\nfear made the distance seem long; he went out of his way, too, for the\nsake of avoiding places that were too well lighted. The chief\noccupation of his thoughts was in conjecturing what could have led to\nBartley's arrest. Had the fellow been such a fool as to attempt passing\na bad coin when he carried others of the same kind in his pocket? Or\nhad the arrest of some other 'pal' in some way thrown suspicion on\nJack? Be it as it might, the game was up. With the usual wisdom which\ncomes too late, Bob asked himself how he could ever have put trust in\nBartley, whom he knew to be as mean-spirited a cur as breathed. On the\nchance of making things easier for himself, Jack would betray every\nsecret in his possession. What hope was there of escaping capture, even\nif a hiding-place could be found for a day or two? If he had his hand\non Jack Bartley's gizzard.\n\nAfraid to appear afraid, in dread lest his muddy clothing should\nattract observation, he kept, as often as possible, the middle of the\nroad, and with relief saw at length the narrow archway, with its\ndescending steps, which was one entrance to Shooter's Gardens. As\nusual, two or three loafers were hanging about here, exchanging\nblasphemies and filthy vocables, but, even if they recognised him,\nthere was not much fear of their giving assistance to the police. With\nhead bent he slouched past them, unchallenged. At the bottom of the\nsteps, where he was in all but utter darkness, his foot slipped on\ngarbage of some kind, and with a groan he fell on his side.\n\n'Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall,' cried a\nhigh-pitched voice from close by.\n\nBob knew that the speaker was the man notorious in this locality as Mad\nJack. Raising himself with difficulty, he looked round and saw a shape\ncrouching in the corner.\n\n'What is the principal thing?' continued the crazy voice. 'Wisdom is\nthe principal thing.'\n\nAnd upon that followed a long speech which to Bob sounded as gibberish,\nbut which was in truth tolerably good French, a language Mad Jack was\nfond of using, though he never made known how he had acquired it.\n\nBob stumbled on, and quickly came to the house where he hoped to find a\nrefuge. The door was, of course, open; he went in and groped his way up\nthe staircase. A knock at the door of the room which he believed to be\nstill tenanted by Mrs. Candy and her son brought no reply. He turned\nthe handle, but found that the door was locked.\n\nIt was not late, only about ten o'clock. Stephen Candy could not, of\ncourse, be back yet from his work, and the woman was probably drinking\nsomewhere. But he must make sure that they still lived here. Going down\nto the floor below, he knocked at the room occupied by the Hope family,\nand Mrs. Hope, opening the door a few inches, asked his business.\n\n'Does Mrs. Candy still live upstairs?' he inquired in a feigned voice,\nand standing back in the darkness.\n\n'For all I know.'\n\nAnd the door closed sharply. He had no choice but to wait and see if\neither of his acquaintances returned. For a few minutes he sat on the\nstaircase, but as at any moment some one might stumble over him, he\nwent down to the backdoor, which was open, like that in front, and\npassed out into the stone-paved yard. Here he seated himself on the\nground, leaning against a corner of the wall. He was suffering much\nfrom his injury, but could at all events feel secure from the hunters.\n\nThe stones were wet, and rain fell upon him. As he looked up at the\nlighted windows in the back of the house, he thought of Pennyloaf, who\nby this time most likely knew his danger. Would she be glad of it,\nfeeling herself revenged? His experience of her did not encourage him\nto believe that. To all his ill-treatment she had never answered with\nanything but tears and submission. He found himself wishing she were\nnear, to be helpful to him in his suffering.\n\nClem could not learn immediately what had come to pass. Finding he did\nnot keep his appointment for the day after to-morrow, she would\nconclude that he had drawn back. But perhaps Jack Bartley's case would\nbe in the newspapers on that day, and his own name might appear in the\nevidence before the magistrates; if Clem learnt the truth in that way,\nshe would be not a little surprised. He had never hinted to her the\nmeans by which he had been obtaining money.\n\nVoices began to sound from the passage within the house; several young\nfellows, one or other of whom probably lived here, had entered to be\nout of the rain. One voice, very loud and brutal, Bob quickly\nrecognised; it was that of Ned Higgs, the ruffian with whom Bartley's\nwife had taken up. The conversation was very easy to overhear; it\ncontained no reference to the 'copping' of Jack.\n\n'Fag ends!' this and that voice kept crying.\n\nBob understood. One of the noble company had been fortunate enough to\npig up the end of a cigar somewhere, and it was the rule among them\nthat he who called out 'Fag ends!' established a claim for a few\nwhiffs. In this way the delicacy was passing from mouth to mouth. That\nthe game should end in quarrel was quite in order, and sure enough,\nbefore very long, Ned Higgs was roaring his defiances to a companion\nwho had seized the bit of tobacco unjustly.\n\n'I 'ollered fag-end after Snuffy Bill!'\n\n'You're a ---- liar! I did!'\n\n'You! You're a ----! I'll ---- your ---- in arf a ---- second!'\n\nThen came the sound of a scuffle, the thud of blows, the wild-beast\nbellowing of infuriate voices. Above all could be heard the roar of Ned\nHiggs. A rush, and it was plain that the combatants had gone out into\nthe alley to have more room. For a quarter of an hour the yells from\ntheir drink-sodden throats echoed among the buildings. Quietness was\nprobably caused by the interference of police; knowing that, Bob shrank\ntogether in his lurking-place.\n\nWhen all had been still for some time he resolved to go upstairs again\nand try the door, for his breathing grew more and more painful, and\nthere was a whirling in his head which made him fear that he might\nbecome insensible. To rise was more difficult than he had imagined; his\nhead overweighted him, all but caused him to plunge forward; he groped\nthis way and that with his hands, seeking vainly for something to cling\nto on the whitewashed wall. In his depth of utter misery he gave way\nand sobbed several times. Then once more he had the warm taste of blood\nin his mouth. Terror-stricken, he staggered into the house.\n\nThis time a voice answered to his knock. He opened the door.\n\nThe room contained no article of furniture. In one corner lay some\nrags, and on the mantel-piece stood a tin teapot, two cups, and a\nplate. There was no fire, but a few pieces of wood lay near the hearth,\nand at the bottom of the open cupboard remained a very small supply of\ncoals. A candle made fast in the neck of a bottle was the source of\nlight.\n\nOn the floor was sitting, or lying, an animated object, indescribable;\nBob knew it for Mrs. Candy. Her eyes looked up at him apprehensively.\n\n'I want to stay the night over, if you'll let me.' he said, when he had\nclosed the door. 'I've got to hide away; nobody mustn't know as I'm\nhere.'\n\n'You're welcome,' the woman replied, in a voice which was horrible to\nhear.\n\nThen she paid no more attention to him, but leaned her head upon her\nhand and began a regular moaning, as if she suffered some dull,\npersistent pain.\n\nBob crept up to the wall and let himself sink there. He could not\nreflect for more than a minute or two continuously; his brain then\nbecame a mere confused whirl. In one of the intervals of his perfect\nconsciousness he asked Mrs. Candy if Stephen would come here to-night.\nShe did not heed him till he had twice repeated the question, and then\nshe started and looked at him in wild fear.\n\n'Will Stephen be coming?'\n\n'Stephen? Yes, yes. I shouldn't wonder.'\n\nShe seemed to fall asleep as soon as she had spoken; her head dropped\nheavily on the boards.\n\nNot long after midnight the potman made his appearance. As always, on\nreturning from his sixteen-hour day of work, he was all but insensible\nwith fatigue. Entering the room, he turned his white face with an\nexpression of stupid wonderment to the corner in which Bob lay. The\nlatter raised himself to a sitting posture.\n\n'That you, Bob Hewett?'\n\n'I want to stop here over the night,' replied the other, speaking with\ndifficulty. 'I can't go home. There's something up.'\n\n'With Pennyloaf?'\n\n'No. I've got to hide away. And I'm feeling bad--awful bad. Have you\ngot anything to drink?'\n\nStephen, having listened with a face of a somnambulist, went to the\nmantel-piece and looked into the teapot. It was empty.\n\n'You can go to the tap in the yard,' he said.\n\n'I couldn't get so far. Oh, I feel bad!'\n\n'I'll fetch you some water.'\n\nA good-hearted animal, this poor Stephen; a very tolerable human being,\nhad he had fair-play. He would not abandon his wretched mother, though\nto continue living with her meant hunger and cold and yet worse evils.\nFor himself, his life was supported chiefly on the three pints of\nliquor which he was allowed every day. His arms and legs were those of\na living skeleton; his poor idiotic face was made yet more repulsive by\ndisease. Yet you could have seen that he was the brother of Pennyloaf;\nthere was Pennyloaf's submissive beast-of-burden look in his eyes, and\nhis voice had something that reminded one of hers.\n\n'The coppers after you?' he whispered, stooping down to Bob with the\nteacup he had filled with water.\n\nBob nodded, then drained the cup eagerly.\n\n'I get knocked down by a cab or something,' he added. 'It hit me just\nhere. I may feel better when I've rested a bit. 'Haven't you got no\nfurniture left?'\n\n'They took it last Saturday was a week. Took it for rent. I thought we\ndidn't owe nothing, but mother told me she'd paid when she hadn't. I\ngot leave to stop, when I showed 'em as I could pay in future; but they\nwouldn't trust me to make up them three weeks. They took the furniture.\nIt's 'ard, I call it. I asked my guvnor if it was law for them to take\nmother's bed-things, an' he said yes it was. When it's for rent they\ncan take everything, even to your beddin' an' tools.'\n\nYes; they can take everything. How foolish of Stephen Candy and his\ntribe not to be born of the class of landlords! The inconvenience of\nhaving no foothold on the earth's surface is so manifest.\n\n'I couldn't say nothing to her,' he continued, nodding towards the\nprostrate woman. 'She was sorry for it, an' you can't ask no more. It\nwas my fault for trustin' her with the money to pay, but I get a bit\ncareless now an' then, an' forgot. You do look bad, Bob, an' there's no\nmistake. Would you feel better if I lighted a bit o' fire?'\n\n'Yes; I feel cold. I was hot just now.'\n\n'You needn't be afraid o' the coals. Mother goes round the streets\nafter the coal-carts, an' you wouldn't believe what a lot she picks up\nsome days. You see, we're neither of us in the 'ouse very often; we\ndon't burn much.'\n\nHe lit a fire, and Bob dragged himself near to it. In the meantime the\nquietness of the house was suffering a disturbance familiar to its\ndenizens. Mr. Hope--you remember Mr. Hope?--had just returned from an\nevening at the public-house, and was bent on sustaining his reputation\nfor unmatched vigour of language. He was quarrelling with his wife and\ndaughters; their high notes of vituperation mingled in the most\neffective way with his manly thunder. To hear Mr. Hope's expressions, a\nstranger would have imagined him on the very point of savagely\nmurdering all his family.\n\nAnother voice became audible. It was that of Ned Higgs, who had opened\nhis door to bellow curses at the disturbers of his rest.\n\n'They'll be wakin' mother,' said Stephen. 'There, I knew they would.'\n\nMrs. Candy stirred, and, after a few vain efforts to raise herself,\nstarted up suddenly. She fixed her eyes on the fire, which was just\nbeginning to blaze, and uttered a dreadful cry, a shriek of mad terror.\n\n'O God!' groaned her son. 'I hope it ain't goin' to be one of her bad\nnights. Mother, mother! what's wrong with you? See, come to the fire\nan' warm yourself, mother.'\n\nShe repeated the cry two or three times, but with less violence; then,\nas though exhausted, she fell face downwards, her arms folded about her\nhead. The moaning which Bob had heard earlier in the evening\nrecommenced.\n\nHappily, it was not to be one of her bad nights. Fits of the horrors\nonly came upon her twice before morning. Towards one o'clock Stephen\nhad sunk into a sleep which scarcely any conceivable uproar could have\nbroken; he lay with his head on his right arm, his legs stretched out\nat full length; his breathing was light. Bob was much later in getting\nrest. As often as he slumbered for an instant, the terrible image of\nhis fear rose manifest before him; he saw himself in the clutch of his\nhunters, just like Jack Bartley, and woke to lie quivering. Must not\nthat be the end of it, sooner or later? Might he not as well give\nhimself up to-morrow? But the thought of punishment such as his crime\nreceives was unendurable. It haunted him in nightmare when sheer\nexhaustion had at length weighed down his eyelids.\n\nLong before daybreak he was conscious again, tormented with thirst and\nhis head aching woefully. Someone had risen in the room above, and was\ntramping about in heavy boots. The noise seemed to disturb Mrs. Candy;\nshe cried out in her sleep. In a few minutes the early riser came forth\nand began to descend the stairs; he was going to his work.\n\nA little while, and in the court below a voice shouted, 'Bill Bill!'\nAnother worker being called, doubtless.\n\nAt seven o'clock Stephen roused himself. He took a piece of soap from a\nshelf of the cupboard, threw a dirty rag over his arm, and went down to\nwash at the tap in the yard. Only on returning did he address Bob.\n\n'Feelin' any better?'\n\n'I think so. But I'm very bad.'\n\n'Are you goin' to stay here?'\n\n'I don't know.'\n\n'Got any money?'\n\n'Yes. Ninepence. Could you get me something to drink?'\n\nStephen took twopence, went out, and speedily returned with a large mug\nof coffee; from his pocket he brought forth a lump of cake, which had\ncost a halfpenny. This, he thought, might tempt a sick appetite. His\nown breakfast he would take at the coffee-shop.\n\n'Mother'll get you anything else you want,' he said. 'She knows herself\ngenerally first thing in the morning. Let her take back the mug; I had\nto leave threepence on it.'\n\nSo Stephen also went forth to his labour--in this case, it may surely\nbe said, the curse of curses. . . .\n\nAt this hour Pennyloaf bestirred herself after a night of weeping. Last\nevening the police had visited her room, and had searched it\nthoroughly. The revelation amazed her; she would not believe the charge\nthat was made against her husband. She became angry with Mrs. Griffin\nwhen that practical woman said she was not at all surprised. Utterly\ngone was her resentment of Bob's latest cruelty. His failure to return\nhome seemed to prove that he had been arrested, and she could think of\nnothing but the punishment that awaited him.\n\n'It's penal servitude,' remarked Mrs. Griffin, frankly. 'Five, or\np'r'aps ten years. I've heard of 'em gettin' sent for life.'\n\nPennyloaf would not believe in the possibility of this befalling her\nhusband. It was too cruel. There would be some pity, some mercy. She\nhad a confused notion of witnesses being called to give a man a good\ncharacter, and strengthened herself in the thought of what she would\nsay, under such circumstances on Bob's behalf. 'He's been a good\n'usband,' she kept repeating to Mrs. Griffin, and to the other\nneighbours who crowded to indulge their curiosity. 'There's nobody can\nsay as he ain't been a good 'usband; it's a lie if they do.'\n\nBy eight o'clock she was at the police-station. With fear she entered\nthe ugly doorway and approached a policeman who stood in the ante-room.\nWhen she had made her inquiry, the man referred her to the inspector.\nShe was asked many questions, but to her own received no definite\nreply; she had better look in again the next morning.\n\n'It's my belief they ain't got him,' said Mrs. Griffin. 'He's had a\nwarnin' from his pals.'\n\nPennyloaf would dearly have liked to communicate with Jane Snowdon, but\nshame prevented her. All day she stood by the house door, looking\neagerly now this way, now that, with an unreasoning hope that Bob might\nshow himself. She tried to believe that he was only keeping away\nbecause of his behaviour to her the night before; it was the first time\nhe had laid hand upon her, and he felt ashamed of himself. He would\ncome back, and this charge against him would be proved false; Pennyloaf\ncould not distinguish between her desire that something might happen\nand the probability of its doing so.\n\nBut darkness fell upon the streets, and her watch was kept in rain. She\ndreaded the thought of passing another night in uncertainty. Long ago\nher tears had dried up; she had a parched throat and trembling,\nfeverish hands. Between seven and eight o'clock she went to Mrs.\nGriffin and begged her to take care of the child for a little while.\n\n'I'm goin' to see if I can hear anything about him. Somebody may know\nwhere he is.'\n\nAnd first of all she directed her steps to Shooter's Gardens. It was\nvery unlikely that her mother could be of any use, but she would seek\nthere. Afterwards she must go to Farringdon Road Buildings, though\nnever yet had she presented herself to Bob's father.\n\nYou remember that the Gardens had an offshoot, which was known simply\nas The Court. In this blind alley there stood throughout the day a row\nof baked-potato ovens, ten or a dozen of them, chained together, the\nproperty of a local capitalist who let them severally to men engaged in\nthis business. At seven o'clock of an evening fires were wont to be\nlighted under each of these baking-machines, preparatory to their being\nwheeled away, each to its customary street-corner. Now the lighting of\nfires entails the creation of smoke, and whilst these ten or twelve\novens were getting ready to bake potatoes the Court was in a condition\nnot easily described. A single lamp existed for the purpose of giving\nlight to the alley, and at no time did this serve much more than to\nmake darkness visible; at present the blind man would have fared as\nwell in that retreat as he who had eyes, and the marvel was how those\nwho lived there escaped suffocation. In the Gardens themselves volumes\nof dense smoke every now and then came driven along by the cold gusts;\nthe air had a stifling smell and a bitter taste.\n\nPennyloaf found nothing remarkable in this phenomenon; it is hard to\nsay what would have struck her as worthy of indignant comment in her\nworld of little ease. But near the entrance to the Court, dimly\ndiscernible amid sagging fumes, was a cluster of people, and as\neverything of that kind just now excited her apprehensions, she drew\nnear to see what was happening. The gathering was around Mad Jack; he\nlooked more than usually wild, and with one hand raised above his head\nwas on the point of relating a vision he had had the night before.\n\n'Don't laugh! Don't any of you laugh; for as sure as I live it was an\nangel stood in the room and spoke to me. There was a light such as none\nof you ever saw, and the angel stood in the midst of it. And he said to\nme: \"Listen, whilst I reveal to you the truth, that you may know where\nyou are and what you are; and this is done for a great purpose.\" And I\nfell down on my knees; but never a word could I have spoken. Then the\nangel said: \"You are passing through a state of punishment. You, and\nall the poor among whom you live; all those who are in suffering of\nbody and darkness of mind, were once rich people, with every blessing\nthe world can bestow, with every opportunity of happiness in yourselves\nand of making others happy. Because you made an ill use of your wealth,\nbecause you were selfish and hard-hearted and oppressive and sinful in\nevery kind of indulgence--therefore after death you received the reward\nof wickedness. This life you are now leading is that of the damned;\nthis place to which you are confined is Hell! There is no escape for\nyou. From poor you shall become poorer; the older you grow the lower\nshall you sink in want and misery; at the end there is waiting for you,\none and all, a death in abandonment and despair. This is\nHell--Hell--Hell!\"'\n\nHis voice had risen in pitch, and the last cry was so terrifying that\nPennyloaf fled to be out of hearing. She reached the house to which her\nvisit was, and in the dark passage leaned for a moment against the\nwall, trembling all over. Then she began to ascend the stairs. At Mrs.\nCandy's door she knocked gently. There was at first no answer, but when\nshe had knocked again, a strange voice that she did not recognise asked\n'Who's that?' It seemed to come from low down, as if the speaker were\nlying on the floor.\n\n'It's me,' she replied, again trembling, she knew not with what fear.\n'Mrs. Hewett--Pennyloaf.'\n\n'Are you alone?'\n\nShe bent down, listening eagerly.\n\n'Who's that speakin'?'\n\n'Are you alone?'\n\nStrange; the voice was again different, very feeble, a thick whisper.\n\n'Yes, there's nobody else. Can I come in?'\n\nThere was a shuffling sound, then the key turned in the lock, Pennyloaf\nentered, and found herself in darkness. She shrank back.\n\n'Who's there? Is it you, mother? Is it you, Stephen?'\n\nSome one touched her, at the same time shutting the door; and the voice\nwhispered:\n\n'Penny--it's me--Bob.'\n\nShe uttered a cry, stretching out her hands. A head was leaning against\nher, and she bent down to lay hers against it.\n\n'O Bob! What are you doin' here? Why are you in the dark? What's the\nmatter, Bob?'\n\n'I've had an accident, Penny. I feel awful bad. Your mother's gone out\nto buy a candle. Have they been coming after me?'\n\n'Yes, yes. But I didn't know you was here. I came to ask if they knew\nwhere you was. O Bob! what's happened to you? Why are you lyin' there,\nBob?'\n\nShe had folded her arms about him, and held his face to hers, sobbing,\nkissing him.\n\n'It's all up,' he gasped. 'I've been getting worse all day. You'll have\nto fetch the parish doctor. They'll have me, but I can't help it. I\nfeel as if I was going.'\n\n'They shan't take you, Bob. Oh no, they shan't. The doctor needn't know\nwho you are.'\n\n'It was a cab knocked me down, when I was running. I'm awful bad,\nPenny. You'll do something for me, won't you?'\n\n'Oh, why didn't you send mother for me?'\n\nThe door opened. It was Mrs. Candy who entered. She slammed the door,\nturned the key, and exclaimed in a low voice of alarm:\n\n'Bob, there's the p'lice downstairs! They come just this minute.\nThere's one gone to the back-door, and there's one talkin' to Mrs. Hope\nat the front.'\n\n'Then they've followed Pennyloaf,' he replied, in a tone of despair.\n'They've followed Pennyloaf.'\n\nIt was the truth. She had been watched all day, and was now tracked to\nShooter's Gardens, to this house. Mrs. Candy struck a match, and for an\ninstant illuminated the wretched room; she looked at the two, and they\nat length saw each other's faces. Then the little flame was\nextinguished, and a red spot marked the place where the remnant of the\nmatch lay.\n\n'Shall I light the candle?' the woman asked in a whisper.\n\nNeither replied, for there was a heavy foot on the stairs. It came\nnearer. A hand tried the door, then knocked loudly.\n\n'Mrs. Candy,' cried a stranger.\n\nThe three crouched together, terror-stricken, holding their breath.\nPennyloaf pressed her husband in an agonised embrace.\n\n'Mrs. Candy, you're wanted on business. Open the door. If you don't\nopen, we shall force it.'\n\n'No--no!' Pennyloaf whispered in her mother's ear. 'They shan't come\nin! Don't stir.'\n\n'Are you going to open the door?'\n\nIt was a different speaker--brief, stern. Ten seconds, and there came a\ntremendous crash; the crazy door, the whole wall, quivered and cracked\nand groaned. The crash was repeated, and effectually; with a sound of\nripping wood the door flew open and a light streamed into the room.\n\nUseless, Pennyloaf, useless. That fierce kick, making ruin of your\nrotten barrier, is dealt with the whole force of Law, of Society; you\nmight as well think of resisting death when your hour shall come.\n\n'There he is,' observed one of the men, calmly. 'Hollo! what's up?'\n\n'You can't take him away!' Pennyloaf cried, falling down again by Bob\nand clinging to him. 'He's ill, You can't take him like this!'\n\n'Ill, is he? Then the sooner our doctor sees him the better. Up you\nget, my man!'\n\nBut there are some things that even Law and Society cannot command. Bob\nlay insensible. Shamming? Well, no; it seemed not. Send for a\nstretcher, quickly.\n\nNo great delay. Pennyloaf sat in mute anguish, Bob's head on her lap.\nOn the staircase was a crowd of people, talking, shouting, whistling;\npresently they were cleared away by a new arrival of officials. Room\nfor Law and Society!\n\nThe stretcher arrived; the senseless body was carried down and laid\nupon it--a policeman at each end, and, close clinging, Pennyloaf.\n\nAbove the noise of the crowd rose a shrill, wild voice, chanting:\n\n'All ye works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord; praise Him and magnify\nHim for ever!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\nJOSEPH TRANSACTS MUCH BUSINESS\n\nAmid the anguish of heart and nerve which she had to endure whilst her\ngrandfather lay dead in the house, Jane found and clung to one thought\nof consolation. He had not closed his eyes in the bitterness of\ndisappointment. The end might have come on that miserable day when her\nweakness threatened the defeat of all his hopes, and how could she then\nhave borne it? True or not, it would have seemed to her that she had\nkilled him; she could not have looked on his face, and all the rest of\nher life would have been remorsefully shadowed. Now the dead features\nwere unreproachful; nay, when she overcame her childish tremors and\ngazed calmly, it was easy to imagine that he smiled. Death itself had\ncome without pain. An old man, weary after his long journeys, after his\nmany griefs and the noble striving of his thought, surely he rested\nwell.\n\nDuring the last days he had been more affectionate with her than was\nhis habit; she remembered it with gratitude. Words of endearment seldom\ncame to his lips, but since the reconciliation he had more than once\nspoken tenderly. Doubtless he was anxious to assure her that she had\nagain all his confidence. Strengthening herself in that reflection, she\nstrove to put everything out of her mind save the duty which must\nhenceforth direct her. Happily, there could be no more strife with the\npromptings of her weaker self; circumstances left but one path open\nbefore her; and that, however difficult, the one she desired to tread.\nHenceforth memory must dwell on one thing only in the past, her rescue\nby Michael Snowdon, her nurture under his care. Though he could no\nlonger speak, the recollection of his words must be her unfailing\nimpulse. In her his spirit must survive, his benevolence still be\noperative.\n\nAt her wish, her father acquainted Sidney Kirkwood with what had\nhappened. Sidney did not visit her, but he wrote a letter, which,\nhaving read it many times, she put carefully away to be a resource if\never her heart failed. Mr. Percival came to the house on Monday, in the\ncompany of Joseph Snowdon; he was sympathetic, but made no direct\nreference to her position either now or in the future. Whilst he and\nher father transacted matters of business in the upper rooms, Jane\nremained downstairs with Mrs. Byass. Before quitting the house he asked\nher if she had had any communication with Miss Lant yet.\n\n'I ought to write and tell her,' replied Jane.\n\n'I will do so for you,' said the lawyer, kindly.\n\nAnd on taking leave he held her hand for a moment, looking\ncompassionately into her pale face.\n\nOn Thursday morning there arrived a letter from Miss Lant, who happened\nto be out of town and grieved that she could not return in time for the\nfuneral, which would be that day. There was nothing about the future,\nexcepting a promise that the writer would come very shortly.\n\nMichael was buried at Abney Park Cemetery; no ray of sunlight fell upon\nhis open grave, but the weather was mild, and among the budded trees\npassed a breath which was the promise of spring. Joseph Snowdon and the\nByasses were Jane's only companions in the mourning-carriage; but at\nthe cemetery they were joined by Sidney Kirkwood. Jane saw him and felt\nthe pressure of his hand, but she could neither speak nor understand\nanything that was said to her.\n\nOn Friday morning, before she had made a show of eating the breakfast\nBessie Byass prepared for her, a visitor arrived.\n\n'She says her name's Mrs. Griffin,' said Bessie, 'and she has something\nvery important to tell you. Do you feel you can see her?'\n\n'Mrs. Griffin? Oh, I remember; she lives in the same house as\nPennyloaf. Yes: let her come in.'\n\nThe woman was introduced to the Byasses' parlour, which Bessie thought\nmore cheerful for Jane just now than the room upstairs.\n\n'Have you heard anything of what's been goin on with the Hewetts,\nMiss?' she began.\n\n'No, I haven't been able to go out this week. I've had trouble at home.'\n\n'I see at once as you was in in mournin', Miss, an' I'm sorry for it.\nYou're lookin' nothing like yourself. I don't know whether it's right\nto upset you with other people's bothers, but there's that poor Mrs.\nHewett in such a state, and I said as I'd run round, 'cause she seems\nto think there's nobody else can come to her help as you can. I always\nknew as something o' this kind 'ud be 'appenin'.'\n\n'But what is it? What has happened?'\n\nJane felt her energies revive at this appeal for help. It was the best\nthing that could have befallen, now that she was wearily despondent\nafter yesterday's suffering.\n\n'Her 'usband's dead, Miss.'\n\n'Dead?'\n\n'But that ain't the worst of it. He was took by the perlice last night,\nwhich they wanted him for makin' bad money. I always have said as it's\na cruel thing that: 'cause how can you tell who gets the bad coin, an'\nit may be some pore person as can't afford to lose not a 'apenny. But\nthat's what he's been up to, an' this long time, as it appears.'\n\nIn her dialect, which requires so many words for the narration of a\nsimple story, Mrs. Griffin told what she knew concerning Bob Hewett's\naccident and capture; his death had taken place early this morning, and\nPennyloaf was all but crazy with grief. To Jane these things sounded so\nextraordinary that for some time she could scarcely put a question, but\nsat in dismay, listening to the woman's prolix description of all that\nhad come to pass since Wednesday evening. At length she called for Mrs.\nByass, for whose benefit the story was repeated.\n\n'I'm sure you oughtn't to go there to-day,' was Bessie's opinion.\n'You've quite enough trouble of your own, my dear.'\n\n'And that's just what I was a-sayin', mum,' assented Mrs. Griffin, who\nhad won Bessie's highest opinion by her free use of respectful forms of\naddress. 'I never saw no one look iller, as you may say, than the young\nlady.'\n\n'Yes, yes, I will go,' said Jane, rising. 'My trouble's nothing to\nhers. Oh, I shall go at once.'\n\n'But remember your father's coming at half-past nine,' urged Bessie,\n'and he said he wanted to speak to you particular.'\n\n'What is the time now? A quarter to nine. I can be back by half-past, I\nthink, and then I can go again. Father wouldn't mind waiting a few\nminutes. I must go at once, Mrs. Byass.'\n\nShe would hear no objection, and speedily left the house in Mrs.\nGriffin's company.\n\nAt half-past nine, punctually, Mr. Snowdon's double knock sounded at\nthe door. Joseph looked more respectable than ever in his black\nfrock-coat and silk hat with the deep band. His bow to Mrs. Byass was\nsolemn, but gallant; he pressed her fingers like a clergyman paying a\nvisit of consolation, and in a subdued voice made affectionate inquiry\nafter his daughter.\n\n'She has slept, I hope, poor child?'\n\nBessie took him into the sitting-room, and explained Jane's absence.\n\n'A good girl; a good girl,' he remarked, after listening with elevated\nbrows, 'But she must be careful of her health. My visit this morning is\non matters of business; no doubt she will tell you the principal points\nof our conversation afterwards. An excellent friend you have been to\nher, Mrs. Byass--excellent.'\n\n'I'm sure I don't see how anyone could help liking her,' said Bessie,\ninwardly delighted with the expectation of hearing at length what\nJane's circumstances really were.\n\n'Indeed, so good a friend,' pursued Joseph, 'that I'm afraid it would\ndistress her if she could no longer live with you. And the fact is'--he\nbent forward and smiled sadly--'I'm sure I may speak freely to you,\nMrs. Byass--but the fact is, that I'm very doubtful indeed whether she\ncould be happy if she lived with Mrs. Snowdon. I suppose there's always\nmore or less difficulty where step-children are concerned, and in this\ncase--well, I fear the incompatibility would be too great. To be sure,\nit places me in a difficult position. Jane's very young--very young;\nonly just turned seventeen, poor child! Out of the question for her to\nlive with strangers. I had some hopes--I wonder whether I ought to\nspeak of it? You know Mr. Kirkwood?'\n\n'Yes, indeed. I can't tell you how surprised I was, Mr. Snowdon. And\nthere seems to be such a mystery about it, too.'\n\nBessie positively glowed with delight in such confidential talk. It was\nher dread that Jane's arrival might put an end to it before everything\nwas revealed.\n\n'A mystery, you may well say, Mrs. Byass. I think highly of Mr.\nKirkwood, very highly; but really in this affair! It's almost too\npainful to talk about--to _you_.'\n\nBessie blushed, as becomes the Englishwoman of mature years when she is\ngracefully supposed to be ignorant of all it most behoves her to know.\n\n'Well, well; he is on the point of marrying a young person with whom I\nshould certainly not like my daughter to associate--fortunately there\nis little chance of that. You were never acquainted with Miss Hewett?'\n\n'Ye--yes. A long time ago.'\n\n'Well, well; we must be charitable. You know that she is dreadfully\ndisfigured?'\n\n'Disfigured? Jane didn't say a word about that. She only told me that\nMr. Kirkwood was going to marry her, and I didn't like to ask too many\nquestions. I hadn't even heard as she was at home.'\n\nJoseph related to her the whole story, whilst Bessie fidgeted with\nsatisfaction.\n\n'I thought,' he added, 'that you could perhaps throw some light on the\nmystery. We can only suppose that Kirkwood has acted from the highest\nmotives, but I really think--well, well, we won't talk of it any more.\nI was led to this subject from speaking of this poor girl's position. I\nwonder whether it will be possible for her to continue to live in your\nfriendly care Mrs. Byass?'\n\n'Oh, I shall be only too glad, Mr. Snowdon!'\n\n'Now how kind that is of you! Of course she wouldn't want more than two\nrooms.'\n\n'Of course not.'\n\nJoseph was going further into details, when a latch-key was heard\nopening the front door. Jane entered hurriedly. The rapid walk had\nbrought colour to her check; in her simple mourning attire she looked\nvery interesting, very sweet and girlish. She had been shedding tears,\nand it was with unsteady voice that she excused herself for keeping her\nfather waiting.\n\n'Never mind that, my dear,' replied Joseph, as he kissed her cheek.\n'You have been doing good--unselfish as always. Sit down and rest; you\nmust be careful not to over-exert yourself.'\n\nBessie busied herself affectionately in removing Jane's hat and jacket,\nthen withdrew that father and child might converse in private. Joseph\nlooked at his daughter. His praise of her was not all mere affectation\nof sentiment. He had spoken truly when he said to Scawthorne that, but\nfor Clem, he would ask nothing better than to settle down with this\ngentle girl for his companion. Selfishness, for the most part, but\nimplying appreciation of her qualities. She did not love him, but he\nwas sincere enough with himself to admit that this was perfectly\nnatural. Had circumstances permitted, he would have tried hard to win\nsome affection from her. Poor little girl! How would it affect her when\nshe heard what he was going to say? He felt angry with Kirkwood; yes,\ntruly indignant--men are capable of greater inconsistencies than this.\nShe would not have cared much about the money had Kirkwood married her;\nof that he felt sure. She had lost her lover; now he was going to\ndeprive her of her inheritance. Cruel! Yes; but he really felt so\nwell-disposed to her, so determined to make her a comfortable provision\nfor the future; and had the money been hers, impossible to have\nregarded her thus. Joseph was thankful to the chance which, in making\nhim wealthy, had also enabled him to nourish such virtuous feeling.\n\nHow should he begin? He had a bright idea, an idea worthy of him.\nThrusting his hand into his pocket he brought out half-a-crown. Then:\n\n'Your humble friend's in a sad condition, I'm afraid, Jane?'\n\n'She is, father.'\n\n'Suppose you give her this! Every little helps, you know.'\n\nJane received the coin and murmured thanks for his kindness, but could\nnot help betraying some surprise. Joseph was on the watch for this. It\ngave him his exquisite opportunity.\n\n'You're surprised at me offering you money, Jane? I believe your poor\ngrandfather led you to suppose that--that his will was made almost\nentirely in your favour?'\n\nJane could not reply; she searched his face.\n\n'Would it disappoint you very much, my child,' he continued,\nsympathetically, 'if it turned out that he had either' altered his mind\nor by some accident had neglected to make his will? I speak as your\nfather, Janey, and I think I have some knowledge of your character. I\nthink I know that you are as free from avarice as anyone could be.'\n\nWas it true? he began to ask himself. Why, then, had her countenance\nfallen? Why did such a look of deep distress pass over it?\n\n'The fact is, Janey,' he continued, hardening himself a little as he\nnoted her expression, 'your grandfather left no will. The result--the\nlegal result--of that is, that all his property becomes--ah--mine.\nHe--in fact he destroyed his will a very short time, comparatively\nspeaking, before he died, and he neglected to make another.\nUnfortunately, you see, under these circumstances we can't be sure what\nhis wish was.'\n\nShe was deadly pale; there was anguish in the look with which she\nregarded her father.\n\n'I'm very sorry it pains you so, my dear,' Joseph remarked, still more\ncoldly. 'I didn't think you were so taken up with the thought of money.\nReally, Jane, a young girl at your time of life--'\n\n'Father, father, how can you think that? It wasn't to be for myself; I\nthought you knew; indeed you did know!'\n\n'But you looked so very strange, my dear. Evidently you felt--'\n\n'Yes--I feel it--I do feel it! But because it means that grandfather\ncouldn't get back his trust in me. Oh, it is too hard! When did he\ndestroy his will? When, father?'\n\n'Ten days before his death.'\n\n'Yes; that was when it happened. You never heard; he promised to tell\nnobody. I disappointed him. I showed myself very foolish and weak\nin--in something that happened then. I made grandfather think that I\nwas too selfish to live as he hoped--that I couldn't do what I'd\nundertaken. That was why he destroyed his will. And I thought he had\nforgiven me! I thought he trusted me again! O grandfather!'\n\nSnowdon was astonished at the explanation of his own good luck, and yet\nmore at Jane's display of feeling. So quiet, so reserved as he had\nalways known her, she seemed to have become another person. For some\nmoments he could only gaze at her in wonder. Never yet had he heard,\nnever again would he hear, the utterance of an emotion so profound and\nso noble.\n\n'Jane--try and control yourself, my dear. Let's talk it over, Jane.'\n\n'I feel as if it would break my heart. I thought I had that one thing\nto comfort me. It's like losing him again--losing his confidence. To\nthink I should have disappointed him in just what he hoped more than\nanything!'\n\n'But you're mistaken,' Joseph exclaimed, a generous feeling for once\ngetting the better of prudence. 'Listen, my dear, and I'll explain to\nyou. I hadn't finished when you interrupted me.'\n\nShe clasped her hands upon her lap and gazed at him in eager appeal.\n\n'Did he say anything to you, father?'\n\n'No--and you may be quite sure that if he _hasn't_ trusted you, he\n_would_ have said something. What's more, on the very day before his\ndeath he wrote a letter to Mr. Percival, to say that he wanted to make\nhis will again. He was going to do it on the Monday--there now. It was\nonly an accident; he hadn't time to do what he wished.'\n\nThis was making a concession which he had expressly resolved to guard\nagainst; but Joseph's designs ripened, lost their crudity, as he saw\nmore and more of his daughter's disposition. He was again grateful to\nher; she had made things smoother than he could have hoped.\n\n'You really think, father, that he would have made the same will as\nbefore?'\n\n'Not a doubt about it, my love; not a doubt of it. In fact--now let me\nset your poor little mind at rest--only two days before his death--when\nwas it I saw him last? Friday? Thursday?--he said to me that he had a\nhigher opinion of you than ever. There now, Jane!'\n\nShe would have deemed it impossible for anyone to utter less than truth\nin such connection as this. Her eyes gleamed with joy.\n\n'Now you understand just how it was, Jane. What we have to talk about\nnow is, how we can arrange things so as to carry out your grandfather's\nwish. I am your guardian, my dear. Now I'm sure you wouldn't desire to\nhave command of large sums of money before you are twenty-one? Just so;\nyour grandfather didn't intend it. Well, first let me ask you this\nquestion. Would you rather live with--with your stepmother, or with\nyour excellent friend Mrs. Byass? I see what your answer is, and I\napprove it; I fully approve it. Now suppose we arrange that you are to\nhave an allowance of two pounds a week? It is just possible--just\npossible--that I may have to go abroad on business before long; in that\ncase the payment would be made to you through an agent. Do you feel it\nwould be satisfactory?'\n\nJane was thinking how much of this sum could be saved to give away.\n\n'It seems little? But you see--'\n\n'No, no, father. It is quite enough.'\n\n'Good. We understand each other. Of course this is a temporary\narrangement. I must have time to think over grandfather's ideas. Why,\nyou are a mere child yet, Janey. Seventeen! A mere child, my dear!'\n\nForgetting the decorum imposed by his costume, Joseph became all but\ngay, so delightfully were things arranging themselves. A hundred a year\nhe could very well afford just to keep his conscience at ease; and for\nJane it would be wealth. Excellent Mrs. Byass was as good a guardian as\ncould anywhere be found, and Jane's discretion forbade any fear on her\naccount when--business should take him away.\n\n'Well now, we've talked quite long enough. Don't think for a moment\nthat you hadn't your grandfather's confidence, my dear; it would be\ndistressing yourself wholly without reason--wholly. Be a good\ngirl--why, there you see; I speak to you as if you were a child. And so\nyou are, poor little girl--far too young to have worldly troubles. No,\nno; I must relieve you of all that, until--Well now, I'll leave you for\nto-day. Good-bye, my dear.'\n\nHe kissed her cheek, but Jane, sobbing a little, put her pure lips to\nhis. Joseph looked about him for an instant as if he had forgotten\nsomething, then departed with what seemed unnecessary haste.\n\nJane and Mrs. Byass had a long talk before dinner-time. Mystery was at\nan end between them now; they talked much of the past, more of the\nfuture.\n\nAt two o'clock Jane received a visit from Miss Lant. This lady was\nalready apprised by her friend Mr. Percival of all that had come to\npass; she was prepared to exercise much discretion, but Jane soon\nshowed her that this was needless, The subject of pressing importance\nto the latter was Pennyloaf's disastrous circumstances; unable to do\nall she wished, Jane was much relieved when her charitable friend\nproposed to set off to Merlin Place forthwith and ascertain how help\ncould most effectually be given. Yes; it was good to be constrained to\nthink of another's sorrows.\n\nThere passed a fortnight, during which Jane spent some hours each day\nwith Pennyloaf. By the kindness of fate only one of Bob's children\nsurvived him, but it was just this luckless infant whose existence made\nPennyloaf's position so difficult. Alone, she could have gone back to\nher slop-work, or some less miserable slavery might have been\ndiscovered; but Pennyloaf dreaded leaving her child each day in the\ncare of strangers, being only too well aware what that meant. Mrs.\nCandy was, of course, worse than useless; Stephen the potman had more\nthan his work set in looking after her. Whilst Miss Lant and Jane were\nstraining their wits on the hardest of all problems--to find a means of\nlivelihood for one whom society pronounced utterly superfluous,\nPennyloaf most unexpectedly solved the question by her own effort.\nSomewhere near the Meat Market, one night, she encountered an\nacquaintance, a woman of not much more than her own age, who had\nrecently become a widow, and was supporting herself (as well as four\nlittle ones) by keeping a stall at which she sold children's secondhand\nclothing; her difficulty was to dispose of her children whilst she was\ndoing business at night. Pennyloaf explained her own position, and with\nthe result that her acquaintance, by name Mrs. Todd, proposed a\npartnership. Why shouldn't they share a room, work together with the\nneedle in patching and making, and by Pennyloaf's staying at home each\nevening keep the tribe of youngsters out of danger? This project was\ncarried out; the two brought their furniture together into a garret,\nand it seemed probable that they would succeed in keeping themselves\nalive.\n\nBut before this settlement was effected Jane's own prospects had\nundergone a change of some importance. For a fortnight nothing was\nheard of Joseph Snowdon in Hanover Street; then there came a letter\nfrom him; it bore a Liverpool postmark, but was headed with no address.\nJoseph wrote that the business to which he had alluded was already\nsummoning him from England; he regretted that there had not even been\ntime for him to say farewell to his daughter. However, he would write\nto her occasionally during his absence, and hoped to hear from her. The\nallowance of two pounds a week would be duly paid by an agent, and on\nreceiving it each Saturday she was to forward an acknowledgment to 'Mr.\nH. Jones,' at certain reading-rooms in the City. Let her in the\nmeantime be a good girl, remain with her excellent friend Mrs. Byass,\nand repose absolute confidence in her affectionate father--J. S.\n\nThat same morning there came also a letter from Liverpool to Mrs.\nJoseph Snowdon, a letter which ran thus:\n\n'Clem, old girl, I regret very much that affairs of pressing importance\ncall me away from my happy home. It is especially distressing that this\noccurs just at the time when we were on the point of taking our house,\nin which we hoped to spend the rest of our lives in bliss. Alas, that\nis not to be! Do not repine, and do not break the furniture in the\nlodgings, as your means will henceforth be limited, I fear. You will\nremember that I was in your debt, with reference to a little affair\nwhich happened in Clerkenwell Close, not such a long time ago; please\naccept this intimation as payment in full. When I am established in the\ncountry to which business summons me, I shall of course send for you\nimmediately, but it may happen that some little time will intervene\nbefore I am able to take that delightful step. In the meanwhile your\nmother will supply you with all the money you need; she has full\nauthority from me to do so. All blessings upon you, and may you be\nhappy.--With tears I sign myself,\n\n'YOUR BROKEN-HEARTED HUSBAND.'\n\nJoseph's absence through the night had all but prepared Clem for\nsomething of this kind, yet he had managed things so well that up to\nthe time of his departure she had not been able to remark a single\nsuspicious circumstance, unless, indeed, it were the joyous\naffectionateness with which he continued to behave. She herself had\nbeen passing through a time of excitement and even of suffering. When\nshe learned from the newspaper what fate had befallen Bob Hewett, it\nwas as though someone had dealt her a half-stunning blow; in her fierce\nanimal way she was attached to Bob, and for the first time in her life\nshe knew a genuine grief. The event seemed at first impossible; she\nsped hither and thither, making inquiries, and raged in her heart\nagainst everyone who confirmed the newspaper report. Combined with the\npain of loss was her disappointment at the frustration of the scheme\nBob had undertaken in concert with her. Brooding on her deadly purpose,\nshe had come to regard it as a certain thing that before long her\nhusband would be killed. The details were arranged; all her cunning had\ngone to the contrivance of a plot for disguising the facts of his\nmurder. Savagely she had exulted in the prospect, not only of getting\nrid of him, but of being revenged for her old humiliation. A thousand\ntimes she imagined herself in Bob's lurking-place, raising the weapon,\nstriking the murderous blow, rifling the man's pockets to mislead those\nwho found his body, and had laughed to herself triumphantly. Joseph out\nof the way, the next thing was to remove Pennyloaf. Oh, that would\neasily have been contrived. Then she and Bob would have been married.\n\nVery long since Clem had shed tears, but she did so this day when there\nwas no longer a possibility of doubting that Bob was dead. She shut\nherself in her room and moaned like a wild beast in pain. Joseph could\nnot but observe, when he came home, that she was suffering in some\nextraordinary way. When he spoke jestingly about it, she all but rushed\nupon him with her fists. And in the same moment she determined that he\nshould not escape, even if she had to murder him with her own hands.\nFrom that day her constant occupation was searching the newspapers to\nget hints about poisons. Doubtless it was as well for Joseph to be\nspeedy in his preparations for departure.\n\nShe was present in the police-court when Jack Bartley came forward to\nbe dealt with. Against him she stored up hatred and the resolve of\nvengeance; if it were years before she had the opportunity, Jack should\nin the end pay for what he had done.\n\nAnd now Joseph had played her the trick she anticipated; he had saved\nhimself out of her clutches, and had carried off all his money with\nhim. She knew well enough what was meant by his saying that her mother\nwould supply what she needed; very likely that he had made any such\narrangement! You should have heard the sterling vernacular in which\nClem gave utterance to her feelings as soon as she had deciphered the\nmocking letter?\n\nWithout a minute's delay she dressed and left the house. Having a few\nshillings in her pocket, she took a cab at King's Cross and bade the\ndriver drive his hardest to Clerkenwell Close. Up Pentonville Hill\npanted the bony horse, Clem swearing all the time because it could go\nno quicker. But the top was reached; she shouted to the man to whip,\nwhip? By the time they pulled up at Mrs. Peckover's house Clem herself\nperspired as profusely as the animal.\n\nMrs. Peckover was at breakfast, alone.\n\n'Read that, will you? Read that?' roared Clem, rushing upon her and\ndashing the letter in her face.\n\n'Why, you mad cat!' cried her mother, starting up in anger. 'What's\nwrong with you now?'\n\n'Read that there letter! That's _your_ doin', that is! Read it? Read\nit!'\n\nHalf-frightened, Mrs. Peckover drew away from the table and managed to\nperuse Joseph's writing. Having come to the end, she burst into jeering\nlaughter.\n\n'He's done it, has he? He's took his 'ook, has he? _What_ did I tell\nyou? Don't swear at me, or I'll give you something to swear about--such\nlanguidge in a respectable 'ouse! Ha, ha? What did I tell you? You\nwouldn't take _my_ way. Oh no, you must go off and be independent.\n_Serve_ you right! Ha, ha! _Serve_ you right! You'll get no pity from\nme.'\n\n'You 'old your jaw, mother, or I'll precious soon set my marks on your\nugly old face! What does he say there about you? You're to pay me\nmoney. He's made arrangements with you. Don't try to cheat me, or\nI'll--soon have a summons out against you. The letter's proof; it's\nlawyer's proof. You try to cheat me and see.'\n\nClem had sufficient command of her faculties to devise this line of\naction. She half believed, too, that the letter would be of some legal\nefficacy, as against her mother.\n\n'You bloomin' fool!' screamed Mrs. Peckover. 'Do you think I was born\nyesterday? Not one farden do you get out of me if you starve in the\nstreet--not one farden! It's my turn now. I've had about enough o' your\ncheek an' your hinsults. You'll go and work for your livin', you great\ncart-horse!'\n\n'Work! No fear! I'll set the perlice after him.'\n\n'The perlice! What can they do?'\n\n'Is it law as he can go off and leave me with nothing to live on?'\n\n'Course it is! Unless you go to the work'us an' throw yourself on the\nparish. Do, do! Oh my! Shouldn't I like to see you brought down to the\nwork'us, like Mrs. Igginbottom, the wife of the cat's-meat man, him as\nthey stuck up wanted for desertion!'\n\n'You're a liar!' Clem shouted. 'I can make _you_ support me before it\ncomes to that.'\n\nThe wrangle continued for some time longer; then Clem bethought herself\nof another person with whom she must have the satisfaction of speaking\nher mind. On the impulse, she rushed away, out of Clerkenwell Close, up\nSt. John Street Road, across City Road, down to Hanover Street,\nliterally running for most of the time. Her knock at Mrs. Byass's door\nwas terrific.\n\n'I want to see Jane Snowdon,' was her address to Bessie.\n\n'Do you? I think you might have knocked more like civilisation,'\nreplied Mrs. Byass, proud of expressing herself with superior\nrefinement.\n\nBut Clem pushed her way forward. Jane, alarmed at the noise, showed\nherself on the stairs.\n\n'You just come 'ere!' cried Clem to her. 'I've got something to say to\n_you_, Miss!'\n\nJane was of a sudden possessed with terror, the old terror with which\nClem had inspired her years ago. She shrank back, but Bessie Byass was\nby no means disposed to allow this kind of thing to go on in her house.\n\n'Mrs. Snowdon,' she exclaimed, 'I don't know what your business may be,\nbut if you can't behave yourself, you'll please to go away a bit\nquicker than you came. The idea! Did anyone ever hear!'\n\n'I shan't go till I choose,' replied Clem, 'and that won't be till I've\nhad my say with that little ----! Where's your father, Jane Snowdon?\nYou just tell me that.'\n\n'My father,' faltered Jane, in the silence. 'I haven't seen him for a\nfortnight.'\n\n'You haven't, eh? Little liar! It's what I used to call you when you\nscrubbed our kitchen floor, and it's what I call you now. D'you\nremember when you did the 'ouse-work, an' slept under the kitchen\ntable? D'you remember, eh? Haven't seen him for a fortnight, ain't you?\nOh, he's a nice man, is your father! He ran away an' deserted your\nmother. But he's done it once too often, _I_'ll precious soon have the\nperlice after him! Has he left you to look after yourself? Has he, eh?\nYou just tell me that!'\n\nJane and Mrs. Byass stared at each other in dismay. The letter that had\ncome this morning enabled them to guess the meaning of Clem's fury. The\nlatter interpreted their looks as an admission that Jane too was a\nvictim. She laughed aloud.\n\n'How does it taste, little liar, oh? A second disappointment! You\nthought you was a-goin' to have all the money; now you've got none, and\nyou may go back to Whitehead's. They'll be glad to see you, will\nWhitehead's. Oh, he's a nice man, your father! Would you like to know\nwhat's been goin' on ever since he found out your old grandfather?\nWould you like to know how he put himself out to prevent you an' that\nKirkwood feller gettin' married, just so that the money mightn't get\ninto other people's 'ands? Would you like to know how my beast of a\nmother and him put their 'eds together to see how they could get hold\nof the bloomin' money? An' _you_ thought you was sure of it, didn't\nyou? Will you come with me to the perlice-station, just to help to\ndescribe what he looks like? An affectionate father, ain't he? Almost\nas good as he is a 'usband. You just listen to me, Jane Snowdon. If I\nfind out as you're havin' money from him, I'll be revenged on you, mind\nthat! I'll be revenged on you! D'you remember what my hand feels like?\nYou've had it on the side of your ---- 'ed often enough. You just look\nout for yourself!'\n\n'And you just turn out of my house,' cried Bessie, scarlet with wrath.\n'This minute! Sarah! Sarah! Run out by the arey-steps and fetch a\np'liceman, this minute! The idea!'\n\nClem had said her say, however, and with a few more volleys of\natrocious language was content to retire. Having slammed the door upon\nher, Bessie cried in a trembling voice:\n\n'Oh, if only Sam had been here! My, how I should have liked Sam to have\nbeen here! _Wouldn't_ he have given her something for herself! Why,\nsuch a creature oughtn't be left loose. Oh, if Sam had been here!'\n\nJane had sat down on the stairs; her face was hidden in her hands. That\nbrutal voice had carried her back to her wretched childhood; everything\nabout her in the present was unreal in comparison with the terrors, the\nhardships, the humiliations revived by memory. As she sat at this\nmoment, so had she sat many a time on the cellar-steps at Mrs.\nPeckover's. So powerfully was her imagination affected that she had a\nfeeling as if her hands were grimy from toil, as if her limbs ached.\nOh, that dreadful voice! Was she never, never to escape beyond hearing\nof it?\n\n'Jane, my dear, come into the sitting-room,' said Bessie 'No wonder\nit's upset you. What _can_ it all mean?'\n\nThe meaning was not far to seek; Jane understood everything--yes, even\nher father's hypocrisies. She listened for a few minutes to her\nfriend's indignant exclamations, then looked up, her resolve taken.\n\n'Mrs. Byass, I shall take no more money. I shall go to work again and\nearn my living. How thankful I am that I can!'\n\n'Why, what nonsense are you talking, child! Just because that--that\n_creature_--Why, I've no patience with you, Jane! As if she durst touch\nyou! Touch you? I'd like to see her indeed.'\n\n'It isn't that, Mrs. Byass. I can't take money from father. I haven't\nfelt easy in my mind ever since he told me about it, and now I _can't_\ntake the money. Whether it's true or not, all she said, I should never\nhave a night's rest if I consented to live in this way.'\n\n'Oh, you _don't_ really mean it, Jane?'\n\nBessie all but sobbed with vexation.\n\n'I mean it, and I shall never alter my mind. I shall send back the\nmoney, and write to the man that he needn't send any more. However\noften it comes, I shall always return it. I couldn't, I couldn't live\non that money! Never ask me to, Mrs. Byass.'\n\nPractical Bessie had already begun to ask herself what arrangement Jane\nproposed to make about lodgings. She was no Mrs. Peckover, but neither\ndid circumstances allow her to disregard the question of rent. It cut\nher to the heart to think of refusing an income of two pounds per week.\n\nJane too saw all the requirements of the case.\n\n'Mrs. Byass, will you let me have one room--my old room upstairs? I\nhave been very happy there, and I should like to stay if I can. You\nknow what I can earn; can you afford to let me live there? I'd do my\nutmost to help you in the house; I'll be as good as a servant, if you\ncan't keep Sarah. I should so like to stay with you!'\n\n'You just let me hear you talk about leaving, that's all! Wait till\nI've talked it over with Sam.'\n\nJane went upstairs, and for the rest of the day the house was very\nquiet.\n\nNot Whitehead's; there were other places where work might be found. And\nbefore many days she had found it. Happily there were no luxuries to be\nlaid aside; her ordinary dress was not too good for the workroom. She\nhad no habits of idleness to overcome, and an hour at the table made\nher as expert with her fingers as ever.\n\nReturning from the first day's work, she sat in her room--the little\nroom which used to be hers--to rest and think for a moment before going\ndown to Bessie's supper-table. And her thought was:\n\n'He, too, is just coming home from work. Why should my life be easier\nthan his?'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\nSIDNEY\n\nLook at a map of greater London, a map on which the town proper shows\nas a dark, irregularly rounded patch against the whiteness of suburban\ndistricts, and just on the northern limit of the vast network of\nstreets you will distinguish the name of Crouch End. Another decade,\nand the dark patch will have spread greatly further; for the present,\nCrouch End is still able to remind one that it was in the country a\nvery short time ago. The streets have a smell of newness, of dampness;\nthe bricks retain their complexion, the stucco has not rotted more than\none expects in a year or two; poverty tries to hide itself with\nvenetian blinds, until the time when an advanced guard of houses shall\njustify the existence of the slum.\n\nCharacteristic of the locality is a certain row of one-storey\ncottages--villas, the advertiser calls them--built of white brick, each\nwith one bay window on the ground floor, a window pretentiously\nfashioned and desiring to be taken for stone, though obviously made of\nbad plaster. Before each house is a garden, measuring six feet by\nthree, entered by a little iron gate, which grinds as you push it, and\nat no time would latch. The front-door also grinds on the sill; it can\nonly be opened by force, and quivers in a way that shows how\nunsubstantially it is made. As you set foot in the pinched passage, the\nsound of your tread proves the whole fabric a thing of lath and sand.\nThe ceilings, the walls, confess themselves neither water-tight nor\nair-tight. Whatever you touch is at once found to be sham.\n\nIn the kitchen of one of these houses, at two o'clock on a Saturday\nafternoon in September, three young people were sitting down to the\ndinner-table: a girl of nearly fourteen, her sister, a year younger,\nand their brother not yet eleven. All were decently dressed, but very\npoorly; a glance at them, and you knew that in this house there was\nlittle money to spend on superfluities. The same impression was\nproduced by the appointments of the kitchen, which was disorderly, too,\nand spoke neglect of the scrubbing-brush. As for the table, it was ill\nlaid and worse supplied. The meal was to consist of the fag-end of a\nshoulder of mutton, some villainously cooked potatoes (_a l'Anglaise_)\nand bread.\n\n'Oh, I can't eat this rot again!' cried the boy, making a dig with his\nfork at the scarcely clad piece of bone. 'I shall have bread and\ncheese. Lug the cheese out, Annie!'\n\n'No, you won't,' replied the elder girl, in a disagreeable voice.\n'You'll eat this or go without.'\n\nShe had an unpleasing appearance. Her face was very thin, her lips\npinched sourly together, her eyes furtive, hungry, malevolent. Her\nmovements were awkward and impatient, and a morbid nervousness kept her\nconstantly starting, with a stealthy look here or there.\n\n'I shall have the cheese if I like!' shouted the boy, a very\nill-conditioned youngster, whose face seemed to have been damaged in\nrecent conflict. His clothes were dusty, and his hair stood up like\nstubble.\n\n'Hold your row, Tom,' said the younger girl, who was quiet and had the\nlook of an invalid. 'It's always you begins. Besides, you can't have\ncheese; there's only a little bit, and Sidney said he was going to make\nhis dinner of it to-day.'\n\n'Of course--selfish beast!'\n\n'Selfish! Now just listen to that, Amy! when he said it just that we\nmightn't be afraid to finish the meat.'\n\nAmy said nothing, but began to hack fragments off the bone.\n\n'Put some aside for father first,' continued Annie, holding a plate.\n\n'Father be blowed!' cried Tom. 'You just give me that first cut. Give\nit here, Annie, or I'll crack you on the head!'\n\nAs he struggled for the plate, Amy bent forward and hit his arm\nviolently with the handle of the knife. This was the signal for a\ngeneral scrimmage, in the midst of which Tom caught up a hearth-brush\nand flung it at Amy's head. The missile went wide of its mark and\nshivered one of the windowpanes.\n\n'There now!' exclaimed Annie, who had begun to cry in consequence of a\nblow from Tom's fist. 'See what father says to that!'\n\n'If I was him,' said Amy, in a low voice of passion, 'I'd tie you to\nsomething and beat you till you lost your senses. Ugly brute!'\n\nThe warfare would not have ended here but that the door opened and he\nof whom they spoke made his appearance.\n\nIn the past two years and a half John Hewett had become a shaky old\nman. Of his grizzled hair very little remained, and little of his\nbeard; his features were shrunken, his neck scraggy; he stooped much,\nand there was a senile indecision in his movements. He wore rough,\npatched clothing, had no collar, and seemed, from the state of his\nhands, to have been engaged in very dirty work. As he entered and came\nupon the riotous group his eyes lit up with anger. In a strained voice\nhe shouted a command of silence.\n\n'It's all that Tom, father,' piped Annie. 'There's no living with him.'\n\nJohn's eye fell on the broken window.\n\n'Which of you's done that?' he asked sternly, pointing to it.\n\nNo one spoke.\n\n'Who's goin' to pay for it, I'd like to know? Doesn't it cost enough to\nkeep you, but you must go makin' extra expense? Where's the money to\ncome from, I want to know, if you go on like this?'\n\nHe turned suddenly upon the elder girl.\n\n'I've got something to say to you, Miss. Why wasn't you at work this\nmorning?'\n\nAmy avoided his look. Her pale face became mottled with alarm, but only\nfor an instant; then she hardened herself and moved her head insolently.\n\n'Why Wasn't you at work? Where's your week's money?'\n\n'I haven't got any.'\n\n'You haven't got any? Why not?'\n\nFor a while she was stubbornly silent, but Hewett constrained her to\nconfession at length. On his way home to-day he had been informed by an\nacquaintance that Amy was wandering about the streets at an hour when\nshe ought to have been at her employment. Unable to put off the evil\nmoment any longer, the girl admitted that four days ago she was\ndismissed for bad behaviour, and that since then she had pretended to\ngo to work as usual. The trifling sum paid to her on dismissal she had\nspent.\n\nJohn turned to his youngest daughter and asked in a hollow voice:\n\n'Where's Clara?'\n\n'She's got one of her headaches, father,' replied the girl, trembling.\n\nHe turned and went from the room.\n\nIt was long since he had lost his place of porter at the filter-works.\nBefore leaving England, Joseph Snowdon managed to dispose of his\ninterest in the firm of Lake, Snowdon, & Co., and at the same time\nHewett was informed that his wages would be reduced by five shillings a\nweek--the sum which had been supplied by Michael Snowdon's benevolence.\nIt was a serious loss. Clara's marriage removed one grave anxiety, but\nthe three children had still to be brought up, and with every year\nJohn's chance of steady employment would grow less. Sidney Kirkwood\ndeclared himself able and willing to help substantially, but he might\nbefore long have children of his own to think of, and in any case it\nwas Shameful to burden him in this way.\n\nShameful or not, it very soon came to pass that Sidney had the whole\nfamily on his hands. A bad attack of rheumatism in the succeeding\nwinter made John incapable of earning anything at all; for two months\nhe was a cripple. Till then Sidney and his wife had occupied lodgings\nin Holloway; when it became evident that Hewett must not hope to be\nable to support his children, and when Sidney had for many weeks p aid\nthe rent (as well as supplying the money to live upon) in Farringdon\nRoad Buildings, the house at Crouch End was taken, and there all went\nto live together. Clara's health was very uncertain, and though at\nfirst she spoke frequently of finding work to do at home, the birth of\na child put an end to such projects. Amy Hewett was shortly at the\npoint when the education of a board-school child is said to be\n'finished;' by good luck, employment was found for her in Kentish Town,\nwith three shillings a week from the first. John could not resign\nhimself to being a mere burden on the home. Enforced idleness so\nfretted him that at times he seemed all but out of his wits. In despair\nhe caught at the strangest kinds of casual occupation; when earning\nnothing, he would barely eat enough to keep himself alive, and if he\nsucceeded in bringing home a shilling or two, he turned the money about\nin his hands with a sort of angry joy that it would have made your\nheart ache to witness. Just at present he had a job of cleaning and\nwhitewashing some cellars in Stoke Newington.\n\nHe was absent from the kitchen for five minutes, during which time the\nthree sat round the table. Amy pretended to eat unconcernedly; Tom made\ngrimaces at her. As for Annie, she cried. Their father entered the room\nagain.\n\n'Why didn't you tell us about this at once?' he asked, in a shaking\nvoice, looking at his daughter with eyes of blank misery.\n\n'I don't know.'\n\n'You're a bad, selfish girl!' he broke out, again overcome with anger.\n'Haven't you got neither sense nor feelin' nor honesty? Just when you\nought to have begun to earn a bit higher wages--when you ought to have\nbeen glad to work your hardest, to show you wasn't unthankful to them\nas has done so much for you! Who earned money to keep you when you was\ngoin' to school? Who fed and clothed you, and saw as you didn't want\nfor nothing? Who is it as you owe everything to?--just tell me that.'\n\nAmy affected to pay no attention. She kept swallowing morsels, with\nugly movements of her lips and jaws.\n\n'How often have I to tell you all that if it wasn't for Sidney Kirkwood\nyou'd have been workhouse children? As sure as you're livin', you'd all\nof you have gone to the workhouse! And you go on just as if you didn't\nowe thanks to nobody. I tell you it'll be years and years before one of\nyou'll have a penny you can call your own. If it was Annie or Tom\nbehaved so careless, there'd be less wonder; but for a girl of your\nage--I'm ashamed as you belong to me! You can't even keep your tongue\nfrom bein' impudent to Clara, her as you ain't worthy to be a servant\nto!'\n\n'Clara's a sneak,' observed Tom, with much coolness. 'She's always\ntelling lies about us.'\n\n'I'll half-knock your young head off your shoulders,' cried his father,\nfuriously, 'if you talk to me like that! Not one of you's fit to live\nin the same house with her.'\n\n'Father, I haven't done nothing,' whimpered Annie, hurt by being thus\nincluded in his reprobation.\n\n'No more you have--not just now, but you're often enough more trouble\nto your sister than you need be. But it's you I'm talkin' to, Amy. You\ndare to leave this house again till there's another place found for\nyou! If you'd any self-respect, you couldn't bear to look Sidney in the\nface. Suppose you hadn't such a brother to work for you, what would you\ndo, eh? Who'd buy your food? Who'd pay the rent of the house you live\nin?'\n\nA noteworthy difference between children of this standing and such as\npass their years of play-time in homes unshadowed by poverty. For\nthese, life had no illusions. Of every mouthful that they ate, the\nprice was known to them. The roof over their heads was there by no\ngrace of Providence, but solely because such-and-such a sum was paid\nweekly in hard cash, when the collector came; let the payment fail, and\nthey knew perfectly well what the result would be. The children of the\nupper world could not even by chance give a thought to the sources\nwhence their needs are supplied; speech on such a subject in their\npresence would be held indecent. In John Hewett's position, the\nindecency, the crime, would have been to keep silence and pretend that\nthe needs of existence are ministered to as a matter of course.\n\nHis tone and language were pitifully those of feeble age. The emotion\nproved too great a strain upon his body, and he had at length to sit\ndown in a tremulous state, miserable with the consciousness of failing\nauthority. He would have made but a poor figure now upon Clerkenwell\nGreen. Even as his frame was shrunken, so had the circle of his\ninterests contracted; he could no longer speak or think on the subjects\nwhich had fired him through the better part of his life; if he was\ndriven to try and utter himself on the broad questions of social wrong,\nof the people's cause, a senile stammering of incoherencies was the\nonly result. The fight had ever gone against John Hewett; he was one of\nthose who are born to be defeated. His failing energies spent\nthemselves in conflict with his own children; the concerns of a\nmiserable home were all his mind could now cope with.\n\n'Come and sit down to your dinner, father,' Annie said, when he became\nsilent.\n\n'Dinner? I want no dinner. I've no stomach for food when it's stolen.\nWhat's Sidney goin' to have when he comes home?'\n\n'He said he'd do with bread and cheese to-day. See, we've cut some meat\nfor you?'\n\n'You keep that for Sidney, then, and don't one of you dare to say\nanything about it. Cut me a bit of bread, Annie.'\n\nShe did so. He ate it, standing by the fireplace, drank a glass of\nwater, and went into the sitting-room. There he sat unoccupied for\nnearly an hour, his head at times dropping forward as if he were nearly\nasleep; but it was only in abstraction. The morning's work had wearied\nhim excessively, as such effort always did, but the mental misery he\nwas suffering made him unconscious of bodily fatigue.\n\nThe clinking and grinding of the gate drew his attention; he stood up\nand saw his son-in-law, returned from Clerkenwell. When he had heard\nthe house-door grind and shake and close, he called 'Sidney!'\n\nSidney looked into the parlour, with a smile.\n\n'Come in here a minute; I want to speak to you.'\n\nIt was a face that told of many troubles. Sidney might resolutely keep\na bright countenance, but there was no hiding the sallowness of his\ncheeks and the lines drawn by ever-wakeful anxiety. The effect of a\nstruggle with mean necessities is seldom anything but degradation, in\nlook and in character; but Sidney's temper, and the conditions of his\nlife, preserved him against that danger. His features, worn into\nthinness, seem to present more distinctly than ever their points of\nrefinement. You saw that he was habitually a grave and silent man; all\nthe more attractive his aspect when, as now, he seemed to rest from\nthought and give expression to his natural kindliness. In the matter of\nattire he was no longer as careful as he used to be; the clothes he\nwore had done more than just service, and hung about him unregarded.\n\n'Clara upstairs?' he asked, when he had noticed Hewett's look.\n\n'Yes; she's lying down. May's been troublesome all the morning. But it\nwas something else I meant.'\n\nAnd John began to speak of Amy's ill-doing. He had always in some\ndegree a sense of shame when he spoke privately with Sidney, always\nfelt painfully the injustice involved in their relations. At present he\ncould not look Kirkwood in the face, and his tone was that of a man who\nabases himself to make confession of guilt.\n\nSidney was gravely concerned. It was his habit to deal with the\nchildren's faults good-naturedly, to urge John not to take a sombre\nview of their thoughtlessness; but the present instance could not be\nmade light of. Secretly he had always expected that the girl would be a\nsource of more serious trouble the older she grew. He sat in silence,\nleaning forward, his eyes bent down.\n\n'It's no good whatever _I_ say,' lamented Hewett. 'They don't heed me.\nWhy must I have children like these? Haven't I always done my best to\nteach them to be honest and good-hearted? If I'd spent my life in the\nworst ways a man can, they couldn't have turned out more worthless.\nHaven't I wished always what was right and good and true? Haven't I\nalways spoke up for justice in the world? Haven't I done what I could,\nSidney, to be helpful to them as fell into misfortune? And now in my\nold age I'm only a burden, and the children as come after me are\nnothing but a misery to all as have to do with them. If it wasn't for\nClara I feel I couldn't live my time out. She's the one that pays me\nback for the love I've given her. All the others--I can't feel as\nthey're children of mine at all.'\n\nIt was a strange and touching thing that he seemed nowadays utterly to\nhave forgotten Clara's past. Invariably he spoke of her as if she had\nat all times been his stay and comfort. The name of his son who was\ndead never passed his lips, but of Clara he could not speak too long or\ntoo tenderly.\n\n'I can't think what to do,' Sidney said. 'If I talk to her in a\nfault-finding way, she'll only dislike me the more; she feels I've no\nbusiness to interfere.'\n\n'You're too soft with them. You spoil them. Why, there's one of them\nbroken a pane in the kitchen to-day, and they know you'll take it\nquiet, like you do everything else.'\n\nSidney wrinkled his brow. These petty expenses, ever repeated, were\njust what made the difficulty in his budget; he winced whenever such\ndemands encroached upon the poor weekly income of which every penny was\ntoo little for the serious needs of the family. Feeling that if he sat\nand thought much longer a dark mood would seize upon him, he rose\nhastily.\n\n'I shall try kindness with her. Don't say anything more in her hearing.'\n\nHe went to the kitchen-door, and cried cheerfully, 'My dinner ready,\ngirls?'\n\nAnnie's voice replied with a timorous affirmative.\n\n'All right; I'll be down in a minute.'\n\nTreading as gently as possible, he ascended the stairs and entered his\nbedroom. The blind was drawn down, but sunlight shone through it and\nmade a softened glow in the chamber. In a little cot was sitting his\nchild, May, rather more than a year old; she had toys about her, and\nwas for the moment contented. Clara lay on the bed, her face turned so\nthat Sidney could not see it. He spoke to her, and she just moved her\narm, but gave no reply.\n\n'Do you wish to be left alone?' he asked, in a subdued and troubled\nvoice.\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Shall I take May downstairs?'\n\n'If you like. Don't speak to me now.'\n\nHe remained standing by the bed for a minute, then turned his eyes on\nthe child, who smiled at him. He could not smile in return, but went\nquietly away.\n\n'It's one of her bad days,' whispered Hewett, who met him at the foot\nof the stairs. 'She can't help it, poor girl!'\n\n'No, no.'\n\nSidney ate what was put before him without giving a thought to it. When\nhis eyes wandered round the kitchen the disorder and dirt worried him,\nbut on that subject he could not speak. His hunger appeased, he looked\nsteadily at Amy, and said in a kindly tone:\n\n'Father tells me you've had a stroke of bad luck, Amy. We must have a\ntry at another place, mustn't we? Hollo, there's a window broken! Has\nTom been playing at cricket in the room, eh?'\n\nThe girls kept silence.\n\n'Come and let's make out the list for our shopping this afternoon,' he\ncontinued. 'I'm afraid there'll have to be something the less for that\nwindow, girls; what do _you_ say?'\n\n'We'll do without a pudding to-morrow, Sidney,' suggested Annie.\n\n'Oh come, now! I'm fond of pudding.'\n\nThus it was always; if he could not direct by kindness, he would never\ntry to rule by harsh words. Six years ago it was not so easy for him to\nbe gentle under provocation, and he would then have made a better\ndisciplinarian in such a home as this. On Amy and Tom all his rare\ngoodness was thrown away. Never mind; shall one go over to the side of\nevil because one despairs of vanquishing it?\n\nThe budget, the budget! Always so many things perforce cut out; always\nsuch cruel pressure of things that _could_ not be cut out. In the early\ndays of his marriage he had accustomed himself to a liberality of\nexpenditure out of proportion to his income; the little store of\nsavings allowed him to indulge his kindness to Clara and her relatives,\nand he kept putting off to the future that strict revision of outlay\nwhich his position of course demanded. The day when he had no longer a\nchoice came all too soon; with alarm he discovered that his savings had\nmelted away; the few sovereigns remaining must be sternly guarded for\nthe hour of stern necessity. How it ground on his sensibilities when he\nwas compelled to refuse some request from Clara or the girls! His\ngenerous nature suffered pangs of self-contempt as often as there was\ntalk of economy. To-day, for instance, whilst he was worrying in\nthought over Amy's behaviour, and at the same time trying to cut down\nthe Saturday's purchases in order to pay for the broken window, up\ncomes Tom with the announcement that he lost his hat this morning, and\nhad to return bareheaded. Another unforeseen expense! And Sidney was\nangry with himself for his impulse of anger against the boy.\n\nClara never went out to make purchases, seldom indeed left the house\nfor any reason, unless Sidney persuaded her to walk a short distance\nwith him after sundown, when she veiled herself closely. Neither Amy\nnor Anne could be trusted to do all the shopping, so that Sidney\ngenerally accompanied one or other of them for that purpose on Saturday\nafternoon. To-day he asked Amy to go with him, wishing, if possible, to\ninfluence her for good by kind, brotherly talk. Whilst she was getting\nready he took John aside into the parlour, to impart a strange piece of\nnews he had brought from Clerkenwell.\n\n'Mrs. Peckover has had a narrow escape of being poisoned. She was found\nby one of her lodgers all but dead, and last night the police arrested\nher daughter on the charge.'\n\n'Mrs. Snowdon?'\n\n'Yes. The mother has accused her. There's a man concerned in the\naffair. One of the men showed me a report in to-day's paper; I didn't\nbuy one, because we shall have it in the Sunday paper to-morrow. Nice\nbusiness, oh?'\n\n'That's for the old woman's money, I'll wager!' exclaimed Hewett, in an\nawed voice. 'I can believe it of Clem; if ever there was a downright\nbad 'un! Was she living in the Close?'\n\n'Mrs. Snowdon wasn't. Somewhere in Hoxton. No doubt it was for the\nmoney--if the charge is true. We won't speak of it before the children.'\n\n'Think of that, now! Many's the time I've looked at Clem Peckover and\nsaid to myself, \"You'll come to no good end, my lady!\" She was a fierce\nan' bad 'un.'\n\nSidney nodded, and went off for his walk with Amy. . . .\n\nIt was a difficult thing to keep any room in the house orderly, and\nSidney, as part of his struggle against the downward tendency in all\nabout him, against the forces of chaos, often did the work of housemaid\nin the parlour; a little laxity in the rules which made this a sacred\ncorner, and there would have been no spot where he could rest. With\nsome success, too, he had resisted the habit prevalent in working-class\nhomes of prolonging Saturday evening's occupations until the early\nhours of Sunday morning. At a little after ten o'clock tonight John\nHewett and the children were in bed; he too, weary in mind and body,\nwould gladly have gone upstairs, but he lingered from one five minutes\nto the next, his heart sinking at the certainty that he would find\nClara in sleepless misery which he had no power to allay.\n\nRound the walls of the parlour were hung his own drawings, which used\nto conceal the bareness of his lodging in Tysoe Street. It was three\nyears since he had touched a pencil; the last time having been when he\nmade holiday with Michael Snowdon and Jane at the farm-house by Danbury\nHill. The impulse would never come again. It was associated with\nhappiness, with hope; and what had his life to do with one or the\nother? Could he have effected the change without the necessity of\nexplaining it, he would gladly have put those drawings out of sight.\nWhenever, as now, he consciously regarded them, they plucked painfully\nat his heart-strings, and threatened to make him a coward.\n\nNone of that! He had his work to do, happiness or no happiness, and by\nall the virtue of manhood he would not fail in it--as far as success or\nfailure was a question of his own resolve.\n\nThe few books he owned were placed on hanging shelves; among them those\nwhich he had purchased for Clara since their marriage. But reading was\nas much a thing of the past as drawing. Never a moment when his mind\nwas sufficiently at ease to refresh itself with other men's thoughts or\nfancies. As with John Hewett, so with himself; the circle of his\ninterests had shrivelled, until it included nothing but the cares of\nhis family, the cost of house and food and firing. As a younger man, he\nhad believed that he knew what was meant by the struggle for existence\nin the nether world; it seemed to him now as if such knowledge had been\nonly theoretical. Oh, it was easy to preach a high ideal of existence\nfor the poor, as long as one had a considerable margin over the week's\nexpenses; easy to rebuke the men and women who tried to forget\nthemselves in beer-shops and gin-houses, as long as one could take up\nsome rational amusement with a quiet heart. Now, on his return home\nfrom labour, it was all he could do not to sink in exhaustion and\ndefeat of spirit. Shillings and pence; shillings and pence--never a\nquestion of pounds, unfortunately; and always too few of them. He\nunderstood how men have gone mad under pressure of household cares; he\nrealised the horrible temptation which has made men turn dastardly from\nthe path leading homeward and leave those there to shift for themselves.\n\nWhen on the point of lowering the lamp he heard someone coming\ndownstairs. The door opened, and, to his surprise, Clara came in.\nFamiliarity could not make him insensible to that disfigurement of her\nonce beautiful face; his eyes always fell before her at the first\nmoment of meeting.\n\n'What are you doing?' she asked. 'Why don't you come up?'\n\n'I was that minute coming.'\n\nHis hand went again to the lamp, but she checked him. In a low,\nwailing, heart-breaking voice, and with a passionate gesture, she\nexclaimed, 'Oh, I feel as if I should go mad I can't bear it much\nlonger!'\n\nSidney was silent at first, then said quietly, 'Let's sit here for a\nlittle. No wonder you feel low-spirited, lying in that room all day.\nI'd gladly have come and sat with you, but my company only seems to\nirritate you.'\n\n'What good can you do me? You only think I'm making you miserable\nwithout a cause. You won't say it, but that's what you always think;\nand when I feel that, I can't bear to have you near. If only I could\ndie and come to the end of it! How can you tell what I suffer? Oh yes,\nyou speak so calmly--as good as telling me I am unreasonable because I\ncan't do the same. I hate to hear your voice when it's like that! I'd\nrather you raged at me or struck me!'\n\nThe beauty of her form had lost nothing since the evening when he\nvisited her in Farringdon Road Buildings; now, as then, all her\nmovements were full of grace and natural dignity. Whenever strong\nfeeling was active in her, she could not but manifest it in motion\nunlike that of ordinary women. Her hair hung in disorder, though not at\nits full length, massing itself upon her shoulders, shadowing her\nforehead. Half-consumed by the fire that only death would extinguish,\nshe looked the taller for her slenderness. Ah, had the face been\nuntouched!\n\n'You are unjust to me,' Sidney replied, with emotion, but not\nresentfully. 'I can enter into all your sufferings. If I speak calmly,\nit's because I _must_, because I daren't give way. One of us must try\nand be strong, Clara, or else--'\n\nHe turned away.\n\n'Let us leave this house,' she continued, hardly noticing what he said,\n'Let us live in some other place. Never any change--always, always the\nsame walls to look at day and night--it's driving me mad!'\n\n'Clara, we can't move. I daren't spend even the little money it would\ncost. Do you know what Amy has been doing?'\n\n'Yes; father told me.'\n\n'How can we go to the least needless expense, when every day makes\nliving harder for us?'\n\n'What have we to do with them? How can you be expected to keep a whole\nfamily? It isn't fair to you or to me. You sacrifice me to them. It's\nnothing to you what I endure, so long as they are kept in comfort!'\n\nHe stepped nearer to her.\n\n'What do you really mean by that? Is it seriously your wish that I\nshould tell them--your father and your sisters and our brother--to\nleave the house and support themselves as best they can? Pray, what\nwould become of them? Kept in comfort, are they? How much _comfort_\ndoes your poor father enjoy? Do you wish me to tell him to go out into\nthe street, as I can help him no more?'\n\nShe moaned and made a wild gesture.\n\n'You know all this to be impossible; you don't wish it; you couldn't\nbear it. Then why will you drive me almost to despair by complaining so\nof what can't be helped? Surely you foresaw it all. You knew that I was\nonly a working man. It isn't as if there had been any hope of my making\na larger income, and you were disappointed.'\n\n'Does it make it easier to bear because there is no hope of relief?'\nshe cried.\n\n'For me, yes. If there _were_ hope, I might fret under the misery.'\n\n'Oh, I had hope once! It might have been so different with me. The\nthought burns and burns and burns, till I am frantic. You don't help me\nto bear it. You leave me alone when I most need help. How can _you_\nknow what it means to me to look back and think of what might have\nbeen? You say to yourself I am selfish, that I ought to be thankful\nsome-one took pity on me, poor, wretched creature that I am. It would\nhave been kinder never to have come near me. I should have killed\nmyself long ago, and there an end. You thought it was a great thing to\ntake me, when you might have had a wife who would--'\n\n'Clara! Clara! When you speak like that, I could almost believe you are\nreally mad. For Heaven's sake, think what you are saying! Suppose I\nwere to reproach you with having consented to marry me? I would rather\ndie than let such a word pass my lips--but suppose you heard me\nspeaking to you like this?'\n\nShe drew a deep sigh, and let her hands fall. Sidney continued in quite\nanother voice:\n\n'It's one of the hardest things I have to bear, that I can't make your\nlife pleasanter. Of course you need change; I know it only too well.\nYou and I ought to have our holiday at this time of the year, like\nother people. I fancy I should like to go into the country myself;\nClerkenwell isn't such a beautiful place that one can be content to go\nthere day after day, year after year, without variety. But we have no\nmoney. Suffer as we may, there's no help for it--because we have no\nmoney. Lives may be wasted--worse, far worse than wasted--just because\nthere is no money. At this moment a whole world of men and women is in\npain and sorrow--because they have no money. How often have we said\nthat? The world is made so; everything has to be bought with money.'\n\n'You find it easier to bear than I do.'\n\n'Yes; I find it easier. I am stronger-bodied, and at all events I have\nsome variety, whilst you have none. I know it. If I could take your\nshare of the burden, how gladly I'd do so! If I could take your\nsuffering upon myself, you shouldn't be unhappy for another minute. But\nthat is another impossible thing. People who are fortunate in life may\nask each day what they _can_ do; we have always to remind ourselves\nwhat we _can't_.'\n\n'You take a pleasure in repeating such things; it shows how little you\nfeel them.'\n\n'It shows how I have taken to heart the truth of them.'\n\nShe waved her hand impatiently, again sighed, and moved towards the\ndoor.\n\n'Don't go just yet,' said Sidney. 'We have more to say to each other.'\n\n'I have nothing more to say. I am miserable, and you can't help me.'\n\n'I can, Clara.'\n\nShe looked at him with wondering, estranged eyes. 'How? What are you\ngoing to do?'\n\n'Only speak to you, that's all. I have nothing to give but words. But--'\n\nShe would have left him. Sidney stepped forward and prevented her.\n\n'No; you _must_ hear what I have got to say. They may be only words,\nbut if I have no power to move you with my words, then our life has\ncome to utter ruin, and I don't know what dreadful things lie before\nus.'\n\n'I can say the same,' she replied, in a despairing tone.\n\n'But neither you nor I shall say it! As long as I have strength to\nspeak, I won't consent to say that Clara, you must put your hand in\nmine, and think of your life and mine as one. If not for my sake, then\nfor your child's. Think; do you wish May to suffer for the faults of\nher parents?'\n\n'I wish she had never been born!'\n\n'And yet you were the happier for her birth. It's only these last six\nmonths that you have fallen again into misery. You indulge it, and it\ngrows worse, harder to resist. You may say that life seems to grow\nworse. Perhaps so. This affair of Amy's has been a heavy blow, and we\nshall miss the little money she brought; goodness knows when another\nplace will be found for her. But all the more reason why we should help\neach other to struggle. Perhaps just this year or two will be our\nhardest time. If Amy and Annie and Tom were once all earning something,\nthe worst would be over--wouldn't it? And can't we find strength to\nhold out a little longer, just to give the children a start in life,\njust to make your father's last years a bit happier? If we manage it,\nshan't we feel glad in looking back? Won't it be something worth having\nlived for?'\n\nHe paused, but Clara had no word for him.\n\n'There's Amy. She's a hard girl to manage, partly because she has very\nbad health. I always think of that--or try to--when she irritates me.\nThis afternoon I took her out with me, and spoke as kindly as I could;\nif she isn't better for it, she surely can't be worse, and in any case\nI don't know what else to do. Look, Clara, you and I are going to do\nwhat we can for these children; we're not going to give up the work now\nwe've begun it. Mustn't all of us who are poor stand together and help\none another? We have to fight against the rich world that's always\ncrushing us down, down--whether it means to or not. Those people enjoy\ntheir lives. Well, I shall find _my_ enjoyment in defying them to make\nme despair? But I can't do without your help. I didn't feel very\ncheerful as I sat here a while ago, before you came down; I was almost\nafraid to go upstairs, lest the sight of what you were suffering should\nbe too much for me. Am I to ask a kindness of you and be refused,\nClara?'\n\nIt was not the first time that she had experienced the constraining\npower of his words when he was moved with passionate earnestness. Her\ndesire to escape was due to a fear of yielding, of suffering her\negotism to fail before a stronger will.\n\n'Let me go,' she said, whilst he held her arm. 'I feel too ill to talk\nlonger.'\n\n'Only one word--only one promise--now whilst we are the only ones awake\nin the house. We are husband and wife, Clara, and we must be kind to\neach other. We are not going to be like the poor creatures who let\ntheir misery degrade them. We are both too proud for that--what? We can\nthink and express our thoughts; we can speak to each other's minds and\nhearts. Don't let us be beaten!'\n\n'What's the good of my promising? I can't keep it. I suffer too much.'\n\n'Promise, and keep the promise for a few weeks, a few days; then I'll\nfind strength to help you once more. But now it's your turn to help me.\nTo-morrow begins a new week; the rich world allows us to rest\nto-morrow, to be with each other. Shall we make it a quiet, restful,\nhopeful day? When they go out in the morning, you shall read to father\nand me--read as you know how to, so much better than I can. What? Was\nthat really a smile?'\n\n'Let me go, Sidney. Oh, I'm tired, I'm tired!'\n\n'And the promise?'\n\n'I'll do my best. It won't last long, but I'll try.'\n\n'Thank you, dear.'\n\n'No,' she replied, despondently. 'It's I that ought to thank you. But I\nnever shall--never. I only understand you now and then--just for an\nhour--and all the selfishness comes back again. It'll be the same till\nI'm dead.'\n\nHe put out the lamp and followed her upstairs. His limbs ached; he\ncould scarcely drag one leg after the other. Never mind; the battle was\ngained once more.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\nJANE\n\n'The poisoning business startled me. I shouldn't at all wonder if I had\na precious narrow squeak of something of the kind myself before I took\nmy departure; in fact, a sort of fear of the animal made me settle\nthings as sharp as I could. Let me know the result of the trial. Wonder\nwhether there'll be any disagreeable remarks about a certain\nacquaintance of yours, detained abroad on business? Better send me\nnewspapers--same name and address. . . . But I've something\nconsiderably more important to think about. . . . A big thing; I\nscarcely dare tell you how big. I stand to win $2,000,000! . . . Not a\nsoul outside suspects the ring. When I tell you that R.S.N. is in it,\nyou'll see that I've struck the right ticket this time. . . . Let me\nhear about Jane. If all goes well here, and you manage that little\nbusiness, you shall have $100,000, just for house-furnishing, you know.\nI suppose you'll have your partnership in a few months?'\n\nExtracts from a letter, with an American stamp, which Mr. Scawthorne\nread as he waited for his breakfast. It was the end of October, and\ncool enough to make the crackling fire grateful. Having mused over the\nepistle, our friend took up his morning paper and glanced at the report\nof criminal trials. Whilst he was so engaged his landlady entered,\ncarrying a tray of appetising appearance.\n\n'Good-morning, Mrs. Byass,' he said, with much friendliness. Then, in a\nlower voice, 'There's a fuller report here than there was in the\nevening paper. Perhaps you looked at it?'\n\n'Well, yes, sir; I thought you wouldn't mind,' replied Bessie,\narranging the table.\n\n'She'll be taken care of or three years, at all events.'\n\n'If you'd seen her that day she came here after Miss Snowdon, you'd\nunderstand how glad I feel that she's out of the way. I'm sure I've\nbeen uneasy ever since. If ever there comes a rather loud knock\nat--there I begin to tremble; I do indeed. I don't think I shall ever\nget over it.'\n\n'I dare say Miss Snowdon will be easier in mind?'\n\n'I shouldn't wonder. But she won't say anything about it. She feels the\ndisgrace so much, and I know it's almost more than she can do to go to\nwork, just because she thinks they talk about her.'\n\n'Oh, that'll very soon pass over. There's always something new\nhappening, and people quickly forget a case like this.'\n\nBessie withdrew, and her lodger addressed himself to his breakfast.\n\nHe had occupied the rooms on the first floor for about a year and a\nhalf. Joseph Snowdon's proposal to make him acquainted with Jane had\nnot been carried out, Scawthorne deeming it impracticable; but when a\nyear had gone by, and Scawthorne, as Joseph's confidential\ncorrespondent, had still to report that Jane maintained herself in\nindependence, he one day presented himself in Hanover Street, as a\ntotal stranger, and made inquiry about the rooms which a card told him\nwere to let. His improved position allowed him to live somewhat more\nreputably than in the Chelsea lodging, and Hanover Street would suit\nhim well enough until he obtained the promised partnership. Admitted as\na friend to Mr. Percival's house in Highbury, he had by this time made\nthe acquaintance of Miss Lant, whom, by the exercise of his agreeable\nqualities, he one day led to speak of Jane Snowdon. Miss Lant continued\nto see Jane, at long intervals, and was fervent in her praise as well\nas in compassionating the trials through which she had gone. His\nposition in Mr. Percival's office of course made it natural that\nScawthorne should have a knowledge of the girl's story. When he had\nestablished himself in Mrs. Byass's rooms, he mentioned the fact\ncasually to his friends, making it appear that, in seeking lodgings, he\nhad come upon these by haphazard.\n\nHe could not but feel something of genuine interest in a girl who, for\nwhatever reason, declined a sufficient allowance and chose to work for\nher living. The grounds upon which Jane took this decision were\naltogether unknown to him until an explanation came from her father.\nJoseph, when news of the matter reached him, was disposed to entertain\nsuspicions; with every care not to betray his own whereabouts, he wrote\nto Jane, and in due time received a reply, in which Jane told him truly\nher reasons for refusing the money. These Joseph communicated to\nScawthorne, and the latter's interest was still more strongly awakened.\n\nHe was now on terms of personal acquaintance, almost of friendship,\nwith Jane. Miss Lant, he was convinced, did not speak of her too\npraisingly. Not exactly a pretty girl, though far from displeasing in\ncountenance; very quiet, very gentle, with much natural refinement. Her\nair of sadness--by no means forced upon the vulgar eye, but\nunmistakable when you studied her--was indicative of faithful\nsensibilities. Scawthorne had altogether lost sight of Sidney Kirkwood\nand of the Hewetts; he knew they were all gone to a remote part of\nLondon, and more than this he had no longer any care to discover. On\nexcellent terms with his landlady, he skilfully elicited from her now\nand then a confidential remark with regard to Jane; of late, indeed, he\nhad established something like a sentimental understanding with the\ngood Bessie, so that, whenever he mentioned Jane, she fell into a\npleasant little flutter, feeling that she understood what was in\nprogress. . . . Why not?--he kept asking himself. Joseph Snowdon (who\naddressed his letters to Hanover Street in a feigned hand) seemed to\nhave an undeniable affection for the girl, and was constant in his\npromises of providing a handsome dowry. The latter was not a point of\nsuch importance as a few years ago, but the dollars would be\nacceptable. And then, the truth was, Scawthorne felt himself more and\nmore inclined to put a certain question to Jane, dowry or none.\n\nYes, she felt it as a disgrace, poor girl! When she saw the name\n'Snowdon' in the newspaper, in such a shameful and horrible connection,\nher impulse was to flee, to hide herself. It was dreadful to go to her\nwork and hear the girls talking of this attempted murder. The new\nmisery came upon her just as she was regaining something of her natural\nspirits, after long sorrow and depression which had affected her\nhealth. But circumstances, now as ever, seemed to plot that at a\ncritical moment of her own experience she should be called out of\nherself and constrained to become the consoler of others.\n\nFor some months the domestic peace of Mr. and Mrs. Byass had been\ngravely disturbed. Unlike the household at Crouch End, it was to\nprosperity that Sam and his wife owed their troubles. Year after year\nSam's position had improved; he was now in receipt of a salary which\nmade--or ought to have made--things at home very comfortable. Though\nhis children were now four in number, he could supply their wants. He\ncould buy Bessie a new gown without very grave consideration, and could\nregard his own shiny top-hat, when he donned it in the place of one\nthat was really respectable enough, without twinges of conscience.\n\nBut Sam was not remarkable for wisdom; indeed, had he been anything\nmore than a foolish calculating-machine, he would scarcely have thriven\nas he did in the City. When he had grown accustomed to rattling loose\nsilver in his pocket, the next thing, as a matter of course, was that\nhe accustomed himself to pay far too frequent visits to City bars. On\ncertain days in the week he invariably came home with a very red face\nand a titubating walk; when Bessie received him angrily, he defended\nhimself on the great plea of business necessities. As a town traveller\nthere was no possibility, he alleged, of declining invitations to\nrefresh himself; just as incumbent upon him was it to extend casual\nhospitality to those with whom he had business.\n\n'Business! Fiddle!' cried Bessie. 'All you City fellows are the same.\nYou encourage each other in drink, drink, drinking whenever you have a\nchance, and then you say it's all a matter of business. I won't have\nyou coming home in that state, so there! I won't have a husband as\ndrinks! Why, you can't stand straight.'\n\n'Can't stand straight!' echoed Sam, with vast scorn. 'Look here!'\n\nAnd he shouldered the poker, with the result that one of the globes on\nthe chandelier came in shivers about his head. This was too much.\nBessie fumed, and for a couple of hours the quarrel was unappeasable.\n\nWorse was to come. Sam occasionally stayed out very late at night, and\non his return alleged a 'business appointment.' Bessie at length\nrefused to accept these excuses; she couldn't and wouldn't believe them.\n\n'Then don't!' shouted Sam. 'And understand that I shall come home just\nwhen I like. If you make a bother I won't come home at all, so there\nyou have it!'\n\n'You're a bad husband and a beast!' was Bessie's retort.\n\nShortly after that Bessie received information of such grave misconduct\non her husband's part that she all but resolved to forsake the house,\nand with the children seek refuge under her parents' roof at Woolwich.\nSam had been seen in indescribable company; no permissible words would\ncharacterise the individuals with whom he had roamed shamelessly on the\npavement of Oxford Street. When he next met her, quite sober and with\nexasperatingly innocent expression, Bessie refused to open her lips.\nNeither that evening nor the next would she utter a word to him--and\nthe effort it cost her was tremendous. The result was, that on the\nthird evening Sam did not appear.\n\nIt was a week after Clem's trial. Jane had been keeping to herself as\nmuch as possible, but, having occasion to go down into the kitchen late\nat night, she found Bessie in tears, utterly miserable.\n\n'Don't bother about me!' was the reply to her sympathetic question.\n'You've got your own upsets to think of. You might have come to speak\nto me before this--but never mind. It's nothing to you.'\n\nIt needed much coaxing to persuade her to detail Sam's enormities, but\nshe found much relief when she had done so, and wept more copiously\nthan ever.\n\n'It's nearly twelve o'clock, and there's no sign of him, Perhaps he\nwon't come at all. He's in bad company, and if he stays away all night\nI'll never speak to him again as long as I live. Oh, he's a beast of a\nhusband, is Sam!'\n\nSam came not. All through that night did Jane keep her friend company,\nfor Sam came not. In the morning a letter, addressed in his well-known\ncommercial hand. Bessie read it and screamed. Sam wrote to her that he\nhad accepted a position as country traveller, and _perhaps_ he might be\nable to look in at his home on that day month.\n\nJane could not go to work. The case had become very serious indeed;\nBessie was in hysterics; the four children made the roof ring with\ntheir lamentations. At this juncture Jane put forth all her beneficent\nenergy. It happened that Bessie was just now servantless. There was Mr.\nScawthorne's breakfast only half prepared; Jane had to see to it\nherself, and herself take it upstairs. Then Bessie must go to bed, or\nassuredly she would be so ill that unheard-of calamities would befall\nthe infants. Jane would have an eye to everything; only let Jane be\ntrusted.\n\nThe miserable day passed; after trying in vain to sleep, Bessie walked\nabout her sitting-room with tear-swollen face and rumpled gown, always\nthinking it possible that Sam had only played a trick, and that he\nwould come. But he came not, and again it was night.\n\nAt eight o'clock Mr. Scawthorne's bell rang. Impossible for Bessie to\npresent herself; Jane would go. She ascended to the room which had\nonce--ah! once!--been her own parlour, knocked and entered.\n\n'I--I wished to speak to Mrs. Byass,' said Scawthorne, appearing for\nsome reason or other embarrassed by Jane's presenting herself.\n\n'Mrs. Byass is not at all well, sir. But I'll let her know--'\n\n'No, no; on no account.'\n\n'Can't I get you anything, sir?'\n\n'Miss Snowdon--might I speak with you for a few moments?'\n\nJane feared it might be a complaint. In a perfectly natural way she\nwalked forward. Scawthorne came in her direction, and--closed the door.\n\nThe interview lasted ten minutes, then Jane came forth and with a\nlight, quick step ran up to the floor above. She did not enter the\nroom, however, but stood with her hand on the door, in the darkness. A\nminute or two, and with the same light, hurried step, she descended the\nstairs, sprang past the lodger's room, sped down to the kitchen. Under\nother circumstances Bessie must surely have noticed a strangeness in\nher look, in her manner; but to-night Bessie had thought for nothing\nbut her own calamities.\n\nAnother day, and no further news from Sam. The next morning, instead of\ngoing to work (the loss of wages was most serious, but it couldn't be\nhelped), Jane privately betook herself to Sam's house of business. Mrs.\nByass was ill; would they let her know Mr. Byass's address, that he\nmight immediately be communicated with? The information was readily\nsupplied; Mr. Byass was no farther away, at present, than St. Albans.\nForth into the street again, and in search of a policeman. 'Will you\nplease to tell me what station I have to go to for St. Albans?' Why,\nMoorgate Street would do; only a few minutes' walk away. On she\nhastened. 'What is the cost of a return ticket to St. Albans, please?'\nThree-and-sevenpence. Back into the street again; she must now look for\na certain sign, indicating a certain place of business. With some\nlittle trouble it is found; she enters a dark passage, and comes before\na counter, upon which she lays--a watch, her grandfather's old watch.\n'How much?' 'Four shillings, please.' She deposits a halfpenny, and\nreceives four shillings, together with a ticket. Now for St. Albans.\n\nSam! Sam! Ay, well might he turn red and stutter and look generally\nfoolish when that quiet little girl stood before him in his\n'stock-room' at the hotel. Her words were as quiet as her look. 'I'll\nwrite her a letter,' he cries. 'Stop; you shall take it back. I can't\ngive up the job at once, but you may tell her I'm up to no harm.\nWhere's the pen? Where's the cursed ink?' And she takes the letter.\n\n'Why, you've lost a day's work, Jane! She gave you the money for the\njourney, I suppose?'\n\n'Yes, yes, of course.'\n\n'Tell her she's not to make a fool of herself in future.'\n\n'No, I shan't say that, Mr. Byass. But I'm half-tempted to say it to\nsomeone else!'\n\nIt was the old, happy smile, come back for a moment; the voice that had\noften made peace so merrily. The return journey seemed short, and with\nglad heart-beating she hastened from the City to Hanover Street.\n\nWell, well; of course it would all begin over again; Jane herself knew\nit. But is not all life a struggle onward from compromise to\ncompromise, until the day of final pacification?\n\nThrough that winter she lived with a strange secret in her mind, a\nsecret which was the source of singularly varied feelings--of\nastonishment, of pain, of encouragement, of apprehension, of grief. To\nno one could she speak of it; no one could divine its existence--no one\nsave the person to whom she owed this surprising novelty in her\nexperience. She would have given much to be rid of it; and yet, again,\nmight she not legitimately accept that pleasure which at times came of\nthe thought?--the thought that, as a woman, her qualities were of some\naccount in the world.\n\nShe did her best to keep it out of her consciousness, and in truth had\nso many other things to think about that it was seldom she really had\ntrouble with it. Life was not altogether easy; regular work was not\nalways to be kept; there was much need of planning and pinching, that\nher independence might suffer no wound, Bessie Byass was always in arms\nagainst that same independent spirit; she scoffed at it, assailed it\nwith treacherous blandishment, made direct attacks upon it.\n\n'I must live in my own way, Mrs. Byass. I don't want to have to leave\nyou.'\n\nAnd if ever life seemed a little too hard, if the image of the past\ngrew too mournfully persistent, she knew where to go for consolation.\nLet us follow her, one Saturday afternoon early in the year.\n\nIn a poor street in Clerkenwell was a certain poor little shop--built\nout as an afterthought from an irregular lump of houses; a shop with a\nroom behind it and a cellar below; no more. Here was sold second-hand\nclothing, women's and children's. No name over the front, but\nneighbours would have told you that it was kept by one Mrs. Todd, a\nyoung widow with several children. Mrs. Todd, not long ago, used to\nhave only a stall in the street; but a lady named Miss Lant helped her\nto start in a more regular way of business.\n\n'And does she carry it on quite by herself?'\n\nNo; with her lived another young woman, also a widow, who had one\nchild. Mrs. Hewett, her name. She did sewing in the room behind, or\nattended to the shop when Mrs. Todd was away making purchases.\n\nThere Jane Snowdon entered. The clothing that hung in the window made\nit very dark inside; she had to peer a little before she could\ndistinguish the person who sat behind the counter. 'Is Pennyloaf in,\nMrs. Todd?'\n\n'Yes, Miss. Will you walk through?'\n\nThe room behind is lighted from the ceiling. It is heaped with the most\nmiscellaneous clothing. It contains two beds, some shelves with\ncrockery, a table, some chairs--but it would have taken you a long time\nto note all these details, so huddled together was everything. Part of\nthe general huddling were five children, of various ages; and among\nthem, very busy, sat Pennyloaf.\n\n'Everything going on well?' was Jane's first question.\n\n'Yes, Miss.'\n\n'Then I know it isn't. Whenever you call me \"Miss,\" there's something\nwrong; I've learnt that.'\n\nPennyloaf smiled, sadly but with affection in her eyes. 'Well, I have\nbeen a bit low, an' that's the truth. It takes me sometimes, you know.\nI've been thinkin', when I'd oughtn't.'\n\n'Same with me, Pennyloaf. We can't help thinking, can we? What a good\nthing if we'd nothing more to think about than these children! Where's\nlittle Bob? Why, Bob, I thought you were old clothes; I did, really!\nYou may well laugh!'\n\nThe laughter was merry, and Jane encouraged it, inventing all sorts of\nfoolish jokes. 'Pennyloaf, I wish you'd ask me to stay to tea.'\n\n'Then that I will, Miss Jane, an' gladly. Would you like it soon?'\n\n'No; in an hour will do, won't it? Give me something that wants sewing,\na really hard bit, something that'll break needles. Yes, that'll do.\nWhere's Mrs. Todd's thimble? Now we're all going to be comfortable, and\nwe'll have a good talk.'\n\nPennyloaf found the dark thoughts slip away insensibly. And she talked,\nshe talked--where was there such a talker as Pennyloaf nowadays, when\nshe once began?\n\nMr. Byass was not very willing, after all, to give up his country\ntravelling. That his departure on that business befell at a moment of\ndomestic quarrel was merely chance; secretly he had made the\narrangement with his firm some weeks before. The penitence which\naffected him upon Jane's appeal could not be of abiding result; for,\nlike all married men at a certain point of their lives, he felt\nheartily tired of home and wished to see the world a little. Hanover\nStreet heard endless discussions of the point between Sam and Bessie,\nbetween Bessie and Jane, between Jane and Sam, between all three\ntogether. And the upshot was that Mr. Byass gained his point. For a\ntime he would go on country journeys. Bessie assented sullenly, but,\nstrange to say, she had never been in better spirits than on the day\nafter this decision had been arrived at.\n\nOn that day, however--it was early in March--an annoying incident\nhappened. Mr. Scawthorne, who always dined in town and seldom returned\nto his lodgings till late in the evening, rang his bell about eight\no'clock and sent a message by the servant that he wished to see Mrs.\nByass. Bessie having come up, he announced to her with gravity that his\ntenancy of the rooms would be at an end in a fortnight. Various\nconsiderations necessitated his livin in a different part of London.\nBessie frankly lamented; she would never again find such an estimable\nlodger. But, to be sure, Mr. Scawthorne had prepared her for this,\nthree months ago. Well, what must be, must be.\n\n'Is Miss Snowdon in the house, Mrs. Byass?' Scawthorne went on to\ninquire.\n\n'Miss Snowdon? Yes.'\n\n'This letter from America, which I found on coming in, contains news\nshe must hear--disagreeable news, I'm sorry to say.'\n\n'About her father?' Bessie inquired anxiously.\n\nScawthorne nodded a grave and confidential affirmative. He had never\ngiven Mrs. Byass reason to suppose that he knew anything of Joseph's\nwhereabouts, but Bessie's thoughts naturally turned in that direction.\n\n'The news comes to me by chance,' he continued. 'I think I ought to\ncommunicate it to Miss Snowdon privately, and leave her to let you know\nwhat it is, as doubtless she will. Would it be inconvenient to you to\nlet me have the use of your parlour for five minutes?'\n\n'I'll go and light the gas at once, and tell Miss Snowdon.'\n\n'Thank you, Mrs. Byass.'\n\nHe was nervous, a most unusual thing with him. Till Bessie's return he\np aced the room irregularly, chewing the ends of his moustache. When it\nwas announced to him that the parlour was ready he went down, the\nletter in his hand. At the half-open door came a soft knock. Jane\nentered.\n\nShe showed signs of painful agitation.\n\n'Will you sit down, Miss Snowdon? It happens that I have a\ncorrespondent in the United States, who has lately had--had business\nrelations with Mr. Joseph Snowdon, your father. On returning this\nevening I found a letter from my friend, in which there is news of a\ndistressing kind.'\n\nHe paused. What he was about to say was--for once--the truth. The\nletter, however, came from a stranger, a lawyer in Chicago.\n\n'Your father, I understand, has lately been engaged in--in commercial\nspeculation on a great scale. His enterprises have proved unfortunate.\nOne of those financial crashes which are common in America caused his\ntotal ruin.'\n\nJane drew a deep breath.\n\n'I am sorry to say that is not all. The excitement of the days when his\nfate was hanging in the balance led to illness--fatal illness. He died\non the sixth of February.'\n\nJane, with her eyes bent down, was motionless. After a pause,\nScawthorne continued:\n\n'I will speak of this with Mr. Percival to-morrow, and every inquiry\nshall be made--on your behalf.'\n\n'Thank you, sir.'\n\nShe rose, very pale, but with more self-command than on entering the\nroom. The latter part of his communication seemed to have affected her\nas a relief.\n\n'Miss Snowdon--if you would allow me to say a few more words. You will\nremember I mentioned to you that there was a prospect of my becoming a\npartner in the firm which I have hitherto served as clerk. A certain\nexamination had to be passed that I might be admitted a solicitor. That\nis over; in a few days my position as a member of the firm will be\nassured.'\n\nJane waited, her eyes still cast down.\n\n'I feel that it may seem to you an ill-chosen time; but the very fact\nthat I have just been the bearer of such sad news impels me to speak. I\ncannot keep the promise that I would never revive the subject on which\nI spoke to you not long ago. Forgive me; I _must_ ask you again if you\ncannot think of me as I wish? Miss Snowdon, will you let me devote\nmyself to making your life happy? It has always seemed to me that if I\ncould attain a position such as I now have, there would be little else\nto ask for. I began life poor and half-educated, and you cannot imagine\nthe difficulties I have overcome. But if I go away from this house, and\nleave you so lonely, living such a hard life, there will be very little\nsatisfaction for me in my success. Let me try to make for you a\nhappiness such as you merit. It may seem as if we were very slightly\nacquainted, but I know you well enough to esteem you more highly than\nany women I ever met, and if you could but think of me--'\n\nHe was sincere. Jane had brought out the best in him. With the death of\nSnowdon all his disreputable past seemed swept away, and he had no\nthought of anything but a decent rectitude, a cleanly enjoyment of\nexistence, for the future, but Jane was answering:\n\n'I can't change what I said before, Mr. Scawthorne. I am very content\nto live as I do now. I have friends I am very fond of. Thank you for\nyour kindness--but I can't change.'\n\nWithout intending it, she ceased upon a word which to her hearer\nconveyed a twofold meaning. He understood; offer what he might, it\ncould not tempt her to forget the love which had been the best part of\nher life. She was faithful to the past, and unchanging.\n\nMrs. Byass never suspected the second purpose for which her lodger had\ndesired to speak with Jane this evening. Scawthorne in due time took\nhis departure, with many expressions of goodwill, many assurances that\nnothing could please him better than to be of service to Bessie and her\nhusband.\n\n'He wished me to say good-bye to you for him,' said Bessie, when Jane\ncame back from her work.\n\nSo the romance in her life was over. Michael Snowdon's wealth had\nmelted away; with it was gone for ever the hope of realising his high\nprojects. All passed into the world of memory, of dream--all save the\nspirit which had ennobled him, the generous purpose bequeathed to those\ntwo hearts, which had loved him best.\n\nTo his memory all days were sacred; but one, that of his burial, marked\nitself for Jane as the point in each year to which her life was\ndirected, the saddest, yet bringing with it her supreme solace.\n\nA day in early spring, cloudy, cold. She left the workroom in the\ndinner-hour, and did not return. But instead of going to Hanover\nStreet, she walked past Islington Green, all along Essex Road,\nnorthward thence to Stoke Newington, and so came to Abney Park\nCemetery; a long way, but it did not weary her.\n\nIn the cemetery she turned her steps to a grave with a plain headstone.\nBefore leaving England, Joseph Snowdon had discharged this duty. The\ninscription was simply a name, with dates of birth looked at himand death.\n\nAnd, as she stood there, other footsteps approached the spot. She\nlooked up, with no surprise, and gave her hand for a moment. On the\nfirst anniversary the meeting had been unanticipated; the same thought\nled her and Sidney to the cemetery at the same hour. This was the third\nyear, and they met as if by understanding, though neither had spoken of\nit.\n\nWhen they had stood in silence for a while, Jane told of her father's\ndeath and its circumstances. She told him, too, of Pennyloaf's humble\nsecurity.\n\n'You have kept well all the year?' he asked.\n\n'And you too, I hope?'\n\nThen they bade each other good-bye. . . .\n\nIn each life little for congratulation. He with the ambitions of his\nyouth frustrated; neither an artist, nor a leader of men in the battle\nfor justice. She, no saviour of society by the force of a superb\nexample; no daughter of the people, holding wealth in trust for the\npeople's needs. Yet to both was their work given. Unmarked,\nunencouraged save by their love of uprightness and mercy, they stood by\nthe side of those more hapless, brought some comfort to hearts less\ncourageous than their own. Where they abode it was not all dark. Sorrow\ncertainly awaited them, perchance defeat in even the humble aims that\nthey had set themselves; but at least their lives would remain a\nprotest against those brute forces of society which fill with wreck the\nabysses of the nether world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Nether World, by George Gissing\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE NETHER WORLD ***\n\n***** This file should be named 4301.txt or 4301.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/4\/3\/0\/4301\/\n\nProduced by Charles Aldarondo.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":517,"split":"train"}
