{"ori_id":"ab35e5d3266a05297db471612ce06095c5190649","title":"Modeste Mignon","context":"Modeste Mignon\n The first part of Modeste Mignon is based on a traditional species of folktale known as La fille mal gard\u00e9e (\"The Ill-Watched Girl\"), in which a young woman takes a lover despite the close attentions of her guardians, who are determined to preserve her chastity for a more suitable match. Modeste Mignon, a young provincial woman of romantic temperament, imagines herself to be in love with the famous Parisian poet Melchior de Canalis, whose works have filled her with passion. She corresponds with him, but he is unmoved by her attentions. Canalis invites his secretary Ernest de la Bri\u00e8re to deal with the matter. Ernest replies to Modeste in Canalis' name; a dangerous intrigue ensues, which sees Ernest appear in Modeste's home town of Ingouville (near Le Havre) disguised as Canalis. The plot is complicated by the interference of Modeste's family and friends, who suspect that she has secretly taken a lover. The wily dwarf Butscha, who loves Modeste as a medieval knight might have loved a lady far above his station, is determined to unmask the man. Things come to a head when Ernest discovers that Modeste's father Charles Mignon has returned from his long exile a very wealthy man: Modeste is no longer a poor provincial girl but a rich heiress with six million francs to her name. Ernest reveals his true identity, but Modeste feels humiliated and casts him off. When Modeste's true worth becomes generally known, Canalis takes a renewed interest in her and believes that his poetic ardour will enable him to win her heart. But his secretary is no longer his only rival: a local wealthy potentate the Duc d'H\u00e9rouville now regards the nouveau-riche Modeste Mignon as a suitable match and throws his hat into the ring.\nThe second part of the novel is also based on a traditional story-type, The Rival Suitors. Ernest, Canalis and the Duc d'H\u00e9rouville are invited to Ingouville to compete for the hand of Modeste. Still smarting from the trick played on her by Ernest, Modeste is determined to choose between the passionate advances of the poet and the prospect of becoming a duchess should she accept H\u00e9rouville. Butscha, however, who realizes that Ernest is the one who truly loves her, is equally determined to expose the pretensions of Canalis and promote Ernest's suit. Thanks to Butscha's intrigues and her father's good sense, Modeste chooses Ernest and the two are married.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Modeste Mignon, by Honore de Balzac\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

THE CHALET\n\n\nAt the beginning of October, 1829, Monsieur Simon Babylas Latournelle,\nnotary, was walking up from Havre to Ingouville, arm in arm with his\nson and accompanied by his wife, at whose side the head clerk of the\nlawyer's office, a little hunchback named Jean Butscha, trotted along\nlike a page. When these four personages (two of whom came the same way\nevery evening) reached the elbow of the road where it turns back upon\nitself like those called in Italy \"cornice,\" the notary looked about to\nsee if any one could overhear him either from the terrace above or\nthe path beneath, and when he spoke he lowered his voice as a further\nprecaution.\n\n\"Exupere,\" he said to his son, \"you must try to carry out intelligently\na little manoeuvre which I shall explain to you, but you are not to ask\nthe meaning of it; and if you guess the meaning I command you to toss\nit into that Styx which every lawyer and every man who expects to have\na hand in the government of his country is bound to keep within him for\nthe secrets of others. After you have paid your respects and compliments\nto Madame and Mademoiselle Mignon, to Monsieur and Madame Dumay, and\nto Monsieur Gobenheim if he is at the Chalet, and as soon as quiet\nis restored, Monsieur Dumay will take you aside; you are then to look\nattentively at Mademoiselle Modeste (yes, I am willing to allow it)\nduring the whole time he is speaking to you. My worthy friend will ask\nyou to go out and take a walk; at the end of an hour, that is, about\nnine o'clock, you are to come back in a great hurry; try to puff as if\nyou were out of breath, and whisper in Monsieur Dumay's ear, quite low,\nbut so that Mademoiselle Modeste is sure to overhear you, these words:\n'The young man has come.'\"\n\nExupere was to start the next morning for Paris to begin the study of\nlaw. This impending departure had induced Latournelle to propose him\nto his friend Dumay as an accomplice in the important conspiracy which\nthese directions indicate.\n\n\"Is Mademoiselle Modeste suspected of having a lover?\" asked Butscha in\na timid voice of Madame Latournelle.\n\n\"Hush, Butscha,\" she replied, taking her husband's arm.\n\nMadame Latournelle, the daughter of a clerk of the supreme court,\nfeels that her birth authorizes her to claim issue from a parliamentary\nfamily. This conviction explains why the lady, who is somewhat blotched\nas to complexion, endeavors to assume in her own person the majesty of\na court whose decrees are recorded in her father's pothooks. She\ntakes snuff, holds herself as stiff as a ramrod, poses for a person\nof consideration, and resembles nothing so much as a mummy brought\nmomentarily to life by galvanism. She tries to give high-bred tones to\nher sharp voice, and succeeds no better in doing that than in hiding\nher general lack of breeding. Her social usefulness seems, however,\nincontestable when we glance at the flower-bedecked cap she wears,\nat the false front frizzling around her forehead, at the gowns of her\nchoice; for how could shopkeepers dispose of those products if there\nwere no Madame Latournelle? All these absurdities of the worthy woman,\nwho is truly pious and charitable, might have passed unnoticed, if\nnature, amusing herself as she often does by turning out these ludicrous\ncreations, had not endowed her with the height of a drum-major, and thus\nheld up to view the comicalities of her provincial nature. She has\nnever been out of Havre; she believes in the infallibility of Havre; she\nproclaims herself Norman to the very tips of her fingers; she venerates\nher father, and adores her husband.\n\nLittle Latournelle was bold enough to marry this lady after she had\nattained the anti-matrimonial age of thirty-three, and what is more, he\nhad a son by her. As he could have got the sixty thousand francs of\nher \"dot\" in several other ways, the public assigned his uncommon\nintrepidity to a desire to escape an invasion of the Minotaur, against\nwhom his personal qualifications would have insufficiently protected him\nhad he rashly dared his fate by bringing home a young and pretty wife.\nThe fact was, however, that the notary recognized the really fine\nqualities of Mademoiselle Agnes (she was called Agnes) and reflected to\nhimself that a woman's beauty is soon past and gone to a husband. As\nto the insignificant youth on whom the clerk of the court bestowed in\nbaptism his Norman name of \"Exupere,\" Madame Latournelle is still so\nsurprised at becoming his mother, at the age of thirty-five years and\nseven months, that she would still provide him, if it were necessary,\nwith her breast and her milk,--an hyperbole which alone can fully\nexpress her impassioned maternity. \"How handsome he is, that son of\nmine!\" she says to her little friend Modeste, as they walk to church,\nwith the beautiful Exupere in front of them. \"He is like you,\" Modeste\nMignon answers, very much as she might have said, \"What horrid\nweather!\" This silhouette of Madame Latournelle is quite important as an\naccessory, inasmuch as for three years she has been the chaperone of the\nyoung girl against whom the notary and his friend Dumay are now plotting\nto set up what we have called, in the \"Physiologie du Mariage,\" a\n\"mouse-trap.\"\n\nAs for Latournelle, imagine a worthy little fellow as sly as the purest\nhonor and uprightness would allow him to be,--a man whom any stranger\nwould take for a rascal at sight of his queer physiognomy, to which,\nhowever, the inhabitants of Havre were well accustomed. His eyesight,\nsaid to be weak, obliged the worthy man to wear green goggles for the\nprotection of his eyes, which were constantly inflamed. The arch of each\neyebrow, defined by a thin down of hair, surrounded the tortoise-shell\nrim of the glasses and made a couple of circles as it were, slightly\napart. If you have never observed on the human face the effect produced\nby these circumferences placed one within the other, and separated by a\nhollow space or line, you can hardly imagine how perplexing such a face\nwill be to you, especially if pale, hollow-cheeked, and terminating in a\npointed chin like that of Mephistopheles,--a type which painters give\nto cats. This double resemblance was observable on the face of Babylas\nLatournelle. Above the atrocious green spectacles rose a bald crown,\nall the more crafty in expression because a wig, seemingly endowed with\nmotion, let the white hairs show on all sides of it as it meandered\ncrookedly across the forehead. An observer taking note of this excellent\nNorman, clothed in black and mounted on his two legs like a beetle on\na couple of pins, and knowing him to be one of the most trustworthy\nof men, would have sought, without finding it, for the reason of such\nphysical misrepresentation.\n\nJean Butscha, a natural son abandoned by his parents and taken care of\nby the clerk of the court and his daughter, and now, through sheer hard\nwork, head-clerk to the notary, fed and lodged by his master, who\ngave him a salary of nine hundred francs, almost a dwarf, and with\nno semblance of youth,--Jean Butscha made Modeste his idol, and would\nwillingly have given his life for hers. The poor fellow, whose eyes\nwere hollowed beneath their heavy lids like the touch-holes of a cannon,\nwhose head overweighted his body, with its shock of crisp hair, and\nwhose face was pock-marked, had lived under pitying eyes from the time\nhe was seven years of age. Is not that enough to explain his whole\nbeing? Silent, self-contained, pious, exemplary in conduct, he went\nhis way over that vast tract of country named on the map of the heart\nLove-without-Hope, the sublime and arid steppes of Desire. Modeste had\nchristened this grotesque little being her \"Black Dwarf.\" The nickname\nsent him to the pages of Walter Scott's novel, and he one day said\nto Modeste: \"Will you accept a rose against the evil day from your\nmysterious dwarf?\" Modeste instantly sent the soul of her adorer to its\nhumble mud-cabin with a terrible glance, such as young girls bestow\non the men who cannot please them. Butscha's conception of himself was\nlowly, and, like the wife of his master, he had never been out of Havre.\n\nPerhaps it will be well, for the sake of those who have never seen\nthat city, to say a few words as to the present destination of the\nLatournelle family,--the head clerk being included in the latter term.\nIngouville is to Havre what Montmartre is to Paris,--a high hill at the\nfoot of which the city lies; with this difference, that the hill and the\ncity are surrounded by the sea and the Seine, that Havre is helplessly\ncircumscribed by enclosing fortifications, and, in short, that the mouth\nof the river, the harbor, and the docks present a very different aspect\nfrom the fifty thousand houses of Paris. At the foot of Montmartre an\nocean of slate roofs lies in motionless blue billows; at Ingouville the\nsea is like the same roofs stirred by the wind. This eminence, or line\nof hills, which coasts the Seine from Rouen to the seashore, leaving a\nmargin of valley land more or less narrow between itself and the river,\nand containing in its cities, its ravines, its vales, its meadows,\nveritable treasures of the picturesque, became of enormous value in\nand about Ingouville, after the year 1816, the period at which the\nprosperity of Havre began. This township has become since that time\nthe Auteuil, the Ville-d'Avray, the Montmorency, in short, the suburban\nresidence of the merchants of Havre. Here they build their houses on\nterraces around its ampitheatre of hills, and breathe the sea air\nladen with the fragrance of their splendid gardens. Here these bold\nspeculators cast off the burden of their counting-rooms and the\natmosphere of their city houses, which are built closely together\nwithout open spaces, often without court-yards,--a vice of construction\nwith the increasing population of Havre, the inflexible line of the\nfortifications, and the enlargement of the docks has forced upon them.\nThe result is, weariness of heart in Havre, cheerfulness and joy at\nIngouville. The law of social development has forced up the suburb of\nGraville like a mushroom. It is to-day more extensive than Havre itself,\nwhich lies at the foot of its slopes like a serpent.\n\nAt the crest of the hill Ingouville has but one street, and (as in all\nsuch situations) the houses which overlook the river have an immense\nadvantage over those on the other side of the road, whose view they\nobstruct, and which present the effect of standing on tip-toe to look\nover the opposing roofs. However, there exist here, as elsewhere,\ncertain servitudes. Some houses standing at the summit have a finer\nposition or possess legal rights of view which compel their opposite\nneighbors to keep their buildings down to a required height. Moreover,\nthe openings cut in the capricious rock by roads which follow its\ndeclensions and make the ampitheatre habitable, give vistas through\nwhich some estates can see the city, or the river, or the sea. Instead\nof rising to an actual peak, the hill ends abruptly in a cliff. At the\nend of the street which follows the line of the summit, ravines appear\nin which a few villages are clustered (Sainte-Adresse and two or three\nother Saint-somethings) together with several creeks which murmur and\nflow with the tides of the sea. These half-deserted slopes of Ingouville\nform a striking contrast to the terraces of fine villas which overlook\nthe valley of the Seine. Is the wind on this side too strong for\nvegetation? Do the merchants shrink from the cost of terracing it?\nHowever this may be, the traveller approaching Havre on a steamer is\nsurprised to find a barren coast and tangled gorges to the west of\nIngouville, like a beggar in rags beside a perfumed and sumptuously\napparelled rich man.\n\nIn 1829 one of the last houses looking toward the sea, and which in\nall probability stands about the centre of the Ingouville to-day, was\ncalled, and perhaps is still called, \"the Chalet.\" Originally it was a\nporter's lodge with a trim little garden in front of it. The owner of\nthe villa to which it belonged,--a mansion with park, gardens, aviaries,\nhot-houses, and lawns--took a fancy to put the little dwelling more in\nkeeping with the splendor of his own abode, and he reconstructed it on\nthe model of an ornamental cottage. He divided this cottage from his own\nlawn, which was bordered and set with flower-beds and formed the terrace\nof his villa, by a low wall along which he planted a concealing hedge.\nBehind the cottage (called, in spite of all his efforts to prevent it,\nthe Chalet) were the orchards and kitchen gardens of the villa. The\nChalet, without cows or dairy, is separated from the roadway by a wooden\nfence whose palings are hidden under a luxuriant hedge. On the other\nside of the road the opposite house, subject to a legal privilege, has\na similar hedge and paling, so as to leave an unobstructed view of Havre\nto the Chalet.\n\nThis little dwelling was the torment of the present proprietor of the\nvilla, Monsieur Vilquin; and here is the why and the wherefore. The\noriginal creator of the villa, whose sumptuous details cry aloud,\n\"Behold our millions!\" extended his park far into the country for the\npurpose, as he averred, of getting his gardeners out of his pockets; and\nso, when the Chalet was finished, none but a friend could be allowed to\ninhabit it. Monsieur Mignon, the next owner of the property, was very\nmuch attached to his cashier, Dumay, and the following history will\nprove that the attachment was mutual; to him therefore he offered\nthe little dwelling. Dumay, a stickler for legal methods, insisted on\nsigning a lease for three hundred francs for twelve years, and Monsieur\nMignon willingly agreed, remarking,--\n\n\"My dear Dumay, remember, you have now bound yourself to live with me\nfor twelve years.\"\n\nIn consequence of certain events which will presently be related, the\nestates of Monsieur Mignon, formerly the richest merchant in Havre, were\nsold to Vilquin, one of his business competitors. In his joy at getting\npossession of the celebrated villa Mignon, the latter forgot to demand\nthe cancelling of the lease. Dumay, anxious not to hinder the sale,\nwould have signed anything Vilquin required, but the sale once made, he\nheld to his lease like a vengeance. And there he remained, in Vilquin's\npocket as it were; at the heart of Vilquin's family life, observing\nVilquin, irritating Vilquin,--in short, the gadfly of all the Vilquins.\nEvery morning, when he looked out of his window, Vilquin felt a violent\nshock of annoyance as his eye lighted on the little gem of a building,\nthe Chalet, which had cost sixty thousand francs and sparkled like a\nruby in the sun. That comparison is very nearly exact. The architect has\nconstructed the cottage of brilliant red brick pointed with white.\nThe window-frames are painted of a lively green, the woodwork is brown\nverging on yellow. The roof overhangs by several feet. A pretty gallery,\nwith open-worked balustrade, surmounts the lower floor and projects\nat the centre of the facade into a veranda with glass sides. The\nground-floor has a charming salon and a dining-room, separated from\neach other by the landing of a staircase built of wood, designed\nand decorated with elegant simplicity. The kitchen is behind the\ndining-room, and the corresponding room back of the salon, formerly a\nstudy, is now the bedroom of Monsieur and Madame Dumay. On the upper\nfloor the architect has managed to get two large bedrooms, each with a\ndressing-room, to which the veranda serves as a salon; and above this\nfloor, under the eaves, which are tipped together like a couple of\ncards, are two servants' rooms with mansard roofs, each lighted by a\ncircular window and tolerably spacious.\n\nVilquin has been petty enough to build a high wall on the side toward\nthe orchard and kitchen garden; and in consequence of this piece\nof spite, the few square feet which the lease secured to the Chalet\nresembled a Parisian garden. The out-buildings, painted in keeping\nwith the cottage, stood with their backs to the wall of the adjoining\nproperty.\n\nThe interior of this charming dwelling harmonized with its exterior.\nThe salon, floored entirely with iron-wood, was painted in a style that\nsuggested the beauties of Chinese lacquer. On black panels edged with\ngold, birds of every color, foliage of impossible greens, and fantastic\noriental designs glowed and shimmered. The dining-room was entirely\nsheathed in Northern woods carved and cut in open-work like the\nbeautiful Russian chalets. The little antechamber formed by the landing\nand the well of the staircase was painted in old oak to represent Gothic\nornament. The bedrooms, hung with chintz, were charming in their costly\nsimplicity. The study, where the cashier and his wife now slept, was\npanelled from top to bottom, on the walls and ceiling, like the cabin of\na steamboat. These luxuries of his predecessor excited Vilquin's wrath.\nHe would fain have lodged his daughter and her husband in the cottage.\nThis desire, well known to Dumay, will presently serve to illustrate the\nBreton obstinacy of the latter.\n\nThe entrance to the Chalet is by a little trellised iron door, the\nuprights of which, ending in lance-heads, show for a few inches above\nthe fence and its hedge. The little garden, about as wide as the more\npretentious lawn, was just now filled with flowers, roses, and dahlias\nof the choicest kind, and many rare products of the hot-houses, for\n(another Vilquinard grievance) the elegant little hot-house, a very whim\nof a hot-house, a hot-house representing dignity and style, belonged\nto the Chalet, and separated, or if you prefer, united it to the villa\nVilquin. Dumay consoled himself for the toils of business in taking care\nof this hot-house, whose exotic treasures were one of Modeste's joys.\nThe billiard-room of the villa Vilquin, a species of gallery, formerly\ncommunicated through an immense aviary with this hot-house. But after\nthe building of the wall which deprived him of a view into the orchards,\nDumay bricked up the door of communication. \"Wall for wall!\" he said.\n\nIn 1827 Vilquin offered Dumay a salary of six thousand francs, and ten\nthousand more as indemnity, if he would give up the lease. The cashier\nrefused; though he had but three thousand francs from Gobenheim, a\nformer clerk of his master. Dumay was a Breton transplanted by fate into\nNormandy. Imagine therefore the hatred conceived for the tenants of the\nChalet by the Norman Vilquin, a man worth three millions! What criminal\nleze-million on the part of a cashier, to hold up to the eyes of such\na man the impotence of his wealth! Vilquin, whose desperation in the\nmatter made him the talk of Havre, had just proposed to give Dumay a\npretty house of his own, and had again been refused. Havre itself began\nto grow uneasy at the man's obstinacy, and a good many persons explained\nit by the phrase, \"Dumay is a Breton.\" As for the cashier, he thought\nMadame and Mademoiselle Mignon would be ill-lodged elsewhere. His\ntwo idols now inhabited a temple worthy of them; the sumptuous little\ncottage gave them a home, where these dethroned royalties could keep the\nsemblance of majesty about them,--a species of dignity usually denied to\nthose who have seen better days.\n\nPerhaps as the story goes on, the reader will not regret having learned\nin advance a few particulars as to the home and the habitual companions\nof Modeste Mignon, for, at her age, people and things have as much\ninfluence upon the future life as a person's own character,--indeed,\ncharacter often receives ineffaceable impressions from its surroundings.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. A PORTRAIT FROM LIFE\n\n\nFrom the manner with which the Latournelles entered the Chalet a\nstranger would readily have guessed that they came there every evening.\n\n\"Ah, you are here already,\" said the notary, perceiving the young banker\nGobenheim, a connection of Gobenheim-Keller, the head of the great\nbanking house in Paris.\n\nThis young man with a livid face--a blonde of the type with black eyes,\nwhose immovable glance has an indescribable fascination, sober in speech\nas in conduct, dressed in black, lean as a consumptive, but nevertheless\nvigorously framed--visited the family of his former master and the house\nof his cashier less from affection than from self-interest. Here they\nplayed whist at two sous a point; a dress-coat was not required; he\naccepted no refreshment except \"eau sucree,\" and consequently had\nno civilities to return. This apparent devotion to the Mignon family\nallowed it to be supposed that Gobenheim had a heart; it also released\nhim from the necessity of going into the society of Havre and incurring\nuseless expenses, thus upsetting the orderly economy of his domestic\nlife. This disciple of the golden calf went to bed at half-past ten\no'clock and got up at five in the morning. Moreover, being perfectly\nsure of Latournelle's and Butscha's discretion, he could talk over\ndifficult business matters, obtain the advice of the notary gratis,\nand get an inkling of the real truth of the gossip of the street. This\nstolid gold-glutton (the epithet is Butscha's) belonged by nature to\nthe class of substances which chemistry terms absorbents. Ever since the\ncatastrophe of the house of Mignon, where the Kellers had placed him to\nlearn the principles of maritime commerce, no one at the Chalet had ever\nasked him to do the smallest thing, no matter what; his reply was too\nwell known. The young fellow looked at Modeste precisely as he would\nhave looked at a cheap lithograph.\n\n\"He's one of the pistons of the big engine called 'Commerce,'\" said poor\nButscha, whose clever mind made itself felt occasionally by such little\nsayings timidly jerked out.\n\nThe four Latournelles bowed with the most respectful deference to an\nold lady dressed in black velvet, who did not rise from the armchair in\nwhich she was seated, for the reason that both eyes were covered with\nthe yellow film produced by cataract. Madame Mignon may be sketched in\none sentence. Her august countenance of the mother of a family attracted\ninstant notice as that of one whose irreproachable life defies the\nassaults of destiny, which nevertheless makes her the target of its\narrows and a member of the unnumbered tribe of Niobes. Her blonde wig,\ncarefully curled and well arranged upon her head, became the cold white\nface which resembled that of some burgomaster's wife painted by Hals or\nMirevelt. The extreme neatness of her dress, the velvet boots, the lace\ncollar, the shawl evenly folded and put on, all bore testimony to the\nsolicitous care which Modeste bestowed upon her mother.\n\nWhen silence was, as the notary had predicted, restored in the pretty\nsalon, Modeste, sitting beside her mother, for whom she was embroidering\na kerchief, became for an instant the centre of observation. This\ncuriosity, barely veiled by the commonplace salutations and inquiries\nof the visitors, would have revealed even to an indifferent person the\nexistence of the domestic plot to which Modeste was expected to fall\na victim; but Gobenheim, more than indifferent, noticed nothing, and\nproceeded to light the candles on the card-table. The behavior of Dumay\nmade the whole scene terrifying to Butscha, to the Latournelles, and\nabove all to Madame Dumay, who knew her husband to be capable of firing\na pistol at Modeste's lover as coolly as though he were a mad dog.\n\nAfter dinner that day the cashier had gone to walk followed by two\nmagnificent Pyrenees hounds, whom he suspected of betraying him, and\ntherefore left in charge of a farmer, a former tenant of Monsieur\nMignon. On his return, just before the arrival of the Latournelles,\nhe had taken his pistols from his bed's head and placed them on the\nchimney-piece, concealing this action from Modeste. The young girl took\nno notice whatever of these preparations, singular as they were.\n\nThough short, thick-set, pockmarked, and speaking always in a low voice\nas if listening to himself, this Breton, a former lieutenant in the\nGuard, showed the evidence of such resolution, such sang-froid on his\nface that throughout life, even in the army, no one had ever ventured\nto trifle with him. His little eyes, of a calm blue, were like bits of\nsteel. His ways, the look on his face, his speech, his carriage, were\nall in keeping with the short name of Dumay. His physical strength,\nwell-known to every one, put him above all danger of attack. He was able\nto kill a man with a blow of his fist, and had performed that feat at\nBautzen, where he found himself, unarmed, face to face with a Saxon\nat the rear of his company. At the present moment the usually firm\nyet gentle expression of the man's face had risen to a sort of tragic\nsublimity; his lips were pale as the rest of his face, indicating a\ntumult within him mastered by his Breton will; a slight sweat, which\nevery one noticed and guessed to be cold, moistened his brow. The notary\nknew but too well that these signs might result in a drama before the\ncriminal courts. In fact the cashier was playing a part in connection\nwith Modeste Mignon, which involved to his mind sentiments of honor and\nloyalty of far greater importance than mere social laws; and his present\nconduct proceeded from one of those compacts which, in case disaster\ncame of it, could be judged only in a higher court than one of earth.\nThe majority of dramas lie really in the ideas which we make to\nourselves about things. Events which seem to us dramatic are nothing\nmore than subjects which our souls convert into tragedy or comedy\naccording to the bent of our characters.\n\nMadame Latournelle and Madame Dumay, who were appointed to watch\nModeste, had a certain assumed stiffness of demeanor and a quiver in\ntheir voices, which the suspected party did not notice, so absorbed\nwas she in her embroidery. Modeste laid each thread of cotton with a\nprecision that would have made an ordinary workwoman desperate. Her face\nexpressed the pleasure she took in the smooth petals of the flower\nshe was working. The dwarf, seated between his mistress and Gobenheim,\nrestrained his emotion, trying to find means to approach Modeste and\nwhisper a word of warning in her ear.\n\nBy taking a position in front of Madame Mignon, Madame Latournelle, with\nthe diabolical intelligence of conscientious duty, had isolated Modeste.\nMadame Mignon, whose blindness always made her silent, was even paler\nthan usual, showing plainly that she was aware of the test to which\nher daughter was about to be subjected. Perhaps at the last moment she\nrevolted from the stratagem, necessary as it might seem to her. Hence\nher silence; she was weeping inwardly. Exupere, the spring of the\ntrap, was wholly ignorant of the piece in which he was to play a\npart. Gobenheim, by reason of his character, remained in a state of\nindifference equal to that displayed by Modeste. To a spectator who\nunderstood the situation, this contrast between the ignorance of some\nand the palpitating interest of others would have seemed quite poetic.\nNowadays romance-writers arrange such effects; and it is quite within\ntheir province to do so, for nature in all ages takes the liberty to be\nstronger than they. In this instance, as you will see, nature, social\nnature, which is a second nature within nature, amused herself by making\ntruth more interesting than fiction; just as mountain torrents describe\ncurves which are beyond the skill of painters to convey, and accomplish\ngiant deeds in displacing or smoothing stones which are the wonder of\narchitects and sculptors.\n\nIt was eight o'clock. At that season twilight was still shedding its\nlast gleams; there was not a cloud in the sky; the balmy air caressed\nthe earth, the flowers gave forth their fragrance, the steps of\npedestrians turning homeward sounded along the gravelly road, the sea\nshone like a mirror, and there was so little wind that the wax candles\nupon the card-tables sent up a steady flame, although the windows were\nwide open. This salon, this evening, this dwelling--what a frame for the\nportrait of the young girl whom these persons were now studying with the\nprofound attention of a painter in presence of the Margharita Doni, one\nof the glories of the Pitti palace. Modeste,--blossom enclosed, like\nthat of Catullus,--was she worth all these precautions?\n\nYou have seen the cage; behold the bird! Just twenty years of age,\nslender and delicate as the sirens which English designers invent for\ntheir \"Books of Beauty,\" Modeste was, like her mother before her, the\ncaptivating embodiment of a grace too little understood in France, where\nwe choose to call it sentimentality, but which among German women is\nthe poetry of the heart coming to the surface of the being and spending\nitself--in affectations if the owner is silly, in divine charms of\nmanner if she is \"spirituelle\" and intelligent. Remarkable for her pale\ngolden hair, Modeste belonged to the type of woman called, perhaps in\nmemory of Eve, the celestial blonde; whose satiny skin is like a silk\npaper applied to the flesh, shuddering at the winter of a cold look,\nexpanding in the sunshine of a loving glance,--teaching the hand to be\njealous of the eye. Beneath her hair, which was soft and feathery and\nworn in many curls, the brow, which might have been traced by a compass\nso pure was its modelling, shone forth discreet, calm to placidity,\nand yet luminous with thought: when and where could another be found so\ntransparently clear or more exquisitely smooth? It seemed, like a pearl,\nto have its orient. The eyes, of a blue verging on gray and limpid\nas the eyes of a child, had all the mischief, all the innocence of\nchildhood, and they harmonized well with the arch of the eyebrows,\nfaintly indicated by lines like those made with a brush on Chinese\nfaces. This candor of the soul was still further evidenced around the\neyes, in their corners, and about the temples, by pearly tints threaded\nwith blue, the special privilege of these delicate complexions. The\nface, whose oval Raphael so often gave to his Madonnas, was remarkable\nfor the sober and virginal tone of the cheeks, soft as a Bengal rose,\nupon which the long lashes of the diaphanous eyelids cast shadows that\nwere mingled with light. The throat, bending as she worked, too delicate\nperhaps, and of milky whiteness, recalled those vanishing lines that\nLeonardo loved. A few little blemishes here and there, like the patches\nof the eighteenth century, proved that Modeste was indeed a child of\nearth, and not a creation dreamed of in Italy by the angelic school. Her\nlips, delicate yet full, were slightly mocking and somewhat sensuous;\nthe waist, which was supple and yet not fragile, had no terrors for\nmaternity, like those of girls who seek beauty by the fatal pressure of\na corset. Steel and dimity and lacings defined but did not create the\nserpentine lines of the elegant figure, graceful as that of a young\npoplar swaying in the wind.\n\nA pearl-gray dress with crimson trimmings, made with a long waist,\nmodestly outlined the bust and covered the shoulders, still rather thin,\nwith a chemisette which left nothing to view but the first curves of\nthe throat where it joined the shoulders. From the aspect of the young\ngirl's face, at once ethereal and intelligent, where the delicacy of a\nGreek nose with its rosy nostrils and firm modelling marked something\npositive and defined; where the poetry enthroned upon an almost mystic\nbrow seemed belied at times by the pleasure-loving expression of the\nmouth; where candor claimed the depths profound and varied of the\neye, and disputed them with a spirit of irony that was trained and\neducated,--from all these signs an observer would have felt that this\nyoung girl, with the keen, alert ear that waked at every sound, with\na nostril open to catch the fragrance of the celestial flower of the\nIdeal, was destined to be the battle-ground of a struggle between\nthe poesies of the dawn and the labors of the day; between fancy\nand reality, the spirit and the life. Modeste was a pure young girl,\ninquisitive after knowledge, understanding her destiny, and filled with\nchastity,--the Virgin of Spain rather than the Madonna of Raphael.\n\nShe raised her head when she heard Dumay say to Exupere, \"Come here,\nyoung man.\" Seeing them together in the corner of the salon she supposed\nthey were talking of some commission in Paris. Then she looked at\nthe friends who surrounded her, as if surprised by their silence, and\nexclaimed in her natural manner, \"Why are you not playing?\"--with a\nglance at the green table which the imposing Madame Latournelle called\nthe \"altar.\"\n\n\"Yes, let us play,\" said Dumay, having sent off Exupere.\n\n\"Sit there, Butscha,\" said Madame Latournelle, separating the head-clerk\nfrom the group around Madame Mignon and her daughter by the whole width\nof the table.\n\n\"And you, come over here,\" said Dumay to his wife, making her sit close\nby him.\n\nMadame Dumay, a little American about thirty-six years of age, wiped her\neyes furtively; she adored Modeste, and feared a catastrophe.\n\n\"You are not very lively this evening,\" remarked Modeste.\n\n\"We are playing,\" said Gobenheim, sorting his cards.\n\nNo matter how interesting this situation may appear, it can be made\nstill more so by explaining Dumay's position towards Modeste. If the\nbrevity of this explanation makes it seem rather dry, the reader must\npardon its dryness in view of our desire to get through with these\npreliminaries as speedily as possible, and the necessity of relating the\nmain circumstances which govern all dramas.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. PRELIMINARIES\n\n\nJean Francois Bernard Dumay, born at Vannes, started as a soldier for\nthe army of Italy in 1799. His father, president of the revolutionary\ntribunal of that town, had displayed so much energy in his office\nthat the place had become too hot to hold the son when the parent, a\npettifogging lawyer, perished on the scaffold after the ninth Thermidor.\nOn the death of his mother, who died of the grief this catastrophe\noccasioned, Jean sold all that he possessed and rushed to Italy at the\nage of twenty-two, at the very moment when our armies were beginning to\nyield. On the way he met a young man in the department of Var, who\nfor reasons analogous to his own was in search of glory, believing a\nbattle-field less perilous than his own Provence. Charles Mignon, the\nlast scion of an ancient family, which gave its name to a street in\nParis and to a mansion built by Cardinal Mignon, had a shrewd and\ncalculating father, whose one idea was to save his feudal estate of La\nBastie in the Comtat from the claws of the Revolution. Like all timid\nfolk of that day, the Comte de La Bastie, now citizen Mignon, found it\nmore wholesome to cut off other people's heads than to let his own be\ncut off. The sham terrorist disappeared after the 9th Thermidor, and was\nthen inscribed on the list of emigres. The estate of La Bastie was sold;\nthe towers and bastions of the old castle were pulled down, and citizen\nMignon was soon after discovered at Orleans and put to death with his\nwife and all his children except Charles, whom he had sent to find a\nrefuge for the family in the Upper Alps.\n\nHorrorstruck at the news, Charles waited for better times in a valley of\nMont Genevra; and there he remained till 1799, subsisting on a few\nlouis which his father had put into his hand at starting. Finally,\nwhen twenty-three years of age, and without other fortune than his fine\npresence and that southern beauty which, when it reaches perfection,\nmay be called sublime (of which Antinous, the favorite of Adrian, is the\ntype), Charles resolved to wager his Provencal audacity--taking it, like\nmany another youth, for a vocation--on the red cloth of war. On his\nway to the base of the army at Nice he met the Breton. The pair became\nintimate, partly from the contrasts in their characters; they drank from\nthe same cup at the wayside torrents, broke the same biscuit, and were\nboth made sergeants at the peace which followed the battle of Marengo.\n\nWhen the war recommenced, Charles Mignon was promoted into the cavalry\nand lost sight of his comrade. In 1812 the last of the Mignon de La\nBastie was an officer of the Legion of honor and major of a regiment\nof cavalry. Taken prisoner by the Russians he was sent, like so\nmany others, to Siberia. He made the journey in company with another\nprisoner, a poor lieutenant, in whom he recognized his old friend Jean\nDumay, brave, neglected, undecorated, unhappy, like a million of other\nwoollen epaulets, rank and file--that canvas of men on which\nNapoleon painted the picture of the Empire. While in Siberia, the\nlieutenant-colonel, to kill time, taught writing and arithmetic to the\nBreton, whose early education had seemed a useless waste of time to Pere\nScevola. Charles found in the old comrade of his marching days one of\nthose rare hearts into which a man can pour his griefs while telling his\njoys.\n\nThe young Provencal had met the fate which attends all handsome\nbachelors. In 1804, at Frankfort on the Main, he was adored by Bettina\nWallenrod, only daughter of a banker, and he married her with all the\nmore enthusiasm because she was rich and a noted beauty, while he was\nonly a lieutenant with no prospects but the extremely problematical\nfuture of a soldier of fortune of that day. Old Wallenrod, a decayed\nGerman baron (there is always a baron in a German bank) delighted to\nknow that the handsome lieutenant was the sole representative of the\nMignon de La Bastie, approved the love of the blonde Bettina, whose\nbeauty an artist (at that time there really was one in Frankfort) had\nlately painted as an ideal head of Germany. Wallenrod invested enough\nmoney in the French funds to give his daughter thirty thousand francs a\nyear, and settled it on his anticipated grandsons, naming them counts of\nLa Bastie-Wallenrod. This \"dot\" made only a small hole in his cash-box,\nthe value of money being then very low. But the Empire, pursuing a\npolicy often attempted by other debtors, rarely paid its dividends; and\nCharles was rather alarmed at this investment, having less faith than\nhis father-in-law in the imperial eagle. The phenomenon of belief, or of\nadmiration which is ephemeral belief, is not so easily maintained when\nin close quarters with the idol. The mechanic distrusts the machine\nwhich the traveller admires; and the officers of the army might be\ncalled the stokers of the Napoleonic engine,--if, indeed, they were not\nits fuel.\n\nHowever, the Baron Wallenrod-Tustall-Bartenstild promised to come if\nnecessary to the help of the household. Charles loved Bettina Wallenrod\nas much as she loved him, and that is saying a good deal; but when a\nProvencal is moved to enthusiasm all his feelings and attachments are\ngenuine and natural. And how could he fail to adore that blonde beauty,\nescaping, as it were, from the canvas of Durer, gifted with an angelic\nnature and endowed with Frankfort wealth? The pair had four children, of\nwhom only two daughters survived at the time when he poured his griefs\ninto the Breton's heart. Dumay loved these little ones without having\nseen them, solely through the sympathy so well described by Charlet,\nwhich makes a soldier the father of every child. The eldest, named\nBettina Caroline, was born in 1805; the other, Marie Modeste, in 1808.\nThe unfortunate lieutenant-colonel, long without tidings of these\ncherished darlings, was sent, at the peace of 1814, across Russia\nand Prussia on foot, accompanied by the lieutenant. No difference of\nepaulets could count between the two friends, who reached Frankfort just\nas Napoleon was disembarking at Cannes.\n\nCharles found his wife in Frankfort, in mourning for her father, who had\nalways idolized her and tried to keep a smile upon her lips, even by\nhis dying bed. Old Wallenrod was unable to survive the disasters of the\nEmpire. At seventy years of age he speculated in cottons, relying on the\ngenius of Napoleon without comprehending that genius is quite as often\nbeyond as at the bottom of current events. The old man had purchased\nnearly as many bales of cotton as the Emperor had lost men during his\nmagnificent campaign in France. \"I tie in goddon,\" said the father to\nthe daughter, a father of the Goriot type, striving to quiet a grief\nwhich distressed him. \"I owe no mann anything--\" and he died, still\ntrying to speak to his daughter in the language that she loved.\n\nThankful to have saved his wife and daughters from the general\nwreck, Charles Mignon returned to Paris, where the Emperor made him\nlieutenant-colonel in the cuirassiers of the Guard and commander of the\nLegion of honor. The colonel dreamed of being count and general\nafter the first victory. Alas! that hope was quenched in the blood of\nWaterloo. The colonel, slightly wounded, retired to the Loire, and left\nTours before the disbandment of the army.\n\nIn the spring of 1816 Charles sold his wife's property out of the funds\nto the amount of nearly four hundred thousand francs, intending to seek\nhis fortune in America, and abandon his own country where persecution\nwas beginning to lay a heavy hand on the soldiers of Napoleon. He went\nto Havre accompanied by Dumay, whose life he had saved at Waterloo\nby taking him on the crupper of his saddle in the hurly-burly of the\nretreat. Dumay shared the opinions and the anxieties of his colonel; the\npoor fellow idolized the two little girls and followed Charles like\na spaniel. The latter, confident that the habit of obedience, the\ndiscipline of subordination, and the honesty and affection of the\nlieutenant would make him a useful as well as a faithful retainer,\nproposed to take him with him in a civil capacity. Dumay was only too\nhappy to be adopted into the family, to which he resolved to cling like\nthe mistletoe to an oak.\n\nWhile waiting for an opportunity to embark, at the same time making\nchoice of a ship and reflecting on the chances offered by the various\nports for which they sailed, the colonel heard much talk about the\nbrilliant future which the peace seemed to promise to Havre. As he\nlistened to these conversations among the merchants, he foresaw the\nmeans of fortune, and without loss of time he set about making himself\nthe owner of landed property, a banker, and a shipping-merchant. He\nbought land and houses in the town, and despatched a vessel to New York\nfreighted with silks purchased in Lyons at reduced prices. He sent Dumay\non the ship as his agent; and when the latter returned, after making a\ndouble profit by the sale of the silks and the purchase of cottons at\na low valuation, he found the colonel installed with his family in\nthe handsomest house in the rue Royale, and studying the principles of\nbanking with the prodigious activity and intelligence of a native of\nProvence.\n\nThis double operation of Dumay's was worth a fortune to the house of\nMignon. The colonel purchased the villa at Ingouville and rewarded his\nagent with the gift of a modest little house in the rue Royale. The\npoor toiler had brought back from New York, together with his cottons,\na pretty little wife, attracted it would seem by his French nature. Miss\nGrummer was worth about four thousand dollars (twenty thousand francs),\nwhich sum Dumay placed with his colonel, to whom he now became an alter\nego. In a short time he learned to keep his patron's books, a science\nwhich, to use his own expression, pertains to the sergeant-majors of\ncommerce. The simple-hearted soldier, whom fortune had forgotten for\ntwenty years, thought himself the happiest man in the world as the owner\nof the little house (which his master's liberality had furnished), with\ntwelve hundred francs a year from money in the funds, and a salary of\nthree thousand six hundred. Never in his dreams had Lieutenant Dumay\nhoped for a situation so good as this; but greater still was the\nsatisfaction he derived from the knowledge that his lucky enterprise had\nbeen the pivot of good fortune to the richest commercial house in Havre.\n\nMadame Dumay, a rather pretty little American, had the misfortune to\nlose all her children at their birth; and her last confinement was so\ndisastrous as to deprive her of the hope of any other. She therefore\nattached herself to the two little Mignons, whom Dumay himself loved,\nor would have loved, even better than his own children had they lived.\nMadame Dumay, whose parents were farmers accustomed to a life of\neconomy, was quite satisfied to receive only two thousand four hundred\nfrancs of her own and her household expenses; so that every year Dumay\nlaid by two thousand and some extra hundreds with the house of Mignon.\nWhen the yearly accounts were made up the colonel always added something\nto this little store by way of acknowledging the cashier's services,\nuntil in 1824 the latter had a credit of fifty-eight thousand francs. In\nwas then that Charles Mignon, Comte de La Bastie, a title he never used,\ncrowned his cashier with the final happiness of residing at the Chalet,\nwhere at the time when this story begins Madame Mignon and her daughter\nwere living in obscurity.\n\nThe deplorable state of Madame Mignon's health was caused in part by the\ncatastrophe to which the absence of her husband was due. Grief had taken\nthree years to break down the docile German woman; but it was a grief\nthat gnawed at her heart like a worm at the core of a sound fruit. It\nis easy to reckon up its obvious causes. Two children, dying in infancy,\nhad a double grave in a soul that could never forget. The exile of her\nhusband to Siberia was to such a woman a daily death. The failure of\nthe rich house of Wallenrod, and the death of her father, leaving his\ncoffers empty, was to Bettina, then uncertain about the fate of her\nhusband, a terrible blow. The joy of Charles's return came near killing\nthe tender German flower. After that the second fall of the Empire and\nthe proposed expatriation acted on her feelings like a renewed attack\nof the same fever. At last, however, after ten years of continual\nprosperity, the comforts of her house, which was the finest in Havre,\nthe dinners, balls, and fetes of a prosperous merchant, the splendors of\nthe villa Mignon, the unbounded respect and consideration enjoyed by her\nhusband, his absolute affection, giving her an unrivalled love in return\nfor her single-minded love for him,--all these things brought the woman\nback to life. At the moment when her doubts and fears at last left her,\nwhen she could look forward to the bright evening of her stormy life, a\nhidden catastrophe, buried in the heart of the family, and of which we\nshall presently make mention, came as the precursor of renewed trials.\n\nIn January, 1826, on the day when Havre had unanimously chosen Charles\nMignon as its deputy, three letters, arriving from New York, Paris, and\nLondon, fell with the destruction of a hammer upon the crystal palace\nof his prosperity. In an instant ruin like a vulture swooped down upon\ntheir happiness, just as the cold fell in 1812 upon the grand army in\nRussia. One night sufficed Charles Mignon to decide upon his course,\nand he spent it in settling his accounts with Dumay. All he owned, not\nexcepting his furniture, would just suffice to pay his creditors.\n\n\"Havre shall never see me doing nothing,\" said the colonel to the\nlieutenant. \"Dumay, I take your sixty thousand francs at six per cent.\"\n\n\"Three, my colonel.\"\n\n\"At nothing, then,\" cried Mignon, peremptorily; \"you shall have your\nshare in the profits of what I now undertake. The 'Modeste,' which is no\nlonger mine, sails to-morrow, and I sail in her. I commit to you my wife\nand daughter. I shall not write. No news must be taken as good news.\"\n\nDumay, always subordinate, asked no questions of his colonel. \"I think,\"\nhe said to Latournelle with a knowing little glance, \"that my colonel\nhas a plan laid out.\"\n\nThe following day at dawn he accompanied his master on board the\n\"Modeste\" bound for Constantinople. There, on the poop of the vessel,\nthe Breton said to the Provencal,--\n\n\"What are your last commands, my colonel?\"\n\n\"That no man shall enter the Chalet,\" cried the father with strong\nemotion. \"Dumay, guard my last child as though you were a bull-dog.\nDeath to the man who seduces another daughter! Fear nothing, not even\nthe scaffold--I will be with you.\"\n\n\"My colonel, go in peace. I understand you. You shall find Mademoiselle\nMignon on your return such as you now give her to me, or I shall be\ndead. You know me, and you know your Pyrenees hounds. No man shall reach\nyour daughter. Forgive me for troubling you with words.\"\n\nThe two soldiers clasped arms like men who had learned to understand\neach other in the solitudes of Siberia.\n\nOn the same day the Havre \"Courier\" published the following terrible,\nsimple, energetic, and honorable notice:--\n\n  \"The house of Charles Mignon suspends payment. But the\n  undersigned, assignees of the estate, undertake to pay all\n  liabilities. On and after this date, holders of notes may obtain\n  the usual discount. The sale of the landed estates will fully\n  cover all current indebtedness.\n\n  \"This notice is issued for the honor of the house, and to prevent\n  any disturbance in the money-market of this town.\n\n  \"Monsieur Charles Mignon sailed this morning on the 'Modeste' for\n  Asia Minor, leaving full powers with the undersigned to sell his\n  whole property, both landed and personal.\n\n    \"DUMAY, assignee of the Bank accounts,\n    LATOURNELLE, notary, assignee of the city and villa property,\n    GOBENHEIM, assignee of the commercial property.\"\n\nLatournelle owed his prosperity to the kindness of Monsieur Mignon,\nwho lent him one hundred thousand francs in 1817 to buy the finest law\npractice in Havre. The poor man, who had no pecuniary means, was nearly\nforty years of age and saw no prospect of being other than head-clerk\nfor the rest of his days. He was the only man in Havre whose devotion\ncould be compared with Dumay's. As for Gobenheim, he profited by the\nliquidation to get a part of Monsieur Mignon's business, which lifted\nhis own little bank into prominence.\n\nWhile unanimous regrets for the disaster were expressed in\ncounting-rooms, on the wharves, and in private houses, where praises of\na man so irreproachable, honorable, and beneficent filled every mouth,\nLatournelle and Dumay, silent and active as ants, sold land, turned\nproperty into money, paid the debts, and settled up everything.\nVilquin showed a good deal of generosity in purchasing the villa, the\ntown-house, and a farm; and Latournelle made the most of his liberality\nby getting a good price out of him. Society wished to show civilities to\nMadame and Mademoiselle Mignon; but they had already obeyed the father's\nlast wishes and taken refuge in the Chalet, where they went on the very\nmorning of his departure, the exact hour of which had been concealed\nfrom them. Not to be shaken in his resolution by his grief at parting,\nthe brave man said farewell to his wife and daughter while they slept.\nThree hundred visiting cards were left at the house. A fortnight later,\njust as Charles had predicted, complete forgetfulness settled down upon\nthe Chalet, and proved to these women the wisdom and dignity of his\ncommand.\n\nDumay sent agents to represent his master in New York, Paris, and\nLondon, and followed up the assignments of the three banking-houses\nwhose failure had caused the ruin of the Havre house, thus realizing\nfive hundred thousand francs between 1826 and 1828, an eighth of\nCharles's whole fortune; then, according to the latter's directions\ngiven on the night of his departure, he sent that sum to New York\nthrough the house of Mongenod to the credit of Monsieur Charles Mignon.\nAll this was done with military obedience, except in a matter of\nwithholding thirty thousand francs for the personal expenses of Madame\nand Mademoiselle Mignon as the colonel had ordered him to do, but\nwhich Dumay did not do. The Breton sold his own little house for twenty\nthousand francs, which sum he gave to Madame Mignon, believing that the\nmore capital he sent to his colonel the sooner the latter would return.\n\n\"He might perish for the want of thirty thousand francs,\" Dumay remarked\nto Latournelle, who bought the little house at its full value, where an\napartment was always kept ready for the inhabitants of the Chalet.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. A SIMPLE STORY\n\n\nSuch was the result to the celebrated house of Mignon at Havre of\nthe crisis of 1825-26, which convulsed many of the principal business\ncentres in Europe and caused the ruin of several Parisian bankers, among\nthem (as those who remember that crisis will recall) the president of\nthe chamber of commerce.\n\nWe can now understand how this great disaster, coming suddenly at the\nclose of ten years of domestic happiness, might well have been the death\nof Bettina Mignon, again separated from her husband and ignorant of his\nfate,--to her as adventurous and perilous as the exile to Siberia. But\nthe grief which was dragging her to the grave was far other than these\nvisible sorrows. The caustic that was slowly eating into her heart lay\nbeneath a stone in the little graveyard of Ingouville, on which was\ninscribed:--\n\n                      BETTINA CAROLINE MIGNON\n\n                       Died aged twenty-two.\n\n                           Pray for her.\n\nThis inscription is to the young girl whom it covered what many another\nepitaph has been for the dead lying beneath them,--a table of contents\nto a hidden book. Here is the book, in its dreadful brevity; and it will\nexplain the oath exacted and taken when the colonel and the lieutenant\nbade each other farewell.\n\nA young man of charming appearance, named Charles d'Estourny, came to\nHavre for the commonplace purpose of being near the sea, and there he\nsaw Bettina Mignon. A \"soi-disant\" fashionable Parisian is never without\nintroductions, and he was invited at the instance of a friend of the\nMignons to a fete given at Ingouville. He fell in love with Bettina and\nwith her fortune, and in three months he had done the work of seduction\nand enticed her away. The father of a family of daughters should no more\nallow a young man whom he does not know to enter his home than he should\nleave books and papers lying about which he has not read. A young girl's\ninnocence is like milk, which a small matter turns sour,--a clap of\nthunder, an evil odor, a hot day, a mere breath.\n\nWhen Charles Mignon read his daughter's letter of farewell he instantly\ndespatched Madame Dumay to Paris. The family gave out that a journey\nto another climate had suddenly been advised for Caroline by their\nphysician; and the physician himself sustained the excuse, though unable\nto prevent some gossip in the society of Havre. \"Such a vigorous young\ngirl! with the complexion of a Spaniard, and that black hair!--she\nconsumptive!\" \"Yes, they say she committed some imprudence.\" \"Ah, ah!\"\ncried a Vilquin. \"I am told she came back bathed in perspiration after\nriding on horseback, and drank iced water; at least, that is what Dr.\nTroussenard says.\"\n\nBy the time Madame Dumay returned to Havre the catastrophe of the\nfailure had taken place, and society paid no further attention to the\nabsence of Bettina or the return of the cashier's wife. At the beginning\nof 1827 the newspapers rang with the trial of Charles d'Estourny, who\nwas found guilty of cheating at cards. The young corsair escaped into\nforeign parts without taking thought of Mademoiselle Mignon, who was of\nlittle value to him since the failure of the bank. Bettina heard of his\ninfamous desertion and of her father's ruin almost at the same time. She\nreturned home struck by death, and wasted away in a short time at the\nChalet. Her death at least protected her reputation. The illness that\nMonsieur Mignon alleged to be the cause of her absence, and the doctor's\norder which sent her to Nice were now generally believed. Up to the last\nmoment the mother hoped to save her daughter's life. Bettina was her\ndarling and Modeste was the father's. There was something touching in\nthe two preferences. Bettina was the image of Charles, just as Modeste\nwas the reproduction of her mother. Both parents continued their love\nfor each other in their children. Bettina, a daughter of Provence,\ninherited from her father the beautiful hair, black as a raven's wing,\nwhich distinguishes the women of the South, the brown eye, almond-shaped\nand brilliant as a star, the olive tint, the velvet skin as of some\ngolden fruit, the arched instep, and the Spanish waist from which the\nshort basque skirt fell crisply. Both mother and father were proud of\nthe charming contrast between the sisters. \"A devil and an angel!\" they\nsaid to each other, laughing, little thinking it prophetic.\n\nAfter weeping for a month in the solitude of her chamber, where she\nadmitted no one, the mother came forth at last with injured eyes. Before\nlosing her sight altogether she persisted, against the wishes of her\nfriends, in visiting her daughter's grave, on which she riveted her gaze\nin contemplation. That image remained vivid in the darkness which now\nfell upon her, just as the red spectrum of an object shines in our eyes\nwhen we close them in full daylight. This terrible and double misfortune\nmade Dumay, not less devoted, but more anxious about Modeste, now the\nonly daughter of the father who was unaware of his loss. Madame Dumay,\nidolizing Modeste, like other women deprived of their children, cast her\nmotherliness about the girl,--yet without disregarding the commands\nof her husband, who distrusted female intimacies. Those commands were\nbrief. \"If any man, of any age, or any rank,\" Dumay said, \"speaks to\nModeste, ogles her, makes love to her, he is a dead man. I'll blow his\nbrains out and give myself to the authorities; my death may save her. If\nyou don't wish to see my head cut off, do you take my place in watching\nher when I am obliged to go out.\"\n\nFor the last three years Dumay had examined his pistols every night. He\nseemed to have put half the burden of his oath upon the Pyrenean hounds,\ntwo animals of uncommon sagacity. One slept inside the Chalet, the\nother was stationed in a kennel which he never left, and where he never\nbarked; but terrible would have been the moment had the pair made their\nteeth meet in some unknown adventurer.\n\nWe can now imagine the sort of life led by mother and daughter at the\nChalet. Monsieur and Madame Latournelle, often accompanied by Gobenheim,\ncame to call and play whist with Dumay nearly every evening. The\nconversation turned on the gossip of Havre and the petty events of\nprovincial life. The little company separated between nine and ten\no'clock. Modeste put her mother to bed, and together they said their\nprayers, kept up each other's courage, and talked of the dear absent\none, the husband and father. After kissing her mother for good-night,\nthe girl went to her own room about ten o'clock. The next morning she\nprepared her mother for the day with the same care, the same prayers,\nthe same prattle. To her praise be it said that from the day when the\nterrible infirmity deprived her mother of a sense, Modeste had been like\na servant to her, displaying at all times the same solicitude; never\nwearying of the duty, never thinking it monotonous. Such constant\ndevotion, combined with a tenderness rare among young girls, was\nthoroughly appreciated by those who witnessed it. To the Latournelle\nfamily, and to Monsieur and Madame Dumay, Modeste was, in soul, the\npearl of price.\n\nOn sunny days, between breakfast and dinner, Madame Mignon and Madame\nDumay took a little walk toward the sea. Modeste accompanied them, for\ntwo arms were needed to support the blind mother. About a month before\nthe scene to which this explanation is a parenthesis, Madame Mignon\nhad taken counsel with her friends, Madame Latournelle, the notary, and\nDumay, while Madame Dumay carried Modeste in another direction for a\nlonger walk.\n\n\"Listen to what I have to say,\" said the blind woman. \"My daughter is in\nlove. I feel it; I see it. A singular change has taken place within her,\nand I do not see how it is that none of you have perceived it.\"\n\n\"In the name of all that's honorable--\" cried the lieutenant.\n\n\"Don't interrupt me, Dumay. For the last two months Modeste has taken as\nmuch care of her personal appearance as if she expected to meet a lover.\nShe has grown extremely fastidious about her shoes; she wants to set off\nher pretty feet; she scolds Madame Gobet, the shoemaker. It is the\nsame thing with her milliner. Some days my poor darling is absorbed in\nthought, evidently expectant, as if waiting for some one. Her voice has\ncurt tones when she answers a question, as though she were interrupted\nin the current of her thoughts and secret expectations. Then, if this\nawaited lover has come--\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\"\n\n\"Sit down, Dumay,\" said the blind woman. \"Well, then Modeste is gay. Oh!\nshe is not gay to your sight; you cannot catch these gradations; they\nare too delicate for eyes that see only the outside of nature. Her\ngaiety is betrayed to me by the tones of her voice, by certain accents\nwhich I alone can catch and understand. Modeste then, instead of sitting\nstill and thoughtful, gives vent to a wild, inward activity by impulsive\nmovements,--in short, she is happy. There is a grace, a charm in the\nvery ideas she utters. Ah, my friends, I know happiness as well as I\nknow sorrow; I know its signs. By the kiss my Modeste gives me I can\nguess what is passing within her. I know whether she has received what\nshe was looking for, or whether she is uneasy or expectant. There are\nmany gradations in a kiss, even in that of an innocent young girl, and\nModeste is innocence itself; but hers is the innocence of knowledge,\nnot of ignorance. I may be blind, but my tenderness is all-seeing, and I\ncharge you to watch over my daughter.\"\n\nDumay, now actually ferocious, the notary, in the character of a\nman bound to ferret out a mystery, Madame Latournelle, the deceived\nchaperone, and Madame Dumay, alarmed for her husband's safety, became\nat once a set of spies, and Modeste from this day forth was never left\nalone for an instant. Dumay passed nights under her window wrapped in\nhis cloak like a jealous Spaniard; but with all his military sagacity\nhe was unable to detect the least suspicious sign. Unless she loved the\nnightingales in the villa park, or some fairy prince, Modeste could have\nseen no one, and had neither given nor received a signal. Madame Dumay,\nwho never went to bed till she knew Modeste was asleep, watched the\nroad from the upper windows of the Chalet with a vigilance equal to her\nhusband's. Under these eight Argus eyes the blameless child, whose\nevery motion was studied and analyzed, came out of the ordeal so fully\nacquitted of all criminal conversation that the four friends declared\nto each other privately that Madame Mignon was foolishly over-anxious.\nMadame Latournelle, who always took Modeste to church and brought her\nback again, was commissioned to tell the mother that she was mistaken\nabout her daughter.\n\n\"Modeste,\" she said, \"is a young girl of very exalted ideas; she works\nherself into enthusiasm for the poetry of one writer or the prose of\nanother. You have only to judge by the impression made upon her by\nthat scaffold symphony, 'The Last Hours of a Convict'\" (the saying was\nButscha's, who supplied wit to his benefactress with a lavish hand);\n\"she seemed to me all but crazy with admiration for that Monsieur Hugo.\nI'm sure I don't know where such people\" (Victor Hugo, Lamartine, Byron\nbeing _such people_ to the Madame Latournelles of the bourgeoisie) \"get\ntheir ideas. Modeste kept talking to me of Childe Harold, and as I did\nnot wish to get the worst of the argument I was silly enough to try\nto read the thing. Perhaps it was the fault of the translator, but it\nactually turned my stomach; I was dazed; I couldn't possibly finish it.\nWhy, the man talks about comparisons that howl, rocks that faint, and\nwaves of war! However, he is only a travelling Englishman, and we must\nexpect absurdities,--though his are really inexcusable. He takes you to\nSpain, and sets you in the clouds above the Alps, and makes the torrents\ntalk, and the stars; and he says there are too many virgins! Did you\never hear the like? Then, after Napoleon's campaigns, the lines are full\nof sonorous brass and flaming cannon-balls, rolling along from page to\npage. Modeste tells me that all that bathos is put in by the translator,\nand that I ought to read the book in English. But I certainly sha'n't\nlearn English to read Lord Byron when I didn't learn it to teach\nExupere. I much prefer the novels of Ducray-Dumenil to all these\nEnglish romances. I'm too good a Norman to fall in love with foreign\nthings,--above all when they come from England.\"\n\nMadame Mignon, notwithstanding her melancholy, could not help smiling at\nthe idea of Madame Latournelle reading Childe Harold. The stern scion of\na parliamentary house accepted the smile as an approval of her doctrine.\n\n\"And, therefore, my dear Madame Mignon,\" she went on, \"you have taken\nModeste's fancies, which are nothing but the results of her reading,\nfor a love-affair. Remember, she is just twenty. Girls fall in love with\nthemselves at that age; they dress to see themselves well-dressed. I\nremember I used to make my little sister, now dead, put on a man's hat\nand pretend we were monsieur and madame. You see, you had a very happy\nyouth in Frankfort; but let us be just,--Modeste is living here without\nthe slightest amusement. Although, to be sure, her every wish is\nattended to, still she knows she is shut up and watched, and the life\nshe leads would give her no pleasure at all if it were not for the\namusement she gets out of her books. Come, don't worry yourself; she\nloves nobody but you. You ought to be very glad that she goes into these\nenthusiasms for the corsairs of Byron and the heroes of Walter Scott and\nyour own Germans, Egmont, Goethe, Werther, Schiller, and all the other\n'ers.'\"\n\n\"Well, madame, what do you say to that?\" asked Dumay, respectfully,\nalarmed at Madame Mignon's silence.\n\n\"Modeste is not only inclined to love, but she loves some man,\" answered\nthe mother, obstinately.\n\n\"Madame, my life is at stake, and you must allow me--not for my sake,\nbut for my wife, my colonel, for all of us--to probe this matter to the\nbottom, and find out whether it is the mother or the watch-dog who is\ndeceived.\"\n\n\"It is you who are deceived, Dumay. Ah! if I could but see my daughter!\"\ncried the poor woman.\n\n\"But whom is it possible for her to love?\" asked the notary. \"I'll\nanswer for my Exupere.\"\n\n\"It can't be Gobenheim,\" said Dumay, \"for since the colonel's departure\nhe has not spent nine hours a week in this house. Besides, he doesn't\neven notice Modeste--that five-franc piece of a man! His uncle\nGobenheim-Keller is all the time writing him, 'Get rich enough to marry\na Keller.' With that idea in his mind you may be sure he doesn't know\nwhich sex Modeste belongs to. No other men ever come here,--for of\ncourse I don't count Butscha, poor little fellow; I love him! He is your\nDumay, madame,\" said the cashier to Madame Latournelle. \"Butscha knows\nvery well that a mere glance at Modeste would cost him a Breton ducking.\nNot a soul has any communication with this house. Madame Latournelle who\ntakes Modeste to church ever since your--your misfortune, madame, has\ncarefully watched her on the way and all through the service, and has\nseen nothing suspicious. In short, if I must confess the truth, I have\nmyself raked all the paths about the house every evening for the last\nmonth, and found no trace of footsteps in the morning.\"\n\n\"Rakes are neither costly nor difficult to handle,\" remarked the\ndaughter of Germany.\n\n\"But the dogs?\" cried Dumay.\n\n\"Lovers have philters even for dogs,\" answered Madame Mignon.\n\n\"If you are right, my honor is lost! I may as well blow my brains out,\"\nexclaimed Dumay.\n\n\"Why so, Dumay?\" said the blind woman.\n\n\"Ah, madame, I could never meet my colonel's eye if he did not find his\ndaughter--now his only daughter--as pure and virtuous as she was when\nhe said to me on the vessel, 'Let no fear of the scaffold hinder you,\nDumay, if the honor of my Modeste is at stake.'\"\n\n\"Ah! I recognize you both,\" said Madame Mignon in a voice of strong\nemotion.\n\n\"I'll wager my salvation that Modeste is as pure as she was in her\ncradle,\" exclaimed Madame Dumay.\n\n\"Well, I shall make certain of it,\" replied her husband, \"if Madame\nla Comtesse will allow me to employ certain means; for old troopers\nunderstand strategy.\"\n\n\"I will allow you to do anything that shall enlighten us, provided it\ndoes no injury to my last child.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do, Jean?\" asked Madame Dumay; \"how can you\ndiscover a young girl's secret if she means to hide it?\"\n\n\"Obey me, all!\" cried the lieutenant, \"I shall need every one of you.\"\n\nIf this rapid sketch were clearly developed it would give a whole\npicture of manners and customs in which many a family could recognize\nthe events of their own history; but it must suffice as it is to explain\nthe importance of the few details heretofore given about persons and\nthings on the memorable evening when the old soldier had made ready his\nplot against the young girl, intending to wrench from the recesses of\nher heart the secret of a love and a lover seen only by a blind mother.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. THE PROBLEM STILL UNSOLVED\n\n\nAn hour went by in solemn stillness broken only by the cabalistic\nphrases of the whist-players: \"Spades!\" \"Trumped!\" \"Cut!\" \"How are\nhonors?\" \"Two to four.\" \"Whose deal?\"--phrases which represent in these\ndays the higher emotions of the European aristocracy. Modeste continued\nto work, without seeming to be surprised at her mother's silence.\nMadame Mignon's handkerchief slipped from her lap to the floor; Butscha\nprecipitated himself upon it, picked it up, and as he returned it\nwhispered in Modeste's ear, \"Take care!\" Modeste raised a pair of\nwondering eyes, whose puzzled glance filled the poor cripple with joy\nunspeakable. \"She is not in love!\" he whispered to himself, rubbing his\nhands till the skin was nearly peeled off. At this moment Exupere\ntore through the garden and the house, plunged into the salon like an\navalanche, and said to Dumay in an audible whisper, \"The young man is\nhere!\" Dumay sprang for his pistols and rushed out.\n\n\"Good God! suppose he kills him!\" cried Madame Dumay, bursting into\ntears.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Modeste, looking innocently at her friends\nand not betraying the slightest fear.\n\n\"It is all about a young man who is hanging round the house,\" cried\nMadame Latournelle.\n\n\"Well!\" said Modeste, \"why should Dumay kill him?\"\n\n\"Sancta simplicita!\" ejaculated Butscha, looking at his master as\nproudly as Alexander is made to contemplate Babylon in Lebrun's great\npicture.\n\n\"Where are you going, Modeste?\" asked the mother as her daughter rose to\nleave the room.\n\n\"To get ready for your bedtime, mamma,\" answered Modeste, in a voice as\npure as the tones of an instrument.\n\n\"You haven't paid your expenses,\" said the dwarf to Dumay when he\nreturned.\n\n\"Modeste is as pure as the Virgin on our altar,\" cried Madame\nLatournelle.\n\n\"Good God! such excitements wear me out,\" said Dumay; \"and yet I'm a\nstrong man.\"\n\n\"May I lose that twenty-five sous if I have the slightest idea what you\nare about,\" remarked Gobenheim. \"You seem to me to be crazy.\"\n\n\"And yet it is all about a treasure,\" said Butscha, standing on tiptoe\nto whisper in Gobenheim's ear.\n\n\"Dumay, I am sorry to say that I am still almost certain of what I told\nyou,\" persisted Madame Mignon.\n\n\"The burden of proof is now on you, madame,\" said Dumay, calmly; \"it is\nfor you to prove that we are mistaken.\"\n\nDiscovering that the matter in question was only Modeste's honor,\nGobenheim took his hat, made his bow, and walked off, carrying his ten\nsous with him,--there being evidently no hope of another rubber.\n\n\"Exupere, and you too, Butscha, may leave us,\" said Madame Latournelle.\n\"Go back to Havre; you will get there in time for the last piece at the\ntheatre. I'll pay for your tickets.\"\n\nWhen the four friends were alone with Madame Mignon, Madame Latournelle,\nafter looking at Dumay, who being a Breton understood the mother's\nobstinacy, and at her husband who was fingering the cards, felt herself\nauthorized to speak up.\n\n\"Madame Mignon, come now, tell us what decisive thing has struck your\nmind.\"\n\n\"Ah, my good friend, if you were a musician you would have heard, as I\nhave, the language of love that Modeste speaks.\"\n\nThe piano of the demoiselles Mignon was among the few articles of\nfurniture which had been moved from the town-house to the Chalet.\nModeste often conjured away her troubles by practising, without a\nmaster. Born a musician, she played to enliven her mother. She sang\nby nature, and loved the German airs which her mother taught her. From\nthese lessons and these attempts at self-instruction came a phenomenon\nnot uncommon to natures with a musical vocation; Modeste composed, as\nfar as a person ignorant of the laws of harmony can be said to compose,\ntender little lyric melodies. Melody is to music what imagery and\nsentiment are to poetry, a flower that blossoms spontaneously.\nConsequently, nations have had melodies before harmony,--botany comes\nlater than the flower. In like manner, Modeste, who knew nothing of\nthe painter's art except what she had seen her sister do in the way of\nwater-color, would have stood subdued and fascinated before the\npictures of Raphael, Titian, Rubens, Murillo, Rembrandt, Albert Durer,\nHolbein,--in other words, before the great ideals of many lands. Lately,\nfor at least a month, Modeste had warbled the songs of nightingales,\nmusical rhapsodies whose poetry and meaning had roused the attention of\nher mother, already surprised by her sudden eagerness for composition\nand her fancy for putting airs into certain verses.\n\n\"If your suspicions have no other foundation,\" said Latournelle to\nMadame Mignon, \"I pity your susceptibilities.\"\n\n\"When a Breton girl sings,\" said Dumay gloomily, \"the lover is not far\noff.\"\n\n\"I will let you hear Modeste when she is improvising,\" said the mother,\n\"and you shall judge for yourselves--\"\n\n\"Poor girl!\" said Madame Dumay, \"If she only knew our anxiety she would\nbe deeply distressed; she would tell us the truth,--especially if she\nthought it would save Dumay.\"\n\n\"My friends, I will question my daughter to-morrow,\" said Madame Mignon;\n\"perhaps I shall obtain more by tenderness than you have discovered by\ntrickery.\"\n\nWas the comedy of the \"Fille mal Gardee\" being played here,--as it is\neverywhere and forever,--under the noses of these faithful spies, these\nhonest Bartholos, these Pyrenean hounds, without their being able to\nferret out, detect, nor even surmise the lover, the love-affair, or\nthe smoke of the fire? At any rate it was certainly not the result of a\nstruggle between the jailers and the prisoner, between the despotism of\na dungeon and the liberty of a victim,--it was simply the never-ending\nrepetition of the first scene played by man when the curtain of the\nCreation rose; it was Eve in Paradise.\n\nAnd now, which of the two, the mother or the watch-dog, had the right of\nit?\n\nNone of the persons who were about Modeste could understand that maiden\nheart--for the soul and the face we have described were in harmony. The\ngirl had transported her existence into another world, as much denied\nand disbelieved in in these days of ours as the new world of Christopher\nColumbus in the sixteenth century. Happily, she kept her own counsel,\nor they would have thought her crazy. But first we must explain the\ninfluence of the past upon her nature.\n\nTwo events had formed the soul and developed the mind of this young\ngirl. Monsieur and Madame Mignon, warned by the fate that overtook\nBettina, had resolved, just before the failure, to marry Modeste. They\nchose the son of a rich banker, formerly of Hamburg, but established in\nHavre since 1815,--a man, moreover, who was under obligations to them.\nThe young man, whose name was Francois Althor, the dandy of Havre,\nblessed with a certain vulgar beauty in which the middle classes\ndelight, well-made, well-fleshed, and with a fine complexion, abandoned\nhis betrothed so hastily on the day of her father's failure that neither\nModeste nor her mother nor either of the Dumays had seen him since.\nLatournelle ventured a question on the subject to Jacob Althor, the\nfather; but he only shrugged his shoulders and replied, \"I really don't\nknow what you mean.\"\n\nThis answer, told to Modeste to give her some experience of life, was\na lesson which she learned all the more readily because Latournelle\nand Dumay made many and long comments on the cowardly desertion. The\ndaughters of Charles Mignon, like spoiled children, had all their wishes\ngratified; they rode on horseback, kept their own horses and grooms, and\notherwise enjoyed a perilous liberty. Seeing herself in possession of\nan official lover, Modeste had allowed Francisque to kiss her hand, and\ntake her by the waist to mount her. She accepted his flowers and all the\nlittle proofs of tenderness with which it is proper to surround the\nlady of our choice; she even worked him a purse, believing in such\nties,--strong indeed to noble souls, but cobwebs for the Gobenheims, the\nVilquins, and the Althors.\n\nSome time during the spring which followed the removal of Madame Mignon\nand her daughter to the Chalet, Francisque Althor came to dine with\nthe Vilquins. Happening to see Modeste over the wall at the foot of the\nlawn, he turned away his head. Six weeks later he married the eldest\nMademoiselle Vilquin. In this way Modeste, young, beautiful, and of high\nbirth, learned the lesson that for three whole months of her engagement\nshe had been nothing more than Mademoiselle Million. Her poverty, well\nknown to all, became a sentinel defending the approaches to the Chalet\nfully as well as the prudence of the Latournelles or the vigilance of\nDumay. The talk of the town ran for a time on Mademoiselle Mignon's\nposition only to insult her.\n\n\"Poor girl! what will become of her?--an old maid, of course.\"\n\n\"What a fate! to have had the world at her feet; to have had the chance\nto marry Francisque Althor,--and now, nobody willing to take her!\"\n\n\"After a life of luxury, to come down to such poverty--\"\n\nAnd these insults were not uttered in secret or left to Modeste's\nimagination; she heard them spoken more than once by the young men and\nthe young women of Havre as they walked to Ingouville, and, knowing that\nMadame Mignon and her daughter lived at the Chalet, talked of them as\nthey passed the house. Friends of the Vilquins expressed surprise that\nthe mother and daughter were willing to live on among the scenes of\ntheir former splendor. From her open window behind the closed blinds\nModeste sometimes heard such insolence as this:--\n\n\"I am sure I can't think how they can live there,\" some one would say\nas he paced the villa lawn,--perhaps to assist Vilquin in getting rid of\nhis tenant.\n\n\"What do you suppose they live on? they haven't any means of earning\nmoney.\"\n\n\"I am told the old woman has gone blind.\"\n\n\"Is Mademoiselle Mignon still pretty? Dear me, how dashing she used to\nbe! Well, she hasn't any horses now.\"\n\nMost young girls on hearing these spiteful and silly speeches, born of\nan envy that now rushed, peevish and drivelling, to avenge the past,\nwould have felt the blood mount to their foreheads; others would have\nwept; some would have undergone spasms of anger; but Modeste smiled, as\nwe smile at the theatre while watching the actors. Her pride could not\ndescend so low as the level of such speeches.\n\nThe other event was more serious than these mercenary meannesses.\nBettina Caroline died in the arms of her younger sister, who had nursed\nher with the devotion of girlhood, and the curiosity of an untainted\nimagination. In the silence of long nights the sisters exchanged many a\nconfidence. With what dramatic interest was poor Bettina invested in the\neyes of the innocent Modeste? Bettina knew love through sorrow only, and\nshe was dying of it. Among young girls every man, scoundrel though he\nbe, is still a lover. Passion is the one thing absolutely real in the\nthings of life, and it insists on its supremacy. Charles d'Estourny,\ngambler, criminal, and debauchee, remained in the memory of the\nsisters, the elegant Parisian of the fetes of Havre, the admired of the\nwomenkind. Bettina believed she had carried him off from the coquettish\nMadame Vilquin, and to Modeste he was her sister's happy lover. Such\nadoration in young girls is stronger than all social condemnations. To\nBettina's thinking, justice had been deceived; if not, how could it\nhave sentenced a man who had loved her for six months?--loved her to\ndistraction in the hidden retreat to which he had taken her,--that he\nmight, we may add, be at liberty to go his own way. Thus the dying girl\ninoculated her sister with love. Together they talked of the great drama\nwhich imagination enhances; and Bettina carried with her to the grave\nher sister's ignorance, leaving her, if not informed, at least thirsting\nfor information.\n\nNevertheless, remorse had set its fangs too sharply in Bettina's heart\nnot to force her to warn her sister. In the midst of her own confessions\nshe had preached duty and implicit obedience to Modeste. On the evening\nof her death she implored her to remember the tears that soaked her\npillow, and not to imitate a conduct which even suffering could not\nexpiate. Bettina accused herself of bringing a curse upon the family,\nand died in despair at being unable to obtain her father's pardon.\nNotwithstanding the consolations which the ministers of religion,\ntouched by her repentance, freely gave her, she cried in heartrending\ntones with her latest breath: \"Oh father! father!\" \"Never give your\nheart without your hand,\" she said to Modeste an hour before she died;\n\"and above all, accept no attentions from any man without telling\neverything to papa and mamma.\"\n\nThese words, so earnest in their practical meaning, uttered in the hour\nof death, had more effect upon Modeste than if Bettina had exacted a\nsolemn oath. The dying girl, farseeing as prophet, drew from beneath her\npillow a ring which she had sent by her faithful maid, Francoise Cochet,\nto be engraved in Havre with these words, \"Think of Bettina, 1827,\" and\nplaced it on her sister's finger, begging her to keep it there until\nshe married. Thus there had been between these two young girls a strange\ncommingling of bitter remorse and the artless visions of a fleeting\nspring-time too early blighted by the keen north wind of desertion; yet\nall their tears, regrets and memories were always subordinate to their\nhorror of evil.\n\nNevertheless, this drama of a poor seduced sister returning to die under\na roof of elegant poverty, the failure of her father, the baseness of\nher betrothed, the blindness of her mother caused by grief, had touched\nthe surface only of Modeste's life, by which alone the Dumays and the\nLatournelles judged her; for no devotion of friends can take the place\nof a mother's eye. The monotonous life in the dainty little Chalet,\nsurrounded by the choice flowers which Dumay cultivated; the family\ncustoms, as regular as clock-work, the provincial decorum, the games\nat whist while the mother knitted and the daughter sewed, the silence,\nbroken only by the roar of the sea in the equinoctial storms,--all this\nmonastic tranquillity did in fact hide an inner and tumultuous life, the\nlife of ideas, the life of the spiritual being. We sometimes wonder how\nit is possible for young girls to do wrong; but such as do so have no\nblind mother to send her plummet line of intuition to the depths of the\nsubterranean fancies of a virgin heart. The Dumays slept when Modeste\nopened her window, as it were to watch for the passing of a man,--the\nman of her dreams, the expected knight who was to mount her behind him\nand ride away under the fire of Dumay's pistols.\n\nDuring the depression caused by her sister's death Modeste flung herself\ninto the practice of reading, until her mind became sodden in it. Born\nto the use of two languages, she could speak and read German quite as\nwell as French; she had also, together with her sister, learned English\nfrom Madame Dumay. Being very little overlooked in the matter of reading\nby the people about her, who had no literary knowledge, Modeste fed her\nsoul on the modern masterpieces of three literatures, English, French,\nand German. Lord Byron, Goethe, Schiller, Walter Scott, Hugo, Lamartine,\nCrabbe, Moore, the great works of the 17th and 18th centuries, history,\ndrama, and fiction, from Astraea to Manon Lescaut, from Montaigne's\nEssays to Diderot, from the Fabliaux to the Nouvelle Heloise,--in short,\nthe thought of three lands crowded with confused images that girlish\nhead, august in its cold guilelessness, its native chastity, but from\nwhich there sprang full-armed, brilliant, sincere, and strong, an\noverwhelming admiration for genius. To Modeste a new book was an event;\na masterpiece that would have horrified Madame Latournelle made her\nhappy,--equally unhappy if the great work did not play havoc with her\nheart. A lyric instinct bubbled in that girlish soul, so full of the\nbeautiful illusions of its youth. But of this radiant existence not a\ngleam reached the surface of daily life; it escaped the ken of Dumay and\nhis wife and the Latournelles; the ears of the blind mother alone caught\nthe crackling of its flame.\n\nThe profound disdain which Modeste now conceived for ordinary men gave\nto her face a look of pride, an inexpressible untamed shyness, which\ntempered her Teutonic simplicity, and accorded well with a peculiarity\nof her head. The hair growing in a point above the forehead seemed the\ncontinuation of a slight line which thought had already furrowed between\nthe eyebrows, and made the expression of untameability perhaps a\nshade too strong. The voice of this charming child, whom her father,\ndelighting in her wit, was wont to call his \"little proverb of Solomon,\"\nhad acquired a precious flexibility of organ through the practice of\nthree languages. This advantage was still further enhanced by a\nnatural bell-like tone both sweet and fresh, which touched the heart as\ndelightfully as it did the ear. If the mother could no longer see the\nsigns of a noble destiny upon her daughter's brow, she could study\nthe transitions of her soul's development in the accents of that voice\nattuned to love.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. A MAIDEN'S FIRST ROMANCE\n\n\nTo this period of Modeste's eager rage for reading succeeded the\nexercise of a strange faculty given to vigorous imaginations,--the\npower, namely, of making herself an actor in a dream-existence; of\nrepresenting to her own mind the things desired, with so vivid a\nconception that they seemed actually to attain reality; in short, to\nenjoy by thought,--to live out her years within her mind; to marry;\nto grow old; to attend her own funeral like Charles V.; to play within\nherself the comedy of life and, if need be, that of death. Modeste was\nindeed playing, but all alone, the comedy of Love. She fancied herself\nadored to the summit of her wishes in many an imagined phase of\nsocial life. Sometimes as the heroine of a dark romance, she loved the\nexecutioner, or the wretch who ended her days upon the scaffold, or,\nlike her sister, some Parisian youth without a penny, whose struggles\nwere all beneath a garret-roof. Sometimes she was Ninon, scorning men\namid continual fetes; or some applauded actress, or gay adventuress,\nexhausting in her own behalf the luck of Gil Blas, or the triumphs\nof Pasta, Malibran, and Florine. Then, weary of the horrors and\nexcitements, she returned to actual life. She married a notary, she ate\nthe plain brown bread of honest everyday life, she saw herself a Madame\nLatournelle; she accepted a painful existence, she bore all the trials\nof a struggle with fortune. After that she went back to the romances:\nshe was loved for her beauty; a son of a peer of France, an eccentric,\nartistic young man, divined her heart, recognized the star which the\ngenius of a De Stael had planted on her brow. Her father returned,\npossessing millions. With his permission, she put her various lovers\nto certain tests (always carefully guarding her own independence); she\nowned a magnificent estate and castle, servants, horses, carriages, the\nchoicest of everything that luxury could bestow, and kept her suitors\nuncertain until she was forty years old, at which age she made her\nchoice.\n\nThis edition of the Arabian Nights in a single copy lasted nearly a\nyear, and taught Modeste the sense of satiety through thought. She held\nher life too often in her hand, she said to herself philosophically and\nwith too real a bitterness, too seriously, and too often, \"Well, what\nis it, after all?\" not to have plunged to her waist in the deep disgust\nwhich all men of genius feel when they try to complete by intense toil\nthe work to which they have devoted themselves. Her youth and her rich\nnature alone kept Modeste at this period of her life from seeking to\nenter a cloister. But this sense of satiety cast her, saturated as\nshe still was with Catholic spirituality, into the love of Good, the\ninfinite of heaven. She conceived of charity, service to others, as the\ntrue occupation of life; but she cowered in the gloomy dreariness of\nfinding in it no food for the fancy that lay crouching in her heart like\nan insect at the bottom of a calyx. Meanwhile she sat tranquilly sewing\ngarments for the children of the poor, and listening abstractedly to the\ngrumblings of Monsieur Latournelle when Dumay held the thirteenth card\nor drew out his last trump.\n\nHer religious faith drove Modeste for a time into a singular track\nof thought. She imagined that if she became sinless (speaking\necclesiastically) she would attain to such a condition of sanctity that\nGod would hear her and accomplish her desires. \"Faith,\" she thought,\n\"can move mountains; Christ has said so. The Saviour led his apostle\nupon the waters of the lake Tiberias; and I, all I ask of God is a\nhusband to love me; that is easier than walking upon the sea.\" She\nfasted through the next Lent, and did not commit a single sin; then she\nsaid to herself that on a certain day coming out of church she should\nmeet a handsome young man who was worthy of her, whom her mother would\naccept, and who would fall madly in love with her. When the day came on\nwhich she had, as it were, summoned God to send her an angel, she was\npersistently followed by a rather disgusting beggar; moreover, it rained\nheavily, and not a single young man was in the streets. On another\noccasion she went to walk on the jetty to see the English travellers\nland; but each Englishman had an Englishwoman, nearly as handsome as\nModeste herself, who saw no one at all resembling a wandering Childe\nHarold. Tears overcame her, as she sat down like Marius on the ruins of\nher imagination. But on the day when she subpoenaed God for the third\ntime she firmly believed that the Elect of her dreams was within the\nchurch, hiding, perhaps out of delicacy, behind one of the pillars,\nround all of which she dragged Madame Latournelle on a tour of\ninspection. After this failure, she deposed the Deity from omnipotence.\nMany were her conversations with the imaginary lover, for whom she\ninvented questions and answers, bestowing upon him a great deal of wit\nand intelligence.\n\nThe high ambitions of her heart hidden within these romances were\nthe real explanation of the prudent conduct which the good people who\nwatched over Modeste so much admired; they might have brought her any\nnumber of young Althors or Vilquins, and she would never have stooped to\nsuch clowns. She wanted, purely and simply, a man of genius,--talent she\ncared little for; just as a lawyer is of no account to a girl who aims\nfor an ambassador. Her only desire for wealth was to cast it at the feet\nof her idol. Indeed, the golden background of these visions was far less\nrich than the treasury of her own heart, filled with womanly delicacy;\nfor its dominant desire was to make some Tasso, some Milton, a\nJean-Jacques Rousseau, a Murat, a Christopher Columbus happy.\n\nCommonplace miseries did not seriously touch this youthful soul, who\nlonged to extinguish the fires of the martyrs ignored and rejected in\ntheir own day. Sometimes she imagined balms of Gilead, soothing melodies\nwhich might have allayed the savage misanthropy of Rousseau. Or she\nfancied herself the wife of Lord Byron; guessing intuitively his\ncontempt for the real, she made herself as fantastic as the poetry\nof Manfred, and provided for his scepticism by making him a Catholic.\nModeste attributed Moliere's melancholy to the women of the seventeenth\ncentury. \"Why is there not some one woman,\" she asked herself, \"loving,\nbeautiful, and rich, ready to stand beside each man of genius and be\nhis slave, like Lara, the mysterious page?\" She had, as the reader\nperceives, fully understood \"il pianto,\" which the English poet chanted\nby the mouth of his Gulmare. Modeste greatly admired the behavior of\nthe young Englishwoman who offered herself to Crebillon, the son, who\nmarried her. The story of Sterne and Eliza Draper was her life and her\nhappiness for several months. She made herself ideally the heroine of a\nlike romance, and many a time she rehearsed in imagination the\nsublime role of Eliza. The sensibility so charmingly expressed in that\ndelightful correspondence filled her eyes with tears which, it is said,\nwere lacking in those of the wittiest of English writers.\n\nModeste existed for some time on a comprehension, not only of the works,\nbut of the characters of her favorite authors,--Goldsmith, the author\nof Obermann, Charles Nodier, Maturin. The poorest and the most suffering\namong them were her deities; she guessed their trials, initiated herself\ninto a destitution where the thoughts of genius brooded, and poured upon\nit the treasures of her heart; she fancied herself the giver of material\ncomfort to these great men, martyrs to their own faculty. This noble\ncompassion, this intuition of the struggles of toilers, this worship\nof genius, are among the choicest perceptions that flutter through the\nsouls of women. They are, in the first place, a secret between the woman\nand God, for they are hidden; in them there is nothing striking, nothing\nthat gratifies the vanity,--that powerful auxiliary to all action among\nthe French.\n\nOut of this third period of the development of her ideas, there came to\nModeste a passionate desire to penetrate to the heart of one of these\nabnormal beings; to understand the working of the thoughts and the\nhidden griefs of genius,--to know not only what it wanted but what it\nwas. At the period when this story begins, these vagaries of fancy,\nthese excursions of her soul into the void, these feelers put forth into\nthe darkness of the future, the impatience of an ungiven love to find\nits goal, the nobility of all her thoughts of life, the decision of her\nmind to suffer in a sphere of higher things rather than flounder in the\nmarshes of provincial life like her mother, the pledge she had made to\nherself never to fail in conduct, but to respect her father's hearth and\nbring it happiness,--all this world of feeling and sentiment had lately\ncome to a climax and taken shape. Modeste wished to be the friend and\ncompanion of a poet, an artist, a man in some way superior to the crowd\nof men. But she intended to choose him,--not to give him her heart, her\nlife, her infinite tenderness freed from the trammels of passion, until\nshe had carefully and deeply studied him.\n\nShe began this pretty romance by simply enjoying it. Profound\ntranquillity settled down upon her soul. Her cheeks took on a soft\ncolor; and she became the beautiful and noble image of Germany, such as\nwe have lately seen her, the glory of the Chalet, the pride of Madame\nLatournelle and the Dumays. Modeste was living a double existence. She\nperformed with humble, loving care all the minute duties of the homely\nlife at the Chalet, using them as a rein to guide the poetry of her\nideal life, like the Carthusian monks who labor methodically on material\nthings to leave their souls the freer to develop in prayer. All great\nminds have bound themselves to some form of mechanical toil to obtain\ngreater mastery of thought. Spinosa ground glasses for spectacles; Bayle\ncounted the tiles on the roof; Montesquieu gardened. The body being thus\nsubdued, the soul could spread its wings in all security.\n\nMadame Mignon, reading her daughter's soul, was therefore right. Modeste\nloved; she loved with that rare platonic love, so little understood, the\nfirst illusion of a young girl, the most delicate of all sentiments, a\nvery dainty of the heart. She drank deep draughts from the chalice of\nthe unknown, the vague, the visionary. She admired the blue plumage of\nthe bird that sings afar in the paradise of young girls, which no hand\ncan touch, no gun can cover, as it flits across the sight; she loved\nthose magic colors, like sparkling jewels dazzling to the eye, which\nyouth can see, and never sees again when Reality, the hideous hag,\nappears with witnesses accompanied by the mayor. To live the very poetry\nof love and not to see the lover--ah, what sweet intoxication! what\nvisionary rapture! a chimera with flowing man and outspread wings!\n\nThe following is the puerile and even silly event which decided the\nfuture life of this young girl.\n\nModeste happened to see in a bookseller's window a lithographic portrait\nof one of her favorites, Canalis. We all know what lies such pictures\ntell,--being as they are the result of a shameless speculation, which\nseizes upon the personality of celebrated individuals as if their faces\nwere public property.\n\nIn this instance Canalis, sketched in a Byronic pose, was offering to\npublic admiration his dark locks floating in the breeze, a bare throat,\nand the unfathomable brow which every bard ought to possess. Victor\nHugo's forehead will make more persons shave their heads than the\nnumber of incipient marshals ever killed by the glory of Napoleon.\nThis portrait of Canalis (poetic through mercantile necessity) caught\nModeste's eye. The day on which it caught her eye one of Arthez's best\nbooks happened to be published. We are compelled to admit, though it may\nbe to Modeste's injury, that she hesitated long between the illustrious\npoet and the illustrious prose-writer. Which of these celebrated men was\nfree?--that was the question.\n\nModeste began by securing the co-operation of Francoise Cochet, a maid\ntaken from Havre and brought back again by poor Bettina, whom Madame\nMignon and Madame Dumay now employed by the day, and who lived in Havre.\nModeste took her to her own room and assured her that she would never\ncause her parents any grief, never pass the bounds of a young girl's\npropriety, and that as to Francoise herself she would be well provided\nfor after the return of Monsieur Mignon, on condition that she would do\na certain service and keep it an inviolable secret. What was it? Why, a\nnothing--perfectly innocent. All that Modeste wanted of her accomplice\nwas to put certain letters into the post at Havre and to bring some\nback which would be directed to herself, Francoise Cochet. The treaty\nconcluded, Modeste wrote a polite note to Dauriat, publisher of the\npoems of Canalis, asking, in the interest of that great poet, for some\nparticulars about him, among others if he were married. She requested\nthe publisher to address his answer to Mademoiselle Francoise, \"poste\nrestante,\" Havre.\n\nDauriat, incapable of taking the epistle seriously, wrote a reply in\npresence of four or five journalists who happened to be in his office\nat the time, each of whom added his particular stroke of wit to the\nproduction.\n\n  Mademoiselle,--Canalis (Baron of), Constant Cys Melchior, member\n  of the French Academy, born in 1800, at Canalis (Correze), five\n  feet four inches in height, of good standing, vaccinated, spotless\n  birth, has given a substitute to the conscription, enjoys perfect\n  health, owns a small patrimonial estate in the Correze, and wishes\n  to marry, but the lady must be rich.\n\n  He beareth per pale, gules an axe or, sable three escallops\n  argent, surmounted by a baron's coronet; supporters, two larches,\n  vert. Motto: \"Or et fer\" (no allusion to Ophir or auriferous).\n\n  The original Canalis, who went to the Holy Land with the First\n  Crusade, is cited in the chronicles of Auvergne as being armed\n  with an axe on account of the family indigence, which to this day\n  weighs heavily on the race. This noble baron, famous for\n  discomfiting a vast number of infidels, died, without \"or\" or\n  \"fer,\" as naked as a worm, near Jerusalem, on the plains of\n  Ascalon, ambulances not being then invented.\n\n  The chateau of Canalis (the domain yields a few chestnuts)\n  consists of two dismantled towers, united by a piece of wall\n  covered by a fine ivy, and is taxed at twenty-two francs.\n\n  The undersigned (publisher) calls attention to the fact that he\n  pays ten thousand francs for every volume of poetry written by\n  Monsieur de Canalis, who does not give his shells, or his nuts\n  either, for nothing.\n\n  The chanticler of the Correze lives in the rue de\n  Paradis-Poissoniere, number 29, which is a highly suitable\n  location for a poet of the angelic school. Letters must be\n  _post-paid_.\n\n  Noble dames of the faubourg Saint-Germain are said to take the\n  path to Paradise and protect its god. The king, Charles X., thinks\n  so highly of this great poet as to believe him capable of\n  governing the country; he has lately made him officer of the\n  Legion of honor, and (what pays him better) president of the court\n  of Claims at the foreign office. These functions do not hinder\n  this great genius from drawing an annuity out of the fund for the\n  encouragement of the arts and belles letters.\n\n  The last edition of the works of Canalis, printed on vellum, royal\n  8vo, from the press of Didot, with illustrations by Bixiou, Joseph\n  Bridau, Schinner, Sommervieux, etc., is in five volumes, price,\n  nine francs post-paid.\n\nThis letter fell like a cobble-stone on a tulip. A poet, secretary\nof claims, getting a stipend in a public office, drawing an\nannuity, seeking a decoration, adored by the women of the faubourg\nSaint-Germain--was that the muddy minstrel lingering along the quays,\nsad, dreamy, worn with toil, and re-entering his garret fraught with\npoetry? However, Modeste perceived the irony of the envious bookseller,\nwho dared to say, \"I invented Canalis; I made Nathan!\" Besides, she\nre-read her hero's poems,--verses extremely seductive, insincere, and\nhypocritical, which require a word of analysis, were it only to explain\nher infatuation.\n\nCanalis may be distinguished from Lamartine, chief of the angelic\nschool, by a wheedling tone like that of a sick-nurse, a treacherous\nsweetness, and a delightful correctness of diction. If the chief with\nhis strident cry is an eagle, Canalis, rose and white, is a flamingo.\nIn him women find the friend they seek, their interpreter, a being who\nunderstands them, who explains them to themselves, and a safe confidant.\nThe wide margins given by Didot to the last edition were crowded with\nModeste's pencilled sentiments, expressing her sympathy with this tender\nand dreamy spirit. Canalis does not possess the gift of life; he cannot\nbreathe existence into his creations; but he knows how to calm vague\nsufferings like those which assailed Modeste. He speaks to young girls\nin their own language; he can allay the anguish of a bleeding wound\nand lull the moans, even the sobs of woe. His gift lies not in stirring\nwords, nor in the remedy of strong emotions, he contents himself with\nsaying in harmonious tones which compel belief, \"I suffer with you; I\nunderstand you; come with me; let us weep together beside the brook,\nbeneath the willows.\" And they follow him! They listen to his empty and\nsonorous poetry like infants to a nurse's lullaby. Canalis, like Nodier,\nenchants the reader by an artlessness which is genuine in the prose\nwriter and artificial in the poet, by his tact, his smile, the shedding\nof his rose-leaves, in short by his infantile philosophy. He imitates\nso well the language of our early youth that he leads us back to\nthe prairie-land of our illusions. We can be pitiless to the eagles,\nrequiring from them the quality of the diamond, incorruptible\nperfection; but as for Canalis, we take him for what he is and let the\nrest go. He seems a good fellow; the affectations of the angelic school\nhave answered his purpose and succeeded, just as a woman succeeds when\nshe plays the ingenue cleverly, and simulates surprise, youth, innocence\nbetrayed, in short, the wounded angel.\n\nModeste, recovering her first impression, renewed her confidence in\nthat soul, in that countenance as ravishing as the face of Bernardin de\nSaint-Pierre. She paid no further attention to the publisher. And so,\nabout the beginning of the month of August she wrote the following\nletter to this Dorat of the sacristy, who still ranks as a star of the\nmodern Pleiades.\n\n  To Monsieur de Canalis,--Many a time, monsieur, I have wished to\n  write to you; and why? Surely you guess why,--to tell you how much\n  I admire your genius. Yes, I feel the need of expressing to you\n  the admiration of a poor country girl, lonely in her little\n  corner, whose only happiness is to read your thoughts. I have read\n  Rene, and I come to you. Sadness leads to reverie. How many other\n  women are sending you the homage of their secret thoughts? What\n  chance have I for notice among so many? This paper, filled with my\n  soul,--can it be more to you than the perfumed letters which\n  already beset you. I come to you with less grace than others, for\n  I wish to remain unknown and yet to receive your entire confidence\n  --as though you had long known me.\n\n  Answer my letter and be friendly with me. I cannot promise to make\n  myself known to you, though I do not positively say I will not\n  some day do so.\n\n  What shall I add? Read between the lines of this letter, monsieur,\n  the great effort which I am making: permit me to offer you my\n  hand,--that of a friend, ah! a true friend.\n\n  Your servant,       O. d'Este M.\n\n\n  P.S.--If you do me the favor to answer this letter address your\n  reply, if you please, to Mademoiselle F. Cochet, \"poste restante,\"\n  Havre.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. A POET OF THE ANGELIC SCHOOL\n\n\nAll young girls, romantic or otherwise, can imagine the impatience in\nwhich Modeste lived for the next few days. The air was full of tongues\nof fire. The trees were like a plumage. She was not conscious of a body;\nshe hovered in space, the earth melted away under her feet. Full of\nadmiration for the post-office, she followed her little sheet of paper\non its way; she was happy, as we all are happy at twenty years of age,\nin the first exercise of our will. She was possessed, as in the middle\nages. She made pictures in her mind of the poet's abode, of his\nstudy; she saw him unsealing her letter; and then followed myriads of\nsuppositions.\n\nAfter sketching the poetry we cannot do less than give the profile of\nthe poet. Canalis is a short, spare man, with an air of good-breeding, a\ndark-complexioned, moon-shaped face, and a rather mean head like that\nof a man who has more vanity than pride. He loves luxury, rank, and\nsplendor. Money is of more importance to him than to most men. Proud of\nhis birth, even more than of his talent, he destroys the value of his\nancestors by making too much of them in the present day,--after all,\nthe Canalis are not Navarreins, nor Cadignans, nor Grandlieus. Nature,\nhowever, helps him out in his pretensions. He has those eyes of Eastern\neffulgence which we demand in a poet, a delicate charm of manner, and a\nvibrant voice; yet a taint of natural charlatanism destroys the effect\nof nearly all these advantages; he is a born comedian. If he puts\nforward his well-shaped foot, it is because the attitude has become\na habit; if he uses exclamatory terms they are part of himself; if he\nposes with high dramatic action he has made that deportment his second\nnature. Such defects as these are not incompatible with a general\nbenevolence and a certain quality of errant and purely ideal chivalry,\nwhich distinguishes the paladin from the knight. Canalis has not\ndevotion enough for a Don Quixote, but he has too much elevation of\nthought not to put himself on the nobler side of questions and things.\nHis poetry, which takes the town by storm on all profitable occasions,\nreally injures the man as a poet; for he is not without mind, but\nhis talent prevents him from developing it; he is overweighted by his\nreputation, and is always aiming to make himself appear greater than he\nhas the credit of being. Thus, as often happens, the man is entirely out\nof keeping with the products of his thought. The author of these naive,\ncaressing, tender little lyrics, these calm idylls pure and cold as the\nsurface of a lake, these verses so essentially feminine, is an ambitious\nlittle creature in a tightly buttoned frock-coat, with the air of\na diplomat seeking political influence, smelling of the musk of\naristocracy, full of pretension, thirsting for money, already spoiled by\nsuccess in two directions, and wearing the double wreath of myrtle and\nof laurel. A government situation worth eight thousand francs, three\nthousand francs' annuity from the literary fund, two thousand from the\nAcademy, three thousand more from the paternal estate (less the taxes\nand the cost of keeping it in order),--a total fixed income of fifteen\nthousand francs, plus the ten thousand bought in, one year with another,\nby his poetry; in all twenty-five thousand francs,--this for Modeste's\nhero was so precarious and insufficient an income that he usually spent\nfive or six thousand francs more every year; but the king's privy purse\nand the secret funds of the foreign office had hitherto supplied the\ndeficit. He wrote a hymn for the king's coronation which earned him a\nwhole silver service,--having refused a sum of money on the ground that\na Canalis owed his duty to his sovereign.\n\nBut about this time Canalis had, as the journalists say, exhausted his\nbudget. He felt himself unable to invent any new form of poetry; his\nlyre did not have seven strings, it had one; and having played on that\none string so long, the public allowed him no other alternative but to\nhang himself with it, or to hold his tongue. De Marsay, who did not\nlike Canalis, made a remark whose poisoned shaft touched the poet to\nthe quick of his vanity. \"Canalis,\" he said, \"always reminds me of that\nbrave man whom Frederic the Great called up and commended after a battle\nbecause his trumpet had never ceased tooting its one little tune.\"\nCanalis's ambition was to enter political life, and he made capital of a\njourney he had taken to Madrid as secretary to the embassy of the Duc\nde Chaulieu, though it was really made, according to Parisian gossip, in\nthe capacity of \"attache to the duchess.\" How many times a sarcasm or a\nsingle speech has decided the whole course of a man's life. Colla,\nthe late president of the Cisalpine republic, and the best lawyer in\nPiedmont, was told by a friend when he was forty years of age that\nhe knew nothing of botany. He was piqued, became a second Jussieu,\ncultivated flowers, and compiled and published \"The Flora of Piedmont,\"\nin Latin, a labor of ten years. \"I'll master De Marsay some of these\ndays!\" thought the crushed poet; \"after all, Canning and Chateaubriand\nare both in politics.\"\n\nCanalis would gladly have brought forth some great political poem, but\nhe was afraid of the French press, whose criticisms are savage upon any\nwriter who takes four alexandrines to express one idea. Of all the poets\nof our day only three, Hugo, Theophile Gautier, and De Vigny, have been\nable to win the double glory of poet and prose-writer, like Racine and\nVoltaire, Moliere, and Rabelais,--a rare distinction in the literature\nof France, which ought to give a man a right to the crowning title of\npoet.\n\nSo then, the bard of the faubourg Saint-Germain was doing a wise thing\nin trying to house his little chariot under the protecting roof of the\npresent government. When he became president of the court of Claims at\nthe foreign office, he stood in need of a secretary,--a friend who could\ntake his place in various ways; cook up his interests with publishers,\nsee to his glory in the newspapers, help him if need be in politics,--in\nshort, a cat's paw and satellite. In Paris many men of celebrity in art,\nscience, and literature have one or more train-bearers, captains of\nthe guard, chamberlains as it were, who live in the sunshine of their\npresence,--aides-de-camp entrusted with delicate missions, allowing\nthemselves to be compromised if necessary; workers round the pedestal\nof the idol; not exactly his servants, nor yet his equals; bold in\nhis defence, first in the breach, covering all retreats, busy with his\nbusiness, and devoted to him just so long as their illusions last,\nor until the moment when they have got all they wanted. Some of these\nsatellites perceive the ingratitude of their great man; others feel that\nthey are simply made tools of; many weary of the life; very few remain\ncontented with that sweet equality of feeling and sentiment which is\nthe only reward that should be looked for in an intimacy with a superior\nman,--a reward that contented Ali when Mohammed raised him to himself.\n\nMany of these men, misled by vanity, think themselves quite as capable\nas their patron. Pure devotion, such as Modeste conceived it, without\nmoney and without price, and more especially without hope, is rare.\nNevertheless there are Mennevals to be found, more perhaps in Paris\nthan elsewhere, men who value a life in the background with its peaceful\ntoil; these are the wandering Benedictines of our social world, which\noffers them no other monastery. These brave, meek hearts live, by their\nactions and in their hidden lives, the poetry that poets utter. They\nare poets themselves in soul, in tenderness, in their lonely vigils and\nmeditations,--as truly poets as others of the name on paper, who fatten\nin the fields of literature at so much a verse; like Lord Byron, like\nall who live, alas, by ink, the Hippocrene water of to-day, for want of\na better.\n\nAttracted by the fame of Canalis, also by the prospect of political\ninterest, and advised thereto by Madame d'Espard, who acted in the\nmatter for the Duchesse de Chaulieu, a young lawyer of the court\nof Claims became secretary and confidential friend of the poet, who\nwelcomed and petted him very much as a broker caresses his first dabbler\nin the funds. The beginning of this companionship bore a very fair\nresemblance to friendship. The young man had already held the same\nrelation to a minister, who went out of office in 1827, taking care\nbefore he did so to appoint his young secretary to a place in the\nforeign office. Ernest de La Briere, then about twenty-seven years of\nage, was decorated with the Legion of honor but was without other means\nthan his salary; he was accustomed to the management of business and\nhad learned a good deal of life during his four years in a minister's\ncabinet. Kindly, amiable, and over-modest, with a heart full of pure and\nsound feelings, he was averse to putting himself in the foreground. He\nloved his country, and wished to serve her, but notoriety abashed him.\nTo him the place of secretary to a Napoleon was far more desirable\nthan that of the minister himself. As soon as he became the friend and\nsecretary of Canalis he did a great amount of labor for him, but by the\nend of eighteen months he had learned to understand the barrenness of\na nature that was poetic through literary expression only. The truth of\nthe old proverb, \"The cowl doesn't make the monk,\" is eminently shown in\nliterature. It is extremely rare to find among literary men a nature\nand a talent that are in perfect accord. The faculties are not the man\nhimself. This disconnection, whose phenomena are amazing, proceeds\nfrom an unexplored, possibly an unexplorable mystery. The brain and its\nproducts of all kinds (for in art the hand of man is a continuation of\nhis brain) are a world apart, which flourishes beneath the cranium in\nabsolute independence of sentiments, feelings, and all that is called\nvirtue, the virtue of citizens, fathers, and private life. This, however\ntrue, is not absolutely so; nothing is absolutely true of man. It is\ncertain that a debauched man will dissipate his talent, that a drunkard\nwill waste it in libations; while, on the other hand, no man can give\nhimself talent by wholesome living: nevertheless, it is all but proved\nthat Virgil, the painter of love, never loved a Dido, and that\nRousseau, the model citizen, had enough pride to had furnished forth an\naristocracy. On the other hand Raphael and Michael Angelo do present the\nglorious conjunction of genius with the lines of character. Talent\nin men is therefore, in all moral points, very much what beauty is in\nwomen,--simply a promise. Let us, therefore, doubly admire the man in\nwhom both heart and character equal the perfection of his genius.\n\nWhen Ernest discovered within his poet an ambitious egoist, the worst\nspecies of egoist (for there are some amiable forms of the vice), he\nfelt a delicacy in leaving him. Honest natures cannot easily break the\nties that bind them, especially if they have tied them voluntarily. The\nsecretary was therefore still living in domestic relations with the\npoet when Modeste's letter arrived,--in such relations, be it said, as\ninvolved a perpetual sacrifice of his feelings. La Briere admitted the\nfrankness with which Canalis had laid himself bare before him. Moreover,\nthe defects of the man, who will always be considered a great poet\nduring his lifetime and flattered as Martmontel was flattered, were only\nthe wrong side of his brilliant qualities. Without his vanity and his\nmagniloquence it is possible that he might never have acquired the\nsonorous elocution which is so useful and even necessary an instrument\nin political life. His cold-bloodedness touched at certain points on\nrectitude and loyalty; his ostentation had a lining of generosity.\nResults, we must remember, are to the profit of society; motives concern\nGod.\n\nBut after the arrival of Modeste's letter Ernest deceived himself no\nlonger as to Canalis. The pair had just finished breakfast and were\ntalking together in the poet's study, which was on the ground-floor of a\nhouse standing back in a court-yard, and looked into a garden.\n\n\"There!\" exclaimed Canalis, \"I was telling Madame de Chaulieu the\nother day that I ought to bring out another poem; I knew admiration was\nrunning short, for I have had no anonymous letters for a long time.\"\n\n\"Is it from an unknown woman?\"\n\n\"Unknown? yes!--a D'Este, in Havre; evidently a feigned name.\"\n\nCanalis passed the letter to La Briere. The little poem, with all its\nhidden enthusiasms, in short, poor Modeste's heart, was disdainfully\nhanded over, with the gesture of a spoiled dandy.\n\n\"It is a fine thing,\" said the lawyer, \"to have the power to attract\nsuch feelings; to force a poor woman to step out of the habits which\nnature, education, and the world dictate to her, to break through\nconventions. What privileges genius wins! A letter such as this, written\nby a young girl--a genuine young girl--without hidden meanings, with\nreal enthusiasm--\"\n\n\"Well, what?\" said Canalis.\n\n\"Why, a man might suffer as much as Tasso and yet feel recompensed,\"\ncried La Briere.\n\n\"So he might, my dear fellow, by a first letter of that kind, and even a\nsecond; but how about the thirtieth? And suppose you find out that these\nyoung enthusiasts are little jades? Or imagine a poet rushing along the\nbrilliant path in search of her, and finding at the end of it an old\nEnglishwoman sitting on a mile-stone and offering you her hand! Or\nsuppose this post-office angel should really be a rather ugly girl in\nquest of a husband? Ah, my boy! the effervescence then goes down.\"\n\n\"I begin to perceive,\" said La Briere, smiling, \"that there is something\npoisonous in glory, as there is in certain dazzling flowers.\"\n\n\"And then,\" resumed Canalis, \"all these women, even when they are\nsimple-minded, have ideals, and you can't satisfy them. They never say\nto themselves that a poet is a vain man, as I am accused of being; they\ncan't conceive what it is for an author to be at the mercy of a feverish\nexcitement, which makes him disagreeable and capricious; they want him\nalways grand, noble; it never occurs to them that genius is a disease,\nor that Nathan lives with Florine; that D'Arthez is too fat, and Joseph\nBridau is too thin; that Beranger limps, and that their own particular\ndeity may have the snuffles! A Lucien de Rubempre, poet and cupid, is a\nphoenix. And why should I go in search of compliments only to pull the\nstring of a shower-bath of horrid looks from some disillusioned female?\"\n\n\"Then the true poet,\" said La Briere, \"ought to remain hidden, like God,\nin the centre of his worlds, and be only seen in his own creations.\"\n\n\"Glory would cost too dear in that case,\" answered Canalis. \"There is\nsome good in life. As for that letter,\" he added, taking a cup of tea,\n\"I assure you that when a noble and beautiful woman loves a poet she\ndoes not hide in the corner boxes, like a duchess in love with an actor;\nshe feels that her beauty, her fortune, her name are protection enough,\nand she dares to say openly, like an epic poem: 'I am the nymph Calypso,\nenamored of Telemachus.' Mystery and feigned names are the resources of\nlittle minds. For my part I no longer answer masks--\"\n\n\"I should love a woman who came to seek me,\" cried La Briere. \"To all\nyou say I reply, my dear Canalis, that it cannot be an ordinary girl who\naspires to a distinguished man; such a girl has too little trust, too\nmuch vanity; she is too faint-hearted. Only a star, a--\"\n\n\"--princess!\" cried Canalis, bursting into a shout of laughter; \"only a\nprincess can descend to him. My dear fellow, that doesn't happen once\nin a hundred years. Such a love is like that flower that blossoms every\ncentury. Princesses, let me tell you, if they are young, rich, and\nbeautiful, have something else to think of; they are surrounded\nlike rare plants by a hedge of fools, well-bred idiots as hollow as\nelder-bushes! My dream, alas! the crystal of my dream, garlanded from\nhence to the Correze with roses--ah! I cannot speak of it--it is in\nfragments at my feet, and has long been so. No, no, all anonymous\nletters are begging letters; and what sort of begging? Write yourself to\nthat young woman, if you suppose her young and pretty, and you'll find\nout. There is nothing like experience. As for me, I can't reasonably be\nexpected to love every woman; Apollo, at any rate he of Belvedere, is a\ndelicate consumptive who must take care of his health.\"\n\n\"But when a woman writes to you in this way her excuse must certainly\nbe in her consciousness that she is able to eclipse in tenderness and\nbeauty every other woman,\" said Ernest, \"and I should think you might\nfeel some curiosity--\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Canalis, \"permit me, my juvenile friend, to abide by the\nbeautiful duchess who is all my joy.\"\n\n\"You are right, you are right!\" cried Ernest. However, the young\nsecretary read and re-read Modeste's letter, striving to guess the mind\nof its hidden writer.\n\n\"There is not the least fine-writing here,\" he said, \"she does not even\ntalk of your genius; she speaks to your heart. In your place I should\nfeel tempted by this fragrance of modesty,--this proposed agreement--\"\n\n\"Then, sign it!\" cried Canalis, laughing; \"answer the letter and go to\nthe end of the adventure yourself. You shall tell me the results three\nmonths hence--if the affair lasts so long.\"\n\nFour days later Modeste received the following letter, written on\nextremely fine paper, protected by two envelopes, and sealed with the\narms of Canalis.\n\n  Mademoiselle,--The admiration for fine works (allowing that my\n  books are such) implies something so lofty and sincere as to\n  protect you from all light jesting, and to justify before the\n  sternest judge the step you have taken in writing to me.\n\n  But first I must thank you for the pleasure which such proofs of\n  sympathy afford, even though we may not merit them,--for the maker\n  of verses and the true poet are equally certain of the intrinsic\n  worth of their writings,--so readily does self-esteem lend itself\n  to praise. The best proof of friendship that I can give to an\n  unknown lady in exchange for a faith which allays the sting of\n  criticism, is to share with her the harvest of my own experience,\n  even at the risk of dispelling her most vivid illusions.\n\n  Mademoiselle, the noblest adornment of a young girl is the flower\n  of a pure and saintly and irreproachable life. Are you alone in\n  the world? If you are, there is no need to say more. But if you\n  have a family, a father or a mother, think of all the sorrow that\n  might come to them from such a letter as yours addressed to a poet\n  of whom you know nothing personally. All writers are not angels;\n  they have many defects. Some are frivolous, heedless, foppish,\n  ambitious, dissipated; and, believe me, no matter how imposing\n  innocence may be, how chivalrous a poet is, you will meet with\n  many a degenerate troubadour in Paris ready to cultivate your\n  affection only to betray it. By such a man your letter would be\n  interpreted otherwise than it is by me. He would see a thought\n  that is not in it, which you, in your innocence, have not\n  suspected. There are as many natures as there are writers. I am\n  deeply flattered that you have judged me capable of understanding\n  you; but had you, perchance, fallen upon a hypocrite, a scoffer,\n  one whose books may be melancholy but whose life is a perpetual\n  carnival, you would have found as the result of your generous\n  imprudence an evil-minded man, the frequenter of green-rooms,\n  perhaps a hero of some gay resort. In the bower of clematis where\n  you dream of poets, can you smell the odor of the cigar which\n  drives all poetry from the manuscript?\n\n  But let us look still further. How could the dreamy, solitary life\n  you lead, doubtless by the sea-shore, interest a poet, whose\n  mission it is to imagine all, and to paint all? What reality can\n  equal imagination? The young girls of the poets are so ideal that\n  no living daughter of Eve can compete with them. And now tell me,\n  what will you gain,--you, a young girl, brought up to be the\n  virtuous mother of a family,--if you learn to comprehend the\n  terrible agitations of a poet's life in this dreadful capital,\n  which may be defined by one sentence,--the hell in which men love.\n\n  If the desire to brighten the monotonous existence of a young girl\n  thirsting for knowledge has led you to take your pen in hand and\n  write to me, has not the step itself the appearance of\n  degradation? What meaning am I to give to your letter? Are you one\n  of a rejected caste, and do you seek a friend far away from you?\n  Or, are you afflicted with personal ugliness, yet feeling within\n  you a noble soul which can give and receive a confidence? Alas,\n  alas, the conclusion to be drawn is grievous. You have said too\n  much, or too little; you have gone too far, or not far enough.\n  Either let us drop this correspondence, or, if you continue it,\n  tell me more than in the letter you have now written me.\n\n  But, mademoiselle, if you are young, if you are beautiful, if you\n  have a home, a family, if in your heart you have the precious\n  ointment, the spikenard, to pour out, as did Magdalene on the feet\n  of Jesus, let yourself be won by a man worthy of you; become what\n  every pure young girl should be,--a good woman, the virtuous\n  mother of a family. A poet is the saddest conquest that a girl can\n  make; he is full of vanity, full of angles that will sharply wound\n  a woman's proper pride, and kill a tenderness which has no\n  experience of life. The wife of a poet should love him long before\n  she marries him; she must train herself to the charity of angels,\n  to their forbearance, to all the virtues of motherhood. Such\n  qualities, mademoiselle, are but germs in a young girl.\n\n  Hear the whole truth,--do I not owe it to you in return for your\n  intoxicating flattery? If it is a glorious thing to marry a great\n  renown, remember also that you must soon discover a superior man\n  to be, in all that makes a man, like other men. He therefore\n  poorly realizes the hopes that attach to him as a phoenix. He\n  becomes like a woman whose beauty is over-praised, and of whom we\n  say: \"I thought her far more lovely.\" She has not warranted the\n  portrait painted by the fairy to whom I owe your letter,--the\n  fairy whose name is Imagination.\n\n  Believe me, the qualities of the mind live and thrive only in a\n  sphere invisible, not in daily life; the wife of a poet bears the\n  burden; she sees the jewels manufactured, but she never wears\n  them. If the glory of the position fascinates you, hear me now\n  when I tell you that its pleasures are soon at an end. You will\n  suffer when you find so many asperities in a nature which, from a\n  distance, you thought equable, and such coldness at the shining\n  summit. Moreover, as women never set their feet within the world\n  of real difficulties, they cease to appreciate what they once\n  admired as soon as they think they see the inner mechanism of it.\n\n  I close with a last thought, in which there is no disguised\n  entreaty; it is the counsel of a friend. The exchange of souls can\n  take place only between persons who are resolved to hide nothing\n  from each other. Would you show yourself for such as you are to an\n  unknown man? I dare not follow out the consequences of that idea.\n\n  Deign to accept, mademoiselle, the homage which we owe to all\n  women, even those who are disguised and masked.\n\nSo this was the letter she had worn between her flesh and her corset\nabove her palpitating heart throughout one whole day! For this she had\npostponed the reading until the midnight hour when the household slept,\nwaiting for the solemn silence with the eager anxiety of an imagination\non fire! For this she had blessed the poet by anticipation, reading a\nthousand letters ere she opened one,--fancying all things, except this\ndrop of cold water falling upon the vaporous forms of her illusion, and\ndissolving them as prussic acid dissolves life. What could she do but\nhide herself in her bed, blow out her candle, bury her face in the\nsheets and weep?\n\nAll this happened during the first days of July. But Modeste presently\ngot up, walked across the room and opened the window. She wanted air.\nThe fragrance of the flowers came to her with the peculiar freshness of\nthe odors of the night. The sea, lighted by the moon, sparkled like a\nmirror. A nightingale was singing in a tree. \"Ah, there is the poet!\"\nthought Modeste, whose anger subsided at once. Bitter reflections chased\neach other through her mind. She was cut to the quick; she wished to\nre-read the letter, and lit a candle; she studied the sentences so\ncarefully studied when written; and ended by hearing the wheezing voice\nof the outer world.\n\n\"He is right, and I am wrong,\" she said to herself. \"But who could ever\nbelieve that under the starry mantle of a poet I should find nothing but\none of Moliere's old men?\"\n\nWhen a woman or young girl is taken in the act, \"flagrante delicto,\" she\nconceives a deadly hatred to the witness, the author, or the object of\nher fault. And so the true, the single-minded, the untamed and untamable\nModeste conceived within her soul an unquenchable desire to get\nthe better of that righteous spirit, to drive him into some fatal\ninconsistency, and so return him blow for blow. This girl, this\nchild, as we may call her, so pure, whose head alone had been\nmisguided,--partly by her reading, partly by her sister's sorrows, and\nmore perhaps by the dangerous meditations of her solitary life,--was\nsuddenly caught by a ray of sunshine flickering across her face. She had\nbeen standing for three hours on the shores of the vast sea of Doubt.\nNights like these are never forgotten. Modeste walked straight to\nher little Chinese table, a gift from her father, and wrote a letter\ndictated by the infernal spirit of vengeance which palpitates in the\nhearts of young girls.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. BLADE TO BLADE\n\n  To Monsieur de Canalis:\n\n  Monsieur,--You are certainly a great poet, and you are something\n  more,--an honest man. After showing such loyal frankness to a\n  young girl who was stepping to the verge of an abyss, have you\n  enough left to answer without hypocrisy or evasion the following\n  question?\n\n  Would you have written the letter I now hold in answer to mine,\n  --would your ideas, your language have been the same,--had some\n  one whispered in your ear (what may prove true), Mademoiselle O.\n  d'Este M. has six millions and does intend to have a dunce for a\n  master?\n\n  Admit the supposition for a moment. Be with me what you are with\n  yourself; fear nothing. I am wiser than my twenty years; nothing\n  that is frank can hurt you in my mind. When I have read your\n  confidence, if you deign to make it, you shall receive from me an\n  answer to your first letter.\n\n  Having admired your talent, often so sublime, permit me to do\n  homage to your delicacy and your integrity, which force me to\n  remain always,\n\nYour humble servant, O. d'Este M.\n\n\nWhen Ernest de La Briere had held this letter in his hands for some\nlittle time he went to walk along the boulevards, tossed in mind like a\ntiny vessel by a tempest when the wind is blowing from all points of the\ncompass. Most young men, specially true Parisians, would have settled\nthe matter in a single phrase, \"The girl is a little hussy.\" But for\na youth whose soul was noble and true, this attempt to put him, as it\nwere, upon his oath, this appeal to truth, had the power to awaken the\nthree judges hidden in the conscience of every man. Honor, Truth,\nand Justice, getting on their feet, cried out in their several ways\nenergetically.\n\n\"Ah, my dear Ernest,\" said Truth, \"you never would have read that lesson\nto a rich heiress. No, my boy; you would have gone in hot haste to Havre\nto find out if the girl were handsome, and you would have been very\nunhappy indeed at her preference for genius; and if you could\nhave tripped up your friend and supplanted him in her affections,\nMademoiselle d'Este would have been a divinity.\"\n\n\"What?\" cried Justice, \"are you not always bemoaning yourselves, you\npenniless men of wit and capacity, that rich girls marry beings whom you\nwouldn't take as your servants? You rail against the materialism of the\ncentury which hastens to join wealth to wealth, and never marries some\nfine young man with brains and no money to a rich girl. What an outcry\nyou make about it; and yet here is a young woman who revolts against\nthat very spirit of the age, and behold! the poet replies with a blow at\nher heart!\"\n\n\"Rich or poor, young or old, ugly or handsome, the girl is right; she\nhas sense and judgment, she has tripped you over into the slough of\nself-interest and lets you know it,\" cried Honor. \"She deserves an\nanswer, a sincere and loyal and frank answer, and, above all, the honest\nexpression of your thought. Examine yourself! sound your heart and purge\nit of its meannesses. What would Moliere's Alceste say?\"\n\nAnd La Briere, having started from the boulevard Poissoniere, walked so\nslowly, absorbed in these reflections, that he was more than an hour in\nreaching the boulevard des Capucines. Then he followed the quays, which\nled him to the Cour des Comptes, situated in that time close to the\nSaint-Chapelle. Instead of beginning on the accounts as he should have\ndone, he remained at the mercy of his perplexities.\n\n\"One thing is evident,\" he said to himself; \"she hasn't six millions;\nbut that's not the point--\"\n\nSix days later, Modeste received the following letter:\n\n  Mademoiselle,--You are not a D'Este. The name is a feigned one to\n  conceal your own. Do I owe the revelations which you solicit to a\n  person who is untruthful about herself? Question for question: Are\n  you of an illustrious family? or a noble family? or a middle-class\n  family? Undoubtedly ethics and morality cannot change; they are\n  one: but obligations vary in the different states of life. Just as\n  the sun lights up a scene diversely and produces differences which\n  we admire, so morality conforms social duty to rank, to position.\n  The peccadillo of a soldier is a crime in a general, and\n  vice-versa. Observances are not alike in all cases. They are not\n  the same for the gleaner in the field, for the girl who sews at\n  fifteen sous a day, for the daughter of a petty shopkeeper, for\n  the young bourgoise, for the child of a rich merchant, for the\n  heiress of a noble family, for a daughter of the house of Este. A\n  king must not stoop to pick up a piece of gold, but a laborer\n  ought to retrace his steps to find ten sous; though both are\n  equally bound to obey the laws of economy. A daughter of Este, who\n  is worth six millions, has the right to wear a broad-brimmed hat\n  and plume, to flourish her whip, press the flanks of her barb, and\n  ride like an amazon decked in gold lace, with a lackey behind her,\n  into the presence of a poet and say: \"I love poetry; and I would\n  fain expiate Leonora's cruelty to Tasso!\" but a daughter of the\n  people would cover herself with ridicule by imitating her. To what\n  class do you belong? Answer sincerely, and I will answer the\n  question you have put to me.\n\n  As I have not the honor of knowing you personally, and yet am\n  bound to you, in a measure, by the ties of poetic communion, I am\n  unwilling to offer any commonplace compliments. Perhaps you have\n  already won a malicious victory by thus embarrassing a maker of\n  books.\n\nThe young man was certainly not wanting in the sort of shrewdness which\nis permissible to a man of honor. By return courier he received an\nanswer:--\n\n  To Monsieur de Canalis,--You grow more and more sensible, my dear\n  poet. My father is a count. The chief glory of our house was a\n  cardinal, in the days when cardinals walked the earth by the side\n  of kings. I am the last of our family, which ends in me; but I\n  have the necessary quarterings to make my entry into any court or\n  chapter-house in Europe. We are quite the equals of the Canalis.\n  You will be so kind as to excuse me from sending you our arms.\n\n  Endeavor to answer me as truthfully as I have now answered you. I\n  await your response to know if I can then sign myself as I do now,\n\n  Your servant,       O. d'Este M.\n\n\n\"The little mischief! how she abuses her privileges,\" cried La Briere;\n\"but isn't she frank!\"\n\nNo young man can be four years private secretary to a cabinet minister,\nand live in Paris and observe the carrying on of many intrigues, with\nperfect impunity; in fact, the purest soul is more or less intoxicated\nby the heady atmosphere of the imperial city. Happy in the thought\nthat he was not Canalis, our young secretary engaged a place in the\nmail-coach for Havre, after writing a letter in which he announced that\nthe promised answer would be sent a few days later,--excusing the delay\non the ground of the importance of the confession and the pressure of\nhis duties at the ministry.\n\nHe took care to get from the director-general of the post-office a note\nto the postmaster at Havre, requesting secrecy and attention to his\nwishes. Ernest was thus enabled to see Francoise Cochet when she came\nfor the letters, and to follow her without exciting observation. Guided\nby her, he reached Ingouville and saw Modeste Mignon at the window of\nthe Chalet.\n\n\"Well, Francoise?\" he heard the young girl say, to which the maid\nresponded,--\n\n\"Yes, mademoiselle, I have one.\"\n\nStruck by the girl's great beauty, Ernest retraced his steps and asked a\nman on the street the name of the owner of that magnificent estate.\n\n\"That?\" said the man, nodding to the villa.\n\n\"Yes, my friend.\"\n\n\"Oh, that belongs to Monsieur Vilquin, the richest shipping merchant in\nHavre, so rich he doesn't know what he is worth.\"\n\n\"There is no Cardinal Vilquin that I know of in history,\" thought\nErnest, as he walked back to Havre for the night mail to Paris.\nNaturally he questioned the postmaster about the Vilquin family, and\nlearned that it possessed an enormous fortune. Monsieur Vilquin had\na son and two daughters, one of whom was married to Monsieur Althor,\njunior. Prudence kept La Briere from seeming anxious about the Vilquins;\nthe postmaster was already looking at him slyly.\n\n\"Is there there any one staying with them at the present moment,\" he\nasked, \"besides the family?\"\n\n\"The d'Herouville family is there just now. They do talk of a marriage\nbetween the young duke and the remaining Mademoiselle Vilquin.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" thought Ernest; \"there was a celebrated Cardinal d'Herouville\nunder the Valois, and a terrible marshal whom they made a duke in the\ntime of Henri IV.\"\n\nErnest returned to Paris having seen enough of Modeste to dream of her,\nand to think that, whether she were rich or whether she were poor, if\nshe had a noble soul he would like to make her Madame de La Briere; and\nso thinking, he resolved to continue the correspondence.\n\nAh! you poor women of France, try to remain hidden if you can; try\nto weave the least little romance about your lives in the midst of\na civilization which posts in the public streets the hours when the\ncoaches arrive and depart; which counts all letters and stamps them\ntwice over, first with the hour when they are thrown into the boxes, and\nnext with that of their delivery; which numbers the houses, prints the\ntax of every tenant on a metal register at the doors (after verifying\nits particulars), and will soon possess one vast register of every\ninch of its territory down to the smallest parcel of land, and the most\ninsignificant features of it,--a giant work ordained by a giant. Try,\nimprudent young ladies, to escape not only the eye of the police, but\nthe incessant chatter which takes place in a country town about the\nveriest trifles,--how many dishes the prefect has at his dessert,\nhow many slices of melon are left at the door of some small\nhouseholder,--which strains its ear to catch the chink of the gold a\nthrifty man lays by, and spends its evenings in calculating the incomes\nof the village and the town and the department. It was mere chance\nthat enabled Modeste to escape discovery through Ernest's reconnoitring\nexpedition,--a step which he already regretted; but what Parisian can\nallow himself to be the dupe of a little country girl? Incapable of\nbeing duped! that horrid maxim is the dissolvent of all noble sentiments\nin man.\n\nWe can readily guess the struggle of feeling to which this honest young\nfellow fell a prey when we read the letter that he now indited, in which\nevery stroke of the flail which scourged his conscience will be found to\nhave left its trace.\n\nThis is what Modeste read a few days later, as she sat by her window on\na fine summer's day:--\n\n  Mademoiselle,--Without hypocrisy or evasion, _yes_, if I had been\n  certain that you possessed an immense fortune I should have acted\n  differently. Why? I have searched for the reason; here it is. We\n  have within us an inborn feeling, inordinately developed by social\n  life, which drives us to the pursuit and to the possession of\n  happiness. Most men confound happiness with the means that lead to\n  it; money in their eyes is the chief element of happiness. I\n  should, therefore, have endeavored to win you, prompted by that\n  social sentiment which has in all ages made wealth a religion. At\n  least, I think I should. It is not to be expected of a man still\n  young that he can have the wisdom to substitute sound sense for\n  the pleasure of the senses; within sight of a prey the brutal\n  instincts hidden in the heart of man drive him on. Instead of that\n  lesson, I should have sent you compliments and flatteries. Should\n  I have kept my own esteem in so doing? I doubt it. Mademoiselle,\n  in such a case success brings absolution; but happiness? That is\n  another thing. Should I have distrusted my wife had I won her in\n  that way? Most assuredly I should. Your advance on me would sooner\n  or later have come between us. Your husband, however grand your\n  fancy may make him, would have ended by reproaching you for having\n  abased him. You, yourself, might have come, sooner or later, to\n  despise him. The strong man forgives, but the poet whines. Such,\n  mademoiselle, is the answer which my honesty compels me to make to\n  you.\n\n  And now, listen to me. You have the triumph of forcing me to\n  reflect deeply,--first on you, whom I do not sufficiently know;\n  next, on myself, of whom I knew too little. You have had the power\n  to stir up many of the evil thoughts which crouched in my heart,\n  as in all hearts; but from them something good and generous has\n  come forth, and I salute you with my most fervent benedictions,\n  just as at sea we salute the lighthouse which shows the rocks on\n  which we were about to perish. Here is my confession, for I would\n  not lose your esteem nor my own for all the treasures of earth.\n\n  I wished to know who you are. I have just returned from Havre,\n  where I saw Francoise Cochet, and followed her to Ingouville. You\n  are as beautiful as the woman of a poet's dream; but I do not know\n  if you are Mademoiselle Vilquin concealed under Mademoiselle\n  d'Herouville, or Mademoiselle d'Herouville hidden under\n  Mademoiselle Vilquin. Though all is fair in war, I blushed at such\n  spying and stopped short in my inquiries. You have roused my\n  curiosity; forgive me for being somewhat of a woman; it is, I\n  believe, the privilege of a poet.\n\n  Now that I have laid bare my heart and allowed you to read it, you\n  will believe in the sincerity of what I am about to add. Though\n  the glimpse I had of you was all too rapid, it has sufficed to\n  modify my opinion of your conduct. You are a poet and a poem, even\n  more than you are a woman. Yes, there is in you something more\n  precious than beauty; you are the beautiful Ideal of art, of\n  fancy. The step you took, blamable as it would be in an ordinary\n  young girl, allotted to an every-day destiny, has another aspect\n  if endowed with the nature which I now attribute to you. Among the\n  crowd of beings flung by fate into the social life of this planet\n  to make up a generation there are exceptional souls. If your\n  letter is the outcome of long poetic reveries on the fate which\n  conventions bring to women, if, constrained by the impulse of a\n  lofty and intelligent mind, you have wished to understand the life\n  of a man to whom you attribute the gift of genius, to the end that\n  you may create a friendship withdrawn from the ordinary relations\n  of life, with a soul in communion with your own, disregarding thus\n  the ordinary trammels of your sex,--then, assuredly, you are an\n  exception. The law which rightly limits the actions of the crowd\n  is too limited for you. But in that case, the remark in my first\n  letter returns in greater force,--you have done too much or not\n  enough.\n\n  Accept once more my thanks for the service you have rendered me,\n  that of compelling me to sound my heart. You have corrected in me\n  the false idea, only too common in France, that marriage should be\n  a means of fortune. While I struggled with my conscience a sacred\n  voice spoke to me. I swore solemnly to make my fortune myself, and\n  not be led by motives of cupidity in choosing the companion of my\n  life. I have also reproached myself for the blamable curiosity you\n  have excited in me. You have not six millions. There is no\n  concealment possible in Havre for a young lady who possesses such\n  a fortune; you would be discovered at once by the pack of hounds\n  of great families whom I see in Paris on the hunt after heiresses,\n  and who have already sent one, the grand equerry, the young duke,\n  among the Vilquins. Therefore, believe me, the sentiments I have\n  now expressed are fixed in my mind as a rule of life, from which I\n  have abstracted all influences of romance or of actual fact. Prove\n  to me, therefore, that you have one of those souls which may be\n  forgiven for its disobedience to the common law, by perceiving and\n  comprehending the spirit of this letter as you did that of my\n  first letter. If you are destined to a middle-class life, obey the\n  iron law which holds society together. Lifted in mind above other\n  women, I admire you; but if you seek to obey an impulse which you\n  ought to repress, I pity you. The all-wise moral of that great\n  domestic epic \"Clarissa Harlowe\" is that legitimate and honorable\n  love led the poor victim to her ruin because it was conceived,\n  developed, and pursued beyond the boundaries of family restraint.\n  The family, however cruel and even foolish it may be, is in the\n  right against the Lovelaces. The family is Society. Believe me,\n  the glory of a young girl, of a woman, must always be that of\n  repressing her most ardent impulses within the narrow sphere of\n  conventions. If I had a daughter able to become a Madame de Stael\n  I should wish her dead at fifteen. Can you imagine a daughter of\n  yours flaunting on the stage of fame, exhibiting herself to win\n  the plaudits of a crowd, and not suffer anguish at the thought? No\n  matter to what heights a woman can rise by the inward poetry of\n  her soul, she must sacrifice the outer signs of superiority on the\n  altar of her home. Her impulse, her genius, her aspirations toward\n  Good, the whole poem of a young girl's being, should belong to the\n  man she accepts and the children whom she brings into the world. I\n  think I perceive in you a secret desire to widen the narrow circle\n  of the life to which all women are condemned, and to put love and\n  passion into marriage. Ah! it is a lovely dream! it is not\n  impossible; it is difficult, but if realized, may it not be to the\n  despair of souls--forgive me the hackneyed word--\"incompris\"?\n\n  If you seek a platonic friendship it will be to your sorrow in\n  after years. If your letter was a jest, discontinue it. Perhaps\n  this little romance is to end here--is it? It has not been without\n  fruit. My sense of duty is aroused, and you, on your side, will\n  have learned something of Society. Turn your thoughts to real\n  life; throw the enthusiasms you have culled from literature into\n  the virtues of your sex.\n\n  Adieu, mademoiselle. Do me the honor to grant me your esteem.\n  Having seen you, or one whom I believe to be you, I have known\n  that your letter was simply natural; a flower so lovely turns to\n  the sun--of poetry. Yes, love poetry as you love flowers, music,\n  the grandeur of the sea, the beauties of nature; love them as an\n  adornment of the soul, but remember what I have had the honor of\n  telling you as to the nature of poets. Be cautious not to marry,\n  as you say, a dunce, but seek the partner whom God has made for\n  you. There are souls, believe me, who are fit to appreciate you,\n  and to make you happy. If I were rich, if you were poor, I would\n  lay my heart and my fortunes at your feet; for I believe your soul\n  to be full of riches and of loyalty; to you I could confide my\n  life and my honor in absolute security.\n\n  Once more, adieu, adieu, fairest daughter of Eve the fair.\n\nThe reading of this letter, swallowed like a drop of water in the\ndesert, lifted the mountain which weighed heavily on Modeste's heart:\nthen she saw the mistake she had made in arranging her plan, and\nrepaired it by giving Francoise some envelopes directed to herself, in\nwhich the maid could put the letters which came from Paris and drop them\nagain into the box. Modeste resolved to receive the postman herself on\nthe steps of the Chalet at the hour when he made his delivery.\n\nAs to the feelings that this reply, in which the noble heart of poor\nLa Briere beat beneath the brilliant phantom of Canalis, excited in\nModeste, they were as multifarious and confused as the waves which\nrushed to die along the shore while with her eyes fixed on the wide\nocean she gave herself up to the joy of having (if we dare say so)\nharpooned an angelic soul in the Parisian Gulf, of having divined that\nhearts of price might still be found in harmony with genius, and, above\nall, for having followed the magic voice of intuition.\n\nA vast interest was now about to animate her life. The wires of her cage\nwere broken: the bolts and bars of the pretty Chalet--where were they?\nHer thoughts took wings.\n\n\"Oh, father!\" she cried, looking out to the horizon. \"Come back and make\nus rich and happy.\"\n\nThe answer which Ernest de La Briere received some five days later will\ntell the reader more than any elaborate disquisition of ours.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. THE POWER OF THE UNSEEN\n\n  To Monsieur de Canalis:\n\n  My friend,--Suffer me to give you that name,--you have delighted\n  me; I would not have you other than you are in this letter, the\n  first--oh, may it not be the last! Who but a poet could have\n  excused and understood a young girl so delicately?\n\n  I wish to speak with the sincerity that dictated the first lines\n  of your letter. And first, let me say that most fortunately you do\n  not know me. I can joyfully assure you than I am neither that\n  hideous Mademoiselle Vilquin nor the very noble and withered\n  Mademoiselle d'Herouville who floats between twenty and forty\n  years of age, unable to decide on a satisfactory date. The\n  Cardinal d'Herouville flourished in the history of the Church at\n  least a century before the cardinal of whom we boast as our only\n  family glory,--for I take no account of lieutenant-generals, and\n  abbes who write trumpery little verses.\n\n  Moreover, I do not live in the magnificent villa Vilquin; there is\n  not in my veins, thank God, the ten-millionth of a drop of that\n  chilly blood which flows behind a counter. I come on one side from\n  Germany, on the other from the south of France; my mind has a\n  Teutonic love of reverie, my blood the vivacity of Provence. I am\n  noble on my father's and on my mother's side. On my mother's I\n  derive from every page of the Almanach de Gotha. In short, my\n  precautions are well taken. It is not in any man's power, nor even\n  in the power of the law, to unmask my incognito. I shall remain\n  veiled, unknown.\n\n  As to my person and as to my \"belongings,\" as the Normans say,\n  make yourself easy. I am at least as handsome as the little girl\n  (ignorantly happy) on whom your eyes chanced to light during your\n  visit to Havre; and I do not call myself poverty-stricken,\n  although ten sons of peers may not accompany me on my walks. I\n  have seen the humiliating comedy of the heiress sought for her\n  millions played on my account. In short, make no attempt, even on\n  a wager, to reach me. Alas! though free as air, I am watched and\n  guarded,--by myself, in the first place, and secondly, by people\n  of nerve and courage who would not hesitate to put a knife in your\n  heart if you tried to penetrate my retreat. I do not say this to\n  excite your courage or stimulate your curiosity; I believe I have\n  no need of such incentives to interest you and attach you to me.\n\n  I will now reply to the second edition, considerably enlarged, of\n  your first sermon.\n\n  Will you have a confession? I said to myself when I saw you so\n  distrustful, and mistaking me for Corinne (whose improvisations\n  bore me dreadfully), that in all probability dozes of Muses had\n  already led you, rashly curious, into their valleys, and begged\n  you to taste the fruits of their boarding-school Parnassus. Oh!\n  you are perfectly safe with me, my friend; I may love poetry, but\n  I have no little verses in my pocket-book, and my stockings are,\n  and will remain, immaculately white. You shall not be pestered\n  with the \"Flowers of my Heart\" in one or more volumes. And,\n  finally, should it ever happen that I say to you the word \"Come!\"\n  you will not find--you know it now--an old maid, no, nor a poor\n  and ugly one.\n\n  Ah! my friend, if you only knew how I regret that you came to\n  Havre! You have lowered the charm of what you call my romance. God\n  alone knew the treasure I was reserving for the man noble enough,\n  and trusting enough, and perspicacious enough to come--having\n  faith in my letters, having penetrated step by step into the\n  depths of my heart--to come to our first meeting with the\n  simplicity of a child: for that was what I dreamed to be the\n  innocence of a man of genius. And now you have spoiled my\n  treasure! But I forgive you; you live in Paris and, as you say,\n  there is always a man within a poet.\n\n  Because I tell you this will you think me some little girl who\n  cultivates a garden-full of illusions? You, who are witty and\n  wise, have you not guessed that when Mademoiselle d'Este received\n  your pedantic lesson she said to herself: \"No, dear poet, my first\n  letter was not the pebble which a vagabond child flings about the\n  highway to frighten the owner of the adjacent fruit-trees, but a\n  net carefully and prudently thrown by a fisherman seated on a rock\n  above the sea, hoping and expecting a miraculous draught.\"\n\n  All that you say so beautifully about the family has my approval.\n  The man who is able to please me, and of whom I believe myself\n  worthy, will have my heart and my life,--with the consent of my\n  parents, for I will neither grieve them, nor take them unawares:\n  happily, I am certain of reigning over them; and, besides, they\n  are wholly without prejudice. Indeed, in every way, I feel myself\n  protected against any delusions in my dream. I have built the\n  fortress with my own hands, and I have let it be fortified by the\n  boundless devotion of those who watch over me as if I were a\n  treasure,--not that I am unable to defend myself in the open, if\n  need be; for, let me say, circumstances have furnished me with\n  armor of proof on which is engraved the word \"Disdain.\" I have the\n  deepest horror of all that is calculating,--of all that is not\n  pure, disinterested, and wholly noble. I worship the beautiful,\n  the ideal, without being romantic; though I HAVE been, in my heart\n  of hearts, in my dreams. But I recognize the truth of the various\n  things, just even to vulgarity, which you have written me about\n  Society and social life.\n\n  For the time being we are, and we can only be, two friends. Why\n  seek an unseen friend? you ask. Your person may be unknown to me,\n  but your mind, your heart I _know_; they please me, and I feel an\n  infinitude of thoughts within my soul which need a man of genius\n  for their confidant. I do not wish the poem of my heart to be\n  wasted; I would have it known to you as it is to God. What a\n  precious thing is a true comrade, one to whom we can tell all! You\n  will surely not reject the unpublished leaflets of a young girl's\n  thoughts when they fly to you like the pretty insects fluttering\n  to the sun? I am sure you have never before met with this good\n  fortune of the soul,--the honest confidences of an honest girl.\n  Listen to her prattle; accept the music that she sings to you in\n  her own heart. Later, if our souls are sisters, if our characters\n  warrant the attempt, a white-haired old serving-man shall await\n  you by the wayside and lead you to the cottage, the villa, the\n  castle, the palace--I don't know yet what sort of bower it will\n  be, nor what its color, nor whether this conclusion will ever be\n  possible; but you will admit, will you not? that it is poetic, and\n  that Mademoiselle d'Este has a complying disposition. Has she not\n  left you free? Has she gone with jealous feet to watch you in the\n  salons of Paris? Has she imposed upon you the labors of some high\n  emprise, such as paladins sought voluntarily in the olden time?\n  No, she asks a perfectly spiritual and mystic alliance. Come to me\n  when you are unhappy, wounded, weary. Tell me all, hide nothing; I\n  have balms for all your ills. I am twenty years of age, dear\n  friend, but I have the sense of fifty, and unfortunately I have\n  known through the experience of another all the horrors and the\n  delights of love. I know what baseness the human heart can\n  contain, what infamy; yet I myself am an honest girl. No, I have\n  no illusions; but I have something better, something real,--I have\n  beliefs and a religion. See! I open the ball of our confidences.\n\n  Whoever I marry--provided I choose him for myself--may sleep in\n  peace or go to the East Indies sure that he will find me on his\n  return working at the tapestry which I began before he left me;\n  and in every stitch he shall read a verse of the poem of which he\n  has been the hero. Yes, I have resolved within my heart never to\n  follow my husband where he does not wish me to go. I will be the\n  divinity of his hearth. That is my religion of humanity. But why\n  should I not test and choose the man to whom I am to be like the\n  life to the body? Is a man ever impeded by life? What can that\n  woman be who thwarts the man she loves?--an illness, a disease,\n  not life. By life, I mean that joyous health which makes each hour\n  a pleasure.\n\n  But to return to your letter, which will always be precious to me.\n  Yes, jesting apart, it contains that which I desired, an\n  expression of prosaic sentiments which are as necessary to family\n  life as air to the lungs; and without which no happiness is\n  possible. To act as an honest man, to think as a poet, to love as\n  women love, that is what I longed for in my friend, and it is now\n  no longer a chimera.\n\n  Adieu, my friend. I am poor at this moment. That is one of the\n  reasons why I cling to my concealment, my mask, my impregnable\n  fortress. I have read your last verses in the \"Revue,\"--ah! with\n  what delight, now that I am initiated in the austere loftiness of\n  your secret soul.\n\n  Will it make you unhappy to know that a young girl prays for you;\n  that you are her solitary thought,--without a rival except in her\n  father and mother? Can there be any reason why you should reject\n  these pages full of you, written for you, seen by no eye but\n  yours? Send me their counterpart. I am so little of a woman yet\n  that your confidences--provided they are full and true--will\n  suffice for the happiness of your\n\nO. d'Este M.\n\n\n\"Good heavens! can I be in love already?\" cried the young secretary,\nwhen he perceived that he had held the above letter in his hands more\nthan an hour after reading it. \"What shall I do? She thinks she is\nwriting to the great poet! Can I continue the deception? Is she a woman\nof forty, or a girl of twenty?\"\n\nErnest was now fascinated by the great gulf of the unseen. The unseen\nis the obscurity of infinitude, and nothing is more alluring. In that\nsombre vastness fires flash, and furrow and color the abyss with fancies\nlike those of Martin. For a busy man like Canalis, an adventure of this\nkind is swept away like a harebell by a mountain torrent, but in the\nmore unoccupied life of the young secretary, this charming girl, whom\nhis imagination persistently connected with the blonde beauty at\nthe window, fastened upon his heart, and did as much mischief in his\nregulated life as a fox in a poultry-yard. La Briere allowed himself\nto be preoccupied by this mysterious correspondent; and he answered her\nlast letter with another, a pretentious and carefully studied epistle,\nin which, however, passion begins to reveal itself through pique.\n\n  Mademoiselle,--Is it quite loyal in you to enthrone yourself in\n  the heart of a poor poet with a latent intention of abandoning him\n  if he is not exactly what you wish, leaving him to endless\n  regrets,--showing him for a moment an image of perfection, were it\n  only assumed, and at any rate giving him a foretaste of happiness?\n  I was very short-sighted in soliciting this letter, in which you\n  have begun to unfold the elegant fabric of your thoughts. A man\n  can easily become enamored with a mysterious unknown who combines\n  such fearlessness with such originality, so much imagination with\n  so much feeling. Who would not wish to know you after reading your\n  first confidence? It requires a strong effort on my part to retain\n  my senses in thinking of you, for you combine all that can trouble\n  the head or the heart of man. I therefore make the most of the\n  little self-possession you have left me to offer you my humble\n  remonstrances.\n\n  Do you really believe, mademoiselle, that letters, more or less\n  true in relation to the life of the writers, more or less\n  insincere,--for those which we write to each other are the\n  expressions of the moment at which we pen them, and not of the\n  general tenor of our lives,--do you believe, I say, that beautiful\n  as they may be, they can at all replace the representation that we\n  could make of ourselves to each other by the revelations of daily\n  intercourse? Man is dual. There is a life invisible, that of the\n  heart, to which letters may suffice; and there is a life material,\n  to which more importance is, alas, attached than you are aware of\n  at your age. These two existences must, however, be made to\n  harmonize in the ideal which you cherish; and this, I may remark\n  in passing, is very rare.\n\n  The pure, spontaneous, disinterested homage of a solitary soul\n  which is both educated and chaste, is one of those celestial\n  flowers whose color and fragrance console for every grief, for\n  every wound, for every betrayal which makes up the life of a\n  literary man; and I thank you with an impulse equal to your own.\n  But after this poetical exchange of my griefs for the pearls of\n  your charity, what next? what do you expect? I have neither the\n  genius nor the splendid position of Lord Byron; above all, I have\n  not the halo of his fictitious damnation and his false social\n  woes. But what could you have hoped from him in like\n  circumstances? His friendship? Well, he who ought to have felt\n  only pride was eaten up by vanity of every kind,--sickly,\n  irritable vanity which discouraged friendship. I, a thousand-fold\n  more insignificant than he, may I not have discordances of\n  character, and make friendship a burden heavy indeed to bear? In\n  exchange for your reveries, what will you gain? The\n  dissatisfaction of a life which will not be wholly yours. The\n  compact is madness. Let me tell you why. In the first place, your\n  projected poem is a plagiarism. A young German girl, who was not,\n  like you, semi-German, but altogether so, adored Goethe with the\n  rash intoxication of girlhood. She made him her friend, her\n  religion, her god, knowing at the same time that he was married.\n  Madame Goethe, a worthy German woman, lent herself to this worship\n  with a sly good-nature which did not cure Bettina. But what was\n  the end of it all? The young ecstatic married a man who was\n  younger and handsomer than Goethe. Now, between ourselves, let us\n  admit that a young girl who should make herself the handmaid of a\n  man of genius, his equal through comprehension, and should piously\n  worship him till death, like one of those divine figures sketched\n  by the masters on the shutters of their mystic shrines, and who,\n  when Germany lost him, should have retired to some solitude away\n  from men, like the friend of Lord Bolingbroke,--let us admit, I\n  say, that the young girl would have lived forever, inlaid in the\n  glory of the poet as Mary Magdalene in the cross and triumph of\n  our Lord. If that is sublime, what say you to the reverse of the\n  picture? As I am neither Goethe nor Lord Byron, the colossi of\n  poetry and egotism, but simply the author of a few esteemed\n  verses, I cannot expect the honors of a cult. Neither am I\n  disposed to be a martyr. I have ambition, and I have a heart; I am\n  still young and I have my career to make. See me for what I am.\n  The bounty of the king and the protection of his ministers give me\n  sufficient means of living. I have the outward bearing of a very\n  ordinary man. I go to the soirees in Paris like any other\n  empty-headed fop; and if I drive, the wheels of my carriage do not\n  roll on the solid ground, absolutely indispensable in these days,\n  of property invested in the funds. But if I am not rich, neither do\n  I have the reliefs and consolations of life in a garret, the toil\n  uncomprehended, the fame in penury, which belong to men who are\n  worth far more than I,--D'Arthez, for instance.\n\n  Ah! what prosaic conclusions will your young enthusiasm find to\n  these enchanting visions. Let us stop here. If I have had the\n  happiness of seeming to you a terrestrial paragon, you have been\n  to me a thing of light and a beacon, like those stars that shine\n  for  a moment and disappear. May nothing ever tarnish this episode\n  of our lives. Were we to continue it I might love you; I might\n  conceive one of those mad passions which rend all obstacles, which\n  light fires in the heart whose violence is greater than their\n  duration. And suppose I succeeded in pleasing you? we should end\n  our tale in the common vulgar way,--marriage, a household,\n  children, Belise and Henriette Chrysale together!--could it be?\n  Therefore, adieu.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. THE MARRIAGE OF SOULS\n\n  To Monsieur de Canalis:\n\n  My Friend,--Your letter gives me as much pain as pleasure. But\n  perhaps some day we shall find nothing but pleasure in writing to\n  each other. Understand me thoroughly. The soul speaks to God and\n  asks him for many things; he is mute. I seek to obtain in you the\n  answers that God does not make to me. Cannot the friendship of\n  Mademoiselle de Gournay and Montaigne be revived in us? Do you not\n  remember the household of Sismonde de Sismondi in Geneva? The most\n  lovely home ever known, as I have been told; something like that\n  of the Marquis de Pescaire and his wife,--happy to old age. Ah!\n  friend, is it impossible that two hearts, two harps, should exist\n  as in a symphony, answering each other from a distance, vibrating\n  with delicious melody in unison? Man alone of all creation is in\n  himself the harp, the musician, and the listener. Do you think to\n  find me uneasy and jealous like ordinary women? I know that you go\n  into the world and meet the handsomest and the wittiest women in\n  Paris. May I not suppose that some one of those mermaids has\n  deigned to clasp you in her cold and scaly arms, and that she has\n  inspired the answer whose prosaic opinions sadden me? There is\n  something in life more beautiful than the garlands of Parisian\n  coquetry; there grows a flower far up those Alpine peaks called\n  men of genius, the glory of humanity, which they fertilize with\n  the dews their lofty heads draw from the skies. I seek to\n  cultivate that flower and make it bloom; for its wild yet gentle\n  fragrance can never fail,--it is eternal.\n\n  Do me the honor to believe that there is nothing low or\n  commonplace in me. Were I Bettina, for I know to whom you allude,\n  I should never have become Madame von Arnim; and had I been one of\n  Lord Byron's many loves, I should be at this moment in a cloister.\n  You have touched me to the quick. You do not know me, but you\n  shall know me. I feel within me something that is sublime, of\n  which I dare speak without vanity. God has put into my soul the\n  roots of that Alpine flower born on the summits of which I speak,\n  and I cannot plant it in an earthen pot upon my window-sill and\n  see it die. No, that glorious flower-cup, single in its beauty,\n  intoxicating in its fragrance, shall not be dragged through the\n  vulgarities of life! it is yours--yours, before any eye has\n  blighted it, yours forever! Yes, my poet, to you belong my\n  thoughts,--all, those that are secret, those that are gayest; my\n  heart is yours without reserve and with its infinite affection. If\n  you should personally not please me, I shall never marry. I can\n  live in the life of the heart, I can exist on your mind, your\n  sentiments; they please me, and I will always be what I am, your\n  friend. Yours is a noble moral nature; I have recognized it, I\n  have appreciated it, and that suffices me. In that is all my\n  future. Do not laugh at a young and pretty handmaiden who shrinks\n  not from the thought of being some day the old companion of a\n  poet,--a sort of mother perhaps, or a housekeeper; the guide of\n  his judgment and a source of his wealth. This handmaiden--so\n  devoted, so precious to the lives of such as you--is Friendship,\n  pure, disinterested friendship, to whom you will tell all, who\n  listens and sometimes shakes her head; who knits by the light of\n  the lamp and waits to be present when the poet returns home soaked\n  with rain, or vexed in mind. Such shall be my destiny if I do not\n  find that of a happy wife attached forever to her husband; I smile\n  alike at the thought of either fate. Do you believe France will be\n  any the worse if Mademoiselle d'Este does not give it two or three\n  sons, and never becomes a Madame Vilquin-something-or-other? As\n  for me, I shall never be an old maid. I shall make myself a\n  mother, by taking care of others and by my secret co-operation in\n  the existence of a great man, to whom also I shall carry all my\n  thoughts and all my earthly efforts.\n\n  I have the deepest horror of commonplaceness. If I am free, if I\n  am rich (and I know that I am young and pretty), I will never\n  belong to any ninny just because he is the son of a peer of\n  France, nor to a merchant who could ruin himself and me in a day,\n  nor to a handsome creature who would be a sort of woman in the\n  household, nor to a man of any kind who would make me blush twenty\n  times a day for being his. Make yourself easy on that point. My\n  father adores my wishes; he will never oppose them. If I please my\n  poet, and he pleases me, the glorious structure of our love shall\n  be built so high as to be inaccessible to any kind of misfortune.\n  I am an eaglet; and you will see it in my eyes.\n\n  I shall not repeat what I have already said, but I will put its\n  substance in the least possible number of words, and confess to\n  you that I should be the happiest of women if I were imprisoned by\n  love as I am now imprisoned by the wish and will of a father. Ah!\n  my friend, may we bring to a real end the romance that has come to\n  us through the first exercise of my will: listen to its\n  argument:--\n\n  A young girl with a lively imagination, locked up in a tower, is\n  weary with longing to run loose in the park where her eyes only\n  are allowed to rove. She invents a way to loosen her bars; she\n  jumps from the casement; she scales the park wall; she frolics\n  along the neighbor's sward--it is the Everlasting comedy. Well,\n  that young girl is my soul, the neighbor's park is your genius. Is\n  it not all very natural? Was there ever a neighbor that did not\n  complain that unknown feet broke down his trellises? I leave it to\n  my poet to answer.\n\n  But does the lofty reasoner after the fashion of Moliere want\n  still better reasons? Well, here they are. My dear Geronte,\n  marriages are usually made in defiance of common-sense. Parents\n  make inquiries about a young man. If the Leander--who is supplied\n  by some friend, or caught in a ball-room--is not a thief, and has\n  no visible rent in his reputation, if he has the necessary\n  fortune, if he comes from a college or a law-school and so fulfils\n  the popular ideas of education, and if he wears his clothes with a\n  gentlemanly air, he is allowed to meet the young lady, whose\n  mother has ordered her to guard her tongue, to let no sign of her\n  heart or soul appear on her face, which must wear the smile of a\n  danseuse finishing a pirouette. These commands are coupled with\n  instructions as to the danger of revealing her real character, and\n  the additional advice of not seeming alarmingly well educated. If\n  the settlements have all been agreed upon, the parents are\n  good-natured enough to let the pair see each other for a few\n  moments; they are allowed to talk or walk together, but always\n  without the slightest freedom, and knowing that they are bound by\n  rigid rules. The man is as much dressed up in soul as he is in body,\n  and so is the young girl. This pitiable comedy, mixed with bouquets,\n  jewels, and theatre-parties is called \"paying your addresses.\" It\n  revolts me: I desire that actual marriage shall be the result of a\n  previous and long marriage of souls. A young girl, a woman, has\n  throughout her life only this one moment when reflection, second\n  sight, and experience are necessary to her. She plays her liberty,\n  her happiness, and she is not allowed to throw the dice; she risks\n  her all, and is forced to be a mere spectator. I have the right,\n  the will, the power to make my own unhappiness, and I use them, as\n  did my mother, who, won by beauty and led by instinct, married the\n  most generous, the most liberal, the most loving of men. I know\n  that you are free, a poet, and noble-looking. Be sure that I\n  should not have chosen one of your brothers in Apollo who was\n  already married. If my mother was won by beauty, which is perhaps\n  the spirit of form, why should I not be attracted by the spirit\n  and the form united? Shall I not know you better by studying you\n  in this correspondence than I could through the vulgar experience\n  of \"receiving your addresses\"? This is the question, as Hamlet\n  says.\n\n  But my proceedings, dear Chrysale, have at least the merit of not\n  binding us personally. I know that love has its illusions, and\n  every illusion its to-morrow. That is why there are so many\n  partings among lovers vowed to each other for life. The proof of\n  love lies in two things,--suffering and happiness. When, after\n  passing through these double trials of life two beings have shown\n  each other their defects as well as their good qualities, when\n  they have really observed each other's character, then they may go\n  to their grave hand in hand. My dear Argante, who told you that\n  our little drama thus begun was to have no future? In any case\n  shall we not have enjoyed the pleasures of our correspondence?\n\n  I await your orders, monseigneur, and I am with all my heart,\n\n  Your handmaiden,\n\n  O. d'Este M.\n\n\n  To Mademoiselle O. d'Este M.,--You are a witch, a spirit, and I\n  love you! Is that what you desire of me, most original of girls?\n  Perhaps you are only seeking to amuse your provincial leisure with\n  the follies which are you able to make a poet commit. If so, you\n  have done a bad deed. Your two letters have enough of the spirit\n  of mischief in them to force this doubt into the mind of a\n  Parisian. But I am no longer master of myself; my life, my future\n  depend on the answer you will make me. Tell me if the certainty of\n  an unbounded affection, oblivious of all social conventions, will\n  touch you,--if you will suffer me to seek you. There is anxiety\n  enough and uncertainty enough in the question as to whether I can\n  personally please you. If your reply is favorable I change my\n  life, I bid adieu to all the irksome pleasures which we have the\n  folly to call happiness. Happiness, my dear and beautiful unknown,\n  is what you dream it to be,--a fusion of feelings, a perfect\n  accordance of souls, the imprint of a noble ideal (such as God\n  does permit us to form in this low world) upon the trivial round\n  of daily life whose habits we must needs obey, a constancy of\n  heart more precious far than what we call fidelity. Can we say\n  that we make sacrifices when the end in view is our eternal good,\n  the dream of poets, the dream of maidens, the poem which, at the\n  entrance of life when thought essays its wings, each noble\n  intellect has pondered and caressed only to see it shivered to\n  fragments on some stone of stumbling as hard as it is vulgar?--for\n  to the great majority of men, the foot of reality steps instantly\n  on that mysterious egg so seldom hatched.\n\n  I cannot speak to you any more of myself; not of my past life, nor\n  of my character, nor of an affection almost maternal on one side,\n  filial on mine, which you have already seriously changed--an\n  effect upon my life which must explain my use of the word\n  \"sacrifice.\" You have already rendered me forgetful, if not\n  ungrateful; does that satisfy you? Oh, speak! Say to me one word,\n  and I will love you till my eyes close in death, as the Marquis de\n  Pescaire loved his wife, as Romeo loved Juliet, and faithfully.\n  Our life will be, for me at least, that \"felicity untroubled\"\n  which Dante made the very element of his Paradiso,--a poem far\n  superior to his Inferno. Strange, it is not myself that I doubt in\n  the long reverie through which, like you, I follow the windings of\n  a dreamed existence; it is you. Yes, dear, I feel within me the\n  power to love, and to love endlessly,--to march to the grave with\n  gentle slowness and a smiling eye, with my beloved on my arm, and\n  with never a cloud upon the sunshine of our souls. Yes, I dare to\n  face our mutual old age, to see ourselves with whitening heads,\n  like the venerable historian of Italy, inspired always with the\n  same affection but transformed in soul by our life's seasons. Hear\n  me, I can no longer be your friend only. Though Chrysale, Geronte,\n  and Argante re-live, you say, in me, I am not yet old enough to\n  drink from the cup held to my lips by the sweet hands of a veiled\n  woman without a passionate desire to tear off the domino and the\n  mask and see the face. Either write me no more, or give me hope.\n  Let me see you, or let me go. Must I bid you adieu? Will you\n  permit me to sign myself,\n\n  Your Friend?\n\n\n  To Monsieur de Canalis,--What flattery! with what rapidity is the\n  grave Anselme transformed into a handsome Leander! To what must I\n  attribute such a change? to this black which I put upon this\n  white? to these ideas which are to the flowers of my soul what a\n  rose drawn in charcoal is to the roses in the garden? Or is it to\n  a recollection of the young girl whom you took for me, and who is\n  personally as like me as a waiting-woman is like her mistress?\n  Have we changed roles? Have I the sense? have you the fancy? But a\n  truce with jesting.\n\n  Your letter has made me know the elating pleasures of the soul;\n  the first that I have known outside of my family affections. What,\n  says a poet, are the ties of blood which are so strong in ordinary\n  minds, compared to those divinely forged within us by mysterious\n  sympathies? Let me thank you--no, we must not thank each other for\n  such things--but God bless you for the happiness you have given\n  me; be happy in the joy you have shed into my soul. You explain to\n  me some of the apparent injustices in social life. There is\n  something, I know not what, so dazzling, so virile in glory, that\n  it belongs only to man; God forbids us women to wear its halo, but\n  he makes love our portion, giving us the tenderness which soothes\n  the brow scorched by his lightnings. I have felt my mission, and\n  you have now confirmed it.\n\n  Sometimes, my friend, I rise in the morning in a state of\n  inexpressible sweetness; a sort of peace, tender and divine, gives\n  me an idea of heaven. My first thought is then like a benediction.\n  I call these mornings my little German wakings, in opposition to\n  my Southern sunsets, full of heroic deeds, battles, Roman fetes\n  and ardent poems. Well, after reading your letter, so full of\n  feverish impatience, I felt in my heart all the freshness of my\n  celestial wakings, when I love the air about me and all nature,\n  and fancy that I am destined to die for one I love. One of your\n  poems, \"The Maiden's Song,\" paints these delicious moments, when\n  gaiety is tender, when aspiration is a need; it is one of my\n  favorites. Do you want me to put all my flatteries into one?--well\n  then, I think you worthy to be _me_!\n\n  Your letter, though short, enables me to read within you. Yes, I\n  have guessed your tumultuous struggles, your piqued curiosity,\n  your projects; but I do not yet know you well enough to satisfy\n  your wishes. Hear me, dear; the mystery in which I am shrouded\n  allows me to use that word, which lets you see to the bottom of my\n  heart. Hear me: if we once meet, adieu to our mutual\n  comprehension! Will you make a compact with me? Was the first\n  disadvantageous to you? But remember it won you my esteem, and it\n  is a great deal, my friend, to gain an admiration lined throughout\n  with esteem. Here is the compact: write me your life in a few\n  words; then tell me what you do in Paris, day by day, with no\n  reservations, and as if you were talking to some old friend. Well,\n  having done that, I will take a step myself--I will see you, I\n  promise you that. And it is a great deal.\n\n  This, dear, is no intrigue, no adventure; no gallantry, as you men\n  say, can come of it, I warn you frankly. It involves my life, and\n  more than that,--something that causes me remorse for the many\n  thoughts that fly to you in flocks--it involves my father's and my\n  mother's life. I adore them, and my choice must please them; they\n  must find a son in you.\n\n  Tell me, to what extent can the superb spirits of your kind, to\n  whom God has given the wings of his angels, without always adding\n  their amiability,--how far can they bend under a family yoke, and\n  put up with its little miseries? That is a text I have meditated\n  upon. Ah! though I said to my heart before I came to you, Forward!\n  Onward! it did not tremble and palpitate any the less on the way;\n  and I did not conceal from myself the stoniness of the path nor\n  the Alpine difficulties I had to encounter. I thought of all in my\n  long, long meditations. Do I not know that eminent men like you\n  have known the love they have inspired quite as well as that which\n  they themselves have felt; that they have had many romances in\n  their lives,--you particularly, who send forth those airy visions\n  of your soul that women rush to buy? Yet still I cried to myself,\n  \"Onward!\" because I have studied, more than you give me credit\n  for, the geography of the great summits of humanity, which you\n  tell me are so cold. Did you not say that Goethe and Byron were\n  the colossi of egoism and poetry? Ah, my friend, there you shared\n  a mistake into which superficial minds are apt to fall; but in you\n  perhaps it came from generosity, false modesty, or the desire to\n  escape from me. Vulgar minds may mistake the effect of toil for\n  the development of personal character, but you must not. Neither\n  Lord Byron, nor Goethe, nor Walter Scott, nor Cuvier, nor any\n  inventor, belongs to himself, he is the slave of his idea. And\n  this mysterious power is more jealous than a woman; it sucks their\n  blood, it makes them live, it makes them die for its sake. The\n  visible developments of their hidden existence do seem, in their\n  results, like egotism; but who shall dare to say that the man who\n  has abnegated self to give pleasure, instruction, or grandeur to\n  his epoch, is an egoist? Is a mother selfish when she immolates\n  all things to her child? Well, the detractors of genius do not\n  perceive its fecund maternity, that is all. The life of a poet is\n  so perpetual a sacrifice that he needs a gigantic organization to\n  bear even the ordinary pleasures of life. Therefore, into what\n  sorrows may he not fall when, like Moliere, he wishes to live the\n  life of feeling in its most poignant crises; to me, remembering\n  his personal life, Moliere's comedy is horrible.\n\n  The generosity of genius seems to me half divine; and I place you\n  in this noble family of alleged egoists. Ah! if I had found\n  self-interest, ambition, a seared nature where I now can see my\n  best loved flowers of the soul, you know not what long anguish I\n  should have had to bear. I met with disappointment before I was\n  sixteen. What would have become of me had I learned at twenty that\n  fame is a lie, that he whose books express the feelings hidden in\n  my heart was incapable of feeling them himself? Oh! my friend, do\n  you know what would have become of me? Shall I take you into the\n  recesses of my soul? I should have gone to my father and said,\n  \"Bring me the son-in-law whom you desire; my will abdicates,--marry\n  me to whom you please.\" And the man might have been a notary,\n  banker, miser, fool, dullard, wearisome as a rainy day, common as\n  the usher of a school, a manufacturer, or some brave soldier without\n  two ideas,--he would have had a resigned and attentive servant in\n  me. But what an awful suicide! never could my soul have expanded\n  in the life-giving rays of a beloved sun. No murmur should have\n  revealed to my father, or my mother, or my children the suicide of\n  the creature who at this instant is shaking her fetters, casting\n  lightnings from her eyes, and flying towards you with eager wing.\n  See, she is there, at the angle of your desk, like Polyhymnia,\n  breathing the air of your presence, and glancing about her with a\n  curious eye. Sometimes in the fields where my husband would have\n  taken me to walk, I should have wept, apart and secretly, at sight\n  of a glorious morning; and in my heart, or hidden in a\n  bureau-drawer, I might have kept some treasure, the comfort of poor\n  girls ill-used by love, sad, poetic souls,--but ah! I have _you_, I\n  believe in _you_, my friend. That belief straightens all my thoughts\n  and fancies, even the most fantastic, and sometimes--see how far\n  my frankness leads me--I wish I were in the middle of the book we\n  are just beginning; such persistency do I feel in my sentiments,\n  such strength in my heart to love, such constancy sustained by\n  reason, such heroism for the duties for which I was created,--if\n  indeed love can ever be transmuted into duty.\n\n  If you were able to follow me to the exquisite retreat where I\n  fancy ourselves happy, if you knew my plans and projects, the\n  dreadful word \"folly!\" might escape you, and I should be cruelly\n  punished for sending poetry to a poet. Yes, I wish to be a spring\n  of waters inexhaustible as a fertile land for the twenty years\n  that nature allows me to shine. I want to drive away satiety by\n  charm. I mean to be courageous for my friend as most women are for\n  the world. I wish to vary happiness. I wish to put intelligence\n  into tenderness, and to give piquancy to fidelity. I am filled\n  with ambition to kill the rivals of the past, to conjure away all\n  outside griefs by a wife's gentleness, by her proud abnegation, to\n  take a lifelong care of the nest,--such as birds can only take for\n  a few weeks.\n\n  Tell me, do you now think me to blame for my first letter? The\n  mysterious wind of will drove me to you, as the tempest brings the\n  little rose-tree to the pollard window. In your letter, which I\n  hold here upon my heart, you cried out, like your ancestor when he\n  departed for the Crusades, \"God wills it.\"\n\n  Ah! but you will cry out, \"What a chatterbox!\" All the people\n  round me say, on the contrary, \"Mademoiselle is very taciturn.\"\n\nO. d'Este M.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. WHAT COMES OF CORRESPONDENCE\n\nThe foregoing letters seemed very original to the persons from whom the\nauthor of the \"Comedy of Human Life\" obtained them; but their interest\nin this duel, this crossing of pens between two minds, may not be\nshared. For every hundred readers, eighty might weary of the battle.\nThe respect due to the majority in every nation under a constitutional\ngovernment, leads us, therefore, to suppress eleven other letters\nexchanged between Ernest and Modeste during the month of September. If,\nlater on, some flattering majority should arise to claim them, let us\nhope that we can then find means to insert them in their proper place.\n\nUrged by a mind that seemed as aggressive as the heart was lovable, the\ntruly chivalrous feelings of the poor secretary gave themselves free\nplay in these suppressed letters, which seem, perhaps, more beautiful\nthan they really are, because the imagination is charmed by a sense of\nthe communion of two free souls. Ernest's whole life was now wrapped up\nin these sweet scraps of paper; they were to him what banknotes are to a\nmiser; while in Modeste's soul a deep love took the place of her delight\nin agitating a glorious life, and being, in spite of distance, its\nmainspring. Ernest's heart was the complement of Canalis's glory. Alas!\nit often takes two men to make a perfect lover, just as in literature\nwe compose a type by collecting the peculiarities of several similar\ncharacters. How many a time a woman has been heard to say in her own\nsalon after close and intimate conversations:--\n\n\"Such a one is my ideal as to soul, and I love the other who is only a\ndream of the senses.\"\n\nThe last letter written by Modeste, which here follows, gives us\na glimpse of the enchanted isle to which the meanderings of this\ncorrespondence had led the two lovers.\n\n  To Monsieur de Canalis,--Be at Havre next Sunday; go to church;\n  after the morning service, walk once or twice round the nave, and\n  go out without speaking to any one; but wear a white rose in your\n  button-hole. Then return to Paris, where you shall receive an\n  answer. I warn you that this answer will not be what you wish;\n  for, as I told you, the future is not yet mine. But should I not\n  indeed be mad and foolish to say yes without having seen you? When\n  I have seen you I can say no without wounding you; I can make sure\n  that you shall not see me.\n\nThis letter had been sent off the evening before the day when the\nabortive struggle between Dumay and Modeste had taken place. The happy\ngirl was impatiently awaiting Sunday, when her eyes were to vindicate or\ncondemn her heart and her actions,--a solemn moment in the life of any\nwoman, and which three months of close communion of souls now rendered\nas romantic as the most imaginative maiden could have wished. Every one,\nexcept the mother, had taken this torpor of expectation for the calm of\ninnocence. No matter how firmly family laws and religious precepts may\nbind, there will always be the Clarissas and the Julies, whose souls\nlike flowing cups o'erlap the brim under some spiritual pressure.\nModeste was glorious in the savage energy with which she repressed her\nexuberant youthful happiness and remained demurely quiet. Let us say\nfrankly that the memory of her sister was more potent upon her than any\nsocial conventions; her will was iron in the resolve to bring no grief\nupon her father and her mother. But what tumultuous heavings were within\nher breast! no wonder that a mother guessed them.\n\nOn the following day Modeste and Madame Dumay took Madame Mignon about\nmid-day to a seat in the sun among the flowers. The blind woman turned\nher wan and blighted face toward the ocean; she inhaled the odors of\nthe sea and took the hand of her daughter who remained beside her. The\nmother hesitated between forgiveness and remonstrance ere she put the\nimportant question; for she comprehended the girl's love and recognized,\nas the pretended Canalis had done, that Modeste was exceptional in\nnature.\n\n\"God grant that your father return in time! If he delays much longer he\nwill find none but you to love him. Modeste, promise me once more never\nto leave him,\" she said in a fond maternal tone.\n\nModeste lifted her mother's hands to her lips and kissed them gently,\nreplying: \"Need I say it again?\"\n\n\"Ah, my child! I did this thing myself. I left my father to follow my\nhusband; and yet my father was all alone; I was all the child he had. Is\nthat why God has so punished me? What I ask of you is to marry as your\nfather wishes, to cherish him in your heart, not to sacrifice him to\nyour own happiness, but to make him the centre of your home. Before\nlosing my sight, I wrote him all my wishes, and I know he will execute\nthem. I enjoined him to keep his property intact and in his own hands;\nnot that I distrust you, my Modeste, for a moment, but who can be sure\nof a son-in-law? Ah! my daughter, look at me; was I reasonable? One\nglance of the eye decided my life. Beauty, so often deceitful, in my\ncase spoke true; but even were it the same with you, my poor child,\nswear to me that you will let your father inquire into the character,\nthe habits, the heart, and the previous life of the man you distinguish\nwith your love--if, by chance, there is such a man.\"\n\n\"I will never marry without the consent of my father,\" answered Modeste.\n\n\"You see, my darling,\" said Madame Mignon after a long pause, \"that if I\nam dying by inches through Bettina's wrong-doing, your father would not\nsurvive yours, no, not for a moment. I know him; he would put a pistol\nto his head,--there could be no life, no happiness on earth for him.\"\n\nModeste walked a few steps away from her mother, but immediately came\nback.\n\n\"Why did you leave me?\" demanded Madame Mignon.\n\n\"You made me cry, mamma,\" answered Modeste.\n\n\"Ah, my little darling, kiss me. You love no one here? you have no\nlover, have you?\" she asked, holding Modeste on her lap, heart to heart.\n\n\"No, my dear mamma,\" said the little Jesuit.\n\n\"Can you swear it?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" cried Modeste.\n\nMadame Mignon said no more; but she still doubted.\n\n\"At least, if you do choose your husband, you will tell your father?\"\nshe resumed.\n\n\"I promised that to my sister, and to you, mother. What evil do you\nthink I could commit while I wear that ring upon my finger and read\nthose words: 'Think of Bettina?' Poor sister!\"\n\nAt these words a truce of silence came between the pair; the mother's\nblighted eyes rained tears which Modeste could not check, though she\nthrew herself upon her knees, and cried: \"Forgive me! oh, forgive me,\nmother!\"\n\nAt this instant the excellent Dumay was coming up the hill of Ingouville\non the double-quick,--a fact quite abnormal in the present life of the\ncashier.\n\nThree letters had brought ruin to the Mignons; a single letter now\nrestored their fortunes. Dumay had received from a sea-captain just\narrived from the China Seas the following letter containing the first\nnews of his patron and friend, Charles Mignon:--\n\n  To Monsieur Jean Dumay:\n\n  My Dear Dumay,--I shall quickly follow, barring the chances of the\n  voyage, the vessel which carries this letter. In fact, I should\n  have taken it, but I did not wish to leave my own ship to which I\n  am accustomed.\n\n  I told you that no new was to be good news. But the first words of\n  this letter ought to make you a happy man. I have made seven\n  millions at the least. I am bringing back a large part of it in\n  indigo, one third in safe London securities, and another third in\n  good solid gold. Your remittances helped me to make the sum I had\n  settled in my own mind much sooner than I expected. I wanted two\n  millions for my daughters and a competence for myself.\n\n  I have been engaged in the opium trade with the largest houses in\n  Canton, all ten times richer than ever I was. You have no idea, in\n  Europe, what these rich East India merchants are. I went to Asia\n  Minor and purchased opium at low prices, and from thence to Canton\n  where I delivered my cargoes to the companies who control the\n  trade. My last expedition was to the Philippine Islands where I\n  exchanged opium for indigo of the first quality. In fact, I may\n  have half a million more than I stated, for I reckoned the indigo\n  at what it cost me. I have always been well in health; not the\n  slightest illness. That is the result of working for one's\n  children. Since the second year I have owned a pretty little brig\n  of seven hundred tons, called the \"Mignon.\" She is built of oak,\n  double-planked, and copper-fastened; and all the interior fittings\n  were done to suit me. She is, in fact, an additional piece of\n  property.\n\n  A sea-life and the active habits required by my business have kept\n  me in good health. To tell you all this is the same as telling it\n  to my two daughters and my dear wife. I trust that the wretched\n  man who took away my Bettina deserted her when he heard of my\n  ruin; and that I shall find the poor lost lamb at the Chalet. My\n  three dear women and my Dumay! All four of you have been ever\n  present in my thoughts for the last three years. You are a rich\n  man, now, Dumay. Your share, outside of my own fortune, amounts to\n  five hundred and sixty thousand francs, for which I send you\n  herewith a check, which can only be paid to you in person by the\n  Mongenods, who have been duly advised from New York.\n\n  A few short months, and I shall see you all again, and all well, I\n  trust. My dear Dumay, if I write this letter to you it is because\n  I am anxious to keep my fortune a secret for the present. I\n  therefore leave to you the happiness of preparing my dear angels\n  for my return. I have had enough of commerce; and I am resolved to\n  leave Havre. My intention is to buy back the estate of La Bastie,\n  and to entail it, so as to establish an estate yielding at least a\n  hundred thousand francs a year, and then to ask the king to grant\n  that one of my sons-in-law may succeed to my name and title. You\n  know, my poor Dumay, what a terrible misfortune overtook us\n  through the fatal reputation of a large fortune,--my daughter's\n  honor was lost. I have therefore resolved that the amount of my\n  present fortune shall not be known. I shall not disembark at\n  Havre, but at Marseilles. I shall sell my indigo, and negotiate\n  for the purchase of La Bastie through the house of Mongenod in\n  Paris. I shall put my funds in the Bank of France and return to\n  the Chalet giving out that I have a considerable fortune in\n  merchandise. My daughters will be supposed to have two or three\n  hundred thousand francs. To choose which of my sons-in-law is\n  worthy to succeed to my title and estates and to live with us, is\n  now the object of my life; but both of them must be, like you and\n  me, honest, loyal, and firm men, and absolutely honorable.\n\n  My dear old fellow, I have never doubted you for a moment. We have\n  gone through wars and commerce together and now we will undertake\n  agriculture; you shall be my bailiff. You will like that, will you\n  not? And so, old friend, I leave it to your discretion to tell\n  what you think best to my wife and daughters; I rely upon your\n  prudence. In four years great changes may have taken place in\n  their characters.\n\n  Adieu, my old Dumay. Say to my daughters and to my wife that I\n  have never failed to kiss them in my thoughts morning and evening\n  since I left them. The second check for forty thousand francs\n  herewith enclosed is for my wife and children.\n\n  Till we meet.--Your colonel and friend,\n\n  Charles Mignon.\n\n\n\"Your father is coming,\" said Madame Mignon to her daughter.\n\n\"What makes you think so, mamma?\" asked Modeste.\n\n\"Nothing else could make Dumay hurry himself.\"\n\n\"Victory! victory!\" cried the lieutenant as soon as he reached the\ngarden gate. \"Madame, the colonel has not been ill a moment; he is\ncoming back--coming back on the 'Mignon,' a fine ship of his own, which\ntogether with its cargo is worth, he tells me, eight or nine hundred\nthousand francs. But he requires secrecy from all of us; his heart is\nstill wrung by the misfortunes of our dear departed girl.\"\n\n\"He has still to learn her death,\" said Madame Mignon.\n\n\"He attributes her disaster, and I think he is right, to the rapacity of\nyoung men after great fortunes. My poor colonel expects to find the lost\nsheep here. Let us be happy among ourselves but say nothing to any\none, not even to Latournelle, if that is possible. Mademoiselle,\" he\nwhispered in Modeste's ear, \"write to your father and tell him of his\nloss and also the terrible results on your mother's health and eyesight;\nprepare him for the shock he has to meet. I will engage to get the\nletter into his hands before he reaches Havre, for he will have to pass\nthrough Paris on his way. Write him a long letter; you have plenty of\ntime. I will take the letter on Monday; Monday I shall probably go to\nParis.\"\n\nModeste was so afraid that Canalis and Dumay would meet that she started\nhastily for the house to write to her poet and put off the rendezvous.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said Dumay, in a very humble manner and barring\nModeste's way, \"may your father find his daughter with no other feelings\nin her heart than those she had for him and for her mother before he was\nobliged to leave her.\"\n\n\"I have sworn to myself, to my sister, and to my mother to be the\njoy, the consolation, and the glory of my father, and _I shall keep my\noath_!\" replied Modeste with a haughty and disdainful glance at Dumay.\n\"Do not trouble my delight in the thought of my father's return\nwith insulting suspicions. You cannot prevent a girl's heart from\nbeating--you don't want me to be a mummy, do you?\" she said. \"My hand\nbelongs to my family, but my heart is my own. If I love any one, my\nfather and my mother will know it. Does that satisfy you, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Thank you, mademoiselle; you restore me to life,\" said Dumay, \"but you\nmight still call me Dumay, even when you box my ears!\"\n\n\"Swear to me,\" said her mother, \"that you have not engaged a word or a\nlook with any young man.\"\n\n\"I can swear that, my dear mother,\" said Modeste, laughing, and looking\nat Dumay who was watching her and smiling to himself like a mischievous\ngirl.\n\n\"She must be false indeed if you are right,\" cried Dumay, when Modeste\nhad left them and gone into the house.\n\n\"My daughter Modeste may have faults,\" said her mother, \"but falsehood\nis not one of them; she is incapable of saying what is not true.\"\n\n\"Well! then let us feel easy,\" continued Dumay, \"and believe that\nmisfortune has closed his account with us.\"\n\n\"God grant it!\" answered Madame Mignon. \"You will see _him_, Dumay; but\nI shall only hear him. There is much of sadness in my joy.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. A DECLARATION OF LOVE,--SET TO MUSIC\n\nAt this moment Modeste, happy as she was in the return of her father,\nwas, nevertheless, pacing her room disconsolate as Perrette on seeing\nher eggs broken. She had hoped her father would bring back a much larger\nfortune than Dumay had mentioned. Nothing could satisfy her new-found\nambition on behalf of her poet less than at least half the six millions\nshe had talked of in her second letter. Trebly agitated by her two joys\nand the grief caused by her comparative poverty, she seated herself at\nthe piano, that confidant of so many young girls, who tell out their\nwishes and provocations on the keys, expressing them by the notes and\ntones of their music. Dumay was talking with his wife in the garden\nunder the windows, telling her the secret of their own wealth, and\nquestioning her as to her desires and her intentions. Madame Dumay had,\nlike her husband, no other family than the Mignons. Husband and wife\nagreed, therefore, to go and live in Provence, if the Comte de La Bastie\nreally meant to live in Provence, and to leave their money to whichever\nof Modeste's children might need it most.\n\n\"Listen to Modeste,\" said Madame Mignon, addressing them. \"None but a\ngirl in love can compose such airs without having studied music.\"\n\nHouses may burn, fortunes be engulfed, fathers return from distant\nlands, empires may crumble away, the cholera may ravage cities, but a\nmaiden's love wings its way as nature pursues hers, or that alarming\nacid which chemistry has lately discovered, and which will presently eat\nthrough the globe, if nothing stops it.\n\nModeste, under the inspiration of her present situation, was putting to\nmusic certain stanzas which we are compelled to quote here--albeit\nthey are printed in the second volume of the edition Dauriat had\nmentioned--because, in order to adapt them to her music, which had the\ninexpressible charm of sentiment so admired in great singers, Modeste\nhad taken liberties with the lines in a manner that may astonish the\nadmirers of a poet so famous for the correctness, sometimes too precise,\nof his measures.\n\n  THE MAIDEN'S SONG\n\n  Hear, arise! the lark is shaking\n    Sunlit wings that heavenward rise;\n  Sleep no more; the violet, waking,\n    Wafts her incense to the skies.\n\n  Flowers revived, their eyes unclosing,\n    See themselves in drops of dew\n  In each calyx-cup reposing,\n    Pearls of a day their mirror true.\n\n  Breeze divine, the god of roses,\n    Passed by night to bless their bloom;\n  See! for him each bud uncloses,\n    Glows, and yields its rich perfume.\n\n  Then arise! the lark is shaking\n    Sunlit wings that heavenward rise;\n  Nought is sleeping--Heart, awaking,\n    Lift thine incense to the skies.\n\n\"It is very pretty,\" said Madame Dumay. \"Modeste is a musician, and\nthat's the whole of it.\"\n\n\"The devil is in her!\" cried the cashier, into whose heart the suspicion\nof the mother forced its way and made him shiver.\n\n\"She loves,\" persisted Madame Mignon.\n\nBy succeeding, through the undeniable testimony of the song, in making\nthe cashier a sharer in her belief as to the state of Modeste's heart,\nMadame Mignon destroyed the happiness the return and the prosperity of\nhis master had brought him. The poor Breton went down the hill to Havre\nand to his desk in Gobenheim's counting-room with a heavy heart; then,\nbefore returning to dinner, he went to see Latournelle, to tell his\nfears, and beg once more for the notary's advice and assistance.\n\n\"Yes, my dear friend,\" said Dumay, when they parted on the steps of the\nnotary's door, \"I now agree with madame; she loves,--yes, I am sure of\nit; and the devil knows the rest. I am dishonored.\"\n\n\"Don't make yourself unhappy, Dumay,\" answered the little notary. \"Among\nus all we can surely get the better of the little puss; sooner or later,\nevery girl in love betrays herself,--you may be sure of that. But we\nwill talk about it this evening.\"\n\nThus it happened that all those devoted to the Mignon family were fully\nas disquieted and uncertain as they were before the old soldier tried\nthe experiment which he expected would be so decisive. The ill-success\nof his past efforts so stimulated Dumay's sense of duty, that he\ndetermined not to go to Paris to see after his own fortune as announced\nby his patron, until he had guessed the riddle of Modeste's heart. These\nfriends, to whom feelings were more precious than interests, well knew\nthat unless the daughter were pure and innocent, the father would die of\ngrief when he came to know the death of Bettina and the blindness of\nhis wife. The distress of poor Dumay made such an impression on the\nLatournelles that they even forgot their parting with Exupere, whom they\nhad sent off that morning to Paris. During dinner, while the three were\nalone, Monsieur and Madame Latournelle and Butscha turned the problem\nover and over in their minds, and discussed every aspect of it.\n\n\"If Modeste loved any one in Havre she would have shown some fear\nyesterday,\" said Madame Latournelle; \"her lover, therefore, lives\nsomewhere else.\"\n\n\"She swore to her mother this morning,\" said the notary, \"in presence\nof Dumay, that she had not exchanged a look or a word with any living\nsoul.\"\n\n\"Then she loves after my fashion!\" exclaimed Butscha.\n\n\"And how is that, my poor lad?\" asked Madame Latournelle.\n\n\"Madame,\" said the little cripple, \"I love alone and afar--oh! as far as\nfrom here to the stars.\"\n\n\"How do you manage it, you silly fellow?\" said Madame Latournelle,\nlaughing.\n\n\"Ah, madame!\" said Butscha, \"what you call my hump is the socket of my\nwings.\"\n\n\"So that is the explanation of your seal, is it?\" cried the notary.\n\nButscha's seal was a star, and under it the words \"Fulgens,\nsequar,\"--\"Shining One, I follow thee,\"--the motto of the house of\nChastillonest.\n\n\"A beautiful woman may feel as distrustful as the ugliest,\" said\nButscha, as if speaking to himself; \"Modeste is clever enough to fear\nshe may be loved only for her beauty.\"\n\nHunchbacks are extraordinary creations, due entirely to society for,\naccording to Nature's plan, feeble or aborted beings ought to perish.\nThe curvature or distortion of the spinal column creates in these\noutwardly deformed subjects as it were a storage-battery, where\nthe nerve currents accumulate more abundantly than under normal\nconditions,--where they develop, and whence they are emitted, so to say,\nin lightning flashes, to energize the interior being. From this, forces\nresult which are sometimes brought to light by magnetism, though they\nare far more frequently lost in the vague spaces of the spiritual world.\nIt is rare to find a deformed person who is not gifted with some special\nfaculty,--a whimsical or sparkling gaiety perhaps, an utter malignity,\nor an almost sublime goodness. Like instruments which the hand of art\ncan never fully waken, these beings, highly privileged though they know\nit not, live within themselves, as Butscha lived, provided their natural\nforces so magnificently concentrated have not been spent in the struggle\nthey have been forced to maintain, against tremendous odds, to keep\nalive. This explains many superstitions, the popular legends of gnomes,\nfrightful dwarfs, deformed fairies,--all that race of bottles, as\nRabelais called them, containing elixirs and precious balms.\n\nButscha, therefore, had very nearly found the key to the puzzle. With\nall the anxious solicitude of a hopeless lover, a vassal ever ready to\ndie,--like the soldiers alone and abandoned in the snows of Russia, who\nstill cried out, \"Long live the Emperor,\"--he meditated how to capture\nModeste's secret for his own private knowledge. So thinking, he followed\nhis patrons to the Chalet that evening, with a cloud of care upon his\nbrow: for he knew it was most important to hide from all these watchful\neyes and ears the net, whatever it might be, in which he should entrap\nhis lady. It would have to be, he thought, by some intercepted glance,\nsome sudden start or quiver, as when a surgeon lays his finger on a\nhidden sore. That evening Gobenheim did not appear, and Butscha was\nDumay's partner against Monsieur and Madame Latournelle. During the few\nmoment's of Modeste's absence, about nine o'clock, to prepare for her\nmother's bedtime, Madame Mignon and her friends spoke openly to one\nanother; but the poor clerk, depressed by the conviction of Modeste's\nlove, which had now seized upon him as upon the rest, seemed as remote\nfrom the discussion as Gobenheim had been the night before.\n\n\"Well, what's the matter with you, Butscha?\" cried Madame Latournelle;\n\"one would really think you hadn't a friend in the world.\"\n\nTears shone in the eyes of the poor fellow, who was the son of a Swedish\nsailor, and whose mother was dead.\n\n\"I have no one in the world but you,\" he answered with a troubled voice;\n\"and your compassion is so much a part of your religion that I can never\nlose it--and I will never deserve to lose it.\"\n\nThis answer struck the sensitive chord of true delicacy in the minds of\nall present.\n\n\"We love you, Monsieur Butscha,\" said Madame Mignon, with much feeling\nin her voice.\n\n\"I've six hundred thousand francs of my own, this day,\" cried Dumay,\n\"and you shall be a notary and the successor of Latournelle.\"\n\nThe American wife took the hand of the poor hunchback and pressed it.\n\n\"What! you have six hundred thousand francs!\" exclaimed Latournelle,\npricking up his ears as Dumay let fall the words; \"and you allow these\nladies to live as they do! Modeste ought to have a fine horse; and why\ndoesn't she continue to take lessons in music, and painting, and--\"\n\n\"Why, he has only had the money a few hours!\" cried the little wife.\n\n\"Hush!\" murmured Madame Mignon.\n\nWhile these words were exchanged, Butscha's august mistress turned\ntowards him, preparing to make a speech:--\n\n\"My son,\" she said, \"you are so surrounded by true affection that I\nnever thought how my thoughtless use of that familiar phrase might be\nconstrued; but you must thank me for my little blunder, because it has\nserved to show you what friends your noble qualities have won.\"\n\n\"Then you must have news from Monsieur Mignon,\" resumed the notary.\n\n\"He is on his way home,\" said Madame Mignon; \"but let us keep the secret\nto ourselves. When my husband learns how faithful Butscha has been\nto us, how he has shown us the warmest and the most disinterested\nfriendship when others have given us the cold shoulder, he will not let\nyou alone provide for him, Dumay. And so, my friend,\" she added, turning\nher blind face toward Butscha; \"you can begin at once to negotiate with\nLatournelle.\"\n\n\"He's of legal age, twenty-five and a half years. As for me, it will\nbe paying a debt, my boy, to make the purchase easy for you,\" said the\nnotary.\n\nButscha was kissing Madame Mignon's hand, and his face was wet with\ntears as Modeste opened the door of the salon.\n\n\"What are you doing to my Black Dwarf?\" she demanded. \"Who is making him\nunhappy?\"\n\n\"Ah! Mademoiselle Mignon, do we luckless fellows, cradled in misfortune,\never weep for grief? They have just shown me as much affection as I\ncould feel for them if they were indeed my own relations. I'm to be a\nnotary; I shall be rich. Ha! ha! the poor Butscha may become the rich\nButscha. You don't know what audacity there is in this abortion,\" he\ncried.\n\nWith that he gave himself a resounding blow on the cavity of his chest\nand took up a position before the fireplace, after casting a glance at\nModeste, which slipped like a ray of light between his heavy half-closed\neyelids. He perceived, in this unexpected incident, a chance of\ninterrogating the heart of his sovereign. Dumay thought for a moment\nthat the clerk dared to aspire to Modeste, and he exchanged a rapid\nglance with the others, who understood him, and began to eye the little\nman with a species of terror mingled with curiosity.\n\n\"I, too, have my dreams,\" said Butscha, not taking his eyes from\nModeste.\n\nThe young girl lowered her eyelids with a movement that was a revelation\nto the young man.\n\n\"You love romance,\" he said, addressing her. \"Let me, in this moment of\nhappiness, tell you mine; and you shall tell me in return whether the\nconclusion of the tale I have invented for my life is possible. To me\nwealth would bring greater happiness than to other men; for the highest\nhappiness I can imagine would be to enrich the one I loved. You,\nmademoiselle, who know so many things, tell me if it is possible for a\nman to make himself beloved independently of his person, be it handsome\nor ugly, and for his spirit only?\"\n\nModeste raised her eyes and looked at Butscha. It was a piercing and\nquestioning glance; for she shared Dumay's suspicion of Butscha's\nmotive.\n\n\"Let me be rich, and I will seek some beautiful poor girl, abandoned\nlike myself, who has suffered, who knows what misery is. I will write\nto her and console her, and be her guardian spirit; she shall read my\nheart, my soul; she shall possess by double wealth, my two wealths,--my\ngold, delicately offered, and my thought robed in all the splendor which\nthe accident of birth has denied to my grotesque body. But I myself\nshall remain hidden like the cause that science seeks. God himself may\nnot be glorious to the eye. Well, naturally, the maiden will be curious;\nshe will wish to see me; but I shall tell her that I am a monster of\nugliness; I shall picture myself hideous.\"\n\nAt these words Modeste gave Butscha a glance that looked him through and\nthrough. If she had said aloud, \"What do you know of my love?\" she could\nnot have been more explicit.\n\n\"If I have the honor of being loved for the poem of my heart, if some\nday such love may make a woman think me only slightly deformed, I\nask you, mademoiselle, shall I not be happier than the handsomest of\nmen,--as happy as a man of genius beloved by some celestial being like\nyourself.\"\n\nThe color which suffused the young girl's face told the cripple nearly\nall he sought to know.\n\n\"Well, if that be so,\" he went on, \"if we enrich the one we love, if\nwe please the spirit and withdraw the body, is not that the way to make\none's self beloved? At any rate it is the dream of your poor dwarf,--a\ndream of yesterday; for to-day your mother gives me the key to future\nwealth by promising me the means of buying a practice. But before I\nbecome another Gobenheim, I seek to know whether this dream could be\nreally carried out. What do you say, mademoiselle, _you_?\"\n\nModeste was so astonished that she did not notice the question. The trap\nof the lover was much better baited than that of the soldier, for the\npoor girl was rendered speechless.\n\n\"Poor Butscha!\" whispered Madame Latournelle to her husband. \"Do you\nthink he is going mad?\"\n\n\"You want to realize the story of Beauty and the Beast,\" said Modeste at\nlength; \"but you forget that the Beast turned into Prince Charming.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" said the dwarf. \"Now I have always thought that\nthat transformation meant the phenomenon of the soul made visible,\nobliterating the form under the light of the spirit. If I were not loved\nI should stay hidden, that is all. You and yours, madame,\" he continued,\naddressing his mistress, \"instead of having a dwarf at your service,\nwill now have a life and a fortune.\"\n\nSo saying, Butscha resumed his seat, remarking to the three\nwhist-players with an assumption of calmness, \"Whose deal is it?\" but\nwithin his soul he whispered sadly to himself: \"She wants to be loved\nfor herself; she corresponds with some pretended great man; how far has\nit gone?\"\n\n\"Dear mamma, it is nearly ten o'clock,\" said Modeste.\n\nMadame Mignon said good-night to her friends, and went to bed.\n\nThey who wish to love in secret may have Pyrenean hounds, mothers,\nDumays, and Latournelles to spy upon them, and yet not be in any danger;\nbut when it comes to a lover!--ah! that is diamond cut diamond, flame\nagainst flame, mind to mind, an equation whose terms are mutual.\n\nOn Sunday morning Butscha arrived at the Chalet before Madame\nLatournelle, who always came to take Modeste to church, and he proceeded\nto blockade the house in expectation of the postman.\n\n\"Have you a letter for Mademoiselle Mignon?\" he said to that humble\nfunctionary when he appeared.\n\n\"No, monsieur, none.\"\n\n\"This house has been a good customer to the post of late,\" remarked the\nclerk.\n\n\"You may well say that,\" replied the man.\n\nModeste both heard and saw the little colloquy from her chamber window,\nwhere she always posted herself behind the blinds at this particular\nhour to watch for the postman. She ran downstairs, went into the little\ngarden, and called in an imperative voice:--\n\n\"Monsieur Butscha!\"\n\n\"Here am I, mademoiselle,\" said the cripple, reaching the gate as\nModeste herself opened it.\n\n\"Will you be good enough to tell me whether among your various titles to\na woman's affection you count that of the shameless spying in which you\nare now engaged?\" demanded the girl, endeavoring to crush her slave with\nthe glance and gesture of a queen.\n\n\"Yes, mademoiselle,\" he answered proudly. \"Ah! I never expected,\"\nhe continued in a low tone, \"that the grub could be of service to a\nstar,--but so it is. Would you rather that your mother and Monsieur\nDumay and Madame Latournelle had guessed your secret than one, excluded\nas it were from life, who seeks to be to you one of those flowers that\nyou cut and wear for a moment? They all know you love; but I, I alone,\n_know how_. Use me as you would a vigilant watch-dog; I will obey you,\nprotect you, and never bark; neither will I condemn you. I ask only\nto be of service to you. Your father has made Dumay keeper of the\nhen-roost, take Butscha to watch outside,--poor Butscha, who doesn't ask\nfor anything, not so much as a bone.\"\n\n\"Well, I've give you a trial,\" said Modeste, whose strongest desire was\nto get rid of so clever a watcher. \"Please go at once to all the hotels\nin Graville and in Havre, and ask if a gentleman has arrived from\nEngland named Monsieur Arthur--\"\n\n\"Listen to me, mademoiselle,\" said Butscha, interrupting Modeste\nrespectfully. \"I will go and take a walk on the seashore, for you don't\nwant me to go to church to-day; that's what it is.\"\n\nModeste looked at her dwarf with a perfectly stupid astonishment.\n\n\"Mademoiselle, you have wrapped your face in cotton-wool and a silk\nhandkerchief, but there's nothing the matter with you; and you have put\nthat thick veil on your bonnet to see some one yourself without being\nseen.\"\n\n\"Where did you acquire all that perspicacity?\" cried Modeste, blushing.\n\n\"Moreover, mademoiselle, you have not put on your corset; a cold in the\nhead wouldn't oblige you to disfigure your waist and wear half a dozen\npetticoats, nor hide your hands in these old gloves, and your pretty\nfeet in those hideous shoes, nor dress yourself like a beggar-woman,\nnor--\"\n\n\"That's enough,\" she said. \"How am I to be certain that you will obey\nme?\"\n\n\"My master is obliged to go to Sainte-Adresse. He does not like it, but\nhe is so truly good he won't deprive me of my Sunday; I will offer to go\nfor him.\"\n\n\"Go, and I will trust you.\"\n\n\"You are sure I can do nothing for you in Havre?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Hear me, mysterious dwarf,--look,\" she continued, pointing to\nthe cloudless sky; \"can you see a single trace of that bird that flew\nby just now? No; well then, my actions are pure as the air is pure, and\nleave no stain behind them. You may reassure Dumay and the Latournelles,\nand my mother. That hand,\" she said, holding up a pretty delicate hand,\nwith the points of the rosy fingers, through which the light shone,\nslightly turning back, \"will never be given, it will never even be\nkissed by what people call a lover until my father has returned.\"\n\n\"Why don't you want me in the church to-day?\"\n\n\"Do you venture to question me after all I have done you the honor to\nsay, and to ask of you?\"\n\nButscha bowed without another word, and departed to find his master, in\nall the rapture of being taken into the service of his goddess.\n\nHalf an hour later, Monsieur and Madame Latournelle came to fetch\nModeste, who complained of a horrible toothache.\n\n\"I really have not had the courage to dress myself,\" she said.\n\n\"Well then,\" replied the worthy chaperone, \"stay at home.\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" said Modeste. \"I would rather not. I have bundled myself up,\nand I don't think it will do me any harm to go out.\"\n\nAnd Mademoiselle Mignon marched off beside Latournelle, refusing to take\nhis arm lest she should be questioned about the outward trembling which\nbetrayed her inward agitation at the thought of at last seeing her great\npoet. One look, the first,--was it not about to decide her fate?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. A FULL-LENGTH PORTRAIT OF MONSIEUR DE LA BRIERE\n\nIs there in the life of man a more delightful moment than that of a\nfirst rendezvous? Are the sensations then hidden at the bottom of our\nhearts and finding their first expression ever renewed? Can we feel\nagain the nameless pleasures that we felt when, like Ernest de\nLa Briere, we looked up our sharpest razors, our finest shirt, an\nirreproachable collar, and our best clothes? We deify the garments\nassociated with that all-supreme moment. We weave within us poetic\nfancies quite equal to those of the woman; and the day when either party\nguesses them they take wings to themselves and fly away. Are not such\nthings like the flower of wild fruits, bitter-sweet, grown in the heart\nof a forest, the joy of the scant sun-rays, the joy, as Canalis says in\nthe \"Maiden's Song,\" of the plant itself whose eyes unclosing see its\nown image within its breast?\n\nSuch emotions, now taking place in La Briere, tend to show that, like\nother poor fellows for whom life begins in toil and care, he had never\nyet been loved. Arriving at Havre overnight, he had gone to bed at once,\nlike a true coquette, to obliterate all traces of fatigue; and now,\nafter taking his bath, he had put himself into a costume carefully\nadapted to show him off to the best advantage. This is, perhaps, the\nright moment to exhibit a full-length portrait of him, if only to\njustify the last letter that Modeste was still to write to him.\n\nBorn of a good family in Toulouse, and allied by marriage to the\nminister who first took him under his protection, Ernest had that air of\ngood-breeding which comes of an education begun in the cradle; and the\nhabit of managing business affairs gave him a certain sedateness which\nwas not pedantic,--though pedantry is the natural outgrowth of premature\ngravity. He was of ordinary height; his face, which won upon all who saw\nhim by its delicacy and sweetness, was warm in the flesh-tints, though\nwithout color, and relieved by a small moustache and imperial a la\nMazarin. Without this evidence of virility he might have resembled a\nyoung woman in disguise, so refined was the shape of his face and the\ncut of his lips, so feminine the transparent ivory of a set of teeth,\nregular enough to have seemed artificial. Add to these womanly points a\nhabit of speech as gentle as the expression of the face; as gentle,\ntoo, as the blue eyes with their Turkish eyelids, and you will readily\nunderstand how it was that the minister occasionally called his young\nsecretary Mademoiselle de La Briere. The full, clear forehead, well\nframed by abundant black hair, was dreamy, and did not contradict the\ncharacter of the face, which was altogether melancholy. The prominent\narch of the upper eyelid, though very beautifully cut, overshadowed\nthe glance of the eye, and added a physical sadness,--if we may so call\nit,--produced by the droop of the lid over the eyeball. This inward\ndoubt or eclipse--which is put into language by the word modesty--was\nexpressed in his whole person. Perhaps we shall be able to make his\nappearance better understood if we say that the logic of design required\ngreater length in the oval of his head, more space between the chin,\nwhich ended abruptly, and the forehead, which was reduced in height\nby the way in which the hair grew. The face had, in short, a rather\ncompressed appearance. Hard work had already drawn furrows between the\neyebrows, which were somewhat too thick and too near together, like\nthose of a jealous nature. Though La Briere was then slight, he belonged\nto the class of temperaments which begin, after they are thirty, to take\non an unexpected amount of flesh.\n\nThe young man would have seemed to a student of French history a very\nfair representative of the royal and almost inconceivable figure of\nLouis XIII.,--that historical figure of melancholy modesty without\nknown cause; pallid beneath the crown; loving the dangers of war and\nthe fatigues of hunting, but hating work; timid with his mistress to the\nextent of keeping away from her; so indifferent as to allow the head\nof his friend to be cut off,--a figure that nothing can explain but his\nremorse for having avenged his father on his mother. Was he a Catholic\nHamlet, or merely the victim of incurable disease? But the undying worm\nwhich gnawed at the king's vitals was in Ernest's case simply distrust\nof himself,--the timidity of a man to whom no woman had ever said, \"Ah,\nhow I love thee!\" and, above all, the spirit of self-devotion without\nan object. After hearing the knell of the monarchy in the fall of his\npatron's ministry, the poor fellow had next fallen upon a rock covered\nwith exquisite mosses, named Canalis; he was, therefore, still seeking\na power to love, and this spaniel-like search for a master gave him\noutwardly the air of a king who has met with his. This play of feeling,\nand a general tone of suffering in the young man's face made it more\nreally beautiful than he was himself aware of; for he had always\nbeen annoyed to find himself classed by women among the \"handsome\ndisconsolate,\"--a class which has passed out of fashion in these days,\nwhen every man seeks to blow his own trumpet and put himself in the\nadvance.\n\nThe self-distrustful Ernest now rested his immediate hopes on the\nfashionable clothes he intended to wear. He put on, for this sacred\ninterview, where everything depended on a first impression, a pair\nof black trousers and carefully polished boots, a sulphur-colored\nwaistcoat, which left to sight an exquisitely fine shirt with opal\nbuttons, a black cravat, and a small blue surtout coat which seemed\nglued to his back and shoulders by some newly-invented process.\nThe ribbon of the Legion of honor was in his buttonhole. He wore a\nwell-fitting pair of kid gloves of the Florentine bronze color, and\ncarried his cane and hat in the left hand with a gesture and air that\nwas worthy of the Grand Monarch, and enabled him to show, as the\nsacred precincts required, his bare head with the light falling on his\ncarefully arranged hair. He stationed himself before the service began\nin the church porch, from whence he could examine the church, and the\nChristians--more particularly the female Christians--who dipped their\nfingers in the holy water.\n\nAn inward voice cried to Modeste as she entered, \"It is he!\" That\nsurtout, and indeed the whole bearing of the young man were essentially\nParisian; the ribbon, the gloves, the cane, the very perfume of his hair\nwere not of Havre. So when La Briere turned about to examine the\ntall and imposing Madame Latournelle, the notary, and the bundled-up\n(expression sacred to women) figure of Modeste, the poor child, though\nshe had carefully tutored herself for the event, received a violent blow\non her heart when her eyes rested on this poetic figure, illuminated by\nthe full light of day as it streamed through the open door. She could\nnot be mistaken; a small white rose nearly hid the ribbon of the Legion.\nWould he recognize his unknown mistress muffled in an old bonnet with\na double veil? Modeste was so in fear of love's clairvoyance that she\nbegan to stoop in her walk like an old woman.\n\n\"Wife,\" said little Latournelle as they took their seats, \"that\ngentleman does not belong to Havre.\"\n\n\"So many strangers come here,\" answered his wife.\n\n\"But,\" said the notary, \"strangers never come to look at a church like\nours, which is less than two centuries old.\"\n\nErnest remained in the porch throughout the service without seeing any\nwoman who realized his hopes. Modeste, on her part, could not control\nthe trembling of her limbs until Mass was nearly over. She was in the\ngrasp of a joy that none but she herself could depict. At last she heard\nthe foot-fall of a gentleman on the pavement of the aisle. The service\nover, La Briere was making a circuit of the church, where no one now\nremained but the punctiliously pious, whom he proceeded to subject to\na shrewd and keen analysis. Ernest noticed that a prayer-book shook\nviolently in the hands of a veiled woman as he passed her; as she alone\nkept her face hidden his suspicions were aroused, and then confirmed by\nModeste's dress, which the lover's eye now scanned and noted. He left\nthe church with the Latournelles and followed them at a distance to\nthe rue Royale, where he saw them enter a house accompanied by Modeste,\nwhose custom it was to stay with her friends till the hour of vespers.\nAfter examining the little house, which was ornamented with scutcheons,\nhe asked the name of the owner, and was told that he was Monsieur\nLatournelle, the chief notary in Havre. As Ernest lounged along the rue\nRoyale hoping for a glimpse into the house, Modeste caught sight of him,\nand thereupon declared herself too ill to go to vespers. Poor\nErnest thus had his trouble for his pains. He dared not wander about\nIngouville; moreover, he made it a point of honor to obey orders, and\nhe therefore went back to Paris, previously writing a letter which\nFrancoise Cochet duly delivered on the morrow with the Havre postmark.\n\nIt was the custom of Monsieur and Madame Latournelle to dine at the\nChalet every Sunday when they brought back Modeste after vespers. So, as\nsoon as the invalid felt a little better, they started for Ingouville,\naccompanied by Butscha. Once at home, the happy Modeste forgot her\npretended illness and her disguise, and dressed herself charmingly,\nhumming as she came down to dinner,--\n\n  \"Nought is sleeping--Heart! awaking,\n  Lift thine incense to the skies.\"\n\nButscha shuddered slightly when he caught sight of her, so changed did\nshe seem to him. The wings of love were fastened to her shoulders; she\nhad the air of a nymph, a Psyche; her cheeks glowed with the divine\ncolor of happiness.\n\n\"Who wrote the words to which you have put that pretty music?\" asked her\nmother.\n\n\"Canalis, mamma,\" she answered, flushing rosy red from her throat to her\nforehead.\n\n\"Canalis!\" cried the dwarf, to whom the inflections of the girl's voice\nand her blush told the only thing of which he was still ignorant. \"He,\nthat great poet, does he write songs?\"\n\n\"They are only simple verses,\" she said, \"which I have ventured to set\nto German airs.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" interrupted Madame Mignon, \"the music is your own, my\ndaughter.\"\n\nModeste, feeling that she grew more and more crimson, went off into the\ngarden, calling Butscha after her.\n\n\"You can do me a great service,\" she said. \"Dumay is keeping a secret\nfrom my mother and me as to the fortune which my father is bringing back\nwith him; and I want to know what it is. Did not Dumay send papa when\nhe first went away over five hundred thousand francs? Yes. Well, papa is\nnot the kind of man to stay away four years and only double his capital.\nIt seems he is coming back on a ship of his own, and Dumay's share\namounts to almost six hundred thousand francs.\"\n\n\"There is no need to question Dumay,\" said Butscha. \"Your father lost,\nas you know, about four millions when he went away, and he has doubtless\nrecovered them. He would of course give Dumay ten per cent of his\nprofits; the worthy man admitted the other day how much it was, and my\nmaster and I think that in that case the colonel's fortune must amount\nto six or seven millions--\"\n\n\"Oh, papa!\" cried Modeste, crossing her hands on her breast and looking\nup to heaven, \"twice you have given me life!\"\n\n\"Ah, mademoiselle!\" said Butscha, \"you love a poet. That kind of man\nis more or less of a Narcissus. Will he know how to love you? A\nphrase-maker, always busy in fitting words together, must be a bore.\nMademoiselle, a poet is no more poetry than a seed is a flower.\"\n\n\"Butscha, I never saw so handsome a man.\"\n\n\"Beauty is a veil which often serves to hide imperfections.\"\n\n\"He has the most angelic heart of heaven--\"\n\n\"I pray God you may be right,\" said the dwarf, clasping his hands,\n\"--and happy! That man shall have, as you have, a servant in Jean\nButscha. I will not be notary; I shall give that up; I shall study the\nsciences.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Ah, mademoiselle, to train up your children, if you will deign to make\nme their tutor. But, oh! if you would only listen to some advice. Let\nme take up this matter; let me look into the life and habits of this\nman,--find out if he is kind, or bad-tempered, or gentle, if he commands\nthe respect which you merit in a husband, if he is able to love utterly,\npreferring you to everything, even his own talent--\"\n\n\"What does that signify if I love him?\"\n\n\"Ah, true!\" cried the dwarf.\n\nAt that instant Madame Mignon was saying to her friends,--\n\n\"My daughter saw the man she loves this morning.\"\n\n\"Then it must have been that sulphur waistcoat which puzzled you so,\nLatournelle,\" said his wife. \"The young man had a pretty white rose in\nhis buttonhole.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" sighed the mother, \"the sign of recognition.\"\n\n\"And he also wore the ribbon of an officer of the Legion of honor. He is\na charming young man. But we are all deceiving ourselves; Modeste\nnever raised her veil, and her clothes were huddled on like a\nbeggar-woman's--\"\n\n\"And she said she was ill,\" cried the notary; \"but she has taken off her\nmufflings and is just as well as she ever was.\"\n\n\"It is incomprehensible!\" said Dumay.\n\n\"Not at all,\" said the notary; \"it is now as clear as day.\"\n\n\"My child,\" said Madame Mignon to Modeste, as she came into the room,\nfollowed by Butscha, \"did you see a well-dressed young man at church\nthis morning, with a white rose in his button-hole?\"\n\n\"I saw him,\" said Butscha quickly, perceiving by everybody's strained\nattention that Modeste was likely to fall into a trap. \"It was\nGrindot, the famous architect, with whom the town is in treaty for the\nrestoration of the church. He has just come from Paris, and I met\nhim this morning examining the exterior as I was on my way to\nSainte-Adresse.\"\n\n\"Oh, an architect, was he? he puzzled me,\" said Modeste, for whom\nButscha had thus gained time to recover herself.\n\nDumay looked askance at Butscha. Modeste, fully warned, recovered her\nimpenetrable composure. Dumay's distrust was now thoroughly aroused, and\nhe resolved to go the mayor's office early in the morning and ascertain\nif the architect had really been in Havre the previous day. Butscha,\non the other hand, was equally determined to go to Paris and find out\nsomething about Canalis.\n\nGobenheim came to play whist, and by his presence subdued and compressed\nall this fermentation of feelings. Modeste awaited her mother's bedtime\nwith impatience. She intended to write, but never did so except at\nnight. Here is the letter which love dictated to her while all the world\nwas sleeping:--\n\n  To Monsieur de Canalis,--Ah! my friend, my well-beloved! What\n  atrocious falsehoods those portraits in the shop-windows are! And\n  I, who made that horrible lithograph my joy!--I am humbled at the\n  thought of loving one so handsome. No; it is impossible that those\n  Parisian women are so stupid as not to have seen their dreams\n  fulfilled in you. You neglected! you unloved! I do not believe a\n  word of all that you have written me about your lonely and obscure\n  life, your hunger for an idol,--sought in vain until now. You have\n  been too well loved, monsieur; your brow, white and smooth as a\n  magnolia leaf, reveals it; and it is I who must be neglected,--for\n  who am I? Ah! why have you called me to life? I felt for a moment\n  as though the heavy burden of the flesh was leaving me; my soul\n  had broken the crystal which held it captive; it pervaded my whole\n  being; the cold silence of material things had ceased; all things\n  in nature had a voice and spoke to me. The old church was\n  luminous. It's arched roof, brilliant with gold and azure like\n  those of an Italian cathedral, sparkled above my head. Melodies\n  such as the angels sang to martyrs, quieting their pains, sounded\n  from the organ. The rough pavements of Havre seemed to my feet a\n  flowery mead; the sea spoke to me with a voice of sympathy, like\n  an old friend whom I had never truly understood. I saw clearly how\n  the roses in my garden had long adored me and bidden me love; they\n  lifted their heads and smiled as I came back from church. I heard\n  your name, \"Melchior,\" chiming in the flower-bells; I saw it\n  written on the clouds. Yes, yes, I live, I am living, thanks to\n  thee,--my poet, more beautiful than that cold, conventional Lord\n  Byron, with a face as dull as the English climate. One glance of\n  thine, thine Orient glance, pierced through my double veil and\n  sent thy blood to my heart, and from thence to my head and feet.\n  Ah! that is not the life our mother gave us. A hurt to thee would\n  hurt me too at the very instant it was given,--my life exists by\n  thy thought only. I know now the purpose of the divine faculty of\n  music; the angels invented it to utter love. Ah, my Melchior, to\n  have genius and to have beauty is too much; a man should be made\n  to choose between them at his birth.\n\n  When I think of the treasures of tenderness and affection which\n  you have given me, and more especially for the last month, I ask\n  myself if I dream. No, but you hide some mystery; what woman can\n  yield you up to me and not die? Ah! jealousy has entered my heart\n  with love,--love in which I could not have believed. How could I\n  have imagined so mighty a conflagration? And now--strange and\n  inconceivable revulsion!--I would rather you were ugly.\n\n  What follies I committed after I came home! The yellow dahlias\n  reminded me of your waistcoat, the white roses were my loving\n  friends; I bowed to them with a look that belonged to you, like\n  all that is of me. The very color of the gloves, moulded to hands\n  of a gentleman, your step along the nave,--all, all, is so printed\n  on my memory that sixty years hence I shall see the veriest\n  trifles of this day of days,--the color of the atmosphere, the ray\n  of sunshine that flickered on a certain pillar; I shall hear the\n  prayer your step interrupted; I shall inhale the incense of the\n  altar; forever I shall feel above our heads the priestly hands\n  that blessed us both as you passed by me at the closing\n  benediction. The good Abbe Marcelin married us then! The\n  happiness, above that of earth, which I feel in this new world of\n  unexpected emotions can only be equalled by the joy of telling it\n  to you, of sending it back to him who poured it into my heart with\n  the lavishness of the sun itself. No more veils, no more\n  disguises, my beloved. Come back to me, oh, come back soon. With\n  joy I now unmask.\n\n  You have no doubt heard of the house of Mignon in Havre? Well, I\n  am, through an irreparable misfortune, its sole heiress. But you\n  are not to look down upon us, descendant of an Auvergne knight;\n  the arms of the Mignon de La Bastie will do no dishonor to those\n  of Canalis. We bear gules, on a bend sable four bezants or;\n  quarterly four crosses patriarchal or; a cardinal's hat as crest,\n  and the fiocchi for supports. Dear, I will be faithful to our\n  motto: \"Una fides, unus Dominus!\"--the true faith, and one only\n  Master.\n\n  Perhaps, my friend, you will find some irony in my name, after all\n  that I have done, and all that I herein avow. I am named Modeste.\n  Therefore I have not deceived you by signing \"O. d'Este M.\"\n  Neither have I misled you about our fortune; it will amount, I\n  believe, to the sum which rendered you so virtuous. I know that to\n  you money is a consideration of small importance; therefore I\n  speak of it without reserve. Let me tell you how happy it makes me\n  to give freedom of action to our happiness,--to be able to say,\n  when the fancy for travel takes us, \"Come, let us go in a\n  comfortable carriage, sitting side by side, without a thought of\n  money\"--happy, in short, to tell the king, \"I have the fortune\n  which you require in your peers.\" Thus Modeste Mignon can be of\n  service to you, and her gold will have the noblest of uses.\n\n  As to your servant herself,--you did see her once, at her window.\n  Yes, \"the fairest daughter of Eve the fair\" was indeed your\n  unknown damozel; but how little the Modeste of to-day resembles\n  her of that long past era! That one was in her shroud, this one\n  --have I made you know it?--has received from you the life of life.\n  Love, pure, and sanctioned, the love my father, now returning\n  rich and prosperous, will authorize, has raised me with its\n  powerful yet childlike hand from the grave in which I slept. You\n  have wakened me as the sun wakens the flowers. The eyes of your\n  beloved are no longer those of the little Modeste so daring in her\n  ignorance,--no, they are dimmed with the sight of happiness, and\n  the lids close over them. To-day I tremble lest I can never\n  deserve my fate. The king has come in his glory; my lord has now a\n  subject who asks pardon for the liberties she has taken, like the\n  gambler with loaded dice after cheating Monsieur de Grammont.\n\n  My cherished poet! I will be thy Mignon--happier far than the\n  Mignon of Goethe, for thou wilt leave me in mine own land,--in thy\n  heart. Just as I write this pledge of our betrothal a nightingale\n  in the Vilquin park answers for thee. Ah, tell me quick that his\n  note, so pure, so clear, so full, which fills my heart with joy\n  and love like an Annunciation, does not lie to me.\n\n  My father will pass through Paris on his way from Marseilles; the\n  house of Mongenod, with whom he corresponds, will know his\n  address. Go to him, my Melchior, tell him that you love me; but do\n  not try to tell him how I love you,--let that be forever between\n  ourselves and God. I, my dear one, am about to tell everything to\n  my mother. Her heart will justify my conduct; she will rejoice in\n  our secret poem, so romantic, human and divine in one.\n\n  You have the confession of the daughter; you must now obtain the\n  consent of the Comte de La Bastie, father of your\n\nModeste.\n\n\n  P.S.--Above all, do not come to Havre without having first\n  obtained my father's consent. If you love me you will not fail to\n  find him on his way through Paris.\n\n\n\"What are you doing, up at this hour, Mademoiselle Modeste?\" said the\nvoice of Dumay at her door.\n\n\"Writing to my father,\" she answered; \"did you not tell me you should\nstart in the morning?\"\n\nDumay had nothing to say to that, and he went to bed, while Modeste\nwrote another long letter, this time to her father.\n\nOn the morrow, Francois Cochet, terrified at seeing the Havre postmark\non the envelope which Ernest had mailed the night before, brought her\nyoung mistress the following letter and took away the one which Modeste\nhad written:--\n\n  To Mademoiselle O. d'Este M.,--My heart tells me that you were the\n  woman so carefully veiled and disguised, and seated between\n  Monsieur and Madame Latournelle, who have but one child, a son.\n  Ah, my love, if you have only a modest station, without\n  distinction, without importance, without money even, you do not\n  know how happy that would make me. You ought to understand me by\n  this time; why will you not tell me the truth? I am no poet,\n  --except in heart, through love, through you. Oh! what power of\n  affection there is in me to keep me here in this hotel, instead of\n  mounting to Ingouville which I can see from my windows. Will you\n  ever love me as I love you? To leave Havre in such uncertainty! Am\n  I not punished for loving you as if I had committed a crime? But I\n  obey you blindly. Let me have a letter quickly, for if you have\n  been mysterious, I have returned you mystery for mystery, and I\n  must at last throw off my disguise, show you the poet that I am,\n  and abdicate my borrowed glory.\n\nThis letter made Modeste terribly uneasy. She could not get back the\none which Francoise had carried away before she came to the last words,\nwhose meaning she now sought by reading them again and again; but\nshe went to her own room and wrote an answer in which she demanded an\nimmediate explanation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. MATTERS GROWN COMPLICATED\n\nDuring these little events other little events were going on in Havre,\nwhich caused Modeste to forget her present uneasiness. Dumay went down\nto Havre early in the morning, and soon discovered that no architect had\nbeen in town the day before. Furious at Butscha's lie, which revealed a\nconspiracy of which he was resolved to know the meaning, he rushed from\nthe mayor's office to his friend Latournelle.\n\n\"Where's your Master Butscha?\" he demanded of the notary, when he saw\nthat the clerk was not in his place.\n\n\"Butscha, my dear fellow, has gone to Paris. He heard some news of his\nfather this morning on the quays, from a Swedish sailor. It seems the\nfather went to the Indies and served a prince, or something, and he is\nnow in Paris.\"\n\n\"Lies! it's all a trick! infamous! I'll find that damned cripple if I've\ngot to go express to Paris for him,\" cried Dumay. \"Butscha is deceiving\nus; he knows something about Modeste, and hasn't told us. If he meddles\nin this thing he shall never be a notary. I'll roll him in the mud from\nwhich he came, I'll--\"\n\n\"Come, come, my friend; never hang a man before you try him,\" said\nLatournelle, frightened at Dumay's rage.\n\nAfter stating the facts on which his suspicions were founded, Dumay\nbegged Madame Latournelle to go and stay at the Chalet during his\nabsence.\n\n\"You will find the colonel in Paris,\" said the notary. \"In the shipping\nnews quoted this morning in the Journal of Commerce, I found under\nthe head of Marseilles--here, see for yourself,\" he said, offering the\npaper. \"'The Bettina Mignon, Captain Mignon, arrived October 6'; it is\nnow the 17th, and the colonel is sure to be in Paris.\"\n\nDumay requested Gobenheim to do without him in future, and then went\nback to the Chalet, which he reached just as Modeste was sealing her two\nletters, to her father and Canalis. Except for the address the letters\nwere precisely alike both in weight and appearance. Modeste thought she\nhad laid that to her father over that to her Melchior, but had, in fact,\ndone exactly the reverse. This mistake, so often made in the little\nthings of life, occasioned the discovery of her secret by Dumay and her\nmother. The former was talking vehemently to Madame Mignon in the salon,\nand revealing to her his fresh fears caused by Modeste's duplicity and\nButscha's connivance.\n\n\"Madame,\" he cried, \"he is a serpent whom we have warmed in our bosoms;\nthere's no place in his contorted little body for a soul!\"\n\nModeste put the letter for her father into the pocket of her apron,\nsupposing it to be that for Canalis, and came downstairs with the letter\nfor her lover in her hand, to see Dumay before he started for Paris.\n\n\"What has happened to my Black Dwarf? why are you talking so loud!\" she\nsaid, appearing at the door.\n\n\"Mademoiselle, Butscha has gone to Paris, and you, no doubt, know\nwhy,--to carry on that affair of the little architect with the sulphur\nwaistcoat, who, unluckily for the hunchback's lies, has never been\nhere.\"\n\nModeste was struck dumb; feeling sure that the dwarf had departed on\na mission of inquiry as to her poet's morals, she turned pale, and sat\ndown.\n\n\"I'm going after him; I shall find him,\" continued Dumay. \"Is that the\nletter for your father, mademoiselle?\" he added, holding out his hand.\n\"I will take it to the Mongenods. God grant the colonel and I may not\npass each other on the road.\"\n\nModeste gave him the letter. Dumay looked mechanically at the address.\n\n\"'Monsieur le Baron de Canalis, rue de Paradis-Poissoniere, No. 29'!\" he\ncried out; \"what does that mean?\"\n\n\"Ah, my daughter! that is the man you love,\" exclaimed Madame Mignon;\n\"the stanzas you set to music were his--\"\n\n\"And that's his portrait that you have in a frame upstairs,\" added\nDumay.\n\n\"Give me back that letter, Monsieur Dumay,\" said Modeste, erecting\nherself like a lioness defending her cubs.\n\n\"There it is, mademoiselle,\" he replied.\n\nModeste put it into the bosom of her dress, and gave Dumay the one\nintended for her father.\n\n\"I know what you are capable of, Dumay,\" she said; \"and if you take\none step against Monsieur de Canalis, I shall take another out of this\nhouse, to which I will never return.\"\n\n\"You will kill your mother, mademoiselle,\" replied Dumay, who left the\nroom and called his wife.\n\nThe poor mother was indeed half-fainting,--struck to the heart by\nModeste's words.\n\n\"Good-bye, wife,\" said the Breton, kissing the American. \"Take care of\nthe mother; I go to save the daughter.\"\n\nHe made his preparations for the journey in a few minutes, and started\nfor Havre. An hour later he was travelling post to Paris, with the haste\nthat nothing but passion or speculation can get out of wheels.\n\nRecovering herself under Modeste's tender care, Madame Mignon went up to\nher bedroom leaning on the arm of her daughter, to whom she said, as her\nsole reproach, when they were alone:--\n\n\"My unfortunate child, see what you have done! Why did you conceal\nanything from me? Am I so harsh?\"\n\n\"Oh! I was just going to tell it to you comfortably,\" sobbed Modeste.\n\nShe thereupon related everything to her mother, read her the letters\nand their answers, and shed the rose of her poem petal by petal into the\nheart of the kind German woman. When this confidence, which took half\nthe day, was over, when she saw something that was almost a smile on the\nlips of the too indulgent mother, Modeste fell upon her breast in tears.\n\n\"Oh, mother!\" she said amid her sobs, \"you, whose heart, all gold and\npoetry, is a chosen vessel, chosen of God to hold a sacred love, a\nsingle and celestial love that endures for life; you, whom I wish to\nimitate by loving no one but my husband,--you will surely understand\nwhat bitter tears I am now shedding. This butterfly, this Psyche of my\nthoughts, this dual soul which I have nurtured with maternal care, my\nlove, my sacred love, this living mystery of mysteries--it is about to\nfall into vulgar hands, and they will tear its diaphanous wings and rend\nits veil under the miserable pretext of enlightening me, of discovering\nwhether genius is as prudent as a banker, whether my Melchior has saved\nhis money, or whether he has some entanglement to shake off; they\nwant to find out if he is guilty to bourgeois eyes of youthful\nindiscretions,--which to the sun of our love are like the clouds of the\ndawn. Oh! what will come of it? what will they do? See! feel my hand, it\nburns with fever. Ah! I shall never survive it.\"\n\nAnd Modeste, really taken with a chill, was forced to go to bed, causing\nserious uneasiness to her mother, Madame Latournelle, and Madame Dumay,\nwho took good care of her during the journey of the lieutenant to\nParis,--to which city the logic of events compels us to transport our\ndrama for a moment.\n\nTruly modest minds, like that of Ernest de La Briere, but especially\nthose who, knowing their own value, also know that they are neither\nloved nor appreciated, can understand the infinite joy to which the\nyoung secretary abandoned himself on reading Modeste's letter. Could\nit be that after thinking him lofty and witty in soul, his young, his\nartless, his tricksome mistress now thought him handsome? This flattery\nis the flattery supreme. And why? Beauty is, undoubtedly, the signature\nof the master to the work into which he has put his soul; it is the\ndivine spirit manifested. And to see it where it is not, to create it by\nthe power of an inward look,--is not that the highest reach of love?\nAnd so the poor youth cried aloud with all the rapture of an applauded\nauthor, \"At last I am beloved!\" When a woman, be she maid, wife, or\nwidow, lets the charming words escape her, \"Thou art handsome,\" the\nwords may be false, but the man opens his thick skull to their subtle\npoison, and thenceforth he is attached by an everlasting tie to the\npretty flatterer, the true or the deceived judge; she becomes his\nparticular world, he thirsts for her continual testimony, and he never\nwearies of it, even if he is a crowned prince. Ernest walked proudly\nup and down his room; he struck a three-quarter, full-face, and profile\nattitude before the glass; he tried to criticise himself; but a voice,\ndiabolically persuasive, whispered to him, \"Modeste is right.\" He took\nup her letter and re-read it; he saw his fairest of the fair; he talked\nwith her; then, in the midst of his ecstacy, a dreadful thought came to\nhim:--\n\n\"She thinks me Canalis, and she has a million of money!\"\n\nDown went his happiness, just as a somnambulist, having attained the\npeak of a roof, hears a voice, awakes, and falls crushed upon the\npavement.\n\n\"Without the halo of fame I shall be hideous in her eyes,\" he cried;\n\"what a maddening situation I have put myself in!\"\n\nLa Briere was too much the man of his letters which we have read, his\nheart was too noble and pure to allow him to hesitate at the call of\nhonor. He at once resolved to find Modeste's father, if he were in\nParis, and confess all to him, and to let Canalis know the serious\nresults of their Parisian jest. To a sensitive nature like his,\nModeste's large fortune was in itself a determining reason. He could not\nallow it to be even suspected that the ardor of the correspondence, so\nsincere on his part, had in view the capture of a \"dot.\" Tears were in\nhis eyes as he made his way to the rue Chantereine to find the banker\nMongenod, whose fortune and business connections were partly the work of\nthe minister to whom Ernest owed his start in life.\n\nAt the hour when La Briere was inquiring about the father of his beloved\nfrom the head of the house of Mongenod, and getting information that\nmight be useful to him in his strange position, a scene was taking place\nin Canalis's study which the ex-lieutenant's hasty departure from Havre\nmay have led the reader to foresee.\n\nLike a true soldier of the imperial school, Dumay, whose Breton blood\nhad boiled all the way to Paris, considered a poet to be a poor stick of\na fellow, of no consequence whatever,--a buffoon addicted to choruses,\nliving in a garret, dressed in black clothes that were white at every\nseam, wearing boots that were occasionally without soles, and linen that\nwas unmentionable, and whose fingers knew more about ink than soap; in\nshort, one who looked always as if he had tumbled from the moon,\nexcept when scribbling at a desk, like Butscha. But the seething of the\nBreton's heart and brain received a violent application of cold water\nwhen he entered the courtyard of the pretty house occupied by the poet\nand saw a groom washing a carriage, and also, through the windows of a\nhandsome dining-room, a valet dressed like a banker, to whom the groom\nreferred him, and who answered, looking the stranger over from head to\nfoot, that Monsieur le baron was not visible. \"There is,\" added the man,\n\"a meeting of the council of state to-day, at which Monsieur le baron is\nobliged to be present.\"\n\n\"Is this really the house of Monsieur Canalis,\" said Dumay, \"a writer of\npoetry?\"\n\n\"Monsieur le baron de Canalis,\" replied the valet, \"is the great poet\nof whom you speak; but he is also the president of the court of Claims\nattached to the ministry of foreign affairs.\"\n\nDumay, who had come to box the ears of a scribbling nobody, found\nhimself confronted by a high functionary of the state. The salon\nwhere he was told to wait offered, as a topic for his meditations, the\ninsignia of the Legion of honor glittering on a black coat which the\nvalet had left upon a chair. Presently his eyes were attracted by the\nbeauty and brilliancy of a silver-gilt cup bearing the words \"Given by\n_Madame_.\" Then he beheld before him, on a pedestal, a Sevres vase on\nwhich was engraved, \"The gift of Madame la _Dauphine_.\"\n\nThese mute admonitions brought Dumay to his senses while the valet went\nto ask his master if he would receive a person who had come from Havre\nexpressly to see him,--a stranger named Dumay.\n\n\"What sort of a man?\" asked Canalis.\n\n\"He is well-dressed, and wears the ribbon of the Legion of honor.\"\n\nCanalis made a sign of assent, and the valet retreated, and then\nreturned and announced, \"Monsieur Dumay.\"\n\nWhen he heard himself announced, when he was actually in presence of\nCanalis, in a study as gorgeous as it was elegant, with his feet on a\ncarpet far handsomer than any in the house of Mignon, and when he met\nthe studied glance of the poet who was playing with the tassels of a\nsumptuous dressing-gown, Dumay was so completely taken aback that he\nallowed the great poet to have the first word.\n\n\"To what do I owe the honor of your visit, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" began Dumay, who remained standing.\n\n\"If you have a good deal to say,\" interrupted Canalis, \"I must ask you\nto be seated.\"\n\nAnd Canalis himself plunged into an armchair a la Voltaire, crossed his\nlegs, raised the upper one to the level of his eye and looked fixedly at\nDumay, who became, to use his own martial slang, \"bayonetted.\"\n\n\"I am listening, monsieur,\" said the poet; \"my time is precious,--the\nministers are expecting me.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Dumay, \"I shall be brief. You have seduced--how, I do\nnot know--a young lady in Havre, young, beautiful, and rich; the\nlast and only hope of two noble families; and I have come to ask your\nintentions.\"\n\nCanalis, who had been busy during the last three months with serious\nmatters of his own, and was trying to get himself made commander of the\nLegion of honor and minister to a German court, had completely forgotten\nModeste's letter.\"\n\n\"I!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"You!\" repeated Dumay.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" answered Canalis, smiling; \"I know no more of what you are\ntalking about than if you had said it in Hebrew. I seduce a young\ngirl! I, who--\" and a superb smile crossed his features. \"Come, come,\nmonsieur, I'm not such a child as to steal fruit over the hedges when I\nhave orchards and gardens of my own where the finest peaches ripen. All\nParis knows where my affections are set. Very likely there may be some\nyoung girl in Havre full of enthusiasm for my verses,--of which they are\nnot worthy; that would not surprise me at all; nothing is more common.\nSee! look at that lovely coffer of ebony inlaid with mother-of-pearl,\nand edged with that iron-work as fine as lace. That coffer belonged\nto Pope Leo X., and was given to me by the Duchesse de Chaulieu, who\nreceived it from the king of Spain. I use it to hold the letters I\nreceive from ladies and young girls living in every quarter of Europe.\nOh! I assure you I feel the utmost respect for these flowers of the\nsoul, cut and sent in moments of enthusiasm that are worthy of all\nreverence. Yes, to me the impulse of a heart is a noble and sublime\nthing! Others--scoffers--light their cigars with such letters, or give\nthem to their wives for curl-papers; but I, who am a bachelor, monsieur,\nI have too much delicacy not to preserve these artless offerings--so\nfresh, so disinterested--in a tabernacle of their own. In fact, I guard\nthem with a species of veneration, and at my death they will be burned\nbefore my eyes. People may call that ridiculous, but I do not care. I am\ngrateful; these proofs of devotion enable me to bear the criticisms and\nannoyances of a literary life. When I receive a shot in the back from\nsome enemy lurking under cover of a daily paper, I look at that casket\nand think,--here and there in this wide world there are hearts whose\nwounds have been healed, or soothed, or dressed by me!\"\n\nThis bit of poetry, declaimed with all the talent of a great actor,\npetrified the lieutenant, whose eyes opened to their utmost extent, and\nwhose astonishment delighted the poet.\n\n\"I will permit you,\" continued the peacock, spreading his tail, \"out of\nrespect for your position, which I fully appreciate, to open that coffer\nand look for the letter of your young lady. Though I know I am right, I\nremember names, and I assure you you are mistaken in thinking--\"\n\n\"And this is what a poor child comes to in this gulf of Paris!\" cried\nDumay,--\"the darling of her parents, the joy of her friends, the hope\nof all, petted by all, the pride of a family, who has six persons so\ndevoted to her that they would willingly make a rampart of their lives\nand fortunes between her and sorrow. Monsieur,\" Dumay remarked after a\npause, \"you are a great poet, and I am only a poor soldier. For fifteen\nyears I served my country in the ranks; I have had the wind of many a\nbullet in my face; I have crossed Siberia and been a prisoner there; the\nRussians flung me on a kibitka, and God knows what I suffered. I have\nseen thousands of my comrades die,--but you, you have given me a chill\nto the marrow of my bones, such as I never felt before.\"\n\nDumay fancied that his words moved the poet, but in fact they only\nflattered him,--a thing which at this period of his life had become\nalmost an impossibility; for his ambitious mind had long forgotten the\nfirst perfumed phial that praise had broken over his head.\n\n\"Ah, my soldier!\" he said solemnly, laying his hand on Dumay's shoulder,\nand thinking to himself how droll it was to make a soldier of the empire\ntremble, \"this young girl may be all in all to you, but to society at\nlarge what is she? nothing. At this moment the greatest mandarin in\nChina may be yielding up the ghost and putting half the universe in\nmourning, and what is that to you? The English are killing thousands of\npeople in India more worthy than we are; why, at this very moment while\nI am speaking to you some ravishing woman is being burned alive,--did\nthat make you care less for your cup of coffee this morning at\nbreakfast? Not a day passes in Paris that some mother in rags does not\ncast her infant on the world to be picked up by whoever finds it; and\nyet see! here is this delicious tea in a cup that cost five louis, and\nI write verses which Parisian women rush to buy, exclaiming, 'Divine!\ndelicious! charming! food for the soul!' Social nature, like Nature\nherself, is a great forgetter. You will be quite surprised ten years\nhence at what you have done to-day. You are here in a city where people\ndie, where they marry, where they adore each other at an assignation,\nwhere young girls suffocate themselves, where the man of genius with\nhis cargo of thoughts teeming with humane beneficence goes to the\nbottom,--all side by side, sometimes under the same roof, and yet\nignorant of each other, ignorant and indifferent. And here you come\namong us and ask us to expire with grief at this commonplace affair.\"\n\n\"You call yourself a poet!\" cried Dumay, \"but don't you feel what you\nwrite?\"\n\n\"Good heavens! if we endured the joys or the woes we sing we should\nbe as worn out in three months as a pair of old boots,\" said the poet,\nsmiling. \"But stay, you shall not come from Havre to Paris to see\nCanalis without carrying something back with you. Warrior!\" (Canalis had\nthe form and action of an Homeric hero) \"learn this from the poet: Every\nnoble sentiment in man is a poem so exclusively individual that his\nnearest friend, his other self, cares nothing for it. It is a treasure\nwhich is his alone, it is--\"\n\n\"Forgive me for interrupting you,\" said Dumay, who was gazing at the\npoet with horror, \"but did you ever come to Havre?\"\n\n\"I was there for a day and a night in the spring of 1824 on my way to\nLondon.\"\n\n\"You are a man of honor,\" continued Dumay; \"will you give me your word\nthat you do not know Mademoiselle Modeste Mignon?\"\n\n\"This is the first time that name ever struck my ear,\" replied Canalis.\n\n\"Ah, monsieur!\" said Dumay, \"into what dark intrigue am I about to\nplunge? Can I count upon you to help me in my inquiries?--for I am\ncertain that some one has been using your name. You ought to have had a\nletter yesterday from Havre.\"\n\n\"I received none. Be sure, monsieur, that I will help you,\" said\nCanalis, \"so far as I have the opportunity of doing so.\"\n\nDumay withdrew, his heart torn with anxiety, believing that the wretched\nButscha had worn the skin of the poet to deceive Modeste; whereas\nButscha himself, keen-witted as a prince seeking revenge, and far\ncleverer than any paid spy, was ferretting out the life and actions\nof Canalis, escaping notice by his insignificance, like an insect that\nbores its way into the sap of a tree.\n\nThe Breton had scarcely left the poet's house when La Briere entered his\nfriend's study. Naturally, Canalis told him of the visit of the man from\nHavre.\n\n\"Ha!\" said Ernest, \"Modeste Mignon; that is just what I have come to\nspeak of.\"\n\n\"Ah, bah!\" cried Canalis; \"have I had a triumph by proxy?\"\n\n\"Yes; and here is the key to it. My friend, I am loved by the sweetest\ngirl in all the world,--beautiful enough to shine beside the greatest\nbeauties in Paris, with a heart and mind worthy of Clarissa. She has\nseen me; I have pleased her, and she thinks me the great Canalis. But\nthat is not all. Modeste Mignon is of high birth, and Mongenod has just\ntold me that her father, the Comte de La Bastie, has something like six\nmillions. The father is here now, and I have asked him through Mongenod\nfor an interview at two o'clock. Mongenod is to give him a hint, just\na word, that it concerns the happiness of his daughter. But you will\nreadily understand that before seeing the father I feel I ought to make\na clean breast of it to you.\"\n\n\"Among the plants whose flowers bloom in the sunshine of fame,\" said\nCanalis, impressively, \"there is one, and the most magnificent, which\nbears like the orange-tree a golden fruit amid the mingled perfumes of\nbeauty and of mind; a lovely plant, a true tenderness, a perfect bliss,\nand--it eludes me.\" Canalis looked at the carpet that Ernest might\nnot read his eyes. \"Could I,\" he continued after a pause to regain his\nself-possession, \"how could I have divined that flower from a pretty\nsheet of perfumed paper, that true heart, that young girl, that woman in\nwhom love wears the livery of flattery, who loves us for ourselves, who\noffers us felicity? It needed but an angel or a demon to perceive\nher; and what am I but the ambitious head of a Court of Claims! Ah, my\nfriend, fame makes us the target of a thousand arrows. One of us\nowes his rich marriage to an hydraulic piece of poetry, while I, more\nseductive, more a woman's man than he, have missed mine,--for, do you\nlove her, poor girl?\" he said, looking up at La Briere.\n\n\"Oh!\" ejaculated the young man.\n\n\"Well then,\" said the poet, taking his secretary's arm and leaning\nheavily upon it, \"be happy, Ernest. By a mere accident I have been not\nungrateful to you. You are richly rewarded for your devotion, and I will\ngenerously further your happiness.\"\n\nCanalis was furious; but he could not behave otherwise than with\npropriety, and he made the best of his disappointment by mounting it as\na pedestal.\n\n\"Ah, Canalis, I have never really known you till this moment.\"\n\n\"Did you expect to? It takes some time to go round the world,\" replied\nthe poet with his pompous irony.\n\n\"But think,\" said La Briere, \"of this enormous fortune.\"\n\n\"Ah, my friend, is it not well invested in you?\" cried Canalis,\naccompanying the words with a charming gesture.\n\n\"Melchior,\" said La Briere, \"I am yours for life and death.\"\n\nHe wrung the poet's hand and left him abruptly, for he was in haste to\nmeet Monsieur Mignon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. A FATHER STEPS IN\n\nThe Comte de La Bastie was at this moment overwhelmed with the sorrows\nwhich lay in wait for him as their prey. He had learned from his\ndaughter's letter of Bettina's death and of his wife's infirmity, and\nDumay related to him, when they met, his terrible perplexity as to\nModeste's love affairs.\n\n\"Leave me to myself,\" he said to his faithful friend.\n\nAs the lieutenant closed the door, the unhappy father threw himself on a\nsofa, with his head in his hands, weeping those slow, scanty tears which\nsuffuse the eyes of a man of sixty, but do not fall,--tears soon dried,\nyet quick to start again,--the last dews of the human autumn.\n\n\"To have children, to have a wife, to adore them--what is it but to have\nmany hearts and bare them to a dagger?\" he cried, springing up with the\nbound of a tiger and walking up and down the room. \"To be a father is\nto give one's self over, bound hand and foot to sorrow. If I meet that\nD'Estourny I will kill him. To have daughters!--one gives her life to a\nscoundrel, the other, my Modeste, falls a victim to whom? a coward, who\ndeceives her with the gilded paper of a poet. If it were Canalis himself\nit might not be so bad; but that Scapin of a lover!--I will strangle him\nwith my two hands,\" he cried, making an involuntary gesture of furious\ndetermination. \"And what then? suppose my Modeste were to die of grief?\"\n\nHe gazed mechanically out of the windows of the hotel des Princes, and\nthen returned to the sofa, where he sat motionless. The fatigues of\nsix voyages to India, the anxieties of speculation, the dangers he\nhad encountered and evaded, and his many griefs, had silvered Charles\nMignon's head. His handsome soldierly face, so pure in outline and now\nbronzed by the suns of China and the southern seas, had acquired an air\nof dignity which his present grief rendered almost sublime.\n\n\"Mongenod told me he felt confidence in the young man who is coming to\nask me for my daughter,\" he thought at last; and at this moment Ernest\nde La Briere was announced by one of the servants whom Monsieur de La\nBastie had attached to himself during the last four years.\n\n\"You have come, monsieur, from my friend Mongenod?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Ernest, growing timid when he saw before him a face as\nsombre as Othello's. \"My name is Ernest de La Briere, related to the\nfamily of the late cabinet minister, and his private secretary during\nhis term of office. On his dismissal, his Excellency put me in the Court\nof Claims, to which I am legal counsel, and where I may possibly succeed\nas chief--\"\n\n\"And how does all this concern Mademoiselle de La Bastie?\" asked the\ncount.\n\n\"Monsieur, I love her; and I have the unhoped-for happiness of being\nloved by her. Hear me, monsieur,\" cried Ernest, checking a violent\nmovement on the part of the angry father. \"I have the strangest\nconfession to make to you, a shameful one for a man of honor; but the\nworst punishment of my conduct, natural enough in itself, is not\nthe telling of it to you; no, I fear the daughter even more than the\nfather.\"\n\nErnest then related simply, and with the nobleness that comes of\nsincerity, all the facts of his little drama, not omitting the twenty or\nmore letters, which he had brought with him, nor the interview which he\nhad just had with Canalis. When Monsieur Mignon had finished reading the\nletters, the unfortunate lover, pale and suppliant, actually trembled\nunder the fiery glance of the Provencal.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the latter, \"in this whole matter there is but one\nerror, but that is cardinal. My daughter will not have six millions;\nat the utmost, she will have a marriage portion of two hundred thousand\nfrancs, and very doubtful expectations.\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur!\" cried Ernest, rising and grasping Monsieur Mignon's\nhand; \"you take a load from my breast. Nothing can now hinder my\nhappiness. I have friends, influence; I shall certainly be chief of\nthe Court of Claims. Had Mademoiselle Mignon no more than ten thousand\nfrancs, if I had even to make a settlement on her, she should still be\nmy wife; and to make her happy as you, monsieur, have made your wife\nhappy, to be to you a real son (for I have no father), are the deepest\ndesires of my heart.\"\n\nCharles Mignon stepped back three paces and fixed upon La Briere a look\nwhich entered the eyes of the young man as a dagger enters its sheath;\nhe stood silent a moment, recognizing the absolute candor, the pure\ntruthfulness of that open nature in the light of the young man's\ninspired eyes. \"Is fate at last weary of pursuing me?\" he asked himself.\n\"Am I to find in this young man the pearl of sons-in-law?\" He walked up\nand down the room in strong agitation.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" he said at last, \"you are bound to submit wholly to the\njudgment which you have come here to seek, otherwise you are now playing\na farce.\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur!\"\n\n\"Listen to me,\" said the father, nailing La Briere where he stood with a\nglance. \"I shall be neither harsh, nor hard, nor unjust. You shall have\nthe advantages and the disadvantages of the false position in which you\nhave placed yourself. My daughter believes that she loves one of the\ngreat poets of the day, whose fame is really that which has attracted\nher. Well, I, her father, intend to give her the opportunity to choose\nbetween the celebrity which has been a beacon to her, and the poor\nreality which the irony of fate has flung at her feet. Ought she not\nto choose between Canalis and yourself? I rely upon your honor not to\nrepeat what I have told you as to the state of my affairs. You may each\ncome, I mean you and your friend the Baron de Canalis, to Havre for the\nlast two weeks of October. My house will be open to both of you, and my\ndaughter must have an opportunity to study you. You must yourself bring\nyour rival, and not disabuse him as to the foolish tales he will hear\nabout the wealth of the Comte de La Bastie. I go to Havre to-morrow, and\nI shall expect you three days later. Adieu, monsieur.\"\n\nPoor La Briere went back to Canalis with a dragging step. The poet,\nmeantime, left to himself, had given way to a current of thought out\nof which had come that secondary impulse which Monsieur de Talleyrand\nvalued so much. The first impulse is the voice of nature, the second\nthat of society.\n\n\"A girl worth six millions,\" he thought to himself, \"and my eyes were\nnot able to see that gold shining in the darkness! With such a fortune\nI could be peer of France, count, marquis, ambassador. I've replied\nto middle-class women and silly women, and crafty creatures who wanted\nautographs; I've tired myself to death with masked-ball intrigues,--at\nthe very moment when God was sending me a soul of price, an angel with\ngolden wings! Bah! I'll make a poem on it, and perhaps the chance will\ncome again. Heavens! the luck of that little La Briere,--strutting about\nin my lustre--plagiarism! I'm the cast and he's to be the statue, is\nhe? It is the old fable of Bertrand and Raton. Six millions, a beauty,\na Mignon de La Bastie, an aristocratic divinity loving poetry and the\npoet! And I, who showed my muscle as man of the world, who did those\nAlcide exercises to silence by moral force the champion of physical\nforce, that old soldier with a heart, that friend of this very young\ngirl, whom he'll now go and tell that I have a heart of iron!--I, to\nplay Napoleon when I ought to have been seraphic! Good heavens! True, I\nshall have my friend. Friendship is a beautiful thing. I have kept him,\nbut at what a price! Six millions, that's the cost of it; we can't have\nmany friends if we pay all that for them.\"\n\nLa Briere entered the room as Canalis reached this point in his\nmeditations. He was gloom personified.\n\n\"Well, what's the matter?\" said Canalis.\n\n\"The father exacts that his daughter shall choose between the two\nCanalis--\"\n\n\"Poor boy!\" cried the poet, laughing, \"he's a clever fellow, that\nfather.\"\n\n\"I have pledged my honor that I will take you to Havre,\" said La Briere,\npiteously.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said Canalis, \"if it is a question of your honor you\nmay count on me. I'll ask for leave of absence for a month.\"\n\n\"Modeste is so beautiful!\" exclaimed La Briere, in a despairing tone.\n\"You will crush me out of sight. I wondered all along that fate should\nbe so kind to me; I knew it was all a mistake.\"\n\n\"Bah! we will see about that,\" said Canalis with inhuman gaiety.\n\nThat evening, after dinner, Charles Mignon and Dumay, were flying,\nby virtue of three francs to each postilion, from Paris to Havre.\nThe father had eased the watch-dog's mind as to Modeste and her love\naffairs; the guard was relieved, and Butscha's innocence established.\n\n\"It is all for the best, my old Dumay,\" said the count, who had been\nmaking certain inquiries of Mongenod respecting Canalis and La Briere.\n\"We are going to have two actors for one part!\" he cried gaily.\n\nNevertheless, he requested his old comrade to be absolutely silent about\nthe comedy which was now to be played at the Chalet,--a comedy it might\nbe, but also a gentle punishment, or, if you prefer it, a lesson given\nby the father to the daughter.\n\nThe two friends kept up a long conversation all the way from Paris to\nHavre, which put the colonel in possession of the facts relating to his\nfamily during the past four years, and informing Dumay that Desplein,\nthe great surgeon, was coming to Havre at the end of the present month\nto examine the cataract on Madame Mignon's eyes, and decide if it were\npossible to restore her sight.\n\nA few moments before the breakfast-hour at the Chalet, the clacking of\na postilion's whip apprised the family that the two soldiers were\narriving; only a father's joy at returning after long absence could be\nheralded with such clatter, and it brought all the women to the garden\ngate. There is many a father and many a child--perhaps more fathers than\nchildren--who will understand the delights of such an arrival, and that\nhappy fact shows that literature has no need to depict it. Perhaps all\ngentle and tender emotions are beyond the range of literature.\n\nNot a word that could trouble the peace of the family was uttered on\nthis joyful day. Truce was tacitly established between father, mother,\nand child as to the so-called mysterious love which had paled Modeste's\ncheeks,--for this was the first day she had left her bed since Dumay's\ndeparture for Paris. The colonel, with the charming delicacy of a\ntrue soldier, never left his wife's side nor released her hand; but he\nwatched Modeste with delight, and was never weary of noting her refined,\nelegant, and poetic beauty. Is it not by such seeming trifles that we\nrecognize a man of feeling? Modeste, who feared to interrupt the subdued\njoy of the husband and wife kept at a little distance, coming from time\nto time to kiss her father's forehead, and when she kissed it overmuch\nshe seemed to mean that she was kissing it for two,--for Bettina and\nherself.\n\n\"Oh, my darling, I understand you,\" said the colonel, pressing her hand\nas she assailed him with kisses.\n\n\"Hush!\" whispered the young girl, glancing at her mother.\n\nDumay's rather sly and pregnant silence made Modeste somewhat uneasy as\nto the upshot of his journey to Paris. She looked at him furtively\nevery now and then, without being able to get beneath his epidermis.\nThe colonel, like a prudent father, wanted to study the character of\nhis only daughter, and above all consult his wife, before entering on a\nconference upon which the happiness of the whole family depended.\n\n\"To-morrow, my precious child,\" he said as they parted for the night,\n\"get up early, and we will go and take a walk on the seashore. We have\nto talk about your poems, Mademoiselle de La Bastie.\"\n\nHis last words, accompanied by a smile, which reappeared like an echo\non Dumay's lips, were all that gave Modeste any clew to what was coming;\nbut it was enough to calm her uneasiness and keep her awake far into the\nnight with her head full of suppositions; this, however, did not prevent\nher from being dressed and ready in the morning long before the colonel.\n\n\"You know all, my kind papa?\" she said as soon as they were on the road\nto the beach.\n\n\"I know all, and a good deal more than you do,\" he replied.\n\nAfter that remark father and daughter went some little way in silence.\n\n\"Explain to me, my child, how it happens that a girl whom her mother\nidolizes could have taken such an important step as to write to a\nstranger without consulting her.\"\n\n\"Oh, papa! because mamma would never have allowed it.\"\n\n\"And do you think, my daughter, that that was proper? Though you have\nbeen educating your mind in this fatal way, how is it that your good\nsense and your intellect did not, in default of modesty, step in and\nshow you that by acting as you did you were throwing yourself at a man's\nhead. To think that my daughter, my only remaining child, should lack\npride and delicacy! Oh, Modeste, you made your father pass two hours in\nhell when he heard of it; for, after all, your conduct has been the\nsame as Bettina's without the excuse of a heart's seduction; you were\na coquette in cold blood, and that sort of coquetry is head-love, the\nworst vice of French women.\"\n\n\"I, without pride!\" said Modeste, weeping; \"but _he_ has not yet seen\nme.\"\n\n\"_He_ knows your name.\"\n\n\"I did not tell it to him till my eyes had vindicated the\ncorrespondence, lasting three months, during which our souls had spoken\nto each other.\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear misguided angel, you have mixed up a species of reason\nwith a folly that has compromised your own happiness and that of your\nfamily.\"\n\n\"But, after all, papa, happiness is the absolution of my temerity,\" she\nsaid, pouting.\n\n\"Oh! your conduct is temerity, is it?\"\n\n\"A temerity that my mother practised before me,\" she retorted quickly.\n\n\"Rebellious child! your mother after seeing me at a ball told her\nfather, who adored her, that she thought she could be happy with me. Be\nhonest, Modeste; is there any likeness between a love hastily conceived,\nI admit, but under the eyes of a father, and your mad action of writing\nto a stranger?\"\n\n\"A stranger, papa? say rather one of our greatest poets, whose character\nand whose life are exposed to the strongest light of day, to detraction,\nto calumny,--a man robed in fame, and to whom, my dear father, I was a\nmere literary and dramatic personage, one of Shakespeare's women, until\nthe moment when I wished to know if the man himself were as beautiful as\nhis soul.\"\n\n\"Good God! my poor child, you are turning marriage into poetry. But if,\nfrom time immemorial, girls have been cloistered in the bosom of their\nfamilies, if God, if social laws put them under the stern yoke of\nparental sanction, it is, mark my words, to spare them the misfortunes\nthat this very poetry which charms and dazzles you, and which you are\ntherefore unable to judge of, would entail upon them. Poetry is indeed\none of the pleasures of life, but it is not life itself.\"\n\n\"Papa, that is a suit still pending before the Court of Facts; the\nstruggle is forever going on between our hearts and the claims of\nfamily.\"\n\n\"Alas for the child that finds her happiness in resisting them,\" said\nthe colonel, gravely. \"In 1813 I saw one of my comrades, the Marquis\nd'Aiglemont, marry his cousin against the wishes of her father, and the\npair have since paid dear for the obstinacy which the young girl took\nfor love. The family must be sovereign in marriage.\"\n\n\"My poet has told me all that,\" she answered. \"He played Orgon for some\ntime; and he was brave enough to disparage the personal lives of poets.\"\n\n\"I have read your letters,\" said Charles Mignon, with the flicker of a\nmalicious smile on his lips that made Modeste very uneasy, \"and I ought\nto remark that your last epistle was scarcely permissible in any woman,\neven a Julie d'Etanges. Good God! what harm novels do!\"\n\n\"We should live them, my dear father, whether people wrote them or not;\nI think it is better to read them. There are not so many adventures in\nthese days as there were under Louis XIV. and Louis XV., and so they\npublish fewer novels. Besides, if you have read those letters, you must\nknow that I have chosen the most angelic soul, the most sternly upright\nman for your son-in-law, and you must have seen that we love one another\nat least as much as you and mamma love each other. Well, I admit that it\nwas not all exactly conventional; I did, if you _will_ have me say so,\nwrong--\"\n\n\"I have read your letters,\" said her father, interrupting her, \"and I\nknow exactly how far your lover justified you in your own eyes for a\nproceeding which might be permissible in some woman who understood life,\nand who was led away by strong passion, but which in a young girl of\ntwenty was a monstrous piece of wrong-doing.\"\n\n\"Yes, wrong-doing for commonplace people, for the narrow-minded\nGobenheims, who measure life with a square rule. Please let us keep to\nthe artistic and poetic life, papa. We young girls have only two ways to\nact; we must let a man know we love him by mincing and simpering, or we\nmust go to him frankly. Isn't the last way grand and noble? We French\ngirls are delivered over by our families like so much merchandise, at\nsixty days' sight, sometimes thirty, like Mademoiselle Vilquin; but in\nEngland, and Switzerland, and Germany, they follow very much the plan\nI have adopted. Now what have you got to say to that? Am I not half\nGerman?\"\n\n\"Child!\" cried the colonel, looking at her; \"the supremacy of France\ncomes from her sound common-sense, from the logic to which her noble\nlanguage constrains her mind. France is the reason of the whole world.\nEngland and Germany are romantic in their marriage customs,--though even\nthere noble families follow our customs. You certainly do not mean to\ndeny that your parents, who know life, who are responsible for your\nsoul and for your happiness, have no right to guard you from the\nstumbling-blocks that are in your way? Good heavens!\" he continued,\nspeaking half to himself, \"is it their fault, or is it ours? Ought we\nto hold our children under an iron yoke? Must we be punished for the\ntenderness that leads us to make them happy, and teaches our hearts how\nto do so?\"\n\nModeste watched her father out of the corner of her eye as she listened\nto this species of invocation, uttered in a broken voice.\n\n\"Was it wrong,\" she said, \"in a girl whose heart was free, to choose for\nher husband not only a charming companion, but a man of noble genius,\nborn to an honorable position, a gentleman; the equal of myself, a\ngentlewoman?\"\n\n\"You love him?\" asked her father.\n\n\"Father!\" she said, laying her head upon his breast, \"would you see me\ndie?\"\n\n\"Enough!\" said the old soldier. \"I see your love is inextinguishable.\"\n\n\"Yes, inextinguishable.\"\n\n\"Can nothing change it?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"No circumstances, no treachery, no betrayal? You mean that you will\nlove him in spite of everything, because of his personal attractions?\nEven though he proved a D'Estourny, would you love him still?\"\n\n\"Oh, my father! you do not know your daughter. Could I love a coward, a\nman without honor, without faith?\"\n\n\"But suppose he had deceived you?\"\n\n\"He? that honest, candid soul, half melancholy? You are joking, father,\nor else you have never met him.\"\n\n\"But you see now that your love is not inextinguishable, as you chose\nto call it. I have already made you admit that circumstances could alter\nyour poem; don't you now see that fathers are good for something?\"\n\n\"You want to give me a lecture, papa; it is positively l'Ami des Enfants\nover again.\"\n\n\"Poor deceived girl,\" said her father, sternly; \"it is no lecture of\nmine, I count for nothing in it; indeed, I am only trying to soften the\nblow.\"\n\n\"Father, don't play tricks with my life,\" exclaimed Modeste, turning\npale.\n\n\"Then, my daughter, summon all your courage. It is you who have been\nplaying tricks with your life, and life is now tricking you.\"\n\nModeste looked at her father in stupid amazement.\n\n\"Suppose that young man whom you love, whom you saw four days ago at\nchurch in Havre, was a deceiver?\"\n\n\"Never!\" she cried; \"that noble head, that pale face full of poetry--\"\n\n\"--was a lie,\" said the colonel interrupting her. \"He was no more\nMonsieur de Canalis than I am that sailor over there putting out to\nsea.\"\n\n\"Do you know what you are killing in me?\" she said in a low voice.\n\n\"Comfort yourself, my child; though accident has put the punishment of\nyour fault into the fault itself, the harm done is not irreparable.\nThe young man whom you have seen, and with whom you exchanged hearts\nby correspondence, is a loyal and honorable fellow; he came to me and\nconfided everything. He loves you, and I have no objection to him as a\nson-in-law.\"\n\n\"If he is not Canalis, who is he then?\" said Modeste in a changed voice.\n\n\"The secretary; his name is Ernest de La Briere. He is not a nobleman;\nbut he is one of those plain men with fixed principles and sound\nmorality who satisfy parents. However, that is not the point; you\nhave seen him and nothing can change your heart; you have chosen him,\ncomprehend his soul, it is as beautiful as he himself.\"\n\nThe count was interrupted by a heavy sigh from Modeste. The poor girl\nsat with her eyes fixed on the sea, pale and rigid as death, as if a\npistol shot had struck her in those fatal words, _a plain man, with\nfixed principles and sound morality_.\n\n\"Deceived!\" she said at last.\n\n\"Like your poor sister, but less fatally.\"\n\n\"Let us go home, father,\" she said, rising from the hillock on which\nthey were sitting. \"Papa, hear me, I swear before God to obey your\nwishes, whatever they may be, in the _affair_ of my marriage.\"\n\n\"Then you don't love him any longer?\" asked her father.\n\n\"I loved an honest man, with no falsehood on his face, upright as\nyourself, incapable of disguising himself like an actor, with the paint\nof another man's glory on his cheeks.\"\n\n\"You said nothing could change you\"; remarked the colonel, ironically.\n\n\"Ah, do not trifle with me!\" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and\nlooking at her father in distressful anxiety; \"don't you see that you\nare wringing my heart and destroying my beliefs with your jokes.\"\n\n\"God forbid! I have told you the exact truth.\"\n\n\"You are very kind, father,\" she said after a pause, and with a sort of\nsolemnity.\n\n\"He has kept your letters,\" resumed the colonel; \"now suppose the rash\ncaresses of your soul had fallen into the hands of one of those poets\nwho, as Dumay says, light their cigars with them?\"\n\n\"Oh!--you are going too far.\"\n\n\"Canalis told him so.\"\n\n\"Has Dumay seen Canalis?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered her father.\n\nThe two walked along in silence.\n\n\"So that is why that _gentleman_,\" resumed Modeste, \"told me so much\nharm of poets and poetry; no wonder the little secretary said--Why,\" she\nadded, interrupting herself, \"his virtues, his noble qualities, his fine\nsentiments are nothing but an epistolary theft! The man who steals glory\nand a name may very likely--\"\n\n\"--break locks, steal purses, and cut people's throats on the highway,\"\ncried the colonel. \"Ah, you young girls, that's just like you,--with\nyour peremptory opinions and your ignorance of life. A man who once\ndeceives a woman was born under the scaffold on which he ought to die.\"\n\nThis ridicule stopped Modeste's effervescence for a moment and least,\nand again there was silence.\n\n\"My child,\" said the colonel, presently, \"men in society, as in nature\neverywhere, are made to win the hearts of women, and women must\ndefend themselves. You have chosen to invert the parts. Was that wise?\nEverything is false in a false position. The first wrong-doing was\nyours. No, a man is not a monster because he seeks to please a woman; it\nis our right to win her by aggression with all its consequences, short\nof crime and cowardice. A man may have many virtues even if he does\ndeceive a woman; if he deceives her, it is because he finds her wanting\nin some of the treasures that he sought in her. None but a queen, an\nactress, or a woman placed so far above a man that she seems to him a\nqueen, can go to him of herself without incurring blame--and for a young\ngirl to do it! Why, she is false to all that God has given her that is\nsacred and lovely and noble,--no matter with what grace or what poetry\nor what precautions she surrounds her fault.\"\n\n\"To seek the master and find the servant!\" she said bitterly, \"oh! I can\nnever recover from it!\"\n\n\"Nonsense! Monsieur Ernest de La Briere is, to my thinking, fully the\nequal of the Baron de Canalis. He was private secretary of a cabinet\nminister, and he is now counsel for the Court of Claims; he has a heart,\nand he adores you, but--he _does not write verses_. No, I admit, he is\nnot a poet; but for all that he may have a heart full of poetry. At\nany rate, my dear girl,\" added her father, as Modeste made a gesture of\ndisgust, \"you are to see both of them, the sham and the true Canalis--\"\n\n\"Oh, papa!--\"\n\n\"Did you not swear just now to obey me in everything, even in the\n_affair_ of your marriage? Well, I allow you to choose which of the two\nyou like best for a husband. You have begun by a poem, you shall finish\nwith a bucolic, and try if you can discover the real character of these\ngentlemen here, in the country, on a few hunting or fishing excursions.\"\n\nModeste bowed her head and walked home with her father, listening to\nwhat he said but replying only in monosyllables.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. DISENCHANTED\n\nThe poor girl had fallen humiliated from the alp she had scaled in\nsearch of her eagle's nest, into the mud of the swamp below, where (to\nuse the poetic language of an author of our day) \"after feeling the\nsoles of her feet too tender to tread the broken glass of reality,\nImagination--which in that delicate bosom united the whole of womanhood,\nfrom the violet-hidden reveries of a chaste young girl to the passionate\ndesires of the sex--had led her into enchanted gardens where, oh, bitter\nsight! she now saw, springing from the ground, not the sublime flower\nof her fancy, but the hairy, twisted limbs of the black mandragora.\"\nModeste suddenly found herself brought down from the mystic heights of\nher love to a straight, flat road bordered with ditches,--in short the\nwork-day path of common life. What ardent, aspiring soul would not have\nbeen bruised and broken by such a fall? Whose feet were these at which\nshe had shed her thoughts? The Modeste who re-entered the Chalet was no\nmore the Modeste who had left it two hours earlier than an actress in\nthe street is like an actress on the boards. She fell into a state of\nnumb depression that was pitiful to see. The sun was darkened, nature\nveiled itself, even the flowers no longer spoke to her. Like all young\ngirls with a tendency to extremes, she drank too deeply of the cup of\ndisillusion. She fought against reality, and would not bend her neck\nto the yoke of family and conventions; it was, she felt, too heavy,\ntoo hard, too crushing. She would not listen to the consolations of her\nfather and mother, and tasted a sort of savage pleasure in letting her\nsoul suffer to the utmost.\n\n\"Poor Butscha was right,\" she said one evening.\n\nThe words indicate the distance she travelled in a short space of time\nand in gloomy sadness across the barren plain of reality. Sadness, when\ncaused by the overgrowth of hope, is a disease,--sometimes a fatal one.\nIt would be no mean object for physiology to search out in what ways\nand by what means Thought produces the same internal disorganization as\npoison; and how it is that despair affects the appetite, destroys the\npylorus, and changes all the physical conditions of the strongest life.\nSuch was the case with Modeste. In three short days she became the image\nof morbid melancholy; she did not sing, she could not be made to smile.\nCharles Mignon, becoming uneasy at the non-arrival of the two friends,\nthought of going to fetch them, when, on the evening of the fifth day,\nhe received news of their movements through Latournelle.\n\nCanalis, excessively delighted at the idea of a rich marriage, was\ndetermined to neglect nothing that might help him to cut out La Briere,\nwithout, however, giving La Briere a chance to reproach him for having\nviolated the laws of friendship. The poet felt that nothing would lower\na lover so much in the eyes of a young girl as to exhibit him in a\nsubordinate position; and he therefore proposed to La Briere, in the\nmost natural manner, to take a little country-house at Ingouville for a\nmonth, and live there together on pretence of requiring sea-air. As\nsoon as La Briere, who at first saw nothing amiss in the proposal, had\nconsented, Canalis declared that he should pay all expenses, and he sent\nhis valet to Havre, telling him to see Monsieur Latournelle and get\nhis assistance in choosing the house,--well aware that the notary would\nrepeat all particulars to the Mignons. Ernest and Canalis had, as may\nwell be supposed, talked over all the aspects of the affair, and the\nrather prolix Ernest had given a good many useful hints to his rival.\nThe valet, understanding his master's wishes, fulfilled them to the\nletter; he trumpeted the arrival of the great poet, for whom the doctors\nadvised sea-air to restore his health, injured as it was by the double\ntoils of literature and politics. This important personage wanted a\nhouse, which must have at least such and such a number of rooms, as he\nwould bring with him a secretary, cook, two servants, and a coachman,\nnot counting himself, Germain Bonnet, the valet. The carriage, selected\nand hired for a month by Canalis, was a pretty one; and Germain\nset about finding a pair of fine horses which would also answer as\nsaddle-horses,--for, as he said, monsieur le baron and his secretary\ntook horseback exercise. Under the eyes of little Latournelle, who went\nwith him to various houses, Germain made a good deal of talk about the\nsecretary, rejecting two or three because there was no suitable room for\nMonsieur de La Briere.\n\n\"Monsieur le baron,\" he said to the notary, \"makes his secretary quite\nhis best friend. Ah! I should be well scolded if Monsieur de La Briere\nwas not as well treated as monsieur le baron himself; and after all, you\nknow, Monsieur de La Briere is a lawyer in my master's court.\"\n\nGermain never appeared in public unless punctiliously dressed in\nblack, with spotless gloves, well-polished boots, and otherwise as well\napparelled as a lawyer. Imagine the effect he produced in Havre, and the\nidea people took of the great poet from this sample of him! The valet\nof a man of wit and intellect ends by getting a little wit and intellect\nhimself which has rubbed off from his master. Germain did not overplay\nhis part; he was simple and good-humored, as Canalis had instructed him\nto be. Poor La Briere was in blissful ignorance of the harm Germain\nwas doing to his prospects, and the depreciation his consent to the\narrangement had brought upon him; it is, however, true that some inkling\nof the state of things rose to Modeste's ears from these lower regions.\n\nCanalis had arranged to bring his secretary in his own carriage, and\nErnest's unsuspicious nature did not perceive that he was putting\nhimself in a false position until too late to remedy it. The delay in\nthe arrival of the pair which had troubled Charles Mignon was caused by\nthe painting of the Canalis arms on the panels of the carriage, and by\ncertain orders given to a tailor; for the poet neglected none of the\ninnumerable details which might, even the smallest of them, influence a\nyoung girl.\n\n\"It is all right,\" said Latournelle to Mignon on the sixth day. \"The\nbaron's valet has hired Madame Amaury's villa at Sanvic, all furnished,\nfor seven hundred francs; he has written to his master that he may\nstart, and that all will be ready on his arrival. So the two gentlemen\nwill be here Sunday. I have also had a letter from Butscha; here it is;\nit's not long: 'My dear master,--I cannot get back till Sunday. Between\nnow and then I have some very important inquiries to make which concern\nthe happiness of a person in whom you take an interest.'\"\n\nThe announcement of this arrival did not rouse Modeste from her gloom;\nthe sense of her fall and the bewilderment of her mind were still\ntoo great, and she was not nearly as much of a coquette as her father\nthought her to be. There is, in truth, a charming and permissible\ncoquetry, that of the soul, which may claim to be love's politeness.\nCharles Mignon, when scolding his daughter, failed to distinguish\nbetween the mere desire of pleasing and the love of the mind,--the\nthirst for love, and the thirst for admiration. Like every true colonel\nof the Empire he saw in this correspondence, rapidly read, only the\nyoung girl who had thrown herself at the head of a poet; but in the\nletters which we were forced to lack of space to suppress, a better\njudge would have admired the dignified and gracious reserve which\nModeste had substituted for the rather aggressive and light-minded tone\nof her first letters. The father, however, was only too cruelly right on\none point. Modeste's last letter, which we have read, had indeed spoken\nas though the marriage were a settled fact, and the remembrance of that\nletter filled her with shame; she thought her father very harsh and\ncruel to force her to receive a man unworthy of her, yet to whom\nher soul had flown, as it were, bare. She questioned Dumay about his\ninterview with the poet, she inveigled him into relating its every\ndetail, and she did not think Canalis as barbarous as the lieutenant had\ndeclared him. The thought of the beautiful casket which held the letters\nof the thousand and one women of this literary Don Juan made her smile,\nand she was strongly tempted to say to her father: \"I am not the only\none to write to him; the elite of my sex send their leaves for the\nlaurel wreath of the poet.\"\n\nDuring this week Modeste's character underwent a transformation. The\ncatastrophe--and it was a great one to her poetic nature--roused a\nfaculty of discernment and also the malice latent in her girlish heart,\nin which her suitors were about to encounter a formidable adversary. It\nis a fact that when a young woman's heart is chilled her head becomes\nclear; she observes with great rapidity of judgment, and with a tinge of\npleasantry which Shakespeare's Beatrice so admirably represents in \"Much\nAdo about Nothing.\" Modeste was seized with a deep disgust for men, now\nthat the most distinguished among them had betrayed her hopes. When a\nwoman loves, what she takes for disgust is simply the ability to see\nclearly; but in matters of sentiment she is never, especially if she is\na young girl, in a condition to see clearly. If she cannot admire, she\ndespises. And so, after passing through terrible struggles of the soul,\nModeste necessarily put on the armor on which, as she had once declared,\nthe word \"Disdain\" was engraved. After reaching that point she was able,\nin the character of uninterested spectator, to take part in what she was\npleased to call the \"farce of the suitors,\" a performance in which she\nherself was about to play the role of heroine. She particularly set\nbefore her mind the satisfaction of humiliating Monsieur de La Briere.\n\n\"Modeste is saved,\" said Madame Mignon to her husband; \"she wants to\nrevenge herself on the false Canalis by trying to love the real one.\"\n\nSuch in truth was Modeste's plan. It was so utterly commonplace that her\nmother, to whom she confided her griefs, advised her on the contrary to\ntreat Monsieur de La Briere with extreme politeness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. A THIRD SUITOR\n\n\"Those two young men,\" said Madame Latournelle, on the Saturday evening,\n\"have no idea how many spies they have on their tracks. We are eight in\nall, on the watch.\"\n\n\"Don't say two young men, wife; say three!\" cried little Latournelle,\nlooking round him. \"Gobenheim is not here, so I can speak out.\"\n\nModeste raised her head, and everybody, imitating Modeste, raised theirs\nand looked at the notary.\n\n\"Yes, a third lover--and he is something like a lover--offers himself as\na candidate.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" exclaimed the colonel.\n\n\"I speak of no less a person,\" said Latournelle, pompously, \"than\nMonsieur le Duc d'Herouville, Marquis de Saint-Sever, Duc de Nivron,\nComte de Bayeux, Vicomte d'Essigny, grand equerry and peer of France,\nknight of the Spur and the Golden Fleece, grandee of Spain, and son of\nthe last governor of Normandy. He saw Mademoiselle Modeste at the time\nwhen he was staying with the Vilquins, and he regretted then--as his\nnotary, who came from Bayeux yesterday, tells me--that she was not\nrich enough for him; for his father recovered nothing but the estate of\nHerouville on his return to France, and that is saddled with a sister.\nThe young duke is thirty-three years old. I am definitively charged to\nlay these proposals before you, Monsieur le comte,\" added the notary,\nturning respectfully to the colonel.\n\n\"Ask Modeste if she wants another bird in her cage,\" replied the count;\n\"as far as I am concerned, I am willing that my lord the grand equerry\nshall pay her attention.\"\n\nNotwithstanding the care with which Charles Mignon avoided seeing\npeople, and though he stayed in the Chalet and never went out without\nModeste, Gobenheim had reported Dumay's wealth; for Dumay had said to\nhim when giving up his position as cashier: \"I am to be bailiff for my\ncolonel, and all my fortune, except what my wife needs, is to go to\nthe children of our little Modeste.\" Every one in Havre had therefore\npropounded the same question that the notary had already put to himself:\n\"If Dumay's share in the profits is six hundred thousand francs, and\nhe is going to be Monsieur Mignon's bailiff, then Monsieur Mignon must\ncertainly have a colossal fortune. He arrived at Marseilles on a ship of\nhis own, loaded with indigo; and they say at the Bourse that the cargo,\nnot counting the ship, is worth more than he gives out as his whole\nfortune.\"\n\nThe colonel was unwilling to dismiss the servants he had brought back\nwith him, whom he had chosen with care during his travels; and he\ntherefore hired a house for them in the lower part of Ingouville, where\nhe installed his valet, cook, and coachman, all Negroes, and three\nmulattos on whose fidelity he could rely. The coachman was told to\nsearch for saddle-horses for Mademoiselle and for his master, and for\ncarriage-horses for the caleche in which the colonel and the lieutenant\nhad returned to Havre. That carriage, bought in Paris, was of the\nlatest fashion, and bore the arms of La Bastie, surmounted by a count's\ncoronet. These things, insignificant in the eyes of a man who for four\nyears had been accustomed to the unbridled luxury of the Indies and of\nthe English merchants at Canton, were the subject of much comment\namong the business men of Havre and the inhabitants of Ingouville and\nGraville. Before five days had elapsed the rumor of them ran from one\nend of Normandy to the other like a train of gunpowder touched by fire.\n\n\"Monsieur Mignon has come back from China with millions,\" some one said\nin Rouen; \"and it seems he was made a count in mid-ocean.\"\n\n\"But he was the Comte de La Bastie before the Revolution,\" answered\nanother.\n\n\"So they call him a liberal just because he was plain Charles Mignon for\ntwenty-five years! What are we coming to?\" said a third.\n\nModeste was considered, therefore, notwithstanding the silence of her\nparents and friends, as the richest heiress in Normandy, and all eyes\nbegan once more to see her merits. The aunt and sister of the Duc\nd'Herouville confirmed in the aristocratic salons of Bayeux Monsieur\nCharles Mignon's right to the title and arms of count, derived from\nCardinal Mignon, for whom the Cardinal's hat and tassels were added as a\ncrest. They had seen Mademoiselle de La Bastie when they were staying\nat the Vilquins, and their solicitude for the impoverished head of their\nhouse now became active.\n\n\"If Mademoiselle de La Bastie is really as rich as she is beautiful,\"\nsaid the aunt of the young duke, \"she is the best match in the province.\n_She_ at least is noble.\"\n\nThe last words were aimed at the Vilquins, with whom they had not been\nable to come to terms, after incurring the humiliation of staying in\nthat bourgeois household.\n\nSuch were the little events which, contrary to the rules of Aristotle\nand of Horace, precede the introduction of another person into our\nstory; but the portrait and the biography of this personage, this\nlate arrival, shall not be long, taking into consideration his own\ndiminutiveness. The grand equerry shall not take more space here than\nhe will take in history. Monsieur le Duc d'Herouville, offspring of the\nmatrimonial autumn of the last governor of Normandy, was born during the\nemigration in 1799, at Vienna. The old marechal, father of the present\nduke, returned with the king in 1814, and died in 1819, before he was\nable to marry his son. He could only leave him the vast chateau of\nHerouville, the park, a few dependencies, and a farm which he had bought\nback with some difficulty; all of which returned a rental of about\nfifteen thousand francs a year. Louis XVIII. gave the post of grand\nequerry to the son, who, under Charles X., received the usual pension of\ntwelve thousand francs which was granted to the pauper peers of France.\nBut what were these twenty-seven thousand francs a year and the salary\nof grand equerry to such a family? In Paris, of course, the young duke\nused the king's coaches, and had a mansion provided for him in the rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre, near the royal stables; his salary paid for\nhis winters in the city, and his twenty-seven thousand francs for the\nsummers in Normandy. If this noble personage was still a bachelor he was\nless to blame than his aunt, who was not versed in La Fontaine's fables.\nMademoiselle d'Herouville made enormous pretensions wholly out of\nkeeping with the spirit of the times; for great names, without the money\nto keep them up, can seldom win rich heiresses among the higher French\nnobility, who are themselves embarrassed to provide for their sons under\nthe new law of the equal division of property. To marry the young Duc\nd'Herouville, it was necessary to conciliate the great banking-houses;\nbut the haughty pride of the daughter of the house alienated these\npeople by cutting speeches. During the first years of the Restoration,\nfrom 1817 to 1825, Mademoiselle d'Herouville, though in quest of\nmillions, refused, among others, the daughter of Mongenod the banker,\nwith whom Monsieur de Fontaine afterwards contented himself.\n\nAt last, having lost several good opportunities to establish her nephew,\nentirely through her own fault, she was just considering whether the\nproperty of the Nucingens was not too basely acquired, or whether she\nshould lend herself to the ambition of Madame de Nucingen, who wished\nto make her daughter a duchess. The king, anxious to restore the\nd'Herouvilles to their former splendor, had almost brought about this\nmarriage, and when it failed he openly accused Mademoiselle d'Herouville\nof folly. In this way the aunt made the nephew ridiculous, and the\nnephew, in his own way, was not less absurd. When great things disappear\nthey leave crumbs, \"frusteaux,\" Rabelais would say, behind them; and\nthe French nobility of this century has left us too many such fragments.\nNeither the clergy nor the nobility have anything to complain of in this\nlong history of manners and customs. Those great and magnificent social\nnecessities have been well represented; but we ought surely to renounce\nthe noble title of historian if we are not impartial, if we do not here\ndepict the present degeneracy of the race of nobles, although we have\nalready done so elsewhere,--in the character of the Comte de Mortsauf\n(in \"The Lily of the Valley\"), in the \"Duchesse de Langeais,\" and the\nvery nobleness of the nobility in the \"Marquis d'Espard.\" How then could\nit be that the race of heroes and valiant men belonging to the proud\nhouse of Herouville, who gave the famous marshal to the nation,\ncardinals to the church, great leaders to the Valois, knights to Louis\nXIV., was reduced to a little fragile being smaller than Butscha? That\nis a question which we ask ourselves in more than one salon in Paris\nwhen we hear the greatest names of France announced, and see the\nentrance of a thin, pinched, undersized young man, scarcely possessing\nthe breath of life, or a premature old one, or some whimsical creature\nin whom an observer can with great difficulty trace the signs of a past\ngrandeur. The dissipations of the reign of Louis XV., the orgies of that\nfatal and egotistic period, have produced an effete generation, in which\nmanners alone survive the nobler vanished qualities,--forms, which are\nthe sole heritage our nobles have preserved. The abandonment in which\nLouis XVI. was allowed to perish may thus be explained, with some slight\nreservations, as a wretched result of the reign of Madame de Pompadour.\n\nThe grand equerry, a fair young man with blue eyes and a pallid face,\nwas not without a certain dignity of thought; but his thin, undersized\nfigure, and the follies of his aunt who had taken him to the Vilquins\nand elsewhere to pay his court, rendered him extremely diffident. The\nhouse of Herouville had already been threatened with extinction by the\ndeed of a deformed being (see the \"Enfant Maudit\" in \"Philosophical\nStudies\"). The grand marshal, that being the family term for the member\nwho was made duke by Louis XIII., married at the age of eighty. The\nyoung duke admired women, but he placed them too high and respected them\ntoo much; in fact, he adored them, and was only at his ease with those\nwhom he could not respect. This characteristic caused him to lead a\ndouble life. He found compensation with women of easy virtue for the\nworship to which he surrendered himself in the salons, or, if you like,\nthe boudoirs, of the faubourg Saint-Germain. Such habits and his puny\nfigure, his suffering face with its blue eyes turning upward in ecstasy,\nincreased the ridicule already bestowed upon him,--very unjustly\nbestowed, as it happened, for he was full of wit and delicacy; but his\nwit, which never sparkled, only showed itself when he felt at ease.\nFanny Beaupre, an actress who was supposed to be his nearest friend (at\na price), called him \"a sound wine so carefully corked that you break\nall your corkscrews.\" The beautiful Duchesse de Maufrigneuse, whom the\ngrand equerry could only worship, annihilated him with a speech which,\nunfortunately, was repeated from mouth to mouth, like all such pretty\nand malicious sayings.\n\n\"He always seems to me,\" she said, \"like one of those jewels of fine\nworkmanship which we exhibit but never wear, and keep in cotton-wool.\"\n\nEverything about him, even to his absurdly contrasting title of\ngrand equerry, amused the good-natured king, Charles X., and made him\nlaugh,--although the Duc d'Herouville justified his appointment in the\nmatter of being a fine horseman. Men are like books, often understood\nand appreciated too late. Modeste had seen the duke during his fruitless\nvisit to the Vilquins, and many of these reflections passed through\nher mind as she watched him come and go. But under the circumstances in\nwhich she now found herself, she saw plainly that the courtship of\nthe Duc d'Herouville would save her from being at the mercy of either\nCanalis.\n\n\"I see no reason,\" she said to Latournelle, \"why the Duc d'Herouville\nshould not be received. I have passed, in spite of our indigence,\" she\ncontinued, with a mischievous look at her father, \"to the condition\nof heiress. Haven't you observed Gobenheim's glances? They have quite\nchanged their character within a week. He is in despair at not being\nable to make his games of whist count for mute adoration of my charms.\"\n\n\"Hush, my darling!\" cried Madame Latournelle, \"here he comes.\"\n\n\"Old Althor is in despair,\" said Gobenheim to Monsieur Mignon as he\nentered.\n\n\"Why?\" asked the count.\n\n\"Vilquin is going to fail; and the Bourse thinks you are worth several\nmillions. What ill-luck for his son!\"\n\n\"No one knows,\" said Charles Mignon, coldly, \"what my liabilities in\nIndia are; and I do not intend to take the public into my confidence as\nto my private affairs. Dumay,\" he whispered to his friend, \"if Vilquin\nis embarrassed we could get back the villa by paying him what he gave\nfor it.\"\n\nSuch was the general state of things, due chiefly to accident, when on\nSunday morning Canalis and La Briere arrived, with a courier in advance,\nat the villa of Madame Amaury. It was known that the Duc d'Herouville,\nhis sister, and his aunt were coming the following Tuesday to occupy,\nalso under pretext of ill-health, a hired house at Graville. This\nassemblage of suitors made the wits of the Bourse remark that, thanks to\nMademoiselle Mignon, rents would rise at Ingouville. \"If this goes on,\nshe will have a hospital here,\" said the younger Mademoiselle Vilquin,\nvexed at not becoming a duchess.\n\nThe everlasting comedy of \"The Heiress,\" about to be played at the\nChalet, might very well be called, in view of Modeste's frame of mind,\n\"The Designs of a Young Girl\"; for since the overthrow of her illusions\nshe had fully made up her mind to give her hand to no man whose\nqualifications did not fully satisfy her.\n\nThe two rivals, still intimate friends, intended to pay their first\nvisit at the Chalet on the evening of the day succeeding their arrival.\nThey had spent Sunday and part of Monday in unpacking and arranging\nMadame Amaury's house for a month's stay. The poet, always calculating\neffects, wished to make the most of the probable excitement which his\narrival would case in Havre, and which would of course echo up to the\nMignons. Therefore, in his role of a man needing rest, he did not leave\nthe house. La Briere went twice to walk past the Chalet, though always\nwith a sense of despair, for he feared to displease Modeste, and the\nfuture seemed to him dark with clouds. The two friends came down to\ndinner on Monday dressed for the momentous visit. La Briere wore the\nsame clothes he had so carefully selected for the famous Sunday; but\nhe now felt like the satellite of a planet, and resigned himself to\nthe uncertainties of his situation. Canalis, on the other hand, had\ncarefully attended to his black coat, his orders, and all those little\ndrawing-room elegancies, which his intimacy with the Duchesse de\nChaulieu and the fashionable world of the faubourg had brought to\nperfection. He had gone into the minutiae of dandyism, while poor La\nBriere was about to present himself with the negligence of a man without\nhope. Germain, as he waited at dinner could not help smiling to himself\nat the contrast. After the second course, however, the valet came in\nwith a diplomatic, that is to say, uneasy air.\n\n\"Does Monsieur le baron know,\" he said to Canalis in a low voice, \"that\nMonsieur the grand equerry is coming to Graville to get cured of the\nsame illness which has brought Monsieur de La Briere and Monsieur le\nbaron to the sea-shore?\"\n\n\"What, the little Duc d'Herouville?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Is he coming for Mademoiselle de La Bastie?\" asked La Briere, coloring.\n\n\"So it appears, monsieur.\"\n\n\"We are cheated!\" cried Canalis looking at La Briere.\n\n\"Ah!\" retorted Ernest quickly, \"that is the first time you have said,\n'we' since we left Paris: it has been 'I' all along.\"\n\n\"You understood me,\" cried Canalis, with a burst of laughter. \"But\nwe are not in a position to struggle against a ducal coronet, nor the\nduke's title, nor against the waste lands which the Council of State\nhave just granted, on my report, to the house of Herouville.\"\n\n\"His grace,\" said La Briere, with a spice of malice that was\nnevertheless serious, \"will furnish you with compensation in the person\nof his sister.\"\n\nAt this instant, the Comte de La Bastie was announced; the two young men\nrose at once, and La Briere hastened forward to present Canalis.\n\n\"I wished to return the visit that you paid me in Paris,\" said the count\nto the young lawyer, \"and I knew that by coming here I should have the\ndouble pleasure of greeting one of our great living poets.\"\n\n\"Great!--Monsieur,\" replied the poet, smiling, \"no one can be great in a\ncentury prefaced by the reign of a Napoleon. We are a tribe of would-be\ngreat poets; besides, second-rate talent imitates genius nowadays, and\nrenders real distinction impossible.\"\n\n\"Is that the reason why you have thrown yourself into politics?\" asked\nthe count.\n\n\"It is the same thing in that sphere,\" said the poet; \"there are no\nstatesmen in these days, only men who handle events more or less. Look\nat it, monsieur; under the system of government that we derive from the\nCharter, which makes a tax-list of more importance than a coat-of-arms,\nthere is absolutely nothing solid except that which you went to seek in\nChina,--wealth.\"\n\nSatisfied with himself and with the impression he was making on the\nprospective father-in-law, Canalis turned to Germain.\n\n\"Serve the coffee in the salon,\" he said, inviting Monsieur de La Bastie\nto leave the dining-room.\n\n\"I thank you for this visit, monsieur le comte,\" said La Briere; \"it\nsaves me from the embarrassment of presenting my friend to you in your\nown house. You have a heart, and you have also a quick mind.\"\n\n\"Bah! the ready wit of Provence, that is all,\" said Charles Mignon.\n\n\"Ah, do you come from Provence?\" cried Canalis.\n\n\"You must pardon my friend,\" said La Briere; \"he has not studied, as I\nhave, the history of La Bastie.\"\n\nAt the word _friend_ Canalis threw a searching glance at Ernest.\n\n\"If your health will allow,\" said the count to the poet, \"I shall hope\nto receive you this evening under my roof; it will be a day to mark,\nas the old writer said 'albo notanda lapillo.' Though we cannot duly\nreceive so great a fame in our little house, yet your visit will gratify\nmy daughter, whose admiration for your poems has even led her to set\nthem to music.\"\n\n\"You have something better than fame in your house,\" said Canalis; \"you\nhave beauty, if I am to believe Ernest.\"\n\n\"Yes, a good daughter; but you will find her rather countrified,\" said\nCharles Mignon.\n\n\"A country girl sought by the Duc d'Herouville,\" remarked Canalis,\ndryly.\n\n\"Oh!\" replied Monsieur Mignon, with the perfidious good-humor of a\nSoutherner, \"I leave my daughter free. Dukes, princes, commoners,--they\nare all the same to me, even men of genius. I shall make no pledges, and\nwhoever my Modeste chooses will be my son-in-law, or rather my son,\" he\nadded, looking at La Briere. \"It could not be otherwise. Madame de La\nBastie is German. She has never adopted our etiquette, and I let my\ntwo women lead me their own way. I have always preferred to sit in\nthe carriage rather than on the box. I can make a joke of all this at\npresent, for we have not yet seen the Duc d'Herouville, and I do not\nbelieve in marriages arranged by proxy, any more than I believe in\nchoosing my daughter's husband.\"\n\n\"That declaration is equally encouraging and discouraging to two young\nmen who are searching for the philosopher's stone of happiness in\nmarriage,\" said Canalis.\n\n\"Don't you consider it useful, necessary, and even politic to stipulate\nfor perfect freedom of action for parents, daughters, and suitors?\"\nasked Charles Mignon.\n\nCanalis, at a sign from La Briere, kept silence. The conversation\npresently became unimportant, and after a few turns round the garden the\ncount retired, urging the visit of the two friends.\n\n\"That's our dismissal,\" cried Canalis; \"you saw it as plainly as I did.\nWell, in his place, I should not hesitate between the grand equerry and\neither of us, charming as we are.\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" said La Briere. \"I believe that frank soldier came\nhere to satisfy his desire to see you, and to warn us of his neutrality\nwhile receiving us in his house. Modeste, in love with your fame, and\nmisled by my person, stands, as it were, between the real and the ideal,\nbetween poetry and prose. I am, unfortunately, the prose.\"\n\n\"Germain,\" said Canalis to the valet, who came to take away the coffee,\n\"order the carriage in half an hour. We will take a drive before we go\nto the Chalet.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. A SPLENDID FIRST APPEARANCE\n\nThe two young men were equally impatient to see Modeste, but La Briere\ndreaded the interview, while Canalis approached it with the confidence\nof self-conceit. The eagerness with which La Briere had met the\nfather, and the flattery of his attention to the family pride of the\nex-merchant, showed Canalis his own maladroitness, and determined him to\nselect a special role. The great poet resolved to pretend indifference,\nthough all the while displaying his seductive powers; to appear to\ndisdain the young lady, and thus pique her self-love. Trained by\nthe handsome Duchesse de Chaulieu, he was bound to be worthy of his\nreputation as a man who knew women, when, in fact, he did not know them\nat all,--which is often the case with those who are the happy victims\nof an exclusive passion. While poor Ernest, gloomily ensconced in his\ncorner of the caleche, gave way to the terrors of genuine love, and\nforesaw instinctively the anger, contempt, and disdain of an injured and\noffended young girl, Canalis was preparing himself, not less silently,\nlike an actor making ready for an important part in a new play;\ncertainly neither of them presented the appearance of a happy man.\nImportant interests were involved for Canalis. The mere suggestion of\nhis desire to marry would bring about a rupture of the tie which had\nbound him for the last ten years to the Duchesse de Chaulieu. Though\nhe had covered the purpose of his journey with the vulgar pretext of\nneeding rest,--in which, by the bye, women never believe, even when\nit is true,--his conscience troubled him somewhat; but the word\n\"conscience\" seemed so Jesuitical to La Briere that he shrugged his\nshoulders when the poet mentioned his scruples.\n\n\"Your conscience, my friend, strikes me as nothing more nor less than a\ndread of losing the pleasures of vanity, and some very real advantages\nand habits by sacrificing the affections of Madame de Chaulieu; for, if\nyou were sure of succeeding with Modeste, you would renounce without the\nslightest compunction the wilted aftermath of a passion that has been\nmown and well-raked for the last eight years. If you simply mean that\nyou are afraid of displeasing your protectress, should she find out the\nobject of your stay here, I believe you. To renounce the duchess and yet\nnot succeed at the Chalet is too heavy a risk. You take the anxiety of\nthis alternative for remorse.\"\n\n\"You have no comprehension of feelings,\" said the poet, irritably, like\na man who hears truth when he expects a compliment.\n\n\"That is what a bigamist should tell the jury,\" retorted La Briere,\nlaughing.\n\nThis epigram made another disagreeable impression on Canalis. He began\nto think La Briere too witty and too free for a secretary.\n\nThe arrival of an elegant caleche, driven by a coachman in the Canalis\nlivery, made the more excitement at the Chalet because the two suitors\nwere expected, and all the personages of this history were assembled to\nreceive them, except the duke and Butscha.\n\n\"Which is the poet?\" asked Madame Latournelle of Dumay in the embrasure\nof a window, where she stationed herself as soon as she heard the\nwheels.\n\n\"The one who walks like a drum-major,\" answered the lieutenant.\n\n\"Ah!\" said the notary's wife, examining Canalis, who was swinging his\nbody like a man who knows he is being looked at. The fault lay with the\ngreat lady who flattered him incessantly and spoiled him,--as all women\nolder than their adorers invariably spoil and flatter them; Canalis in\nhis moral being was a sort of Narcissus. When a woman of a certain age\nwishes to attach a man forever, she begins by deifying his defects, so\nas to cut off all possibility of rivalry; for a rival is never, at the\nfirst approach, aware of the super-fine flattery to which the man is\naccustomed. Coxcombs are the product of this feminine manoeuvre, when\nthey are not fops by nature. Canalis, taken young by the handsome\nduchess, vindicated his affectations to his own mind by telling himself\nthat they pleased that \"grande dame,\" whose taste was law. Such shades\nof character may be excessively faint, but it is improper for the\nhistorian not to point them out. For instance, Melchior possessed a\ntalent for reading which was greatly admired, and much injudicious\npraise had given him a habit of exaggeration, which neither poets nor\nactors are willing to check, and which made people say of him (always\nthrough De Marsay) that he no longer declaimed, he bellowed his verses;\nlengthening the sounds that he might listen to himself. In the slang of\nthe green-room, Canalis \"dragged the time.\" He was fond of exchanging\nglances with his hearers, throwing himself into postures of\nself-complacency and practising those tricks of demeanor which actors\ncall \"balancoires,\"--the picturesque phrase of an artistic people.\nCanalis had his imitators, and was in fact the head of a school of\nhis kind. This habit of declamatory chanting slightly affected his\nconversation, as we have seen in his interview with Dumay. The moment\nthe mind becomes finical the manners follow suit, and the great poet\nended by studying his demeanor, inventing attitudes, looking furtively\nat himself in mirrors, and suiting his discourse to the particular\npose which he happened to have taken up. He was so preoccupied with the\neffect he wished to produce, that a practical joke, Blondet, had bet\nonce or twice, and won the wager, that he could nonplus him at any\nmoment by merely looking fixedly at his hair, or his boots, or the tails\nof his coats.\n\nThese airs and graces, which started in life with a passport of flowery\nyouth, now seemed all the more stale and old because Melchior himself\nwas waning. Life in the world of fashion is quite as exhausting to men\nas it is to women, and perhaps the twenty years by which the duchess\nexceeded her lover's age, weighed more heavily upon him than upon her;\nfor to the eyes of the world she was always handsome,--without rouge,\nwithout wrinkles, and without heart. Alas! neither men nor women have\nfriends who are friendly enough to warn them of the moment when the\nfragrance of their modesty grows stale, when the caressing glance is\nbut an echo of the stage, when the expression of the face changes from\nsentiment to sentimentality, and the artifices of the mind show their\nrusty edges. Genius alone renews its skin like a snake; and in the\nmatter of charm, as in everything else, it is only the heart that never\ngrows old. People who have hearts are simple in all their ways. Now\nCanalis, as we know, had a shrivelled heart. He misused the beauty of\nhis glance by giving it, without adequate reason, the fixity that comes\nto the eyes in meditation. In short, applause was to him a business, in\nwhich he was perpetually on the lookout for gain. His style of paying\ncompliments, charming to superficial people, seemed insulting to\nothers of more delicacy, by its triteness and the cool assurance of\nits cut-and-dried flattery. As a matter of fact, Melchior lied like a\ncourtier. He remarked without blushing to the Duc de Chaulieu, who made\nno impression whatever when he was obliged to address the Chamber as\nminister of foreign affairs, \"Your excellency was truly sublime!\" Many\nmen like Canalis are purged of their affectations by the administration\nof non-success in little doses.\n\nThese defects, slight in the gilded salons of the faubourg\nSaint-Germain, where every one contributes his or her quota of\nabsurdity, and where these particular forms of exaggerated speech\nand affected diction--magniloquence, if you please to call it so--are\nsurrounded by excessive luxury and sumptuous toilettes, which are to\nsome extent their excuse, were certain to be far more noticed in the\nprovinces, whose own absurdities are of a totally different type.\nCanalis, by nature over-strained and artificial, could not change his\nform; in fact, he had had time to grow stiff in the mould into which the\nduchess had poured him; moreover, he was thoroughly Parisian, or, if\nyou prefer it, truly French. The Parisian is amazed that everything\neverywhere is not as it in Paris; the Frenchman, as it is in France.\nGood taste, on the contrary, demands that we adapt ourselves to the\ncustoms of foreigners without losing too much of our own character,--as\ndid Alcibiades, that model of a gentleman. True grace is elastic; it\nlends itself to circumstances; it is in harmony with all social centres;\nit wears a robe of simple material in the streets, noticeable only by\nits cut, in preference to the feathers and flounces of middle-class\nvulgarity. Now Canalis, instigated by a woman who loved herself much\nmore than she loved him, wished to lay down the law and be, everywhere,\nsuch as he himself might see fit to be. He believed he carried his own\npublic with him wherever he went,--an error shared by several of the\ngreat men of Paris.\n\nWhile the poet made a studied and effective entrance into the salon of\nthe Chalet, La Briere slipped in behind him like a person of no account.\n\n\"Ha! do I see my soldier?\" said Canalis, perceiving Dumay, after\naddressing a compliment to Madame Mignon, and bowing to the other women.\n\"Your anxieties are relieved, are they not?\" he said, offering his hand\neffusively; \"I comprehend them to their fullest extent after seeing\nmademoiselle. I spoke to you of terrestrial creatures, not of angels.\"\n\nAll present seemed by their attitudes to ask the meaning of this speech.\n\n\"I shall always consider it a triumph,\" resumed the poet, observing that\neverybody wished for an explanation, \"to have stirred to mention one\nof those men of iron whom Napoleon had the eye to find and make the\nsupporting piles on which he tried to build an empire, too colossal\nto be lasting: for such structures time alone is the cement. But this\ntriumph--why should I be proud of it?--I count for nothing. It was the\ntriumph of ideas over facts. Your battles, my dear Monsieur Dumay, your\nheroic charges, Monsieur le comte, nay, war itself was the form in which\nNapoleon's idea clothed itself. Of all of these things, what remains?\nThe sod that covers them knows nothing; harvests come and go without\nrevealing their resting-place; were it not for the historian, the\nwriter, futurity would have no knowledge of those heroic days. Therefore\nyour fifteen years of war are now ideas and nothing more; that which\npreserves the Empire forever is the poem that the poets make of them. A\nnation that can win such battles must know how to sing them.\"\n\nCanalis paused, to gather by a glance that ran round the circle the\ntribute of amazement which he expected of provincials.\n\n\"You must be aware, monsieur, of the regret I feel at not seeing you,\"\nsaid Madame Mignon, \"since you compensate me with the pleasure of\nhearing you.\"\n\nModeste, determined to think Canalis sublime, sat motionless with\namazement; the embroidery slipped from her fingers, which held it only\nby the needleful of thread.\n\n\"Modeste, this is Monsieur Ernest de La Briere. Monsieur Ernest, my\ndaughter,\" said the count, thinking the secretary too much in the\nbackground.\n\nThe young girl bowed coldly, giving Ernest a glance that was meant to\nprove to every one present that she saw him for the first time.\n\n\"Pardon me, monsieur,\" she said without blushing; \"the great admiration\nI feel for the greatest of our poets is, in the eyes of my friends, a\nsufficient excuse for seeing only him.\"\n\nThe pure, fresh voice, with accents like that of Mademoiselle Mars,\ncharmed the poor secretary, already dazzled by Modeste's beauty, and\nin his sudden surprise he answered by a phrase that would have been\nsublime, had it been true.\n\n\"He is my friend,\" he said.\n\n\"Ah, then you do pardon me,\" she replied.\n\n\"He is more than a friend,\" cried Canalis taking Ernest by the shoulder\nand leaning upon it like Alexander on Hephaestion, \"we love each other\nas though we were brothers--\"\n\nMadame Latournelle cut short the poet's speech by pointing to Ernest\nand saying aloud to her husband, \"Surely that is the gentleman we saw at\nchurch.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said Charles Mignon, quickly, observing that Ernest reddened.\n\nModeste coldly took up her embroidery.\n\n\"Madame may be right; I have been twice in Havre lately,\" replied La\nBriere, sitting down by Dumay.\n\nCanalis, charmed with Modeste's beauty, mistook the admiration she\nexpressed, and flattered himself he had succeeded in producing his\ndesired effects.\n\n\"I should think a man without heart, if he had no devoted friend near\nhim,\" said Modeste, to pick up the conversation interrupted by Madame\nLatournelle's awkwardness.\n\n\"Mademoiselle, Ernest's devotion makes me almost think myself worth\nsomething,\" said Canalis; \"for my dear Pylades is full of talent; he\nwas the right hand of the greatest minister we have had since the peace.\nThough he holds a fine position, he is good enough to be my tutor in the\nscience of politics; he teaches me to conduct affairs and feeds me with\nhis experience, when all the while he might aspire to a much better\nsituation. Oh! he is worth far more than I.\" At a gesture from Modeste\nhe continued gracefully: \"Yes, the poetry that I express he carries in\nhis heart; and if I speak thus openly before him it is because he has\nthe modesty of a nun.\"\n\n\"Enough, oh, enough!\" cried La Briere, who hardly knew which way to\nlook. \"My dear Canalis, you remind me of a mother who is seeking to\nmarry off her daughter.\"\n\n\"How is it, monsieur,\" said Charles Mignon, addressing Canalis, \"that\nyou can even think of becoming a political character?\"\n\n\"It is abdication,\" said Modeste, \"for a poet; politics are the resource\nof matter-of-fact men.\"\n\n\"Ah, mademoiselle, the rostrum is to-day the greatest theatre of the\nworld; it has succeeded the tournaments of chivalry, it is now the\nmeeting-place for all intellects, just as the army has been the\nrallying-point of courage.\"\n\nCanalis stuck spurs into his charger and talked for ten minutes on\npolitical life: \"Poetry was but a preface to the statesman.\" \"To-day the\norator has become a sublime reasoner, the shepherd of ideas.\" \"A poet\nmay point the way to nations or individuals, but can he ever cease to be\nhimself?\" He quoted Chateaubriand and declared that he would one day be\ngreater on the political side than on the literary. \"The forum of France\nwas to be the pharos of humanity.\" \"Oral battles supplanted fields of\nbattle: there were sessions of the Chamber finer than any Austerlitz,\nand orators were seen to be as lofty as generals; they spent their\nlives, their courage, their strength, as freely as those who went to\nwar.\" \"Speech was surely one of the most prodigal outlets of the vital\nfluid that man had ever known,\" etc.\n\nThis improvisation of modern commonplaces, clothed in sonorous phrases\nand newly invented words, and intended to prove that the Comte de\nCanalis was becoming one of the glories of the French government, made\na deep impression upon the notary and Gobenheim, and upon Madame\nLatournelle and Madame Mignon. Modeste looked as though she were at the\ntheatre, in an attitude of enthusiasm for an actor,--very much like\nthat of Ernest toward herself; for though the secretary knew all these\nhigh-sounding phrases by heart, he listened through the eyes, as it\nwere, of the young girl, and grew more and more madly in love with\nher. To this true lover, Modeste was eclipsing all the Modestes he had\ncreated as he read her letters and answered them.\n\nThis visit, the length of which was predetermined by Canalis, careful\nnot to allow his admirers a chance to get surfeited, ended by an\ninvitation to dinner on the following Monday.\n\n\"We shall not be at the Chalet,\" said the Comte de La Bastie. \"Dumay\nwill have sole possession of it. I return to the villa, having bought it\nback under a deed of redemption within six months, which I have to-day\nsigned with Monsieur Vilquin.\"\n\n\"I hope,\" said Dumay, \"that Vilquin will not be able to return to you\nthe sum you have just lent him, and that the villa will remain yours.\"\n\n\"It is an abode in keeping with your fortune,\" said Canalis.\n\n\"You mean the fortune that I am supposed to have,\" replied Charles\nMignon, hastily.\n\n\"It would be too sad,\" said Canalis, turning to Modeste with a charming\nlittle bow, \"if this Madonna were not framed in a manner worthy of her\ndivine perfections.\"\n\nThat was the only thing Canalis said to Modeste. He affected not to\nlook at her, and behaved like a man to whom all idea of marriage was\ninterdicted.\n\n\"Ah! my dear Madame Mignon,\" cried the notary's wife, as soon as the\ngravel was heard to grit under the feet of the Parisians, \"what an\nintellect!\"\n\n\"Is he rich?--that is the question,\" said Gobenheim.\n\nModeste was at the window, not losing a single movement of the great\npoet, and paying no attention to his companion. When Monsieur Mignon\nreturned to the salon, and Modeste, having received a last bow from the\ntwo friends as the carriage turned, went back to her seat, a weighty\ndiscussion took place, such as provincials invariably hold over\nParisians after a first interview. Gobenheim repeated his phrase, \"Is\nhe rich?\" as a chorus to the songs of praise sung by Madame Latournelle,\nModeste, and her mother.\n\n\"Rich!\" exclaimed Modeste; \"what can that signify! Do you not see that\nMonsieur de Canalis is one of those men who are destined for the highest\nplaces in the State. He has more than fortune; he possesses that which\ngives fortune.\"\n\n\"He will be minister or ambassador,\" said Monsieur Mignon.\n\n\"That won't hinder tax-payers from having to pay the costs of his\nfuneral,\" remarked the notary.\n\n\"How so?\" asked Charles Mignon.\n\n\"He strikes me as a man who will waste all the fortunes with whose gifts\nMademoiselle Modeste so liberally endows him,\" answered Latournelle.\n\n\"Modeste can't avoid being liberal to a poet who called her a Madonna,\"\nsaid Dumay, sneering, and faithful to the repulsion with which Canalis\nhad originally inspired him.\n\nGobenheim arranged the whist-table with all the more persistency\nbecause, since the return of Monsieur Mignon, Latournelle and Dumay had\nallowed themselves to play for ten sous points.\n\n\"Well, my little darling,\" said the father to the daughter in the\nembrasure of a window. \"Admit that papa thinks of everything. If you\nsend your orders this evening to your former dressmaker in Paris, and\nall your other furnishing people, you shall show yourself eight days\nhence in all the splendor of an heiress. Meantime we will install\nourselves in the villa. You already have a pretty horse, now order a\nhabit; you owe that amount of civility to the grand equerry.\"\n\n\"All the more because there will be a number of us to ride,\" said\nModeste, who was recovering the colors of health.\n\n\"The secretary did not say much,\" remarked Madame Mignon.\n\n\"A little fool,\" said Madame Latournelle; \"the poet has an attentive\nword for everybody. He thanked Monsieur Latournelle for his help in\nchoosing the house; and said he must have taken counsel with a woman of\ngood taste. But the other looked as gloomy as a Spaniard, and kept his\neyes fixed on Modeste as though he would like to swallow her whole. If\nhe had even looked at me I should have been afraid of him.\"\n\n\"He had a pleasant voice,\" said Madame Mignon.\n\n\"No doubt he came to Havre to inquire about the Mignons in the interests\nof his friend the poet,\" said Modeste, looking furtively at her father.\n\"It was certainly he whom we saw in church.\"\n\nMadame Dumay and Monsieur and Madame Latournelle, accepted this as the\nnatural explanation of Ernest's journey.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. OF WHICH THE AUTHOR THINKS A GOOD DEAL\n\n\"Do you know, Ernest,\" cried Canalis, when they had driven a short\ndistance from the house, \"I don't see any marriageable woman in society\nin Paris who compares with that adorable girl.\"\n\n\"Ah, that ends it!\" replied Ernest. \"She loves you, or she will love you\nif you desire it. Your fame won half the battle. Well, you may now\nhave it all your own way. You shall go there alone in future. Modeste\ndespises me; she is right to do so; and I don't see any reason why I\nshould condemn myself to see, to love, desire, and adore that which I\ncan never possess.\"\n\nAfter a few consoling remarks, dashed with his own satisfaction at\nhaving made a new version of Caesar's phrase, Canalis divulged a desire\nto break with the Duchesse de Chaulieu. La Briere, totally unable to\nkeep up the conversation, made the beauty of the night an excuse to be\nset down, and then rushed like one possessed to the seashore, where he\nstayed till past ten, in a half-demented state, walking hurriedly up\nand down, talking aloud in broken sentences, sometimes standing still\nor sitting down, without noticing the uneasiness of two custom-house\nofficers who were on the watch. After loving Modeste's wit and\nintellect and her aggressive frankness, he now joined adoration of her\nbeauty--that is to say, love without reason, love inexplicable--to all\nthe other reasons which had drawn him ten days earlier, to the church in\nHavre.\n\nHe returned to the Chalet, where the Pyrenees hounds barked at him till\nhe was forced to relinquish the pleasure of gazing at Modeste's windows.\nIn love, such things are of no more account to the lover than the work\nwhich is covered by the last layer of color is to an artist; yet they\nmake up the whole of love, just as the hidden toil is the whole of art.\nOut of them arise the great painter and the true lover whom the woman\nand the public end, sometimes too late, by adoring.\n\n\"Well then!\" he cried aloud, \"I will stay, I will suffer, I will love\nher for myself only, in solitude. Modeste shall be my sun, my life; I\nwill breathe with her breath, rejoice in her joys and bear her griefs,\nbe she even the wife of that egoist, Canalis.\"\n\n\"That's what I call loving, monsieur,\" said a voice which came from a\nshrub by the side of the road. \"Ha, ha, so all the world is in love with\nMademoiselle de La Bastie?\"\n\nAnd Butscha suddenly appeared and looked at La Briere. La Briere checked\nhis anger when, by the light of the moon, he saw the dwarf, and he made\na few steps without replying.\n\n\"Soldiers who serve in the same company ought to be good comrades,\"\nremarked Butscha. \"You don't love Canalis; neither do I.\"\n\n\"He is my friend,\" replied Ernest.\n\n\"Ha, you are the little secretary?\"\n\n\"You are to know, monsieur, that I am no man's secretary. I have the\nhonor to be of counsel to a supreme court of this kingdom.\"\n\n\"I have the honor to salute Monsieur de La Briere,\" said Butscha. \"I\nmyself have the honor to be head clerk to Latournelle, chief councillor\nof Havre, and my position is a better one than yours. Yes, I have had\nthe happiness of seeing Mademoiselle Modeste de La Bastie nearly every\nevening for the last four years, and I expect to live near her, as a\nking's servant lives in the Tuileries. If they offered me the throne of\nRussia I should answer, 'I love the sun too well.' Isn't that telling\nyou, monsieur, that I care more for her than for myself? I am looking\nafter her interests with the most honorable intentions. Do you believe\nthat the proud Duchesse de Chaulieu would cast a favorable eye on the\nhappiness of Madame de Canalis if her waiting-woman, who is in love with\nMonsieur Germain, not liking that charming valet's absence in Havre,\nwere to say to her mistress while brushing her hair--\"\n\n\"Who do you know about all this?\" said La Briere, interrupting Butscha.\n\n\"In the first place, I am clerk to a notary,\" answered Butscha. \"But\nhaven't you seen my hump? It is full of resources, monsieur. I have made\nmyself cousin to Mademoiselle Philoxene Jacmin, born at Honfleur, where\nmy mother was born, a Jacmin,--there are eight branches of the Jacmins\nat Honfleur. So my cousin Philoxene, enticed by the bait of a highly\nimprobable fortune, has told me a good many things.\"\n\n\"The duchess is vindictive?\" said La Briere.\n\n\"Vindictive as a queen, Philoxene says; she has never yet forgiven the\nduke for being nothing more than her husband,\" replied Butscha. \"She\nhates as she loves. I know all about her character, her tastes, her\ntoilette, her religion, and her manners; for Philoxene stripped her for\nme, soul and corset. I went to the opera expressly to see her, and I\ndidn't grudge the ten francs it cost me--I don't mean the play. If my\nimaginary cousin had not told me the duchess had seen her fifty summers,\nI should have thought I was over-generous in giving her thirty; she has\nnever known a winter, that duchess!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said La Briere, \"she is a cameo--preserved because it is stone.\nCanalis would be in a bad way if the duchess were to find out what he\nis doing here; and I hope, monsieur, that you will go no further in this\nbusiness of spying, which is unworthy of an honest man.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Butscha, proudly; \"for me Modeste is my country. I do\nnot spy; I foresee, I take precautions. The duchess will come here if\nit is desirable, or she will stay tranquilly where she is, according to\nwhat I judge best.\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"I.\"\n\n\"And how, pray?\"\n\n\"Ha, that's it!\" said the little hunchback, plucking a blade of grass.\n\"See here! this herb believes that men build palaces for it to grow in;\nit wedges its way between the closest blocks of marble, and brings\nthem down, just as the masses forced into the edifice of feudality have\nbrought it to the ground. The power of the feeble life that can creep\neverywhere is greater than that of the mighty behind their cannons. I\nam one of three who have sworn that Modeste shall be happy, and we would\nsell our honor for her. Adieu, monsieur. If you truly love Mademoiselle\nde La Bastie, forget this conversation and shake hands with me, for I\nthink you've got a heart. I longed to see the Chalet, and I got here\njust as SHE was putting out her light. I saw the dogs rush at you, and\nI overheard your words, and that is why I take the liberty of saying we\nserve in the same regiment--that of loyal devotion.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said La Briere, wringing the hunchback's hand, \"would you\nhave the friendliness to tell me if Mademoiselle Modeste ever loved any\none WITH LOVE before she wrote to Canalis?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Butscha in an altered voice; \"that thought is an insult.\nAnd even now, who knows if she really loves? does she know herself?\nShe is enamored of genius, of the soul and intellect of that seller of\nverses, that literary quack; but she will study him, we shall all study\nhim; and I know how to make the man's real character peep out from under\nthat turtle-shell of fine manners,--we'll soon see the petty little head\nof his ambition and his vanity!\" cried Butscha, rubbing his hands. \"So,\nunless mademoiselle is desperately taken with him--\"\n\n\"Oh! she was seized with admiration when she saw him, as if he were\nsomething marvellous,\" exclaimed La Briere, letting the secret of his\njealousy escape him.\n\n\"If he is a loyal, honest fellow, and loves her; if he is worthy of\nher; if he renounces his duchess,\" said Butscha,--\"then I'll manage the\nduchess! Here, my dear sir, take this road, and you will get home in ten\nminutes.\"\n\nBut as they parted, Butscha turned back and hailed poor Ernest, who,\nas a true lover, would gladly have stayed there all night talking of\nModeste.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Butscha, \"I have not yet had the honor of seeing our\ngreat poet. I am very curious to observe that magnificent phenomenon\nin the exercise of his functions. Do me the favor to bring him to the\nChalet to-morrow evening, and stay as long as possible; for it takes\nmore than an hour for a man to show himself for what he is. I shall be\nthe first to see if he loves, if he can love, or if he ever will love\nMademoiselle Modeste.\"\n\n\"You are very young to--\"\n\n\"--to be a professor,\" said Butscha, cutting short La Briere. \"Ha,\nmonsieur, deformed folks are born a hundred years old. And besides, a\nsick man who has long been sick, knows more than his doctor; he knows\nthe disease, and that is more than can be said for the best of doctors.\nWell, so it is with a man who cherishes a woman in his heart when the\nwoman is forced to disdain him for his ugliness or his deformity; he\nends by knowing so much of love that he becomes seductive, just as the\nsick man recovers his health; stupidity alone is incurable. I have\nhad neither father nor mother since I was six years old; I am now\ntwenty-five. Public charity has been my mother, the procureur du roi my\nfather. Oh! don't be troubled,\" he added, seeing Ernest's gesture; \"I am\nmuch more lively than my situation. Well, for the last six years, ever\nsince a woman's eye first told me I had no right to love, I do love, and\nI study women. I began with the ugly ones, for it is best to take the\nbull by the horns. So I took my master's wife, who has certainly been\nan angel to me, for my first study. Perhaps I did wrong; but I couldn't\nhelp it. I passed her through my alembic and what did I find? this\nthought, crouching at the bottom of her heart, 'I am not so ugly as they\nthink me'; and if a man were to work upon that thought he could bring\nher to the edge of the abyss, pious as she is.\"\n\n\"And have you studied Modeste?\"\n\n\"I thought I told you,\" replied Butscha, \"that my life belongs to her,\njust as France belongs to the king. Do you now understand what you\ncalled my spying in Paris? No one but me really knows what nobility,\nwhat pride, what devotion, what mysterious grace, what unwearying\nkindness, what true religion, gaiety, wit, delicacy, knowledge, and\ncourtesy there are in the soul and in the heart of that adorable\ncreature!\"\n\nButscha drew out his handkerchief and wiped his eyes, and La Briere\npressed his hand for a long time.\n\n\"I live in the sunbeam of her existence; it comes from her, it is\nabsorbed in me; that is how we are united,--as nature is to God, by the\nLight and by the Word. Adieu, monsieur; never in my life have I talked\nin this way; but seeing you beneath her windows, I felt in my heart that\nyou loved her as I love her.\"\n\nWithout waiting for an answer Butscha quitted the poor lover, into whose\nheart his words had put an inexpressible balm. Ernest resolved to make\na friend of him, not suspecting that the chief object of the clerk's\nloquacity was to gain communication with some one connected with\nCanalis. Ernest was rocked to sleep that night by the ebb and flow\nof thoughts and resolutions and plans for his future conduct, whereas\nCanalis slept the sleep of the conqueror, which is the sweetest of\nslumbers after that of the just.\n\nAt breakfast next morning, the friends agreed to spend the evening\nof the following day at the Chalet and initiate themselves into the\ndelights of provincial whist. To get rid of the day they ordered their\nhorses, purchased by Germain at a large price, and started on a voyage\nof discovery round the country, which was quite as unknown to them\nas China; for the most foreign thing to Frenchmen in France is France\nitself.\n\nBy dint of reflecting on his position as an unfortunate and despised\nlover, Ernest went through something of the same process as Modeste's\nfirst letter had forced upon him. Though sorrow is said to develop\nvirtue, it only develops it in virtuous persons; that cleaning-out of\nthe conscience takes place only in persons who are by nature clean.\nLa Briere vowed to endure his sufferings in Spartan silence, to act\nworthily, and give way to no baseness; while Canalis, fascinated by the\nenormous \"dot,\" was telling himself to take every means of captivating\nthe heiress. Selfishness and devotion, the key-notes of the two\ncharacters, therefore took, by the action of a moral law which is often\nvery odd in its effects, certain measures that were contrary to their\nrespective natures. The selfish man put on self-abnegation; the man who\nthought chiefly of others took refuge on the Aventinus of pride. That\nphenomenon is often seen in political life. Men frequently turn their\ncharacters wrong side out, and it sometimes happens that the public is\nunable to tell which is the right side.\n\nAfter dinner the two friends heard of the arrival of the grand equerry,\nwho was presented at the Chalet the same evening by Latournelle.\nMademoiselle d'Herouville had contrived to wound that worthy man by\nsending a footmen to tell him to come to her, instead of sending her\nnephew in person; thus depriving the notary of a distinguished visit he\nwould certainly have talked about for the rest of his natural life. So\nLatournelle curtly informed the grand equerry, when he proposed to\ndrive him to the Chalet, that he was engaged to take Madame Latournelle.\nGuessing from the little man's sulky manner that there was some blunder\nto repair, the duke said graciously:--\n\n\"Then I shall have the pleasure, if you will allow me, of taking Madame\nLatournelle also.\"\n\nDisregarding Mademoiselle d'Herouville's haughty shrug, the duke left\nthe room with the notary. Madame Latournelle, half-crazed with joy at\nseeing the gorgeous carriage at her door, with footmen in royal livery\nletting down the steps, was too agitated on hearing that the grand\nequerry had called for her, to find her gloves, her parasol, her\nabsurdity, or her usual air of pompous dignity. Once in the carriage,\nhowever, and while expressing confused thanks and civilities to the\nlittle duke, she suddenly exclaimed, from a thought in her kind heart,--\n\n\"But Butscha, where is he?\"\n\n\"Let us take Butscha,\" said the duke, smiling.\n\nWhen the people on the quays, attracted in groups by the splendor of the\nroyal equipage, saw the funny spectacle, the three little men with the\nspare gigantic woman, they looked at one another and laughed.\n\n\"If you melt all three together, they might make one man fit to mate\nwith that big cod-fish,\" said a sailor from Bordeaux.\n\n\"Is there any other thing you would like to take with you, madame?\"\nasked the duke, jestingly, while the footman awaited his orders.\n\n\"No, monseigneur,\" she replied, turning scarlet and looking at her\nhusband as much as to say, \"What did I do wrong?\"\n\n\"Monsieur le duc honors me by considering that I am a thing,\" said\nButscha; \"a poor clerk is usually thought to be a nonentity.\"\n\nThough this was said with a laugh, the duke colored and did not answer.\nGreat people are to blame for joking with their social inferiors.\nJesting is a game, and games presuppose equality; it is to obviate any\ninconvenient results of this temporary equality that players have the\nright, after the game is over, not to recognize each other.\n\nThe visit of the grand equerry had the ostensible excuse of an important\npiece of business; namely, the retrieval of an immense tract of waste\nland left by the sea between the mouths of the two rivers, which\ntract had just been adjudged by the Council of State to the house of\nHerouville. The matter was nothing less than putting flood-gates with\ndouble bridges, draining three or four hundred acres, cutting canals,\nand laying out roadways. When the duke had explained the condition of\nthe land, Charles Mignon remarked that time must be allowed for the\nsoil, which was still moving, to settle and grow solid in a natural way.\n\n\"Time, which has providentially enriched your house, Monsieur le duc,\ncan alone complete the work,\" he said, in conclusion. \"It would be\nprudent to let fifty years elapse before you reclaim the land.\"\n\n\"Do not let that be your final word, Monsieur le comte,\" said the duke.\n\"Come to Herouville and see things for yourself.\"\n\nCharles Mignon replied that every capitalist should take time to examine\ninto such matters with a cool head, thus giving the duke a pretext for\nhis visits to the Chalet. The sight of Modeste made a lively impression\non the young man, and he asked the favor of receiving her at Herouville\nwith her father, saying that his sister and his aunt had heard much of\nher, and wished to make her acquaintance. On this the count proposed\nto present his daughter to those ladies himself, and invited the whole\nparty to dinner on the day of his return to the villa. The duke accepted\nthe invitation. The blue ribbon, the title, and above all, the ecstatic\nglances of the noble gentleman had an effect upon Modeste; but she\nappeared to great advantage in carriage, dignity, and conversation. The\nduke withdrew reluctantly, carrying with him an invitation to visit the\nChalet every evening,--an invitation based on the impossibility of a\ncourtier of Charles X. existing for a single evening without his rubber.\n\nThe following evening, therefore, Modeste was to see all three of her\nlovers. No matter what young girls may say, and though the logic of\nthe heart may lead them to sacrifice everything to preference, it is\nextremely flattering to their self-love to see a number of rival\nadorers around them,--distinguished or celebrated men, or men of ancient\nlineage,--all endeavoring to shine and to please. Suffer as Modeste may\nin general estimation, it must be told she subsequently admitted that\nthe sentiments expressed in her letters paled before the pleasure of\nseeing three such different minds at war with one another,--three men\nwho, taken separately, would each have done honor to the most exacting\nfamily. Yet this luxury of self-love was checked by a misanthropical\nspitefulness, resulting from the terrible wound she had\nreceived,--although by this time she was beginning to think of that\nwound as a disappointment only. So when her father said to her,\nlaughing, \"Well, Modeste, do you want to be a duchess?\" she answered,\nwith a mocking curtsey,--\n\n\"Sorrows have made me philosophical.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to be only a baroness?\" asked Butscha.\n\n\"Or a viscountess?\" said her father.\n\n\"How could that be?\" she asked quickly.\n\n\"If you accept Monsieur de La Briere, he has enough merit and influence\nto obtain permission from the king to bear my titles and arms.\"\n\n\"Oh, if it comes to disguising himself, _he_ will not make any\ndifficulty,\" said Modeste, scornfully.\n\nButscha did not understand this epigram, whose meaning could only be\nguessed by Monsieur and Madame Mignon and Dumay.\n\n\"When it is a question of marriage, all men disguise themselves,\"\nremarked Latournelle, \"and women set them the example. I've heard\nit said ever since I came into the world that 'Monsieur this or\nMademoiselle that has made a good marriage,'--meaning that the other\nside had made a bad one.\"\n\n\"Marriage,\" said Butscha, \"is like a lawsuit; there's always one side\ndiscontented. If one dupes the other, certainly half the husbands in the\nworld are playing a comedy at the expense of the other half.\"\n\n\"From which you conclude, Sieur Butscha?\" inquired Modeste.\n\n\"To pay the utmost attention to the manoeuvres of the enemy,\" answered\nthe clerk.\n\n\"What did I tell you, my darling?\" said Charles Mignon, alluding to\ntheir conversation on the seashore.\n\n\"Men play as many parts to get married as mothers make their daughters\nplay to get rid of them,\" said Latournelle.\n\n\"Then you approve of stratagems?\" said Modeste.\n\n\"On both sides,\" cried Gobenheim, \"and that brings it even.\"\n\nThis conversation was carried on by fits and starts, as they say, in the\nintervals of cutting and dealing the cards; and it soon turned chiefly\non the merits of the Duc d'Herouville, who was thought very good-looking\nby little Latournelle, little Dumay, and little Butscha. Without the\nforegoing discussion on the lawfulness of matrimonial tricks, the\nreader might possibly find the forthcoming account of the evening so\nimpatiently awaited by Butscha, somewhat too long.\n\nDesplein, the famous surgeon, arrived the next morning, and stayed only\nlong enough to send to Havre for fresh horses and have them put-to,\nwhich took about an hour. After examining Madame Mignon's eyes, he\ndecided that she could recover her sight, and fixed a suitable time, a\nmonth later, to perform the operation. This important consultation took\nplace before the assembled members of the Chalet, who stood trembling\nand expectant to hear the verdict of the prince of science. That\nillustrious member of the Academy of Sciences put about a dozen brief\nquestions to the blind woman as he examined her eyes in the strong light\nfrom a window. Modeste was amazed at the value which a man so celebrated\nattached to time, when she saw the travelling-carriage piled with books\nwhich the great surgeon proposed to read during the journey; for he had\nleft Paris the evening before, and had spent the night in sleeping and\ntravelling. The rapidity and clearness of Desplein's judgment on each\nanswer made by Madame Mignon, his succinct tone, his decisive manner,\ngave Modeste her first real idea of a man of genius. She perceived\nthe enormous difference between a second-rate man, like Canalis, and\nDesplein, who was even more than a superior man. A man of genius finds\nin the consciousness of his talent and in the solidity of his fame an\narena of his own, where his legitimate pride can expand and exercise\nitself without interfering with others. Moreover, his perpetual struggle\nwith men and things leave them no time for the coxcombry of fashionable\ngenius, which makes haste to gather in the harvests of a fugitive\nseason, and whose vanity and self-love are as petty and exacting as a\ncustom-house which levies tithes on all that comes in its way.\n\nModeste was the more enchanted by this great practical genius, because\nhe was evidently charmed with the exquisite beauty of Modeste,--he,\nthrough whose hands so many women had passed, and who had long since\nexamined the sex, as it were, with magnifier and scalpel.\n\n\"It would be a sad pity,\" he said, with an air of gallantry which he\noccasionally put on, and which contrasted with his assumed brusqueness,\n\"if a mother were deprived of the sight of so charming a daughter.\"\n\nModeste insisted on serving the simple breakfast which was all the\ngreat surgeon would accept. She accompanied her father and Dumay to the\ncarriage stationed at the garden-gate, and said to Desplein at parting,\nher eyes shining with hope,--\n\n\"And will my dear mamma really see me?\"\n\n\"Yes, my little sprite, I'll promise you that,\" he answered, smiling;\n\"and I am incapable of deceiving you, for I, too, have a daughter.\"\n\nThe horses started and carried him off as he uttered the last words with\nunexpected grace and feeling. Nothing is more charming than the peculiar\nunexpectedness of persons of talent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. THE POET DOES HIS EXERCISES\n\nThis visit of the great surgeon was the event of the day, and it left a\nluminous trace in Modeste's soul. The young enthusiast ardently admired\nthe man whose life belonged to others, and in whom the habit of studying\nphysical suffering had destroyed the manifestations of egoism. That\nevening, when Gobenheim, the Latournelles, and Butscha, Canalis,\nErnest, and the Duc d'Herouville were gathered in the salon, they all\ncongratulated the Mignon family on the hopes which Desplein encouraged.\nThe conversation, in which the Modeste of her letters was once more in\nthe ascendant, turned naturally on the man whose genius, unfortunately\nfor his fame, was appreciable only by the faculty and men of science.\nGobenheim contributed a phrase which is the sacred chrism of genius as\ninterpreted in these days by public economists and bankers,--\n\n\"He makes a mint of money.\"\n\n\"They say he is very grasping,\" added Canalis.\n\nThe praises which Modeste showered on Desplein had annoyed the poet.\nVanity acts like a woman,--they both think they are defrauded when love\nor praise is bestowed on others. Voltaire was jealous of the wit of a\nroue whom Paris admired for two days; and even a duchess takes offence\nat a look bestowed upon her maid. The avarice excited by these two\nsentiments is such that a fraction of them given to the poor is thought\nrobbery.\n\n\"Do you think, monsieur,\" said Modeste, smiling, \"that we should judge\ngenius by ordinary standards?\"\n\n\"Perhaps we ought first of all to define the man of genius,\" replied\nCanalis. \"One of the conditions of genius is invention,--invention of a\nform, a system, a force. Napoleon was an inventor, apart from his other\nconditions of genius. He invented his method of making war. Walter Scott\nis an inventor, Linnaeus is an inventor, Geoffrey Saint-Hilaire and\nCuvier are inventors. Such men are men of genius of the first rank. They\nrenew, increase, or modify both science and art. But Desplein is merely\na man whose vast talent consists in properly applying laws already\nknown; in observing, by means of a natural gift, the limits laid down\nfor each temperament, and the time appointed by Nature for an operation.\nHe has not founded, like Hippocrates, the science itself. He has\ninvented no system, as did Galen, Broussais, and Rasori. He is merely an\nexecutive genius, like Moscheles on the piano, Paganini on the violin,\nor Farinelli on his own larynx,--men who have developed enormous\nfaculties, but who have not created music. You must permit me to\ndiscriminate between Beethoven and la Catalani: to one belongs the\nimmortal crown of genius and of martyrdom, to the other innumerable\nfive-franc pieces; one we can pay in coin, but the world remains\nthroughout all time a debtor to the other. Each day increases our debt\nto Moliere, but Baron's comedies have been overpaid.\"\n\n\"I think you make the prerogative of ideas too exclusive,\" said Ernest\nde La Briere, in a quiet and melodious voice, which formed a sudden\ncontrast to the peremptory tones of the poet, whose flexible organ had\nabandoned its caressing notes for the strident and magisterial voice\nof the rostrum. \"Genius must be estimated according to its utility;\nand Parmentier, who brought potatoes into general use, Jacquart, the\ninventor of silk looms; Papin, who first discovered the elastic quality\nof steam, are men of genius, to whom statues will some day be erected.\nThey have changed, or they will change in a certain sense, the face of\nthe State. It is in that sense that Desplein will always be considered\na man of genius by thinkers; they see him attended by a generation of\nsufferers whose pains are stifled by his hand.\"\n\nThat Ernest should give utterance to this opinion was enough to make\nModeste oppose it.\n\n\"If that be so, monsieur,\" she said, \"then the man who could discover a\nway to mow wheat without injuring the straw, by a machine that could do\nthe work of ten men, would be a man of genius.\"\n\n\"Yes, my daughter,\" said Madame Mignon; \"and the poor would bless him\nfor cheaper bread,--he that is blessed by the poor is blessed of God.\"\n\n\"That is putting utility above art,\" said Modeste, shaking her head.\n\n\"Without utility what would become of art?\" said Charles Mignon. \"What\nwould it rest on? what would it live on? Where would you lodge, and how\nwould you pay the poet?\"\n\n\"Oh! my dear papa, such opinions are fearfully flat and antediluvian!\nI am not surprised that Gobenheim and Monsieur de La Briere, who are\ninterested in the solution of social problems should think so; but you,\nwhose life has been the most useless poetry of the century,--useless\nbecause the blood you shed all over Europe, and the horrible sufferings\nexacted by your colossus, did not prevent France from losing ten\ndepartments acquired under the Revolution,--how can _you_ give in to\nsuch excessively pig-tail notions, as the idealists say? It is plain\nyou've just come from China.\"\n\nThe impertinence of Modeste's speech was heightened by a little air\nof contemptuous disdain which she purposely put on, and which fairly\nastounded Madame Mignon, Madame Latournelle, and Dumay. As for Madame\nLatournelle, she opened her eyes so wide she no longer saw anything.\nButscha, whose alert attention was comparable to that of a spy, looked\nat Monsieur Mignon, expecting to see him flush with sudden and violent\nindignation.\n\n\"A little more, young lady, and you will be wanting in respect for your\nfather,\" said the colonel, smiling, and noticing Butscha's look. \"See\nwhat it is to spoil one's children!\"\n\n\"I am your only child,\" she said saucily.\n\n\"Child, indeed,\" remarked the notary, significantly.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Modeste, turning upon him, \"my father is delighted to\nhave me for his governess; he gave me life and I give him knowledge; he\nwill soon owe me something.\"\n\n\"There seems occasion for it,\" said Madame Mignon.\n\n\"But mademoiselle is right,\" said Canalis, rising and standing before\nthe fireplace in one of the finest attitudes of his collection. \"God,\nin his providence, has given food and clothing to man, but he has not\ndirectly given him art. He says to man: 'To live, thou must bow thyself\nto earth; to think, thou shalt lift thyself to Me.' We have as much need\nof the life of the soul as of the life of the body,--hence, there are\ntwo utilities. It is true we cannot be shod by books or clothed by\npoems. An epic song is not, if you take the utilitarian view, as useful\nas the broth of a charity kitchen. The noblest ideas will not sail a\nvessel in place of canvas. It is quite true that the cotton-gin gives us\ncalicoes for thirty sous a yard less than we ever paid before; but that\nmachine and all other industrial perfections will not breathe the breath\nof life into a people, will not tell futurity of a civilization that\nonce existed. Art, on the contrary, Egyptian, Mexican, Grecian, Roman\nart, with their masterpieces--now called useless!--reveal the existence\nof races back in the vague immense of time, beyond where the great\nintermediary nations, denuded of men of genius, have disappeared,\nleaving not a line nor a trace behind them! The works of genius are the\n'summum' of civilization, and presuppose utility. Surely a pair of boots\nare not as agreeable to your eyes as a fine play at the theatre; and you\ndon't prefer a windmill to the church of Saint-Ouen, do you? Well then,\nnations are imbued with the same feelings as the individual man, and\nthe man's cherished desire is to survive himself morally just as he\npropagates himself physically. The survival of a people is the work of\nits men of genius. At this very moment France is proving, energetically,\nthe truth of that theory. She is, undoubtedly, excelled by England in\ncommerce, industry, and navigation, and yet she is, I believe, at the\nhead of the world,--by reason of her artists, her men of talent, and the\ngood taste of her products. There is no artist and no superior intellect\nthat does not come to Paris for a diploma. There is no school of\npainting at this moment but that of France; and we shall reign far\nlonger and perhaps more securely by our books than by our swords. In La\nBriere's system, on the other hand, all that is glorious and lovely must\nbe suppressed,--woman's beauty, music, painting, poetry. Society will\nnot be overthrown, that is true, but, I ask you, who would willingly\naccept such a life? All useful things are ugly and forbidding. A kitchen\nis indispensable, but you take care not to sit there; you live in the\nsalon, which you adorn, like this, with superfluous things. Of what\n_use_, let me ask you, are these charming wall-paintings, this carved\nwood-work? There is nothing beautiful but that which seems to us\nuseless. We called the sixteenth century the Renascence with admirable\ntruth of language. That century was the dawn of a new era. Men will\ncontinue to speak of it when all remembrance of anterior centuries had\npassed away,--their only merit being that they once existed, like the\nmillion beings who count as the rubbish of a generation.\"\n\n\"Rubbish! yes, that may be, but my rubbish is dear to me,\" said the\nDuc d'Herouville, laughing, during the silent pause which followed the\npoet's pompous oration.\n\n\"Let me ask,\" said Butscha, attacking Canalis, \"does art, the sphere in\nwhich, according to you, genius is required to evolve itself, exist at\nall? Is it not a splendid lie, a delusion, of the social man? Do I want\na landscape scene of Normandy in my bedroom when I can look out and see\na better one done by God himself? Our dreams make poems more glorious\nthan Iliads. For an insignificant sum of money I can find at Valogne, at\nCarentan, in Provence, at Arles, many a Venus as beautiful as those\nof Titian. The police gazette publishes tales, differing somewhat\nfrom those of Walter Scott, but ending tragically with blood, not ink.\nHappiness and virtue exist above and beyond both art and genius.\"\n\n\"Bravo, Butscha!\" cried Madame Latournelle.\n\n\"What did he say?\" asked Canalis of La Briere, failing to gather from\nthe eyes and attitude of Mademoiselle Mignon the usual signs of artless\nadmiration.\n\nThe contemptuous indifference which Modeste had exhibited toward La\nBriere, and above all, her disrespectful speeches to her father, so\ndepressed the young man that he made no answer to Canalis; his eyes,\nfixed sorrowfully on Modeste, were full of deep meditation. The Duc\nd'Herouville took up Butscha's argument and reproduced it with much\nintelligence, saying finally that the ecstasies of Saint-Theresa were\nfar superior to the creations of Lord Byron.\n\n\"Oh, Monsieur le duc,\" exclaimed Modeste, \"hers was a purely personal\npoetry, whereas the genius of Lord Byron and Moliere benefit the world.\"\n\n\"How do you square that opinion with those of Monsieur le baron?\" cried\nCharles Mignon, quickly. \"Now you are insisting that genius must be\nuseful, and benefit the world as though it were cotton,--but perhaps you\nthink logic as antediluvian as your poor old father.\"\n\nButscha, La Briere, and Madame Latournelle exchanged glances that were\nmore than half derisive, and drove Modeste to a pitch of irritation that\nkept her silent for a moment.\n\n\"Mademoiselle, do not mind them,\" said Canalis, smiling upon her, \"we\nare neither beaten, nor caught in a contradiction. Every work of art,\nlet it be in literature, music, painting, sculpture, or architecture,\nimplies a positive social utility, equal to that of all other commercial\nproducts. Art is pre-eminently commerce; presupposes it, in short. An\nauthor pockets ten thousand francs for his book; the making of books\nmeans the manufactory of paper, a foundry, a printing-office, a\nbookseller,--in other words, the employment of thousands of men. The\nexecution of a symphony of Beethoven or an opera by Rossini requires\nhuman arms and machinery and manufactures. The cost of a monument is\nan almost brutal case in point. In short, I may say that the works of\ngenius have an extremely costly basis and are, necessarily, useful to\nthe workingman.\"\n\nAstride of that theme, Canalis spoke for some minutes with a fine luxury\nof metaphor, and much inward complacency as to his phrases; but it\nhappened with him, as with many another great speaker, that he found\nhimself at last at the point from which the conversation started, and in\nfull agreement with La Briere without perceiving it.\n\n\"I see with much pleasure, my dear baron,\" said the little duke, slyly,\n\"that you will make an admirable constitutional minister.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Canalis, with the gesture of a great man, \"what is the use\nof all these discussions? What do they prove?--the eternal verity of one\naxiom: All things are true, all things are false. Moral truths as well\nas human beings change their aspect according to their surroundings, to\nthe point of being actually unrecognizable.\"\n\n\"Society exists through settled opinions,\" said the Duc d'Herouville.\n\n\"What laxity!\" whispered Madame Latournelle to her husband.\n\n\"He is a poet,\" said Gobenheim, who overheard her.\n\nCanalis, who was ten leagues above the heads of his audience, and who\nmay have been right in his last philosophical remark, took the sort\nof coldness which now overspread the surrounding faces of a symptom of\nprovincial ignorance; but seeing that Modeste understood him, he\nwas content, being wholly unaware that monologue is particularly\ndisagreeable to country-folk, whose principal desire it is to exhibit\nthe manner of life and the wit and wisdom of the provinces to Parisians.\n\n\"It is long since you have seen the Duchesse de Chaulieu?\" asked the\nduke, addressing Canalis, as if to change the conversation.\n\n\"I left her about six days ago.\"\n\n\"Is she well?\" persisted the duke.\n\n\"Perfectly well.\"\n\n\"Have the kindness to remember me to her when you write.\"\n\n\"They say she is charming,\" remarked Modeste, addressing the duke.\n\n\"Monsieur le baron can speak more confidently than I,\" replied the grand\nequerry.\n\n\"More than charming,\" said Canalis, making the best of the duke's\nperfidy; \"but I am partial, mademoiselle; she has been a friend to me\nfor the last ten years; I owe all that is good in me to her; she has\nsaved me from the dangers of the world. Moreover, Monsieur le Duc de\nChaulieu launched me in my present career. Without the influence of that\nfamily the king and the princesses would have forgotten a poor poet\nlike me; therefore my affection for the duchess must always be full of\ngratitude.\"\n\nHis voice quivered.\n\n\"We ought to love the woman who has led you to write those sublime\npoems, and who inspires you with such noble feelings,\" said Modeste,\nquite affected. \"Who can think of a poet without a muse!\"\n\n\"He would be without a heart,\" replied Canalis. \"He would write barren\nverses like Voltaire, who never loved any one but Voltaire.\"\n\n\"I thought you did me the honor to say, in Paris,\" interrupted Dumay,\n\"that you never felt the sentiments you expressed.\"\n\n\"The shoe fits, my soldier,\" replied the poet, smiling; \"but let me tell\nyou that it is quite possible to have a great deal of feeling both in\nthe intellectual life and in real life. My good friend here, La Briere,\nis madly in love,\" continued Canalis, with a fine show of generosity,\nlooking at Modeste. \"I, who certainly love as much as he,--that is, I\nthink so unless I delude myself,--well, I can give to my love a literary\nform in harmony with its character. But I dare not say, mademoiselle,\"\nhe added, turning to Modeste with too studied a grace, \"that to-morrow I\nmay not be without inspiration.\"\n\nThus the poet triumphed over all obstacles. In honor of his love he\nrode a-tilt at the hindrances that were thrown in his way, and Modeste\nremained wonder-struck at the Parisian wit that scintillated in his\ndeclamatory discourse, of which she had hitherto known little or\nnothing.\n\n\"What an acrobat!\" whispered Butscha to Latournelle, after listening\nto a magnificent tirade on the Catholic religion and the happiness\nof having a pious wife,--served up in response to a remark by Madame\nMignon.\n\nModeste's eyes were blindfolded as it were; Canalis's elocution and the\nclose attention which she was predetermined to pay to him prevented her\nfrom seeing that Butscha was carefully noting the declamation, the want\nof simplicity, the emphasis that took the place of feeling, and the\ncurious incoherencies in the poet's speech which led the dwarf to make\nhis rather cruel comment. At certain points of Canalis's discourse, when\nMonsieur Mignon, Dumay, Butscha, and Latournelle wondered at the\nman's utter want of logic, Modeste admired his suppleness, and said to\nherself, as she dragged him after her through the labyrinth of fancy,\n\"He loves me!\" Butscha, in common with the other spectators of what\nwe must call a stage scene, was struck with the radiant defect of all\negoists, which Canalis, like many men accustomed to perorate, allowed to\nbe too plainly seen. Whether he understood beforehand what the person he\nwas speaking to meant to say, whether he was not listening, or whether\nhe had the faculty of listening when he was thinking of something\nelse, it is certain that Melchior's face wore an absent-minded look in\nconversation, which disconcerted the ideas of others and wounded their\nvanity. Not to listen is not merely a want of politeness, it is a mark\nof disrespect. Canalis pushed this habit too far; for he often forgot\nto answer a speech which required an answer, and passed, without the\nordinary transitions of courtesy, to the subject, whatever it was, that\npreoccupied him. Though such impertinence is accepted without protest\nfrom a man of marked distinction, it stirs a leaven of hatred and\nvengeance in many hearts; in those of equals it even goes so far as to\ndestroy a friendship. If by chance Melchior was forced to listen, he\nfell into another fault; he merely lent his attention, and never\ngave it. Though this may not be so mortifying, it shows a kind of\nsemi-concession which is almost as unsatisfactory to the hearer and\nleaves him dissatisfied. Nothing brings more profit in the commerce\nof society than the small change of attention. He that heareth let him\nhear, is not only a gospel precept, it is an excellent speculation;\nfollow it, and all will be forgiven you, even vice. Canalis took a great\ndeal of trouble in his anxiety to please Modeste; but though he was\ncompliant enough with her, he fell back into his natural self with the\nothers.\n\nModeste, pitiless for the ten martyrs she was making, begged Canalis to\nread some of his poems; she wanted, she said, a specimen of his gift for\nreading, of which she had heard so much. Canalis took the volume which\nshe gave him, and cooed (for that is the proper word) a poem which is\ngenerally considered his finest,--an imitation of Moore's \"Loves of the\nAngels,\" entitled \"Vitalis,\" which Monsieur and Madame Dumay, Madame\nLatournelle, and Gobenheim welcomed with a few yawns.\n\n\"If you are a good whist-player, monsieur,\" said Gobenheim, flourishing\nfive cards held like a fan, \"I must say I have never met a man as\naccomplished as you.\"\n\nThe remark raised a laugh, for it was the translation of everybody's\nthought.\n\n\"I play it sufficiently well to live in the provinces for the rest of my\ndays,\" replied Canalis. \"That, I think, is enough, and more than enough\nliterature and conversation for whist-players,\" he added, throwing the\nvolume impatiently on a table.\n\nThis little incident serves to show what dangers environ a drawing-room\nhero when he steps, like Canalis, out of his sphere; he is like the\nfavorite actor of a second-rate audience, whose talent is lost when he\nleaves his own boards and steps upon those of an upper-class theatre.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. MODESTE PLAYS HER PART\n\nThe game opened with the baron and the duke, Gobenheim and Latournelle\nas partners. Modeste took a seat near the poet, to Ernest's deep\ndisappointment; he watched the face of the wayward girl, and marked the\nprogress of the fascination which Canalis exerted over her. La\nBriere had not the gift of seduction which Melchior possessed. Nature\nfrequently denies it to true hearts, who are, as a rule, timid. This\ngift demands fearlessness, an alacrity of ways and means that might be\ncalled the trapeze of the mind; a little mimicry goes with it; in fact\nthere is always, morally speaking, something of the comedian in a poet.\nThere is a vast difference between expressing sentiments we do not feel,\nthough we may imagine all their variations, and feigning to feel them\nwhen bidding for success on the theatre of private life. And yet, though\nthe necessary hypocrisy of a man of the world may have gangrened a poet,\nhe ends by carrying the faculties of his talent into the expression of\nany required sentiment, just as a great man doomed to solitude ends by\ninfusing his heart into his mind.\n\n\"He is after the millions,\" thought La Briere, sadly; \"and he can play\npassion so well that Modeste will believe him.\"\n\nInstead of endeavoring to appear more amiable and wittier than his\nrival, Ernest imitated the Duc d'Herouville, and was gloomy, anxious,\nand watchful; but whereas the courier studied the freaks of the young\nheiress, Ernest simply fell a prey to the pains of dark and concentrated\njealousy. He had not yet been able to obtain a glance from his idol.\nAfter a while he left the room with Butscha.\n\n\"It is all over!\" he said; \"she is caught by him; I am more disagreeable\nto her, and moreover, she is right. Canalis is charming; there's\nintellect in his silence, passion in his eyes, poetry in his\nrhodomontades.\"\n\n\"Is he an honest man?\" asked Butscha.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" replied La Briere. \"He is loyal and chivalrous, and capable\nof getting rid, under Modeste's influence, of those affectations which\nMadame de Chaulieu has taught him.\"\n\n\"You are a fine fellow,\" said the hunchback; \"but is he capable of\nloving,--will he love her?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" answered La Briere. \"Has she said anything about me?\" he\nasked after a moment's silence.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Butscha, and he repeated Modeste's speech about disguises.\n\nPoor Ernest flung himself upon a bench and held his head in his hands.\nHe could not keep back his tears, and he did not wish Butscha to see\nthem; but the dwarf was the very man to guess his emotion.\n\n\"What troubles you?\" he asked.\n\n\"She is right!\" cried Ernest, springing up; \"I am a wretch.\"\n\nAnd he related the deception into which Canalis had led him when\nModeste's first letter was received, carefully pointing out to Butscha\nthat he had wished to undeceive the young girl before she herself\ntook off the mask, and apostrophizing, in rather juvenile fashion, his\nluckless destiny. Butscha sympathetically understood the love in the\nflavor and vigor of his simple language, and in his deep and genuine\nanxiety.\n\n\"But why don't you show yourself to Mademoiselle Modeste for what you\nare?\" he said; \"why do you let your rival do his exercises?\"\n\n\"Have you never felt your throat tighten when you wished to speak to\nher?\" cried La Briere; \"is there never a strange feeling in the roots of\nyour hair and on the surface of your skin when she looks at you,--even\nif she is thinking of something else?\"\n\n\"But you had sufficient judgment to show displeasure when she as good as\ntold her excellent father that he was a dolt.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I love her too well not to have felt a knife in my heart when\nI heard her contradicting her own perfections.\"\n\n\"Canalis supported her.\"\n\n\"If she had more self-love than heart there would be nothing for a man\nto regret in losing her,\" answered La Briere.\n\nAt this moment, Modeste, followed by Canalis, who had lost the rubber,\ncame out with her father and Madame Dumay to breathe the fresh air of\nthe starry night. While his daughter walked about with the poet, Charles\nMignon left her and came up to La Briere.\n\n\"Your friend, monsieur, ought to have been a lawyer,\" he said, smiling\nand looking attentively at the young man.\n\n\"You must not judge a poet as you would an ordinary man,--as you would\nme, for example, Monsieur le comte,\" said La Briere. \"A poet has a\nmission. He is obliged by his nature to see the poetry of questions,\njust as he expresses that of things. When you think him inconsistent\nwith himself he is really faithful to his vocation. He is a painter\ncopying with equal truth a Madonna and a courtesan. Moliere is as true\nto nature in his old men as in his young ones, and Moliere's judgment\nwas assuredly a sound and healthy one. These witty paradoxes might be\ndangerous for second-rate minds, but they have no real influence on the\ncharacter of great men.\"\n\nCharles Mignon pressed La Briere's hand.\n\n\"That adaptability, however, leads a man to excuse himself in his own\neyes for actions that are diametrically opposed to each other; above\nall, in politics.\"\n\n\"Ah, mademoiselle,\" Canalis was at this moment saying, in a caressing\nvoice, replying to a roguish remark of Modeste, \"do not think that a\nmultiplicity of emotions can in any way lessen the strength of feelings.\nPoets, even more than other men, must needs love with constancy and\nfaith. You must not be jealous of what is called the Muse. Happy is the\nwife of a man whose days are occupied. If you heard the complaints of\nwomen who have to endure the burden of an idle husband, either a man\nwithout duties, or one so rich as to have nothing to do, you would know\nthat the highest happiness of a Parisian wife is freedom,--the right\nto rule in her own home. Now we writers and men of functions and\noccupations, we leave the sceptre to our wives; we cannot descend to\nthe tyranny of little minds; we have something better to do. If I ever\nmarry,--which I assure you is a catastrophe very remote at the present\nmoment,--I should wish my wife to enjoy the same moral freedom that\na mistress enjoys, and which is perhaps the real source of her\nattraction.\"\n\nCanalis talked on, displaying the warmth of his fancy and all his\ngraces, for Modeste's benefit, as he spoke of love, marriage, and the\nadoration of women, until Monsieur Mignon, who had rejoined them, seized\nthe opportunity of a slight pause to take his daughter's arm and lead\nher up to Ernest de La Briere, whom he had been advising to seek an open\nexplanation with her.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said Ernest, in a voice that was scarcely his own,\n\"it is impossible for me to remain any longer under the weight of\nyour displeasure. I do not defend myself; I do not seek to justify my\nconduct; I desire only to make you see that _before_ reading your most\nflattering letter, addressed to the individual and no longer to the\npoet,--the last which you sent to me,--I wished, and I told you in my\nnote written at Havre that I wished, to correct the error under which\nyou were acting. All the feelings that I have had the happiness to\nexpress to you are sincere. A hope dawned on me in Paris when your\nfather told me he was comparatively poor,--but now that all is lost, now\nthat nothing is left for me but endless regrets, why should I stay\nhere where all is torture? Let me carry away with me one smile to live\nforever in my heart.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" answered Modeste, who seemed cold and absent-minded, \"I am\nnot the mistress of this house; but I certainly should deeply regret to\nretain any one where he finds neither pleasure nor happiness.\"\n\nShe left La Briere and took Madame Dumay's arm to re-enter the house. A\nfew moments later all the actors in this domestic scene reassembled in\nthe salon, and were a good deal surprised to see Modeste sitting beside\nthe Duc d'Herouville and coquetting with him like an accomplished\nParisian woman. She watched his play, gave him the advice he wanted, and\nfound occasion to say flattering things by ranking the merits of noble\nbirth with those of genius and beauty. Canalis thought he knew the\nreason of this change; he had tried to pique Modeste by calling marriage\na catastrophe, and showing that he was aloof from it; but like others\nwho play with fire, he had burned his fingers. Modeste's pride and her\npresent disdain frightened him, and he endeavored to recover his ground,\nexhibiting a jealousy which was all the more visible because it was\nartificial. Modeste, implacable as an angel, tasted the sweets of power,\nand, naturally enough, abused it. The Duc d'Herouville had never known\nsuch a happy evening; a woman smiled on him! At eleven o'clock, an\nunheard-of hour at the Chalet, the three suitors took their leave,--the\nduke thinking Modeste charming, Canalis believing her excessively\ncoquettish, and La Briere heart-broken by her cruelty.\n\nFor eight days the heiress continued to be to her three lovers very\nmuch what she had been during that evening; so that the poet appeared\nto carry the day against his rivals, in spite of certain freaks and\ncaprices which from time to time gave the Duc d'Herouville a little\nhope. The disrespect she showed to her father, and the great liberties\nshe took with him; her impatience with her blind mother, to whom she\nseemed to grudge the little services which had once been the delight\nof her filial piety,--seemed the result of a capricious nature and a\nheedless gaiety indulged from childhood. When Modeste went too far, she\nturned round and openly took herself to task, ascribing her impertinence\nand levity to a spirit of independence. She acknowledged to the duke\nand Canalis her distaste for obedience, and professed to regard it as an\nobstacle to her marriage; thus investigating the nature of her suitors,\nafter the manner of those who dig into the earth in search of metals,\ncoal, tufa, or water.\n\n\"I shall never,\" she said, the evening before the day on which the\nfamily were to move into the villa, \"find a husband who will put up with\nmy caprices as my father does; his kindness never flags. I am sure no\none will ever be as indulgent to me as my precious mother.\"\n\n\"They know that you love them, mademoiselle,\" said La Briere.\n\n\"You may be very sure, mademoiselle, that your husband will know the\nfull value of his treasure,\" added the duke.\n\n\"You have spirit and resolution enough to discipline a husband,\" cried\nCanalis, laughing.\n\nModeste smiled as Henri IV. must have smiled after drawing out the\ncharacters of his three principal ministers, for the benefit of a\nforeign ambassador, by means of three answers to an insidious question.\n\nOn the day of the dinner, Modeste, led away by the preference she\nbestowed on Canalis, walked alone with him up and down the gravelled\nspace which lay between the house and the lawn with its flower-beds.\nFrom the gestures of the poet, and the air and manner of the young\nheiress, it was easy to see that she was listening favorably to him.\nThe two demoiselles d'Herouville hastened to interrupt the scandalous\ntete-a-tete; and with the natural cleverness of women under such\ncircumstances, they turned the conversation on the court, and the\ndistinction of an appointment under the crown,--pointing out the\ndifference that existed between appointments in the household of the\nking and those of the crown. They tried to intoxicate Modeste's mind by\nappealing to her pride, and describing one of the highest stations to\nwhich a woman could aspire.\n\n\"To have a duke for a son,\" said the elder lady, \"is an actual\nadvantage. The title is a fortune that we secure to our children without\nthe possibility of loss.\"\n\n\"How is it, then,\" said Canalis, displeased at his tete-a-tete being\nthus broken in upon, \"that Monsieur le duc has had so little success in\na matter where his title would seem to be of special service to him?\"\n\nThe two ladies cast a look at Canalis as full of venom as the tooth of a\nsnake, and they were so disconcerted by Modeste's amused smile that they\nwere actually unable to reply.\n\n\"Monsieur le duc has never blamed you,\" she said to Canalis, \"for the\nhumility with which you bear your fame; why should you attack him for\nhis modesty?\"\n\n\"Besides, we have never yet met a woman worthy of my nephew's rank,\"\nsaid Mademoiselle d'Herouville. \"Some had only the wealth of the\nposition; others, without fortune, had the wit and birth. I must admit\nthat we have done well to wait till God granted us an opportunity to\nmeet one in whom we find the noble blood, the mind, and fortune of a\nDuchesse d'Herouville.\"\n\n\"My dear Modeste,\" said Helene d'Herouville, leading her new friend\napart, \"there are a thousand barons in the kingdom, just as there are a\nhundred poets in Paris, who are worth as much as he; he is so little of\na great man that even I, a poor girl forced to take the veil for want\nof a 'dot,' I would not take him. You don't know what a young man is who\nhas been for ten years in the hands of a Duchesse de Chaulieu. None but\nan old woman of sixty could put up with the little ailments of which,\nthey say, the great poet is always complaining,--a habit in Louis XIV.\nthat became a perfectly insupportable annoyance. It is true the duchess\ndoes not suffer from it as much as a wife, who would have him always\nabout her.\"\n\nThen, practising a well-known manoeuvre peculiar to her sex, Helene\nd'Herouville repeated in a low voice all the calumnies which women\njealous of the Duchesse de Chaulieu were in the habit of spreading about\nthe poet. This little incident, common as it is in the intercourse of\nwomen, will serve to show with what fury the hounds were after Modeste's\nwealth.\n\nTen days saw a great change in the opinions at the Chalet as to the\nthree suitors for Mademoiselle de La Bastie's hand. This change,\nwhich was much to the disadvantage of Canalis, came about through\nconsiderations of a nature which ought to make the holders of any kind\nof fame pause, and reflect. No one can deny, if we remember the passion\nwith which people seek for autographs, that public curiosity is greatly\nexcited by celebrity. Evidently most provincials never form an exact\nidea in their own minds of how illustrious Parisians put on their\ncravats, walk on the boulevards, stand gaping at nothing, or eat\na cutlet; because, no sooner do they perceive a man clothed in the\nsunbeams of fashion or resplendent with some dignity that is more or\nless fugitive (though always envied), than they cry out, \"Look at\nthat!\" \"How queer!\" and other depreciatory exclamations. In a word, the\nmysterious charm that attaches to every kind of fame, even that which\nis most justly due, never lasts. It is, and especially with superficial\npeople who are envious or sarcastic, a sensation which passes off with\nthe rapidity of lightning, and never returns. It would seem as though\nfame, like the sun, hot and luminous at a distance, is cold as the\nsummit of an alp when you approach it. Perhaps man is only really great\nto his peers; perhaps the defects inherent in his constitution disappear\nsooner to the eyes of his equals than to those of vulgar admirers. A\npoet, if he would please in ordinary life, must put on the fictitious\ngraces of those who are able to make their insignificances forgotten\nby charming manners and complying speeches. The poet of the faubourg\nSaint-Germain, who did not choose to bow before this social dictum, was\nmade before long to feel that an insulting provincial indifference\nhad succeeded to the dazed fascination of the earlier evenings. The\nprodigality of his wit and wisdom had produced upon these worthy souls\nsomewhat the effect which a shopful of glass-ware produces on the eye;\nin other words, the fire and brilliancy of Canalis's eloquence soon\nwearied people who, to use their own words, \"cared more for the solid.\"\n\nForced after a while to behave like an ordinary man, the poet found an\nunexpected stumbling-block on ground where La Briere had already won the\nsuffrage of the worthy people who at first had thought him sulky. They\nfelt the need of compensating themselves for Canalis's reputation by\npreferring his friend. The best of men are influenced by such feelings\nas these. The simple and straightforward young fellow jarred no one's\nself-love; coming to know him better they discovered his heart, his\nmodesty, his silent and sure discretion, and his excellent bearing.\nThe Duc d'Herouville considered him, as a political element, far above\nCanalis. The poet, ill-balanced, ambitious, and restless as Tasso,\nloved luxury, grandeur, and ran into debt; while the young lawyer,\nwhose character was equable and well-balanced, lived soberly, was useful\nwithout proclaiming it, awaited rewards without begging for them, and\nlaid by his money.\n\nCanalis had moreover laid himself open in a special way to the bourgeois\neyes that were watching him. For two or three days he had shown signs\nof impatience; he had given way to depression, to states of melancholy\nwithout apparent reason, to those capricious changes of temper which\nare the natural results of the nervous temperament of poets. These\noriginalities (we use the provincial word) came from the uneasiness\nthat his conduct toward the Duchesse de Chaulieu which grew daily less\nexplainable, caused him. He knew he ought to write to her, but could not\nresolve on doing so. All these fluctuations were carefully remarked\nand commented on by the gentle American, and the excellent Madame\nLatournelle, and they formed the topic of many a discussion between\nthese two ladies and Madame Mignon. Canalis felt the effects of these\ndiscussions without being able to explain them. The attention paid\nto him was not the same, the faces surrounding him no longer wore the\nentranced look of the earlier days; while at the same time Ernest was\nevidently gaining ground.\n\nFor the last two days the poet had endeavored to fascinate Modeste only,\nand he took advantage of every moment when he found himself alone with\nher, to weave the web of passionate language around his love. Modeste's\nblush, as she listened to him on the occasion we have just mentioned,\nshowed the demoiselles d'Herouville the pleasure with which she was\nlistening to sweet conceits that were sweetly said; and they, horribly\nuneasy at the sight, had immediate recourse to the \"ultima ratio\" of\nwomen in such cases, namely, those calumnies which seldom miss their\nobject. Accordingly, when the party met at the dinner-table the poet\nsaw a cloud on the brow of his idol; he knew that Mademoiselle\nd'Herouville's malignity allowed him to lose no time, and he resolved\nto offer himself as a husband at the first moment when he could find\nhimself alone with Modeste.\n\nOverhearing a few acid though polite remarks exchanged between the poet\nand the two noble ladies, Gobenheim nudged Butscha with his elbow,\nand said in an undertone, motioning towards the poet and the grand\nequerry,--\n\n\"They'll demolish one another!\"\n\n\"Canalis has genius enough to demolish himself all alone,\" answered the\ndwarf.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. A RIDDLE GUESSED\n\nDuring the dinner, which was magnificent and admirably well served, the\nduke obtained a signal advantage over Canalis. Modeste, who had received\nher habit and other equestrian equipments the night before, spoke of\ntaking rides about the country. A turn of the conversation led her to\nexpress the wish to see a hunt with hounds, a pleasure she had never yet\nenjoyed. The duke at once proposed to arrange a hunt in one of the crown\nforests, which lay a few leagues from Havre. Thanks to his intimacy\nwith the Prince de Cadignan, Master of the Hunt, he saw his chance of\ndisplaying an almost regal pomp before Modeste's eyes, and alluring her\nwith a glimpse of court fascinations, to which she could be introduced\nby marriage. Glances were exchanged between the duke and the two\ndemoiselles d'Herouville, which plainly said, \"The heiress is ours!\"\nand the poet, who detected them, and who had nothing but his personal\nsplendors to depend on, determined all the more firmly to obtain some\npledge of affection at once. Modeste, on the other hand, half-frightened\nat being thus pushed beyond her intentions by the d'Herouvilles, walked\nrather markedly apart with Melchior, when the company adjourned to the\npark after dinner. With the pardonable curiosity of a young girl, she\nlet him suspect the calumnies which Helene had poured into her ears; but\non Canalis's exclamation of anger, she begged him to keep silence about\nthem, which he promised.\n\n\"These stabs of the tongue,\" he said, \"are considered fair in the great\nworld. They shock your upright nature; but as for me, I laugh at them; I\nam even pleased. These ladies must feel that the duke's interests are in\ngreat peril, when they have recourse to such warfare.\"\n\nMaking the most of the advantage Modeste had thus given him, Canalis\nentered upon his defence with such warmth, such eagerness, and with a\npassion so exquisitely expressed, as he thanked her for a confidence in\nwhich he could venture to see the dawn of love, that she found herself\nsuddenly as much compromised with the poet as she feared to be with the\ngrand equerry. Canalis, feeling the necessity of prompt action, declared\nhimself plainly. He uttered vows and protestations in which his poetry\nshone like a moon, invoked for the occasion, and illuminating his\nallusions to the beauty of his mistress and the charms of her evening\ndress. This counterfeit enthusiasm, in which the night, the foliage,\nthe heavens and the earth, and Nature herself played a part, carried the\neager lover beyond all bounds; for he dwelt on his disinterestedness,\nand revamped in his own charming style, Diderot's famous apostrophe\nto \"Sophie and fifteen hundred francs!\" and the well-worn \"love in\na cottage\" of every lover who knows perfectly well the length of the\nfather-in-law's purse.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Modeste, after listening with delight to the melody of\nthis concerto; \"the freedom granted to me by my parents has allowed me\nto listen to you; but it is to them that you must address yourself.\"\n\n\"But,\" exclaimed Canalis, \"tell me that if I obtain their consent, you\nwill ask nothing better than to obey them.\"\n\n\"I know beforehand,\" she replied, \"that my father has certain fancies\nwhich may wound the proper pride of an old family like yours. He wishes\nto have his own title and name borne by his grandsons.\"\n\n\"Ah! dear Modeste, what sacrifices would I not make to commit my life to\nthe guardian care of an angel like you.\"\n\n\"You will permit me not to decide in a moment the fate of my whole\nlife,\" she said, turning to rejoin the demoiselles d'Herouville.\n\nThose noble ladies were just then engaged in flattering the vanity\nof little Latournelle, intending to win him over to their interests.\nMademoiselle d'Herouville, to whom we shall in future confine the family\nname, to distinguish her from her niece Helene, was giving the notary to\nunderstand that the post of judge of the Supreme Court in Havre, which\nCharles X. would bestow as she desired, was an office worthy of his\nlegal talent and his well-known probity. Butscha, meanwhile, who had\nbeen walking about with La Briere, was greatly alarmed at the progress\nCanalis was evidently making, and he waylaid Modeste at the lower step\nof the portico when the whole party returned to the house to endure the\ntorments of their inevitable whist.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" he said, in a low whisper, \"I do hope you don't call him\nMelchior.\"\n\n\"I'm very near it, my Black Dwarf,\" she said, with a smile that might\nhave made an angel swear.\n\n\"Good God!\" exclaimed Butscha, letting fall his hands, which struck the\nmarble steps.\n\n\"Well! and isn't he worth more than that spiteful and gloomy secretary\nin whom you take such an interest?\" she retorted, assuming, at the mere\nthought of Ernest, the haughty manner whose secret belongs exclusively\nto young girls,--as if their virginity lent them wings to fly to heaven.\n\"Pray, would your little La Briere accept me without a fortune?\" she\nsaid, after a pause.\n\n\"Ask your father,\" replied Butscha, who walked a few steps from the\nhouse, to get Modeste at a safe distance from the windows. \"Listen to\nme, mademoiselle. You know that he who speaks to you is ready to give\nnot only his life but his honor for you, at any moment, and at all\ntimes. Therefore you may believe in him; you can confide to him that\nwhich you may not, perhaps, be willing to say to your father. Tell me,\nhas that sublime Canalis been making you the disinterested offer that\nyou now fling as a reproach at poor Ernest?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do you believe it?\"\n\n\"That question, my manikin,\" she replied, giving him one of the ten or\na dozen nicknames she had invented for him, \"strikes me as undervaluing\nthe strength of my self-love.\"\n\n\"Ah, you are laughing, my dear Mademoiselle Modeste; then there's no\ndanger: I hope you are only making a fool of him.\"\n\n\"Pray what would you think of me, Monsieur Butscha, if I allowed myself\nto make fun of those who do me the honor to wish to marry me? You ought\nto know, master Jean, that even if a girl affects to despise the most\ndespicable attentions, she is flattered by them.\"\n\n\"Then I flatter you?\" said the young man, looking up at her with a face\nthat was illuminated like a city for a festival.\n\n\"You?\" she said; \"you give me the most precious of all friendships,--a\nfeeling as disinterested as that of a mother for her child. Compare\nyourself to no one; for even my father is obliged to be devoted to me.\"\nShe paused. \"I cannot say that I love you, in the sense which men give\nto that word, but what I do give you is eternal and can know no change.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Butscha, stooping to pick up a pebble that he might kiss\nthe hem of her garment, \"suffer me to watch over you as a dragon guards\na treasure. The poet was covering you just now with the lace-work of his\nprecious phrases, the tinsel of his promises; he chanted his love on the\nbest strings of his lyre, I know he did. If, as soon as this noble lover\nfinds out how small your fortune is, he makes a sudden change in his\nbehavior, and is cold and embarrassed, will you still marry him? shall\nyou still esteem him?\"\n\n\"He would be another Francisque Althor,\" she said, with a gesture of\nbitter disgust.\n\n\"Let me have the pleasure of producing that change of scene,\" said\nButscha. \"Not only shall it be sudden, but I believe I can change it\nback and make your poet as loving as before,--nay, it is possible\nto make him blow alternately hot and cold upon your heart, just as\ngracefully as he has talked on both sides of an argument in one evening\nwithout ever finding it out.\"\n\n\"If you are right,\" she said, \"who can be trusted?\"\n\n\"One who truly loves you.\"\n\n\"The little duke?\"\n\nButscha looked at Modeste. The pair walked some distance in silence; the\ngirl was impenetrable and not an eyelash quivered.\n\n\"Mademoiselle, permit me to be the exponent of the thoughts that are\nlying at the bottom of your heart like sea-mosses under the waves, and\nwhich you do not choose to gather up.\"\n\n\"Eh!\" said Modeste, \"so my intimate friend and counsellor thinks himself\na mirror, does he?\"\n\n\"No, an echo,\" he answered, with a gesture of sublime humility.\n\"The duke loves you, but he loves you too much. If I, a dwarf, have\nunderstood the infinite delicacy of your heart, it would be repugnant\nto you to be worshipped like a saint in her shrine. You are eminently a\nwoman; you neither want a man perpetually at your feet of whom you\nare eternally sure, nor a selfish egoist like Canalis, who will always\nprefer himself to you. Why? ah, that I don't know. But I will make\nmyself a woman, an old woman, and find out the meaning of the plan which\nI have read in your eyes, and which perhaps is in the heart of every\ngirl. Nevertheless, in your great soul you feel the need of worshipping.\nWhen a man is at your knees, you cannot put yourself at his. You can't\nadvance in that way, as Voltaire might say. The little duke has too many\ngenuflections in his moral being and the poet has too few,--indeed, I\nmight say, none at all. Ha, I have guessed the mischief in your smiles\nwhen you talk to the grand equerry, and when he talks to you and you\nanswer him. You would never be unhappy with the duke, and everybody will\napprove your choice, if you do choose him; but you will never love\nhim. The ice of egotism, and the burning heat of ecstasy both produce\nindifference in the heart of every woman. It is evident to my mind that\nno such perpetual worship will give you the infinite delights which you\nare dreaming of in marriage,--in some marriage where obedience will be\nyour pride, where noble little sacrifices can be made and hidden,\nwhere the heart is full of anxieties without a cause, and successes are\nawaited with eager hope, where each new chance for magnanimity is hailed\nwith joy, where souls are comprehended to their inmost recesses, and\nwhere the woman protects with her love the man who protects her.\"\n\n\"You are a sorcerer!\" exclaimed Modeste.\n\n\"Neither will you find that sweet equality of feeling, that continual\nsharing of each other's life, that certainty of pleasing which makes\nmarriage tolerable, if you take Canalis,--a man who thinks of himself\nonly, whose 'I' is the one string to his lute, whose mind is so fixed\non himself that he has hitherto taken no notice of your father or the\nduke,--a man of second-rate ambitions, to whom your dignity and your\ndevotion will matter nothing, who will make you a mere appendage to\nhis household, and who already insults you by his indifference to your\nbehavior; yes, if you permitted yourself to go so far as to box your\nmother's ears Canalis would shut his eyes to it, and deny your\ncrime even to himself, because he thirsts for your money. And so,\nmademoiselle, when I spoke of the man who truly loves you I was not\nthinking of the great poet who is nothing but a little comedian, nor of\nthe duke, who might be a good marriage for you, but never a husband--\"\n\n\"Butscha, my heart is a blank page on which you are yourself writing all\nthat you read there,\" cried Modeste, interrupting him. \"You are carried\naway by your provincial hatred for everything that obliges you to\nlook higher than your own head. You can't forgive a poet for being a\nstatesman, for possessing the gift of speech, for having a noble future\nbefore him,--and you calumniate his intentions.\"\n\n\"His!--mademoiselle, he will turn his back upon you with the baseness of\nan Althor.\"\n\n\"Make him play that pretty little comedy, and--\"\n\n\"That I will! he shall play it through and through within three\ndays,--on Wednesday,--recollect, Wednesday! Until then, mademoiselle,\namuse yourself by listening to the little tunes of the lyre, so that the\ndiscords and the false notes may come out all the more distinctly.\"\n\nModeste ran gaily back to the salon, where La Briere, who was sitting by\nthe window, where he had doubtless been watching his idol, rose to his\nfeet as if a groom of the chambers had suddenly announced, \"The Queen.\"\nIt was a movement of spontaneous respect, full of that living eloquence\nthat lies in gesture even more than in speech. Spoken love cannot\ncompare with acts of love; and every young girl of twenty has the\nwisdom of fifty in applying the axiom. In it lies the great secret of\nattraction. Instead of looking Modeste in the face, as Canalis who paid\nher public homage would have done, the neglected lover followed her with\na furtive look between his eyelids, humble after the manner of Butscha,\nand almost timid. The young heiress observed it, as she took her place\nby Canalis, to whose game she proceeded to pay attention. During a\nconversation which ensued, La Briere heard Modeste say to her father\nthat she should ride out for the first time on the following Wednesday;\nand she also reminded him that she had no whip in keeping with her new\nequipments. The young man flung a lightning glance at the dwarf, and a\nfew minutes later the two were pacing the terrace.\n\n\"It is nine o'clock,\" cried Ernest. \"I shall start for Paris at full\ngallop; I can get there to-morrow morning by ten. My dear Butscha, from\nyou she will accept anything, for she is attached to you; let me give\nher a riding-whip in your name. If you will do me this immense kindness,\nyou shall have not only my friendship but my devotion.\"\n\n\"Ah, you are very happy,\" said Butscha, ruefully; \"you have money, you!\"\n\n\"Tell Canalis not to expect me, and that he must find some pretext to\naccount for my absence.\"\n\nAn hour later Ernest had ridden out of Havre. He reached Paris in twelve\nhours, where his first act was to secure a place in the mail-coach\nfor Havre on the following evening. Then he went to three of the chief\njewellers in Paris and compared all the whip-handles that they could\noffer; he was in search of some artistic treasure that was regally\nsuperb. He found one at last, made by Stidmann for a Russian, who was\nunable to pay for it when finished,--a fox-head in gold, with a ruby of\nexorbitant value; all his savings went into the purchase, the cost of\nwhich was seven thousand francs. Ernest gave a drawing of the arms of\nLa Bastie, and allowed the shop-people twenty hours to engrave them.\nThe handle, a masterpiece of delicate workmanship, was fitted to an\nindia-rubber whip and put into a morocco case lined with velvet, on\nwhich two M.'s interlaced were stamped in gold.\n\nLa Briere got back to Havre by the mail-coach Wednesday morning in\ntime to breakfast with Canalis. The poet had concealed his secretary's\nabsence by declaring that he was busy with some work sent from Paris.\nButscha, who met La Briere at the coach-door, took the box containing\nthe precious work of art to Francoise Cochet, with instructions to place\nit on Modeste's dressing-table.\n\n\"Of course you will accompany Mademoiselle Modeste on her ride to-day?\"\nsaid Butscha, who went to Canalis's house to let La Briere know by a\nwink that the whip had gone to its destination.\n\n\"I?\" answered Ernest; \"no, I am going to bed.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" exclaimed Canalis, looking at him. \"I don't know what to make of\nyou.\"\n\nBreakfast was then served, and the poet naturally invited their visitor\nto stay and take it. Butscha complied, having seen in the expression of\nthe valet's face the success of a trick in which we shall see the first\nfruits of his promise to Modeste.\n\n\"Monsieur is very right to detain the clerk of Monsieur Latournelle,\"\nwhispered Germain in his master's ear.\n\nCanalis and Germain went into the salon on a sign that passed between\nthem.\n\n\"I went out this morning to see the men fish, monsieur,\" said the\nvalet,--\"an excursion proposed to me by the captain of a smack, whose\nacquaintance I have made.\"\n\nGermain did not acknowledge that he had the bad taste to play billiards\nin a cafe,--a fact of which Butscha had taken advantage to surround him\nwith friends of his own and manage him as he pleased.\n\n\"Well?\" said Canalis, \"to the point,--quick!\"\n\n\"Monsieur le baron, I heard a conversation about Monsieur Mignon, which\nI encouraged as far as I could; for no one, of course, knew that I\nbelong to you. Ah! monsieur, judging by the talk of the quays, you are\nrunning your head into a noose. The fortune of Mademoiselle de La Bastie\nis, like her name, modest. The vessel on which the father returned does\nnot belong to him, but to rich China merchants to whom he renders an\naccount. They even say things that are not at all flattering to Monsieur\nMignon's honor. Having heard that you and Monsieur le duc were rivals\nfor Mademoiselle de La Bastie's hand, I have taken the liberty to warn\nyou; of the two, wouldn't it be better that his lordship should gobble\nher? As I came home I walked round the quays, and into that theatre-hall\nwhere the merchants meet; I slipped boldly in and out among them. Seeing\na well-dressed stranger, those worthy fellows began to talk to me of\nHavre, and I got them, little by little, to speak of Colonel Mignon.\nWhat they said only confirms the stories the fishermen told me; and I\nfeel that I should fail in my duty if I keep silence. That is why I did\nnot get home in time to dress monsieur this morning.\"\n\n\"What am I to do?\" cried Canalis, who remembered his proposals to\nModeste the night before, and did not see how he could get out of them.\n\n\"Monsieur knows my attachment to him,\" said Germain, perceiving that the\npoet was quite thrown off his balance; \"he will not be surprised if I\ngive him a word of advice. There is that clerk; try to get the truth out\nof him. Perhaps he'll unbutton after a bottle or two of champagne, or at\nany rate a third. It would be strange indeed if monsieur, who will one\nday be ambassador, as Philoxene has heard Madame la duchesse say time\nand time again, couldn't turn a little notary's clerk inside out.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. BUTSCHA DISTINGUISHES HIMSELF\n\nAt this instant Butscha, the hidden prompter of the fishing part, was\nrequesting the secretary to say nothing about his trip to Paris, and not\nto interfere in any way with what he, Butscha, might do. The dwarf\nhad already made use of an unfavorable feeling lately roused against\nMonsieur Mignon in Havre in consequence of his reserve and his\ndetermination to keep silence as to the amount of his fortune. The\npersons who were most bitter against him even declared calumniously that\nhe had made over a large amount of property to Dumay to save it from the\njust demands of his associates in China. Butscha took advantage of this\nstate of feeling. He asked the fishermen, who owed him many a good turn,\nto keep the secret and lend him their tongues. They served him well.\nThe captain of the fishing-smack told Germain that one of his cousins,\na sailor, had just returned from Marseilles, where he had been paid off\nfrom the brig in which Monsieur Mignon returned to France. The brig had\nbeen sold to the account of some other person than Monsieur Mignon, and\nthe cargo was only worth three or four hundred thousand francs at the\nutmost.\n\n\"Germain,\" said Canalis, as the valet was leaving the room, \"serve\nchampagne and claret. A member of the legal fraternity of Havre must\ncarry away with him proper ideas of a poet's hospitality. Besides, he\nhas got a wit that is equal to Figaro's,\" added Canalis, laying his\nhand on the dwarf's shoulder, \"and we must make it foam and sparkle with\nchampagne; you and I, Ernest, will not spare the bottle either. Faith,\nit is over two years since I've been drunk,\" he added, looking at La\nBriere.\n\n\"Not drunk with wine, you mean,\" said Butscha, looking keenly at him,\n\"yes, I can believe that. You get drunk every day on yourself, you drink\nin so much praise. Ha, you are handsome, you are a poet, you are famous\nin your lifetime, you have the gift of an eloquence that is equal to\nyour genius, and you please all women,--even my master's wife. Admired\nby the finest sultana-valide that I ever saw in my life (and I never\nsaw but her) you can, if you choose, marry Mademoiselle de La Bastie.\nGoodness! the mere inventory of your present advantages, not to speak\nof the future (a noble title, peerage, embassy!), is enough to make me\ndrunk already,--like the men who bottle other men's wine.\"\n\n\"All such social distinctions,\" said Canalis, \"are of little use without\nthe one thing that gives them value,--wealth. Here we can talk as men\nwith men; fine sentiments only do in verse.\"\n\n\"That depends on circumstances,\" said the dwarf, with a knowing gesture.\n\n\"Ah! you writer of conveyances,\" said the poet, smiling at the\ninterruption, \"you know as well as I do that 'cottage' rhymes with\n'pottage,'--and who would like to live on that for the rest of his\ndays?\"\n\nAt table Butscha played the part of Trigaudin, in the \"Maison en\nloterie,\" in a way that alarmed Ernest, who did not know the waggery of\na lawyer's office, which is quite equal to that of an atelier. Butscha\npoured forth the scandalous gossip of Havre, the private history of\nfortune and boudoirs, and the crimes committed code in hand, which are\ncalled in Normandy, \"getting out of a thing as best you can.\" He spared\nno one; and his liveliness increased with the torrents of wine which\npoured down his throat like rain through a gutter.\n\n\"Do you know, La Briere,\" said Canalis, filling Butscha's glass, \"that\nthis fellow would make a capital secretary to the embassy?\"\n\n\"And oust his chief!\" cried the dwarf flinging a look at Canalis whose\ninsolence was lost in the gurgling of carbonic acid gas. \"I've little\nenough gratitude and quite enough scheming to get astride of your\nshoulders. Ha, ha, a poet carrying a hunchback! that's been seen, often\nseen--on book-shelves. Come, don't look at me as if I were swallowing\nswords. My dear great genius, you're a superior man; you know that\ngratitude is the word of fools; they stick it in the dictionary, but it\nisn't in the human heart; pledges are worth nothing, except on a certain\nmount that is neither Pindus nor Parnassus. You think I owe a great deal\nto my master's wife, who brought me up. Bless you, the whole town has\npaid her for that in praises, respect, and admiration,--the very best\nof coin. I don't recognize any service that is only the capital of\nself-love. Men make a commerce of their services, and gratitude\ngoes down on the debit side,--that's all. As to schemes, they are my\ndivinity. What?\" he exclaimed, at a gesture of Canalis, \"don't you\nadmire the faculty which enables a wily man to get the better of a\nman of genius? it takes the closest observation of his vices, and his\nweaknesses, and the wit to seize the happy moment. Ask diplomacy if\nits greatest triumphs are not those of craft over force? If I were your\nsecretary, Monsieur le baron, you'd soon be prime-minister, because\nit would be my interest to have you so. Do you want a specimen of my\ntalents in that line? Well then, listen; you love Mademoiselle Modeste\ndistractedly, and you've good reason to do so. The girl has my fullest\nesteem; she is a true Parisian. Sometimes we get a few real Parisians\nborn down here in the provinces. Well, Modeste is just the woman to help\na man's career. She's got _that_ in her,\" he cried, with a turn of his\nwrist in the air. \"But you've a dangerous competitor in the duke; what\nwill you give me to get him out of Havre within three days?\"\n\n\"Finish this bottle,\" said the poet, refilling Butscha's glass.\n\n\"You'll make me drunk,\" said the dwarf, tossing off his ninth glass of\nchampagne. \"Have you a bed where I could sleep it off? My master is\nas sober as the camel that he is, and Madame Latournelle too. They are\nbrutal enough, both of them, to scold me; and they'd have the rights of\nit too--there are those deeds I ought to be drawing!--\" Then, suddenly\nreturning to his previous ideas, after the fashion of a drunken man, he\nexclaimed, \"and I've such a memory; it is on a par with my gratitude.\"\n\n\"Butscha!\" cried the poet, \"you said just now you had no gratitude; you\ncontradict yourself.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" he replied. \"To forget a thing means almost always\nrecollecting it. Come, come, do you want me to get rid of the duke? I'm\ncut out for a secretary.\"\n\n\"How could you manage it?\" said Canalis, delighted to find the\nconversation taking this turn of its own accord.\n\n\"That's none of your business,\" said the dwarf, with a portentous\nhiccough.\n\nButscha's head rolled between his shoulders, and his eyes turned from\nGermain to La Briere, and from La Briere to Canalis, after the manner of\nmen who, knowing they are tipsy, wish to see what other men are thinking\nof them; for in the shipwreck of drunkenness it is noticeable that\nself-love is the last thing that goes to the bottom.\n\n\"Ha! my great poet, you're a pretty good trickster yourself; but you\nare not deep enough. What do you mean by taking me for one of your own\nreaders,--you who sent your friend to Paris, full gallop, to inquire\ninto the property of the Mignon family? Ha, ha! I hoax, thou hoaxest, we\nhoax--Good! But do me the honor to believe that I'm deep enough to keep\nthe secrets of my own business. As the head-clerk of a notary, my heart\nis a locked box, padlocked! My mouth never opens to let out anything\nabout a client. I know all, and I know nothing. Besides, my passion is\nwell known. I love Modeste; she is my pupil, and she must make a good\nmarriage. I'll fool the duke, if need be; and you shall marry--\"\n\n\"Germain, coffee and liqueurs,\" said Canalis.\n\n\"Liqueurs!\" repeated Butscha with a wave of his hand, and the air of a\nsham virgin repelling seduction; \"Ah, those poor deeds! one of 'em was a\nmarriage contract; and that second clerk of mine is as stupid as--as--an\nepithalamium, and he's capable of digging his penknife right through the\nbride's paraphernalia; he thinks he's a handsome man because he's five\nfeet six,--idiot!\"\n\n\"Here is some creme de the, a liqueur of the West Indies,\" said Canalis.\n\"You, whom Mademoiselle Modeste consults--\"\n\n\"Yes, she consults me.\"\n\n\"Well, do you think she loves me?\" asked the poet.\n\n\"Loves you? yes, more than she loves the duke,\" answered the dwarf,\nrousing himself from a stupor which was admirably played. \"She loves\nyou for your disinterestedness. She told me she was ready to make the\ngreatest sacrifices for your sake; to give up dress and spend as little\nas possible on herself, and devote her life to showing you that in\nmarrying her you hadn't done so\" (hiccough) \"bad a thing for yourself.\nShe's as right as a trivet,--yes, and well informed. She knows\neverything, that girl.\"\n\n\"And she has three hundred thousand francs?\"\n\n\"There may be quite as much as that,\" cried the dwarf, enthusiastically.\n\"Papa Mignon,--mignon by name, mignon by nature, and that's why I\nrespect him,--well, he would rob himself of everything to marry his\ndaughter. Your Restoration\" (hiccough) \"has taught him how to live on\nhalf-pay; he'd be quite content to live with Dumay on next to nothing,\nif he could rake and scrape enough together to give the little one three\nhundred thousand francs. But don't let's forget that Dumay is going to\nleave all his money to Modeste. Dumay, you know, is a Breton, and\nthat fact clinches the matter; he won't go back from his word, and\nhis fortune is equal to the colonel's. But I don't approve of Monsieur\nMignon's taking back that villa, and, as they often ask my advice, I\ntold them so. 'You sink too much in it,' I said; 'if Vilquin does not\nbuy it back there's two hundred thousand francs which won't bring you a\npenny; it only leaves you a hundred thousand to get along with, and it\nisn't enough.' The colonel and Dumay are consulting about it now. But\nnevertheless, between you and me, Modeste is sure to be rich. I hear\ntalk on the quays against it; but that's all nonsense; people are\njealous. Why, there's no such 'dot' in Havre,\" cried Butscha, beginning\nto count on his fingers. \"Two to three hundred thousand in ready money,\"\nbending back the thumb of his left hand with the forefinger of his\nright, \"that's one item; the reversion of the villa Mignon, that's\nanother; 'tertio,' Dumay's property!\" doubling down his middle finger.\n\"Ha! little Modeste may count upon her six hundred thousand francs\nas soon as the two old soldiers have got their marching orders for\neternity.\"\n\nThis coarse and candid statement, intermingled with a variety of\nliqueurs, sobered Canalis as much as it appeared to befuddle Butscha.\nTo the latter, a young provincial, such a fortune must of course seem\ncolossal. He let his head fall into the palm of his right hand, and\nputting his elbows majestically on the table, blinked his eyes and\ncontinued talking to himself:--\n\n\"In twenty years, thanks to that Code, which pillages fortunes under\nwhat they call 'Successions,' an heiress worth a million will be as rare\nas generosity in a money-lender. Suppose Modeste does want to spend all\nthe interest of her own money,--well, she is so pretty, so sweet and\npretty; why she's--you poets are always after metaphors--she's a weasel\nas tricky as a monkey.\"\n\n\"How came you to tell me she had six millions?\" said Canalis to La\nBriere, in a low voice.\n\n\"My friend,\" said Ernest, \"I do assure you that I was bound to silence\nby an oath; perhaps, even now, I ought not to say as much as that.\"\n\n\"Bound! to whom?\"\n\n\"To Monsieur Mignon.\"\n\n\"Ernest! you who know how essential fortune is to me--\"\n\nButscha snored.\n\n\"--who know my situation, and all that I shall lose in the Duchesse de\nChaulieu, by this attempt at marrying, YOU could coldly let me plunge\ninto such a thing as this?\" exclaimed Canalis, turning pale. \"It was a\nquestion of friendship; and ours was a compact entered into long before\nyou ever saw that crafty Mignon.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said Ernest, \"I love Modeste too well to--\"\n\n\"Fool! then take her,\" cried the poet, \"and break your oath.\"\n\n\"Will you promise me on your word of honor to forget what I now tell\nyou, and to behave to me as though this confidence had never been made,\nwhatever happens?\"\n\n\"I'll swear that, by my mother's memory.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" said La Briere, \"Monsieur Mignon told me in Paris that he\nwas very far from having the colossal fortune which the Mongenods told\nme about and which I mentioned to you. The colonel intends to give two\nhundred thousand francs to his daughter. And now, Melchior, I ask you,\nwas the father really distrustful of us, as you thought; or was he\nsincere? It is not for me to answer those questions. If Modeste without\na fortune deigns to choose me, she will be my wife.\"\n\n\"A blue-stocking! educated till she is a terror! a girl who has read\neverything, who knows everything,--in theory,\" cried Canalis, hastily,\nnoticing La Briere's gesture, \"a spoiled child, brought up in luxury in\nher childhood, and weaned of it for five years. Ah! my poor friend, take\ncare what you are about.\"\n\n\"Ode and Code,\" said Butscha, waking up, \"you do the ode and I the code;\nthere's only a C's difference between us. Well, now, code comes from\n'coda,' a tail,--mark that word! See here! a bit of good advice is worth\nyour wine and your cream of tea. Father Mignon--he's cream, too; the\ncream of honest men--he is going with his daughter on this riding party;\ndo you go up frankly and talk 'dot' to him. He'll answer plainly, and\nyou'll get at the truth, just as surely as I'm drunk, and you're a great\npoet,--but no matter for that; we are to leave Havre together, that's\nsettled, isn't it? I'm to be your secretary in place of that little\nfellow who sits there grinning at me and thinking I'm drunk. Come, let's\ngo, and leave him to marry the girl.\"\n\nCanalis rose to leave the room to dress for the excursion.\n\n\"Hush, not a word,--he is going to commit suicide,\" whispered Butscha,\nsober as a judge, to La Briere as he made the gesture of a street boy\nat Canalis's back. \"Adieu, my chief!\" he shouted, in stentorian tones,\n\"will you allow me to take a snooze in that kiosk down in the garden?\"\n\n\"Make yourself at home,\" answered the poet.\n\nButscha, pursued by the laughter of the three servants of the\nestablishment, gained the kiosk by walking over the flower-beds and\nround the vases with the perverse grace of an insect describing its\ninterminable zig-zags as it tries to get out of a closed window. When he\nhad clambered into the kiosk, and the servants had retired, he sat down\non a wooden bench and wallowed in the delights of his triumph. He had\ncompletely fooled a great man; he had not only torn off his mask, but\nhe had made him untie the strings himself; and he laughed like an author\nover his own play,--that is to say, with a true sense of the immense\nvalue of his \"vis comica.\"\n\n\"Men are tops!\" he cried, \"you've only to find the twine to wind 'em\nup with. But I'm like my fellows,\" he added, presently. \"I should faint\naway if any one came and said to me 'Mademoiselle Modeste has been\nthrown from her horse, and has broken her leg.'\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV. THE POET FEELS THAT HE IS LOVED TOO WELL\n\nAn hour later, Modeste, charmingly equipped in a bottle-green cassimere\nhabit, a small hat with a green veil, buckskin gloves, and velvet boots\nwhich met the lace frills of her drawers, and mounted on an elegantly\ncaparisoned little horse, was exhibiting to her father and the Duc\nd'Herouville the beautiful present she had just received; she was\nevidently delighted with an attention of a kind that particularly\nflatters women.\n\n\"Did it come from you, Monsieur le duc?\" she said, holding the sparkling\nhandle toward him. \"There was a card with it, saying, 'Guess if you\ncan,' and some asterisks. Francoise and Dumay credit Butscha with this\ncharming surprise; but my dear Butscha is not rich enough to buy such\nrubies. And as for papa (to whom I said, as I remember, on Sunday\nevening, that I had no whip), he sent to Rouen for this one,\"--pointing\nto a whip in her father's hand, with a top like a cone of turquoise, a\nfashion then in vogue which has since become vulgar.\n\n\"I would give ten years of my old age, mademoiselle, to have the right\nto offer you that beautiful jewel,\" said the duke, courteously.\n\n\"Ah, here comes the audacious giver!\" cried Modeste, as Canalis rode\nup. \"It is only a poet who knows where to find such choice things.\nMonsieur,\" she said to Melchior, \"my father will scold you, and say that\nyou justify those who accuse you of extravagance.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Canalis, with apparent simplicity, \"so that is why La\nBriere rode at full gallop from Havre to Paris?\"\n\n\"Does your secretary take such liberties?\" said Modeste, turning pale,\nand throwing the whip to Francoise with an impetuosity that expressed\nscorn. \"Give me your whip, papa.\"\n\n\"Poor Ernest, who lies there on his bed half-dead with fatigue!\" said\nCanalis, overtaking the girl, who had already started at a gallop. \"You\nare pitiless, mademoiselle. 'I have' (the poor fellow said to me) 'only\nthis one chance to remain in her memory.'\"\n\n\"And should you think well of a woman who could take presents from half\nthe parish?\" said Modeste.\n\nShe was surprised to receive no answer to this inquiry, and attributed\nthe poet's inattention to the noise of the horse's feet.\n\n\"How you delight in tormenting those who love you,\" said the duke. \"Your\nnobility of soul and your pride are so inconsistent with your faults\nthat I begin to suspect you calumniate yourself, and do those naughty\nthings on purpose.\"\n\n\"Ah! have you only just found that out, Monsieur le duc?\" she exclaimed,\nlaughing. \"You have the sagacity of a husband.\"\n\nThey rode half a mile in silence. Modeste was a good deal astonished not\nto receive the fire of the poet's eyes. The evening before, as she was\npointing out to him an admirable effect of setting sunlight across the\nwater, she had said, remarking his inattention, \"Well, don't you see\nit?\"--to which he replied, \"I can see only your hand\"; but now his\nadmiration for the beauties of nature seemed a little too intense to be\nnatural.\n\n\"Does Monsieur de La Briere know how to ride?\" she asked, for the\npurpose of teasing him.\n\n\"Not very well, but he gets along,\" answered the poet, cold as Gobenheim\nbefore the colonel's return.\n\nAt a cross-road, which Monsieur Mignon made them take through a lovely\nvalley to reach a height overlooking the Seine, Canalis let Modeste and\nthe duke pass him, and then reined up to join the colonel.\n\n\"Monsieur le comte,\" he said, \"you are an open-hearted soldier, and\nI know you will regard my frankness as a title to your esteem. When\nproposals of marriage, with all their brutal,--or, if you please, too\ncivilized--discussions, are carried on by third parties, it is an injury\nto all. We are both gentlemen, and both discreet; and you, like myself,\nhave passed beyond the age of surprises. Let us therefore speak as\nintimates. I will set you the example. I am twenty-nine years old,\nwithout landed estates, and full of ambition. Mademoiselle Modeste,\nas you must have perceived, pleases me extremely. Now, in spite of the\nlittle defects which your dear girl likes to assume--\"\n\n\"--not counting those she really possesses,\" said the colonel,\nsmiling,--\n\n\"--I should gladly make her my wife, and I believe I could render her\nhappy. The question of money is of the utmost importance to my future,\nwhich hangs to-day in the balance. All young girls expect to be loved\n_whether or no_--fortune or no fortune. But you are not the man to marry\nyour dear Modeste without a 'dot,' and my situation does not allow me\nto make a marriage of what is called love unless with a woman who has\na fortune at least equal to mine. I have, from my emoluments and\nsinecures, from the Academy and from my works, about thirty thousand\nfrancs a year, a large income for a bachelor. If my wife brought me as\nmuch more, I should still be in about the same condition that I am now.\nShall you give Mademoiselle a million?\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur, we have not reached that point as yet,\" said the colonel,\nJesuitically.\n\n\"Then suppose,\" said Canalis, quickly, \"that we go no further; we will\nlet the matter drop. You shall have no cause to complain of me, Monsieur\nle comte; the world shall consider me among the unfortunate suitors of\nyour charming daughter. Give me your word of honor to say nothing on\nthe subject to any one, not even to Mademoiselle Modeste, because,\" he\nadded, throwing a word of promise to the ear, \"my circumstances may so\nchange that I can ask you for her without 'dot.'\"\n\n\"I promise you that,\" said the colonel. \"You know, monsieur, with what\nassurance the public, both in Paris and the provinces, talk of fortunes\nthat they make and unmake. People exaggerate both happiness and\nunhappiness; we are never so fortunate nor so unfortunate as people say\nwe are. There is nothing sure and certain in business except investments\nin land. I am awaiting the accounts of my agents with very great\nimpatience. The sale of my merchandise and my ship, and the settlement\nof my affairs in China, are not yet concluded; and I cannot know the\nfull amount of my fortune for at least six months. I did, however, say\nto Monsieur de La Briere in Paris that I would guarantee a 'dot' of two\nhundred thousand francs in ready money. I wish to entail my estates, and\nenable my grandchildren to inherit my arms and title.\"\n\nCanalis did not listen to this statement after the opening sentence.\nThe four riders, having now reached a wider road, went abreast and soon\nreached a stretch of table-land, from which the eye took in on one side\nthe rich valley of the Seine toward Rouen, and on the other an horizon\nbounded only by the sea.\n\n\"Butscha was right, God is the greatest of all landscape painters,\" said\nCanalis, contemplating the view, which is unique among the many fine\nscenes that have made the shores of the Seine so justly celebrated.\n\n\"Above all do we feel that, my dear baron,\" said the duke, \"on\nhunting-days, when nature has a voice, and a lively tumult breaks\nthe silence; at such times the landscape, changing rapidly as we ride\nthrough it, seems really sublime.\"\n\n\"The sun is the inexhaustible palette,\" said Modeste, looking at the\npoet in a species of bewilderment.\n\nA remark that she presently made on his absence of mind gave him\nan opportunity of saying that he was just then absorbed in his own\nthoughts,--an excuse that authors have more reason for giving than other\nmen.\n\n\"Are we really made happy by carrying our lives into the midst of\nthe world, and swelling them with all sorts of fictitious wants and\nover-excited vanities?\" said Modeste, moved by the aspect of the fertile\nand billowy country to long for a philosophically tranquil life.\n\n\"That is a bucolic, mademoiselle, which is only written on tablets of\ngold,\" said the poet.\n\n\"And sometimes under garret-roofs,\" remarked the colonel.\n\nModeste threw a piercing glance at Canalis, which he was unable to\nsustain; she was conscious of a ringing in her ears, darkness seemed to\nspread before her, and then she suddenly exclaimed in icy tones:--\n\n\"Ah! it is Wednesday!\"\n\n\"I do not say this to flatter your passing caprice, mademoiselle,\" said\nthe duke, to whom the little scene, so tragical for Modeste, had left\ntime for thought; \"but I declare I am so profoundly disgusted with the\nworld and the Court and Paris that had I a Duchesse d'Herouville, gifted\nwith the wit and graces of mademoiselle, I would gladly bind myself to\nlive like a philosopher at my chateau, doing good around me, draining my\nmarshes, educating my children--\"\n\n\"That, Monsieur le duc, will be set to the account of your great\ngoodness,\" said Modeste, letting her eyes rest steadily on the noble\ngentleman. \"You flatter me in not thinking me frivolous, and in\nbelieving that I have enough resources within myself to be able to live\nin solitude. It is perhaps my lot,\" she added, glancing at Canalis, with\nan expression of pity.\n\n\"It is the lot of all insignificant fortunes,\" said the poet. \"Paris\ndemands Babylonian splendor. Sometimes I ask myself how I have ever\nmanaged to keep it up.\"\n\n\"The king does that for both of us,\" said the duke, candidly; \"we live\non his Majesty's bounty. If my family had not been allowed, after the\ndeath of Monsieur le Grand, as they call Cinq-Mars, to keep his office\namong us, we should have been obliged to sell Herouville to the Black\nBrethren. Ah, believe me, mademoiselle, it is a bitter humiliation to me\nto have to think of money in marrying.\"\n\nThe simple honesty of this confession came from his heart, and the\nregret was so sincere that it touched Modeste.\n\n\"In these days,\" said the poet, \"no man in France, Monsieur le duc, is\nrich enough to marry a woman for herself, her personal worth, her grace,\nor her beauty--\"\n\nThe colonel looked at Canalis with a curious eye, after first watching\nModeste, whose face no longer expressed the slightest astonishment.\n\n\"For persons of high honor,\" he said slowly, \"it is a noble employment\nof wealth to repair the ravages of time and destiny, and restore the old\nhistoric families.\"\n\n\"Yes, papa,\" said Modeste, gravely.\n\nThe colonel invited the duke and Canalis to dine with him sociably\nin their riding-dress, promising them to make no change himself.\nWhen Modeste went to her room to make her toilette, she looked at the\njewelled whip she had disdained in the morning.\n\n\"What workmanship they put into such things nowadays!\" she said to\nFrancoise Cochet, who had become her waiting-maid.\n\n\"That poor young man, mademoiselle, who has got a fever--\"\n\n\"Who told you that?\"\n\n\"Monsieur Butscha. He came here this afternoon and asked me to say to\nyou that he hoped you would notice he had kept his word on the appointed\nday.\"\n\nModeste came down into the salon dressed with royal simplicity.\n\n\"My dear father,\" she said aloud, taking the colonel by the arm, \"please\ngo and ask after Monsieur de La Briere's health, and take him back his\npresent. You can say that my small means, as well as my natural tastes,\nforbid my wearing ornaments which are only fit for queens or courtesans.\nBesides, I can only accept gifts from a bridegroom. Beg him to keep the\nwhip until you know whether you are rich enough to buy it back.\"\n\n\"My little girl has plenty of good sense,\" said the colonel, kissing his\ndaughter on the forehead.\n\nCanalis took advantage of a conversation which began between the duke\nand Madame Mignon to escape to the terrace, where Modeste joined him,\ninfluenced by curiosity, though the poet believed her desire to become\nMadame de Canalis had brought her there. Rather alarmed at the indecency\nwith which he had just executed what soldiers call a \"volte-face,\" and\nwhich, according to the laws of ambition, every man in his position\nwould have executed quite as brutally, he now endeavored, as the\nunfortunate Modeste approached him, to find plausible excuses for his\nconduct.\n\n\"Dear Modeste,\" he began, in a coaxing tone, \"considering the terms on\nwhich we stand to each other, shall I displease you if I say that\nyour replies to the Duc d'Herouville were very painful to a man in\nlove,--above all, to a poet whose soul is feminine, nervous, full of the\njealousies of true passion. I should make a poor diplomatist indeed if\nI had not perceived that your first coquetries, your little premeditated\ninconsistencies, were only assumed for the purpose of studying our\ncharacters--\"\n\nModeste raised her head with the rapid, intelligent, half-coquettish\nmotion of a wild animal, in whom instinct produces such miracles of\ngrace.\n\n\"--and therefore when I returned home and thought them over, they never\nmisled me. I only marvelled at a cleverness so in harmony with your\ncharacter and your countenance. Do not be uneasy, I never doubted that\nyour assumed duplicity covered an angelic candor. No, your mind, your\neducation, have in no way lessened the precious innocence which we\ndemand in a wife. You are indeed a wife for a poet, a diplomatist, a\nthinker, a man destined to endure the chances and changes of life; and\nmy admiration is equalled only by the attachment I feel to you. I now\nentreat you--if yesterday you were not playing a little comedy when\nyou accepted the love of a man whose vanity will change to pride if\nyou accept him, one whose defects will become virtues under your divine\ninfluence--I entreat you do not excite a passion which, in him, amounts\nto vice. Jealousy is a noxious element in my soul, and you have revealed\nto me its strength; it is awful, it destroys everything--Oh! I do not\nmean the jealousy of an Othello,\" he continued, noticing Modeste's\ngesture. \"No, no; my thoughts were of myself: I have been so indulged\non that point. You know the affection to which I owe all the happiness I\nhave ever enjoyed,--very little at the best\" (he sadly shook his head).\n\"Love is symbolized among all nations as a child, because it fancies\nthe world belongs to it, and it cannot conceive otherwise. Well, Nature\nherself set the limit to that sentiment. It was still-born. A tender,\nmaternal soul guessed and calmed the painful constriction of my\nheart,--for a woman who feels, who knows, that she is past the joys of\nlove becomes angelic in her treatment of others. The duchess has never\nmade me suffer in my sensibilities. For ten years not a word, not a\nlook, that could wound me! I attach more value to words, to thoughts,\nto looks, than ordinary men. If a look is to me a treasure beyond all\nprice, the slightest doubt is deadly poison; it acts instantaneously,\nmy love dies. I believe--contrary to the mass of men, who delight in\ntrembling, hoping, expecting--that love can only exist in perfect,\ninfantile, and infinite security. The exquisite purgatory, where women\ndelight to send us by their coquetry, is a base happiness to which I\nwill not submit: to me, love is either heaven or hell. If it is hell,\nI will have none of it. I feel an affinity with the azure skies of\nParadise within my soul. I can give myself without reserve, without\nsecrets, doubts or deceptions, in the life to come; and I demand\nreciprocity. Perhaps I offend you by these doubts. Remember, however,\nthat I am only talking of myself--\"\n\n\"--a good deal, but never too much,\" said Modeste, offended in every\nhole and corner of her pride by this discourse, in which the Duchesse de\nChaulieu served as a dagger. \"I am so accustomed to admire you, my dear\npoet.\"\n\n\"Well, then, can you promise me the same canine fidelity which I offer\nto you? Is it not beautiful? Is it not just what you have longed for?\"\n\n\"But why, dear poet, do you not marry a deaf-mute, and one who is also\nsomething of an idiot? I ask nothing better than to please my husband.\nBut you threaten to take away from a girl the very happiness you so\nkindly arrange for her; you are tearing away every gesture, every word,\nevery look; you cut the wings of your bird, and then expect it to\nhover about you. I know poets are accused of inconsistency--oh! very\nunjustly,\" she added, as Canalis made a gesture of denial; \"that alleged\ndefect which comes from the brilliant activity of their minds which\ncommonplace people cannot take into account. I do not believe, however,\nthat a man of genius can invent such irreconcilable conditions and call\nhis invention life. You are requiring the impossible solely for\nthe pleasure of putting me in the wrong,--like the enchanters in\nfairy-tales, who set tasks to persecuted young girls whom the good\nfairies come and deliver.\"\n\n\"In this case the good fairy would be true love,\" said Canalis in a curt\ntone, aware that his elaborate excuse for a rupture was seen through by\nthe keen and delicate mind which Butscha had piloted so well.\n\n\"My dear poet, you remind me of those fathers who inquire into a\ngirl's 'dot' before they are willing to name that of their son. You are\nquarrelling with me without knowing whether you have the slightest right\nto do so. Love is not gained by such dry arguments as yours. The poor\nduke on the contrary abandons himself to it like my Uncle Toby; with\nthis difference, that I am not the Widow Wadman,--though widow indeed\nof many illusions as to poetry at the present moment. Ah, yes, we young\ngirls will not believe in anything that disturbs our world of fancy! I\nwas warned of all this beforehand. My dear poet, you are attempting to\nget up a quarrel which is unworthy of you. I no longer recognize the\nMelchior of yesterday.\"\n\n\"Because Melchior has discovered a spirit of ambition in you which--\"\n\nModeste looked at him from head to foot with an imperial eye.\n\n\"But I shall be peer of France and ambassador as well as he,\" added\nCanalis.\n\n\"Do you take me for a bourgeois,\" she said, beginning to mount the steps\nof the portico; but she instantly turned back and added, \"That is less\nimpertinent than to take me for a fool. The change in your conduct comes\nfrom certain silly rumors which you have heard in Havre, and which my\nmaid Francoise has repeated to me.\"\n\n\"Ah, Modeste, how can you think it?\" said Canalis, striking a dramatic\nattitude. \"Do you think me capable of marrying you only for your money?\"\n\n\"If I do you that wrong after your edifying remarks on the banks of the\nSeine can you easily undeceive me,\" she said, annihilating him with her\nscorn.\n\n\"Ah!\" thought the poet, as he followed her into the house, \"if you\nthink, my little girl, that I'm to be caught in that net, you take me\nto be younger than I am. Dear, dear, what a fuss about an artful little\nthing whose esteem I value about as much as that of the king of Borneo.\nBut she has given me a good reason for the rupture by accusing me of\nsuch unworthy sentiments. Isn't she sly? La Briere will get a burden on\nhis back--idiot that he is! And five years hence it will be a good joke\nto see them together.\"\n\nThe coldness which this altercation produced between Modeste and Canalis\nwas visible to all eyes that evening. The poet went off early, on the\nground of La Briere's illness, leaving the field to the grand equerry.\nAbout eleven o'clock Butscha, who had come to walk home with Madame\nLatournelle, whispered in Modeste's ear, \"Was I right?\"\n\n\"Alas, yes,\" she said.\n\n\"But I hope you have left the door half open, so that he can come back;\nwe agreed upon that, you know.\"\n\n\"Anger got the better of me,\" said Modeste. \"Such meanness sent the\nblood to my head and I told him what I thought of him.\"\n\n\"Well, so much the better. When you are both so angry that you can't\nspeak civilly to each other I engage to make him desperately in love and\nso pressing that you will be deceived yourself.\"\n\n\"Come, come, Butscha; he is a great poet; he is a gentleman; he is a man\nof intellect.\"\n\n\"Your father's eight millions are more to him than all that.\"\n\n\"Eight millions!\" exclaimed Modeste.\n\n\"My master, who has sold his practice, is going to Provence to attend\nto the purchase of lands which your father's agent has suggested to him.\nThe sum that is to be paid for the estate of La Bastie is four millions;\nyour father has agreed to it. You are to have a 'dot' of two millions\nand another million for an establishment in Paris, a hotel and\nfurniture. Now, count up.\"\n\n\"Ah! then I can be Duchesse d'Herouville!\" cried Modeste, glancing at\nButscha.\n\n\"If it hadn't been for that comedian of a Canalis you would have kept\nHIS whip, thinking it came from me,\" said the dwarf, indirectly pleading\nLa Briere's cause.\n\n\"Monsieur Butscha, may I ask if I am to marry to please you?\" said\nModeste, laughing.\n\n\"That fine fellow loves you as well as I do,--and you loved him for\neight days,\" retorted Butscha; \"and HE has got a heart.\"\n\n\"Can he compete, pray, with an office under the Crown? There are but\nsix, grand almoner, chancellor, grand chamberlain, grand master, high\nconstable, grand admiral,--but they don't appoint high constables any\nlonger.\"\n\n\"In six months, mademoiselle, the masses--who are made up of wicked\nButschas--could send all those grand dignities to the winds. Besides,\nwhat signifies nobility in these days? There are not a thousand real\nnoblemen in France. The d'Herouvilles are descended from a tipstaff\nin the time of Robert of Normandy. You will have to put up with many a\nvexation from the old aunt with the furrowed face. Look here,--as you\nare so anxious for the title of duchess,--you belong to the Comtat, and\nthe Pope will certainly think as much of you as he does of all those\nmerchants down there; he'll sell you a duchy with some name ending in\n'ia' or 'agno.' Don't play away your happiness for an office under the\nCrown.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV. A DIPLOMATIC LETTER\n\nThe poet's reflections during the night were thoroughly matter of fact.\nHe sincerely saw nothing worse in life than the situation of a married\nman without money. Still trembling at the danger he had been led into by\nhis vanity, his desire to get the better of the duke, and his belief in\nthe Mignon millions, he began to ask himself what the duchess must be\nthinking of his stay in Havre, aggravated by the fact that he had not\nwritten to her for fourteen days, whereas in Paris they exchanged four\nor five letters a week.\n\n\"And that poor woman is working hard to get me appointed commander of\nthe Legion and ambassador to the Court of Baden!\" he cried.\n\nThereupon, with that promptitude of decision which results--in poets as\nwell as in speculators--from a lively intuition of the future, he sat\ndown and composed the following letter:--\n\n  To Madame la Duchesse de Chaulieu:\n\n  My dear Eleonore,--You have doubtless been surprised at not\n  hearing from me; but the stay I am making in this place is not\n  altogether on account of my health. I have been trying to do a\n  good turn to our little friend La Briere. The poor fellow has\n  fallen in love with a certain Mademoiselle Modeste de La Bastie, a\n  rather pale, insignificant, and thread-papery little thing, who,\n  by the way, has the vice of liking literature, and calls herself a\n  poet to excuse the caprices and humors of a rather sullen nature.\n  You know Ernest,--he is so easy to catch that I have been afraid\n  to leave him to himself. Mademoiselle de La Bastie was inclined to\n  coquet with your Melchior, and was only too ready to become your\n  rival, though her arms are thin, and she has no more bust than\n  most girls; moreover, her hair is as dead and colorless as that of\n  Madame de Rochefide, and her eyes small, gray, and very\n  suspicious. I put a stop--perhaps rather brutally--to the\n  attentions of Mademoiselle Immodeste; but love, such as mine for\n  you, demanded it. What care I for all the women on earth,\n  --compared to you, what are they?\n\n  The people with whom I pass my time, and who form the circle round\n  the heiress, are so thoroughly bourgeois that they almost turn my\n  stomach. Pity me; imagine! I pass my evenings with notaries,\n  notaresses, cashiers, provincial money-lenders--ah! what a change\n  from my evenings in the rue de Grenelle. The alleged fortune of\n  the father, lately returned from China, has brought to Havre that\n  indefatigable suitor, the grand equerry, hungry after the\n  millions, which he wants, they say, to drain his marshes. The king\n  does not know what a fatal present he made the duke in those waste\n  lands. His Grace, who has not yet found out that the lady had only\n  a small fortune, is jealous of _me_; for La Briere is quietly making\n  progress with his idol under cover of his friend, who serves as a\n  blind.\n\n  Notwithstanding Ernest's romantic ecstasies, I myself, a poet,\n  think chiefly of the essential thing, and I have been making some\n  inquiries which darken the prospects of our friend. If my angel\n  would like absolution for some of our little sins, she will try to\n  find out the facts of the case by sending for Mongenod, the\n  banker, and questioning him, with the dexterity that characterizes\n  her, as to the father's fortune? Monsieur Mignon, formerly colonel\n  of cavalry in the Imperial guard, has been for the last seven\n  years a correspondent of the Mongenods. It is said that he gives\n  his daughter a \"dot\" of two hundred thousand francs, and before I\n  make the offer on Ernest's behalf I am anxious to get the rights\n  of the story. As soon as the affair is arranged I shall return to\n  Paris. I know a way to settle everything to the advantage of our\n  young lover,--simply by the transmission of the father-in-law's\n  title, and no one, I think, can more readily obtain that favor\n  than Ernest, both on account of his own services and the influence\n  which you and I and the duke can exert for him. With his tastes,\n  Ernest, who of course will step into my office when I go to Baden,\n  will be perfectly happy in Paris with twenty-five thousand francs\n  a year, a permanent place, and a wife--luckless fellow!\n\n  Ah, dearest, how I long for the rue de Grenelle! Fifteen days of\n  absence! when they do not kill love, they revive all the ardor of\n  its earlier days, and you know, better than I, perhaps, the\n  reasons that make my love eternal,--my bones will love thee in the\n  grave! Ah! I cannot bear this separation. If I am forced to stay\n  here another ten days, I shall make a flying visit of a few hours\n  to Paris.\n\n  Has the duke obtained for me the thing we wanted; and shall you,\n  my dearest life, be ordered to drink the Baden waters next year?\n  The billing and cooing of the \"handsome disconsolate,\" compared\n  with the accents of our happy love--so true and changeless for now\n  ten years!--have given me a great contempt for marriage. I had\n  never seen the thing so near. Ah, dearest! what the world calls a\n  \"false step\" brings two beings nearer together than the law--does\n  it not?\n\nThe concluding idea served as a text for two pages of reminiscences and\naspirations a little too confidential for publication.\n\nThe evening before the day on which Canalis put the above epistle into\nthe post, Butscha, under the name of Jean Jacmin, had received a letter\nfrom his fictitious cousin, Philoxene, and had mailed his answer, which\nthus preceded the letter of the poet by about twelve hours. Terribly\nanxious for the last two weeks, and wounded by Melchior's silence,\nthe duchess herself dictated Philoxene's letter to her cousin, and\nthe moment she had read the answer, rather too explicit for her\nquinquagenary vanity, she sent for the banker and made close inquiries\nas to the exact fortune of Monsieur Mignon. Finding herself betrayed and\nabandoned for the millions, Eleonore gave way to a paroxysm of anger,\nhatred, and cold vindictiveness. Philoxene knocked at the door of the\nsumptuous room, and entering found her mistress with her eyes full\nof tears,--so unprecedented a phenomenon in the fifteen years she had\nwaited upon her that the woman stopped short stupefied.\n\n\"We expiate the happiness of ten years in ten minutes,\" she heard the\nduchess say.\n\n\"A letter from Havre, madame.\"\n\nEleonore read the poet's prose without noticing the presence of\nPhiloxene, whose amazement became still greater when she saw the dawn\nof fresh serenity on the duchess's face as she read further and further\ninto the letter. Hold out a pole no thicker than a walking-stick to\na drowning man, and he will think it a high-road of safety. The happy\nEleonore believed in Canalis's good faith when she had read through the\nfour pages in which love and business, falsehood and truth, jostled\neach other. She who, a few moments earlier, had sent for her husband\nto prevent Melchior's appointment while there was still time, was now\nseized with a spirit of generosity that amounted almost to the sublime.\n\n\"Poor fellow!\" she thought; \"he has not had one faithless thought; he\nloves me as he did on the first day; he tells me all--Philoxene!\"\nshe cried, noticing her maid, who was standing near and pretending to\narrange the toilet-table.\n\n\"Madame la duchesse?\"\n\n\"A mirror, child!\"\n\nEleonore looked at herself, saw the fine razor-like lines traced on her\nbrow, which disappeared at a little distance; she sighed, and in that\nsigh she felt she bade adieu to love. A brave thought came into her\nmind, a manly thought, outside of all the pettiness of women,--a\nthought which intoxicates for a moment, and which explains, perhaps,\nthe clemency of the Semiramis of Russia when she married her young and\nbeautiful rival to Momonoff.\n\n\"Since he has not been faithless, he shall have the girl and her\nmillions,\" she thought,--\"provided Mademoiselle Mignon is as ugly as he\nsays she is.\"\n\nThree raps, circumspectly given, announced the duke, and his wife went\nherself to the door to let him in.\n\n\"Ah! I see you are better, my dear,\" he cried, with the counterfeit\njoy that courtiers assume so readily, and by which fools are so readily\ntaken in.\n\n\"My dear Henri,\" she answered, \"why is it you have not yet obtained that\nappointment for Melchior,--you who sacrificed so much to the king in\ntaking a ministry which you knew could only last one year.\"\n\nThe duke glanced at Philoxene, who showed him by an almost imperceptible\nsign the letter from Havre on the dressing-table.\n\n\"You would be terribly bored at Baden and come back at daggers drawn\nwith Melchior,\" said the duke.\n\n\"Pray why?\"\n\n\"Why, you would always be together,\" said the former diplomat, with\ncomic good-humor.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she said; \"I am going to marry him.\"\n\n\"If we can believe d'Herouville, our dear Canalis stands in no need\nof your help in that direction,\" said the duke, smiling. \"Yesterday\nGrandlieu read me some passages from a letter the grand equerry had\nwritten him. No doubt they were dictated by the aunt for the express\npurpose of their reaching you, for Mademoiselle d'Herouville, always on\nthe scent of a 'dot,' knows that Grandlieu and I play whist nearly every\nevening. That good little d'Herouville wants the Prince de Cadignan to\ngo down and give a royal hunt in Normandy, and endeavor to persuade the\nking to be present, so as to turn the head of the damozel when she sees\nherself the object of such a grand affair. In short, two words from\nCharles X. would settle the matter. D'Herouville says the girl has\nincomparable beauty--\"\n\n\"Henri, let us go to Havre!\" cried the duchess, interrupting him.\n\n\"Under what pretext?\" said her husband, gravely; he was one of the\nconfidants of Louis XVIII.\n\n\"I never saw a hunt.\"\n\n\"It would be all very well if the king went; but it is a terrible bore\nto go so far, and he will not do it; I have just been speaking with him\nabout it.\"\n\n\"Perhaps _Madame_ would go?\"\n\n\"That would be better,\" returned the duke, \"I dare say the Duchesse de\nMaufrigneuse would help you to persuade her from Rosny. If she goes the\nking will not be displeased at the use of his hunting equipage. Don't\ngo to Havre, my dear,\" added the duke, paternally, \"that would be giving\nyourself away. Come, here's a better plan, I think. Gaspard's chateau of\nRosembray is on the other side of the forest of Brotonne; why not give\nhim a hint to invite the whole party?\"\n\n\"He invite them?\" said Eleonore.\n\n\"I mean, of course, the duchess; she is always engaged in pious works\nwith Mademoiselle d'Herouville; give that old maid a hint, and get her\nto speak to Gaspard.\"\n\n\"You are a love of a man,\" cried Eleonore; \"I'll write to the old maid\nand to Diane at once, for we must get hunting things made,--a riding hat\nis so becoming. Did you win last night at the English embassy?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the duke; \"I cleared myself.\"\n\n\"Henri, above all things, stop proceedings about Melchior's two\nappointments.\"\n\nAfter writing half a dozen lines to the beautiful Diane de Maufrigneuse,\nand a short hint to Mademoiselle d'Herouville, Eleonore sent the\nfollowing answer like the lash of a whip through the poet's lies.\n\n  To Monsieur le Baron de Canalis:--\n\n  My dear poet,--Mademoiselle de La Bastie is very beautiful;\n  Mongenod has proved to me that her father has millions. I did\n  think of marrying you to her; I am therefore much displeased at\n  your want of confidence. If you had any intention of marrying La\n  Briere when you went to Havre it is surprising that you said\n  nothing to me about it before you started. And why have you\n  omitted writing to a friend who is so easily made anxious as I?\n  Your letter arrived a trifle late; I had already seen the banker.\n  You are a child, Melchior, and you are playing tricks with us. It\n  is not right. The duke himself is quite indignant at your\n  proceedings; he thinks you less than a gentleman, which casts some\n  reflections on your mother's honor.\n\n  Now, I intend to see things for myself. I shall, I believe, have\n  the honor of accompanying _Madame_ to the hunt which the Duc\n  d'Herouville proposes to give for Mademoiselle de La Bastie. I\n  will manage to have you invited to Rosembray, for the meet will\n  probably take place in Duc de Verneuil's park.\n\n  Pray believe, my dear poet, that I am none the less, for life,\n\n  Your friend,      Eleonore de M.\n\n\n\"There, Ernest, just look at that!\" cried Canalis, tossing the letter\nat Ernest's nose across the breakfast-table; \"that's the two thousandth\nlove-letter I have had from that woman, and there isn't even a 'thou' in\nit. The illustrious Eleonore has never compromised herself more than she\ndoes there. Marry, and try your luck! The worst marriage in the world\nis better than this sort of halter. Ah, I am the greatest Nicodemus that\never tumbled out of the moon! Modeste has millions, and I've lost\nher; for we can't get back from the poles, where we are to-day, to the\ntropics, where we were three days ago! Well, I am all the more anxious\nfor your triumph over the grand equerry, because I told the duchess I\ncame here only for your sake; and so I shall do my best for you.\"\n\n\"Alas, Melchior, Modeste must needs have so noble, so grand, so\nwell-balanced a nature to resist the glories of the Court, and all these\nsplendors cleverly displayed for her honor and glory by the duke, that I\ncannot believe in the existence of such perfection,--and yet, if she is\nstill the Modeste of her letters, there might be hope!\"\n\n\"Well, well, you are a happy fellow, you young Boniface, to see the\nworld and your mistress through green spectacles!\" cried Canalis,\nmarching off to pace up and down the garden.\n\nCaught between two lies, the poet was at a loss what to do.\n\n\"Play by rule, and you lose!\" he cried presently, sitting down in the\nkiosk. \"Every man of sense would have acted as I did four days ago, and\ngot himself out of the net in which I saw myself. At such times people\ndon't disentangle nets, they break through them! Come, let us be calm,\ncold, dignified, affronted. Honor requires it; English stiffness is the\nonly way to win her back. After all, if I have to retire finally, I can\nalways fall back on my old happiness; a fidelity of ten years can't go\nunrewarded. Eleonore will arrange me some good marriage.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI. TRUE LOVE\n\nThe hunt was destined to be not only a meet of the hounds, but a meeting\nof all the passions excited by the colonel's millions and Modeste's\nbeauty; and while it was in prospect there was truce between the\nadversaries. During the days required for the arrangement of this\nforestrial solemnity, the salon of the villa Mignon presented the\ntranquil picture of a united family. Canalis, cut short in his role of\ninjured love by Modeste's quick perceptions, wished to appear courteous;\nhe laid aside his pretensions, gave no further specimens of his\noratory, and became, what all men of intellect can be when they renounce\naffectation, perfectly charming. He talked finances with Gobenheim, and\nwar with the colonel, Germany with Madame Mignon, and housekeeping with\nMadame Latournelle,--endeavoring to bias them all in favor of La Briere.\nThe Duc d'Herouville left the field to his rivals, for he was obliged\nto go to Rosembray to consult with the Duc de Verneuil, and see that the\norders of the Royal Huntsman, the Prince de Cadignan, were carried out.\nAnd yet the comic element was not altogether wanting. Modeste found\nherself between the depreciatory hints of Canalis as to the gallantry\nof the grand equerry, and the exaggerations of the two Mesdemoiselles\nd'Herouville, who passed every evening at the villa. Canalis made\nModeste take notice that, instead of being the heroine of the hunt, she\nwould be scarcely noticed. _Madame_ would be attended by the Duchesse de\nMaufrigneuse, daughter-in-law of the Prince de Cadignan, by the Duchesse\nde Chaulieu, and other great ladies of the Court, among whom she could\nproduce no sensation; no doubt the officers in garrison at Rouen would\nbe invited, etc. Helene, on the other hand, was incessantly telling her\nnew friend, whom she already looked upon as a sister-in-law, that she\nwas to be presented to _Madame_; undoubtedly the Duc de Verneuil would\ninvite her father and herself to stay at Rosembray; if the colonel\nwished to obtain a favor of the king,--a peerage, for instance,--the\nopportunity was unique, for there was hope of the king himself being\npresent on the third day; she would be delighted with the charming\nwelcome with which the beauties of the Court, the Duchesses de Chaulieu,\nde Maufrigneuse, de Lenoncourt-Chaulieu, and other ladies, were prepared\nto meet her. It was in fact an excessively amusing little warfare, with\nits marches and countermarches and stratagems,--all of which were keenly\nenjoyed by the Dumays, the Latournelles, Gobenheim, and Butscha, who,\nin conclave assembled, said horrible things of these noble personages,\ncruelly noting and intelligently studying all their little meannesses.\n\nThe promises on the d'Herouville side were, however, confirmed by the\narrival of an invitation, couched in flattering terms, from the Duc de\nVerneuil and the Master of the Hunt to Monsieur le Comte de La Bastie\nand his daughter, to stay at Rosembray and be present at a grand hunt on\nthe seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth, of November following.\n\nLa Briere, full of dark presentiments, craved the presence of Modeste\nwith an eagerness whose bitter joys are known only to lovers who feel\nthat they are parted, and parted fatally from those they love. Flashes\nof joy came to him intermingled with melancholy meditations on the one\ntheme, \"I have lost her,\" and made him all the more interesting to those\nwho watched him, because his face and his whole person were in keeping\nwith his profound feeling. There is nothing more poetic than a living\nelegy, animated by a pair of eyes, walking about, and sighing without\nrhymes.\n\nThe Duc d'Herouville arrived at last to arrange for Modeste's departure;\nafter crossing the Seine she was to be conveyed in the duke's caleche,\naccompanied by the Demoiselles d'Herouville. The duke was charmingly\ncourteous, he begged Canalis and La Briere to be of the party, assuring\nthem, as he did the colonel, that he had taken particular care that\nhunters should be provided for them. The colonel invited the three\nlovers to breakfast on the morning of the start. Canalis then began to\nput into execution a plan that he had been maturing in his own mind for\nthe last few days; namely, to quietly reconquer Modeste, and throw over\nthe duchess, La Briere, and the duke. A graduate of diplomacy could\nhardly remain stuck in the position in which he found himself. On the\nother hand La Briere had come to the resolution of bidding Modeste an\neternal farewell. Each suitor was therefore on the watch to slip in a\nlast word, like the defendant's counsel to the court before judgment is\npronounced; for all felt that the three weeks' struggle was approaching\nits conclusion. After dinner on the evening before the start was to be\nmade, the colonel had taken his daughter by the arm and made her feel\nthe necessity of deciding.\n\n\"Our position with the d'Herouville family will be quite intolerable at\nRosembray,\" he said to her. \"Do you mean to be a duchess?\"\n\n\"No, father,\" she answered.\n\n\"Then do you love Canalis?\"\n\n\"No, papa, a thousand times no!\" she exclaimed with the impatience of a\nchild.\n\nThe colonel looked at her with a sort of joy.\n\n\"Ah, I have not influenced you,\" cried the true father, \"and I will\nnow confess that I chose my son-in-law in Paris when, having made him\nbelieve that I had but little fortune, he grasped my hand and told me I\ntook a weight from his mind--\"\n\n\"Who is it you mean?\" asked Modeste, coloring.\n\n\"_The man of fixed principles and sound moralities_,\" said her father,\nslyly, repeating the words which had dissolved poor Modeste's dream on\nthe day after his return.\n\n\"I was not even thinking of him, papa. Please leave me at liberty to\nrefuse the duke myself; I understand him, and I know how to soothe him.\"\n\n\"Then your choice is not made?\"\n\n\"Not yet; there is another syllable or two in the charade of my destiny\nstill to be guessed; but after I have had a glimpse of court life at\nRosembray I will tell you my secret.\"\n\n\"Ah! Monsieur de La Briere,\" cried the colonel, as the young man\napproached them along the garden path in which they were walking, \"I\nhope you are going to this hunt?\"\n\n\"No, colonel,\" answered Ernest. \"I have come to take leave of you and of\nmademoiselle; I return to Paris--\"\n\n\"You have no curiosity,\" said Modeste, interrupting, and looking at him.\n\n\"A wish--that I cannot expect--would suffice to keep me,\" he replied.\n\n\"If that is all, you must stay to please me; I wish it,\" said the\ncolonel, going forward to meet Canalis, and leaving his daughter and La\nBriere together for a moment.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said the young man, raising his eyes to hers with the\nboldness of a man without hope, \"I have an entreaty to make to you.\"\n\n\"To me?\"\n\n\"Let me carry away with me your forgiveness. My life can never be happy;\nit must be full of remorse for having lost my happiness--no doubt by my\nown fault; but, at least,--\"\n\n\"Before we part forever,\" said Modeste, interrupting a la Canalis, and\nspeaking in a voice of some emotion, \"I wish to ask you one thing; and\nthough you once disguised yourself, I think you cannot be so base as to\ndeceive me now.\"\n\nThe taunt made him turn pale, and he cried out, \"Oh, you are pitiless!\"\n\n\"Will you be frank?\"\n\n\"You have the right to ask me that degrading question,\" he said, in a\nvoice weakened by the violent palpitation of his heart.\n\n\"Well, then, did you read my letters to Monsieur de Canalis?\"\n\n\"No, mademoiselle; and I allowed your father to read them it was to\njustify my love by showing him how it was born, and how sincere my\nefforts were to cure you of your fancy.\"\n\n\"But how came the idea of that unworthy masquerade ever to arise?\" she\nsaid, with a sort of impatience.\n\nLa Briere related truthfully the scene in the poet's study which\nModeste's first letter had occasioned, and the sort of challenge that\nresulted from his expressing a favorable opinion of a young girl thus\nled toward a poet's fame, as a plant seeks its share of the sun.\n\n\"You have said enough,\" said Modeste, restraining some emotion. \"If you\nhave not my heart, monsieur, you have at least my esteem.\"\n\nThese simple words gave the young man a violent shock; feeling himself\nstagger, he leaned against a tree, like a man deprived for a moment of\nreason. Modest, who had left him, turned her head and came hastily back.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" she asked, taking his hand to prevent him from\nfalling.\n\n\"Forgive me--I thought you despised me.\"\n\n\"But,\" she answered, with a distant and disdainful manner, \"I did not\nsay that I loved you.\"\n\nAnd she left him again. But this time, in spite of her harshness, La\nBriere thought he walked on air; the earth softened under his feet, the\ntrees bore flowers; the skies were rosy, the air cerulean, as they are\nin the temples of Hymen in those fairy pantomimes which finish happily.\nIn such situations every woman is a Janus, and sees behind her without\nturning round; and thus Modeste perceived on the face of her lover the\nindubitable symptoms of a love like Butscha's,--surely the \"ne plus\nultra\" of a woman's hope. Moreover, the great value which La Briere\nattached to her opinion filled Modeste with an emotion that was\ninestimably sweet.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said Canalis, leaving the colonel and waylaying Modeste,\n\"in spite of the little value you attach to my sentiments, my honor is\nconcerned in effacing a stain under which I have suffered too long. Here\nis a letter which I received from the Duchesse de Chaulieu five days\nafter my arrival in Havre.\"\n\nHe let Modeste read the first lines of the letter we have seen, which\nthe duchess began by saying that she had seen Mongenod, and now wished\nto marry her poet to Modeste; then he tore that passage from the body of\nthe letter, and placed the fragment in her hand.\n\n\"I cannot let you read the rest,\" he said, putting the paper in his\npocket; \"but I confide these few lines to your discretion, so that you\nmay verify the writing. A young girl who could accuse me of ignoble\nsentiments is quite capable of suspecting some collusion, some trickery.\nAh, Modeste,\" he said, with tears in his voice, \"your poet, the poet of\nMadame de Chaulieu, has no less poetry in his heart than in his mind.\nYou are about to see the duchess; suspend your judgment of me till\nthen.\"\n\nHe left Modeste half bewildered.\n\n\"Oh, dear!\" she said to herself; \"it seems they are all angels--and not\nmarriageable; the duke is the only one that belongs to humanity.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle Modeste,\" said Butscha, appearing with a parcel under his\narm, \"this hunt makes me very uneasy. I dreamed your horse ran away with\nyou, and I have been to Rouen to see if I could get a Spanish bit which,\nthey tell me, a horse can't take between his teeth. I entreat you to\nuse it. I have shown it to the colonel, and he has thanked me more than\nthere is any occasion for.\"\n\n\"Poor, dear Butscha!\" cried Modeste, moved to tears by this maternal\ncare.\n\nButscha went skipping off like a man who has just heard of the death of\na rich uncle.\n\n\"My dear father,\" said Modeste, returning to the salon; \"I should like\nto have that beautiful whip,--suppose you were to ask Monsieur de La\nBriere to exchange it for your picture by Van Ostade.\"\n\nModeste looked furtively at Ernest, while the colonel made him this\nproposition, standing before the picture which was the sole thing he\npossessed in memory of his campaigns, having bought it of a burgher\nat Rabiston; and she said to herself as La Briere left the room\nprecipitately, \"He will be at the hunt.\"\n\nA curious thing happened. Modeste's three lovers each and all went to\nRosembray with their hearts full of hope, and captivated by her many\nperfections.\n\nRosembray,--an estate lately purchased by the Duc de Verneuil, with the\nmoney which fell to him as his share of the thousand millions voted as\nindemnity for the sale of the lands of the emigres,--is remarkable for\nits chateau, whose magnificence compares only with that of Mesniere or\nof Balleroy. This imposing and noble edifice is approached by a wide\navenue of four rows of venerable elms, from which the visitor enters\nan immense rising court-yard, like that at Versailles, with magnificent\niron railings and two lodges, and adorned with rows of large\norange-trees in their tubs. Facing this court-yard, the chateau\npresents, between two fronts of the main building which retreat on\neither side of this projection, a double row of nineteen tall windows,\nwith carved arches and diamond panes, divided from each other by a\nseries of fluted pilasters surmounted by an entablature which hides an\nItalian roof, from which rise several stone chimneys masked by\ncarved trophies of arms. Rosembray was built, under Louis XIV., by a\n\"fermier-general\" named Cottin. The facade toward the park differs from\nthat on the court-yard by having a narrower projection in the centre,\nwith columns between five windows, above which rises a magnificent\npediment. The family of Marigny, to whom the estates of this Cottin were\nbrought in marriage by Mademoiselle Cottin, her father's sole heiress,\nordered a sunrise to be carved on this pediment by Coysevox. Beneath it\nare two angels unwinding a scroll, on which is cut this motto in honor\nof the Grand Monarch, \"Sol nobis benignus.\"\n\nFrom the portico, reached by two grand circular and balustraded flights\nof steps, the view extends over an immense fish-pond, as long and wide\nas the grand canal at Versailles, beginning at the foot of a grass-plot\nwhich compares well with the finest English lawns, and bordered with\nbeds and baskets now filled with the brilliant flowers of autumn. On\neither side of the piece of water two gardens, laid out in the French\nstyle, display their squares and long straight paths, like brilliant\npages written in the ciphers of Lenotre. These gardens are backed to\ntheir whole length by a border of nearly thirty acres of woodland. From\nthe terrace the view is bounded by a forest belonging to Rosembray and\ncontiguous to two other forests, one of which belongs to the Crown, the\nother to the State. It would be difficult to find a nobler landscape.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII. A GIRL'S REVENGE\n\nModeste's arrival at Rosembray made a certain sensation in the avenue\nwhen the carriage with the liveries of France came in sight, accompanied\nby the grand equerry, the colonel, Canalis, and La Briere on\nhorseback, preceded by an outrider in full dress, and followed by six\nservants,--among whom were the Negroes and the mulatto,--and the britzka\nof the colonel for the two waiting-women and the luggage. The carriage\nwas drawn by four horses, ridden by postilions dressed with an elegance\nspecially commanded by the grand equerry, who was often better served\nthan the king himself. As Modeste, dazzled by the magnificence of the\ngreat lords, entered and beheld this lesser Versailles, she suddenly\nremembered her approaching interview with the celebrated duchesses, and\nbegan to fear that she might seem awkward, or provincial, or parvenue;\nin fact, she lost her self-possession, and heartily repented having\nwished for a hunt.\n\nFortunately, however, as the carriage drew up, Modeste saw an old man,\nin a blond wig frizzed into little curls, whose calm, plump, smooth face\nwore a fatherly smile and an expression of monastic cheerfulness which\nthe half-veiled glance of the eye rendered almost noble. This was the\nDuc de Verneuil, master of Rosembray. The duchess, a woman of extreme\npiety, the only daughter of a rich and deceased chief-justice, spare\nand erect, and the mother of four children, resembled Madame\nLatournelle,--if the imagination can go so far as to adorn the notary's\nwife with the graces of a bearing that was truly abbatial.\n\n\"Ah, good morning, dear Hortense!\" said Mademoiselle d'Herouville,\nkissing the duchess with the sympathy that united their haughty\nnatures; \"let me present to you and to the dear duke our little angel,\nMademoiselle de La Bastie.\"\n\n\"We have heard so much of you, mademoiselle,\" said the duchess, \"that we\nwere in haste to receive you.\"\n\n\"And regret the time lost,\" added the Duc de Verneuil, with courteous\nadmiration.\n\n\"Monsieur le Comte de La Bastie,\" said the grand equerry, taking the\ncolonel by the arm and presenting him to the duke and duchess, with an\nair of respect in his tone and gesture.\n\n\"I am glad to welcome you, Monsieur le comte!\" said Monsieur de\nVerneuil. \"You possess more than one treasure,\" he added, looking at\nModeste.\n\nThe duchess took Modeste under her arm and led her into an immense\nsalon, where a dozen or more women were grouped about the fireplace. The\nmen of the party remained with the duke on the terrace, except Canalis,\nwho respectfully made his way to the superb Eleonore. The Duchesse de\nChaulieu, seated at an embroidery-frame, was showing Mademoiselle de\nVerneuil how to shade a flower.\n\nIf Modeste had run a needle through her finger when handling a\npin-cushion she could not have felt a sharper prick than she received\nfrom the cold and haughty and contemptuous stare with which Madame de\nChaulieu favored her. For an instant she saw nothing but that one woman,\nand she saw through her. To understand the depths of cruelty to which\nthese charming creatures, whom our passions deify, can go, we must see\nwomen with each other. Modeste would have disarmed almost any other than\nEleonore by the perfectly stupid and involuntary admiration which\nher face betrayed. Had she not known the duchess's age she would have\nthought her a woman of thirty-six; but other and greater astonishments\nawaited her.\n\nThe poet had run plump against a great lady's anger. Such anger is the\nworst of sphinxes; the face is radiant, all the rest menacing. Kings\nthemselves cannot make the exquisite politeness of a mistress's cold\nanger capitulate when she guards it with steel armor. Canalis tried to\ncling to the steel, but his fingers slipped on the polished surface,\nlike his words on the heart; and the gracious face, the gracious words,\nthe gracious bearing of the duchess hid the steel of her wrath, now\nfallen to twenty-five below zero, from all observers. The appearance\nof Modeste in her sublime beauty, and dressed as well as Diane de\nMaufrigneuse herself, had fired the train of gunpowder which reflection\nhad been laying in Eleonore's mind.\n\nAll the women had gone to the windows to see the new wonder get out of\nthe royal carriage, attended by her three suitors.\n\n\"Do not let us seem so curious,\" Madame de Chaulieu had said, cut to the\nheart by Diane's exclamation,--\"She is divine! where in the world\ndoes she come from?\"--and with that the bevy flew back to their seats,\nresuming their composure, though Eleonore's heart was full of hungry\nvipers all clamorous for a meal.\n\nMademoiselle d'Herouville said in a low voice and with much meaning\nto the Duchesse de Verneuil, \"Eleonore receives her Melchior very\nungraciously.\"\n\n\"The Duchesse de Maufrigneuse thinks there is a coolness between them,\"\nsaid Laure de Verneuil, with simplicity.\n\nCharming phrase! so often used in the world of society,--how the north\nwind blows through it.\n\n\"Why so?\" asked Modeste of the pretty young girl who had lately left the\nSacre-Coeur.\n\n\"The great poet,\" said the pious duchess--making a sign to her daughter\nto be silent--\"left Madame de Chaulieu without a letter for more than\ntwo weeks after he went to Havre, having told her that he went there for\nhis health--\"\n\nModeste made a hasty movement, which caught the attention of Laure,\nHelene, and Mademoiselle d'Herouville.\n\n\"--and during that time,\" continued the devout duchess, \"she was\nendeavoring to have him appointed commander of the Legion of honor, and\nminister at Baden.\"\n\n\"Oh, that was shameful in Canalis; he owes everything to her,\" exclaimed\nMademoiselle d'Herouville.\n\n\"Why did not Madame de Chaulieu come to Havre?\" asked Modeste of Helene,\ninnocently.\n\n\"My dear,\" said the Duchesse de Verneuil, \"she would let herself be cut\nin little pieces without saying a word. Look at her,--she is regal; her\nhead would smile, like Mary Stuart's, after it was cut off; in fact, she\nhas some of that blood in her veins.\"\n\n\"Did she not write to him?\" asked Modeste.\n\n\"Diane tells me,\" answered the duchess, prompted by a nudge from\nMademoiselle d'Herouville, \"that in answer to Canalis's first letter she\nmade a cutting reply a few days ago.\"\n\nThis explanation made Modeste blush with shame for the man before her;\nshe longed, not to crush him under her feet, but to revenge herself by\none of those malicious acts that are sharper than a dagger's thrust. She\nlooked haughtily at the Duchesse de Chaulieu--\n\n\"Monsieur Melchior!\" she said.\n\nAll the women snuffed the air and looked alternately at the duchess, who\nwas talking in an undertone to Canalis over the embroidery-frame,\nand then at the young girl so ill brought up as to disturb a lovers'\nmeeting,--a thing not permissible in any society. Diane de Maufrigneuse\nnodded, however, as much as to say, \"The child is in the right of it.\"\nAll the women ended by smiling at each other; they were enraged with a\nwoman who was fifty-six years old and still handsome enough to put her\nfingers into the treasury and steal the dues of youth. Melchior looked\nat Modeste with feverish impatience, and made the gesture of a master\nto a valet, while the duchess lowered her head with the movement of a\nlioness disturbed at a meal; her eyes, fastened on the canvas, emitted\nred flames in the direction of the poet, which stabbed like epigrams,\nfor each word revealed to her a triple insult.\n\n\"Monsieur Melchior!\" said Modeste again in a voice that asserted its\nright to be heard.\n\n\"What, mademoiselle?\" demanded the poet.\n\nForced to rise, he remained standing half-way between the embroidery\nframe, which was near a window, and the fireplace where Modeste was\nseated with the Duchesse de Verneuil on a sofa. What bitter reflections\ncame into his ambitious mind, as he caught a glance from Eleonore. If\nhe obeyed Modeste all was over, and forever, between himself and his\nprotectress. Not to obey her was to avow his slavery, to lose the\nchances of his twenty-five days of base manoeuvring, and to disregard\nthe plainest laws of decency and civility. The greater the folly, the\nmore imperatively the duchess exacted it. Modeste's beauty and money\nthus pitted against Eleonore's rights and influence made this hesitation\nbetween the man and his honor as terrible to witness as the peril of\na matador in the arena. A man seldom feels such palpitations as those\nwhich now came near causing Canalis an aneurism, except, perhaps, before\nthe green table, where his fortune or his ruin is about to be decided.\n\n\"Mademoiselle d'Herouville hurried me from the carriage, and I left\nbehind me,\" said Modeste to Canalis, \"my handkerchief--\"\n\nCanalis shrugged his shoulders significantly.\n\n\"And,\" continued Modeste, taking no notice of his gesture, \"I had tied\ninto one corner of it the key of a desk which contains the fragment of\nan important letter; have the kindness, Monsieur Melchior, to get it for\nme.\"\n\nBetween an angel and a tiger equally enraged Canalis, who had turned\nlivid, no longer hesitated,--the tiger seemed to him the least dangerous\nof the two; and he was about to do as he was told, and commit himself\nirretrievably, when La Briere appeared at the door of the salon, seeming\nto his anguished mind like the archangel Gabriel tumbling from heaven.\n\n\"Ernest, here, Mademoiselle de La Bastie wants you,\" said the poet,\nhastily returning to his chair by the embroidery frame.\n\nErnest rushed to Modeste without bowing to any one; he saw only her,\ntook his commission with undisguised joy, and darted from the room, with\nthe secret approbation of every woman present.\n\n\"What an occupation for a poet!\" said Modeste to Helene d'Herouville,\nglancing toward the embroidery at which the duchess was now working\nsavagely.\n\n\"If you speak to her, if you ever look at her, all is over between us,\"\nsaid the duchess to the poet in a low voice, not at all satisfied with\nthe very doubtful termination which Ernest's arrival had put to the\nscene; \"and remember, if I am not present, I leave behind me eyes that\nwill watch you.\"\n\nSo saying, the duchess, a woman of medium height, but a little too\nstout, like all women over fifty who retain their beauty, rose and\nwalked toward the group which surrounded Diane de Maufrigneuse, stepping\ndaintily on little feet that were as slender and nervous as a deer's.\nBeneath her plumpness could be seen the exquisite delicacy of such\nwomen, which comes from the vigor of their nervous systems controlling\nand vitalizing the development of flesh. There is no other way to\nexplain the lightness of her step, and the incomparable nobility of her\nbearing. None but the women whose quarterings begin with Noah know,\nas Eleonore did, how to be majestic in spite of a buxom tendency. A\nphilosopher might have pitied Philoxene, while admiring the graceful\nlines of the bust and the minute care bestowed upon a morning dress,\nwhich was worn with the elegance of a queen and the easy grace of a\nyoung girl. Her abundant hair, still undyed, was simply wound about her\nhead in plaits; she bared her snowy throat and shoulders, exquisitely\nmodelled, and her celebrated hand and arm, with pardonable pride.\nModeste, together with all other antagonists of the duchess, recognized\nin her a woman of whom they were forced to say, \"She eclipses us.\" In\nfact, Eleonore was one of the \"grandes dames\" now so rare. To endeavor\nto explain what august quality there was in the carriage of the head,\nwhat refinement and delicacy in the curve of the throat, what harmony in\nher movements, and nobility in her bearing, what grandeur in the perfect\naccord of details with the whole being, and in the arts, now a second\nnature, which render a woman grand and even sacred,--to explain all\nthese things would simply be to attempt to analyze the sublime. People\nenjoy such poetry as they enjoy that of Paganini; they do not explain to\nthemselves the medium, they know the cause is in the spirit that remains\ninvisible.\n\nMadame de Chaulieu bowed her head in salutation of Helene and her aunt;\nthen, saying to Diane, in a pure and equable tone of voice, without a\ntrace of emotion, \"Is it not time to dress, duchess?\" she made her exit,\naccompanied by her daughter-in-law and Mademoiselle d'Herouville. As she\nleft the room she spoke in an undertone to the old maid, who pressed her\narm, saying, \"You are charming,\"--which meant, \"I am all gratitude\nfor the service you have just done us.\" After that, Mademoiselle\nd'Herouville returned to the salon to play her part of spy, and her\nfirst glance apprised Canalis that the duchess had made him no empty\nthreat. That apprentice in diplomacy became aware that his science was\nnot sufficient for a struggle of this kind, and his wit served him\nto take a more honest position, if not a worthier one. When Ernest\nreturned, bringing Modeste's handkerchief, the poet seized his arm and\ntook him out on the terrace.\n\n\"My dear friend,\" he said, \"I am not only the most unfortunate man in\nthe world, but I am also the most ridiculous; and I come to you to get\nme out of the hornet's nest into which I have run myself. Modeste is a\ndemon; she sees my difficulty and she laughs at it; she has just spoken\nto me of a fragment of a letter of Madame de Chaulieu, which I had\nthe folly to give her; if she shows it I can never make my peace with\nEleonore. Therefore, will you at once ask Modeste to send me back that\npaper, and tell her, from me, that I make no pretensions to her hand.\nSay I count upon her delicacy, upon her propriety as a young girl, to\nbehave to me as if we had never known each other. I beg her not to speak\nto me; I implore her to treat me harshly,--though I hardly dare ask her\nto feign a jealous anger, which would help my interests amazingly. Go, I\nwill wait here for an answer.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII. MODESTE BEHAVES WITH DIGNITY\n\nOn re-entering the salon Ernest de La Briere found a young officer of\nthe company of the guard d'Havre, the Vicomte de Serizy, who had just\narrived from Rosny to announce that _Madame_ was obliged to be present\nat the opening of the Chambers. We know the importance then attached to\nthis constitutional solemnity, at which Charles X. delivered his speech,\nsurrounded by the royal family,--Madame la Dauphine and _Madame_ being\npresent in their gallery. The choice of the emissary charged with the\nduty of expressing the princess's regrets was an attention to Diane,\nwho was then an object of adoration to this charming young man, son of\na minister of state, gentleman in ordinary of the chamber, only son and\nheir to an immense fortune. The Duchesse de Maufrigneuse permitted his\nattentions solely for the purpose of attracting notice to the age of\nhis mother, Madame de Serizy, who was said, in those chronicles that\nare whispered behind the fans, to have deprived her of the heart of the\nhandsome Lucien de Rubempre.\n\n\"You will do us the pleasure, I hope, to remain at Rosembray,\" said the\nsevere duchess to the young officer.\n\nWhile giving ear to every scandal, the devout lady shut her eyes to the\nderelictions of her guests who had been carefully selected by the duke;\nindeed, it is surprising how much these excellent women will tolerate\nunder pretence of bringing the lost sheep back to the fold by their\nindulgence.\n\n\"We reckoned without our constitutional government,\" said the grand\nequerry; \"and Rosembray, Madame la duchesse, will lose a great honor.\"\n\n\"We shall be more at our ease,\" said a tall thin old man, about\nseventy-five years of age, dressed in blue cloth, and wearing his\nhunting-cap by permission of the ladies. This personage, who closely\nresembled the Duc de Bourbon, was no less than the Prince de Cadignan,\nMaster of the Hunt, and one of the last of the great French lords.\nJust as La Briere was endeavoring to slip behind the sofa and obtain a\nmoment's intercourse with Modeste, a man of thirty-eight, short, fat,\nand very common in appearance, entered the room.\n\n\"My son, the Prince de Loudon,\" said the Duchesse de Verneuil to\nModeste, who could not restrain the expression of amazement that\noverspread her young face on seeing the man who bore the historical name\nthat the hero of La Vendee had rendered famous by his bravery and the\nmartyrdom of his death.\n\n\"Gaspard,\" said the duchess, calling her son to her. The young\nprince came at once, and his mother continued, motioning to Modeste,\n\"Mademoiselle de La Bastie, my friend.\"\n\nThe heir presumptive, whose marriage with Desplein's only daughter had\nlately been arranged, bowed to the young girl without seeming struck,\nas his father had been, with her beauty. Modeste was thus enabled to\ncompare the youth of to-day with the old age of a past epoch; for the\nold Prince de Cadignan had already said a few words which made her feel\nthat he rendered as true a homage to womanhood as to royalty. The Duc de\nRhetore, the eldest son of the Duchesse de Chaulieu, chiefly remarkable\nfor manners that were equally impertinent and free and easy, bowed\nto Modeste rather cavalierly. The reason of this contrast between the\nfathers and the sons is to be found, probably, in the fact that young\nmen no longer feel themselves great beings, as their forefathers did,\nand they dispense with the duties of greatness, knowing well that they\nare now but the shadow of it. The fathers retain the inherent politeness\nof their vanished grandeur, like the mountain-tops still gilded by the\nsun when all is twilight in the valley.\n\nErnest was at last able to slip a word into Modeste's ear, and she rose\nimmediately.\n\n\"My dear,\" said the duchesse, thinking she was going to dress, and\npulling a bell-rope, \"they shall show you your apartment.\"\n\nErnest accompanied Modeste to the foot of the grand staircase,\npresenting the request of the luckless poet, and endeavoring to touch\nher feelings by describing Melchior's agony.\n\n\"You see, he loves--he is a captive who thought he could break his\nchain.\"\n\n\"Love in such a rapid seeker after fortune!\" retorted Modeste.\n\n\"Mademoiselle, you are at the entrance of life; you do not know its\ndefiles. The inconsistencies of a man who falls under the dominion of a\nwoman much older than himself should be forgiven, for he is really not\naccountable. Think how many sacrifices Canalis has made to her. He\nhas sown too much seed of that kind to resign the harvest; the duchess\nrepresents to him ten years of devotion and happiness. You made him\nforget all that, and unfortunately, he has more vanity than pride; he\ndid not reflect on what he was losing until he met Madame Chaulieu here\nto-day. If you really understood him, you would help him. He is a child,\nalways mismanaging his life. You call him a seeker after fortune, but\nhe seeks very badly; like all poets, he is a victim of sensations; he\nis childish, easily dazzled like a child by anything that shines, and\npursuing its glitter. He used to love horses and pictures, and he craved\nfame,--well, he sold his pictures to buy armor and old furniture of the\nRenaissance and Louis XV.; just now he is seeking political power. Admit\nthat his hobbies are noble things.\"\n\n\"You have said enough,\" replied Modeste; \"come,\" she added, seeing her\nfather, whom she called with a motion of her head to give her his arm;\n\"come with me, and I will give you that scrap of paper; you shall carry\nit to the great man and assure him of my condescension to his wishes,\nbut on one condition,--you must thank him in my name for the pleasure I\nhave taken in seeing one of the finest of the German plays performed in\nmy honor. I have learned that Goethe's masterpiece is neither Faust\nnor Egmont--\" and then, as Ernest looked at the malicious girl with a\npuzzled air, she added: \"It is Torquato Tasso! Tell Monsieur de Canalis\nto re-read it,\" she added smiling; \"I particularly desire that you\nwill repeat to your friend word for word what I say; for it is not an\nepigram, it is the justification of his conduct,--with this trifling\ndifference, that he will, I trust, become more and more reasonable,\nthanks to the folly of his Eleonore.\"\n\nThe duchess's head-woman conducted Modeste and her father to their\napartment, where Francoise Cochet had already put everything in order,\nand the choice elegance of which astounded the colonel, more especially\nafter he heard from Francoise that there were thirty other apartments in\nthe chateau decorated with the same taste.\n\n\"This is what I call a proper country-house,\" said Modeste.\n\n\"The Comte de La Bastie must build you one like it,\" replied her father.\n\n\"Here, monsieur,\" said Modeste, giving the bit of paper to Ernest;\n\"carry it to our friend and put him out of his misery.\"\n\nThe word _our_ friend struck the young man's heart. He looked at Modeste\nto see if there was anything real in the community of interests which\nshe seemed to admit, and she, understanding perfectly what his look\nmeant, added, \"Come, go at once, your friend is waiting.\"\n\nLa Briere colored excessively, and left the room in a state of doubt and\nanxiety less endurable than despair. The path that approaches happiness\nis, to the true lover, like the narrow way which Catholic poetry has\ncalled the entrance to Paradise,--expressing thus a dark and gloomy\npassage, echoing with the last cries of earthly anguish.\n\nAn hour later this illustrious company were all assembled in the\nsalon; some were playing whist, others conversing; the women had their\nembroideries in hand, and all were waiting the announcement of dinner.\nThe Prince de Cadignan was drawing Monsieur Mignon out upon China,\nand his campaigns under the empire, and making him talk about the\nPortendueres, the L'Estorades, and the Maucombes, Provencal families; he\nblamed him for not seeking service, and assured him that nothing would\nbe easier than to restore him to his rank as colonel of the Guard.\n\n\"A man of your birth and your fortune ought not to belong to the present\nOpposition,\" said the prince, smiling.\n\nThis society of distinguished persons not only pleased Modeste, but it\nenabled her to acquire, during her stay, a perfection of manners which\nwithout this revelation she would have lacked all her life. Show a clock\nto an embryo mechanic, and you reveal to him the whole mechanism; he\nthus develops the germs of his faculty which lie dormant within him.\nIn like manner Modeste had the instinct to appropriate the distinctive\nqualities of Madame de Maufrigneuse and Madame de Chaulieu. For her, the\nsight of these women was an education; whereas a bourgeois would merely\nhave ridiculed their ways or made them absurd by clumsy imitation. A\nwell-born, well-educated, and right-minded young woman like Modeste\nfell naturally into connection with these people, and saw at once the\ndifferences that separate the aristocratic world from the bourgeois\nworld, the provinces from the faubourg Saint-Germain; she caught the\nalmost imperceptible shadings; in short, she perceived the grace of the\n\"grande dame\" without doubting that she could herself acquire it. She\nnoticed also that her father and La Briere appeared infinitely better\nin this Olympus than Canalis. The great poet, abdicating his real\nand incontestable power, that of the mind, became nothing more than\na courtier seeking a ministry, intriguing for an order, and forced to\nplease the whole galaxy. Ernest de La Briere, without ambitions, was\nable to be himself; while Melchior became, to use a vulgar expression,\na mere toady, and courted the Prince de Loudon, the Duc de Rhetore, the\nVicomte de Serizy, or the Duc de Maufrigneuse, like a man not free\nto assert himself, as did Colonel Mignon, who was justly proud of his\ncampaigns, and of the confidence of the Emperor Napoleon. Modeste took\nnote of the strained efforts of the man of real talent, seeking some\nwitticism that should raise a laugh, some clever speech, some compliment\nwith which to flatter these grand personages, whom it was his interest\nto please. In a word, to Modeste's eyes the peacock plucked out his\ntail-feathers.\n\nToward the middle of the evening the young girl sat down with the grand\nequerry in a corner of the salon. She led him there purposely to end\na suit which she could no longer encourage if she wished to retain her\nself-respect.\n\n\"Monsieur le duc, if you really knew me,\" she said, \"you would\nunderstand how deeply I am touched by your attentions. It is because of\nthe profound respect I feel for your character, and the friendship which\na soul like yours inspires in mine, that I cannot endure to wound your\nself-love. Before your arrival in Havre I loved sincerely, deeply, and\nforever, one who is worthy of being loved, and my affection for whom\nis still a secret; but I wish you to know--and in saying this I am\nmore sincere than most young girls--that had I not already formed this\nvoluntary attachment, you would have been my choice, for I recognize\nyour noble and beautiful qualities. A few words which your aunt and\nsister have said to me as to your intentions lead me to make this frank\navowal. If you think it desirable, a letter from my mother shall recall\nme, on pretence of her illness, to-morrow morning before the hunt\nbegins. Without your consent I do not choose to be present at a fete\nwhich I owe to your kindness, and where, if my secret should escape me,\nyou might feel hurt and defrauded. You will ask me why I have come here\nat all. I could not withstand the invitation. Be generous enough not to\nreproach me for what was almost a necessary curiosity. But this is not\nthe chief, not the most delicate thing I have to say to you. You have\nfirm friends in my father and myself,--more so than perhaps you realize;\nand as my fortune was the first cause that brought you to me, I wish\nto say--but without intending to use it as a sedative to calm the grief\nwhich gallantry requires you to testify--that my father has thought\nover the affair of the marshes, his friend Dumay thinks your project\nfeasible, and they have already taken steps to form a company.\nGobenheim, Dumay, and my father have subscribed fifteen hundred thousand\nfrancs, and undertake to get the rest from capitalists, who will feel\nit in their interest to take up the matter. If I have not the honor\nof becoming the Duchesse d'Herouville, I have almost the certainty of\nenabling you to choose her, free from all trammels in your choice,\nand in a higher sphere than mine. Oh! let me finish,\" she cried, at a\ngesture from the duke.\n\n\"Judging by my nephew's emotion,\" whispered Mademoiselle d'Herouville to\nher niece, \"it is easy to see you have a sister.\"\n\n\"Monsieur le duc, all this was settled in my mind the day of our first\nride, when I heard you deplore your situation. This is what I have\nwished to say to you. That day determined my future life. Though you\ndid not make the conquest of a woman, you have at least gained faithful\nfriends at Ingouville--if you will deign to accord us that title.\"\n\nThis little discourse, which Modeste had carefully thought over,\nwas said with so much charm of soul that the tears came to the grand\nequerry's eyes; he seized her hand and kissed it.\n\n\"Stay during the hunt,\" he said; \"my want of merit has accustomed me\nto these refusals; but while accepting your friendship and that of the\ncolonel, you must let me satisfy myself by the judgment of competent\nscientific men, that the draining of those marshes will be no risk to\nthe company you speak of, before I agree to the generous offer of your\nfriends. You are a noble girl, and though my heart aches to think I can\nonly be your friend, I will glory in that title, and prove it to you at\nall times and in all seasons.\"\n\n\"In that case, Monsieur le duc, let us keep our secret. My choice will\nnot be known, at least I think not, until after my mother's complete\nrecovery. I should like our first blessing to come from her eyes.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX. CONCLUSION\n\n\"Ladies,\" said the Prince de Cadignan, as the guests were about to\nseparate for the night, \"I know that several of you propose to follow\nthe hounds with us to-morrow, and it becomes my duty to tell you that if\nyou will be Dianas you must rise, like Diana, with the dawn. The meet is\nfor half-past eight o'clock. I have in the course of my life seen many\nwomen display greater courage than men, but for a few seconds only; and\nyou will need a strong dose of resolution to keep you on horseback the\nwhole day, barring a halt for breakfast, which we shall take, like true\nhunters and huntresses, on the nail. Are you still determined to show\nyourselves trained horse-women?\"\n\n\"Prince, it is necessary for me to do so,\" said Modeste, adroitly.\n\n\"I answer for myself,\" said the Duchesse de Chaulieu.\n\n\"And I for my daughter Diane; she is worthy of her name,\" added the\nprince. \"So, then, you all persist in your intentions? However, I shall\narrange, for the sake of Madame and Mademoiselle de Verneuil and others\nof the party who stay at home, to drive the stag to the further end of\nthe pond.\"\n\n\"Make yourself quite easy, mesdames,\" said the Prince de Loudon, when\nthe Royal Huntsman had left the room; \"that breakfast 'on the nail' will\ntake place under a comfortable tent.\"\n\nThe next day, at dawn, all signs gave promise of a glorious day. The\nskies, veiled by a slight gray vapor, showed spaces of purest blue, and\nwould surely be swept clear before mid-day by the northwest wind, which\nwas already playing with the fleecy cloudlets. As the hunting party left\nthe chateau, the Master of the Hunt, the Duc de Rhetore, and the Prince\nde Loudon, who had no ladies to escort, rode in the advance, noticing\nthe white masses of the chateau, with its rising chimneys relieved\nagainst the brilliant red-brown foliage which the trees in Normandy put\non at the close of a fine autumn.\n\n\"The ladies are fortunate in their weather,\" remarked the Duc de\nRhetore.\n\n\"Oh, in spite of all their boasting,\" replied the Prince de Cadignan, \"I\nthink they will let us hunt without them!\"\n\n\"So they might, if each had not a squire,\" said the duke.\n\nAt this moment the attention of these determined huntsmen--for the\nPrince de Loudon and the Duc de Rhetore are of the race of Nimrod, and\nthe best shots of the faubourg Saint-Germain--was attracted by a loud\naltercation; and they spurred their horses to an open space at the\nentrance to the forest of Rosembray, famous for its mossy turf, which\nwas appointed for the meet. The cause of the quarrel was soon apparent.\nThe Prince de Loudon, afflicted with anglomania, had brought out his own\nhunting establishment, which was exclusively Britannic, and placed it\nunder orders of the Master of the Hunt. Now, one of his men, a little\nEnglishman,--fair, pale, insolent, and phlegmatic, scarcely able to\nspeak a word of French, and dressed with a neatness which distinguishes\nall Britons, even those of the lower classes,--had posted himself on one\nside of this open space. John Barry wore a short frock-coat, buttoned\ntightly at the waist, made of scarlet cloth, with buttons bearing the De\nVerneuil arms, white leather breeches, top-boots, a striped waistcoat,\nand a collar and cape of black velvet. He held in his hand a small\nhunting-whip, and hanging to his wrist by a silken cord was a\nbrass horn. This man, the first whipper-in, was accompanied by two\nthorough-bred dogs,--fox-hounds, white, with liver spots, long in the\nleg, fine in the muzzle, with slender heads, and little ears at their\ncrests. The huntsman--famous in the English county from which the\nPrince de Loudon had obtained him at great cost--was in charge of an\nestablishment of fifteen horses and sixty English hounds, which cost the\nDuc de Verneuil, who was nothing of a huntsman, but chose to indulge his\nson in this essentially royal taste, an enormous sum of money to keep\nup.\n\nNow, when John arrived on the ground, he found himself forestalled by\nthree other whippers-in, in charge of two of the royal packs of hounds\nwhich had been brought there in carts. They were the three best huntsmen\nof the Prince de Cadignan, and presented, both in character and in their\ndistinctively French costume, a marked contrast to the representative\nof insolent Albion. These favorites of the Prince, each wearing\nfull-brimmed, three-cornered hats, very flat and very wide-spreading,\nbeneath which grinned their swarthy, tanned, and wrinkled faces, lighted\nby three pairs of twinkling eyes, were noticeably lean, sinewy, and\nvigorous, like men in whom sport had become a passion. All three were\nsupplied with immense horns of Dampierre, wound with green worsted\ncords, leaving only the brass tubes visible; but they controlled their\ndogs by the eye and voice. Those noble animals were far more faithful\nand submissive subjects than the human lieges whom the king was at that\nmoment addressing; all were marked with white, black, or liver spots,\neach having as distinctive a countenance as the soldiers of Napoleon,\ntheir eyes flashing like diamonds at the slightest noise. One of them,\nbrought from Poitou, was short in the back, deep in the shoulder,\nlow-jointed, and lop-eared; the other, from England, white, fine as a\ngreyhound with no belly, small ears, and built for running. Both were\nyoung, impatient, and yelping eagerly, while the old hounds, on the\ncontrary, covered with scars, lay quietly with their heads on their\nforepaws, and their ears to the earth like savages.\n\nAs the Englishman came up, the royal dogs and huntsmen looked at each\nother as though they said, \"If we cannot hunt by ourselves his Majesty's\nservice is insulted.\"\n\nBeginning with jests, the quarrel presently grew fiercer between\nMonsieur Jacquin La Roulie, the old French whipper-in, and John Barry,\nthe young islander. The two princes guessed from afar the subject of\nthe altercation, and the Master of the Hunt, setting spurs to his horse,\nbrought it to an end by saying, in a voice of authority:--\n\n\"Who drew the wood?\"\n\n\"I, monseigneur,\" said the Englishman.\n\n\"Very good,\" said the Prince de Cadignan, proceeding to take Barry's\nreport.\n\nDogs and men became silent and respectful before the Royal Huntsman, as\nthough each recognized his dignity as supreme. The prince laid out the\nday's work; for it is with a hunt as it is with a battle, and the\nMaster of Charles X.'s hounds was the Napoleon of forests. Thanks to the\nadmirable system which he has introduced into French venery, he was able\nto turn his thoughts exclusively to the science and strategy of it.\nHe now quietly assigned a special duty to the Prince de Loudon's\nestablishment, that of driving the stag to water, when, as he expected,\nthe royal hounds had sent it into the Crown forest which outlined the\nhorizon directly in front of the chateau. The prince knew well how to\nsoothe the self-love of his old huntsmen by giving them the most arduous\npart of the work, and also that of the Englishman, whom he employed at\nhis own speciality, affording him a chance to show the fleetness of his\nhorses and dogs in the open. The two national systems were thus face to\nface and allowed to do their best under each other's eyes.\n\n\"Does monseigneur wish us to wait any longer?\" said La Roulie,\nrespectfully.\n\n\"I know what you mean, old friend,\" said the prince. \"It is late, but--\"\n\n\"Here come the ladies,\" said the second whipper-in.\n\nAt that moment the cavalcade of sixteen riders was seen to approach\nat the head of which were the green veils of the four ladies. Modeste,\naccompanied by her father, the grand equerry, and La Briere, was in the\nadvance, beside the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse whom the Vicomte de Serizy\nescorted. Behind them rode the Duchesse de Chaulieu, flanked by Canalis,\non whom she was smiling without a trace of rancor. When they had reached\nthe open space where the huntsmen with their red coats and brass bugles,\nsurrounded by the hounds, made a picture worthy of Van der Meulen, the\nDuchesse de Chaulieu, who, in spite of her embonpoint, sat her horse\nadmirably, rode up to Modeste, finding it more for her dignity not to\navoid that young person, to whom the evening before she had not said a\nsingle word.\n\nWhen the Master of the Hunt finished his compliments to the ladies on\ntheir amazing punctuality, Eleonore deigned to observe the magnificent\nwhip which sparked in Modeste's little hand, and graciously asked leave\nto look at it.\n\n\"I have never seen anything of the kind more beautiful,\" she said,\nshowing it to Diane de Maufrigneuse. \"It is in keeping with its\npossessor,\" she added, returning it to Modeste.\n\n\"You must admit, Madame la duchesse,\" answered Mademoiselle de La\nBastie, with a tender and malicious glance at La Briere, \"that it is a\nrather strange gift from the hand of a future husband.\"\n\n\"I should take it,\" said Madame de Maufrigneuse, \"as a declaration of my\nrights, in remembrance of Louis XIV.\"\n\nLa Briere's eyes were suffused, and for a moment he dropped his\nreins; but a second glance from Modeste ordered him not to betray his\nhappiness. The hunt now began.\n\nThe Duc d'Herouville took occasion to say in a low voice to his\nfortunate rival; \"Monsieur, I hope that you will make your wife happy;\nif I can be useful to you in any way, command my services; I should be\nonly too glad to contribute to the happiness of so charming a pair.\"\n\nThis great day, in which such vast interests of heart and fortune were\ndecided, caused but one anxiety to the Master of the Hunt,--namely,\nwhether or not the stag would cross the pond and be killed on the\nlawn before the house; for huntsmen of his calibre are like great\nchess-players who can predict a checkmate under certain circumstances.\nThe happy old man succeeded to the height of his wishes; the run was\nmagnificent, and the ladies released him from his attendance upon them\nfor the hunt of the next day but one,--which, however, turned out to be\nrainy.\n\nThe Duc de Verneuil's guests stayed five days at Rosembray. On the last\nday the Gazette de France announced the appointment of Monsieur le Baron\nde Canalis to the rank of commander of the Legion of honor, and to the\npost of minister at Carlsruhe.\n\nWhen, early in the month of December, Madame de La Bastie, operated upon\nby Desplein, recovered her sight and saw Ernest de La Briere for the\nfirst time, she pressed Modeste's hand and whispered in her ear, \"I\nshould have chosen him myself.\"\n\nToward the last of February all the deeds for the estates in Provence\nwere signed by Latournelle, and about that time the family of La Bastie\nobtained the marked honor of the king's signature to the marriage\ncontract and to the ordinance transmitting their title and arms to La\nBriere, who henceforth took the name of La Briere-La Bastie. The estate\nof La Bastie was entailed by letters-patent issued about the end of\nApril. La Briere's witnesses on the occasion of his marriage were\nCanalis and the minister whom he had served for five years as secretary.\nThose of the bride were the Duc d'Herouville and Desplein, whom the\nMignons long held in grateful remembrance, after giving him magnificent\nand substantial proofs of their regard.\n\nLater, in the course of this long history of our manners and customs, we\nmay again meet Monsieur and Madame de La Briere-La Bastie; and those\nwho have the eyes to see, will then behold how sweet, how easy, is the\nmarriage yoke with an educated and intelligent woman; for Modeste, who\nhad the wit to avoid the follies of pedantry, is the pride and happiness\nof her husband, as she is of her family and of all those who surround\nher.\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM\n\nThe following personages appear in other stories of the Human Comedy.\n\nBeaupre, Fanny  A Start in Life\n  The Muse of the Department\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n\nBixiou, Jean-Jacques  The Purse\n  A Bachelor's Establishment\n  The Government Clerks\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n  The Firm of Nucingen\n  The Muse of the Department\n  Cousin Betty\n  The Member for Arcis\n  Beatrix\n  A Man of Business\n  Gaudissart II.\n  The Unconscious Humorists\n  Cousin Pons\n\nBlondet, Emile  Jealousies of a Country Town\n  A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n  Another Study of Woman\n  The Secrets of a Princess\n  A Daughter of Eve\n  The Firm of Nucingen\n  The Peasantry\n\nBridau, Joseph  The Purse\n  A Bachelor's Establishment\n  A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n  A Start in Life\n  Another Study of Woman\n  Pierre Grassou\n  Letters of Two Brides\n  Cousin Betty\n  The Member for Arcis\n\nCadignan, Prince de  The Secrets of a Princess\n\nCanalis, Constant-Cyr-Melchior, Baron de  Letters of Two Brides\n  A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n  The Magic Skin\n  Another Study of Woman\n  A Start in Life\n  Beatrix\n  The Unconscious Humorists\n  The Member for Arcis\n\nChatillonest, De  A Woman of Thirty\n\nChaulieu, Henri, Duc de  Letters of Two Brides\n  A Bachelor's Establishment\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n  The Thirteen\n\nDauriat  A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n\nDesplein  The Atheist's Mass\n  Cousin Pons\n  Lost Illusions\n  The Thirteen\n  The Government Clerks\n  Pierrette\n  A Bachelor's Establishment\n  The Seamy Side of History\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n  Honorine\n\nEstourny, Charles d'  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n  A Man of Business\n\nFontaine, Comte de  The Chouans\n  The Ball at Sceaux\n  Cesar Birotteau\n  The Government Clerks\n\nGrandlieu, Duc Ferdinand de  The Gondreville Mystery\n  The Thirteen\n  A Bachelor's Establishment\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n\nHerouville, Duc d'  The Hated Son\n  Jealousies of a Country Town\n  Cousin Betty\n\nLa Bastie la Briere, Ernest de  The Government Clerks\n\nLa Bastie la Briere, Madame Ernest de (Modeste)  The Member for Arcis\n  Cousin Betty\n\nLoudon, Prince de  The Chouans\n\nMarsay, Henri de  The Thirteen\n  The Unconscious Humorists\n  Another Study of Woman\n  The Lily of the Valley\n  Father Goriot\n  Jealousies of a Country Town\n  Ursule Mirouet\n  A Marriage Settlement\n  Lost Illusions\n  A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n  Letters of Two Brides\n  The Ball at Sceaux\n  The Secrets of a Princess\n  The Gondreville Mystery\n  A Daughter of Eve\n\nMaufrigneuse, Duchesse de  The Secrets of a Princess\n  Jealousies of a Country Town\n  The Muse of the Department\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n  Letters of Two Brides\n  Another Study of Woman\n  The Gondreville Mystery\n  The Member for Arcis\n\nNucingen, Baronne Delphine de  Father Goriot\n  The Thirteen\n  Eugenie Grandet\n  Cesar Birotteau\n  Melmoth Reconciled\n  Lost Illusions\n  A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n  The Commission in Lunacy\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n  The Firm of Nucingen\n  Another Study of Woman\n  A Daughter of Eve\n  The Member for Arcis\n\nSchinner, Hippolyte  The Purse\n  A Bachelor's Establishment\n  Pierre Grassou\n  A Start in Life\n  Albert Savarus\n  The Government Clerks\n  The Imaginary Mistress\n  The Unconscious Humorists\n\nSerizy, Comte Hugret de  A Start in Life\n  A Bachelor's Establishment\n  Honorine\n  Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n\nSerizy, Vicomte de  A Start in Life\n  The Imaginary Mistress\n\nSommervieux, Theodore de  At the Sign of the Cat and Racket\n  The Government Clerks\n\nStidmann  Beatrix\n  The Member for Arcis\n  Cousin Betty\n  Cousin Pons\n  The Unconscious Humorists\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Modeste Mignon, by Honore de Balzac\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MODESTE MIGNON ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1482.txt or 1482.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/4\/8\/1482\/\n\nProduced by John Bickers, and Dagny\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":735,"split":"train"}
