Ginger inspires fear in their mouse customers and Pickles their rabbit customers. Ginger's mouth waters as the mice leave the shop with their parcels. The two extend unlimited credit to customers who never pay. The till remains empty. The shopkeepers are forced to eat their own goods.\nPickles cannot afford a dog license and is frightened of the policeman (a German doll with a stitched-on hat). He is certain he will receive a summons. The two go over their records and think their customers will never pay them. When the policeman delivers the rates and taxes at the New Year, Ginger and Pickles decide to close shop thus creating great inconvenience for the villagers. Ginger grows stout living comfortably in a warren and is shown in one illustration setting traps. Pickles becomes a gamekeeper who is shown pursuing rabbits.\nIn the tale's lengthy coda, Tabitha Twitchit, the proprietor of the only other village shop, exploits the situation and raises the prices of everything in her shop. She refuses to give credit. Mr. John Dormouse and his daughter Miss Dormouse sell peppermints and candles, but the candles \"behave very strangely in warm weather\" and Miss Dormouse refuses to accept the return of candle ends from disgruntled customers.\nFinally, Sally Henny-penny sends out a printed poster announcing her intention to re-open the shop. The villagers are delighted and overwhelm the shop on its first day. Sally gets flustered counting out change and insists on being paid cash but offers an assortment of bargains to the delight of everybody.\nPotter put a crowd of familiar characters from the Peter Rabbit universe into the tale such as Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, Samuel Whiskers and Peter himself. It would prove a clever marketing device. From the literary angle, the many familiar characters create tension and suspense for the reader as most are the natural prey of the eponymous merchants. The reader wonders if the two shopkeepers will control their predatory instincts long enough to make a sale.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's The Tale of Ginger and Pickles, by Beatrix Potter\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

The name over the window was\n\"Ginger and Pickles.\"\n\nIt was a little small shop just the right size for Dolls--Lucinda and Jane\nDoll-cook always bought their groceries at Ginger and Pickles.\n\nThe counter inside was a convenient height for rabbits. Ginger and\nPickles sold red spotty pocket-handkerchiefs at a penny three farthings.\n\nThey also sold sugar, and snuff and galoshes.\n\nIn fact, although it was such a small shop it sold nearly\neverything--except a few things that you want in a hurry--like bootlaces,\nhair-pins and mutton chops.\n\nGinger and Pickles were the people who kept the shop. Ginger was a yellow\ntom-cat, and Pickles was a terrier.\n\nThe rabbits were always a little bit afraid of Pickles.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe shop was also patronized by mice--only the mice were rather afraid of\nGinger.\n\nGinger usually requested Pickles to serve them, because he said it made\nhis mouth water.\n\n\"I cannot bear,\" said he, \"to see them going out at the door carrying\ntheir little parcels.\"\n\n\"I have the same feeling about rats,\" replied Pickles, \"but it would\nnever do to eat our own customers; they would leave us and go to Tabitha\nTwitchit's.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, they would go nowhere,\" replied Ginger gloomily.\n\n(Tabitha Twitchit kept the only other shop in the village. She did not\ngive credit.)\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nGinger and Pickles gave unlimited credit.\n\nNow the meaning of \"credit\" is this--when a customer buys a bar of soap,\ninstead of the customer pulling out a purse and paying for it--she says\nshe will pay another time.\n\nAnd Pickles makes a low bow and says, \"With pleasure, madam,\" and it is\nwritten down in a book.\n\nThe customers come again and again, and buy quantities, in spite of being\nafraid of Ginger and Pickles.\n\nBut there is no money in what is called the \"till.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe customers came in crowds every day and bought quantities, especially\nthe toffee customers. But there was always no money; they never paid for\nas much as a pennyworth of peppermints.\n\nBut the sales were enormous, ten times as large as Tabitha Twitchit's.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAs there was always no money, Ginger and Pickles were obliged to eat\ntheir own goods.\n\nPickles ate biscuits and Ginger ate a dried haddock.\n\nThey ate them by candle-light after the shop was closed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWhen it came to Jan. 1st there was still no money, and Pickles was unable\nto buy a dog licence.\n\n\"It is very unpleasant, I am afraid of the police,\" said Pickles.\n\n\"It is your own fault for being a terrier; _I_ do not require a licence,\nand neither does Kep, the Collie dog.\"\n\n\"It is very uncomfortable, I am afraid I shall be summoned. I have tried\nin vain to get a licence upon credit at the Post Office;\" said Pickles.\n\"The place is full of policemen. I met one as I was coming home.\"\n\n\"Let us send in the bill again to Samuel Whiskers, Ginger, he owes 22\/9\nfor bacon.\"\n\n\"I do not believe that he intends to pay at all,\" replied Ginger.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"And I feel sure that Anna Maria pockets things--Where are all the cream\ncrackers?\"\n\n\"You have eaten them yourself,\" replied Ginger.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nGinger and Pickles retired into the back parlour.\n\nThey did accounts. They added up sums and sums, and sums.\n\n\"Samuel Whiskers has run up a bill as long as his tail; he has had an\nounce and three-quarters of snuff since October.\"\n\n\"What is seven pounds of butter at 1\/3, and a stick of sealing wax and\nfour matches?\"\n\n\"Send in all the bills again to everybody 'with comp'ts,'\" replied Ginger.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAfter a time they heard a noise in the shop, as if something had been\npushed in at the door. They came out of the back parlour. There was an\nenvelope lying on the counter, and a policeman writing in a note-book!\n\nPickles nearly had a fit, he barked and he barked and made little rushes.\n\n\"Bite him, Pickles! bite him!\" spluttered Ginger behind a sugar-barrel,\n\"he's only a German doll!\"\n\nThe policeman went on writing in his notebook; twice he put his pencil in\nhis mouth, and once he dipped it in the treacle.\n\nPickles barked till he was hoarse. But still the policeman took no notice.\nHe had bead eyes, and his helmet was sewed on with stitches.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAt length on his last little rush--Pickles found that the shop was empty.\nThe policeman had disappeared.\n\nBut the envelope remained.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Do you think that he has gone to fetch a real live policeman? I am afraid\nit is a summons,\" said Pickles.\n\n\"No,\" replied Ginger, who had opened the envelope, \"it is the rates and\ntaxes, \u00c2\u00a33 19 11-3\/4.\"\n\n\"This is the last straw,\" said Pickles, \"let us close the shop.\"\n\nThey put up the shutters, and left. But they have not removed from the\nneighbourhood. In fact some people wish they had gone further.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nGinger is living in the warren. I do not know what occupation he pursues;\nhe looks stout and comfortable.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nPickles is at present a gamekeeper.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe closing of the shop caused great inconvenience. Tabitha Twitchit\nimmediately raised the price of everything a half-penny; and she continued\nto refuse to give credit.\n\nOf course there are the trades-men's carts--the butcher, the fish-man and\nTimothy Baker.\n\nBut a person cannot live on \"seed wigs\" and sponge-cake and\nbutter-buns--not even when the sponge-cake is as good as Timothy's!\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAfter a time Mr. John Dormouse and his daughter began to sell peppermints\nand candles.\n\nBut they did not keep \"self-fitting sixes\"; and it takes five mice to\ncarry one seven inch candle.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBesides--the candles which they sell behave very strangely in warm\nweather.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAnd Miss Dormouse refused to take back the ends when they were brought\nback to her with complaints.\n\nAnd when Mr. John Dormouse was complained to, he stayed in bed, and would\nsay nothing but \"very snug;\" which is not the way to carry on a retail\nbusiness.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nSo everybody was pleased when Sally Henny Penny sent out a printed poster\nto say that she was going to re-open the shop--\"Henny's Opening Sale!\nGrand co-operative Jumble! Penny's penny prices! Come buy, come try, come\nbuy!\"\n\nThe poster really was most 'ticing.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThere was a rush upon the opening day. The shop was crammed with\ncustomers, and there were crowds of mice upon the biscuit canisters.\n\nSally Henny Penny gets rather flustered when she tries to count out\nchange, and she insists on being paid cash; but she is quite harmless.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAnd she has laid in a remarkable assortment of bargains.\n\nThere is something to please everybody.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Tale of Ginger and Pickles, by Beatrix Potter\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TALE OF GINGER AND PICKLES ***\n\n***** This file should be named 14877-8.txt or 14877-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/4\/8\/7\/14877\/\n\nProduced by Robert Cicconetti, Melissa Er-Raqabi and the PG Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team.\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1432,"split":"test"}
