Ilion is ablaze; the fire consumes the citadel, the roofs of our city, the tops of the walls!\nChorus: Like smoke blown to heaven on the wings of the wind, our country, our conquered country, perishes. Its palaces are overrun by the fierce flames and the murderous spear.\n\nHecuba: O land that reared my children!\nEuripides's play follows the fates of the women of Troy after their city has been sacked, their husbands killed, and as their remaining families are about to be taken away as slaves. However, it begins first with the gods Athena and Poseidon discussing ways to punish the Greek armies because they condoned that Ajax the Lesser raped Cassandra, the eldest daughter of King Priam and Queen Hecuba, after dragging her from a statue of Athena. What follows shows how much the Trojan women have suffered as their grief is compounded when the Greeks dole out additional deaths and divide their shares of women.\nThe Greek herald Talthybius arrives to tell the dethroned queen Hecuba what will befall her and her children. Hecuba will be taken away with the Greek general Odysseus, and Cassandra is destined to become the conquering general Agamemnon's concubine.\nCassandra, who can see the future, is morbidly delighted by this news: she sees that when they arrive in Argos, her new master's embittered wife Clytemnestra will kill both her and her new master. However, Cassandra is also cursed so that her visions of the future are never believed, and she is carried off.\nThe widowed princess Andromache arrives and Hecuba learns from her that her youngest daughter, Polyxena, has been killed as a sacrifice at the tomb of the Greek warrior Achilles.\nAndromache's lot is to be the concubine of Achilles' son Neoptolemus, and more horrible news for the royal family is yet to come: Talthybius reluctantly informs her that her baby son, Astyanax, has been condemned to die. The Greek leaders are afraid that the boy will grow up to avenge his father Hector, and rather than take this chance, they plan to throw him off from the battlements of Troy to his death.\nHelen, though not one of the Trojan women, is supposed to suffer greatly as well: Menelaus arrives to take her back to Greece with him where a death sentence awaits her. Helen begs and tries to seduce her husband into sparing her life. Menelaus remains resolved to kill her, but the audience watching the play knows that he will let her live and take her back. At the end of the play it is revealed that she is still alive; moreover, the audience knows from Telemachus' visit of Sparta in Homer's Odyssey that Menelaus continued to live with Helen as his wife after the Trojan War.\nIn the end, Talthybius returns, carrying with him the body of little Astyanax on Hector's shield. Andromache's wish had been to bury her child herself, performing the proper rituals according to Trojan ways, but her ship had already departed. Talthybius gives the corpse to Hecuba, who prepares the body of her grandson for burial before they are finally taken off with Odysseus.\nThroughout the play, many of the Trojan women lament the loss of the land that reared them. Hecuba in particular lets it be known that Troy had been her home for her entire life, only to see herself as an old grandmother watching the burning of Troy, the death of her husband, her children, and her grandchildren before she will be taken as a slave to Odysseus.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Trojan women of Euripides, by Euripides\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

In one\nsituation, with little movement, with few figures, it flashes out a\ngreat dramatic lesson, the infinite pathos of a successful wrong. It has\nin it the very soul of the tragic. It even goes beyond the limited\ntragic, and hints that beyond the defeat may come a greater glory than\nwill be the fortune of the victors. And thus through its pity and terror\nit purifies our souls to thoughts of peace.\n\nGreat art has no limits of locality or time. Its tidings are timeless,\nand its messages are universal. _The Trojan Women_ was first performed\nin 415 B.C., from a story of the siege of Troy which even then was\nancient history. But the pathos of it is as modern to us as it was to\nthe Athenians. The terrors of war have not changed in three thousand\nyears. Euripides had that to say of war which we have to say of it\nto-day, and had learned that which we are even now learning, that when\nmost triumphant it brings as much wretchedness to the victors as to the\nvanquished. In this play the great conquest \"seems to be a great joy and\nis in truth a great misery.\" The tragedy of war has in no essential\naltered. The god Poseidon mourns over Troy as he might over the cities\nof to-day, when he cries:\n\n\n\"How are ye blind,\nYe treaders down of cities, ye that cast\nTemples to desolation, and lay waste\nTombs, the untrodden sanctuaries where lie\nThe ancient dead; yourselves so soon to die!\"\n\n\nTo the cities of this present day might the prophetess Cassandra speak\nher message:\n\n\n\"Would ye be wise, ye Cities, fly from war!\nYet if war come, there is a crown in death\nFor her that striveth well and perisheth\nUnstained: to die in evil were the stain!\"\n\n\nA throb of human sympathy as if with one of our sisters of to-day comes\nto us at the end, when the city is destroyed and its queen would throw\nherself, living, into its flames. To be of the action of this play the\nimagination needs not to travel back over three thousand years of\nhistory. It can simply leap a thousand leagues of ocean.\n\nIf ever wars are to be ended, the imagination of man must end them. To\nthe common mind, in spite of all its horrors, there is still something\nglorious in war. Preachers have preached against it in vain; economists\nhave argued against its wastefulness in vain. The imagination of a great\npoet alone can finally show to the imagination of the world that even\nthe glories of war are an empty delusion. Euripides shows us, as the\ncentre of his drama, women battered and broken by inconceivable\ntorture--the widowed Hecuba, Andromache with her child dashed to death,\nCassandra ravished and made mad--yet does he show that theirs are the\nunconquered and unconquerable spirits. The victorious men, flushed with\npride, have remorse and mockery dealt out to them by those they fought\nfor, and go forth to unpitied death. Never surely can a great tragedy\nseem more real to us, or purge our souls more truly of the unreality of\nour thoughts and feelings concerning vital issues, than can The Trojan\nWomen at this moment of the history of the world.\n\nFRANCIS HOVEY STODDARD.\n\n_May the first, 1915_.\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\n\n\nJudged by common standards, the Tro\u00c3\u00a4des is far from a perfect play; it\nis scarcely even a good play. It is an intense study of one great\nsituation, with little plot, little construction, little or no relief or\nvariety. The only movement of the drama is a gradual extinguishing of\nall the familiar lights of human life, with, perhaps, at the end, a\nsuggestion that in the utterness of night, when all fears of a possible\nworse thing are passed, there is in some sense peace and even glory. But\nthe situation itself has at least this dramatic value, that it is\ndifferent from what it seems.\n\nThe consummation of a great conquest, a thing celebrated in paeans and\nthanksgivings, the very height of the day-dreams of unregenerate man--it\nseems to be a great joy, and it is in truth a great misery. It is\nconquest seen when the thrill of battle is over, and nothing remains but\nto wait and think. We feel in the background the presence of the\nconquerors, sinister and disappointed phantoms; of the conquered men,\nafter long torment, now resting in death. But the living drama for\nEuripides lay in the conquered women. It is from them that he has named\nhis play and built up his scheme of parts: four figures clearly lit and\nheroic, the others in varying grades of characterisation, nameless and\nbarely articulate, mere half-heard voices of an eternal sorrow.\n\nIndeed, the most usual condemnation of the play is not that it is dull,\nbut that it is too harrowing; that scene after scene passes beyond the\ndue limits of tragic art. There are points to be pleaded against this\ncriticism. The very beauty of the most fearful scenes, in spite of their\nfearfulness, is one; the quick comfort of the lyrics is another, falling\nlike a spell of peace when the strain is too hard to bear (cf. p. 89).\nBut the main defence is that, like many of the greatest works of art,\nthe _Tro\u00c3\u00a4des_ is something more than art. It is also a prophecy, a\nbearing of witness. And the prophet, bound to deliver his message, walks\noutside the regular ways of the artist.\n\nFor some time before the _Tro\u00c3\u00a4des_ was produced, Athens, now entirely in\nthe hands of the War Party, had been engaged in an enterprise which,\nthough on military grounds defensible, was bitterly resented by the more\nhumane minority, and has been selected by Thucydides as the great\ncrucial crime of the war. She had succeeded in compelling the neutral\nDorian island of M\u00c3\u00aalos to take up arms against her, and after a long\nsiege had conquered the quiet and immemorially ancient town, massacred\nthe men and sold the women and children into slavery. M\u00c3\u00aalos fell in the\nautumn of 416 B.C. The _Tro\u00c3\u00a4des_ was produced in the following spring.\nAnd while the gods of the prologue were prophesying destruction at sea\nfor the sackers of Troy, the fleet of the sackers of M\u00c3\u00aalos, flushed with\nconquest and marked by a slight but unforgettable taint of sacrilege,\nwas actually preparing to set sail for its fatal enterprise against\nSicily.\n\nNot, of course, that we have in the _Tro\u00c3\u00a4des_ a case of political\nallusion. Far from it. Euripides does not mean M\u00c3\u00aalos when he says Troy,\nnor mean Alcibiades' fleet when he speaks of Agamemnon's. But he writes\nunder the influence of a year which to him, as to Thucydides, had been\nfilled full of indignant pity and of dire foreboding. This tragedy is\nperhaps, in European literature, the first great expression of the\nspirit of pity for mankind exalted into a moving principle; a principle\nwhich has made the most precious, and possibly the most destructive,\nelements of innumerable rebellions, revolutions, and martyrdoms, and of\nat least two great religions.\n\nPity is a rebel passion. Its hand is against the strong, against the\norganised force of society, against conventional sanctions and accepted\nGods. It is the Kingdom of Heaven within us fighting against the brute\npowers of the world; and it is apt to have those qualities of unreason,\nof contempt for the counting of costs and the balancing of sacrifices,\nof recklessness, and even, in the last resort, of ruthlessness, which so\noften mark the paths of heavenly things and the doings of the children\nof light. It brings not peace, but a sword.\n\nSo it was with Euripides. The _Tro\u00c3\u00a4des_ itself has indeed almost no\nfierceness and singularly little thought of revenge. It is only the\ncrying of one of the great wrongs of the world wrought into music, as it\nwere, and made beautiful by \"the most tragic of the poets.\" But its\nauthor lived ever after in a deepening atmosphere of strife and even of\nhatred, down to the day when, \"because almost all in Athens rejoiced at\nhis suffering,\" he took his way to the remote valleys of Macedon to\nwrite the _Bacchae_ and to die.\n\nG.

At the\nback are the walls of Troy, partially ruined. In front of them, to right\nand left, are some huts, containing those of the Captive Women who have\nbeen specially set apart for the chief Greek leaders. At one side some\ndead bodies of armed men are visible. In front a tall woman with white\nhair is lying on the ground asleep._\n\n_It is the dusk of early dawn, before sunrise. The figure of the god _\nPOSEIDON _ is dimly seen before the walls._\n\nPOSEIDON.[1]\n\nUp from Aegean caverns, pool by pool\nOf blue salt sea, where feet most beautiful\nOf Nereid maidens weave beneath the foam\nTheir long sea-dances, I, their lord, am come,\nPoseidon of the Sea. 'Twas I whose power,\nWith great Apollo, builded tower by tower\nThese walls of Troy; and still my care doth stand\nTrue to the ancient People of my hand;\nWhich now as smoke is perished, in the shock\nOf Argive spears. Down from Parnassus' rock\nThe Greek Epeios came, of Phocian seed,\nAnd wrought by Pallas' mysteries a Steed\nMarvellous[2], big with arms; and through my wall\nIt passed, a death-fraught image magical.\n  The groves are empty and the sanctuaries\nRun red with blood. Unburied Priam lies\nBy his own hearth, on God's high altar-stair,\nAnd Phrygian gold goes forth and raiment rare\nTo the Argive ships; and weary soldiers roam\nWaiting the wind that blows at last for home,\nFor wives and children, left long years away,\nBeyond the seed's tenth fullness and decay,\nTo work this land's undoing.\n\n     And for me,\nSince Argive Hera conquereth, and she\nWho wrought with Hera to the Phrygians' woe,\nPallas, behold, I bow mine head and go\nForth from great Ilion[3] and mine altars old.\nWhen a still city lieth in the hold\nOf Desolation, all God's spirit there\nIs sick and turns from worship.--Hearken where\nThe ancient River waileth with a voice\nOf many women, portioned by the choice\nOf war amid new lords, as the lots leap\nFor Thessaly, or Argos, or the steep\nOf Theseus' Rock. And others yet there are,\nHigh women, chosen from the waste of war\nFor the great kings, behind these portals hid;\nAnd with them that Laconian Tyndarid[4],\nHelen, like them a prisoner and a prize.\n  And this unhappy one--would any eyes\nGaze now on Hecuba? Here at the Gates\nShe lies 'mid many tears for many fates\nOf wrong. One child beside Achilles' grave\nIn secret slain[5], Polyxena the brave,\nLies bleeding. Priam and his sons are gone;\nAnd, lo, Cassandra[6], she the Chosen One,\nWhom Lord Apollo spared to walk her way\nA swift and virgin spirit, on this day\nLust hath her, and she goeth garlanded\nA bride of wrath to Agamemnon's bed.\n\n[_He turns to go; and another divine Presence\nbecomes visible in the dusk.

These mine hands\nShall stir the waste Aegean; reefs that cross\nThe Delian pathways, jag-torn Myconos,\nScyros and Lemnos, yea, and storm-driven\nCaph\u00c3\u00aareus with the bones of drown\u00c3\u00a8d men\nShall glut him.--Go thy ways, and bid the Sire\nYield to thine hand the arrows of his fire.\nThen wait thine hour, when the last ship shall wind\nHer cable coil for home!

Is it the flare\nOf torches?\n\n[_Light is seen shining through the crevices of the second hut on the\nright.

Yea, if my spirit cowers,\nDrive me with wrath! So liveth Loxias[20],\nA bloodier bride than ever Helen was\nGo I to Agamemnon, Lord most high\nOf Hellas!... I shall kill him, mother; I\nShall kill him, and lay waste his house with fire\nAs he laid ours. My brethren and my sire\nShall win again....[21]\n\n      (_Checking herself_) But part I must let be,\nAnd speak not. Not the axe that craveth me,\nAnd more than me; not the dark wanderings\nOf mother-murder that my bridal brings,\nAnd all the House of Atreus down, down, down....\n\n  Nay, I will show thee. Even now this town\nIs happier than the Greeks. I know the power\nOf God is on me: but this little hour,\nWilt thou but listen, I will hold him back!\n\n  One love, one woman's beauty, o'er the track\nOf hunted Helen, made their myriads fall.\nAnd this their King so wise[22], who ruleth all,\nWhat wrought he? Cast out Love that Hate might feed:\nGave to his brother his own child, his seed\nOf gladness, that a woman fled, and fain\nTo fly for ever, should be turned again!\n\nSo the days waned, and armies on the shore\nOf Simois stood and strove and died. Wherefore?\nNo man had moved their landmarks; none had shook\nTheir wall\u00c3\u00a8d towns.--And they whom Ares took,\nHad never seen their children: no wife came\nWith gentle arms to shroud the limbs of them\nFor burial, in a strange and angry earth\nLaid dead. And there at home, the same long dearth:\nWomen that lonely died, and aged men\nWaiting for sons that ne'er should turn again,\nNor know their graves, nor pour drink-offerings,\nTo still the unslak\u00c3\u00a8d dust. These be the things\nThe conquering Greek hath won!\n\n     But we--what pride,\nWhat praise of men were sweeter?--fighting died\nTo save our people. And when war was red\nAround us, friends upbore the gentle dead\nHome, and dear women's heads about them wound\nWhite shrouds, and here they sleep in the old ground\nBelov\u00c3\u00a8d. And the rest long days fought on,\nDwelling with wives and children, not alone\nAnd joyless, like these Greeks.\n\n     And Hector's woe,\nWhat is it? He is gone, and all men know\nHis glory, and how true a heart he bore.\nIt is the gift the Greek hath brought! Of yore\nMen saw him not, nor knew him. Yea, and even\nParis[23] hath loved withal a child of heaven:\nElse had his love but been as others are.\n  Would ye be wise, ye Cities, fly from war!\nYet if war come, there is a crown in death\nFor her that striveth well and perisheth\nUnstained: to die in evil were the stain!\nTherefore, O Mother, pity not thy slain,\nNor Troy, nor me, the bride. Thy direst foe\nAnd mine by this my wooing is brought low.\n\nTALTHYBIUS (_at last breaking through the spell that has held him_).\n\nI swear, had not Apollo made thee mad,\nNot lightly hadst thou flung this shower of bad\nBodings, to speed my General o'er the seas!\n  'Fore God, the wisdoms and the greatnesses\nOf seeming, are they hollow all, as things\nOf naught? This son of Atreus, of all kings\nMost mighty, hath so bowed him to the love\nOf this mad maid, and chooseth her above\nAll women! By the Gods, rude though I be,\nI would not touch her hand!\n\n     Look thou; I see\nThy lips are blind, and whatso words they speak,\nPraises of Troy or shamings of the Greek,\nI cast to the four winds!

Yet there is something that doth seek,\nCrying, for God, when one of us hath woe.\nO, I will think of things gone long ago\nAnd weave them to a song, like one more tear\nIn the heart of misery....

And sons I brought\nMy lord King, many sons ... nay, that were naught;\nBut high strong princes, of all Troy the best.\nHellas nor Tro\u00c3\u00a4s nor the garnered East\nHeld such a mother! And all these things beneath\nThe Argive spear I saw cast down in death,\nAnd shore these tresses at the dead men's feet.\n  Yea, and the gardener of my garden great,\nIt was not any noise of him nor tale\nI wept for; these eyes saw him, when the pale\nWas broke, and there at the altar Priam fell\nMurdered, and round him all his citadel\nSacked. And my daughters, virgins of the fold,\nMeet to be brides of mighty kings, behold,\n'Twas for the Greek I bred them! All are gone;\nAnd no hope left, that I shall look upon\nTheir faces any more, nor they on mine.\n  And now my feet tread on the utmost line:\nAn old, old slave-woman, I pass below\nMine enemies' gates; and whatso task they know\nFor this age basest, shall be mine; the door,\nBowing, to shut and open....

Not any seed\nOf man nor woman now shall help my need.\n  Why raise me any more? What hope have I\nTo hold me? Take this slave that once trod high\nIn Ilion; cast her on her bed of clay\nRock-pillowed, to lie down, and pass away\nWasted with tears.

And I ... long since I drew my\n  bow\nStraight at the heart of good fame; and I know\nMy shaft hit; and for that am I the more\nFallen from peace. All that men praise us for,\nI loved for Hector's sake, and sought to win.\nI knew that alway, be there hurt therein\nOr utter innocence, to roam abroad\nHath ill report for women; so I trod\nDown the desire thereof, and walked my way\nIn mine own garden. And light words and gay\nParley of women never passed my door.\nThe thoughts of mine own heart ... I craved no more....\n  Spoke with me, and I was happy. Constantly\nI brought fair silence and a tranquil eye\nFor Hector's greeting, and watched well the way\nOf living, where to guide and where obey.\n  And, lo! some rumour of this peace, being gone\nForth to the Greek, hath cursed me. Achilles' son,\nSo soon as I was taken, for his thrall\nChose me. I shall do service in the hall\nOf them that slew.... How? Shall I thrust aside\nHector's beloved face, and open wide\nMy heart to this new lord? Oh, I should stand\nA traitor to the dead!

O my Hector! best beloved,\nThat, being mine, wast all in all to me,\nMy prince, my wise one, O my majesty\nOf valiance! No man's touch had ever come\nNear me, when thou from out my father's home\nDidst lead me and make me thine....

Nor will I tell\nThe lie to mine own heart, that aught is well\nOr shall be well.... Yet, O, to dream were sweet!\n\nLEADER.\n\nThy feet have trod the pathway of my feet,\nAnd thy clear sorrow teacheth me mine own.\n\nHECUBA.\n\nLo, yonder ships: I ne'er set foot on one,\nBut tales and pictures tell, when over them\nBreaketh a storm not all too strong to stem,\nEach man strives hard, the tiller gripped, the mast\nManned, the hull baled, to face it: till at last\nToo strong breaks the o'erwhelming sea: lo, then\nThey cease, and yield them up as broken men\nTo fate and the wild waters. Even so\nI in my many sorrows bear me low,\nNor curse, nor strive that other things may be.\nThe great wave rolled from God hath conquered me.\n  But, O, let Hector and the fates that fell\nOn Hector, sleep. Weep for him ne'er so well,\nThy weeping shall not wake him. Honour thou\nThe new lord that is set above thee now,\nAnd make of thine own gentle piety\nA prize to lure his heart. So shalt thou be\nA strength to them that love us, and--God knows,\nIt may be--rear this babe among his foes,\nMy Hector's child, to manhood and great aid\nFor Ilion.

Hera held a Throne--\nIf majesties he craved--to reign alone\nFrom Phrygia to the last realm of the West.\nAnd Cypris, if he deemed her loveliest,\nBeyond all heaven, made dreams about my face\nAnd for her grace gave me. And, lo! her grace\nWas judged the fairest, and she stood above\nThose twain.--Thus was I loved, and thus my\n  love\nHath holpen Hellas. No fierce Eastern crown\nIs o'er your lands, no spear hath cast them down.\nO, it was well for Hellas! But for me\nMost ill; caught up and sold across the sea\n For this my beauty; yea, dishonour\u00c3\u00a8d\nFor that which else had been about my head\nA crown of honour.... Ah, I see thy thought;\nThe first plain deed, 'tis that I answer not,\nHow in the dark out of thy house I fled....\nThere came the Seed of Fire, this woman's seed;\nCame--O, a Goddess great walked with him then--\nThis Alexander, Breaker-down-of-Men,\nThis Paris[40], Strength-is-with-him; whom thou,\n  whom--\nO false and light of heart--thou in thy room\nDidst leave, and spreadest sail for Cretan seas,\nFar, far from me!... And yet, how strange it is!\nI ask not thee; I ask my own sad thought,\nWhat was there in my heart, that I forgot\nMy home and land and all I loved, to fly\nWith a strange man? Surely it was not I,\nBut Cypris, there! Lay thou thy rod on her,\nAnd be more high than Zeus and bitterer,\nWho o'er all other spirits hath his throne,\nBut knows her chain must bind him. My wrong done\nHath its own pardon....\n\n     One word yet thou hast,\nMethinks, of righteous seeming. When at last\nThe earth for Paris oped and all was o'er,\nAnd her strange magic bound my feet no more,\nWhy kept I still his house, why fled not I\nTo the Argive ships?... Ah, how I strove to fly!\nThe old Gate-Warden[41] could have told thee all,\nMy husband, and the watchers from the wall;\nIt was not once they took me, with the rope\nTied, and this body swung in the air, to grope\nIts way toward thee, from that dim battlement.\n  Ah, husband still, how shall thy hand be bent\nTo slay me? Nay, if Right be come at last,\nWhat shalt thou bring but comfort for pains past,\nAnd harbour for a woman storm-driven:\nA woman borne away by violent men:\nAnd this one birthright of my beauty, this\nThat might have been my glory, lo, it is\nA stamp that God hath burned, of slavery!\n  Alas! and if thou cravest still to be\nAs one set above gods, inviolate,\n'Tis but a fruitless longing holds thee yet.\n\nLEADER.\n\nO Queen, think of thy children and thy land,\nAnd break her spell! The sweet soft speech, the\n  hand\nAnd heart so fell: it maketh me afraid.\n\nHECUBA.\n\nMeseems her goddesses first cry mine aid\nAgainst these lying lips!... Not Hera, nay,\nNor virgin Pallas deem I such low clay,\nTo barter their own folk, Argos and brave\nAthens, to be trod down, the Phrygian's slave,\nAll for vain glory and a shepherd's prize\nOn Ida! Wherefore should great Hera's eyes\nSo hunger to be fair? She doth not use\nTo seek for other loves, being wed with Zeus.\nAnd maiden Pallas ... did some strange god's face\nBeguile her, that she craved for loveliness,\nWho chose from God one virgin gift above\nAll gifts, and fleeth from the lips of love?\n  Ah, deck not out thine own heart's evil springs\nBy making spirits of heaven as brutish things\nAnd cruel. The wise may hear thee, and guess all!\n  And Cypris must take ship-fantastical!\nSail with my son and enter at the gate\nTo seek thee! Had she willed it, she had sate\nAt peace in heaven, and wafted thee, and all\nAmyclae with thee, under Ilion's wall.\n  My son was passing beautiful, beyond\nHis peers; and thine own heart, that saw and conned\nHis face, became a spirit enchanting thee.\nFor all wild things that in mortality\n Have being, are Aphrodit\u00c3\u00aa; and the name\nShe bears in heaven is born and writ of them.\n  Thou sawest him in gold and orient vest\nShining, and lo, a fire about thy breast\nLeapt! Thou hadst fed upon such little things,\nPacing thy ways in Argos. But now wings\nWere come! Once free from Sparta, and there rolled\nThe Ilian glory, like broad streams of gold,\nTo steep thine arms and splash the towers! How\n  small,\nHow cold that day was Menelaus' hall!\n  Enough of that. It was by force my son\nTook thee, thou sayst, and striving.... Yet not one\nIn Sparta knew! No cry, no sudden prayer\nRang from thy rooms that night.... Castor was there\nTo hear thee, and his brother: both true men,\nNot yet among the stars! And after, when\nThou camest here to Troy, and in thy track\nArgos and all its anguish and the rack\nOf war--Ah God!--perchance men told thee 'Now\nThe Greek prevails in battle': then wouldst thou\nPraise Menelaus, that my son might smart,\nStriving with that old image in a heart\nUncertain still. Then Troy had victories:\nAnd this Greek was as naught! Alway thine eyes\nWatched Fortune's eyes, to follow hot where she\nLed first. Thou wouldst not follow Honesty.\n  Thy secret ropes, thy body swung to fall\nFar, like a desperate prisoner, from the wall!\nWho found thee so? When wast thou taken? Nay,\nHadst thou no surer rope, no sudden way\nOf the sword, that any woman honest-souled\nHad sought long since, loving her lord of old?\n  Often and often did I charge thee; 'Go,\nMy daughter; go thy ways. My sons will know\nNew loves. I will give aid, and steal thee past\nThe Argive watch. O give us peace at last,\nUs and our foes!' But out thy spirit cried\nAs at a bitter word. Thou hadst thy pride\nIn Alexander's house, and O, 'twas sweet\nTo hold proud Easterns bowing at thy feet.\nThey were great things to thee!... And comest thou\n  now\nForth, and hast decked thy bosom and thy brow,\nAnd breathest with thy lord the same blue air,\nThou evil heart? Low, low, with ravaged hair,\nRent raiment, and flesh shuddering, and within--\nO shame at last, not glory for thy sin;\nSo face him if thou canst!... Lo, I have done.\nBe true, O King; let Hellas bear her crown\nOf Justice. Slay this woman, and upraise\nThe law for evermore: she that betrays\nHer husband's bed, let her be judged and die.\n\nLEADER.\n\nBe strong, O King; give judgment worthily\nFor thee and thy great house. Shake off thy long\nReproach; not weak, but iron against the wrong!\n\nMENELAUS.\n\nThy thought doth walk with mine in one intent.\n'Tis sure; her heart was willing, when she went\nForth to a stranger's bed. And all her fair\nTale of enchantment, 'tis a thing of air!...\n\n[_Turning furiously upon_ HELEN.\n\nOut, woman! There be those that seek thee yet\nWith stones! Go, meet them.

'Twas a strange murder for brave\n  men!\nFor fear this babe some day might raise again\nHis fallen land! Had ye so little pride?\nWhile Hector fought, and thousands at his side,\nYe smote us, and we perished; and now, now,\nWhen all are dead and Ilion lieth low,\nYe dread this innocent! I deem it not\nWisdom, that rage of fear that hath no thought....\n  Ah, what a death hath found thee, little one!\nHadst thou but fallen fighting, hadst thou known\nStrong youth and love and all the majesty\nOf godlike kings, then had we spoken of thee\nAs of one blessed ... could in any wise\nThese days know blessedness.

And dear proud lips, so full of hope\nAnd closed for ever! What false words ye said\nAt daybreak, when he crept into my bed,\nCalled me kind names, and promised: 'Grandmother,\nWhen thou art dead, I will cut close my hair\nAnd lead out all the captains to ride by\nThy tomb.' Why didst thou cheat me so? 'Tis I,\nOld, homeless, childless, that for thee must shed\nCold tears, so young, so miserably dead.\n  Dear God, the pattering welcomes of thy feet,\nThe nursing in my lap; and O, the sweet\nFalling asleep together!

And there\nI see his handgrip printed on thy hold;\nAnd deep stains of the precious sweat, that rolled\nIn battle from the brows and beard of him,\nDrop after drop, are writ about thy rim.\n  Go, bring them--such poor garments hazardous\nAs these days leave. God hath not granted us\nWherewith to make much pride. But all I can,\nI give thee, Child of Troy.--O vain is man,\nWho glorieth in his joy and hath no fears:\nWhile to and fro the chances of the years\nDance like an idiot in the wind!

This sort of confusion comes from the fact that the Trojans and\ntheir Greek enemies were largely of the same blood, with the same tribal\ngods. To the Trojans, Athena the War-Goddess was, of course, _their_\nWar-Goddess, the protectress of their citadel. Poseidon, god of the sea\nand its merchandise, and Apollo (possibly a local shepherd god?), were\ntheir natural friends and had actually built their city wall for love of\nthe good old king, Laomedon. Zeus, the great father, had Mount Ida for\nhis holy hill and Troy for his peculiar city. (Cf. on p. 63.)\n\nTo suit the Greek point of view all this had to be changed or explained\naway. In the _Iliad_ generally Athena is the proper War-Goddess of the\nGreeks. Poseidon had indeed built the wall for Laomedon, but Laomedon\nhad cheated him of his reward--as afterwards he cheated Heracles, and\nthe Argonauts and everybody else! So Poseidon hated Troy. Troy is\nchiefly defended by the barbarian Ares, the oriental Aphrodite, by its\nown rivers Scamander and Simois and suchlike inferior or unprincipled\ngods.\n\nYet traces of the other tradition remain. Homer knows that Athena is\nspecially worshipped in Troy. He knows that Apollo, who had built the\nwall with Poseidon, and had the same experience of Laomedon, still loves\nthe Trojans. Zeus himself, though eventually in obedience to destiny he\npermits the fall of the city, nevertheless has a great tenderness\ntowards it.\n\n[2] A steed marvellous.]--See below, on p. 36.\n\n[3] go forth from great Ilion, &c.]--The correct ancient doctrine. When\nyour gods forsook you, there was no more hope. Conversely, when your\nstate became desperate, evidently your gods were forsaking you. From\nanother point of view, also, when the city was desolate and unable to\nworship its gods, the gods of that city were no more.\n\n[4] Laotian Tyndarid.]--Helen was the child of Zeus and Leda, and sister\nof Castor and Polydeuces; but her human father was Tyndareus, an old\nSpartan king. She is treated as \"a prisoner and a prize,\" _i.e_., as a\ncaptured enemy, not as a Greek princess delivered from the Trojans.\n\n[5] In secret slain.]--Because the Greeks were ashamed of the bloody\ndeed. See below, p. 42, and the scene on this subject in the _Hecuba_.\n\n[6] Cassandra.]--In the _Agamemnon_ the story is more clearly told, that\nCassandra was loved by Apollo and endowed by him with the power of\nprophecy; then in some way she rejected or betrayed him, and he set upon\nher the curse that though seeing the truth she should never be believed.\nThe figure of Cassandra in this play is not inconsistent with that\nversion, but it makes a different impression. She is here a dedicated\nvirgin, and her mystic love for Apollo does not seem to have suffered\nany breach.\n\n[7] Pallas.]--(See above.) The historical explanation of the Trojan\nPallas and the Greek Pallas is simple enough; but as soon as the two are\nmythologically personified and made one, there emerges just such a\nbitter and ruthless goddess as Euripides, in his revolt against the\ncurrent mythology, loved to depict. But it is not only the mythology\nthat he is attacking. He seems really to feel that if there are\nconscious gods ruling the world, they are cruel or \"inhuman\" beings.\n\n[8]--Ajax the Less, son of O\u00c3\u00afleus, either ravished or attempted to\nravish Cassandra (the story occurs in both forms) while she was clinging\nto the Palladium or image of Pallas. It is one of the great typical sins\nof the Sack of Troy, often depicted on vases.\n\n[9] Faces of ships.]--Homeric ships had prows shaped and painted to look\nlike birds' or beasts' heads. A ship was always a wonderfully live and\nvivid thing to the Greek poets. (Cf. p. 64.)\n\n[10] Castor.]--Helen's brother: the Eur\u00c3\u00b4tas, the river of her home,\nSparta.\n\n[11] Fifty seeds.]--Priam had fifty children, nineteen of them children\nof Hecuba (_Il_. vi. 451, &c.).\n\n[12] Pir\u00c3\u00aan\u00c3\u00aa.]--The celebrated spring on the hill of Corinth. Drawing\nwater was a typical employment of slaves.\n\n[13] ff., Theseus' land, &c.]--Theseus' land is Attica. The poet, in the\nmidst of his bitterness over the present conduct of his city, clings the\nmore to its old fame for humanity. The \"land high-born\" where the Pen\u00c3\u00aa\u00c3\u00bcs\nflows round the base of Mount Olympus in northern Thessaly is one of the\nhaunts of Euripides' dreams in many plays. Cf. _Bacchae_, 410 (p. 97 in\nmy translation). Mount Aetna fronts the \"Tyrians' citadel,\" _i.e._.,\nCarthage, built by the Phoenicians. The \"sister land\" is the district of\nSybaris in South Italy, where the river Crathis has, or had, a red-gold\ncolour, which makes golden the hair of men and the fleeces of sheep; and\nthe water never lost its freshness.\n\n[14] Talthybius is a loyal soldier with every wish to be kind. But he is\nnaturally in good spirits over the satisfactory end of the war, and his\ntact is not sufficient to enable him to understand the Trojan Women's\nfeelings. Yet in the end, since he has to see and do the cruelties which\nhis Chiefs only order from a distance, the real nature of his work\nforces itself upon him, and he feels and speaks at times almost like a\nTrojan. It is worth noticing how the Trojan Women generally avoid\naddressing him. (Cf. pp. 48, 67, 74.)\n\n[15] The haunted keys (literally, \"with God through them, penetrating\nthem\").]--Cassandra was his Key-bearer, holding the door of his Holy\nPlace. (Cf. _ Hip_. 540, p. 30.)\n\n[16] She hath a toil, &c.]--There is something true and pathetic about\nthis curious blindness which prevents Hecuba from understanding \"so\nplain a riddle.\" (Cf. below, p. 42.) She takes the watching of a Tomb to\nbe some strange Greek custom, and does not seek to have it explained\nfurther.\n\n[17] Odysseus.]--In Euripides generally Odysseus is the type of the\nsuccessful unscrupulous man, as soldier and politician--the incarnation\nof what the poet most hated. In Homer of course he is totally different.\n\n[18] Burn themselves and die.]--Women under these circumstances did\ncommit suicide in Euripides' day, as they have ever since. It is rather\ncurious that none of the characters of the play, not even Andromache,\nkills herself. The explanation must be that no such suicide was recorded\nin the tradition (though cf. below, on p. 33); a significant fact,\nsuggesting that in the Homeric age, when this kind of treatment of women\ncaptives was regular, the victims did not suffer quite so terribly under\nit.\n\n[19] Hymen.]--She addresses the Torch. The shadowy Marriage-god \"Hymen\"\nwas a torch and a cry as much as anything more personal. As a torch he\nis the sign both of marriage and of death, of sunrise and of the\nconsuming fire. The full Moon was specially connected with marriage\nceremonies.\n\n[20] Loxias.]--The name of Apollo as an Oracular God.\n\n[21] Cassandra's visions.]--The allusions are to the various sufferings\nof Odysseus, as narrated in the _Odyssey_, and to the tragedies of the\nhouse of Atreus, as told for instance in Aeschylus' _Oresteia_.\nAgamemnon together with Cassandra, and in part because he brought\nCassandra, was murdered--felled with an axe--on his return home by his\nwife Clytaemnestra and her lover Aegisthus. Their bodies were cast into\na pit among the rocks. In vengeance for this, Orestes, Agamemnon's son,\ncommitted \"mother-murder,\" and in consequence was driven by the Erinyes\n(Furies) of his mother into madness and exile.\n\n[22] This their king so wise.]--Agamemnon made the war for the sake of\nhis brother Menelaus, and slew his daughter, Iphigenia, as a sacrifice\nat Aulis, to enable the ships to sail for Troy.\n\n[23] Hector and Paris.]--The point about Hector is clear, but as to\nParis, the feeling that, after all, it was a glory that he and the\nhalf-divine Helen loved each other, is scarcely to be found anywhere\nelse in Greek literature. (Cf., however, Isocrates' \"Praise of Helen.\")\nParis and Helen were never idealised like Launcelot and Guinevere, or\nTristram and Iseult.\n\n[24] A wise queen.]--Penelope, the faithful wife of Odysseus.\n\n[25] O Heralds, yea, Voices of Death.]--There is a play on the word for\n\"heralds\" in the Greek here, which I have evaded by a paraphrase.\n([Greek: Kaer-ukes] as though from [Greek: Kaer] the death-spirit, \"the\none thing abhorred of all mortal men.\")\n\n[26] That in this place she dies.]--The death of Hecuba is connected\nwith a certain heap of stones on the shore of the Hellespont, called\n_Kunoss\u00c3\u00aama_, or \"Dog's Tomb.\" According to one tradition (Eur. _Hec_.\n1259 ff.) she threw herself off the ship into the sea; according to\nanother she was stoned by the Greeks for her curses upon the fleet; but\nin both she is changed after death into a sort of Hell-hound. M. Victor\nB\u00c3\u00a9rard suggests that the dog first comes into the story owing to the\naccidental resemblance of the (hypothetical) Semitic word _S'qoulah_,\n\"Stone\" or \"Stoning,\" and the Greek _Skulax_, dog. The Homeric Scylla\n(_Skulla_) was also both a Stone and a Dog (_Ph\u00c3\u00a9neciens et Odyss\u00c3\u00a9e_, i.\n213). Of course in the present passage there is no direct reference to\nthese wild sailor-stories.\n\n[27] The wind comes quick.]--_i.e._. The storm of the Prologue. Three\nPowers: the three Erinyes.\n\n[28] ff., Chorus.]--The Wooden Horse is always difficult to understand,\nand seems to have an obscuring effect on the language of poets who treat\nof it. I cannot help suspecting that the story arises from a real\nhistorical incident misunderstood. Troy, we are told, was still holding\nout after ten years and could not be taken, until at last by the divine\nsuggestions of Athena, a certain Epeios devised a \"Wooden Horse.\"\n\nWhat was the \"device\"? According to the _Odyssey_ and most Greek poets,\nit was a gigantic wooden figure of a horse. A party of heroes, led by\nOdysseus, got inside it and waited. The Greeks made a show of giving up\nthe siege and sailed away, but only as far as Tenedos. The Trojans came\nout and found the horse, and after wondering greatly what it was meant\nfor and what to do with it, made a breach in their walls and dragged it\ninto the Citadel as a thank-offering to Pallas. In the night the Greeks\nreturned; the heroes in the horse came out and opened the gates, and\nTroy was captured.\n\nIt seems possible that the \"device\" really was the building of a wooden\nsiege-tower, as high as the walls, with a projecting and revolving neck.\nSuch engines were (1) capable of being used at the time in Asia, as a\nrare and extraordinary device, because they exist on early Assyrian\nmonuments; (2) certain to be misunderstood in Greek legendary tradition,\nbecause they were not used in Greek warfare till many centuries later.\n(First, perhaps, at the sieges of Perinthus and Byzantium by Philip of\nMacedon, 340 B.C.)\n\nIt is noteworthy that in the great picture by Polygn\u00c3\u00b4tus in the Lesch\u00c3\u00aa\nat Delphi \"above the wall of Troy appears the head alone of the Wooden\nHorse\" (_Paus_. x. 26). Aeschylus also (_Ag_. 816) has some obscure\nphrases pointing in the same direction: \"A horse's brood, a\nshield-bearing people, launched with a leap about the Pleiads' setting,\nsprang clear above the wall,\" &c. Euripides here treats the horse\nmetaphorically as a sort of war-horse trampling Troy.\n\n[29] Her that spareth not, Heaven's yokeless rider.]--Athena like a\nnorthern Valkyrie, as often in the _Iliad_. If one tries to imagine what\nAthena, the War-Goddess worshipped by the Athenian mob, was like--what a\nmixture of bad national passions, of superstition and statecraft, of\nslip-shod unimaginative idealisation--one may partly understand why\nEuripides made her so evil. Allegorists and high-minded philosophers\nmight make Athena entirely noble by concentrating their minds on the\nbeautiful elements in the tradition, and forgetting or explaining away\nall that was savage; he was determined to pin her down to the worst\nfacts recorded of her, and let people worship such a being if they\nliked!\n\n[30] To Artemis.]--Maidens at the shrine of Artemis are a fixed datum in\nthe tradition. (Cf. _Hec_. 935 ff.)\n\n[31] Andromache and Hecuba.]--This very beautiful scene is perhaps\nmarred to most modern readers by an element which is merely a part of\nthe convention of ancient mourning. Each of the mourners cries: \"There\nis no affliction like mine!\" and then proceeds to argue, as it were,\nagainst the other's counter claim. One can only say that it was, after\nall, what they expected of each other; and I believe the same convention\nexists in most places where keening or wailing is an actual practice.\n\n[32] Even as the sound of a song.]--I have filled in some words which\nseem to be missing in the Greek here.\n\n[33]Andromache.]--This character is wonderfully studied. She seems to me\nto be a woman who has not yet shown much character or perhaps had very\nintense experience, but is only waiting for sufficiently great trials to\nbecome a heroine and a saint. There is still a marked element of\nconventionality in her description of her life with Hector; but one\nfeels, as she speaks, that she is already past it. Her character is\nbuilt up of \"_Sophrosyne_,\" of self-restraint and the love of\ngoodness--qualities which often seem second-rate or even tiresome until\nthey have a sufficiently great field in which to act. Very\ncharacteristic is her resolution to make the best, and not the worst, of\nher life in Pyrrhus' house, with all its horror of suffering and\napparent degradation. So is the self-conquest by which she deliberately\nrefrains from cursing her child's murderers, for the sake of the last\npoor remnant of good she can still do to him, in getting him buried. The\nnobility of such a character depends largely, of course, on the\nintensity of the feelings conquered.\n\nIt is worth noting, in this connection, that Euripides is contradicting\na wide-spread tradition (Robert, _Bild und Lied_, pp. 63 ff.).\nAndromache, in the pictures of the Sack of Troy, is represented with a\ngreat pestle or some such instrument fighting with the Soldiers to\nrescue Astyanax ([Greek:'Andro-machae]= \"Man-fighting\").\n\nObserve, too, what a climax of drama is reached by means of the very\nfact that Andromache, to the utmost of her power, tries to do nothing\n\"dramatic,\" but only what will be best. Her character in Euripides'\nplay, _Andromache_, is, on the whole, similar to this, but less\ndeveloped.\n\n[34] In Salamis, filled with the foaming, &c.]--A striking instance of\nthe artistic value of the Greek chorus in relieving an intolerable\nstrain. The relief provided is something much higher than what we\nordinarily call \"relief\"; it is a stream of pure poetry and music in key\nwith the sadness of the surrounding scene, yet, in a way, happy just\nbecause it is beautiful. (Cf. note on _Hippolytus_, 1. 732.)\n\nThe argument of the rather difficult lyric is: \"This is not the first\ntime Troy has been taken. Long ago Heracles made war against the old\nking Laomedon, because he had not given him the immortal steeds that he\npromised. And Telamon joined him; Telamon who might have been happy in\nhis island of Salamis, among the bees and the pleasant waters, looking\nover the strait to the olive-laden hills of Athens, the beloved City!\nAnd they took ship and slew Laomedon. Yea, twice Zeus has destroyed\nIlion!\n\n(Second part.) Is it all in vain that our Trojan princes have been loved\nby the Gods? Ganym\u00c3\u00aad\u00c3\u00aas pours the nectar of Zeus in his banquets, his\nface never troubled, though his motherland is burned with fire! And, to\nsay nothing of Zeus, how can the Goddess of Morning rise and shine upon\nus uncaring? She loved Tith\u00c3\u00b4nus, son of Laomedon, and bore him up from\nus in a chariot to be her husband in the skies. But all that once made\nthem love us is gone!\"\n\n[35] Pools of thy bathing.]--It is probable that Ganym\u00c3\u00aad\u00c3\u00aas was himself\noriginally a pool or a spring on Ida, now a pourer of nectar in heaven.\n\n[36] Menelaus and Helen.]--The meeting of Menelaus and Helen after the\ntaking of Troy was naturally one of the great moments in the heroic\nlegend. The versions, roughly speaking, divide themselves into two. In\none (_Little Iliad_, Ar. _Lysistr_. 155, Eur. _Andromache_ 628) Menelaus\nis about to kill her, but as she bares her bosom to the sword, the sword\nfalls from his hand. In the other (Stesichorus, _Sack of Ilion_ (?))\nMenelaus or some one else takes her to the ships to be stoned, and the\nmen cannot stone her. As Quintus of Smyrna says, \"They looked on her as\nthey would on a God!\"\n\nBoth versions have affected Euripides here. And his Helen has just the\nmagic of the Helen of legend. That touch of the supernatural which\nbelongs of right to the Child of Heaven--a mystery, a gentleness, a\nstrange absence of fear or wrath--is felt through all her words. One\nforgets to think of her guilt or innocence; she is too wonderful a being\nto judge, too precious to destroy. This supernatural element, being the\nthing which, if true, separates Helen from other women, and in a way\nredeems her, is for that reason exactly what Hecuba denies. The\ncontroversy has a certain eternal quality about it: the hypothesis of\nheavenly enchantment and the hypothesis of mere bad behaviour, neither\nof them entirely convincing! But the very curses of those that hate her\nmake a kind of superhuman atmosphere about Helen in this play; she fills\nthe background like a great well-spring of pain.\n\nThis Menelaus, however, is rather different from the traditional\nMenelaus. Besides being the husband of Helen, he is the typical\nConqueror, for whose sake the Greeks fought and to whom the central\nprize of the war belongs. And we take him at the height of his triumph,\nthe very moment for which he made the war! Hence the peculiar bitterness\nwith which he is treated, his conquest turning to ashes in his mouth,\nand his love a confused turmoil of hunger and hatred, contemptible and\nyet terrible.\n\nThe exit of the scene would leave a modern audience quite in doubt as to\nwhat happened, unless the action were much clearer than the words. But\nall Athenians knew from the _Odyssey_ that the pair were swiftly\nreconciled, and lived happily together as King and Queen of Sparta.\n\n[37] Thou deep base of the world.]--These lines, as a piece of religious\nspeculation, were very famous in antiquity. And dramatically they are\nmost important. All through the play Hecuba is a woman of remarkable\nintellectual power and of fearless thought. She does not definitely deny\nthe existence of the Olympian gods, like some characters in Euripides,\nbut she treats them as beings that have betrayed her, and whose name she\nscarcely deigns to speak. It is the very godlessness of Hecuba's\nfortitude that makes it so terrible and, properly regarded, so noble.\n(Cf. p. 35 \"Why call on things so weak?\" and p. 74 \"They know, they\nknow....\") Such Gods were as a matter of fact the moral inferiors of\ngood men, and Euripides will never blind his eyes to their inferiority.\nAnd as soon as people see that their god is bad, they tend to cease\nbelieving in his existence at all. (Hecuba's answer to Helen is not\ninconsistent with this, it is only less characteristic.)\n\nBehind this Olympian system, however, there is a possibility of some\nreal Providence or impersonal Governance of the world, to which here,\nfor a moment, Hecuba makes a passionate approach. If there is _any_\nexplanation, _any_ justice, even in the form of mere punishment of the\nwicked, she will be content and give worship! But it seems that there is\nnot. Then at last there remains--what most but not all modern\nfreethinkers would probably have begun to doubt at the very\nbeginning--the world of the departed, the spirits of the dead, who are\ntrue, and in their dim way love her still (p. 71 \"Thy father far away\nshall comfort thee,\" and the last scene of the play).\n\nThis last religion, faint and shattered by doubt as it is, represents a\nreturn to the most primitive \"Pelasgian\" beliefs, a worship of the Dead\nwhich existed long before the Olympian system, and has long outlived it.\n\n[38] The fire-brand's image.]--Hecuba, just before Paris' birth, dreamed\nthat she gave birth to a fire-brand. The prophets therefore advised that\nthe babe should be killed; but Priam disobeyed them.\n\n[39] Three Crowns of Life.]--On the Judgment of Paris see Miss Harrison,\n_Prolegomena_. pp. 292 ff. Late writers degrade the story into a beauty\ncontest between three thoroughly personal goddesses--and a contest\ncomplicated by bribery. But originally the Judgment is rather a Choice\nbetween three possible lives, like the Choice of Heracles between Work\nand Idleness. The elements of the choice vary in different versions: but\nin general Hera is royalty; Athena is prowess in war or personal merit;\nAphrodite, of course, is love. And the goddesses are not really to be\ndistinguished from the gifts they bring. They are what they give, and\nnothing more. Cf. the wonderful lyric _Androm_. 274 ff., where they come\nto \"a young man walking to and fro alone, in an empty hut in the\nfirelight.\"\n\nThere is an extraordinary effect in Helen herself _being_ one of the\nCrowns of Life--a fair equivalent for the throne of the world.\n\n[40] Alexander ... Paris.]--Two plays on words in the Greek.\n\n[41] The old Gate-Warden.]--He and the Watchers are, of course, safely\ndead. But on the general lines of the tradition it may well be that\nHelen is speaking the truth. She loved both Menelaus and Paris; and,\naccording to some versions, hated D\u00c3\u00aaiphobus, the Trojan prince who\nseized her after Paris' death. There is a reference to D\u00c3\u00aaiphobus in the\nMSS. of the play here, but I follow Wilamowitz in thinking it spurious.\n\n[42] Chorus.]--On the Trojan Zeus see above, on p. 11. Mount Ida caught\nthe rays of the rising sun in some special manner and distributed them\nto the rest of the world; and in this gleam of heavenly fire the God had\nhis dwelling, which is now the brighter for the flames of his City going\nup like incense!\n\nNothing definite is known of the Golden Images and the Moon-Feasts.\n\n[43] Towers of the Giants.]--The pre-historic castles of Tiryns and\nMyc\u00c3\u00aanae.\n\n[44] May Helen be there.]--(Cf. above.) Pitan\u00c3\u00aa was one of the five\ndivisions of Sparta. Athena had a \"Bronzen House\" on the acropolis of\nSparta. Simo\u00c3\u00afs, of course, the river of Troy.\n\n[45] I make thee whole.]--Here as elsewhere Hecuba fluctuates between\nfidelity to the oldest and most instinctive religion, and a rejection of\nall Gods.\n\n[46] Lo, I have seen the open hand of God.]--The text is, perhaps,\nimperfect here; but Professor Wilamowitz agrees with me that Hecuba has\nseen something like a vision. The meaning of this speech is of the\nutmost importance. It expresses the inmost theme of the whole play, a\nsearch for an answer to the injustice of suffering in the very splendour\nand beauty of suffering. Of course it must be suffering of a particular\nkind, or, what comes to the same thing, suffering borne in a particular\nway; but in that case the answer seems to me to hold. One does not\nreally think the world evil because there are martyrs or heroes in it.\nFor them the elements of beauty which exist in any great trial of the\nspirit become so great as to overpower the evil that created them--to\nturn it from shame and misery into tragedy. Of course to most sufferers,\nto children and animals and weak people, or those without inspiration,\nthe doctrine brings no help. It is a thing invented by a poet for\nhimself.\n\n[47] Thou of the Ages.]--The Phrygian All-Father, identified with Zeus,\nson of Kronos. (Cf. on p. 11.)\n\n[48] Now hast thou found thy prayer.]--The Gods have deserted her, but\nshe has still the dead. (Cf. above, on p. 71.)\n\n[49] Forth to the dark Greek ships.]--Curiously like another magnificent\nending of a great poem, that of the _Chanson de Roland_, where\nCharlemagne is called forth on a fresh quest:\n\n\n\"Deus,\" dist li Reis, \"si penuse est ma vie!\"\nPluret des oilz, sa barbe blanche tiret....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Trojan women of Euripides, by Euripides\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TROJAN WOMEN OF EURIPIDES ***\n\n***** This file should be named 10096-8.txt or 10096-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/0\/0\/9\/10096\/\n\nProduced by Juliet Sutherland, Ted Garvin, L Barber and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\n     http:\/\/www.ibiblio.org\/gutenberg\/etext06\n\n    (Or \/etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/0\/2\/3\/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/2\/4\/6\/8\/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n","id":401,"split":"train"}
