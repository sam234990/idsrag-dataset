He longs to be free from the monotony of his life and work, and is led by his feelings of hopelessness into drinking alcohol. While travelling by train one day, he meets Mr Dengate, a former debtor to his deceased father. As Dengate was bankrupt at the point of Hilliard's father's death, the debt was not repaid, but as they meet on the train, Hilliard shames Dengate into repaying the debt of \u00c2\u0141436. Hilliard then commits to the plan of living without working, as a \"free\" human being, for as long as the money lasts.\nFirst travelling to London, and then to Paris, Hilliard eventually returns to his family home in Dudley, feeling lonely. He discovers a portrait of a young woman and decides to find her. Eventually, he succeeds in his plan. The woman, Eve Madeley, works as a book keeper, with an income of \u00c2\u01411 per week. Like Hilliard had previously done, she is despairing about her future. Eve tells Hilliard that they would not be able to marry, as his income is too small, but she does agree to travel to Paris with him. They are accompanied by Eve's friend Patty Ringrose.

A\nsouth-west wind had loaded the air with moisture, which dripped at\nmoments, thinly and sluggishly, from a featureless sky. The lamps, just\nlighted, cast upon wet wood and metal a pale yellow shimmer; voices\nsounded with peculiar clearness; so did the rumble of a porter's barrow\nladen with luggage. From a foundry hard by came the muffled, rhythmic\nthunder of mighty blows; this and the long note of an engine-whistle\nwailing far off seemed to intensify the stillness of the air as gloomy\nday passed into gloomier night.\n\nIn clear daylight the high, uncovered platform would have offered an\noutlook over the surrounding country, but at this hour no horizon was\ndiscernible. Buildings near at hand, rude masses of grimy brick, stood\nout against a grey confused background; among them rose a turret which\nvomited crimson flame. This fierce, infernal glare seemed to lack the\nirradiating quality of earthly fires; with hard, though fluctuating\noutline, it leapt towards the kindred night, and diffused a blotchy\ndarkness. In the opposite direction, over towards Dudley Town, appeared\nspots of lurid glow. But on the scarred and barren plain which extends\nto Birmingham there had settled so thick an obscurity, vapours from\nabove blending with earthly reek, that all tile beacons of fiery toil\nwere wrapped and hidden.\n\nOf the waiting travellers, two kept apart from the rest, pacing this\nway and that, but independently of each other. They were men of\ndissimilar appearance; the one comfortably and expensively dressed, his\nage about fifty, his visage bearing the stamp of commerce; the other,\nyounger by more than twenty years, habited in a way which made it;\ndifficult to as certain his social standing, and looking about him with\neyes suggestive of anything but prudence or content. Now and then they\nexchanged a glance: he of the high hat and caped ulster betrayed an\ninterest in the younger man, who, in his turn, took occasion to observe\nthe other from a distance, with show of dubious recognition.\n\nThe trill of an electric signal, followed by a clanging bell, brought\nthem both to a pause, and they stood only two or three yards apart.\nPresently a light flashed through the thickening dusk; there was\nroaring, grinding, creaking and a final yell of brake-tortured wheels.\nMaking at once for the nearest third-class carriage, the man in the\nseedy overcoat sprang to a place, and threw himself carelessly back; a\nmoment, and he was followed by the second passenger, who seated himself\non the opposite side of the compartment. Once more they looked at each\nother, but without change of countenance.\n\nTickets were collected, for there would be no stoppage before\nBirmingham: then the door slammed, and the two men were alone together.\n\nTwo or three minutes after the train had started, the elder man leaned\nforward, moved slightly, and spoke.\n\n\"Excuse me, I think your name must be Hilliard.\"\n\n\"What then?\" was the brusque reply.\n\n\"You don't remember me?\"\n\n\"Scoundrels are common enough,\" returned the other, crossing his legs,\n\"but I remember you for all that.\"\n\nThe insult was thrown out with a peculiarly reckless air; it astounded\nthe hearer, who sat for an instant with staring eyes and lips apart;\nthen the blood rushed to his cheeks.\n\n\"If I hadn't just about twice your muscle, my lad,\" he answered\nangrily, \"I'd make you repent that, and be more careful with your\ntongue in future. Now, mind what you say! We've a quiet quarter of an\nhour before us, and I might alter my mind.\"\n\nThe young man laughed contemptuously. He was tall, but slightly built,\nand had delicate hands.\n\n\"So you've turned out a blackguard, have you?\" pursued his companion,\nwhose name was Dengate. \"I heard something about that.\"\n\n\"From whom?\"\n\n\"You drink, I am told. I suppose that's your condition now.\"\n\n\"Well, no; not just now,\" answered Hilliard. He spoke the language of\nan educated man, but with a trace of the Midland accent. Dengate's\nspeech had less refinement.\n\n\"What do you mean by your insulting talk, then? I spoke to you civilly.\"\n\n\"And I answered as I thought fit.\"\n\nThe respectable citizen sat with his hands on his knees, and\nscrutinised the other's sallow features.\n\n\"You've been drinking, I can see. I had something to say to you, but\nI'd better leave it for another time.\"\n\nHilliard flashed a look of scorn, and said sternly--\n\n\"I am as sober as you are.\"\n\n\"Then just give me civil answers to civil questions.\"\n\n\"Questions? What right have you to question me?\"\n\n\"It's for your own advantage. You called me scoundrel. What did you\nmean by that?\"\n\n\"That's the name I give to fellows who go bankrupt to get rid of their\ndebts.\"\n\n\"Is it!\" said Dengate, with a superior smile. \"That only shows how\nlittle you know of the world, my lad. You got it from your father, I\ndaresay; he had a rough way of talking.\"\n\n\"A disagreeable habit of telling the truth.\"\n\n\"I know all about it. Your father wasn't a man of business, and\ncouldn't see things from a business point of view. Now, what I just\nwant to say to you is this: there's all the difference in the world\nbetween commercial failure and rascality. If you go down to Liverpool,\nand ask men of credit for their opinion about Charles Edward Dengate,\nyou'll have a lesson that would profit you. I can see you're one of the\nyoung chaps who think a precious deal of themselves; I'm often coming\nacross them nowadays, and I generally give them a piece of my mind.\"\n\nHilliard smiled.\n\n\"If you gave them the whole, it would be no great generosity.\"\n\n\"Eh? Yes, I see you've had a glass or two, and it makes you witty. But\nwait a bit I was devilish near thrashing you a few minutes ago; but I\nsha'n't do it, say what you like. I don't like vulgar rows.\"\n\n\"No more do I,\" remarked Hilliard; \"and I haven't fought since I was a\nboy. But for your own satisfaction, I can tell you it's a wise resolve\nnot to interfere with me. The temptation to rid the world of one such\nman as you might prove too strong.\"\n\nThere was a force of meaning in these words, quietly as they were\nuttered, which impressed the listener.\n\n\"You'll come to a bad end, my lad.\"\n\n\"Hardly. It's unlikely that I shall ever be rich.\"\n\n\"Oh! you're one of that sort, are you? I've come across Socialistic\nfellows. But look here. I'm talking civilly, and I say again it's for\nyour advantage. I had a respect for your father, and I liked your\nbrother--I'm sorry to hear he's dead.\"\n\n\"Please keep your sorrow to yourself.\"\n\n\"All right, all right! I understand you're a draughtsman at Kenn and\nBodditch's?\"\n\n\"I daresay you are capable of understanding that.\"\n\nHilliard planted his elbow in the window of the carriage and propped\nhis cheek on his hand.\n\n\"Yes; and a few other things,\" rejoined the well-dressed man. \"How to\nmake money, for instance.--Well, haven't you any insult ready?\"\n\nThe other looked out at a row of flaring chimneys, which the train was\nrushing past: he kept silence.\n\n\"Go down to Liverpool,\" pursued Dengate, \"and make inquiries about me.\nYou'll find I have as good a reputation as any man living.\"\n\nHe laboured this point. It was evident that he seriously desired to\nestablish his probity and importance in the young man's eyes. Nor did\nanything in his look or speech conflict with such claims. He had hard,\nbut not disagreeable features, and gave proof of an easy temper.\n\n\"Paying one's debts,\" said Hilliard, \"is fatal to reputation.\"\n\n\"You use words you don't understand. There's no such thing as a debt,\nexcept what's recognised by the laws.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't wonder if you think of going into Parliament. You are just\nthe man to make laws.\"\n\n\"Well, who knows? What I want you to understand is, that if your father\nwere alive at this moment, I shouldn't admit that he had claim upon me\nfor one penny.\"\n\n\"It was because I understood it already that I called you a scoundrel.\"\n\n\"Now be careful, my lad,\" exclaimed Dengate, as again he winced under\nthe epithet. \"My temper may get the better of me, and I should be sorry\nfor it. I got into this carriage with you (of course I had a\nfirst-class ticket) because I wanted to form an opinion of your\ncharacter. I've been told you drink, and I see that you do, and I'm\nsorry for it. You'll be losing your place before long, and you'll go\ndown. Now look here; you've called me foul names, and you've done your\nbest to rile me. Now I'm going to make you ashamed of yourself.\"\n\nHilliard fixed the speaker with his scornful eyes; the last words had\nmoved him to curiosity.\n\n\"I can excuse a good deal in a man with an empty pocket,\" pursued the\nother. \"I've been there myself; I know how it makes you feel--how much\ndo you earn, by the bye?\"\n\n\"Mind you own business.\"\n\n\"All right. I suppose it's about two pounds a week. Would you like to\nknow what _my_ in come is? Well, something like two pounds an hour,\nreckoning eight hours as the working day. There's a difference, isn't\nthere? It comes of minding my business, you see. You'll never make\nanything like it; you find it easier to abuse people who work than to\nwork yourself. Now if you go down to Liverpool, and ask how I got to my\npresent position, you'll find it's the result of hard and honest work.\nUnderstand that: honest work.\"\n\n\"And forgetting to pay your debts,\" threw in the young man.\n\n\"It's eight years since I owed any man a penny. The people I _did_ owe\nmoney to were sensible men of business--all except your father, and he\nnever could see things in the right light. I went through the\nbankruptcy court, and I made arrangements that satisfied my creditors.\nI should have satisfied your father too, only he died.\"\n\n\"You paid tuppence ha'penny in the pound.\"\n\n\"No, it was five shillings, and my creditors--sensible men of\nbusiness--were satisfied. Now look here. I owed your father four\nhundred and thirty-six pounds, but he didn't rank as an ordinary\ncreditor, and if I had paid him after my bankruptcy it would have been\njust because I felt a respect for him--not because he had any legal\nclaim. I _meant_ to pay him--understand that.\"\n\nHilliard smiled. Just then a block signal caused the train to slacken\nspeed. Darkness had fallen, and lights glimmered from some cottages by\nthe line.\n\n\"You don't believe me,\" added Dengate.\n\n\"I don't.\"\n\nThe prosperous man bit his lower lip, and sat gazing at the lamp in the\ncarriage. The train came to a standstill; there was no sound but the\nthrobbing of the engine.\n\n\"Well, listen to me,\" Dengate resumed. \"You're turning out badly, and\nany money you get you're pretty sure to make a bad use of. But\"--he\nassumed an air of great solemnity--\"all the same--now listen----\"\n\n\"I'm listening.\"\n\n\"Just to show you the kind of a man I am, and to make you feel ashamed\nof yourself, I'm going to pay you the money.\"\n\nFor a few seconds there was unbroken stillness. The men gazed at each\nother, Dengate superbly triumphant, Hilliard incredulous but betraying\nexcitement.\n\n\"I'm going to pay you four hundred and thirty-six pounds,\" Dengate\nrepeated. \"No less and no more. It isn't a legal debt, so I shall pay\nno interest. But go with me when we get to Birmingham, and you shall\nhave my cheque for four hundred and thirty-six pounds.\"\n\nThe train began to move on. Hilliard had uncrossed his legs, and sat\nbending forward, his eyes on vacancy.\n\n\"Does that alter your opinion of me?\" asked the other.\n\n\"I sha'n't believe it till I have cashed the cheque.\"\n\n\"You're one of those young fellows who think so much of themselves\nthey've no good opinion to spare for anyone else. And what's more, I've\nstill half a mind to give you a good thrashing before I give you the\ncheque. There's just about time, and I shouldn't wonder if it did you\ngood. You want some of the conceit taken out of you, my lad.\"\n\nHilliard seemed not to hear this. Again he fixed his eyes on the\nother's countenance.\n\n\"Do you say you are going to pay me four hundred pounds?\" he asked\nslowly.\n\n\"Four hundred and thirty-six. You'll go to the devil with it, but\nthat's no business of mine.\"\n\n\"There's just one thing I must tell you. If this is a joke, keep out of\nmy way after you've played it out, that's all.\"\n\n\"It isn't a joke. And one thing I have to tell _you_. I reserve to\nmyself the right of thrashing you, if I feel in the humour for it.\"\n\nHilliard gave a laugh, then threw himself back into the corner, and did\nnot speak again until the train pulled up at New Street station.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nAn hour later he was at Old Square, waiting for the tram to Aston. Huge\nsteam-driven vehicles came and went, whirling about the open space with\nmonitory bell-clang. Amid a press of homeward-going workfolk, Hilliard\nclambered to a place on the top and lit his pipe. He did not look the\nsame man who had waited gloomily at Dudley Port; his eyes gleamed with\nlife; answering a remark addressed to him by a neighbour on the car, he\nspoke jovially.\n\nNo rain was falling, but the streets shone wet and muddy under lurid\nlamp-lights. Just above the house-tops appeared the full moon, a\nreddish disk, blurred athwart floating vapour. The car drove northward,\nspeedily passing from the region of main streets and great edifices\ninto a squalid district of factories and workshops and crowded by-ways.\nAt Aston Church the young man alighted, and walked rapidly for five\nminutes, till he reached a row of small modern houses. Socially they\nrepresented a step or two upwards in the gradation which, at\nBirmingham, begins with the numbered court and culminates in the\nmansions of Edgbaston.\n\nHe knocked at a door, and was answered by a girl, who nodded\nrecognition.\n\n\"Mrs. Hilliard in? Just tell her I'm here.\"\n\nThere was a natural abruptness in his voice, but it had a kindly note,\nand a pleasant smile accompanied it. After a brief delay he received\npermission to go upstairs, where the door of a sitting-room stood open.\nWithin was a young woman, slight, pale, and pretty, who showed\nsomething of embarrassment, though her face made him welcome.\n\n\"I expected you sooner.\"\n\n\"Business kept me back. Well, little girl?\"\n\nThe table was spread for tea, and at one end of it, on a high chair,\nsat a child of four years old. Hilliard kissed her, and stroked her\ncurly hair, and talked with playful affection. This little girl was his\nniece, the child of his elder brother, who had died three years ago.\nThe poorly furnished room and her own attire proved that Mrs. Hilliard\nhad but narrow resources in her widowhood. Nor did she appear a woman\nof much courage; tears had thinned her cheeks, and her delicate hands\nhad suffered noticeably from unwonted household work.\n\nHilliard remarked something unusual in her behaviour this evening. She\nwas restless, and kept regarding him askance, as if in apprehension. A\nletter from her, in which she merely said she wished to speak to him,\nhad summoned him hither from Dudley. As a rule, they saw each other but\nonce a month.\n\n\"No bad news, I hope!\" he remarked aside to her, as he took his place\nat the table.\n\n\"Oh, no. I'll tell you afterwards.\"\n\nVery soon after the meal Mrs. Hilliard took the child away and put her\nto bed. During her absence the visitor sat brooding, a peculiar\nhalf-smile on his face. She came back, drew a chair up to the fire, but\ndid not sit down.\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" asked her brother-in-law, much as he might have\nspoken to the little girl.\n\n\"I have something very serious to talk about, Maurice.\"\n\n\"Have you? All right; go ahead.\"\n\n\"I--I am so very much afraid I shall offend you.\"\n\nThe young man laughed.\n\n\"Not very likely. I can take a good deal from you.\"\n\nShe stood with her hands on the back of the chair, and as he looked at\nher, Hilliard saw her pale cheeks grow warm.\n\n\"It'll seem very strange to you, Maurice.\"\n\n\"Nothing will seem strange after an adventure I've had this afternoon.\nYou shall hear about it presently.\"\n\n\"Tell me your story first.\"\n\n\"That's like a woman. All right, I'll tell you. I met that scoundrel\nDengate, and--he's paid me the money he owed my father.\"\n\n\"He has _paid_ it? Oh! really?\"\n\n\"See, here's a cheque, and I think it likely I can turn it into cash.\nThe blackguard has been doing well at Liverpool. I'm not quite sure\nthat I understand the reptile, but he seems to have given me this\nbecause I abused him. I hurt his vanity, and he couldn't resist the\ntemptation to astonish me. He thinks I shall go about proclaiming him a\nnoble fellow. Four hundred and thirty-six pounds; there it is.\"\n\nHe tossed the piece of paper into the air with boyish glee, and only\njust caught it as it was fluttering into the fire.\n\n\"Oh, be careful!\" cried Mrs. Hilliard.\n\n\"I told him he was a scoundrel, and he began by threatening to thrash\nme. I'm very glad he didn't try. It was in the train, and I know very\nwell I should have strangled him. It would have been awkward, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, Maurice, how _can_ you----?\"\n\n\"Well, here's the money; and half of it is yours.\"\n\n\"Mine? Oh, no! After all you have given me. Besides, I sha'n't want it.\"\n\n\"How's that?\"\n\nTheir eyes mete Hilliard again saw the flush in her cheeks, and began\nto guess its explanation. He looked puzzled, interested.\n\n\"Do I know him?\" was his next inquiry.\n\n\"Should you think it very wrong of me?\" She moved aside from the line\nof his gaze. \"I couldn't imagine how you would take it.\"\n\n\"It all depends. Who is the man?\"\n\nStill shrinking towards a position where Hilliard could not easily\nobserve her, the young widow told her story. She had consented to marry\na man of whom her brother-in-law knew little but the name, one Ezra\nMarr; he was turned forty, a widower without children, and belonged to\na class of small employers of labour known in Birmingham as \"little\nmasters.\" The contrast between such a man and Maurice Hilliard's\nbrother was sufficiently pronounced; but the widow nervously did her\nbest to show Ezra Marr in a favourable light.\n\n\"And then,\" she added after a pause, while Hilliard was reflecting, \"I\ncouldn't go on being a burden on you. How very few men would have done\nwhat you have----\"\n\n\"Stop a minute. Is _that_ the real reason? If so----\"\n\nHurriedly she interposed.\n\n\"That was only one of the reasons--only one.\"\n\nHilliard knew very well that her marriage had not been entirely\nsuccessful; it seemed to him very probable that with a husband of the\nartisan class, a vigorous and go-ahead fellow, she would be better\nmated than in the former instance. He felt sorry for his little niece,\nbut there again sentiment doubtless conflicted with common-sense. A few\nmore questions, and it became clear to him that he had no ground of\nresistance.\n\n\"Very well. Most likely you are doing a wise thing. And half this money\nis yours; you'll find it useful.\"\n\nThe discussion of this point was interrupted by a tap at the door. Mrs.\nHilliard, after leaving the room for a moment, returned with rosy\ncountenance.\n\n\"He is here,\" she murmured. \"I thought I should like you to meet him\nthis evening. Do you mind?\"\n\nMr. Marr entered; a favourable specimen of his kind; strong, comely,\nfrank of look and speech. Hilliard marvelled somewhat at his choice of\nthe frail and timid little widow, and hoped upon marriage would follow\nno repentance. A friendly conversation between the two men confirmed\nthem in mutual good opinion. At length Mrs. Hilliard spoke of the offer\nof money made by her brother-in-law.\n\n\"I don't feel I've any right to it,\" she said, after explaining the\ncircumstances. \"You know what Maurice has done for me. I've always felt\nI was robbing him----\"\n\n\"I wanted to say something about that,\" put in the bass-voiced Ezra. \"I\nwant to tell you, Mr. Hilliard, that you're a man I'm proud to know,\nand proud to shake hands with. And if my view goes for anything, Emily\nwon't take a penny of what you're offering her. I should think it wrong\nand mean. It is about time--that's my way of thinking--that you looked\nafter your own interests. Emily has no claim to a share in this money,\nand what's more, I don't wish her to take it.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Hilliard. \"I tell you what we'll do. A couple of\nhundred pounds shall be put aside for the little girl. You can't make\nany objection to that.\"\n\nThe mother glanced doubtfully at her future husband, but Marr again\nspoke with emphasis.\n\n\"Yes, I do object. If you don't mind me saying it, I'm quite able to\nlook after the little girl; and the fact is, I want her to grow up\nlooking to me as her father, and getting all she has from me only. Of\ncourse, I mean nothing but what's friendly: but there it is; I'd rather\nWinnie didn't have the money.\"\n\nThis man was in the habit of speaking his mind; Hilliard understood\nthat any insistence would only disturb the harmony of the occasion. He\nwaved a hand, smiled good-naturedly, and said no more.\n\nAbout nine o'clock he left the house and walked to Aston Church. While\nhe stood there, waiting for the tram, a voice fell upon his ear that\ncaused him to look round. Crouched by the entrance to the churchyard\nwas a beggar in filthy rags, his face hideously bandaged, before him on\nthe pavement a little heap of matchboxes; this creature kept uttering a\nmeaningless sing-song, either idiot jabber, or calculated to excite\nattention and pity; it sounded something like \"A-pah-pahky; pah-pahky;\npah\"; repeated a score of times, and resumed after a pause. Hilliard\ngazed and listened, then placed a copper in the wretch's extended palm,\nand turned away muttering, \"What a cursed world!\"\n\nHe was again on the tram-car before he observed that the full moon,\nrisen into a sky now clear of grosser vapours, gleamed brilliant silver\nabove the mean lights of earth. And round about it, in so vast a\ncircumference that it was only detected by the wandering eye, spread a\nsoftly radiant halo. This vision did not long occupy his thoughts, but\nat intervals he again looked upward, to dream for a moment on the\nsilvery splendour and on that wide halo dim-glimmering athwart the\ntrack of stars.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nInstead of making for the railway station, to take a train back to\nDudley, he crossed from the northern to the southern extremity of the\ntown, and by ten o'clock was in one of the streets which lead out of\nMoseley Road. Here, at a house such as lodges young men in business, he\nmade inquiry for \"Mr. Narramore,\" and was forthwith admitted.\n\nRobert Narramore, a long-stemmed pipe at his lips, sat by the fireside;\non the table lay the materials of a satisfactory supper--a cold fowl, a\nham, a Stilton cheese, and a bottle of wine.\n\n\"Hollo! You?\" he exclaimed, without rising. \"I was going to write to\nyou; thanks for saving me the trouble. Have something to eat?\"\n\n\"Yes, and to drink likewise.\"\n\n\"Do you mind ringing the bell? I believe there's a bottle of Burgundy\nleft. If not, plenty of Bass.\"\n\nHe stretched forth a languid hand, smiling amiably. Narramore was the\nimage of luxurious indolence; he had pleasant features, dark hair\ninclined to curliness, a well-built frame set off by good tailoring.\nHis income from the commercial house in which he held a post of\nresponsibility would have permitted him to occupy better quarters than\nthese; but here he had lived for ten years, and he preferred a few\ninconveniences to the trouble of moving. Trouble of any kind was\nRobert's bugbear. His progress up the commercial ladder seemed due\nrather to the luck which favours amiable and good-looking young fellows\nthan to any special ability or effort of his own. The very sound of his\nvoice had a drowsiness which soothed--if it did not irritate--the\nlistener.\n\n\"Tell them to lay out the truckle-bed,\" said Hilliard, when he had\npulled the bell. \"I shall stay here to-night.\"\n\n\"Good!\"\n\nTheir talk was merely interjectional, until the visitor had begun to\nappease his hunger and had drawn the cork of a second bottle of bitter\nale.\n\n\"This is a great day,\" Hilliard then exclaimed. \"I left Dudley this\nafternoon feeling ready to cut my throat. Now I'm a free man, with the\nworld before me.\"\n\n\"How's that?\"\n\n\"Emily's going to take a second husband--that's one thing.\"\n\n\"Heaven be praised! Better than one could have looked for.\"\n\nHilliard related the circumstances. Then he drew from his pocket an\noblong slip of paper, and held it out.\n\n\"Dengate?\" cried his friend. \"How the deuce did you get hold of this?\"\n\nExplanation followed. They debated Dengate's character and motives.\n\n\"I can understand it,\" said Narramore. \"When I was a boy of twelve I\nonce cheated an apple-woman out of three-halfpence. At the age of\nsixteen I encountered the old woman again, and felt immense\nsatisfaction in giving her a shilling. But then, you see, I had done\nwith petty cheating; I wished to clear my conscience, and look my\nfellow-woman in the face.\"\n\n\"That's it, no doubt. He seems to have got some sort of position in\nLiverpool society, and he didn't like the thought that there was a poor\ndevil at Dudley who went about calling him a scoundrel. By-the-bye,\nsomeone told him that I had taken to liquor, and was on my way to\ndestruction generally. I don't know who it could be.\"\n\n\"Oh, we all have candid friends that talk about us.\n\n\"It's true I have been drunk now and then of late. There's much to be\nsaid for getting drunk.\"\n\n\"Much,\" assented Narramore, philosophically.\n\nHilliard went on with his supper; his friend puffed tobacco, and idly\nregarded the cheque he was still holding.\n\n\"And what are you going to do?\" he asked at length.\n\nThere came no reply, and several minutes passed in silence. Then\nHilliard rose from the table, paced the floor once or twice, selected a\ncigar from a box that caught his eye, and, in cutting off the end,\nobserved quietly--\n\n\"I'm going to live.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute. We'll have the table cleared, and a kettle on the fire.\"\n\nWhile the servant was busy, Hilliard stood with an elbow on the\nmantelpiece, thoughtfully smoking his cigar. At Narramore's request, he\nmixed two tumblers of whisky toddy, then took a draught from his own,\nand returned to his former position.\n\n\"Can't you sit down?\" said Narramore.\n\n\"No, I can't.\"\n\n\"What a fellow you are! With nerves like yours, I should have been in\nmy grave years ago. You're going to live, eh?\"\n\n\"Going to be a machine no longer. Can I call myself a man? There's\nprecious little difference between a fellow like me and the damned\ngrinding mechanism that I spend my days in drawing--that roars all day\nin my ears and deafens me. I'll put an end to that. Here's four hundred\npounds. It shall mean four hundred pounds'-worth of life. While this\nmoney lasts, I'll feel that I'm a human being.\"\n\n\"Something to be said for that,\" commented the listener, in his tone of\ndrowsy impartiality.\n\n\"I offered Emily half of it. She didn't want to take it, and the man\nMarr wouldn't let her. I offered to lay it aside for the child, but\nMarr wouldn't have that either, It's fairly mine.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly.\"\n\n\"Think! The first time in my life that I've had money on which no one\nelse had a claim. When the poor old father died, Will and I had to go\nshares in keeping up the home. Our sister couldn't earn anything; she\nhad her work set in attending to her mother. When mother died, and\nMarian married, it looked as if I had only myself to look after: then\ncame Will's death, and half my income went to keep his wife and child\nfrom the workhouse. You know very well I've never grudged it. It's my\nfaith that we do what we do because anything else would be less\nagreeable. It was more to my liking to live on a pound a week than to\nsee Emily and the little lass suffer want. I've no right to any thanks\nor praise for it. But the change has come none too soon. There'd have\nbeen a paragraph in the Dudley paper some rainy morning.\"\n\n\"Yes, I was rather afraid of that,\" said Narramore musingly.\n\nHe let a minute elapse, whilst his friend paced the room; then added in\nthe same voice:\n\n\"We're in luck at the same tune. My uncle Sol was found dead this\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Do you come in for much?\"\n\n\"We don't know what he's left, but I'm down for a substantial fraction\nin a will he made three years ago. Nobody knew it, but he's been stark\nmad for the last six months. He took a bed-room out Bordesley way, in a\nfalse name, and stored it with a ton or two of tinned meats and\nvegetables. There the landlady found him lying dead this morning; she\nlearnt who he was from the papers in his pocket. It's come out that he\nhad made friends with some old boozer of that neighbourhood; he told\nhim that England was on the point of a grand financial smash, and that\nhalf the population would die of hunger. To secure himself, he began to\nlay in the stock of tinned provisions. One can't help laughing, poor\nold chap! That's the result, you see, of a life spent in sweating for\nmoney. As a young man he had hard times, and when his invention\nsucceeded, it put him off balance a bit. I've often thought he had a\ncrazy look in his eye. He may have thrown away a lot of his money in\nmad tricks: who knows?\"\n\n\"That's the end the human race will come to,\" said Hilliard. \"It'll be\ndriven mad and killed off by machinery. Before long there'll be\nmachines for washing and dressing people--machines for feeding\nthem--machines for----\"\n\nHis wrathful imagination led him to grotesque ideas which ended in\nlaughter.\n\n\"Well, I have a year or two before me. I'll know what enjoyment means.\nAnd afterwards----\"\n\n\"Yes; what afterwards?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I may choose to come back; I may prefer to make an end.\nImpossible to foresee my state of mind after living humanly for a year\nor two. And what shall _you_ do if you come in for a lot of money?\"\n\n\"It's not likely to be more than a few thousands,\" replied Narramore.\n\"And the chances are I shall go on in the old way. What's the good of a\nfew thousands? I haven't the energy to go off and enjoy myself in your\nfashion. One of these days I may think of getting married, and\nmarriage, you know, is devilish expensive. I should like to have three\nor four thousand a year; you can't start housekeeping on less, if\nyou're not to be bored to death with worries. Perhaps I may get a\npartnership in our house. I began life in the brass bedstead line, and\nI may as well stick to brass bedsteads to the end the demand isn't\nlikely to fall off. Please fill my glass again.\"\n\nHilliard, the while, had tossed off his second tumbler. He began to\ntalk at random.\n\n\"I shall go to London first of all. I may go abroad. Reckon a pound a\nday. Three hundred and--how many days are there in a year? Three\nhundred and sixty-five. That doesn't allow me two years. I want two\nyears of life. Half a sovereign a day, then. One can do a good deal\nwith half a sovereign a day--don't you think?\"\n\n\"Not very much, if you're particular about your wine.\"\n\n\"Wine doesn't matter. Honest ale and Scotch whisky will serve well\nenough. Understand me; I'm not going in for debauchery, and I'm not\ngoing to play the third-rate swell. There's no enjoyment in making a\nbeast of oneself, and none for me in strutting about the streets like\nan animated figure out of a tailor's window. I want to know the taste\nof free life, human life. I want to forget that I ever sat at a desk,\ndrawing to scale--drawing damned machines. I want to----\"\n\nHe checked himself. Narramore looked at him with curiosity.\n\n\"It's a queer thing to me, Hilliard,\" he remarked, when his friend\nturned away, \"that you've kept so clear of women. Now, anyone would\nthink you were just the fellow to get hobbled in that way.\"\n\n\"I daresay,\" muttered the other. \"Yes, it _is_ a queer thing. I have\nbeen saved, I suppose, by the necessity of supporting my relatives.\nI've seen so much of women suffering from poverty that it has got me\ninto the habit of thinking of them as nothing but burdens to a man.\"\n\n\"As they nearly always are.\"\n\n\"Yes, nearly always.\"\n\nNarramore pondered with his amiable smile; the other, after a moment's\ngloom, shook himself free again, and talked with growing exhilaration\nof the new life that had dawned before him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nHilliard's lodgings--they were represented by a single room--commanded\na prospect which, to him a weariness and a disgust, would have seemed\nimpressive enough to eyes beholding it for the first time. On the\nafternoon of his last day at Dudley he stood by the window and looked\nforth, congratulating himself, with a fierceness of emotion which\ndefied misgiving, that he would gaze no more on this scene of his\nservitude.\n\nThe house was one of a row situated on a terrace, above a muddy\ndeclivity marked with footpaths. It looked over a wide expanse of waste\nground, covered in places with coarse herbage, but for the most part\nundulating in bare tracts of slag and cinder. Opposite, some quarter of\na mile away, rose a lofty dome-shaped hill, tree-clad from base to\nsummit, and rearing above the bare branches of its topmost trees the\nruined keep of Dudley Castle. Along the foot of this hill ran the\nhighway which descends from Dudley town--hidden by rising ground on the\nleft--to the low-lying railway-station; there, beyond, the eye\ntraversed a great plain, its limit the blending of earth and sky in\nlurid cloud. A ray of yellow sunset touched the height and its crowning\nruin; at the zenith shone a space of pure pale blue save for these\npoints of relief the picture was colourless and uniformly sombre. Far\nand near, innumerable chimneys sent forth fumes of various density\nbroad-flung jets of steam, coldly white against the murky distance; wan\nsmoke from lime-kilns, wafted in long trails; reek of solid blackness\nfrom pits and forges, voluming aloft and far-floated by the sluggish\nwind.\n\nBorn at Birmingham, the son of a teacher of drawing, Maurice Hilliard\nhad spent most of his life in the Midland capital; to its grammar\nschool he owed an education just sufficiently prolonged to unfit him\nfor the tasks of an underling, yet not thorough enough to qualify him\nfor professional life. In boyhood he aspired to the career of an\nartist, but his father, himself the wreck of a would-be painter, rudely\ndiscouraged this ambition; by way of compromise between the\nmoney-earning craft and the beggarly art, he became a\nmechanical-draughtsman. Of late years he had developed a strong taste\nfor the study of architecture; much of his leisure was given to this\nsubject, and what money he could spare went in the purchase of books\nand prints which helped him to extend his architectural knowledge. In\nmoods of hope, he had asked himself whether it might not be possible to\nescape from bondage to the gods of iron, and earn a living in an\narchitect's office. That desire was now forgotten in his passionate\nresolve to enjoy liberty without regard for the future.\n\nAll his possessions, save the articles of clothing which he would carry\nwith him, were packed in a couple of trunks, to be sent on the morrow\nto Birmingham, where they would lie in the care of his friend\nNarramore. Kinsfolk he had none whom he cared to remember, except his\nsister; she lived at Wolverhampton, a wife and mother, in narrow but\nnot oppressive circumstances, and Hilliard had taken leave of her in a\nshort visit some days ago. He would not wait for the wedding of his\nsister-in-law enough that she was provided for, and that his conscience\nwould always be at ease on her account.\n\nFor he was troubled with a conscience--even with one unusually\npoignant. An anecdote from his twentieth year depicts this feature of\nthe man. He and Narramore were walking one night in a very poor part of\nBirmingham, and for some reason they chanced to pause by a\nshop-window--a small window, lighted with one gas-jet, and laid out\nwith a miserable handful of paltry wares; the shop, however, was newly\nopened, and showed a pathetic attempt at cleanliness and neatness. The\nfriends asked each other how it could possibly benefit anyone to embark\nin such a business as that, and laughed over the display. While he was\nlaughing, Hilliard became aware of a woman in the doorway, evidently\nthe shopkeeper; she had heard their remarks and looked distressed.\nInfinitely keener was the pang which Maurice experienced; he could not\nforgive himself, kept exclaiming how brutally he had behaved, and sank\ninto gloominess. Not very long after, he took Narramore to walk in the\nsame direction; they came again to the little shop, and Hilliard\nsurprised his companion with a triumphant shout. The window was now\nlaid out in a much more promising way, with goods of modest value. \"You\nremember?\" said the young man. \"I couldn't rest till I had sent her\nsomething. She'll wonder to the end of her life who the money came\nfrom. But she's made use of it, poor creature, and it'll bring her\nluck.\"\n\nOnly the hopeless suppression of natural desires, the conflict through\nyears of ardent youth with sordid circumstances, could have brought him\nto the pass he had now reached--one of desperation centred in self.\nEvery suggestion of native suavity and prudence was swept away in\ntumultuous revolt. Another twelvemonth of his slavery and he would have\nyielded to brutalising influences which rarely relax their hold upon a\nman. To-day he was prompted by the instinct of flight from peril\nthreatening all that was worthy in him.\n\nJust as the last glimmer of daylight vanished from his room there\nsounded a knock at the door.\n\n\"Your tea's ready, Mr. Hilliard,\" called a woman's voice.\n\nHe took his meals downstairs in the landlady's parlour. Appetite at\npresent lie had none, but the pretence of eating was a way of passing\nthe time; so he descended and sat down at the prepared table.\n\nHis wandering eyes fell on one of the ornaments of the room--Mrs.\nBrewer's album. On first coming to live in the house, two years ago, he\nhad examined this collection of domestic portraits, and subsequently,\nfrom time to time, had taken up the album to look at one photograph\nwhich interested him. Among an assemblage of types excelling in\nugliness of feature and hideousness of costume--types of toil-worn age,\nof ungainly middle life, and of youth lacking every grace, such as are\nexhibited in the albums of the poor--there was discoverable one female\nportrait in which, the longer he gazed at it, Hilliard found an\never-increasing suggestiveness of those qualities he desired in woman.\nUnclasping the volume, he opened immediately at this familiar face. A\nmonth or two had elapsed since he last regarded it, and the countenance\ntook possession of him with the same force as ever.\n\nIt was that of a young woman probably past her twentieth year. Unlike\nher neighbours in the album, she had not bedizened herself before\nsitting to be portrayed. The abundant hair was parted simply and\nsmoothly from her forehead and tightly plaited behind; she wore a linen\ncollar, and, so far as could be judged from the portion included in the\npicture, a homely cloth gown. Her features were comely and intelligent,\nand exhibited a gentleness, almost a meekness of expression which was\nas far as possible from seeming affected. Whether she smiled or looked\nsad Hilliard had striven vainly to determine. Her lips appeared to\nsmile, but in so slight a degree that perchance it was merely an effect\nof natural line; whereas, if the mouth were concealed, a profound\nmelancholy at once ruled the visage.\n\nWho she was Hilliard had no idea. More than once he had been on the\npoint of asking his landlady, but characteristic delicacies restrained\nhim: he feared Mrs. Brewer's mental comment, and dreaded the possible\ndisclosure that he had admired a housemaid or someone of yet lower\ncondition. Nor could he trust his judgment of the face: perhaps it\nshone only by contrast with so much ugliness on either side of it;\nperhaps, in the starved condition of his senses, he was ready to find\nperfection in any female countenance not frankly repulsive.\n\nYet, no; it was a beautiful face. Beautiful, at all events, in the\nsense of being deeply interesting, in the strength of its appeal to his\nemotions. Another man might pass it slightingly; to him it spoke as no\nother face had ever spoken. It awakened in him a consciousness of\nprofound sympathy.\n\nWhile he still sat at table his landlady came in. She was a worthy\nwoman of her class, not given to vulgar gossip. Her purpose in entering\nthe room at this moment was to ask Hilliard whether he had a likeness\nof himself which he could spare her, as a memento.\n\n\"I'm sorry I don't possess such a thing,\" he answered, laughing,\nsurprised that the woman should care enough about him to make the\nrequest. \"But, talking of photographs, would you tell me who this is?\"\n\nThe album lay beside him, and a feeling of embarrassment, as he saw\nMrs. Brewer's look rest upon it, impelled him to the decisive question.\n\n\"That? Oh! that's a friend of my daughter Martha's--Eve Madeley. I'm\nsure I don't wonder at you noticing her. But it doesn't do her justice;\nshe's better looking than that. It was took better than two years\nago--why, just before you came to me, Mr. Hilliard. She was going\naway--to London.\"\n\n\"Eve Madeley.\" He repeated the name to himself, and liked it.\n\n\"She's had a deal of trouble, poor thing,\" pursued the landlady. \"We\nwas sorry to lose sight of her, but glad, I'm sure, that she went away\nto do better for herself. She hasn't been home since then, and we don't\nhear of her coming, and I'm sure nobody can be surprised. But our\nMartha heard from her not so long ago--why, it was about\nChristmas-time.\"\n\n\"Is she\"--he was about to add, \"in service?\" but could not voice the\nwords. \"She has an engagement in London?\"\n\n\"Yes; she's a bookkeeper, and earns her pound a week. She was always\nclever at figures. She got on so well at the school that they wanted\nher to be a teacher, but she didn't like it. Then Mr. Reckitt, the\nironmonger, a friend of her father's, got her to help him with his\nbooks and bills of an evening, and when she was seventeen, because his\nbusiness was growing and he hadn't much of a head for figures himself,\nhe took her regular into the shop. And glad she was to give up the\nschool-teaching, for she could never abear it.\"\n\n\"You say she had a lot of trouble?\"\n\n\"Ah, that indeed she had! And all her father's fault. But for him,\nfoolish man, they might have been a well-to-do family. But he's had to\nsuffer for it himself, too. He lives up here on the hill, in a poor\ncottage, and takes wages as a timekeeper at Robinson's when he ought to\nhave been paying men of his own. The drink--that's what it was. When\nour Martha first knew them they were living at Walsall, and if it\nhadn't a' been for Eve they'd have had no home at all. Martha got to\nknow her at the Sunday-school; Eve used to teach a class. That's seven\nor eight years ago; she was only a girl of sixteen, but she had the\nways of a grown-up woman, and very lucky it was for them belonging to\nher. Often and often they've gone for days with nothing but a dry loaf,\nand the father spending all he got at the public.\"\n\n\"Was it a large family?\" Hilliard inquired.\n\n\"Well, let me see; at that time there was Eve's two sisters and her\nbrother. Two other children had died, and the mother was dead, too. I\ndon't know much about _her_, but they say she was a very good sort of\nwoman, and it's likely the eldest girl took after her. A quieter and\nmodester girl than Eve there never was. Our Martha lived with her aunt\nat Walsall--that's my only sister, and she was bed-rid, poor thing, and\nhad Martha to look after her. And when she died, and Martha came back\nhere to us, the Madeley family came here as well, 'cause the father got\nsome kind of work. But he couldn't keep it, and he went off I don't\nknow where, and Eve had the children to keep and look after. We used to\ndo what we could to help her, but it was a cruel life for a poor thing\nof her age--just when she ought to have been enjoying her life, as you\nmay say.\"\n\nHilliard's interest waxed.\n\n\"Then,\" pursued Mrs. Brewer, \"the next sister to Eve, Laura her name\nwas, went to Birmingham, into a sweetstuff shop, and that was the last\never seen or heard of her. She wasn't a girl to be depended upon, and I\nnever thought she'd come to good, and whether she's alive or dead\nthere's no knowing. Eve took it to heart, that she did. And not six\nmonths after, the other girl had the 'sipelas, and she died, and just\nas they was carrying her coffin out of the house, who should come up\nbut her father! He'd been away for nearly two years, just sending a\nlittle money now and then, and he didn't even know the girl had been\nailing. And when he saw the coffin, it took him so that he fell down\njust like a dead man. You wouldn't have thought it, but there's no\nknowing what goes on in people's minds. Well, if you'll believe it,\nfrom that day he was so changed we didn't seem to know him. He turned\nquite religious, and went regular to chapel, and has done ever since;\nand he wouldn't touch a drop of anything, tempt him who might. It was a\ncase of conversion, if ever there was one.\n\n\"So there remained only Eve and her brother?\"\n\n\"Yes. He was a steady lad, Tom Madeley, and never gave his sister much\ntrouble. He earns his thirty shillings a week now. Well, and soon after\nshe saw her father going on all right, Eve left home. I don't wonder at\nit; it wasn't to be expected she could forgive him for all the harm and\nsorrows he'd caused. She went to Birmingham for a few months, and then\nshe came back one day to tell us she'd got a place in London. And she\nbrought that photo to give us to remember her by. But, as I said, it\nisn't good enough.\"\n\n\"Does she seem to be happier now?\"\n\n\"She hasn't wrote more than once or twice, but she's doing well, and\nwhatever happens she's not the one to complain. It's a blessing she's\nalways had her health. No doubt she's made friends in London, but we\nhaven't heard about them. Martha was hoping she'd have come for\nChristmas, but it seems she couldn't get away for long enough from\nbusiness. I'd tell you her address, but I don't remember it. I've never\nbeen in London myself. Martha knows it, of course. She might look in\nto-night, and if she does I'll ask her.\"\n\nHilliard allowed this suggestion to pass without remark. He was not\nquite sure that he desired to know Miss Madeley's address.\n\nBut later in the evening, when, after walking for two or three hours\nabout the cold, dark roads, he came in to have his supper and go to\nbed, Mrs. Brewer smilingly offered him a scrap of paper.\n\n\"There,\" she said, \"that's where she's living. London's a big place,\nand you mayn't be anywhere near, but if you happened to walk that way,\nwe should take it kindly if you'd just leave word that we're always\nglad to hear from her, and hope she's well.\"\n\nWith a mixture of reluctance and satisfaction the young man took the\npaper, glanced at it, and folded it to put in his pocket. Mrs. Brewer\nwas regarding him, and he felt that his silence must seem ungracious.\n\n\"I will certainly call and leave your message,\" he said.\n\nUp in his bed-room lie sat for a long time with the paper lying open\nbefore him. And when he slept his rest was troubled with dreams of an\nanxious search about the highways and byways of London for that\nhalf-sad, half-smiling face which had so wrought upon his imagination.\n\nLong before daylight he awoke at the sound of bells, and hootings, and\nwhistlings, which summoned the Dudley workfolk to their labour. For the\nfirst time in his life he heard these hideous noises with pleasure:\nthey told him that the day of his escape had come. Unable to lie still,\nhe rose at once, and went out into the chill dawn. Thoughts of Eve\nMadeley no longer possessed him; a glorious sense of freedom excluded\nevery recollection of his past life, and he wandered aimlessly with a\nsong in his heart.\n\nAt breakfast, the sight of Mrs. Brewer's album tempted him to look once\nmore at the portrait, but he did not yield.\n\n\"Shall we ever see you again, I wonder?\" asked his landlady, when the\nmoment arrived for leave-taking.\n\n\"If I am ever again in Dudley, I shall come here,\" he answered kindly.\n\nBut on his way to the station he felt a joyful assurance that fate\nwould have no power to draw him back again into this circle of fiery\ntorments.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nTwo months later, on a brilliant morning of May, Hilliard again awoke\nfrom troubled dreams, but the sounds about him had no association with\nbygone miseries. From the courtyard upon which his window looked there\ncame a ringing of gay laughter followed by shrill, merry gossip in a\nforeign tongue. Somewhere in the neighbourhood a church bell was\npealing. Presently footsteps hurried along the corridor, and an\nimpatient voice shouted repeatedly, \"Alphonse! Alphonse!\"\n\nHe was in Paris; had been there for six weeks, and now awoke with a\nsense of loneliness, a desire to be back among his own people.\n\nIn London he had spent only a fortnight. It was not a time that he\ncared to reflect upon. No sooner had he found himself in the\nmetropolis, alone and free, with a pocketful of money, than a delirium\npossessed him. Every resolution notwithstanding, he yielded to London's\ngrossest lures. All he could remember, was a succession of\nextravagances, beneath a sunless sky, with chance companions whose\nfaces he had forgotten five minutes after parting with them. Sovereign\nafter sovereign melted out of his hand; the end of the second week\nfound his capital diminished by some five-and-twenty pounds. In an hour\nof physical and moral nausea, he packed his travelling-bag, journeyed\nto Newhaven, and as a sort of penance, crossed the Channel by\nthird-class passage. Arrived in Paris, he felt himself secure, and soon\nrecovered sanity.\n\nThanks to his studious habits, he was equipped with book-French; now,\nboth for economy's sake and for his mental advantage, he struggled with\nthe spoken language, and so far succeeded as to lodge very cheaply in a\nrather disreputable hotel, and to eat at restaurants where dinner of\nseveral courses cost two francs and a half. His life was\nirreproachable; he studied the Paris of art and history. But perforce\nhe remained companionless, and solitude had begun to weigh upon him.\n\nThis morning, whilst he sat over his bowl of coffee and _petit pain_, a\ncertain recollection haunted him persistently. Yesterday, in turning\nout his pockets, he had come upon a scrap of paper, whereon was written:\n\n\"93, Belmont Street, Chalk Farm Road, London, N.W.\"\n\nThis formula it was which now kept running through his mind, like a\nrefrain which will not be dismissed.\n\nHe reproached himself for neglect of his promise to Mrs. Brewer. More\nthan that, he charged himself with foolish disregard of a possibility\nwhich might have boundless significance for him. Here, it seemed, was\nsufficient motive for a return to London. The alternative was to wander\non, and see more of foreign countries; a tempting suggestion, but\nmarred by the prospect of loneliness. He would go back among his own\npeople and make friends. Without comradeship, liberty had little savour.\n\nStill travelling with as small expense as might be, he reached London\nin the forenoon, left his luggage at Victoria Station, and, after a\nmeal, betook himself in the northerly direction. It was a rainy and\nuncomfortable day, but this did not much affect his spirits; he felt\nlike a man new risen from illness, seemed to have cast off something\nthat had threatened his very existence, and marvelled at the state of\nmind in which it had been possible for him to inhabit London without\nturning his steps towards the address of Eve Madeley.\n\nHe discovered Belmont Street. It consisted of humble houses, and was\ndreary enough to look upon. As he sought for No. 93, a sudden\nnervousness attacked him; he became conscious all at once of the\nstrangeness of his position. At this hour it was unlikely that Eve\nwould be at home an inquiry at the house and the leaving of a verbal\nmessage would discharge his obligation; but he proposed more than that.\nIt was his resolve to see Eve herself, to behold the face which, in a\npicture, had grown so familiar to him. Yet till this moment he had\noverlooked the difficulties of the enterprise. Could he, on the\nstrength of an acquaintance with Mrs. Brewer, claim the friendly\nregards of this girl who had never heard his name? If he saw her once,\non what pretext could he seek for a second meeting?\n\nPossibly he would not desire it. Eve in her own person might disenchant\nhim.\n\nMeanwhile he had discovered the house, and without further debate he\nknocked. The door was opened by a woman of ordinary type, slatternly,\nand with suspicious eye.\n\n\"Miss Madeley _did_ live here,\" she said, \"but she's been gone a month\nor more.\"\n\n\"Can you tell me where she is living now?\"\n\nAfter a searching look the woman replied that she could not. In the\nmanner of her kind, she was anxious to dismiss the inquirer and get the\ndoor shut. Gravely disappointed, Hilliard felt unable to turn away\nwithout a further question.\n\n\"Perhaps you know where she is, or was, employed?\"\n\nBut no information whatever was forthcoming. It very rarely is under\nsuch circumstances, for a London landlady, compounded in general of\ncraft and caution, tends naturally to reticence on the score of her\nformer lodgers. If she has parted with them on amicable terms, her\ninstinct is to shield them against the menace presumed in every\ninquiry; if her mood is one of ill-will, she refuses information lest\nthe departed should reap advantage. And then, in the great majority of\ncases she has really no information to give.\n\nThe door closed with that severity of exclusion in which London doors\nexcel, and Hilliard turned despondently away. He was just consoling\nhimself with the thought that Eve would probably, before long,\ncommunicate her new address to the friends at Dudley, and by that means\nhe might hear of it, when a dirty-faced little girl, who had stood\nwithin earshot while he was talking, and who had followed him to the\nend of the street, approached him with an abrupt inquiry.\n\n\"Was you asking for Miss Madeley, Sir?\"\n\n\"Yes, I was; do you know anything of her?\"\n\n\"My mother did washing for her, and when she moved I had to take some\nthings of hers to the new address.\"\n\n\"Then you remember it?\"\n\n\"It's a goodish way from 'ere, Sir. Shall I go with you?\"\n\nHilliard understood. Like the good Samaritan of old, he took out\ntwopence. The face of the dirty little girl brightened wonderfully.\n\n\"Tell me the address; that will be enough.\"\n\n\"Do you know Gower Place, Sir?\"\n\n\"Somewhere near Gower Street, I suppose?\"\n\nHis supposition was confirmed, and he learnt the number of the house to\nwhich Miss Madeley had transferred herself. In that direction he at\nonce bent his steps.\n\nGower Place is in the close neighbourhood of Euston Road; Hilliard\nremembered that he had passed the end of it on his first arrival in\nLondon, when he set forth from Euston Station to look for a lodging. It\nwas a mere chance that he had not turned into this very street, instead\nof going further. Several windows displayed lodging-cards. On the\nwhole, it looked a better locality than Belmont Street. Eve's removal\nhither might signify an improvement of circumstances.\n\nThe house which he sought had a clean doorstep and unusually bright\nwindows. His knock was answered quickly, and by a young, sprightly\nwoman, who smiled upon him.\n\n\"I believe Miss Madeley lives here?\"\n\n\"Yes, she does.\"\n\n\"She is not at home just now?\"\n\n\"No. She went out after breakfast, and I'm sure I can't say when she'll\nbe back.\"\n\nHilliard felt a slight wonder at this uncertainty. The young woman,\nobserving his expression, added with vivacious friendliness:\n\n\"Do you want to see her on business?\"\n\n\"No; a private matter.\"\n\nThis occasioned a smirk.\n\n\"Well, she hasn't any regular hours at present. Sometimes she comes to\ndinner, sometimes she doesn't. Sometimes she comes to tea, but just as\noften she isn't 'ome till late. P'r'aps you'd like to leave your name?\"\n\n\"I think I'll call again.\"\n\n\"Did you expect to find her at 'ome now?\" asked the young woman, whose\ncuriosity grew more eager as she watched Hilliard's countenance.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" he replied, neglecting the question, \"I should find her here\nto-morrow morning?\"\n\n\"Well, I can say as someone's going to call, you know.\"\n\n\"Please do so.\"\n\nTherewith he turned away, anxious to escape a volley of interrogation\nfor which the landlady's tongue was primed.\n\nHe walked into Gower Street, and pondered the awkward interview that\nnow lay before him. On his calling to-morrow, Miss Madeley would\ndoubtless come to speak with him at the door; even supposing she had a\nparlour at her disposal, she was not likely to invite a perfect\nstranger into the house. How could he make her acquaintance on the\ndoorstep? To be sure, he brought a message, but this commission had\nbeen so long delayed that he felt some shame about discharging it. In\nany case, his delivery of the message would sound odd; there would be\nembarrassment on both sides.\n\nWhy was Eve so uncertain in her comings and goings? Necessity of\nbusiness, perhaps. Yet he had expected quite the opposite state of\nthings. From Mrs. Brewer's description of the girl's character, he had\nimagined her leading a life of clockwork regularity. The point was very\ntrivial, but it somehow caused a disturbance of his thoughts, which\ntended to misgiving.\n\nIn the meantime he had to find quarters for himself. Why not seek them\nin Gower Place?\n\nAfter ten minutes' sauntering, he retraced his steps, and walked down\nthe side of the street opposite to that on which Eve's lodgings were\nsituated. Nearly over against that particular house was a window with a\ncard. Carelessly he approached the door, and carelessly asked to see\nthe rooms that were to let. They were comfortless, but would suit his\npurpose for a time. He engaged a sitting-room on the ground-floor, and\na bed-room above, and went to fetch his luggage from Victoria Station.\n\nOn the steamer last night he had not slept, and now that he was once\nmore housed, an overpowering fatigue constrained him to lie down and\nclose his eyes. Almost immediately lie fell into oblivion, and lay\nsleeping on the cranky sofa, until the entrance of a girl with\ntea-things awakened him.\n\nFrom his parlour window he could very well observe the houses opposite\nwithout fear of drawing attention from any one on that side; and so it\nhappened that, without deliberate purpose of espial, he watched the\ndoor of Eve Madeley's residence for a long time; till, in fact, he grew\nweary of the occupation. No one had entered; no one had come forth. At\nhalf-past seven he took his hat and left the house.\n\nScarcely had he closed the door behind him when he became aware that a\nlightly tripping and rather showily dressed girl, who was coming down\nthe other side of the way, had turned off the pavement and was plying\nthe knocker at the house which interested him. He gazed eagerly.\nImpossible that a young person of that garb and deportment should be\nEve Madeley. Her face was hidden from him, and at this distance he\ncould not have recognised the features, even presuming that his\nfamiliarity with the portrait, taken more than two years ago, would\nenable him to identify Eve when he saw her. The door opened; the girl\nwas admitted. Afraid of being noticed, he walked on.\n\nThe distance to the head of the street was not more than thirty yards;\nthere lay Gower Street, on the right hand the Metropolitan station, to\nthe left a long perspective southwards. Delaying in doubt as to his\ncourse, Hilliard glanced back. From the house which attracted his eyes\nhe saw come forth the girl who had recently entered, and close\nfollowing her another young woman. They began to walk sharply towards\nwhere he stood.\n\nHe did not stir, and the couple drew so near that he could observe\ntheir faces. In the second girl he recognised--or believed that he\nrecognised--Eve Madeley.\n\nShe wore a costume in decidedly better taste than her companion's; for\nall that, her appearance struck him as quite unlike that he would have\nexpected Eve Madeley to present. He had thought of her as very plainly,\nperhaps poorly, clad; but this attire was ornate, and looked rather\nexpensive; it might be in the mode of the new season. In figure, she\nwas altogether a more imposing young woman than he had pictured to\nhimself. His pulses were sensibly quickened as he looked at her.\n\nThe examination was of necessity hurried. Walking at a sharp pace, they\nrapidly came close to where he stood. He drew aside to let them pass,\nand at that moment caught a few words of their conversation.\n\n\"I told you we should be late,\" exclaimed the unknown girl, in friendly\nremonstrance.\n\n\"What does it matter?\" replied Eve--if Eve it were. \"I hate standing at\nthe doors. We shall find seats somewhere.\"\n\nHer gay, careless tones astonished the listener. Involuntarily he began\nto follow; but at the edge of the pavement in Gower Street they\nstopped, and by advancing another step or two he distinctly overheard\nthe continuation of their talk.\n\n\"The 'bus will take a long time.\"\n\n\"Bother the 'bus!\" This was Eve Madeley again--if Eve it could really\nbe. \"We'll have a cab. Look, there's a crawler in Euston Road. I've\nstopped him!\"\n\n\"I say, Eve, you _are_ going it!\"\n\nThis exclamation from the other girl was the last sentence that fell on\nHilliard's ear. They both tripped off towards the cab which Eve's\ngesture had summoned. He saw them jump in and drive away.\n\n\"I say, Eve, you _are_ going it!\" Why, there his doubt was settled; the\nname confirmed him in his identification. But he stood motionless with\nastonishment.\n\nThey were going to a theatre, of course. And Eve spoke as if money were\nof no consequence to her. She had the look, the tones, of one bent on\nenjoying herself, of one who habitually pursued pleasure, and that in\nits most urban forms.\n\nHer companion had a voice of thinner quality, of higher note, which\nproclaimed a subordinate character. It sounded, moreover, with the\nLondon accent, while Eve's struck a more familiar note to the man of\nthe Midlands. Eve seemed to be the elder of the two; it could not be\nthought for a moment that her will was guided by that of the more\ntrivial girl.\n\nEve Madeley--the meek, the melancholy, the long-suffering, the\npious--what did it all mean?\n\nUtterly bewildered, the young man walked on without thought of\ndirection, and rambled dreamily about the streets for an hour or two.\nHe could not make up his mind whether or not to fulfil the promise of\ncalling to see Miss Madeley to-morrow morning. At one moment he\nregretted having taken lodgings in Gower Place; at another he\ndetermined to make use of his advantage, and play the spy upon Eve's\nmovements without scruple. The interest she had hitherto excited in him\nwas faint indeed compared with emotions such as this first glimpse of\nher had kindled and fanned. A sense of peril warned him to hold aloof;\ntumult of his senses rendered the warning useless.\n\nAt eleven o'clock he was sitting by his bedroom window, in darkness,\nwatching the house across the way.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nIt was just upon midnight when Eve returned. She came at a quick walk,\nand alone; the light of the street-lamps showed her figure distinctly\nenough to leave the watcher in no doubt. A latchkey admitted her to the\nhouse. Presently there appeared a light at an upper window, and a\nshadow kept moving across the blind. When the light was extinguished\nHilliard went to bed, but that night he slept little.\n\nThe next morning passed in restless debate with himself. He did not\ncross the way to call upon Eve: the thought of speaking with her on the\ndoorstep of a lodging-house proved intolerable. All day long he kept\nhis post of observation. Other persons he saw leave and enter the\nhouse, but Miss Madeley did not come forth. That he could have missed\nher seemed impossible, for even while eating his meals he remained by\nthe window. Perchance she had left home very early in the morning, but\nit was unlikely.\n\nThrough the afternoon it rained: the gloomy sky intensified his fatigue\nand despondence. About six o'clock, exhausted in mind and body, he had\nallowed his attention to stray, when the sudden clang of a street organ\nstartled him. His eyes turned in the wonted direction--and instantly he\nsprang up. To clutch his hat, to rush from the room and from the house,\noccupied but a moment. There, walking away on the other side, was Eve.\nHer fawn-coloured mantle, her hat with the yellow flowers, were the\nsame as yesterday. The rain had ceased; in the western sky appeared\npromise of a fair evening.\n\nHilliard pursued her in a parallel line. At the top of the street she\ncrossed towards him; he let her pass by and followed closely. She\nentered the booking-office of Gower Street station; he drew as near as\npossible and heard her ask for a ticket--\n\n\"Healtheries; third return.\"\n\nThe slang term for the Health Exhibition at Kensington was familiar to\nhim from the English papers he had seen in Paris. As soon as Eve had\npassed on he obtained a like ticket and hastened down the steps in\npursuit. A minute or two and he was sitting face to face with her in\nthe railway carriage.\n\nHe could now observe her at his leisure and compare her features with\nthose represented in the photograph. Mrs. Brewer had said truly that\nthe portrait did not do her justice; he saw the resemblance, yet what a\ndifference between the face he had brooded over at Dudley and that\nwhich lived before him! A difference not to be accounted for by mere\nlapse of time. She could not, he thought, have changed greatly in the\nlast two or three years, for her age at the time of sitting for the\nphotograph must have been at least one-and-twenty. She did not look\nolder than he had expected: it was still a young face, but--and herein\nhe found its strangeness--that of a woman who views life without\nembarrassment, without anxiety. She sat at her ease, casting careless\nglances this way and that. When her eyes fell upon him he winced, yet\nshe paid no more heed to him than to the other passengers.\n\nPresently she became lost in thought; her eyes fell. Ah! now the\nresemblance to the portrait came out more distinctly. Her lips shaped\nthemselves to that expression which he knew so well, the half-smile\ntelling of habitual sadness.\n\nHis fixed gaze recalled her to herself, and immediately the countenance\nchanged beyond recognition. Her eyes wandered past him with a look of\ncold if not defiant reserve; the lips lost all their sweetness. He was\nchilled with vague distrust, and once again asked himself whether this\ncould be the Eve Madeley whose history he had heard.\n\nAgain she fell into abstraction, and some trouble seemed to grow upon\nher mind. It was difficult now to identify her with the girl who had\ntalked and laughed so gaily last evening. Towards the end of the\njourney a nervous restlessness began to appear in her looks and\nmovements. Hilliard felt that he had annoyed her by the persistency of\nhis observation, and tried to keep his eyes averted. But no; the\ndisturbance she betrayed was due to some other cause; probably she paid\nnot the least regard to him.\n\nAt Earl's Court she alighted hurriedly. By this time Hilliard had begun\nto feel shame in the ignoble part he was playing, but choice he had\nnone--the girl drew him irresistibly to follow and watch her. Among the\ncrowd entering the Exhibition he could easily keep her in sight without\nrisk of his espial being detected. That Eve had come to keep an\nappointment with some acquaintance he felt sure, and at any cost he\nmust discover who the person was.\n\nThe event justified him with unexpected suddenness. No sooner had she\npassed the turnstile than a man stepped forward, saluting her in form.\nEve shook hands with him, and they walked on.\n\nUncontrollable wrath seized on Hilliard and shook him from head to\nfoot. A meeting of this kind was precisely what he had foreseen, and he\nresented it violently.\n\nEve's acquaintance had the external attributes of a gentleman. One\ncould not easily imagine him a clerk or a shop-assistant smartened up\nfor the occasion. He was plain of feature, but wore a pleasant, honest\nlook, and his demeanour to the girl showed not only good breeding but\nunmistakable interest of the warmest kind. His age might perhaps be\nthirty; he was dressed well, and in all respects conventionally.\n\nIn Eve's behaviour there appeared a very noticeable reserve; she rarely\nturned her face to him while he spoke, and seemed to make only the\nbriefest remarks. Her attention was given to the objects they passed.\n\nTotally unconscious of the scenes through which he was moving, Hilliard\ntracked the couple for more than an hour. He noticed that the man once\ntook out his watch, and from this trifling incident he sought to derive\na hope; perhaps Eve would be quit ere long of the detested\ncompanionship. They came at length to where a band was playing, and sat\ndown on chairs; the pursuer succeeded in obtaining a seat behind them,\nbut the clamour of instruments overpowered their voices, or rather the\nman's voice, for Eve seemed not to speak at all. One moment, when her\nneighbour's head approached nearer than usual to hers, she drew\nslightly away.\n\nThe music ceased, whereupon Eve's companion again consulted his watch.\n\n\"It's a most unfortunate thing.\" He was audible now. \"I can't possibly\nstay longer.\"\n\nEve moved on her chair, as if in readiness to take leave of him, but\nshe did not speak.\n\n\"You think it likely you will meet Miss Ringrose?\"\n\nEve answered, but the listener could not catch her words.\n\n\"I'm so very sorry. If there had been any----\"\n\nThe voice sank, and Hilliard could only gather from observance of the\nman's face that he was excusing himself in fervent tones for the\nnecessity of departure. Then they both rose and walked a few yards\ntogether. Finally, with a sense of angry exultation, Hilliard saw them\npart.\n\nFor a little while Eve stood watching the musicians, who were making\nready to play a new piece. As soon as the first note sounded she moved\nslowly, her eyes cast down. With fiercely throbbing heart, thinking and\ndesiring and hoping he knew not what, Hilliard once more followed her.\nNight had now fallen; the grounds of the Exhibition shone with\nmany-coloured illumination; the throng grew dense. It was both easy and\nnecessary to keep very near to the object of his interest.\n\nThere sounded a clinking of plates, cups, and glasses. People were\nsitting at tables in the open air, supplied with refreshments by the\nwaiters who hurried hither and thither. Eve, after a show of\nhesitation, took a seat by a little round table which stood apart; her\npursuer found a place whence he could keep watch. She gave an order,\nand presently there was brought to her a glass of wine with a sandwich.\n\nHilliard called for a bottle of ale: he was consumed with thirst.\n\n\"Dare I approach her?\" he asked himself. \"Is it possible? And, if\npossible, is it any use?\"\n\nThe difficulty was to explain his recognition of her. But for that, he\nmight justify himself in addressing her.\n\nShe had finished her wine and was looking round. Her glance fell upon\nhim, and for a moment rested. With a courage not his own, Hilliard\nrose, advanced, and respectfully doffed his hat.\n\n\"Miss Madeley----\"\n\nThe note was half interrogative, but his voice failed before he could\nadd another syllable. Eve drew herself up, rigid in the alarm of female\ninstinct.\n\n\"I am a stranger to you,\" Hilliard managed to say. \"But I come from\nDudley; I know some of your friends----\"\n\nHis hurried words fell into coherence. At the name \"Dudley\" Eve's\nfeatures relaxed.\n\n\"Was it you who called at my lodgings the day before yesterday?\"\n\n\"I did. Your address was given me by Mrs. Brewer, in whose house I have\nlived for a long time. She wished me to call and to give you a kind\nmessage--to say how glad they would be to hear from you----\"\n\n\"But you _didn't_ leave the message.\"\n\nThe smile put Hilliard at his ease, it was so gentle and friendly.\n\n\"I wasn't able to come at the time I mentioned. I should have called\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"But how is it that you knew me? I think,\" she added, without waiting\nfor a reply, \"that I have seen you somewhere. But I can't remember\nwhere.\"\n\n\"Perhaps in the train this evening?\"\n\n\"Yes so it was You knew me then?\"\n\n\"I thought I did, for I happened to come out from my lodgings at the\nmoment you were leaving yours, just opposite, and we walked almost\ntogether to Gower Street station. I must explain that I have taken\nrooms in Gower Place. I didn't like to speak to you in the street; but\nnow that I have again chanced to see you----\"\n\n\"I still don't understand,\" said Eve, who was speaking with the most\nperfect ease of manner. \"I am not the only person living in that house.\nWhy should you take it for granted that I was Miss Madeley?\"\n\nHilliard had not ventured to seat himself; he stood before her, head\nrespectfully bent.\n\n\"At Mrs. Brewer's I saw your portrait.\"\n\nHer eyes fell.\n\n\"My portrait. You really could recognise me from that?\"\n\n\"Oh, readily! Will you allow me to sit down?\"\n\n\"Of course. I shall be glad to hear the news you have brought. I\ncouldn't imagine who it was had called and wanted to see me. But\nthere's another thing. I didn't think Mrs. Brewer knew my address. I\nhave moved since I wrote to her daughter.\"\n\n\"No; it was the old address she gave me. I ought to have mentioned\nthat: it escaped my mind. First of all I went to Belmont Street.\"\n\n\"Mysteries still!\" exclaimed Eve. \"The people _there_ couldn't know\nwhere I had gone to.\"\n\n\"A child who had carried some parcel for you to Gower Place volunteered\ninformation.\"\n\nOutwardly amused, and bearing herself as though no incident could\neasily disconcert her, Eve did not succeed in suppressing every sign of\nnervousness. Constrained by his wonder to study her with critical\nattention, the young man began to feel assured that she was consciously\nacting a part. That she should be able to carry it off so well, therein\nlay the marvel. Of course, London had done much for her. Possessing no\ncommon gifts, she must have developed remarkably under changed\nconditions, and must, indeed, have become a very different person from\nthe country girl who toiled to support her drunken father's family.\nHilliard remembered the mention of her sister who had gone to\nBirmingham disappeared; it suggested a characteristic of the Madeley\nblood, which possibly must be borne in mind if he would interpret Eve.\n\nShe rested her arms on the little round table.\n\n\"So Mrs. Brewer asked you to come and find me?\"\n\n\"It was only a suggestion, and I may as well tell you how it came\nabout. I used to have my meals in Mrs. Brewer's parlour, and to amuse\nmyself I looked over her album. There I found your portrait, and--well,\nit interested me, and I asked the name of the original.\"\n\nHilliard was now in command of himself; he spoke with simple\ndirectness, as his desires dictated.\n\n\"And Mrs. Brewer,\" said Eve, with averted eyes, \"told you about me?\"\n\n\"She spoke of you as her daughter's friend,\" was the evasive answer.\nEve seemed to accept it as sufficient, and there was a long silence.\n\n\"My name is Hilliard,\" the young man resumed. \"I am taking the first\nholiday, worth speaking of, that I have known for a good many years. At\nDudley my business was to make mechanical drawings, and I can't say\nthat I enjoyed the occupation.\"\n\n\"Are you going back to it?\"\n\n\"Not just yet. I have been in France, and I may go abroad again before\nlong.\"\n\n\"For your pleasure?\" Eve asked, with interest.\n\n\"To answer 'Yes' wouldn't quite express what I mean. I am learning to\nlive.\"\n\nShe hastily searched his face for the interpretation of these words,\nthen looked away, with grave, thoughtful countenance.\n\n\"By good fortune,\" Hilliard pursued. \"I have become possessed of money\nenough to live upon for a year or two. At the end of it I may find\nmyself in the old position, and have to be a living machine once more.\nBut I shall be able to remember that I was once a man.\"\n\nEve regarded him strangely, with wide, in tent eyes, as though his\nspeech had made a peculiar impression upon her.\n\n\"Can you see any sense in that?\" he asked, smiling.\n\n\"Yes. I think I understand you.\"\n\nShe spoke slowly, and Hilliard, watching her, saw in her face more of\nthe expression of her portrait than he had yet discovered. Her soft\ntone was much more like what he had expected to hear than her\nutterances hitherto.\n\n\"Have you always lived at Dudley?\" she asked.\n\nHe sketched rapidly the course of his life, without reference to\ndomestic circumstances. Before he had ceased speaking he saw that Eve's\nlook was directed towards something at a distance behind him; she\nsmiled, and at length nodded, in recognition of some person who\napproached. Then a voice caused him to look round.\n\n\"Oh, there you are! I have been hunting for you ever so long.\"\n\nAs soon as Hilliard saw the speaker, he had no difficulty in\nremembering her. It was Eve's companion of the day before yesterday,\nwith whom she had started for the theatre. The girl evidently felt some\nsurprise at discovering her friend in conversation with a man she did\nnot know; but Eve was equal to the situation, and spoke calmly.\n\n\"This gentleman is from my part of the world--from Dudley. Mr.\nHilliard--Miss Ringrose.\"\n\nHilliard stood up. Miss Ringrose, after attempting a bow of formal\ndignity, jerked out her hand, gave a shy little laugh, and said with\namusing abruptness--\n\n\"Do you really come from Dudley?\"\n\n\"I do really, Miss Ringrose. Why does it sound strange to you?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't mean that it sounds strange.\" She spoke in a high but not\nunmusical note, very quickly, and with timid glances to either side of\nher collocutor. \"But Eve--Miss Madeley--gave me the idea that Dudley\npeople must be great, rough, sooty men. Don't laugh at me, please. You\nknow very well, Eve, that you always talk in that way. Of course, I\nknew that there must be people of a different kind, but--there now,\nyou're making me confused, and I don't know what I meant to say.\"\n\nShe was a thin-faced, but rather pretty girl, with auburn hair.\nBelonging to a class which, especially in its women, has little\nintelligence to boast of, she yet redeemed herself from the charge of\ncommonness by a certain vivacity of feature and an agreeable suggestion\nof good feeling in her would-be frank but nervous manner. Hilliard\nlaughed merrily at the vision in her mind of \"great, rough, sooty men.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry to disappoint you, Miss Ringrose.\"\n\n\"No, but really--what sort of a place is Dudley? Is it true that they\ncall it the Black Country?\"\n\n\"Let us walk about,\" interposed Eve. \"Mr. Hilliard will tell you all he\ncan about the Black Country.\"\n\nShe moved on, and they rambled aimlessly; among cigar-smoking clerks\nand shopmen, each with the female of his kind in wondrous hat and\ndrapery; among domestic groups from the middle-class suburbs, and from\nregions of the artisan; among the frankly rowdy and the solemnly\nsuperior; here and there a man in evening dress, generally conscious of\nhis white tie and starched shirt, and a sprinkling of unattached young\nwomen with roving eyes. Hilliard, excited by the success of his\nadvances, and by companionship after long solitude, became very unlike\nhimself, talking and jesting freely. Most of the conversation passed\nbetween him and Miss Ringrose; Eve had fallen into an absent mood,\nanswered carelessly when addressed, laughed without genuine amusement,\nand sometimes wore the look of trouble which Hilliard had observed\nwhilst in the train.\n\nBefore long she declared that it was time to go home.\n\n\"What's the hurry?\" said her friend. \"It's nothing like ten o'clock\nyet--is it, Mr. Hilliard?\"\n\n\"I don't wish to stay any longer. Of course you needn't go unless you\nlike, Patty.\"\n\nHilliard had counted on travelling back with her; to his great\ndisappointment, Eve answered his request to be allowed to do so with a\ncoldly civil refusal which there was no misunderstanding.\n\n\"But I hope you will let me see you again?\"\n\n\"As you live so near me,\" she answered, \"we are pretty sure to meet.\nAre you coming or not, Patty?\"\n\n\"Oh, of course I shall go if you do.\"\n\nThe young man shook hands with them; rather formally with Eve, with\nPatty Ringrose as cordially as if they were old friends. And then he\nlost sight of them amid the throng.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nHow did Eve Madeley contrive to lead this life of leisure and\namusement? The question occupied Hilliard well on into the small hours;\nhe could hit upon no explanation which had the least plausibility.\n\nWas she engaged to be married to the man who met her at the Exhibition?\nHer behaviour in his company by no means supported such a surmise; yet\nthere must be something more than ordinary acquaintance between the two.\n\nMight not Patty Ringrose be able and willing to solve for him the\nriddle of Eve's existence? But he had no idea where Patty lived. He\nrecalled her words in Gower Street: \"You _are_ going it, Eve!\" and they\nstirred miserable doubts; yet something more than mere hope inclined\nhim to believe that the girl's life was innocent. Her look, her talk\nreassured him; so did her friendship with such a person as the\ningenuous Patty. On learning that he dwelt close by her she gave no\nsign of an uneasy conscience.\n\nIn any case, the contrast between her actual life and that suggested by\nMrs. Brewer's talk about her was singular enough. It supplied him with\na problem of which the interest would not easily be exhausted. But he\nmust pursue the study with due regard to honour and delicacy; he would\nact the spy no more. As Eve had said, they were pretty sure to meet\nbefore long; if his patience failed it was always possible for him to\nwrite a letter.\n\nFour days went by and he saw nothing of her. On the fifth, as he was\nwalking homeward in the afternoon, he came face to face with Miss\nMadeley in Gower Street. She stopped at once, and offered a friendly\nhand.\n\n\"Will you let me walk a little way with you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Certainly. I'm just going to change a book at Mudie's.\" She carried a\nlittle handbag. \"I suppose you have been going about London a great\ndeal? Don't the streets look beautiful at this time of the year?\"\n\n\"Beautiful? I'm not sure that I see much beauty.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't you? I delight in London. I had dreamt of it all my life\nbefore I came here. I always said to myself I should some day live in\nLondon.\"\n\nHer voice to-day had a vibrant quality which seemed to result from some\nagreeable emotion. Hilliard remarked a gleam in her eyes and a colour\nin her cheeks which gave her an appearance of better health than a few\ndays ago.\n\n\"You never go into the country?\" he said, feeling unable to join in her\npraise of London, though it was intelligible enough to him.\n\n\"I go now and then as far as Hampstead Heath,\" Eve answered with a\nsmile. \"If it's fine I shall be there next Sunday with Patty Ringrose.\"\n\nHilliard grasped the opportunity. Would she permit him to meet her and\nMiss Ringrose at Hampstead? Without shadow of constraint or\naffectation, Eve replied that such a meeting would give her pleasure:\nshe mentioned place and time at which they might conveniently encounter.\n\nHe walked with her all the way to the library, and attended her back to\nGower Place. The result of this conversation was merely to intensify\nthe conflict of feelings which Eve had excited in him. Her friendliness\ngave him no genuine satisfaction; her animated mood, in spite of the\ncharm to which he submitted, disturbed him with mistrust. Nothing she\nsaid sounded quite sincere, yet it was more difficult than ever to\nimagine that she played a part quite alien to her disposition.\n\nNo word had fallen from her which threw light upon her present\ncircumstances, and he feared to ask any direct question. It had\nsurprised him to learn that she subscribed to Mudie's. The book she\nbrought away with her was a newly published novel, and in the few words\nthey exchanged on the subject while standing at the library counter she\nseemed to him to exhibit a surprising acquaintance with the literature\nof the day. Of his own shortcomings in this respect he was but too\nsensible, and he began to feel himself an intellectual inferior, where\nevery probability had prepared him for the reverse.\n\nThe next morning he went to Mudie's on his own account, and came away\nwith volumes chosen from those which lay on the counter. He was tired\nof wandering about the town, and might as well pass his time in reading.\n\nWhen Sunday came, he sought the appointed spot at Hampstead, and there,\nafter an hour's waiting, met the two friends. Eve was no longer in her\nvivacious mood; brilliant sunshine, and the breeze upon the heath, had\nno power to inspirit her; spoke in monosyllables, and behaved with\nunaccountable reserve. Hilliard had no choice but to converse with\nPatty, who was as gay and entertaining as ever. In the course of their\ngossip he learnt that Miss Ringrose was employed at a music-shop, kept\nby her uncle, where she sold the latest songs and dances, and \"tried\nover\" on a piano any unfamiliar piece which a customer might think of\npurchasing. It was not easy to understand how these two girls came to\nbe so intimate, for they seemed to have very little in common. Compared\nwith Eve Madeley, Patty was an insignificant little person; but of her\nmoral uprightness Hilliard felt only the more assured the longer he\ntalked with her, and this still had a favourable effect upon his\nestimate of Eve.\n\nAgain there passed a few days without event. But about nine o'clock on\nWednesday evening, as he sat at home over a book, his landlady entered\nthe room with a surprising announcement.\n\n\"There's a young lady wishes to see you, Sir. Miss Ringrose is the\nname.\"\n\nHilliard sprang up.\n\n\"Please ask her to come in.\"\n\nThe woman eyed him in a manner he was too excited to understand.\n\n\"She would like to speak to you at the door, Sir, if you wouldn't mind\ngoing out.\"\n\nHe hastened thither. The front door stood open, and a light from the\npassage shone on Patty's face. In the girl's look he saw at once that\nsomething was wrong.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Hilliard--I didn't know your number--I've been to a lot of\nhouses asking for you----\"\n\n\"What is it?\" he inquired, going out on to the doorstep.\n\n\"I called to see Eve, and--I don't know what it meant, but she's gone\naway. The landlady says she left this morning with her luggage--went\naway for good. And it's so strange that she hasn't let me know\nanything. I can't understand it. I wanted to ask if you know----\"\n\nHilliard stared at the house opposite.\n\n\"I? I know nothing whatever about it. Come in and tell me----\"\n\n\"If you wouldn't mind coming out----\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. One moment; I'll get my hat.\"\n\nHe rejoined the girl, and they turned in the direction of Euston\nSquare, where people were few.\n\n\"I couldn't help coming to see you, Mr. Hilliard,\" said Patty, whose\nmanner indicated the gravest concern. \"It has put me in such a fright.\nI haven't seen her since Sunday. I came to-night, as soon as I could\nget away from the shop, because I didn't feel easy in my mind about\nher.\"\n\n\"Why did you feel anxious? What has been going on?\"\n\nHe search her face. Patty turned away, kept silence for a moment, al at\nlength, with one of her wonted outbursts of confidence, said nervously:\n\n\"It's something I can't explain. But as you were a friend of hers----\"\n\nA man came by, and Patty broke off.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nHilliard waited for her to continue, but Patty kept her eyes down and\nsaid no more.\n\n\"Did you think,\" he asked, \"that I was likely to be in Miss Madeley's\nconfidence?\"\n\n\"You've known her a long time, haven't you?\"\n\nThis proof of reticence, or perhaps of deliberate misleading, on Eve's\npart astonished Hilliard. He replied evasively that he had very little\nacquaintance with Miss Madeley's affairs, and added:\n\n\"May she not simply have changed her lodgings?\"\n\n\"Why should she go so suddenly, and without letting me know?\"\n\n\"What had the landlady to say?\"\n\n\"She heard her tell the cab to drive to Mudie's--the library, you know.\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Hilliard; \"that meant, perhaps, that she wanted to return a\nbook before leaving London. Is there any chance that she has gone\nhome--to Dudley? Perhaps her father is ill, and she was sent for.\"\n\nPatty admitted this possibility, but with every sign of doubt.\n\n\"The landlady said she had a letter this morning.\"\n\n\"Did she? Then it may have been from Dudley. But you know her so much\nbetter than I do. Of course, you mustn't tell me anything you don't\nfeel it right to speak of; still, did it occur to you that I could be\nof any use?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't think; I only came because I was so upset when I found\nher gone. I knew you lived in Gower Place somewhere, and I thought you\nmight have seen her since Sunday.\"\n\n\"I have not. But surely you will hear from her very soon. You may even\nget a letter tonight, or to-morrow morning.\"\n\nPatty gave a little spring of hopefulness.\n\n\"Yes; a letter might come by the last post to-night. I'll go home at\nonce.\"\n\n\"And I will come with you,\" said Hilliard. \"Then you can tell me\nwhether you have any news.\"\n\nThey turned and walked towards the foot of Hampstead Road, whence they\ncould go by tram-car to Patty's abode in High Street, Camden Town.\nSupported by the hope of finding a letter when she arrived, Miss\nRingrose grew more like herself.\n\n\"You must have wondered what _ever_ I meant by calling to see you, Mr.\nHilliard. I went to five or six houses before I hit on the right one. I\ndo wish now that I'd waited a little, but I'm always doing things in\nthat way and being sorry for them directly after. Eve is my best\nfriend, you know, and that makes me so anxious about her.\"\n\n\"How long have you known her?\"\n\n\"Oh, ever so long--about a year.\"\n\nThe temptation to make another inquiry was too strong for Hilliard.\n\n\"Where has she been employed of late?\"\n\nPatty looked up at him with surprise.\n\n\"Oh, don't you know? She isn't doing anything now. The people where she\nwas went bankrupt, and she's been out of a place for more than a month.\"\n\n\"Can't find another engagement?\"\n\n\"She hasn't tried yet. She's taking a holiday. It isn't very nice work,\nadding up money all day. I'm sure it would drive me out of my senses\nvery soon. I think she might find something better than that.\"\n\nMiss Ringrose continued to talk of her friend all the way to Camden\nTown, but the information he gathered did not serve to advance Hilliard\nin his understanding of Eve's character. That she was keeping back\nsomething of grave import the girl had already confessed, and in her\nchatter she frequently checked herself on the verge of an indiscretion.\nHilliard took for granted that the mystery had to do with the man he\nhad seen at Earl's Court. If Eve actually disappeared, he would not\nscruple to extract from Patty all that she knew; but he must see first\nwhether Eve would communicate with her friend.\n\nIn High Street Patty entered a small shop which was on the point of\nbeing closed for the night.\n\nHilliard waited for her a few yards away; on her return he saw at once\nthat she was disappointed.\n\n\"There's nothing!\"\n\n\"It may come in the morning. I should like to know whether you hear or\nnot.\"\n\n\"Would this be out of your way?\" asked Patty. \"I'm generally alone in\nthe shop from half-past one to half-past two. There's very seldom any\nbusiness going on then.\"\n\n\"Then I will come to-morrow at that time.\"\n\n\"Do, please? If I haven't heard anything I shall be that nervous.\"\n\nThey talked to no purpose for a few minutes, and bade each other\ngood-night.\n\nNext day, at the hour Patty had appointed, Hilliard was again in High\nStreet. As he approached the shop he heard from within the jingle of a\npiano. A survey through the closed glass door showed him Miss Ringrose\nplaying for her own amusement. He entered, and Patty jumped up with a\nsmile of welcome.\n\n\"It's all right! I had a letter this morning. She _has_ gone to Dudley.\"\n\n\"Ah! I am glad to hear it. Any reason given?\"\n\n\"Nothing particular,\" answered the girl, striking a note on the piano\nwith her forefinger. \"She thought she might as well go home for a week\nor two before taking another place. She has heard of something in\nHolborn.\"\n\n\"So your alarm was groundless.\"\n\n\"Oh--I didn't really feel alarmed, Mr. Hilliard. You mustn't think\nthat. I often do silly things.\"\n\nPatty's look and tone were far from reassuring. Evidently she had been\nrelieved from her suspense, but no less plainly did she seek to avoid\nan explanation of it. Hilliard began to glance about the shop.\n\n\"My uncle,\" resumed Patty, turning with her wonted sprightliness to\nanother subject, \"always goes out for an hour or two in the middle of\nthe day to play billiards. I can tell by his face when he comes back\nwhether he's lost or won; he does so take it to heart, silly man! Do\n_you_ play billiards?\"\n\nThe other shook his head.\n\n\"I thought not. You have a serious look.\"\n\nHilliard did not relish this compliment. He imagined he had cast away\nhis gloom; he desired to look like the men who take life with easy\ncourage. As he gazed through the glass door into the street, a figure\nsuddenly blocked his prospect, and a face looked in. Then the door\nopened, and there entered a young man of clerkly appearance, who\nglanced from Miss Ringrose to her companion with an air of severity.\nPatty had reddened a little.\n\n\"What are _you_ doing here at this time of day?\" she asked familiarly.\n\n\"Oh--business--had to look up a man over here. Thought I'd speak a word\nas I passed.\"\n\nHilliard drew aside.\n\n\"Who has opened this new shop opposite?\" added the young man, beckoning\nfrom the doorway.\n\nA more transparent pretext for drawing Patty away could not have been\nconceived; but she readily lent herself to it, and followed. The door\nclosed behind them. In a few minutes Patty returned alone, with rosy\ncheeks and mutinous lips.\n\n\"I'm very sorry to have been in the way,\" said Hilliard, smiling.\n\n\"Oh, not you. It's all right. Someone I know. He can be sensible enough\nwhen he likes, but sometimes he's such a silly there's no putting up\nwith him. Have you heard the new waltz--the Ballroom Queen?\"\n\nShe sat down and rattled over this exhilarating masterpiece.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Hilliard. \"You play very cleverly.\"\n\n\"Oh, so can anybody--that's nothing.\"\n\n\"Does Miss Madeley play at all?\"\n\n\"No. She's always saying she wishes she could but I tell her, what does\nit matter? She knows no end of things that I don't, and I'd a good deal\nrather have that.\"\n\n\"She reads a good deal, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Oh, I should think she does, just! And she can speak French.\"\n\n\"Indeed? How did she learn?\"\n\n\"At the place where she was bookkeeper there was a young lady from\nParis, and they shared lodgings, and Eve learnt it from her. Then her\nfriend went to Paris again, and Eve wanted very much to go with her,\nbut she didn't see how to manage it. Eve,\" she added, with a laugh, \"is\nalways wanting to do something that's impossible.\"\n\nA week later, Hilliard again called at the music-shop, and talked for\nhalf an hour with Miss Ringrose, who had no fresh news from Eve. His\nvisits were repeated at intervals of a few days, and at length, towards\nthe end of June, he learnt that Miss Madeley was about to return to\nLondon; she had obtained a new engagement, at the establishment in\nHolborn of which Patty had spoken.\n\n\"And will she come back to her old lodgings?\" he inquired.\n\nPatty shook her head.\n\n\"She'll stay with me. I wanted her to come here before, but she didn't\ncare about it. Now she's altered her mind, and I'm very glad.\"\n\nHilliard hesitated in putting the next question.\n\n\"Do you still feel anxious about her?\"\n\nThe girl met his eyes for an instant.\n\n\"No. It's all right now.\"\n\n\"There's one thing I should like you to tell me--if you can.\"\n\n\"About Miss Madeley?\"\n\n\"I don't think there can be any harm in your saying yes or no. Is she\nengaged to be married?\"\n\nPatty replied with a certain eagerness.\n\n\"No! Indeed she isn't. And she never has been.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" Hilliard gave a sigh of relief. \"I'm very glad to know\nthat.\"\n\n\"Of course you are,\" Patty answered, with a laugh.\n\nAs usual, after one of her frank remarks, she turned away and struck\nchords on the piano. Hilliard meditated the while, until his companion\nspoke again.\n\n\"You'll see her before long, I dare say?\"\n\n\"Perhaps. I don't know.\"\n\n\"At all events, you'll _want_ to see her.\"\n\n\"Most likely.\"\n\n\"Will you promise me something?\"\n\n\"If it's in my power to keep the promise.\"\n\n\"It's only--I should be so glad if you wouldn't mention anything about\nmy coming to see you that night in Gower Place.\"\n\n\"I won't speak of it.\"\n\n\"Quite sure?\"\n\n\"You may depend upon me. Would you rather she didn't know that I have\nseen you at all?\"\n\n\"Oh, there's no harm in that. I should be sure to let it out. I shall\nsay we met by chance somewhere.\"\n\n\"Very well. I feel tempted to ask a promise iii return.\"\n\nPatty stood with her hands behind her, eyes wide and lips slightly\napart.\n\n\"It is this,\" he continued, lowering his voice. \"If ever you should\nbegin to feel anxious again about her will you let me know?\"\n\nHer reply was delayed; it came at length in the form of an embarrassed\nnod. Thereupon Hilliard pressed her hand and departed.\n\nHe knew the day on which Eve would arrive in London; from morning to\nnight a feverish unrest drove him about the streets. On the morrow he\nwas scarcely more at ease, and for several days he lived totally\nwithout occupation, save in his harassing thoughts. He paced and\nrepaced the length of Holborn, wondering where it was that Eve had\nfound employment; but from Camden Town he held aloof.\n\nOne morning there arrived for him a postcard on which was scribbled:\n\"We are going to the Savoy on Saturday night. Gallery.\" No signature,\nno address; but of course the writer must be Patty Ringrose. Mentally,\nhe thanked her with much fervour. And on the stated evening, nearly an\nhour before the opening of the doors, he climbed the stone steps\nleading to the gallery entrance of the Savoy Theatre. At the summit two\nor three persons were already waiting--strangers to him. He leaned\nagainst the wall, and read an evening paper. At every sound of\napproaching feet his eyes watched with covert eagerness. Presently he\nheard a laugh, echoing from below, and recognised Patty's voice; then\nMiss Ringrose appeared round the winding in the staircase, and was\nfollowed by Eve Madeley. Patty glanced up, and smiled consciously as\nshe discovered the face she had expected to see; but Eve remained for\nsome minutes unaware of her acquaintance's proximity. Scrutinising her\nappearance, as he could at his ease, Hilliard thought she looked far\nfrom well: she had a tired, dispirited expression, and paid no heed to\nthe people about her. Her dress was much plainer than that she wore a\nmonth ago.\n\nHe saw Patty whispering to her companion, and, as a result, Eve's eyes\nturned in his direction. He met her look, and had no difficulty in\nmaking his way down two or three steps, to join her. The reception she\ngave him was one of civil indifference. Hilliard made no remark on what\nseemed the chance of their encounter, nor did he speak of her absence\nfrom London; they talked, as far as talk was possible under the\ncircumstances, of theatrical and kindred subjects. He could not\nperceive that the girl was either glad or sorry to have met him again;\nbut by degrees her mood brightened a little, and she exclaimed with\npleasure when the opening of the door caused an upward movement.\n\n\"You have been away,\" he said, when they were in their places, he at\none side of Eve, Patty on the other.\n\n\"Yes. At Dudley.\"\n\n\"Did you see Mrs. Brewer?\"\n\n\"Several times. She hasn't got another lodger yet, and wishes you would\ngo back again. A most excellent character she gave you.\"\n\nThis sounded satirical.\n\n\"I deserved the best she could say of me,\" Hilliard answered.\n\nEve glanced at him, smiled doubtfully, and turned to talk with Patty\nRingrose. Through the evening there was no further mention of Dudley.\nEve could with difficulty be induced to converse at all, and when the\nentertainment was over she pointedly took leave of him within the\ntheatre. But while shaking hands with Patty, he saw something in that\nyoung lady's face which caused him to nod and smile.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nThere came an afternoon early in July when Hilliard, tired with a long\nramble in search of old City churches--his architectural interests\nnever failed--sought rest and coolness in a Fleet Street tavern of\ntime-honoured name. It was long since he had yielded to any\nextravagance; to-day his palate demanded wine, and with wine he solaced\nit. When he went forth again into the roaring highway things glowed\nbefore him in a mellow light: the sounds of Fleet Street made music to\nhis ears; he looked with joyous benignity into the faces of men and\nwomen, and nowhere discovered a countenance inharmonious with his\ngallant mood.\n\nNo longer weary, he strolled westward, content with the satisfactions\nof each passing moment. \"This,\" he said to himself, \"is the joy of\nlife. Past and future are alike powerless over me; I live in the\nglorious sunlight of this summer day, under the benediction of a\ngreathearted wine. Noble wine! Friend of the friendless, companion of\nthe solitary, lifter-up of hearts that are oppressed, inspirer of brave\nthoughts in them that fail beneath the burden of being. Thanks to thee,\nO priceless wine!\"\n\nA bookseller's window arrested him. There, open to the gaze of every\npedestrian, stood a volume of which the sight made him thrill with\nrapture; a finely illustrated folio, a treatise on the Cathedrals of\nFrance. Five guineas was the price it bore. A moment's lingering,\nrestrained by some ignoble spirit of thrift which the wine had not\nutterly overcome, and he entered the shop. He purchased the volume. It\nwould have pleased him to carry it away, but in mere good-nature he\nallowed the shopman's suggestion to prevail, and gave his address that\nthe great tome might be sent to him.\n\nHow cheap it was--five guineas for so much instant delight and such\nboundless joy of anticipation!\n\nOn one of the benches in Trafalgar Square he sat for a long time\nwatching the fountains, and ever and anon letting them lead his eyes\nupwards to the great snowy clouds that gleamed upon the profound blue.\nSome ragged children were at play near him; he searched his pocket,\ncollected coppers and small silver, and with a friendly cry of \"Holloa,\nyou ragamuffins!\" scattered amazement and delight.\n\nSt. Martin's Church told him that the hour was turned of six. Then a\npurpose that had hung vaguely in his mind like a golden mist took form\nand substance. He set off to walk northward, came out into Holborn, and\nloitered in the neighbourhood of a certain place of business, which of\nlate he had many times observed. It was not long that he had to wait.\nPresently there came forth someone whom he knew, and with quick steps\nhe gained her side.\n\nEve Madeley perceived him without surprise.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I am here again. If it's disagreeable to you, tell me,\nand I will go my own way at once.\"\n\n\"I have no wish to send you away,\" she answered, with a smile of\nself-possession. \"But all the same, I think it would be wiser if you\ndid go.\"\n\n\"Ah, then, if you leave me to judge for myself----! You look tired this\nevening. I have something to say to you; let us turn for a moment up\nthis byway.\"\n\n\"No, let us walk straight on.\"\n\n\"I beg of you!--Now you are kind. I am going to dine at a restaurant.\nUsually, I eat my dinner at home--a bad dinner and a cheerless room. On\nsuch an evening as this I can't go back and appease hunger in that\nanimal way. But when I sit down in the restaurant I shall be alone.\nIt's miserable to see the groups of people enjoying themselves all\nround and to sit lonely. I can't tell you how long it is since I had a\nmeal in company. Will you come and dine with me?\"\n\n\"I can't do that.\"\n\n\"Where's the impossibility?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't like to do it.\"\n\n\"But would it be so very disagreeable to sit and talk? Or, I won't ask\nyou to talk; only to let me talk to you. Give me an hour or two of your\ntime--that's what I ask. It means so much to me, and to you, what does\nit matter?\"\n\nEve walked on in silence; his entreaties kept pace with her. At length\nshe stopped.\n\n\"It's all the same to me--if you wish it----\"\n\n\"Thank you a thousand times!\"\n\nThey walked back into Holborn, and Hilliard, talking merely of trifles,\nled the way to a great hall, where some scores of people were already\ndining. He selected a nook which gave assurance of privacy, sketched to\nthe waiter a modest but carefully chosen repast, and from his seat on\nthe opposite side of the table laughed silently at Eve as she leaned\nback on the plush cushions. In no way disconcerted by the show of\nluxury about her, Eve seemed to be reflecting, not without enjoyment.\n\n\"You would rather be here than going home in the Camden Town 'bus?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"That's what I like in you. You have courage to tell the truth. When\nyou said that you couldn't come, it was what you really thought Now\nthat you have learnt your mistake, you confess it.\"\n\n\"I couldn't have done it if I hadn't made up my mind that it was all\nthe same, whether I came or refused.\"\n\n\"All the same to you. Yes; I'm quite willing that you should think it\nso. It puts me at my ease. I have nothing to reproach myself with. Ah,\nbut how good it is to sit here and talk!\"\n\n\"Don't you know anyone else who would come with you? Haven't you made\nany friends?\"\n\n\"Not one. You and Miss Ringrose are the only persons I know in London.\"\n\n\"I can't understand why you live in that way.\"\n\n\"How should I make friends--among men? Why, it's harder than making\nmoney--which I have never done yet, and never shall, I'm afraid.\"\n\nEve averted her eyes, and again seemed to meditate.\n\n\"I'll tell you,\" pursued the young man \"how the money came to me that I\nam living on now. It'll fill up the few moments while we are waiting.\"\n\nHe made of it an entertaining narrative, which he concluded just as the\nsoup was laid before them. Eve listened with frank curiosity, with an\namused smile. Then came a lull in the conversation. Hilliard began his\ndinner with appetite and gusto; the girl, after a few sips, neglected\nher soup and glanced about the neighboring tables.\n\n\"In my position,\" said Hilliard at length, \"what would you have done?\"\n\n\"It's a difficult thing to put myself in your position.\"\n\n\"Is it, really? Why, then, I will tell you something more of myself.\nYou say that Mrs. Brewer gave me an excellent character?\"\n\n\"I certainly shouldn't have known you from her description.\"\n\nHilliard laughed.\n\n\"I seem to you so disreputable?\"\n\n\"Not exactly that,\" replied Eve thoughtfully. \"But you seem altogether\na different person from what you seemed to her.\"\n\n\"Yes, I can understand that. And it gives me an opportunity for saying\nthat you, Miss Madeley, are as different as possible from the idea I\nformed of you when I heard Mrs. Brewer's description.\"\n\n\"She described me? I should so like to hear what she said.\"\n\nThe changing of plates imposed a brief silence. Hilliard drank a glass\nof wine and saw that Eve just touched hers with her lips.\n\n\"You shall hear that--but not now. I want to enable you to judge me,\nand if I let you know the facts while dinner goes on it won't be so\ntiresome as if I began solemnly to tell you my life, as people do in\nnovels.\"\n\nHe erred, if anything, on the side of brevity, but in the succeeding\nquarter of an hour Eve was able to gather from his careless talk, which\nsedulously avoided the pathetic note, a fair notion of what his\nexistence had been from boyhood upward. It supplemented the account of\nhimself she had received from him when they met for the first time. As\nhe proceeded she grew more attentive, and occasionally allowed her eyes\nto encounter his.\n\n\"There's only one other person who has heard all this from me,\" he said\nat length. \"That's a friend of mine at Birmingham--a man called\nNarramore. When I got Dengate's money I went to Narramore, and I told\nhim what use I was going to make of it.\"\n\n\"That's what you haven't told me,\" remarked the listener.\n\n\"I will, now that you can understand me. I resolved to go right away\nfrom all the sights and sounds that I hated, and to live a man's life,\nfor just as long as the money would last.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by a man's life?\"\n\n\"Why, a life of enjoyment, instead of a life not worthy to be called\nlife at all. This is part of it, this evening. I have had enjoyable\nhours since I left Dudley, but never yet one like this. And because I\nowe it to you, I shall remember you with gratitude as long as I\nremember anything at all.\"\n\n\"That's a mistake,\" said Eve. \"You owe the enjoyment, whatever it is,\nto your money, not to me.\"\n\n\"You prefer to look at it in that way. Be it so. I had a delightful\nmonth in Paris, but I was driven back to England by loneliness. Now, if\n_you_ had been there! If I could have seen you each evening for an hour\nor two, had dinner with you at the restaurant, talked with you about\nwhat I had seen in the day--but that would have been perfection, and I\nhave never hoped for more than moderate, average pleasure--such as\nordinary well-to-do men take as their right.\"\n\n\"What did you do in Paris?\"\n\n\"Saw things I have longed to see any time the last fifteen years or so.\nLearned to talk a little French. Got to feel a better educated man than\nI was before.\"\n\n\"Didn't Dudley seem a long way off when you were there?\" asked Eve half\nabsently.\n\n\"In another planet.--You thought once of going to Paris; Miss Ringrose\ntold me.\"\n\nEve knitted her brows, and made no answer.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nWhen fruit had been set before them--and as he was peeling a banana:\n\n\"What a vast difference,\" said Hilliard, \"between the life of people\nwho dine, and of those who don't! It isn't the mere pleasure of eating,\nthe quality of the food--though that must have a great influence on\nmind and character. But to sit for an hour or two each evening in\nquiet, orderly enjoyment, with graceful things about one, talking of\nwhatever is pleasant--how it civilises! Until three months ago I never\ndined in my life, and I know well what a change it has made in me.\"\n\n\"I never dined till this evening,\" said Eve.\n\n\"Never? This is the first time you have been at a restaurant?\"\n\n\"For dinner--yes.\"\n\nHilliard heard the avowal with surprise and delight. After all, there\ncould not have been much intimacy between her and the man she met at\nthe Exhibition.\n\n\"When I go back to slavery,\" he continued, \"I shall bear it more\nphilosophically. It was making me a brute, but I think there'll be no\nmore danger of that. The memory of civilisation will abide with me. I\nshall remind myself that I was once a free man, and that will support\nme.\"\n\nEve regarded him with curiosity.\n\n\"Is there no choice?\" she asked. \"While you have money, couldn't you\nfind some better way of earning a living?\"\n\n\"I have given it a thought now and then, but it's very doubtful.\nThere's only one thing at which I might have done well, and that's\narchitecture. From studying it just for my own pleasure, I believe I\nknow more about architecture than most men who are not in the\nprofession; but it would take a long time before I could earn money by\nit. I could prepare myself to be an architectural draughtsman, no\ndoubt, and might do as well that way as drawing machinery. But----\"\n\n\"Then why don't you go to work! It would save you from living in\nhideous places.\"\n\n\"After all, does it matter much? If I had anything else to gain.\nSuppose I had any hope of marriage, for instance----\"\n\nHe said it playfully. Eve turned her eyes away, but gave no other sign\nof self-consciousness.\n\n\"I have no such hope. I have seen too much of marriage in poverty.\"\n\n\"So have I,\" said his companion, with quiet emphasis.\n\n\"And when a man's absolutely sure that he will never have an income of\nmore than a hundred and fifty pounds----\"\n\n\"It's a crime if he asks a woman to share it,\" Eve added coldly.\n\n\"I agree with you. It's well to understand each other on that\npoint.--Talking of architecture, I bought a grand book this afternoon.\"\n\nHe described the purchase, and mentioned what it cost.\n\n\"But at that rate,\" said Eve, \"your days of slavery will come again\nvery soon.\"\n\n\"Oh! it's so rarely that I spend a large sum. On most days I satisfy\nmyself with the feeling of freedom, and live as poorly as ever I did.\nStill, don't suppose that I am bent on making my money last a very long\ntime. I can imagine myself spending it all in a week or two, and\nfeeling I had its worth. The only question is, how can I get most\nenjoyment? The very best of a lifetime may come within a single day.\nIndeed, I believe it very often does.\"\n\n\"I doubt that--at least, I know that it couldn't be so with me.\"\n\n\"Well, what do you aim at?\" Hilliard asked disinterestedly.\n\n\"Safety,\" was the prompt reply.\n\n\"Safety? From what?\"\n\n\"From years of struggle to keep myself alive, and a miserable old age.\"\n\n\"Then you might have said--a safety-match.\"\n\nThe jest, and its unexpectedness, struck sudden laughter from Eve.\nHilliard joined in her mirth.\n\nAfter that she suggested, \"Hadn't we better go?\"\n\n\"Yes. Let us walk quietly on. The streets are pleasant after sunset.\"\n\nOn rising, after he had paid the bill, Hilliard chanced to see himself\nin a mirror. He had flushed cheeks, and his hair was somewhat\ndisorderly. In contrast with Eve's colourless composure, his appearance\nwas decidedly bacchanalian; but the thought merely amused him.\n\nThey crossed Holborn, and took their way up Southampton Row, neither\nspeaking until they were within sight of Russell Square.\n\n\"I like this part of London,\" said Hilliard at length, pointing before\nhim. \"I often walk about the squares late at night. It's quiet, and the\ntrees make the air taste fresh.\"\n\n\"I did the same, sometimes, when I lived in Gower Place.\"\n\n\"Doesn't it strike you that we are rather like each other in some\nthings?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" Eve replied frankly. \"I have noticed that.\"\n\n\"You have? Even in the lives we have led there's a sort of resemblance,\nisn't there?\"\n\n\"Yes, I see now that there is.\"\n\nIn Russell Square they turned from the pavement, and walked along the\nedge of the enclosure.\n\n\"I wish Patty had been with us,\" said Eve all at once. \"She would have\nenjoyed it so thoroughly.\"\n\n\"To be sure she would. Well, we can dine again, and have Patty with us.\nBut, after all, dining in London can't be quite what it is in Paris. I\nwish you hadn't gone back to work again. Do you know what I should have\nproposed?\"\n\nShe glanced inquiringly at him.\n\n\"Why shouldn't we all have gone to Paris for a holiday? You and Patty\ncould have lived together, and I should have seen you every day.\"\n\nEve laughed.\n\n\"Why not? Patty and I have both so much more money than we know what to\ndo with,\" she answered.\n\n\"Money? Oh, what of that! I have money.\"\n\nShe laughed again.\n\nHilliard was startled.\n\n\"You are talking rather wildly. Leaving myself out of the question,\nwhat would Mr. Dally say to such a proposal?\"\n\n\"Who's Mr. Dally?\"\n\n\"Don't you know? Hasn't Patty told you that she is engaged?\"\n\n\"Ah! No; she hasn't spoken of it. But I think I must have seen him at\nthe music-shop one day. Is she likely to marry him?\"\n\n\"It isn't the wisest thing she could do, but that may be the end of it.\nHe's in an auctioneer's office, and may have a pretty good income some\nday.\"\n\nA long silence followed. They passed out of Russell into Woburn Square.\nNight was now darkening the latest tints of the sky, and the lamps\nshone golden against dusty green. At one of the houses in the narrow\nsquare festivities were toward; carriages drew up before the entrance,\nfrom which a red carpet was laid down across the pavement; within\nsounded music.\n\n\"Does this kind of thing excite any ambition in you?\" Hilliard asked,\ncoming to a pause a few yards away from the carriage which was\ndischarging its occupants.\n\n\"Yes, I suppose it does. At all events, it makes me feel discontented.\"\n\n\"I have settled all that with myself. I am content to look on as if it\nwere a play. Those people have an idea of life quite different from\nmine. I shouldn't enjoy myself among them. You, perhaps, would.\"\n\n\"I might,\" Eve replied absently. And she turned away to the other side\nof the square.\n\n\"By-the-bye, you _have_ a friend in Paris. Do you ever hear from her?\"\n\n\"She wrote once or twice after she went back; but it has come to an\nend.\"\n\n\"Still, you might find her again, if you were there.\"\n\nEve delayed her reply a little, then spoke impatiently.\n\n\"What is the use of setting my thoughts upon such things? Day after day\nI try to forget what I most wish for. Talk about yourself, and I will\nlisten with pleasure; but never talk about me.\"\n\n\"It's very hard to lay that rule upon me. I want to hear you speak of\nyourself. As yet, I hardly know you, and I never shall unless you----\"\n\n\"Why should you know me?\" she interrupted, in a voice of irritation.\n\n\"Only because I wish it more than anything else, I have wished it from\nthe day when I first saw your portrait.\"\n\n\"Oh! that wretched portrait! I should be sorry if I thought it was at\nall like me.\"\n\n\"It is both like and unlike,\" said Hilliard. \"What I see of it in your\nface is the part of you that most pleases me.\"\n\n\"And that isn't my real self at all.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not. And yet, perhaps, you are mistaken. That is what I want\nto learn. From the portrait, I formed an idea of you. When I met you,\nit seemed to me that I was hopelessly astray; yet now I don't feel sure\nof it.\"\n\n\"You would like to know what has changed me from the kind of girl I was\nat Dudley?\"\n\n\"_Are_ you changed?\"\n\n\"In some ways, no doubt. You, at all events, seem to think so.\"\n\n\"I can wait. You will tell me all about it some day.\"\n\n\"You mustn't take that for granted. We have made friends in a sort of\nway just because we happened to come from the same place, and know the\nsame people. But----\"\n\nHe waited.\n\n\"Well, I was going to say that there's no use in our thinking much\nabout each other.\"\n\n\"I don't ask you to think of me. But I shall think a great deal about\nyou for long enough to come.\"\n\n\"That's what I want to prevent.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because, in the end, it might be troublesome to me.\"\n\nHilliard kept silence awhile, then laughed. When he spoke again, it was\nof things indifferent natures.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nLaziest of men and worst of correspondents, Robert Narramore had as yet\nsent no reply to the letters in which Hilliard acquainted him with his\nadventures in London and abroad; but at the end of July he vouchsafed a\nperfunctory scrawl. \"Too bad not to write before, but I've been floored\nevery evening after business in this furious heat. You may like to hear\nthat my uncle's property didn't make a bad show. I have come in for a\nround five thousand, and am putting it into brass bedsteads. Sha'n't be\nable to get away until the end of August. May see you then.\" Hilliard\nmused enviously on the brass bedstead business.\n\nOn looking in at the Camden Town music-shop about this time he found\nPatty Ringrose flurried and vexed by an event which disturbed her\nprospects. Her uncle the shopkeeper, a widower of about fifty, had\nannounced his intention of marrying again, and, worse still, of giving\nup his business.\n\n\"It's the landlady of the public-house where he goes to play\nbilliards,\" said Patty with scornful mirth; \"a great fat woman! Oh! And\nhe's going to turn publican. And my aunt and me will have to look out\nfor ourselves.\"\n\nThis aunt was the shopkeeper's maiden sister who had hitherto kept\nhouse for him. \"She had been promised an allowance,\" said Patty, \"but a\nvery mean one.\"\n\n\"I don't care much for myself,\" the girl went on; \"there's plenty of\nshops where I can get an engagement, but of course it won't be the same\nas here, which has been home for me ever since I was a child. There!\nthe things that men will do! I've told him plain to his face that he\nought to be ashamed of himself, and so has aunt. And he _is_ ashamed,\nwhat's more. Don't you call it disgusting, such a marriage as that?\"\n\nHilliard avoided the delicate question.\n\n\"I shouldn't wonder if it hastens another marriage,\" he said with a\nsmile.\n\n\"I know what you mean, but the chances are that marriage won't come off\nat all. I'm getting tired of men; they're so selfish and unreasonable.\nOf course I don't mean you, Mr. Hilliard, but--oh! you know what I\nmean.\"\n\n\"Mr. Dally has fallen under your displeasure?\"\n\n\"Please don't talk about him. If he thinks he's going to lay down the\nlaw to me he'll find his mistake; and it's better he should find it out\nbefore it's too late.\"\n\nThey were interrupted by the entrance of Patty's amorous uncle, who\nreturned from his billiards earlier than usual to-day. He scowled at\nthe stranger, but passed into the house without speaking. Hilliard\nspoke a hurried word or two about Eve and went his way.\n\nSomething less than a week after this he chanced to be away from home\nthroughout the whole day, and on returning he was surprised to see a\ntelegram upon his table. It came from Patty Ringrose, and asked him to\ncall at the shop without fail between one and two that day. The hour\nwas now nearly ten; the despatch had arrived at eleven in the morning.\n\nWithout a minute's delay he ran out in search of a cab, and was driven\nto High Street. Here, of course, he found the shop closed, but it was\nmuch too early for the household to have retired to rest; risking an\nindiscretion, he was about to ring the house bell when the door opened,\nand Patty showed herself.\n\n\"Oh, is it _you_, Mr. Hilliard!\" she exclaimed, in a flurried voice. \"I\nheard the cab stop, and I thought it might be----You'd better come\nin--quick!\"\n\nHe followed her along the passage and into the shop, where one gas-jet\nwas burning low.\n\n\"Listen!\" she resumed, whispering hurriedly. \"If Eve comes--she'll let\nherself in with the latchkey--you must stand quiet here. I shall turn\nout the gas, and I'll let you out after she's gone upstairs? Couldn't\nyou come before?\"\n\nHilliard explained, and begged her to tell him what was the matter. But\nPatty kept him in suspense.\n\n\"Uncle won't be in till after twelve, so there's no fear. Aunt has gone\nto bed--she's upset with quarrelling about this marriage. Mind! You\nwon't stir if Eve comes in. Don't talk loud; I must keep listening for\nthe door.\"\n\n\"But what is it? Where is Eve?\"\n\n\"I don't know. She didn't come home till very late last night, and I\ndon't know where she was. You remember what you asked me to promise?\"\n\n\"To let me know if you were anxious about her.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I am. She's in danger I only hope----\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I don't like to tell you all I know. It doesn't seem right. But I'm so\nafraid for Eve.\"\n\n\"I can only imagine one kind of danger----\"\n\n\"Yes--of course, it's that--you know what I mean. But there's more than\nyou could fancy.\"\n\n\"Tell me, then, what has alarmed you?\"\n\n\"When did you see her last?\" Patty inquired.\n\n\"More than a week ago. Two or three days before I came here.\"\n\n\"Had you noticed anything?\"\n\n\"Nothing unusual.\"\n\n\"No more did I, till last Monday night. Then I saw that something was\nwrong. Hush!\"\n\nShe gripped his arm, and they listened. But no sound could be heard.\n\n\"And since then,\" Patty pursued, with tremulous eagerness, \"she's been\nvery queer. I know she doesn't sleep at night, and she's getting ill,\nand she's had letters from--someone she oughtn't to have anything to do\nwith.\"\n\n\"Having told so much, you had better tell me all,\" said Hilliard\nimpatiently. There was a cold sweat on his forehead, and his heart beat\npainfully.\n\n\"No. I can't. I can only give you a warning.\"\n\n\"But what's the use of that? What can I do? How can I interfere?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied the girl, with a helpless sigh. \"She's in\ndanger, that's all I call tell you.\"\n\n\"Patty, don't be a fool! Out with it! Who is the man? Is it some one\nyou know?\"\n\n\"I don't exactly know him I've seen him.\"\n\n\"Is he--a sort of gentleman?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, he's a gentleman. And you'd never think to look at him that\nhe could do anything that wasn't right.\"\n\n\"Very well. What reason have you for supposing that he's doing wrong?\"\n\nPatty kept silence. A band of rowdy fellows just then came shouting\nalong the street, and one of them crashed up against the shop door,\nmaking Patty jump and scream. Oaths and foul language followed; and\nthen the uproar passed away.\n\n\"Look here,\" said Hilliard. \"You'll drive me out of my senses. Eve is\nin love with this man, is she?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid so. She was.\"\n\n\"Before she went away, you mean. And, of course, her going away had\nsomething to do with it?\"\n\n\"Yes, it had.\"\n\nHilliard laid his hands on the girl's shoulders.\n\n\"You've got to tell me the plain truth, and be quick about it. I\nsuppose you haven't any idea of the torments I'm suffering. I shall\nbegin to think you're making a fool of me, and that there's nothing\nbut--though that's bad enough for me.\"\n\n\"Very well, I'll tell you. She went away because it came out that the\nman was married.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's it?\" He spoke from a dry throat. \"She told you herself?\"\n\n\"Yes, not long after she came back. She said, of course, she could have\nno more to do with him. She used to meet him pretty often----\"\n\n\"Stay, how did she get to know him first?\"\n\n\"Just by chance--somewhere.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Hilliard grimly. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"And his wife got someone to spy on him, and they found out he was\nmeeting Eve, and she jumped out on them when they were walking\nsomewhere together, and told Eve everything. He wasn't living with his\nwife, and hasn't been for a long time.\"\n\n\"What's his position?\"\n\n\"He's in business, and seems to have lots of money; but I don't exactly\nknow what it is he does.\"\n\n\"You are afraid, then, that Eve is being drawn back to him?\"\n\n\"I feel sure she is--and it's dreadful.\"\n\n\"What I should like to know,\" said Hilliard, harshly, \"is whether she\nreally cares for him, or only for his money.\"\n\n\"Oh! How horrid you are! I never thought you could say such a thing!\"\n\n\"Perhaps you didn't. All the same, it's a question. I don't pretend to\nunderstand Eve Madeley, and I'm afraid you are just as far from knowing\nher.\"\n\n\"I don't know her? Why, what are you talking about, Mr. Hilliard?\"\n\n\"What do you think of her, then? Is she a good-hearted girl or----\"\n\n\"Or what? Of course she's good-hearted. The things that men do say!\nThey seem to be all alike.\"\n\n\"Women are so far from being all alike that one may think she\nunderstands another, and be utterly deceived. Eve has shown her best\nside to you, no doubt. With me, she hasn't taken any trouble to do so.\nAnd if----\"\n\n\"Hush!\"\n\nThis time the alarm was justified. A latchkey rattled at the\nhouse-door, the door opened, and in the same moment Patty turned out\nthe light.\n\n\"It's my uncle,\" she whispered, terror-stricken. \"Don't stir.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nA heavy footstep sounded in the passage, and Hilliard, to whose\nemotions was now added a sense of ludicrous indignity, heard talk\nbetween Patty and her uncle.\n\n\"You mustn't lock up yet,\" said the girl, \"Eve is out.\"\n\n\"What's she doing?\"\n\n\"I don't know. At the theatre with friends, I dare say.\"\n\n\"If we'd been staying on here, that young woman would have had to look\nout for another lodging. There's something I don't like about her, and\nif you take my advice, Patty, you'll shake her off. She'll do you no\ngood, my girl.\"\n\nThey passed together into the room behind the shop, and though their\nvoices were still audible, Hilliard could no longer follow the\nconversation. He stood motionless, just where Patty had left him, with\na hand resting on the top of the piano, and it seemed to him that at\nleast half an hour went by. Then a sound close by made him start; it\nwas the snapping of a violin string; the note reverberated through the\nsilent shop. But by this time the murmur of conversation had ceased,\nand Hilliard hoped that Patty's uncle had gone upstairs to bed.\n\nAs proved to be the case. Presently the door opened, and a voice called\nto him in a whisper. He obeyed the summons, and, not without stumbling,\nfollowed Patty into the open air.\n\n\"She hasn't come yet.\"\n\n\"What's the time?\"\n\n\"Half-past eleven. I shall sit up for her. Did you hear what my uncle\nsaid? You mustn't think anything of that; he's always finding fault\nwith people.\"\n\n\"Do you think she will come at all?\" asked Hilliard.\n\n\"Oh, of course she will!\"\n\n\"I shall wait about. Don't stand here. Good-night.\"\n\n\"You won't let her know what I've told you?\" said Patty, retaining his\nhand.\n\n\"No, I won't. If she doesn't come back at all, I'll see you to-morrow.\"\n\nHe moved away, and the door closed.\n\nMany people were still passing along the street. In his uncertainty as\nto the direction by which Eve would return--if return she did--Hilliard\nventured only a few yards away. He had waited for about a quarter of an\nhour, when his eye distinguished a well-known figure quickly\napproaching. He hurried forward, and Eve stopped before he had quite\ncome up to her.\n\n\"Where have you been to-night?\" were his first words, sounding more\nroughly than he in tended.\n\n\"I wanted to see you, I passed your lodgings and saw there was no light\nin the windows, else I should have asked for you.\"\n\nShe spoke in so strange a voice, with such show of agitation, that\nHilliard stood gazing at her till she again broke silence,\n\n\"Have you been waiting here for me?\"\n\n\"Yes. Patty told me you weren't back.\"\n\n\"Why did you come?\"\n\n\"Why do I ever come to meet you?\"\n\n\"We can't talk here,\" said Eve, turning away. \"Come into a quieter\nplace.\"\n\nThey walked in silence to the foot of High Street, and there turned\naside into the shadowed solitude of Mornington Crescent. Eve checked\nher steps and said abruptly--\n\n\"I want to ask you for something.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Now that it comes to saying it, I--I'm afraid. And yet if I had asked\nyou that evening when we were at the restaurant----\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Hilliard repeated gruffly.\n\n\"That isn't your usual way of speaking to me.\"\n\n\"Will you tell me where you have been tonight?\"\n\n\"Nowhere--walking about----\"\n\n\"Do you often walk about the streets till midnight?\"\n\n\"Indeed I don't.\"\n\nThe reply surprised him by its humility. Her voice all but broke on the\nwords. As well as the dim light would allow, he searched her face, and\nit seemed to him that her eyes had a redness, as if from shedding tears.\n\n\"You haven't been alone?\"\n\n\"No--I've been with a friend.\"\n\n\"Well, I have no claim upon you. It's nothing to me what friends you go\nabout with. What were you going to ask of me?\"\n\n\"You have changed so all at once. I thought you would never talk in\nthis way.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to,\" said Hilliard. \"I have lost control of myself,\nthat's all. But you can say whatever you meant to say--just as you\nwould have done at the restaurant. I'm the same man I was then.\"\n\nEve moved a few steps, but he did not follow her, and she returned. A\npoliceman passing threw a glance at them.\n\n\"It's no use asking what I meant to ask,\" she said, with her eyes on\nthe ground. \"You won't grant it me.\"\n\n\"How can I say till I know what it is? There are not many things in my\npower that I wouldn't do for you.\"\n\n\"I was going to ask for money.\"\n\n\"Money? Why, it depends what you are going to do with it. If it will do\nyou any good, all the money I have is yours, as you know well enough.\nBut I must understand why you want it.\"\n\n\"I can't tell you that. I don't want you to give me money--only to lend\nit. You shall have it back again, though I can't promise the exact\ntime. If you hadn't changed so, I should have found it easy enough to\nask. Hut I don't know you to-night; it's like talking to a stranger.\nWhat has happened to make you so different?\"\n\n\"I have been waiting a long time for you, that's all,\" Hilliard\nreplied, endeavouring to use the tone of frank friendliness in which he\nhad been wont to address her. \"I got nervous and irritable. I felt\nuneasy about you. It's all right now: Let us walk on a little. You want\nmoney. Well, I have three hundred pounds and more. Call it mine, call\nit yours. But I must know that you're not going to do anything foolish.\nOf course, you don't tell me everything; I have no right to expect it.\nYou haven't misled me; I knew from the first that--well, a girl of your\nage, and with your face, doesn't live alone in London without\nadventures. I shouldn't think of telling you all mine, and I don't ask\nto know yours--unless I begin to have a part in them. There's something\nwrong: of course, I can see that. I think you've been crying, and you\ndon't shed tears for a trifle. Now you come and ask me for money. If it\nwill do you good, take all you want. But I've an uncomfortable\nsuspicion that harm may come of it.\"\n\n\"Why not treat me just like a man-friend? I'm old enough to take care\nof myself.\"\n\n\"You think so, but I know better. Wait a moment. How much money do you\nwant?\"\n\n\"Thirty-five pounds.\"\n\n\"Exactly thirty-five? And it isn't for your own use?\"\n\n\"I can't tell you any more. I am in very great need of the money, and\nif you will lend it me I shall feel very grateful.\"\n\n\"I want no gratitude, I want nothing from you, Eve, except what you\ncan't give me. I can imagine a man in my position giving you money in\nthe hope that it might be your ruin just to see you brought down,\nhumiliated. There's so much of the brute in us all. But I don't feel\nthat desire.\"\n\n\"Why should you?\" she asked, with a change to coldness. \"What harm have\nI done you?\"\n\n\"No harm at all, and perhaps a great deal of good. I say that I wish\nyou nothing but well. Suppose a gift of all the money I have would\nsmooth your whole life before you, and make you the happy wife of some\nother man. I would give it you gladly. That kind of thing has often\nbeen said, when it meant nothing: it isn't so with me. It has always\nbeen more pleasure to me to give than to receive. No merit of mine; I\nhave it from my father. Make clear to me that you are to benefit by\nthis money, and you shall have the cheque as soon as you please.\"\n\n\"I shall benefit by it, because it will relieve me from a dreadful\nanxiety.\"\n\n\"Or, in other words, will relieve someone else?\"\n\n\"I can speak only of myself. The kindness will be done to me.\"\n\n\"I must know more than that. Come now, we assume that there's someone\nin the background. A friend of yours, let us say. I can't Imagine why\nthis friend of yours wants money, but so it is. You don't contradict\nme?\"\n\nEve remained mute, her head bent.\n\n\"What about your friend and you in the future? Are you bound to this\nfriend in any irredeemable way?\"\n\n\"No--I am not,\" she answered, with emotion.\n\n\"There's nothing between you but--let us call it mere friendship.\"\n\n\"Nothing--nothing!\"\n\n\"So far, so good.\" He looked keenly into her face. \"But how about the\nfuture?\"\n\n\"There will never be anything more--there can't be.\"\n\n\"Let us say that you think so at present. Perhaps I don't feel quite so\nsure of it. I say again, it's nothing to me, unless I get drawn into it\nby you yourself. I am not your guardian. If I tell you to be careful,\nit's an impertinence. But the money; that's another affair. I won't\nhelp you to misery.\"\n\n\"You will be helping me _out_ of misery!\" Eve exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes, for the present. I will make a bargain with you.\"\n\nShe looked at him with startled eyes.\n\n\"You shall have your thirty-five pounds on condition that you go to\nlive, for as long as I choose, in Paris. You are to leave London in a\nday or two. Patty shall go with you; her uncle doesn't want her, and\nshe seems to have quarrelled with the man she was engaged to. The\nexpenses are my affair. I shall go to Paris myself, and be there while\nyou are, but you need see no more of me than you like. Those are the\nterms.\"\n\n\"I can't think you are serious,\" said Eve.\n\n\"Then I'll explain why I wish you to do this. I've thought about you a\ngreat deal; in fact, since we first met, my chief occupation has been\nthinking about you. And I have come to the conclusion that you are\nsuffering from an illness, the result of years of hardship and misery.\nWe have agreed, you remember, that there are a good many points of\nresemblance between your life and mine, and perhaps between your\ncharacter and mine. Now I myself, when I escaped from Dudley, was\nthoroughly ill--body and soul. The only hope for me was a complete\nchange of circumstances--to throw off the weight of my past life, and\nlearn the meaning of repose, satisfaction, enjoyment. I prescribe the\nsame for you. I am your physician; I undertake your cure. If you refuse\nto let me, there's an end of everything between us; I shall say\ngood-bye to you tonight, and to-morrow set off for some foreign\ncountry.\"\n\n\"How can I leave my work at a moment's notice?\"\n\n\"The devil take your work--for he alone is the originator of such\naccursed toil!\"\n\n\"How can I live at your expense?\"\n\n\"That's a paltry obstacle. Oh, if you are too proud, say so, and\nthere's an end of it. You know me well enough to feel the absolute\ntruth of what I say, when I assure you that you will remain just as\nindependent of me as you ever were. I shall be spending my money in a\nway that gives me pleasure; the matter will never appear to me in any\nother light. Why, call it an additional loan, if it will give any\nsatisfaction to you. You are to pay me back some time. Here in London\nyou perish; across the Channel there, health of body and mind is\nawaiting you; and are we to talk about money? I shall begin to swear\nlike a trooper; the thing is too preposterous.\"\n\nEve said nothing: she stood half turned from him.\n\n\"Of course,\" he pursued, \"you may object to leave London. Perhaps the\nsacrifice is too great. In that case, I should only do right if I\ncarried you off by main force; but I'm afraid it can't be; I must leave\nyou to perish.\"\n\n\"I am quite willing to go away,\" said Eve in a low voice. \"But the\nshame of it--to be supported by you.\"\n\n\"Why, you don't hate me?\"\n\n\"You know I do not.\"\n\n\"You even have a certain liking for me. I amuse you; you think me an\nodd sort of fellow, perhaps with more good than bad in me. At all\nevents, you can trust me?\"\n\n\"I can trust you perfectly.\"\n\n\"And it ain't as if I wished you to go alone. Patty will be off her\nhead with delight when the thing is proposed to her.\"\n\n\"But how can I explain to her?\"\n\n\"Don't attempt to. Leave her curiosity a good hard nut to crack. Simply\nsay you are off to Paris, and that if she'll go with you, you will bear\nall her expenses.\"\n\n\"It's so difficult to believe that you are in earnest.\"\n\n\"You must somehow bring yourself to believe it. There will be a cheque\nready for you to-morrow morning, to take or refuse. If you take it, you\nare bound in honour to leave England not later than--we'll say\nThursday. That you are to be trusted, I believe, just as firmly as you\nbelieve it of me.\"\n\n\"I can't decide to-night.\"\n\n\"I can give you only till to-morrow morning. If I don't hear from you\nby midday, I am gone.\"\n\n\"You shall hear from me--one way or the other.\"\n\n\"Then don't wait here any longer. It's after midnight, and Patty will\nbe alarmed about you. No, we won't shake hands; not that till we strike\na bargain.\"\n\nEve seemed about to walk away, but she hesitated and turned again.\n\n\"I will do as you wish--I will go.\"\n\n\"Excellent! Then speak of it to Patty as soon as possible, and tell me\nwhat she says when we meet to-morrow--where and when you like.\"\n\n\"In this same place, at nine o'clock.\"\n\n\"So be it. I will bring the cheque.\"\n\n\"But I must be able to cash it at once.\"\n\n\"So you can. It will be on a London bank. I'll get the cash myself if\nyou like.\"\n\nThen they shook hands and went in opposite directions.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nOn the evening of the next day, just after he had lit his lamp,\nHilliard's attention was drawn by a sound as of someone tapping at the\nwindow. He stood to listen, and the sound was repeated--an unmistakable\ntap of fingers on the glass. In a moment he was out in the street,\nwhere he discovered Patty Ringrose.\n\n\"Why didn't you come to see me?\" she asked excitedly.\n\n\"I was afraid _she_ might be there. Did she go to business, as usual?\"\n\n\"Yes. At least I suppose so. She only got home at the usual time. I've\nleft her there: I was bound to see you. Do you know what she told me\nlast night when she came in?\"\n\n\"I dare say I could guess.\"\n\nHilliard began to walk down the street. Patty, keeping close at his\nside, regarded him with glances of wonder.\n\n\"Is it true that we're going to Paris? I couldn't make out whether she\nmeant it, and this morning I couldn't get a word from her.\"\n\n\"Are you willing to go with her?\"\n\n\"And have all my expenses paid?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"I should think I am! But I daren't let my uncle and aunt know; there'd\nbe no end of bother. I shall have to make up some sort of tale to\nsatisfy my aunt, and get my things sent to the station while uncle's\nplaying billiards. How long is it for?\"\n\n\"Impossible to say. Three months--half a year--I don't know. What about\nMr. Daily?\"\n\n\"Oh, I've done with _him_!\"\n\n\"And you are perfectly sure that you can get employment whenever you\nneed it?\"\n\n\"Quite sure: no need to trouble about that. I'm very good friends with\naunt, and she'll take me in for as long as I want when I come back. But\nit's easy enough for anybody like me to get a place. I've had two or\nthree offers the last half-year, from good shops where they were losing\ntheir young ladies. We're always getting married, in our business, and\nplaces have to be filled up.\"\n\n\"That settles it, then.\"\n\n\"But I want to know--I can't make it out--Eve won't tell me how she's\nmanaging to go. Are _you_ going to pay for her?\"\n\n\"We won't talk of that, Patty. She's going; that's enough.\"\n\n\"You persuaded her, last night?\"\n\n\"Yes, I persuaded her. And I am to hear by the first post in the\nmorning whether she will go to-morrow or Thursday. She'll arrange\nthings with you to-night, I should think.\"\n\n\"It didn't look like it. She's shut herself in her room.\"\n\n\"I can understand that. She is ill. That's why I'm getting her away\nfrom London. Wait till we've been in Paris a few weeks, and you'll see\nhow she changes. At present she is downright ill--ill enough to go to\nbed and be nursed, if that would do any good. It's your part to look\nafter her. I don't want you to be her servant.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't mind doing anything for her.\"\n\n\"No, because you are a very good sort of girl. You 'Ii live at a hotel,\nand what you have to do is to make her enjoy herself. I shouldn't\nwonder if you find it difficult at first, but we shall get her round\nbefore long.\"\n\n\"I never thought there was anything the' matter with her.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not, but I understand her better. Of course you won't say a\nword of this to her. You take it as a holiday--as good fun. No doubt I\nshall be able to have a few words in private with you now and then. But\nat other times we must talk as if nothing special had passed between\nus.\"\n\nPatty mused. The lightness of her step told in what a spirit of gaiety\nshe looked forward to the expedition.\n\n\"Do you think,\" she asked presently, \"that it'll all come to an\nend--what I told you of?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think so.\"\n\n\"You didn't let her know that I'd been talking----\"\n\n\"Of course not. And, as I don't want her to know that you've seen me\nto-night, you had better stay no longer. She's sure to have something\nto tell you to-night or to-morrow morning. Get your packing done, and\nbe ready at any moment. When I hear from Eve in the morning, I shall\nsend her a telegram. Most likely we sha'n't see each other again until\nwe meet at Charing Cross. I hope it may be tomorrow; but Thursday is\nthe latest.\"\n\nSo Patty took her departure, tripping briskly homeward. As for\nHilliard, he returned to his sitting-room, and was busy for some time\nwith the pencilling of computations in English and French money.\nTowards midnight, he walked as far as High Street, and looked at the\nwindows above the music-shop. All was dark.\n\nHe rose very early next morning, and as post-time drew near he walked\nabout the street in agonies of suspense. He watched the letter-carrier\nfrom house to house, followed him up, and saw him pass the number at\nwhich he felt assured that he would deliver a letter. In frenzy of\ndisappointment a fierce oath burst from his lips.\n\n\"That's what comes of trusting a woman!--she is going to cheat me. She\nhas gained her end, and will put me off with excuses.\"\n\nBut perhaps a telegram would come. He made a pretence of breakfasting,\nand paced his room for an hour like a caged animal. When the monotony\nof circulating movement had all but stupefied him, he was awakened by a\ndouble postman's knock at the front door, the signal that announces a\ntelegram.\n\nAgain from Patty, and again a request that he would come to the shop at\nmid-day.\n\n\"Just as I foresaw--excuses--postponement. What woman ever had the\nsense of honour!\"\n\nTo get through the morning he drank--an occupation suggested by the\nheat of the day, which blazed cloudless. The liquor did not cheer him,\nbut inspired a sullen courage, a reckless resolve. And in this frame of\nmind he presented himself before Patty Ringrose.\n\n\"She can't go to-day,\" said Patty, with an air of concern. \"You were\nquite right--she is really ill.\"\n\n\"Has she gone out?\"\n\n\"No, she's upstairs, lying on the bed. She says she has a dreadful\nheadache, and if you saw her you'd believe it. She looks shocking. It's\nthe second night she hasn't closed her eyes.\"\n\nA savage jealousy was burning Hilliard's vitals. He had tried to make\nlight of the connection between Eve and that unknown man, even after\nher extraordinary request for money, which all but confessedly she\nwanted on his account. He had blurred the significance of such a\nsituation, persuading himself that neither was Eve capable of a great\npassion, nor the man he had seen able to inspire one. Now he rushed to\nthe conviction that Eve had fooled him with a falsehood.\n\n\"Tell her this.\" He glared at Patty with eyes which made the girl\nshrink in alarm. \"If she isn't at Charing Cross Station by a quarter to\neleven to-morrow, there's an end of it. I shall be there, and shall go\non without her. It's her only chance.\"\n\n\"But if she really _can't_----\"\n\n\"Then it's her misfortune--she must suffer for it. She goes to-morrow\nor not at all. Can you make her understand that?\"\n\n\"I'll tell her.\"\n\n\"Listen, Patty. If you bring her safe to the station to-morrow you\nshall have a ten-pound note, to buy what you like in Paris.\"\n\nThe girl reddened, half in delight, half in shame.\n\n\"I don't want it--she shall come----\"\n\n\"Very well; good-bye till to-morrow, or for good.\"\n\n\"No, no; she shall come.\"\n\nHe was drenched in perspiration, yet walked for a mile or two at his\ntopmost speed. Then a consuming thirst drove him into the nearest place\nwhere drink was sold. At six o'clock he remembered that he had not\neaten since breakfast; he dined extravagantly, and afterwards fell\nasleep in the smoking-room of the restaurant. A waiter with difficulty\naroused him, and persuaded him to try the effect of the evening air. An\nhour later he sank in exhaustion on one of the benches near the river,\nand there slept profoundly until stirred by a policeman.\n\n\"What's the time?\" was his inquiry, as he looked up at the starry sky.\n\nHe felt for his watch, but no watch was discoverable. Together with the\ngold chain it had disappeared.\n\n\"Damnation! someone has robbed me.\"\n\nThe policeman was sympathetic, but reproachful.\n\n\"Why do you go to sleep on the Embankment at this time of night? Lost\nany money?\"\n\nYes, his money too had flown; luckily, only a small sum. It was for the\nloss of his watch and chain that he grieved; they had been worn for\nyears by his father, and on that account had a far higher value for him\nthan was represented by their mere cost.\n\nAs a matter of form, he supplied the police with information concerning\nthe theft. Of recovery there could be little hope.\n\nThoroughly awakened and sober, he walked across London to Gower Place\narriving in the light of dawn. Too spiritless to take off his clothing,\nhe lay upon the bed, and through the open window watched a great cloud\nthat grew rosy above the opposite houses.\n\nWould Eve be at the place of meeting today? It seemed to him totally\nindifferent whether she came or not; nay, he all but hoped that she\nwould not. He had been guilty of prodigious folly. The girl belonged to\nanother man; and even had it not been so, what was the use of flinging\naway his money at this rate? Did he look for any reward correspondent\nto the sacrifice? She would never love him, and it was not in his power\nto complete the work he had begun, by freeing her completely from harsh\ncircumstances, setting her in a path of secure and pleasant life.\n\nBut she would not come, and so much the better. With only himself to\nprovide for he had still money enough to travel far. He would see\nsomething of the great world, and leave his future to destiny.\n\nHe dozed for an hour or two.\n\nWhilst he was at breakfast a letter arrived for him. He did not know\nthe handwriting on the envelope, but it must be Eve's. Yes. She wrote a\ncouple of lines: \"I will be at the station to-morrow at a quarter to\neleven.--E. M.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nOne travelling bag was all he carried. Some purchases that he had made\nin London--especially the great work on French cathedrals--were already\ndespatched to Birmingham, to lie in the care of Robert Narramore.\n\nHe reached Charing Cross half an hour before train-time, and waited at\nthe entrance. Several cabs that drove up stirred his expectation only\nto disappoint him. He was again in an anguish of fear lest Eve should\nnot come. A cab arrived, with two boxes of modest appearance. He\nstepped forward and saw the girls' faces.\n\nBetween him and Eve not a word passed. They avoided each other's look.\nPatty, excited and confused, shook hands with him.\n\n\"Go on to the platform,\" he said. \"I'll see after everything. This is\nall the luggage?\"\n\n\"Yes. One box is mine, and one Eve's. I had to face it out with the\npeople at home,\" she added, between laughing and crying. \"They think\nI'm going to the seaside, to stay with Eve till she gets better. I\nnever told so many fibs in my life. Uncle stormed at me, but I don't\ncare.\"\n\n\"All right; go on to the platform.\"\n\nEve was already walking in that direction. Undeniably she looked ill;\nher step was languid; she did not raise her eyes. Hilliard, when he had\ntaken tickets and booked the luggage through to Paris, approached his\ntravelling companions. Seeing him, Eve turned away.\n\n\"I shall go in a smoking compartment,\" he said to Patty. \"You had\nbetter take your tickets.\"\n\n\"But when shall we see you again?\"\n\n\"Oh, at Dover, of course.\"\n\n\"Will it be rough, do you think? I do wish Eve would talk. I can't get\na word out of her. It makes it all so miserable, when we might be\nenjoying ourselves.\"\n\n\"Don't trouble: leave her to herself. I'll get you some papers.\"\n\nOn returning from the bookstall, he slipped loose silver into Patty's\nhands.\n\n\"Use that if you want anything on the journey. And--I haven't forgot my\npromise.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\"\n\n\"Go and take your places now: there's only ten minutes to wait.\"\n\nHe watched them as they passed the harrier. Neither of the girls was\ndressed very suitably for travelling; but Eve's costume resembled that\nof a lady, while Patty's might suggest that she was a lady's-maid. As\nif to confirm this distinction, Patty had burdened herself with several\nsmall articles, whereas her friend carried only a sunshade. They\ndisappeared among people upon the platform. In a few minutes Hilliard\nfollowed, glanced along the carriages till he saw where the girls were\nseated, and took his own place. He wore a suit which had been new on\nhis first arrival in London, good enough in quality and cut to give his\nfeatures the full value of their intelligence; a brown felt hat, a\nrusset necktie, a white flannel shirt. Finding himself with a talkative\nneighbour in the carriage, he chatted freely. As soon as the train had\nstarted, he lit his pipe and tasted the tobacco with more relish than\nfor a long time.\n\nOn board the steamer Eve kept below from first to last. Patty walked\nthe deck with Hilliard, and vastly to her astonishment, achieved the\nvoyage without serious discomfort. Hilliard himself, with the sea wind\nin his nostrils, recovered that temper of buoyant satisfaction which\nhad accompanied his first escape from London. He despised the weak\nmisgivings and sordid calculations of yesterday. Here he was, on a\nChannel steamer, bearing away from disgrace and wretchedness the woman\nwhom his heart desired. Wild as the project had seemed to him when\nfirst he conceived it, he had put it into execution. The moment was\nworth living for. Whatever the future might keep in store for him of\ndreary, toilsome, colourless existence, the retrospect would always\nshow him this patch of purple--a memory precious beyond all the\npossible results of prudence and narrow self-regard.\n\nThe little she-Cockney by his side entertained him with the flow of her\nchatter; it had the advantage of making him feel a travelled man.\n\n\"I didn't cross this way when I came before,\" he explained to her.\n\"From Newhaven it's a much longer voyage.\"\n\n\"You like the sea, then?\"\n\n\"I chose it because it was cheaper--that's all.\"\n\n\"Yet you're so extravagant now,\" remarked Patty, with eyes that\nconfessed admiration of this quality.\n\n\"Oh, because I am rich,\" he answered gaily. \"Money is nothing to me.\"\n\n\"Are you really rich? Eve said you weren't.\"\n\n\"Did she?\"\n\n\"I don't mean she said it in a disagreeable way. It was last night. She\nthought you were wasting your money upon us.\"\n\n\"If I choose to waste it, why not? Isn't there a pleasure in doing as\nyou like?\"\n\n\"Oh, of course there is,\" Patty assented. \"I only wish I had the\nchance. But it's awfully jolly, this! Who'd have thought, a week ago,\nthat I should be going to Paris? I have a feeling all the time that I\nshall wake up and find I've been dreaming.\"\n\n\"Suppose you go down and see whether Eve wants anything? You needn't\nsay I sent you.\"\n\nFrom Calais to Paris he again travelled apart from the girls. Fatigue\novercame him, and for the last hour or two he slept, with the result\nthat, on alighting at the Gare du Nord, he experienced a decided\nfailure of spirits. Happily, there was nothing before him but to carry\nout a plan already elaborated. With the aid of his guide-book he had\nselected an hotel which seemed suitable for the girls, one where\nEnglish was spoken, and thither he drove with them from the station.\nThe choice of their rooms, and the settlement of details took only a\nfew minutes; then, for almost the first time since leaving Charing\nCross, he spoke to Eve.\n\n\"Patty will do everything she can for you,\" he said; \"I shall be not\nvery far away, and you can always send me a message if you wish.\nTo-morrow morning I shall come at about ten to ask how you are--nothing\nmore than that--unless you care to go anywhere.\"\n\nThe only reply was \"Thank you,\" in a weary tone. And so, having taken\nhis leave he set forth to discover a considerably less expensive\nlodging for himself. In this, after his earlier acquaintance with\nParis, he had no difficulty; by half-past eight his business was done,\nand he sat down to dinner at a cheap restaurant. A headache spoilt his\nenjoyment of the meal. After a brief ramble about the streets, he went\nhome and got into a bed which was rather too short for him, but\notherwise promised sufficient comfort.\n\nThe first thing that came into his mind when he awoke next morning was\nthat he no longer possessed a watch; the loss cast a gloom upon him.\nBut he had slept well, and a flood of sunshine that streamed over his\nscantily carpeted floor, together with gladly remembered sounds from\nthe street, soon put him into an excellent humour. He sprang tip,\npartly dressed himself, and unhasped the window. The smell of Paris had\nbecome associated in his mind with thoughts of liberty; a grotesque\ndance about the bed-room expressed his joy.\n\nAs he anticipated, Patty alone received him when he called upon the\ngirls. She reported that Eve felt unable to rise.\n\n\"What do you think about her?\" he asked. \"Nothing serious, is it?\"\n\n\"She can't get rid of her headache.\"\n\n\"Let her rest as long as she likes. Are you comfortable here?\"\n\nPatty was in ecstasies with everything, and chattered on breathlessly.\nShe wished to go out; Eve had no need of her--indeed had told her that\nabove all she wished to be left alone.\n\n\"Get ready, then,\" said Hilliard, \"and we'll have an hour or two.\"\n\nThey walked to the Madeleine and rode thence on the top of a tram-car\nto the Bastille. By this time Patty had come to regard her strange\ncompanion in a sort of brotherly light; no restraint whatever appeared\nin her conversation with him. Eve, she told him, had talked French with\nthe chambermaid.\n\n\"And I fancy it was something she didn't want _me_ to understand.\"\n\n\"Why should you think so?\"\n\n\"Oh, something in the way the girl looked at me.\"\n\n\"No, no; you were mistaken. She only wanted to show that she knew some\nFrench.\"\n\nBut Hilliard wondered whether Patty could be right. Was it not possible\nthat Eve had gratified her vanity by representing her friend as a\nservant--a lady's-maid? Yet why should he attribute such a fault to\nher? It was an odd thing that he constantly regarded Eve in the least\nfavourable light, giving weight to all the ill he conjectured in her,\nand minimising those features of her character which, at the beginning,\nhe had been prepared to observe with sympathy and admiration. For a man\nin love his reflections followed a very unwonted course. And, indeed,\nhe had never regarded his love as of very high or pure quality; it was\nsomething that possessed him and constrained him--by no means a source\nof elevating emotion.\n\n\"Do you like Eve?\" he asked abruptly, disregarding some trivial\nquestion Patty had put to him.\n\n\"Like her? Of course I do.\"\n\n\"And _why_ do you like her?\"\n\n\"Why?--ah--I don't know. Because I do.\"\n\nAnd she laughed foolishly.\n\n\"Does Eve like _you_?\" Hilliard continued.\n\n\"I think she does. Else I don't see why she kept up with me.\"\n\n\"Has she ever done you any kindness?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know. Nothing particular. She never gave anything, if\nyou mean that. But she has paid for me at theatres and so on.\"\n\nHilliard quitted the subject.\n\n\"If you like to go out alone,\" he told her before they parted, \"there's\nno reason why you shouldn't--just as you do in London. Remember the way\nback, that's all, and don't be out late. And you'll want some French\nmoney.\"\n\n\"But I don't understand it, and how can I buy anything when I can't\nspeak a word?\"\n\n\"All the same, take that and keep it till you are able to make use of\nit. It's what I promised you.\"\n\nPatty drew back her hand, but her objections were not difficult to\novercome.\n\n\"I dare say,\" Hilliard continued, \"Eve doesn't understand the money\nmuch better than you do. But she'll soon be well enough to talk, and\nthen I shall explain everything to her. On this piece of paper is my\naddress; please let Eve have it. I shall call to-morrow morning again.\"\n\nHe did so, and this time found Eve, as well as her companion, ready to\ngo out. No remark or inquiry concerning her health passed his lips; he\nsaw that she was recovering from the crisis she had passed through,\nwhatever its real nature. Eve shook hands with him, and smiled, though\nas if discharging an obligation.\n\n\"Can you spare time to show us something of Paris?\" she asked.\n\n\"I am your official guide. Make use of me whenever it pleases you.\"\n\n\"I don't feel able to go very far. Isn't there some place where we\ncould sit down in the open air?\"\n\nA carriage was summoned, and they drove to the Fields Elysian. Eve\nbenefited by the morning thus spent. She left to Patty most of the\nconversation, but occasionally made inquiries, and began to regard\nthings with a healthy interest. The next day they all visited the\nLouvre, for a light rain was falling, and here Hilliard found an\nopportunity of private talk with Eve; they sat together whilst Patty,\nwho cared little for pictures, looked out of a window at the Seine.\n\n\"Do you like the hotel I chose?\" he began.\n\n\"Everything is very nice.\"\n\n\"And you are not sorry to be here?\"\n\n\"Not in one way. In another I can't understand how I come to be here at\nall.\"\n\n\"Your physician has ordered it.\"\n\n\"Yes--so I suppose it's all right.\"\n\n\"There's one thing I'm obliged to speak of. Do you understand French\nmoney?\"\n\nEve averted her face, and spoke after a slight delay.\n\n\"I can easily learn.\"\n\n\"Yes. You shall take this Paris guide home with you. You'll find all\ninformation of that sort in it. And I shall give you an envelope\ncontaining money--just for your private use. You have nothing to do\nwith the charges at the hotel.\"\n\n\"I've brought it on myself; but I feel more ashamed than I can tell\nyou.\"\n\n\"If you tried to tell me I shouldn't listen. What you have to do now is\nto get well. Very soon you and Patty will be able to find your way\nabout together; then I shall only come with you when you choose to\ninvite me. You have my address.\"\n\nHe rose and broke off the dialogue.\n\nFor a week or more Eve's behaviour in his company underwent little\nchange. In health she decidedly improved, but Hilliard always found her\nreserved, coldly amicable, with an occasional suggestion of forced\nhumility which he much disliked. From Patty he learnt that she went\nabout a good deal and seemed to enjoy herself.\n\n\"We don't always go together,\" said the girl. \"Yesterday and the day\nbefore Eve was away by herself all the afternoon. Of course she can get\non all right with her French. She takes to Paris as if she'd lived here\nfor years.\"\n\nOn the day after, Hilliard received a postcard in which Eve asked him\nto be in a certain room of the Louvre at twelve o'clock. He kept the\nappointment, and found Eve awaiting him alone.\n\n\"I wanted to ask whether you would mind if we left the hotel and went\nto live at another place?\"\n\nHe heard her with surprise.\n\n\"You are not comfortable?\"\n\n\"Quite. But I have been to see my friend Mdlle. Roche--you remember.\nAnd she has shown me how we can live very comfortably at a quarter of\nwhat it costs now, in the same house where she has a room. I should\nlike to change, if you'll let me.\"\n\n\"Pooh! You're not to think of the cost----\"\n\n\"Whether I am to or not, I do, and can't help myself. I know the hotel\nis fearfully expensive, and I shall like the other place much better.\nMiss Roche is a very nice girl, and she was glad to see me; and if I'm\nnear her, I shall get all sorts of advantages--in French, and so on.\"\n\nHilliard wondered what accounts of herself Eve had rendered to the\nParisienne, but he did not venture to ask.\n\n\"Will Patty like it as well?\"\n\n\"Just as well. Miss Roche speaks English, you know, and they'll get on\nvery well together.\"\n\n\"Where is the place?\"\n\n\"Rather far off--towards the Jardin des Plantes. But I don't think that\nwould matter, would it?\"\n\n\"I leave it entirely to you.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" she answered, with that intonation he did not like. \"Of\ncourse, if you would like to meet Miss Roche, you can.\"\n\n\"We'll think about it. It's enough that she's an old friend of yours.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nWhen this change had been made Eve seemed to throw off a burden. She\nmet Hilliard with something like the ease of manner, the frank\nfriendliness, which marked her best moods in their earlier intercourse.\nAt a restaurant dinner, to which he persuaded her in company with\nPatty, she was ready in cheerful talk, and an expedition to Versailles,\nsome days after, showed her radiant with the joy of sunshine and\nmovement. Hilliard could not but wonder at the success of his\nprescription.\n\nHe did not visit the girls in their new abode, and nothing more was\nsaid of his making the acquaintance of Mdlle. Roche. Meetings were\nappointed by post-card--always in Patty's hand if the initiative were\nfemale; they took place three or four times a week. As it was now\nnecessary for Eve to make payments on her own account, Hilliard\ndespatched to her by post a remittance in paper money, and of this no\nword passed between them. Three weeks later he again posted the same\nsum. On the morrow they went by river to St. Cloud--it was always a\ntrio, Hilliard never making any other proposal--and the steam-boat\nafforded Eve an opportunity of speaking with her generous friend apart.\n\n\"I don't want this money,\" she said, giving him an envelope. \"What you\nsent before isn't anything like finished. There's enough for a month\nmore.\"\n\n\"Keep it all the same. I won't have any pinching.\"\n\n\"There's nothing of the kind. If I don't have my way in this I shall go\nback to London.\"\n\nHe put the envelope in his pocket, and stood silent, with eyes fixed on\nthe river bank.\n\n\"How long do you intend us to stay?\" asked Eve.\n\n\"As long as you find pleasure here.\"\n\n\"And--what am I to do afterwards?\"\n\nHe glanced at her.\n\n\"A holiday must come to an end,\" she added, trying, but without\nsuccess, to meet his look.\n\n\"I haven't given any thought to that,\" said Hilliard, carelessly;\n\"there's plenty of time. It will be fine weather for many weeks yet.\"\n\n\"But I have been thinking about it. I should be crazy if I didn't.\"\n\n\"Tell me your thoughts, then.\"\n\n\"Should you be satisfied if I got a place at Birmingham?\"\n\nThere again Was the note of self-abasement. It irritated the listener.\n\n\"Why do you put it in that way? There's no question of what satisfies\nme, but of what is good for you.\"\n\n\"Then I think it had better be Birmingham.\"\n\n\"Very well. It's understood that when we leave Paris we go there.\"\n\nA silence. Then Eve asked abruptly:\n\n\"You will go as well?\"\n\n\"Yes, I shall go back.\"\n\n\"And what becomes of your determination to enjoy life as long as you\ncan?\"\n\n\"I'm carrying it out. I shall go back satisfied, at all events.\"\n\n\"And return to your old work?\"\n\n\"I don't know. It depends on all sorts of things. We won't talk of it\njust yet.\"\n\nPatty approached, and Hilliard turned to her with a bright, jesting\nface.\n\nMidway in August, on his return home one afternoon, the concierge let\nhim know that two English gentlemen had been inquiring for him; one of\nthem had left a card. With surprise and pleasure Hilliard read the name\nof Robert Narramore, and beneath it, written in pencil, an invitation\nto dine that evening at a certain hotel in the Rue de Provence. As\nusual, Narramore had neglected the duties of a correspondent; this was\nthe first announcement of his intention to be in Paris. Who the second\nman might be Hilliard could not conjecture.\n\nHe arrived at the hotel, and found Narramore in company with a man of\nabout the same age, his name Birching, to Hilliard a stranger. They had\nreached Paris this morning, and would remain only for a day or two, as\ntheir purpose was towards the Alps.\n\n\"I couldn't stand this heat,\" remarked Narramore, who, in the very\nlightest of tourist garbs, sprawled upon a divan, and drank something\niced out of a tall tumbler. \"We shouldn't have stopped here at all if\nit hadn't been for you. The idea is that you should go on with us.\"\n\n\"Can't--impossible----\"\n\n\"Why, what are you doing here--besides roasting?\"\n\n\"Eating and drinking just what suits my digestion.\"\n\n\"You look pretty fit--a jolly sight better than when we met last. All\nthe same, you will go on with us. We won't argue it now; it's\ndinner-time. Wait till afterwards.\"\n\nAt table, Narramore mentioned that his friend Birching was an architect.\n\n\"Just what this fellow ought to have been,\" he said, indicating\nHilliard. \"Architecture is his hobby. I believe he could sit down and\ndraw to scale a front elevation of any great cathedral in\nEurope--couldn't you, Hilliard?\"\n\nLaughing the joke aside, Hilliard looked with interest at Mr. Birching,\nand began to talk with him. The three young men consumed a good deal of\nwine, and after dinner strolled about the streets, until Narramore's\nfatigue and thirst brought them to a pause at a cafe on the Boulevard\ndes Italiens. Birching presently moved apart, to reach a newspaper, and\nremained out of earshot while Narramore talked with his other friend.\n\n\"What's going on?\" he began. \"What are you doing here? Seriously, I\nwant you to go along with us. Birching is a very good sort of chap, but\njust a trifle heavy--takes things rather solemnly for such hot weather.\nIs it the expense? Hang it! You and I know each other well enough, and,\nthanks to my old uncle----\"\n\n\"Never mind that, old boy,\" interposed Hilliard. \"How long are you\ngoing for?\"\n\n\"I can't very well be away for more than three weeks. The brass\nbedsteads, you know----\"\n\nHilliard agreed to join in the tour.\n\n\"That's right: I've been looking forward to it,\" said his friend\nheartily. \"And now, haven't you anything to tell me? Are you alone\nhere? Then, what the deuce do you do with yourself?\"\n\n\"Chiefly meditate.\"\n\n\"You're the rummest fellow I ever knew. I've wanted to write to you,\nbut--hang it!--what with hot weather and brass bedsteads, and this and\nthat----Now, what _are_ you going to do? Your money won't last for\never. Haven't you any projects? It was no good talking about it before\nyou left Dudley. I saw that. You were all but fit for a lunatic asylum,\nand no wonder. But you've pulled round, I see. Never saw you looking in\nsuch condition. What is to be the next move?\"\n\n\"I have no idea.\"\n\n\"Well, now, _I_ have. This fellow Birching is partner with his brother,\nin Brum, and they're tolerably flourishing. I've thought of you ever\nsince I came to know him; I think it was chiefly on your account that I\ngot thick with him--though there was another reason I'll tell you about\nthat some time. Now, why shouldn't you go into their office? Could you\nmanage to pay a small premium? I believe I could square it with them. I\nhaven't said anything. I never hurry--like things to ripen naturally.\nSuppose you saw your way, in a year or two, to make only as much in an\narchitect's office as you did in that----machine-shop, wouldn't it be\nworth while?\"\n\nHilliard mused. Already he had a flush on his cheek, but his eyes\nsensibly brightened.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said at length with deliberation. \"It would be worth while.\"\n\n\"So I should think. Well, wait till you've got to be a bit chummy with\nBirching. I think you'll suit each other. Let him see that you do\nreally know something about architecture--there'll be plenty of\nchances.\"\n\nHilliard, still musing, repeated with mechanical emphasis:\n\n\"Yes, it would be worth while.\"\n\nThen Narramore called to Birching, and the talk became general again.\n\nThe next morning they drove about Paris, all together. Narramore,\nthough it was his first visit to the city, declined to see anything\nwhich demanded exertion, and the necessity for quenching his thirst\nrecurred with great frequency. Early in the afternoon he proposed that\nthey should leave Paris that very evening.\n\n\"I want to see a mountain with snow on it. We're bound to travel by\nnight, and another day of this would settle me. Any objection,\nBirching?\"\n\nThe architect agreed, and time-tables were consulted. Hilliard drove\nhome to pack. When this was finished, he sat down and wrote a letter:\n\n\n\"DEAR MISS MADELEY,--My friend Narramore is here, and has persuaded me\nto go to Switzerland with him. I shall be away for a week or two, and\nwill let you hear from me in the meantime. Narramore says I am looking\nvastly better, and it is you I have to thank for this. Without you, my\nattempts at 'enjoying life' would have been a poor business. We start\nin an hour or two,--Yours ever,\n\n\"MAURICE HILLIARD.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nHe was absent for full three weeks, and arrived with his friends at the\nGare de Lyon early one morning of September. Narramore and the\narchitect delayed only for a meal, and pursued their journey homeward;\nHilliard returned to his old quarters despatched a post-card asking Eve\nand Patty to dine with him that evening, and thereupon went to bed,\nwhere for some eight hours he slept the sleep of healthy fatigue.\n\nThe place he had appointed for meeting with the girls was at the foot\nof the Boulevard St. Michel. Eve came alone.\n\n\"And where's Patty?\" he asked, grasping her hand heartily in return for\nthe smile of unfeigned pleasure with which she welcomed him.\n\n\"Ah, where indeed? Getting near to Charing Cross by now, I think.\"\n\n\"She has gone back?\"\n\n\"Went this very morning, before I had your card--let us get out of the\nway of people. She has been dreadfully home-sick. About a fortnight ago\na mysterious letter came for her she hid it away from me. A few days\nafter another came, and she shut herself up for a long time, and when\nshe came out again I saw she had been crying. Then we talked it over.\nShe had written to Mr. Dally and got an answer that made her miserable;\nthat was the _first_ letter. She wrote again, and had a reply that made\nher still more wretched; and that was the _second_. Two or three more\ncame, and yesterday she could bear it no longer.\"\n\n\"Then she has gone home to make it up with him?\"\n\n\"Of course. He declared that she has utterly lost her character and\nthat no honest man could have anything more to say to her! I shouldn't\nwonder if they are married in a few weeks' time.\"\n\nHilliard laughed light-heartedly.\n\n\"I was to beg you on my knees to forgive her,\" pursued Eve. \"But I\ncan't very well do that in the middle of the street, can I? Really, she\nthinks she has behaved disgracefully to you. She wouldn't write a\nletter--she was ashamed. 'Tell him to forget all about me!' she kept\nsaying.\"\n\n\"Good little girl! And what sort of a husband will this fellow Dally\nmake her?\"\n\n\"No worse than husbands in general, I dare say--but how well you look!\nHow you must have been enjoying yourself!\"\n\n\"I can say exactly the same about you!\"\n\n\"Oh, but you are sunburnt, and look quite a different man!\"\n\n\"And you have an exquisite colour in your cheeks, and eyes twice as\nbright as they used to be; and one would think you had never known a\ncare.\"\n\n\"I feel almost like that,\" said Eve, laughing.\n\nHe tried to meet her eyes; she eluded him.\n\n\"I have an Alpine hunger; where shall we dine?\"\n\nThe point called for no long discussion, and presently they were seated\nin the cool restaurant. Whilst he nibbled an olive, Hilliard ran over\nthe story of his Swiss tour.\n\n\"If only _you_ had been there! It was the one thing lacking.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't have enjoyed yourself half so much. You amused me by your\ndescription of Mr. Narramore, in the letter from Geneva.\"\n\n\"The laziest rascal born! But the best-tempered, the easiest to live\nwith. A thoroughly good fellow; I like him better than ever. Of course\nhe is improved by coming in for money--who wouldn't be, that has any\ngood in him at all? But it amazes me that he can be content to go back\nto Birmingham and his brass bedsteads. Sheer lack of energy, I suppose.\nHe'll grow dreadfully fat, I fear, and by when he becomes really a rich\nman--it's awful to think of.\"\n\nEve asked many questions about Narramore; his image gave mirthful\noccupation to her fancy. The dinner went merrily on, and when the black\ncoffee was set before them:\n\n\"Why not have it outside?\" said Eve. \"You would like to smoke, I know.\"\n\nHilliard assented, and they seated themselves under the awning. The\nboulevard glowed in a golden light of sunset; the sound of its traffic\nwas subdued to a lulling rhythm.\n\n\"There's a month yet before the leaves will begin to fall,\" murmured\nthe young man, when he had smoked awhile in silence.\n\n\"Yes,\" was the answer. \"I shall be glad to have a little summer still\nin Birmingham.\"\n\n\"Do you wish to go?\"\n\n\"I shall go to-morrow, or the day after,\" Eve replied quietly.\n\nThen again there came silence.\n\n\"Something has been proposed to me,\" said Hilliard, at length, leaning\nforward with his elbows upon the table. \"I mentioned that our friend\nBirching is an architect. He's in partnership with his brother, a much\nolder man. Well, they nave offered to take me into their office if I\npay a premium of fifty guineas. As soon as I can qualify myself to be\nof use to them, they'll give me a salary. And I shall have the chance\nof eventually doing much better than I ever could at the old grind,\nwhere, in fact, I had no prospect whatever.\"\n\n\"That's very good news,\" Eve remarked, gazing across the street.\n\n\"You think I ought to accept?\"\n\n\"I suppose you can pay the fifty guineas, and still leave yourself\nenough to live upon?\"\n\n\"Enough till I earn something,\" Hilliard answered with a smile.\n\n\"Then I should think there's no doubt.\"\n\n\"The question is this--are you perfectly willing to go back to\nBirmingham?\"\n\n\"I'm _anxious_ to go.\"\n\n\"You feel quite restored to health?\"\n\n\"I was never so well in my life.\"\n\nHilliard looked into her face, and could easily believe that she spoke\nthe truth. His memory would no longer recall the photograph in Mrs.\nBrewer's album; the living Eve, with her progressive changes of\ncountenance, had obliterated that pale image of her bygone self. He saw\nher now as a beautiful woman, mysterious to him still in many respects,\nyet familiar as though they had been friends for years.\n\n\"Then, whatever life is before me,\" he said. \"I shall have done _one_\nthing that is worth doing.\"\n\n\"Perhaps--if everyone's life is worth saving,\" Eve answered in a voice\njust audible.\n\n\"Everyone's is not; but yours was.\"\n\nTwo men who had been sitting not far from them rose and walked away. As\nif more at her ease for this secession, Eve looked at her companion,\nand said in a tone of intimacy:\n\n\"How I must have puzzled you when you first saw me in London!\"\n\nHe answered softly:\n\n\"To be sure you did. And the thought of it puzzles me still.\"\n\n\"Oh, but can't you understand? No; of course you can't--I have told you\nso little. Just give me an idea of what sort of person you expected to\nfind.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will. Judging from your portrait, and from what I was told of\nyou, I looked for a sad, solitary, hard-working girl--rather poorly\ndressed--taking no pleasure--going much to chapel--shrinking from the\nordinary world.\"\n\n\"And you felt disappointed?\"\n\n\"At first, yes; or, rather, bewildered--utterly unable to understand\nyou.\"\n\n\"You are disappointed still?\" she asked.\n\n\"I wouldn't have you anything but what you are.\"\n\n\"Still, that other girl was the one you _wished_ to meet.\"\n\n\"Yes, before I had seen you. It was the sort of resemblance between her\nlife and my own. I thought of sympathy between us. And the face of the\nportrait--but I see better things in the face that is looking at me\nnow.\"\n\n\"Don't be quite sure of that--yes, perhaps. It's better to be healthy,\nand enjoy life, than broken-spirited and hopeless. The strange thing is\nthat you were right--you fancied me just the kind of a girl I was: sad\nand solitary, and shrinking from people--true enough. And I went to\nchapel, and got comfort from it--as I hope to do again. Don't think\nthat I have no religion. But I was so unhealthy, and suffered so in\nevery way. Work and anxiety without cease, from when I was twelve years\nold. You know all about my father? If I hadn't been clever at figures,\nwhat would have become of me? I should have drudged at some wretched\noccupation until the work and the misery of everything killed me.\"\n\nHilliard listened intently, his eyes never stirring from her face.\n\n\"The change in me began when father came back to us, and I began to\nfeel my freedom. Then I wanted to get away, and to live by myself. I\nthought of London--I've told you how much I always thought of\nLondon--but I hadn't the courage to go there. In Birmingham I began to\nchange my old habits; but more in what I thought than what I did. I\nwished to enjoy myself like other girls, but I couldn't. For one thing,\nI thought it wicked; and then I was so afraid of spending a penny--I\nhad so often known what it was to be in want of a copper to buy food.\nSo I lived quite alone; sat in my room every evening and read books.\nYou could hardly believe what a number of books I read in that year.\nSometimes I didn't go to bed till two or three o'clock.\"\n\n\"What sort of books?\"\n\n\"I got them from the Free Library--books of all kinds; not only novels.\nI've never been particularly fond of novels; they always made me feel\nmy own lot all the harder. I never could understand what people mean\nwhen they say that reading novels takes them 'out of themselves.' It\nwas never so with me. I liked travels and lives of people, and books\nabout the stars. Why do you laugh?\"\n\n\"You escaped from yourself _there_, at all events.\"\n\n\"At last I saw an advertisement in a newspaper--a London paper in the\nreading-room--which I was tempted to answer; and I got an engagement in\nLondon. When the time came for starting I was so afraid and\nlow-spirited that I all but gave it up. I should have done, if I could\nhave known what was before me. The first year in London was all\nloneliness and ill-health. I didn't make a friend, and I starved\nmyself, all to save money. Out of my pound a week I saved several\nshillings--just because it was the habit of my whole life to pinch and\npare and deny myself. I was obliged to dress decently, and that came\nout of my food. It's certain I must have a very good constitution to\nhave gone through all that and be as well as I am to-day.\"\n\n\"It will never come again,\" said Hilliard.\n\n\"How can I be sure of that? I told you once before that I'm often in\ndread of the future. It would be ever so much worse, after knowing what\nit means to enjoy one's life. How do people feel who are quite sure\nthey can never want as long as they live? I have tried to imagine it,\nbut I can't; it would be too wonderful.\"\n\n\"You may know it some day.\"\n\nEve reflected.\n\n\"It was Patty Ringrose,\" she continued, \"who taught me to take life\nmore easily. I was astonished to find how much enjoyment she could get\nout of an hour or two of liberty, with sixpence to spend. She did me\ngood by laughing at me, and in the end I astonished _her_. Wasn't it\nnatural that I should be reckless as soon as I got the chance?\"\n\n\"I begin to understand.\"\n\n\"The chance came in this way. One Sunday morning I went by myself to\nHampstead, and as I was wandering about on the Heath I kicked against\nsomething. It was a cash-box, which I saw couldn't have been lying\nthere very long. I found it had been broken open, and inside it were a\nlot of letters--old letters in envelopes; nothing else. The addresses\non the envelopes were all the same--to a gentleman living at Hampstead.\nI thought the best I could do was to go and inquire for this address;\nand I found it, and rang the door-bell. When I told the servant what I\nwanted--it was a large house--she asked me to come in, and after I had\nwaited a little she took me into a library, where a gentleman was\nsitting. I had to answer a good many questions, and the man talked\nrather gruffly to me. When he had made a note of my name and where I\nlived, he said that I should hear from him, and so I went away. Of\ncourse I hoped to have a reward, but for two or three days I heard\nnothing; then, when I was at business, someone asked to see me--a man I\ndidn't know. He said he had come from Mr. So and So, the gentleman at\nHampstead, and had brought something for me--four five-pound notes. The\ncash-box had been stolen by someone, with other things, the night\nbefore I found it, and the letters in it, which disappointed the thief,\nhad a great value for their owner. All sorts of inquiries had been made\nabout me and no doubt I very nearly got into the hands of the police,\nbut it was all right, and I had twenty pounds reward. Think! twenty\npounds!\"\n\nHilliard nodded.\n\n\"I told no one about it--not even Patty. And I put the money into the\nPost Office savings bank. I meant it to stay there till I might be in\nneed; but I thought of it day and night. And only a fortnight after, my\nemployers shut up their place of business, and I had nothing to do. All\none night I lay awake, and when I got up in the morning I felt as if I\nwas no longer my old self. I saw everything in a different way--felt\naltogether changed. I had made up my mind not to look for a new place,\nbut to take my money out of the Post Office--I had more than\ntwenty-five pounds there altogether--and spend it for my pleasure. It\nwas just as if something had enraged me, and I was bent on avenging\nmyself. All that day I walked about the town, looking at shops, and\nthinking what I should like to buy: but I only spent a shilling or two,\nfor meals. The next day I bought some new clothing. The day after that\nI took Patty to the theatre, and astonished her by my extravagance; but\nI gave her no explanation, and to this day she doesn't understand how I\ngot my money. In a sort of way, I _did_ enjoy myself. For one thing, I\ntook a subscription at Mudie's, and began to read once more. You can't\nthink how it pleased me to get my books--new books--where rich people\ndo. I changed a volume about every other day--I had so many hours I\ndidn't know what to do with. Patty was the only friend I had made, so I\ntook her about with me whenever she could get away in the evening.\"\n\n\"Yet never once dined at a restaurant,\" remarked Hilliard, laughing.\n\"There's the difference between man and woman.\"\n\n\"My ideas of extravagance were very modest, after all.\"\n\nHilliard, fingering his coffee-cup, said in a lower voice:\n\n\"Yet you haven't told me everything.\"\n\nEve looked away, and kept silence.\n\n\"By the time I met you\"--he spoke in his ordinary tone--\"you had begun\nto grow tired of it.\"\n\n\"Yes--and----\" She rose. \"We won't sit here any longer.\"\n\nWhen they had walked for a few minutes:\n\n\"How long shall you stay in Paris?\" she asked.\n\n\"Won't you let me travel with you?\"\n\n\"I do whatever you wish,\" Eve answered simply.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nHer accent of submission did not affect Hilliard as formerly; with a\nnervous thrill, he felt that she spoke as her heart dictated. In his\nabsence Eve had come to regard him, if not with the feeling he desired,\nwith something that resembled it; he read the change in her eyes. As\nthey walked slowly away she kept nearer to him than of wont; now and\nthen her arm touched his, and the contact gave him a delicious\nsensation. Askance he observed her figure, its graceful, rather\nlanguid, movement; to-night she had a new power over him, and excited\nwith a passion which made his earlier desires seem spiritless.\n\n\"One day more of Paris?\" he asked softly.\n\n\"Wouldn't it be better----?\" she hesitated in the objection.\n\n\"Do you wish to break the journey in London?\"\n\n\"No; let us go straight on.\"\n\n\"To-morrow, then?\"\n\n\"I don't think we ought to put it off. The holiday is over.\"\n\nHilliard nodded with satisfaction. An incident of the street occupied\nthem for a few minutes, and their serious conversation was only resumed\nwhen they had crossed to the south side of the river, where they turned\neastwards and went along the quays.\n\n\"Till I can find something to do,\" Eve said at length, \"I shall live at\nDudley. Father will be very glad to have me there. He wished me to stay\nlonger.\"\n\n\"I am wondering whether it is really necessary for you to go back to\nyour drudgery.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course it is,\" she answered quickly. \"I mustn't be idle. That's\nthe very worst thing for me. And how am I to live?\"\n\n\"I have still plenty of money,\" said Hilliard, regarding her.\n\n\"No more than you will need.\"\n\n\"But think--how little more it costs for two than for one----\"\n\nHe spoke in spite of himself, having purposed no such suggestion. Eve\nquickened her step.\n\n\"No, no, no! You have a struggle before you; you don't know what----\"\n\n\"And if it would make it easier for me?--there's no real doubt about my\ngetting on well enough----\"\n\n\"Everything is doubtful.\" She spoke in a voice of agitation. \"We can't\nsee a day before us. We have arranged everything very well----\"\n\nHilliard was looking across the river. He walked more and more slowly,\nand turned at length to stand by the parapet. His companion remained\napart from him, waiting. But he did not turn towards her again, and she\nmoved to his side.\n\n\"I know how ungrateful I must seem.\" She spoke without looking at him.\n\"I have no right to refuse anything after all you----\"\n\n\"Don't say that,\" he interrupted impatiently. \"That's the one thing I\nshall never like to think of.\"\n\n\"I shall think of it always, and be glad to remember it----\"\n\n\"Come nearer--give me your hand----\"\n\nHolding it, he drew her against his side, and they stood in silence\nlooking upon the Seine, now dark beneath the clouding night.\n\n\"I can't feel sure of you,\" fell at length from Hilliard.\n\n\"I promise----\"\n\n\"Yes; here, now, in Paris. But when you are back in that hell----\"\n\n\"What difference can it make in me? It can't change what I feel now.\nYou have altered all my life, my thoughts about everything. When I look\nback, I don't know myself. You were right; I must have been suffering\nfrom an illness that affected my mind. It seems impossible that I could\never have done such things. I ought to tell you. Do you wish me to tell\nyou everything?\"\n\nHilliard spoke no answer, but he pressed her hand more tightly in his\nown.\n\n\"You knew it from Patty, didn't you?\"\n\n\"She told me as much as she knew that night when I waited for you in\nHigh Street. She said you were in danger, and I compelled her to tell\nall she could.\"\n\n\"I _was_ in danger, though I can't understand now how it went so far as\nthat. It was he who came to me with the money, from the gentleman at\nHampstead. That was how I first met him. The next day he waited for me\nwhen I came away from business.\"\n\n\"It was the first time that anything of that kind had happened?\"\n\n\"The first time. And you know what the state of my mind was then. But\nto the end I never felt any--I never really loved him. We met and went\nto places together. After my loneliness--you can understand. But I\ndistrusted him. Did Patty tell you why I left London so suddenly?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"When that happened I knew my instinct had been right from the first.\nIt gave me very little pain, but I was ashamed and disgusted. He hadn't\ntried to deceive me in words; he never spoke of marriage; and from what\nI found out then, I saw that he was very much to be pitied.\"\n\n\"You seem to contradict yourself,\" said Hilliard. \"Why were you ashamed\nand disgusted?\"\n\n\"At finding myself in the power of such a woman. He married her when\nshe was very young, and I could imagine the life he had led with her\nuntil he freed himself. A hateful woman!\"\n\n\"Hateful to you, I see,\" muttered the listener, with something tight at\nhis heart.\n\n\"Not because I felt anything like jealousy. You must believe me. I\nshould never have spoken if I hadn't meant to tell you the simple\ntruth.\"\n\nAgain he pressed her hand. The warmth of her body had raised his blood\nto fever-heat.\n\n\"When we met again, after I came back, it was by chance. I refused to\nspeak to him, but he followed me all along the street, and I didn't\nknow it till I was nearly home. Then he came up again, and implored me\nto hear what he had to say. I knew he would wait for me again in High\nStreet, so I had no choice but to listen, and then tell him that there\ncouldn't be anything more between us. And, for all that, he followed me\nanother day. And again I had to listen to him.\"\n\nHilliard fancied that he could feel her heart beat against his arm.\n\n\"Be quick!\" he said. \"Tell all, and have done with it.\"\n\n\"He told me, at last, that he was ruined. His wife had brought him into\nmoney difficulties; she ran up bills that he was obliged to pay, and\nleft him scarcely enough to live upon. And he had used money that was\nnot his own--he would have to give an account of it in a day or two. He\nwas trying to borrow, but no one would lend him half what he needed----\"\n\n\"That's enough,\" Hilliard broke in, as her voice became inaudible.\n\n\"No, you ought to know more than I have told you. Of course he didn't\nask me for money; he had no idea that I could lend him even a pound.\nBut what I wish you to know is that he hadn't spoken to me again in the\nold way. He said he had done wrong, when he first came to know me; he\nbegged me to forgive him that, and only wanted me to be his friend.\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't be ungenerous: that's so unlike you.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean it ungenerously. In his position I should have done\nexactly as he did.\"\n\n\"Say you believe me. There was not a word of love between us. He told\nme all about the miseries of his life--that was all; and I pitied him\nso. I felt he was so sincere.\"\n\n\"I believe it perfectly.\"\n\n\"There was no excuse for what I did. How I had the courage--the\nshamelessness--is more than I can understand now.\"\n\nHilliard stirred himself, and tried to laugh.\n\n\"As it turned out, you couldn't have done better. Well, there's an end\nof it. Come.\"\n\nHe walked on, and Eve kept closely beside him, looking up into his face.\n\n\"I am sure he will pay the money back,\" she said presently.\n\n\"Hang the money!\"\n\nThen he stood still.\n\n\"How is he to pay it back? I mean, how is he to communicate with you?\"\n\n\"I gave him my address at Dudley.\"\n\nAgain Hilliard moved on.\n\n\"Why should it annoy you?\" Eve asked. \"If ever he writes to me, I shall\nlet you know at once: you shall see the letter. It is quite certain\nthat he _will_ pay his debt; and I shall be very glad when he does.\"\n\n\"What explanation did you give him?\"\n\n\"The true one. I said I had borrowed from a friend. He was in despair,\nand couldn't refuse what I offered.\"\n\n\"We'll talk no more of it. It was right to tell me. I'm glad now it's\nall over. Look at the moon rising--harvest moon, isn't it?\"\n\nEve turned aside again, and leaned on the parapet. He, lingering apart\nfor a moment, at length drew nearer. Of her own accord she put her\nhands in his.\n\n\"In future,\" she said, \"you shall know everything I do. You can trust\nme: there will be no more secrets.\"\n\n\"Yet you are afraid----\"\n\n\"It's for your sake. You must be free for the next year or two. I shall\nbe glad to get to work again. I am well and strong and cheerful.\"\n\nHer eyes drew him with the temptation he had ever yet resisted. Eve did\nnot refuse her lips.\n\n\"You must write to Patty,\" she said, when they were at the place of\nparting. \"I shall have her new address in a day or two.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will write to her.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nBy the end of November Hilliard was well at work in the office of\nMessrs. Birching, encouraged by his progress and looking forward as\nhopefully as a not very sanguine temperament would allow. He lived\npenuriously, and toiled at professional study night as well as day. Now\nand then he passed an evening with Robert Narramore, who had moved to\ncozy bachelor quarters a little distance out of town, in the Halesowen\ndirection. Once a week, generally on Saturday, he saw Eve. Other\nsociety he had none, nor greatly desired any.\n\nBut Eve had as yet found no employment. Good fortune in this respect\nseemed to have deserted her, and at her meetings with Hilliard she grew\nfretful over repeated disappointments. Of her day-to-day life she made\nno complaint, but Hilliard saw too clearly that her spirits were\nfailing beneath a burden of monotonous dulness. That the healthy glow\nshe had brought back in her cheeks should give way to pallor was no\nmore than he had expected, but he watched with anxiety the return of\nmental symptoms which he had tried to cheat himself into believing\nwould not reappear. Eve did not fail in pleasant smiles, in hopeful\nwords; but they cost her an effort which she lacked the art to conceal.\nHe felt a coldness in her, divined a struggle between conscience and\ninclination. However, for this also he was prepared; all the more need\nfor vigour and animation on his own part.\n\nHilliard had read of the woman who, in the strength of her love and\nloyalty, heartens a man through all the labours he must front he\nbelieved in her existence, but had never encountered her--as indeed\nvery few men have. From Eve he looked for nothing of the kind. If she\nwould permit herself to rest upon his sinews, that was all he desired.\nThe mood of their last night in Paris might perchance return, but only\nwith like conditions. Of his workaday passion she knew nothing; habit\nof familiarity and sense of obligation must supply its place with her\nuntil a brightening future once more set her emotions to the gladsome\ntune.\n\nNow that the days of sun and warmth were past, it was difficult to\narrange for a meeting under circumstances that allowed of free\ncomfortable colloquy. Eve declared that her father's house offered no\nsort of convenience; it was only a poor cottage, and Hilliard would be\naltogether out of place there. To his lodgings she could not come. Of\nnecessity they had recourse to public places in Birmingham, where an\nhour or two of talk under shelter might make Eve's journey hither worth\nwhile. As Hilliard lived at the north end of the town, he suggested\nAston Hall as a possible rendezvous, and here they met, early one\nSaturday afternoon in December.\n\nFrom the eminence which late years have encompassed with a proletarian\nsuburb, its once noble domain narrowed to the bare acres of a stinted\nbreathing ground, Aston Hall looks forth upon joyless streets and\nfuming chimneys, a wide welter of squalid strife. Its walls, which bear\nthe dints of Roundhead cannonade, are blackened with ever-driving\nsmoke; its crumbling gateway, opening aforetime upon a stately avenue\nof chestnuts, shakes as the steam-tram rushes by. Hilliard's\nimagination was both attracted and repelled by this relic of what he\ndeemed a better age. He enjoyed the antique chambers, the winding\nstaircases, the lordly gallery, with its dark old portraits and vast\nfireplaces, the dim-lighted nooks where one could hide alone and dream\naway the present; but in the end, reality threw scorn upon such\npleasure. Aston Hall was a mere architectural relic, incongruous and\nmeaningless amid its surroundings; the pathos of its desecrated dignity\nmade him wish that it might be destroyed, and its place fittingly\noccupied by some People's Palace, brand new, aglare with electric\nlight, ringing to the latest melodies of the street. When he had long\ngazed at its gloomy front, the old champion of royalism seemed to\nshrink together, humiliated by Time's insults.\n\nIt was raining when he met Eve at the entrance.\n\n\"This won't do,\" were his first words. \"You can't come over in such\nweather as this. If it hadn't seemed to be clearing tip an hour or two\nago, I should have telegraphed to stop you.\"\n\n\"Oh, the weather is nothing to me,\" Eve answered, with resolute gaiety.\n\"I'm only too glad of the change. Besides, it won't go on much longer.\nI shall get a place.\"\n\nHilliard never questioned her about her attempts to obtain an\nengagement; the subject was too disagreeable to him.\n\n\"Nothing yet,\" she continued, as they walked up the muddy roadway to\nthe Hall. \"But I know you don't like to talk about it.\"\n\n\"I have something to propose. How if I take a couple of cheap rooms in\nsome building let out for offices, and put in a few sticks of\nfurniture? Would you come to see me there?\"\n\nHe watched her face as she listened to the suggestion, and his timidity\nseemed justified by her expression.\n\n\"You would be so uncomfortable in such a place. Don't trouble. We shall\nmanage to meet somehow. I am certain to be living here before long.\"\n\n\"Even when you are,\" he persisted, \"we shall only be able to see each\nother in places like this. I can't talk--can't say half the things I\nwish to----\"\n\n\"We'll think about it. Ah, it's warm in here!\"\n\nThis afternoon the guardians of the Hall were likely to be troubled\nwith few visitors. Eve at once led the way upstairs to a certain suite\nof rooms, hung with uninteresting pictures, where she and Hilliard had\nbefore this spent an hour safe from disturbance. She placed herself in\nthe recess of a window: her companion took a few steps backward and\nforward.\n\n\"Let me do what I wish,\" he urged. \"There's a whole long winter before\nus. I am sure I could find a couple of rooms at a very low rent, and\nsome old woman would come in to do all that's necessary.\"\n\n\"If you like.\"\n\n\"I may? You would come there?\" he asked eagerly.\n\n\"Of course I would come. But I sha'n't like to see you in a bare,\ncomfortless place.\"\n\n\"It needn't be that. A few pounds will make a decent sort of\nsitting-room.\"\n\n\"Anything to tell me?\" Eve asked, abruptly quitting the subject.\n\nShe seemed to be in better spirits than of late, notwithstanding the\nevil sky; and Hilliard smiled with pleasure as he regarded her.\n\n\"Nothing unusual. Oh, yes; I'm forgetting. I had a letter from Emily,\nand went to see her.\"\n\nHilliard had scarcely seen his quondam sister-in-law since she became\nMrs. Marr. On the one occasion of his paying a call, after his return\nfrom Paris, it struck him that her husband offered no very genial\nwelcome. He had expected this, and willingly kept aloof.\n\n\"Read the letter.\"\n\nEve did so. It began, \"My dear Maurice,\" and ended, \"Ever\naffectionately and gratefully yours.\" The rest of its contents ran thus:\n\n\"I am in great trouble--dreadfully unhappy. It would be such a kindness\nif you would let me see you. I can't put in a letter what I want to\nsay, and I do hope you won't refuse to come. Friday afternoon, at\nthree, would do, if you can get away from business for once. How I look\nback on the days when you used to come over from Dudley and have tea\nwith us in the dear little room. Do come!\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Hilliard, laughing as he met Eve's surprised look. \"I\nknew what _that_ meant. I would much rather have got out of it, but it\nwould have seemed brutal. So I went. The poor simpleton has begun to\nfind that marriage with one man isn't necessarily the same thing as\nmarriage with another. In Ezra Marr she has caught a Tartar.\"\n\n\"Surely he doesn't ill-use her?\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it. He is simply a man with a will, and finds it\nnecessary to teach his wife her duties. Emily knows no more about the\nduties of life than her little five-year-old girl. She thought she\ncould play with a second husband as she did with the first, and she was\ngravely mistaken. She complained to me of a thousand acts of\ntyranny--every one of them, I could see, merely a piece of rude\ncommonsense. The man must be calling himself an idiot for marrying her.\nI could only listen with a long face. Argument with Emily is out of the\nquestion. And I shall take good care not to go there again.\"\n\nEve asked many questions, and approved his resolve.\n\n\"You are not the person to console and instruct her. But she must look\nupon you as the best and wisest of men. I can understand that.\"\n\n\"You can understand poor, foolish Emily thinking so----\"\n\n\"Put all the meaning you like into my words,\" said Eve, with her\npleasantest smile. \"Well, I too have had a letter. From Patty. She\nisn't going to be married, after all.\"\n\n\"Why, I thought it was over by now.\"\n\n\"She broke it off less than a week before the day. I wish I could show\nyou her letter, but, of course, I mustn't. It's very amusing. They had\nquarrelled about every conceivable thing--all but one, and this came up\nat last. They were talking about meals, and Mr. Dally said that he\nliked a bloater for breakfast every morning. 'A bloater!' cried Patty.\n'Then I hope you won't ask me to cook it for you. I can't bear them.'\n'Oh, very well: if you can't cook a bloater, you're not the wife for\nme.' And there they broke off, for good and all.\"\n\n\"Which means for a month or two, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Impossible to say. But I have advised her as strongly as I could not\nto marry until she knows her own mind better. It is too bad of her to\nhave gone so far. The poor man had taken rooms, and all but furnished\nthem. Patty's a silly girl, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"Wants a strong man to take her in hand--like a good many other girls.\"\n\nEve paid no attention to the smile.\n\n\"Paris spoilt her for such a man as Mr. Dally. She got all sorts of new\nideas, and can't settle down to the things that satisfied her before.\nIt isn't nice to think that perhaps we did her a great deal of harm.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! Nobody was ever harmed by healthy enjoyment.\"\n\n\"Was it healthy--for _her_? That's the question.\"\n\nHilliard mused, and felt disinclined to discuss the matter.\n\n\"That isn't the only news I have for you,\" said Eve presently. \"I've\nhad another letter.\"\n\nHer voice arrested Hilliard's step as he paced near her.\n\n\"I had rather not have told you anything about it, but I promised. And\nI have to give you something.\"\n\nShe held out to him a ten-pound note.\n\n\"What's this?\"\n\n\"He has sent it. He says he shall be able to pay something every three\nmonths until he has paid the whole debt. Please to take it.\"\n\nAfter a short struggle with himself, Hilliard recovered a manly bearing.\n\n\"It's quite right he should return the money, Eve, but you mustn't ask\nme to have anything to do with it. Use it for your own expenses. I gave\nit to you, and I can't take it back.\"\n\nShe hesitated, her eyes cast down,\n\n\"He has written a long letter. There's not a word in it I should be\nafraid to show you. Will you read it--just to satisfy me? Do read it!\"\n\nHilliard steadily refused, with perfect self-command.\n\n\"I trust you--that's enough. I have absolute faith in you. Answer his\nletter in the way you think best, and never speak to me of the money\nagain. It's yours; make what use of it you like.\"\n\n\"Then I shall use it,\" said Eve, after a pause, \"to pay for a lodging\nin Birmingham. I couldn't live much longer at home. If I'm here, I can\nget books out of the library, and time won't drag so. And I shall be\nnear you.\"\n\n\"Do so, by all means.\"\n\nAs if more completely to dismiss the unpleasant subject, they walked\ninto another room. Hilliard began to speak again of his scheme for\nproviding a place where they could meet and talk at their ease. Eve now\nentered into it with frank satisfaction.\n\n\"Have you said anything yet to Mr. Narramore?\" she asked at length.\n\n\"No. I have never felt inclined to tell him. Of course I shall some\nday. But it isn't natural to me to talk of this kind of thing, even\nwith so intimate a friend. Some men couldn't keep it to themselves: for\nme the difficulty is to speak.\"\n\n\"I asked again, because I have been thinking--mightn't Mr. Narramore be\nable to help me to get work?\"\n\nHilliard repelled the suggestion with strong distaste. On no account\nwould he seek his friend's help in such a matter. And Eve said no more\nof it.\n\nOn her return journey to Dudley, between eight and nine o'clock, she\nlooked cold and spiritless. Her eyelids dropped wearily as she sat in\nthe corner of the carriage with some papers on her lap, which Hilliard\nhad given her. Rain had ceased, and the weather seemed turning to\nfrost. From Dudley station she had a walk of nearly half an hour, to\nthe top of Kate's Hill.\n\nKate's Hill is covered with an irregular assemblage of old red-tiled\ncottages, grimy without, but sometimes, as could be seen through an\nopen door admitting into the chief room, clean and homely-looking\nwithin. The steep, narrow alleys leading upward were scarce lighted;\nhere and there glimmered a pale corner-lamp, but on a black night such\nas this the oil-lit windows of a little shop, and the occasional gleam\nfrom doors, proved very serviceable as a help in picking one's path.\nTowards the top of the hill there was no paving, and mud lay thick.\nIndescribable the confusion of this toilers' settlement--houses and\nworkshops tumbled together as if by chance, the ways climbing and\nwinding into all manner of pitch-dark recesses, where eats prowled\nstealthily. In one spot silence and not a hint of life; in another,\nchildren noisily at play amid piles of old metal or miscellaneous\nrubbish. From the labyrinth which was so familiar to her, Eve issued of\na sudden on to a sort of terrace, where the air blew shrewdly: beneath\nlay cottage roofs, and in front a limitless gloom, which by daylight\nwould have been an extensive northward view, comprising the towns of\nBilston and Wolverhampton. It was now a black gulf, without form and\nvoid, sputtering fire. Flames that leapt out of nothing, and as\nsuddenly disappeared; tongues of yellow or of crimson, quivering,\nlambent, seeming to snatch and devour and then fall back in satiety.\nWhen a cluster of these fires shot forth together, the sky above became\nillumined with a broad glare, which throbbed and pulsed in the manner\nof sheet-lightning, though more lurid, and in a few seconds was gone.\n\nShe paused here for a moment, rather to rest after her climb than to\nlook at what she had seen so often, then directed her steps to one of\nthe houses within sight. She pushed the door, and entered a little\nparlour, where a fire and a lamp made cheery welcome. By the hearth, in\na round-backed wooden chair, sat a grizzle-headed man, whose hard\nfeatures proclaimed his relation to Eve, otherwise seeming so\nimprobable. He looked up from the volume open on his knee--a Bible--and\nsaid in a rough, kind voice:\n\n\"I was thinkin' it 'ud be about toime for you. You look starved, my\nlass.\"\n\n\"Yes; it has turned very cold.\"\n\n\"I've got a bit o' supper ready for you. I don't want none myself;\nthere's food enough for me _here_.\" He laid his hand on the book.\n\"D'you call to mind the eighteenth of Ezekiel, lass?--'But if the\nwicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed----'\"\n\nEve stood motionless till he had read the verse, then nodded and began\nto take off her out-of-door garments. She was unable to talk, and her\neyes wandered absently.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nAfter a week's inquiry, Hilliard discovered the lodging that would suit\nhis purpose. It was Camp Hill; two small rooms at the top of a house,\nthe ground-floor of which was occupied as a corn-dealer's shop, and the\nstory above that tenanted by a working optician with a blind wife. On\ncondition of papering the rooms and doing a few repairs necessary to\nmake them habitable, he secured them at the low rent of four shillings\na week.\n\nEve paid her first visit to this delectable abode on a Sunday\nafternoon; she saw only the sitting-room, which would bear inspection;\nthe appearance of the bed-room was happily left to her surmise. Less\nthan a five-pound note had paid for the whole furnishing.\nNotwithstanding the reckless invitation to Eve to share his fortunes\nstraightway, Hilliard, after paving his premium of fifty guineas to the\nBirching Brothers, found but a very small remnant in hand of the money\nwith which he had set forth from Dudley some nine months ago. Yet not\nfor a moment did he repine; he had the value of his outlay; his mind\nwas stored with memories and his heart strengthened with hope.\n\nAt her second coming--she herself now occupied a poor little lodging\nnot very far away--Eve beheld sundry improvements. By the fireside\nstood a great leather chair, deep, high-backed, wondrously\nself-assertive over against the creaky cane seat which before had\ndominated the room. Against the wall was a high bookcase, where\nHilliard's volumes, previously piled on the floor, stood in loose\narray; and above the mantelpiece hung a framed engraving of the\nParthenon.\n\n\"This is dreadful extravagance!\" she exclaimed, pausing at the\nthreshold, and eying her welcomer with mock reproof.\n\n\"It is, but not on my part. The things came a day or two ago, simply\naddressed to me from shops.\"\n\n\"Who was the giver, then?\"\n\n\"Must be Narramore, of course. He was here not long ago, and growled a\ngood deal because I hadn't a decent chair for his lazy bones.\"\n\n\"I am much obliged to him,\" said Eve, as she sank back in the seat of\nluxurious repose. \"You ought to hang his portrait in the room. Haven't\nyou a photograph?\" she added carelessly.\n\n\"Such a thing doesn't exist. Like myself, he hasn't had a portrait\ntaken since he was a child. A curious thing, by-the-bye, that you\nshould have had yours taken just when you did. Of course it was because\nyou were going far away for the first time; but it marked a point in\nyour life, and put on record the Eve Madeley whom no one would see\nagain If I can't get that photograph in any other way I shall go and\nbuy, beg, or steal it from Mrs. Brewer.\"\n\n\"Oh, you shall have one if you insist upon it.\"\n\n\"Why did you refuse it before?\"\n\n\"I hardly know--a fancy--I thought you would keep looking at it, and\nregretting that I had changed so.\"\n\nAs on her previous visit, she soon ceased to talk, and, in listening to\nHilliard, showed unconsciously a tired, despondent face.\n\n\"Nothing yet,\" fell from her lips, when he had watched her silently.\n\n\"Never mind; I hate the mention of it.\"\n\n\"By-the-bye,\" he resumed, \"Narramore astounded me by hinting at\nmarriage. It's Miss Birching, the sister of my man. It hasn't come to\nan engagement yet, and if it ever does I shall give Miss Birching the\ncredit for it. It would have amused you to hear him talking about her,\nwith a pipe in his mouth and half asleep. I understand now why he took\nyoung Birching with him to Switzerland. He'll never carry it through;\nunless, as I said, Miss Birching takes the decisive step.\"\n\n\"Is she the kind of girl to do that?\" asked Eve, waking to curiosity.\n\n\"I know nothing about her, except from Narramore's sleepy talk. Rather\nan arrogant beauty, according to him. He told me a story of how, when\nhe was calling upon her, she begged him to ring the bell for something\nor other, and he was so slow in getting up that she went and rang it\nherself. 'Her own fault,' he said; 'she asked me to sit on a chair with\na seat some six inches above the ground, and how can a man hurry up\nfrom a thing of that sort?'\"\n\n\"He must be a strange man. Of course he doesn't care anything about\nMiss Birching.\"\n\n\"But I think he does, in his way.\"\n\n\"How did he ever get on at all in business?\"\n\n\"Oh, he's one of the lucky men.\" Hilliard replied, with a touch of\ngood-natured bitterness. \"He never exerted himself; good things fell\ninto his mouth. People got to like him--that's one explanation, no\ndoubt.\"\n\n\"Don't you think he may have more energy than you imagine?\"\n\n\"It's possible. I have sometimes wondered.\"\n\n\"What sort of life does he lead? Has he many friends I mean?\"\n\n\"Very few. I should doubt whether there's anyone he talks with as he\ndoes with me. He'll never get much good out of his money; but if he\nfell into real poverty--poverty like mine--it would kill him. I know he\nlooks at me as an astonishing creature, and marvels that I don't buy a\ngood dose of chloral and have done with it.\"\n\nEve did not join in his laugh.\n\n\"I can't bear to hear you speak of your poverty,\" she said in an\nundertone. \"You remind me that I am the cause of it.\"\n\n\"Good Heavens! As if I should mention it if I were capable of such a\nthought!\"\n\n\"But it's the fact,\" she persisted, with something like irritation.\n\"But for me, you would have gone into the architect's office with\nenough to live upon comfortably for a time.\"\n\n\"That's altogether unlikely,\" Hilliard declared. \"But for you, it's\nimprobable that I should have gone to Birching's at all. At this moment\nI should be spending my money in idleness, and, in the end, should have\ngone back to what I did before. You have given me a start in a new\nlife.\"\n\nThis, and much more of the same tenor, failed to bring a light upon\nEve's countenance. At length she asked suddenly, with a defiant\nbluntness----\n\n\"Have you ever thought what sort of a wife I am likely to make?\"\n\nHilliard tried to laugh, but was disagreeably impressed by her words\nand the look that accompanied them.\n\n\"I have thought about it, to be sure,\" he answered carelessly\n\n\"And don't you feel a need of courage?\"\n\n\"Of course. And not only the need but the courage itself.\"\n\n\"Tell me the real, honest truth.\" She bent forward, and gazed at him\nwith eyes one might have thought hostile. \"I demand the truth of you: I\nhave a right to know it. Don't you often wish you had never seen me?\"\n\n\"You 're in a strange mood.\"\n\n\"Don't put me off. Answer!\"\n\n\"To ask such a question,\" he replied quietly, \"is to charge me with a\ngreat deal of hypocrisy. I did _once_ all but wish I had never seen\nyou. If I lost you now I should lose what seems to me the strongest\ndesire of my life. Do you suppose I sit down and meditate on your\ncapacity as cook or housemaid? It would be very prudent and laudable,\nbut I have other thoughts--that give me trouble enough.\"\n\n\"What thoughts?\"\n\n\"Such as one doesn't talk about--if you insist on frankness.\"\n\nHer eyes wandered.\n\n\"It's only right to tell you,\" she said, after silence, \"that I dread\npoverty as much as ever I did. And I think poverty in marriage a\nthousand times worse than when one is alone.\"\n\n\"Well, we agree in that. But why do you insist upon it just now? Are\n_you_ beginning to be sorry that we ever met?\"\n\n\"Not a day passes but I feel sorry for it.\"\n\n\"I suppose you are harping on the old scruple. Why will you plague me\nabout it?\"\n\n\"I mean,\" said Eve, with eyes down, \"that you are the worse off for\nhaving met me, but I mean something else as well. Do you think it\npossible that anyone can owe too much gratitude, even to a person one\nlikes?\"\n\nHe regarded her attentively.\n\n\"You feel the burden?\"\n\nShe delayed her answer, glancing at him with a new expression--a\ndeprecating tenderness.\n\n\"It's better to tell you. I _do_ feel it, and have always felt it.\"\n\n\"Confound this infernal atmosphere!\" Hilliard broke out wrathfully.\n\"It's making you morbid again. Come here to me! Eve--come!\"\n\nAs she sat motionless, he caught her hands and drew her forward, and\nsat down again with her passive body resting upon his knees. She was\npale, and looked frightened.\n\n\"Your gratitude be hanged! Pay me back with your lips--so--and so!\nCan't you understand that when my lips touch yours, I have a delight\nthat would be well purchased with years of semi-starvation? What is it\nto me how I won you? You are mine for good and all--that's enough.\"\n\nShe drew herself half away, and stood brightly flushed, touching her\nhair to set it in order again. Hilliard, with difficulty controlling\nhimself, said in a husky voice--\n\n\"Is the mood gone?\"\n\nEve nodded, and sighed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nAt the time appointed for their next meeting, Hilliard waited in vain.\nAn hour passed, and Eve, who had the uncommon virtue of punctuality,\nstill did not come. The weather was miserable--rain, fog, and\nslush--but this had heretofore proved no obstacle, for her lodgings\nwere situated less than half a mile away. Afraid of missing her if he\nwent out, he fretted through another hour, and was at length relieved\nby the arrival of a letter of explanation. Eve wrote that she had been\nsummoned to Dudley; her father was stricken with alarming illness, and\nher brother had telegraphed.\n\nFor two days he heard nothing; then came a few lines which told him\nthat Mr. Madeley could not live many more hours. On the morrow Eve\nwrote that her father was dead.\n\nTo the letter which he thereupon despatched Hilliard had no reply for\nnearly a week. When Eve wrote, it was from a new address at Dudley.\nAfter thanking him for the kind words with which he had sought to\ncomfort her, she continued--\n\n\"I have at last found something to do, and it was quite time, for I\nhave been very miserable, and work is the best thing for me. Mr.\nWelland, my first employer, when I was twelve years old, has asked me\nto come and keep his books for him, and I am to live in his house. My\nbrother has gone into lodgings, and we see no more of the cottage on\nKate's Hill. It's a pity I have to be so far from you again, but there\nseems to be no hope of getting anything to do in Birmingham, and here I\nshall be comfortable enough, as far as mere living goes. On Sunday I\nshall be quite free, and will come over as often as possible; but I\nhave caught a bad cold, and must be content to keep in the house until\nthis dreadful weather changes. Be more careful of yourself than you\ngenerally are, and let me hear often. In a few months' time we shall be\nable to spend pleasant hours on the Castle Hill. I have heard from\nPatty, and want to tell you about her letter, but this cold makes me\nfeel too stupid Will write again soon.\"\n\nIt happened that Hilliard himself was just now blind and voiceless with\na catarrh. The news from Dudley by no means solaced him. He crouched\nover his fire through the long, black day, tormented with many\nmiseries, and at eventide drank half a bottle of whisky, piping hot,\nwhich at least assured him of a night's sleep.\n\nJust to see what would be the result of his silence, he wrote no reply\nto this letter. A fortnight elapsed; he strengthened himself in\nstubbornness, aided by the catarrh, which many bottles of whisky would\nnot overcome. When his solitary confinement grew at length\ninsufferable, he sent for Narramore, and had not long to wait before\nhis friend appeared. Narramore was rosy as ever: satisfaction with life\nbeamed from his countenance.\n\n\"I've ordered you in some wine,\" he exclaimed genially, sinking into\nthe easy-chair which Hilliard had vacated for him--an instance of\nselfishness in small things which did not affect his generosity in\ngreater. \"It isn't easy to get good port nowadays, but they tell me\nthat this is not injurious. Hasn't young Birching been to see you? No,\nI suppose he would think it _infra dig_. to come to this neighbourhood.\nThere's a damnable self-conceit in that family: you must have noticed\nit, eh? It comes out very strongly in the girl. By-the-bye I've done\nwith her--haven't been there for three weeks, and don't think I shall\ngo again, unless it's for the pleasure of saying or doing something\nthat'll irritate her royal highness.\"\n\n\"Did you quarrel?\"\n\n\"Quarrel? I never quarrel with anyone; it's bad for one's nerves.\"\n\n\"Did you get as far as proposing?\"\n\n\"Oh, I left _her_ to do that. Women are making such a row about their\nrights nowadays, that it's as well to show you grant them perfect\nequality. I gave her every chance of saying something definite. I\nmaintain that she trifled with my affections. She asked me what my\nviews in life were. Ah, thought I, now it's coming; and I answered\nmodestly that everything depended on circumstances. I might have said\nit depended on the demand for brass bedsteads; but perhaps that would\nhave verged on indelicacy--you know that I am delicacy personified. 'I\nthought,' said Miss Birching, 'that a man of any energy made his own\ncircumstances?' 'Energy!' I shouted. 'Do you look for energy in _me_?\nIt's the greatest compliment anyone ever paid me.' At that she seemed\ndesperately annoyed, and wouldn't pursue the subject. That's how it\nalways was, just when the conversation grew interesting.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry to see you so cut up about it,\" remarked Hilliard.\n\n\"None of your irony, old fellow. Well, the truth is, I've seen someone\nI like better.\"\n\n\"Not surprised.\"\n\n\"It's a queer story; I'll tell it you some day, if it comes to\nanything. I'm not at all sure that it will, as there seems to be a sort\nof lurking danger that I may make a damned fool of myself.\"\n\n\"Improbable?\" commented the listener. \"Your blood is too temperate.\"\n\n\"So I thought; but one never knows. Unexpected feelings crop up in a\nfellow. We won't talk about it just now. How have things been going in\nthe architectural line?\"\n\n\"Not amiss. Steadily, I think.\"\n\nNarramore lay back at full length, his face turned to the ceiling.\n\n\"Since I've been living out yonder, I've got a taste for the country. I\nhave a notion that, if brass bedsteads keep firm, I shall some day\nbuild a little house of my own; an inexpensive little house, with a\ntree or two about it. Just make me a few sketches, will you? When\nyou've nothing better to do, you know.\"\n\nHe played with the idea, till it took strong hold of him, and he began\nto talk with most unwonted animation.\n\n\"Five or six thousand pounds--I ought to be able to sink that in a few\nyears. Not enough, eh? But I don't want a mansion. I'm quite serious\nabout this, Hilliard. When you re feeling ready to start on your own\naccount, you shall have the job.\"\n\nHilliard laughed grimly at the supposition that he would ever attain\nprofessional independence, but his friend talked on, and overleaped\ndifficulties with a buoyancy of spirit which ultimately had its effect\nupon the listener. When he was alone again, Hilliard felt better, both\nin body and mind, and that evening, over the first bottle of\nNarramore's port, he amused himself with sketching ideal cottages.\n\n\"The fellow's in love, at last. When a man thinks of pleasant little\ncountry houses, 'with a tree or two' about them----\"\n\nHe sighed, and ground his teeth, and sketched on.\n\nBefore bedtime, a sudden and profound shame possessed him. Was he not\nbehaving outrageously in neglecting to answer Eve's letter? For all he\nknew the cold of which she complained might have caused her more\nsuffering than he himself had gone through from the like cause, and\nthat was bad enough. He seized paper and wrote to her as he had never\nwritten before, borne on the very high flood of passionate longing.\nWithout regard to prudence he left the house at midnight and posted his\nletter.\n\n\"It never occurred to me to blame you for not writing,\" Eve quickly\nreplied; \"I'm afraid you are more sensitive than I am, and, to tell the\ntruth, I believe men generally _are_ more sensitive than women in\nthings of this kind. It pleased me very much to hear of the visit you\nhad had from Mr. Narramore, and that he had cheered you. I do so wish I\ncould have come, but I have really been quite ill, and I must not think\nof risking a journey till the weather improves. Don't trouble about it;\nI will write often.\"\n\n\"I told you about a letter I had had from poor Patty, and I want to ask\nyou to do something. Will you write to her? Just a nice, friendly\nlittle letter. She would be so delighted, she would indeed. There's no\nharm in copying a line or two from what she sent me. 'Has Mr. Hilliard\nforgotten all about me?' she says. 'I would write to him, but I feel\nafraid. Not afraid of _you_, dear Eve, but he might feel I was\nimpertinent. What do you think? We had such delicious times together,\nhe and you and I, and I really don't want him to forget me altogether?'\nNow I have told her that there is no fear whatever of your forgetting\nher, and that we often speak of her. I begin to think that I have been\nunjust to Patty in calling her silly, and making fun of her. She was\nanything but foolish in breaking off with that absurd Mr. Dally, and I\ncan see now that she will never give a thought to him again. What I\nfear is that the poor girl will never find any one good enough for her.\nThe men she meets are very vulgar, and vulgar Patty is _not_--as you\nonce said to me, you remember. So, if you can spare a minute, write her\na few lines, to show that you still think of her. Her address is----,\netc.\"\n\nTo Hilliard all this seemed merely a pleasant proof of Eve's\namiability, of her freedom from that acrid monopolism which\ncharacterises the ignoble female in her love relations. Straightway he\ndid as he was requested, and penned to Miss Ringrose a chatty epistle,\nwith which she could not but be satisfied. A day or two brought him an\nanswer. Patty's handwriting lacked distinction, and in the matter of\northography she was not beyond reproach, but her letter chirped with a\nprettily expressed gratitude. \"I am living with my aunt, and am likely\nto for a long time. And I get on very well at my new shop, which I have\nno wish to leave.\" This was her only allusion to the shattered\nmatrimonial project: \"I wish there was any chance of you and Eve coming\nto live in London, but I suppose that's too good to hope for. We don't\nget many things as we wish them in this world. And yet I oughtn't to\nsay that either, for if it hadn't been for you I should never have seen\nParis, which was so awfully jolly! But you'll be coming for a holiday,\nwon't you? I should so like just to see you, if ever you do. It isn't\nlike it was at the old shop. There's a great deal of business done\nhere, and very little time to talk to anyone in the shop. But many\ngirls have worse things to put up with than I have, and I won't make\nyou think I'm a grumbler.\"\n\nThe whole of January went by before Hilliard and Eve again saw each\nother. The lover wrote at length that he could bear it no longer, that\nhe was coming to Dudley, if only for the mere sight of Eve's face; she\nmust meet him in the waiting-room at the railway station. She answered\nby return of post, \"I will come over next Sunday, and be with you at\ntwelve o'clock, but I must leave very early, as I am afraid to be out\nafter nightfall.\" And this engagement was kept.\n\nThe dress of mourning became her well; it heightened her always\nnoticeable air of refinement, and would have constrained to a\nreverential tenderness even had not Hilliard naturally checked himself\nfrom any bolder demonstration of joy. She spoke in a low, soft voice,\nseldom raised her eyes, and manifested a new gentleness very touching\nto Hilliard, though at the same time, and he knew not how or why, it\ndid not answer to his desire. A midday meal was in readiness for her;\nshe pretended to eat, but in reality scarce touched the food.\n\n\"You must taste old Narramore's port wine,\" said her entertainer. \"The\nfellow actually sent a couple of dozen.\"\n\nShe was not to be persuaded; her refusal puzzled and annoyed Hilliard,\nand there followed a long silence. Indeed, it surprised him to find how\nlittle they could say to each other to-day. An unknown restraint had\ncome between them.\n\n\"Well,\" he exclaimed at length, \"I wrote to Patty, and she answered.\"\n\n\"May I see the letter?\"\n\n\"Of course. Here it is.\"\n\nEve read it, and smiled with pleasure.\n\n\"Doesn't she write nicely! Poor girl!\"\n\n\"Why have you taken so to commiserating her all at once?\" Hilliard\nasked. \"She's no worse off than she ever was. Rather better, I think.\"\n\n\"Life isn't the same for her since she was in Paris,\" said Eve, with\npeculiar softness.\n\n\"Well, perhaps it improved her.\"\n\n\"Oh, it certainly did! But it gave her a feeling of discontent for the\nold life and the people about her.\"\n\n\"A good many of us have to suffer that. She's nothing like as badly off\nas you are, my dear girl.\"\n\nEve coloured, and kept silence.\n\n\"We shall hear of her getting married before long,\" resumed the other.\n\"She told me herself that marriage was the scourge of music-shops--it\ncarries off their young women at such a rate.\"\n\n\"She told you that? It was in one of your long talks together in\nLondon? Patty and you got on capitally together. It was very natural\nshe shouldn't care much for men like Mr. Dally afterwards.\"\n\nHilliard puzzled over this remark, and was on the point of making some\nimpatient reply, but discretion restrained him. He turned to Eve's own\naffairs, questioned her closely about her life in the tradesman's\nhouse, and so their conversation followed a smoother course. Presently,\nhalf in jest, Hilliard mentioned Narramore's building projects.\n\n\"But who knows? It _might_ come to something of importance for me. In\ntwo or three years, if all goes well, such a thing might possibly give\nme a start.\"\n\nA singular solemnity had settled upon Eve's countenance. She spoke not\na word, and seemed unaccountably ill at ease.\n\n\"Do you think I am in the clouds?\" said Hilliard.\n\n\"Oh, no! Why shouldn't you get on--as other men do?\"\n\nBut she would not dwell upon the hope, and Hilliard, not a little\nvexed, again became silent.\n\nHer next visit was after a lapse of three weeks. She had again been\nsuffering from a slight illness, and her pallor alarmed Hilliard. Again\nshe began with talk of Patty Ringrose.\n\n\"Do you know, there's really a chance that we may see her before long!\nShe'll have a holiday at Easter, from the Thursday night to Monday\nnight, and I have all but got her to promise that she'll come over\nhere. Wouldn't it be fun to let her see the Black Country? You remember\nher talk about it. I could get her a room, and if it's at all bearable\nweather, we would all have a day somewhere. Wouldn't you like that?\"\n\n\"Yes; but I should greatly prefer a day with you alone.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course, the time is coming for that, Would you let us come here\none day?\"\n\nWith a persistence not to be mistaken Eve avoided all intimate topics;\nat the same time her manner grew more cordial. Through February and\nMarch, she decidedly improved in health. Hilliard saw her seldom, but\nshe wrote frequent letters, and their note was as that of her\nconversation, lively, all but sportive. Once again she had become a\nmystery to her lover; he pondered over her very much as in the days\nwhen they were newly acquainted. Of one thing he felt but too well\nassured. She did not love him as he desired to be loved. Constant she\nmight be, but it was the constancy of a woman unaffected with ardent\nemotion. If she granted him her lips they had no fervour respondent to\nhis own; she made a sport of it, forgot it as soon as possible. Upon\nHilliard's vehement nature this acted provocatively; at times he was\nall but frenzied with the violence of his sensual impulses. Yet Eve's\ncontrol of him grew more assured the less she granted of herself; a\nlook, a motion of her lips, and he drew apart, quivering but subdued.\nAt one such moment he exclaimed:\n\n\"You had better not come here at all. I love you too insanely.\"\n\nEve looked at him, and silently began to shed tears. He implored her\npardon, prostrated himself, behaved in a manner that justified his\nwarning. But Eve stifled the serious drama of the situation, and forced\nhim to laugh with her.\n\nIn these days architectural study made little way.\n\nPatty Ringrose was coming for the Easter holidays. She would arrive on\nGood Friday. \"As the weather is so very bad still,\" wrote Eve to\nHilliard, \"will you let us come to see you on Saturday? Sunday may be\nbetter for an excursion of some sort.\"\n\nAnd thus it was arranged. Hilliard made ready his room to receive the\nfair visitors, who would come at about eleven in the morning. As usual\nnowadays, he felt discontented, but, after all, Patty's influence might\nbe a help to him, as it had been in worse straits.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nTo-day he had the house to himself. The corn-dealers shop was closed,\nas on a Sunday; the optician and his blind wife had locked up their\nrooms and were spending Easter-tide, it might be hoped, amid more\ncheerful surroundings. Hilliard sat with his door open, that he might\neasily hear the knock which announced his guests at the entrance below.\n\nIt sounded, at length, but timidly. Had he not been listening, he would\nnot have perceived it. Eve's handling of the knocker was firmer than\nthat, and in a different rhythm. Apprehensive of disappointment, he\nhurried downstairs and opened the door to Patty Ringrose--Patty alone.\n\nWith a shy but pleased laugh, her cheeks warm and her eyes bright, she\njerked out her hand to him as in the old days.\n\n\"I know you won't be glad to see me. I'm so sorry. I said I had better\nnot come.\"\n\n\"Of course I am glad to see you. But where's Eve?\"\n\n\"It's so unfortunate--she has such a bad headache!\" panted the girl.\n\"She couldn't possibly come, and I wanted to stay with her, I said. I\nshould only disappoint you.\"\n\n\"It's a pity, of course; but I'm glad you came, for all that.\" Hilliard\nstifled his dissatisfaction and misgivings. \"You'll think this a queer\nsort of place. I'm quite alone here to-day. But after you have rested a\nlittle we can go somewhere else.\"\n\n\"Yes. Eve told me you would be so kind as to take me to see things. I'm\nnot tired. I won't come in, if you'd rather----\"\n\n\"Oh, you may as well see what sort of a den I've made for myself.\"\n\nHe led the way upstairs. When she reached the top, Patty was again\nbreathless, the result of excitement more than exertion. She exclaimed\nat sight of the sitting-room. How cosy it was! What a scent from the\nflowers! Did he always buy flowers for his room? No doubt it was to\nplease Eve. What a comfortable chair! Of course Eve always sat in this\nchair?\n\nThen her babbling ceased, and she looked up at Hilliard, who stood over\nagainst her, with nervous delight. He could perceive no change whatever\nin her, except that she was better dressed than formerly. Not a day\nseemed to have been added to her age; her voice had precisely the\nintonations that he remembered. After all, it was little more than half\na year since they were together in Paris; but to Hilliard the winter\nhad seemed of interminable length, and he expected to find Miss\nRingrose a much altered person.\n\n\"When did this headache begin?\" he inquired, trying to speak without\nover-much concern.\n\n\"She had a little yesterday, when she met me at the station. I didn't\nthink she was looking at all well.\"\n\n\"I'm surprised to hear that. She looked particularly well when I saw\nher last. Had you any trouble in making your way here?\"\n\n\"Oh, not a bit. I found the tram, just as Eve told me. But I'm so\nsorry! And a fine day too! You don't often have fine days here, do you,\nMr. Hilliard?\"\n\n\"Now and then. So you've seen Dudley at last. What do you think of it?\"\n\n\"Oh, I like it! I shouldn't mind living there a bit. But of course I\nlike Birmingham better.\"\n\n\"Almost as fine as Paris, isn't it?\"\n\n\"You don't mean that, of course. But I've only seen a few of the\nstreets, and most of the shops are shut up to-day. Isn't it a pity Eve\nhas to live so far off? Though, of course, it isn't really very\nfar--and I suppose you see each other often?\"\n\nHilliard took a seat, crossed his legs, and grasped his knee. The girl\nappeared to wait for an answer to her last words, but he said nothing,\nand stared at the floor.\n\n\"If it's fine to-morrow,\" Patty continued, after observing him\nfurtively, \"are you coming to Dudley?\"\n\n\"Yes, I shall come over. Did she send any message?\"\n\n\"No--nothing particular----\"\n\nPatty looked confused, stroked her dress, and gave a little cough.\n\n\"But if it rains--as it very likely will--there's no use in my coming.\"\n\n\"No, she said not.\"\n\n\"Or if her headache is still troubling her----\"\n\n\"Let's hope it will be better. But--in any case, she'll be able to come\nwith me to Birmingham on Monday, when I go back I must be home again on\nMonday night.\"\n\n\"Don't you think,\" said Hilliard carelessly, \"that Eve would rather\nhave you to herself, just for the short time you are here?\"\n\nPatty made vigorous objection.\n\n\"I don't think that at all. It's quite settled that you are to come\nover to-morrow, if it's fine. Oh, and I _do_ hope it will be! It would\nbe so dreadful to be shut up in the house all day at Dudley. How very\nawkward that there's no place where she can have you there! If it\nrains, hadn't we better come here? I'm sure it would be better for Eve.\nShe seems to get into such low spirits--just like she was sometimes in\nLondon.\"\n\n\"That's quite news to me,\" said the listener gravely.\n\n\"Doesn't she let you know? Then I'm so sorry I mentioned it. You won't\ntell her I said anything?\"\n\n\"Wait a moment. Does she say that she is often in low spirits?\"\n\nPatty faltered, stroking her dress with the movement of increasing\nnervousness.\n\n\"It's better I should know,\" Hilliard added, \"I'm afraid she keeps all\nthis from me. For several weeks I have thought her in particularly good\nhealth.\"\n\n\"But she tells me just the opposite. She says----\"\n\n\"Says what?\"\n\n\"Perhaps it's only the place that doesn't agree with her. I don't think\nDudley is _very_ healthy, do you?\"\n\n\"I never heard of doctors sending convalescents there. But Eve must be\nsuffering from some other cause, I think. Does it strike you that she\nis at all like what she used to be when--when you felt so anxious about\nher?\"\n\nHe met the girl's eyes, and saw them expand in alarm.\n\n\"I didn't think--I didn't mean----\" she stammered.\n\n\"No, but I have a reason for asking. Is it so or not?\"\n\n\"Don't frighten me, Mr. Hilliard! I do so wish I hadn't said anything.\nShe isn't in good health, that's all. How can you think----? That was\nall over long ago. And she would never--I'm _sure_ she wouldn't, after\nall you've done for her.\"\n\nHilliard ground the carpet with his foot, and all but uttered a violent\nejaculation.\n\n\"I know she is all gratitude,\" were the words that became audible.\n\n\"She is indeed!\" urged Patty. \"She says that--even if she wished--she\ncould never break off with you; as I am _sure_ she would never wish!\"\n\n\"Ah! that's what she says,\" murmured the other. And abruptly he rose.\n\"There's no use in talking about this. You are here for a holiday, and\nnot to be bored with other people's troubles. The sun is trying to\nshine. Let us go and see the town, and then--yes, I'll go back with you\nto Dudley, just to hear whether Eve is feeling any better. You could\nsee her, and then come out and tell me.\"\n\n\"Mr. Hilliard, I'm quite sure you are worrying without any cause--you\nare, indeed!\"\n\n\"I know I am. It's all nonsense. Come along, and let us enjoy the\nsunshine.\"\n\nThey spent three or four hours together, Hilliard resolute in his\ndischarge of hospitable duties, and Miss Ringrose, after a brief spell\nof unnatural gravity, allowing no reflection to interfere with her\nholiday mood. Hilliard had never felt quite sure as to the limits of\nPatty's intelligence; he could not take her seriously, and yet felt\nunable to treat her altogether as a child or an imbecile. To-day,\nbecause of his preoccupied thoughts, and the effort it cost him to be\njocose, he talked for the most part in a vein of irony which impressed,\nbut did not much enlighten, his hearer.\n\n\"This,\" said he, when they had reached the centre of things, \"is the\nAcropolis of Birmingham. Here are our great buildings, of which we\nboast to the world. They signify the triumph of Democracy--and of\nmoney. In front of you stands the Town Hall. Here, to the left, is the\nMidland Institute, where a great deal of lecturing goes on, and the big\nfree library, where you can either read or go to sleep. I have done\nboth in my time. Behind yonder you catch a glimpse of the fountain that\nplays to the glory of Joseph Chamberlain--did you ever hear of him? And\nfurther back still is Mason College, where young men are taught a\nvariety of things, including discontent with a small income. To the\nright there, that's the Council Hall--splendid, isn't it! We bring our\nlittle boys to look at it, and tell them if they make money enough they\nmay some day go in and out as if it were their own house. Behind it you\nsee the Art Gallery. We don't really care for pictures; a great big\nmachine is our genuine delight; but it wouldn't be nice to tell\neverybody that.\"\n\n\"What a lot I have learnt from you!\" exclaimed the girl ingenuously,\nwhen at length they turned their steps towards the railway station. \"I\nshall always remember Birmingham. You like it much better than London,\ndon't you?\"\n\n\"I glory in the place!\"\n\nHilliard was tired out. He repented of his proposal to make the journey\nto Dudley and back, but his companion did not suspect this.\n\n\"I'm sure Eve will come out and have a little walk with us,\" she said\ncomfortingly. \"And she'll think it so kind of you.\"\n\nAt Dudley station there were crowds of people; Patty asked leave to\nhold by her companion's arm as they made their way to the exit. Just\noutside Hilliard heard himself hailed in a familiar voice; he turned\nand saw Narramore.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said his friend, coming near. \"I didn't notice--I\nthought you were alone, or, of course I shouldn't have shouted. Shall\nyou be at home to-morrow afternoon?\"\n\n\"If it rains.\"\n\n\"It's sure to rain. I shall look in about four.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\nWith a glance at Miss Ringrose, he raised his hat and passed on.\nHilliard, confused by the rapid rencontre, half annoyed at having been\nseen with Patty, and half wishing he had not granted the appointment\nfor tomorrow, as it might interfere with a visit from the girls, walked\nforward in silence.\n\n\"So we really sha'n't see you if it's wet tomorrow,\" said Patty.\n\n\"Better not. Eve would be afraid to come, she catches cold so easily.\"\n\n\"It may be fine, like to-day. I do hope----\"\n\nShe broke off and added:\n\n\"Why, isn't that Eve in front?\"\n\nEve it certainly was, walking slowly away from the station, a few yards\nin advance of them. They quickened their pace, and Patty caught her\nfriend by the arm. Eve, startled out of abstraction, stared at her with\neyes of dismay and bloodless cheeks.\n\n\"Did I frighten you? Mr. Hilliard has come back with me to ask how you\nare. Is your head better?\"\n\n\"I've just been down to the station--for something to do,\" said Eve,\nher look fixed on Hilliard with what seemed to him a very strange\nintensity. \"The afternoon was so fine.\"\n\n\"We've had a splendid time,\" cried Patty. \"Mr. Hilliard has shown me\neverything.\"\n\n\"I'm so glad. I should only have spoilt it if I had been with you. It's\nwretched going about with a headache, and I can't make believe to enjoy\nBirmingham.\"\n\nEve spoke hurriedly, still regarding Hilliard, who looked upon the\nground.\n\n\"Have you been alone all day?\" he asked, taking the outer place at her\nside, as they walked on.\n\n\"Of course--except for the people in the house,\" was her offhand reply.\n\n\"I met Narramore down at the station; he must have passed you. What has\nbrought him here to-day, I wonder?\"\n\nAppearing not to heed the remark, Eve glanced across at Patty, and said\nwith a laugh:\n\n\"It's like Paris again, isn't it--we three? You ought to come and live\nhere, Patty. Don't you think you could get a place in Birmingham? Mr.\nHilliard would get a piano for his room, and you could let him have\nsome music. I'm too old to learn.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he wouldn't want _me_ jingling there.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't he? He's very fond of music indeed.\"\n\nHilliard stopped.\n\n\"Well, I don't think I'll go any further,\" he said mechanically.\n\"You're quite well again, Eve, and that's all I wanted to know.\"\n\n\"What about to-morrow?\" Eve asked.\n\nThe sun had set, and in the westward sky rose a mountain of menacing\ncloud. Hilliard gave a glance in that direction before replying.\n\n\"Don't count upon me. Patty and you will enjoy the day together, in any\ncase. Yes, I had rather have it so. Narramore said just now he might\nlook in to see me in the after' noon. But come over on Monday. When\ndoes Patty's train go from New Street?\"\n\nEve was mute, gazing at the speaker as if she did not catch what he had\nsaid. Patty answered for herself.\n\n\"Then you can either come to my place,\" he continued, \"or I'll meet you\nat the station.\"\n\nPatty's desire was evident in her face; she looked at Eve.\n\n\"We'll come to you early in the afternoon,\" said the latter, speaking\nlike one aroused from reverie. \"Yes, we'll come whatever the weather\nis.\"\n\nThe young man shook hands with them, raised his hat, and walked away\nwithout further speech. It occurred to him that he might overtake\nNarramore at the station, and in that hope he hastened; but Narramore\nmust have left by a London and North-Western train which had just\nstarted; he was nowhere discoverable. Hilliard travelled back by the\nGreat Western, after waiting about an hour; he had for companions\nhalf-a-dozen beer-muddled lads, who roared hymns and costers' catches\nimpartially.\n\nHis mind was haunted with deadly suspicions: he felt sick at heart.\n\nEve's headache, undoubtedly, was a mere pretence for not accompanying\nPatty to-day. She had desired to be alone, and--this he discovered no\nless clearly--she wished the friendship between him and Patty to be\nfostered. With what foolish hope? Was she so shallow-natured as to\nimagine that he might transfer his affections to Patty Ringrose? it\nproved how strong her desire had grown to be free from him.\n\nThe innocent Patty (_was_ she so innocent?) seemed not to suspect the\nmeaning of her friend's talk. Yet Eve must have all but told her in so\nmany words that she was weary of her lover. That hateful harping on\n\"gratitude\"! Well, one cannot purchase a woman's love. He had missed\nthe right, the generous, line of conduct. That would have been to\nrescue Eve from manifest peril, and then to ask nothing of her. Could\nhe but have held his passions in leash, something like\nfriendship--rarest of all relations between man and woman--might have\ncome about between him and Eve. She, too, certainly had never got\nbeyond the stage of liking him as a companion; her senses had never\nanswered to his appeal He looked back upon the evening when they had\ndined together at the restaurant in Holborn. Could he but have stopped\nat _that_ point! There would have been no harm in such avowals as then\nescaped him, for he recognised without bitterness that the warmth of\nfeeling was all on one side, and Eve, in the manner of her sex, could\nlike him better for his love without a dream of returning it. His error\nwas to have taken advantage--perhaps a mean advantage--of the strange\nevents that followed. If he restrained himself before, how much more he\nshould have done so when the girl had put herself at his mercy, when to\ndemand her love was the obvious, commonplace, vulgar outcome of the\nsituation? Of course she harped on \"gratitude.\" What but a sense of\nobligation had constrained her?\n\nSomething had taken place to-day; he felt it as a miserable certainty.\nThe man from London had been with her. She expected him, and had\nelaborately planned for a day of freedom. Perhaps her invitation of\nPatty had no other motive.\n\nThat Patty was a conspirator against him he could not believe. No! She\nwas merely an instrument of Eve's subtlety. And his suspicion had not\ngone beyond the truth. Eve entertained the hope that Patty might take\nher place. Perchance the silly, good-natured girl would feel no\nobjection; though it was not very likely that she foresaw or schemed\nfor such an issue.\n\nAt Snow Hill station it cost him an effort to rise and leave the\ncarriage. His mood was sluggish; he wished to sit still and think idly\nover the course of events.\n\nHe went byway of St. Philip's Church, which stands amid a wide\ngraveyard, enclosed with iron railings, and crossed by paved walks. The\nlocality was all but forsaken; the church rose black against the grey\nsky, and the lofty places of business round about were darkly silent. A\nman's footstep sounded in front of him, and a figure approached along\nthe narrow path between the high bars. Hilliard would have passed\nwithout attention, but the man stopped his way.\n\n\"Hollo! Here we are again!\"\n\nHe stared at the speaker, and recognised Mr. Dengate.\n\n\"So you've come back?\"\n\n\"Where from?\" said Hilliard. \"What do you know of me?\"\n\n\"As much as I care to,\" replied the other with a laugh. \"So you haven't\nquite gone to the devil yet? I gave you six months. I've been watching\nthe police news in the London papers.\"\n\nIn a maddening access of rage, Hilliard clenched his fist and struck\nfiercely at the man. But he did no harm, for his aim was wild, and\nDengate easily warded off the blows.\n\n\"Hold on! You're drunk, of course. Stop it, my lad, or I'll have you\nlocked up till Monday morning. Very obliging of you to offer me the\npleasure I was expecting, but you _will_ have it, eh?\"\n\nA second blow was repaid in kind, and Hilliard staggered back against\nthe railings. Before he could recover himself, Dengate, whose high hat\nrolled between their feet, pinned his arms.\n\n\"There's someone coming along. It's a pity. I should enjoy thrashing\nyou and then running you in. But a man of my position doesn't care to\nget mixed up in a street row. It wouldn't sound well at Liverpool.\nStand quiet, will you!\"\n\nA man and a woman drew near, and lingered for a moment in curiosity.\nHilliard already amazed at what he had done, became passive, and stood\nwith bent head.\n\n\"I must have a word or two With you,\" said Dengate, when he had picked\nup his hat. \"Can you walk straight? I didn't notice you were drunk\nbefore I spoke to you. Come along this way.\"\n\nTo escape the lookers-on, Hilliard moved forward.\n\n\"I've always regretted,\" resumed his companion, \"that I didn't give you\na sound thrashing that night in the train. It would have done you good.\nIt might have been the making of you. I didn't hurt you, eh?\"\n\n\"You've bruised my lips--that's all. And I deserved it for being such a\ndamned fool as to lose my temper.\"\n\n\"You look rather more decent than I should have expected. What have you\nbeen doing in London?\"\n\n\"How do you know I have been in London?\"\n\n\"I took that for granted when I knew you'd left your work at Dudley.\"\n\n\"Who told you I had left it?\"\n\n\"What does it matter?\"\n\n\"I should like to know,\" said Hilliard, whose excitement had passed and\nleft him cold. \"And I should like to know who told you before that I\nwas in the habit of getting drunk?\"\n\n\"Are you drunk now, or not?\"\n\n\"Not in the way you mean. Do you happen to know a man called Narramore?\"\n\n\"Never heard the name.\"\n\nHilliard felt ashamed of his ignoble suspicion. He became silent.\n\n\"There's no reason why you shouldn't be told,\" added Dengate; \"it was a\nfriend of yours at Dudley that I came across when I was making\ninquiries about you: Mullen his name was.\"\n\nA clerk at the ironworks, with whom Hilliard had been on terms of\nslight intimacy.\n\n\"Oh, that fellow,\" he uttered carelessly. \"I'm glad to know it was no\none else. Why did you go inquiring about me?\"\n\n\"I told you. If I'd heard a better account I should have done a good\ndeal more for you than pay that money. I gave you a chance, too. If\nyou'd shown any kind of decent behaviour when I spoke to you in the\ntrain--but it's no good talking about that now. This is the second time\nyou've let me see what a natural blackguard you are. It's queer, too,\nyou didn't get that from your father. I could have put you in the way\nof something good at Liverpool. Now, I'd see you damned first, Well,\nhave you run through the money?\"\n\n\"Every penny of it gone in drink.\"\n\n\"And what are you doing?\"\n\n\"Walking with a man I should be glad to be rid of.\"\n\n\"All right. Here's my card. When you get into the gutter, and nobody'll\ngive you a hand out, let me know.\"\n\nWith a nod, Dengate walked off. Hilliard saw him smooth his silk hat as\nhe went; then, without glancing at the card, he threw it away.\n\nThe next morning was cold and wet. He lay in bed till eleven o'clock,\nwhen the charwoman came to put his rooms in order. At mid-day he left\nhome, had dinner at the nearest place he knew where a meal could be\nobtained on Sunday, and afterwards walked the streets for an hour under\nhis umbrella. The exercise did him good; on returning he felt able to\nsit down by the fire, and turn over the plates of his great book on\nFrench Cathedrals. This, at all events, remained to him out of the\nwreck, and was a joy that could be counted upon in days to come.\n\nHe hoped Narramore would keep his promise, and was not disappointed. On\nthe verge of dusk his friend knocked and entered.\n\n\"The blind woman was at the door below,\" he explained, \"looking for\nsomebody.\"\n\n\"It isn't as absurd as it sounds. She does look for people--with her\nears. She knows a footstep that no one else can hear. What were _you_\ndoing at Dudley yesterday?\"\n\nNarramore took his pipe out of its case and smiled over it.\n\n\"Colours well, doesn't it?\" he remarked. \"You don't care about the\ncolouring of a pipe? I get a lot of satisfaction out of such little\nthings! Lazy fellows always do; and they have the best of life in the\nend. By-the-bye, what were _you_ doing at Dudley?\"\n\n\"Had to go over with a girl.\"\n\n\"Rather a pretty girl, too. Old acquaintance?\"\n\n\"Someone I got to know in London. No, no, not at all what you suppose.\"\n\n\"Well, I know you wouldn't talk about it. It isn't my way, either, to\nsay much about such things. But I half-promised, not long ago, to let\nyou know of something that was going on--if it came to anything. And it\nrather looks as if it might. What do you think! Birching has been at\nme, wanting to know why I don't call. I wonder whether the girl put him\nup to it?\"\n\n\"You went rather far, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Oh, I drew back in time. Besides, those ideas are old-fashioned. It'll\nhave to be understood that marriageable girls have nothing specially\nsacred about them. They must associate with men on equal terms. The day\nhas gone by for a hulking brother to come asking a man about his\n'intentions.' As a rule, it's the girl that has intentions. The man is\njust looking round, anxious to be amiable without making a fool of\nhimself. We're at a great disadvantage. A girl who isn't an idiot can\nvery soon know all about the men who interest her; but it's devilish\ndifficult to get much insight into _them_--until you've hopelessly\ncommitted yourself--won't you smoke? I've something to tell you, and I\ncan't talk to a man who isn't smoking, when my own pipe's lit.\"\n\nHilliard obeyed, and for a few moments they puffed in silence, twilight\nthickening about them.\n\n\"Three or four months ago,\" resumed Narramore, \"I was told one day--at\nbusiness--that a lady wished to see me. I happened to have the room to\nmyself, and told them to show the lady in. I didn't in the least know\nwho it could be, and I was surprised to see rather a good-looking\ngirl--not exactly a lady--tallish, and with fine dark eyes--what did\nyou say?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"A twinge of gout?\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\nNarramore scrutinised his friend, who spoke in an unusual tone.\n\n\"She sat down, and began to tell me that she was out of work--wanted a\nplace as a bookkeeper, or something of the kind. Could I help her? I\nasked her why she came to _me_. She said she had heard of me from\nsomeone who used to be employed at our place. That was flattering. I\nshowed my sense of it. Then I asked her name, and she said it was Miss\nMadeley.\"\n\nA gust threw rain against the windows. Narramore paused, looking into\nthe fire, and smiling thoughtfully.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\n\"You foresee the course of the narrative?\"\n\n\"Better tell it in detail,\" muttered Hilliard.\n\n\"Why this severe tone? Do you anticipate something that will shock your\nmoral sense? I didn't think you were so straitlaced.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say----\"\n\nHilliard was sitting upright; his voice began on a harsh tremor, and\nsuddenly failed. The other gazed at him in humorous astonishment.\n\n\"What the devil do you mean? Even suppose--who made you a judge and a\nruler? This is the most comical start I've known for a long time. I was\ngoing to tell you that I have made up my mind to marry the girl.\"\n\n\"I see--it's all right----\"\n\n\"But do you really mean,\" said Narramore, \"that anything else would\nhave aroused your moral indignation?\"\n\nHilliard burst into a violent fit of laughter. His pipe fell to the\nfloor, and broke; whereupon he interrupted his strange merriment with a\nsavage oath.\n\n\"It was a joke, then?\" remarked his friend.\n\n\"Your monstrous dulness shows the state of your mind. This is what\ncomes of getting entangled with women. You need to have a sense of\nhumour.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid there's some truth in what you say, old boy. I've been\nconscious of queer symptoms lately--a disposition to take things with\nabsurd seriousness, and an unwholesome bodily activity now and then.\"\n\n\"Go on with your tragic story. The girl asked you to find her a\nplace----\"\n\n\"I promised to think about it, but I couldn't hear of anything\nsuitable. She had left her address with me, so at length I wrote her a\nline just saying I hadn't forgotten her. I got an answer on black-edged\npaper. Miss Madeley wrote to tell me that her father had recently died,\nand that she had found employment at Dudley; with thanks for my\nkindness--and so on. It was rather a nicely written letter, and after a\nday or two I wrote again. I heard nothing--hardly expected to; so in a\nfortnight's time I wrote once more. Significant, wasn't it? I'm not\nfond of writing letters, as you know. But I've written a good many\nsince then. At last it came to another meeting. I went over to Dudley\non purpose, and saw Miss Madeley on the Castle Hill. I had liked the\nlook of her from the first, and I liked it still better now. By dint of\npersuasion, I made her tell me all about herself.\"\n\n\"Did she tell you the truth?\"\n\n\"Why should you suppose she didn't?\" replied Narramore with some\nemphasis. \"You must look at this affair in a different light, Hilliard.\nA joke is a joke, but I've told you that the joking time has gone by. I\ncan make allowance for you: you think I have been making a fool of\nmyself, after all.\"\n\n\"The beginning was ominous.\"\n\n\"The beginning of our acquaintance? Yes, I know how it strikes you. But\nshe came in that way because she had been trying for months----\"\n\n\"Who was it that told her of you?\"\n\n\"Oh, one of our girls, no doubt. I haven't asked her--never thought\nagain about it.\"\n\n\"And what's her record?\"\n\n\"Nothing dramatic in it, I'm glad to say. At one time she had an\nengagement in London for a year or two. Her people, 'poor but\nhonest'--as the stories put it. Father was a timekeeper at Dudley;\nbrother, a mechanic there. I was over to see her yesterday; we had only\njust said good-bye when I met you. She's remarkably well educated, all\nthings considered: very fond of reading; knows as much of books as I\ndo--more, I daresay. First-rate intelligence; I guessed that from the\nfirst. I can see the drawbacks, of course. As I said, she isn't what\n_you_ would call a lady; but there's nothing much to find fault with\neven in her manners. And the long and the short of it is, I'm in love\nwith her.\"\n\n\"And she has promised to marry you?\"\n\n\"Well, not in so many words. She seems to have scruples--difference of\nposition, and that kind of thing.\"\n\n\"Very reasonable scruples, no doubt.\"\n\n\"Quite right that she should think of it in that way, at all events.\nBut I believe it was practically settled yesterday. She isn't in very\nbrilliant health, poor girl! I want to get her away from that beastly\nplace as soon as possible. I shall give myself a longish holiday, and\ntake her on to the Continent. A thorough change of that kind would set\nher up wonderfully.\n\n\"She has never been on to the Continent?\"\n\n\"What a preposterous question! You're going to sleep, sitting here in\nthe dark. Oh, don't trouble to light up for me; I can't stay much\nlonger.\"\n\nHilliard had risen, but instead of lighting the lamp he turned to the\nwindow and stood there drumming with his fingers on a pane.\n\n\"Are you seriously concerned for me?\" said his friend. \"Does it seem a\npiece of madness?\"\n\n\"You must judge for yourself, Narramore.\"\n\n\"When you have seen her I think you'll take my views. Of course it's\nthe very last thing I ever imagined myself doing; but I begin to see\nthat the talk about fate isn't altogether humbug. I want this girl for\nmy wife, and I never met any one else whom I really _did_ want. She\nsuits me exactly. It isn't as if I thought of marrying an ordinary,\nignorant, low-class girl. Eve--that's her name--is very much out of the\ncommon, look at her how you may. She's rather melancholy, but that's a\nnatural result of her life.\"\n\n\"No doubt, as you say, she wants a thorough change,\" remarked Hilliard,\nsmiling in the gloom.\n\n\"That's it. Her nerves are out of order. Well, I thought I should like\nto tell you this, old chap. You'll get over the shock in time. I more\nthan half believe, still, that your moral indignation was genuine. And\nwhy not? I ought to respect you for it.\"\n\n\"Are you going?\"\n\n\"I must be in Bristol Road by five--promised to drink a cup of Mrs.\nStocker's tea this afternoon. I'm glad now that I have kept up a few\nhomely acquaintances; they may be useful, Of course I shall throw over\nthe Birchings and that lot. You see now why my thoughts have been\nrunning on a country house!\"\n\nHe went off laughing, and his friend sat down again by the fireside.\n\nHalf an hour passed. The fire had burnt low, and the room was quite\ndark. At length, Hilliard bestirred himself. He lit the lamp, drew down\nthe blind, and seated himself at the table to write. With great\nrapidity he covered four sides of note-paper, and addressed an\nenvelope. But he had no postage-stamp. It could be obtained at a\ntobacconist's.\n\nSo he went out, and turned towards a little shop hard by. But when he\nhad stamped the letter he felt undecided about posting it. Eve had\npromised to come to-morrow with Patty. If she again failed him it would\nbe time enough to write. If she kept her promise the presence of a\nthird person would be an intolerable restraint upon him. Yet why? Patty\nmight as well know all, and act as judge between them. There needed\nlittle sagacity to arbitrate in a matter such as this.\n\nTo sit at home was impossible. He walked for the sake of walking,\nstraight on, without object. Down the long gas-lit perspective of\nBradford Street, with its closed, silent workshops, across the\nmiserable little river Rea--canal rather than river, sewer rather than\ncanal--up the steep ascent to St. Martin's and the Bull Ring, and the\nbronze Nelson, dripping with dirty moisture; between the big buildings\nof New Street, and so to the centre of the town. At the corner by the\nPost Office he stood in idle contemplation. Rain was still falling, but\nlightly. The great open space gleamed with shafts of yellow radiance\nreflected on wet asphalt from the numerous lamps. There was little\ntraffic. An omnibus clattered by, and a tottery cab, both looking\nrain-soaked. Near the statue of Peel stood a hansom, the forlorn horse\ncrooking his knees and hanging his hopeless head. The Town Hall\ncolonnade sheltered a crowd of people, who were waiting for the rain to\nstop, that they might spend their Sunday evening, as usual, in rambling\nabout the streets. Within the building, which showed light through all\nits long windows, a religious meeting was in progress, and hundreds of\nvoices peeled forth a rousing hymn, fortified with deeper organ-note.\n\nHilliard noticed that as rain-drops fell on the heated globes of the\nstreet-lamps they were thrown off again in little jets and puffs of\nsteam. This phenomenon amused him for several minutes. He wondered that\nhe had never observed it before.\n\nEaster Sunday. The day had its importance for a Christian mind. Did Eve\nthink about that? Perhaps her association with him, careless as he was\nin all such matters, had helped to blunt her religious feeling. Yet\nwhat hope was there, in such a world as this, that she would retain the\npieties of her girlhood?\n\nEaster Sunday. As he walked on, he pondered the Christian story, and\ntried to make something out of it. Had it any significance for _him_?\nPerhaps, for he had never consciously discarded the old faith; he had\nsimply let it fall out of his mind. But a woman ought to have religious\nconvictions. Yes; he saw the necessity of that. Better for him if Eve\nwere in the Town Hall yonder, joining her voice with those that sang.\n\nBetter for _him_. A selfish point of view. But the advantage would be\nhers also. Did he not desire her happiness? He tried to think so, but\nafter all was ashamed to play the sophist with himself. The letter he\ncarried in his pocket told the truth. He had but to think of her as\nmarried to Robert Narramore and the jealous fury of natural man drove\nhim headlong.\n\nMonday was again a holiday. When would the cursed people get back to\ntheir toil, and let the world resume its wonted grind and clang? They\nseemed to have been making holiday for a month past.\n\nHe walked up and down on the pavement near his door, until at the\nstreet corner there appeared a figure he knew. It was Patty Ringrose,\nagain unaccompanied.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nThey shook hands without a word, their eyes meeting for an instant\nonly. Hilliard led the way upstairs; and Patty, still keeping an\nembarrassed silence, sat down on the easy-chair. Her complexion was as\nnoticeably fresh as Hilliard's was wan and fatigued. Where Patty's skin\nshowed a dimple, his bore a gash, the result of an accident in shaving\nthis morning.\n\nWith hands behind he stood in front of the girl.\n\n\"She chose not to come, then?\"\n\n\"Yes. She asked me to come and see you alone.\"\n\n\"No pretence of headache this time.\"\n\n\"I don't think it was a pretence,\" faltered Patty, who looked very ill\nat ease, for all the bloom on her cheeks and the clear, childish light\nin her eyes.\n\n\"Well, then, why hasn't she come to-day?\"\n\n\"She has sent a letter for you, Mr. Hilliard.\"\n\nPatty handed the missive, and Hilliard laid it upon the table.\n\n\"Am I to read it now?\"\n\n\"I think it's a long letter.\"\n\n\"Feels like it. I'll study it at my leisure. You know what it contains?\"\n\nPatty nodded, her face turned away.\n\n\"And why has she chosen to-day to write to me?\" Patty kept silence.\n\"Anything to do with the call I had yesterday from my friend Narramore?\"\n\n\"Yes--that's the reason. But she has meant to let you know for some\ntime.\"\n\nHilliard drew a long breath. He fixed his eyes on the letter.\n\n\"She has told me everything,\" the girl continued, speaking hurriedly.\n\"Did you know about it before yesterday?\"\n\n\"I'm not so good an actor as all that. Eve has the advantage of me in\nthat respect. She really thought it possible that Narramore had spoken\nbefore?\"\n\n\"She couldn't be sure.\"\n\n\"H'm! Then she didn't know for certain that Narramore was going to talk\nto me about her yesterday?\"\n\n\"She knew it _must_ come.\"\n\n\"Patty, our friend Miss Madeley is a very sensible person--don't you\nthink so?\"\n\n\"You mustn't think she made a plan to deceive you. She tells you all\nabout it in the letter, and I'm quite sure it's all true, Mr. Hilliard.\nI was astonished when I heard of it, and I can't tell you how sorry I\nfeel----\"\n\n\"I'm not at all sure that there's any cause for sorrow,\" Hilliard\ninterrupted, drawing up a chair and throwing himself upon it. \"Unless\nyou mean that you are sorry for Eve.\"\n\n\"I meant that as well.\"\n\n\"Let us understand each other. How much has she told you?\"\n\n\"Everything, from beginning to end. I had no idea of what happened in\nLondon before we went to Paris. And she does so repent of it! She\ndoesn't know how she could do it. She wishes you had refused her.\"\n\n\"So do I.\"\n\n\"But you saved her--she can never forget that. You mustn't think that\nshe only pretends to be grateful. She will be grateful to you as long\nas she lives. I know she will.\"\n\n\"On condition that I--what?\"\n\nPatty gave him a bewildered look.\n\n\"What does she ask of me now?\"\n\n\"She's ashamed to ask anything. She fears you will never speak to her\nagain.\"\n\nHilliard meditated, then glanced at the letter.\n\n\"I had better read this now, I think, if you will let me.\"\n\n\"Yes--please do----\"\n\nHe tore open the envelope, and disclosed two sheets of note-paper,\ncovered with writing. For several minutes there was silence; Patty now\nand then gave a furtive glance at her companion's face as he was\nreading. At length he put the letter down again, softly.\n\n\"There's something more here than I expected. Can you tell me whether\nshe heard from Narramore this morning?\"\n\n\"She has had no letter.\"\n\n\"I see. And what does she suppose passed between Narramore and me\nyesterday?\"\n\n\"She is wondering what you told him.\"\n\n\"She takes it for granted, in this letter, that I have put an end to\neverything between them. Well, hadn't I a right to do so?\"\n\n\"Of course you had,\" Patty replied, with emphasis. \"And she knew it\nmust come. She never really thought that she could marry Mr. Narramore.\nShe gave him no promise.\"\n\n\"Only corresponded with him, and made appointments with him, and\nallowed him to feel sure that she would be his wife.\"\n\n\"Eve has behaved very strangely. I can't understand her. She ought to\nhave told you that she had been to see him, and that he wrote to her.\nIt's always best to be straightforward. See what trouble she has got\nherself into!\"\n\nHilliard took up the letter again, and again there was a long silence.\n\n\"Have you said good-bye to her?\" were his next words.\n\n\"She's going to meet me at the station to see me off.\"\n\n\"Did she come from Dudley with you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"It's all very well to make use of you for this disagreeable\nbusiness----\"\n\n\"Oh, I didn't mind it!\" broke in Patty, with irrelevant cheerfulness.\n\n\"A woman 'who does such things as this should have the courage to go\nthrough with it. She ought to have come herself, and have told me that.\nShe was aiming at much better things than _I_ could have promised her.\nThere would have been something to admire in that. The worst of it is\nshe is making me feel ashamed of her. I'd rather have to do with a\nwoman who didn't care a rap for my feelings than with a weak one, who\ntried to spare me to advantage herself at the same time. There's\nnothing like courage, whether in good or evil. What do you think? Does\nshe like Narramore?\"\n\n\"I think she does,\" faltered Patty, nervously striking her dress.\n\n\"Is she in love with him?\"\n\n\"I--I really don't know!\"\n\n\"Do you think she ever was in love with anyone, or ever will be?\"\n\nPatty sat mute.\n\n\"Just tell me what you think.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid she never--Oh, I don't like to say it, Mr. Hilliard!\"\n\n\"That she never was in love with _me_? I know it.\"\n\nHis tone caused Patty to look up at him, and what she saw in his face\nmade her say quickly:\n\n\"I am so sorry; I am indeed! You deserve----\"\n\n\"Never mind what I deserve,\" Hilliard interrupted with a grim smile.\n\"Something less than hanging, I hope. That fellow in London; she was\nfond of _him_?\"\n\nThe girl whispered an assent.\n\n\"A pity I interfered.\"\n\n\"Ah! But think what----\"\n\n\"We won't discuss it, Patty. It's a horrible thing to be mad about a\ngirl who cares no more for you than for an old glove; but it's a fool's\npart to try to win her by the way of gratitude. When we came back from\nParis I ought to have gone my way, and left her to go hers. Perhaps\njust possible--if I had seemed to think no more of her----\"\n\nPatty waited, but he did not finish his speech.\n\n\"What are you going to do, Mr. Hilliard?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's the question. Shall I hold her to her promise? She says\nhere that she will keep her word if I demand it.\"\n\n\"She says that!\" Patty exclaimed, with startled eyes.\n\n\"Didn't you know?\"\n\n\"She told me it was impossible. But perhaps she didn't mean it. Who can\ntell _what_ she means?\"\n\nFor the first time there sounded a petulance in the girl's voice. Her\nlips closed tightly, and she tapped with her foot on the floor.\n\n\"Did she say that the other thing was also impossible--to marry\nNarramore?\"\n\n\"She thinks it is, after what you've told him.\"\n\n\"Well, now, as a matter of fact I told him nothing.\"\n\nPatty stared, a new light in her eyes.\n\n\"You told him--nothing?\"\n\n\"I just let him suppose that I had never heard the girl's name before.\"\n\n\"Oh, how kind of you! How----\"\n\n\"Please to remember that it wasn't very easy to tell the truth. What\nsort of figure should I have made?\"\n\n\"It's too bad of Eve! It's cruel! I can never like her as I did before.\"\n\n\"Oh, she's very interesting. She gives one such a lot to talk about.\"\n\n\"I don't like her, and I shall tell her so before I leave Birmingham.\nWhat right has she to make people so miserable?\"\n\n\"Only one, after all.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that you will let her marry Mr. Narramore?\" Patty asked\nwith interest.\n\n\"We shall have to talk about that.\"\n\n\"If I were you I should never see her again!\"\n\n\"The probability is that we shall see each other many a time.\"\n\n\"Then _you_ haven't much courage, Mr. Hilliard!\" exclaimed the girl,\nwith a flush on her cheeks.\n\n\"More than you think, perhaps,\" he answered between his teeth.\n\n\"Men are very strange,\" Patty commented in a low voice of scorn,\nmitigated by timidity.\n\n\"Yes, we play queer pranks when a woman has made a slave of us. I\nsuppose you think I should have too much pride to care any more for\nher. The truth is that for years to come I shall tremble all through\nwhenever she is near me. Such love as I have felt for Eve won't be\ntrampled out like a spark. It's the best and the worst part of my life.\nNo woman can ever be to me what Eve is.\"\n\nAbashed by the grave force of this utterance, Patty shrank back into\nthe chair, and held her peace.\n\n\"You will very soon know what conies of it all,\" Hilliard continued\nwith a sudden change of voice. \"It has to be decided pretty quickly,\none way or another.\"\n\n\"May I tell Eve what you have said to me?\" the girl asked with\ndiffidence.\n\n\"Yes, anything that I have said.\"\n\nPatty lingered a little, then, as her companion said no more, she rose.\n\n\"I must say good-bye, Mr. Hilliard.\"\n\n\"I am afraid your holiday hasn't been as pleasant as you expected.\"\n\n\"Oh, I have enjoyed myself very much. And I hope\"--her voice\nwavered--\"I do hope it'll be all right. I'm sure you'll do what seems\nbest.\"\n\n\"I shall do what I find myself obliged to, Patty. Good-bye. I won't\noffer to go with you, for I should be poor company.\"\n\nHe conducted her to the foot of the stairs, again shook hands with her,\nput all his goodwill into a smile, and watched her trip away with a\nstep not so light as usual. Then he returned to Eve's letter. It gave\nhim a detailed account of her relations with Narramore. \"I went to him\nbecause I couldn't bear to live idle any longer; I had no other thought\nin my mind. If he had been the means of my finding work, I should have\nconfessed it to you at once. But I was tempted into answering his\nletters.... I knew I was behaving wrongly; I can't defend myself.... I\nhave never concealed my faults from you--the greatest of them is my\nfear of poverty. I believe it is this that has prevented me from\nreturning your love as I wished to do. For a long time I have been\nplaying a deceitful part, and the strange thing is that I _knew_ my\nexposure might come at any moment. I seem to have been led on by a sort\nof despair. Now I am tired of it; whether you were prepared for this or\nnot, I must tell you.... I don't ask you to release me. I have been\nwronging you and acting against my conscience, and if you can forgive\nme I will try to make up for the ill I have done....\"\n\nHow much of this could he believe? Gladly he would have fooled himself\ninto believing it all, but the rational soul in him cast out credulity.\nEvery phrase of the letter was calculated for its impression. And the\nvery risk she had run, was not that too a matter of deliberate\nspeculation? She _might_ succeed in her design upon Narramore; if she\nfailed, the 'poorer man was still to be counted upon, for she knew the\nextent of her power over him. It was worth the endeavour. Perhaps, in\nher insolent self-confidence, she did not fear the effect on Narramore\nof the disclosure that might be made to him. And who could say that her\nboldness was not likely to be justified?\n\nHe burned with wrath against her, the wrath of a hopelessly infatuated\nman. Thoughts of revenge, no matter how ignoble, harassed his mind. She\ncounted on his slavish spirit, and even in saying that she did not ask\nhim to release her, she saw herself already released. At each reperusal\nof her letter he felt more resolved to disappoint the hope that\ninspired it. When she learnt from Patty that Narramore was still\nignorant of her history how would she exult! But that joy should be\nbrief. In the name of common honesty he would protect his friend. If\nNarramore chose to take her with his eyes open----\n\nJealous frenzy kept him pacing the room for an hour or two. Then he\nwent forth and haunted the neighbourhood of New Street station until\nwithin five minutes of the time of departure of Patty's train. If Eve\nkept her promise to see the girl off he might surprise her upon the\nplatform.\n\nFrom the bridge crossing the lines he surveyed the crowd of people that\nwaited by the London train, a bank-holiday train taking back a freight\nof excursionists. There-amid he discovered Eve, noted her position,\ndescended to the platform, and got as near to her as possible. The\ntrain moved off. As Eve turned away among the dispersing people, he\nstepped to meet her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\nShe gave no sign of surprise. Hilliard read in her face that she had\nprepared herself for this encounter.\n\n\"Come away where we can talk,\" he said abruptly.\n\nShe walked by him to a part of the station where only a porter passed\noccasionally. The echoings beneath the vaulted roof allowed them to\nspeak without constraint, for their voices were inaudible a yard or two\noff. Hilliard would not look into her face, lest he should be softened\nto foolish clemency.\n\n\"It's very kind of you,\" he began, with no clear purpose save the\ndesire of harsh speech, \"to ask me to overlook this trifle, and let\nthings be as before.\"\n\n\"I have said all I _can_ say in the letter. I deserve all your anger.\"\n\nThat was the note he dreaded, the too well remembered note of pathetic\nsubmission. It reminded him with intolerable force that he had never\nheld her by any bond save that of her gratitude.\n\n\"Do you really imagine,\" he exclaimed, \"that I could go on with\nmake-believe--that I could bring myself to put faith in you again for a\nmoment?\"\n\n\"I don't ask you to,\" Eve replied, in firmer accents. \"I have lost what\nlittle respect you could ever feel for me. I might have repaid you with\nhonesty--I didn't do even that. Say the worst you can of me, and I\nshall think still worse of myself.\"\n\nThe voice overcame him with a conviction of her sincerity, and he gazed\nat her, marvelling.\n\n\"Are you honest _now_? Anyone would think so; yet how am I to believe\nit?\"\n\nEve met his eyes steadily.\n\n\"I will never again say one word to you that isn't pure truth. I am at\nyour mercy, and you may punish me as you like.\"\n\n\"There's only one way in which I can punish you. For the loss of _my_\nrespect, or of my love, you care nothing. If I bring myself to tell\nNarramore disagreeable things about you, you will suffer a\ndisappointment, and that's all. The cost to me will be much greater,\nand you know it. You pity yourself. You regard me as holding you\nungenerously by an advantage you once gave me. It isn't so at all. It\nis I who have been held by bonds I couldn't break, and from the day\nwhen you pretended a love you never felt, all the blame lay with you.\"\n\n\"What could I do?\"\n\n\"Be truthful--that was all.\"\n\n\"You were not content with the truth. You forced me to think that I\ncould love you, Only remember what passed between us.\"\n\n\"Honesty was still possible, when you came to know yourself better. You\nshould have said to me in so many words: 'I can't look forward to our\nfuture with any courage; if I marry it must be a man who has more to\noffer.' Do you think I couldn't have endured to hear that? You have\nnever understood me. I should have said: 'Then let us shake hands, and\nI am your friend to help you all I can.'\"\n\n\"You say that _now_----\"\n\n\"I should have said it at any time.\"\n\n\"But I am not so mean as you think me. If I loved a man I could face\npoverty with him, much as I hate and dread it. It was because I only\nliked you, and could not feel more----\"\n\n\"Your love happens to fall upon a man who has solid possessions.\"\n\n\"It's easy to speak so scornfully. I have not pretended to love the man\nyou mean.\"\n\n\"Yet you have brought him to think that you are willing to marry him.\"\n\n\"Without any word of love from me. If I had been free I would have\nmarried him--just because I am sick of the life I lead, and long for\nthe kind of life he offered me.\"\n\n\"When it's too late you are frank enough.\"\n\n\"Despise me as much as you like. You want the truth, and you shall hear\nnothing else from me.\"\n\n\"Well, we get near to understanding each other. But it astonishes me\nthat you spoilt your excellent chance. How could you hope to carry\nthrough this----\"\n\nEve broke in impatiently.\n\n\"I told you in the letter that I had no hope of it. It's your mistake\nto think me a crafty, plotting, selfish woman. I'm only a very\nmiserable one--it went on from this to that, and I meant nothing. I\ndidn't scheme; I was only tempted into foolishness. I felt myself\ngetting into difficulties that would be my ruin, but I hadn't strength\nto draw back.\"\n\n\"You do yourself injustice,\" said Hilliard, coldly. \"For the past month\nyou have acted a part before me, and acted it well. You seemed to be\nreconciling yourself to my prospects, indifferent as they were. You\nencouraged me--talked with unusual cheerfulness--showed a bright face.\nIf this wasn't deliberate acting what did it mean?\"\n\n\"Yes, it was put on,\" Eve admitted, after a pause. \"But I couldn't help\nthat. I was obliged to keep seeing you, and if I had looked as\nmiserable as I felt----\" She broke off. \"I tried to behave just like a\nfriend. You can't charge me with pretending--anything else. I _could_\nbe your friend: that was honest feeling.\"\n\n\"It's no use to me. I must have more, or nothing.\"\n\nThe flood of passion surged in him again. Some trick of her voice, or\nsome indescribable movement of her head--the trifles which are\nall-powerful over a man in love--beat down his contending reason.\n\n\"You say,\" he continued, \"that you will make amends for your unfair\ndealing. If you mean it, take the only course that shows itself.\nConfess to Narramore what you have done; you owe it to him as much as\nto me.\"\n\n\"I can't do that,\" said Eve, drawing away. \"It's for you to tell\nhim--if you like.\"\n\n\"No. I had my opportunity, and let it pass. I don't mean that you are\nto inform him of all there has been between us; that's needless. We\nhave agreed to forget everything that suggests the word I hate. But\nthat you and I have been lovers and looked--I, at all events--to be\nsomething more, this you must let him know.\"\n\n\"I can never do that.\"\n\n\"Without it, how are you to disentangle yourself?\"\n\n\"I promise you he shall see no more of me.\"\n\n\"Such a promise is idle, and you know it. Remember, too, that Narramore\nand I are friends. He will speak to me of you, and I can't play a farce\nwith him. It would be intolerable discomfort to me, and grossly unfair\nto him. Do, for once, the simple, honourable thing, and make a new\nbeginning. After that, be guided by your own interests. Assuredly I\nshall not stand in your way.\"\n\nEve had turned her eyes in the direction of crowd and bustle. When she\nfaced Hilliard again, he saw that she had come to a resolve.\n\n\"There's only one way out of it for me,\" she said impulsively. \"I can't\ntalk any longer. I'll write to you.\"\n\nShe moved from him; Hilliard followed. At a distance of half-a-dozen\nyards, just as he was about to address her again, she stopped and\nspoke--\n\n\"You hate to hear me talk of 'gratitude.' I have always meant by it\nless than you thought. I was grateful for the money, not for anything\nelse. When you took me away, perhaps it was the unkindest thing you\ncould have done.\"\n\nAn unwonted vehemence shook her voice. Her muscles were tense; she\nstood in an attitude of rebellious pride.\n\n\"If I had been true to myself then----But it isn't too late. If I am to\nact honestly, I know very well what I must do. I will take your advice.\"\n\nHilliard could not doubt of her meaning. He remembered his last talk\nwith Patty. This was a declaration he had not foreseen, and it affected\nhim otherwise than he could have anticipated.\n\n\"My advice had nothing to do with _that_,\" was his answer, as he read\nher face. \"But I shall say not a word against it. I could respect you,\nat all events.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I had rather have your respect than your love.\"\n\nWith that, she left him. He wished to pursue, but a physical languor\nheld him motionless. And when at length he sauntered from the place, it\nwas with a sense of satisfaction at what had happened. Let her carry\nout that purpose: he faced it, preferred it. Let her be lost to him in\nthat way rather than any other. It cut the knot, and left him with a\nmemory of Eve that would not efface her dishonouring weakness.\n\nLate at night, he walked about the streets near his home, debating with\nhimself whether she would act as she spoke, or had only sought to\nfrighten him with a threat. And still he hoped that her resolve was\nsincere. He could bear that conclusion of their story better than any\nother--unless it were her death. Better a thousand times than her\nmarriage with Narramore.\n\nIn the morning, fatigue gave voice to conscience. He had bidden her go,\nwhen, perchance, a word would have checked her. Should he write, or\neven go to her straightway and retract what he had said? His will\nprevailed, and he did nothing.\n\nThe night that followed plagued him with other misgivings. It seemed\nmore probable now that she had threatened what she would never have the\ncourage to perform. She meant it at the moment--it declared a truth but\nan hour after she would listen to commonplace morality or prudence.\nNarramore would write to her; she might, perhaps, see him again. She\nwould cling to the baser hope.\n\nMight but the morrow bring him a letter from London!\n\nIt brought nothing; and day after day disappointed him. More than a\nweek passed: he was ill with suspense, but could take no step for\nsetting his mind at rest. Then, as he sat one morning at his work in\nthe architect's office, there arrived a telegram addressed to him--\n\n\"I must see you as soon as possible. Be here before six.--Narramore.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\n\"What the devil does this mean, Hilliard?\"\n\nIf never before, the indolent man was now thoroughly aroused. He had an\nopen letter in his hand. Hilliard, standing before him in a little\noffice that smelt of ledgers and gum, and many other commercial things,\nknew that the letter must be from Eve, and savagely hoped that it was\ndated London.\n\n\"This is from Miss Madeley, and it's all about you. Why couldn't you\nspeak the other day?\"\n\n\"What does she say about me?\"\n\n\"That she has known you for a long time; that you saw a great deal of\neach other in London; that she has led you on with a hope of marrying\nher, though she never really meant it; in short, that she has used you\nvery ill, and feels obliged now to make a clean breast of it.\"\n\nThe listener fixed his eye upon a copying-press, but without seeing it.\nA grim smile began to contort his lips.\n\n\"Where does she write from?\"\n\n\"From her ordinary address--why not? I think this is rather too bad of\nyou. Why didn't you speak, instead of writhing about and sputtering?\nThat kind of thing is all very well--sense of honour and all that--but\nit meant that I was being taken in. Between friends--hang it! Of course\nI have done with her. I shall write at once. It's amazing; it took away\nmy breath. No doubt, though she doesn't say it, it was from you that\nshe came to know of me. She began with a lie. And who the devil could\nhave thought it! Her face--her way of talking! This will cut me up\nawfully. Of course, I'm sorry for you, too, but it was your plain duty\nto let me know what sort of a woman I had got hold of. Nay, it's she\nthat has got hold of me, confound her! I don't feel myself! I'm\nthoroughly knocked over!\"\n\nHilliard began humming an air. He crossed the room and sat down.\n\n\"Have you seen her since that Saturday?\"\n\n\"No; she has made excuses, and I guessed something was wrong. What has\nbeen going on? _You_ have seen her?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nNarramore glared.\n\n\"It's devilish underhand behaviour! Look here, old fellow, we're nut\ngoing to quarrel. No woman is worth a quarrel between two old friends.\nBut just speak out--can't you? What did you mean by keeping it from me?\"\n\n\"It meant that I had nothing to say,\" Hilliard replied, through his\nmoustache.\n\n\"You kept silence out of spite, then? You said to yourself, 'Let him\nmarry her and find out afterwards what she really is!'\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind.\" He looked up frankly. \"I saw no reason for\nspeaking. She accuses herself without a shadow of reason; it's mere\nhysterical conscientiousness. We have known each other for half a year\nor so, and I have made love to her, but I never had the least\nencouragement. I knew all along she didn't care for me. How is she to\nblame? A girl is under no obligation to speak of all the men who have\nwanted to marry her, provided she has done nothing to be ashamed of.\nThere's just one bit of insincerity. It's true she knew of you from me.\nBut she looked you up because she despaired of finding employment; she\nwas at an end of her money, didn't know what to do. I have heard this\nsince I saw you last. It wasn't quite straightforward, but one can\nforgive it in a girl hard driven by necessity.\"\n\nNarramore was listening with eagerness, his lips parted, and a growing\nhope in his eyes.\n\n\"There never was anything serious between you?\"\n\n\"On her side, never for a moment. I pursued and pestered her, that was\nall.\"\n\n\"Do you mind telling me who the girl was that I saw you with at Dudley?\"\n\n\"A friend of Miss Madeley's, over here from London on a holiday. I have\ntried to make use of her--to get her influence on my side----\"\n\nNarramore sprang from the corner of the table on which he had been\nsitting.\n\n\"Why couldn't she hold her tongue! That's just like a woman, to keep a\nthing quiet when she ought to speak of it, and bring it out when she\nhad far better say nothing. I feel as if I had treated you badly,\nHilliard. And the way you take it--I'd rather you eased your mind by\nswearing at me.\"\n\n\"I could swear hard enough. I could grip you by the throat and jump on\nyou----\"\n\n\"No, I'm hanged if you could!\" He forced a laugh. \"And I shouldn't\nadvise you to try. Here, give me your hand instead.\" He seized it.\n\"We're going to talk this over like two reasonable beings. Does this\ngirl know her own mind? It seems to me from this letter that she wants\nto get rid of me.\"\n\n\"You must find out whether she does or not.\"\n\n\"Do you _think_ she does?\"\n\n\"I refuse to think about it at all.\"\n\n\"You mean she isn't worth troubling about? Tell the truth, and be\nhanged to you! Is she the kind of a girl a man may marry?\"\n\n\"For all I know.\"\n\n\"Do you suspect her?\" Narramore urged fiercely.\n\n\"She'll marry a rich man rather than a poor one--that's the worst I\nthink of her.\"\n\n\"What woman won't?\"\n\nWhen question and answer had revolved about this point for another\nquarter of an hour, Hilliard brought the dialogue to an end. He was\nclay-colour, and perspiration stood on his forehead.\n\n\"You must make her out without any more help from me. I tell you the\nletter is all nonsense, and I can say no more.\"\n\nHe moved towards the exit.\n\n\"One thing I must know, Hilliard--Are you going to see her again?\"\n\n\"Never--if I can help it.\"\n\n\"Can we be friends still?\"\n\n\"If you never mention her name to me.\"\n\nAgain they shook hands, eyes crossing in a smile of shamed hostility.\nAnd the parting was for more than a twelvemonth.\n\nLate in August, when Hilliard was thinking of a week's rest in the\ncountry, after a spell of harder and more successful work than he had\never previously known, he received a letter from Patty Ringrose.\n\n\"Dear Mr. Hilliard,\" wrote the girl, \"I have just heard from Eve that\nshe is to be married to Mr. Narramore in a week's time. She says you\ndon't know about it; but I think you _ought_ to know. I haven't been\nable to make anything of her two last letters, but she has written\nplainly at last. Perhaps she means me to tell you. Will you let me have\na line? I should like to know whether you care much, and I do so hope\nyou don't! I felt sure it would come to this, and if you'll believe me,\nit's just as well. I haven't answered her letter, and I don't know\nwhether I shall. I might say disagreeable things. Everything is the\nsame with me and always will be, I suppose.\" In conclusion, she was his\nsincerely. A postscript remarked: \"They tell me I play better. I've\nbeen practising a great deal, just to kill the time.\"\n\n\"Dear Miss Ringrose,\" he responded, \"I am very glad to know that Eve is\nto be comfortably settled for life. By all means answer her letter, and\nby all means keep from saying disagreeable things. It is never wise to\nquarrel with prosperous friends, and why should you? With every good\nwish----\" he remained sincerely hers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n\nWhen Hilliard and his friend again shook hands it was the autumn of\nanother year. Not even by chance had they encountered in the interval\nand no written message had passed between them. Their meeting was at a\nhouse newly acquired by the younger of the Birching brothers, who,\nbeing about to marry, summoned his bachelor familiars to smoke their\npipes in the suburban abode while yet his rule there was undisputed.\nWith Narramore he had of late resumed the friendship interrupted by\nMiss Birching's displeasure, for that somewhat imperious young lady,\nnow the wife of an elderly ironmaster, moved in other circles; and\nHilliard's professional value, which was beginning to be recognised by\nthe Birchings otherwise than in the way of compliment, had overcome the\nrestraints at first imposed by his dubious social standing.\n\nThey met genially, without a hint of estrangement.\n\n\"Your wife well?\" Hilliard took an opportunity of asking apart.\n\n\"Thanks, she's getting all right again. At Llandudno just now. Glad to\nsee that you're looking so uncommonly fit.\"\n\nHilliard had undoubtedly improved in personal appearance. He grew a\nbeard, which added to his seeming age, but suited with his features;\nhis carriage was more upright than of old.\n\nA week or two after this, Narramore sent a friendly note--\n\n\"Shall I see you at Birching's on Sunday? My wife will be there, to\nmeet Miss Marks and some other people. Come if you can, old fellow. I\nshould take it as a great kindness.\"\n\nAnd Hilliard went. In the hall he was confronted by Narramore, who\nshook hands with him rather effusively, and said a few words in an\nundertone.\n\n\"She's out in the garden. Will be delighted to see you. Awfully good of\nyou, old boy! Had to come sooner or later, you know.\"\n\nNot quite assured of this necessity, and something less than composed,\nHilliard presently passed through the house into the large walled\ngarden behind it. Here he was confusedly aware of a group of ladies,\nnot one of whom, on drawing nearer, did he recognise. A succession of\nformalities discharged, he heard his friend's voice saying--\n\n\"Hilliard, let me introduce you to my wife.\"\n\nThere before him stood Eve. He had only just persuaded himself of her\nidentity; his eyes searched her countenance with wonder which barely\nallowed him to assume a becoming attitude. But Mrs. Narramore was\nperfect in society's drill. She smiled very sweetly, gave her hand,\nsaid what the occasion demanded. Among the women present--all well\nbred--she suffered no obscurement. Her voice was tuned to the\nappropriate harmony; her talk invited to an avoidance of the hackneyed.\n\nHilliard revived his memories of Gower Place--of the streets of Paris.\nNothing preternatural had come about; nothing that he had not\nforecasted in his hours of hope. But there were incidents in the past\nwhich this moment blurred away into the region of dreamland, and which\nhe shrank from the effort of reinvesting with credibility.\n\n\"This is a pleasant garden.\"\n\nEve had approached him as he stood musing, after a conversation with\nother ladies.\n\n\"Rather new, of course; but a year will do wonders. Have you seen the\nchrysanthemums?\"\n\nShe led him apart, as they stood regarding the flowers, Hilliard was\nsurprised by words that fell from her.\n\n\"Your contempt for me is beyond expression, isn't it?\"\n\n\"It is the last feeling I should associate with you,\" he answered.\n\n\"Oh, but be sincere. We have both learnt to speak another language--you\nno less than I. Let me hear a word such as you used to speak. I know\nyou despise me unutterably.\"\n\n\"You are quite mistaken. I admire you very much.\"\n\n\"What--my skill? Or my dress?\"\n\n\"Everything. You have become precisely what you were meant to be.\"\n\n\"Oh, the scorn of that!\"\n\n\"I beg you not to think it for a moment. There was a time when I might\nhave found a foolish pleasure in speaking to you with sarcasm. But that\nhas long gone by.\"\n\n\"What am I, then?\"\n\n\"An English lady--with rather more intellect than most.\"\n\nEve flushed with satisfaction.\n\n\"It's more than kind of you to say that. But you always had a generous\nspirit. I never thanked you. Not one poor word. I was cowardly--afraid\nto write. And you didn't care for my thanks.\"\n\n\"I do now.\"\n\n\"Then I thank you. With all my heart, again and again!\"\n\nHer voice trembled under fulness of meaning.\n\n\"You find life pleasant?\"\n\n\"You do, I hope?\" she answered, as they paced on.\n\n\"Not unpleasant, at all events. I am no longer slaving under the iron\ngods. I like my work, and it promises to reward me.\"\n\nEve made a remark about a flower-bed. Then her voice subdued again.\n\n\"How do you look back on your great venture--your attempt to make the\nmost that could be made of a year in your life?\"\n\n\"Quite contentedly. It was worth doing, and is worth remembering.\"\n\n\"Remember, if you care to,\" Eve resumed, \"that all I am and have I owe\nto you. I was all but lost--all but a miserable captive for the rest of\nmy life. You came and ransomed me. A less generous man would have\nspoilt his work at the last moment. But you were large minded enough to\nsupport my weakness till I was safe.\"\n\nHilliard smiled for answer.\n\n\"You and Robert are friends again?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\nShe turned, and they rejoined the company.\n\nA week later Hilliard went down into the country, to a quiet spot where\nhe now and then refreshed his mind after toil in Birmingham. He slept\nat a cottage, and on the Sunday morning walked idly about the lanes.\n\nA white frost had suddenly hastened the slow decay of mellow autumn.\nLow on the landscape lay a soft mist, dense enough to conceal\neverything at twenty yards away, but suffused with golden sunlight;\noverhead shone the clear blue sky. Roadside trees and hedges, their\nrich tints softened by the medium through which they were discerned,\nthrew shadows of exquisite faintness. A perfect quiet possessed the\nair, but from every branch, as though shaken by some invisible hand,\ndead foliage dropped to earth in a continuous shower; softly pattering\nfrom beech to maple, or with the heavier fall of ash-leaves, while at\nlong intervals sounded the thud of apples tumbling from a crab-tree.\nThick-clustered berries arrayed the hawthorns, the briar was rich in\nscarlet fruit; everywhere the frost had left the adornment of its\nsubtle artistry. Each leaf upon the hedge shone silver-outlined;\nspiders' webs, woven from stein to stem, glistened in the morning\nradiance; the grasses by the way side stood stark in gleaming mail.\n\nAnd Maurice Hilliard, a free man in his own conceit, sang to himself a\nsong of the joy of life.\n\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Eve's Ransom, by George Gissing\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK EVE'S RANSOM ***\n\n***** This file should be named 4297.txt or 4297.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/4\/2\/9\/4297\/\n\nProduced by Charles Aldarondo.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":407,"split":"train"}
