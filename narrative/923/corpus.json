Poor Polly is overwhelmed by the splendor at the Shaws' and their urbanized, fashionable lifestyles, expensive clothes and other habits she has never been exposed to, and, for the most part, dislikes. Fanny's friends ignore her because of her different behavior and simple clothing, Fanny's brother Tom teases her, and Fan herself can't help considering her unusual sometimes. However, Polly's warmth, support and kindness eventually win the hearts of all the family members, and her old-fashioned ways teach them a lesson.\nOver the next six years, Polly visits the Shaws every year and comes to be considered a member of the family. Later, Polly comes back to the city to become a music teacher and struggles with professional issues and internal emotions. Later in the book, Polly finds out that the prosperous Shaws are on the brink of bankruptcy, and she guides them to the realization that a wholesome family life is the only thing they will ever need, not money or decoration.\nWith the comfort of the ever helpful Polly, the family gets to change for the better and to find a happier life for all of them. After being rejected by his fianc\u0102\u0160e, Trix, Tom procures a job out West, with Polly's brother Ned, and heads off to help his family and compensate for all the money he has wasted in frivolous expenditures. At that point of the book, we see that Polly and Tom seem to have developed strong feelings for one another.\nAt the end of the book, Tom returns from the West and finally gets engaged to his true love, Polly.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of An Old-fashioned Girl, by Louisa May Alcott\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Alcott\n\n\n\n\nPreface\n\nAS a preface is the only place where an author can with propriety\nexplain a purpose or apologize for shortcomings, I venture to avail\nmyself of the privilege to make a statement for the benefit of my\nreaders.\n\nAs the first part of \"An Old-Fashioned Girl\" was written in 1869, the\ndemand for a sequel, in beseeching little letters that made refusal\nimpossible, rendered it necessary to carry my heroine boldly forward\nsome six or seven years into the future. The domestic nature of the\nstory makes this audacious proceeding possible; while the lively fancies\nof my young readers will supply all deficiencies, and overlook all\ndiscrepancies.\n\nThis explanation will, I trust, relieve those well-regulated minds,\nwho cannot conceive of such literary lawlessness, from the bewilderment\nwhich they suffered when the same experiment was tried in a former book.\n\nThe \"Old-Fashioned Girl\" is not intended as a perfect model, but as\na possible improvement upon [Page] the Girl of the Period, who seems\nsorrowfully ignorant or ashamed of the good old fashions which make\nwoman truly beautiful and honored, and, through her, render home what\nit should be,-a happy place, where parents and children, brothers and\nsisters, learn to love and know and help one another.\n\nIf the history of Polly's girlish experiences suggests a hint or\ninsinuates a lesson, I shall feel that, in spite of many obstacles, I\nhave not entirely neglected my duty toward the little men and women, for\nwhom it is an honor and a pleasure to write, since in them I have always\nfound my kindest patrons, gentlest critics, warmest friends.\n\nL.

POLLY ARRIVES\n\n\n\"IT'S time to go to the station, Tom.\"\n\n\"Come on, then.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm not going; it's too wet. Should n't have a crimp left if I\nwent out such a day as this; and I want to look nice when Polly comes.\"\n\n\"You don't expect me to go and bring home a strange girl alone, do you?\"\nAnd Tom looked as much alarmed as if his sister had proposed to him to\nescort the wild woman of Australia.\n\n\"Of course I do. It's your place to go and get her; and if you was n't\na bear, you'd like it.\"\n\n\"Well, I call that mean! I supposed I'd got to go; but you said you'd\ngo, too. Catch me bothering about your friends another time! No, sir!\"\nAnd Tom rose from the sofa with an air of indignant resolution, the\nimpressive effect of which was somewhat damaged by a tousled head, and\nthe hunched appearance of his garments generally.\n\n\"Now, don't be cross; and I'll get mamma to let you have that horrid\nNed Miller, that you are so fond of, come and make you a visit after\nPolly's gone,\" said Fanny, hoping to soothe his ruffled feelings.\n\n\"How long is she going to stay?\" demanded Tom, making his toilet by a\npromiscuous shake.\n\n\"A month or two, maybe. She's ever so nice; and I shall keep her as\nlong as she's happy.\"\n\n\"She won't stay long then, if I can help it,\" muttered Tom, who regarded\ngirls as a very unnecessary portion of creation. Boys of fourteen are\napt to think so, and perhaps it is a wise arrangement; for, being fond\nof turning somersaults, they have an opportunity of indulging in a good\none, metaphorically speaking, when, three or four years later, they\nbecome the abject slaves of \"those bothering girls.\"\n\n\"Look here! how am I going to know the creature? I never saw her, and\nshe never saw me. You'll have to come too, Fan,\" he added, pausing on\nhis way to the door, arrested by the awful idea that he might have to\naddress several strange girls before he got the right one.\n\n\"You'll find her easy enough; she'll probably be standing round\nlooking for us. I dare say she'll know you, though I'm not there,\nbecause I've described you to her.\"\n\n\"Guess she won't, then;\" and Tom gave a hasty smooth to his curly pate\nand a glance at the mirror, feeling sure that his sister had n't done\nhim justice. Sisters never do, as \"we fellows\" know too well.\n\n\"Do go along, or you'll be too late; and then, what will Polly think\nof me?\" cried Fanny, with the impatient poke which is peculiarly\naggravating to masculine dignity.\n\n\"She'll think you cared more about your frizzles than your friends, and\nshe'll be about right, too.\"\n\nFeeling that he said rather a neat and cutting thing, Tom sauntered\nleisurely away, perfectly conscious that it was late, but bent on not\nbeing hurried while in sight, though he ran himself off his legs to make\nup for it afterward.\n\n\"If I was the President, I'd make a law to shut up all boys till they\nwere grown; for they certainly are the most provoking toads in the\nworld,\" said Fanny, as she watched the slouchy figure of her brother\nstrolling down the street. She might have changed her mind, however,\nif she had followed him, for as soon as he turned the corner, his whole\naspect altered; his hands came out of his pockets, he stopped whistling,\nbuttoned his jacket, gave his cap a pull, and went off at a great pace.\n\nThe train was just in when he reached the station, panting like a\nrace-horse, and as red as a lobster with the wind and the run.\n\n\"Suppose she'll wear a top-knot and a thingumbob, like every one else;\nand however shall I know her? Too bad of Fan to make me come alone!\"\nthought Tom, as he stood watching the crowd stream through the depot,\nand feeling rather daunted at the array of young ladies who passed. As\nnone of them seemed looking for any one, he did not accost them, but\neyed each new batch with the air of a martyr. \"That's her,\" he said\nto himself, as he presently caught sight of a girl in gorgeous array,\nstanding with her hands folded, and a very small hat perched on the top\nof a very large \"chig-non,\" as Tom pronounced it. \"I suppose I've got\nto speak to her, so here goes;\" and, nerving himself to the task, Tom\nslowly approached the damsel, who looked as if the wind had blown her\nclothes into rags, such a flapping of sashes, scallops, ruffles, curls,\nand feathers was there.\n\n\"I say, if you please, is your name Polly Milton?\" meekly asked Tom,\npausing before the breezy stranger.\n\n\"No, it is n't,\" answered the young lady, with a cool stare that utterly\nquenched him.\n\n\"Where in thunder is she?\" growled Tom, walking off in high dudgeon. The\nquick tap of feet behind him made him turn in time to see a fresh-faced\nlittle girl running down the long station, and looking as if she rather\nliked it. As she smiled, and waved her bag at him, he stopped and waited\nfor her, saying to himself, \"Hullo! I wonder if that's Polly?\"\n\nUp came the little girl, with her hand out, and a half-shy, half-merry\nlook in her blue eyes, as she said, inquiringly, \"This is Tom, is n't\nit?\"\n\n\"Yes. How did you know?\" and Tom got over the ordeal of hand-shaking\nwithout thinking of it, he was so surprised.\n\n\"Oh, Fan told me you'd got curly hair, and a funny nose, and kept\nwhistling, and wore a gray cap pulled over your eyes; so I knew you\ndirectly.\" And Polly nodded at him in the most friendly manner, having\npolitely refrained from calling the hair \"red,\" the nose \"a pug,\" and\nthe cap \"old,\" all of which facts Fanny had carefully impressed upon her\nmemory.\n\n\"Where are your trunks?\" asked Tom, as he was reminded of his duty by\nher handing him the bag, which he had not offered to take.\n\n\"Father told me not to wait for any one, else I'd lose my chance of a\nhack; so I gave my check to a man, and there he is with my trunk;\" and\nPolly walked off after her one modest piece of baggage, followed by Tom,\nwho felt a trifle depressed by his own remissness in polite attentions.\n\"She is n't a bit of a young lady, thank goodness! Fan did n't tell me\nshe was pretty. Don't look like city girls, nor act like'em, neither,\"\nhe thought, trudging in the rear, and eyeing with favor the brown curls\nbobbing along in front.\n\nAs the carriage drove off, Polly gave a little bounce on the springy\nseat, and laughed like a delighted child. \"I do like to ride in these\nnice hacks, and see all the fine things, and have a good time, don't\nyou?\" she said, composing herself the next minute, as if it suddenly\noccurred to her that she was going a-visiting.\n\n\"Not much,\" said Tom, not minding what he said, for the fact that he was\nshut up with the strange girl suddenly oppressed his soul.\n\n\"How's Fan? Why did n't she come, too?\" asked Polly, trying to look\ndemure, while her eyes danced in spite of her.\n\n\"Afraid of spoiling her crinkles;\" and Tom smiled, for this base\nbetrayal of confidence made him feel his own man again.\n\n\"You and I don't mind dampness. I'm much obliged to you for coming to\ntake care of me.\"\n\nIt was kind of Polly to say that, and Tom felt it; for his red crop was\na tender point, and to be associated with Polly's pretty brown curls\nseemed to lessen its coppery glow. Then he had n't done anything for her\nbut carry the bag a few steps; yet, she thanked him. He felt grateful,\nand in a burst of confidence, offered a handful of peanuts, for his\npockets were always supplied with this agreeable delicacy, and he might\nbe traced anywhere by the trail of shells he left behind him.\n\nAs soon as he had done it, he remembered that Fanny considered them\nvulgar, and felt that he had disgraced his family. So he stuck his\nhead out of the window, and kept it there so long, that Polly asked if\nanything was the matter. \"Pooh! who cares for a countrified little thing\nlike her,\" said Tom manfully to himself; and then the spirit of mischief\nentered in and took possession of him.\n\n\"He's pretty drunk; but I guess he can hold his horses,\" replied this\nevil-minded boy, with an air of calm resignation.\n\n\"Is the man tipsy? Oh, dear! let's get out! Are the horses bad? It's\nvery steep here; do you think it's safe?\" cried poor Polly, making a\ncocked hat of her little beaver, by thrusting it out of the half-open\nwindow on her side.\n\n\"There's plenty of folks to pick us up if anything happens; but perhaps\nit would be safer if I got out and sat with the man;\" and Tom quite\nbeamed with the brilliancy of this sudden mode of relief.\n\n\"Oh, do, if you ain't afraid! Mother would be so anxious if anything\nshould happen to me, so far away!\" cried Polly, much distressed.\n\n\"Don't you be worried. I'll manage the old chap, and the horses too;\"\nand opening the door, Tom vanished aloft, leaving poor victimized Polly\nto quake inside, while he placidly revelled in freedom and peanuts\noutside, with the staid old driver.\n\nFanny came flying down to meet her \"darling Polly,\" as Tom presented\nher, with the graceful remark, \"I've got her!\" and the air of a\ndauntless hunter, producing the trophies of his skill. Polly was\ninstantly whisked up stairs; and having danced a double-shuffle on the\ndoor-mat, Tom retired to the dining-room, to restore exhausted nature\nwith half a dozen cookies.\n\n\"Ain't you tired to death? Don't you want to lie down?\" said Fanny,\nsitting on the side of the bed in Polly's room, and chattering hard,\nwhile she examined everything her friend had on.\n\n\"Not a bit. I had a nice time coming, and no trouble, except the tipsy\ncoachman; but Tom got out and kept him in order, so I was n't much\nfrightened,\" answered innocent Polly, taking off her rough-and-ready\ncoat, and the plain hat without a bit of a feather.\n\n\"Fiddlestick! he was n't tipsy; and Tom only did it to get out of the\nway. He can't bear girls,\" said Fanny, with a superior air.\n\n\"Can't he? Why, I thought he was very pleasant and kind!\" and Polly\nopened her eyes with a surprised expression.\n\n\"He's an awful boy, my dear; and if you have anything to do with\nhim, he'll torment you to death. Boys are all horrid; but he's the\nhorridest one I ever saw.\"\n\nFanny went to a fashionable school, where the young ladies were so busy\nwith their French, German, and Italian, that there was no time for\ngood English. Feeling her confidence much shaken in the youth, Polly\nprivately resolved to let him alone, and changed the conversation, by\nsaying, as she looked admiringly about the large, handsome room, \"How\nsplendid it is! I never slept in a bed with curtains before, or had such\na fine toilet-table as this.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you like it; but don't, for mercy sake, say such things\nbefore the other girls!\" replied Fanny, wishing Polly would wear\near-rings, as every one else did.\n\n\"Why not?\" asked the country mouse of the city mouse, wondering what\nharm there was in liking other people's pretty things, and saying\nso. \"Oh, they laugh at everything the least bit odd, and that is n't\npleasant.\" Fanny did n't say \"countrified,\" but she meant it, and Polly\nfelt uncomfortable. So she shook out her little black silk apron with\na thoughtful face, and resolved not to allude to her own home, if she\ncould help it.\n\n\"I'm so poorly, mamma says I need n't go to school regularly, while you\nare here, only two or three times a week, just to keep up my music and\nFrench. You can go too, if you like; papa said so. Do, it's such fun!\"\ncried Fanny, quite surprising her friend by this unexpected fondness for\nschool.\n\n\"I should be afraid, if all the girls dress as finely as you do, and\nknow as much,\" said Polly, beginning to feel shy at the thought.\n\n\"La, child! you need n't mind that. I'll take care of you, and fix you\nup, so you won't look odd.\"\n\n\"Am I odd?\" asked Polly, struck by the word and hoping it did n't mean\nanything very bad.\n\n\"You are a dear, and ever so much prettier than you were last summer,\nonly you've been brought up differently from us; so your ways ain't\nlike ours, you see,\" began Fanny, finding it rather hard to explain.\n\n\"How different?\" asked Polly again, for she liked to understand things.\n\n\"Well, you dress like a little girl, for one thing.\"\n\n\"I am a little girl; so why should n't I?\" and Polly looked at her\nsimple blue merino frock, stout boots, and short hair, with a puzzled\nair.\n\n\"You are fourteen; and we consider ourselves young ladies at that age,\"\ncontinued Fanny, surveying, with complacency, the pile of hair on the\ntop of her head, with a fringe of fuzz round her forehead, and a wavy\nlock streaming down her back; likewise, her scarlet-and-black suit, with\nits big sash, little pannier, bright buttons, points, rosettes, and,\nheaven knows what. There was a locket on her neck, ear-rings tinkling\nin her ears, watch and chain at her belt, and several rings on a pair of\nhands that would have been improved by soap and water.\n\nPolly's eye went from one little figure to the other, and she thought\nthat Fanny looked the oddest of the two; for Polly lived in a quiet\ncountry town, and knew very little of city fashions. She was rather\nimpressed by the elegance about her, never having seen Fanny's home\nbefore, as they got acquainted while Fanny paid a visit to a friend who\nlived near Polly. But she did n't let the contrast between herself and\nFan trouble her; for in a minute she laughed and said, contentedly, \"My\nmother likes me to dress simply, and I don't mind. I should n't know\nwhat to do rigged up as you are. Don't you ever forget to lift your sash\nand fix those puffy things when you sit down?\"\n\nBefore Fanny could answer, a scream from below made both listen. \"It\n's only Maud; she fusses all day long,\" began Fanny; and the words were\nhardly out of her mouth, when the door was thrown open, and a little\ngirl, of six or seven, came roaring in. She stopped at sight of Polly,\nstared a minute, then took up her roar just where she left it, and cast\nherself into Fanny's lap, exclaiming wrathfully, \"Tom's laughing at me!\nMake him stop!\"\n\n\"What did you do to set him going? Don't scream so, you'll frighten\nPolly!\" and Fan gave the cherub a shake, which produced an explanation.\n\n\"I only said we had cold cweam at the party, last night, and he\nlaughed!\"\n\n\"Ice-cream, child!\" and Fanny followed Tom's reprehensible example.\n\n\"I don't care! it was cold; and I warmed mine at the wegister, and then\nit was nice; only, Willy Bliss spilt it on my new Gabwielle!\" and Maud\nwailed again over her accumulated woes.\n\n\"Do go to Katy! You're as cross as a little bear to-day!\" said Fanny,\npushing her away.\n\n\"Katy don't amoose me; and I must be amoosed,'cause I'm fwactious;\nmamma said I was!\" sobbed Maud, evidently laboring under the delusion\nthat fractiousness was some interesting malady.\n\n\"Come down and have dinner; that will amuse you;\" and Fanny got up,\npluming herself as a bird does before its flight.\n\nPolly hoped the \"dreadful boy\" would not be present; but he was, and\nstared at her all dinner-time, in a most trying manner. Mr. Shaw, a\nbusy-looking gentleman, said, \"How do you do, my dear? Hope you'll\nenjoy yourself;\" and then appeared to forget her entirely. Mrs. Shaw, a\npale, nervous woman, greeted her little guest kindly, and took care that\nshe wanted for nothing. Madam Shaw, a quiet old lady, with an imposing\ncap, exclaimed on seeing Polly, \"Bless my heart! the image of her mother\na sweet woman how is she, dear?\" and kept peering at the new-comer over\nher glasses, till, between Madam and Tom, poor Polly lost her appetite.\n\nFanny chatted like a magpie, and Maud fidgeted, till Tom proposed to put\nher under the big dish-cover, which produced such an explosion, that the\nyoung lady was borne screaming away, by the much-enduring Katy. It was\naltogether an uncomfortable dinner, and Polly was very glad when it was\nover. They all went about their own affairs; and after doing the honors\nof the house, Fan was called to the dressmaker, leaving Polly to amuse\nherself in the great drawing-room.\n\nPolly was glad to be alone for a few minutes; and, having examined all\nthe pretty things about her, began to walk up and down over the soft,\nflowery carpet, humming to herself, as the daylight faded, and only the\nruddy glow of the fire filled the room. Presently Madam came slowly in,\nand sat down in her arm-chair, saying, \"That's a fine old tune; sing it\nto me, my dear. I have n't heard it this many a day.\" Polly did n't like\nto sing before strangers, for she had had no teaching but such as her\nbusy mother could give her; but she had been taught the utmost respect\nfor old people, and having no reason for refusing, she directly went to\nthe piano, and did as she was bid.\n\n\"That's the sort of music it's a pleasure to hear. Sing some more,\ndear,\" said Madam, in her gentle way, when she had done.\n\nPleased with this praise, Polly sang away in a fresh little voice, that\nwent straight to the listener's heart and nestled there. The sweet\nold tunes that one is never tired of were all Polly's store; and her\nfavorites were Scotch airs, such as, \"Yellow-Haired Laddie,\" \"Jock o'\nHazeldean,\" \"Down among the Heather,\" and \"Birks of Aberfeldie.\" The\nmore she sung, the better she did it; and when she wound up with \"A\nHealth to King Charlie,\" the room quite rung with the stirring music\nmade by the big piano and the little maid.\n\n\"By George, that's a jolly tune! Sing it again, please,\" cried Tom's\nvoice; and there was Tom's red head bobbing up over the high back of the\nchair where he had hidden himself.\n\nIt gave Polly quite a turn, for she thought no one was hearing her but\nthe old lady dozing by the fire. \"I can't sing any more; I'm tired,\"\nshe said, and walked away to Madam in the other room. The red head\nvanished like a meteor, for Polly's tone had been decidedly cool.\n\nThe old lady put out her hand, and drawing Polly to her knee, looked\ninto her face with such kind eyes, that Polly forgot the impressive cap,\nand smiled at her confidingly; for she saw that her simple music had\npleased her listener, and she felt glad to know it.\n\n\"You must n't mind my staring, dear,\" said Madam, softly pinching her\nrosy cheek. \"I have n't seen a little girl for so long, it does my old\neyes good to look at you.\"\n\nPolly thought that a very odd speech, and could n't help saying, \"Are\nn't Fan and Maud little girls, too?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, no! not what I call little girls. Fan has been a young\nlady this two years, and Maud is a spoiled baby. Your mother's a very\nsensible woman, my child.\"\n\n\"What a very queer old lady!\" thought Polly; but she said \"Yes'm\"\nrespectfully, and looked at the fire.\n\n\"You don't understand what I mean, do you?\" asked Madam, still holding\nher by the chin.\n\n\"No'm; not quite.\"\n\n\"Well, dear, I'll tell you. In my day, children of fourteen and fifteen\ndid n't dress in the height of the fashion; go to parties, as nearly\nlike those of grown people as it's possible to make them; lead idle,\ngiddy, unhealthy lives, and get blas\u00c3\u00a9 at twenty. We were little folks\ntill eighteen or so; worked and studied, dressed and played, like\nchildren; honored our parents; and our days were much longer in the land\nthan now, it seems to, me.\"\n\nThe old lady appeared to forget Polly at the end of her speech; for she\nsat patting the plump little hand that lay in her own, and looking up at\na faded picture of an old gentleman with a ruffled shirt and a queue.\n\n\"Was he your father, Madam?\n\n\"Yes, dear; my honored father. I did up his frills to the day of his\ndeath; and the first money I ever earned was five dollars which\nhe offered as a prize to whichever of his six girls would lay the\nhandsomest darn in his silk stockings.\"\n\n\"How proud you must have been!\" cried Polly, leaning on the old lady's\nknee with an interested face.\n\n\"Yes, and we all learned to make bread, and cook, and wore little\nchintz gowns, and were as gay and hearty as kittens. All lived to be\ngrandmothers and fathers; and I'm the last, seventy, next birthday,\nmy dear, and not worn out yet; though daughter Shaw is an invalid at\nforty.\"\n\n\"That's the way I was brought up, and that's why Fan calls me\nold-fashioned, I suppose. Tell more about your papa, please; I like it,\"\nsaid Polly.\n\n\"Say'father.' We never called him papa; and if one of my brothers had\naddressed him as'governor,' as boys do now, I really think he'd have\nhim cut off with a shilling.\"\n\nMadam raised her voice in saying this, and nodded significantly; but a\nmild snore from the other room seemed to assure her that it was a waste\nof shot to fire in that direction.\n\nBefore she could continue, in came Fanny with the joyful news that\nClara Bird had invited them both to go to the theatre with her that very\nevening, and would call for them at seven o'clock. Polly was so excited\nby this sudden plunge into the dissipations of city life, that she flew\nabout like a distracted butterfly, and hardly knew what happened, till\nshe found herself seated before the great green curtain in the brilliant\ntheatre. Old Mr. Bird sat on one side, Fanny on the other, and both let\nher alone, for which she was very grateful, as her whole attention was\nso absorbed in the scene around her, that she could n't talk.\n\nPolly had never been much to the theatre; and the few plays she had\nseen were the good old fairy tales, dramatized to suit young beholders,\nlively, bright, and full of the harmless nonsense which brings the laugh\nwithout the blush. That night she saw one of the new spectacles which\nhave lately become the rage, and run for hundreds of nights, dazzling,\nexciting, and demoralizing the spectator by every allurement French\ningenuity can invent, and American prodigality execute. Never mind what\nits name was, it was very gorgeous, very vulgar, and very fashionable;\nso, of course, it was much admired, and every one went to see it. At\nfirst, Polly thought she had got into fairy-land, and saw only the\nsparkling creatures who danced and sung in a world of light and beauty;\nbut, presently, she began to listen to the songs and conversation, and\nthen the illusion vanished; for the lovely phantoms sang negro melodies,\ntalked slang, and were a disgrace to the good old-fashioned elves whom\nshe knew and loved so well.\n\nOur little girl was too innocent to understand half the jokes, and often\nwondered what people were laughing at; but, as the first enchantment\nsubsided, Polly began to feel uncomfortable, to be sure her mother\nwould n't like to have her there, and to wish she had n't come. Somehow,\nthings seemed to get worse and worse, as the play went on; for our small\nspectator was being rapidly enlightened by the gossip going on all\nabout her, as well as by her own quick eyes and girlish instincts.\nWhen four-and-twenty girls, dressed as jockeys, came prancing on to the\nstage, cracking their whips, stamping the heels of their topboots, and\nwinking at the audience, Polly did not think it at all funny, but\nlooked disgusted, and was glad when they were gone; but when another\nset appeared in a costume consisting of gauze wings, and a bit of gold\nfringe round the waist, poor unfashionable Polly did n't know what to\ndo; for she felt both frightened and indignant, and sat with her eyes on\nher play-bill, and her cheeks getting hotter and hotter every minute.\n\n\"What are you blushing so for?\" asked Fanny, as the painted sylphs\nvanished.\n\n\"I'm so ashamed of those girls,\" whispered Polly, taking a long breath\nof relief.\n\n\"You little goose, it's just the way it was done in Paris, and the\ndancing is splendid. It seems queer at first; but you'll get used to\nit, as I did.\"\n\n\"I'll never come again,\" said Polly, decidedly; for her innocent nature\nrebelled against the spectacle, which, as yet, gave her more pain than\npleasure. She did not know how easy it was to \"get used to it,\" as Fanny\ndid; and it was well for her that the temptation was not often offered.\nShe could not explain the feeling; but she was glad when the play was\ndone, and they were safe at home, where kind grandma was waiting to see\nthem comfortably into bed.\n\n\"Did you have a good time, dear?\" she asked, looking at Polly's feverish\ncheeks and excited eyes.\n\n\"I don't wish to be rude, but I did n't,\" answered Polly. \"Some of it\nwas splendid; but a good deal of it made me want to go under the seat.\nPeople seemed to like it, but I don't think it was proper.\"\n\nAs Polly freed her mind, and emphasized her opinion with a decided rap\nof the boot she had just taken off, Fanny laughed, and said, while\nshe pirouetted about the room, like Mademoiselle Therese, \"Polly was\nshocked, grandma. Her eyes were as big as saucers, her face as red as\nmy sash, and once I thought she was going to cry. Some of it was rather\nqueer; but, of course, it was proper, or all our set would n't go. I\nheard Mrs. Smythe Perkins say, 'It was charming; so like dear Paris;'\nand she has lived abroad; so, of course, she knows what is what.\"\n\n\"I don't care if she has. I know it was n't proper for little girls\nto see, or I should n't have been so ashamed!\" cried sturdy Polly,\nperplexed, but not convinced, even by Mrs. Smythe Perkins.\n\n\"I think you are right, my dear; but you have lived in the country, and\nhave n't yet learned that modesty has gone out of fashion.\" And with a\ngood-night kiss, grandma left Polly to dream dreadfully of dancing in\njockey costume, on a great stage; while Tom played a big drum in the\norchestra; and the audience all wore the faces of her father and mother,\nlooking sorrowfully at her, with eyes like saucers, and faces as red as\nFanny's sash.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. NEW FASHIONS\n\n\n\"I'M going to school this morning; so come up and get ready,\" said\nFanny, a day or two after, as she left the late breakfast-table.\n\n\"You look very nice; what have you got to do?\" asked Polly, following\nher into the hall.\n\n\"Prink half an hour, and put on her wad,\" answered the irreverent Tom,\nwhose preparations for school consisted in flinging his cap on to his\nhead, and strapping up several big books, that looked as if they were\nsometimes used as weapons of defence.\n\n\"What is a wad?\" asked Polly, while Fanny marched up without deigning\nany reply.\n\n\"Somebody's hair on the top of her head in the place where it ought not\nto be;\" and Tom went whistling away with an air of sublime indifference\nas to the state of his own \"curly pow.\"\n\n\"Why must you be so fine to go to school?\" asked Polly, watching Fan\narrange the little frizzles on her forehead, and settle the various\nstreamers and festoons belonging to her dress.\n\n\"All the girls do; and it's proper, for you never know who you may\nmeet. I'm going to walk, after my lessons, so I wish you'd wear your\nbest hat and sack,\" answered Fanny, trying to stick her own hat on at an\nangle which defied all the laws of gravitation.\n\n\"I will, if you don't think this is nice enough. I like the other best,\nbecause it has a feather; but this is warmer, so I wear it every day.\"\nAnd Polly ran into her own room, to prink also, fearing that her friend\nmight be ashamed of her plain costume. \"Won't your hands be cold in kid\ngloves?\" she said, as they went down the snowy street, with a north wind\nblowing in their faces.\n\n\"Yes, horrid cold; but my muff is so big, I won't carry it. Mamma won't\nhave it cut up, and my ermine one must be kept for best;\" and Fanny\nsmoothed her Bismark kids with an injured air.\n\n\"I suppose my gray squirrel is ever so much too big; but it's nice and\ncosy, and you may warm your hands in it if you want to,\" said Polly,\nsurveying her new woollen gloves with a dissatisfied look, though she\nhad thought them quite elegant before.\n\n\"Perhaps I will, by and by. Now, Polly, don't you be shy. I'll only\nintroduce two or three of the girls; and you need n't mind old Monsieur\na bit, or read if you don't want to. We shall be in the anteroom; so you\n'll only see about a dozen, and they will be so busy, they won't mind\nyou much.\"\n\n\"I guess I won't read, but sit and look on. I like to watch people,\neverything is so new and queer here.\"\n\nBut Polly did feel and look very shy, when she was ushered into a room\nfull of young ladies, as they seemed to her, all very much dressed, all\ntalking together, and all turning to examine the new-comer with a cool\nstare which seemed to be as much the fashion as eye-glasses. They nodded\naffably when Fanny introduced her, said something civil, and made room\nfor her at the table round which they sat waiting for Monsieur. Several\nof the more frolicsome were imitating the Grecian Bend, some were\nputting their heads together over little notes, nearly all were eating\nconfectionery, and the entire twelve chattered like magpies. Being\npolitely supplied with caramels, Polly sat looking and listening,\nfeeling very young and countrified among these elegant young ladies.\n\n\"Girls, do you know that Carrie has gone abroad? There has been so much\ntalk, her father could n't bear it, and took the whole family off. Is\nn't that gay?\" said one lively damsel, who had just come in.\n\n\"I should think they'd better go. My mamma says, if I'd been going to\nthat school, she'd have taken me straight away,\" answered another girl,\nwith an important air.\n\n\"Carrie ran away with an Italian music-teacher, and it got into the\npapers, and made a great stir,\" explained the first speaker to Polly,\nwho looked mystified.\n\n\"How dreadful!\" cried Polly.\n\n\"I think it was fun. She was only sixteen, and he was perfectly\nsplendid; and she has plenty of money, and every one talked about it;\nand when she went anywhere, people looked, you know, and she liked it;\nbut her papa is an old poke, so he's sent them all away. It's too bad,\nfor she was the jolliest thing I ever knew.\"\n\nPolly had nothing to say to lively Miss Belle; but Fanny observed, \"I\nlike to read about such things; but it's so inconvenient to have it\nhappen right here, because it makes it harder for us. I wish you could\nhave heard my papa go on. He threatened to send a maid to school with me\nevery day, as they do in New York, to be sure I come all right. Did you\never?\" \"That's because it came out that Carrie used to forge excuses in\nher mamma's name, and go promenading with her Oreste, when they thought\nher safe at school. Oh, was n't she a sly minx?\" cried Belle, as if she\nrather admired the trick.\n\n\"I think a little fun is all right; and there's no need of making a\ntalk, if, now and then, some one does run off like Carrie. Boys do\nas they like; and I don't see why girls need to be kept so dreadfully\nclose. I'd like to see anybody watching and guarding me!\" added another\ndashing young lady.\n\n\"It would take a policeman to do that, Trix, or a little man in a tall\nhat,\" said Fanny, slyly, which caused a general laugh, and made Beatrice\ntoss her head coquettishly.\n\n\"Oh, have you read 'The Phantom Bride'? It's perfectly thrilling! There\n's a regular rush for it at the library; but some prefer 'Breaking a\nButterfly.' Which do you like best?\" asked a pale girl of Polly, in one\nof the momentary lulls which occurred.\n\n\"I have n't read either.\"\n\n\"You must, then. I adore Guy Livingston's books, and Yates's. 'Ouida's'\nare my delight, only they are so long, I get worn out before I'm\nthrough.\"\n\n\"I have n't read anything but one of the Muhlbach novels since I came. I\nlike those, because there is history in them,\" said Polly, glad to have\na word to say for herself.\n\n\"Those are well enough for improving reading; but I like real exciting\nnovels; don't you?\"\n\nPolly was spared the mortification of owning that she had never read\nany, by the appearance of Monsieur, a gray-headed old Frenchman, who\nwent through his task with the resigned air of one who was used to being\nthe victim of giggling school-girls. The young ladies gabbled over the\nlesson, wrote an exercise, and read a little French history. But it did\nnot seem to make much impression upon them, though Monsieur was very\nready to explain; and Polly quite blushed for her friend, when, on\nbeing asked what famous Frenchman fought in our Revolution, she answered\nLamartine, instead of Lafayette.\n\nThe hour was soon over; and when Fan had taken a music lesson in another\nroom, while Polly looked on, it was time for recess. The younger girls\nwalked up and down the court, arm in arm, eating bread an butter; others\nstayed in the school-room to read and gossip; but Belle, Trix, and\nFanny went to lunch at a fashionable ice-cream saloon near by, and Polly\nmeekly followed, not daring to hint at the ginger-bread grandma had put\nin her pocket for luncheon. So the honest, brown cookies crumbled away\nin obscurity, while Polly tried to satisfy her hearty appetite on one\nice and three macaroons.\n\nThe girls seemed in great spirits, particularly after they were joined\nby a short gentleman with such a young face that Polly would have called\nhim a boy, if he had not worn a tall beaver. Escorted by this impressive\nyouth, Fanny left her unfortunate friends to return to school, and went\nto walk, as she called a slow promenade down the most crowded\nstreets. Polly discreetly fell behind, and amused herself looking\ninto shop-windows, till Fanny, mindful of her manners, even at such an\ninteresting time, took her into a picture gallery, and bade her enjoy\nthe works of art while they rested. Obedient Polly went through the room\nseveral times, apparently examining the pictures with the interest of a\nconnoisseur, and trying not to hear the mild prattle of the pair on the\nround seat. But she could n't help wondering what Fan found so absorbing\nin an account of a recent German, and why she need promise so solemnly\nnot to forget the concert that afternoon.\n\nWhen Fanny rose at last, Polly's tired face reproached her; and taking\na hasty leave of the small gentleman, she turned homeward, saying,\nconfidentially, as she put one hand in Polly's muff, \"Now, my dear, you\nmust n't say a word about Frank Moore, or papa will take my head off. I\ndon't care a bit for him, and he likes Trix; only they have quarrelled,\nand he wants to make her mad by flirting a little with me. I scolded him\nwell, and he promised to make up with her. We all go to the afternoon\nconcerts, and have a gay time, and Belle and Trix are to be there\nto-day; so just keep quiet, and everything will be all right.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it won't,\" began Polly, who, not being used to secrets,\nfound it very hard to keep even a small one.\n\n\"Don't worry, child. It's none of our business; so we can go and enjoy\nthe music, and if other people flirt, it won't be our fault,\" said\nFanny, impatiently.\n\n\"Of course not; but, then, if your father don't like you to do so, ought\nyou to go?\"\n\n\"I tell mamma, and she don't care. Papa is fussy, and grandma makes a\nstir about every blessed thing I do. You will hold your tongue, won't\nyou?\"\n\n\"Yes; I truly will; I never tell tales.\" And Polly kept her word,\nfeeling sure Fan did n't mean to deceive her father, since she told her\nmother everything.\n\n\"Who are you going with?\" asked Mrs. Shaw, when Fanny mentioned that it\nwas concert-day, just before three o'clock.\n\n\"Only Polly; she likes music, and it was so stormy I could n't go last\nweek, you know,\" answered Fan; adding, as they left the house again, \"If\nany one meets us on the way, I can't help it, can I?\"\n\n\"You can tell them not to, can't you?\"\n\n\"That's rude. Dear me! here's Belle's brother Gus he always goes. Is\nmy hair all right, and my hat?\"\n\nBefore Polly could answer, Mr. Gus joined them as a matter of course,\nand Polly soon found herself trotting on behind, feeling that things\nwere not \"all right,\" though she did n't know how to mend them. Being\nfond of music, she ignorantly supposed that every one else went for that\nalone, and was much disturbed by the whispering that went on among the\nyoung people round her. Belle and Trix were there in full dress; and, in\nthe pauses between different pieces, Messrs. Frank and Gus, with several\nother \"splendid fellows,\" regaled the young ladies with college gossip,\nand bits of news full of interest, to judge from the close attention\npaid to their eloquent remarks. Polly regarded these noble beings with\nawe, and they recognized her existence with the condescension of their\nsex; but they evidently considered her only \"a quiet little thing,\" and\nfinding her not up to society talk, blandly ignored the pretty child,\nand devoted themselves to the young ladies. Fortunately for Polly, she\nforgot all about them in her enjoyment of the fine music, which she felt\nrather than understood, and sat listening with such a happy face, that\nseveral true music-lovers watched her smilingly, for her heart gave a\nblithe welcome to the melody which put the little instrument in tune.\nIt was dusk when they went out, and Polly was much relieved to find the\ncarriage waiting for them, because playing third fiddle was not to her\ntaste, and she had had enough of it for one day.\n\n\"I'm glad those men are gone; they did worry me so talking, when I\nwanted to hear,\" said Polly, as they rolled away.\n\n\"Which did you like best?\" asked Fanny, with a languid air of\nsuperiority.\n\n\"The plain one, who did n't say much; he picked up my muff when it\ntumbled down, and took care of me in the crowd; the others did n't mind\nanything about me.\"\n\n\"They thought you were a little girl, I suppose.\"\n\n\"My mother says a real gentleman is as polite to a little girl as to a\nwoman; so I like Mr. Sydney best, because he was kind to me.\"\n\n\"What a sharp child you are, Polly. I should n't have thought you'd\nmind things like that,\" said Fanny, beginning to understand that there\nmay be a good deal of womanliness even in a little girl.\n\n\"I'm used to good manners, though I do live in the country,\" replied\nPolly, rather warmly, for she did n't like to be patronized even by her\nfriends.\n\n\"Grandma says your mother is a perfect lady, and you are just like her;\nso don't get in a passion with those poor fellows, and I'll see that\nthey behave better next time. Tom has no manners at all, and you don't\ncomplain of him,\" added Fan, with a laugh.\n\n\"I don't care if he has n't; he's a boy, and acts like one, and I can\nget on with him a great deal better than I can with those men.\"\n\nFanny was just going to take Polly to task for saying \"those men\"\nin such a disrespectful tone, when both were startled by a smothered\n\"Cock-a-doodle-doo!\" from under the opposite seat.\n\n\"It's Tom!\" cried Fanny; and with the words out tumbled that\nincorrigible boy, red in the face, and breathless with suppressed\nlaughter. Seating himself, he surveyed the girls as if well satisfied\nwith the success of his prank, and waiting to be congratulated upon it.\n\"Did you hear what we were saying?\" demanded Fanny, uneasily.\n\n\"Oh, did n't I, every word?\" And Tom exulted over them visibly.\n\n\"Did you ever see such a provoking toad, Polly? Now, I suppose you'll\ngo and tell papa a great story.\"\n\n\"P'r'aps I shall, and p'r'aps I shan't. How Polly did hop when I crowed!\nI heard her squeal, and saw her cuddle up her feet.\"\n\n\"And you heard us praise your manners, did n't you?\" asked Polly, slyly.\n\n\"Yes, and you liked'em; so I won't tell on you,\" said Tom, with a\nre-assuring nod.\n\n\"There's nothing to tell.\"\n\n\"Ain't there, though? What do you suppose the governor will say to you\ngirls going on so with those dandies? I saw you.\"\n\n\"What has the Governor of Massachusetts to do with us?\" asked Polly,\ntrying to look as if she meant what she said.\n\n\"Pooh! you know who I mean; so you need n't try to catch me up, as\ngrandma does.\"\n\n\"Tom, I'll make a bargain with you,\" cried Fanny, eagerly. \"It was\nn't my fault that Gus and Frank were there, and I could n't help their\nspeaking to me. I do as well as I can, and papa need n't be angry; for I\nbehave ever so much better than some of the girls. Don't I, Polly?\"\n\n\"Bargain?\" observed Tom, with an eye to business.\n\n\"If you won't go and make a fuss, telling what you'd no right to hear\nit was so mean to hide and listen; I should think you'd be ashamed\nof it! I'll help you tease for your velocipede, and won't say a word\nagainst it, when mamma and granny beg papa not to let you have it.\"\n\n\"Will you?\" and Tom paused to consider the offer in all its bearings.\n\n\"Yes, and Polly will help; won't you?\"\n\n\"I'd rather not have anything to do with it; but I'll be quiet, and\nnot do any harm.\"\n\n\"Why won't you?\" asked Tom, curiously.\n\n\"Because it seems like deceiving.\"\n\n\"Well, papa need n't be so fussy,\" said Fan, petulantly.\n\n\"After hearing about that Carrie, and the rest, I don't wonder he is\nfussy. Why don't you tell right out, and not do it any more, if he don't\nwant you to?\" said Polly, persuasively.\n\n\"Do you go and tell your father and mother everything right out?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do; and it saves ever so much trouble.\"\n\n\"Ain't you afraid of them?\"\n\n\"Of course I'm not. It's hard to tell sometimes; but it's so\ncomfortable when it's over.\"\n\n\"Let's!\" was Tom's brief advice.\n\n\"Mercy me! what a fuss about nothing!\" said Fanny, ready to cry with\nvexation.\n\n\"T is n't nothing. You know you are forbidden to go gallivanting round\nwith those chaps, and that's the reason you're in a pucker now. I\nwon't make any bargain, and I will tell,\" returned Tom, seized with a\nsudden fit of moral firmness.\n\n\"Will you if I promise never, never to do so any more?\" asked Fanny,\nmeekly; for when Thomas took matters into his own hands, his sister\nusually submitted in spite of herself.\n\n\"I'll think about it; and if you behave, maybe I won't do it at all. I\ncan watch you better than papa can; so, if you try it again, it's\nall up with you, miss,\" said Tom, finding it impossible to resist the\npleasure of tyrannizing a little when he got the chance.\n\n\"She won't; don't plague her any more, and she will be good to you when\nyou get into scrapes,\" answered Polly, with her arm round Fan.\n\n\"I never do; and if I did, I should n't ask a girl to help me out.\"\n\n\"Why not? I'd ask you in a minute, if I was in trouble,\" said Polly, in\nher confiding way.\n\n\"Would you? Well, I'd put you through, as sure as my name's Tom Shaw.\nNow, then, don't slip, Polly,\" and Mr. Thomas helped them out with\nunusual politeness, for that friendly little speech gratified him. He\nfelt that one person appreciated him; and it had a good effect upon\nmanners and temper made rough and belligerent by constant snubbing and\nopposition.\n\nAfter tea that evening, Fanny proposed that Polly should show her how\nto make molasses candy, as it was cook's holiday, and the coast would\nbe clear. Hoping to propitiate her tormentor, Fan invited Tom to join in\nthe revel, and Polly begged that Maud might sit up and see the fun;\nso all four descended to the big kitchen, armed with aprons, hammers,\nspoons, and pans, and Polly assumed command of the forces. Tom was set\nto cracking nuts, and Maud to picking out the meats, for the candy was\nto be \"tip-top.\" Fan waited on Polly cook, who hovered over the kettle\nof boiling molasses till her face was the color of a peony. \"Now, put\nin the nuts,\" she said at last; and Tom emptied his plate into the\nfoamy syrup, while the others watched with deep interest the mysterious\nconcoction of this well-beloved sweetmeat. \"I pour it into the buttered\npan, you see, and it cools, and then we can eat it,\" explained Polly,\nsuiting the action to the word.\n\n\"Why, it's all full of shells!\" exclaimed Maud, peering into the pan.\n\n\"Oh, thunder! I must have put'em in by mistake, and ate up the meats\nwithout thinking,\" said Tom, trying to conceal his naughty satisfaction,\nas the girls hung over the pan with faces full of disappointment and\ndespair.\n\n\"You did it on purpose, you horrid boy! I'll never let you have\nanything to do with my fun again!\" cried Fan, in a passion, trying to\ncatch and shake him, while he dodged and chuckled in high glee.\n\nMaud began to wail over her lost delight, and Polly gravely poked at the\nmess, which was quite spoilt. But her attention was speedily diverted\nby the squabble going on in the corner; for Fanny, forgetful of her\nyoung-ladyism and her sixteen years, had boxed Tom's ears, and Tom,\nresenting the insult, had forcibly seated her in the coal-hod, where he\nheld her with one hand while he returned the compliment with the\nother. Both were very angry, and kept twitting one another with every\naggravation they could invent, as they scolded and scuffled, presenting\na most unlovely spectacle.\n\nPolly was not a model girl by any means, and had her little pets and\ntempers like the rest of us; but she did n't fight, scream, and squabble\nwith her brothers and sisters in this disgraceful way, and was much\nsurprised to see her elegant friend in such a passion. \"Oh, don't!\nPlease, don't! You'll hurt her, Tom! Let him go, Fanny! It's no matter\nabout the candy; we can make some more!\" cried Polly, trying to part\nthem, and looking so distressed, that they stopped ashamed, and in a\nminute sorry that she should see such a display of temper.\n\n\"I ain't going to be hustled round; so you'd better let me alone, Fan,\"\nsaid Tom, drawing off with a threatening wag of the head, adding, in\na different tone, \"I only put the shells in for fun, Polly. You cook\nanother kettleful, and I'll pick you some meats all fair. Will you?\"\n\n\"It's pretty hot work, and it's a pity to waste things; but I'll try\nagain, if you want me to,\" said Polly, with a patient sigh, for her arms\nwere tired and her face uncomfortably hot.\n\n\"We don't want you; get away!\" said Maud, shaking a sticky spoon at him.\n\n\"Keep quiet, cry-baby. I'm going to stay and help; may n't I, Polly?\"\n\n\"Bears like sweet things, so you want some candy, I guess. Where is\nthe molasses? We've used up all there was in the jug,\" said Polly,\ngood-naturedly, beginning again.\n\n\"Down cellar; I'll get it;\" and taking the lamp and jug, Tom departed,\nbent on doing his duty now like a saint.\n\nThe moment his light vanished, Fanny bolted the door, saying,\nspitefully, \"Now, we are safe from any more tricks. Let him thump and\ncall, it only serves him right; and when the candy is done, we'll let\nthe rascal out.\"\n\n\"How can we make it without molasses?\" asked Polly, thinking that would\nsettle the matter.\n\n\"There's plenty in the store-room. No; you shan't let him up till I'm\nready. He's got to learn that I'm not to be shaken by a little chit\nlike him. Make your candy, and let him alone, or I'll go and tell papa,\nand then Tom will get a lecture.\"\n\nPolly thought it was n't fair; but Maud clamored for her candy, and\nfinding she could do nothing to appease Fan, Polly devoted her mind to\nher cookery till the nuts were safely in, and a nice panful set in the\nyard to cool. A few bangs at the locked door, a few threats of vengeance\nfrom the prisoner, such as setting the house on fire, drinking up the\nwine, and mashing the jelly-pots, and then all was so quiet that the\ngirls forgot him in the exciting crisis of their work.\n\n\"He can't possibly get out anywhere, and as soon we've cut up the\ncandy, we'll unbolt the door and run. Come and get a nice dish to put\nit in,\" said Fan, when Polly proposed to go halves with Tom, lest he\nshould come bursting in somehow, and seize the whole.\n\nWhen they came down with the dish in which to set forth their treat,\nand opened the back-door to find it, imagine their dismay on discovering\nthat it was gone, pan, candy, and all, utterly and mysteriously gone!\n\nA general lament arose, when a careful rummage left no hopes; for\nthe fates had evidently decreed at candy was not to prosper on this\nunpropitious night.\n\n\"The hot pan has melted and sunk in the snow perhaps,\" said Fanny,\ndigging into the drift where it was left.\n\n\"Those old cats have got it, I guess,\" suggested Maud, too much\noverwhelmed by this second blow to howl as usual.\n\n\"The gate is n't locked, and some beggar has stolen it. I hope it will\ndo him good,\" added Polly, turning from her exploring expedition.\n\n\"If Tom could get out, I should think he'd carried it off; but not\nbeing a rat, he can't go through the bits of windows; so it was n't\nhim,\" said Fanny, disconsolately, for she began to think this double\nloss a punishment for letting angry passions rise, \"Let's open the door\nand tell him about it,\" proposed Polly.\n\n\"He'll crow over us. No; we'll open it and go to bed, and he can come\nout when he likes. Provoking boy! if he had n't plagued us so, we should\nhave had a nice time.\"\n\nUnbolting the cellar door, the girls announced to the invisible captive\nthat they were through, and then departed much depressed. Half-way up\nthe second flight, they all stopped as suddenly as if they had seen\na ghost; for looking over the banisters was Tom's face, crocky but\ntriumphant, and in either hand a junk of candy, which he waved above\nthem as he vanished, with the tantalizing remark, \"Don't you wish you\nhad some?\"\n\n\"How in the world did he get out?\" cried Fanny, steadying herself after\na start that nearly sent all three tumbling down stairs.\n\n\"Coal-hole!\" answered a spectral voice from the gloom above.\n\n\"Good gracious! He must have poked up the cover, climbed into the\nstreet, stole the candy, and sneaked in at the shed-window while we were\nlooking for it.\"\n\n\"Cats got it, did n't they?\" jeered the voice in a tone that made Polly\nsit down and laugh till she could n't laugh any longer.\n\n\"Just give Maud a bit, she's so disappointed. Fan and I are sick of it,\nand so will you be, if you eat it all,\" called Polly, when she got her\nbreath.\n\n\"Go to bed, Maudie, and look under your pillow when you get there,\" was\nthe oracular reply that came down to them, as Tom's door closed after a\njubilant solo on the tin pan.\n\nThe girls went to bed tired out; and Maud slumbered placidly, hugging\nthe sticky bundle, found where molasses candy is not often discovered.\nPolly was very tired, and soon fell asleep; but Fanny, who slept with\nher, lay awake longer than usual, thinking about her troubles, for her\nhead ached, and the dissatisfaction that follows anger would not let her\nrest with the tranquillity that made the rosy face in the little round\nnightcap such a pleasant sight to see as it lay beside her. The gas was\nturned down, but Fanny saw a figure in a gray wrapper creep by her door,\nand presently return, pausing to look in. \"Who is it?\" she cried, so\nloud that Polly woke.\n\n\"Only me, dear,\" answered grandma's mild voice. \"Poor Tom has got a\ndreadful toothache, and I came down to find some creosote for him. He\ntold me not to tell you; but I can't find the bottle, and don't want to\ndisturb mamma.\"\n\n\"It's in my closet. Old Tom will pay for his trick this time,\" said\nFanny, in a satisfied tone.\n\n\"I thought he'd get enough of our candy,\" laughed Polly; and then they\nfell asleep, leaving Tom to the delights of toothache and the tender\nmercies of kind old grandma.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. POLLY'S TROUBLES\n\n\nPOLLY soon found that she was in a new world, a world where the manners\nand customs were so different from the simple ways at home, that she\nfelt like a stranger in a strange land, and often wished that she had\nnot come. In the first place, she had nothing to do but lounge and\ngossip, read novels, parade the streets, and dress; and before a week\nwas gone, she was as heartily sick of all this, as a healthy person\nwould be who attempted to live on confectionery. Fanny liked it, because\nshe was used to it, and had never known anything better; but Polly\nhad, and often felt like a little wood-bird shut up in a gilded cage.\nNevertheless, she was much impressed by the luxuries all about her,\nenjoyed them, wished she owned them, and wondered why the Shaws were not\na happier family. She was not wise enough to know where the trouble lay;\nshe did not attempt to say which of the two lives was the right one; she\nonly knew which she liked best, and supposed it was merely another of\nher \"old-fashioned\" ways.\n\nFanny's friends did not interest her much; she was rather afraid of\nthem, they seemed so much older and wiser than herself, even those\nyounger in years. They talked about things of which she knew nothing and\nwhen Fanny tried to explain, she did n't find them interesting; indeed,\nsome of them rather shocked and puzzled her; so the girls let her alone,\nbeing civil when they met, but evidently feeling that she was too \"odd\"\nto belong to their set. Then she turned to Maud for companionship, for\nher own little sister was excellent company, and Polly loved her dearly.\nBut Miss Maud was much absorbed in her own affairs, for she belonged\nto a \"set\" also; and these mites of five and six had their \"musicals,\"\ntheir parties, receptions, and promenades, as well as their elders; and,\nthe chief idea of their little lives seemed to be to ape the fashionable\nfollies they should have been too innocent to understand. Maud had her\ntiny card-case, and paid calls, \"like mamma and Fan\"; her box of dainty\ngloves, her jewel-drawer, her crimping-pins, as fine and fanciful a\nwardrobe as a Paris doll, and a French maid to dress her. Polly could\nn't get on with her at first, for Maud did n't seem like a child, and\noften corrected Polly in her conversation and manners, though little\nmademoiselle's own were anything but perfect. Now and then, when Maud\nfelt poorly, or had a \"fwactious\" turn, for she had \"nerves\" as well as\nmamma, she would go to Polly to \"be amoosed,\" for her gentle ways and\nkind forbearance soothed the little fine lady better than anything else.\nPolly enjoyed these times, and told stories, played games, or went\nout walking, just as Maud liked, slowly and surely winning the child's\nheart, and relieving the whole house of the young tyrant who ruled it.\n\nTom soon got over staring at Polly, and at first did not take much\nnotice of her, for, in his opinion, \"girls did n't amount to much,\nanyway\"; and, considering, the style of girl he knew most about, Polly\nquite agreed with him. He occasionally refreshed himself by teasing her,\nto see how she'd stand it, and caused Polly much anguish of spirit, for\nshe never knew where he would take her next. He bounced out at her from\nbehind doors, booed at her in dark entries, clutched her feet as she\nwent up stairs, startled her by shrill whistles right in her ear, or\nsudden tweaks of the hair as he passed her in the street; and as sure as\nthere was company to dinner, he fixed his round eyes on her, and never\ntook them off till she was reduced to a piteous state of confusion and\ndistress. She used to beg him not to plague her; but he said he did\nit for her good; she was too shy, and needed toughening like the other\ngirls. In vain she protested that she did n't want to be like the other\ngirls in that respect; he only laughed in her face, stuck his red hair\nstraight up all over his head, and glared at her, till she fled in\ndismay.\n\nYet Polly rather liked Tom, for she soon saw that he was neglected,\nhustled out of the way, and left to get on pretty much by himself. She\noften wondered why his mother did n't pet him as she did the girls;\nwhy his father ordered him about as if he was a born rebel, and took so\nlittle interest in his only son. Fanny considered him a bear, and was\nashamed of him; but never tried to polish him up a bit; and Maud and\nhe lived together like a cat and dog who did not belong to a \"happy\nfamily.\" Grandma was the only one who stood by poor old Tom; and Polly\nmore than once discovered him doing something kind for Madam, and\nseeming very much ashamed when it was found out. He was n't respectful\nat all; he called her \"the old lady,\" and told her he \"would n't be\nfussed over\"; but when anything was the matter, he always went to \"the\nold lady,\" and was very grateful for the \"fussing.\" Polly liked him for\nthis, and often wanted to speak of it; but she had a feeling that it\nwould n't do, for in praising their affection, she was reproaching\nothers with neglect; so she held her tongue, and thought about it all\nthe more. Grandma was rather neglected, too, and perhaps that is\nthe reason why Tom and she were such good friends. She was even more\nold-fashioned than Polly; but people did n't seem to mind it so much in\nher, as her day was supposed to be over, and nothing was expected of her\nbut to keep out of everybody's way, and to be handsomely dressed when\nshe appeared \"before people.\" Grandma led a quiet, solitary life in her\nown rooms, full of old furniture, pictures, books, and relics of a past\nfor which no one cared but herself. Her son went up every evening for a\nlittle call, was very kind to her, and saw that she wanted nothing money\ncould buy; but he was a busy man, so intent on getting rich that he\nhad no time to enjoy what he already possessed. Madam never complained,\ninterfered, or suggested; but there was a sad sort of quietude about\nher, a wistful look in her faded eyes, as if she wanted something which\nmoney could not buy, and when children were near, she hovered about\nthem, evidently longing to cuddle and caress them as only grandmothers\ncan. Polly felt this; and as she missed the home-petting, gladly showed\nthat she liked to see the quiet old face brighten, as she entered the\nsolitary room, where few children came, except the phantoms of little\nsons and daughters, who, to the motherly heart that loved them, never\nfaded or grew up. Polly wished the children would be kinder to grandma;\nbut it was not for her to tell them so, although it troubled her a good\ndeal, and she could only try to make up for it by being as dutiful and\naffectionate as if their grandma was her own.\n\nAnother thing that disturbed Polly was the want of exercise. To dress\nup and parade certain streets for an hour every day, to stand talking in\ndoorways, or drive out in a fine carriage, was not the sort of exercise\nshe liked, and Fan would take no other. Indeed, she was so shocked,\nwhen Polly, one day, proposed a run down the mall, that her friend never\ndared suggest such a thing again. At home, Polly ran and rode, coasted\nand skated, jumped rope and raked hay, worked in her garden and rowed\nher boat; so no wonder she longed for something more lively than a daily\npromenade with a flock of giddy girls, who tilted along in high-heeled\nboots, and costumes which made Polly ashamed to be seen with some of\nthem. So she used to slip out alone sometimes, when Fanny was absorbed\nin novels, company, or millinery, and get fine brisk walks round the\npark, on the unfashionable side, where the babies took their airings; or\nshe went inside, to watch the boys coasting, and to wish she could coast\ntoo, as she did at home. She never went far, and always came back rosy\nand gay.\n\nOne afternoon, just before dinner, she felt so tired of doing nothing,\nthat she slipped out for a run. It had been a dull day; but the sun was\nvisible now, setting brightly below the clouds. It was cold but still\nand Polly trotted down the smooth, snow-covered mall humming to herself,\nand trying not to feel homesick. The coasters were at it with all their\nmight, and she watched them, till her longing to join the fun grew\nirresistible. On the hill, some little girls were playing with their\nsleds, real little girls, in warm hoods and coats, rubber boots and\nmittens, and Polly felt drawn toward them in spite of her fear of Fan.\n\n\"I want to go down, but I dars n't, it's so steep,\" said one of these\n\"common children,\" as Maud called them.\n\n\"If you'll lend me your sled, and sit in my lap, I'll take you down\nall nice,\" answered Polly, in a confidential tone.\n\nThe little girls took a look at her, seemed satisfied, and accepted\nher offer. Polly looked carefully round to see that no fashionable eye\nbeheld the awful deed, and finding all safe, settled her freight, and\nspun away down hill, feeling all over the delightsome excitement of\nswift motion which makes coasting such a favorite pastime with the more\nsensible portion of the child-world. One after another, she took\nthe little girls down the hill and dragged them up again, while they\nregarded her in the light of a gray-coated angel, descended for their\nexpress benefit. Polly was just finishing off with one delicious \"go\"\nall by herself, when she heard a familiar whistle behind her, and before\nshe could get off, up came Tom, looking as much astonished as if he had\nfound her mounted, on an elephant.\n\n\"Hullo, Polly! What'll Fan say to you?\" was his polished salutation.\n\n\"Don't know, and don't care. Coasting is no harm; I like it, and I'm\ngoing to do it, now I've got a chance; so clear the lul-la!\" And\naway went independent Polly, with her hair blowing in the wind, and an\nexpression of genuine enjoyment, which a very red nose did n't damage in\nthe least.\n\n\"Good for you, Polly!\" And casting himself upon his sled, with the most\nreckless disregard for his ribs, off whizzed Tom after her, and came\nalongside just as she reined up \"General Grant\" on the broad path below.\n\"Oh, won't you get it when we go home?\" cried the young gentleman, even\nbefore he changed his graceful attitude.\n\n\"I shan't, if you don't go and tell; but of course you will,\" added\nPolly, sitting still, while an anxious expression began to steal over\nher happy face.\n\n\"I just won't, then,\" returned Tom, with the natural perversity of his\ntribe.\n\n\"If they ask me, I shall tell, of course; if they don't ask, I think\nthere's no harm in keeping still. I should n't have done it, if I had\nn't known my mother was willing; but I don't wish to trouble your mother\nby telling of it. Do you think it was very dreadful of me?\" asked Polly,\nlooking at him.\n\n\"I think it was downright jolly; and I won't tell, if you don't want me\nto. Now, come up and have another,\" said Tom, heartily.\n\n\"Just one more; the little girls want to go, this is their sled.\"\n\n\"Let'em take it, it is n't good for much; and you come on mine.\nMazeppa's a stunner; you see if he is n't.\"\n\nSo Polly tucked herself up in front, Tom hung on behind in some\nmysterious manner, and Mazeppa proved that he fully merited his master's\nsincere if inelegant praise. They got on capitally now, for Tom was in\nhis proper sphere, and showed his best side, being civil and gay in the\nbluff boy-fashion that was natural to him; while Polly forgot to be shy,\nand liked this sort of \"toughening\" much better than the other. They\nlaughed and talked, and kept taking \"just one more,\" till the sunshine\nwas all gone, and the clocks struck dinner-time.\n\n\"We shall be late; let's run,\" said Polly, as they came into the path\nafter the last coast.\n\n\"You just sit still, and I'll get you home in a jiffy;\" and before she\ncould unpack herself, Tom trotted off with her at a fine pace.\n\n\"Here's a pair of cheeks! I wish you'd get a color like this, Fanny,\"\nsaid Mr. Shaw, as Polly came into the dining-room after smoothing her\nhair.\n\n\"Your nose is as red as that cranberry sauce,\" answered Fan, coming out\nof the big chair where she had been curled up for an hour or two, deep\nin \"Lady Audley's Secret.\"\n\n\"So it is,\" said Polly, shutting one eye to look at the offending\nfeature. \"Never mind; I've had a good time, anyway,\" she added, giving\na little prance in her chair.\n\n\"I don't see much fun in these cold runs you are so fond of taking,\"\nsaid Fanny, with a yawn and a shiver.\n\n\"Perhaps you would if you tried it;\" and Polly laughed as she glanced at\nTom.\n\n\"Did you go alone, dear?\" asked grandma, patting the rosy cheek beside\nher.\n\n\"Yes'm; but I met Tom, and we came home together.\" Polly's eyes\ntwinkled when she said that, and Tom choked in his soup.\n\n\"Thomas, leave the table!\" commanded Mr. Shaw, as his incorrigible son\ngurgled and gasped behind his napkin.\n\n\"Please don't send him away, sir. I made him laugh,\" said Polly,\npenitently.\n\n\"What's the joke?\" asked Fanny, waking up at last.\n\n\"I should n't think you'd make him laugh, when he's always making you\ncwy,\" observed Maud, who had just come in.\n\n\"What have you been doing now, sir?\" demanded Mr. Shaw, as Tom emerged,\nred and solemn, from his brief obscurity.\n\n\"Nothing but coast,\" he said, gruffly, for papa was always lecturing\nhim, and letting the girls do just as they liked.\n\n\"So's Polly; I saw her. Me and Blanche were coming home just now, and\nwe saw her and Tom widing down the hill on his sled, and then he dwagged\nher ever so far!\" cried Maud, with her mouth full.\n\n\"You did n't?\" and Fanny dropped her fork with a scandalized face.\n\n\"Yes, I did, and liked it ever so much,\" answered Polly, looking anxious\nbut resolute.\n\n\"Did any one see you?\" cried Fanny.\n\n\"Only some little girls, and Tom.\"\n\n\"It was horridly improper; and Tom ought to have told you so, if you did\nn't know any better. I should be mortified to death if any of my friends\nsaw you,\" added Fan, much disturbed.\n\n\"Now, don't you scold. It's no harm, and Polly shall coast if she wants\nto; may n't she, grandma?\" cried Tom, gallantly coming to the rescue,\nand securing a powerful ally.\n\n\"My mother lets me; and if I don't go among the boys, I can't see what\nharm there is in it,\" said Polly, before Madam could speak.\n\n\"People do many things in the country that are not proper here,\" began\nMrs. Shaw, in her reproving tone.\n\n\"Let the child do it if she likes, and take Maud with her. I should be\nglad to have one hearty girl in my house,\" interrupted Mr. Shaw, and\nthat was the end of it.\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Polly, gratefully, and nodded at Tom, who\ntelegraphed back \"All right!\" and fell upon his dinner with the appetite\nof a young wolf.\n\n\"Oh, you sly-boots! you're getting up a flirtation with Tom, are you?\"\nwhispered Fanny to her friend, as if much amused.\n\n\"What!\" and Polly looked so surprised and indignant, that Fanny was\nashamed of herself, and changed the subject by telling her mother she\nneeded some new gloves.\n\nPolly was very quiet after that, and the minute dinner was over, she\nleft the room to go and have a quiet \"think\" about the whole matter.\nBefore she got half-way up stairs, she saw Tom coming after, and\nimmediately sat down to guard her feet. He laughed, and said, as he\nperched himself on the post of the banisters, \"I won't grab you, honor\nbright. I just wanted to say, if you'll come out to-morrow some time,\nwe'll have a good coast.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Polly, \"I can't come.\"\n\n\"Why not? Are you mad? I did n't tell.\" And Tom looked amazed at the\nchange which had come over her.\n\n\"No; you kept your word, and stood by me like a good boy. I'm not mad,\neither; but I don't mean to coast any more. Your mother don't like it.\"\n\n\"That is n't the reason, I know. You nodded to me after she'd freed her\nmind, and you meant to go then. Come, now, what is it?\"\n\n\"I shan't tell you; but I'm not going,\" was Polly's determined answer.\n\n\"Well, I did think you had more sense than most girls; but you have n't,\nand I would n't give a sixpence for you.\"\n\n\"That's polite,\" said Polly, getting ruffled.\n\n\"Well, I hate cowards.\"\n\n\"I ain't a coward.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are. You're afraid of what folks will say; ain't you, now?\"\n\nPolly knew she was, and held her peace, though she longed to speak; but\nhow could she?\n\n\"Ah, I knew you'd back out.\" And Tom walked away with an air of scorn\nthat cut Polly to the heart.\n\n\"It's too bad! Just as he was growing kind to me, and I was going to\nhave a good time, it's all spoilt by Fan's nonsense. Mrs. Shaw don't\nlike it, nor grandma either, I dare say. There'll be a fuss if I go,\nand Fan will plague me; so I'll give it up, and let Tom think I'm\nafraid. Oh, dear! I never did see such ridiculous people.\"\n\nPolly shut her door hard, and felt ready to cry with vexation, that her\npleasure should be spoilt by such a silly idea; for, of all the silly\nfreaks of this fast age, that of little people playing at love is about\nthe silliest. Polly had been taught that it was a very serious and\nsacred thing; and, according to her notions, it was far more improper to\nflirt with one boy than to coast with a dozen. She had been much amazed,\nonly the day before, to hear Maud say to her mother, \"Mamma, must I have\na beau? The girls all do, and say I ought to have Fweddy Lovell; but I\ndon't like him as well as Hawry Fiske.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I'd have a little sweetheart, dear, it's so cunning,\"\nanswered Mrs. Shaw. And Maud announced soon after that she was engaged\nto \"Fweddy,'cause Hawry slapped her\" when she proposed the match.\n\nPolly laughed with the rest at the time; but when she thought of it\nafterward, and wondered what her own mother would have said, if little\nKitty had put such a question, she did n't find it cunning or funny, but\nridiculous and unnatural. She felt so now about herself; and when her\nfirst petulance was over, resolved to give up coasting and everything\nelse, rather than have any nonsense with Tom, who, thanks to his\nneglected education, was as ignorant as herself of the charms of this\nnew amusement for school-children. So Polly tried to console herself\nby jumping rope in the back-yard, and playing tag with Maud in the\ndrying-room, where she likewise gave lessons in \"nas-gim-nics,\" as Maud\ncalled it, which did that little person good. Fanny came up sometimes\nto teach them a new dancing step, and more than once was betrayed into\na game of romps, for which she was none the worse. But Tom turned a cold\nshoulder to Polly, and made it evident, by his cavalier manner that he\nreally did n't think her \"worth a sixpence.\"\n\nAnother thing that troubled Polly was her clothes, for, though no one\nsaid anything, she knew they were very plain; and now and then she\nwished that her blue and mouse colored merinos were rather more trimmed,\nher sashes had bigger bows, and her little ruffles more lace on them.\nShe sighed for a locket, and, for the first time in her life, thought\nseriously of turning up her pretty curls and putting on a \"wad.\" She\nkept these discontents to herself, however, after she had written to ask\nher mother if she might have her best dress altered like Fanny's, and\nreceived this reply: \"No, dear; the dress is proper and becoming as it\nis, and the old fashion of simplicity the best for all of us. I don't\nwant my Polly to be loved for her clothes, but for herself; so wear the\nplain frocks mother took such pleasure in making for you, and let the\npanniers go. The least of us have some influence in this big world;\nand perhaps my little girl can do some good by showing others that a\ncontented heart and a happy face are better ornaments than any Paris can\ngive her. You want a locket, deary; so I send one that my mother gave me\nyears ago. You will find father's face on one side, mine on the other;\nand when things trouble you, just look at your talisman, and I think the\nsunshine will come back again.\"\n\nOf course it did, for the best of all magic was shut up in the quaint\nlittle case that Polly wore inside her frock, and kissed so tenderly\neach night and morning. The thought that, insignificant as she was, she\nyet might do some good, made her very careful of her acts and words, and\nso anxious to keep head contented and face happy, that she forgot her\nclothes, and made others do the same. She did not know it, but that good\nold fashion of simplicity made the plain gowns pretty, and the grace of\nunconsciousness beautified their little wearer with the charm that\nmakes girlhood sweetest to those who truly love and reverence it. One\ntemptation Polly had already yielded to before the letter came, and\nrepented heartily of afterward.\n\n\"Polly, I wish you'd let me call you Marie,\" said Fanny one day, as\nthey were shopping together.\n\n\"You may call me Mary, if you like; but I won't have any ie put on to my\nname. I'm Polly at home and I'm fond of being called so; but Marie is\nFrenchified and silly.\"\n\n\"I spell my own name with an ie, and so do all the girls.\"\n\n\"And what a jumble of Netties, Nellies, Hatties, and Sallies there is.\nHow 'Pollie' would look spelt so!\"\n\n\"Well, never mind; that was n't what I began to say. There's one thing\nyou must have, and that is, bronze boots,\" said Fan, impressively.\n\n\"Why must I, when I've got enough without?\"\n\n\"Because it's the fashion to have them, and you can't be finished off\nproperly without. I'm going to get a pair, and so must you.\"\n\n\"Don't they cost a great deal?\"\n\n\"Eight or nine dollars, I believe. I have mine charged; but it don't\nmatter if you have n't got the money. I can lend you some.\"\n\n\"I've got ten dollars to do what I like with; but it's meant to get\nsome presents for the children.\" And Polly took out her purse in an\nundecided way.\n\n\"You can make presents easy enough. Grandma knows all sorts of nice\ncontrivances. They'll do just as well; and then you can get your\nboots.\"\n\n\"Well; I'll look at them,\" said Polly, following Fanny into the store,\nfeeling rather rich and important to be shopping in this elegant manner.\n\n\"Are n't they lovely? Your foot is perfectly divine in that boot, Polly.\nGet them for my party; you'll dance like a fairy,\" whispered Fan.\n\nPolly surveyed the dainty, shining boot with the scalloped top, the\njaunty heel, and the delicate toe, thought her foot did look very well\nin it, and after a little pause, said she would have them. It was all\nvery delightful till she got home, and was alone; then, on looking into\nher purse, she saw one dollar and the list of things she meant to get\nfor mother and the children. How mean the dollar looked all alone! and\nhow long the list grew when there was nothing to buy the articles.\n\n\"I can't make skates for Ned, nor a desk for Will; and those are what\nthey have set their hearts upon. Father's book and mother's collar are\nimpossible now; and I'm a selfish thing to go and spend all my\nmoney for myself. How could I do it?\" And Polly eyed the new boots\nreproachfully, as they stood in the first position as if ready for the\nparty. \"They are lovely; but I don't believe they will feel good, for\nI shall be thinking about my lost presents all the time,\" sighed Polly,\npushing the enticing boots out of sight. \"I'll go and ask grandma what\nI can do; for if I've got to make something for every one, I must begin\nright away, or I shan't get done;\" and off she bustled, glad to forget\nher remorse in hard work.\n\nGrandma proved equal to the emergency, and planned something for every\none, supplying materials, taste, and skill in the most delightful\nmanner. Polly felt much comforted; but while she began to knit a pretty\npair of white bed-socks, to be tied with rose-colored ribbons, for\nher mother, she thought some very sober thoughts upon the subject of\ntemptation; and if any one had asked her just then what made her sigh,\nas if something lay heavy on her conscience, she would have answered,\n\"Bronze boots.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. LITTLE THINGS\n\n\n\"IT'S so wainy, I can't go out, and evwybody is so cwoss they won't\nplay with me,\" said Maud, when Polly found her fretting on the stairs,\nand paused to ask the cause of her wails.\n\n\"I'll play with you; only don't scream and wake your mother. What shall\nwe play?\"\n\n\"I don't know; I'm tired of evwything,'cause my toys are all bwoken,\nand my dolls are all sick but Clawa,\" moaned Maud, giving a jerk to the\nParis doll which she held upside down by one leg in the most unmaternal\nmanner.\n\n\"I'm going to dress a dolly for my little sister; would n't you like\nto see me do it?\" asked Polly, persuasively, hoping to beguile the cross\nchild and finish her own work at the same time.\n\n\"No, I should n't,'cause she'll look nicer than my Clawa. Her clothes\nwon't come off; and Tom spoilt'em playing ball with her in the yard.\"\n\n\"Would n't you like to rip these clothes off, and have me show you how\nto make some new ones, so you can dress and undress Clara as much as you\nlike?\"\n\n\"Yes; I love to cut.\" And Maud's, face brightened; for destructiveness\nis one of the earliest traits of childhood, and ripping was Maud's\ndelight.\n\nEstablishing themselves in the deserted dining-room, the children fell\nto work; and when Fanny discovered them, Maud was laughing with all\nher heart at poor Clara, who, denuded of her finery, was cutting up all\nsorts of capers in the hands of her merry little mistress.\n\n\"I should think you'd be ashamed to play with dolls, Polly. I have n't\ntouched one this ever so long,\" said Fanny, looking down with a superior\nair.\n\n\"I ain't ashamed, for it keeps Maud happy, and will please my sister\nKitty; and I think sewing is better than prinking or reading silly\nnovels, so, now.\" And Polly stitched away with a resolute air, for she\nand Fanny had had a little tiff; because Polly would n't let her friend\ndo up her hair \"like other folks,\" and bore her ears.\n\n\"Don't be cross, dear, but come and do something nice, it's so dull\nto-day,\" said Fanny, anxious to be friends again, for it was doubly dull\nwithout Polly.\n\n\"Can't; I'm busy.\"\n\n\"You always are busy. I never saw such a girl. What in the world do you\nfind to do all the time?\" asked Fanny, watching with interest the set of\nthe little red merino frock Polly was putting on to her doll.\n\n\"Lots of things; but I like to be lazy sometimes as much as you do; just\nlie on the sofa, and read fairy stories, or think about nothing. Would\nyou have a white-muslin apron or a black silk?\" added Polly, surveying\nher work with satisfaction.\n\n\"Muslin, with pockets and tiny blue bows. I'll show you how.\" And\nforgetting her hate and contempt for dolls, down sat Fanny, soon getting\nas much absorbed as either of the others.\n\nThe dull day brightened wonderfully after that, and the time flew\npleasantly, as tongues and needles went together. Grandma peeped in, and\nsmiled at the busy group, saying, \"Sew away, my dears; dollies are safe\ncompanions, and needlework an accomplishment that's sadly neglected\nnowadays. Small stitches, Maud; neat button-holes, Fan; cut carefully,\nPolly, and don't waste your cloth. Take pains; and the best needlewoman\nshall have a pretty bit of white satin for a doll's bonnet.\"\n\nFanny exerted herself, and won the prize, for Polly helped Maud, and\nneglected her own work; but she did n't care much, for Mr. Shaw said,\nlooking at the three bright faces at the tea-table, \"I guess Polly has\nbeen making sunshine for you to-day.\" \"No, indeed, sir, I have n't done\nanything, only dress Maud's doll.\"\n\nAnd Polly did n't think she had done much; but it was one of the little\nthings which are always waiting to be done in this world of ours, where\nrainy days come so often, where spirits get out of tune, and duty won't\ngo hand in hand with pleasure. Little things of this sort are especially\ngood work for little people; a kind little thought, an unselfish little\nact, a cheery little word, are so sweet and comfortable, that no one can\nfail to feel their beauty and love the giver, no matter how small they\nare. Mothers do a deal of this sort of thing, unseen, unthanked, but\nfelt and remembered long afterward, and never lost, for this is the\nsimple magic that binds hearts together, and keeps home happy. Polly had\nlearned this secret.\n\nShe loved to do the \"little things\" that others did not see, or were too\nbusy to stop for; and while doing them, without a thought of thanks, she\nmade sunshine for herself as well as others. There was so much love\nin her own home, that she quickly felt the want of it in Fanny's, and\npuzzled herself to find out why these people were not kind and patient\nto one another. She did not try to settle the question, but did her\nbest to love and serve and bear with each, and the good will, the gentle\nheart, the helpful ways and simple manners of our Polly made her dear\nto every one, for these virtues, even in a little child, are lovely and\nattractive.\n\nMr. Shaw was very kind to her, for he liked her modest, respectful\nmanners; and Polly was so grateful for his many favors, that she soon\nforgot her fear, and showed her affection in all sorts of confiding\nlittle ways, which pleased him extremely. She used to walk across the\npark with him when he went to his office in the morning, talking busily\nall the way, and saying \"Good-by\" with a nod and a smile when they\nparted at the great gate. At first, Mr. Shaw did not care much about\nit; but soon he missed her if she did not come, and found that\nsomething fresh and pleasant seemed to brighten all his day, if a small,\ngray-coated figure, with an intelligent face, a merry voice, and a\nlittle hand slipped confidingly into his, went with him through the\nwintry park. Coming home late, he liked to see a curly, brown head\nwatching at the window; to find his slippers ready, his paper in its\nplace, and a pair of willing feet, eager to wait upon him. \"I wish my\nFanny was more like her,\" he often said to himself, as he watched the\ngirls, while they thought him deep in politics or the state of the money\nmarket. Poor Mr. Shaw had been so busy getting rich, that he had not\nfound time to teach his children to love him; he was more at leisure\nnow, and as his boy and girls grew up, he missed something. Polly was\nunconsciously showing him what it was, and making child-love so sweet,\nthat he felt he could not do without it any more, yet did n't quite\nknow how to win the confidence of the children, who had always found him\nbusy, indifferent, and absentminded.\n\nAs the girls were going to bed one night, Polly kissed grandma, as\nusual, and Fanny laughed at her, saying, \"What a baby you are! We are\ntoo old for such things now.\"\n\n\"I don't think people ever are too old to kiss their fathers and\nmothers,\" was the quick answer.\n\n\"Right, my little Polly;\" and Mr. Shaw stretched out his hand to her\nwith such a kindly look, that Fanny stared surprised, and then said,\nshyly, \"I thought you did n't care about it, father.\" \"I do, my dear:\"\nAnd Mr. Shaw put out the other hand to Fanny, who gave him a daughterly\nkiss, quite forgetting everything but the tender feeling that sprung up\nin her heart at the renewal of the childish custom which we never need\noutgrow.\n\nMrs. Shaw was a nervous, fussy invalid, who wanted something every five\nminutes; so Polly found plenty of small things to do for her and did,\nthem so cheerfully, that the poor lady loved to have the quiet, helpful\nchild near, to wait upon her, read to her, run errands, or hand the\nseven different shawls which were continually being put on or off.\n\nGrandma, too, was glad to find willing hands and feet to serve her; and\nPolly passed many happy hours in the quaint rooms, learning all sorts\nof pretty arts, and listening to pleasant chat, never dreaming how much\nsunshine she brought to the solitary old lady.\n\nTom was Polly's rock ahead for a long time, because he was always\nbreaking out in a new place, and one never knew where to find him. He\ntormented yet amused her; was kind one day, and a bear the next; at\ntimes she fancied he was never going to be bad again, and the next thing\nshe knew he was deep in mischief, and hooted at the idea of repentance\nand reformation. Polly gave him up as a hard case; but was so in the\nhabit of helping any one who seemed in trouble, that she was good to him\nsimply because she could n't help it.\n\n\"What's the matter? Is your lesson too hard for you?\" she asked one\nevening, as a groan made her look across the table to where Tom sat\nscowling over a pile of dilapidated books, with his hands in his hair,\nas if his head was in danger of flying asunder with the tremendous\neffort he was making.\n\n\"Hard! Guess it is. What in thunder do I care about the old\nCarthaginians? Regulus was n't bad; but I'm sick of him!\" And Tom dealt\n\"Harkness's Latin Reader\" a thump, which expressed his feelings better\nthan words.\n\n\"I like Latin, and used to get on well when I studied it with Jimmy.\nPerhaps I can help you a little bit,\" said Polly, as Tom wiped his hot\nface and refreshed himself with a peanut.\n\n\"You? pooh! girls' Latin don't amount to much anyway,\" was the grateful\nreply.\n\nBut Polly was used to him now, and, nothing daunted, took a look at the\ngrimy page in the middle of which Tom had stuck. She read it so well,\nthat the young gentleman stopped munching to regard her with respectful\nastonishment, and when she stopped, he said, suspiciously, \"You are a\nsly one, Polly, to study up so you can show off before me. But it won't\ndo, ma'am; turn over a dozen pages, and try again.\"\n\nPolly obeyed, and did even better than before, saying, as she looked up,\nwith a laugh, \"I've been through the whole book; so you won't catch me\nthat way, Tom.\"\n\n\"I say, how came you to know such a lot?\" asked Tom, much impressed.\n\n\"I studied with Jimmy, and kept up with him, for father let us be\ntogether in all our lessons. It was so nice, and we learned so fast!\"\n\n\"Tell me about Jimmy. He's your brother, is n't he?\"\n\n\"Yes; but he's dead, you know. I'll tell about him some other time;\nyou ought to study now, and perhaps I can help you,\" said Polly, with a\nlittle quiver of the lips.\n\n\"Should n't wonder if you could.\" And Tom spread the book between them\nwith a grave and business-like air, for he felt that Polly had got the\nbetter of him, and it behooved him to do his best for the honor of his\nsex. He went at the lesson with a will, and soon floundered out of his\ndifficulties, for Polly gave him a lift here and there, and they went\non swimmingly, till they came to some rules to be learned. Polly had\nforgotten them, so they, both committed them to memory; Tom, with\nhands in his pockets, rocked to and fro, muttering rapidly, while Polly\ntwisted the little curl on her forehead and stared at the wall, gabbling\nwith all her might.\n\n\"Done!\" cried Tom, presently.\n\n\"Done!\" echoed Polly; and then they heard each other recite till both\nwere perfect \"That's pretty good fun,\" said Tom, joyfully, tossing poor\nHarkness away, and feeling that the pleasant excitement of companionship\ncould lend a charm even to Latin Grammar.\n\n\"Now, ma'am, we'll take a turn at algibbera. I like that as much as I\nhate Latin.\"\n\nPolly accepted the invitation, and soon owned that Tom could beat her\nhere. This fact restored his equanimity; but he did n't crow over her,\nfar from it; for he helped her with a paternal patience that made\nher eyes twinkle with suppressed fun, as he soberly explained and\nillustrated, unconsciously imitating Dominie Deane, till Polly found it\ndifficult to keep from laughing in his face.\n\n\"You may have another go at it any, time you like,\" generously remarked\nTom, as he shied the algebra after the Latin Reader.\n\n\"I'll come every evening, then. I'd like to, for I have n't studied a\nbit since I came. You shall try and make me like algebra, and I'll try\nand make you like Latin, will you?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'd like it well enough, if there was any one explain it to me.\nOld Deane puts us through double-quick, and don't give a fellow time to\nask questions when we read.\"\n\n\"Ask your father; he knows.\"\n\n\"Don't believe he does; should n't dare to bother him, if he did.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"He'd pull my ears, and call me a'stupid,' or tell me not to worry\nhim.\"\n\n\"I don't think he would. He's very kind to me, and I ask lots of\nquestions.\"\n\n\"He likes you better than he does me.\"\n\n\"Now, Tom! it's wrong of you to say so. Of course he loves you ever so\nmuch more than he does me,\" cried Polly, reprovingly.\n\n\"Why don't he show it then?\" muttered Tom, with a half-wistful,\nhalf-defiant glance toward the library door, which stood ajar.\n\n\"You act so, how can he?\" asked Polly, after a pause, in which she put\nTom's question to herself, and could find no better reply than the one\nshe gave him.\n\n\"Why don't he give me my velocipede? He said, if I did well at school\nfor a month, I should have it; and I've been pegging away like fury for\nmost six weeks, and he don't do a thing about it. The girls get their\nduds, because they tease. I won't do that anyway; but you don't catch me\nstudying myself to death, and no pay for it.\"\n\n\"It is too bad; but you ought to do it because it's right, and\nnever mind being paid,\" began Polly, trying to be moral, but secretly\nsympathizing heartily with poor Tom.\n\n\"Don't you preach, Polly. If the governor took any notice of me, and\ncared how I got on, I would n't mind the presents so much; but he don't\ncare a hang, and never even asked if I did well last declamation day,\nwhen I'd gone and learned 'The Battle of Lake Regillus,' because he\nsaid he liked it.\"\n\n\"Oh, Tom! Did you say that? It's splendid! Jim and I used to say\nHoratius together, and it was such fun. Do speak your piece to me, I do\nso like 'Macaulay's Lays.'\"\n\n\"It's dreadful long,\" began Tom; but his face brightened, for Polly's\ninterest soothed his injured feelings, and he was glad to prove his\nelocutionary powers. He began without much spirit; but soon the martial\nring of the lines fired him, and before he knew it, he was on his legs\nthundering away in grand style, while Polly listened with kindling\nface and absorbed attention. Tom did declaim well, for he quite forgot\nhimself, and delivered the stirring ballad with an energy that\nmade Polly flush and tingle with admiration and delight, and quite\nelectrified a second listener, who had heard all that went on, and\nwatched the little scene from behind his newspaper.\n\nAs Tom paused, breathless, and Polly clapped her hands enthusiastically,\nthe sound was loudly echoed from behind him. Both whirled round, and\nthere was Mr. Shaw, standing in the doorway, applauding with all his\nmight.\n\nTom looked much abashed, and said not a word; Polly ran to Mr. Shaw, and\ndanced before him, saying, eagerly, \"Was n't it splendid? Did n't he do\nwell? May n't he have his velocipede now?\"\n\n\"Capital, Tom; you'll be an orator yet. Learn another piece like that,\nand I'll come and hear you speak it. Are you ready for your velocipede,\nhey?\"\n\nPolly was right; and Tom owned that \"the governor\" was kind, did like\nhim and had n't entirely forgotten his promise. The boy turned red with\npleasure, and picked at the buttons on his jacket, while listening to\nthis unexpected praise; but when he spoke, he looked straight up in his\nfather's face, while his own shone with pleasure, as he answered, in one\nbreath, \"Thankee, sir. I'll do it, sir. Guess I am, sir!\"\n\n\"Very good; then look out for your new horse tomorrow, sir.\" And Mr.\nShaw stroked the fuzzy red head with a kind hand, feeling a fatherly\npleasure in the conviction that there was something in his boy after\nall.\n\nTom got his velocipede next day, named it Black Auster, in memory of the\nhorse in \"The Battle of Lake Regillus,\" and came to grief as soon as he\nbegan to ride his new steed.\n\n\"Come out and see me go it,\" whispered Tom to Polly, after three days'\npractice in the street, for he had already learned to ride in the rink.\n\nPolly and Maud willingly went, and watched his struggles, with\ndeep interest, till he got an upset, which nearly put an end to his\nvelocipeding forever.\n\n\"Hi, there! Auster's coming!\" shouted Tom, as came rattling down the\nlong, steep street outside the park.\n\nThey stepped aside, and he whizzed by, arms and legs going like mad,\nwith the general appearance of a runaway engine. It would have been a\ntriumphant descent, if a big dog had not bounced suddenly through one of\nthe openings, and sent the whole concern helter-skelter into the gutter.\nPolly laughed as she ran to view the ruin, for Tom lay flat on his back\nwith the velocipede atop him, while the big dog barked wildly, and his\nmaster scolded him for his awkwardness. But when she saw Tom's face,\nPolly was frightened, for the color had all gone out of it, his eyes\nlooked strange and dizzy, and drops of blood began to trickle from a\ngreat cut on his forehead. The man saw it, too, and had him up in a\nminute; but he could n't stand, and stared about him in a dazed sort of\nway, as he sat on the curbstone, while Polly held her handkerchief to\nhis forehead, and pathetically begged to know if he was killed.\n\n\"Don't scare mother, I'm all right. Got upset, did n't I?\" he asked,\npresently, eyeing the prostrate velocipede with more anxiety about its\ndamages than his own.\n\n\"I knew you'd hurt yourself with that horrid thing just let it be, and\ncome home, for your head bleeds dreadfully, and everybody is looking\nat us,\" whispered Polly, trying to tie the little handkerchief over the\nugly cut.\n\n\"Come on, then. Jove! how queer my head feels! Give us a boost, please.\nStop howling, Maud, and come home. You bring the machine, and I'll pay\nyou, Pat.\" As he spoke, Tom slowly picked himself and steadying himself\nby Polly's shoulder, issued commands, and the procession fell into\nline. First, the big dog, barking at intervals; then the good-natured\nIrishman, trundling \"that divil of a whirligig,\" as he disrespectfully\ncalled the idolized velocipede; then the wounded hero, supported by the\nhelpful Polly; and Maud brought up the rear in tears, bearing Tom's cap.\n\nUnfortunately, Mrs. Shaw was out driving with grandma, and Fanny was\nmaking calls; so that there was no one but Polly to stand by Tom, for\nthe parlor-maid turned faint at the sight of blood, and the chamber-maid\nlost her wits in the flurry. It was a bad cut, and must be sewed up\nat once, the doctor said, as soon as he came. \"Somebody must hold his\nhead;\" he added, as he threaded his queer little needle.\n\n\"I'll keep still, but if anybody must hold me, let Polly. You ain't\nafraid, are you?\" asked Tom, with imploring look, for he did n't like\nthe idea of being sewed a bit.\n\nPolly was just going to shrink away, saying, \"Oh I can't!\" when she\nremembered that Tom once called her a coward. Here was a chance to prove\nthat she was n't; besides, poor Tom had no one else to help him; so she\ncame up to the sofa where he lay, and nodded reassuringly, as she put a\nsoft little hand on either side of the damaged head.\n\n\"You are a trump, Polly,\" whispered Tom. Then he set his teeth, clenched\nhis hands, lay quite still, and bore it like a man. It was all over in\na minute or two, and when he had had a glass of wine, and was nicely\nsettled on his bed, he felt pretty comfortable, in spite of the pain in\nhis head; and being ordered to keep quiet, he said, \"Thank you ever so\nmuch, Polly,\" and watched her with a grateful face as she crept away.\n\nHe had to keep the house for a week, and laid about looking very\ninteresting with a great black patch on his forehead. Every one'petted\nhim;' for the doctor said, that if the blow had been an inch nearer\nthe temple, it would have been fatal, and the thought of losing him so\nsuddenly made bluff old Tom very precious all at once. His father asked\nhim how he was a dozen times a day; his mother talked continually of\n\"that dear boy's narrow escape\"; and grandma cockered him up with every\ndelicacy she could invent; and the girls waited on him like devoted\nslaves. This new treatment had an excellent effect; for when neglected\nTom got over his first amazement at this change of base, he blossomed\nout delightfully, as sick people do sometimes, and surprised his family\nby being unexpectedly patient, grateful, and amiable. Nobody ever knew\nhow much good it did him; for boys seldom have confidences of this sort\nexcept with their mothers, and Mrs. Shaw had never found the key to her\nson's heart. But a little seed was sowed then that took root, and though\nit grew very slowly, it came to something in the end. Perhaps Polly\nhelped it a little. Evening was his hardest time, for want of exercise\nmade him as restless and nervous as it was possible for a hearty lad to\nbe on such a short notice.\n\nHe could n't sleep so the girls amused him; Fanny played and read aloud;\nPolly sung, and told stories; and did the latter so well, that it got\nto be a regular thing for her to begin as soon as twilight came, and Tom\nwas settled in his favorite place on grandma's sofa.\n\n\"Fire away, Polly,\" said the young sultan, one evening, as his little\nScheherazade sat down in her low chair, after stirring up the fire till\nthe room was bright and cosy.\n\n\"I don't feel like stories to-night, Tom. I've told all I know, and\ncan't make up any more,\" answered Polly, leaning her head on her hand\nwith a sorrowful look that Tom had never seen before. He watched her a\nminute, and then asked, curiously, \"What were you thinking about, just\nnow, when you sat staring at the fire, and getting soberer and soberer\nevery minute?\n\n\"I was thinking about Jimmy.\"\n\n\"Would you mind telling about him? You know, you said you would some\ntime; but don't, if you'd rather not,\" said Tom, lowering his rough\nvoice respectfully.\n\n\"I like to talk about him; but there is n't much to tell,\" began Polly,\ngrateful for his interest. \"Sitting here with you reminded me of the\nway I used to sit with him when he was sick. We used to have such happy\ntimes, and it's so pleasant to think about them now.\"\n\n\"He was awfully good, was n't he?\"\n\n\"No, he was n't; but he tried to be, and mother says that is half the\nbattle. We used to get tired of trying; but we kept making resolutions,\nand working hard to keep'em. I don't think I got on much; but Jimmy\ndid, and every one loved him.\"\n\n\"Did n't you ever squabble, as we do?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, sometimes; but we could n't stay mad, and always made it\nup again as soon as we could. Jimmy used to come round first, and say,\n'All serene, Polly,' so kind and jolly, that I could n't help laughing\nand being friends right away.\"\n\n\"Did he not know a lot?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think he did, for he liked to study, and wanted to get on, so\nhe could help father. People used to call him a fine boy, and I felt so\nproud to hear it; but they did n't know half how wise he was, because\nhe did n't show off a bit. I suppose sisters always are grand of their\nbrothers; but I don't believe many girls had as much right to be as I\nhad.\"\n\n\"Most girls don't care two pins about their brothers; so that shows you\ndon't know much about it.\"\n\n\"Well, they ought to, if they don't; and they would if the boys were as\nkind to them as Jimmy was to me.\"\n\n\"Why, what did he do?\"\n\n\"Loved me dearly, and was n't ashamed to show it,\" cried Polly, with a\nsob in her voice, that made her answer very eloquent.\n\n\"What made him die, Polly?\" asked Tom, soberly, after little pause.\n\n\"He got hurt coasting, last winter; but he never told which boy did\nit, and he only lived a week. I helped take care of him; and he was so\npatient, I used to wonder at him, for he was in dreadful pain all time.\nHe gave me his books, and his dog, and his speckled hens, and his big\nknife, and said, 'Good-by, Polly,' and kissed me the last thing and then\nO Jimmy! Jimmy! If he only could come back!\"\n\nPoor Polly's eyes had been getting fuller and fuller, lips trembling\nmore and more, as she went on; when she came to that \"good-by,\" she\ncould n't get any further, but covered up her face, and cried as her\nheart would break. Tom was full of sympathy, but did n't know how to\nshow it; so he sat shaking up the camphor bottle, and trying to think of\nsomething proper and comfortable to say, when Fanny came to the rescue,\nand cuddled Polly in her arms, with soothing little pats and whispers\nand kisses, till the tears stopped, and Polly said, she \"did n't mean\nto, and would n't any more. I've been thinking about my dear boy all\nthe evening, for Tom reminds me of him,\" she added, with a sigh.\n\n\"Me? How can I, when I ain't a bit like him?\" cried Tom, amazed.\n\n\"But you are in some ways.\"\n\n\"Wish I was; but I can't be, for he was good, you know.\"\n\n\"So are you, when you choose. Has n't he been good and patient, and\ndon't we all like to pet him when he's clever, Fan?\"' said Polly, whose\nheart was still aching for her brother, and ready for his sake to find\nvirtues even in tormenting Tom.\n\n\"Yes; I don't know the boy lately; but he'll be as bad as ever when\nhe's well,\" returned Fanny, who had n't much faith in sick-bed\nrepentances.\n\n\"Much you know about it,\" growled Tom, lying down again, for he had sat\nbolt upright when Polly made the astounding declaration that he was\nlike the well-beloved Jimmy. That simple little history had made a deep\nimpression on Tom, and the tearful ending touched the tender spot\nthat most boys hide so carefully. It is very pleasant to be loved and\nadmired, very sweet to think we shall be missed and mourned when we die;\nand Tom was seized with a sudden desire to imitate this boy, who had n't\ndone anything wonderful, yet was so dear to his sister, that she cried\nfor him a whole year after he was dead; so studious and clever, the\npeople called him \"a fine fellow\"; and so anxious to be good, that he\nkept on trying, till he was better even than Polly, whom Tom privately\nconsidered a model of virtue, as girls go.\n\n\"I just wish I had a sister like you,\" he broke out, all of a sudden.\n\n\"And I just wish I had a brother like Jim,\" cried Fanny, for she felt\nthe reproach in Tom's words, and knew she deserved it.\n\n\"I should n't think you'd envy anybody, for you've got one another,\"\nsaid Polly, with such a wistful look, that it suddenly set Tom and Fanny\nto wondering why they did n't have better times together, and enjoy\nthemselves, as Polly and Jim did.\n\n\"Fan don't care for anybody but herself,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Tom is such a bear,\" retorted Fanny.\n\n\"I would n't say such things, for if anything should happen to either of\nyou, the other one would feel so sorry. Every cross word I ever said to\nJimmy comes back now, and makes me wish I had n't.\"\n\nTwo great tears rolled down Polly's cheeks, and were quietly wiped away;\nbut I think they watered that sweet sentiment, called fraternal love,\nwhich till now had been neglected in the hearts of this brother and\nsister. They did n't say anything then, or make any plans, or confess\nany faults; but when they parted for the night, Fanny gave the wounded\nhead a gentle pat (Tom never would have forgiven her if she had kissed\nhim), and said, in a whisper, \"I hope you'll have a good sleep, Tommy,\ndear.\"\n\nAnd Tom nodded back at her, with a hearty \"Same to you, Fan.\"\n\nThat was all; but it meant a good deal, for the voices were kind,\nand the eyes met full of that affection which makes words of little\nconsequence. Polly saw it; and though she did n't know that she had\nmade the sunshine, it shone back upon her so pleasantly, that she fell\nhappily asleep, though her Jimmy was n't there to say \"good-night.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. SCRAPES\n\n\nAFTER being unusually good, children are apt to turn short round and\nrefresh themselves by acting like Sancho. For a week after Tom's mishap,\nthe young folks were quite angelic, so much so that grandma said she was\nafraid \"something was going to happen to them.\" The dear old lady need\nn't have felt anxious, for such excessive virtue does n't last long\nenough to lead to translation, except with little prigs in the goody\nstory-books; and no sooner was Tom on his legs again, when the whole\nparty went astray, and much tribulation was the consequence.\n\nIt all began with \"Polly's stupidity,\" as Fan said afterward. Just as\nPolly ran down to meet Mr. Shaw one evening, and was helping him off\nwith his coat, the bell rang, and a fine bouquet of hothouse flowers was\nleft in Polly's hands, for she never could learn city ways, and opened\nthe door herself.\n\n\"Hey! what's this? My little Polly is beginning early, after all,\" said\nMr. Shaw, laughing, as he watched the girl's face dimple and flush, as\nshe smelt the lovely nosegay, and glanced at a note half hidden in the\nheliotrope.\n\nNow, if Polly had n't been \"stupid,\" as Fan said, she would have had\nher wits about her, and let it pass; but, you see, Polly was an honest\nlittle soul and it never occurred to her that there was any need of\nconcealment, so she answered in her straightforward way, \"Oh, they ain't\nfor me, sir; they are for Fan; from Mr. Frank, I guess. She'll be so\npleased.\"\n\n\"That puppy sends her things of this sort, does he?\" And Mr. Shaw looked\nfar from pleased as he pulled out the note, and coolly opened it.\n\nPolly had her doubts about Fan's approval of that \"sort of thing,\" but\ndared not say a word, and stood thinking how she used to show her father\nthe funny valentines the boys sent her, and how they laughed over them\ntogether. But Mr. Shaw did not laugh when he had read the sentimental\nverses accompanying the bouquet, and his face quite scared Polly, as he\nasked, angrily, \"How long has this nonsense been going on?\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir, I don't know. Fan does n't mean any harm. I wish I had n't\nsaid anything!\" stammered Polly, remembering the promise given to Fanny\nthe day of the concert. She had forgotten all about it and had become\naccustomed to see the \"big boys,\" as she called Mr. Frank and his\nfriends, with the girls on all occasions. Now, it suddenly occurred to\nher that Mr. Shaw did n't like such amusements, and had forbidden Fan to\nindulge in them. \"Oh, dear! how mad she will be. Well, I can't help it.\nGirls should n't have secrets from their fathers, then there would n't\nbe any fuss,\" thought Polly, as she watched Mr. Shaw twist up the pink\nnote and poke it back among the flowers which he took from her, saying,\nshortly, \"Send Fanny to me in the library.\"\n\n\"Now you've done it, you stupid thing!\" cried Fanny, both angry and\ndismayed, when Polly delivered the message.\n\n\"Why, what else could I do?\" asked Polly, much disturbed.\n\n\"Let him think the bouquet was for you; then there'd have been no\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"But that would have been doing a lie, which is most as bad as telling\none.\"\n\n\"Don't be a goose. You've got me into a scrape, and you ought to help\nme out.\"\n\n\"I will if I can; but I won't tell lies for anybody!\" cried Polly,\ngetting excited.\n\n\"Nobody wants you to just hold, your tongue, and let me manage.\"\n\n\"Then I'd better not go down,\" began Polly, when a stern voice from\nbelow called, like Bluebeard, \"Are you coming down?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered a meek voice; and Fanny clutched Polly, whispering,\n\"You must come; I'm frightened out of my wits when he speaks like that.\nStand by me, Polly; there's a dear.\"\n\n\"I will,\" whispered \"sister Ann\"; and down they went with fluttering\nhearts.\n\nMr. Shaw stood on the rug, looking rather grim; the bouquet lay on the\ntable, and beside it a note, directed to \"Frank Moore, Esq.,\" in a very\ndecided hand, with a fierce-looking flourish after the \"Esq.\" Pointing\nto this impressive epistle, Mr. Shaw said, knitting his black eyebrows\nas he looked at Fanny, \"I'm going to put a stop to this nonsense\nat once; and if I see any more of it, I'll send you to school in a\nCanadian convent.\"\n\nThis awful threat quite took Polly's breath away; but Fanny had heard it\nbefore, and having a temper of her own, said, pertly, \"I'm sure I have\nn't done anything so very dreadful. I can't help it if the boys send me\nphilopena presents, as they do to the other girls.\"\n\n\"There was nothing about philopenas in the note. But that's not the\nquestion. I forbid you to have anything to do with this Moore. He's not\na boy, but a fast fellow, and I won't have him about. You knew this, and\nyet disobeyed me.\"\n\n\"I hardly ever see him,\" began Fanny.\n\n\"Is that true?\" asked Mr. Shaw, turning suddenly to Polly.\n\n\"Oh, please, sir, don't ask me. I promised I would n't that is Fanny\nwill tell you,\" cried Polly, quite red with distress at the predicament\nshe was in.\n\n\"No matter about your promise; tell me all you know of this absurd\naffair. It will do Fanny more good than harm.\" And Mr. Shaw sat down\nlooking more amiable, for Polly's dismay touched him.\n\n\"May I?\" she whispered to Fanny.\n\n\"I don't care,\" answered Fan, looking both angry and ashamed, as she\nstood sullenly tying knots in her handkerchief.\n\nSo Polly told, with much reluctance and much questioning, all she knew\nof the walks, the lunches, the meetings, and the notes. It was n't much,\nand evidently less serious than Mr. Shaw expected; for, as he listened,\nhis eyebrows smoothed themselves out, and more than once his lips\ntwitched as if he wanted to laugh, for after all, it was rather comical\nto see how the young people aped their elders, playing the new-fashioned\ngame, quite unconscious of its real beauty, power, and sacredness.\n\n\"Oh, please, sir, don't blame Fan much, for she truly is n't half as\nsilly as Trix and the other, girls. She would n't go sleigh-riding,\nthough Mr. Frank teased, and she wanted to ever so much. She's sorry,\nI know, and won't forget what you say any more, if you'll forgive her\nthis once,\" cried Polly, very earnestly, when the foolish little story\nwas told.\n\n\"I don't see how I can help it, when you plead so well for her. Come\nhere, Fan, and mind this one thing; drop all this nonsense, and attend\nto your books, or off you go; and Canada is no joke in winter time, let\nme tell you.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Mr. Shaw stroked his sulky daughter's cheek, hoping to see\nsome sign of regret; but Fanny felt injured, and would n't show that\nshe was sorry, so she only said, pettishly, \"I suppose I can have my\nflowers, now the fuss is over.\"\n\n\"They are going straight back where they came from, with a line from me,\nwhich will keep that puppy from ever sending you any more.\" Ringing\nthe bell, Mr. Shaw despatched the unfortunate posy, and then turned to\nPolly, saying, kindly but gravely, \"Set this silly child of mine a good\nexample and do your best for her, won't you?\"\n\n\"Me? What can I do, sir?\" asked Polly, looking ready, but quite ignorant\nhow to begin.\n\n\"Make her as like yourself as possible, my dear; nothing would please me\nbetter. Now go, and let us hear no more of this folly.\"\n\nThey went without a word, and Mr. Shaw heard no more of the affair; but\npoor Polly did, for Fan scolded her, till Polly thought seriously of\npacking up and going home next day. I really have n't the heart to\nrelate the dreadful lectures she got, the snubs she suffered, or the\ncold shoulders turned upon her for several days after this. Polly's\nheart was full, but she told no one, and bore her trouble silently,\nfeeling her friend's ingratitude and injustice deeply.\n\nTom found out what the matter was, and sided with Polly, which\nproceeding led to scrape number two.\n\n\"Where's Fan?\" asked the young gentleman, strolling into his sister's\nroom, where Polly lay on the sofa, trying to forget her troubles in an\ninteresting book.\n\n\"Down stairs, seeing company.\"\n\n\"Why did n't you go, too?\"\n\n\"I don't like Trix, and I don't know her fine New York friends.\"\n\n\"Don't want to, neither, why don't you say?\"\n\n\"Not polite.\"\n\n\"Who cares? I say, Polly, come and have some fun.\"\n\n\"I'd rather read.\"\n\n\"That is n't polite.\"\n\nPolly laughed, and turned a page. Tom whistled a minute, then sighed\ndeeply, and put his hand to his forehead, which the black plaster still\nadorned.\n\n\"Does your head ache?\" asked Polly.\n\n\"Awfully.\"\n\n\"Better lie down, then.\"\n\n\"Can't; I'm fidgety, and want to be'amoosed' as Pug says.\"\n\n\"Just wait till I finish my chapter, and then I'll come,\" said pitiful\nPolly.\n\n\"All right,\" returned the perjured boy, who had discovered that a broken\nhead was sometimes more useful than a whole one, and exulting in his\nbase stratagem, he roved about the room, till Fan's bureau arrested him.\nIt was covered with all sorts of finery, for she had dressed in a hurry,\nand left everything topsy-turvy. A well-conducted boy would have let\nthings alone, or a moral brother would have put things to rights; being\nneither, Tom rummaged to his hearts content, till Fan's drawers looked\nas if some one had been making hay in them. He tried the effect of\near-rings, ribbons, and collars; wound up the watch, though it was n't\ntime; burnt his inquisitive nose with smelling-salts; deluged his grimy\nhandkerchief with Fan's best cologne; anointed his curly crop with her\nhair-oil; powdered his face with her violet-powder; and finished off\nby pinning on a bunch of false ringlets, which Fanny tried, to keep a\nprofound secret. The ravages committed by this bad boy are beyond\nthe power of language to describe, as he revelled in the interesting\ndrawers, boxes, and cases, which held his sister's treasures.\n\nWhen the curls had been put on, with much pricking of fingers, and a\nblue ribbon added, la Fan, he surveyed himself with satisfaction, and\nconsidered the effect so fine, that he was inspired to try a still\ngreater metamorphosis. The dress Fan had taken off lay on a chair,\nand into it got Tom, chuckling with suppressed laughter, for Polly\nwas absorbed, and the bed-curtains hid his iniquity. Fan's best velvet\njacket and hat, ermine muff, and a sofa-pillow for pannier, finished off\nthe costume, and tripping along with elbows out, Tom appeared before\nthe amazed Polly just as the chapter ended. She enjoyed the joke so\nheartily, that Tom forgot consequences, and proposed going down into the\nparlor to surprise, the girls.\n\n\"Goodness, no! Fanny never would forgive us if you showed her curls and\nthings to those people. There are gentlemen among them, and it would n't\nbe proper,\" said Polly, alarmed at the idea.\n\n\"All the more fun. Fan has n't treated you well, and it will serve her\nright if you introduce me as your dear friend, Miss Shaw. Come on, it\nwill be a jolly lark.\"\n\n\"I would n't for the world; it would be so mean. Take'em off, Tom, and\nI'll play anything else you like.\"\n\n\"I ain't going to dress up for nothing; I look so lovely, someone must\nadmire me. Take me down, Polly, and see if they don't call me'a sweet\ncreature.'\"\n\nTom looked so unutterably ridiculous as he tossed his curls and pranced,\nthat Polly went off into another gale of merriment; but even while she\nlaughed, she resolved not to let him mortify his sister.\n\n\"Now, then, get out of the way if you won't come; I'm going down,\" said\nTom.\n\n\"No, you're not.\"\n\n\"How will you help it, Miss Prim?\"\n\n\"So.\" And Polly locked the door, put the key in her pocket, and nodded\nat him defiantly.\n\nTom was a pepper-pot as to temper, and anything like opposition always\nhad a bad effect. Forgetting his costume, he strode up to Polly, saying,\nwith a threatening wag of the head, \"None of that. I won't stand it.\"\n\n\"Promise not to plague Fan, and I'll let you out.\"\n\n\"Won't promise anything. Give me that key, or I'll make you.\"\n\n\"Now, Tom, don't be savage. I only want to keep you out of a scrape, for\nFan will be raging if you go. Take off her things, and I'll give up.\"\n\nTom vouchsafed no reply, but marched to the other door, which was fast,\nas Polly knew, looked out of the three-story window, and finding no\nescape possible, came back with a wrathful face. \"Will you give me that\nkey?\"\n\n\"No, I won't,\" said Polly, valiantly.\n\n\"I'm stronger than you are; so you'd better hand over.\"\n\n\"I know you are; but it's cowardly for a great boy like you to rob a\ngirl.\"\n\n\"I don't want to hurt you; but, by George! I won't stand this!\"\n\nTom paused as Polly spoke, evidently ashamed of himself; but his temper\nwas up, and he would n't give in. If Polly had cried a little just\nhere, he would have yielded; unfortunately she giggled, for Tom's fierce\nattitude was such a funny contrast to his dress that she could n't help\nit. That settled the matter. No girl that ever lived should giggle at\nhim, much less lock him up like a small child. Without a word, he made\na grab at Polly's arm, for the hand holding the key was still in her,\npocket. With her other hand she clutched her frock, and for a minute\nheld on stoutly. But Tom's strong fingers were irresistible; rip went\nthe pocket, out came the hand, and with a cry of pain from Polly, the\nkey fell on the floor.\n\n\"It's your own fault if you're hurt. I did n't mean to,\" muttered Tom,\nas he hastily departed, leaving Polly to groan over her sprained wrist.\nHe went down, but not into the parlor, for somehow the joke seemed to\nhave lost its relish; so he made the girls in the kitchen laugh, and\nthen crept up the back way, hoping to make it all right with Polly. But\nshe had gone to grandma's room, for, though the old lady was out, it\nseemed a refuge. He had just time to get things in order, when Fanny\ncame up, crosser than ever; for Trix had been telling her of all sorts\nof fun in which she might have had a share, if Polly had held her\ntongue.\n\n\"Where is she?\" asked Fan, wishing to vent her vexation on her friend.\n\n\"Moping in her room, I suppose,\" replied Tom, who was discovered reading\nstudiously.\n\nNow, while this had been happening, Maud had been getting into hot\nwater also; for when her maid left her, to see a friend below, Miss Maud\nparaded into Polly's room, and solaced herself with mischief. In an evil\nhour Polly had let her play boat in her big trunk, which stood empty.\nSince then Polly had stored some of her most private treasures in the\nupper tray, so that she might feel sure they were safe from all eyes.\nShe had forgotten to lock the trunk, and when Maud raised the lid to\nbegin her voyage, several objects of interest met her eyes. She was deep\nin her researches when Fan came in and looked over her shoulder, feeling\ntoo cross with Polly to chide Maud.\n\nAs Polly had no money for presents, she had exerted her ingenuity\nto devise all sorts of gifts, hoping by quantity to atone for any\nshortcomings in quality. Some of her attempts were successful, others\nwere failures; but she kept them all, fine or funny, knowing the\nchildren at home would enjoy anything new. Some of Maud's cast-off toys\nhad been neatly mended for Kitty; some of Fan's old ribbons and laces\nwere converted into dolls' finery; and Tom's little figures, whittled\nout of wood in idle minutes, were laid away to show Will what could be\ndone with a knife.\n\n\"What rubbish!\" said Fanny.\n\n\"Queer girl, is n't she?\" added Tom, who had followed to see what was\ngoing on.\n\n\"Don't you laugh at Polly's things. She makes nicer dolls than you, Fan;\nand she can wite and dwar ever so much better than Tom,\" cried Maud.\n\"How do you know? I never saw her draw,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Here's a book with lots of pictures in it. I can't wead the witing;\nbut the pictures are so funny.\"\n\nEager to display her friend's accomplishments, Maud pulled out a fat\nlittle book, marked \"Polly's Journal,\" and spread it in her lap.\n\n\"Only the pictures; no harm in taking a look at'em,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Just one peep,\" answered Fanny; and the next minute both were laughing\nat a droll sketch of Tom in the gutter, with the big dog howling over\nhim, and the velocipede running away. Very rough and faulty, but so\nfunny, that it was evident Polly's sense of humor was strong. A few\npages farther back came Fanny and Mr. Frank, caricatured; then grandma,\ncarefully done; Tom reciting his battle-piece; Mr. Shaw and Polly in\nthe park; Maud being borne away by Katy; and all the school-girls turned\ninto ridicule with an unsparing hand.\n\n\"Sly little puss, to make fun of us behind our backs,\" said Fan, rather\nnettled by Polly's quiet retaliation for many slights from herself and\nfriends.\n\n\"She does draw well,\" said Tom, looking critically at the sketch of a\nboy with a pleasant face, round whom Polly had drawn rays like the sun,\nand under which was written, \"My dear Jimmy.\"\n\n\"You would n't admire her, if you knew what she wrote here about you,\"\nsaid Fanny, whose eyes had strayed to the written page opposite, and\nlingered there long enough to read something that excited her curiosity.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Tom, forgetting his honorable resolves for a minute.\n\n\"She says, 'I try to like Tom, and when he is pleasant we do very well;\nbut he don't stay so long. He gets cross and rough, and disrespectful to\nhis father and mother, and plagues us girls, and is so horrid I almost\nhate him. It's very wrong, but I can't help it.' How do you like that?\"\nasked Fanny.\n\n\"Go ahead, and see how she comes down on you, ma'am,\" retorted Tom, who\nhad read on a bit.\n\n\"Does she?\" And Fanny continued, rapidly: \"As for Fan, I don't think\nwe can be friends any more; for she told her father a lie, and won't\nforgive me for not doing so too. I used to think her a very fine girl;\nbut I don't now. If she would be as she was when I first knew her, I\nshould love her just the same; but she is n't kind to me; and though she\nis always talking about politeness, I don't think it is polite to treat\ncompany as she does me. She thinks I am odd and countrified, and I dare\nsay I am; but I should n't laugh at a girl's clothes because she was\npoor, or keep her out of the way because she did n't do just as other\ngirls do here. I see her make fun of me, and I can't feel as I did; and\nI'd go home, only it would seem ungrateful to Mr. Shaw and grandma, and\nI do love them dearly.\"\n\n\"I say, Fan, you've got it now. Shut the book and come away,\" cried\nTom, enjoying this broadside immensely, but feeling guilty, as well he\nmight.\n\n\"Just one bit more,\" whispered Fanny, turning on a page or two, and\nstopping at a leaf that was blurred here and there as if tears had\ndropped on it.\n\n\"Sunday morning, early. Nobody is up to spoil my quiet time, and I must\nwrite my journal, for I've been so bad lately, I could n't bear to do\nit. I'm glad my visit is most done, for things worry me here, and there\nis n't any one to help me get right when I get wrong. I used to envy\nFanny; but I don't now, for her father and mother don't take care of her\nas mine do of me. She is afraid of her father, and makes her mother do\nas she likes. I'm glad I came though, for I see money don't give\npeople everything; but I'd like a little all the same, for it is so\ncomfortable to buy nice things. I read over my journal just now, and\nI'm afraid it's not a good one; for I have said all sorts of things\nabout the people here, and it is n't kind. I should tear it out, only I\npromised to keep my diary, and I want to talk over things that puzzle me\nwith mother. I see now that it is my fault a good deal; for I have n't\nbeen half as patient, and pleasant as I ought to be. I will truly try\nfor the rest of the time, and be as good and grateful as I can; for I\nwant them to like me, though I'm only'an old-fashioned country girl.'\"\n\nThat last sentence made Fanny shut the book, with a face full of\nself-reproach; for she had said those words herself, in a fit of\npetulance, and Polly had made no answer, though her eyes filled and her\ncheeks burned. Fan opened her lips to say something, but not a sound\nfollowed, for there stood Polly looking at them with an expression they\nhad never seen before.\n\n\"What are you doing with my things?\" she demanded, in a low tone, while\nher eyes kindled and her color changed.\n\n\"Maud showed us a book she found, and we were just looking at the\npictures,\" began Fanny, dropping it as if it burnt her fingers.\n\n\"And reading my journal, and laughing at my presents, and then putting\nthe blame on Maud. It's the meanest thing I ever saw; and I'll never\nforgive you as long as I live!\"\n\nPolly said, this all in one indignant breath, and then as if afraid\nof saying too much, ran out of the room with such a look of mingled\ncontempt, grief, and anger, that the three culprits stood dumb with\nshame. Tom had n't even a whistle at his command; Maud was so scared at\ngentle Polly's outbreak, that she sat as still as a mouse; while\nFanny, conscience stricken, laid back the poor little presents with a\nrespectful hand, for somehow the thought of Polly's poverty came over\nher as it never had done before; and these odds and ends, so carefully\ntreasured up for those at home, touched Fanny, and grew beautiful in her\neyes. As she laid by the little book, the confessions in it reproached\nher more sharply that any words Polly could have spoken; for she had\nlaughed at her friend, had slighted her sometimes, and been unforgiving\nfor an innocent offence. That last page, where Polly took the blame on\nherself, and promised to \"truly try\" to be more kind and patient, went\nto Fanny's heart, melting all the coldness away, and she could only lay\nher head on the trunk, sobbing, \"It was n't Polly's fault; it was all\nmine.\"\n\nTom, still red with shame at being caught in such a scrape, left Fanny\nto her tears, and went manfully away to find the injured Polly, and\nconfess his manifold transgressions. But Polly could n't be found. He\nsearched high and low in every room, yet no sign of the girt appeared,\nand Tom began to get anxious. \"She can't have run away home, can she?\"\nhe said to himself, as he paused before the hat-tree. There was the\nlittle round hat, and Tom gave it a remorseful smooth, remembering how\nmany times he had tweaked it half off, or poked it over poor Polly's\neyes. \"Maybe she's gone down to the office, to tell pa. 'T is n't a bit\nlike her, though. Anyway, I'll take a look round the corner.\"\n\nEager to get his boots, Tom pulled open the door of a dark closet under\nthe stairs, and nearly tumbled over backward with surprise; for there,\non the floor, with her head pillowed on a pair of rubbers, lay Polly\nin an attitude of despair. This mournful spectacle sent Tom's penitent\nspeech straight out of his head, and with an astonished \"Hullo!\" he\nstood and stared in impressive silence. Polly was n't crying, and lay\nso still, that Tom began to think she might be in a fit or a faint,\nand bent anxiously down to inspect the pathetic bunch. A glimpse of wet\neyelashes, a round cheek redder than usual, and lips parted by quick,\nbreathing, relieved his mind upon that point; so, taking courage, he sat\ndown on the boot-jack, and begged pardon like a man.\n\nNow, Polly was very angry, and I think she had a right to be; but she\nwas not resentful, and after the first flash was over, she soon began to\nfeel better about it. It was n't easy to forgive; but, as she listened\nto Tom's honest voice, getting gruff with remorse now and then, she\ncould n't harden her heart against him, or refuse to make up when he so\nfrankly owned that it \"was confounded mean to read her book that way.\"\nShe liked his coming and begging pardon at once; it was a handsome thing\nto do; she appreciated it, and forgave him in her heart some time before\nshe did with her lips; for, to tell the truth, Polly had a spice of\ngirlish malice, and rather liked to see domineering Tom eat humble-pie,\njust enough to do him good, you know. She felt that atonement was\nproper, and considered it no more than just that Fan should drench a\nhandkerchief or two with repentant tears, and that Tom should sit on\na very uncomfortable seat and call himself hard names for five or ten\nminutes before she relented.\n\n\"Come, now, do say a word to a fellow. I'm getting the worst of it,\nanyway; for there's Fan, crying her eyes out upstairs, and here are\nyou stowed away in a dark closet as dumb as a fish, and nobody but me to\nbring you both round. I'd have cut over to the Smythes and got ma home\nto fix things, only it looked like backing out of the scrape; so I did\nn't,\" said Tom, as a last appeal.\n\nPolly was glad to hear that Fan was crying. It would do her good; but\nshe could n't help softening to Tom, who did seem in a predicament\nbetween two weeping damsels. A little smile began to dimple the cheek\nthat was n't hidden, and then a hand came slowly out from under the\ncurly head, and was stretched toward him silently. Tom was just going\nto give it a hearty shake, when he saw a red mark on the wrist, and knew\nwhat made it. His face changed, and he took the chubby hand so gently,\nthat Polly peeped to see what it meant.\n\n\"Will you forgive that, too?\" he asked, in a whisper, stroking the red\nwrist.\n\n\"Yes, it don't hurt much now.\" And Polly drew her hand away, sorry he\nhad seen it.\n\n\"I was a beast, that's what I was!\" said Tom, in a tone of great\ndisgust. And just at that awkward minute down tumbled his father's\nold beaver over his head and face, putting a comical quencher on his\nself-reproaches. Of course, neither could help laughing at that; and\nwhen he emerged, Polly was sitting up, looking as much better for her\nshower as he did for his momentary eclipse.\n\n\"Fan feels dreadfully. Will you kiss and be friends, if I trot her\ndown?\" asked Tom, remembering his fellow-sinner.\n\n\"I'll go to her.\" And Polly whisked out of the closet as suddenly as\nshe had whisked in, leaving Tom sitting on the boot-jack, with a radiant\ncountenance.\n\nHow the girls made it up no one ever knew. But after much talking and\ncrying, kissing and laughing, the breach was healed, and peace declared.\nA slight haze still lingered in the air after the storm, for Fanny\nwas very humble and tender that evening; Tom a trifle pensive, but\ndistressingly polite, and Polly magnanimously friendly to every one; for\ngenerous natures like to forgive, and Polly enjoyed the petting after\nthe insult, like a very human girl.\n\nAs she was brushing her hair at bedtime there came a tap on her door\nand, opening it, she beheld nothing but a tall black bottle, with a\nstrip of red flannel tied round it like a cravat, and a cocked-hat note\non the cork. Inside were these lines, written in a sprawling hand with\nvery black ink:\n\nDEAR POLLY, Opydilldock is first-rate for sprains. You put a lot on the\nflannel and do up your wrist, and I guess it will be all right in the\nmorning. Will you come a sleigh-ride tomorrow? I'm awful sorry I hurt\nyou.\n\nTOM\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. GRANDMA\n\n\n\"WHERE'S Polly?\" asked Fan one snowy afternoon, as she came into the\ndining-room where Tom was reposing on the sofa with his boots in the\nair, absorbed in one of those delightful books in which boys are cast\naway on desert islands, where every known fruit, vegetable and flower\nis in its prime all the year round; or, lost in boundless forests, where\nthe young heroes have thrilling adventures, kill impossible beasts, and,\nwhen the author's invention gives out, suddenly find their way home,\nladen with tiger skins, tame buffaloes and other pleasing trophies of\ntheir prowess.\n\n\"Dun no,\" was Tom's brief reply, for he was just escaping from an\nalligator of the largest size.\n\n\"Do put down that stupid book, and let's do something,\" said Fanny,\nafter a listless stroll round the room.\n\n\"Hi, they've got him!\" was the only answer vouchsafed by the absorbed\nreader.\n\n\"Where's Polly?\" asked Maud, joining the party with her hands full of\npaper dolls all suffering for ball-dresses.\n\n\"Do get along, and don't bother me,\" cried Tom exasperated at the\ninterruption.\n\n\"Then tell us where she is. I'm sure you know, for she was down here a\nlittle while ago,\" said Fanny.\n\n\"Up in grandma's room, maybe.\"\n\n\"Provoking thing! you knew it all the time, and did n't tell, just to\nplague us,\" scolded Maud.\n\nBut Tom was now under water stabbing his alligator, and took no notice\nof the indignant departure of the young ladies.\n\n\"Polly's always poking up in grandma's room. I don't see what fun there\nis in it,\" said Fanny as they went up stairs.\n\n\"Polly's a verwy queer girl, and gwandma pets her a gweat deal more\nthan she does me,\" observed Maud, with an injured air.\n\n\"Let's peek and see what they are doing,\" whispered Fan, pausing at the\nhalf-open door.\n\nGrandma was sitting before a quaint old cabinet, the doors of which\nstood wide open, showing glimpses of the faded relics treasured there.\nOn a stool, at the old lady's feet, sat Polly, looking up with intent\nface and eager eyes, quite absorbed in the history of a high-heeled\nbrocade shoe which lay in her lap.\n\n\"Well, my dear,\" grandma was saying, \"she had it on the very day that\nUncle Joe came in as she sat at work, and said, 'Dolly, we must be\nmarried at once.' 'Very well, Joe,' says Aunt Dolly, and down she went\nto the parlor, where the minister was waiting, never stopping to change\nthe dimity dress she wore, and was actually married with her scissors\nand pin-ball at her side, and her thimble on. That was in war times,\n1812, my dear, and Uncle Joe was in the army, so he had to go, and he\ntook that very little pin-ball with him. Here it is with the mark of\na bullet through it, for he always said his Dolly's cushion saved his\nlife.\"\n\n\"How interesting that is!\" cried Polly, as she examined the faded\ncushion with the hole in it.\n\n\"Why, grandma, you never told me that story,\" said Fanny, hurrying in,\nfinding the prospect was a pleasant one for a stormy afternoon.\n\n\"You never asked me to tell you anything, my dear, so I kept my old\nstories to myself,\" answered grandma, quietly.\n\n\"Tell some now, please. May we stay and see the funny things?\" said Fan\nand Maud, eyeing the open cabinet with interest.\n\n\"If Polly likes; she is my company, and I am trying to entertain\nher, for I love to have her come,\" said grandma, with her old-time\npoliteness.\n\n\"Oh, yes! do let them stay and hear the stories. I've often told them\nwhat good times we have up here, and teased them to come, but they think\nit's too quiet. Now, sit down, girls, and let grandma go on. You see I\npick out something in the cabinet that looks interesting, and then\nshe tells me about it,\" said Polly, eager to include the girls in her\npleasures, and glad to get them interested in grandma's reminiscences,\nfor Polly knew how happy it made the lonely old lady to live over her\npast, and to have the children round her.\n\n\"Here are three drawers that have not been opened yet; each take one,\nand choose something from it for me to tell about,\" said Madam, quite\nexcited at the unusual interest in her treasures.\n\nSo the girls each opened a drawer and turned over the contents till they\nfound something they wanted to know about. Maud was ready first, and\nholding up an oddly shaped linen bag, with a big blue F embroidered on\nit, demanded her story. Grandma smiled as she smoothed the old thing\ntenderly, and began her story with evident pleasure.\n\n\"My sister Nelly and I went to visit an aunt of ours, when we were\nlittle girls, but we did n't have a very good time, for she was\nextremely strict. One afternoon, when she had gone out to tea, and old\nDebby, the maid, was asleep in her room, we sat on the doorstep, feeling\nhomesick, and ready for any thing to amuse us.\n\n\"'What shall we do?' said Nelly.\n\n\"Just as she spoke, a ripe plum dropped bounce on the grass before us,\nas if answering her question. It was all the plum's fault, for if it\nhad n't fallen at that minute, I never should have had the thought which\npopped into my mischievous mind.\n\n\"'Let's have as many as we want, and plague Aunt Betsey, to pay her for\nbeing so cross,' I said, giving Nelly half the great purple plum.\n\n\"'It would be dreadful naughty,' began Nelly,'but I guess we will,' she\nadded, as the sweet mouthful slipped down her throat.\n\n\"'Debby's asleep. Come on, then, and help me shake,' I said, getting\nup, eager for the fun.\n\n\"We shook and shook till we got red in the face, but not one dropped,\nfor the tree was large, and our little arms were not strong enough\nto stir the boughs. Then we threw stones, but only one green and one\nhalf-ripe one came down, and my last stone broke the shed window, so\nthere was an end of that.\n\n\"'It's as provoking as Aunt Betsey herself,' said Nelly, as we sat\ndown, out of breath.\n\n\"'I wish the wind would come and blow'em down for us,' panted I,\nstaring up at the plums with longing eyes.\n\n\"'If wishing would do any good, I should wish'em in my lap at once,'\nadded Nelly.\n\n\"'You might as well wish'em in your mouth and done with it, if you are\ntoo lazy to pick'em up. If the ladder was n't too heavy we could try\nthat,' said I, determined to have them.\n\n\"'You know we can't stir it, so what is the use of talking about it? You\nproposed getting the plums, now let's see you do it,' answered Nelly,\nrather crossly, for she had bitten the green plum, and it puckered her\nmouth.\n\n\"'Wait a minute, and you will see me do it,' cried I, as a new thought\ncame into my naughty head.\n\n\"'What are you taking your shoes and socks off for? You can't climb the\ntree, Fan.'\" 'Don't ask questions, but be ready to pick'em up when they\nfall, Miss Lazybones.' \"With this mysterious speech I pattered into\nthe house bare-footed and full of my plan. Up stairs I went to a window\nopening on the shed roof. Out I got, and creeping carefully along till\nI came near the tree, I stood up, and suddenly crowed like the little\nrooster. Nelly looked up, and stared, and laughed, and clapped her hands\nwhen she saw what I was going to do.\n\n\"'I'm afraid you'll slip and get hurt.'\" 'Don't care if I do; I'll\nhave those plums if I break my neck doing it,' and half sliding, half\nwalking I went down the sloping roof, till the boughs of the tree were\nwithin my reach.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" cried Nelly, dancing down below, as my first shake sent a\ndozen plums rattling round her.\n\n\"'Hurrah!\" cried I, letting go one branch and trying to reach another.\nBut as I did so my foot slipped, I tried to catch something to hold by,\nbut found nothing, and with a cry, down I fell, like a very big plum on\nthe grass below.\n\n\"Fortunately the shed was low, the grass was thick and the tree broke my\nfall, but I got a bad bump and a terrible shaking. Nelly thought I was\nkilled, and began to cry with her mouth full. But I picked myself up in\na minute, for I was used to such tumbles; and did n't mind the pain half\nas much as the loss of the plums.\n\n\"'Hush! Debby will hear and spoil all the fun. I said I'd get'em and I\nhave. See what lots have come down with me.'\" So there had, for my fall\nshook the tree almost as much as it did me, and the green and purple\nfruit lay all about us.\n\n\"By the time the bump on my forehead had swelled as big as a nut, our\naprons were half full, and we sat down to enjoy ourselves. But we did\nn't. O dear, no! for many of the plums were not ripe, some were hurt by\nthe birds, some crushed in falling, and many as hard as stones. Nelly\ngot stung by a wasp, my head began to ache, and we sat looking at one\nanother rather dismally, when Nelly had a bright idea.\n\n\"'Let's cook'em, then they'll be good, and we can put some away in\nour little pails for to-morrow.'\" 'That will be splendid! There's a\nfire in the kitchen, Debby always leaves the kettle on, and we can use\nher saucepan, and I know where the sugar is, and we'll have a grand\ntime.' \"In we went, and fell to work very quietly. It was a large,\nopen fire-place, with the coals nicely covered up, and the big kettle\nsimmering on the hook. We raked open the fire, put on the saucepan, and\nin it the best of our plums, with water enough to spoil them. But we did\nn't know that, and felt very important as we sat waiting for it to boil,\neach armed with a big spoon, while the sugar box stood between us ready\nto be used.\n\n\"How slow they were, to be sure! I never knew such obstinate things, for\nthey would n't soften, though they danced about in the boiling water,\nand bobbed against the cover as if they were doing their best.\n\n\"The sun began to get low, we were afraid Debby would come down, and\nstill those dreadful plums would n't look like sauce. At last they began\nto burst, the water got a lovely purple, we put lots of sugar in, and\nkept tasting till our aprons and faces were red, and our lips burnt with\nthe hot spoons.\n\n\"'There's too much juice,' said Nelly, shaking her head wisely. 'It\nought to be thick and nice like mamma's.' \"'I'll pour off some of the\njuice, and we can drink it,' said I, feeling that I'd made a mistake in\nmy cooking.\n\n\"So Nelly got a bowl, and I got a towel and lifted the big saucepan\ncarefully off. It was heavy and hot, and I was a little afraid of it,\nbut did n't like to say so. Just as I began to pour, Debby suddenly\ncalled from the top of the stairs, 'Children, what under the sun are you\ndoing?' It startled us both. Nelly dropped the bowl and ran. I dropped\nthe saucepan and did n't run, for a part of the hot juice splashed upon\nmy bare feet, and ankles, and made me scream with dreadful pain.\n\n\"Down rushed Debby to find me dancing about the kitchen with a great\nbump on my forehead, a big spoon in my hand, and a pair of bright purple\nfeet. The plums were lying all over the hearth, the saucepan in the\nmiddle of the room, the basin was broken, and the sugar swimming about\nas if the bowl had turned itself over trying to sweeten our mess for us.\n\n\"Debby was very good to me, for she never stopped to scold, but laid\nme down on the old sofa, and bound up my poor little feet with oil and\ncotton wool. Nelly, seeing me lie white and weak, thought I was dying,\nand went over to the neighbor's for Aunt Betsey, and burst in upon the\nold ladies sitting primly at, their tea, crying, distractedly, 'Oh, Aunt\nBetsey, come quick! for the saucepan fell off the shed, and Fan's feet\nare all boiled purple!' Nobody laughed at this funny message, and Aunt\nBetsey ran all the way home with a muffin in her hand and her ball in\nher pocket, though the knitting was left behind.\n\n\"I suffered a great deal, but I was n't sorry afterward, for I learned\nto love Aunt Betsey, who nursed me tenderly, and seemed to forget her\nstrict ways in her anxiety for me.\n\n\"This bag was made for my special comfort, and hung on the sofa where I\nlay all those weary days. Aunt kept it full of pretty patchwork or, what\nI liked better, ginger-nuts, and peppermint drops, to amuse me, though\nshe did n't approve of cosseting children up, any more than I do now.\"\n\n\"I like that vewy well, and I wish I could have been there,\" was Maud's\ncondescending remark, as she put back the little bag, after a careful\npeep inside, as if she hoped to find an ancient ginger-nut, or a\nwell-preserved peppermint drop still lingering in some corner.\n\n\"We had plums enough that autumn, but did n't seem to care much about\nthem, after all, for our prank became a household joke, and, for years,\nwe never saw the fruit, but Nelly would look at me with a funny face,\nand whisper, 'Purple stockings, Fan!'\"\n\n\"Thank you, ma'am,\" said Polly. \"Now, Fan, your turn next.\"\n\n\"Well, I've a bundle of old letters, and I'd like to know if there\nis any story about them,\" answered Fanny, hoping some romance might be\nforthcoming.\n\nGrandma turned over the little packet tied up with a faded pink ribbon;\na dozen yellow notes written on rough, thick paper, with red wafers\nstill adhering to the folds, showing plainly that they were written\nbefore the day of initial note-paper and self-sealing envelopes.\n\n\"They are not love-letters, deary, but notes from my mates after I left\nMiss Cotton's boarding-school. I don't think there is any story about\nthem,\" and grandma turned them over with spectacles before the dim eyes,\nso young and bright when they first read the very same notes.\n\nFanny was about to say, \"I'll choose again,\" when grandma began to\nlaugh so heartily that the girls felt sure she had caught some merry old\nmemory which would amuse them.\n\n\"Bless my heart, I have n't thought of that frolic this forty years.\nPoor, dear, giddy Sally Pomroy, and she's a great-grandmother now!\"\ncried the old lady, after reading one of the notes, and clearing the\nmist off her glasses.\n\n\"Now, please tell about her; I know it's something funny to make you\nlaugh so,\" said Polly and Fan together.\n\n\"Well, it was droll, and I'm glad I remembered it for it's just the\nstory to tell you young things.\n\n\"It was years ago,\" began grandma, briskly, \"and teachers were very much\nstricter than they are now. The girls at Miss Cotton's were not allowed\nlights in their rooms after nine o'clock, never went out alone, and were\nexpected to behave like models of propriety from morning till night.\n\n\"As you may imagine, ten young girls, full of spirits and fun, found\nthese rules hard to keep, and made up for good behavior in public by all\nsorts of frolics in private.\n\n\"Miss Cotton and her brother sat in the back parlor after school was\nover, and the young ladies were sent to bed. Mr. John was very deaf,\nand Miss Priscilla very near-sighted, two convenient afflictions for the\ngirls on some occasions, but once they proved quite the reverse, as you\nshall hear.\n\n\"We had been very prim for a week, and our bottled up spirits could no\nlonger be contained; so we planed a revel after our own hearts, and set\nour wits to work to execute it.\n\n\"The first obstacle was surmounted in this way. As none of us could get\nout alone, we resolved to lower Sally from the window, for she was light\nand small, and very smart.\n\n\"With our combined pocket-money she was to buy nuts and candy, cake and\nfruit, pie, and a candle, so that we might have a light, after Betsey\ntook ours away as usual. We were to darken the window of the inner\nchamber, set a watch in the little entry, light up, and then for a good\ntime.\n\n\"At eight o'clock on the appointed evening, several of us professed\ngreat weariness, and went to our room, leaving the rest sewing\nvirtuously with Miss Cotton, who read Hannah More's Sacred Dramas aloud,\nin a way that fitted the listeners for bed as well as a dose of opium\nwould have done.\n\n\"I am sorry to say I was one of the ringleaders; and as soon as we got\nup stairs, produced the rope provided for the purpose, and invited Sally\nto be lowered. It was an old-fashioned house, sloping down behind, and\nthe closet window chosen by us was not many feet from the ground.\n\n\"It was a summer evening, so that at eight o'clock it was still light;\nbut we were not afraid of being seen, for the street was a lonely one,\nand our only neighbors two old ladies, who put down their curtains at\nsunset, and never looked out till morning.\n\n\"Sally had been bribed by promises of as many'goodies' as she could\neat, and being a regular madcap, she was ready for anything.\n\n\"Tying the rope round her waist she crept out, and we let her safely\ndown, sent a big basket after her, and saw her slip round the corner in\nmy big sun bonnet and another girl's shawl, so that she should not be\nrecognized.\n\n\"Then we put our night-gowns over our dresses, and were laid peacefully\nin bed when Betsey came up, earlier than usual; for it was evident that\nMiss Cotton felt a little suspicious at our sudden weariness.\n\n\"For half an hour we lay laughing and whispering, as we waited for the\nsignal from Sally. At last we heard a cricket chirp shrilly under the\nwindow, and flying up, saw a little figure below in the twilight.\n\n\"'O, quick! quick!' cried Sally, panting with haste. 'Draw up the basket\nand then get me in, for I saw Mr. Cotton in the market, and ran all\nthe way home, so that I might get in before he came.' Up came the heavy\nbasket, bumping and scraping on the way, and smelling, O, so nice!\nDown went the rope, and with a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all\ntogether, we hoisted poor Sally half-way up to the window, when, sad to\ntell, the rope slipped and down she fell, only being saved from broken\nbones by the hay-cock under the window.\n\n\"'He's coming! he's coming! O pull me up, for mercy sake!' cried\nSally, scrambling to her feet unhurt, but a good deal shaken.\n\n\"We saw a dark figure approaching, and dragged her in with more bumping\nand scraping, and embraced her with rapture, for we had just escaped\nbeing detected by Mr. John, whose eyes were as sharp as his ears were\ndull.\n\n\"We heard the front-door shut, then a murmur of voices, and then\nBetsey's heavy step coming up stairs.\n\n\"Under the bed went the basket, and into the beds went the conspirators,\nand nothing could have been more decorous than the appearance of the\nroom when Betsey popped her head in.\n\n\"'Master's an old fidget to send me travelling up again, just because\nhe fancied he saw something amiss at the window. Nothing but a curtain\nflapping, or a shadder, for the poor dears is sleeping like lambs.' We\nheard her say this to herself, and a general titter agitated the white\ncoverlets as she departed.\n\n\"Sally was in high feather at the success of her exploit, and danced\nabout like an elf, as she put her night-gown on over her frock, braided\nher hair in funny little tails all over her head, and fastened the great\nred pin-cushion on her bosom for a breast-pin in honor of the feast.\n\n\"The other girls went to their rooms as agreed upon, and all was soon\ndark and still up stairs, while Miss Cotton began to enjoy herself\nbelow, as she always did when'her young charges' were safely disposed\nof.\n\n\"Then ghosts began to walk, and the mice scuttled back to their holes\nin alarm, for white figures glided from room to room, till all were\nassembled in the little chamber.\n\n\"The watch was set at the entry door, the signal agreed upon, the candle\nlighted, and the feast spread forth upon a newspaper on the bed, with\nthe coverlet arranged so that it could be whisked over the refreshments\nat a moment's notice.\n\n\"How good everything was, to be sure! I don't think I've eaten any\npies since that had such a delicious flavor as those broken ones, eaten\nhastily, in that little oven of a room, with Sally making jokes and the\nothers enjoying stolen sweets with true girlish relish. Of course it was\nvery wicked, but I must tell the truth.\n\n\"We were just beginning on the cake when the loud scratching of a rat\ndisturbed us.\n\n\"'The signal! fly! run! hide! Hush, don't laugh!' cried several voices,\nand we scuttled into bed as rapidly and noiselessly as possible, with\nour mouths and hands full.\n\n\"A long pause, broken by more scratching; but as no one came, we decided\non sending to inquire what it meant. I went and found Mary, the picket\nguard half asleep, and longing for her share of the feast.\n\n\"'It was a real rat; I've not made a sound. Do go and finish; I'm\ntired of this,' said Mary, slapping away at the mosquitoes.\n\n\"Back I hurried with the good news. Every one flew up, briskly. We\nlighted the candle again, and returned to our revel. The refreshments\nwere somewhat injured by Sally's bouncing in among them, bit we did n't\ncare, and soon finished the cake.\n\n\"'Now let's have the nuts,' I said, groping for the paper bag.\n\n\"'They are almonds and peanuts, so we can crack them with our teeth. Be\nsure you get the bag by the right end,' said Sally.\n\n\"'I know what I'm about,' and to show her that it was all right, I\ngave the bag a little shake, when out flew the nuts, rattling like a\nhail-storm all over the uncarpeted floor.\n\n\"'Now you've done it,' cried Sally, as Mary scratched like a mad rat,\nand a door creaked below, for Miss Cotton was not deaf.\n\n\"Such a flurry as we were in! Out went the candle, and each one rushed\naway with as much of the feast as she could seize in her haste. Sally\ndived into her bed, recklessly demolishing the last pie, and scattering\nthe candy far and wide.\n\n\"Poor Mary was nearly caught for Miss Cotton was quicker than Betsey,\nand our guard had to run for her life.\n\n\"Our room was the first, and was in good order, though the two flushed\nfaces on the pillows were rather suspicious. Miss Cotton stood staring\nabout her, looking so funny, without her cap, that my bedfellow would\nhave gone off in a fit of laughter, if I had not pinched her warningly.\n\n\"'Young ladies, what is this unseemly noise?' No answer from us but\na faint snore. Miss Cotton marched into the next room, put the same\nquestion and received the same reply.\n\n\"In the third chamber lay Sally, and we trembled as the old lady went\nin. Sitting up, we peeped and listened breathlessly.\n\n\"'Sarah, I command you to tell me what this all means?' But Sally only\nsighed in her sleep, and muttered, wickedly, 'Ma, take me home. I'm\nstarved at Cotton's.' 'Mercy on me! is the child going to have a fever?'\ncried the old lady, who did not observe the tell tale nuts at her feet.\n\n\"'So dull, so strict! O take me home!' moaned Sally, tossing her arms\nand gurgling, like a naughty little gypsy.\n\n\"That last bit of acting upset the whole concern, for as she tossed her\narms she showed the big red cushion on her breast. Near-sighted as she\nwas, that ridiculous object could not escape Miss Cotton, neither did\nthe orange that rolled out from the pillow, nor the boots appearing at\nthe foot of the bed.\n\n\"With sudden energy the old lady plucked off the cover, and there lay\nSally with her hair dressed, la Topsy, her absurd breast-pin and her\ndusty boots, among papers of candy, bits of pie and cake, oranges and\napples, and a candle upside down burning a hole in the sheet.\n\n\"At the sound of Miss Cotton's horrified exclamation Sally woke up, and\nbegan laughing so merrily that none of us could resist following her\nexample, and the rooms rang with merriment far many minutes. I really\ndon't know when we should have stopped if Sally had not got choked with\nthe nut she had in her mouth, and so frightened us nearly out of our\nwits.\"\n\n\"What became of the things, and how were you punished?\" asked Fan, in\nthe middle of her laughter.\n\n\"The remains of the feast went to the pig, and we were kept on bread and\nwater for three days.\"\n\n\"Did that cure you?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, no! we had half a dozen other frolics that very summer; and\nalthough I cannot help laughing at the remembrance of this, you must not\nthink, child, that I approve of such conduct, or excuse it. No, no, my\ndear, far from it.\"\n\n\"I call that a tip-top story! Drive on, grandma, and tell one about\nboys,\" broke in a new voice, and there was Tom astride of a chair\nlistening and laughing with all his might, for his book had come to an\nend, and he had joined the party unobserved.\n\n\"Wait for your turn, Tommy. Now, Polly, dear, what will you have?\"\nsaid grandma, looking, so lively and happy, that it was very evident\n\"reminiscing\" did her good.\n\n\"Let mine come last, and tell one for Tom next,\" said Polly, looking\nround, and beckoning him nearer.\n\nHe came and sat himself cross-legged on the floor, before the lower\ndrawer of the cabinet, which grandma opened for him, saying, with a\nbenign stroke of the curly head, \"There, dear, that's where I keep the\nlittle memorials of my brother Jack. Poor lad, he was lost at sea, you\nknow. Well, choose anything you like, and I'll try to remember a story\nabout it.\"\n\nTom made a rapid rummage, and fished up a little broken pistol.\n\n\"There, that's the chap for me! Wish it was n't spoilt, then we'd have\nfun popping away at the cats in the yard. Now, then, grandma.\"\n\n\"I remember one of Jack's pranks, when that was used with great effect,\"\nsaid grandma, after a thoughtful pause, during which Tom teased the\ngirls by snapping the lock of the pistol in their faces.\n\n\"Once upon a time,\" continued Madam, much flattered by the row of\ninterested faces before her, \"my father went away on business, leaving\nmother, aunt, and us girls to Jack's care. Very proud he was, to be\nsure, of the responsibility, and the first thing he did was to load that\npistol and keep it by his bed, in our great worriment, for we feared he\n'd kill himself with it. For a week all went well; then we were startled\nby the news that robbers were about. All sorts of stories flew through\nthe town (we were living in the country then); some said that certain\nhouses were marked with a black cross, and those were always robbed;\nothers, that there was a boy in the gang, for windows, so small that\nthey were considered safe, were entered by some little rogue. At one\nplace the thieves had a supper, and left ham and cake in the front yard.\nMrs. Jones found Mrs. Smith's shawl in her orchard, with a hammer and\nan unknown teapot near it. One man reported that some one tapped at\nhis window, in the night, saying, softly, 'Is anyone here?' and when he\nlooked out, two men were seen to run down the road.\n\n\"We lived just out of town, in a lonely place; the house was old, with\nconvenient little back windows, and five outside doors. Jack was the\nonly man about the place, and he was barely thirteen. Mother and aunt\nwere very timid, and the children weren't old enough to be of any\nuse, so Jack and I were the home-guard, and vowed to defend the family\nmanfully.\"\n\n\"Good for you! Hope the fellows came!\" cried Tom, charmed with this\nopening.\n\n\"One day, an ill-looking man came in and asked for food,\" continued\ngrandma, with a mysterious nod; \"and while he ate, I saw him glance\nsharply about from the wooden buttons on the back-doors, to the silver\nurn and tankards on the dining-room sideboard. A strong suspicion took\npossession of me, and I watched him as a cat does a mouse.\n\n\"'He came to examine the premises, I'm sure of it, but we will be ready\nfor him,' I said, fiercely, as I told the family about him.\n\n\"This fancy haunted us all, and our preparations were very funny. Mother\nborrowed a rattle, and kept it under her pillow. Aunt took a big bell\nto bed with her; the children had little Tip, the terrier, to sleep in\ntheir room; while Jack and I mounted guard, he with the pistol, and I\nwith a hatchet, for I did n't like fire-arms. Biddy, who slept in the\nattic, practised getting out on the shed roof, so that she might run\naway at the first alarm. Every night we arranged pit-falls for the\nrobbers, and all filed up to bed, bearing plate, money, weapons, and\nthings to barricade with, as if we lived in war times.\n\n\"We waited a week and no one came, so we began to feel rather slighted,\nfor other people got'a scare,' as Tom says, and after all our\npreparations we really felt a trifle disappointed that we had had no\nchance to show our courage. At last a black mark was found upon our\ndoor, and a great panic ensued, for we felt that now our time had come.\n\n\"That night we put a tub of water at the bottom of the back-stairs, and\na pile of tin pans at the top of the front stairs, so that any attempt\nto come up would produce a splash or a rattle. Bells were hung on door\nhandles, sticks of wood piled up in dark corners for robbers to fall\nover, and the family retired, all armed and all provided with lamps and\nmatches.\n\n\"Jack and I left our doors open, and kept asking one another if we did\nn't hear something, till he fell asleep. I was wakeful and lay listening\nto the crickets till the clock struck twelve; then I got drowsy, and\nwas just dropping off when the sound of steps outside woke me up staring\nwide awake. Creeping to the window I was in time to see by the dim\nmoonlight a shadow glide round the corner and disappear. A queer little\nthrill went over me, but I resolved to keep quiet till I was sure\nsomething was wrong, for I had given so many false alarms, I did n't\nwant Jack to laugh at me again. Popping my head out of the door, I\nlistened, and presently heard a scraping sound near the shed.\n\n\"'There they are; but I won't rouse the house till the bell rings or the\npans fall. The rogues can't go far without a clatter of some sort, and\nif we could only catch one of them we should get the reward and a deal\nof glory,' I said to myself, grasping my hatchet firmly.\n\n\"A door closed softly below, and a step came creeping towards the\nback-stairs. Sure now of my prey, I was just about to scream 'Jack!'\nwhen something went splash into the tub at the foot of the back-stairs.\n\n\"In a minute every one was awake and up, for Jack fired his pistol\nbefore he was half out of bed, and roared 'Fire!' so loud it roused the\nhouse. Mother sprung her rattle, aunt rang her bell, Jip barked like\nmad, and we all screamed, while from below came up a regular Irish howl.\n\n\"Some one brought a lamp, and we peeped anxiously down, to see our own\nstupid Biddy sitting in the tub wringing her hands and wailing dismally.\n\n\"'Och, murther, and it's kilt I am! The saints be about us! how iver\ndid I come forninst this say iv wather, just crapin in quiet afther\na bit iv sthroll wid Mike Mahoney, me own b'y, that's to marry me\nintirely, come Saint Patrick's day nixt.' We laughed so we could hardly\nfish the poor thing up, or listen while she explained that she had\nslipped out of her window for a word with Mike, and found it fastened\nwhen she wanted to come back, so she had sat on the roof, trying to\ndiscover the cause of this mysterious barring out, till she was\ntired, when she prowled round the house till she found a cellar window\nunfastened, after all our care, and got in quite cleverly, she thought;\nbut the tub was a new arrangement which she knew nothing about; and when\nshe fell into the'say,' she was bewildered and could only howl.\n\n\"This was not all the damage either, for aunt fainted with the fright,\nmother cut her hand with a broken lamp, the children took cold hopping\nabout on the wet stairs, Jip barked himself sick, I sprained my ankle,\nand Jack not only smashed a looking-glass with his bullets, but spoilt\nhis pistol by the heavy charge put in it. After the damages were\nrepaired and the flurry was well over, Jack confessed that he had marked\nthe door for fun, and shut Biddy out as a punishment for'gallivanting,'\nof which he did n't approve. Such a rogue as that boy was!'\"\n\n\"But did n't the robbers ever come?\" cried Tom, enjoying the joke, but\nfeeling defrauded of the fight.\n\n\"Never, my dear; but we had our'scare,' and tested our courage, and\nthat was a great satisfaction, of course,\" answered grandma, placidly.\n\n\"Well, I think you were the bravest of the lot. I'd like to have seen\nyou flourishing round there with your hatchet,\" added Tom, admiringly,\nand the old lady looked as much pleased with the compliment as if she\nhad been a girl.\n\n\"I choose this,\" said Polly, holding up a long white kid glove, shrunken\nand yellow with time, but looking as if it had a history.\n\n\"Ah, that now has a story worth telling!\" cried grandma; adding,\nproudly, \"Treat that old glove respectfully, my children, for\nLafayette's honored hand has touched it.\"\n\n\"Oh, grandma, did you wear it? Did you see him? Do tell us all about it,\nand that will be the best of the whole,\" cried Polly, who loved history,\nand knew a good deal about the gallant Frenchman and his brave life.\n\nGrandma loved to tell this story, and always assumed her most imposing\nair to do honor to her theme. Drawing herself up, therefore, she folded\nher hands, and after two or three little \"hems,\" began with an absent\nlook, as if her eyes beheld a far-away time, which brightened as she\ngazed.\n\n\"The first visit of Lafayette was before my time, of course, but I heard\nso much about it from my grandfather that I really felt as if I'd seen\nit all. Our Aunt Hancock lived in the Governor's house, on Beacon Hill,\nat that time.\" Here the old lady bridled up still more, for she was very\nproud of \"our aunt.\" \"Ah, my dears, those were the good old times!\" she\ncontinued, with a sigh. \"Such dinners and tea parties, such damask\ntable cloths and fine plate, such solid, handsome furniture and elegant\ncarriages; aunt's was lined with red silk velvet, and when the coach\nwas taken away from her at the Governor's death, she just ripped out\nthe lining, and we girls had spencers made of it. Dear heart, how well\nI remember playing in aunt's great garden, and chasing Jack up and down\nthose winding stairs; and my blessed father, in his plum-colored coat\nand knee buckles, and the queue I used to tie up for him every day,\nhanding aunt in to dinner, looking so dignified and splendid.\"\n\nGrandma seemed to forget her story for a minute, and become a little\ngirl again, among the playmates dead and gone so many years. Polly\nmotioned the others to be quiet, and no one spoke till the old lady,\nwith a long sigh, came back to the present, and went on.\n\n\"Well, as I was saying, the Governor wanted to give a breakfast to the\nFrench officers, and Madam, who was a hospitable soul, got up a splendid\none for them. But by some mistake, or accident, it was discovered at the\nlast minute that there was no milk.\n\n\"A great deal was needed, and very little could be bought or borrowed,\nso despair fell upon the cooks and maids, and the great breakfast would\nhave been a failure, if Madam, with the presence of mind of her sex, had\nnot suddenly bethought herself of the cows feeding on the Common.\n\n\"To be sure, they belonged to her neighbors, and there was no time to\nask leave, but it was a national affair; our allies must be fed; and\nfeeling sure that her patriotic friends would gladly lay their cows on\nthe altar of their country, Madam Hancock covered herself with glory,\nby calmly issuing the command, 'Milk'em!' It was done, to the great\nastonishment of the cows, and the entire satisfaction of the guests,\namong whom was Lafayette.\n\n\"This milking feat was such a good joke, that no one seems to have\nremembered much about the great man, though one of his officers, a\ncount, signalized himself by getting very tipsy, and going to bed with\nhis boots and spurs on, which caused the destruction of aunt's best\nyellow damask coverlet, for the restless sleeper kicked it into rags by\nmorning.\n\n\"Aunt valued it very much, even in its tattered condition, and kept it a\nlong while, as a memorial of her distinguished guests.\n\n\"The time when I saw Lafayette was in 1825, and there were no tipsy\ncounts then. Uncle Hancock (a sweet man, my dears, though some call him\nmean now-a-days) was dead, and aunt had married Captain Scott.\n\n\"It was not at all the thing for her to do; however, that's neither\nhere nor there. She was living in Federal Street at the time, a most\naristocratic street then, children, and we lived close by.\n\n\"Old Josiah Quincy was mayor of the city, and he sent aunt word that the\nMarquis Lafayette wished to pay his respects to her.\n\n\"Of course she was delighted, and we all flew about to make ready for\nhim. Aunt was an old lady, but she made a grand toilet, and was as\nanxious to look well as any girl.\"\n\n\"What did she wear?\" asked Fan, with interest.\n\n\"She wore a steel-colored satin, trimmed with black lace, and on her cap\nwas pinned a Lafayette badge of white satin.\n\n\"I never shall forget how b-e-a-utifully she looked as she sat in state\non the front parlor sophy, right under a great portrait of her first\nhusband; and on either side of her sat Madam Storer and Madam Williams,\nelegant to behold, in their stiff silks, rich lace, and stately turbans.\nWe don't see such splendid old ladies now-a-days.\"\n\n\"I think we do sometimes,\" said Polly, slyly.\n\nGrandma shook her head, but it pleased her very much to be admired, for\nshe had been a beauty in her day.\n\n\"We girls had dressed the house with flowers; old Mr. Coolidge sent in a\nclothes-basket full. Joe Joy provided the badges, and aunt got out some\nof the Revolutionary wine from the old Beacon Street cellar.\n\n\"I wore my green and white palmyrine, my hair bowed high, the beautiful\nleg-o'-mutton sleeves that were so becoming, and these very gloves.\n\n\"Well, by-and-by the General, escorted by the Mayor, drove up. Dear me,\nI see him now! a little old man in nankeen trousers and vest, a long\nblue coat and ruffled shirt, leaning on his cane, for he was lame, and\nsmiling and bowing like a true Frenchman.\n\n\"As he approached, the three old ladies rose, and courtesied with the\nutmost dignity. Lafayette bowed first to the Governor's picture, then to\nthe Governor's widow, and kissed her hand.\n\n\"That was droll; for on the back of her glove was stamped Lafayette's\nlikeness, and the gallant old gentleman kissed his own face.\n\n\"Then some of the young ladies were presented, and, as if to escape any\nfurther self-salutations, the marquis kissed the pretty girls on the\ncheek.\n\n\"Yes, my dears, here is just the spot where the dear old man saluted me.\nI'm quite as proud of it now as I was then, for he was a brave, good\nman, and helped us in our trouble.\n\n\"He did not stay long, but we were very merry, drinking his health,\nreceiving his compliments, and enjoying the honor he did us.\n\n\"Down in the street there was a crowd, of course, and when he left they\nwanted to take out the horses and drag him home in triumph. But he did\nn't wish it; and while that affair was being arranged, we girls had been\npelting him with the flowers which we tore from the vases, the walls,\nand our own topknots, to scatter over him.\n\n\"He liked that, and laughed, and waved his hand to us, while we ran, and\npelted, and begged him to come again.\n\n\"We young folks quite lost our heads that night, and I have n't a very\nclear idea of how I got home. The last thing I remember was hanging out\nof the window with a flock of girls, watching the carriage roll away,\nwhile the crowd cheered as if they were mad.\n\n\"Bless my heart, it seems as if I heard'em now! 'Hurrah for Lafayette\nand Mayor Quincy! Hurrah for Madam Hancock and the pretty girls! Hurrah\nfor Col. May!' 'Three cheers for Boston! Now, then! Hurrah! Hurrah!\nHurrah!'\"\n\nAnd here the old lady stopped, out of breath, with her cap askew, her\nspectacles on the end of her nose, and her knitting much the worse for\nbeing waved enthusiastically in the air, while she hung over the arm of\nher chair, shrilly cheering an imaginary Lafayette. The girls clapped\ntheir hands, and Tom hurrahed with all his might, saying, when he got\nhis breath, \"Lafayette was a regular old trump; I always liked him.\"\n\n\"My dear! what a disrespectful way to speak of that great man,\" said\ngrandma, shocked at Young America's irreverence.\n\n\"Well, he was a trump, anyway, so why not call him one?\" asked Tom,\nfeeling that the objectionable word was all that could be desired.\n\n\"What queer gloves you wore then,\" interrupted Fanny, who had been\ntrying on the much-honored glove, and finding it a tight fit.\n\n\"Much better and cheaper than we have now,\" returned grandma, ready\nto defend \"the good old times\" against every insinuation. \"You are an\nextravagant set now-a-days, and I really don't know what you are coming\nto. By the way, I've got somewhere two letters written by two young\nladies, one in 1517, and the other in 1868. The contrast between the two\nwill amuse you, I think.\"\n\nAfter a little search, grandma produced an old portfolio, and selecting\nthe papers, read the following letter, written by Anne Boleyn before\nher marriage to Henry VIII, and now in the possession of a celebrated\nantiquarian:\n\nDEAR MARY, I have been in town almost a month, yet I cannot say I have\nfound anything in London extremely agreeable. We rise so late in the\nmorning, seldom before six o'clock, and sit up so late at night, being\nscarcely in bed before ten, that I am quite sick of it; and was it not\nfor the abundance of fine things I am every day getting I should be\nimpatient of returning into the country.\n\nMy indulgent mother bought me, yesterday, at a merchant's in Cheapside,\nthree new shifts, that cost fourteen pence an ell, and I am to have a\npair of new stuff shoes, for my Lord of Norfolk's ball, which will be\nthree shillings.\n\nThe irregular life I have led since my coming to this place has quite\ndestroyed my appetite. You know I could manage a pound of bacon and a\ntankard of good ale for my breakfast, in the country, but in London I\nfind it difficult to get through half the quantity, though I must own\nI am generally eager enough for the dinner hour, which is here delayed\ntill twelve, in your polite society.\n\nI played at hot cockles, last night, at my Lord of Leicester's. The Lord\nof Surrey was there, a very elegant young man, who sung a song of\nhis own composition, on the \"Lord of Kildare's Daughter.\" It was much\napproved, and my brother whispered me that the fair Geraldine, for so my\nLord of Surrey calls his sweetheart, is the finest woman of the age. I\nshould be glad to see her, for I hear she is good as she is beautiful.\n\nPray take care of the poultry during my absence. Poor things! I always\nfed them myself; and if Margery has knitted me the crimson worsted\nmittens, I should be glad if they were sent up the first opportunity.\n\nAdieu, dear Mary. I am just going to mass, and you shall speedily have\nthe prayers, as you have now the kindest love of your own ANNE BOLEYN.\n\n\"Up before six, and think it late to go to bed at ten! What a\ncountrified thing Anne must have been. Bacon and ale for breakfast, and\ndinner at twelve; how very queer to live so!\" cried Fanny. \"Lord Surrey\nand Lord Leicester sound fine, but hot cockles, and red mittens, and\nshoes for three shillings, are horrid.\"\n\n\"I like it,\" said Polly, thoughtfully, \"and I'm glad poor Anne had a\nlittle fun before her troubles began. May I copy that letter some time,\ngrandma?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear, and welcome. Now, here's the other, by a modern girl on her\nfirst visit to London. This will suit you better, Fan,\" and grandma\nread what a friend had sent her as a pendant to Anne's little picture of\nLondon life long ago:\n\nMY DEAREST CONSTANCE, After three months of intense excitement I snatch\na leisure moment to tell you how much I enjoy my first visit to London.\nHaving been educated abroad, it really seems like coming to a strange\ncity. At first the smoke, dirt and noise were very disagreeable, but\nI soon got used to these things, and now find all I see perfectly\ncharming.\n\nWe plunged at once into a whirl of gayety and I have had no time to\nthink of anything but pleasure. It is the height of the season, and\nevery hour is engaged either in going to balls, concerts, theatres,\nfetes and church, or in preparing for them. We often go to two or three\nparties in an evening, and seldom get home till morning, so of course\nwe don't rise till noon next day. This leaves very little time for our\ndrives, shopping, and calls before dinner at eight, and then the evening\ngayeties begin again.\n\nAt a ball at Lady Russell's last night, I saw the Prince of Wales, and\ndanced in the set with him. He is growing stout, and looks dissipated. I\nwas disappointed in him, for neither in appearance nor conversation was\nhe at all princely. I was introduced to a very brilliant and delightful\nyoung gentleman from America. I was charmed with him, and rather\nsurprised to learn that he wrote the poems which were so much admired\nlast season, also that he is the son of a rich tailor. How odd these\nAmericans are, with their money, and talent, and independence!\n\nO my dear, I must not forget to tell you the great event of my first\nseason. I am to be presented at the next Drawing Room! Think how\nabsorbed I must be in preparation for this grand affair. Mamma is\nresolved that I shall do her credit, and we have spent the last two\nweeks driving about from milliners to mantua-makers, from merchants to\njewellers. I am to wear white satin and plumes, pearls and roses. My\ndress will cost a hundred pounds or more, and is very elegant.\n\nMy cousins and friends lavish lovely things upon me, and you will open\nyour unsophisticated eyes when I display my silks and laces, trinkets\nand French hats, not to mention billet deux, photographs, and other\nrelics of a young belle's first season.\n\nYou ask if I ever think of home. I really have n't time, but I do\nsometimes long a little for the quiet, the pure air and the girlish\namusements I used to enjoy so much. One gets pale, and old, and sadly\nfagged out, with all this dissipation, pleasant as it is. I feel quite\nblas\u00c3\u00a9 already.\n\nIf you could send me the rosy cheeks, bright eyes, and gay spirits I\nalways had at home, I'd thank you. As you cannot do that, please send\nme a bottle of June rain water, for my maid tells me it is better than\nany cosmetic for the complexion, and mine is getting ruined by late\nhours.\n\nI fancy some fruit off our own trees would suit me, for I have no\nappetite, and mamma is quite desolate about me. One cannot live on\nFrench cookery without dyspepsia, and one can get nothing simple here,\nfor food, like everything else, is regulated by the fashion.\n\nAdieu, ma chere, I must dress for church. I only wish you could see my\nnew hat and go with me, for Lord Rockingham promised to be there.\n\nAdieu, yours eternally, FLORENCE.\n\n\"Yes, I do like that better, and I wish I had been in this girl's place,\ndon't you, Polly?\" said Fan, as grandma took off her glasses.\n\n\"I should love to go to London, and have a good time, but I don't think\nI should care about spending ever so much money, or going to Court.\nMaybe I might when I got there, for I do like fun and splendor,\" added\nhonest Polly, feeling that pleasure was a very tempting thing.\n\n\"Grandma looks tired; let's go and play in the dwying-woom,\" said Maud,\nwho found the conversation getting beyond her depth.\n\n\"Let us all kiss and thank grandma, for amusing us so nicely, before\nwe go,\" whispered Polly. Maud and Fanny agreed, and grandma looked so\ngratified by their thanks, that Tom followed suit, merely waiting till\n\"those girls\" were out of sight, to give the old lady a hearty hug, and\na kiss on the very cheek Lafayette had saluted.\n\nWhen he reached the play-room Polly was sitting in the swing, saying,\nvery earnestly, \"I always told you it was nice up in grandma's room, and\nnow you see it is. I wish you'd go oftener; she admires to have you,\nand likes to tell stories and do pleasant things, only she thinks you\ndon't care for her quiet sort of fun. I do, anyway, and I think she's\nthe kindest, best old lady that ever lived, and I love her dearly!\"\n\n\"I did n't say she was n't, only old people are sort of tedious and\nfussy, so I keep out of their way,\" said Fanny.\n\n\"Well, you ought not to, and you miss lots of pleasant times. My mother\nsays we ought to be kind and patient and respectful to all old folks\njust because they are old, and I always mean to be.\"\n\n\"Your mother's everlastingly preaching,\" muttered Fan, nettled by the\nconsciousness of her own shortcomings with regard to grandma.\n\n\"She don't preach!\" cried Polly, firing up like a flash; \"she only\nexplains things to us, and helps us be good, and never scolds, and I\n'd rather have her than any other mother in the world, though she don't\nwear velvet cloaks and splendid bonnets, so now!\"\n\n\"Go it, Polly!\" called Tom, who was gracefully hanging head downward\nfrom the bar put up for his special benefit.\n\n\"Polly's mad! Polly's mad!\" sung Maud, skipping rope round the room.\n\n\"If Mr. Sydney could see you now he would n't think you such an angel\nany more,\" added Fanny, tossing a bean-bag and her head at the same\ntime.\n\nPolly was mad, her face was very red, her eyes very bright and her lips\ntwitched, but she held her tongue and began to swing as hard as she\ncould, fearing to say something she would be sorry for afterward. For a\nfew minutes no one spoke, Tom whistled and Maud hummed but Fan and Polly\nwere each soberly thinking of something, for they had reached an\nage when children, girls especially, begin to observe, contrast, and\nspeculate upon the words, acts, manners, and looks of those about them.\nA good deal of thinking goes on in the heads of these shrewd little\nfolks, and the elders should mind their ways, for they get criticised\npretty sharply and imitated very closely.\n\nTwo little things had happened that day, and the influence of a few\nwords, a careless action, was still working in the active minds of the\ngirls.\n\nMr. Sydney had called, and while Fanny was talking with him she saw his\neye rest on Polly, who sat apart watching the faces round her with the\nmodest, intelligent look which many found so attractive. At that minute\nMadam Shaw came in, and stopped to speak to the little girl. Polly rose\nat once, and remained standing till the old lady passed on.\n\n\"Are you laughing at Polly's prim ways?\" Fanny had asked, as she saw Mr.\nSydney smile.\n\n\"No, I am admiring Miss Polly's fine manners,\" he answered in a grave,\nrespectful tone, which had impressed Fanny very much, for Mr. Sydney\nwas considered by all the girls as a model of good breeding, and that\nindescribable something which they called \"elegance.\"\n\nFanny wished she had done that little thing, and won that approving\nlook, for she valued the young man's good opinion, because it was\nso hard to win, by her set at least. So, when Polly talked about old\npeople, it recalled this scene and made Fan cross.\n\nPolly was remembering how, when Mrs. Shaw came home that day in her fine\nvisiting costume, and Maud ran to welcome her with unusual affection,\nshe gathered up her lustrous silk and pushed the little girl away\nsaying, impatiently, \"Don't touch me, child, your hands are dirty.\"\nThen the thought had come to Polly that the velvet cloak did n't cover\na right motherly heart, that the fretful face under the nodding purple\nplumes was not a tender motherly face, and that the hands in the\ndelicate primrose gloves had put away something very sweet and precious.\nShe thought of another woman, whose dress never was too fine for little\nwet cheeks to lie against, or loving little arms to press; whose face,\nin spite of many lines and the gray hairs above it, was never sour or\nunsympathetic when children's eyes turned towards it; and whose hands\nnever were too busy, too full or too nice to welcome and serve the\nlittle sons and daughters who freely brought their small hopes and\nfears, sins and sorrows, to her, who dealt out justice and mercy with\nsuch wise love. \"Ah, that's a mother!\" thought Polly, as the memory\ncame warm into her heart, making her feel very rich, and pity Maud for\nbeing so poor.\n\nThis it was that caused such sudden indignation at Fanny's dreadful\nspeech, and this it was that made quick-tempered Polly try to calm her\nwrath before she used toward Fanny's mother the disrespectful tone she\nso resented toward her own. As the swing came down after some dozen\nquick journeys to and fro, Polly seemed to have found a smile somewhere\nup aloft, for she looked toward Fan, saying pleasantly, as she paused\na little in her airy exercise, \"I'm not mad now, shall I come and toss\nwith you?\"\n\n\"No, I'll come and swing with you,\" answered Fanny, quick to feel the\ngenerous spirit of her friend.\n\n\"You are an angel, and I'll never be so rude again,\" she added, as\nPolly's arm came round her, and half the seat was gladly offered.\n\n\"No, I ain't; but if I ever get at all like one, it will be'mother's\npreaching' that did it,\" said Polly, with a happy laugh.\n\n\"Good for you, Polly Peacemaker,\" cried Tom, quoting his father, and\ngiving them a grand push as the most appropriate way of expressing his\napprobation of the sentiment.\n\nNothing more was said; but from that day there slowly crept into the\nfamily more respect for grandma, more forbearance with her infirmities,\nmore interest in her little stories, and many a pleasant gossip did the\ndear old lady enjoy with the children as they gathered round her fire,\nsolitary so long.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. GOOD-BY\n\n\n\"OH, dear! Must you really go home Saturday?\" said Fan, some days after\nwhat Tom called the \"grand scrimmage.\"\n\n\"I really must; for I only came to stay a month and here I've been\nnearly six weeks,\" answered Polly, feeling as if she had been absent a\nyear.\n\n\"Make it two months and stay over Christmas. Come, do, now,\" urged Tom,\nheartily.\n\n\"You are very kind; but I would n't miss Christmas at home for anything.\nBesides, mother says they can't possibly do without me.\"\n\n\"Neither can we. Can't you tease your mother, and make up your mind to\nstay?\" began Fan.\n\n\"Polly never teases. She says it's selfish; and I don't do it now\nmuch,\" put in Maud, with a virtuous air.\n\n\"Don't you bother Polly. She'd rather go, and I don't wonder. Let's be\njust as jolly as we can while she stays, and finish up with your party,\nFan,\" said Tom, in a tone that settled the matter.\n\nPolly had expected to be very happy in getting ready for the party; but\nwhen the time came, she was disappointed; for somehow that naughty thing\ncalled envy took possession of her, and spoiled her pleasure. Before she\nleft home, she thought her new white muslin dress, with its fresh blue\nribbons, the most elegant and proper costume she could have; but\nnow, when she saw Fanny's pink silk, with a white tarlatan tunic, and\ninnumerable puffings, bows, and streamers, her own simple little\ntoilet lost all its charms in her eyes, and looked very babyish and\nold-fashioned.\n\nEven Maud was much better dressed than herself, and looked very splendid\nin her cherry-colored and white suit, with a sash so big she could\nhardly carry it, and little white boots with red buttons. They both\nhad necklaces and bracelets, ear-rings and brooches; but Polly had no\nornament, except the plain locket on a bit of blue velvet. Her sash was\nonly a wide ribbon, tied in a simple bow, and nothing but a blue snood\nin the pretty curls. Her only comfort was the knowledge that the modest\ntucker drawn up round the plump shoulders was real lace, and that her\nbronze boots cost nine dollars.\n\nPoor Polly, with all her efforts to be contented, and not to mind\nlooking unlike other people, found it hard work to keep her face bright\nand her voice happy that night. No one dreamed what was going an under\nthe muslin frock, till grandma's wise old eyes spied out the little\nshadow on Polly's spirits, and guessed the cause of it. When dressed,\nthe three girls went up to show themselves to the elders, who were in\ngrandma's room, where Tom was being helped into an agonizingly stiff\ncollar.\n\nMaud pranced like a small peacock, and Fan made a splendid courtesy as\nevery one turned to survey them; but Polly stood still, and her eyes\nwent from face to face, with an anxious, wistful air, which seemed to\nsay, \"I know I'm not right; but I hope I don't look very bad.\"\n\nGrandma read the look in a minute; and when Fanny said, with a satisfied\nsmile, \"How do we look?\" she answered, drawing Polly toward her so\nkindly.\n\n\"Very like the fashion-plates you got the patterns of your dresses from.\nBut this little costume suits me best.\"\n\n\"Do you really think I look nice?\" and Polly's face brightened, for she\nvalued the old lady's opinion very much.\n\n\"Yes, my dear; you look just as I like to see a child of your age look.\nWhat particularly pleases me is that you have kept your promise to your\nmother, and have n't let anyone persuade you to wear borrowed finery.\nYoung things like you don't need any ornaments but those you wear\nto-night, youth, health, intelligence, and modesty.\"\n\nAs she spoke, grandma gave a tender kiss that made Polly glow like a\nrose, and for a minute she forgot that there were such things as pink\nsilk and coral ear-rings in the world. She only said, \"Thank you,\nma'am,\" and heartily returned the kiss; but the words did her good, and\nher plain dress looked charming all of a sudden.\n\n\"Polly's so pretty, it don't matter what she wears,\" observed Tom,\nsurveying her over his collar with an air of calm approval.\n\n\"She has n't got any bwetelles to her dwess, and I have,\" said Maud,\nsettling her ruffled bands over her shoulders, which looked like\ncherry-colored wings on a stout little cherub.\n\n\"I did wish she'd just wear my blue set, ribbon is so very plain; but,\nas Tom says, it don't much matter;\" and Fanny gave an effective touch to\nthe blue bow above Polly's left temple.\n\n\"She might wear flowers; they always suit young girls,\" said Mrs. Shaw,\nprivately thinking that her own daughters looked much the best, yet\nconscious that blooming Polly had the most attractive face. \"Bless me!\nI forgot my posies in admiring the belles. Hand them out, Tom;\" and Mr.\nShaw nodded toward an interesting looking box that stood on the table.\n\nSeizing them wrong side-up, Tom produced three little bouquets, all\ndifferent in color, size, and construction.\n\n\"Why, papa! how very kind of you,\" cried Fanny, who had not dared to\nreceive even a geranium leaf since the late scrape.\n\n\"Your father used to be a very gallant young gentleman, once upon a\ntime,\" said Mrs. Shaw, with a simper.\n\n\"Ah, Tom, it's a good sign when you find time to think of giving\npleasure to your little girls!\" And grandma patted her son's bald head\nas if he was n't more than eighteen.\n\nThomas Jr. had given a somewhat scornful sniff at first; but when\ngrandma praised his father, the young man thought better of the matter,\nand regarded the flowers with more respect, as he asked, \"Which is for\nwhich?\"\n\n\"Guess,\" said Mr. Shaw, pleased that his unusual demonstration had\nproduced such an effect.\n\nThe largest was a regular hothouse bouquet, of tea-rosebuds, scentless\nheath, and smilax; the second was just a handful of sweet-peas and\nmignonette, with a few cheerful pansies, and one fragrant little rose in\nthe middle; the third, a small posy of scarlet verbenas, white feverfew,\nand green leaves.\n\n\"Not hard to guess. The smart one for Fan, the sweet one for Polly, and\nthe gay one for Pug. Now, then, catch hold, girls.\" And Tom proceeded\nto deliver the nosegays, with as much grace as could be expected from a\nyouth in a new suit of clothes and very tight boots.\n\n\"That finishes you off just right, and is a very pretty attention of\npapa's. Now run down, for the bell has rung; and remember, not to dance\ntoo often, Fan; be as quiet as you can, Tom; and Maud, don't eat too\nmuch supper. Grandma will attend to things, for my poor nerves won't\nallow me to come down.\"\n\nWith that, Mrs. Shaw dismissed them, and the four descended to receive\nthe first batch of visitors, several little girls who had been asked\nfor the express purpose of keeping Maud out of her sister's way. Tom\nhad likewise been propitiated, by being allowed to bring his three bosom\nfriends, who went by the school-boy names of Rumple, Sherry, and Spider.\n\n\"They will do to make up sets, as gentlemen are scarce; and the party is\nfor Polly, so I must have some young folks on her account,\" said Fanny,\nwhen sending out her invitations.\n\nOf course, the boys came early, and stood about in corners, looking as\nif they had more arms and legs than they knew what to do with. Tom did\nhis best to be a good host; but ceremony oppressed his spirits, and he\nwas forced to struggle manfully with the wild desire to propose a game\nof leap-frog, for the long drawing-rooms, cleared for dancing, tempted\nhim sorely.\n\nPolly sat where she was told, and suffered bashful agonies as Fan\nintroduced very fine young ladies and very stiff young gentlemen, who\nall said about the same civil things, and then appeared to forget all\nabout her. When the first dance was called, Fanny cornered Tom, who had\nbeen dodging her, for he knew what she wanted, and said, in an earnest\nwhisper: \"Now, Tom, you must dance this with Polly. You are the young\ngentleman of the house, and it's only proper that you should ask your\ncompany first.\"\n\n\"Polly don't care for manners. I hate dancing; don't know how. Let go\nmy jacket, and don't bother, or I'll cut away altogether,\" growled Tom,\ndaunted by the awful prospect of opening the ball with Polly.\n\n\"I'll never forgive you if you do. Come, be clever, and help me, there\n's a dear. You know we both were dreadfully rude to Polly, and agreed\nthat we'd be as kind and civil to her as ever we could. I shall keep\nmy word, and see that she is n't slighted at my party, for I want her to\nlove me, and go home feeling all right.\"\n\nThis artful speech made an impression on the rebellious Thomas, who\nglanced at Polly's happy face, remembered his promise, and, with a\ngroan, resolved to do his duty.\n\n\"Well, I'll take her; but I shall come to grief, for I don't know\nanything about your old dances.\"\n\n\"Yes, you do. I've taught you the steps a dozen times. I'm going to\nbegin with a redowa, because the girls like it, and it's better fun\nthan square dances. Now, put on your gloves, and go and ask Polly like a\ngentleman.\"\n\n\"Oh, thunder!\" muttered Tom. And having split the detested gloves in\ndragging them on, he nerved himself for the effort, walked up to Polly,\nmade a stiff bow, stuck out his elbow, and said, solemnly, \"May I have\nthe pleasure, Miss Milton?\"\n\nHe did it as much like the big fellows as he could, and expected that\nPolly would be impressed. But she was n't a bit; for after a surprised\nlook she laughed in his face, and took him by the hand, saying,\nheartily, \"Of course you may; but don't be a goose, Tommy.\"\n\n\"Well, Fan told me to be elegant, so I tried to,\" whispered Tom, adding,\nas he clutched his partner with a somewhat desperate air, \"Hold on\ntight, and we'll get through somehow.\"\n\nThe music struck up, and away they went; Tom hopping one way and Polly\nthe other, in a most ungraceful manner.\n\n\"Keep time to the music,\" gasped Polly.\n\n\"Can't; never could,\" returned Tom.\n\n\"Keep step with me, then, and don't tread on my toes,\" pleaded Polly.\n\n\"Never mind; keep bobbing, and we'll come right by and by,\" muttered\nTom, giving his unfortunate partner a sudden whisk, which nearly landed\nboth on the floor.\n\nBut they did not \"get right by and by\"; for Tom, In his frantic efforts\nto do his duty, nearly annihilated poor Polly. He tramped, he bobbed, he\nskated, he twirled her to the right, dragged her to the left, backed her\nup against people and furniture, trod on her feet, rumpled her dress,\nand made a spectacle of himself generally. Polly was much disturbed;\nbut as everyone else was flying about also, she bore it as long as\nshe could, knowing that Tom had made a martyr of himself, and feeling\ngrateful to him for the sacrifice.\n\n\"Oh, do stop now; this is dreadful!\" cried Polly, breathlessly, after a\nfew wild turns.\n\n\"Is n't it?\" said Tom, wiping his red face with such an air of intense\nrelief, that Polly had not the heart to scold him, but said, \"Thank\nyou,\" and dropped into a chair exhausted.\n\n\"I know I've made a guy of myself; but Fan insisted on it, for fear\nyou'd be offended if I did n't go the first dance with you,\" said Tom,\nremorsefully, watching Polly as she settled the bow of her crushed sash,\nwhich Tom had used as a sort of handle by which to turn and twist her;\n\"I can do the Lancers tip-top; but you won't ever want to dance with me\nany more,\" he added, as he began to fan her so violently, that her hair\nflew about as if in a gale of wind.\n\n\"Yes, I will. I'd like to; and you shall put your name down here on\nthe sticks of my fan. That's the way, Trix says, when you don't have a\nball-book.\"\n\nLooking much gratified, Tom produced the stump of a lead-pencil, and\nwrote his name with a flourish, saying, as he gave it back, \"Now I'm\ngoing to get Sherry, or some of the fellows that do the redowa well, so\nyou can have a real good go before the music stops.\"\n\nOff went Tom; but before he could catch any eligible partner, Polly was\nprovided with the best dancer in the room. Mr. Sydney had seen and heard\nthe whole thing; and though he had laughed quietly, he liked honest Tom\nand good-natured Polly all the better for their simplicity. Polly's foot\nwas keeping time to the lively music, and her eyes were fixed wistfully\non the smoothly-gliding couples before her, when Mr. Sydney came to\nher, saying, in the pleasant yet respectful way she liked so much, \"Miss\nPolly, can you give me a turn?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I'm dying for another.\" And Polly jumped up, with both hands\nout, and such a grateful face, that Mr. Sydney resolved she should have\nas many turns as she liked.\n\nThis time all went well; and Tom, returning from an unsuccessful search,\nwas amazed to behold Polly circling gracefully about the room, guided by\na most accomplished partner.\n\n\"Ah, that's something like,\" he thought, as he watched the bronze boots\nretreating and advancing in perfect time to the music. \"Don't see how\nSydney does the steering so well; but it must be fun; and, by Jupiter! I\n'll learn it!\" added Shaw, Jr., with an emphatic gesture which burst the\nlast button off his gloves.\n\nPolly enjoyed herself till the music stopped; and before she had time to\nthank Mr. Sydney as warmly as she wished, Tom came up to say, with his\nmost lordly air, \"You dance splendidly, Polly. Now, you just show me any\none you like the looks of, and I'll get him for you, no matter who he\nis.\"\n\n\"I don't want any of the gentlemen; they are so stiff, and don't care\nto dance with me; but I like those boys over there, and I'll dance with\nany of them if they are willing,\" said Polly, after a survey.\n\n\"I'll trot out the whole lot.\" And Tom gladly brought up his friends,\nwho all admired Polly immensely, and were proud to be chosen instead of\nthe \"big fellows.\"\n\nThere was no sitting still for Polly after that, for the lads kept her\ngoing at a great pace; and she was so happy, she never saw or suspected\nhow many little manoeuvres, heart-burnings, displays of vanity,\naffectation, and nonsense were going on all round her. She loved\ndancing, and entered into the gayety of the scene with a heartiness that\nwas pleasant to see. Her eyes shone, her face glowed, her lips smiled,\nand the brown curls waved in the air, as she danced, with a heart as\nlight as her feet.\n\n\"Are you enjoying yourself, Polly?\" asked Mr. Shaw, who looked in, now\nand then, to report to grandma that all was going well.\n\n\"Oh, such a splendid time!\" cried Polly, with an enthusiastic little\ngesture, as she chassed into the corner where he stood.\n\n\"She is a regular belle among the boys,\" said Fanny, as she promenaded\nby.\n\n\"They are so kind in asking me and I'm not afraid of them,\" explained\nPolly, prancing, simply because she could n't keep still.\n\n\"So you are afraid of the young gentlemen, hey?\" and Mr. Shaw held her\nby one curl.\n\n\"All but Mr. Sydney. He don't put on airs and talk nonsense; and, oh! he\ndoes'dance like an angel,' as Trix says.\"\n\n\"Papa, I wish you'd come and waltz with me. Fan told me not to go near\nher,'cause my wed dwess makes her pink one look ugly; and Tom won't;\nand I want to dwedfully.\"\n\n\"I've forgotten how, Maudie. Ask Polly; she'll spin you round like a\nteetotum.\" \"Mr. Sydney's name is down for that,\" answered Polly, looking\nat her fan with a pretty little air of importance. \"But I guess he would\nn't mind my taking poor Maud instead. She has n't danced hardly any,\nand I've had more than my share. Would it be very improper to change\nmy mind?\" And Polly looked up at her tall partner with eye which plainly\nshowed that the change was a sacrifice.\n\n\"Not a bit. Give the little dear a good waltz, and we will look on,\"\nanswered Mr. Sydney, with a nod and smile.\n\n\"That is a refreshing little piece of nature,\" said Mr. Shaw, as Polly\nand Maud whirled away.\n\n\"She will make a charming little woman, if she is n't spoilt.\"\n\n\"No danger of that. She has got a sensible mother.\"\n\n\"I thought so.\" And Sydney sighed, for he had lately lost his own good\nmother.\n\nWhen supper was announced, Polly happened to be talking, or trying to\ntalk, to one of the \"poky\" gentlemen whom Fan had introduced. He took\nMiss Milton down, of course, put her in a corner, and having served her\nto a dab of ice and one macaroon, he devoted himself to his own supper\nwith such interest, that Polly would have fared badly, if Tom had not\ncome and rescued her.\n\n\"I've been looking everywhere for you. Come with me, and don't sit\nstarving here,\" said Tom, with a scornful look from her empty plate to\nthat of her recreant escort, which was piled with good things.\n\nFollowing her guide, Polly was taken to the big china closet, opening\nfrom the dining-room to the kitchen, and here she found a jovial little\nparty feasting at ease. Maud and her bosom friend, \"Gwace,\" were seated\non tin cake-boxes; Sherry and Spider adorned the refrigerator; while Tom\nand Rumple foraged for the party.\n\n\"Here's fun,\" said Polly, as she was received with a clash of spoons\nand a waving of napkins.\n\n\"You just perch on that cracker-keg, and I'll see that you get enough,\"\nsaid Tom, putting a dumbwaiter before her, and issuing his orders with a\nfine air of authority.\n\n\"We are a band of robbers in our cave, and I'm the captain; and we\npitch into the folks passing by, and go out and bring home plunder. Now,\nRumple, you go and carry off a basket of cake, and I'll watch here till\nKaty comes by with a fresh lot of oysters; Polly must have some. Sherry,\ncut into the kitchen, and bring a cup of coffee. Spider, scrape up the\nsalad, and poke the dish through the slide for more. Eat away, Polly,\nand my men will be back with supplies in a jiffy.\"\n\nSuch fun as they had in that closet; such daring robberies of jelly-pots\nand cake-boxes; such successful raids into the dining-room and kitchen;\nsuch base assaults upon poor Katy and the colored waiter, who did his\nbest, but was helpless in the hands of the robber horde. A very harmless\nlittle revel; for no wine was allowed, and the gallant band were so\nbusy skirmishing to supply the ladies, that they had not time to eat\ntoo much. No one missed them; and when they emerged, the feast was over,\nexcept for a few voracious young gentlemen, who still lingered among the\nruins.\n\n\"That's the way they always do; poke the girls in corners, give'em\njust one taste of something, and then go and stuff like pigs,\" whispered\nTom, with a superior air, forgetting certain private banquets of his\nown, after company had departed.\n\nThe rest of the evening was to be devoted to the German; and, as Polly\nknew nothing about it, she established herself in a window recess to\nwatch the mysteries. For a time she enjoyed it, for it was all new to\nher, and the various pretty devices were very charming; but, by and by,\nthat bitter weed, envy, cropped up again, and she could not feel happy\nto be left out in the cold, while the other girls were getting gay\ntissue-paper suits, droll bonbons, flowers, ribbons, and all manner of\ntasteful trifles in which girlish souls delight. Everyone was absorbed;\nMr. Sydney was dancing; Tom and his friends were discussing base-ball on\nthe stairs; and Maud's set had returned to the library to play.\n\nPolly tried to conquer the bad feeling; but it worried her, till she\nremembered something her mother once said to her, \"When you feel out\nof sorts, try to make some one else happy, and you will soon be so\nyourself.\"\n\n\"I will try it,\" thought Polly, and looked round to see what she could\ndo. Sounds of strife in the library led her to enter. Maud and the young\nladies were sitting on the sofa, talking about each other's clothes, as\nthey had seen their mammas do.\n\n\"Was your dress imported?\" asked Grace.\n\n\"No; was yours?\" returned Blanche.\n\n\"Yes; and it cost oh, ever so much.\"\n\n\"I don't think it is as pretty as Maud's.\"\n\n\"Mine was made in New York,\" said Miss Shaw, smoothing her skirts\ncomplacently.\n\n\"I can't dress much now, you know,'cause mamma's in black for\nsomebody,\" observed Miss Alice Lovett, feeling the importance which\naffliction conferred upon her when it took the form of a jet necklace.\n\n\"Well, I don't care if my dress is n't imported; my cousin had three\nkinds of wine at her party; so, now,\" said Blanche.\n\n\"Did she?\" And all the little girls looked deeply impressed, till Maud\nobserved, with a funny imitation of her father's manner, \"My papa said\nit was scan-dill-us; for some of the little boys got tipsy, and had to\nbe tooked home. He would n't let us have any wine; and gwandma said it\nwas vewy impwoper for childwen to do so.\"\n\n\"My mother says your mother's coup, is n't half so stylish as ours,\" put\nin Alice.\n\n\"Yes, it is, too. It's all lined with gween silk, and that's nicer\nthan old wed cloth,\" cried Maud, ruffling up like an insulted chicken.\n\n\"Well, my brother don't wear a horrid old cap, and he's got nice hair.\nI would n't have a brother like Tom. He's horrid rude, my sister says,\"\nretorted Alice.\n\n\"He is n't. Your brother is a pig.\"\n\n\"You're a fib!\"\n\n\"So are you!\"\n\nHere, I regret to say, Miss Shaw slapped Miss Lovett, who promptly\nreturned the compliment, and both began to cry.\n\nPolly, who had paused to listen to the edifying chat, parted the\nbelligerents, and finding the poor things tired, cross, and sleepy,\nyet unable to go home till sent for, proposed to play games. The\nyoung ladies consented, and \"Puss in the corner\" proved a peacemaker.\nPresently, in came the boys; and being exiles from the German,\ngladly joined in the games, which soon were lively enough to wake the\nsleepiest. \"Blind-man's-buff\" was in full swing when Mr. Shaw peeped in,\nand seeing Polly flying about with band-aged eyes, joined in the fun to\npuzzle her. He got caught directly; and great merriment was caused by\nPolly's bewilderment, for she could n't guess who he was, till she felt\nthe bald spot on his head.\n\nThis frolic put every one in such spirits, that Polly forgot her\ntrouble, and the little girls kissed each other good-night as\naffectionately as if such things as imported frocks, coups, and rival\nbrothers did n't exist \"Well, Polly, do you like parties?\" asked Fan\nwhen the last guest was gone.\n\n\"Very much; but I don't think it would be good for me to go to many,\"\nanswered Polly, slowly.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I should n't enjoy them if I did n't have a fine dress, and dance all\nthe time, and be admired, and all the rest of it.\"\n\n\"I did n't know you cared for such things,\" cried Fanny, surprised.\n\n\"Neither did I till to-night; but I do; and as I can't have'em, it's\nlucky I'm going home tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear! So you are! What shall I do without my'sweet P.,' as Sydney\ncalls you?\" sighed Fanny, bearing Polly away to be cuddled.\n\nEvery one echoed the exclamation next day; and many loving eyes followed\nthe little figure in the drab frock as it went quietly about, doing for\nthe last time the small services which would help to make its absence\nkeenly felt. Polly was to go directly after an early dinner, and having\npacked her trunk, all but one tray, she was told to go and take a run\nwhile grandma finished. Polly suspected that some pleasant surprise\nwas going to be put in; for Fan did n't offer to go with her, Maud kept\ndodging about with something under her apron, and Tom had just whisked\ninto his mother's room in a mysterious manner. So Polly took the hint\nand went away, rejoicing in the thought of the unknown treasures she was\nto carry home.\n\nMr. Shaw had not said he should come home so early, but Polly thought he\nmight, and went to meet him. Mr. Shaw did n't expect to see Polly, for\nhe had left her very busy, and now a light snow was falling; but, as he\nturned into the mall there was the round hat, and under it the bright\nface, looking all the rosier for being powdered with snow-flakes, as\nPolly came running to meet him.\n\n\"There won't be any one to help the old gentleman safely home\nto-morrow,\" he said, as Polly took his hand in both hers with an\naffectionate squeeze.\n\n\"Yes, there will; see if there is n't,\" cried Polly, nodding and\nsmiling, for Fan had confided to her that she meant to try it after her\nfriend had gone.\n\n\"I'm glad of it. But, my dear, I want you to promise that you will\ncome and make us a visit every winter, a good long one,\" said Mr. Shaw,\npatting the blue mittens folded round his hand.\n\n\"If they can spare me from home, I'd love to come dearly.\"\n\n\"They must lend you for a little while, because you do us all good, and\nwe need you.\"\n\n\"Do I? I don't see how; but I'm glad to hear you say so,\" cried Polly,\nmuch touched.\n\n\"I can't tell you how, exactly; but you brought something into my house\nthat makes it warmer and pleasanter, and won't quite vanish, I hope,\nwhen you go away, my child.\"\n\nPolly had never heard Mr. Shaw speak like that before, and did n't know\nwhat to say, she felt so proud and happy at this proof of the truth of\nher mother's words, when she said that \"even a little girl could exert\nan influence, and do some good in this big, busy world.\" She only gave\nher friend a grateful look sweeter than any words, and they went on\ntogether, hand in hand, through the \"soft-falling snow.\"\n\nIf Polly could have seen what went into that top tray, she would have\nbeen entirely overcome; for Fanny had told grandma about the poor little\npresents she had once laughed at, and they had all laid their heads\ntogether to provide something really fine and appropriate for every\nmember of the Milton family. Such a mine of riches! and so much\ngood-will, affection, and kindly forethought was packed away in the\ntempting bundles, that no one could feel offended, but would find an\nunusual charm about the pretty gifts that made them doubly welcome. I\nonly know that if Polly had suspected that a little watch was ticking\naway in a little case, with her name on it, inside that trunk, she never\ncould have left it locked as grandma advised, or have eaten her dinner\nso quietly. As it was, her heart was very full, and the tears rose to\nher eyes more than once, everyone was so kind, and so sorry to have her\ngo.\n\nTom did n't need any urging to play escort now; and both Fan and Maud\ninsisted on going too. Mrs. Shaw forgot her nerves, and put up some\nginger-bread with her own hands; Mr. Shaw kissed Polly as if she had\nbeen his dearest daughter; and grandma held her close, whispering in a\ntremulous tone, \"My little comfort, come again soon\"; while Katy waved\nher apron from the nursery window, crying, as they drove, away, \"The\nsaints bless ye, Miss Polly, dear, and sind ye the best of lucks!\"\n\nBut the crowning joke of all was Tom's good-by, for, when Polly was\nfairly settled in the car, the last \"All aboard!\" uttered, and the train\nin motion, Tom suddenly produced a knobby little bundle, and thrusting\nit in at the window, while he hung on in some breakneck fashion, said,\nwith a droll mixture of fun and feeling in his face, \"It's horrid;\nbut you wanted it, so I put it in to make you laugh. Good-by, Polly;\ngood-by, good-by!\"\n\nThe last adieu was a trifle husky, and Tom vanished as it was uttered,\nleaving Polly to laugh over his parting souvenir till the tears ran down\nher cheeks. It was a paper bag of peanuts, and poked down at the very\nbottom a photograph of Tom. It was \"horrid,\" for he looked as if taken\nby a flash of lightning, so black, wild, and staring was it; but Polly\nliked it, and whenever she felt a little pensive at parting with her\nfriends, she took a peanut, or a peep at Tom's funny picture, which made\nher merry again.\n\nSo the short journey came blithely to an end, and in the twilight she\nsaw a group of loving faces at the door of a humble little house, which\nwas more beautiful than any palace in her eyes, for it was home.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. SIX YEARS AFTERWARD\n\n\n\"WHAT do you think Polly is going to do this winter?\" exclaimed Fanny,\nlooking up from the letter she had been eagerly reading.\n\n\"Going to deliver lectures on Woman's Rights,\" said the young gentleman\nwho was carefully examining his luxuriant crop of decidedly auburn hair,\nas he lounged with both elbows on the chimney-piece.\n\n\"Going to set her cap for some young minister and marry him in the\nspring,\" added Mrs. Shaw, whose mind ran a good deal upon match-making\njust now.\n\n\"I think she is going to stay at home, and do all the work,'cause\nservants cost so much; it would be just like her,\" observed Maud, who\ncould pronounce the letter R now.\n\n\"It's my opinion she is going to open a school, or something of that\nsort, to help those brothers of hers along,\" said Mr. Shaw, who had put\ndown his paper at the sound of Polly's name.\n\n\"Every one of you wrong, though papa comes nearest the truth,\" cried\nFanny; \"she is going to give music lessons, and support herself, so that\nWill may go to college. He is the studious one, and Polly is very proud\nof him. Ned, the other brother, has a business talent, and don't care\nfor books, so he has gone out West, and will make his own way anywhere.\nPolly says she is n't needed at home now, the family is so small, and\nKitty can take her place nicely; so she is actually going to earn her\nown living, and hand over her share of the family income to Will. What a\nmartyr that girl does make of herself,\" and Fanny looked as solemn as if\nPolly had proposed some awful self-sacrifice.\n\n\"She is a sensible, brave-hearted girl, and I respect her for doing it,\"\nsaid Mr. Shaw, emphatically. \"One never knows what may happen, and it\ndoes no harm for young people to learn to be independent.\"\n\n\"If she is as pretty as she was last time I saw her, she'll get pupils\nfast enough. I would n't mind taking lessons myself,\" was the gracious\nobservation of Shaw, Jr., as he turned from the mirror, with the\nsoothing certainty that his objectionable hair actually was growing\ndarker.\n\n\"She would n't take you at any price,\" said Fanny, remembering Polly's\nlook of disappointment and disapproval when she came on her last visit\nand found him an unmistakable dandy.\n\n\"You just wait and see,\" was the placid reply.\n\n\"If Polly does carry out her plan, I wish Maud to take lessons of her;\nFanny can do as she likes, but it would please me very much to have one\nof my girls sing as Polly sings. It suits old people better than your\nopera things, and mother used to enjoy it so much.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Mr. Shaw's eye turned toward the corner of the fire where\ngrandma used to sit. The easy-chair was empty now, the kind old face was\ngone, and nothing but a very tender memory remained.\n\n\"I'd like to learn, papa, and Polly is a splendid teacher, I know; she\n's always so patient, and makes everything so pleasant. I do hope she\nwill get scholars enough to begin right away,\" said Maud.\n\n\"When is she coming?\" asked Mrs. Shaw, quite willing to help Polly,\nbut privately resolving that Maud should be finished off by the most\nfashionable master in the city.\n\n\"She does n't say. She thanks me for asking her here, as usual, but says\nshe shall go right to work and had better begin with her own little room\nat once. Won't it seem strange to have Polly in town, and yet not with\nus?\"\n\n\"We'll get her somehow. The little room will cost something, and she\ncan stay with us just as well as not, even if she does teach. Tell her I\nsay so,\" said Mr. Shaw.\n\n\"She won't come, I know; for if she undertakes to be independent, she\n'll do it in the most thorough manner,\" answered Fanny, and Mrs. Shaw\nsincerely hoped she would. It was all very well to patronize the little\nmusic-teacher, but it was not so pleasant to have her settled in the\nfamily.\n\n\"I shall do what I can for her among my friends, and I dare say she will\nget on very well with young pupils to begin with. If she starts right,\nputs her terms high enough, and gets a few good names to give her the\nentre into our first families, I don't doubt she will do nicely, for I\nmust say Polly has the manners of a lady,\" observed Mrs. Shaw.\n\n\"She's a mighty taking little body, and I'm glad she's to be in town,\nthough I'd like it better if she did n't bother about teaching, but\njust stayed here and enjoyed herself,\" said Tom, lazily.\n\n\"I've no doubt she would feel highly honored to be allowed to devote\nher time to your amusement; but she can't afford expensive luxuries, and\nshe don't approve of flirting, so you will have to let her go her own\nway, and refresh herself with such glimpses of you as her engagements\npermit,\" answered Fanny, in the sarcastic tone which was becoming\nhabitual to her.\n\n\"You are getting to be a regular old maid, Fan; as sharp as a lemon, and\ntwice as sour,\" returned Tom, looking down at her with an air of calm\nsuperiority.\n\n\"Do be quiet, children; you know I can't bear anything like contention.\nMaud, give me my Shetland shawl, and put a cushion at my back.\"\n\nAs Maud obeyed her mother, with a reproving look at her erring brother\nand sister, a pause followed, for which every one seemed grateful. They\nwere sitting about the fire after dinner, and all looked as if a little\nsunshine would do them good. It had been a dull November day, but all of\na sudden the clouds lifted, and a bright ray shot into the room. Every\none turned involuntarily to welcome it, and every one cried out, \"Why,\nPolly!\" for there on the threshold stood a bright-faced girl, smiling as\nif there was no such thing as November weather in the world.\n\n\"You dear thing, when did you come?\" cried Fanny, kissing both the\nblooming checks with real affection, while the rest hovered near,\nwaiting for a chance.\n\n\"I came yesterday, and have been getting my nest in order; but I could\nn't keep away any longer, so I ran up to say 'How do you do?'\" answered\nPolly, in the cheery voice that did one's heart good to hear.\n\n\"My Polly always brings the sunshine with her,\" and Mr. Shaw held out\nhis hands to his little friend, for she was his favorite still.\n\nIt was good to see her put both arms about his neck, and give him a\ntender kiss, that said a great deal, for grandma had died since Polly\nmet him last and she longed to comfort him, seeing how gray and old he\nhad grown.\n\nIf Tom had had any thoughts of following his father's example, something\nin Polly's manner made him change his mind, and shake hands with a\nhearty \"I'm very glad to see you, Polly,\" adding to himself, as he\nlooked at the face in the modest little bonnet: \"Prettier than ever, by\nJove!\"\n\nThere was something more than mere prettiness in Polly's face, though\nTom had not learned to see it yet. The blue eyes were clear and steady,\nthe fresh mouth frank and sweet, the white chin was a very firm one in\nspite of the dimple, and the smooth forehead under the little curls\nhad a broad, benevolent arch; while all about the face were those\nunmistakable lines and curves which can make even a plain countenance\ncomely, by breathing into it the beauty of a lovely character. Polly had\ngrown up, but she had no more style now than in the days of the round\nhat and rough coat, for she was all in gray, like a young Quakeress,\nwith no ornament but a blue bow at the throat and another in the hair.\nYet the plain suit became her excellently, and one never thought of the\ndress, looking at the active figure that wore it, for the freedom of her\nchildhood gave to Polly that good gift, health, and every movement was\nfull of the vigor, grace, and ease, which nothing else can so surely\nbestow. A happy soul in a healthy body is a rare sight in these days,\nwhen doctors flourish and every one is ill, and this pleasant union was\nthe charm which Polly possessed without knowing it.\n\n\"It does seem so good to have you here again,\" said Maud, cuddling\nPolly's cold hand, as she sat at her feet, when she was fairly\nestablished between Fanny and Mr. Shaw, while Tom leaned on the back of\nhis mother's chair, and enjoyed the prospect.\n\n\"How do you get on? When do you begin? Where is your nest? Now tell all\nabout it,\" began Fanny, who was full of curiosity about the new plan.\n\n\"I shall get on very well, I think, for I've got twelve scholars to\nbegin with, all able to pay a good price, and I shall give my first\nlesson on Monday.\"\n\n\"Don't you dread it?\" asked Fanny.\n\n\"Not much; why should I?\" answered Polly, stoutly.\n\n\"Well, I don't know; it's a new thing, and must be a little bit hard at\nfirst,\" stammered Fanny, not liking to say that working for one's living\nseemed a dreadful hardship to her.\n\n\"It will be tiresome, of course, but I shall get used to it; I shall\nlike the exercise, and the new people and places I must see will amuse\nme. Then the independence will be delightful, and if I can save a little\nto help Kitty along with, that will be best of all.\"\n\nPolly's face shone as if the prospect was full of pleasure instead of\nwork, and the hearty good will with which she undertook the new task,\nseemed to dignify her humble hopes and plans, and make them interesting\nin the sight of others.\n\n\"Who have you got for pupils?\" asked Mrs. Shaw, forgetting her nerves\nfor a minute.\n\nPolly named her list, and took a secret satisfaction in seeing the\nimpression which certain names made upon her hearers.\n\n\"How in the world did you get the Davenports and the Greys, my dear?\"\nsaid Mrs. Shaw, sitting erect in her surprise.\n\n\"Mrs. Davenport and mother are relations, you know.\"\n\n\"You never told us that before!\" \"The Davenports have been away some\nyears, and I forgot all about them. But when I was making my plan, I\nknew I must have a good name or two to set me going, so I just wrote\nand asked Mrs. D. if she would help me. She came and saw us and was very\nkind, and has got these pupils for me, like a dear, good woman as she\nis.\"\n\n\"Where did you learn so much worldly wisdom, Polly?\" asked Mr. Shaw,\nas his wife fell back in her chair, and took out her salts, as if this\ndiscovery had been too much for her.\n\n\"I learnt it here, sir,\" answered Polly, laughing. \"I used to think\npatronage and things of that sort very disagreeable and not worth\nhaving, but I've got wiser, and to a certain extent I'm glad to use\nwhatever advantages I have in my power, if they can be honestly got.\"\n\n\"Why did n't you let us help you in the beginning? We should have been\nvery glad to, I'm sure,\" put in Mrs. Shaw, who quite burned to be known\nas a joint patroness with Mrs. Davenport.\n\n\"I know you would, but you have all been so kind to me I did n't want\nto trouble you with my little plans till the first steps were taken.\nBesides, I did n't know as you would like to recommend me as a teacher,\nthough you like me well enough as plain Polly.\"\n\n\"My dear, of course I would, and we want you to take Maud at once,\nand teach her your sweet songs. She has a fine voice, and is really\nsuffering for a teacher.\"\n\nA slight smile passed over Polly's face as she returned her thanks for\nthe new pupil, for she remembered a time when Mrs. Shaw considered her\n\"sweet songs\" quite unfit for a fashionable young lady's repertoire.\n\"Where is your room?\" asked Maud.\n\n\"My old friend Miss Mills has taken me in, and I am nicely settled.\nMother did n't like the idea of my going to a strange boarding-house,\nso Miss Mills kindly made a place for me. You know she lets her rooms\nwithout board, but she is going to give me my dinners, and I'm to get\nmy own breakfast and tea, quite independently. I like that way, and it\n's very little trouble, my habits are so simple; a bowl of bread and\nmilk night and morning, with baked apples or something of that sort, is\nall I want, and I can have it when I like.\"\n\n\"Is your room comfortably furnished? Can't we lend you anything, my\ndear? An easy-chair now, or a little couch, so necessary when one comes\nin tired,\" said Mrs. Shaw, taking unusual interest in the affair.\n\n\"Thank you, but I don't need anything, for I brought all sorts of home\ncomforts with me. Oh, Fan, you ought to have seen my triumphal entry\ninto the city, sitting among my goods and chattels, in a farmer's cart.\"\nPolly's laugh was so infectious that every one smiled and forgot to be\nshocked at her performance. \"Yes,\" she added, \"I kept wishing I could\nmeet you, just to see your horrified face when you saw me sitting on\nmy little sofa, with boxes and bundles all round me, a bird-cage on one\nside, a fishing basket, with a kitten's head popping in and out of the\nhole, on the other side, and jolly old Mr. Brown, in his blue frock,\nperched on a keg of apples in front. It was a lovely bright day, and I\nenjoyed the ride immensely, for we had all sorts of adventures.\"\n\n\"Oh, tell about it,\" begged Maud, when the general laugh at Polly's\npicture had subsided.\n\n\"Well, in the first place, we forgot my ivy, and Kitty came running\nafter me, with it. Then we started again, but were soon stopped by a\ngreat shouting, and there was Will racing down the hill, waving a pillow\nin one hand and a squash pie in the other. How we did laugh when he\ncame up and explained that our neighbor, old Mrs. Dodd, had sent in a\nhop-pillow for me, in case of headache, and a pie to begin housekeeping\nwith. She seemed so disappointed at being too late that Will promised\nto get them to me, if he ran all the way to town. The pillow was easily\ndisposed of, but that pie! I do believe it was stowed in every part of\nthe wagon, and never staid anywhere. I found it in my lap, then on the\nfloor, next, upside down among the books, then just on the point\nof coasting off a trunk into the road, and at last it landed in my\nrocking-chair. Such a remarkable pie as it was, too, for in spite of all\nits wanderings, it never got spilt or broken, and we finally ate it for\nlunch, in order to be left in peace. Next, my kitty got away, and I\nhad a chase over walls and brooks before I got her, while Mr. Brown\nsat shaking with fun, to see me run. We finished off by having the\nbook-shelves tumble on our heads as we went down a hill, and losing\nmy chair off behind, as we went up a hill. A shout made us pause, and,\nlooking back, there was the poor little chair rocking all by itself in\nthe middle of the road, while a small boy sat on the fence and whooped.\nIt was great fun, I do assure you.\"\n\nPolly had run on in her lively way, not because she thought her\nadventures amounted to much, but from a wish to cheer up her friends,\nwho had struck her as looking rather dull and out of sorts, especially\nMr. Shaw; and when she saw him lean back in his chair with the old\nhearty laugh, she was satisfied, and blessed the unlucky pie for amusing\nhim.\n\n\"Oh, Polly, you do tell such interesting things!\" sighed Maud, wiping\nher eyes.\n\n\"I wish I'd met you, I'd have given you three cheers and a tiger, for\nit must have been an imposing spectacle,\" said Tom.\n\n\"No, you would n't; you'd have whisked round the corner when you saw me\ncoming or have stared straight before you, utterly unconscious of the\nyoung woman in the baggage wagon.\"\n\nPolly laughed in his face just as she used to do, when she said that,\nand, in spite of the doubt cast upon his courtesy, Tom rather liked it,\nthough he had nothing to say for himself but a reproachful, \"Now, Polly,\nthat's too bad.\"\n\n\"True, nevertheless. You must come and see my pets, Maud, for my cat\nand bird live together as happily as brother and sister,\" said Polly,\nturning to Maud, who devoured every word she said.\n\n\"That's not saying much for them,\" muttered Tom, feeling that Polly\nought to address more of her conversation to him.\n\n\"Polly knows what she's talking about; her brothers appreciate their\nsisters,\" observed Fanny, in her sharp tone.\n\n\"And Polly appreciates her brothers, don't forget to add that, ma'am,\"\nanswered Tom.\n\n\"Did I tell you that Will was going to college?\" broke in Polly, to\navert the rising storm.\n\n\"Hope he'll enjoy himself,\" observed Tom, with the air of a man who\nhad passed through all the mysteries, and reached that state of sublime\nindifference which juniors seem to pride themselves upon.\n\n\"I think he will, he is so fond of study, and is so anxious to improve\nevery opportunity. I only hope he won't overwork and get sick, as so\nmany boys do,\" said simple Polly, with such a respectful belief in the\neager thirst for knowledge of collegians as a class, that Tom regarded\nthe deluded girl with a smile of lofty pity, from the heights of his\nvast and varied experience.\n\n\"Guess he won't hurt himself. I'll see that he don't study too hard.\"\nAnd Tom's eyes twinkled as they used to do, when he planned his boyish\npranks.\n\n\"I'm afraid you can't be trusted as a guide, if various rumors I\n've heard are true,\" said Polly, looking up at him with a wistful\nexpression, that caused his face to assume the sobriety of an owl's.\n\n\"Base slanders; I'm as steady as a clock, an ornament to my class, and\na model young man, ain't I, mother?\" And Tom patted her thin cheek with\na caressing hand, sure of one firm friend in her; for when he ceased to\nbe a harum-scarum boy, Mrs. Shaw began to take great pride in her son,\nand he, missing grandma, tried to fill her place with his feeble mother.\n\n\"Yes, dear, you are all I could ask,\" and Mrs. Shaw looked up at him\nwith such affection and confidence in her eyes, that Polly gave Tom the\nfirst approving look she had vouchsafed him since she came.\n\nWhy Tom should look troubled and turn grave all at once, she could\nn't understand, but she liked to see him stroke his mother's cheek so\nsoftly, as he stood with his head resting on the high back of her chair,\nfor Polly fancied that he felt a man's pity for her weakness, and was\nlearning a son's patient love for a mother who had had much to bear with\nhim.\n\n\"I'm so glad you are going to be here all winter, for we are to be\nvery gay, and I shall enjoy taking you round with me,\" began Fanny,\nforgetting Polly's plan for a moment.\n\nPolly shook her head decidedly. \"It sounds very nice, but it can't be\ndone, Fan, for I've come to work, not play; to save, not spend; and\nparties will be quite out of the question for me.\"\n\n\"You don't intend to work all the time, without a bit of fun, I hope,\"\ncried Fanny, dismayed at the idea.\n\n\"I mean to do what I've undertaken, and not to be tempted away from\nmy purpose by anything. I should n't be fit to give lessons if I was\nup late, should I? And how far would my earnings go towards dress,\ncarriages, and all the little expenses which would come if I set up for\na young lady in society? I can't do both, and I'm not going to try,\nbut I can pick up bits of fun as I go along, and be contented with free\nconcerts and lectures, seeing you pretty often, and every Sunday Will is\nto spend with me, so I shall have quite as much dissipation as is good\nfor me.\"\n\n\"If you don't come to my parties, I'll never forgive you,\" said Fanny,\nas Polly paused, while Tom chuckled inwardly at the idea of calling\nvisits from a brother \"dissipation.\"\n\n\"Any small party, where it will do to wear a plain black silk, I can\ncome to; but the big ones must n't be thought of, thank you.\"\n\nIt was charming to see the resolution of Polly's face when she said\nthat; for she knew her weakness, and beyond that black silk she had\ndetermined not to go. Fanny said no more, for she felt quite sure that\nPolly would relent when the time came, and she planned to give her\na pretty dress for a Christmas present, so that one excuse should be\nremoved.\n\n\"I say, Polly, won't you give some of us fellows music lessons?\nSomebody wants me to play, and I'd rather learn of you than any Senor\nTwankydillo,\" said Tom, who did n't find the conversation interesting.\n\n\"Oh, yes; if any of you boys honestly want to learn, and will behave\nyourselves, I'll take you; but I shall charge extra,\" answered Polly,\nwith a wicked sparkle of the eye, though her face was quite sober, and\nher tone delightfully business-like.\n\n\"Why, Polly, Tom is n't a boy; he's twenty, and he says I must treat\nhim with respect. Besides, he's engaged, and does put on such airs,\"\nbroke in Maud who regarded her brother as a venerable being.\n\n\"Who is the little girl?\" asked Polly taking the news as a joke.\n\n\"Trix; why, did n't you know it?\" answered Maud, as if it had been an\nevent of national importance.\n\n\"No! is it true, Fan?\" and Polly turned to her friend with a face full\nof surprise, while Tom struck an imposing attitude, and affected absence\nof mind.\n\n\"I forgot to tell you in my last letter; it's just out, and we don't\nlike it very well,\" observed Fanny, who would have preferred to be\nengaged first herself.\n\n\"It's a very nice thing, and I am perfectly satisfied,\" announced Mrs.\nShaw, rousing from a slight doze.\n\n\"Polly looks as if she did n't believe it. Have n't I the appearance\nof'the happiest man alive'?\" asked Tom, wondering if it could be pity\nwhich he saw in the steady eyes fixed on him.\n\n\"No, I don't think you have,\" she said, slowly.\n\n\"How the deuce should a man look, then?\" cried Tom, rather nettled at\nher sober reception of the grand news.\n\n\"As if he had learned to care for some one a great deal more than for\nhimself,\" answered Polly, with sudden color in her cheeks, and a sudden\nsoftening of the voice, as her eyes turned away from Tom, who was the\npicture of a complacent dandy, from the topmost curl of his auburn head\nto the tips of his aristocratic boots.\n\n\"Tommy's quenched; I agree with you, Polly; I never liked Trix, and\nI hope it's only a boy-and-girl fancy, that will soon die a natural\ndeath,\" said Mr. Shaw, who seemed to find it difficult to help falling\ninto a brown study, in spite of the lively chatter going on about him.\n\nShaw, Jr., being highly incensed at the disrespectful manner in\nwhich his engagement was treated, tried to assume a superb air of\nindifference, and finding that a decided failure, was about to stroll\nout of the room with a comprehensive nod, when his mother called after\nhim: \"Where are you going, dear?\"\n\n\"To see Trix, of course. Good-by, Polly,\" and Mr. Thomas departed,\nhoping that by the skillful change of tone, from ardent impatience to\ncondescending coolness, he had impressed one hearer at least with the\nfact that he regarded Trix as the star of his existence, and Polly as a\npresuming little chit.\n\nIf he could have heard her laugh, and Fanny's remarks, his wrath would\nhave boiled over; fortunately he was spared the trial, and went away\nhoping that the coquetries of his Trix would make him forget Polly's\nlook when she answered his question.\n\n\"My dear, that boy is the most deluded creature you ever saw,\" began\nFanny, as soon as the front door banged. \"Belle and Trix both tried to\ncatch him, and the slyest got him; for, in spite of his airs, he is\nas soft-hearted as a baby. You see Trix has broken off two engagements\nalready, and the third time she got jilted herself. Such a fuss as she\nmade! I declare, it really was absurd. But I do think she felt it very\nmuch, for she would n't go out at all, and got thin, and pale, and blue,\nand was really quite touching. I pitied her, and had her here a good\ndeal, and Tom took her part; he always does stand up for the crushed\nones, and that's good of him, I allow. Well, she did the forsaken very\nprettily; let Tom amuse her, and led him on till the poor fellow lost\nhis wits, and finding her crying one day (about her hat, which was n't\nbecoming), he thought she was mourning for Mr. Banks, and so, to comfort\nher, the goose proposed. That was all she wanted; she snapped him up at\nonce, and there he is in a nice scrape; for since her engagement she is\nas gay as ever, flirts awfully with any one who comes along, and keeps\nTom in a fume all the time. I really don't think he cares for her half\nas much as he makes believe, but he'll stand by her through thick and\nthin, rather than do as Banks did.\"\n\n\"Poor Tom!\" was all Polly said, when Fan had poured the story into her\near, as they sat whispering in the sofa corner.\n\n\"My only consolation is that Trix will break off the affair before\nspring; she always does, so that she may be free for the summer\ncampaign. It won't hurt Tom, but I hate to have him make a fool of\nhimself out of pity, for he is more of a man than he seems, and I don't\nwant any one to plague him.\"\n\n\"No one but yourself,\" said Polly, smiling.\n\n\"Well, that's all fair; he is a torment sometimes, but I'm rather fond\nof him in spite of it. I get so tired of the other fellows, they are\nsuch absurd things and when Tom is in his good mood he is very nice and\nquite refreshing.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear it,\" said Polly, making a mental note of the fact.\n\n\"Yes, and when grandma was ill he was perfectly devoted. I did n't know\nthe boy had so much gentleness in him. He took her death sadly to heart,\nfor, though he did n't say much, he was very grave and steady for a long\ntime. I tried to comfort him, and we had two or three real sweet little\ntalks together, and seemed to get acquainted for the first time. It was\nvery nice, but it did n't last; good times never do with us. We soon got\nback into the old way, and now we hector one another just as before.\"\n\nFanny sighed, then yawned, and fell into her usual listless attitude, as\nif the brief excitement of Polly's coming had begun to subside.\n\n\"Walk home with me and see my funny little room. It's bright now, and\nthe air will do you good. Come, both of you, and have a frolic as we\nused to,\" said Polly, for the red sunset now burning in the west seemed\nto invite them out.\n\nThey agreed, and soon the three were walking briskly away to Polly's new\nhome, in a quiet street, where a few old trees rustled in the summer,\nand the morning sun shone pleasantly in winter time.\n\n     \"The way into my parlor\n     Is up a winding stair,\"\n\nsang Polly, running up two flights of broad, old-fashioned steps, and\nopening the door of a back room, out of which streamed the welcome glow\nof firelight.\n\n\"These are my pets, Maud,\" she added, pausing on the threshold, and\nbeckoning the girls to look in quietly.\n\nOn the rug, luxuriously basking in the warmth, lay a gray kitten, and\nclose by, meditatively roosting on one leg, stood a plump canary, who\ncocked his bright eye at the new-comers, gave a loud chirp as if to wake\nhis comrade, and then flew straight to Polly's shoulder, where he broke\ninto a joyful song to welcome his mistress home.\n\n\"Allow me to introduce my family,\" said Polly; \"this noisy little chap\nthe boys named Nicodemus; and this dozy cat is called Ashputtel, because\nthe joy of her life is to get among the cinders. Now, take off your\nthings, and let me do the honors, for you are to stop to tea, and the\ncarriage is to come for you at eight. I arranged it with your mother\nwhile you were upstairs.\"\n\n\"I want to see everything,\" said Maud, when the hats were off, and the\nhands warmed.\n\n\"So you shall; for I think my housekeeping arrangements will amuse you.\"\n\nThen Polly showed her kingdom, and the three had a merry time over it.\nThe big piano took up so much room there was no place for a bed; but\nPolly proudly displayed the resources of her chintz-covered couch, for\nthe back let down, the seat lifted up, and inside were all the pillows\nand blankets. \"So convenient, you see, and yet out of the way in the\ndaytime, for two or three of my pupils come to me,\" explained Polly.\n\nThen there was a bright drugget over the faded carpet, the little\nrocking-chair and sewing-table stood at one window, the ivy ran all over\nthe other, and hid the banqueting performances which went on in that\ncorner. Book-shelves hung over the sofa, a picture or two on the\nwalls, and a great vase of autumn leaves and grasses beautified the low\nchimney-piece. It was a very humble little room, but Polly had done her\nbest to make it pleasant, and it already had a home-like look, with the\ncheery fire, and the household pets chirping and purring confidingly on\nthe rug.\n\n\"How nice it is!\" exclaimed Maud, as she emerged from the big closet\nwhere Polly kept her stores. \"Such a cunning teakettle and saucepan,\nand a tete-a-tete set, and lots of good things to eat. Do have toast for\ntea, Polly, and let me make it with the new toasting fork; it's such\nfun to play cook.\"\n\nFanny was not so enthusiastic as her sister, for her eyes saw many\ntraces of what seemed like poverty to her; but Polly was so gay, so\nsatisfied with her small establishment, so full of happy hopes and\nplans, that her friend had not the heart to find a fault or suggest an\nimprovement, and sat where she was told, laughing and talking while the\nothers got tea.\n\n\"This will be a country supper, girls,\" said Polly, bustling about.\n\"Here is real cream, brown bread, home-made cake, and honey from my own\nbeehives. Mother fitted me out with such a supply, I'm glad to have a\nparty, for I can't eat it all quick enough. Butter the toast, Maudie,\nand put that little cover over it. Tell me when the kettle boils, and\ndon't step on Nicodemus, whatever you do.\"\n\n\"What a capital house-keeper you will make some day,\" said Fanny, as she\nwatched Polly spread her table with a neatness and despatch which was\npleasant to behold.\n\n\"Yes, it's good practice,\" laughed Polly, filling her tiny teapot, and\ntaking her place behind the tray, with a matronly air, which was the\nbest joke of the whole.\n\n\"This is the most delicious party I ever went to,\" observed Maud, with\nher mouth full of honey, when the feast was well under way. \"I do wish\nI could have a nice room like this, and a cat and a bird that would n't\neat each other up, and a dear little teakettle, and make just as much\ntoast as I like.\"\n\nSuch a peal of laughter greeted Maud's pensive aspiration, that Miss\nMills smiled over her solitary cup of tea, and little Nick burst into a\nperfect ecstasy of song, as he sat on the sugar-bowl helping himself.\n\n\"I don't care for the toast and the kettle, but I do envy you your good\nspirits, Polly,\" said Fanny, as the merriment subsided. \"I'm so tired\nof everybody and everything, it seems sometimes as if I should die of\nennui. Don't you ever feel so?\"\n\n\"Things worry me sometimes, but I just catch up a broom and sweep, or\nwash hard, or walk, or go at something with all my might, and I usually\nfind that by the time I get through the worry is gone, or I've got\ncourage enough to bear it without grumbling,\" answered Polly, cutting\nthe brown loaf energetically.\n\n\"I can't do those things, you know; there's no need of it, and I\ndon't think they'd cure my worrying,\" said Fanny, languidly feeding\nAshputtel, who sat decorously beside her, at the table, winking at the\ncream pot.\n\n\"A little poverty would do you good, Fan; just enough necessity to keep\nyou busy till you find how good work is; and when you once learn that,\nyou won't complain of ennui any more,\" returned Polly, who had taken\nkindly the hard lesson which twenty years of cheerful poverty had taught\nher.\n\n\"Mercy, no, I should hate that; but I wish some one would invent a new\namusement for rich people. I'm dead sick of parties, and flirtations,\ntrying to out-dress my neighbors, and going the same round year after\nyear, like a squirrel in a cage.\"\n\nFanny's tone was bitter as well as discontented, her face sad as well as\nlistless, and Polly had an instinctive feeling that some trouble, more\nreal than any she had ever known before, was lying heavy at her friend's\nheart. That was not the time to speak of it, but Polly resolved to stand\nready to offer sympathy, if nothing more, whenever the confidential\nminute came; and her manner was so kind, so comfortable, that Fanny felt\nits silent magic, grew more cheerful in the quiet atmosphere of that\nlittle room, and when they said good-night, after an old-time gossip by\nthe fire, she kissed her hostess warmly, saying, with a grateful look,\n\"Polly, dear, I shall come often, you do me so much good.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. LESSONS\n\n\nTHE first few weeks were hard ones, for Polly had not yet outgrown her\nnatural shyness and going among so many strangers caused her frequent\npanics. But her purpose gave her courage, and when the ice was once\nbroken, her little pupils quickly learned to love her. The novelty soon\nwore off, and though she thought she was prepared for drudgery, she\nfound it very tedious to go on doing the same thing day after day. Then\nshe was lonely, for Will could only come once a week, her leisure hours\nwere Fanny's busiest, and the \"bits of pleasure\" were so few and far\nbetween that they only tantalized her. Even her small housekeeping lost\nits charms, for Polly was a social creature, and the solitary meals were\noften sad ones. Ashputtel and Nick did their best to cheer her, but\nthey too, seemed to pine for country freedom and home atmosphere. Poor\nPuttel, after gazing wistfully out of the window at the gaunt city cats\nskulking about the yard, would retire to the rug, and curl herself up as\nif all hope of finding congenial society had failed; while little Nick\nwould sing till he vibrated on his perch, without receiving any response\nexcept an inquisitive chirp from the pert sparrows, who seemed to twit\nhim with his captivity. Yes, by the time the little teakettle had lost\nits brightness, Polly had decided that getting one's living was no\njoke, and many of her brilliant hopes had shared the fate of the little\nkettle.\n\nIf one could only make the sacrifice all at once, and done with it, then\nit would seem easier; but to keep up a daily sacrifice of one's wishes,\ntastes, and pleasures, is rather a hard task, especially when one is\npretty, young, and gay. Lessons all day, a highly instructive lecture,\nbooks over a solitary fire, or music with no audience but a sleepy\ncat and a bird with his head tucked under his wing, for evening\nentertainment, was not exactly what might be called festive; so,\nin spite of her brave resolutions, Polly did long for a little fun\nsometimes, and after saying virtuously to herself at nine: \"Yes, it is\nmuch wiser and better for me to go to bed early, and be ready for work\ntomorrow,\" she would lie awake hearing the carriages roll to and fro,\nand imagining the gay girls inside, going to party, opera, or play, till\nMrs. Dodd's hop pillow might as well have been stuffed with nettles, for\nany sleep it brought, or any use it was, except to catch and hide the\ntears that dropped on it when Polly's heart was very full.\n\nAnother thorn that wounded our Polly in her first attempt to make her\nway through the thicket that always bars a woman's progress, was the\ndiscovery that working for a living shuts a good many doors in one's\nface even in democratic America. As Fanny's guest she had been, in spite\nof poverty, kindly received wherever her friend took her, both as child\nand woman. Now, things were changed; the kindly people patronized, the\ncareless forgot all about her, and even Fanny, with all her affection,\nfelt that Polly the music teacher would not be welcome in many places\nwhere Polly the young lady had been accepted as \"Miss Shaw's friend.\"\n\nSome of the girls still nodded amiably, but never invited her to visit\nthem; others merely dropped their eyelids, and went by without speaking,\nwhile a good many ignored her as entirely as if she had been invisible.\nThese things hurt Polly more than she would confess, for at home every\none worked, and every one was respected for it. She tried not to care,\nbut girls feel little slights keenly, and more than once Polly was\nseverely tempted to give up her plan, and run away to the safe shelter\nat home.\n\nFanny never failed to ask her to every sort of festivity in the Shaw\nmansion; but after a few trials, Polly firmly declined everything but\ninformal visits when the family were alone. She soon found that even\nthe new black silk was n't fine enough for Fanny's smallest party, and,\nafter receiving a few of the expressive glances by which women convey\ntheir opinion of their neighbor's toilet, and overhearing a joke or two\n\"about that inevitable dress,\" and \"the little blackbird,\" Polly folded\naway the once treasured frock, saying, with a choke in her voice: \"I\n'll wear it for Will, he likes it, and clothes can't change his love for\nme.\"\n\nI am afraid the wholesome sweetness of Polly's nature was getting a\nlittle soured by these troubles; but before lasting harm was done, she\nreceived, from an unexpected source, some of the real help which teaches\nyoung people how to bear these small crosses, by showing them the\nheavier ones they have escaped, and by giving them an idea of the higher\npleasures one may earn in the good, old-fashioned ways that keep hearts\nsweet, heads sane, hands busy.\n\nEverybody has their days of misfortune like little Rosamond, and Polly\nwas beginning to think she had more than her share. One of these ended\nin a way which influenced her whole life, and so we will record it. It\nbegan early; for the hard-hearted little grate would n't behave itself\ntill she had used up a ruinous quantity of kindlings. Then she scalded\npoor Puttel by upsetting her coffee-pot; and instead of a leisurely,\ncosy meal, had to hurry away uncomfortably, for everything went wrong\neven to the coming off of both bonnet strings in the last dreadful\nscramble. Being late, she of course forgot her music, and hurrying back\nfor it, fell into a puddle, which capped the climax of her despair.\n\nSuch a trying morning as that was! Polly felt out of tune herself, and\nall the pianos seemed to need a tuner as much as she did. The pupils\nwere unusually stupid, and two of them announced that their mamma was\ngoing to take them to the South, whither she was suddenly called. This\nwas a blow, for they had just begun, and Polly had n't the face to send\nin a bill for a whole quarter, though her plans and calculations were\nsadly disturbed by the failure of that sum.\n\nTrudging home to dinner, tired and disappointed, poor Polly received\nanother blow, which hurt her more than the loss of all her pupils. As\nshe went hurrying along with a big music book in one hand and a paper\nbag of rolls for tea in the other, she saw Tom and Trix coming. As she\nwatched them while they slowly approached, looking so gay and handsome\nand happy, it seemed to Polly as if all the sunshine and good walking\nwas on their side of the street, all the wintry wind and mud on hers.\nLonging to see a friendly face and receive a kind word, she crossed\nover, meaning to nod and smile at least. Trix saw her first, and\nsuddenly became absorbed in the distant horizon. Tom apparently did not\nsee her, for his eyes were fixed on a fine horse just prancing by.\nPolly thought that he had seen her, and approached with a curious little\nflutter at her heart, for if Tom cut her she felt that her cup would be\nfull.\n\nOn they came, Trix intent on the view, Tom staring at the handsome\nhorse, and Polly, with red checks, expectant eyes, and the brown bundle,\nin full sight. One dreadful minute as they came parallel, and no one\nspoke or bowed, then it was all over, and Polly went on, feeling as if\nsome one had slapped her in the face. \"She would n't have believed it\nof Tom; it was all the doings of that horrid Trix; well, she would n't\ntrouble him any more, if he was such a snob as to be ashamed of her just\nbecause she carried bundles and worked for her bread.\" She clutched the\npaper bag fiercely as she said this to herself, then her eyes filled,\nand her lips trembled, as she added, \"How could he do it, before her,\ntoo?\"\n\nNow Tom was quite guiltless of this offence, and had always nodded to\nPolly when they met; but it so happened he had always been alone till\nnow, and that was why it cut so deeply, especially as Polly never had\napproved of Trix. Before she could clear her eyes or steady her face,\na gentleman met her, lifted his hat, smiled, and said pleasantly, \"Good\nmorning, Miss Polly, I'm glad to meet you.\" Then, with a sudden change\nof voice and manner, he added, \"I beg pardon is anything the matter can\nI be of service?\"\n\nIt was very awkward, but it could n't be helped, and all Polly could do\nwas to tell the truth and make the best of it.\n\n\"It's very silly, but it hurts me to be cut by my old friends. I shall\nget used to it presently, I dare say.\"\n\nMr. Sydney glanced back, recognized the couple behind them, and\nturned round with a disgusted expression. Polly was fumbling for her\nhandkerchief, and without a word he took both book and bundle from her,\na little bit of kindness that meant a good deal just then. Polly felt\nit, and it did her good; hastily wiping the traitorous eyes, she laughed\nand said cheerfully, \"There, I'm all right again; thank you, don't\ntrouble yourself with my parcels.\"\n\n\"No trouble, I assure you, and this book reminds me of what I was about\nto say. Have you an hour to spare for my little niece? Her mother wants\nher to begin, and desired me to make the inquiry.\"\n\n\"Did she, really?\" and Polly looked up at him, as if she suspected him\nof inventing the whole thing, out of kindness.\n\nMr. Sydney smiled, and taking a note from his pocket, presented it,\nsaying, with a reproachful look, \"Behold the proof of my truth, and\nnever doubt again.\"\n\nPolly begged pardon, read the note from the little girl's mother, which\nwas to have been left at her room if she was absent, and gave the\nbearer a very grateful look as she accepted this welcome addition to her\npupils. Well pleased at the success of his mission, Sydney artfully led\nthe conversation to music, and for a time Polly forgot her woes, talking\nenthusiastically on her favorite theme. As she reclaimed her book and\nbag, at her own door, she said, in her honest way, \"Thank you very much\nfor trying to make me forget my foolish little troubles.\"\n\n\"Then let me say one thing more; though appearances are against him,\nI don't believe Tom Shaw saw you. Miss Trix is equal to that sort of\nthing, but it is n't like Tom, for with all his foppery he is a good\nfellow at heart.\"\n\nAs Mr. Sydney said this, Polly held out her hand with a hearty \"Thank\nyou for that.\" The young man shook the little hand in the gray woollen\nglove, gave her exactly the same bow which he did the Honorable Mrs.\nDavenport, and went away, leaving Polly to walk up stairs and address\nPuttel with the peculiar remark, \"You are a true gentleman! so kind\nto say that about Tom. I'll think it's so, anyway; and won't I teach\nMinnie in my very best style!\"\n\nPuttel purred, Nick chirped approvingly, and Polly ate her dinner with\na better appetite than she had expected. But at the bottom of her heart\nthere was a sore spot still, and the afternoon lessons dragged dismally.\nIt was dusk when she got home, and as she sat in the firelight eating\nher bread and milk, several tears bedewed the little rolls, and even the\nhome honey had a bitter taste.\n\n\"Now this won't do,\" she broke out all at once; \"this is silly and\nwicked, and can't be allowed. I'll try the old plan and put myself\nright by doing some little kindness to somebody. Now what shall it be?\nO, I know! Fan is going to a party to-night; I'll run up and help her\ndress; she likes to have me, and I enjoy seeing the pretty things. Yes,\nand I'll take her two or three clusters of my daphne, it's so sweet.\"\n\nUp got Polly, and taking her little posy, trotted away to the Shaws',\ndetermined to be happy and contented in spite of Trix and hard work.\n\nShe found Fanny enduring torment under the hands of the hair-dresser,\nwho was doing his best to spoil her hair, and distort her head with\na mass of curls, braids, frizzles, and puffs; for though I discreetly\nrefrain from any particular description, still, judging from the present\nfashions, I think one may venture to predict that six years hence they\nwould be something frightful.\n\n\"How kind of you, Polly; I was just wishing you were here to arrange my\nflowers. These lovely daphnes will give odor to my camellias, and you\nwere a dear to bring them. There's my dress; how do you like it?\" said\nFanny, hardly daring to lift her eyes from under the yellow tower on her\nhead.\n\n\"It's regularly splendid; but how do you ever get into it?\" answered\nPolly, surveying with girlish interest the cloud of pink and white lace\nthat lay upon the bed.\n\n\"It's fearfully and wonderfully made, but distractingly becoming, as\nyou shall see. Trix thinks I'm going to wear blue, so she has got a\ngreen one, and told Belle it would spoil the effect of mine, as we are\nmuch together, of course. Was n't that sweet of her? Belle came and told\nme in, time, and I just got pink, so my amiable sister, that is to be,\nwon't succeed in her pretty little plot.\"\n\n\"I guess she has been reading the life of Josephine. You know she made\na pretty lady, of whom she was jealous, sit beside her on a green sofa,\nwhich set off her own white dress and spoilt the blue one of her guest,\"\nanswered Polly, busy with the flowers.\n\n\"Trix never reads anything; you are the one to pick up clever little\nstories. I'll remember and use this one. Am I done? Yes, that is\ncharming, is n't it, Polly?\" and Fan rose to inspect the success of\nMonsieur's long labor.\n\n\"You know I don't appreciate a stylish coiffure as I ought, so I like\nyour hair in the old way best. But this is'the thing,' I suppose, and\nnot a word must be said.\"\n\n\"Of course it is. Why, child, I have frizzed and burnt my hair so that I\nlook like an old maniac with it in its natural state, and have to repair\ndamages as well as I can. Now put the flowers just here,\" and Fanny laid\na pink camellia in a nest of fuzz, and stuck a spray of daphne straight\nup at the back of her head.\n\n\"O, Fan, don't, it looks horridly so!\" cried Polly, longing to add a\nlittle beauty to her friend's sallow face by a graceful adjustment of\nthe flowers.\n\n\"Can't help it, that's the way, and so it must be,\" answered Fan,\nplanting another sprig half-way up the tower.\n\nPolly groaned and offered no more suggestions as the work went on; but\nwhen Fan was finished from top to toe, she admired all she honestly\ncould, and tried to keep her thoughts to herself. But her frank face\nbetrayed her, for Fanny turned on her suddenly, saying, \"You may as\nwell free your mind, Polly, for I see by your eyes that something don't\nsuit.\"\n\n\"I was only thinking of what grandma once said, that modesty had gone\nout of fashion,\" answered Polly, glancing at the waist of her friend's\ndress, which consisted of a belt, a bit of lace, and a pair of shoulder\nstraps.\n\nFanny laughed good-naturedly, saying, as she clasped her necklace, \"If I\nhad such shoulders as yours, I should n't care what the fashion was. Now\ndon't preach, but put my cloak on nicely, and come along, for I'm to\nmeet Tom and Trix, and promised to be there early.\"\n\nPolly was to be left at home after depositing Fan at Belle's.\n\n\"I feel as if I was going myself,\" she said, as they rolled along.\n\n\"I wish you were, and you would be, Polly, if you weren't such a\nresolute thing. I've teased, and begged, and offered anything I have if\nyou'll only break your absurd vow, and come and enjoy yourself.\"\n\n\"Thank you; but I won't, so don't trouble your kind heart about me; I'm\nall right,\" said Polly, stoutly.\n\nBut when they drew up before the lighted house, and she found herself\nin the midst of the pleasant stir of festivity, the coming and going of\ncarriages, the glimpses of bright colors, forms, and faces, the bursts\nof music, and a general atmosphere of gayety, Polly felt that she was\nn't all right, and as she drove away for a dull evening in her lonely\nlittle room, she just cried as heartily as any child denied a stick of\ncandy.\n\n\"It's dreadful wicked of me, but I can't help it,\" she sobbed to\nherself, in the corner of the carriage. \"That music sets me all in a\ntwitter, and I should have looked nice in Fan's blue tarlatan, and\nI know I could behave as well as any one, and have lots of partners,\nthough I'm not in that set. Oh, just one good gallop with Mr. Sydney or\nTom! No, Tom would n't ask me there, and I would n't accept if he did.\nOh, me! oh, me! I wish I was as old and homely, and good and happy, as\nMiss Mills!\"\n\nSo Polly made her moan, and by the time she got home, was just in the\nmood to go to bed and cry herself to sleep, as girls have a way of doing\nwhen their small affliction becomes unbearable.\n\nBut Polly did n't get a chance to be miserable very long, for as she\nwent up stairs feeling like the most injured girl in the world, she\ncaught a glimpse of Miss Mills, sewing away with such a bright face that\nshe could n't resist stopping for a word or two.\n\n\"Sit down, my dear, I'm glad to see you, but excuse me if I go on with\nmy work, as I'm in a driving hurry to get these things done to-night,\"\nsaid the brisk little lady, with a smile and a nod, as she took a new\nneedleful of thread, and ran up a seam as if for a wager.\n\n\"Let me help you, then; I'm lazy and cross, and it will do me good,\"\nsaid Polly, sitting down with the resigned feeling. \"Well, if I can't be\nhappy, I can be useful, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my dear; yes, you can just hem the skirt while I put in the\nsleeves, and that will be a great lift.\"\n\nPolly put on her thimble in silence, but as Miss Mills spread the white\nflannel over her lap, she exclaimed, \"Why, it looks like a shroud! Is it\none?\"\n\n\"No, dear, thank God, it is n't, but it might have been, if we had n't\nsaved the poor little soul,\" cried Miss Mills, with a sudden brightening\nof the face, which made it beautiful in spite of the stiff gray curl\nthat bobbed on each temple, the want of teeth, and a crooked nose.\n\n\"Will you tell me about it? I like to hear your adventures and good\nworks so much,\" said Polly, ready to be amused by anything that made her\nforget herself.\n\n\"Ah, my dear, it's a very common story, and that's the saddest part of\nit. I'll tell you all about it, for I think you may be able to help me.\nLast night I watched with poor Mary Floyd. She's dying of consumption,\nyou know,\" began Miss Mills, as her nimble fingers flew, and her kind\nold face beamed over the work, as if she put a blessing in with every\nstitch. \"Mary was very low, but about midnight fell asleep, and I was\ntrying to keep things quiet, when Mrs. Finn she's the woman of the\nhouse came and beckoned me out, with a scared face. 'Little Jane has\nkilled herself, and I don't know what to do,' she said, leading me up to\nthe attic.\"\n\n\"Who was little Jane?\" broke in Polly, dropping her work.\n\n\"I only knew her as a pale, shy young girl who went in and out, and\nseldom spoke to any one. Mrs. Finn told me she was poor, but a busy,\nhonest, little thing, who did n't mix with the other folks, but lived\nand worked alone. 'She has looked so down-hearted and pale for a week,\nthat I thought she was sick, and asked her about it,' said Mrs. Finn,\n'but she thanked me in her bashful way, and said she was pretty well, so\nI let her alone. But to-night, as I went up late to bed, I was kind of\nimpressed to look in and see how the poor thing did, for she had n't\nleft her room all day. I did look in, and here's what I found.' As Mrs.\nFinn ended she opened the door of the back attic, and I saw about as sad\na sight as these old eyes ever looked at.\"\n\n\"O, what?\" cried Polly, pale now with interest.\n\n\"A bare room, cold as a barn, and on the bed a little dead, white face\nthat almost broke my heart, it was so thin, so patient, and so young. On\nthe table was a bottle half full of laudanum, an old pocket-book, and a\nletter. Read that, my dear and don't think hard of little Jane.\"\n\nPolly took the bit of paper Miss Mills gave her, and read these words:\n\nDEAR MRS. FINN, Please forgive me for the trouble I make you, but I\ndon't see any other way. I can't get work that pays enough to keep me;\nthe Dr. says I can't be well unless I rest. I hate to be a burden, so\nI'm going away not to trouble anybody anymore. I've sold my things to\npay what I owe you. Please let me be as I am, and don't let people come\nand look at me. I hope it is n't very wicked, but there don't seem\nany room for me in the world, and I'm not afraid to die now, though\nI should be if I stayed and got bad because I had n't strength to keep\nright. Give my love to the baby, and so good-by, good-by.\n\nJANE BRYANT.\n\n\"O, Miss Mills, how dreadful!\" cried Polly, with her eyes so full she\ncould hardly read the little letter.\n\n\"Not so dreadful as it might have been, but a bitter, sad thing to\nsee that child, only seventeen, lying there in her little clean, old\nnight-gown, waiting for death to come and take her, because'there did\nn't seem to be any room for her in the world.' Ah, well, we saved her,\nfor it was n't too late, thank heaven, and the first thing she said was,\n'Oh, why did you bring me back?' I've been nursing her all day, hearing\nher story, and trying to show her that there is room and a welcome for\nher. Her mother died a year ago, and since then she has been struggling\nalong alone. She is one of the timid, innocent, humble creatures who\ncan't push their way, and so get put aside and forgotten. She has\ntried all sorts of poorly paid work, could n't live on it decently, got\ndiscouraged, sick, frightened, and could see no refuge from the big, bad\nworld but to get out of it while she was n't afraid to die. A very old\nstory, my dear, new and dreadful as it seems to you, and I think it\nwon't do you any harm to see and help this little girl, who has gone\nthrough dark places that you are never like to know.\"\n\n\"I will; indeed, I will do all I can! Where is she now?\" asked Polly,\ntouched to the heart by the story, so simple yet so sad.\n\n\"There,\" and Miss Mills pointed to the door of her own little bedroom.\n\"She was well enough to be moved to-night, so I brought her home and\nlaid her safely in my bed. Poor little soul! she looked about her for\na minute, then the lost look went away, and she gave a great sigh, and\ntook my hand in both her thin bits of ones, and said, 'O, ma'am, I feel\nas if I'd been born into a new world. Help me to begin again, and I\n'll do better.' So I told her she was my child now, and might rest here,\nsure of a home as long as I had one.\"\n\nAs Miss Mills spoke in her motherly tone, and cast a proud and happy\nlook toward the warm and quiet nest in which she had sheltered this\nfriendless little sparrow, feeling sure that God meant her to keep it\nfrom falling to the ground, Polly put both arms about her neck, and\nkissed her withered cheek with as much loving reverence as if she had\nbeen a splendid saint, for in the likeness of this plain old maid she\nsaw the lovely charity that blesses and saves the world.\n\n\"How good you are! Dear Miss Mills, tell me what to do, let me help you,\nI'm ready for anything,\" said Polly, very humbly, for her own troubles\nlooked so small and foolish beside the stern hardships which had nearly\nhad so tragical an end, that she felt heartily ashamed of herself, and\nquite burned to atone for them.\n\nMiss, Mills stopped to stroke the fresh cheek opposite, to smile, and\nsay, \"Then, Polly, I think I'll ask you to go in and say a friendly\nword to my little girl. The sight of you will do her good; and you have\njust the right way of comforting people, without making a fuss.\"\n\n\"Have I?\" said Polly, looking much gratified by the words.\n\n\"Yes, dear, you've the gift of sympathy, and the rare art of showing it\nwithout offending. I would n't let many girls in to see my poor Jenny,\nbecause they'd only flutter and worry her; but you'll know what to do;\nso go, and take this wrapper with you; it's done now, thanks to your\nnimble fingers.\"\n\nPolly threw the warm garment over her arm, feeling a thrill of gratitude\nthat it was to wrap a living girl in, and not to hide away a young heart\nthat had grown cold too soon. Pushing open the door, she went quietly\ninto the dimly lighted room, and on the pillow saw a face that drew her\nto it with an irresistible power, for it was touched by a solemn shadow\nthat made its youth pathetic. As she paused at the bedside, thinking the\ngirl asleep, a pair of hollow, dark eyes opened wide, and looked up at\nher; startled at first, then softening with pleasure, at sight of the\nbonny face before them, and then a humble, beseeching expression filled\nthem, as if asking pardon for the rash act nearly committed, and pity\nfor the hard fate that prompted it. Polly read the language of these\neyes, and answered their mute prayer with a simple eloquence that said\nmore than any words for she just stooped down and kissed the poor child,\nwith her own eyes full, and lips that trembled with the sympathy she\ncould not tell. Jenny put both arms about her neck, and began to shed\nthe quiet tears that so refresh and comfort heavy hearts when a tender\ntouch unseals the fountain where they lie.\n\n\"Everybody is so kind,\" she sobbed, \"and I was so wicked, I don't\ndeserve it.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you do; don't think of that, but rest and let us pet you. The\nold life was too hard for such a little thing as you, and we are going\nto try and make the new one ever so much easier and happier,\" said\nPolly, forgetting everything except that this was a girl like herself,\nwho needed heartening up.\n\n\"Do you live here?\" asked Jenny, when her tears were wiped away, still\nclinging to the new-found friend.\n\n\"Yes, Miss Mills lets me have a little room up stairs, and there I have\nmy cat and bird, my piano and my posy pots, and live like a queen. You\nmust come up and see me to-morrow if you are able. I'm often lonely,\nfor there are no young people in the house to play with me,\" answered\nPolly, smiling hospitably.\n\n\"Do you sew?\" asked Jenny.\n\n\"No, I'm a music teacher, and trot round giving lessons all day.\"\n\n\"How beautiful it sounds, and how happy you must be, so strong and\npretty, and able to go round making music all the time,\" sighed Jenny,\nlooking with respectful admiration at the plump, firm hand held in both\nher thin and feeble ones.\n\nIt did sound pleasant even to Polly's ears, and she felt suddenly so\nrich, and so contented, that she seemed a different creature from the\nsilly girl who cried because she could n't go to the party. It passed\nthrough her mind like a flash, the contrast between her life, and that\nof the wan creature lying before her, and she felt as if she could not\ngive enough out of her abundance to this needy little sister, who had\nnothing in the wide world but the life just saved to her. That minute\ndid more for Polly than many sermons, or the wisest books, for it\nbrought her face to face with bitter truths, showed her the dark side\nof life, and seemed to blow away her little vanities, her frivolous\ndesires, like a wintry wind, that left a wholesome atmosphere behind.\nSitting on the bedside, Polly listened while Jane told the story, which\nwas so new to her listener, that every word sank deep into her heart,\nand never was forgotten.\n\n\"Now you must go to sleep. Don't cry nor think, nor do anything but\nrest. That will please Miss Mills best. I'll leave the doors open, and\nplay you a lullaby that you can't resist. Good night, dear.\" And with\nanother kiss, Polly went away to sit in the darkness of her own room,\nplaying her softest airs till the tired eyes below were shut, and little\nJane seemed to float away on a sea of pleasant sounds, into the happier\nlife which had just dawned for her.\n\nPolly had fully intended to be very miserable, and cry herself to sleep;\nbut when she lay down at last, her pillow seemed very soft, her little\nroom very lovely, with the firelight flickering on all the home-like\nobjects, and her new-blown roses breathing her a sweet good-night. She\nno longer felt an injured, hard-working, unhappy Polly, but as if quite\nburdened with blessings, for which she was n't half grateful enough. She\nhad heard of poverty and suffering, in the vague, far-off way, which is\nall that many girls, safe in happy homes, ever know of it; but now she\nhad seen it, in a shape which she could feel and understand, and life\ngrew more earnest to her from that minute. So much to do in the great,\nbusy world, and she had done so little. Where should she begin?\nThen, like an answer came little Jenny's words, now taking a'new\nsignificance' to Polly's mind, \"To be strong, and beautiful, and go\nround making music all the time.\" Yes, she could do that; and with a\nvery earnest prayer, Polly asked for the strength of an upright soul,\nthe beauty of a tender heart, the power to make her life a sweet and\nstirring song, helpful while it lasted, remembered when it died.\n\nLittle Jane's last thought had been to wish with all her might, that\n\"God would bless the dear, kind girl up there, and give her all she\nasked.\" I think both prayers, although too humble to be put in words,\nwent up together, for in the fulness of time they were beautifully\nanswered.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. BROTHERS AND SISTERS\n\n\nPOLLY'S happiest day was Sunday, for Will never failed to spend it with\nher. Instead of sleeping later than usual that morning, she was always\nup bright and early, flying round to get ready for her guest, for Will\ncame to breakfast, and they made a long day of it. Will considered his\nsister the best and prettiest girl going, and Polly, knowing well that a\ntime would come when he would find a better and a prettier, was grateful\nfor his good opinion, and tried to deserve it. So she made her room and\nherself as neat and inviting as possible, and always ran to meet him\nwith a bright face and a motherly greeting, when he came tramping in,\nruddy, brisk, and beaming, with the brown loaf and the little pot of\nbeans from the bake-house near by.\n\nThey liked a good country breakfast, and nothing gave Polly more\nsatisfaction than to see her big boy clear the dishes, empty the little\ncoffee-pot, and then sit and laugh at her across the ravaged table.\nAnother pleasure was to let him help clear away, as they used to do\nat home, while the peals of laughter that always accompanied this\nperformance did Miss Mills' heart good to hear, for the room was so\nsmall and Will so big that he seemed to be everywhere at once, and Polly\nand Puttel were continually dodging his long arms and legs. Then they\nused to inspect the flower pots, pay Nick a visit, and have a little\nmusic as a good beginning for the day, after which they went to church\nand dined with Miss Mills, who considered Will \"an excellent young\nman.\" If the afternoon was fair, they took a long walk together over\nthe bridges into the country, or about the city streets full of Sabbath\nquietude. Most people meeting them would have seen only an awkward young\nman, with a boy's face atop of his tall body, and a quietly dressed,\nfresh faced little woman hanging on his arm; but a few people, with eyes\nto read romances and pleasant histories everywhere, found something very\nattractive in this couple, and smiled as they passed, wondering if they\nwere young, lovers, or country cousins \"looking round.\"\n\nIf the day was stormy, they stayed at home, reading, writing letters,\ntalking over their affairs, and giving each other good advice; for,\nthough Will was nearly three years younger than Polly, he could n't for\nthe life of him help assuming amusingly venerable airs, when he became\na Freshman. In the twilight he had a good lounge on the sofa, and Polly\nsung to him, which arrangement he particularly enjoyed, it was so \"cosy\nand homey.\" At nine o'clock, Polly packed his bag with clean clothes,\nnicely mended, such remnants of the festive tea as were transportable,\nand kissed him \"good-night,\" with many injunctions to muffle up his\nthroat going over the bridge, and be sure that his feet were dry\nand warm when he went to bed. All of which Will laughed at, accepted\ngraciously, and did n't obey; but he liked it, and trudged away for\nanother week's work, rested, cheered, and strengthened by that quiet,\nhappy day with Polly, for he had been brought up to believe in home\ninfluences, and this brother and sister loved one another dearly, and\nwere not ashamed to own it.\n\nOne other person enjoyed the humble pleasures of these Sundays quite as\nmuch as Polly and Will. Maud used to beg to come to tea, and Polly, glad\nto do anything for those who had done a good deal for her, made a point\nof calling for the little girl as they came home from their walk, or\nsending Will to escort her in the carriage, which Maud always managed\nto secure if bad weather threatened to quench her hopes. Tom and Fanny\nlaughed at her fancy, but she did not tire of it, for the child was\nlonely, and found something in that little room which the great house\ncould not give her.\n\nMaud was twelve now; a pale, plain child, with sharp, intelligent eyes,\nand a busy little mind, that did a good deal more thinking than anybody\nimagined. She was just at the unattractive, fidgety age when no one\nknew what to do with her, and so let her fumble her way up as she could,\nfinding pleasure in odd things, and living much alone, for she did not\ngo to school, because her shoulders were growing round, and Mrs.\nShaw would not \"allow her figure to be spoiled.\" That suited Maud\nexcellently; and whenever her father spoke of sending her again, or\ngetting a governess, she was seized with bad headaches, a pain in her\nback, or weakness of the eyes, at which Mr. Shaw laughed, but let her\nholiday go on. Nobody seemed to care much for plain, pug-nosed little\nMaudie; her father was busy, her mother nervous and sick, Fanny absorbed\nin her own affairs, and Tom regarded her as most young men do their\nyounger sisters, as a person born for his amusement and convenience,\nnothing more. Maud admired Tom with all her heart, and made a little\nslave of herself to him, feeling well repaid if he merely said, \"Thank\nyou, chicken,\" or did n't pinch her nose, or nip her ear, as he had a\nway of doing, \"just as if I was a doll, or a dog, and had n't got any\nfeelings,\" she sometimes said to Fanny, when some service or sacrifice\nhad been accepted without gratitude or respect. It never occurred to\nTom, when Maud sat watching him with her face full of wistfulness, that\nshe wanted to be petted as much as ever he did in his neglected boyhood,\nor that when he called her \"Pug\" before people, her little feelings were\nas deeply wounded as his used to be, when the boys called him \"Carrots.\"\nHe was fond of her in his fashion, but he did n't take the trouble to\nshow it, so Maud worshipped him afar off, afraid to betray the affection\nthat no rebuff could kill or cool.\n\nOne snowy Sunday afternoon Tom lay on the sofa in his favorite attitude,\nreading \"Pendennis\" for the fourth time, and smoking like a chimney as\nhe did so. Maud stood at the window watching the falling flakes with an\nanxious countenance, and presently a great sigh broke from her.\n\n\"Don't do that again, chicken, or you'll blow me away. What's the\nmatter?\" asked Tom, throwing down his book with a yawn that threatened\ndislocation.\n\n\"I'm afraid I can't go to Polly's,\" answered Maud, disconsolately.\n\n\"Of course you can't; it's snowing hard, and father won't be home\nwith the carriage till this evening. What are you always cutting off to\nPolly's for?\"\n\n\"I like it; we have such nice times, and Will is there, and we bake\nlittle johnny-cakes in the baker before the fire, and they sing, and it\nis so pleasant.\"\n\n\"Warbling johnny-cakes must be interesting. Come and tell me all about\nit.\"\n\n\"No, you'll only laugh at me.\"\n\n\"I give you my word I won't, if I can help it; but I really am dying of\ncuriosity to know what you do down there. You like to hear secrets, so\ntell me yours, and I'll be as dumb as an oyster.\"\n\n\"It is n't a secret, and you would n't care for it. Do you want another\npillow?\" she added, as Tom gave his a thump.\n\n\"This will do; but why you women always stick tassels and fringe all\nover a sofa-cushion, to tease and tickle a fellow, is what I don't\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"One thing that Polly does Sunday nights, is to take Will's head in her\nlap, and smooth his forehead. It rests him after studying so hard, she\nsays. If you don't like the pillow, I could do that for you,'cause you\nlook as if you were more tired of studying than Will,\" said Maud, with\nsome hesitation, but an evident desire to be useful and agreeable.\n\n\"Well, I don't care if you do try it, for I am confoundedly tired.\" And\nTom laughed, as he recalled the frolic he had been on the night before.\n\nMaud established herself with great satisfaction, and Tom owned that a\nsilk apron was nicer than a fuzzy cushion.\n\n\"Do you like it?\" she asked, after a few strokes over the hot forehead,\nwhich she thought was fevered by intense application to Greek and Latin.\n\n\"Not bad; play away,\" was the gracious reply, as Tom shut his eyes,\nand lay so still that Maud was charmed at the success of her attempt.\nPresently, she said, softly, \"Tom, are you asleep?\"\n\n\"Just turning the corner.\"\n\n\"Before you get quite round would you please tell me what a Public\nAdmonition is?\"\n\n\"What do you want to know for?\" demanded Tom, opening his eyes very\nwide.\n\n\"I heard Will talking about Publics and Privates, and I meant to ask\nhim, but I forgot.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\n\"I don't remember; it was about somebody who cut prayers, and got\na Private, and had done all sorts of bad things, and had one or two\nPublics. I did n't hear the name and did n't care; I only wanted to know\nwhat the words meant.\"\n\n\"So Will tells tales, does he?\" and Tom's forehead wrinkled with a\nfrown.\n\n\"No, he did n't; Polly knew about it and asked him.\"\n\n\"Will's a'dig,'\" growled Tom, shutting his eyes again, as if nothing\nmore could be said of the delinquent William.\n\n\"I don't care if he is; I like him very much, and so does Polly.\"\n\n\"Happy Fresh!\" said Tom, with a comical groan.\n\n\"You need n't sniff at him, for he is nice, and treats me with respect,\"\ncried Maud, with an energy that made Tom laugh in her face.\n\n\"He's good to Polly always, and puts on her cloak for her, and says'my\ndear,' and kisses her'good-night,' and don't think it's silly, and I\nwish I had a brother just like him, yes, I do!\" And Maud showed signs of\nwoe, for her disappointment about going was very great.\n\n\"Bless my boots! what's the chicken ruffling up her little feathers and\npecking at me for? Is that the way Polly soothes the best of brothers?\"\nsaid Tom, still laughing.\n\n\"Oh, I forgot! there, I won't cry; but I do want to go,\" and Maud\nswallowed her tears, and began to stroke again.\n\nNow Tom's horse and sleigh were in the stable, for he meant to drive out\nto College that evening, but he did n't take Maud's hint. It was less\ntrouble to lie still, and say in a conciliatory tone, \"Tell me some more\nabout this good boy, it's very interesting.\"\n\n\"No, I shan't, but I'll tell about Puttel's playing on the piano,\" said\nMaud, anxious to efface the memory of her momentary weakness. \"Polly\npoints to the right key with a little stick, and Puttel sits on the\nstool and pats each key as it's touched, and it makes a tune. It's\nso funny to see her, and Nick perches on the rack and sings as if he'd\nkill himself.\"\n\n\"Very thrilling,\" said Tom, in a sleepy tone.\n\nMaud felt that her conversation was not as interesting as she hoped, and\ntried again.\n\n\"Polly thinks you are handsomer than Mr. Sydney.\"\n\n\"Much obliged.\"\n\n\"I asked which she thought had the nicest face, and she said yours was\nthe handsomest, and his the best.\"\n\n\"Does he ever go there?\" asked a sharp voice behind them; and looking\nround Maud saw Fanny in the big chair, cooking her feet over the\nregister.\n\n\"I never saw him there; he sent up some books one day, and Will teased\nher about it.\"\n\n\"What did she do?\" demanded Fanny. \"Oh, she shook him.\"\n\n\"What a spectacle!\" and Tom looked as if he would have enjoyed seeing\nit, but Fanny's face grew so forbidding, that Tom's little dog, who was\napproaching to welcome her, put his tail between his legs and fled under\nthe table.\n\n\"Then there is n't any 'Sparking Sunday night'?\" sung Tom, who appeared\nto have waked up again.\n\n\"Of course not. Polly is n't going to marry anybody; she's going to\nkeep house for Will when he's a minister, I heard her say so,\" cried\nMaud, with importance.\n\n\"What a fate for pretty Polly!\" ejaculated Tom.\n\n\"She likes it, and I'm sure I should think she would; it's beautiful\nto hear'em plan it all out.\"\n\n\"Any more gossip to retail, Pug?\" asked Tom a minute after, as Maud\nseemed absorbed in visions of the future.\n\n\"He told a funny story about blowing up one of the professors. You\nnever told us, so I suppose you did n't know it. Some bad fellow put a\ntorpedo, or some sort of powder thing, under the chair, and it went off\nin the midst of the lesson, and the poor man flew up, frightened most\nto pieces, and the boys ran with pails of water to put the fire out. But\nthe thing that made Will laugh most was, that the very fellow who did it\ngot his trousers burnt trying to put out the fire, and he asked the is\nit Faculty or President?\"\n\n\"Either will do,\" murmured Tom, who was shaking with suppressed\nlaughter.\n\n\"Well, he asked'em to give him some new ones, and they did give him\nmoney enough, for a nice pair; but he got some cheap ones, with horrid\ngreat stripes on'em, and always wore'em to that particular class,\n'which was one too many for the fellows,' Will said, and with the rest\nof the money he had a punch party. Was n't it dreadful?\"\n\n\"Awful!\" And Tom exploded into a great laugh, that made Fanny cover her\nears, and the little dog bark wildly.\n\n\"Did you know that bad boy?\" asked innocent Maud.\n\n\"Slightly,\" gasped Tom, in whose wardrobe at college those identical\ntrousers were hanging at that moment.\n\n\"Don't make such a noise, my head aches dreadfully,\" said Fanny,\nfretfully.\n\n\"Girls' heads always do ache,\" answered Tom, subsiding from a roar into\na chuckle.\n\n\"What pleasure you boys can find in such ungentlemanly things, I don't\nsee,\" said Fanny, who was evidently out of sorts.\n\n\"As much a mystery to you as it is to us, how you girls can like to\ngabble and prink from one week's end to the other,\" retorted Tom.\n\nThere was a pause after this little passage-at-arms, but Fan wanted to\nbe amused, for time hung heavily on her hands, so she asked, in a more\namiable tone, \"How's Trix?\"\n\n\"As sweet as ever,\" answered Tom, gruffly.\n\n\"Did she scold you, as usual?\"\n\n\"She just did.\"\n\n\"What was the matter?\"\n\n\"Well, I'll leave it to you if this is n't unreasonable: she won't\ndance with me herself, yet don't like me to go it with anybody else. I\nsaid, I thought, if a fellow took a girl to a party, she ought to dance\nwith him once, at least, especially if they were engaged. She said that\nwas the very reason why she should n't do it; so, at the last hop, I let\nher alone, and had a gay time with Belle, and to-day Trix gave it to me\nhot and heavy, coming home from church.\"\n\n\"If you go and engage yourself to a girl like that, I don't know what\nyou can expect. Did she wear her Paris hat to-day?\" added Fan, with\nsudden interest in her voice.\n\n\"She wore some sort of a blue thing, with a confounded bird of Paradise\nin it, that kept whisking into my face every time she turned her head.\"\n\n\"Men never know a pretty thing when they see it. That hat is perfectly\nlovely.\"\n\n\"They know a lady when they see her, and Trix don't look like one; I\ncan't say where the trouble is, but there's too much fuss and feathers\nfor my taste. You are twice as stylish, yet you never look loud or\nfast.\"\n\nTouched by this unusual compliment, Fanny drew her chair nearer as she\nreplied with complacency, \"Yes, I flatter myself I do know how to dress\nwell. Trix never did; she's fond of gay colors, and generally looks\nlike a walking rainbow.\"\n\n\"Can't you give her a hint? Tell her not to wear blue gloves anyway, she\nknows I hate'em.\"\n\n\"I've done my best for your sake, Tom, but she is a perverse creature,\nand don't mind a word I say, even about things much more objectionable\nthan blue gloves.\"\n\n\"Maudie, run and bring me my other cigar case, it's lying round\nsomewhere.\"\n\nMaud went; and as soon as the door was shut, Tom rose on his elbow,\nsaying in a cautiously lowered voice, \"Fan, does Trix paint?\"\n\n\"Yes, and draws too,\" answered Fanny, with a sly laugh.\n\n\"Come, you know what I mean; I've a right to ask and you ought to\ntell,\" said Tom, soberly, for he was beginning to find that being\nengaged was not unmitigated bliss.\n\n\"What makes you think she does?\"\n\n\"Well, between ourselves,\" said Tom, looking a little sheepish, but\nanxious to set his mind at rest, \"she never will let me kiss her on her\ncheek, nothing but an unsatisfactory peck at her lips. Then the\nother day, as I took a bit of heliotrope out of a vase to put in my\nbutton-hole, I whisked a drop of water into her face; I was going to\nwipe it off, but she pushed my hand away, and ran to the glass, where\nshe carefully dabbed it dry, and came back with one cheek redder than\nthe other. I did n't say anything, but I had my suspicions. Come now,\ndoes she?\"\n\n\"Yes, she does; but don't say a word to her, for she'll never forgive\nmy telling if she knew it.\"\n\n\"I don't care for that; I don't like it, and I won't have it,\" said Tom,\ndecidedly.\n\n\"You can't help yourself. Half the girls do it, either paint or powder,\ndarken their lashes with burnt hair-pins, or take cologne on lumps of\nsugar or belladonna to make their eyes bright. Clara tried arsenic for\nher complexion, but her mother stopped it,\" said Fanny, betraying the\nsecrets of the prison-house in the basest manner.\n\n\"I knew you girls were a set of humbugs, and very pretty ones, too,\nsome of you, but I can't say I like to see you painted up like a lot of\nactresses,\" said Tom, with an air of disgust.\n\n\"I don't do anything of the sort, or need it, but Trix does; and having\nchosen her, you must abide your choice, for better or worse.\"\n\n\"It has n't come to that yet,\" muttered Tom, as he lay down again with a\nrebellious air.\n\nMaud's return put an end to these confidences, though Tom excited her\ncuriosity by asking the mysterious question, \"I say, Fan, is Polly up to\nthat sort of thing?\"\n\n\"No, she thinks it's awful. When she gets pale and dragged out she will\nprobably change her mind.\"\n\n\"I doubt it,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Polly says it is n't proper to talk secrets before people who ain't in\n'em,\" observed Maud, with dignity.\n\n\"Do, for mercy sake, stop talking about Polly, I'm sick to death of\nit,\" cried Fanny, snappishly.\n\n\"Hullo!\" and Tom sat up to take a survey. \"I thought you were bosom\nfriends, and as spoony as ever.\"\n\n\"Well, I am fond of Polly, but I get tired of hearing Maud sing her\npraises everlastingly. Now don't go and repeat that, chatterbox.\"\n\n\"My goodness, is n't she cross?\" whispered Maud to Tom.\n\n\"As two sticks; let her be. There's the bell; see who it is, Pug,\"\nanswered Tom, as a tingle broke the silence of the house.\n\nMaud went to peep over the banisters, and came flying back in a rapture.\n\n\"It's Will come for me! Can't I go? It don't snow hard, and I'll\nbundle up, and you can send for me when papa comes.\"\n\n\"I don't care what you do,\" answered Fan, who was in a very bad temper.\n\nWithout waiting for any other permission, Maud rushed away to get ready.\nWill would n't come up, he was so snowy, and Fanny was glad, because\nwith her he was bashful, awkward, and silent, so Tom went down and\nentertained him with Maud's report. They were very good friends, but led\nentirely different lives, Will being a \"dig,\" and Tom a \"bird,\" or,\nin plain English, one was a hard student, and the other a jolly young\ngentleman. Tom had rather patronized Will, who did n't like it, and\nshowed that he did n't by refusing to borrow money of him, or accept\nany of his invitations to join the clubs and societies to which Tom\nbelonged. So Shaw let Milton alone, and he got on very well in his own\nway, doggedly sticking to his books, and resisting all temptations\nbut those of certain libraries, athletic games, and such inexpensive\npleasures as were within his means; for this benighted youth had not yet\ndiscovered that college nowadays is a place in which to \"sky-lark,\" not\nto study.\n\nWhen Maud came down and trotted contentedly away, holding Will's\nhand, Tom watched them out of sight, and then strolled about the house\nwhistling and thinking, till he went to sleep in his father's arm-chair,\nfor want of something better to do. He awoke to the joys of a solitary\ntea, for his mother never came down, and Fanny shut herself and her\nheadache up in her own room.\n\n\"Well, this is cheerful,\" he said, as the clock struck eight, and his\nfourth cigar came to an end. \"Trix is mad, and Fan in the dumps, so I\n'll take myself off. Guess I'll go round to Polly's, and ask Will to\ndrive out with me, and save him the walk, poor chap. Might bring Midget\nhome, it will please her, and there's no knowing when the governor will\nbe back.\"\n\nWith these thoughts in his head, Tom leisurely got under way, and left\nhis horse at a neighboring stable, for he meant to make a little call,\nand see what it was Maud enjoyed so much.\n\n\"Polly is holding forth,\" he said to himself, as he went quietly up\nstairs, and the steady murmur of a pleasant voice came down to him. Tom\nlaughed at Polly's earnest way of talking when she was interested\nin anything. But he liked it because it was so different from the\ncoquettish clatter of most of the girls with whom he talked. Young men\noften laugh at the sensible girls whom they secretly respect, and\naffect to admire the silly ones whom they secretly despise, because\nearnestness, intelligence, and womanly dignity are not the fashion.\n\nThe door was ajar, and pausing in the dark entry Tom took a survey\nbefore he went in. The prospect was not dazzling, but home-like and\npleasant. The light of a bright fire filled the little room, and down\non a stool before it was Maud tending Puttel, and watching with deep\ninterest the roasting of an apple intended for her special benefit. On\nthe couch lounged Will, his thoughtful eyes fixed on Polly, who, while\nshe talked, smoothed the broad forehead of her \"yellow-haired laddie\"\nin a way that Tom thought an immense improvement on Maud's performance.\nThey had evidently been building castles in the air, for Polly was\nsaying in her most impressive manner, \"Well, whatever you do, Will,\ndon't have a great, costly church that takes so much money to build\nand support it that you have nothing to give away. I like the plain,\nold-fashioned churches, built for use, not show, where people met for\nhearty praying and preaching, and where everybody made their own music\ninstead of listening to opera singers, as we do now. I don't care if\nthe old churches were bare and cold, and the seats hard, there was real\npiety in them, and the sincerity of it was felt in the lives of the\npeople. I don't want a religion that I put away with my Sunday clothes,\nand don't take out till the day comes round again; I want something to\nsee and feel and live by day-by-day, and I hope you'll be one of the\ntrue ministers, who can teach by precept and example, how to get and\nkeep it.\"\n\n\"I hope I shall be, Polly, but you know they say that in families, if\nthere is a boy who can't do anything else, they make a minister of him.\nI sometimes think I ain't good for much, and that seems to me the reason\nwhy I should n't even try to be a minister,\" said Will, smiling, yet\nlooking as if with all his humility he did have faith in the aspirations\nthat came to him in his best moments.\n\n\"Some one said that very thing to father once, and I remember he\nanswered, 'I am glad to give my best and brightest son to the service of\nGod.'\"\n\n\"Did he say that?\" and Will's color rose, for the big, book-loving\nfellow was as sensitive as a girl to the praise of those dearest to him.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Polly, unconsciously giving the strongest stimulus to her\nbrother's hope and courage. \"Yes, and he added, 'I shall let my boys\nfollow the guide that is in them, and only ask of them to use their\ngifts conscientiously, and be honest, useful men.'\"\n\n\"So we will! Ned is doing well out West, and I'm hard at it here. If\nfather does his best to give us the chance we each want, the least we\ncan do is to work with a will.\"\n\n\"Whatever you do, you can't help working with a Will,\" cried Tom, who\nhad been so interested, that he forgot he was playing eavesdropper.\n\nPolly flew up, looking so pleased and surprised, that Tom reproached\nhimself for not having called oftener.\n\n\"I've come for Maud,\" he announced, in a paternal tone, which made that\nyoung lady open her eyes.\n\n\"I can't go till my apple is done; besides, it is n't nine yet, and Will\nis going to take me along, when he goes. I'd rather have him.\"\n\n\"I'm going to take you both in the cutter. The storm is over, but it is\nheavy walking, so you'll drive out with me, old man?\" said Tom, with a\nnod at Will.\n\n\"Of course he will; and thank you very much. I've been trying to keep\nhim all night; Miss Mills always manages to find a corner for stray\npeople, but he insists on going, so as to get to work early to-morrow,\"\nsaid Polly, delighted to see that Tom was taking off his coat, as if he\nmeant to wait for Maud's apple, which Polly blessed for being so slow to\ncook.\n\nPutting her guest into the best chair, Polly sat down and beamed at him\nwith such hospitable satisfaction, that Tom went up several pegs in his\nown estimation.\n\n\"You don't come very often, so we are rather over-powered when you do\nhonor us,\" she said, demurely.\n\n\"Well, you, know we fellows are so busy, we have n't much time to enjoy\nourselves,\" answered Tom.\n\n\"Ahem!\" said Will, loudly.\n\n\"Take a troche,\" said Tom.\n\nThen they both burst out laughing, and Polly, fully understanding\nthe joke, joined them, saying, \"Here are some peanuts, Tom; do enjoy\nyourself while you can.\"\n\n\"Now I call that a delicate compliment!\" And Tom, who had not lost his\nearly relish for this sort of refreshment, though he seldom indulged\nhis passion nowadays, because peanuts are considered vulgar, fell to\ncracking and munching with great satisfaction.\n\n\"Do you remember the first visit I made at your house, how you gave\nme peanuts, coming from the depot, and frightened me out of my wits,\npretending the coachman was tipsy?\" asked Polly.\n\n\"Of course I do, and how we coasted one day,\" answered Tom, laughing.\n\n\"Yes, and the velocipede; you've got the scar of that yet, I see.\"\n\n\"I remember how you stood by me while it was sewed up; that was very\nplucky, Polly.\"\n\n\"I was dreadfully afraid, but I remember I wanted to seem very brave,\nbecause you'd called me a coward.\"\n\n\"Did I? Ought to have been ashamed of myself. I used to rough you\nshamefully, Polly, and you were so good-natured, you let me do it.\"\n\n\"Could n't help myself,\" laughed Polly. \"I did use to think you were an\nawful boy, but seems to me I rather liked it.\"\n\n\"She had so much of it at home, she got used to it,\" put in Will,\npulling the little curl behind Polly's ear.\n\n\"You boys never teased me as Tom did, that's the reason it amused me, I\nsuppose; novelty hath charms, you know.\"\n\n\"Grandma used to lecture Tom for plaguing you, Polly, and he used to say\nhe'd be a tip-top boy, but he was n't,\" observed Maud, with a venerable\nair.\n\n\"Dear old grandma; she did her best, but I'm a bad lot,\" said Tom, with\na shake of the head and a sober face.\n\n\"It always seems as if she must be up in her rooms, and I can't get used\nto finding them empty,\" added Polly, softly.\n\n\"Father would n't have anything moved, and Tom sits up there sometimes;\nit makes him feel good, he says,\" said Maud, who had a talent for\nbetraying trifles which people preferred should not be mentioned in\npublic.\n\n\"You'd better hurry up your apple, for if it is n't done pretty soon,\nyou'll have to leave it, Pug,\" said Tom, looking annoyed.\n\n\"How is Fan?\" asked Polly, with tact.\n\n\"Well, Fan is rather under the weather; says she's dyspeptic, which\nmeans cross.\"\n\n\"She is cross, but she's sick too, for I found her crying one day, and\nshe said nobody cared about her, and she might as well be dead,\" added\nMaud, having turned her apple with tender care.\n\n\"We must try to cheer her up, among us. If I was n't so busy I'd like\nto devote myself to her, she has done so much for me,\" said Polly,\ngratefully.\n\n\"I wish you could. I can't understand her, for she acts like a\nweathercock, and I never know how I'm going to find her. I hate to have\nher mope so, but, upon my life, I don't know what to do,\" said Tom; but\nas he uttered the words, something was suggested by the sight before\nhim. Chairs were few, and Polly had taken half of Will's when they drew\nround the fire. Now she was leaning against him, in a cosy, confiding\nway, delightful to behold, while Will's strong arm went round her with\na protecting air, which said, as plainly as any words, that this big\nbrother and small sister knew how to love and help one another. It was a\npleasant little picture, all the pleasanter for its unconsciousness, and\nTom found it both suggestive and agreeable.\n\n\"Poor old Fan, she don't get much petting; maybe that's what she wants.\nI'll try it and see, for she stands by me like a trump. If she was\na rosy, cosy little woman, like Polly, it would come easier, though,\"\nthought Tom, as he meditatively ate his last nut, feeling that fraternal\naffection could not be very difficult of demonstration, to brothers\nblessed with pretty, good-tempered sisters.\n\n\"I told Tom about the bad fellow who blew up the professor, and he said\nhe knew him, slightly; and I was so relieved, because I had a kind of a\nfeeling that it was Tom himself, you and Will laughed so about it.\"\n\nMaud had a queer way of going on with her own thoughts, and suddenly\ncoming out with whatever lay uppermost, regardless of time, place, or\ncompany. As this remark fell from her, there was a general smile, and\nPolly said, with mock solemnity, \"It was a sad thing, and I've no doubt\nthat misguided young man is very sorry for it now.\"\n\n\"He looked perfectly bowed down with remorse last time I saw him,\" said\nWill, regarding Tom with eyes full of fun, for Will was a boy as well as\na bookworm, and relished a joke as well as scatter-brained Tom.\n\n\"He always is remorseful after a scrape, I've understood, for he is n't\na very bad fellow, only his spirits are one too many for him, and he is\nn't as fond of his book as another fellow I know.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid he'll he expelled if he don't mind,\" said Polly,\nwarningly.\n\n\"Should n't wonder if he was, he's such an unlucky dog,\" answered Tom,\nrather soberly.\n\n\"I hope he'll remember that his friends will be very much disappointed\nif he is. He might make them so proud and happy; that I guess he will,\nfor he is n't half as thoughtless as he makes himself out,\" said Polly,\nlooking across at Tom with such friendly eyes that he was quite touched,\nthough of course he did n't show it.\n\n\"Thank you, Polly; he may pull through, but I have my doubts. Now old\nman, let us'pud' along; it's getting late for the chicken,\" he added,\nrelapsing into the graceful diction with which a classical education\ngifts its fortunate possessor.\n\nTaking advantage of the moment while Will was wrestling with his boots\nin the closet, and Maud was absorbed in packing her apple into a large\nbasket, Polly said to Tom in a low tone, \"Thank you very much, for being\nso kind to Will.\"\n\n\"Bless your heart, I have n't done anything; he's such a proud fellow\nhe won't let me,\" answered Tom.\n\n\"But you do in many little ways; to-night, for example. Do you think\nI don't know that the suit of clothes he's just got would have cost a\ngood deal more, if your tailor had n't made them? He's only a boy,\nand don't understand things yet; but I know your way of helping proud\npeople; so that they don't find it out, and I do thank you, Tom, so\nmuch.\"\n\n\"Oh, come, Polly, that won't do. What do you know about tailors and\ncollege matters?\" said Tom, looking as much confused as if she had found\nhim out in something reprehensible.\n\n\"I don't know much, and that's the reason why I'm grateful for your\nkindness to Will. I don't care what stories they tell about you, I'm\nsure, you won't lead him into trouble, but keep him straight, for my\nsake. You know I've lost one brother, and Will takes Jimmy's place to\nme now.\"\n\nThe tears in Polly's eyes as she said that made Tom vow a tremendous vow\nwithin himself to stand by Will through thick and thin, and \"keep him\nstraight for Polly's sake\"; feeling all the time how ill-fitted he was\nfor such a task.\n\n\"I'll do my best,\" he said, heartily, as he pressed the hand Polly gave\nhim, with a look which assured her that he felt the appeal to his honor,\nand that henceforth the country lad was safe from all the temptations\nTom could have offered him.\n\n\"There! now I shall give that to mamma to take her pills in; it's\njust what she likes, and it pleases her to be thought of,\" said Maud,\nsurveying her gift with complacency, as she put on her things.\n\n\"You're a good little soul, to remember poor mum, said Tom, with an\napproving nod.\n\n\"Well, she was so pleased with the grapes you brought her, I thought I\n'd try something, and maybe she'd say 'Thank you, darling,' to me too.\nDo you think she will?\" whispered Maud, with the wistful look so often\nseen on her little plain face.\n\n\"See if she don't;\" and to Maud's great surprise Tom did n't laugh at\nher project.\n\n\"Good night, dear; take care of yourself, and keep your muffler round\nyour mouth going over the bridge, or you'll be as hoarse as a crow\nto-morrow,\" said Polly, as she kissed her brother, who returned it\nwithout looking as if he thought it \"girl's nonsense\" Then the three\npiled into the sleigh and drove off, leave Polly nodding on the\ndoorstep.\n\nMaud found the drive altogether too short, but was consoled by the\npromise of a longer one if the sleighing lasted till next Saturday: and\nwhen Tom ran up to bid his mother good-by, and give her a hint about\nMaud's gift, she stayed below to say, at the last minute, in unconscious\nimitation of Polly.\n\n\"Good night; take care of yourself, my dear.\"\n\nTom laughed, and was about to pinch the much enduring little nose; but,\nas if the words reminded him of something, he gave her a kiss instead, a\npiece of forbearance which almost took Maud's breath away with surprise\nand gratification.\n\nIt was rather a silent drive, for Will obediently kept his muffler up,\nand Tom fell into a brown study.\n\nHe was not much given to reflection, but occasionally indulged when\nsomething gave him a turn in that direction, and at such times he was as\nsober and sincere as could be desired. Any one might have lectured him\nfor an hour without doing as much good as that little call and the chat\nthat grew out of it, for, though nothing very wise or witty was\nsaid, many things were suggested, and every one knows that persuasive\ninfluences are better than any amount of moralizing. Neither Polly nor\nWill tried to do anything of the sort, and that was the charm of it.\nNobody likes to be talked to, but nobody can resist the eloquence of\nunconscious preaching. With all his thoughtlessness, Tom was quick to\nsee and feel these things, and was not spoilt enough yet to laugh at\nthem. The sight of Will and Polly's simple affection for one another\nreminded him of a neglected duty so pleasantly, that he could not forget\nit. Talking of early days made him wish he could go back and start\nagain, doing better. Grandma's name recalled the tender memory that\nalways did him good, and the thought that Polly trusted her dearest\nbrother to his care stirred up a manful desire to deserve the\nconfidence. Tortures would n't have drawn a word of all this from him,\nbut it had its effect, for boys don't leave their hearts and consciences\nbehind them when they enter college, and little things of this sort do\nmuch to keep both from being damaged by the four years' scrimmage which\nbegins the battle of life for most of them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. NEEDLES AND TONGUES\n\n\nDEAR POLLY, The Sewing Circle meets at our house this P. M. This is in\nyour line, so do come and help me through. I shall depend on you.\n\nYours ever, FAN.\n\n\"Bad news, my dear?\" asked Miss Mills, who had just handed the note to\nPolly as she came in one noon, a few weeks after Jenny's arrival.\n\nPolly told her what it was, adding, \"I suppose I ought to go and help\nFanny, but I can't say I want to. The girls talk about things I have\nnothing to do with, and I don't find their gossip very amusing. I'm an\noutsider, and they only accept me on Fan's account; so I sit in a corner\nand sew, while they chatter and laugh.\"\n\n\"Would n't it be a good chance to say a word for Jenny? She wants work,\nand these young ladies probably have quantities done somewhere. Jenny\ndoes fine work exquisitely, and begins to feel anxious to be earning\nsomething. I don't want her to feel dependent and unhappy, and a little\nwell-paid sewing would be all she needs to do nicely. I can get it for\nher by running round to my friends, but I really have n't the time, till\nI get the Mullers off. They are paupers here, but out West they can take\ncare of themselves, so I've begged the money to send them, and as soon\nas I can get them some clothes, off they go. That's the way to help\npeople help themselves,\" and Miss Mills clashed her big scissors\nenergetically, as she cut out a little red flannel shirt.\n\n\"I know it is, and I want to help, but I don't know where to begin,\"\nsaid Polly, feeling quite oppressed with the immensity of the work.\n\n\"We can't any of us do all we would like, but we can do our best for\nevery case that comes to us, and that helps amazingly. Begin with Jenny,\nmy dear; tell those girls about her, and if I'm not much mistaken, you\nwill find them ready to help, for half the time it is n't hardness of\nheart, but ignorance or thoughtlessness on the part of the rich, that\nmakes them seem so careless of the poor.\"\n\n\"To tell the truth, I'm afraid of being laughed at, if I try to talk\nseriously about such things to the girls,\" said Polly, frankly.\n\n\"You believe that'such things' are true? You are sincere in your wish\nto help better them, and you respect those who work for that end?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do.\"\n\n\"Then, my dear, can't you bear a little ridicule for the sake of a good\ncause? You said yesterday that you were going to make it a principle of\nyour life, to help up your sex as far and as fast as you could. It did\nmy heart good to hear you say it, for I was sure that in time you would\nkeep your word. But, Polly, a principle that can't bear being laughed\nat, frowned on, and cold-shouldered, is n't worthy of the name.\"\n\n\"I want to be strong-minded in the real sense of the word, but I don't\nlike to be called so by people who don't understand my meaning; and\nI shall be if I try to make the girls think soberly about anything\nsensible or philanthropic. They call me old-fashioned now, and I'd\nrather be thought that, though it is n't pleasant, than be set down as\na rampant woman's rights reformer,\" said Polly, in whose memory many\nlaughs, and snubs, and sarcasms still lingered, forgiven but not\nforgotten.\n\n\"This love and thought and care for those weaker, poorer, or worse than\nourselves, which we call Christian charity, is a very old fashion, my\ndear. It began eighteen hundred years ago, and only those who honestly\nfollow the beautiful example set us then, learn how to get genuine\nhappiness out of life. I'm not a'rampant woman's rights reformer,'\"\nadded Miss Mills, with a smile at Polly's sober face; \"but I think that\nwomen can do a great deal for each other, if they will only stop fearing\nwhat'people will think,' and take a hearty interest in whatever is\ngoing to fit their sisters and themselves to deserve and enjoy the\nrights God gave them. There are so many ways in which this can be done,\nthat I wonder they don't see and improve them. I don't ask you to go and\nmake speeches, only a few have the gift for that, but I do want every\ngirl and woman to feel this duty, and make any little sacrifice of time\nor feeling that may be asked of them, because there is so much to do,\nand no one can do it as well as ourselves, if we only think so.\"\n\n\"I'll try!\" said Polly, influenced more by her desire to keep Miss\nMills' good opinion than any love of self-sacrifice for her sex. It was\nrather a hard thing to ask of a shy, sensitive girl, and the kind old\nlady knew it, for in spite of the gray hair and withered face, her heart\nwas very young, and her own girlish trials not forgotten. But she\nknew also that Polly had more influence over others than she herself\nsuspected, simply because of her candid, upright nature; and that while\nshe tried to help others, she was serving herself in a way that would\nimprove heart and soul more than any mere social success she might gain\nby following the rules of fashionable life, which drill the character\nout of girls till they are as much alike as pins in a paper, and have\nabout as much true sense and sentiment in their little heads. There was\ngood stuff in Polly, unspoiled as yet, and Miss Mills was only acting\nout her principle of women helping each other. The wise old lady saw\nthat Polly had reached that point where the girl suddenly blooms into\na woman, asking something more substantial than pleasure to satisfy the\nnew aspirations that are born; a time as precious and important to the\nafter-life, as the hour when the apple blossoms fall, and the young\nfruit waits for the elements to ripen or destroy the harvest.\n\nPolly did not know this, and was fortunate in possessing a friend who\nknew what influences would serve her best, and who could give her what\nall women should desire to give each other, the example of a sweet, good\nlife, more eloquent and powerful than any words; for this is a right no\none can deny us.\n\nPolly turned the matter over in her mind as she dressed, while Jenny\nplayed waiting maid, little dreaming what this new friend was meaning to\ndo for her, if she dared.\n\n\"Is it going to be a tea-party, Miss?\" asked Jenny, as the black silk\nwent rustling on, to her great admiration, for she considered Polly a\nbeauty.\n\n\"Well, no, I think it will probably be a lecture,\" answered Polly,\nlaughing, for Jenny's grateful service and affectionate eyes confirmed\nthe purpose which Miss Mills' little homily had suggested.\n\nAs she entered the Shaws' parlor an hour or two later, an appalling\narray of well-dressed girls appeared, each provided with a dainty\nreticule, basket, or bag, and each tongue going a good deal faster than\nthe needle, while the white fingers stitched sleeves in upside down, put\nflannel jackets together hind part before, or gobbled button-holes with\nthe best intentions in life.\n\n\"You are a dear to come so early. Here's a nice place for you between\nBelle and Miss Perkins, and here's a sweet little dress to make, unless\nyou like something else better,\" said Fanny, receiving her friend with\nwarmth and placing her where she thought she would enjoy herself.\n\n\"Thank you, I'll take an unbleached cotton shirt if you have such a\nthing, for it is likely to be needed before a cambric frock,\" replied\nPolly, subsiding into her corner as quickly as possible, for at least six\neye-glasses were up, and she did n't enjoy being stared at.\n\nMiss Perkins, a grave, cold-looking young lady, with an aristocratic\nnose, bowed politely, and then went on with her work, which displayed\ntwo diamond rings to great advantage. Belle, being of the demonstrative\nsort, smiled and nodded, drew up her chair, and began a whispered\naccount of Trix's last quarrel with Tom. Polly listened with interest\nwhile she sewed diligently, occasionally permitting her eyes to study\nthe elegant intricacies of Miss Perkins' dress, for that young lady sat\nlike a statue, quirking her delicate fingers, and accomplishing about\ntwo stitches a minute.\n\nIn the midst of Belle's story, a more exciting bit of gossip caught her\near, and she plunged into the conversation going on across the table,\nleaving Polly free to listen and admire the wit, wisdom, and charitable\nspirit of the accomplished young ladies about her. There was a perfect\nBabel of tongues, but out of the confusion Polly gathered scraps of\nfashionable intelligence which somewhat lessened her respect for the\ndwellers in high places. One fair creature asserted that Joe Somebody\ntook so much champagne at the last German, that he had to be got away,\nand sent home with two servants. Another divulged the awful fact that\nCarrie P.'s wedding presents were half of them hired for the occasion.\nA third circulated a whisper to the effect that though Mrs. Buckminster\nwore a thousand-dollar cloak, her boys were not allowed but one sheet to\ntheir beds. And a fourth young gossip assured the company that a certain\nperson never had offered himself to a certain other person, though\nthe report was industriously spread by interested parties. This latter\nremark caused such a clamor that Fanny called the meeting to order in a\nmost unparliamentary fashion.\n\n\"Girls! girls! you really must talk less and sew more, or our society\nwill be disgraced. Do you know our branch sent in less work than any of\nthe others last month, and Mrs. Fitz George said, she did n't see how\nfifteen young ladies could manage to do so little?\"\n\n\"We don't talk a bit more than the old ladies do. I just wish you could\nhave heard them go on, last time. The way they get so much done, is,\nthey take work home, and make their seamstresses do it, and then they\ntake credit for vast industry,\" said Belle, who always spoke her mind\nwith charming candor.\n\n\"That reminds me that mamma says they want as many things as we can\nmake, for it's a hard winter, and the poor are suffering very much. Do\nany of you wish to take articles home, to do at odd times?\" said Fan,\nwho was president of this energetic Dorcas Society.\n\n\"Mercy, no! It takes all my leisure time to mend my gloves and refresh\nmy dresses,\" answered Belle.\n\n\"I think if we meet once a week, it is all that should be expected of\nus, with our other engagements. Poor people always complain that the\nwinter is a hard one, and never are satisfied,\" remarked Miss Perkins,\nmaking her diamonds sparkle as she sewed buttons on the wrong side of a\npink calico apron, which would hardly survive one washing.\n\n\"Nobody can ask me to do any more, if they remember all I've got to\nattend to before summer,\" said Trix, with an important air. \"I've got\nthree women hard at work, and want another, but everyone is so busy, and\nask such abominable prices, that I'm in despair, and shall have to take\nhold myself, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"There's a chance for Jane,\" thought Polly, but had n't courage \"to\nspeak out loud in meeting,\" just then, and resolved to ask Trix for\nwork, in private.\n\n\"Prices are high, but you forget how much more it costs to live now than\nit used to do. Mamma never allows us to beat down workwomen, but wishes\nus to pay them well, and economize in some other way, if we must,\" said\nEmma Davenport, a quiet, bright-eyed girl, who was called \"odd\" among\nthe young ladies, because she dressed simply, when her father was a\nmillionaire.\n\n\"Just hear that girl talk about economy! I beg your pardon, she's some\nrelation of yours, I believe!\" said Belle, in a low tone.\n\n\"Very distant; but I'm proud of it; for with her, economy does n't mean\nscrimping in one place to make a show in another. If every one would\nfollow the Davenports' example, workwomen would n't starve, or servants\nbe such a trouble. Emma is the plainest dressed girl in the room, next\nto me, yet any one can see she is a true gentlewoman,\" said Polly,\nwarmly.\n\n\"And you are another,\" answered Belle, who had always loved Polly, in\nher scatter-brained way.\n\n\"Hush! Trix has the floor.\"\n\n\"If they spent their wages properly, I should n't mind so much, but they\nthink they must be as fine as anybody, and dress so well that it is hard\nto tell mistress from maid. Why our cook got a bonnet just like mine\n(the materials were cheaper, but the effect was the same), and had the\nimpertinence to wear it before my face. I forbid it, and she left, of\ncourse, which made papa so cross he would n't give me the camel's hair\nshawl he promised this year.\"\n\n\"It's perfectly shameful!\" said Miss Perkins, as Trix paused out of\nbreath. \"Servants ought to be made to dress like servants, as they do\nabroad; then we should have no more trouble,\" observed Miss Perkins, who\nhad just made the grand tour, and had brought home a French maid.\n\n\"Perky don't practise as she preaches,\" whispered Belle to Polly, as\nMiss P. became absorbed in the chat of her other neighbors. \"She pays\nher chamber girl with old finery; and the other day, when Betsey was out\nparading in her missis's cast-off purple plush suit, Mr. Curtis thought\nshe was mademoiselle, and bowed to her. He is as blind as a bat, but\nrecognized the dress, and pulled off his hat to it in the most elegant\nstyle. Perky adores him, and was mad enough to beat Betsey when she told\nthe story and giggled over it. Betsey is quite as stylish and ever so\nmuch prettier than Perky, and she knows it, which is an aggravation.\"\n\nPolly could n't help laughing, but grew sober a minute after, as Trix\nsaid, pettishly, \"Well, I'm sick of hearing about beggars; I believe\nhalf of them are humbugs, and if we let them alone they'd go to work\nand take care of themselves. There's altogether too much fuss made\nabout charity. I do wish we could be left in peace.\"\n\n\"There can't be too much charity!\" burst out Polly, forgetting her\nshyness all at once.\n\n\"Oh, indeed! Well, I take the liberty to differ from you,\" returned\nTrix, putting up her glass, and bestowing upon Polly her most\n\"toploftical stare,\" as the girls called it.\n\nI regret to say that Polly never could talk with or be near Trix without\nfeeling irritated and combative. She tried to conquer this feeling, but\nshe could n't, and when Trix put on airs, Polly felt an intense desire\nto box her ears. That eye-glass was her especial aversion, for Trix was\nno more near-sighted than herself, but pretended to be because it was\nthe fashion, and at times used the innocent glass as a weapon with which\nto put down any one who presumed to set themselves up. The supercilious\nglance which accompanied her ironically polite speech roused Polly,\nwho answered with sudden color and the kindling of the eyes that always\nbetrayed a perturbed spirit, \"I don't think many of us would enjoy that\nselfish sort of peace, while little children starve, and girls no older\nthan us kill themselves because their dreadful poverty leaves them no\nchoice but sin or death.\"\n\nA sudden lull took place, for, though Polly, did not raise her voice, it\nwas full of indignant emotion, and the most frivolous girl there felt\na little thrill of sympathy; for the most utterly fashionable life does\nnot kill the heart out of women, till years of selfish pleasure have\npassed over their heads. Trix was ashamed of herself; but she felt the\nsame antagonism toward Polly, that Polly did toward her; and, being less\ngenerous, took satisfaction in plaguing her. Polly did not know that the\nsecret of this was the fact that Tom often held her up as a model for\nhis fiance to follow, which caused that young lady to dislike her more\nthan ever.\n\n\"Half the awful stories in the papers are made up for a sensation, and\nit's absurd to believe them, unless one likes to be harrowed up. I\ndon't; and as for peace, I'm not likely to get much, while I have Tom\nto look after,\" said Trix, with an aggravating laugh.\n\nPolly's needle snapped in two, but she did not mind it, as she said,\nwith a look that silenced even sharp-tongued Trix, \"I can't help\nbelieving what my own eyes and ears have seen and heard. You lead such\nsafe and happy lives, you can't imagine the misery that is all round\nyou; but if you could get a glimpse of it, it would make your hearts\nache, as it has mine.\"\n\n\"Do you suffer from heartache? Some one hinted as much to me, but you\nlooked so well, I could n't believe it.\"\n\nNow that was cruel in Trix, more cruel than any one guessed; but girls'\ntongues can deal wounds as sharp and sudden as the slender stiletto\nSpanish women wear in their hair, and Polly turned pale, as those words\nstabbed her. Belle saw it, and rushed to the rescue with more good-will\nthan wisdom.\n\n\"Nobody ever accused you of having any heart to ache with. Polly and\nI are not old enough yet to get tough and cool, and we are still silly\nenough to pity unhappy people, Tom Shaw especially,\" added Belle, under\nher breath.\n\nThat was a two-edged thrust, for Trix was decidedly an old girl, and Tom\nwas generally regarded as a hapless victim. Trix turned red; but before\nshe could load and fire again, Emma Davenport, who labored under the\ndelusion that this sort of skirmishing was ill-natured, and therefore\nill-bred, spoke up in her pleasant way, \"Speaking of pitying the poor,\nI always wonder why it is that we all like to read and cry over their\ntroubles in books, but when we have the real thing before us, we think\nit is uninteresting and disagreeable.\"\n\n\"It's the genius that gets into the books, which makes us like the\npoverty, I fancy. But I don't quite agree that the real thing is n't\ninteresting. I think it would be, if we knew how to look at and feel\nit,\" said Polly, very quietly, as she pushed her chair out of the arctic\ncircle of Miss Perkins, into the temperate one of friendly Emma.\n\n\"But how shall we learn that? I don't see what we girls can do, more\nthan we do now. We have n't much money for such things, should n't know\nhow to use it if we had; and it is n't proper for us to go poking into\ndirty places, to hunt up the needy. 'Going about doing good, in pony\nphaetons,' as somebody says, may succeed in England, but it won't work\nhere,\" said Fanny, who had begun, lately, to think a good deal of some\none beside herself, and so found her interest in her fellow-beings\nincreasing daily.\n\n\"We can't do much, perhaps, just yet; but still there are things left\nundone that naturally fall to us. I know a house,\" said Polly, sewing\nbusily as she talked, \"where every servant who enters it becomes an\nobject of interest to the mistress and her daughters. These women are\ntaught good habits, books are put where they can get them, sensible\namusements are planned for them sometimes, and they soon feel that they\nare not considered mere scrubs, to do as much work as possible, for as\nlittle money as possible, but helpers in the family, who are loved and\nrespected in proportion to their faithfulness. This lady feels her duty\nto them, owns it, and does it, as conscientiously as she wants them to\ndo theirs by her; and that is the way it ought to be, I think.\"\n\nAs Polly paused, several keen eyes discovered that Emma's cheeks were\nvery red, and saw a smile lurking in the corners of the mouth that tried\nto look demure, which told them who Polly meant.\n\n\"Do the Biddies all turn out saints in that well regulated family?\"\nasked the irrepressible Trix.\n\n\"No; few of us do that, even in the parlor; but every one of the Biddies\nis better for being there, whether they are grateful or not. I ought not\nto have mentioned this, perhaps, but I wanted to show you one thing that\nwe girls can do. We all complain about bad servants, most as much as if\nwe were house-keepers ourselves; but it never occurs to us to try and\nmend the matter, by getting up a better spirit between mistress and\nmaid. Then there's another thing we can do,\" added Polly, warming up.\n\"Most of us find money enough for our little vanities and pleasures, but\nfeel dreadfully poor when we come to pay for work, sewing especially.\nCould n't we give up a few of the vanities, and pay the seamstresses\nbetter?\"\n\n\"I declare I will!\" cried Belle, whose conscience suddenly woke, and\nsmote her for beating down the woman who did her plain sewing, in order\nthat she might have an extra flounce on a new dress. \"Belle has got a\nvirtuous fit; pity it won't last a week,\" said Trix.\n\n\"Wait and see,\" retorted Belle, resolving that it should last, just\nto disappoint \"that spiteful minx;\" as she sweetly called her old\nschool-mate.\n\n\"Now we shall behold Belle galloping away at a great pace, on her new\nhobby. I should n't be surprised to hear of her preaching in the jail,\nadopting a nice dirty little orphan, or passing round tracts at a\nWoman's Rights meeting,\" said Trix, who never could forgive Belle for\nhaving a lovely complexion, and so much hair of her own that she never\npatronized either rats, mice, waterfalls, switches, or puff-combs.\n\n\"Well, I might do worse; and I think, of the two, I'd rather amuse\nmyself so, than as some young ladies do, who get into the papers for\ntheir pranks,\" returned Belle, with a moral air.\n\n\"Suppose we have a little recess, and rest while Polly plays to us. Will\nyou, Polly? It will do us good; they all want to hear you, and begged I\n'd ask.\"\n\n\"Then I will, with pleasure\"; and Polly went to the piano with such\nobliging readiness, that several reproachful glances fell upon Trix, who\ndid n't need her glass to see them.\n\nPolly was never too sad, perturbed, or lazy to sing, for it was almost\nas easy to her as breathing, and seemed the most natural outlet for her\nemotions. For a minute her hands wandered over the keys, as if uncertain\nwhat to play; then, falling into a sad, sweet strain, she sang \"The\nBridge of Sighs.\" Polly did n't know why she chose it, but the instinct\nseemed to have been a true one, for, old as the song was, it went\nstraight to the hearts of the hearers, and Polly sung it better than\nshe ever had before, for now the memory of little Jane lent it a tender\npathos which no art could give. It did them all good, for music is a\nbeautiful magician, and few can resist its power. The girls were touched\nby the appeal; Polly was lifted out of herself, and when she turned\nround, the softened look on all the faces told her that for the moment\nfoolish differences and frivolous beliefs were forgotten in the\none womanly sentiment of pity for the wrongs and woes of which the\nlisteners' happy lives were ignorant.\n\n\"That song always makes me cry, and feel as if I had no right to be so\ncomfortable,\" said Belle, openly wiping her eyes on a crash towel.\n\n\"Fortunately such cases are very rare,\" said another young lady, who\nseldom read the newspapers.\n\n\"I wish they were, but I'm afraid they are not; for only three weeks\nago, I saw a girl younger than any of us, and no worse, who tried to\ndestroy herself simply because she was so discouraged, sick, and poor,\"\nsaid Polly.\n\n\"Do tell about her,\" cried Belle, eagerly.\n\nFeeling that the song had paved the way for the story, and given her\ncourage to tell it, Polly did tell it, and must have done it well, for\nthe girls stopped work to listen, and when she ended, other eyes beside\nwarm-hearted Belle's were wet. Trix looked quite subdued; Miss Perkins\nthawed to such a degree, that something glittered on her hand as she\nbent over the pink pinafore again, better and brighter than her biggest\ndiamond; Emma got up and went to Polly with a face full of affectionate\nrespect, while Fanny, moved by a sudden impulse, caught up a costly\nSevres plate that stood on the etagere, and laying a five-dollar bill in\nit, passed it round, quoting Polly's words, \"Girls, I know you'll like\nto help poor little Jenny'begin again, and do better this time.'\"\n\nIt was good to see how quickly the pretty purses were out, how\ngenerously each gave of its abundance, and what hearty applause broke\nfrom the girls, as Belle laid down her gold thimble, saying with an\nApril face, \"There, take that; I never have any money, somehow it won't\nstay with me, but I can't let the plate pass me this time.\"\n\nWhen Fanny brought the contributions to Polly, she just gathered it up\nin her two hands with such a glad, grateful face, the girls wished they\nhad had more to give.\n\n\"I can't thank you enough,\" she said, with an eloquent little choke in\nher voice. \"This will help Jenny very much; but the way in which it was\ndone will do her more good than double the money, because it will prove\nto her that she is n't without friends, and make her feel that there is\na place in the world for her. Let her work for you in return for this;\nshe don't ask alms, she only wants employment and a little kindness, and\nthe best charity we can bestow is to see that she has both.\"\n\n\"I'll give her as much sewing as she wants, and she can stay at our\nhouse while she does it, if she needs a home,\" said Trix, in a spasm of\nbenevolence.\n\n\"She does n't need a home, thank you; Miss Mills has given half of hers,\nand considers Jane her child,\" answered Polly, with proud satisfaction\nin the fact.\n\n\"What an old dear!\" cried Belle.\n\n\"I want to know her. May I?\" whispered Emma.\n\n\"Oh, yes; I'm glad to make her known to any one. She is a quiet little\nold lady, but she does one heaps of good, and shows you how to be\ncharitable in the wisest way.\"\n\n\"Do tell us about it. I'm sure I want to do my duty, but it's such a\nmuddle, I don't know how,\" said Belle.\n\nThen, quite naturally, the conversation fell upon the great work that\nnone should be too busy to think of, and which few are too young or\ntoo poor to help on with their mite. The faces grew more earnest, the\nfingers flew faster, as the quick young hearts and brains took in the\nnew facts, ideas, and plans that grew out of the true stories, the\nsensible hints, the successful efforts which Polly told them, fresh from\nthe lips of Miss Mills; for, of late, Polly had talked much with the\ngood lady, and learned quickly the lessons her unselfish life conveyed.\nThe girls found this more interesting than gossip, partly owing to its\nnovelty, doubtless; but the enthusiasm was sincere while it lasted, and\ndid them good. Many of them forgot all about it in a week, but Polly's\neffort was not lost, for Emma, Belle, and Fanny remained firm friends\nto Jane, so kindly helping her that the poor child felt as if she had\nindeed been born again, into a new and happy world.\n\nNot till long afterward did Polly see how much good this little effort\nhad done her, for the first small sacrifice of this sort leads the way\nto others, and a single hand's turn given heartily to the world's great\nwork helps one amazingly with one's own small tasks. Polly found this\nout as her life slowly grew easier and brighter, and the beautiful law\nof compensation gave her better purposes and pleasures than any she had\nlost. The parents of some of her pupils were persons of real refinement,\nand such are always quick to perceive the marks of culture in others, no\nmatter where they find them. These, attracted first by Polly's cheerful\nface, modest manners, and faithful work, soon found in her something\nmore than a good teacher; they found a real talent for music, an eager\ndesire for helpful opportunities, and a heart grateful for the kindly\nsympathy that makes rough places smooth. Fortunately those who have the\nskill to detect these traits also possess the spirit to appreciate and\noften the power to serve and develop them. In ways so delicate that the\nmost sensitive pride could not resent the favor, these true gentlefolk\nshowed Polly their respect and regard, put many pleasures in her way,\nand when they paid her for her work, gave her also the hearty thanks\nthat takes away all sense of degradation even from the humblest service,\nfor money so earned and paid sweetens the daily bread it buys, and makes\nthe mutual obligation a mutual benefit and pleasure.\n\nA few such patrons did much for Polly, and the music she gave them had\nan undertone of gratitude that left blithe echoes in those great houses,\nwhich money could not buy.\n\nThen, as her butterfly acquaintances deserted her, she found her way\ninto a hive of friendly bees, who welcomed her, and showed her how to\nfind the honey that keeps life sweet and wholesome. Through Miss Mills,\nwho was the counsellor and comforter of several, Polly came to know\na little sisterhood of busy, happy, independent girls, who each had a\npurpose to execute, a talent to develop, an ambition to achieve, and\nbrought to the work patience and perseverance, hope and courage. Here\nPolly found her place at once, for in this little world love and liberty\nprevailed; talent, energy, and character took the first rank; money,\nfashion, and position were literally nowhere; for here, as in the big\nworld outside, genius seemed to blossom best when poverty was head\ngardener. Young teachers, doing much work for little pay; young artists,\ntrying to pencil, paint, or carve their way to Rome; young writers,\nburning to distinguish themselves; young singers, dreaming of\ntriumphs, great as those of Jenny Lind; and some who tried to conquer\nindependence, armed only with a needle, like poor Jane. All these helped\nPolly as unconsciously as she helped them, for purpose and principle are\nthe best teachers we can have, and the want of them makes half the women\nof America what they are, restless, aimless, frivolous, and sick.\n\nTo outsiders that was a very hard-working and uneventful winter to\nPolly. She thought so herself; but as spring came on, the seed of new\nvirtues, planted in the winter time, and ripened by the sunshine of\nendeavor, began to bud in Polly's nature, betraying their presence to\nothers by the added strength and sweetness of her character, long before\nshe herself discovered these May flowers that had blossomed for her\nunderneath the snow.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. FORBIDDEN FRUIT\n\n\n\"I'M perfectly aching for some fun,\" said Polly to herself as she\nopened her window one morning and the sunshine and frosty air set her\nblood dancing and her eyes sparkling with youth, health, and overflowing\nspirits. \"I really must break out somewhere and have a good time. It's\nquite impossible to keep steady any longer. Now what will I do?\" Polly\nsprinkled crumbs to the doves, who came daily to be fed, and while she\nwatched the gleaming necks and rosy feet, she racked her brain to devise\nsome unusually delightful way of enjoying herself, for she really had\nbottled up her spirits so long, they were in a state of uncontrollable\neffervescence.\n\n\"I'll go to the opera,\" she suddenly announced to the doves. \"It's\nexpensive, I know, but it's remarkably good, and music is such a treat\nto me. Yes, I'll get two tickets as cheap as I can, send a note to\nWill, poor lad, he needs fun as much as I do, and we'll go and have a\nnice time in some corner, as Charles Lamb and his sister used to.\"\n\nWith that Polly slammed down the window, to the dismay of her gentle\nlittle pensioners, and began to fly about with great energy, singing and\ntalking to herself as if it was impossible to keep quiet. She started\nearly to her first lesson that she might have time to buy the tickets,\nhoping, as she put a five-dollar bill into her purse, that they would\nn't be very high, for she felt that she was not in a mood to resist\ntemptation. But she was spared any struggle, for when she reached the\nplace, the ticket office was blocked up by eager purchasers and the\ndisappointed faces that turned away told Polly there was no hope for\nher.\n\n\"Well, I don't care, I'll go somewhere, for I will have my fun,\" she\nsaid with great determination, for disappointment only seemed to whet\nher appetite. But the playbills showed her nothing inviting and she was\nforced to go away to her work with the money burning her pocket and all\nmanner of wild schemes floating in her head. At noon, instead of going\nhome to dinner, she went and took an ice, trying to feet very gay and\nfestive all by herself. It was rather a failure, however, and after a\ntour of the picture shops she went to give Maud a lesson, feeling that\nit was very hard to quench her longings, and subside into a prim little\nmusic teacher.\n\nFortunately she did not have to do violence to her feelings very long,\nfor the first thing Fanny said to her was: \"Can you go?\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Did n't you get my note?\"\n\n\"I did n't go home to dinner.\"\n\n\"Tom wants us to go to the opera to-night and\" Fan got no further, for\nPolly uttered a cry of rapture and clasped her hands.\n\n\"Go? Of course I will. I've been dying to go all day, tried to get\ntickets this morning and could n't, been fuming about it ever since, and\nnow oh, how splendid!\" And Polly could not restrain an ecstatic skip,\nfor this burst of joy rather upset her.\n\n\"Well, you come to tea, and we'll dress together, and go all\ncomfortable with Tom, who is in a heavenly frame of mind to-day.\"\n\n\"I must run home and get my things,\" said Polly, resolving on the spot\nto buy the nicest pair of gloves the city afforded.\n\n\"You shall have my white cloak and any other little rigging you want.\nTommy likes to have his ladies a credit to him, you know,\" said Fanny,\ndeparting to take a beauty sleep.\n\nPolly instantly decided that she would n't borrow Becky's best bonnet,\nas she at first intended, but get a new one, for in her present excited\nstate, no extravagance seemed too prodigal in honor of this grand\noccasion. I am afraid that Maud's lesson was not as thorough as it\nshould have been, for Polly's head was such a chaos of bonnets, gloves,\nopera-cloaks and fans, that Maud blundered through, murdering time and\ntune at her own sweet will. The instant it was over Polly rushed away\nand bought not only the kids but a bonnet frame, a bit of illusion, and\na pink crape rose, which had tempted her for weeks in a certain\nshop window, then home and to work with all the skill and speed of a\ndistracted milliner.\n\n\"I'm rushing madly into expense, I'm afraid, but the fit is on me\nand I'll eat bread and water for a week to make up for it. I must look\nnice, for Tom seldom takes me and ought to be gratified when he does.\nI want to do like other girls, just for once, and enjoy myself without\nthinking about right and wrong. Now a bit of pink ribbon to tie it with,\nand I shall be done in time to do up my best collar,\" she said, turning\nher boxes topsy-turvy for the necessary ribbon in that delightful flurry\nwhich young ladies feel on such occasions.\n\nIt is my private opinion that the little shifts and struggles we poor\ngirls have to undergo beforehand give a peculiar relish to our fun when\nwe get it. This fact will account for the rapturous mood in which Polly\nfound herself when, after making her bonnet, washing and ironing her\nbest set, blacking her boots and mending her fan, she at last, like\nConsuelo, \"put on a little dress of black silk\" and, with the smaller\nadornments pinned up in a paper, started for the Shaws', finding it\ndifficult to walk decorously when her heart was dancing in her bosom.\n\nMaud happened to be playing a redowa up in the parlor, and Polly came\nprancing into the room so evidently spoiling for a dance that Tom, who\nwas there, found it impossible to resist catching her about the waist,\nand putting her through the most intricate evolutions till Maud's\nfingers gave out.\n\n\"That was splendid! Oh, Tom, thank you so much for asking me to-night.\nI feel just like having a regular good time,\" cried Polly, when she\nstopped, with her hat hanging round her neck and her hair looking as if\nshe had been out in a high wind.\n\n\"Glad of it. I felt so myself and thought we'd have a jolly little\nparty all in the family,\" said Tom, looking much gratified at her\ndelight.\n\n\"Is Trix sick?\" asked Polly.\n\n\"Gone to New York for a week.\"\n\n\"Ah, when the cat's away the mice will play.\"\n\n\"Exactly. Come and have another turn.\"\n\nBefore they could start, however, the awful spectacle of a little dog\ntrotting out of the room with a paper parcel in his mouth, made Polly\nclasp her hands with the despairing cry: \"My bonnet! Oh, my bonnet!\"\n\n\"Where? what? which?\" And Tom looked about him, bewildered.\n\n\"Snip's got it. Save it! save it!\"\n\n\"I will!\" And Tom gave chase with more vigor than discretion.\n\nSnip, evidently regarding it as a game got up for his special benefit,\nenjoyed the race immensely and scampered all over the house, shaking the\nprecious parcel like a rat while his master ran and whistled, commanded\nand coaxed, in vain. Polly followed, consumed with anxiety, and Maud\nlaughed till Mrs. Shaw sent down to know who was in hysterics. A\npiteous yelp from the lower regions at last announced that the thief was\ncaptured, and Tom appeared bearing Snip by the nape of the neck in one\nhand and Polly's cherished bonnet in the other.\n\n\"The little scamp was just going to worry it when I grabbed him. I'm\nafraid he has eaten one of your gloves. I can't find it, and this one\nis pretty well chewed up,\" said Tom, bereaving Snip of the torn kid, to\nwhich he still pertinaciously clung.\n\n\"Serves me right,\" said Polly with a groan. \"I'd no business to get\na new pair, but I wanted to be extra gorgeous to-night, and this is my\npunishment for such mad extravagance.\"\n\n\"Was there anything else?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Only my best cuffs and collar. You'll probably find them in the\ncoal-bin,\" said Polly, with the calmness of despair.\n\n\"I saw some little white things on the dining-room floor as I raced\nthrough. Go get them, Maud, and we'll repair damages,\" said Tom,\nshutting the culprit into the boot closet, where he placidly rolled\nhimself up and went to sleep.\n\n\"They ain't hurt a bit,\" proclaimed Maud, restoring the lost treasures.\n\n\"Neither is my bonnet, for which I'm deeply grateful,\" said Polly, who\nhad been examining it with a solicitude which made Tom's eyes twinkle.\n\n\"So am I, for it strikes me that is an uncommonly'nobby' little\naffair,\" he said approvingly. Tom had a weakness for pale pink roses,\nand perhaps Polly knew it.\n\n\"I'm afraid it's too gay,\" said Polly, with a dubious look.\n\n\"Not a bit. Sort of bridal, you know. Must be becoming. Put it on and\nlet's see.\"\n\n\"I would n't for the world, with my hair all tumbling down. Don't look\nat me till I'm respectable, and don't tell any one how I've been\nacting. I think I must be a little crazy to-night,\" said Polly,\ngathering up her rescued finery and preparing to go and find Fan.\n\n\"Lunacy is mighty becoming, Polly. Try it again,\" answered Tom,\nwatching her as she went laughing away, looking all the prettier for\nher dishevelment. \"Dress that girl up, and she'd be a raving, tearing\nbeauty,\" added Tom to Maud in a lower tone as he look her into the\nparlor under his arm.\n\nPolly heard it and instantly resolved to be as \"raving and as tearing\"\nas her means would allow, \"just for one night,\" she said as she peeped\nover the banisters, glad to see that the dance and the race had taken\nthe \"band-boxy\" air out of Tom's elegant array.\n\nI deeply regret being obliged to shock the eyes and ears of such of my\nreaders as have a prejudice in favor of pure English by expressions like\nthe above, but, having rashly undertaken to write a little story about\nYoung America, for Young America, I feel bound to depict my honored\npatrons as faithfully as my limited powers permit. Otherwise, I must\nexpect the crushing criticism, \"Well, I dare say it's all very prim and\nproper, but it is n't a bit like us,\" and never hope to arrive at\nthe distinction of finding the covers of \"An Old-Fashioned Girl\" the\ndirtiest in the library.\n\nThe friends had a social \"cup o' tea\" upstairs, which Polly considered\nthe height of luxury, and then each took a mirror and proceeded to prink\nto her heart's content. The earnestness with which Polly made her toilet\nthat night was delightful to behold. Feeling in a daring mood, she\nreleased her pretty hair from the braids in which she usually wore\nit and permitted the curls to display themselves in all their brown\nabundance, especially several dangerous little ones about the temples\nand forehead. The putting on of the rescued collar and cuffs was a task\nwhich absorbed her whole mind. So was the settling of a minute bit of\ncourt-plaster just to the left of the dimple in her chin, an unusual\npiece of coquetry in which Polly would not have indulged, if an almost\ninvisible scratch had not given her an excuse for doing it. The white,\ndown-trimmed cloak, with certain imposing ornaments on the hood,\nwas assumed with becoming gravity and draped with much advancing and\nretreating before the glass, as its wearer practised the true Boston\ngait, elbows back, shoulders forward, a bend and a slide, occasionally\nvaried by a slight skip. But when that bonnet went on, Polly actually\nheld her breath till it was safely landed and the pink rose bloomed\nabove the smooth waves of hair with what Fanny called \"a ravishing\neffect.\" At this successful stage of affairs Polly found it impossible\nto resist the loan of a pair of gold bands for the wrists and Fanny's\nwhite fan with the little mirror in the middle.\n\n\"I can put them in my pocket if I feel too much dressed,\" said Polly\nas she snapped on the bracelets, but after a wave or two of the fan she\nfelt that it would be impossible to take them off till the evening was\nover, so enticing was their glitter.\n\nFanny also lent her a pair of three-button gloves, which completed her\ncontent, and when Tom greeted her with an approving, \"Here's a sight\nfor gods and men! Why, Polly, you're gorgeous!\" she felt that her \"fun\"\nhad decidedly begun.\n\n\"Would n't Polly make a lovely bride?\" said Maud, who was revolving\nabout the two girls, trying to decide whether she would have a blue or a\nwhite cloak when she grew up and went to operas.\n\n\"Faith, and she would! Allow me to congratulate you, Mrs. Sydney,\"\nadded Tom, advancing with his wedding-reception bow and a wicked look at\nFanny.\n\n\"Go away! How dare you?\" cried Polly, growing much redder than her rose.\n\n\"If we are going to the opera to-night, perhaps we'd better start,\nas the carriage has been waiting some time,\" observed Fan coolly, and\nsailed out of the room in an unusually lofty manner.\n\n\"Don't you like it, Polly?\" whispered Tom, as they went down stairs\ntogether.\n\n\"Very much.\"\n\n\"The deuce you do!\"\n\n\"I'm so fond of music, how can I help it?\n\n\"I'm talking about Syd.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not.\"\n\n\"You'd better try for him.\"\n\n\"I'll think of it.\"\n\n\"Oh, Polly, Polly, what are you coming to?\"\n\n\"A tumble into the street, apparently,\" answered Polly as she slipped a\nlittle on the step, and Tom stopped in the middle of his laugh to pilot\nher safely into the carriage, where Fanny was already seated.\n\n\"Here's richness!\" said Polly to herself as she rolled away, feeling\nas Cinderella probably did when the pumpkin-coach bore her to the first\nball, only Polly had two princes to think about, and poor Cinderella,\non that occasion, had not even one. Fanny did n't seem inclined to talk\nmuch, and Tom would go on in such a ridiculous manner that Polly told\nhim she would n't listen and began to hum bits of the opera. But\nshe heard every word, nevertheless, and resolved to pay him for his\nimpertinence as soon as possible by showing him what he had lost.\n\nTheir seats were in the balcony, and hardly were they settled, when, by\none of those remarkable coincidences which are continually occurring\nin our youth, Mr. Sydney and Fanny's old friend Frank Moore took their\nplaces just behind them.\n\n\"Oh, you villain! You did it on purpose,\" whispered Polly as she turned\nfrom greeting their neighbors and saw a droll look on Tom's face.\n\n\"I give you my word I did n't. It's the law of attraction, don't you\nsee?\"\n\n\"If Fan likes it, I don't care.\"\n\n\"She looks resigned, I think.\"\n\nShe certainly did, for she was talking and laughing in the gayest manner\nwith Frank while Sydney was covertly surveying Polly as if he did n't\nquite understand how the gray grub got so suddenly transformed into\na white butterfly. It is a well-known fact that dress plays a very\nimportant part in the lives of most women and even the most sensible\ncannot help owning sometimes how much happiness they owe to a becoming\ngown, gracefully arranged hair, or a bonnet which brings out the best\npoints in their faces and puts them in a good humor. A great man was\nonce heard to say that what first attracted him to his well-beloved wife\nwas seeing her in a white muslin dress with a blue shawl on the chair\nbehind her. The dress caught his eye, and, stopping to admire that, the\nwearer's intelligent conversation interested his mind, and in time, the\nwoman's sweetness won his heart. It is not the finest dress which does\nthe most execution, I fancy, but that which best interprets individual\ntaste and character. Wise people understand this, and everybody is more\ninfluenced by it than they know, perhaps. Polly was not very wise, but\nshe felt that every one about her found something more attractive than\nusual in her and modestly attributed Tom's devotion, Sydney's interest,\nand Frank's undisguised admiration, to the new bonnet or, more likely,\nto that delightful combination of cashmere, silk, and swan's-down,\nwhich, like Charity's mantle, seemed to cover a multitude of sins in\nother people's eyes and exalt the little music teacher to the rank of a\nyoung lady.\n\nPolly scoffed at this sort of thing sometimes, but to-night she accepted\nit without a murmur rather enjoyed it in fact, let her bracelets shine\nbefore the eyes of all men, and felt that it was good to seem comely in\ntheir sight. She forgot one thing, however: that her own happy spirits\ngave the crowning charm to a picture which every one liked to see a\nblithe young girl enjoying herself with all her heart. The music and the\nlight, costume and company, excited Polly and made many things possible\nwhich at most times she would never have thought of saying or doing. She\ndid not mean to flirt, but somehow \"it flirted itself\" and she could n't\nhelp it, for, once started, it was hard to stop, with Tom goading\nher on, and Sydney looking at her with that new interest in his eyes.\nPolly's flirting was such a very mild imitation of the fashionable thing\nthat Trix & Co. would not have recognized it, but it did very well for a\nbeginner, and Polly understood that night wherein the fascination of it\nlay, for she felt as if she had found a new gift all of a sudden, and\nwas learning how to use it, knowing that it was dangerous, yet finding\nits chief charm in that very fact.\n\nTom did n't know what to make of her at first, though he thought the\nchange uncommonly becoming and finally decided that Polly had taken his\nadvice and was \"setting her cap for Syd,\" as he gracefully expressed\nit. Sydney, being a modest man, thought nothing of the kind, but simply\nfancied that little Polly was growing up to be a very charming woman. He\nhad known her since her first visit and had always liked the child; this\nwinter he had been interested in the success of her plans and had done\nwhat he could to help them, but he never thought of failing in love\nwith Polly till that night. Then he began to feel that he had not fully\nappreciated his young friend; that she was such a bright and lovable\ngirl, it was a pity she should not always be gay and pretty, and enjoy\nherself; that she would make a capital wife for somebody, and perhaps it\nwas about time to think of \"settling,\" as his sister often said. These\nthoughts came and went as he watched the white figure in front, felt\nthe enchantment of the music, and found everybody unusually blithe and\nbeautiful. He had heard the opera many times, but it had never seemed\nso fine before, perhaps because he had never happened to have had an\ningenuous young face so near him in which the varying emotions born of\nthe music, and the romance it portrayed, came and went so eloquently\nthat it was impossible to help reading them. Polly did not know that\nthis was why he leaned down so often to speak to her, with an expression\nwhich she did not understand but liked very much nevertheless.\n\n\"Don't shut your eyes, Polly. They are so full of mischief to-night, I\nlike to see them,\" said Tom, after idly wondering for a minute if she\nknew how long and curly her lashes were.\n\n\"I don't wish to look affected, but the music tells the story so much\nbetter than the acting that I don't care to look on half the time,\"\nanswered Polly, hoping Tom would n't see the tears she had so cleverly\nsuppressed.\n\n\"Now I like the acting best. The music is all very fine, I know, but it\ndoes seem so absurd for people to go round telling tremendous secrets at\nthe top of their voices. I can't get used to it.\"\n\n\"That's because you've more common-sense than romance. I don't mind\nthe absurdity, and quite long to go and comfort that poor girl with\nthe broken heart,\" said Polly with a sigh as the curtain fell on a most\naffecting tableau.\n\n\"What's-his-name is a great jack not to see that she adores him. In\nreal life we fellows ain't such bats as all that,\" observed Tom, who had\ndecided opinions on many subjects that he knew very little about, and\nexpressed them with great candor.\n\nA curious smile passed over Polly's face and she put up her glass to\nhide her eyes, as she said: \"I think you are bats sometimes, but women\nare taught to wear masks, and that accounts for it, I suppose.\"\n\n\"I don't agree. There's precious little masking nowadays; wish there\nwas a little more sometimes,\" added Tom, thinking of several blooming\ndamsels whose beseeching eyes had begged him not to leave them to wither\non the parent stem.\n\n\"I hope not, but I guess there's a good deal more than any one would\nsuspect.\"\n\n\"What can you know about broken hearts and blighted beings?\" asked\nSydney, smiling at the girl's pensive tone.\n\nPolly glanced up at him and her face dimpled and shone again, as she\nanswered, laughing: \"Not much; my time is to come.\"\n\n\"I can't imagine you walking about the world with your back hair down,\nbewailing a hard-hearted lover,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Neither can I. That would n't be my way.\"\n\n\"No; Miss Polly would let concealment prey on her damask cheeks and\nstill smile on in the novel fashion, or turn sister of charity and nurse\nthe heartless lover through small-pox, or some other contagious disease,\nand die seraphically, leaving him to the agonies of remorse and tardy\nlove.\"\n\nPolly gave Sydney an indignant look as he said that in a slow satirical\nway that nettled her very much, for she hated to be thought sentimental.\n\n\"That's not my way either,\" she said decidedly. \"I'd try to outlive\nit, and if I could n't, I'd try to be the better for it. Disappointment\nneed n't make a woman a fool.\"\n\n\"Nor an old maid, if she's pretty and good. Remember that, and don't\nvisit the sins of one blockhead on all the rest of mankind,\" said Tom,\nlaughing at her earnestness.\n\n\"I don't think there is the slightest possibility of Miss Polly's being\neither,\" added Sydney with a look which made it evident that concealment\nhad not seriously damaged Polly's damask cheek as yet.\n\n\"There's Clara Bird. I have n't seen her but once since she was\nmarried. How pretty she looks!\" and Polly retired behind the big glass\nagain, thinking the chat was becoming rather personal.\n\n\"Now, there's a girl who tried a different cure for unrequited\naffection from any you mention. People say she was fond of Belle's\nbrother. He did n't reciprocate but went off to India to spoil his\nconstitution, so Clara married a man twenty years older than she is and\nconsoles herself by being the best-dressed woman in the city.\"\n\n\"That accounts for it,\" said Polly, when Tom's long whisper ended.\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"The tired look in her eyes.\"\n\n\"I don't see it,\" said Tom, after a survey through the glass.\n\n\"Did n't expect you would.\"\n\n\"I see what you mean. A good many women have it nowadays,\" said Sydney\nover Polly's shoulder.\n\n\"What's she tired of? The old gentleman?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"And herself,\" added Polly.\n\n\"You've been reading French novels, I know you have. That's just the\nway the heroines go on,\" cried Tom.\n\n\"I have n't read one, but it's evident you have, young man, and you'd\nbetter stop.\"\n\n\"I don't care for'em; only do it to keep up my French. But how came you\nto be so wise, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Observation, sir. I like to watch faces, and I seldom see a grown-up\none that looks perfectly happy.\"\n\n\"True for you, Polly; no more you do, now I think of it. I don't know\nbut one that always looks so, and there it is.\"\n\n\"Where?\" asked Polly, with interest.\n\n\"Look straight before you and you'll see it.\"\n\nPolly did look, but all she saw was her own face in the little mirror of\nthe fan which Tom held up and peeped over with a laugh in his eyes.\n\n\"Do I look happy? I'm glad of that,\" And Polly surveyed herself with\ncare.\n\nBoth young men thought it was girlish vanity and smiled at its naive\ndisplay, but Polly was looking for something deeper than beauty and was\nglad not to find it.\n\n\"Rather a pleasant little prospect, hey, Polly?\"\n\n\"My bonnet is straight, and that's all I care about. Did you ever see a\npicture of Beau Brummel?\" asked Polly quickly.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, there he is, modernized.\" And turning the fan, she showed him\nhimself.\n\n\"Any more portraits in your gallery?\" asked Sydney, as if he liked to\nshare all the nonsense going.\n\n\"One more.\"\n\n\"What do you call it?\"\n\n\"The portrait of a gentleman.\" And the little glass reflected a\ngratified face for the space of two seconds.\n\n\"Thank you. I'm glad I don't disgrace my name,\" said Sydney, looking\ndown into the merry blue eyes that thanked him silently for many of the\nsmall kindnesses that women never can forget.\n\n\"Very good, Polly, you are getting on fast,\" whispered Tom, patting his\nyellow kids approvingly.\n\n\"Be quiet! Dear me, how warm it is!\" And Polly gave him a frown that\ndelighted his soul.\n\n\"Come out and have an ice, we shall have time.\"\n\n\"Fan is so absorbed, I could n't think of disturbing her,\" said Polly,\nfancying that her friend was enjoying the evening as much as she was a\ngreat mistake, by the way, for Fan was acting for effect, and though she\nlonged to turn and join them, would n't do it, unless a certain person\nshowed signs of missing her. He did n't, and Fanny chatted on, raging\ninwardly over her disappointment, and wondering how Polly could be so\ngay and selfish.\n\nIt was delicious to see the little airs Polly put on, for she felt as if\nshe were somebody else, and acting a part. She leaned back, as if quite\noppressed by the heat, permitted Sydney to fan her, and paid him for\nthe service by giving him a flower from her bouquet, proceedings which\namused Tom immensely, even while it piqued him a little to be treated\nlike an old friend who did n't count.\n\n\"Go in and win, Polly; I'll give you my blessing,\" he whispered, as the\ncurtain rose again.\n\n\"It's only part of the fun, so don't you laugh, you disrespectful boy,\"\nshe whispered back in a tone never used toward Sydney.\n\nTom did n't quite like the different way in which she treated them, and\nthe word \"boy\" disturbed his dignity, for he was almost twenty-one and\nPolly ought to treat him with more respect. Sydney at the same moment\nwas wishing he was in Tom's place young, comely, and such a familiar\nfriend that Polly would scold and lecture him in the delightful way she\ndid Tom; while Polly forgot them both when the music began and left them\nample time to look at her and think about themselves.\n\nWhile they waited to get out when all was over Polly heard Fan whisper\nto Tom: \"What do you think Trix will say to this?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why, the way you've been going on to-night.\"\n\n\"Don't know, and don't care; it's only Polly.\"\n\n\"That's the very thing. She can't bear P.\"\n\n\"Well, I can; and I don't see why I should n't enjoy myself as well as\nTrix.\"\n\n\"You'll get to enjoying yourself too much if you are n't careful. Polly\n's waked up.\"\n\n\"I'm glad of it, and so's Syd.\"\n\n\"I only spoke for your good.\"\n\n\"Don't trouble yourself about me; I get lecturing enough in another\nquarter and can't stand any more. Come, Polly.\"\n\nShe took the arm he offered her, but her heart was sore and angry,\nfor that phrase, \"It's only Polly,\" hurt her sadly. \"As if I was n't\nanybody, had n't any feelings, and was only made to amuse or work for\npeople! Fan and Tom are both mistaken and I'll show them that Polly is\nawake,\" she thought, indignantly. \"Why should n't I enjoy myself as well\nas the rest? Besides, it's only Tom,\" she added with a bitter smile as\nshe thought of Trix.\n\n\"Are you tired, Polly?\" asked Tom, bending down to look into her face.\n\n\"Yes, of being nobody.\"\n\n\"Ah, but you ain't nobody, you're Polly, and you could n't better that\nif you tried ever so hard,\" said Tom, warmly, for he really was fond of\nPolly, and felt uncommonly so just then.\n\n\"I'm glad you think so, anyway. It's so pleasant to be liked.\" And she\nlooked up with her face quite bright again.\n\n\"I always did like you, don't you know, ever since that first visit.\"\n\n\"But you teased me shamefully, for all that.\"\n\n\"So I did, but I don't now.\"\n\nPolly did not answer, and Tom asked, with more anxiety than the occasion\nrequired: \"Do I, Polly?\"\n\n\"Not in the same way, Tom,\" she answered in a tone that did n't sound\nquite natural.\n\n\"Well, I never will again.\"\n\n\"Yes, you will, you can't help it.\" And Polly's eye glanced at Sydney,\nwho was in front with Fan.\n\nTom laughed, and drew Polly closer as the crowd pressed, saying, with\nmock tenderness: \"Did n't she like to be chaffed about her sweethearts?\nWell, she shan't be if I can help it. Poor dear, did she get her little\nbonnet knocked into a cocked hat and her little temper riled at the same\ntime?\"\n\nPolly could n't help laughing, and, in spite of the crush, enjoyed the\nslow journey from seat to carriage, for Tom took such excellent care of\nher, she was rather sorry when it was over.\n\nThey had a merry little supper after they got home, and Polly gave them\na burlesque opera that convulsed her hearers, for her spirits rose again\nand she was determined to get the last drop of fun before she went back\nto her humdrum life again.\n\n\"I've had a regularly splendid time, and thank you ever so much,\" she\nsaid when the \"good-nights\" were being exchanged.\n\n\"So have I. Let's go and do it again to-morrow,\" said Tom, holding the\nhand from which he had helped to pull a refractory glove.\n\n\"Not for a long while, please. Too much pleasure would soon spoil me,\"\nanswered Polly, shaking her head.\n\n\"I don't believe it. Good-night,'sweet Mistress Milton,' as Syd called\nyou. Sleep like an angel, and don't dream of I forgot, no teasing\nallowed.\" And Tom took himself off with a theatrical farewell.\n\n\"Now it's all over and done with,\" thought Polly as she fell asleep\nafter a long vigil. But it was not, and Polly's fun cost more than the\nprice of gloves and bonnet, for, having nibbled at forbidden fruit, she\nhad to pay the penalty. She only meant to have a good time, and there\nwas no harm in that, but unfortunately she yielded to the various small\ntemptations that beset pretty young girls and did more mischief to\nothers than to herself. Fanny's friendship grew cooler after that night.\nTom kept wishing Trix was half as satisfactory as Polly, and Mr. Sydney\nbegan to build castles that had no foundation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. THE SUNNY SIDE\n\n\n\"I'VE won the wager, Tom.\"\n\n\"Did n't know there was one.\"\n\n\"Don't you remember you said Polly would be tired of her teaching and\ngive it up in three months, and I said she would n't?\"\n\n\"Well, is n't she?\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it. I thought she was at one time, and expected every day\nto have her come in with a long face, and say she could n't stand it.\nBut somehow, lately, she is always bright and happy, seems to like her\nwork, and don't have the tired, worried look she used to at first. The\nthree months are out, so pay up, Tommy.\"\n\n\"All right, what will you have?\"\n\n\"You may make it gloves. I always need them, and papa looks sober when I\nwant money.\"\n\nThere was a minute's pause as Fan returned to her practising, and Tom\nrelapsed into the reverie he was enjoying seated astride of a chair,\nwith his chin on his folded arms.\n\n\"Seems to me Polly don't come here as often as she used to,\" he said,\npresently.\n\n\"No, she seems to be very busy; got some new friends, I believe, old\nladies, sewing-girls, and things of that sort. I miss her, but know she\n'll get tired of being goody, and will come back to me before long.\"\n\n\"Don't be too sure of that, ma'am.\" Something in Tom's tone made Fan\nturn round, and ask, \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Well, it strikes me that Sydney is one of Polly's new friends. Have n't\nyou observed that she is uncommonly jolly, and don't that sort of thing\naccount for it?\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Fanny, sharply.\n\n\"Hope it is,\" coolly returned Tom.\n\n\"What put it into your head?\" demanded Fanny, twirling round again so\nthat her face was hidden.\n\n\"Oh, well, I keep meeting Syd and Polly circulating in the same\ndirections; she looks as if she had found something uncommonly nice, and\nhe looks as if all creation was getting Pollyfied pretty rapidly. Wonder\nyou have n't observed it.\"\n\n\"I have.\"\n\nIt was Tom's turn to look surprised now, for Fanny's voice sounded\nstrange to him. He looked at her steadily for a minute, but saw only a\nrosy ear and a bent head. A cloud passed over his face, and he leaned\nhis chin on his arm again with a despondent whistle, as he said to\nhimself, \"Poor Fan! Both of us in a scrape at once.\"\n\n\"Don't you think it would be a good thing?\" asked Fanny, after playing a\nbar or two, very badly.\n\n\"Yes, for Syd.\"\n\n\"Not for Polly? Why, he's rich, and clever, and better than most of you\ngood-for-nothing fellows. What can the girl expect?\"\n\n\"Can't say, but I don't fancy the match myself.\"\n\n\"Don't be a dog in the manger, Tom. Bless your little heart, I only take\na brotherly sort of interest in Polly. She's a capital girl, and she\nought to marry a missionary, or one of your reformer fellows, and be\na shining light of some sort. I don't think setting up for a fine lady\nwould suit her.\"\n\n\"I think it would, and I hope she'll have the chance,\" said Fanny,\nevidently making an effort to speak kindly.\n\n\"Good for you, Fan!\" and Tom gave an emphatic nod, as if her words meant\nmore than she suspected \"Mind you,\" he added, \"I don't know anything,\nand only fancied there might be some little flirtation going on. But I\ndare say it's nothing.\"\n\n\"Time will show.\" Then Fan began to sing, and Tom's horse came, so he\ndeparted with the very unusual demonstration of a gentle pat on the\nhead, as he said kindly, \"That's right, my dear, keep jolly.\" It was\nn't an elegant way of expressing sympathy, but it was hearty, and\nFan thanked him for it, though she only said, \"Don't break your neck,\nTommy.\"\n\nWhen he was gone, Fan's song ended as suddenly as it began, and she sat\nthinking, with varying expressions of doubt and trouble passing rapidly\nacross her face.\n\n\"Well, I can't do anything but wait!\" she said, at last, slamming the\nmusic-book together with a desperate look. \"Yes, I can,\" she added, a\nminute after, \"it's Polly's holiday. I can go and see her, and if there\nis anything in it I shall find it out.\"\n\nFanny dropped her face into her hands, with a little shiver, as she said\nthat; then got up, looking as pale and resolute as if going to meet some\ndreadful doom, and putting on her things, went away to Polly's as fast\nas her dignity would allow.\n\nSaturday morning was Polly's clearing-up day, and Fan found her with a\nhandkerchief tied over her head, and a big apron on, just putting the\nlast touches to the tidy little room, which was as fresh and bright as\nwater, air, and a pair of hands could make it.\n\n\"All ready for company. I'll just whisk off my regimentals, and Polly,\nthe maid, becomes Polly, the missis. It was lovely of you to come early;\ntake off your things. Another new bonnet? you extravagant wretch! How is\nyour mother and Maudie? It's a nice day, and we'll have a walk, won't\nwe?\"\n\nBy the time Polly's welcome was uttered, she had got Fan on the little\nsofa beside her, and was smiling at her in such an infectious manner,\nthat Fan could n't help smiling back.\n\n\"I came to see what you have been doing with yourself lately. You don't\ncome and report, and I got anxious about you,\" said Fanny, looking into\nthe clear eyes before her.\n\n\"I've been so busy; and I knew you would n't care to hear about my\ndoings, for they are n't the sort you like,\" answered Polly.\n\n\"Your lessons did n't use to take up all your time. It's my private\nopinion that you are taking as well as giving lessons, miss,\" said Fan,\nputting on a playfully stern air, to hide her real anxiety.\n\n\"Yes, I am,\" answered Polly, soberly.\n\n\"In what? Love?\"\n\nA quick color came to Polly's cheeks, as she laughed, and said, looking\naway, \"No; friendship and good works.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed! May I ask who is your teacher?\"\n\n\"I've more than one; but Miss Mills is head teacher.\"\n\n\"She instructs in good works; who gives the friendship lessons?\"\n\n\"Such pleasant girls! I wish you knew them, Fan. So clever, and\nenergetic, and kind, and happy, it always does me good to see them,\"\ncried Polly, with a face full of enthusiasm.\n\n\"Is that all?\" And Fan gave her a curious look of mingled disappointment\nand relief.\n\n\"There, I told you my doings would not interest you, and they don't;\nthey sound flat and prosy after your brilliant adventures. Let's change\nthe subject,\" said Polly, looking relieved herself.\n\n\"Dear me, which of our sweethearts sends us dainty bouquets of violets\nso early in the morning?\" asked Fanny, suddenly spying the purple\ncluster in a graceful little vase on the piano.\n\n\"He sends me one every week; he knows I love them so,\" and Polly's eyes\nturned that way full of pride and pleasure.\n\n\"I'd no idea he was so devoted,\" said Fanny, stooping to smell the\nflowers, and at the same time read a card that lay near them.\n\n\"You need n't plague me about it, now you know it. I never speak of\nour fondness for one another, because such things seem silly to other\npeople. Will is n't all that Jimmy was to me; but he tries to be, and I\nlove him dearly for it.\"\n\n\"Will?\" Fanny's voice quite startled Polly, it was so sharp and sudden,\nand her face grew red and pale all in a minute, as she upset the little\nvase with the start she gave.\n\n\"Yes, of course; who did you think I meant?\" asked Polly, sopping up the\nwater before it damaged her piano.\n\n\"Never mind; I thought you might be having a quiet little flirtation\nwith somebody. I feel responsible, you know, because I told your mother\nI'd look after you. The flowers are all right. My head aches so, I\nhardly know what I'm doing this morning.\"\n\nFanny spoke fast, and laughed uncomfortably, as she went back to the\nsofa, wondering if Polly had told her a lie. Polly seemed to guess at\nher thoughts as she saw the card, and turning toward her, she held it\nup, saying, with a conscious look in her eyes, \"You thought Mr. Sydney\nsent them? Well, you are mistaken, and the next time you want to know\nanything, please ask straight out. I like it better than talking at\ncross purposes.\"\n\n\"Now, my dear, don't be angry; I was only teasing you in fun. Tom took\nit into his foolish head that something was going on, and I felt a\nnatural interest, you know.\"\n\n\"Tom! What does he know or care about my affairs?\" demanded Polly.\n\n\"He met you two in the street pretty often, and being in a sentimental\nmood himself, got up a romance for you and Sydney.\"\n\n\"I'm much obliged to him for his interest, but it's quite wasted,\nthank you.\"\n\nFan's next proceeding gave her friend another surprise, for, being\nrather ashamed of herself, very much relieved, and quite at a loss what\nto say, she took refuge in an hysterical fit of tears, which changed\nPolly's anger into tenderness at once.\n\n\"Is that the trouble she has been hiding all winter? Poor dear, I wish\nI'd known it sooner,\" thought Polly, as she tried to soothe her with\ncomfortable pats, sniffs of cologne and sympathizing remarks upon the\nsubject of headache, carefully ignoring that other feminine affliction,\nthe heartache.\n\n\"There, I feel better. I've been needing a good cry for some time, and\nnow I shall be all right. Never mind it, Polly, I'm nervous and tired;\nI've danced too much lately, and dyspepsia makes me blue;\" and Fanny\nwiped her eyes and laughed.\n\n\"Of course it does; you need rest and petting, and here I've been\nscolding you, when I ought to have been extra kind. Now tell me what I\ncan do for you,\" said Polly, with a remorseful face.\n\n\"Talk to me, and tell me all about yourself. You don't seem to have as\nmany worries as other people. What's the secret, Polly?\" And Fan looked\nup with wet eyes, and a wistful face at Polly, who was putting little\ndabs of cologne all over her head.\n\n\"Well,\" said Polly, slowly, \"I just try to look on the bright side of\nthings; that helps one amazingly. Why, you've no idea how much goodness\nand sunshine you can get out of the most unpromising things, if you make\nthe best of them.\"\n\n\"I don't know how,\" said Fan, despondently.\n\n\"You can learn; I did. I used to croak and fret dreadfully, and get so\nunhappy, I was n't fit for anything. I do it still more than I ought,\nbut I try not to, and it gets easier, I find. Get a-top of your\ntroubles, and then they are half cured, Miss Mills says.\"\n\n\"Everything is so contrary and provoking,\" said Fanny, petulantly.\n\n\"Now what in the world have you to fret about?\" asked Polly, rather\nanxiously.\n\n\"Quantities of things,\" began Fan, and then stopped, for somehow she\nfelt ashamed to own that she was afflicted because she could n't have\na new set of furs, go to Paris in the spring, and make Mr. Sydney love\nher. She hunted up something more presentable, and said in a despairing\ntone, \"Well, mother is very poorly, Tom and Trix quarrel all the time,\nMaud gets more and more wilful every day, and papa is worried about his\naffairs.\"\n\n\"A sad state of things, but nothing very desperate. Can't you lend a\nhand anywhere? That might do good all round.\"\n\n\"No; I have n't the talent for managing people, but I see what ought to\nbe done.\"\n\n\"Well, don't wail about it; keep yourself happy, if you can; it will\nhelp other people to see you cheerful.\"\n\n\"Just what Tom said,'Keep jolly'; but, dear me, how can one, when\neverything is so stupid and tiresome?\"\n\n\"If ever a girl needed work, it's you!\" cried Polly. \"You began to be\na young lady so early, that you are tired of everything at twenty-two. I\nwish you'd go at something, then you'd find how much talent and energy\nyou really had.\"\n\n\"I know ever so many girls who are just like me, sick to death of\nfashionable life but don't know what to take in its place. I'd like to\ntravel; but papa says he can't afford it, so I can only drag about and\nget on as I may.\"\n\n\"I pity you rich girls so much, you have so many opportunities, and\ndon't seem to know how to use them! I suppose I should do just the same\nin your place, but it seems now as if I could be very happy and useful\nwith plenty of money.\"\n\n\"You are that without it. There, I won't croak any more. Let us go and\ntake a good walk, and don't you tell any one how I came and cried like a\nbaby.\"\n\n\"Never!\" said Polly, putting on her bonnet.\n\n\"I ought to go and make calls,\" said Fanny, \"but I don't feel now as if\nI ever wanted to see any of the girls again. Dreadful state of mind, is\nn't it?\"\n\n\"Suppose you come and see some of my friends instead! They are not fine\nor ceremonious, but lively, odd, and pleasant. Come, it will amuse you.\"\n\n\"I will,\" cried Fanny, whose spirits seemed improved by the shower.\n\"Nice little old lady, is n't she?\" added Fan, as she caught sight of\nMiss Mills, on their way out, sitting at a table piled with work, and\nsewing away with an energy that made the gray curls vibrate.\n\n\"Saint Mehitable, I call her. Now, there is a rich woman who knew how to\nget happiness out of her money,\" said Polly, as they walked away. \"She\nwas poor till she was nearly fifty; then a comfortable fortune was left\nher, and she knew just how to use it. That house was given her, but\ninstead of living in it all alone, she filled it with poor gentlefolks\nwho needed neat, respectable homes, but could n't get anything\ncomfortable for their little money. I'm one of them, and I know the\nworth of what she does for me. Two old widow ladies live below me,\nseveral students overhead, poor Mrs. Kean and her lame boy have the back\nparlor, and Jenny the little bedroom next Miss Mills. Each pays what\nthey can; that's independent, and makes us feel better but that dear\nwoman does a thousand things that money can't pay for, and we feel her\ninfluence all through the house. I'd rather be married, and have a home\nof my own; but next to that, I should like to be an old maid like Miss\nMills.\"\n\nPolly's sober face and emphatic tone made Fanny laugh, and at the cheery\nsound a young girl pushing a baby-carriage looked round and smiled.\n\n\"What lovely eyes!\" whispered Fanny.\n\n\"Yes, that's little Jane,\" returned Polly, adding, when she had passed,\nwith a nod and a friendly \"Don't get tired, Jenny,\" \"we help one another\nat our house, and every fine morning Jenny takes Johnny Kean out when\nshe goes for her own walk. That gives his mother time to rest, does both\nthe children good, and keeps things neighborly. Miss Mills suggested it,\nand Jenny is so glad to do anything for anybody, it's a pleasure to let\nher.\"\n\n\"I've heard of Miss Mills before. But I should think she would get\ntired to death, sitting there making hoods and petticoats day after\nday,\" said Fanny, after thinking over Jenny's story for a few minutes,\nfor seeing the girl seemed to bring it nearer, and make it more real to\nher.\n\n\"But she don't sit there all the time. People come to her with their\ntroubles, and she goes to them with all sorts of help, from soap and\nsoup, to shrouds for the dead and comfort for the living. I go with her\nsometimes, and it is more exciting than any play, to see and hear the\nlives and stories of the poor.\"\n\n\"How can you bear the dreadful sights and sounds, the bad air, and the\npoverty that can't be cured?\"\n\n\"But it is n't all dreadful. There are good and lovely things among\nthem, if one only has eyes to see them. It makes me grateful and\ncontented, shows me how rich I am, and keeps me ready to do all I can\nfor these poor souls.\"\n\n\"My good Polly!\" and Fanny gave her friends arm an affectionate squeeze,\nwondering if it was this alone that had worked the change in Polly.\n\n\"You have seen two of my new friends, Miss Mills and Jenny, now I'll\nshow you two more,\" said Polly, presently, as they reached a door, and\nshe led the way up several flights of public stairs. \"Rebecca Jeffrey\nis a regularly splendid girl, full of talent; she won't let us call it\ngenius; she will be famous some day, I know, she is so modest, and yet\nso intent on her work. Lizzie Small is an engraver, and designs the most\ndelightful little pictures. Becky and she live together, and take care\nof one another in true Damon and Pythias style. This studio is their\nhome, they work, eat, sleep, and live here, going halves in everything.\nThey are all alone in the world, but as happy and independent as birds;\nreal friends, whom nothing will part.\"\n\n\"Let a lover come between them, and their friendship won't last long,\"\nsaid Fanny.\n\n\"I think it will. Take a look at them, and you'll change your mind,\"\nanswered Polly, tapping at a door, on which two modest cards were\ntacked.\n\n\"Come in!\" said a voice, and obeying, Fanny found herself in a large,\nqueerly furnished room, lighted from above, and occupied by two girls.\nOne stood before a great clay figure, in a corner. This one was tall,\nwith a strong face, keen eyes, short, curly hair, and a fine head.\nFanny was struck at once by this face and figure, though the one was\nnot handsome, and the other half hidden by a great pinafore covered with\nclay. At a table where the light was clearest, sat a frail-looking girl,\nwith a thin face, big eyes, and pale hair, a dreamy, absorbed little\nperson, who bent over a block, skillfully wielding her tools.\n\n\"Becky and Bess, how do you do? This is my friend, Fanny Shaw. We are\nout on a rampage; so go on with your work, and let us lazy ones look on\nand admire.\"\n\nAs Polly spoke, both girls looked up and nodded, smilingly; Bess gave\nFan the one easy-chair; Becky took an artistic survey of the new-comer,\nwith eyes that seemed to see everything; then each went on with her\nwork, and all began to talk.\n\n\"You are just what I want, Polly. Pull up your sleeve, and give me an\narm while you sit; the muscles here are n't right, and you've got just\nwhat I want,\" said Becky, slapping the round arm of the statue, at which\nFan was gazing with awe.\n\n\"How do you get on?\" asked Polly, throwing off her cloak, and rolling up\nher sleeves, as if going to washing.\n\n\"Slowly. The idea is working itself clear, and I follow as fast as my\nhands can. Is the face better, do you think?\" said Becky, taking off a\nwet cloth, and showing the head of the statue.\n\n\"How beautiful it is!\" cried Fanny, staring at it with increased\nrespect.\n\n\"What does it mean to you?\" asked Rebecca, turning to her with a sudden\nshine in her keen eyes.\n\n\"I don't know whether it is meant for a saint or a muse, a goddess or a\nfate; but to me it is only a beautiful woman, bigger, lovelier, and more\nimposing than any woman I ever saw,\" answered Fanny, slowly, trying to\nexpress the impression the statue made upon her.\n\nRebecca smiled brightly, and Bess looked round to nod approvingly, but\nPolly clapped her hands, and said, \"Well done, Fan! I did n't think you\n'd get the idea so well, but you have, and I'm proud of your insight.\nNow I'll tell you, for Becky will let me, since you have paid her the\ncompliment of understanding her work. Some time ago we got into a famous\ntalk about what women should be, and Becky said she'd show us her idea\nof the coming woman. There she is, as you say, bigger, lovelier, and\nmore imposing than any we see nowadays; and at the same time, she is\na true woman. See what a fine forehead, yet the mouth is both firm\nand tender, as if it could say strong, wise things, as well as teach\nchildren and kiss babies. We could n't decide what to put in the hands\nas the most appropriate symbol. What do you say?\"\n\n\"Give her a sceptre: she would make a fine queen,\" answered Fanny.\n\n\"No, we have had enough of that; women have been called queens a long\ntime, but the kingdom given them is n't worth ruling,\" answered Rebecca.\n\n\"I don't think it is nowadays,\" said Fanny, with a tired sort of sigh.\n\n\"Put a man's hand in hers to help her along, then,\" said Polly, whose\nhappy fortune it had been to find friends and helpers in father and\nbrothers.\n\n\"No; my woman is to stand alone, and help herself,\" said Rebecca,\ndecidedly.\n\n\"She's to be strong-minded, is she?\" and Fanny's lip curled a little as\nshe uttered the misused words.\n\n\"Yes, strong-minded, strong-hearted, strong-souled, and strong-bodied;\nthat is why I made her larger than the miserable, pinched-up woman of\nour day. Strength and beauty must go together. Don't you think these\nbroad shoulders can bear burdens without breaking down, these hands work\nwell, these eyes see clearly, and these lips do something besides simper\nand gossip?\"\n\nFanny was silent; but a voice from Bess's corner said, \"Put a child in\nher arms, Becky.\"\n\n\"Not that even, for she is to be something more than a nurse.\"\n\n\"Give her a ballot-box,\" cried a new voice, and turning round, they saw\nan odd-looking woman perched on a sofa behind them.\n\n\"Thank you for the suggestion, Kate. I'll put that with the other\nsymbols at her feet; for I'm going to have needle, pen, palette,\nand broom somewhere, to suggest the various talents she owns, and the\nballot-box will show that she has earned the right to use them. How\ngoes it?\" and Rebecca offered a clay-daubed hand, which the new-comer\ncordially shook.\n\n\"Great news, girls! Anna is going to Italy!\" cried Kate, tossing up her\nbonnet like a school-boy.\n\n\"Oh, how splendid! Who takes her? Has she had a fortune left her? Tell\nall about it,\" exclaimed the girls, gathering round the speaker.\n\n\"Yes, it is splendid; just one of the beautiful things that does\neverybody heaps of good, it is so generous and so deserved. You know\nAnna has been longing to go; working and hoping for a chance, and never\ngetting it, till all of a sudden Miss Burton is inspired to invite the\ngirl to go with her for several years to Italy. Think of the luck of\nthat dear soul, the advantages she'll have, the good it will do her,\nand, best of all, the lovely way in which it comes to her. Miss Burton\nwants, her as a friend, asks nothing of her but her company, and Anna\nwill go through fire and water for her, of course. Now, is n't that\nfine?\"\n\nIt was good to see how heartily these girls sympathized in their\ncomrade's good fortune. Polly danced all over the room, Bess and Becky\nhugged one another, and Kate laughed with her eyes full, while even\nFanny felt a glow of, pride and pleasure at the kind act.\n\n\"Who is that?\" she whispered to Polly, who had subsided into a corner.\n\n\"Why, it Is Kate King, the authoress. Bless me, how rude not to\nintroduce you! Here, my King, is an admirer of yours, Fanny Shaw, and\nmy well beloved friend,\" cried Polly, presenting Fan, who regarded the\nshabby young woman with as much respect, as if she had been arrayed in\nvelvet and ermine; for Kate had written a successful book by accident,\nand happened to be the fashion, just then.\n\n\"It's time for lunch, girls, and I brought mine along with me, it's\nso much jollier to eat in sisterhood. Let's club together, and have a\nrevel,\" said Kate, producing a bag of oranges, and several big, plummy\nbuns.\n\n\"We've got sardines, crackers, and cheese,\" said Bess, clearing off a\ntable with all speed.\n\n\"Wait a bit, and I'll add my share,\" cried Polly, and catching up her\ncloak, she ran off to the grocery store near by.\n\n\"You'll be shocked at our performances, Miss Shaw, but you can call\nit a picnic, and never tell what dreadful things you saw us do,\" said\nRebecca, polishing a paint knife by rubbing it up and down in a pot of\nivy, while Kate spread forth the feast in several odd plates, and a flat\nshell or two.\n\n\"Let us have coffee to finish off with; put on the pot, Bess, and skim\nthe milk,\" added Becky, as she produced cups, mugs, and a queer little\nvase, to supply drinking vessels for the party.\n\n\"Here's nuts, a pot of jam, and some cake. Fan likes sweet things,\nand we want to be elegant when we have company,\" said Polly, flying in\nagain, and depositing her share on the table.\n\n\"Now, then, fall to, ladies, and help yourselves. Never mind if the\nchina don't hold out; take the sardines by their little tails, and wipe\nyour fingers on my brown-paper napkins,\" said Kate, setting the example\nwith such a relish, that the others followed it in a gale of merriment.\n\nFanny had been to many elegant lunches, but never enjoyed one more than\nthat droll picnic in the studio; for there was a freedom about it that\nwas charming, an artistic flavor to everything, and such a spirit of\ngood-will and gayety, that she felt at home at once. As they ate, the\nothers talked and she listened, finding it as interesting as any romance\nto hear these young women discuss their plans, ambitions, successes, and\ndefeats. It was a new world to her, and they seemed a different race\nof creatures from the girls whose lives were spent in dress, gossip,\npleasure, or ennui. They were girls still, full of spirits fun, and\nyouth; but below the light-heartedness each cherished a purpose,\nwhich seemed to ennoble her womanhood, to give her a certain power,\na sustaining satisfaction, a daily stimulus, that led her on to daily\neffort, and in time to some success in circumstance or character, which\nwas worth all the patience, hope, and labor of her life.\n\nFanny was just then in the mood to feel the beauty of this, for\nthe sincerest emotion she had ever known was beginning to make her\ndissatisfied with herself, and the aimless life she led. \"Men must\nrespect such girls as these,\" she thought; \"yes, and love them too, for\nin spite of their independence, they are womanly. I wish I had a talent\nto live for, if it would do as much for me as it does for them. It\nis this sort of thing that is improving Polly, that makes her society\ninteresting to Sydney, and herself so dear to every one. Money can't buy\nthese things for me, and I want them very much.\"\n\nAs these thoughts were passing through her mind, Fanny was hearing all\nsorts of topics discussed with feminine enthusiasm and frankness. Art,\nmorals, politics, society, books, religion, housekeeping, dress, and\neconomy, for the minds and tongues roved from subject to subject with\nyouthful rapidity, and seemed to get something from the dryest and the\ndullest.\n\n\"How does the new book come on?\" asked Polly, sucking her orange in\npublic with a composure which would have scandalized the good ladies of\n\"Cranford.\"\n\n\"Better than it deserves. My children, beware of popularity; it is a\ndelusion and a snare; it puffeth up the heart of man, and especially\nof woman; it blindeth the eyes to faults; it exalteth unduly the humble\npowers of the victim; it is apt to be capricious, and just as one gets\nto liking the taste of this intoxicating draught, it suddenly faileth,\nand one is left gasping, like a fish out of water,\" and Kate emphasized\nher speech by spearing a sardine with a penknife, and eating it with a\ngroan.\n\n\"It won't hurt you much, I guess; you have worked and waited so long,\na large dose will do you good,\" said Rebecca, giving her a generous\nspoonful of jam, as if eager to add as much sweetness as possible to a\nlife that had not been an easy one.\n\n\"When are you and Becky going to dissolve partnership?\" asked Polly,\neager for news of all.\n\n\"Never! George knows he can't have one without the other, and has not\nsuggested such a thing as parting us. There is always room in my house\nfor Becky, and she lets me do as she would if she was in my place,\"\nanswered Bess, with a look which her friend answered by a smile.\n\n\"The lover won't separate this pair of friends, you see,\" whispered\nPolly to Fan. \"Bess is to be married in the spring, and Becky is to live\nwith her.\"\n\n\"By the way, Polly, I've got some tickets for you. People are always\nsending me such things, and as I don't care for them, I'm glad to\nmake them over to you young and giddy infants. There are passes for\nthe statuary exhibition, Becky shall have those, here are the concert\ntickets for you, my musical girl; and that is for a course of lectures\non literature, which I'll keep for myself.\"\n\nAs Kate dealt out the colored cards to the grateful girls, Fanny took a\ngood look at her, wondering if the time would ever come when women could\nearn a little money and success, without paying such a heavy price for\nthem; for Kate looked sick, tired, and too early old. Then her eye went\nto the unfinished statue, and she said, impulsively, \"I hope you'll put\nthat in marble, and show us what we ought to be.\"\n\n\"I wish I could!\" And an intense desire shone in Rebecca's face, as she\nsaw her faulty work, and felt how fair her model was.\n\nFor a minute, the five young women sat silent looking up at the\nbeautiful, strong figure before them, each longing to see it done, and\neach unconscious that she was helping, by her individual effort and\nexperience, to bring the day when their noblest ideal of womanhood\nshould be embodied in flesh and blood, not clay.\n\nThe city bells rung one, and Polly started up.\n\n\"I must go, for I promised a neighbor of mine a lesson at two.\"\n\n\"I thought this was a holiday,\" said Fanny.\n\n\"So it is, but this is a little labor of love, and does n't spoil the\nday at all. The child has talent, loves music, and needs help. I can't\ngive her money, but I can teach her; so I do, and she is the most\npromising pupil I have. Help one another, is part of the religion of our\nsisterhood, Fan.\"\n\n\"I must put you in a story, Polly. I want a heroine, and you will do,\"\nsaid Kate.\n\n\"Me! why, there never was such a humdrum, unromantic thing as I am,\"\ncried Polly, amazed.\n\n\"I've booked you, nevertheless, so in you go; but you may add as much\nromance as you like, it's time you did.\"\n\n\"I'm ready for it when it comes, but it can't be forced, you know,\"\nand Polly blushed and smiled as if some little spice of that delightful\nthing had stolen into her life, for all its prosaic seeming.\n\nFanny was amused to see that the girls did not kiss at parting, but\nshook hands in a quiet, friendly fashion, looking at one another with\neyes that said more than the most \"gushing\" words.\n\n\"I like your friends very much, Polly. I was afraid I should find them\nmannish and rough, or sentimental and conceited. But they are simple,\nsensible creatures, full of talent, and all sorts of fine things. I\nadmire and respect them, and want to go again, if I may.\"\n\n\"Oh, Fan, I am so glad! I hoped you'd like them, I knew they'd do you\ngood, and I'll take you any time, for you stood the test better than\nI expected. Becky asked me to bring you again, and she seldom does that\nfor fashionable young ladies, let me tell you.\"\n\n\"I want to be ever so much better, and I think you and they might show\nme how,\" said Fanny, with a traitorous tremble in her voice.\n\n\"We'll show you the sunny side of poverty and work, and that is a\nuseful lesson for any one, Miss Mills says,\" answered Polly, hoping that\nFan would learn how much the poor can teach the rich, and what helpful\nfriends girls may be to one another.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. NIPPED IN THE BUD\n\n\nON the evening of Fan's visit, Polly sat down before her fire with a\nresolute and thoughtful aspect. She pulled her hair down, turned her\nskirt back, put her feet on the fender, and took Puttel into her lap,\nall of which arrangements signified that something very important had\ngot to be thought over and settled. Polly did not soliloquize aloud,\nas heroines on the stage and in books have a way of doing, but the\nconversation she held with herself was very much like this: \"I'm afraid\nthere is something in it. I've tried to think it's nothing but vanity\nor imagination, yet I can't help seeing a difference, and feeling as if\nI ought not to pretend that I don't. I know it's considered proper for\ngirls to shut their eyes and let things come to a crisis no matter how\nmuch mischief is done. But I don't think it's doing as we'd be done\nby, and it seems a great deal more honest to show a man that you don't\nlove him before he has entirely lost his heart. The girls laughed at me\nwhen I said so, and they declared that it would be a very improper thing\nto do, but I've observed that they don't hesitate to snub'ineligible\nparties,' as they call poor, very young, or unpopular men. It's all\nright then, but when a nice person comes it's part of the fun to let\nhim go on to the very end, whether the girls care for him or not. The\nmore proposals, the more credit. Fan says Trix always asks when she\ncomes home after the summer excursions, 'How many birds have you\nbagged?' as if men were partridges. What wicked creatures we are! some\nof us at least. I wonder why such a love of conquest was put into us?\nMother says a great deal of it is owing to bad education nowadays, but\nsome girls seem born for the express purpose of making trouble and would\nmanage to do it if they lived in a howling wilderness. I'm afraid I've\ngot a spice of it, and if I had the chance, should be as bad as any of\nthem. I've tried it and liked it, and maybe this is the consequence of\nthat night's fun.\"\n\nHere Polly leaned back and looked up at the little mirror over the\nchimney-piece, which was hung so that it reflected the faces of those\nabout the fire. In it Polly saw a pair of telltale eyes looking out from\na tangle of bright brown hair, cheeks that flushed and dimpled suddenly\nas the fresh mouth smiled with an expression of conscious power, half\nproud, half ashamed, and as pretty to see as the coquettish gesture with\nwhich she smoothed back her curls and flourished a white hand. For\na minute she regarded the pleasant picture while visions of girlish\nromances and triumphs danced through her head, then she shook her hair\nall over her face and pushed her chair out of range of the mirror,\nsaying, with a droll mixture of self-reproach and self-approval in her\ntone; \"Oh, Puttel, Puttel, what a fool I am!\"\n\nPuss appeared to endorse the sentiment by a loud purr and a graceful\nwave of her tail, and Polly returned to the subject from which these\nlittle vanities had beguiled her.\n\n\"Just suppose it is true, that he does ask me, and I say yes! What a\nstir it would make, and what fun it would be to see the faces of the\ngirls when it came out! They all think a great deal of him because he is\nso hard to please, and almost any of them would feel immensely flattered\nif he liked them, whether they chose to marry him or not. Trix has tried\nfor years to fascinate him, and he can't bear her, and I'm so glad!\nWhat a spiteful thing I am. Well, I can't help it, she does aggravate me\nso!\" And Polly gave the cat such a tweak of the ear that Puttel bounced\nout of her lap in high dudgeon.\n\n\"It don't do to think of her, and I won't!\" said Polly to herself,\nsetting her lips with a grim look that was not at all becoming. \"What\nan easy life I should have plenty of money, quantities of friends,\nall sorts of pleasures, and no work, no poverty, no cold shoulders or\npatched boots. I could do so much for all at home how I should enjoy\nthat!\" And Polly let her thoughts revel in the luxurious future her\nfancy painted. It was a very bright picture, but something seemed\namiss with it, for presently she sighed and shook her head, thinking\nsorrowfully, \"Ah, but I don't love him, and I'm afraid I never can as\nI ought! He's very good, and generous, and wise, and would be kind,\nI know, but somehow I can't imagine spending my life with him; I'm\nso afraid I should get tired of him, and then what should I do? Polly\nSydney don't sound well, and Mrs. Arthur Sydney don't seem to fit me a\nbit. Wonder how it would seem to call him 'Arthur'?\" And Polly said it\nunder her breath, with a look over her shoulder to be sure no one heard\nit. \"It's a pretty name, but rather too fine, and I should n't dare\nto say 'Syd,' as his sister does. I like short, plain, home-like names,\nsuch as Will, Ned, or Tom. No, no, I can never care for him, and it's\nno use to try!\" The exclamation broke from Polly as if a sudden\ntrouble had seized her, and laying her head down on her knees, she sat\nmotionless for many minutes.\n\nWhen she looked up, her face wore an expression which no one had ever\nseen on it before; a look of mingled pain and patience, as if some loss\nhad come to her, and left the bitterness of regret behind.\n\n\"I won't think of myself, or try to mend one mistake by making another,\"\nshe said with a heavy sigh. \"I'll do what I can for Fan, and not stand\nbetween her and a chance of happiness. Let me see, how can I begin? I\nwon't walk with him any more; I'll dodge and go roundabout ways, so\nthat we can't meet. I never had much faith in the remarkable coincidence\nof his always happening home to dinner just as I go to give the Roths\ntheir lesson. The fact is, I like to meet him, I am glad to be seen with\nhim, and put on airs, I dare say, like a vain goose as I am. Well, I\nwon't do it any more, and that will spare Fan one affliction. Poor dear,\nhow I must have worried her all this time, and never guessed it. She has\nn't been quite as kind as ever; but when she got sharp, I fancied it was\ndyspepsia. Oh, me! I wish the other trouble could be cured as easily as\nthis.\"\n\nHere puss showed an amiable desire to forgive and forget, and Polly\ntook her up, saying aloud: \"Puttel, when missis abuses you, play it's\ndyspepsia, and don't bear malice, because it's a very trying disease,\nmy dear.\"\n\nThen, going back to her thoughts, she rambled on again; \"If he does\nn't take that hint, I will give him a stronger one, for I will not have\nmatters come to a crisis, though I can't deny that my wicked vanity\nstrongly tempts me to try and'bag a bird' just for the excitement and\ncredit of the thing. Polly, I'm ashamed of you! What would your blessed\nmother say to hear such expressions from you? I'd write and tell her\nall the worry, only it would n't do any good, and would only trouble\nher. I've no right to tell Fan's secrets, and I'm ashamed to tell\nmine. No, I'll leave mother in peace, and fight it out alone. I do\nthink Fan would suit him excellently by and by. He has known her all her\nlife, and has a good influence over her. Love would do so much toward\nmaking her what she might be; it's a shame to have the chance lost just\nbecause he happens to see me. I should think she'd hate me; but I'll\nshow her that she need n't, and do all I can to help her; for she has\nbeen so good to me nothing shall ever make me forget that. It is a\ndelicate and dangerous task, but I guess I can manage it; at any rate\nI'll try, and have nothing to reproach myself with if things do go\n'contrary.'\"\n\nWhat Polly thought of, as she lay back in her chair, with her eyes shut,\nand a hopeless look on her face, is none of our business, though we\nmight feel a wish to know what caused a tear to gather slowly from time\nto time under her lashes, and roll down on Puttel's Quaker-colored coat.\nWas it regret for the conquest she relinquished, was it sympathy for her\nfriend, or was it an uncontrollable overflow of feeling as she read some\nsad or tender passage of the little romance which she kept hidden away\nin her own heart?\n\nOn Monday, Polly began the \"delicate and dangerous task.\" Instead\nof going to her pupils by way of the park and the pleasant streets\nadjoining, she took a roundabout route through back streets, and thus\nescaped Mr. Sydney, who, as usual, came home to dinner very early that\nday and looked disappointed because he nowhere saw the bright face\nin the modest bonnet. Polly kept this up for a week, and by carefully\navoiding the Shaws' house during calling hours, she saw nothing of\nMr. Sydney, who, of course, did n't visit her at Miss Mills'. Minnie\nhappened to be poorly that week and took no lesson, so Uncle Syd was\ndeprived of his last hope, and looked as if his allowance of sunshine\nhad been suddenly cut off.\n\nNow, as Polly was by no means a perfect creature, I am free to confess\nthat the old temptation assailed her more than once that week, for, when\nthe first excitement of the dodging reform had subsided, she missed the\npleasant little interviews that used to put a certain flavor of romance\ninto her dull, hard-working days. She liked Mr. Sydney very much, for\nhe had always been kind and friendly since the early times when he had\ntreated the little girl with a courtesy which the young woman gratefully\nremembered. I don't think it was his wealth, accomplishments, or\nposition that most attracted Polly, though these doubtless possessed\na greater influence than she suspected. It was that indescribable\nsomething which women are quick to see and feel in men who have been\nblessed with wise and good mothers. This had an especial charm to Polly,\nfor she soon found that this side of his character was not shown to\nevery one. With most girls, he was very like the other young men of his\nset, except perhaps in a certain grace of manner which was as natural to\nhim as his respect for all womankind. But with Fanny and Polly he showed\nthe domestic traits and virtues which are more engaging to womanly women\nthan any amount of cool intellect or worldly wisdom.\n\nPolly had seen a good deal of him during her visits at the Shaws', where\nhe was intimate, owing to the friendship between Madam and his mother;\nbut she had never thought of him as a possible lover for either Fanny\nor herself because he was six or eight years older than they, and still\nsometimes assumed the part of a venerable mentor, as in the early days.\nLately this had changed, especially towards Polly, and it flattered her\nmore than she would confess even to herself. She knew he admired her one\ntalent, respected her independence, and enjoyed her society; but when\nsomething warmer and more flattering than admiration, respect, or\npleasure crept into his manner, she could not help seeing that one of\nthe good gifts of this life was daily coming more and more within her\nreach, and began to ask herself if she could honestly receive the gift,\nand reward the giver.\n\nAt first she tried to think she could, but unfortunately hearts are\nso \"contrary\" that they won't be obedient to reason, will, or even\ngratitude. Polly felt a very cordial friendship for Mr. Sydney, but not\none particle of the love which is the only coin in which love can be\ntruly paid. Then she took a fancy into her head that she ought to\naccept this piece of good fortune for the sake of the family, and forget\nherself. But this false idea of self-sacrifice did not satisfy, for she\nwas not a fashionable girl trained to believe that her first duty was\nto make \"a good match\" and never mind the consequences, though they\nrendered her miserable for life. Polly's creed was very simple: \"If\nI don't love him, I ought not to marry him, especially when I do love\nsomebody else, though everything is against me.\" If she had read as\nmany French novels as some young ladies, she might have considered it\ninteresting to marry under the circumstances and suffer a secret anguish\nto make her a romantic victim. But Polly's education had been neglected,\nand after a good deal of natural indecision she did what most women do\nin such cases, thought she would \"wait and see.\"\n\nThe discovery of Fanny's secret seemed to show her something to do, for\nif the \"wait and see\" decision was making her friend unhappy, it must be\nchanged as soon as possible. This finished Polly's indecision, and\nafter that night she never allowed herself to dwell upon the pleasant\ntemptation which came in a guise particularly attractive to a young girl\nwith a spice of the old Eve in her composition. So day after day she\ntrudged through the dull back streets, longing for the sunny park, the\nface that always brightened when it saw her coming, and most of all the\nchance of meeting well, it was n't Trix.\n\nWhen Saturday came, Polly started as usual for a visit to Becky and\nBess, but could n't resist stopping at the Shaws' to leave a little\nparcel for Fan, though it was calling time. As she stepped in, meaning\nto run up for a word if Fanny should chance to be alone, two hats on the\nhall table arrested her.\n\n\"Who is here, Katy?\"\n\n\"Only Mr. Sydney and Master Tom. Won't you stop a bit, Miss Polly?\"\n\n\"Not this morning, I'm rather in a hurry.\" And away went Polly as if a\ndozen eager pupils were clamoring for her presence. But as the door shut\nbehind her she felt so left out in the cold, that her eyes filled,\nand when Nep, Tom's great Newfoundland, came blundering after her, she\nstopped and hugged his shaggy head, saying softly, as she looked into\nthe brown, benevolent eyes, full of almost human sympathy: \"Now, go\nback, old dear, you must n't follow me. Oh, Nep, it's so hard to put\nlove away when you want it very much and it is n't right to take it.\"\nA foolish little speech to make to a dog, but you see Polly was only a\ntender-hearted girl, trying to do her duty.\n\n\"Since he is safe with Fanny, I may venture to walk where I like. It\n's such a lovely day, all the babies will be out, and it always does me\ngood to see them,\" thought Polly, turning into the wide, sunny street,\nwhere West End-dom promenaded at that hour.\n\nThe babies were out in full force, looking as gay and delicate and sweet\nas the snow-drops, hyacinths, and daffodils on the banks whence the\nsnow had melted. But somehow the babies did n't do Polly the good she\nexpected, though they smiled at her from their carriages, and kissed\ntheir chubby hands as she passed them, for Polly had the sort of face\nthat babies love. One tiny creature in blue plush was casting despairing\nglances after a very small lord of creation who was walking away with\na toddling belle in white, while a second young gentleman in gorgeous\npurple gaiters was endeavoring to console the deserted damsel.\n\n\"Take hold of Master Charley's hand, Miss Mamie, and walk pretty, like\nWilly and Flossy,\" said the maid.\n\n\"No, no, I want to do wid Willy, and he won't let me. Do'way, Tarley, I\ndon't lite you,\" cried little Blue-bonnet, casting down her ermine muff\nand sobbing in a microscopic handkerchief, the thread-lace edging on\nwhich could n't mitigate her woe, as it might have done that of an older\nsufferer.\n\n\"Willy likes Flossy best, so stop crying and come right along, you\nnaughty child.\"\n\nAs poor little Dido was jerked away by the unsympathetic maid, and\nPurple-gaiters essayed in vain to plead his cause, Polly said to\nherself, with a smile and a sigh; \"How early the old story begins!\"\n\nIt seemed as if the spring weather had brought out all manner of tender\nthings beside fresh grass and the first dandelions, for as she went down\nthe street Polly kept seeing different phases of the sweet old story\nwhich she was trying to forget.\n\nAt a street corner, a black-eyed school-boy was parting from\na rosy-faced school-girl, whose music roll he was reluctantly\nsurrendering.\n\n\"Don't you forget, now,\" said the boy, looking bashfully into the bright\neyes that danced with pleasure as the girl blushed and smiled, and\nanswered reproachfully; \"Why, of course I shan't!\"\n\n\"That little romance runs smoothly so far; I hope it may to the end,\"\nsaid Polly heartily as she watched the lad tramp away, whistling as\nblithely as if his pleasurable emotions must find a vent, or endanger\nthe buttons on the round jacket; while the girl pranced on her own\ndoorstep, as if practising for the joyful dance which she had promised\nnot to forget.\n\nA little farther on Polly passed a newly engaged couple whom she knew,\nwalking arm in arm for the first time, both wearing that proud yet\nconscious look which is so delightful to behold upon the countenances of\nthese temporarily glorified beings.\n\n\"How happy they seem; oh, dear!\" said Polly, and trudged on, wondering\nif her turn would ever come and fearing that it was impossible.\n\nA glimpse of a motherly-looking lady entering a door, received by a\nflock of pretty children, who cast themselves upon mamma and her parcels\nwith cries of rapture, did Polly good; and when, a minute after she\npassed a gray old couple walking placidly together in the sunshine,\nshe felt better still, and was glad to see such a happy ending to the\nromance she had read all down the street.\n\nAs if the mischievous little god wished to take Polly at a disadvantage,\nor perhaps to give her another chance, just at that instant Mr. Sydney\nappeared at her side. How he got there was never very clear to Polly,\nbut there he was, flushed, and a little out of breath, but looking so\nglad to see her that she had n't the heart to be stiff and cool, as she\nhad fully intended to be when they met.\n\n\"Very warm, is n't it?\" he said when he had shaken hands and fallen into\nstep, just in the old way.\n\n\"You seem to find it so.\" And Polly laughed, with a sudden sparkle in\nher eyes. She really could n't help it, it was so pleasant to see him\nagain, just when she was feeling so lonely.\n\n\"Have you given up teaching the Roths?\" asked Sydney, changing the\nsubject.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Do you go as usual?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, it's a mystery to me how you get there.\"\n\n\"As much as it is to me how you got here so suddenly.\"\n\n\"I saw you from the Shaws' window and took the liberty of running after\nyou by the back street,\" he said, laughing.\n\n\"That is the way I get to the Roths,\" answered Polly. She did not mean\nto tell, but his frankness was so agreeable she forgot herself.\n\n\"It's not nearly so pleasant or so short for you as the park.\"\n\n\"I know it, but people sometimes get tired of old ways and like to try\nnew ones.\"\n\nPolly did n't say that quite naturally, and Sydney gave her a quick\nlook, as he asked; \"Do you get tired of old friends, too, Miss Polly?\"\n\n\"Not often; but\" And there she stuck, for the fear of being ungrateful\nor unkind made her almost hope that he would n't take the hint which she\nhad been carefully preparing for him.\n\nThere was a dreadful little pause, which Polly broke by saying abruptly;\n\"How is Fan?\"\n\n\"Dashing, as ever. Do you know I'm rather disappointed in Fanny,\nfor she don't seem to improve with her years,\" said Sydney, as if he\naccepted the diversion and was glad of it.\n\n\"Ah, you never see her at her best. She puts on that dashing air before\npeople to hide her real self. But I know her better; and I assure you\nthat she does improve; she tries to mend her faults, though she won't\nown it, and will surprise you some day, by the amount of heart and sense\nand goodness she has got.\"\n\nPolly spoke heartily now, and Sydney looked at her as if Fanny's\ndefender pleased him more than Fanny's defence.\n\n\"I'm very glad to hear it, and willingly take your word for it.\nEverybody shows you their good side, I think, and that is why you find\nthe world such a pleasant place.\"\n\n\"Oh, but I don't! It often seems like a very hard and dismal place, and\nI croak over my trials like an ungrateful raven.\"\n\n\"Can't we make the trials lighter for you?\"\n\nThe voice that put the question was so very kind, that Polly dared not\nlook up, because she knew what the eyes were silently saying.\n\n\"Thank you, no. I don't get more tribulation than is good for me, I\nfancy, and we are apt to make mistakes when we try to dodge troubles.\"\n\n\"Or people,\" added Sydney in a tone that made Polly color up to her\nforehead.\n\n\"How lovely the park looks,\" she said, in great confusion.\n\n\"Yes, it's the pleasantest walk we have; don't you think so?\" asked the\nartful young man, laying a trap, into which Polly immediately fell.\n\n\"Yes, indeed! It's always so refreshing to me to see a little bit of\nthe country, as it were, especially at this season.\"\n\nOh, Polly, Polly, what a stupid speech to make, when you had just given\nhim to understand that you were tired of the park! Not being a fool or a\ncox-comb, Sydney put this and that together, and taking various trifles\ninto the account, he had by this time come to the conclusion that Polly\nhad heard the same bits of gossip that he had, which linked their names\ntogether, that she did n't like it, and tried to show she did n't in\nthis way. He was quicker to take a hint than she had expected, and being\nboth proud and generous, resolved to settle the matter at once, for\nPolly's sake as well as his own. So, when she made her last brilliant\nremark, he said quietly, watching her face keenly all the while; \"I\nthought so; well, I'm going out of town on business for several weeks,\nso you can enjoy your'little bit of country' without being annoyed by\nme.\"\n\n\"Annoyed? Oh, no!\" cried Polly earnestly; then stopped short, not\nknowing what to say for herself. She thought she had a good deal of\nthe coquette in her, and I've no doubt that with time and training she\nwould have become a very dangerous little person, but now she was far\ntoo transparent and straightforward by nature even to tell a white lie\ncleverly. Sydney knew this, and liked her for it, but he took advantage\nof it, nevertheless by asking suddenly; \"Honestly, now, would n't you go\nthe old way and enjoy it as much as ever, if I was n't anywhere about to\nset the busybodies gossiping?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Polly, before she could stop herself, and then could have\nbitten her tongue out for being so rude. Another awful pause seemed\nimpending, but just at that moment a horseman clattered by with a smile\nand a salute, which caused Polly to exclaim, \"Oh, there's Tom!\" with a\ntone and a look that silenced the words hovering on Sydney's lips, and\ncaused him to hold out his hand with a look which made Polly's heart\nflutter then and ache with pity for a good while afterward, though he\nonly said, \"Good by, Polly.\"\n\nHe was gone before she could do anything but look up at him with a\nremorseful face, and she walked on, feeling that the first and perhaps\nthe only lover she would ever have, had read his answer and accepted\nit in silence. She did not know what else he had read, and comforted\nherself with the thought that he did not care for her very much, since\nhe took the first rebuff so quickly.\n\nPolly did not return to her favorite walk till she learned from Minnie\nthat \"Uncle\" had really left town, and then she found that his friendly\ncompany and conversation was what had made the way so pleasant after\nall. She sighed over the perversity of things in general, and croaked a\nlittle over her trials in particular, but on the whole got over her loss\nbetter than she expected, for soon she had other sorrows beside her own\nto comfort, and such work does a body more good than floods of regretful\ntears, or hours of sentimental lamentation.\n\nShe shunned Fanny for a day or two, but gained nothing by it, for that\nyoung lady, hearing of Sydney's sudden departure, could not rest till\nshe discovered the cause of it, and walked in upon Polly one afternoon\njust when the dusk made it a propitious hour for tender confidences.\n\n\"What have you been doing with yourself lately?\" asked Fanny, composing\nherself, with her back toward the rapidly waning light.\n\n\"Wagging to and fro as usual. What's the news with you?\" answered Polly,\nfeeling that something was coming and rather glad to have it over and\ndone with.\n\n\"Nothing particular. Trix treats Tom shamefully, and he bears it like a\nlamb. I tell him to break his engagement, and not be worried so; but he\nwon't, because she has been jilted once and he thinks it's such a mean\nthing to do.\"\n\n\"Perhaps she'll jilt him.\"\n\n\"I've no doubt she will, if anything better comes along. But Trix is\ngetting passe, and I should n't wonder if she kept him to his word, just\nout of perversity, if nothing else.\"\n\n\"Poor Tom, what a fate!\" said Polly with what was meant to be a comical\ngroan; but it sounded so tragical that she saw it would n't pass, and\nhastened to hide the failure by saying, with a laugh, \"If you call Trix\npasse at twenty-three, what shall we all be at twenty-five?\" \"Utterly\ndone with, and laid upon the shelf. I feel so already, for I don't get\nhalf the attention I used to have, and the other night I heard Maud and\nGrace wondering why those old girls'did n't stay at home, and give them\na chance.'\"\n\n\"How is Maudie?\"\n\n\"Pretty well, but she worries me by her queer tastes and notions. She\nloves to go into the kitchen and mess, she hates to study, and said\nright before the Vincents that she should think it would be great fun to\nbe a beggar-girl, to go round with a basket, it must be so interesting\nto see what you'd get.\"\n\n\"Minnie said the other day she wished she was a pigeon so she could\npaddle in the puddles and not fuss about rubbers.\"\n\n\"By the way, when is her uncle coming back?\" asked Fanny, who could n't\nwait any longer and joyfully seized the opening Polly made for her.\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know.\"\n\n\"Nor care, I suppose, you hard-hearted thing.\"\n\n\"Why, Fan, what do you mean?\"\n\n\"I'm not blind, my dear, neither is Tom, and when a young gentleman\ncuts a call abruptly short, and races after a young lady, and is seen\nholding her hand at the quietest corner of the park, and then goes\ntravelling all of a sudden, we know what it means if you don't.\"\n\n\"Who got up that nice idea, I should like to know?\" demanded Polly, as\nFanny stopped for breath.\n\n\"Now don't be affected, Polly, but just tell me, like a dear, has n't he\nproposed?\"\n\n\"No, he has n't.\"\n\n\"Don't you think he means to?\"\n\n\"I don't think he'll ever say a word to me.\"\n\n\"Well, I am surprised!\" And Fanny drew a long breath, as if a load was\noff her mind. Then she added in a changed tone: \"But don't you love him,\nPolly?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Truly?\"\n\n\"Truly, Fan.\"\n\nNeither spoke for a minute, but the heart of one of them beat joyfully\nand the dusk hid a very happy face.\n\n\"Don't you think he cared for you, dear?\" asked Fanny, presently. \"I\ndon't mean to be prying, but I really thought he did.\"\n\n\"That's not for me to say, but if it is so, it's only a passing fancy\nand he'll soon get over it.\"\n\n\"Do tell me all about it; I'm so interested, and I know something has\nhappened, I hear it in your voice, for I can't see your face.\"\n\n\"Do you remember the talk we once had after reading one of Miss\nEdgeworth's stories about not letting one's lovers come to a declaration\nif one did n't love them?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you girls said it was n't proper, and I said it was honest, anyway.\nWell, I always meant to try it if I got a chance, and I have. Mind you,\nI don't say Mr. Sydney loved me, for he never said so, and never will,\nnow, but I did fancy he rather liked me and might do more if I did n't\nshow him that it was of no use.\"\n\n\"And you did?\" cried Fanny, much excited.\n\n\"I just gave him a hint and he took it. He meant to go away before that,\nso don't think his heart is broken, or mind what silly tattlers say.\nI did n't like his meeting me so much and told him so by going another\nway. He understood, and being a gentleman, made no fuss. I dare say\nhe thought I was a vain goose, and laughed at me for my pains, like\nChurchill in 'Helen.'\"\n\n\"No, he would n't; He'd like it and respect you for doing it. But,\nPolly, it would have been a grand thing for you.\"\n\n\"I can't sell myself for an establishment.\"\n\n\"Mercy! What an idea!\"\n\n\"Well, that's the plain English of half your fashionable matches. I\n'm'odd,' you know, and prefer to be an independent spinster and teach\nmusic all my days.\"\n\n\"Ah, but you won't. You were made for a nice, happy home of your own,\nand I hope you'll get it, Polly, dear,\" said Fanny warmly, feeling so\ngrateful to Polly, that she found it hard not to pour out all her secret\nat once.\n\n\"I hope I may; but I doubt it,\" answered Polly in a tone that made Fanny\nwonder if she, too, knew what heartache meant.\n\n\"Something troubles you, Polly, what is it? Confide in me, as I do in\nyou,\" said Fanny tenderly, for all the coldness she had tried to hide\nfrom Polly, had melted in the sudden sunshine that had come to her.\n\n\"Do you always?\" asked her friend, leaning forward with an irresistible\ndesire to win back the old-time love and confidence, too precious to be\nexchanged for a little brief excitement or the barren honor of \"bagging\na bird,\" to use Trix's elegant expression. Fanny understood it then,\nand threw herself into Polly's arms, crying, with a shower of grateful\ntears; \"Oh, my dear! my dear! did you do it for my sake?\"\n\nAnd Polly held her close, saying in that tender voice of hers, \"I did\nn't mean to let a lover part this pair of friends if I could help it.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. BREAKERS AHEAD\n\n\nGOING into the Shaws' one evening, Polly found Maud sitting on the\nstairs, with a troubled face.\n\n\"Oh, Polly, I'm so glad you've come!\" cried the little girl, running\nto hug her.\n\n\"What's the matter, deary?\"\n\n\"I don't know; something dreadful must have happened, for mamma and Fan\nare crying together upstairs, papa is shut up in the library, and Tom is\nraging round like a bear, in the dining-room.\"\n\n\"I guess it is n't anything very bad. Perhaps mamma is sicker than\nusual, or papa worried about business, or Tom in some new scrape. Don't\nlook so frightened, Maudie, but come into the parlor and see what I've\ngot for you,\" said Polly, feeling that there was trouble of some sort in\nthe air, but trying to cheer the child, for her little face was full of\na sorrowful anxiety, that went to Polly's heart.\n\n\"I don't think I can like anything till I know what the matter is,\"\nanswered Maud. \"It's something horrid, I'm sure, for when papa came\nhome, he went up to mamma's room, and talked ever so long, and mamma\ncried very loud, and when I tried to go in, Fan would n't let me, and\nshe looked scared and strange. I wanted to go to papa when he came down,\nbut the door was locked, and he said, 'Not now, my little girl,' and\nthen I sat here waiting to see what would happen, and Tom came home. But\nwhen I ran to tell him, he said, 'Go away, and don't bother,' and just\ntook me by the shoulders and put me out. Oh, dear! everything is so\nqueer and horrid, I don't know what to do.\"\n\nMaud began to cry, and Polly sat down on the stairs beside her, trying\nto comfort her, while her own thoughts were full of a vague fear. All\nat once the dining-room door opened, and Tom's head appeared. A single\nglance showed Polly that something was the matter, for the care and\nelegance which usually marked his appearance were entirely wanting. His\ntie was under one ear, his hair in a toss, the cherished moustache had\na neglected air, and his face an expression both excited, ashamed, and\ndistressed; even his voice betrayed disturbance, for instead of the\naffable greeting he usually bestowed upon the young lady, he seemed to\nhave fallen back into the bluff tone of his boyish days, and all he said\nwas, \"Hullo, Polly.\"\n\n\"How do you do?\" answered Polly.\n\n\"I'm in a devil of a mess, thank you; send that chicken up stairs, and\ncome in and hear about it,\" he said, as if he had been longing to tell\nsome one, and welcomed prudent Polly as a special providence.\n\n\"Go up, deary, and amuse yourself with this book, and these ginger snaps\nthat I made for you, there's a good child,\" whispered Polly, as Maud\nrubbed away her tears, and stared at Tom with round, inquisitive eyes.\n\n\"You'll tell me all about it, by and by, won't you?\" she whispered,\npreparing to obey.\n\n\"If I may,\" answered Polly.\n\nMaud departed with unexpected docility, and Polly went into the\ndining-room, where Tom was wandering about in a restless way. If he\nhad been \"raging like a bear,\" Polly would n't have cared, she was so\npleased that he wanted her, and so glad to be a confidante, as she used\nto be in the happy old days, that she would joyfully have faced a much\nmore formidable person than reckless Tom.\n\n\"Now, then, what is it?\" she said, coming straight to the point.\n\n\"Guess.\"\n\n\"You've killed your horse racing.\"\n\n\"Worse than that.\"\n\n\"You are suspended again.\"\n\n\"Worse than that.\"\n\n\"Trix has run away with somebody,\" cried Polly, with a gasp.\n\n\"Worse still.\"\n\n\"Oh, Tom, you have n't horse whipped or shot any one?\"\n\n\"Came pretty near blowing my own brains out but you see I did n't.\"\n\n\"I can't guess; tell me, quick.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm expelled.\"\n\nTom paused on the rug as he gave the answer, and looked at Polly to see\nhow she took it. To his surprise she seemed almost relieved, and after a\nminute silence, said, soberly, \"That's bad, very bad; but it might have\nbeen worse.\"\n\n\"It is worse;\" and Tom walked away again with a despairing sort of\ngroan.\n\n\"Don't knock the chairs about, but come and sit down, and tell me\nquietly.\"\n\n\"Can't do it.\"\n\n\"Well, go on, then. Are you truly expelled? Can't it be made up? What\ndid you do?\"\n\n\"It's a true bill this time. I just had a row with the Chapel watchman,\nand knocked him down. If it was a first offence, I might have got off;\nbut you see I've had no end of narrow escapes, and this was my last\nchance; I've lost it, and now there'll be the dickens to pay. I knew\nit was all up with me, so I did n't wait to be turned out, but just took\nmyself off.\"\n\n\"What will your father say?\"\n\n\"It will come hard on the governor, but the worst of it is\" there Tom\nstopped, and stood a minute in the middle of the room with his head\ndown, as if he did n't find it easy to tell even kind little Polly.\nThen out came the truth all in a breath, just as he used to bolt out his\nboyish misdemeanors, and then back up against the wall ready to take the\nconsequences.\n\n\"I owe an awful lot of money that the governor don't know about.\"\n\n\"Oh, Tom, how could you?\"\n\n\"I've been an extravagant rascal, I know it, and I'm thundering sorry,\nbut that don't help a fellow, I've got to tell the dear old buffer, and\nthere's where it cuts.\"\n\nAt another time Polly would have laughed at the contrast between Tom's\nface and his language, but there was a sincere remorse, which made even\nthe dreadful word \"buffer\" rather touching than otherwise.\n\n\"He will be very angry, I dare say; but he'll help you, won't he? He\nalways does, Fan says.\"\n\n\"That's the worst of it, you see. He's paid up so often, that the last\ntime he said his patience could n't stand it, nor his pocket either, and\nif I got into any more scrapes of that sort, I must get out as I could.\nI meant to be as steady as Bunker Hill Monument; but here I am again,\nworse than ever, for last quarter I did n't say anything to father, he\nwas so bothered by the loss of those ships just then, so things have\nmounted up confoundedly.\"\n\n\"What have you done with all your money?\"\n\n\"Hanged if I know.\"\n\n\"Can't you pay it anyway?\"\n\n\"Don't see how, as I have n't a cent of my own, and no way of getting\nit, unless I try gambling.\"\n\n\"Oh, mercy, no! Sell your horse,\" cried Polly, after a minute of deep\nmeditation.\n\n\"I have; but he did n't bring half I gave for him. I lamed him last\nwinter, and the beggar won't get over it.\"\n\n\"And that did n't pay up the debts?\"\n\n\"Only about a half of'em.\"\n\n\"Why, Tom, how much do you owe?\"\n\n\"I have dodged figuring it up till yesterday; then things were so\ndesperate, I thought I might as well face the truth, so I overhauled my\naccounts, and there's the result.\"\n\nTom threw a blotted, crumpled paper into Polly's lap, and tramped up\nand down again, faster than ever. Polly took one look at the total and\nclasped her hands, for to her inexperienced eyes it looked appalling.\n\n\"Tidy little sum, is n't it?\" asked Tom, who could n't bear the silence,\nor the startled, grieved look in Polly's eyes.\n\n\"It's awful! I don't wonder you dread telling your father.\"\n\n\"I'd rather be shot. I say, Polly, suppose we break it to him easy!\"\nadded Tom, after another turn.\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why, suppose Fan, or, better still, you go and sort of pave the way. I\ncan't bear to come down on him with the whole truth at once.\"\n\n\"So you'd like to have me go and tell him for you?\" Polly's lip curled\na little as she said that, and she gave Tom a look that would have\nshown him how blue eyes can flash, if he had seen it. But he was at the\nwindow, and did n't turn, as he said slowly, \"Well, you see, he's\nso fond of you; we all confide in you; and you are so like one of the\nfamily, that it seems quite natural. Just tell him I'm expelled, you\nknow, and as much more as you like; then I'll come in, and we'll have\nit out.\"\n\nPolly rose and went to the door without a word. In doing so, Tom caught\na glimpse of her face, and said, hastily, \"Don't you think it would be a\ngood plan?\"\n\n\"No, I don't.\"\n\n\"Why not? Don't you think he'd rather have it told him nicely by you,\nthan blurted out as I always do blurt things?\"\n\n\"I know he'd rather have his son go to him and tell the truth, like a\nman, instead of sending a girl to do what he is afraid to do himself.\"\n\nIf Polly had suddenly boxed his ears, Tom could n't have looked more\ntaken aback than by that burst. He looked at her excited face, seemed\nto understand the meaning of it, and remembered all at once that he was\ntrying to hide behind a girl. He turned scarlet, said shortly, \"Come\nback, Polly,\" and walked straight out of the room, looking as if going\nto instant execution, for poor Tom had been taught to fear his father,\nand had not entirely outgrown the dread.\n\nPolly sat down, looking both satisfied and troubled. \"I hope I did\nright,\" she said to herself, \"I could n't bear to have him shirk and\nseem cowardly. He is n't, only he did n't think how it seemed to me, and\nI don't wonder he was a little afraid, Mr. Shaw is so severe with the\npoor fellow. Oh, dear, what should we do if Will got into such scrapes.\nThank goodness, he's poor, and can't; I'm so glad of that!\"\n\nThen she sat silent beside the half-open door, hearing the murmur of\nTom's voice across the hall, and hoping, with all her heart, that he\nwould n't have a very hard time. He seemed to tell his story rapidly and\nsteadily, without interruption, to the end; then Polly heard Mr. Shaw's\ndeeper voice say a few words, at which Tom uttered a loud exclamation,\nas if taken by surprise. Polly could n't distinguish a word, so she kept\nher seat, wondering anxiously what was going on between the two men. A\nsudden pause seemed to follow Tom's ejaculation, then Mr. Shaw talked a\nlong time in a low, earnest tone, so different from the angry one Polly\nhad expected to hear, that it made her nervous, for Mr. Shaw usually\n\"blew Tom up first, and forgave him afterward,\" as Maud said. Presently\nTom's voice was heard, apparently asking eager questions, to which brief\nreplies were given. Then a dead silence fell upon the room, and nothing\nwas heard but the spring rain softly falling out of doors. All of a\nsudden she heard a movement, and Tom's voice say audibly, \"Let me bring\nPolly;\" and he appeared, looking so pale and miserable that Polly was\nfrightened.\n\n\"Go and say something to him; I can't; poor old father, if I'd only\nknown,\" and to Polly's utter dismay, Tom threw himself into a chair, and\nlaid his head down on the table, as if he had got a blow that was too\nmuch for him.\n\n\"Oh, Tom, what is it?\" cried Polly, hurrying to him, full of fears she\ndared not speak.\n\nWithout looking up, Tom answered, in a smothered voice, \"Failed; all\ngone to smash; and to-morrow every one will know it.\"\n\nPolly held on to the back of Tom's chair, for a minute, for the news\ntook her breath away, and she felt as if the world was coming to an end,\n\"failed\" was such a vaguely dreadful word to her.\n\n\"Is it very bad?\" she asked, softly, feeling as if anything was better\nthan to stand still and see Tom so wretched.\n\n\"Yes; he means to give up everything. He's done his best; but it can't\nbe staved off any longer, and it's all up with him.\"\n\n\"Oh, I wish I had a million to give him!\" cried Polly, clasping her\nhands, with the tears running down her cheeks. \"How does he bear it,\nTom?\"\n\n\"Like a man, Polly; and I'm proud of him,\" said Tom, looking up,\nall red and excited with the emotions he was trying to keep under.\n\"Everything has been against him, and he has fought all alone to stand\nthe pressure, but it's too much for him, and he's given in. It's an\nhonorable failure, mind you, and no one can say a word against him. I'd\nlike to see'em try it!\" and Tom clenched his hands, as if it would\nbe an immense relief to him to thrash half a dozen aspersers of his\nfather's honest name.\n\n\"Of course they can't! This is what poor Maud troubled about. He had\ntold your mother and Fan before you came, and that is why they are so\nunhappy, I suppose.\"\n\n\"They are safe enough. Father has n't touched mother's money; he'could\nn't rob his girls,' he said, and that's all safe for'em. Is n't he\na trump, Polly?\" And Tom's face shone with pride, even while his lips\nwould twitch with a tenderer feeling.\n\n\"If I could only do anything to help,\" cried Polly, oppressed with her\nown powerlessness.\n\n\"You can. Go and be good to him; you know how; he needs it enough, all\nalone there. I can't do it, for I'm only a curse instead of a comfort\nto him.\"\n\n\"How did he take your news?\" asked Polly, who, for a time, had forgotten\nthe lesser trouble in the greater.\n\n\"Like a lamb; for when I'd done, he only said, 'My poor lad, we must\nbear with one another.' and then told his story.\"\n\n\"I'm glad he was kind,\" began Polly, in a soothing tone; but Tom cried\nout, remorsefully, \"That's what knocks me over! Just when I ought to\nbe a pride and a prop to him, I bring him my debts and disgrace, and he\nnever says a word of blame. It's no use, I can't stand it!\" and Tom's\nhead went down again with something very like a sob, that would come\nin spite of manful efforts to keep it back, for the poor fellow had the\nwarmest heart that ever was, and all the fine waistcoats outside could\nn't spoil it.\n\nThat sound gave Polly more pain than the news of a dozen failures and\nexpulsions, and it was as impossible for her to resist putting her\nhand tenderly on the bent head, as it was for her to help noticing with\npleasure how brown the little curls were growing, and how soft they\nwere. In spite of her sorrow, she enjoyed that minute very much, for she\nwas a born consoler, and, it is hardly necessary for me to add, loved\nthis reprehensible Tom with all her heart. It was a very foolish thing\nfor her to do, she quite agreed to that; she could n't understand it,\nexplain it, or help it; she only felt that she did care for him very\nmuch, in spite of his faults, his indifference, and his engagement. You\nsee, she learned to love him one summer, when he made them a visit. That\nwas before Trix caught him; and when she heard that piece of news, Polly\ncould n't unlove him all at once, though she tried very hard, as was her\nduty. That engagement was such a farce, that she never had much faith\nin it, so she put her love away in a corner of her heart, and tried to\nforget it, hoping it would either die, or have a right to live. It did\nn't make her very miserable, because patience, work, and common-sense\nlent her a hand, and hope would keep popping up its bright face from the\nbottom of her Pandora-box of troubles. Now and then, when any one said\nTrix would n't jilt Tom, or that Tom did care for Trix more than he\nshould, Polly had a pang, and thought she could n't possibly bear it.\nBut she always found she could, and so came to the conclusion that it\nwas a merciful provision of nature that girls' hearts could stand\nso much, and their appetites continue good, when unrequited love was\nstarving.\n\nNow, she could not help yearning over this faulty, well-beloved\nscapegrace Tom, or help thinking, with a little thrill of hope, \"If Trix\nonly cared for his money, she may cast him off now he's lost it; but I\n'll love him all the better because he's poor.\" With this feeling warm\nat her heart, I don't wonder that Polly's hand had a soothing effect,\nand that after a heave or two, Tom's shoulders were quiet, and certain\nsmothered sniffs suggested that he would be all right again, if he could\nonly wipe his eyes without any one's seeing him do it.\n\nPolly seemed to divine his wish, and tucking a little, clean\nhandkerchief into one of his half-open hands, she said, \"I'm going to\nyour father, now,\" and with a farewell smooth, so comforting that Tom\nwished she'd do it again, she went away.\n\nAs she paused a minute in the hall to steady herself, Maud called her\nfrom above, and thinking that the women might need her more than the\nmen, she ran up to find Fanny waiting for her in her own room.\n\n\"Mamma's asleep, quite worn out, poor dear, so we can talk in here\nwithout troubling her,\" said Fanny, receiving her friend so quietly,\nthat Polly was amazed.\n\n\"Let me come, too, I won't make any fuss; it's so dreadful to be shut\nout everywhere, and have people crying and talking, and locked up, and I\nnot know what it means,\" said Maud, beseechingly.\n\n\"You do know, now; I've told her, Polly,\" said Fan, as they sat down\ntogether, and Maud perched herself on the bed, so that she might retire\namong the pillows if her feelings were too much for her.\n\n\"I'm glad you take it so well, dear; I was afraid it might upset you,\"\nsaid Polly, seeing now that in spite of her quiet manner, Fan's eyes had\nan excited look, and her cheeks a feverish color.\n\n\"I shall groan and moan by and by, I dare say, but at first it sort of\ndazed me, and now it begins to excite me. I ought to be full of sorrow\nfor poor papa, and I am truly sorry, but, wicked as it may seem, it's a\nfact, Polly, that I'm half glad it's happened, for it takes me out of\nmyself, and gives me something to do.\"\n\nFanny's eyes fell and her color rose as she spoke, but Polly understood\nwhy she wanted to forget herself, and put her arm round her with a more\ntender sympathy than Fanny guessed.\n\n\"Perhaps things are not as bad as they seem; I don't know much about\nsuch matters, but I've seen people who have failed, and they seemed\njust as comfortable as before,\" said Polly.\n\n\"It won't be so with us, for papa means to give up everything, and not\nhave a word said against him. Mamma's little property is settled upon\nher, and has n't been risked. That touched her so much! She dreads\npoverty even more than I do, but she begged him to take it if it would\nhelp him. That pleased him, but he said nothing would induce him to\ndo it, for it would n't help much, and was hardly enough to keep her\ncomfortable.\"\n\n\"Do you know what he means to do?\" asked Polly, anxiously.\n\n\"He said his plans were not made, but he meant to go into the little\nhouse that belonged to grandma, as soon as he could, for it was n't\nhonest for a bankrupt to keep up an establishment like this.\"\n\n\"I shan't mind that at all, I like the little house'cause it's got a\ngarden, and there's a cunning room with a three-cornered closet in it\nthat I always wanted. If that's all, I don't think bankrupting is so\nvery bad,\" said Maud, taking a cheerful view of things.\n\n\"Ah, just wait till the carriage goes and the nice clothes and the\nservants, and we have to scratch along as we can. You'll change\nyour mind then, poor child,\" said Fanny, whose ideas of failure were\ndecidedly tragical.\n\n\"Will they take all my things away?\" cried Maud, in dismay.\n\n\"I dare say; I don't know what we are allowed to keep; but not much,\nI fancy,\" and Fan looked as if strung up to sacrifice everything she\npossessed.\n\n\"They shan't have my new ear-rings, I'll hide'em, and my best dress,\nand my gold smelling bottle. Oh, oh, oh! I think it's mean to take a\nlittle girl's things away!\" And Maud dived among the pillows to smother\na wail of anguish at the prospect of being bereft of her treasures.\n\nPolly soon lured her out again, by assurances that she would n't be\nutterly despoiled, and promises to try and soften the hard hearts of\nher father's creditors, if the ear-rings and the smelling-bottle were\nattached.\n\n\"I wonder if we shall be able to keep one servant, just till we learn\nhow to do the work,\" said Fanny, looking at her white hands, with a\nsigh.\n\nBut Maud clapped hers, and gave a joyful bounce, as she cried, \"Now I\ncan learn to cook! I love so to beat eggs! I'll have an apron, with\na bib to it, like Polly's, and a feather duster, and sweep the stairs,\nmaybe, with my head tied up, like Katy. Oh, what fun!\"\n\n\"Don't laugh at her, or discourage her; let her find comfort in bibs and\ndust-pans, if she can,\" whispered Polly to Fan, while Maud took a joyful\n\"header\" among the pillows, and came up smiling and blowzy, for she\nloved house-work, and often got lectured for stolen visits to the\nkitchen, and surreptitious sweepings and dustings when the coast was\nclear.\n\n\"Mamma is so feeble, I shall have to keep house, I suppose, and you must\nshow me how, Polly,\" said Fan.\n\n\"Good practice, ma'am, as you'll find out some day,\" answered Polly,\nlaughing significantly.\n\nFanny smiled, then grew both grave and sad. \"This changes everything;\nthe old set will drop me, as we did the Mertons when their father\nfailed, and my'prospects,' as we say, are quite ruined.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it; your real friends won't drop you, and you'll find\nout which the true ones are now. I know one friend who will be kinder\nthan ever.\"\n\n\"Oh, Polly, do you think so?\" and Fanny's eyes softened with sudden\ntears.\n\n\"I know who she means,\" cried Maud, always eager to find out things. \"It\n's herself; Polly won't mind if we are poor,'cause she likes beggars.\"\n\n\"Is that who you meant?\" asked Fan, wistfully.\n\n\"No, it's a much better and dearer friend than I am,\" said Polly,\npinching Fanny's cheek, as it reddened prettily under her eyes. \"You'll\nnever guess, Maud, so I would n't try, but be planning what you will put\nin your cunning, three-cornered closet, when you get it.\"\n\nHaving got rid of \"Miss Paulina Pry,\" as Tom called Maud, who was\nimmediately absorbed by her cupboard, the older girls soberly discussed\nthe sudden change which had come, and Polly was surprised to see what\nunexpected strength and sense Fanny showed. Polly was too unconscious\nof the change which love had made in herself to understand at first the\ncause of her friend's new patience and fortitude; but she rejoiced over\nit, and felt that her prophecy would yet be fulfilled. Presently Maud\nemerged from her new closet, bringing a somewhat startling idea with\nher.\n\n\"Do bankrupting men\" (Maud liked that new word) \"always have fits?\"\n\n\"Mercy, no! What put that into your head, child?\" cried Polly.\n\n\"Why, Mr. Merton did; and I was thinking perhaps papa had got one down\nthere, and it kind of frightened me.\"\n\n\"Mr. Merton's was a bad, disgraceful failure, and I don't wonder he had\na fit. Ours is n't, and papa won't do anything of that sort, you may be\nsure,\" said Fanny, with as proud an air as if \"our failure\" was rather\nan honor than otherwise.\n\n\"Don't you think you and Maud had better go down and see him?\" asked\nPolly.\n\n\"Perhaps he would n't like it; and I don't know what to say, either,\"\nbegan Fan; but Polly said, eagerly, \"I know he would like it. Never mind\nwhat you say; just go, and show him that you don't doubt or blame him\nfor this, but love him all the more, and are ready and glad to help him\nbear the trouble.\"\n\n\"I'm going, I ain't afraid; I'll just hug him, and say I'm ever so\nglad we are going to the little house,\" cried Maud, scrambling off the\nbed, and running down stairs.\n\n\"Come with me, Polly, and tell me what to do,\" said Fanny, drawing her\nfriend after her.\n\n\"You'll know what to do when you see him, better than I can tell you,\"\nanswered Polly, readily yielding, for she knew they considered her\n\"quite one of the family,\" as Tom said.\n\nAt the study door they found Maud, whose courage had given out, for Mr.\nMerton's fit rather haunted her. Polly opened the door; and the minute\nFanny saw her father, she did know what to do. The fire was low, the gas\ndim, and Mr. Shaw was sitting in his easy-chair, his gray head in both\nhis hands, looking lonely, old, and bowed down with care. Fanny gave\nPolly one look, then went and took the gray head in both her arms,\nsaying, with a tender quiver in her voice, \"Father dear, we've come to\nhelp you bear it.\"\n\nMr. Shaw looked up, and seeing in his daughter's face something that\nnever had been there before, put his arm about her, and leaned his\ntired head against her, as if, when least expected, he had found the\nconsolation he most needed. In that minute, Fanny felt, with mingled joy\nand self-reproach, what a daughter might be to her father; and Polly,\nthinking of feeble, selfish Mrs. Shaw, asleep up stairs, saw with\nsudden clearness what a wife should be to her husband, a helpmeet, not\na burden. Touched by these unusual demonstrations, Maud crept quietly\nto her father's knee, and whispered, with a great tear shining on her\nlittle pug nose, \"Papa, we don't mind it much, and I'm going to help\nFan keep house for you; I'd like to do it, truly.\"\n\nMr. Shaw's other arm went round the child, and for a minute no one said\nanything, for Polly had slipped behind his chair, that nothing should\ndisturb the three, who were learning from misfortune how much they loved\none another. Presently Mr. Shaw steadied himself and asked, \"Where is my\nother daughter, where's my Polly?\"\n\nShe was there at once; gave him one of the quiet kisses that had more\nthan usual tenderness in it, for she loved to hear him say \"my other\ndaughter,\" and then she whispered, \"Don't you want Tom, too?\"\n\n\"Of course I do; where is the poor fellow?\"\n\n\"I'll bring him;\" and Polly departed with most obliging alacrity.\n\nBut in the hall she paused a minute to peep into the glass and see if\nshe was all right, for somehow she was more anxious to look neat and\npretty to Tom in his hour of trouble than she had ever been in his\nprosperous days. In lifting her arms to perk up the bow at her throat\nshe knocked a hat off the bracket. Now, a shiny black beaver is not an\nobject exactly calculated to inspire tender or romantic sentiments, one\nwould fancy, but that particular \"stove pipe\" seemed to touch Polly to\nthe heart, for she caught it up, as if its fall suggested a greater one,\nsmoothed out a slight dint, as if it was symbolical of the hard knocks\nits owner's head was now in danger of receiving, and stood looking at\nit with as much pity and respect, as if it had been the crown of a\ndisinherited prince. Girls will do such foolish little things, and\nthough we laugh at them, I think we like them the better for it, after\nall.\n\nRichard was himself again when Polly entered, for the handkerchief had\ndisappeared, his head was erect, his face was steady, and his whole\nair had a dogged composure which seemed to say to fate, \"Hit away, I'm\nready.\" He did not hear Polly come in, for he was looking fixedly at\nthe fire with eyes that evidently saw a very different future there\nfrom that which it used to show him; but when she said, \"Tom, dear, your\nfather wants you,\" he got up at once, held out his hand to her, saying,\n\"Come too, we can't get on without you,\" and took her back into the\nstudy with him.\n\nThen they had a long talk, for the family troubles seemed to warm and\nstrengthen the family affection and confidence, and as the young people\nlistened while Mr. Shaw told them as much of his business perplexities\nas they could understand, every one of them blamed him or herself for\ngoing on so gayly and blindly, while the storm was gathering, and the\npoor man was left to meet it all alone. Now, however, the thunder-clap\nhad come, and after the first alarm, finding they were not killed, they\nbegan to discover a certain half-anxious, half-pleasant excitement\nin talking it over, encouraging one another, and feeling unusually\nfriendly, as people do when a sudden shower drives two or three to the\nshelter of one umbrella.\n\nIt was a sober talk, but not all sad, for Mr. Shaw felt inexpressibly\ncomforted by his children's unexpected sympathy, and they, trying to\ntake the downfall cheerfully for his sake, found it easier to bear\nthemselves. They even laughed occasionally, for the girls, in their\nignorance, asked queer questions; Tom made ludicrously unbusiness-like\npropositions; and Maud gave them one hearty peal, that did a world of\ngood, by pensively remarking, when the plans for the future had been\nexplained to her, \"I'm so relieved; for when papa said we must give up\neverything, and mamma called us all beggars, I did think I'd got to go\nround asking for cold vittles, with a big basket, and an old shawl over\nmy head. I said once I'd like that, but I'm afraid I should n't, for I\ncan't bear Indian cake and cold potatoes, that's what the poor children\nalways seem to get, and I should hate to have Grace and the rest see me\nscuffing round the back gates.\"\n\n\"My little girl shall never come to that, if I can help it,\" said Mr.\nShaw, holding her close, with a look that made Maud add, as she laid her\ncheek against his own, \"But I'd do it, father, if you asked me to, for\nI truly want to help.\"\n\n\"So do I!\" cried Fanny, wondering at the same minute how it would seem\nto wear turned silks, and clean her gloves.\n\nTom said nothing, but drew toward him a paper of figures which his\nfather had drawn up, and speedily reduced himself to the verge of\ndistraction by trying to understand them, in his ardent desire to prove\nhis willingness to put his shoulder to the wheel.\n\n\"We shall pull through, children, so don't borrow trouble, only be ready\nfor discomforts and annoyances. Put your pride in your pockets, and\nremember poverty is n't disgraceful, but dishonesty is.\"\n\nPolly had always loved kind Mr. Shaw, but now she respected him\nheartily, and felt that she had not done him justice when she sometimes\nthought that he only cared for making money.\n\n\"I should n't wonder if this was a good thing for the whole family,\nthough it don't look so. Mrs. Shaw will take it the hardest, but it may\nstir her up, so she will forget her nerves, and be as busy and happy as\nmother is,\" said Polly to herself, in a hopeful mood, for poverty was an\nold friend, and she had learned long ago not to fear it, but to take its\nbitter and its sweet, and make the best of both.\n\nWhen they parted for the night, Polly slipped away first, to leave them\nfree, yet could n't help lingering outside to see how tenderly the girls\nparted from their father. Tom had n't a word to say for himself, for men\ndon't kiss, caress, or cry when they feel most, and all he could do to\nexpress his sympathy and penitence, was to wring his father's hand with\na face full of respect, regret, and affection, and then bolt up stairs\nas if the furies were after him, as they were, in a mild and modern\nform.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. A DRESS PARADE\n\n\nTHE weeks that followed taught the Shaws, as many other families have\nbeen taught, how rapidly riches take to themselves wings and fly away,\nwhen they once begin to go. Mr. Shaw carried out his plans with an\nenergy and patience that worked wonders, and touched the hearts of his\nhardest creditors. The big house was given up as soon as possible and\nthe little house taken; being made comfortable with the furniture Madam\nleft there when she went to live with her son. The old-fashioned things\nhad been let with the house, and now seemed almost like a gift from\nGrandma, doubly precious in these troublous times. At the auction,\nseveral persons tried to show the family that, though they had lost\ntheir fortune, friends still remained, for one bid in Fanny's piano,\nand sent it to her; another secured certain luxurious articles for Mrs.\nShaw's comfort; and a third saved such of Mr. Shaw's books as he valued\nmost, for he had kept his word and given up everything, with the most\npunctilious integrity. So the little house was not bare, but made\npleasant to their eyes by these waifs from the wreck, brought them by\nthe tide of sympathy and good-will which soon set in. Everybody who\nknew them hastened to call, many from a real regard, but more from mere\ncuriosity to \"see how they took it.\" This was one of the hardest things\nthey had to bear, and Tom used strong language more than once, when some\nfine lady came to condole, and went away to gossip. Polly's hopes of\nMrs. Shaw were disappointed, for misfortune did not have a bracing\neffect. She took to her bed at once, received her friends in tears and a\npoint-lace cap, and cheered her family by plaintively inquiring when she\nwas to be taken to the almshouse. This was hard for Fanny; but after\nan interval of despair, she came to the conclusion that under the\ncircumstances it was the best thing her mother could have done, and\nwith something of her father's energy, Fanny shouldered the new burden,\nfeeling that at last necessity had given her what she had long needed,\nsomething to do.\n\nThe poor girl knew as much of household affairs as Snip; but pride and\nthe resolution \"to stand by Father,\" kept up her courage, and she worked\naway with feverish activity at whatever task came first till, just as\nstrength and heart were about to fail, order began to emerge from chaos\nand the vision of a home made happy and comfortable by her skill and\ncare came to repay and sustain her.\n\nMaud, being relieved from the fear of back-door beggary, soon became\nreconciled to bankruptcy; thought it rather a good joke, on the whole,\nfor children like novelty, and don't care much for Mrs. Grundy. She\nregarded the new abode as a baby house on a large scale, where she\nwas allowed to play her part in the most satisfactory manner. From the\nmoment when, on taking possession of the coveted room, she opened the\ndoors of the three-cornered closet, and found a little kettle just like\nPolly's, standing there, she felt that a good time was coming for her\nand fell to dusting furniture, washing cups, and making toast, the\nhappiest, fussiest little housewife in the city. For Maud inherited the\nnotable gifts of her grandmother, and would have made a capital farmer's\ndaughter, in spite of her city breeding.\n\nPolly came and went through all these changes, faithful, helpful, and\nas cheery as she could be when her friends were in trouble. The parts\nseemed reversed now, and it was Polly who gave, Fanny who received; for\nwhere everything seemed strange and new to Fan, Polly was quite at home,\nand every one of the unfashionable domestic accomplishments now came\ninto play, to the comfort of the Shaws, and the great satisfaction of\nPolly. She could not do enough to prove her gratitude for former favors,\nand went toiling and moiling about, feeling that the hardest, most\ndisagreeable tasks were her especial duty. In the moving nothing suited\nher better than to trot up and down, lugging heavy things, to pound her\nfingers black and blue nailing carpets and curtains, and the day she\nnearly broke her neck tumbling down the cellar stairs, in her eagerness\nto see that Mrs. Shaw's wine was rightly stored, she felt that she was\nonly paying her debts, and told Tom she liked it, when he picked her up\nlooking as grimy as a chimney-sweep.\n\n\"You can turn your hand to anything, you clever girl, so do come and\ngive me some advice, for I am in the depths of despair,\" said Fanny when\nthe \"maid-of-all-work\" as Polly called herself, found a leisure hour.\n\n\"What is it? Moths in the furs, a smoky chimney, or small-pox next\ndoor?\" asked Polly, as they entered Fan's room, where Maud was trying on\nold bonnets before the looking-glass.\n\n\"Actually I have nothing to wear,\" began Fan impressively; \"I've been\ntoo busy to think or care till now, but here it is nearly May and I have\nhardly a decent rag to my back. Usually, you know, I just go to Mrs.\nO'Grady and tell her what I want; she makes my spring wardrobe, Papa\npays the bill, and there I am. Now I've looked into the matter, and I\ndeclare to you, Polly, I'm frightened to see how much it costs to dress\nme.\"\n\n\"Not so much as some girls I know,\" said Polly encouragingly.\n\n\"Perhaps not, for I have a conscience, and taste is economy sometimes;\nbut really, Polly, I have n't the heart to ask Papa for a cent just\nnow, and yet I must have clothes. You are such a genius for planning and\nworking wonders, that I throw myself upon you and ask, 'How shall I make\na spring wardrobe out of nothing?'\"\n\n\"Let me see the'nothing' before I advise. Bring out every rag you've\ngot, and we'll see what can be done,\" said Polly, looking as if she\nenjoyed the prospect, for she had a great deal of that feminine faculty\nwhich we call \"knack,\" and much practice had increased it.\n\nFanny brought out her \"rags\" and was astonished to see how many she had,\nfor chair, sofa, bed, and bureau were covered, and still Maud, who was\nburrowing in the closets, kept crying, \"Here's another.\"\n\n\"There's a discouraging heap of rubbish for you!\" said Fan, as she\nadded a faded muslin to the last pile.\n\n\"Now, to me your'rubbish' looks very encouraging, because there is good\nmaterial there, and not much worn-out finery, that's my detestation,\nfor you can't do anything with it. Let me see, five bonnets. Put the\nwinter ones away till autumn, rip up the summer ones, and out of three\nold ones we'll get a pretty new one, if my eyes don't deceive me.\"\n\n\"I'll rip, and then do let me see you make a bonnet, it must be so\ninteresting,\" said Maud, whipping out her scissors and eagerly beginning\nto reduce a shabby little bonnet to its original elements. \"Now the\ndresses,\" continued Polly, who had rapidly sorted out the piles.\n\n\"Will you have the goodness to look at this?\" said Fan, holding up a\ngray street suit faded past cure.\n\nPolly whisked it wrong side out, and showing the clean, bright fabric,\nsaid, with a triumphant wave, \"Behold your new suit; fresh trimming and\nless of it will finish you off as smart as ever.\"\n\n\"I never wore a turned dress in my life; do you suppose people will know\nit?\" said Fan doubtfully.\n\n\"What if they do? It won't hurt you. Not one in a hundred will ever\nthink anything about your dress, except that it is pretty. I've worn\nturned and dyed gowns all my days, and it don't seem to have alienated\nmy friends, or injured my constitution.\"\n\n\"That it has n't; I'm a goose, Polly, and I'll get over the feeling\nthat it's sort of disgraceful to be poor and have to economize. We'll\nturn the gray, and I'll wear it bravely.\"\n\n\"Then it will be more becoming than ever. Oh, here's the pretty violet\nsilk. That will make a lovely suit,\" cried Polly, going on with the\nreview.\n\n\"Don't see how two draggled skirts and a stained waist can be\ntransformed into a whole rig,\" said Fan, sitting on the bed, with her\ngarments strewn about her in various attitudes of limp despondency.\n\n\"Well, ma'am, my plan is this,\" began Polly, imitating Mrs. O'Grady's\nimportant tone, and bad grammar: \"Gores is out, and plaits is in;\ntherefore, as the top of this skirt is quite fresh, we will take off the\nruffles, turn it upside down, and leave it plain. The upper skirt\nwill be made scanter, and finished with a frill; then the waist can be\nrefreshed with the best parts of these wide flounces, and out of those\nnew bits we will concoct a hat. The black lace Maud has just taken\noff the green one will do to edge the violet, and with your nice silk\nmantilla you are complete, don't you see?\"\n\n\"I don't quite see it yet, but I have firm faith that I shall in time,\nand consider my calling costume finished,\" said Fanny, getting more and\nmore interested as she saw her condemned wardrobe coming out fresh again\nunder Polly's magic knack.\n\n\"There are two; then that piqu, is all right, if you cut the tail off\nthe jacket and change the trimming a bit. The muslins only need mending\nand doing up to look as well as ever; you ought not to put them away\ntorn and soiled, my child. The two black silks will be good stand-bys\nfor years. If I were you, I'd have a couple of neat, pretty prints for\nhome-wear, and then I don't see why you are n't fixed well enough for\nour short season.\"\n\n\"Can't I do anything with this barege? It's one of my favorite dresses,\nand I hate to give it up.\"\n\n\"You wore that thoroughly out, and it's only fit for the rag-bag. Yes,\nit was very pretty and becoming, I remember, but its day is over.\"\n\nFanny let the dress lie in her lap a minute as she absently picked at\nthe fringe, smiling to herself over the happy time when she wore it last\nand Sydney said she only needed cowslips in her lap to look like spring.\nPresently she folded it up and put it away with a sigh, but it never\nwent into the rag-bag, and my sentimental readers can understand what\nsaved it.\n\n\"The ball dresses had better be put nicely away till next year,\" began\nPolly, coming to a rainbow colored heap.\n\n\"My day is over, I shall never use them again. Do what you like with\nthem,\" said Fan calmly.\n\n\"Did you ever sell your cast-off finery, as many ladies do?\" asked\nPolly.\n\n\"Never; I don't like the fashion. I give it away, or let Maud have it\nfor tableaux.\"\n\n\"I wonder if you would mind my telling you something Belle proposed?\"\n\n\"If it's an offer to buy my clothes, I should mind,\" answered Fanny,\nsharply.\n\n\"Then I won't,\" and Polly retired behind a cloud of arsenic-green gauze,\nwhich made her look as if she had the cholera.\n\n\"If she wanted to buy that horrid new'gooseberry-colored gown,' as\nTom calls it, I'd let her have it cheap,\" put in Maud, who was of a\npractical turn.\n\n\"Does she want it, Polly?\" asked Fan, whose curiosity got the better of\nher pride.\n\n\"Well, she merely asked me if I thought you'd be mortally offended,\nif she offered to take it off your hands, as you'd never worn it. You\ndon't like it, and in another season it will be all out of fashion,\"\nsaid Polly from her verdant retreat.\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n\"I saw she meant it kindly, so I said I'd ask. Now between ourselves,\nFan, the price of that dress would give you all you'll want for your\nspring fixings, that's one consideration; then here's another, which\nmay have some weight with you,\" added Polly slyly. \"Trix told Belle she\nwas going to ask you for the dress, as you would n't care to wear it\nnow. That made Belle fire up, and say it was a mean thing to do without\noffering some return for a costly thing like that; and then Belle said,\nin her blunt way, 'I'll give Fan all she paid for it, and more, too, if\nit will be any help to her. I don't care for the dress, but I'd like to\nslip a little money into her pocket, for I know she needs it and is too\ngood to ask dear Mr. Shaw for anything she can get on without.'\"\n\n\"Did she say that? I'll give her the dress, and not take a penny for\nit,\" cried Fan, flushing up with mingled anger toward Trix and gratitude\nto Belle.\n\n\"That won't suit her; you let me manage it, and don't feel any shame or\nanxiety about it. You did many a kind and generous thing for Belle when\nyou had the power, and you liked to do it; now let her pay her debts,\nand have the same pleasure.\"\n\n\"If she looks at it in that way, it makes a difference. Perhaps I'd\nbetter the money would be an immense help only I don't quite like to\ntake it.\"\n\n\"Kings and queens sell their jewels when times are hard or they get\nturned off their thrones, and no one thinks it anything amiss, so\nwhy need you? It's just a little transaction between two friends who\nexchange things they don't want for things which they do, and I'd do it\nif I were you.\"\n\n\"We'll see about it,\" said Fan, privately resolving to take Polly's\nadvice.\n\n\"If I had lots of things like Fan, I'd have an auction and get all\nI could for them. Why don't you?\" asked Maud, beginning on her third\nbonnet.\n\n\"We will,\" said Polly, and mounting a chair, she put up, bid in, and\nknocked down Fan's entire wardrobe to an imaginary group of friends,\nwith such droll imitations of each one that the room rang with laughter.\n\n\"That's enough nonsense; now we'll return to business,\" said Polly,\ndescending breathless but satisfied with the effect of her fun.\n\n\"These white muslins and pretty silks will keep for years, so I should\nlay them by till they are needed. It will save buying, and you can go to\nyour stock any time and make over what you want. That's the way Mother\ndoes; we've always had things sent us from richer friends, and whatever\nwas n't proper for us to wear at the time, Mother put away to be used\nwhen we needed it. Such funny bundles as we used to have sometimes, odd\nshoes, bonnets without crowns, stockings without heels or toes, and old\nfinery of all sorts. We used to rush when a bundle came, and sit round\nwhile Mother opened it. The boys always made fun of the things, though\nthey were as grateful, really, as any of us. Will made a verse one day\nwhich we thought pretty well for a little chap: 'To poor country folks\nWho have n't any clothes, Rich folks, to relieve them, Send old lace\ngowns and satin bows.'\"\n\n\"I think that Will is going to be as nice a poet as Mr. Shakespeare,\"\nremarked Maud in a tone of serious conviction.\n\n\"He is already a Milton; but I don't believe he will ever be anything\nbut a poet in name,\" said Polly, working away while she talked.\n\n\"Did n't your mother ever let you wear the nice things that came?\" asked\nMaud.\n\n\"No, she thought it was n't the thing for a poor minister's girls to go\nflourishing about in second-hand finery, so she did what I'm doing now,\nput away what would be useful and proper for us by and by, and let us\nplay with the shabby, silk bonnets and dirty, flounced gowns. Such fun\nas we used to have up in our big garret! I remember one day we'd been\nplaying have a ball, and were all rigged up, even the boys. Some new\nneighbors came to call, and expressed a wish to see us, having been told\nthat we were pattern children. Mother called us, but we had paraded out\ninto the garden, after our ball, and were having a concert, as we sat\nabout on the cabbages for green satin seats, so we did n't hear the\ncall, and just as the company was going, a great noise arrested them\non the doorstep, and round the corner of the house rattled Ned in\nfull costume, wheeling Kitty in a barrow, while Jimmy, Will, and I ran\nscreaming after, looking like Bedlamites; for we were playing that Lady\nFitz Perkins had fainted, and was being borne home senseless in a cab.\nI thought mother would kill herself with laughing; and you can imagine\nwhat a fine impression the strangers received of the model children.\"\n\nMaud was so tickled with this youthful prank that she unguardedly sat\ndown to laugh on the edge of an open trunk, immediately doubled up, fell\nin, and was with difficulty extricated.\n\n\"People in the country have great deal nicer times than we do. I never\nrode in a wheelbarrow, I never sat on cabbages, and I don't think it's\nfair,\" she said with an injured expression. \"You need n't save any old\nsilk gowns for me; I don't mean to be a fine lady when I grow up, I'm\ngoing to be a farmer's wife, and make butter and cheese, and have ten\nchildren, and raise pigs,\" she added in one enthusiastic burst.\n\n\"I do believe she will if she can find a farmer anywhere,\" said Fanny.\n\n\"Oh, I'm going to have Will; I asked him and he said, 'All right.' He\n's going to preach Sundays, and work on the farm the rest of the time.\nWell, he is, so you need n't laugh, for we've made all our plans,\"\nsaid Maud with comical dignity as she tried the effect of an old white\nbonnet, wondering if farmers' wives could wear ostrich feathers when\nthey went to meeting.\n\n\"Blessed innocence! Don't you wish you were a child, and dared tell what\nyou want?\" murmured Fanny.\n\n\"I wish I had seen Will's face when Maud proposed,\" answered Polly, with\na nod which answered her friend's speech better than her words.\n\n\"Any news of anybody?\" whispered Fan, affecting to examine a sleeve with\ncare.\n\n\"Still at the South; don't think late events have been reported yet;\nthat accounts for absence,\" answered Polly.\n\n\"I think Sir Philip was hit harder than was supposed,\" said Fan.\n\n\"I doubt it, but time cures wounds of that sort amazing quick.\"\n\n\"Wish it did!\"\n\n\"Who is Sir Philip?\" demanded Maud, pricking up her ears.\n\n\"A famous man who lived in the time of Queen Elizabeth,\" answered Fan,\nwith a look at Polly.\n\n\"Oh!\" And Maud seemed satisfied, but the sharp child had her suspicions\nnevertheless.\n\n\"There will be an immense deal of work in all this fixing over and I\nhate to sew,\" said Fanny, to divert a certain person's thoughts.\n\n\"Jenny and I are going to help. We are your debtors, as well as Belle,\nand demand the privilege of paying up. Blessings, like curses, come home\nto roost, Fan.\"\n\n\"Mine come home a good deal bigger than they went,\" answered Fanny,\nlooking pleased that little favors should be so faithfully remembered.\n\n\"The interest on that sort of investment rolls up beautifully, you know.\nNow rip that dress for Jenny to put in order, and I'll toss you up a\nbonnet in less than no time,\" said Polly, determined to have things go\nsmoothly, for she knew Fan's feelings had been a good deal tried lately,\nin many ways.\n\n\"I must have something to match my dress, and blue inside,\" said Fanny,\nbringing out her ribbon boxes.\n\n\"Anything you like, my dear; when it comes to bonnets, I am usually\ninspired. I have it! There we are! And nothing could be nicer,\" cried\nPolly, making a dive among the silks Fan was turning over with a lost\nexpression. \"This bit of silver-gray is all I ask, here's enough for\na killing bonnet, and those forget-me-nots are both pretty and\nappropriate.\"\n\n\"You wretch, be still!\" cried Fanny, as Polly looked up at her with a\nwicked laugh in her eyes.\n\n\"It will be done in time, and the dress likewise, so look your\nprettiest, and accept my blessing,\" continued Polly, seeing that Fan\nliked her raillery.\n\n\"Time for what?\" asked Paulina Pry.\n\n\"Your wedding, dear,\" sweetly answered Fan, for Polly's pleasant hints\nand predictions put her in a charming humor, and even made old clothes\nof little consequence.\n\nMaud gave an incredulous sniff, and wondered why \"big girls need to be\nso dreadful mysterious about their old secrets.\"\n\n\"This silk reminds me of Kitty's performance last summer. A little\nchecked silk was sent in our spring bundle from Mrs. Davenport, and\nMother said Kit might have it if she could make it do. So I washed it\nnicely, and we fussed and planned, but it came short by half of one\nsleeve. I gave it up, but Kit went to work and matched every scrap that\nwas left so neatly that she got out the half sleeve, put it on the under\nside, and no one was the wiser. How many pieces do you think she put in,\nMaud?\"\n\n\"Fifty,\" was the wise reply.\n\n\"No, only ten, but that was pretty well for a fourteen-year-old\ndressmaker. You ought to have seen the little witch laugh in her sleeve\nwhen any one admired the dress, for she wore it all summer and looked as\npretty as a pink in it. Such things are great fun when you get used to\nthem; besides, contriving sharpens your wits, and makes you feel as if\nyou had more hands than most people.\"\n\n\"I think we'll get a farm near your house; I should like to know\nKitty,\" said Maud, feeling a curious interest in a girl who made such\npeculiar patchwork.\n\n\"The dress-parade is over, and I'm ever so much obliged to you, Polly,\nfor helping me through, and showing me how to make the best of things.\nI hope in time to have as many hands as you,\" said Fan gratefully,\nwhen the simple bonnet was done and everything planned out ready to be\nfinished.\n\n\"I hope you will soon have two good, strong ones beside your own, my\ndear,\" answered Polly, as she vanished, with a parting twinkle that kept\nFan's face bright all day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. PLAYING GRANDMOTHER\n\n\nI THINK Tom had the hardest time of all, for besides the family\ntroubles, he had many of his own to perplex and harass him. College\nscrapes were soon forgotten in greater afflictions; but there were\nplenty of tongues to blame \"that extravagant dog,\" and plenty of heads\nto wag ominously over prophecies of the good time Tom Shaw would now\nmake on the road to ruin. As reporters flourish in this country, of\ncourse Tom soon heard all the friendly criticisms passed upon him and\nhis career, and he suffered more than anybody guessed; for the truth\nthat was at the bottom of the gossip filled him with the sharp regret\nand impotent wrath against himself as well as others, which drives many\na proud fellow, so placed, to destruction, or the effort that redeems\nboyish folly, and makes a man of him.\n\nNow that he had lost his heritage, Tom seemed to see for the first\ntime how goodly it had been, how rich in power, pleasure, and gracious\nopportunities. He felt its worth even while he acknowledged, with the\nsense of justice that is strong in manly men, how little he deserved\na gift which he had so misused. He brooded over this a good deal, for,\nlike the bat in the fable, he did n't seem to find any place in the new\nlife which had begun for all. Knowing nothing of business, he was not\nof much use to his father, though he tried to be, and generally ended\nby feeling that he was a hindrance, not a help. Domestic affairs were\nequally out of his line, and the girls, more frank than their father,\ndid not hesitate to tell him he was in the way when he offered to lend\na hand anywhere. After the first excitement was over, and he had time to\nthink, heart and energy seemed to die out, remorse got hold of him, and,\nas generous, thoughtless natures are apt to do when suddenly confronted\nwith conscience, he exaggerated his faults and follies into sins of the\ndeepest dye, and fancied he was regarded by others as a villain and an\noutcast. Pride and penitence made him shrink out of sight as much as\npossible, for he could not bear pity, even when silently expressed by a\nfriendly hand or a kindly eye. He stayed at home a good deal, and loafed\nabout with a melancholy and neglected air, vanished when anyone came,\ntalked very little, and was either pathetically humble or tragically\ncross. He wanted to do something, but nothing seemed to appear; and\nwhile he waited to get his poise after the downfall, he was so very\nmiserable that I'm afraid, if it had not been for one thing, my poor\nTom would have got desperate, and been a failure. But when he seemed\nmost useless, outcast, and forlorn, he discovered that one person needed\nhim, one person never found him in the way, one person always welcomed\nand clung to him with the strongest affection of a very feeble nature.\nThis dependence of his mother's was Tom's salvation at that crisis of\nhis life; and the gossips, who said softly to one another over their\nmuffins and tea. \"It really would be a relief to that whole family if\npoor, dear Mrs. Shaw could be ahem! mercifully removed,\" did not know\nthat the invalid's weak, idle hands were unconsciously keeping the son\nsafe in that quiet room, where she gave him all that she had to give,\nmother-love, till he took heart again, and faced the world ready to\nfight his battles manfully.\n\n\"Dear, dear! how old and bent poor father does look. I hope he won't\nforget to order my sweetbread,\" sighed Mrs. Shaw one day, as she watched\nher husband slowly going down the street.\n\nTom, who stood by her, idly spinning the curtain tassel, followed the\nfamiliar figure with his eye, and seeing how gray the hair had grown,\nhow careworn the florid face, and how like a weary old man his once\nstrong, handsome father walked, he was smitten by a new pang of\nself-reproach, and with his usual impetuosity set about repairing the\nomission as soon as he discovered it.\n\n\"I'll see to your sweetbread, mum. Good-by, back to dinner,\" and with a\nhasty kiss, Tom was off.\n\nHe did n't know exactly what he meant to do, but it had suddenly come\nover him, that he was hiding from the storm, and letting his father\nmeet it alone; for the old man went to his office every day with the\nregularity of a machine, that would go its usual round until it stopped,\nwhile the young man stayed at home with the women, and let his mother\ncomfort him.\n\n\"He has a right to be ashamed of me, but I act as if I was ashamed of\nhim; dare say people think so. I'll show them that I ain't; yes, by the\npowers, I will!\" and Tom drew on his gloves with the air of a man about\nto meet and conquer an enemy.\n\n\"Have an arm, sir? If you don't mind I'll walk down with you. Little\ncommission for mother, nice day, is n't it?\"\n\nTom rather broke down at the end of his speech, for the look of pleased\nsurprise with which his father greeted him, the alacrity with which he\naccepted and leaned on the strong arm offered him, proved that the\ndaily walks had been solitary and doubtless sad ones. I think Mr. Shaw\nunderstood the real meaning of that little act of respect, and felt\nbetter for the hopeful change it seemed to foretell. But he took it\nquietly, and leaving his face to speak for him, merely said, \"Thanky,\nTom; yes, mother will enjoy her dinner twice as much if you order it.\"\n\nThen they began to talk business with all their might, as if they feared\nthat some trace of sentiment might disgrace their masculine dignity. But\nit made no difference whether they discussed lawsuits or love, mortgages\nor mothers, the feeling was all right and they knew it, so Mr. Shaw\nwalked straighter than usual, and Tom felt that he was in his proper\nplace again. The walk was not without its trials, however; for while it\ndid Tom's heart good to see the cordial respect paid to his father,\nit tried his patience sorely to see also inquisitive or disapproving\nglances fixed upon himself when hats were lifted to his father, and\nto hear the hearty \"Good day, Mr. Shaw,\" drop into a cool or careless,\n\"That's the son; it's hard on him. Wild fellow, do him good.\"\n\n\"Granted; but you need n't hit a man when he's down,\" muttered Tom to\nhimself, feeling every moment a stronger desire to do something that\nshould silence everybody. \"I'd cut away to Australia if it was n't for\nmother; anything, anywhere to get out of the way of people who know me.\nI never can right myself here, with all the fellows watching, and laying\nwagers whether I sink or swim. Hang Greek and Latin! wish I'd learned\na trade, and had something to fall back upon. Have n't a blessed thing\nnow, but decent French and my fists. Wonder if old Bell don't want\na clerk for the Paris branch of the business? That would n't be bad;\nfaith, I'll try it.\"\n\nAnd when Tom had landed his father safely at the office, to the great\nedification of all beholders, he screwed up his courage, and went to\nprefer his request, feeling that the prospect brightened a little. But\nMr. Bell was not in a good humor, and only gave Tom a severe lecture on\nthe error of his ways, which sent him home much depressed, and caused\nthe horizon to lower again.\n\nAs he roamed about the house that afternoon, trying to calculate how\nmuch an Australian outfit would cost, the sound of lively voices and\nclattering spoons attracted him to the kitchen. There he found\nPolly giving Maud lessons in cookery; for the \"new help\" not being a\nhigh-priced article, could not be depended on for desserts, and Mrs.\nShaw would have felt as if the wolf was at the door if there was not \"a\nsweet dish\" at dinner. Maud had a genius for cooking, and Fanny hated\nit, so that little person was in her glory, studying receipt books, and\ntaking lessons whenever Polly could give them.\n\n\"Gracious me, Tom, don't come now; we are awful busy! Men don't belong\nin kitchens,\" cried Maud, as her brother appeared in the doorway.\n\n\"Could n't think what you were about. Mum is asleep, and Fan out, so I\nloafed down to see if there was any fun afoot,\" said Tom, lingering, as\nif the prospect was agreeable. He was a social fellow, and very grateful\njust then to any one who helped him to forget his worries for a time.\nPolly knew this, felt that his society would not be a great affliction\nto herself at least, and whispering to Maud, \"He won't know,\" she added,\naloud, \"Come in if you like, and stir this cake for me; it needs a\nstrong hand, and mine are tired. There, put on that apron to keep you\ntidy, sit here, and take it easy.\"\n\n\"I used to help grandma bat up cake, and rather liked it, if I remember\nright,\" said Tom, letting Polly tie a checked apron on him, put a big\nbowl into his hands, and settle him near the table, where Maud\nwas picking raisins, and she herself stirring busily about among\nspice-boxes, rolling-pins, and butter-pots.\n\n\"You do it beautifully, Tom. I'll give you a conundrum to lighten your\nlabor: Why are bad boys like cake?\" asked Polly, anxious to cheer him\nup.\n\n\"Because a good beating makes them better. I doubt that myself, though,\"\nanswered Tom, nearly knocking the bottom of the bowl out with his\nenergetic demonstrations, for it really was a relief to do something.\n\n\"Bright boy! here's a plum for you,\" and Polly threw a plump raisin\ninto his mouth.\n\n\"Put in lots, won't you? I'm rather fond of plum-cake,\" observed\nTom, likening himself to Hercules with the distaff, and finding his\nemployment pleasant, if not classical.\n\n\"I always do, if I can; there's nothing I like better than to shovel in\nsugar and spice, and make nice, plummy cake for people. It's one of the\nfew things I have a gift for.\"\n\n\"You've hit it this time, Polly; you certainly have a gift for putting\na good deal of both articles into your own and other people's lives,\nwhich is lucky, as, we all have to eat that sort of cake, whether we\nlike it or not,\" observed Tom, so soberly that Polly opened her eyes,\nand Maud exclaimed, \"I do believe he's preaching.\"\n\n\"Feel as if I could sometimes,\" continued Tom; then his eye fell upon\nthe dimples in Polly's elbows, and he added, with a laugh, \"That's more\nin your line, ma'am; can't you give us a sermon?\"\n\n\"A short one. Life, my brethren, is like plum-cake,\" began Polly,\nimpressively folding her floury hands. \"In some the plums are all on\nthe top, and we eat them gayly, till we suddenly find they are gone. In\nothers the plums sink to the bottom, and we look for them in vain as we\ngo on, and often come to them when it is too late to enjoy them. But\nin the well-made cake, the plums are wisely scattered all through, and\nevery mouthful is a pleasure. We make our own cakes, in a great measure,\ntherefore let us look to it, my brethren, that they are mixed according\nto the best receipt, baked in a well regulated oven, and gratefully\neaten with a temperate appetite.\"\n\n\"Good! good!\" cried Tom, applauding with the wooden spoon. \"That's a\nmodel sermon, Polly, short, sweet, sensible, and not a bit sleepy. I'm\none of your parish, and will see that you get your'celery punctooal,'\nas old Deacon Morse used to say.\"\n\n\"'Thank you, brother, my wants is few, and ravens scurser than they used\nto be,' as dear old Parson Miller used to answer. Now, Maud, bring on\nthe citron;\" and Polly began to put the cake together in what seemed\na most careless and chaotic manner, while Tom and Maud watched with\nabsorbing interest till it was safely in the oven.\n\n\"Now make your custards, dear; Tom may like to beat the eggs for you; it\nseems to have a good effect upon his constitution.\"\n\n\"First-rate; hand'em along,\" and Tom smoothed his apron with a cheerful\nair. \"By the way, Syd's got back. I met him yesterday, and he treated me\nlike a man and a brother,\" he added, as if anxious to contribute to the\npleasures of the hour.\n\n\"I'm so glad!\" cried Polly, clapping her hands, regardless of the egg\nshe held, which dropped and smashed on the floor at her feet. \"Careless\nthing! Pick it up, Maud, I'll get some more;\" and Polly whisked out of\nthe room, glad of an excuse to run and tell Fan, who had just come\nin, lest, hearing the news in public, she might be startled out of the\nwell-bred composure with which young ladies are expected to receive\ntidings, even of the most vital importance.\n\n\"You know all about history, don't you?\" asked Maud, suddenly.\n\n\"Not quite,\" modestly answered Tom.\n\n\"I just want to know if there really was a man named Sir Philip, in the\ntime of Queen Elizabeth.\"\n\n\"You mean Sir Philip Sidney? Yes, he lived then and a fine old fellow he\nwas too.\"\n\n\"There; I knew the girls did n't mean him,\" cried Maud, with a chop that\nsent the citron flying.\n\n\"What mischief are you up to now, you little magpie?\"\n\n\"I shan't tell you what they said, because I don't remember much of it;\nbut I heard Polly and Fan talking about some one dreadful mysterious,\nand when I asked who it was, Fan said,'Sir Philip.' Ho! she need n't\nthink I believe it! I saw'em laugh, and blush, and poke one another,\nand I knew it was n't about any old Queen Elizabeth man,\" cried Maud,\nturning up her nose as far as that somewhat limited feature would go.\n\n\"Look here, you are letting cats out of the bag. Never mind, I thought\nso. They don't tell us their secrets, but we are so sharp, we can't help\nfinding them out, can we?\" said Tom, looking so much interested, that\nMaud could n't resist airing her knowledge a little.\n\n\"Well, I dare say, it is n't proper for you to know, but I am old enough\nnow to be told anything, and those girls better mind what they say, for\nI'm not a stupid chit, like Blanche. I just wish you could have heard\nthem go on. I'm sure there's something very nice about Mr. Sydney,\nthey looked so pleased when they whispered and giggled on the bed, and\nthought I was ripping bonnets, and did n't hear a word.\"\n\n\"Which looked most pleased?\" asked Tom, investigating the kitchen boiler\nwith deep interest.\n\n\"Well,'pears to me Polly did; she talked most, and looked funny and\nvery happy all the time. Fan laughed a good deal, but I guess Polly is\nthe loveress,\" replied Maud, after a moment's reflection.\n\n\"Hold your tongue; she's coming!\" and Tom began to pump as if the house\nwas on fire.\n\nDown came Polly, with heightened color, bright eyes, and not a single\negg. Tom took a quick look at her over his shoulder, and paused as if\nthe fire was suddenly extinguished. Something in his face made Polly\nfeel a little guilty, so she fell to grating nutmeg, with a vigor which\nmade red cheeks the most natural thing in life. Maud, the traitor, sat\ndemurely at work, looking very like what Tom had called her, a magpie\nwith mischief in its head. Polly felt a change in the atmosphere, but\nmerely thought Tom was tired, so she graciously dismissed him with a\nstick of cinnamon, as she had nothing else just then to lay upon the\nshrine. \"Fan's got the books and maps you wanted. Go and rest now. I'm\nmuch obliged; here's your wages, Bridget.\"\n\n\"Good luck to your messes,\" answered Tom, as he walked away meditatively\ncrunching his cinnamon, and looking as if he did not find it as spicy as\nusual. He got his books, but did not read them; for, shutting himself up\nin the little room called \"Tom's den,\" he just sat down and brooded.\n\nWhen he came down to breakfast the next morning, he was greeted with\na general \"Happy birthday, Tom!\" and at his place lay gifts from every\nmember of the family; not as costly as formerly, perhaps, but infinitely\ndearer, as tokens of the love that had outlived the change, and only\ngrown the warmer for the test of misfortune. In his present state of\nmind, Tom felt as if he did not deserve a blessed thing; so when every\none exerted themselves to make it a happy day for him, he understood\nwhat it means \"to be nearly killed with kindness,\" and sternly resolved\nto be an honor to his family, or perish in the attempt. Evening brought\nPolly to what she called a \"festive tea,\" and when they gathered round\nthe table, another gift appeared, which, though not of a sentimental\nnature, touched Tom more than all the rest. It was a most delectable\ncake, with a nosegay atop, and round it on the snowy frosting there\nran a pink inscription, just as it had been every year since Tom could\nremember.\n\n\"Name, age, and date, like a nice white tombstone,\" observed Maud,\ncomplacently, at which funereal remark, Mrs. Shaw, who was down in honor\nof the day, dropped her napkin, and demanded her salts.\n\n\"Whose doing is that?\" asked Tom, surveying the gift with satisfaction;\nfor it recalled the happier birthdays, which seemed very far away now.\n\n\"I did n't know what to give you, for you've got everything a man\nwants, and I was in despair till I remembered that dear grandma always\nmade you a little cake like that, and that you once said it would n't be\na happy birthday without it. So I tried to make it just like hers, and I\ndo hope it will prove a good, sweet, plummy one.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" was all Tom said, as he smiled at the giver, but Polly knew\nthat her present had pleased him more than the most elegant trifle she\ncould have made.\n\n\"It ought to be good, for you beat it up yourself, Tom,\" cried, Maud.\n\"It was so funny to see you working away, and never guessing who the\ncake was for. I perfectly trembled every time you opened your mouth,\nfor fear you'd ask some question about it. That was the reason Polly\npreached and I kept talking when she was gone.\"\n\n\"Very stupid of me; but I forgot all about to-day. Suppose we cut it;\nI don't seem to care for anything else,\" said Tom, feeling no appetite,\nbut bound to do justice to that cake, if he fell a victim to his\ngratitude.\n\n\"I hope the plums won't all be at the bottom,\" said Polly, as she rose\nto do the honors of the cake, by universal appointment.\n\n\"I've had a good many at the top already, you know,\" answered Tom,\nwatching the operation with as much interest as if he had faith in the\nomen.\n\nCutting carefully, slice after slice fell apart; each firm and dark,\nspicy and rich, under the frosty rime above; and laying a specially\nlarge piece in one of grandma's quaint little china plates, Polly added\nthe flowers and handed it to Tom, with a look that said a good deal,\nfor, seeing that he remembered her sermon, she was glad to find that her\nallegory held good, in one sense at least. Tom's face brightened as he\ntook it, and after an inspection which amused the others very much he\nlooked up, saying, with an air of relief, \"Plums all through; I'm glad\nI had a hand in it, but Polly deserves the credit, and must wear the\nposy,\" and turning to her, he put the rose into her hair with more\ngallantry than taste, for a thorn pricked her head, the leaves tickled\nher ear, and the flower was upside down.\n\nFanny laughed at his want of skill, but Polly would n't have it altered,\nand everybody fell to eating cake, as if indigestion was one of the lost\narts. They had a lively tea, and were getting on famously afterward,\nwhen two letters were brought for Tom, who glanced at one, and retired\nrather precipitately to his den, leaving Maud consumed with curiosity,\nand the older girls slightly excited, for Fan thought she recognized the\nhandwriting on one, and Polly, on the other.\n\nOne half an hour and then another elapsed, and Tom did not return. Mr.\nShaw went out, Mrs. Shaw retired to her room escorted by Maud, and the\ntwo girls sat together wondering if anything dreadful had happened. All\nof a sudden a voice called, \"Polly!\" and that young lady started out of\nher chair, as if the sound had been a thunder-clap.\n\n\"Do run! I'm perfectly fainting to know what the matter is,\" said Fan.\n\n\"You'd better go,\" began Polly, wishing to obey, yet feeling a little\nshy.\n\n\"He don't want me; besides, I could n't say a word for myself if that\nletter was from Sydney,\" cried Fanny, hustling her friend towards the\ndoor, in a great flutter.\n\nPolly went without another word, but she wore a curiously anxious look,\nand stopped on the threshold of the den, as if a little afraid of its\noccupant. Tom was sitting in his favorite attitude, astride of a chair,\nwith his arms folded and his chin on the top rail; not an elegant\nposture, but the only one in which, he said, he could think well.\n\n\"Did you want me, Tom?\"\n\n\"Yes. Come in, please, and don't look scared; I only want to show you a\npresent I've had, and ask your advice about accepting it.\"\n\n\"Why, Tom, you look as if you had been knocked down!\" exclaimed Polly,\nforgetting all about herself, as she saw his face when he rose and\nturned to meet her.\n\n\"I have; regularly floored; but I'm up again, and steadier than ever.\nJust you read that, and tell me what you think of it.\"\n\nTom snatched a letter off the table, put it into her hands, and began to\nwalk up and down the little room, like a veritable bear in its cage. As\nPolly read that short note, all the color went out of her face, and her\neyes began to kindle. When she came to the end, she stood a minute, as\nif too indignant to speak, then gave the paper a nervous sort of crumple\nand dropped it on the floor, saying, all in one breath, \"I think she is\na mercenary, heartless, ungrateful girl! That's what I think.\"\n\n\"Oh, the deuce! I did n't mean to show that one; it's the other.\" And\nTom took up a second paper, looking half angry, half ashamed at his\nown mistake. \"I don't care, though; every one will know to-morrow; and\nperhaps you'll be good enough to keep the girls from bothering me\nwith questions and gabble,\" he added, as if, on second thoughts, he was\nrelieved to have the communication made to Polly first.\n\n\"I don't wonder you looked upset. If the other letter is as bad, I'd\nbetter have a chair before I read it,\" said Polly, feeling that she\nbegan to tremble with excitement.\n\n\"It's a million times better, but it knocked me worse than the other;\nkindness always does.\" Tom stopped short there, and stood a minute\nturning the letter about in his hand as if it contained a sweet which\nneutralized the bitter in that smaller note, and touched him very much.\nThen he drew up an arm-chair, and beckoning Polly to take it, said in\na sober, steady tone, that surprised her greatly, \"Whenever I was in a\nquandary, I used to go and consult grandma, and she always had something\nsensible or comfortable to say to me. She's gone now, but somehow,\nPolly, you seem to take her place. Would you mind sitting in her chair,\nand letting me tell you two or three things, as Will does?\"\n\nMind it? Polly felt that Tom had paid her the highest and most beautiful\ncompliment he could have devised. She had often longed to do it, for,\nbeing brought up in the most affectionate and frank relations with her\nbrothers, she had early learned what it takes most women some time to\ndiscover, that sex does not make nearly as much difference in hearts and\nsouls as we fancy. Joy and sorrow, love and fear, life and death\nbring so many of the same needs to all, that the wonder is we do not\nunderstand each other better, but wait till times of tribulation teach\nus that human nature is very much the same in men and women. Thanks to\nthis knowledge, Polly understood Tom in a way that surprised and won\nhim. She knew that he wanted womanly sympathy, and that she could give\nit to him, because she was not afraid to stretch her hand across the\nbarrier which our artificial education puts between boys and girls, and\nto say to him in all good faith, \"If I can help you, let me.\"\n\nTen minutes sooner Polly could have done this almost as easily to Tom as\nto Will, but in that ten minutes something had happened which made this\ndifficult. Reading that Trix had given Tom back his freedom changed many\nthings to Polly, and caused her to shrink from his confidence, because\nshe felt as if it would be harder now to keep self out of sight; for,\nspite of maiden modesty, love and hope would wake and sing at the good\nnews. Slowly she sat down, and hesitatingly she said, with her eyes on\nthe ground, and a very humble voice, \"I'll do my best, but I can't fill\ngrandma's place, or give you any wise, good advice. I wish I could!\"\n\n\"You'll do it better than any one else. Talk troubles mother, father\nhas enough to think of without any of my worries. Fan is a good soul,\nbut she is n't practical, and we always get into a snarl if we try to\nwork together, so who have I but my other sister, Polly? The pleasure\nthat letter will give you may make up for my boring you.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Tom laid the other paper in her lap, and went off to the\nwindow, as if to leave her free to enjoy it unseen; but he could not\nhelp a glance now and then, and as Polly's face brightened, his own\nfell.\n\n\"Oh, Tom, that's a birthday present worth having, for it's so\nbeautifully given I don't see how you can refuse it. Arthur Sydney is a\nreal nobleman!\" cried Polly, looking up at last, with her fact glowing,\nand her eyes full of delight.\n\n\"So he is! I don't know another man living, except father, who would\nhave done such a thing, or who I could bring myself to take it from. Do\nyou see, he's not only paid the confounded debts, but has done it in my\nname, to spare me all he could?\"\n\n\"I see, it's like him; and I think he must be very happy to be able to\ndo such a thing.\"\n\n\"It is an immense weight off my shoulders, for some of those men could\nn't afford to wait till I'd begged, borrowed, or earned the money.\nSydney can wait, but he won't long, if I know myself.\" \"You won't take\nit as a gift, then?\"\n\n\"Would you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then don't think I will. I'm a pretty poor affair, Polly, but I'm\nnot mean enough to do that, while I've got a conscience and a pair of\nhands.\"\n\nA rough speech, but it pleased Polly better than the smoothest Tom had\never made in her hearing, for something in his face and voice told her\nthat the friendly act had roused a nobler sentiment than gratitude,\nmaking the cancelled obligations of the boy, debts of honor to the man.\n\n\"What will you do, Tom?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you; may I sit here?\" And Tom took the low footstool that\nalways stood near grandma's old chair. \"I've had so many plans in my\nhead lately, that sometimes it seems as if it would split,\" continued\nthe poor fellow, rubbing his tired forehead, as if to polish up his\nwits. \"I've thought seriously of going to California, Australia, or\nsome out-of-the-way place, where men get rich in a hurry.\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" cried Polly, putting out her hand as it to keep him, and then\nsnatching it back again before he could turn round.\n\n\"It would be hard on mother and the girls, I suppose; besides, I don't\nquite like it myself; looks as if I shirked and ran away.\"\n\n\"So it does,\" said Polly, decidedly.\n\n\"Well, you see I don't seem to find anything to do unless I turn clerk,\nand I don't think that would suit. The fact is, I could n't stand\nit here, where I'm known. It would be easier to scratch gravel on a\nrailroad, with a gang of Paddies, than to sell pins to my friends and\nneighbors. False pride, I dare say, but it's the truth, and there's no\nuse in dodging.\"\n\n\"Not a bit, and I quite agree with you.\"\n\n\"That's comfortable. Now I'm coming to the point where I specially\nwant your advice, Polly. Yesterday I heard you telling Fan about your\nbrother Ned; how well he got on; how he liked his business, and wanted\nWill to come and take some place near him. You thought I was reading,\nbut I heard; and it struck me that perhaps I could get a chance out West\nsomewhere. What do you think?\"\n\n\"If you really mean work, I know you could,\" answered Polly, quickly, as\nall sorts of plans and projects went sweeping through her mind. \"I wish\nyou could be with Ned; you'd get on together, I'm sure; and he'd be\nso glad to do anything he could. I'll write and ask, straight away, if\nyou want me to.\"\n\n\"Suppose you do; just for information, you know, then I shall have\nsomething to go upon. I want to have a feasible plan all ready, before\nI speak to father. There's nothing so convincing to business men as\nfacts, you know.\"\n\nPolly could not help smiling at Tom's new tone, it seemed so strange\nto hear him talking about anything but horses and tailors, dancing and\ngirls. She liked it, however, as much as she did the sober expression of\nhis face, and the way he had lately of swinging his arms about, as if he\nwanted to do something energetic with them.\n\n\"That will be wise. Do you think your father will like this plan?\"\n\n\"Pretty sure he will. Yesterday, when I told him I must go at something\nright off, he said, 'Anything honest, Tom, and don't forget that your\nfather began the world as a shop-boy.' You knew that, did n't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, he told me the story once, and I always liked to hear it, because\nit was pleasant to see how well he had succeeded.\"\n\n\"I never did like the story, a little bit ashamed, I'm afraid; but\nwhen we talked it over last night, it struck me in a new light, and I\nunderstood why father took the failure so well, and seems so contented\nwith this poorish place. It is only beginning again, he says; and having\nworked his way up once, he feels as if he could again. I declare to you,\nPolly, that sort of confidence in himself, and energy and courage in a\nman of his years, makes me love and respect the dear old gentleman as I\nnever did before.\"\n\n\"I'm so glad to hear you say that, Tom! I've sometimes thought you did\nn't quite appreciate your father, any more than he knew how much of a\nman you were.\"\n\n\"Never was till to-day, you know,\" said Tom, laughing, yet looking as\nif he felt the dignity of his one and twenty years. \"Odd, is n't it, how\npeople live together ever so long, and don't seem to find one another\nout, till something comes to do it for them. Perhaps this smash-up was\nsent to introduce me to my own father.\"\n\n\"There's philosophy for you,\" said Polly, smiling, even while she felt\nas if adversity was going to do more for Tom than years of prosperity.\n\nThey both sat quiet for a minute, Polly in the big chair looking at him\nwith a new respect in her eyes, Tom on the stool near by slowly tearing\nup a folded paper he had absently taken from the floor while he talked.\n\n\"Did this surprise you?\" he asked, as a little white shower fluttered\nfrom his hands.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, it did me; for you know as soon as we came to grief I offered to\nrelease Trix from the engagement, and she would n't let me,\" continued\nTom, as if, having begun the subject, he wished to explain it\nthoroughly.\n\n\"That surprised me,\" said Polly.\n\n\"So it did me, for Fan always insisted it was the money and not the\nman she cared for. Her first answer pleased me very much, for I did not\nexpect it, and nothing touches a fellow more than to have a woman stand\nby him through thick and thin.\"\n\n\"She don't seem to have done it.\"\n\n\"Fan was right. Trix only waited to see how bad things really were, or\nrather her mother did. She's as cool, hard, and worldly minded an old\nsoul as I ever saw, and Trix is bound to obey. She gets round it very\nneatly in her note, 'I won't be a burden,''will sacrifice her hopes,'\n'and always remain my warm friend,' but the truth is, Tom Shaw rich was\nworth making much of, but Tom Shaw poor is in the way, and may go to the\ndevil as fast as he likes.\"\n\n\"Well, he is n't going!\" cried Polly, defiantly, for her wrath burned\nhotly against Trix, though she blessed her for setting the bondman free.\n\n\"Came within an ace of it,\" muttered Tom to himself; adding aloud, in\na tone of calm resignation that assured Polly his heart would not\nbe broken though his engagement was, \"It never rains but it pours,\n'specially in hard times, but when a man is down, a rap or two more\ndon't matter much, I suppose. It's the first blow that hurts most.\"\n\n\"Glad to see you take the last blow so well.\" There was an ironical\nlittle twang to that speech, and Polly could n't help it. Tom colored up\nand looked hurt for a minute, then seemed to right himself with a shrug,\nand said, in his outspoken way, \"To tell the honest truth, Polly, it was\nnot a very hard one. I've had a feeling for some time that Trix and I\nwere not suited to one another, and it might be wiser to stop short. But\nshe did not or would not see it; and I was not going to back out, and\nleave her to wear any more willows, so here we are. I don't bear malice,\nbut hope she'll do better, and not be disappointed again, upon my word\nI do.\"\n\n\"That's very good of you, quite Sydneyesque, and noble,\" said Polly,\nfeeling rather ill at ease, and wishing she could hide herself behind a\ncap and spectacles, if she was to play Grandma to this confiding youth.\n\n\"It will be all plain sailing for Syd, I fancy,\" observed Tom, getting\nup as if the little cricket suddenly ceased to be comfortable.\n\n\"I hope so,\" murmured Polly, wondering what was coming next.\n\n\"He deserves the very best of everything, and I pray the Lord he may get\nit,\" added Tom, poking the fire in a destructive manner.\n\nPolly made no answer, fearing to pay too much, for she knew Fan had made\nno confidant of Tom, and she guarded her friend's secret as jealously as\nher own. \"You'll write to Ned to-morrow, will you? I'll take anything\nhe's got, for I want to be off,\" said Tom, casting down the poker,\nand turning round with a resolute air which was lost on Polly, who sat\ntwirling the rose that had fallen into her lap.\n\n\"I'll write to-night. Would you like me to tell the girls about Trix\nand Sydney?\" she asked as she rose, feeling that the council was over.\n\n\"I wish you would. I don't know how to thank you for all you've done\nfor me; I wish to heaven I did,\" said Tom, holding out his hand with a\nlook that Polly thought a great deal too grateful for the little she had\ndone.\n\nAs she gave him her hand, and looked up at him with those confiding eyes\nof hers, Tom's gratitude seemed to fly to his head, for, without the\nslightest warning, he stooped down and kissed her, a proceeding which\nstartled Polly so that he recovered himself at once, and retreated into\nhis den with the incoherent apology, \"I beg pardon could n't help it\ngrandma always let me on my birthday.\"\n\nWhile Polly took refuge up stairs, forgetting all about Fan, as she sat\nin the dark with her face hidden, wondering why she was n't very angry,\nand resolving never again to indulge in the delightful but dangerous\npastime of playing grandmother.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. THE WOMAN WHO DID NOT DARE\n\n\nPOLLY wrote enthusiastically, Ned answered satisfactorily, and after\nmuch corresponding, talking, and planning, it was decided that Tom\nshould go West. Never mind what the business was; it suffices to say\nthat it was a good beginning for a young man like Tom, who, having been\nborn and bred in the most conservative class of the most conceited city\nin New England, needed just the healthy, hearty, social influences of\nthe West to widen his views and make a man of him.\n\nOf course there was much lamentation among the women, but every one felt\nit was the best thing for him; so while they sighed they sewed, packed\nvisions of a brilliant future away with his new pocket handkerchiefs,\nand rejoiced that the way was open before him even in the act of\nbedewing his boots with tears. Sydney stood by him to the last, \"like\na man and a brother\" (which expression of Tom's gave Fanny infinite\nsatisfaction), and Will felt entirely consoled for Ned's disappointment\nat his refusal to go and join him, since Tom was to take the place Ned\nhad kept for him.\n\nFortunately every one was so busy with the necessary preparations that\nthere was no time for romance of any sort, and the four young people\nworked together as soberly and sensibly as if all sorts of emotions were\nnot bottled up in their respective hearts. But in spite of the silence,\nthe work, and the hurry, I think they came to know one another better\nin that busy little space of time than in all the years that had gone\nbefore, for the best and bravest in each was up and stirring, and\nthe small house was as full of the magnetism of love and friendship,\nself-sacrifice and enthusiasm, as the world outside was full of spring\nsunshine and enchantment. Pity that the end should come so soon, but the\nhour did its work and went its way, leaving a clearer atmosphere behind,\nthough the young folks did not see it then, for their eyes were dim\nbecause of the partings that must be.\n\nTom was off to the West; Polly went home for the summer; Maud was\ntaken to the seaside with Belle; and Fanny left alone to wrestle with\nhousekeeping, \"help,\" and heartache. If it had not been for two things,\nI fear she never would have stood a summer in town, but Sydney often\ncalled, till his vacation came, and a voluminous correspondence with\nPolly beguiled the long days. Tom wrote once a week to his mother, but\nthe letters were short and not very satisfactory, for men never do\ntell the interesting little things that women best like to hear. Fanny\nforwarded her bits of news to Polly. Polly sent back all the extracts\nfrom Ned's letters concerning Tom, and by putting the two reports\ntogether, they gained the comfortable assurance that Tom was well, in\ngood spirits, hard at work, and intent on coming out strong in spite of\nall obstacles.\n\nPolly had a quiet summer at home, resting and getting ready in mind and\nbody for another winter's work, for in the autumn she tried her plan\nagain, to the satisfaction of her pupils and the great joy of her\nfriends. She never said much of herself in her letters, and Fanny's\nfirst exclamation when they met again, was an anxious \"Why, Polly, dear!\nHave you been sick and never told me?\"\n\n\"No, I'm only tired, had a good deal to do lately, and the dull weather\nmakes me just a trifle blue. I shall soon brighten up when I get to my\nwork again,\" answered Polly, bustling about to put away her things.\n\n\"You don't look a bit natural. What have you been doing to your precious\nlittle self?\" persisted Fanny, troubled by the change, yet finding it\nhard to say wherein it lay.\n\nPolly did not look sick, though her cheeks were thinner and her color\npaler than formerly, but she seemed spiritless, and there was a tired\nlook in her eyes that went to Fanny's heart.\n\n\"I'm all right enough, as you'll see when I'm in order. I'm proper\nglad to find you looking so well and happy. Does all go smoothly, Fan?\"\nasked Polly, beginning to brush her hair industriously.\n\n\"Answer me one question first,\" said Fanny, looking as if a sudden fear\nhad come over her. \"Tell me, truly, have you never repented of your hint\nto Sydney?\"\n\n\"Never!\" cried Polly, throwing back the brown veil behind which she had\nhalf hidden her face at first.\n\n\"On your honor, as an honest girl?\"\n\n\"On my honor, as anything you please. Why do you suspect me of it?\"\ndemanded Polly, almost angrily.\n\n\"Because something is wrong with you. It's no use to deny it, for you\n've got the look I used to see in that very glass on my own face when I\nthought he cared for you. Forgive me, Polly, but I can't help saying it,\nfor it is there, and I want to be as true to you as you were to me if I\ncan.\"\n\nFanny's face was full of agitation, and she spoke fast and frankly, for\nshe was trying to be generous and found it very hard. Polly understood\nnow and put her fear at rest by saying almost passionately, \"I tell you\nI don't love him! If he was the only man in the world, I would n't marry\nhim, because I don't want to.\"\n\nThe last three words were added in a different tone, for Polly had\nchecked herself there with a half-frightened look and turned away to\nhide her face behind her hair again.\n\n\"Then if it's not him, it's some one else. You've got a secret,\nPolly, and I should think you might tell it, as you know mine,\" said\nFanny, unable to rest till everything was told, for Polly's manner\ntroubled her.\n\nThere was no answer to her question, but she was satisfied and putting\nher arm round her friend, she said, in her most persuasive tone, \"My\nprecious Polly, do I know him?\"\n\n\"You have seen him.\"\n\n\"And is he very wise, good, and splendid, dear?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"He ought to be if you love him. I hope he is n't bad?\" cried Fan,\nanxiously, still holding Polly, who kept her head obstinately turned.\n\n\"I'm suited, that's enough.\"\n\n\"Oh, please just tell me one thing more. Don't he love back again?\"\n\n\"No. Now don't say another word, I can't bear it!\" and Polly drew\nherself away, as she spoke in a desperate sort of tone.\n\n\"I won't, but now I'm not afraid to tell you that I think, I hope, I\ndo believe that Sydney cares a little for me. He's been very kind to us\nall, and lately he has seemed to like to see me always when he comes\nand miss me if I'm gone. I did n't dare to hope anything, till Papa\nobserved something in his manner, and teased me about it. I try not to\ndeceive myself, but it does seem as if there was a chance of happiness\nfor me.\"\n\n\"Thank heaven for that!\" cried Polly, with the heartiest satisfaction in\nher voice. \"Now come and tell me all about it,\" she added, sitting down\non the couch with the air of one who has escaped a great peril.\n\n\"I've got some notes and things I want to ask your opinion about, if\nthey really mean anything, you know,\" said Fanny, getting out a bundle\nof papers from the inmost recesses of her desk. \"There's a photograph\nof Tom, came in his last letter. Good, is n't it? He looks older, but\nthat's the beard and the rough coat, I suppose. Dear old fellow, he is\ndoing so well I really begin to feel quite proud of him.\"\n\nFan tossed her the photograph, and went on rummaging for a certain note.\nShe did not see Polly catch up the picture and look at it with hungry\neyes, but she did hear something in the low tone in which Polly said,\n\"It don't do him justice,\" and glancing over her shoulder, Fan's quick\neye caught a glimpse of the truth, though Polly was half turned away\nfrom her. Without stopping to think, Fan dropped her letters, took Polly\nby the shoulders, and cried in a tone full of astonishment, \"Polly, is\nit Tom?\"\n\nPoor Polly was so taken by surprise, that she had not a word to say.\nNone were needed; her telltale face answered for her, as well as the\nimpulse which made her hide her head in the sofa cushion, like a foolish\nostrich when the hunters are after it.\n\n\"Oh, Polly, I am so glad! I never thought of it you are so good, and he\n's such a wild boy, I can't believe it but it is so dear of you to care\nfor him.\"\n\n\"Could n't help it tried not to but it was so hard you know, Fan, you\nknow,\" said a stifled voice from the depths of the very fuzzy cushion\nwhich Tom had once condemned.\n\nThe last words, and the appealing hand outstretched to her, told Fanny\nthe secret of her friend's tender sympathy for her own love troubles,\nand seemed so pathetic, that she took Polly in her arms, and cried over\nher, in the fond, foolish way girls have of doing when their hearts are\nfull, and tears can say more than tongues. The silence never lasts long,\nhowever, for the feminine desire to \"talk it over\" usually gets the\nbetter of the deepest emotion. So presently the girls were hard at\nit, Polly very humble and downcast, Fanny excited and overflowing with\ncuriosity and delight.\n\n\"Really my sister! You dear thing, how heavenly that will be,\" she\ncried.\n\n\"It never will be,\" answered Polly in a tone of calm despair.\n\n\"What will prevent it?\"\n\n\"Maria Bailey,\" was the tragic reply.\n\n\"What do you mean? Is she the Western girl? She shan't have Tom; I'll\nkill her first!\"\n\n\"Too late, let me tell you is that door shut, and Maud safe?\"\n\nFanny reconnoitered, and returning, listened breathlessly, while Polly\npoured into her ear the bitter secret which was preying on her soul.\n\n\"Has n't he mentioned Maria in his letters?\"\n\n\"Once or twice, but sort of jokingly, and I thought it was only some\nlittle flirtation. He can't have time for much of that fun, he's so\nbusy.\"\n\n\"Ned writes good, gossipy letters I taught him how and he tells me all\nthat's going on. When he'd spoken of this girl several times (they\nboard with her mother, you know), I asked about her, quite carelessly,\nand he told me she was pretty, good, and well educated, and he thought\nTom was rather smitten. That was a blow, for you see, Fan, since Trix\nbroke the engagement, and it was n't wrong to think of Tom, I let myself\nhope, just a little, and was so happy! Now I must give it up, and now I\nsee how much I hoped, and what a dreadful loss it's going to be.\"\n\nTwo great tears rolled down Polly's cheeks, and Fanny wiped them away,\nfeeling an intense desire to go West by the next train, wither Maria\nBailey with a single look, and bring Tom back as a gift to Polly.\n\n\"It was so stupid of me not to guess before. But you see Tom always\nseems so like a boy, and you are more womanly for your age than any girl\nI know, so I never thought of your caring for him in that way. I knew\nyou were very good to him, you are to every one, my precious; and I knew\nthat he was fond of you as he is of me, fonder if anything, because he\nthinks you are perfect; but still I never dreamed of his loving you as\nmore than a dear friend.\"\n\n\"He does n't,\" sighed Polly.\n\n\"Well, he ought; and if I could get hold of him, he should!\"\n\nPolly clutched Fan at that, and held her tight, saying sternly, \"If you\never breathe a word, drop a hint, look a look that will tell him or any\none else about me, I'll yes, as sure as my name is Mary Milton I'll\nproclaim from the housetops that you like Ar\" Polly got no further,\nfor Fan's hand was on her mouth, and Fan's alarmed voice vehemently\nprotested, \"I won't! I promise solemnly I'll never say a word to a\nmortal creature. Don't be so fierce, Polly; you quite frighten me.\"\n\n\"It's bad enough to love some one who don't love you, but to have them\ntold of it is perfectly awful. It makes me wild just to think of it. Oh,\nFan, I'm getting so ill-tempered and envious and wicked, I don't know\nwhat will happen to me.\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid for you, my dear, and I do believe things will go\nright, because you are so good to every one. How Tom could help adoring\nyou I don't see. I know he would if he had stayed at home longer after\nhe got rid of Trix. It would be the making of him; but though he is my\nbrother, I don't think he's good enough for you, Polly, and I don't\nquite see how you can care for him so much, when you might have had a\nperson so infinitely superior.\"\n\n\"I don't want a'superior' person; he'd tire me if he was like A. S.\nBesides, I do think Tom is superior to him in many things. Well, you\nneed n't stare; I know he is, or will be. He's so different, and very\nyoung, and has lots of faults, I know, but I like him all the better for\nit, and he's honest and brave, and has got a big, warm heart, and I'd\nrather have him care for me than the wisest, best, most accomplished man\nin the world, simply because I love him!\"\n\nIf Tom could only have seen Polly's face when she said that! It was so\ntender, earnest, and defiant, that Fanny forgot the defence of her own\nlover in admiration of Polly's loyalty to hers; for this faithful, all\nabsorbing love was a new revelation to Fanny, who was used to hearing\nher friends boast of two or three lovers a year, and calculate their\nrespective values, with almost as much coolness as the young men\ndiscussed the fortunes of the girls they wished for, but \"could not\nafford to marry.\" She had thought her love for Sydney very romantic,\nbecause she did not really care whether he was rich or poor, though she\nnever dared to say so, even to Polly, for fear of being laughed at.\nShe began to see now what true love was, and to feel that the sentiment\nwhich she could not conquer was a treasure to be accepted with\nreverence, and cherished with devotion.\n\n\"I don't know when I began to love Tom, but I found out that I did last\nwinter, and was as much surprised as you are,\" continued Polly, as if\nglad to unburden her heart. \"I did n't approve of him at all. I\nthought he was extravagant, reckless, and dandified. I was very much\ndisappointed when he chose Trix, and the more I thought and saw of it,\nthe worse I felt, for Tom was too good for her, and I hated to see her\ndo so little for him, when she might have done so much; because he is\none of the men who can be led by their affections, and the woman he\nmarries can make or mar him.\"\n\n\"That's true!\" cried Fan, as Polly paused to look at the picture, which\nappeared to regard her with a grave, steady look, which seemed rather to\nbelie her assertions.\n\n\"I don't mean that he's weak or bad. If he was, I should hate him; but\nhe does need some one to love him very much, and make him happy, as\na good woman best knows how,\" said Polly, as if answering the mute\nlanguage of Tom's face.\n\n\"I hope Maria Bailey is all he thinks her,\" she added, softly, \"for I\ncould n't bear to have him disappointed again.\"\n\n\"I dare say he don't care a fig for her, and you are only borrowing\ntrouble. What do you say Ned answered when you asked about this\ninconvenient girl?\" said Fanny turning hopeful all at once.\n\nPolly repeated it, and added, \"I asked him in another letter if he did\nn't admire Miss B. as much as Tom, and he wrote back that she was'a\nnice girl,' but he had no time for nonsense, and I need n't get my white\nkids ready for some years yet, unless to dance at Tom's wedding. Since\nthen he has n't mentioned Maria, so I was sure there was something\nserious going on, and being in Tom's confidence, he kept quiet.\"\n\n\"It does look bad. Suppose I say a word to Tom, just inquire after his\nheart in a general way, you know, and give him a chance to tell me, if\nthere is anything to tell.\" \"I'm willing, but you must let me see the\nletter. I can't trust you not to hint or say too much.\"\n\n\"You shall. I'll keep my promise in spite of everything, but it will be\nhard to see things going wrong when a word would set it right.\"\n\n\"You know what will happen if you do,\" and Polly looked so threatening\nthat Fan trembled before her, discovering that the gentlest girls when\nroused are more impressive than any shrew; for even turtle doves peck\ngallantly to defend their nests.\n\n\"If it is true about Maria, what shall we do?\" said Fanny after a pause.\n\n\"Bear it; People always do bear things, somehow,\" answered Polly,\nlooking as if sentence had been passed upon her.\n\n\"But if it is n't?\" cried Fan, unable to endure the sight.\n\n\"Then I shall wait.\" And Polly's face changed so beautifully that Fan\nhugged her on the spot, fervently wishing that Maria Bailey never had\nbeen born.\n\nThen the conversation turned to lover number two, and after a long\nconfabulation, Polly gave it as her firm belief that A. S. had forgotten\nM. M., and was rapidly finding consolation in the regard of F. S. With\nthis satisfactory decision the council ended after the ratification of a\nLoyal League, by which the friends pledged themselves to stand staunchly\nby one another, through the trials of the coming year.\n\nIt was a very different winter from the last for both the girls. Fanny\napplied herself to her duties with redoubled ardor, for \"A. S.\" was a\ndomestic man, and admired housewifely accomplishments. If Fanny wanted\nto show him what she could do toward making a pleasant home, she\ncertainly succeeded better than she suspected, for in spite of many\nfailures and discouragements behind the scenes, the little house became\na most attractive place, to Mr. Sydney at least, for he was more the\nhouse-friend than ever, and seemed determined to prove that change of\nfortune made no difference to him.\n\nFanny had been afraid that Polly's return might endanger her hopes, but\nSydney met Polly with the old friendliness, and very soon convinced her\nthat the nipping in the bud process had been effectual, for being taken\nearly, the sprouting affection had died easy, and left room for an older\nfriendship to blossom into a happier love.\n\nFanny seemed glad of this, and Polly soon set her heart at rest by\nproving that she had no wish to try her power. She kept much at home\nwhen the day's work was done, finding it pleasanter to sit dreaming over\nbook or sewing alone, than to exert herself even to go to the Shaws'.\n\n\"Fan don't need me, and Sydney don't care whether I come or not, so I\n'll keep out of the way,\" she would say, as if to excuse her seeming\nindolence.\n\nPolly was not at all like herself that winter, and those nearest to her\nsaw and wondered at it most. Will got very anxious, she was so quiet,\npale and spiritless, and distracted poor Polly by his affectionate\nstupidity, till she completed his bewilderment by getting cross and\nscolding him. So he consoled himself with Maud, who, now being in her\nteens, assumed dignified airs, and ordered him about in a style that\nafforded him continued amusement and employment.\n\nWestern news continued vague, for Fan's general inquiries produced only\nprovokingly unsatisfactory replies from Tom, who sang the praises of\n\"the beautiful Miss Bailey,\" and professed to be consumed by a hopeless\npassion for somebody, in such half-comic, half-tragic terms, that the\ngirls could not decide whether it was \"all that boy's mischief,\" or only\na cloak to hide the dreadful truth.\n\n\"We'll have it out of him when he comes home in the spring,\" said Fanny\nto Polly, as they compared the letters of their brothers, and agreed\nthat \"men were the most uncommunicative and provoking animals under\nthe sun.\" For Ned was so absorbed in business that he ignored the whole\nBailey question and left them in utter darkness.\n\nHunger of any sort is a hard thing to bear, especially when the sufferer\nhas a youthful appetite, and Polly was kept on such a short allowance of\nhappiness for six months, that she got quite thin and interesting; and\noften, when she saw how big her eyes were getting, and how plainly the\nveins on her temples showed, indulged the pensive thought that perhaps\nspring dandelions might blossom o'er her grave. She had no intention of\ndying till Tom's visit was over, however, and as the time drew near,\nshe went through such alternations of hope and fear, and lived in such a\nstate of feverish excitement, that spirits and color came back, and she\nsaw that the interesting pallor she had counted on would be an entire\nfailure.\n\nMay came at last, and with it a burst of sunshine which cheered even\npoor Polly's much-enduring heart. Fanny came walking in upon her one\nday, looking as if she brought tidings of such great joy that she hardly\nknew how to tell them.\n\n\"Prepare yourself somebody is engaged!\" she said, in a solemn tone,\nthat made Polly put up her hand as if to ward off an expected blow. \"No,\ndon't look like that, my poor dear; it is n't Tom, it's I!\"\n\nOf course there was a rapture, followed by one of the deliciously\nconfidential talks which bosom friends enjoy, interspersed with tears\nand kisses, smiles and sighs.\n\n\"Oh, Polly, though I've waited and hoped so long I could n't believe it\nwhen it came, and don't deserve it; but I will! for the knowledge that\nhe loves me seems to make everything possible,\" said Fanny, with an\nexpression which made her really beautiful, for the first time in her\nlife.\n\n\"You happy girl!\" sighed Polly, then smiled and added, \"I think you\ndeserve all that's come to you, for you have truly tried to be worthy\nof it, and whether it ever came or not that would have been a thing to\nbe proud of.\"\n\n\"He says that is what made him love me,\" answered Fanny, never calling\nher lover by his name, but making the little personal pronoun a very\nsweet word by the tone in which she uttered it. \"He was disappointed in\nme last year, he told me, but you said good things about me and though\nhe did n't care much then, yet when he lost you, and came back to me, he\nfound that you were not altogether mistaken, and he has watched me\nall this winter, learning to respect and love me better every day. Oh,\nPolly, when he said that, I could n't bear it, because in spite of all\nmy trying, I'm still so weak and poor and silly.\"\n\n\"We don't think so; and I know you'll be all he hopes to find you, for\nhe's just the husband you ought to have.\"\n\n\"Thank you all the more, then, for not keeping him yourself,\" said\nFanny, laughing the old blithe laugh again.\n\n\"That was only a slight aberration of his; he knew better all the time.\nIt was your white cloak and my idiotic behavior the night we went to the\nopera that put the idea into his head,\" said Polly, feeling as if the\nevents of that evening had happened some twenty years ago, when she was\na giddy young thing, fond of gay bonnets and girlish pranks.\n\n\"I'm not going to tell Tom a word about it, but keep it for a surprise\ntill he comes. He will be here next week, and then we'll have a\ngrand clearing up of mysteries,\" said Fan, evidently feeling that the\nmillennium was at hand.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Polly, as her heart fluttered and then sunk, for this\nwas a case where she could do nothing but hope, and keep her hands busy\nwith Will's new set of shirts.\n\nThere is a good deal more of this sort of silent suffering than the\nworld suspects, for the \"women who dare\" are few, the women who \"stand\nand wait\" are many. But if work-baskets were gifted with powers of\nspeech, they could tell stories more true and tender than any we read.\nFor women often sew the tragedy or comedy of life into their work as\nthey sit apparently safe and serene at home, yet are thinking deeply,\nliving whole heart-histories, and praying fervent prayers while they\nembroider pretty trifles or do the weekly mending.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. TOM'S SUCCESS\n\n\n     \"Come, Philander, let us be a marching,\n     Every one his true love a searching,\"\n\nWOULD be the most appropriate motto for this chapter, because,\nintimidated by the threats, denunciations, and complaints showered upon\nme in consequence of taking the liberty to end a certain story as I\nliked, I now yield to the amiable desire of giving satisfaction, and,\nat the risk of outraging all the unities, intend to pair off everybody I\ncan lay my hands on.\n\nOccasionally a matrimonial epidemic appears, especially toward spring,\ndevastating society, thinning the ranks of bachelordom, and leaving\nmothers lamenting for their fairest daughters. That spring the disease\nbroke out with great violence in the Shaw circle, causing paternal heads\nmuch bewilderment, as one case after another appeared with alarming\nrapidity. Fanny, as we have seen, was stricken first, and hardly had she\nbeen carried safely through the crisis, when Tom returned to swell the\nlist of victims. As Fanny was out a good deal with her Arthur, who was\nsure that exercise was necessary for the convalescent, Polly went every\nday to see Mrs. Shaw, who found herself lonely, though much better than\nusual, for the engagement had a finer effect upon her constitution than\nany tonic she ever tried. Some three days after Fan's joyful call Polly\nwas startled on entering the Shaws' door, by Maud, who came tumbling\ndown stairs, sending an avalanche of words before her, \"He's come\nbefore he said he should to surprise us! He's up in mamma's room,\nand was just saying, 'How's Polly?' when I heard you come, in your\ncreep-mouse way, and you must go right up. He looks so funny with\nwhiskers, but he's ever so nice, real big and brown, and he swung me\nright up when he kissed me. Never mind your bonnet, I can't wait.\"\n\nAnd pouncing upon Polly, Maud dragged her away like a captured ship\ntowed by a noisy little steam-tug.\n\n\"The sooner it's over the better for me,\" was the only thought Polly\nhad time for before she plunged into the room above, propelled by Maud,\nwho cried triumphantly, \"There he is! Ain't he splendid?\"\n\nFor a minute, everything danced before Polly's eyes, as a hand shook\nhers warmly, and a gruffish voice said heartily, \"How are you, Polly?\"\nThen she slipped into a chair beside Mrs. Shaw, hoping that her reply\nhad been all right and proper, for she had not the least idea what she\nsaid.\n\nThings got steady again directly, and while Maud expatiated on the great\nsurprise, Polly ventured to look at Tom, feeling glad that her back\nwas toward the light, and his was not. It was not a large room, and Tom\nseemed to fill it entirely; not that he had grown so very much, except\nbroader in the shoulders, but there was a brisk, genial, free-and-easy\nair about him, suggestive of a stirring, out-of-door life, with people\nwho kept their eyes wide open, and were not very particular what they\ndid with their arms and legs. The rough-and-ready travelling suit, stout\nboots, brown face, and manly beard, changed him so much, that Polly\ncould find scarcely a trace of elegant Tom Shaw in the hearty-looking\nyoung man who stood with one foot on a chair, while he talked business\nto his father in a sensible way, which delighted the old gentleman.\nPolly liked the change immensely, and sat listening to the state of\nWestern trade with as much interest as if it had been the most thrilling\nromance, for, as he talked, Tom kept looking at her with a nod or a\nsmile so like old times, that for a little while, she forgot Maria\nBailey, and was in bliss.\n\nBy and by Fanny came flying in, and gave Tom a greater surprise than his\nhad been. He had not the least suspicion of what had been going on at\nhome, for Fan had said to herself, with girlish malice, \"If he don't\nchoose to tell me his secrets, I'm not going to tell mine,\" and had\nsaid nothing about Sydney, except an occasional allusion to his\nbeing often there, and very kind. Therefore, when she announced her\nengagement, Tom looked so staggered for a minute, that Fan thought he\ndid n't like it; but after the first surprise passed, he showed such an\naffectionate satisfaction, that she was both touched and flattered.\n\n\"What do you think of this performance?\" asked Tom, wheeling round to\nPolly, who still sat by Mrs. Shaw, in the shadow of the bed-curtains.\n\n\"I like it very much,\" she said in such a hearty tone, that Tom could\nnot doubt the genuineness of her pleasure.\n\n\"Glad of that. Hope you'll be as well pleased with another engagement\nthat's coming out before long\"; and with an odd laugh, Tom carried\nSydney off to his den, leaving the girls to telegraph to one another the\nawful message, \"It is Maria Bailey.\"\n\nHow she managed to get through that evening, Polly never knew, yet it\nwas not a long one, for at eight o'clock she slipped out of the room,\nmeaning to run home alone, and not compel any one to serve as escort.\nBut she did not succeed, for as she stood warming her rubbers at the\ndining-room fire, wondering pensively as she did so if Maria Bailey\nhad small feet, and if Tom ever put her rubbers on for her, the\nlittle overshoes were taken out of her hands, and Tom's voice said,\nreproachfully, \"Did you really mean to run away, and not let me go home\nwith you?\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid; I did n't want to take you away,\" began Polly,\nsecretly hoping that she did n't look too pleased.\n\n\"But I like to be taken away. Why, it's a whole year since I went home\nwith you; do you remember that?\" said Tom, flapping the rubbers about\nwithout any signs of haste.\n\n\"Does it seem long?\"\n\n\"Everlasting!\"\n\nPolly meant to say that quite easily, and smile incredulously at his\nanswer; but in spite of the coquettish little rose-colored hood she\nwore, and which she knew was very becoming, she did not look or speak\ngayly, and Tom saw something in the altered face that made him say\nhastily, \"I'm afraid you've been doing too much this winter; you look\ntired out, Polly.\"\n\n\"Oh, no! it suits me to be very busy,\" and she began to drag on her\ngloves as if to prove it.\n\n\"But it does n't suit me to have you get thin and pale, you know.\"\n\nPolly looked up to thank him, but never did, for there was something\ndeeper than gratitude in the honest blue eyes, that could not hide\nthe truth entirely. Tom saw it, flushed all over his brown face, and\ndropping the rubbers with a crash, took her hands, saying, in his old\nimpetuous way, \"Polly, I want to tell you something!\"\n\n\"Yes, I know, we've been expecting it. I hope you'll be very happy,\nTom;\" and Polly shook his hands with a smile that was more pathetic than\na flood of tears.\n\n\"What!\" cried Tom, looking as if he thought she had lost her mind.\n\n\"Ned told us all about her; he thought it would be so, and when you\nspoke of another engagement, we knew you meant your own.\"\n\n\"But I did n't! Ned's the man; he told me to tell you. It's just\nsettled.\"\n\n\"Is it Maria?\" cried Polly, holding on to a chair as if to be prepared\nfor anything.\n\n\"Of course. Who else should it be?\"\n\n\"He did n't say you talked about her most and so we thought\" stammered\nPolly, falling into a sudden flutter.\n\n\"That I was in love? Well, I am, but not with her.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" and Polly caught her breath as if a dash of cold water had fallen\non her, for the more in earnest Tom grew, the blunter he became.\n\n\"Do you want to know the name of the girl I've loved for more than a\nyear? Well, it's Polly!\" As he spoke, Tom stretched out his arms to\nher, with the sort of mute eloquence that cannot be resisted, and Polly\nwent straight into them, without a word.\n\nNever mind what happened for a little bit. Love scenes, if genuine, are\nindescribable; for to those who have enacted them, the most elaborate\ndescription seems tame, and to those who have not, the simplest picture\nseems overdone. So romancers had better let imagination paint for them\nthat which is above all art, and leave their lovers to themselves during\nthe happiest minutes of their lives.\n\nBefore long, Tom and Polly were sitting side by side, enjoying the\nblissful state of mind which usually follows the first step out of our\nwork-a-day world, into the glorified region wherein lovers rapturously\nexist for a month or two. Tom just sat and looked at Polly as if he\nfound it difficult to believe that the winter of his discontent had\nended in this glorious spring. But Polly, being a true woman, asked\nquestions, even while she laughed and cried for joy.\n\n\"Now, Tom, how could I know you loved me when you went away and never\nsaid a word?\" she began, in a tenderly reproachful tone, thinking of the\nhard year she had spent.\n\n\"And how could I have the courage to say a word, when I had nothing on\nthe face of the earth to offer you but my worthless self?\" answered Tom,\nwarmly.\n\n\"That was all I wanted!\" whispered Polly, in a tone which caused him to\nfeel that the race of angels was not entirely extinct.\n\n\"I've always been fond of you, my Polly, but I never realized how fond\ntill just before I went away. I was n't free, you know, and besides I\nhad a strong impression that you liked Sydney in spite of the damper\nwhich Fan hinted you gave him last winter. He's such a capital fellow,\nI really don't see how you could help it.\"\n\n\"It is strange; I don't understand it myself; but women are queer\ncreatures, and there's no accounting for their tastes,\" said Polly,\nwith a sly look, which Tom fully appreciated.\n\n\"You were so good to me those last days, that I came very near speaking\nout, but could n't bear to seem to be offering you a poor, disgraced\nsort of fellow, whom Trix would n't have, and no one seemed to think\nworth much. 'No,' I said to myself, 'Polly ought to have the best; if\nSyd can get her, let him, and I won't say a word. I'll try to be better\nworthy her friendship, anyway; and perhaps, when I've proved that I\ncan do something, and am not ashamed to work, then, if Polly is free, I\nshan't be afraid to try my chance.' So I held my tongue, worked like a\nhorse, satisfied myself and others that I could get my living honestly,\nand then came home to see if there was any hope for me.\"\n\n\"And I was waiting for you all the time,\" said a soft voice close to his\nshoulder; for Polly was much touched by Tom's manly efforts to deserve\nher.\n\n\"I did n't mean to do it the first minute, but look about me a little,\nand be sure Syd was all right. But Fan's news settled that point, and\njust now the look in my Polly's face settled the other. I could n't wait\nanother minute, or let you either, and I could n't help stretching out\nmy arms to my little wife, God bless her, though I know I don't deserve\nher.\"\n\nTom's voice got lower and lower as he spoke, and his face was full of\nan emotion of which he need not be ashamed, for a very sincere love\nennobled him, making him humble, where a shallower affection would have\nbeen proud of its success. Polly understood this, and found the honest,\nhearty speech of her lover more eloquent than poetry itself. Her hand\nstole up to his cheek, and she leaned her own confidingly against the\nrough coat, as she said, in her frank simple way, \"Tom, dear, don't say\nthat, as if I was the best girl in the world. I've got ever so many\nfaults, and I want you to know them all, and help me cure them, as you\nhave your own. Waiting has not done us any harm, and I love you all the\nbetter for your trial. But I'm afraid your year has been harder than\nmine, you look so much older and graver than when you went away. You\nnever would complain; but I've had a feeling that you were going\nthrough a good deal more than any of us guessed.\"\n\n\"Pretty tough work at first, I own. It was all so new and strange, I\n'm afraid I should n't have stood it if it had not been for Ned. He'd\nlaugh and say 'Pooh!' if he heard me say it, but it's true nevertheless\nthat he's a grand fellow and helped me through the first six months\nlike a well, a brother as he is. There was no reason why he should go\nout of his way to back up a shiftless party like me, yet he did, and\nmade many things easy and safe that would have been confoundedly hard\nand dangerous if I'd been left to myself. The only way I can explain it\nis that it's a family trait, and as natural to the brother as it is to\nthe sister.\"\n\n\"It's a Shaw trait to do the same. But tell me about Maria; is Ned\nreally engaged to her?\"\n\n\"Very much so; you'll get a letter full of raptures tomorrow; he had\nn't time to send by me, I came off in such a hurry. Maria is a sensible,\npretty girl and Ned will be a happy old fellow.\"\n\n\"Why did you let us think it was you?\"\n\n\"I only teased Fan a little; I did like Maria, for she reminded me of\nyou sometimes, and was such a kind, cosy little woman I could n't help\nenjoying her society after a hard day's work. But Ned got jealous, and\nthen I knew that he was in earnest, so I left him a clear field, and\npromised not to breathe a word to any one till he had got a Yes or No\nfrom his Maria.\"\n\n\"I wish I'd known it,\" sighed Polly. \"People in love always do such\nstupid things!\"\n\n\"So they do; for neither you nor Fan gave us poor fellows the least hint\nabout Syd, and there I've been having all sorts of scares about you.\"\n\n\"Serves us right; brothers and sisters should n't have secrets from each\nother.\"\n\n\"We never will again. Did you miss me very much?\"\n\n\"Yes, Tom; very, very much.\"\n\n\"My patient little Polly!\"\n\n\"Did you really care for me before you went?\"\n\n\"See if I did n't;\" and with great pride Tom produced a portly\npocket-book stuffed with business-like documents of a most imposing\nappearance, opened a private compartment, and took out a worn-looking\npaper, unfolded it carefully, and displayed a small brown object which\ngave out a faint fragrance.\n\n\"That's the rose you put in the birthday cake, and next week we'll\nhave a fresh one in another jolly little cake which you'll make me; you\nleft it on the floor of my den the night we talked there, and I've kept\nit ever since. There's love and romance for you!\"\n\nPolly touched the little relic, treasured for a year, and smiled to read\nthe words \"My Polly's rose,\" scribbled under the crumbling leaves.\n\n\"I did n't know you could be so sentimental,\" she said, looking so\npleased that he did not regret confessing his folly.\n\n\"I never was till I loved you, my dear, and I'm not very bad yet, for I\ndon't wear my posy next my heart, but where I can see it every day, and\nso never forget for whom I am working. Should n't wonder if that bit\nof nonsense had kept me economical, honest, and hard at it, for I never\nopened my pocket-book that I did n't think of you.\"\n\n\"That's lovely, Tom,\" and Polly found it so touching that she felt for\nher handkerchief; but Tom took it away, and made her laugh instead of\ncry, by saying, in a wheedlesome tone, \"I don't believe you did as much,\nfor all your romance. Did you, now?\"\n\n\"If you won't laugh, I'll show you my treasures. I began first, and I\n've worn them longest.\"\n\nAs she spoke, Polly drew out the old locket, opened it, and showed the\npicture Tom gave her in the bag of peanuts cut small and fitted in on\none side on the other was a curl of reddish hair and a black button. How\nTom laughed when he saw them!\n\n\"You don't mean you've kept that frightful guy of a boy all this time?\nPolly! Polly! you are the most faithful'loveress,' as Maud says, that\nwas ever known.\"\n\n\"Don't flatter yourself that I've worn it all these years, sir; I only\nput it in last spring because I did n't dare to ask for one of the new\nones. The button came off the old coat you insisted on wearing after the\nfailure, as if it was your duty to look as shabby as possible, and the\ncurl I stole from Maud. Are n't we silly?\"\n\nHe did not seem to think so, and after a short pause for refreshments,\nPolly turned serious, and said anxiously, \"When must you go back to your\nhard work?\"\n\n\"In a week or two; but it won't seem drudgery now, for you'll write\nevery day, and I shall feel that I'm working to get a home for you.\nThat will give me a forty-man-power, and I'll pay up my debts and get a\ngood start, and then Ned and I will be married and go into partnership,\nand we'll all be the happiest, busiest people in the West.\"\n\n\"It sounds delightful; but won't it take a long time, Tom?\"\n\n\"Only a few years, and we need n't wait a minute after Syd is paid, if\nyou don't mind beginning rather low down, Polly.\"\n\n\"I'd rather work up with you, than sit idle while you toil away all\nalone. That's the way father and mother did, and I think they were very\nhappy in spite of the poverty and hard work.\"\n\n\"Then we'll do it by another year, for I must get more salary before I\ntake you away from a good home here. I wish, oh, Polly, how I wish I had\na half of the money I've wasted, to make you comfortable, now.\"\n\n\"Never mind, I don't want it; I'd rather have less, and know you earned\nit all yourself,\" cried Polly, as Tom struck his hand on his knee with\nan acute pang of regret at the power he had lost.\n\n\"It's like you to say it, and I won't waste any words bewailing myself,\nbecause I was a fool. We will work up together, my brave Polly, and you\nshall yet be proud of your husband, though he is'poor Tom Shaw.'\"\n\nShe was as sure of that as if an oracle had foretold it, and was not\ndeceived; for the loving heart that had always seen, believed, and\ntried to strengthen all good impulses in Tom, was well repaid for its\ninstinctive trust by the happiness of the years to come.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, hopefully, \"I know you will succeed, for the best thing\na man can have, is work with a purpose in it, and the will to do it\nheartily.\"\n\n\"There is one better thing, Polly,\" answered Tom, turning her face up a\nlittle, that he might see his inspiration shining in her eyes.\n\n\"What is it, dear?\"\n\n\"A good woman to love and help him all his life, as you will me, please\nGod.\"\n\n\"Even though she is old-fashioned,\" whispered Polly, with happy eyes,\nthe brighter for their tears, as she looked up at the young man, who,\nthrough her, had caught a glimpse of the truest success, and was not\nashamed to owe it to love and labor, two beautiful old fashions that\nbegan long ago, with the first pair in Eden.\n\nLest any of my young readers who have honored Maud with their interest\nshould suffer the pangs of unsatisfied curiosity as to her future, I\nwill add for their benefit that she did not marry Will, but remained a\nbusy, lively spinster all her days, and kept house for her father in the\nmost delightful manner.\n\nWill's ministerial dream came to pass in the course of time, however,\nand a gentle, bright-eyed lady ruled over the parsonage, whom the\nreverend William called his \"little Jane.\"\n\nFarther into futurity even this rash pen dares not proceed, but pauses\nhere, concluding in the words of the dear old fairy tales, \"And so they\nwere married, and all lived happily till they died.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's An Old-fashioned Girl, by Louisa May Alcott\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK AN OLD-FASHIONED GIRL ***\n\n***** This file should be named 2787-8.txt or 2787-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/7\/8\/2787\/\n\nProduced by David Reed\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":923,"split":"train"}
