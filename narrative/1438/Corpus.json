{"ori_id":"f54615bb99bbb62503c7d55d2cf6a49c2168a46e","title":"Buried (film)","context":"Buried (film)\n On October 23, 2006, Paul Conroy, an American civilian truck driver working in Iraq, wakes up and finds himself buried alive in a wooden coffin, bound and gagged, with only a Zippo lighter and a BlackBerry phone at hand. Although he initially has no idea how he got there, he starts to piece together what has happened to him. He remembers that his and several other trucks were ambushed by terrorists, who killed his colleagues; he was hit by a rock and passed out. He receives a call from his kidnapper, Jabir, demanding that he pay a ransom of $5 million by 9PM or he will be left in the coffin to die.\nConroy calls the State Department, which tells him that due to the government policy of not negotiating with terrorists, it will not pay the ransom but will try to rescue him. They connect him with Dan Brenner, head of the Hostage Working Group, who tells Conroy they are doing their best to find him.\nHis kidnapper calls Conroy and demands he make a ransom video, threatening to execute one of his colleagues who survived the attack. Conroy insists that no one will pay $5 million, so the kidnapper drops the amount to $1 million. Despite his compliance in making a video, the kidnappers execute his colleague and send him the recording of it, which he watches in horror. Shortly afterwards, distant explosions shake the area, damaging his coffin, which begins to slowly fill with sand. Conroy continues sporadic phone calls with Brenner, skeptical of the man's promises of help. To reaffirm his wholehearted intentions, Brenner tells Conroy about a 26-year-old named Mark White who was rescued from a similar situation three weeks previously, telling him that the kid is home with his family and happy.\nLater on, Conroy receives a phone call from his employers, who inform him that he was fired from his job due to an alleged prohibited relationship with a colleague (the one who was executed), and thus he and his family will not be entitled to any benefits or pension he earned during his time with the company. Brenner calls back and explains that the explosions that had damaged his coffin earlier were in fact several F-16 bombings, and that his kidnappers may have been killed. Conroy begins to lose all hope and does a last will and testament in video form, giving his son all of his clothes and his wife his personal savings. Jabir calls back demanding that Conroy video record himself cutting his finger off, threatening Conroy's family back home in Michigan if he refuses, saying that he lost all of his children. Conroy records himself cutting off one of his fingers and sends the video.\nShortly after making the video, the cell phone rings, Paul begins to hear shovels and distorted voices. The voices come clearer, saying to open the coffin, and the coffin opens. But abruptly, it becomes obvious he hallucinated the encounter.\nAfter some minutes, Brenner calls, notifying Conroy that they have found his location and are driving out to find him. Then Conroy's wife Linda calls him, so Conroy hangs up on Brenner. She cries with him and begs him to promise her that he will come home. He promises, but hangs up due to another call from Brenner. Brenner reports that they have found the site. The group starts to dig up a coffin, but Conroy cannot hear anyone near the coffin. When they open it, the coffin turns out to be Mark White's, not Conroy's, indicating that White was never rescued. Paul starts to cry as he realizes he is not going to be saved. The sand fills his coffin and he suffocates to death as the light goes out and the screen goes black. The last thing we hear is Brenner, repeating, \"I'm sorry, Paul. I'm so sorry.\" as the connection finally times out and the end credits begin to roll.\n<html>\n<head><title>Buried Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Buried script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Buried script, Buried movie script, Buried film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

      Written by\n\n                                Chris Sparling\n\n\n                         \n\n<b>                         FADE IN:\n<\/b>\n<b>          INT. UNKNOWN ROOM - NIGHT\n<\/b>\n          Darkness. Silence. After a long beat, we hear movement,\n          confined and contained.\n          We then hear the sound of a man, PAUL CONROY, groaning,\n          making confused attempts at words. We hear his movement;\n          short, abrupt shifting, ending almost immediately with the\n          sound of his body banging against wood.\n          He screams, though it's clear from the sound that his mouth\n          is covered by something.\n          After attempting to sit up, he immediately bangs his head\n          against something. It's terribly warm and his breaths are\n          labored.\n          He attempts to move to his left and right, only to find that\n          he is confined on those sides, as well. He frantically\n          shifts about, only to discover, by touch, that he is encased\n          in something.\n          Something is very wrong, and he doesn't need to see to know\n          that.\n          Finally, we see him, lit by the flame of the Zippo he holds\n          in his hands, which are bound together in front of him with\n          rope. A rolled-up, dirty rag is tied tightly around his\n          head, stretched across his mouth. Dried blood stains his\n          hair and forehead.\n\n                         \n          We see that he is lying in an old fashioned, wooden coffin.\n          Nothing more than a few rotted-out planks of wood nailed\n          together. Realizing the same, Paul is struck by an\n          overwhelming, instant panic.\n          With great difficulty, and while still holding the lit Zippo,\n          Paul removes the muzzle from his mouth.\n\n<b>                          PAUL\n<\/b>           What...? What is this?\n          His words become almost unintelligible as he flails about,\n          though fear is understood in his every utterance.\n          He screams aloud, but his voice is captured by the coffin\n          walls.\n\n<b>           2.\n<\/b>\n                         \n\n                         \n\n<b>                          PAUL\n<\/b>           Oh my God! Help me!! Help me!!\n          He kicks and slams his hands against the top and sides of the\n          coffin, all to no avail. His violent movements cause small\n          grains of sand to trickle in through the space between the\n          sides and top of the coffin, as well as a small gap that\n          exists between one of the coffin's broken wooden planks.\n          Sweat cascades down the side of his neck, dripping from his\n          dampened brow. The heat inside the extremely close confines\n          of the coffin is stifling.\n\n<b>                          PAUL (CONT'D)\n<\/b>           Somebody help me! Please!!\n          Paul continues with his futile efforts to pry off the top of\n          the coffin. The sides, the top, the bottom -- all are too\n          thoroughly reinforced by the force of what surrounds the\n          coffin. Sand. It becomes clear to him that he is buried.\n          He tries his best to calm himself, though he has trouble\n          catching his breath. It takes him some time, but he\n          eventually achieves some semblance of calm.\n          Getting a good look at him for the first time, we see that\n          Paul is somewhere around 37 years old. Unshaven and\n          physically unremarkable, he embodies the blue-collar American\n          everyman.\n          He coughs. The minimal amount of oxygen in the coffin makes\n          it hard for him to breathe.\n          His eyes widen a bit upon seeing an exposed, rusty nail. He\n          tries desperately to use the nail to cut through the old,\n          frayed ropes that bind his hands. Doing so is no easy task.\n          The incredibly tight quarters makes his every action nearly\n          impossible.\n          After a lengthy struggle, the rope snaps. Paul quickly frees\n          his hands. A small victory. Very small.\n          The heat is unbearable. Paul takes off his button-down\n          shirt, leaving him in a T-shirt. His body battles against\n          the walls and the ceiling of the coffin with every move he\n          makes.\n          He tosses his button-down shirt down by his feet. His\n          undershirt is drenched through with sweat.\n          Still trying to calm himself, but having little success in\n          doing so, Paul looks around the coffin. His feet, though\n          only his body-length away, seem miles from him.\n\n<b>           3.\n<\/b>\n                         \n\n                         \n          He looks at the top of the coffin, and then back at his feet.\n          With great difficulty, he shifts his body so that his feet\n          are pressed against the top of the coffin. He attempts to\n          use his leg strength to push the top off of him, but it\n          doesn't move even a millimeter.\n          After several failed attempts, and with his legs exhausted,\n          Paul drops his feet from the top of the coffin. He lay for a\n          moment in silence, followed by an outburst of crying.\n          Close to his head, on the corner of the floor, we see there's\n          another broken plank. A small hole.\n          He closes his cigarette lighter, extinguishing the flame. In\n          total darkness, he continues to cry.\n\n                         \n\n<b>                          PAUL (CONT'D)\n<\/b>           What is this?\n          With his sobbing slowly subsiding, the coffin soon grows\n          eerily silent.\n          The sound of Paul's labored breaths are all we hear, softened\n          under the blanket of absolute darkness.\n          After a beat, the silence is interrupted by a subtle buzzing\n          sound. The muted sight of strange, blueish light flickers in\n          the coffin, by Paul's feet. He is extremely startled.\n          The buzzing continues, as does the minimal splashing of\n          light. It's coming from underneath his discarded button-down\n          shirt, down near his feet.\n          He lights the Zippo to get a better look.\n\n                         \n          Pulling the shirt away, he realizes that what he is hearing\n          and seeing is the vibrating ring and display features of an\n          older model cell phone.\n          He frantically reaches for it, though the coffin is far too\n          small for him to reposition himself so easily.\n          To his dismay, the phone stops ringing. But, his efforts to\n          reach it continue. He uses his feet to search for the phone.\n          After some trouble finding it, he eventually locates it.\n          Clamping the phone together between his clasped feet, Paul\n          then painfully angles his body so that he can reach his feet\n          with his hands and grab it.\n          He is soon able to reach it. Immediately thereafter, he\n          flips open the phone and puts the receiver in front of him.\n\n<b>           4.\n<\/b>\n                         \n\n                         \n          We see that there is a Text Message waiting for Paul on the\n          phone. However, Paul barely notices.\n          The time on the phone reads 6:12pm. While the numbers and\n          display screen icons are familiar to Americans, all the words\n          are in Arabic.\n          What he does notices is that the phone barely has one bar of\n          signal strength. Worse yet, there is only half of the\n          battery life remaining.\n          He tries to remember the Safe Number he was given. With the\n          phone open and ready to be dialed, Paul struggles to recall\n          the information.\n\n<b>                          PAUL (CONT'D)\n<\/b>           Come on, come on.

He screams and\n          flails his feet and hands wildly, banging them against the\n          walls of the coffin. His animalistic outburst causes the\n          phone to close.\n          The coffin returns to pitch black.\n          After a long beat, Paul lights the Zippo, which remains\n          wedged in the sand compacted against the small hole in the\n          wall of the coffin.\n\n                         \n          Paul takes a few moments to catch his breath. He looks again\n          at the cell phone. Remembers receiving a Text Message.\n          The icon on the phone's display indicates that he does, in\n          fact, have an unread Text Message waiting for him.\n          Paul quickly scrolls through the phone's menu, which is all\n          written in Arabic, until he reaches what appears to be the\n          Text Message option. Opening it, he sees a series of ten\n          numbers.\n          Using his click-up pencil, he scribbles the numbers onto the\n          top of the coffin. Next to the number, he writes the word\n          \"HELP?\" Noticing that his phone has again picked-up a\n          signal, he dials the number.\n\n<b>           17.\n<\/b>\n                         \n\n                         \n          It rings once, but then the reception begins to falter.\n          After only two rings, the call is ended. Paul's frustration\n          mounts. He is barely able to fight off another fit of\n          hysterics. He dials the number again.\n          It rings once. A second ring. In the middle of the third\n          ring, someone answers -- but they do not say anything.\n\n<b>                          PAUL\n<\/b>           Hello? Hello? Is anyone there?\n           Hello?\n          After a beat, Paul hears breathing on the other end of the\n          phone. He also hears a discordance of background sound; the\n          din of a room filled with Arabic-speaking men.\n\n<b>                          PAUL (CONT'D)\n<\/b>           Hello? Who are you?

It becomes clear that Jabir is\n          responsible for all of this.

Physically spent,\n          the cell phone falls from his hands and onto the floor.

Paul holds it in his hand, using it to\n          illuminate the inside of the coffin. He attempts to push it\n          into its now customary resting place, but the sand has\n          loosened, making it difficult for the Zippo to stay in place.\n          It almost falls to the floor.\n\n<b>           20.\n<\/b>\n                         \n\n                         \n          Looking around, Paul sees there is a crack between two\n          planks, located on the opposite wall of the coffin.

He can see the\n          protruding corner of the metal box, but it's positioned in\n          such a way that it will clearly not be easy for him to reach\n          it.\n          Paul then tries to clasp the box with his feet, but after\n          several unsuccessful attempts, he realizes that a new\n          strategy is necessary.\n\n<b>           38.\n<\/b>\n                         \n\n                         \n          He makes efforts to reposition himself in the coffin, so that\n          his head and feet will ultimately switch places. He\n          struggles, inch by troubled inch, to make this maneuver.\n          Sweat pours down the side of his face. The extremely tight\n          quarters of the coffin make the repositioning nearly\n          impossible.\n          After expending a great deal of energy doing so, Paul\n          eventually completes the turn of his body. He examines the\n          small, rusted metal box. On it is a cartoon picture of a\n          small Arab boy and girl playing with a red rubber ball.\n          Skeptical at first, Paul carefully examines the box and\n          shakes it gently. Items are heard rummaging inside.\n          He carefully opens it. A fluorescent green light shines from\n          inside.\n          Paul looks inside and finds a lit, green glow stick,\n          fluorescing brightly and now illuminating much of the coffin.\n          He closes the lid of the Zippo. Removes the stick.\n          Looking into the small box again, he finds several other\n          items: a small, disused flashlight; a second, unlit glow\n          stick; a jackknife; and lastly, a folded piece of paper.\n          He slowly unfolds the piece of paper. We see that his ransom\n          message is written in an unintelligible mix of English and\n          Arabic.\n          Paul shakes his head and lets out a sigh of disgust. He\n          crumbles up the paper into a ball and listlessly drops it to\n          his side. He covers his face with his hands, his labored\n          breaths echoing in his palms.\n\n                         \n          Under the low-light of the green glow stick, Paul picks up\n          the phone and dials his home.\n          Per usual, he gets the answering machine. His son, Shane, is\n          heard on outgoing message.\n\n<b>                          SHANE\n<\/b>           Thanks for calling the Conroy's.\n           We're not home right now.

The ticking sound\n          of the second hand turning is inordinately loud, due to the\n          extreme silence of the coffin.\n          Just then, the cell phone rings.

Although they speak in Arabic, it is clear from\n          their tone that they are becoming worried and increasingly\n          hostile.\n          Jabir returns his attention back to Paul.\n\n                         \n\n<b>                          JABIR\n<\/b>           You make video now.\n          Jabir ends the call. Paul closes the phone to help conserve\n          battery life.\n          He then reopens the phone and scrolls through the menu\n          options. Everything is written in Arabic. He eventually\n          comes across an icon with a movie camera -- the video\n          function. He turns it on. Looks at himself though the\n          viewfinder.\n          After a beat, he closes the phone, clearly frustrated and\n          growing more panicked. His breaths grow heavy and rapid,\n          utilizing a great deal of oxygen.\n\n<b>           47.\n<\/b>\n                         \n\n                         \n\n<b>                          PAUL\n<\/b>           I'm never getting out of here.\n          Paul begins to freak out, restlessly squirming inside the\n          coffin and pressing against the sides and top.\n          The glow stick fades out almost completely, offering very\n          little light. Paul shakes it, but with no change to its\n          brightness. Moments later, it dies. Paul tries the\n          flashlight. Click-click. Click-click. Nothing.\n          He bangs it a few times with his hand. The white light turns\n          on, but quickly turns back off. He twists the top, which\n          causes the flashlight to switch bulbs. A red beam emits\n          momentarily. Paul twists the top again and gives the\n          flashlight a few good whacks.\n\n                         \n          It turns on. White light shines dimly on his face.\n          He takes a breath.\n          In efforts to calm himself, he once again removes the orange\n          pill bottle from his pocket. He pours two into his hand. He\n          then removes his small, metal alcohol flask from his back\n          pocket and takes a large swig, swallowing the two pills in\n          the process.\n          Still, Paul's heavy, labored breathing continues. He drops\n          four additional pills into his and swallows them with yet\n          another generous pull from the flask.\n          He sits and waits. Nothing is happening, except that his\n          extremely limited time keeps passing.\n          After a moment, Paul picks up the cell phone. He holds it in\n          front of him, hesitant to make a call. After some\n          consideration, he dials.\n          After a few rings, a NURSING HOME NURSE answers.\n\n<b>           NURSING HOME NURSE\n<\/b>           Mountain View Nursing Home.\n\n<b>                          PAUL\n<\/b>           I was hoping I could speak with\n           Maryanne Conroy, please.\n\n<b>           NURSING HOME NURSE\n<\/b>           Um...okay.

Decidedly different\n          than his past reactions to an incoming call, Paul seems\n          hopelessly disinterested. The ring is maddening.\n          He mindlessly presses the shortcut button, resetting the ring\n          to vibrate mode.\n          He eventually picks up the phone, but there is not anyone on\n          the other end. It's then that he sees that it was not a call\n          that came in, but instead was a picture message.\n          Pressing what appears to be the Accept button, the incoming\n          picture begins to download.\n          Several seconds later, the picture downloads and an image\n          appears on the display of Paul's cell phone. It's of a woman\n          -- bound and gagged, a gun pressed against the side of her\n          head.\n\n<b>                          PAUL\n<\/b>           Oh no.

It takes some trouble for him\n          to grab it, but he is soon able to.\n          Placing the flashlight next to the paper, Paul is again\n          reminded of the incoherent nature of the script.\n\n<b>                          PAUL\n<\/b>           (re: the script)\n           Fuck...\n          He drops the paper to his side and opens the phone, setting\n          it to the video record function. He places the flashlight\n          close to his face so as to make his image more visible on the\n          small, phone display screen.\n\n                         \n          He presses the record button.\n\n<b>                          PAUL\n<\/b>           (speaking at the phone)\n           My name is Paul Conroy.

I've been taken hostage\n           somewhere in Iraq...and I need one\n           million dollars by nine o'clock\n           tonight, Baghdad time, or else I'll\n           be left to die in this coffin I'm\n           buried in.

After a few quick smacks, the flashlight turns\n          back on.\n\n<b>                          PAUL (CONT'D)\n<\/b>           ...the money is paid, I will be let\n           go. If it's not, I will die in\n           here. These threats are real and\n           will be followed through on.\n          Trying to think of more to say, Paul soon opts for not saying\n          anything further. He saves the message and then sends it to\n          Jabir.\n          We see that the screen displays an icon confirming the video\n          has been sent.\n          Paul places the phone on his chest. Still rubbing his\n          temples, his eyes begin to flutter a bit. He tries to\n          control his breathing and remain calm.\n\n<b>           53.\n<\/b>\n                         \n\n                         \n          He opens the phone and displays the photo of the Woman. He\n          stares admiringly at her, hoping dearly that she will not be\n          harmed.\n          The effects of the anxiety pills finally taking effect, his\n          eyes soon close and he drifts off to sleep.\n\n<b>                          FADE TO:\n<\/b>\n<b>          INT. COFFIN - LATER\n<\/b>\n          Darkness once again. We hear the sound of Paul slowly\n          awaking, followed the sight of Zippo sparks.\n          It doesn't catch. The second glow stick is snapped,\n          illuminating the coffin with a fluorescent green hue.\n\n                         \n          Paul starts to move, but suddenly freezes. His eyes widen.\n          His pupils dilate. Something is clearly very wrong, though\n          we cannot see what.\n          His eyes slowly shift downward, as if watching something move\n          down his body. Beads of sweat form across his brow. His\n          measured breaths are held for as long as they can be.\n          Moving excruciatingly slow, Paul lowers the glow stick toward\n          what he is looking at.\n          A shape moves across his stomach, underneath his T-shirt.\n          Paul's eyes are fixed on whatever it may be. He cautiously,\n          slowly, moves the glow stick even closer.\n          The shape disappears just as the light of the glow stick\n          shines on whatever it may be. Still, Paul does not dare make\n          any sudden move.\n\n                         \n          Paul's pant leg moves slightly, starting at the top, slowly\n          undulating toward his cuff.\n          Paul leans the glow stick in further. And further.\n          Carefully. Moving a millimeter at a time. He shifts the\n          position of his head slightly, charily, to see next to his\n          feet.\n          He leans in even closer with the glow stick. But then --\n          -- his wary movement comes to immediate stop.\n          It's a snake. A two-foot, saw-scaled viper. It has\n          positioned itself in the corner of the coffin, inches from\n          Paul's feet.\n\n<b>           54.\n<\/b>\n                         \n\n                         \n          His terror evident, Paul very slowly pulls his feet back\n          toward his upper body, away from the snake. The confined\n          space offers little room for safety.\n          The snake turns its muscled neck to face Paul. Their eyes\n          meet for the first time. The snake hisses, poised to strike\n          at any moment. Paul raises his foot. Steels himself.\n          Prepares to preempt the snake with a solid stomp.\n          A more sensible plan soon prevails. After lowering his foot,\n          Paul cautiously removes the flask from his pocket. Slowly\n          unscrews the top. Splashes a small amount of alcohol on the\n          floor, close to the snake.\n          The snake recoils slightly, but then menacingly twists itself\n          into a new posture, ready to attack. Paul lowers the Zippo\n          to the small puddle of alcohol. After a few sparks --\n\n                         \n          -- it lights. A flash-fire. The snake flails and hisses\n          wildly at the other side of a small fire wall.\n          The flame soon goes out. Paul moves fast. Throws more\n          alcohol, this time some of it lands on the snake itself. He\n          places the already lit Zippo against the puddle of alcohol\n          near the snake.\n          Another flash-fire, this time burning the snake. It hisses\n          loudly. Threateningly. It swings back and forth,\n          challenging the small wall of fire.\n          The fire soon extinguishes. The snake burrows into the hole\n          from where it likely entered the coffin, disappearing into it\n          with haste.\n          Paul hurriedly stuffs the hole with his discarded button-down\n          shirt. He then pours a small amount of alcohol over the\n          shirt and temporarily puts the flask on the ground, but does\n          not screw the cap on securely. He then wedges the lit Zippo\n          between a small space between two wooden planks.\n          With the snake situation handled, Paul finally lets out a\n          sigh of relief. Rubs his eyes. Tries to regain his\n          faculties. Looks over the list of phone numbers written\n          above him.\n          Suddenly, the cell phone vibrates. Paul frenziedly searches\n          for it, but he cannot find it. He then notices it has fallen\n          into the small hole near his feet, out of his reach.\n          He makes several attempts to grab the phone with his feet,\n          but he is unable to do so. It continues to ring.\n          His next efforts involve repositioning himself in the coffin\n          so that he completely turns to face the opposite end.\n\n<b>           55.\n<\/b>\n                         \n\n                         \n          Struggling through each move, Paul painstakingly begins to\n          turn himself. While turning, however, he inadvertently kicks\n          the Zippo from the side of the coffin -- landing it on the\n          floor, up against the glow stick -- and knocks over the\n          flask.\n          We see that the flame of the Zippo slowly melts the plastic\n          glow stick, causing it to dim slightly.\n          Worst still, and completely unbeknownst to Paul, a stream of\n          alcohol slowly makes its way from the flask and toward the\n          flame of the lighter, threatening to set the coffin ablaze.\n          Inch by inch, the flammable spirit gets closer.\n          Still in the midst of his repositioning, Paul looks back and\n          sees the alcohol nearing the flame. In a panic, he attempts\n          to reach and grab the Zippo. But, he finds himself stuck in\n          the middle of the coffin. He can't budge either way.\n\n<b>                          PAUL\n<\/b>           No, no, no!!\n          Desperately straining every muscle in his body, he extends\n          his arm backward toward the Zippo, hoping to move it away\n          from the spilled alcohol. He still can't reach it, yet he\n          tries with all his might.\n          The phone stops ringing. He has missed the call.\n          He tries blowing at the flame, but his head is too far away\n          and his breath is not strong enough to do much more than\n          cause it to flicker.\n          With the alcohol now mere inches away from the flame, Paul\n          reaches for his shoe. His odd positioning makes reaching his\n          foot almost impossible. He struggles to undo the laces and\n          remove it from his foot.\n          With his face beet red from the force of his strain, Paul\n          finally removes his shoe. The mere inch of leg room this\n          creates allows him to slide his leg out from under him.\n          The trail of alcohol is just about to come into contact with\n          the flame --\n          -- but Paul deftly maneuvers his body just in time to\n          awkwardly kick the Zippo out of the way and close the lid.\n          Paul breaths an enormous sigh of relief as he sits in the dim\n          light of the damaged glow stick. He notices another hole in\n          the coffin. As a precaution, he stuffs it with the cloth\n          that had previously been used to gag him.\n\n<b>           56.\n<\/b>\n                         \n\n                         \n          Just as he is about to grab the phone, he hears what appears\n          to be the faint sound of a Muslim call to prayer being\n          announced over the citywide PA system. The sound barely\n          makes its way through the hundreds of pounds of sand that\n          envelop the coffin.\n          A sign of hope, as well as a point of reference for his\n          location -- albeit a very vague one.\n          He listens further as the call to prayer continues. The\n          light of the glow stick dims further.\n          Paul then opens his phone. Sees that he missed Jabir's call.\n          He starts to call Jabir back, but stops. He instead\n          navigates through the various display menus. He soon reaches\n          what appears to be the Tools Menu, though it's difficult to\n          tell because everything is written in Arabic. He becomes\n          frustrated as he fails to find what he is looking for.\n          On the verge of mental surrender, he sees something that\n          gives him pause. A smile crosses his face.\n\n<b>                          PAUL\n<\/b>           (re: the phone screen)\n           There you are.\n          We see, on the display of the phone, that Paul has found a\n          listing of languages. He scrolls past many -- \"FRANCAIS,\n          DETSCHE, ESPANOL\" -- stopping at \"ENGLISH.\" Presses the\n          button, instantly making all the text on the screen readable.\n          He quickly navigates to the Tools menu. Scrolls down.\n          Locates the number of the cell phone he is using.\n          He scribbles the number onto the top of the coffin. Then a\n          second pass, making it bolder than the others.\n          Paul then dials his wife's cell phone. After only a few\n          rings, he is met by her voice mail.\n\n<b>           LINDA (V.O.)\n<\/b>           Hi, this is Linda. Please leave a\n           message.

It's 8:19pm.\n          Both are not good signs, and he knows it.\n\n<b>                          PAUL (CONT'D)\n<\/b>           Oh shit.\n          He begins to panic. Grabbing the pocket knife that was left\n          inside the metal box, he slides the blade in the space\n          between the sides of the coffin and the top.\n          Paul grabs the glow stick. But, because it was partially\n          melted to the floor, the stick snaps in two. Liquid oozes\n          out of the small portion of the stick that remains stuck the\n          floor.\n\n<b>                          PAUL\n<\/b>           Son of a...\n          Paul grabs the flashlight. Turns it on. It works for a\n          second, but then goes out. Shaking it only produces\n          intermittent beams of light.\n          He turns the top, switching to the red bulb. It works. The\n          coffin fills with a reddish hue, but then it, too, goes out.\n          Growing incensed, Paul switches back to the white bulb. It\n          works.\n          He returns his attention to the coffin. His efforts to use\n          the knife as a fulcrum are futile. Still, he tries. Bending\n          the blade well past its design, it nearly breaks off its\n          handle.\n          The flashlight turns off. After a good shaking, it turns\n          back on, emitting white light.\n          With oxygen levels extremely diminished, efforts of this kind\n          are all too much for Paul to take. He has to stop and try to\n          catch his breath.\n          As he endeavors to get his wind back, the cell phone rings.\n          Not a call this time, but instead a video message. It has\n          been sent by Jabir.\n          Paul's trepidation is evident. He fears what the incoming\n          video may show.\n\n<b>           58.\n<\/b>\n                         \n\n                         \n          After a beat, he presses the Accept button and the video\n          downloads. Within seconds, the video plays on his phone\n          display screen. We see, in the video, the American Woman\n          that previously appeared in a picture message that was sent\n          to Paul. She is still bound at her wrists, but her gag has\n          been lowered.\n          She sits on her knees. Standing behind her are three men,\n          all with their faces shielded by Arab headdresses. They each\n          hold AK-47 assault weapons.\n          Paul watches in horror as the terrified woman speaks, through\n          her tears, into the camera.\n\n<b>                          WOMAN\n<\/b>           My name is Pamela Gorham.

He doubles over, only to vomit once again.\n          His body, taxed almost to the point of complete physical\n          breakdown, gradually slows and levels itself. With his vomit-\n          smeared face pressed cheek-down onto the bottom of the\n          coffin, Paul stares into nothingness.\n\n<b>           59.\n<\/b>\n                         \n\n                         \n          After a beat, his eye catches a glimmer of light -- the blade\n          of the knife, reflecting off the beam of the flashlight.\n          Paul reaches for the knife. Lying on his back, still\n          suffering enormous mental strain, he places the cutting edge\n          of the blade against his neck. His jugular vein.\n          His hand shakes, his lips tremble.\n          The hand that holds the blade tightens its grip on the\n          handle. It, too, shakes.\n          Paul closes his eyes.\n          A small amount of blood begins to drip from the side of his\n          neck, where the blade of the knife rests, ready to open his\n          vein.\n\n                         \n          After a great deal of consideration, Paul throws the knife to\n          the foot of the coffin.\n          He can't do it.\n          The flashlight falls from Paul's chest. It turns off upon\n          landing on the floor of the coffin.\n          Paul sits in darkness. His breaths echo off the coffin\n          walls.\n          After a beat, he turns on the flashlight. It turns off after\n          less than two seconds. This time, however, he does not shake\n          it, nor does he hit it.\n          A moment later, we hear a click, followed by the sight of a\n          red light beam emitting from the flashlight. It holds\n          steady.\n\n                         \n          Paul shines it onto the names and phone numbers written on\n          the top of the coffin. He stops at \"MARK WHITE.\"\n          After a beat, he lowers the flashlight to his side.\n          He picks up the phone and dials Brenner. After one ring,\n          Brenner answers. He's clearly not pleased. Paul, however,\n          is surprisingly calm. Detached.

Suddenly, the\n          coffin begins to vibrate slightly, dropping sand granules\n          through the crack and onto the wood bottom, followed by the\n          faint sound of an explosion.\n          Within seconds, the explosions grow louder and more\n          proximate. The vibration becomes so intense that it\n          violently shakes Paul around the coffin.\n          The sound of jet plane engines are heard coming from above,\n          flying by as the massive explosions continue.\n          Sand seeps in through the crack between the top and sides of\n          the coffin as it shakes. Paul does his best to brace\n          himself, but the bombardment is far too powerful.\n\n                         \n          A large crack forms in the wooden cover to the coffin,\n          spanning almost its entire length. Sand immediately pours\n          through the concave shaped crack, seeping in onto Paul like\n          an hourglass.\n          Fearing that the top of the coffin may collapse under the\n          immense pressure from the sand above, Paul positions himself\n          underneath it and presses with all his might. He grunts and\n          screams loudly, using what little strength he has left to\n          keep the top from caving.\n          The shaking soon stops, though the steady flow of sand\n          continues.\n\n<b>           64.\n<\/b>\n                         \n\n                         \n          In efforts to prevent the sand from filling the coffin any\n          faster, Paul removes the button-down shirt from the hole and\n          stuffs into the area where it enters with the greatest\n          volume. He removes the balled-up cloth from the other hole\n          and does the same with it. Both offer very little help.\n          The flashlight falls to the floor.

He wonders how it may have affected\n          Jabir and, consequently, his own chances of survival. He\n          places his hand under the point from where the sand pours in\n          most, allowing it to collect on his palm and slip through his\n          fingers.\n          The flickering Zippo flame tells of the diminished amount of\n          oxygen.\n          Paul attempts to control his breathing, realizing full well\n          that there are not many more breaths he will be able to take.\n          He then calls Dan Brenner.

Click. It turns on.\n          Paul opens the phone and sets it to take video. He places it\n          flat onto the surface of the sand, which by this point is\n          already filling the coffin halfway. He then reaches for the\n          knife.\n\n<b>                          PAUL (CONT'D)\n<\/b>           Oh my God. Oh my God.\n          He places his hands against the side of the coffin, spreading\n          his fingers. He stares intently at his thumb.\n          With the extremely sharp knife in hand, Paul slowly lowers it\n          just above his thumb. He inhales and exhales deep breaths,\n          almost hyperventilating.\n\n<b>                          PAUL(CONT'D)\n<\/b>           Holy shit.\n          Paul then reaches into the sand and finds one of the expired\n          glow sticks. He shakes the sand off of it and places it\n          across his mouth, biting into it hard.\n          His heart races, his breaths are the deepest he's ever taken.\n          After placing the flashlight on the ground, to ensure that\n          the camera picks up the image, he presses the record button\n          on the cell phone.\n          Grinding his teeth into the glow stick and letting out a\n          primordial scream, Paul closes his eyes and chops down with\n          the knife.\n          We see, through the display screen of the phone, Paul sever\n          his thumb with a swift chop of the blade.\n\n<b>           81.\n<\/b>\n                         \n\n                         \n          A small spray of blood spatters onto his face as he screams\n          out in unfathomable pain.\n          He falls to his side, still screaming and writhing. He\n          reaches for his discarded outer-shirt, which is still stuffed\n          in the crack to help slow the influx of sand. Removing the\n          shirt from the crack instantly causes the sand to fall into\n          the coffin more rapidly.\n          Paul wraps the shirt around his hand. The blood quickly soaks\n          right through it.\n          He is fading fast. His blood loss is great. Shock sets in.\n          He musters up the strength to send the video to Jabir.\n          To secure his shirt over the wound, Paul removes his belt\n          from his waist and pulls it tight over his wrap.\n\n                         \n          Growing increasingly more pale, Paul teeters on the verge of\n          consciousness. Everything becomes blurry to him.\n          The phone falls from his hand. He shivers. His lips turn a\n          light shade of purple and his face ash white. Everything\n          becomes more and more blurry. He fights with every last\n          ounce of strength to remain conscious.\n          While laying against the side of the coffin, the phone\n          vibrates once again. To Paul, the vibration against the wood\n          seems so distant, so foreign. The vibration grows louder and\n          louder in his mind, sounding more and more like the sound of\n          rotating helicopter blades.\n          He then hears what sounds like VOICES, yelling from on top of\n          the coffin.\n\n<b>                          VOICE #1\n<\/b>           He's down here!\n\n<b>                          VOICE #2\n<\/b>           Get him out! Keep digging!\n\n<b>                          VOICE #3\n<\/b>           Paul, we're here!\n          The cacophony of voices form a mosaic of sound in Paul's\n          head, each overlapping the other in distant echoes. Shovels,\n          digging deep into the ground, are heard banging against the\n          top of the coffin.\n          The top of the coffin is torn open, sending a brilliant ray\n          of white light onto Paul. He stares into the light, crying,\n          eking out a tortured smile.\n\n<b>           82.\n<\/b>\n                         \n\n                         \n          Suddenly, Paul is back in the same predicament. The voices,\n          the shovels, the light -- it was all a hallucination, brought\n          upon by his loss of blood.\n          He's still alone. He's still in the coffin, which continues\n          to fill up with sand. He is too exhausted to display his\n          disappointment.\n          The phone continues to vibrate. It soon stops. Paul is in\n          too poor condition to show any concern.\n          After a beat, the phone begins vibrating once again. After\n          several rings, Paul languidly picks it up. He barely\n          recognizes the number through his extremely blurred vision.\n          He's so weak, he's barely able to formulate words. He spits\n          out stray particles of sand from his mouth.\n\n                         \n\n<b>                          PAUL\n<\/b>           Yeah?\n\n<b>                          DAN\n<\/b>           Paul, it's Brenner.\n          Paul doesn't have the strength to answer.\n\n<b>                          DAN (CONT'D)\n<\/b>           Paul?
