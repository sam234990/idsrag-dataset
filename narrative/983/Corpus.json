Amphitryon and his slave Sosia have been away at war and are returning to Thebes. Meanwhile, the god Jupiter is sleeping with Amphitryon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife Alcmena. Jupiter is in the guise of Amphitryon so that Alcmena is unaware that he is not her husband.\nMercury's job is to buy his father Jupiter some time by deceiving those who would interfere. He changes his appearance to look like the slave Sosia, and when the real Sosia arrives, he beats him up and sends him away from the house. Thoroughly confused by having been beat up by himself, Sosia returns to the ship to relay what happened to his master Amphitryon.\nThe following morning, Amphitryon sets off for the house, annoyed by his slave's foolish sounding story. Jupiter leaves only moments before Amphitryon arrives, and when Alcmena sees her real husband, she is confused as to why he has returned. Amphitryon doesn't appreciate this strange welcome after being gone for so many months, and confusion turns to anger and jealousy after learning that she has slept with a man who is not himself.\nAfter a long argument, Alcmena is ready to leave her untrusting husband but is stopped by Jupiter. He soon begins to set things right, and in a miraculous event, Alcmena gives birth to twin boys. One is the son of Amphitryon, the other is Hercules, the son of Jupiter. To quell Amphitryon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anger, he explains to him what he did, and Amphyitryon is then honored to have shared his wife with a god.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Amphitryo, Asinaria, Aulularia, Bacchides,\nCaptivi, by Plautus Titus Maccius\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

It may be that some general readers will be glad to have\neven so condensed an account of these matters as will be offered them.\n\nThe original of the _Amphitruo_ is not now thought to have been a work\nof the Middle Comedy but of the New Comedy, very possibly Philemon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n\u00ce\u009d\u00e1\u00bd\u00ba\u00ce\u00be \u00ce\u00bc\u00ce\u00b1\u00ce\u00ba\u00cf\u0081\u00e1\u00bd\u00b1. A clue to the Greek play\u00e2\u0080\u0099s date is found in the\ndescription of Amphitryon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battle with the Teloboians,[2] a battle\nfought after the manner of those of the Diadochi who came into\nprominence at the death of Alexander the Great. The date of the\nPlautine adaptation of this play, as in the case of the _Asinaria_,\n_Aulularia_, _Bacchides_,[3] and _Captivi_, is quite uncertain, beyond\nthe fact that it no doubt belongs, like almost all of his extant work,\nto the last two decades of his life, 204-184 B.C. The _Amphitruo_ is\none of the five[4] plays in the first two volumes whose scene is not\nlaid in Athens.\n\nThe \u00e1\u00bd\u0088\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00b1\u00ce\u00b3\u00e1\u00bd\u00b9\u00cf\u0082 of a certain Demophilus,[5] otherwise unknown to us, was\nthe onginal of the _Asinaria._ The assertion of Libanus that he is his\nmaster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Salus[6] is thought to be a fling at the honours decreed\ncertain of the Diadochi, who were called, while still alive, \u00ce\u00a3\u00cf\u0089\u00cf\u0084\u00e1\u00bf\u0086\u00cf\u0081\u00ce\u00b5\u00cf\u0082.\nThis possibility, together with the fact that the Pellaean[7] merchant\nand the Rhodian[8] Periphanes travel to Athens-- northern Greece and the\nAegaean therefore being pacified and Athens at peace with Macedon--would\nindicate that the \u00e1\u00bd\u0088\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00b1\u00ce\u00b3\u00e1\u00bd\u00b9\u00cf\u0082 was written while Demetrius Poliorcetes\ncontrolled Macedon, 294-288 B.C.\n\nVery slender evidence connects the _Aulularia_ with some unknown play\nof Menander\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in which a miser is represented \u00ce\u00b4\u00ce\u00b5\u00ce\u00b4\u00ce\u00b9\u00e1\u00bd\u00bc\u00cf\u0082 \u00ce\u00bc\u00e1\u00bd\u00b5 \u00cf\u0084\u00ce\u00b9 \u00cf\u0084\u00e1\u00bf\u00b6\u00ce\u00bd \u00e1\u00bc\u0094\u00ce\u00b9\u00ce\u00b4\u00ce\u00bf\u00ce\u00bd\n\u00e1\u00bd\u0081 \u00ce\u00ba\u00ce\u00b1\u00cf\u0080\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00bf\u00cf\u0082 \u00ce\u00bf\u00e1\u00bc\u00b4\u00cf\u0087\u00ce\u00bf\u00ce\u00b9\u00cf\u0084\u00ce\u00bf \u00cf\u0086\u00ce\u00b5\u00cf\u0081\u00cf\u0089\u00ce\u00bd. Euclio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s distress[9] at seeing any smoke\nescape from his house seems at least to suggest that Plautus may have\nborrowed the _Aulularia_ from Menander. The allusion to _praefectum\nmulierum_,[10] rather than _censorem_, would seem to show that in the\noriginal \u00ce\u00b3\u00cf\u0085\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00b1\u00ce\u00b9\u00ce\u00ba\u00ce\u00bf\u00ce\u00b9 \u00ce\u00bf\u00ce\u00bc\u00ce\u00bf\u00ce\u00bd had been written; this would prove the Greek\nplay to have been presented while Demetrius of Phalerum was in power\nat Athens (317-307 B.C.), where he introduced this detested office,\nwhich was done away with by 307 B.C.\n\nRitschl[11] has shown clearly enough that the original of the\n_Bacchides_ was Menander\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00ce\u0094\u00e1\u00bd\u00b6\u00cf\u0082 \u00e1\u00bc\u0090\u00ce\u00be\u00ce\u00b1\u00cf\u0080\u00ce\u00b1\u00cf\u0084\u00e1\u00bf\u00b6\u00ce\u00bd. The fact that Athens, Samos,\nand Ephesus are at peace, that the Aegaean is not swept by hostile\nfleets, that one can travel freely between Athens and Phoeis, together\nwith the allusion to Demetrius,[12] lead one to believe that the \u00ce\u0094\u00e1\u00bd\u00b6\u00cf\u0082\n\u00e1\u00bc\u0090\u00ce\u00be\u00ce\u00b1\u00cf\u0080\u00ce\u00b1\u00cf\u0084\u00e1\u00bf\u00b6\u00ce\u00bd was written either between the years 316-307 or 298-296 B.C.\n\nThe original of the _Captivi_ is quite unknown, while the war between\nthe Aetolians and Eleans gives the only clue to the date of this\noriginal. Hueffner[13] considers it probable that the war was that\nbetween Aristodemus and Alexander, and the Greek play was produced\nshortly after 314 B.C. Others[14] assume that the scene of the play\nwould not be Aetolia unless Aetolia had become an important state,\nand that the war was therefore one of the third century B.C.\n\n  [Footnote 1: See especially Hueffner, _De Plauti Comoediarum Exemplis\n  Atticis_, G\u00c3\u00b6ttingen, 1894; Legrand, _Daos_, Paris, 1910, English\n  translation by James Loeb under title _The New Greek Comedy_, William\n  Heinemann, 1916; Leo, _Plautinische Forschungen_, Berlin, 1912.]\n\n  [Footnote 2: _Amph._ 203 _seq._]\n\n  [Footnote 3: Produced later than the _Epidicus._ Cf. _Bacch._ 214.]\n\n  [Footnote 4: _Amphitruo_, Thebes, _Captivi_, Aetolia, _Cistellaria_,\n  Sicyon, _Curculio_, Epidaurus (the Caria first referred to in v. 67\n  was a Greek town, not the state in Asia Minor), _Menaechmi_,\n  Epidamnus.]\n\n  [Footnote 5: _Asin._ Prol. 10-11.]\n\n  [Footnote 6: _Asin._ 713.]\n\n  [Footnote 7: _Asin._ 334.]\n\n  [Footnote 8: _Asin._ 499.]\n\n  [Footnote 9: _Aulul._ 299, 301.]\n\n  [Footnote 10: _Aulul._ 504.]\n\n  [Footnote 11: Ritschl, _Parerga_, pp. 405 _seq._ Cf.

He was born\nabout 255 B.C. at Sarsina, in Umbria; it is said that he went to Rome\nat an early age, worked at a theatre, saved some money, lost it in a\nmercantile venture, returned to Rome penniless, got employment in a\nmill and wrote, during his leisure hours, three plays. These three\nplays were followed by many more than the twenty extant, most of them\nwritten, it would seem, in the latter half of his life, and all of\nthem adapted from the comedies of various Greek dramatists, chiefly of\nthe New Comedy.[15] Adaptations rather than translations they\ncertainly were. Apart from the many allusions in his comedies to\ncustoms and conditions distinctly Roman, there is evidence enough in\nPlautus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s language and style that he was not a close translator. Modern\ntranslators who have struggled vainly to reproduce faithfully in their\nown tongues, even in prose, the countless puns and quips, the incessant\nalliteration and assonance in the Latin lines, would be the last to\nadmit that Plautus, writing so much, writing in verse, and writing with\nsuch careless, jovial, exuberant ease, was nothing but a translator in\nthe narrow sense of the term.\n\nVery few of his extant comedies can be dated, so far as the year\nof their production in Rome is concerned, with any great degree of\ncertainty. _The Miles Gloriosus_ appeared about 206, the _Cistellaria_\nabout 202, _Stichus_ in 200, _Pseudolus_ in 191 B.C.; the _Truculentus_,\nlike _Pseudolus_, was composed when Plautus was an old man, not many\nyears before his death in 184 B.C.\n\nWelcome as a full autobiography of Plautus would be, in place of such\nscant and tasteless biographical morsels as we do have, only less\nwelcome, perhaps, would be his own stage directions for his plays,\nsupposing him to have written stage directions and to have written\nthem with something more than even modern fullness. We should learn\nhow he met the stage conventions and limitations of his day; how\nsuccessfully he could, by make-up and mannerism, bring on the boards\npalpably different persons in the Scapins and Bobadils and Doll\nTear-sheets that on the printed page often seem so confusingly similar,\nand most important, we should learn precisely what sort of dramatist he\nwas and wished to be.\n\nIf Plautus himself greatly cared or expected his restless,\nuncultivated, fun-seeking audience to care, about the construction\nof his plays, one must criticize him and rank him on a very different\nbasis than if his main, and often his sole, object was to amuse the\ngroundlings. If he often took himself and his art with hardly more\nseriousness than does the writer of the vaudeville skit or musical\ncomedy of to-day, if he often wished primarily to gain the immediate\nlaugh, then much of Langen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long list of the playwright\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dramatic\ndelinquencies is somewhat beside its intended point.\n\nAnd in large measure this--to hold his audience by any means--does\nseem to have been his ambition: if the joke mars the part, down with\nthe part; if the ludicrous scene interrupts the development of the\nplot, down with the plot. We have plenty of verbal evidence that the\ndramatist frequently chose to let his characters become caricatures;\nwe have some verbal evidence that their \u00e2\u0080\u009cstage business\u00e2\u0080\u009d was sometimes\nmade laughably extravagant; in many cases it is sufficiently obvious\nthat he expected his actors to indulge in grotesqueries, well or ill\ntimed, no matter, provided they brought guffaws. It is probable,\ntherefore, that in many other cases, where the tone and \u00e2\u0080\u009cstage business\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nare not as obvious, where an actor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high seriousness might elicit\ncatcalls, and burlesque certainly would elicit chuckles, Plautus\nwished his players to avoid the catcalls.\n\nThis is by no means the universal rule. In the writer of the _Captivi_,\nfor instance, we are dealing with a dramatist whose aims are different\nand higher. Though Lessing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s encomium of the play is one to which not\nall of us can assent, and though even the _Captivi_ shows some technical\nflaws, it is a work which must be rated according to the standards we\napply to a _Minna von Barnhelm_ rather than according to those applied\nto a _Pinafore_: here, certainly, we have comedy, not farce.\n\nBut whatever standards be applied to his plays their outstanding\ncharacters, their amusing situations, their vigour and comicality\nof dialogue remain. Euclio and Pyrgopolynices, the straits of the\nbrothers Menaechmus and the postponement of Argyrippus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desires, the\nverbal encounter of Tranio and Grumio, of Trachalio and the fishermen--\ncharacters, situations, and dialogues such as these should survive\nbecause of their own excellence, not because of modern imitations and\nparallels such as Harpagon and Parolles, the misadventures of the\nbrothers Antipholus and Juliet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficulties with her nurse, the\nremarks of Petruchio to the tailor, of Touchstone to William.\n\nThough his best drawn characters can and should stand by themselves,\nit is interesting to note how many favourite personages in the modern\ndrama and in modern fiction Plautus at least prefigures. Long though\nthe list is, it does not contain a large proportion of thoroughly\nrespectable names: Plautus rarely introduces us to people, male or\nfemale, whom we should care to have long in the same house with us.\nA real lady seldom appears in these comedies, and--to approach a\nparadox--when she does she usually comes perilously close to being no\nlady; the same is usually true of the real gentleman. The generalization\nin the Epilogue of _The Captives_ may well be made particular: \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlautus\nfinds few plays such as this which make good men better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yet there is\nlittle in his plays which makes men--to say nothing of good men--worse.\nA bluff Shakespearean coarseness of thought and expression there often\nis, together with a number of atrocious characters and scenes and\nsituations. But compared with the worst of a Congreve or a Wycherley,\ncompared with the worst of our own contemporary plays and musical\ncomedies, the worst of Plautus, now because of its being too revolting,\nnow because of its being too laughable, is innocuous. His moral land\nis one of black and white, mostly black, without many of those really\ndangerous half-lights and shadows in which too many of our present day\nplaywrights virtuously invite us to skulk and peer and speculate.\n\nComparatively harmless though they are, the translator has felt obliged\nto dilute certain phrases and lines.\n\nThe text accompanying his version is that of Leo, published by\nWeidmann, 1895-96. In the few cases where he has departed from this\ntext brief critical notes are given; a few changes in punctuation have\nbeen accepted without comment. In view of the wish of the Editors of\nthe Library that the text pages be printed without unnecessary\ndefacements, it has seemed best to omit the lines that Leo brackets as\nun-Plautine[16]: attention is called to the omission in each case and\nthe omitted lines are given in the note; the numbering, of course, is\nkept unchanged. Leo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daggers and asterisks indicating corruption and\nlacunae are omitted, again with brief notes in each case.\n\nThe translator gladly acknowledges his indebtedness to several of the\nEnglish editors of the plays, notably to Lindsay, and to two or three\nEnglish translators, for a number of phrases much more happily turned\nby them than by himself: the difficulty of rendering verse into prose--\nif one is to remain as close as may be to the spirit and letter of the\nverse, and at the same time not disregard entirely the contributions\nmade by the metre to gaiety and gravity of tone--is sufficient to make\nhim wish to mitigate his failure by whatever means. He is also much\nindebted to Professors Charles Knapp, K.C.M. Sills, and F.E. Woodruff\nfor many valuable suggestions.\n\n  Brunswick, Me.,\n\n    September, 1913.\n\n  [Footnote 15: The _Asinaria_ was adapted from the \u00e1\u00bd\u0088\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00b1\u00ce\u00b3\u00e1\u00bd\u00b8\u00cf\u0082 of\n  Demophilus; the _Casina_ from the \u00ce\u009a\u00ce\u00bb\u00ce\u00b7\u00cf\u0081\u00ce\u00bf\u00e1\u00bd\u00bb\u00ce\u00bc\u00ce\u00b5\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00bf\u00ce\u00b9, the _Rudens_ from\n  an unknown play, perhaps the \u00ce\u00a0\u00e1\u00bd\u00b5\u00cf\u0081\u00ce\u00b1, of Diphilus; the _Stichus_, in\n  part, from the \u00e1\u00bc\u0088\u00ce\u00b4\u00ce\u00b5\u00ce\u00bb\u00cf\u0086\u00ce\u00bf\u00e1\u00bd\u00b7 \u00e1\u00bd\u00b1 of Menander.

Mercury takes the form of an absent\n      slave, Sosia, and Alcmena is deceived by the two impostors.\n      After the real Amphitryon and Sosia return they both are\n      deluded in extraordinary fashion. This leads to an\n      altercation and quarrel between wife and husband, until\n      there comes from the heavens, with a peal of thunder,\n      the voice of Jupiter, who owns that he has been the\n      guilty lover.\n\n\nARGVMENTVM II\n\n    ARGUMENT OF THE PLAY (II)\n\n  *A*more captus Alcumenas Iuppiter\n  *M*utavit sese in formam eius coniugis,\n  *P*ro patria Amphitruo dum decernit cum hostibus.\n  *H*abitu Mercurius ei subservit Sosiae.\n  *I*s advenientis servum ac dominum frustra habet.\n  *T*urbas uxori ciet Amphitruo, atque invicem\n  *R*aptant pro moechis.

Mercury,\n      in the guise of Sosia, seconds his father and dupes both\n      servant and master on their return. Amphitryon storms at his\n      wife: charges of adultery, too, are bandied back and forth\n      between him and Jupiter. Blepharo is appointed arbiter, but\n      is unable to decide which is the real Amphitryon. They\n      learn the whole truth at last, and Alcmena gives birth\n      to twin sons.\n\n\n\n\nPERSONAE\n\n    DRAMATIS PERSONAE\n\n  MERCVRIVS DEUS\n  SOSIA SERVUS\n  IVPPITER DEUS\n  ALCVMENA MATRONA\n  AMPHITRVO DUX\n  BLEPHARO GUBERNATOR\n  BROMIA ANCILLA\n\n      MERCURY, _a god._\n      SOSIA, _slave of Amphitryon._\n      JUPITER, _a god._\n      ALCMENA, _wife of Amphitryon._\n      AMPHITRYON, _commander-in-chief of the Theban army._\n      BLEPHARO, _a pilot._\n      BROMIA, _maid to Alcmena._\n\n\n\n\n_Scaena Thebis._\n\n    _Scene:--Thebes.

Jupiter bade me come: my\n      name is Mercury (_pauses, evidently hoping he has made an\n      impression_). My father has sent me here to you to make a\n      plea, yea, albeit he knew that whatever was told you in way\n      of command you would do, inasmuch as he realized that you\n      revere and dread him as men should Jupiter.\n\n  verum profecto hoc petere me precario\n  a vobis iussit, leniter, dictis bonis.\n  etenim ille, cuius huc iussu venio, Iuppiter\n  non minus quam vostrum quivis formidat malum:\n  humana matre natus, humano patre,\n  mirari non est aequom, sibi si praetimet;\n\n      But the fact remains that he has bidden me make this\n      request in suppliant wise, with gentle, kindly words.\n      (_confidentially_) For you see, that Jupiter that \u00e2\u0080\u009cbade me\n      come here\u00e2\u0080\u009d is just like any one of you in his horror of\n      (_rubbing his shoulders reflectively_) trouble[A]: his\n      mother being human, also his father, it should not seem\n      strange if he does feel apprehensive regarding himself.\n\n        [Footnote A: Actors might be whipped on occasion.]\n\n  atque ego quoque etiam, qui Iovis sum filius,                     30\n  contagione mei patris metuo malum.\n  propterea pace advenio et pacem ad vos affero[5]:\n  iustam rem et facilem esse oratam a vobis volo,\n  nam iusta ab iustis iustus sum orator datus.\n\n      Yes, and the same is true of me, the son of Jupiter: once my\n      father has some trouble I am afraid I shall catch it, too.\n      (_rather pompously again_) Wherefore I come in peace and\n      peace do I bring to you. It is a just and trifling request I\n      wish you to grant: for I am sent as a just pleader pleading\n      with the just for what is just.\n\n  nam iniusta ab iustis impetrari non decet,\n  iusta autem ab iniustis petere insipientia est;\n  quippe illi iniqui ius ignorant neque tenent.\n  nunc iam huc animum omnes quae loquar advortite.\n  debetis velle quae velimus: meruimus\n  et ego et pater de vobis et re publica;                           40\n\n      It would be unfitting, of course, for unjust favours to be\n      obtained from the just, while looking for just treatment\n      from the unjust is folly; for unfair folk of that sort\n      neither know nor keep justice. Now then, pay attention all\n      of you to what I am about to say. Our wishes should be\n      yours: we deserve it of you, my father and I, of you and\n      of your state.\n\n  nam quid ego memorem,--ut alios in tragoediis\n  vidi, Neptunum Virtutem Victoriam\n  Martem Bellonam, commemorare quae bona\n  vobis fecissent,--quis bene factis meus pater,\n  deorum regnator[6] architectust[7] omnibus?\n\n      Ah well, why should I--after the fashion of other gods,\n      Neptune, Virtue, Victory, Mars, Bellona, whom I have seen\n      in the tragedies recounting their goodness to you--\n      rehearse the benefits that my father, ruler of the gods,\n      hath builded up for all men?\n\n  sed mos numquam illi fuit patri meo,[8]\n  ut exprobraret quod bonis faceret boni;\n  gratum arbitratur esse id a vobis sibi\n  meritoque vobis bona se facere quae facit.\n\n      It never was a habit of that sire of mine to twit good\n      people with the good he did them; he considers you\n      grateful to him for it and worthy of the good things he\n      does for you.\n\n  Nunc quam rem oratum huc veni primum proloquar,                   50\n  post argumentum huius eloquar tragoediae.\n  quid? contraxistis frontem, quia tragoediam\n  dixi futuram hanc? deus sum, commutavero.\n\n      Now first as to the favour I have come to ask, and then you\n      shall hear the argument of our tragedy. What? Frowning\n      because I said this was to be a tragedy? I am a god: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\n      transform it.\n\n  eandem hanc, si voltis, faciam ex tragoedia\n  comoedia ut sit omnibus isdem vorsibus.\n  utrum sit an non voltis? sed ego stultior,\n  quasi nesciam vos velle, qui divos siem.\n\n      I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll convert this same play from tragedy to comedy, if\n      you like, and never change a line. Do you wish me to do\n      it, or not? But there! how stupid of me! As if I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\n      know that you do wish it, when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a deity.\n\n  teneo quid animi vostri super hac re siet:\n  faciam ut commixta sit: sit tragicomoedia.\n  nam me perpetuo facere ut sit comoedia,                           60\n  reges quo veniant et di, non par arbitror.\n  quid igitur? quoniam his servos quoque partes habet,\n  faciam sit, proinde ut dixi, tragicomoedia.\n\n      I understand your feelings in the matter perfectly. I shall\n      mix things up: let it be tragi-comedy. Of course it would\n      never do for me to make it comedy out and out, with kings\n      and gods on the boards. How about it, then? Well, in view of\n      the fact that there is a slave part in it, I shall do just\n      as I said and make it tragi-comedy.\n\n  nunc hoc me orare a vobis iussit Iuppiter,\n  ut conquaestores singula in subsellia\n  eant per totam caveam spectatoribus,\n  si cui favitores delegates viderint,\n  ut is in cavea pignus capiantur togae;\n\n      Now here is the favour Jove bade me ask of you: (_with\n      great solemnity_) let inspectors go from seat to seat\n      throughout the house, and should they discover claqueurs\n      planted for the benefit of any party, let them take as\n      security from all such in the house--their togas.\n\n  sive qui ambissint palmam histrionibus,\n  sive cuiquam artifici, si per scriptas litteras                   70\n  sive qui ipse ambissit seu per internuntium,\n  sive adeo aediles perfidiose cui duint,\n  sirempse legem iussit esse Iuppiter,\n  quasi magistratum sibi alterive ambiverit.\n\n      Or if there be those who have solicited the palm for\n      actors, or for any artist--whether by letter, or by personal\n      solicitation, or through an intermediary--or further, if the\n      aediles do bestow the said palm upon anyone unfairly, Jove\n      doth decree that the selfsame law obtain as should the said\n      party solicit guiltily, for himself or for another, public\n      office.\n\n  virtute dixit vos victores vivere,\n  non ambitione neque perfidia: qui minus\n  eadem histrioni sit lex quae summo viro?\n  virtute ambire oportet, non favitoribus.\n  sat habet favitorum semper qui recte facit,\n  si illis fides est quibus est ea res in manu.                     80\n\n      \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis worth has won your wars for you, saith he, not\n      solicitation or unfairness: why should not the same law hold\n      for player as for noblest patriot? Worth, not hired support,\n      should solicit victory. He who plays his part aright ever\n      has support enough, if it so be that honour dwells in those\n      whose concern it is to judge his acts.\n\n  hoc quoque etiam mihi pater in mandatis dedit,\n  ut conquaestores fierent histrionibus:\n  qui sibi mandasset delegati ut plauderent\n  quive quo placeret alter fecisset minus,\n  eius ornamenta et corium uti conciderent.\n\n      This injunction, too, did Jove lay upon me: that\n      inspectors should be appointed for the actors, to the end\n      that whosoever has enjoined claqueurs to clap himself, or\n      whosoever has endeavoured to compass the failure of another,\n      may have his player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s costume cut to shreds, also his hide.\n\n  mirari nolim vos, quapropter Iuppiter\n  nunc histriones curet; ne miremini:\n  ipse hanc acturust Iuppiter comoediam.\n  quid? admirati estis? quasi vero novom\n  nunc proferatur, Iovem facere histrioniam;                        90\n\n      I would not have you wonder why Jove is now regardful\n      of actors; do not so: he himself, Jove, will take part in\n      this comedy. What? Surprised? As if it were actually a new\n      departure, this, Jove\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turning actor!\n\n  etiam, histriones anno cum in proscaemo hic\n  Iovem invocarunt, venit, auxilio is fuit[9]                      (92)\n  hanc fabulam, inquam, hic Iuppiter hodie ipse aget,              (94)\n  et ego una cum illo. nunc vos animum advortite,\n  dum huius argumentum eloquar comoediae.\n\n      Why, just last year when the actors on this very stage\n      called upon Jupiter, he came,[B] and helped them out.\n      This play, then, Jove himself will act in to-day, and I\n      along with him. Now give me your attention while I unfold\n      the argument of our comedy.\n\n        [Footnote B: An allusion to some play in which Jupiter\n        appeared in time to save some situation.]\n\n  Haec urbs est Thebae. in illisce habitat aedibus\n  Amphitruo, natus Argis ex Argo patre,\n  quicum Alcumena est nupta, Electri filia.\n  is nunc Amphitruo praefectust legionibus,                        100\n  nam cum Telobois bellum est Thebano poplo.\n\n      This city here is Thebes. In that house there (_pointing_)\n      dwells Amphitryon, born in Argos, of an Argive father: and\n      his wife is Alcmena, Electrus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter. At present this\n      Amphitryon is at the head of the Theban army, the Thebans\n      being at war with the Teloboians.\n\n  is prius quam hinc abut ipsemet in exercitum,\n  gravidam Alcumenam uxorem fecit suam.\n  nam ego vos novisse credo iam ut sit pater meus,\n  quam liber harum rerum multarum siet\n  quantusque amator sit quod complacitum est semel.\n\n      Before he himself left to join his troops, his wife,\n      Alcmena, was with child by him. (_apologetically_) Now I\n      think you know already what my father is like--how free he\n      is apt to be in a good many cases of this sort and what an\n      impetuous lover he is, once his fancy is taken.\n\n  is amare occepit Alcumenam clam virum\n  usuramque eius corporis cepit sibi,\n  et gravidam fecit is eam compressu suo.\n  nunc de Alcumena ut rem teneatis rectius,                        110\n  utrimque est gravida, et ex viro et ex summo Iove.\n\n      Well, Alcmena caught his fancy, without her husband knowing\n      it, and he enjoyed her and got her with child. So now\n      Alcmena, that you may see it quite clearly, is with child\n      by both of them, by her husband and by almighty Jove.\n\n  et meus pater nunc intus hic cum illa cubat,\n  et haec ob eam rem nox est facta longior,\n  dum cum illa quacum volt voluptatem capit;\n  sed ita adsimulavit se, quasi Amphitruo siet.\n\n      And my father is there inside this very moment with her in\n      his arms, and it is on this account that the present night\n      has been prolonged while he enjoys the society of his\n      heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s delight. All this in the guise of Amphitryon, you\n      understand.\n\n  Nunc ne hunc ornatum vos meum admiremini,\n  quod ego huc processi sic cum servili schema:\n  veterem atque antiquam rem novam ad vos proferam,\n  propterea ornatus in novom incessi modum.\n\n      Now don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be surprised at this get-up of mine and because I\n      appear here in the character of a slave as I do: I am going\n      to submit to you a new version of a worn and ancient tale,\n      hence my appearance in a new get-up.\n\n  nam meus pater intus nunc est eccum Iuppiter;                    120\n  in Amphitruonis vertit sese imaginem\n  omnesque eum esse censent servi qui vident:\n  ita versipellem se facit quando lubet.\n\n      The point is, my father Jupiter is now inside there, mark\n      you. He has turned himself into the very image of Amphitryon,\n      and all the servants that see him believe that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s who he is.\n      See how he can change his skin when he likes!\n\n  ego servi sumpsi Sosiae mi imaginem,\n  qui cum Amphitruone abiit hinc in exercitum,\n  ut praeservire amanti meo possem patri\n  atque ut ne, qui essem, familiares quaererent,\n  versari crebro hic cum viderent me domi;\n  nunc, cum esse credent servom et conservom suom,\n  haud quisquam quaeret qui siem aut quid venerim.                 130\n\n      And as for me, I have assumed the form of Amphitryon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slave\n      Sosia, who went away to the army with him, my idea being to\n      subserve my amorous sire and not have the domestics ask who\n      I am when they see me busy about the house here continually.\n      As it is, when they think I am a servant and one of their\n      own number, not a soul will ask me who I am or what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\n      come for.\n\n  Pater nunc intus suo animo morem gerit:\n  cubat complexus cuius cupiens maxime est;\n  quae illi ad legionem facta sunt memorat pater\n  meus Alcumenae: illa illum censet virum\n  suom esse, quae cum moecho est. ibi nunc meus pater\n  memorat, legiones hostium ut fugaverit,\n  quo pacto sit donis donatus plurimis.\n\n      So now my father is inside indulging his heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desire as\n      he lies there with his arms around the lady-love he\n      particularly dotes on. He is telling Alcmena what happened\n      during the campaign: and she all the time thinking him her\n      husband when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not.

(_lays lantern down and\n      addresses supposed Alcmena importantly_) First and foremost,\n      when we reached there, as soon as we had touched land,\n      straightway Amphitryon picks out the most illustrous of his\n      captains. These he sends forth as legates and bids convey\n      his terms to the Teloboians, to wit: should they wish,\n      without contention and without strife, to deliver up pillage\n      and pillagers and restore whatsoever they had carried off,\n      he himself would lead his army home forthwith and the\n      Argives would leave their land and grant them peace and\n      quietude; but were they otherwise disposed, and disinclined\n      to yield what he sought, he would thereupon with all the\n      force at his command make onslaught on their city.\n\n  Haec ubi Telobois ordine iterarunt quos praefecerat\n  Amphitruo, magnanimi viri freti virtute et viribus\n  superbe nimis ferociter legates nostros increpant,\n  respondent bello se et suos tutari posse, proinde uti\n  propere irent, de suis finibus exercitus deducerent.\n  haec ubi legati pertulere, Amphitruo castris ilico\n  producit omnem exercitum. Teloboae contra ex oppido\n  legiones educunt suas nimis pulcris armis praeditas.\n\n      When Amphitryon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ambassadors had duly made this\n      proclamation to the Teloboians, they, doughty warriors,\n      confiding in their courage and glorying in their strength,\n      made right rough and haughty answer to our embassy, saying\n      that they could defend themselves and theirs by force of\n      arms, and that accordingly they should depart at once\n      and lead their troops out from the Teloboian borders. On\n      receiving this report from his legates, Amphitryon at once\n      led forth his whole army from camp. And from the city, too,\n      the Teloboians led out their legions in goodly panoply.\n\n  postquam utrimque exitum est maxima copia,\n  dispertiti viri, dispertiti ordines,                             220\n  nos nostras more nostro et modo instruximus\n  legiones, item hostes contra legiones suas instruont.\n\n      After both sides had marched out in full force, troops\n      arrayed, and ranks arrayed, we drew up our legions according\n      to our usual method and manner: our foemen likewise draw up\n      their legions facing ours.\n\n  deinde utrique imperatores in medium exeunt,\n  extra turbam ordinum colloquontur simul.\n  convenit, victi utri sint eo proelio,\n  urbem agrum aras focos seque uti dederent.\n\n      Then forward into the centre of the field stride the\n      leaders of both hosts, and there out beyond the serried\n      lines they hold colloquy. This pact was made, that they\n      who were conquered in this battle should surrender city\n      and land, shrines, homes, and persons.\n\n  postquam id actum est, tubae contra utrimque occanunt,\n  consonat terra, clamorem utrimque efferunt.\n  imperator utrimque, hinc et illinc, Iovi\n  vota suscipere, utrimque hortari exercitum.                      230\n\n      This done, the trumpets blared on either side; earth echoes;\n      on either side the battle cry is raised. The generals on\n      either side, both here and there, offer their vows to Jove,\n      and on either side cheer their warriors.\n\n  tum pro se quisque id quod quisque potest et valet\n  edit, ferro ferit, tela frangunt, boat\n  caelum fremitu virum, ex spiritu atque anhelitu\n  nebula constat, cadunt volnerum vi viri.\n\n      Then each man lays about him with his every ounce of\n      strength and strikes home with his blade: lances shiver:\n      the welkin rings with the roar of heroes: up from their\n      gasping, panting breath a cloud arises: men drop beneath\n      the weight of wounds.\n\n  Denique, ut voluimus, nostra superat manus:\n  hostes crebri cadunt, nostri contra ingruont vi[11] feroces.\n  sed[12] fugam in se tamen nemo convortitur\n  nec recedit loco quin statim rem gerat;\n  animam omittunt prius quam loco demigrent:                       240\n  quisque ut steterat iacet optinetque ordinem.\n\n      At last, as we wished, our host prevails: the foemen fall in\n      heaps: on and on we press, fired by our might. Yet for all\n      that, none turns in flight nor yields an inch, but stands\n      his ground and hews away. They lose their lives sooner than\n      quit their post. As each had stood, so he lies, and keeps\n      the line unbroken.\n\n  hoc ubi Amphitruo erus conspicatust,\n  ilico equites iubet dextera inducere.\n  equites parent citi: ab dextera maximo\n  cum clamore involant impetu alacri,\n  foedant et proterunt hostium copias\n  iure iniustas.\n\n      When my lord Amphitryon noted this, he straightway ordered\n      that the cavalry on our right be led to the charge. Swift\n      they obey, and with terrific yells swooping down from the\n      right in mad career they mangle and trample underfoot the\n      forces of our foes and right our wrongs. (_wipes his brow\n      and meditates_)\n\n_Mer._\n\n  Numquam etiam quicquam adhuc verborum est prolocutus perperam:\n  namque ego fui illi in re praesenti et meus, cum pugnatum est, pater.\n\n      (_aside_) Not a single, solitary word of fiction has he\n      uttered yet: for I was there myself while the battle was\n      actually going on, and my father too.\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Perduelles penetrant se in fugam; ibi nostris animus additust:    250\n  vortentibus Telobois telis complebantur corpora,\n  ipsusque Amphitruo regem Pterelam sua obtruncavit manu.\n  haec illic est pugnata pugna usque a mani ad vesperum--\n  hoc adeo hoc commemini magis, quia illo die inpransus fui--\n  sed proelium id tandem diremit nox interventu suo.\n\n      (_gathering himself together_) Their warriors take to\n      flight; at this new courage animates our men. When the\n      Teloboians turn their backs we stick them full of spears,\n      and Amphitryon himself cut down King Pterelas with his own\n      hand. This fight was fought out all through the day there\n      from morn till eve. (_reflectively_) I remember this\n      point more distinctly because that noon I went without my\n      lunch. But darkness at last intervened and terminated the\n      engagement.\n\n  postridie in castra ex urbe ad nos veniunt flentes principes:\n  velatis manibus orant ignoscamus peccatum suom,\n  deduntque se, divina humanaque omnia, urbem et liberos\n  indicionem atque in arbitratum cuncti Thebano poplo.\n  post ob virtutem ero Amphitruoni patera donata aurea est,        260\n  qui Pterela potitare solitus est rex. haec sic dicam erae\n  nunc pergam eri imperium exequi et me domum capessere.\n\n      The following day their foremost men come tearfully from the\n      city to our camp, their hands veiled in suppliant wise, and\n      entreat us to pardon their transgression: and one and all\n      they surrender their persons, their entire possessions\n      sacred and profane, their city and their children to the\n      Theban people to have and to hold as they deem fit. Then,\n      for his valour, my lord Amphitryon was presented with a\n      golden bowl from which King Pterelas was wont to drink.\n      (_heaves deep sigh of relief_) This is how I will tell it\n      to the mistress. Now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go finish up the job for master\n      and take myself home.

But Amphitryon,\n      though, as I told you some time since, will be informed of\n      the whole affair. But what of that?

But did you see\n      my wife?\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Quin intro ire in aedis numquam licitum est.\n\n      Why, sir, never a foot was I allowed to put in the house.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Quis te prohibuit?\n\n      Who hindered you?\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Sosia ille, quem iam dudum dico, is qui me contudit.\n\n      That Sosia I have been telling of all along, the one that\n      smashed me up.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Quis istic Sosia est?\n\n      Who is that Sosia?\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Ego, inquam. quotiens dicendum est tibi?\n\n      I am, I say. How many times do you need to be told?\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Sed quid ais? num obdormivisti dudum?\n\n      (_reflecting_) But look here, you were not asleep a while\n      ago, were you?\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Nusquam gentium.                                                 620\n\n      Not a bit of it, sir.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Ibi forte istum si vidisses quendam in somnis Sosiam--\n\n      Then perhaps, if you had seen that, well, that Sosia of\n      yours in your dreams--\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Non soleo ego somniculose eri imperia persequi.\n  vigilans vidi, vigilans nunc te video, vigilans fabulor,\n  vigilantem ille me iam dudum vigilans pugnis contudit.\n\n      I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do my master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orders drowsily. Wide awake I was,\n      eyes open; I am wide awake with \u00e2\u0080\u0099em open on you now; I am\n      wide awake telling my story; and I was wide awake when he\n      hammered me a while back, yes, and (_ruefully_) he was\n      wide awake.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Quis homo?\n\n      Who?\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Sosia, inquam, ego ille. quaeso, nonne intellegis?\n\n      Sosia, I tell you, that me. Pray do not you understand?\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Qui, malum, intellegere quisquam potis est? ita nugas blatis.\n\n      How the devil can any man understand? Such stuff and\n      nonsense!\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Verum actutum nosces, quom illum nosces servom Sosiam.\n\n      (_significantly_) Well, you will know what I mean very\n      soon, once you know that servant Sosia.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Sequere hac igitur me,\n        nam mi istuc primum exquisito est opus.[18]               (628)\n\n      (_going toward house_) Come then, this way. This matter\n      needs my investigation first of all. (_stops to examine\n      house from distance and talks with Sosia_)\n\n\nII. 2.\n\n    Scene 2.\n\n    ENTER _Alcmena_ INTO DOORWAY.\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Satin parva res est voluptatum in vita atque in aetate agunda    633\n  praequam quod molestum est? ita cuique comparatum est in\n                  aetate hominum;\n  ita divis est placitum, voluptatem ut maeror comes consequatur:\n  quin incommodi plus malique ilico adsit, boni si optigit quid.\n\n      Oh, are not the pleasures in life, in this daily round,\n      trifling compared with the pains! It is our common\n      human lot, it is heaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s will, for sorrow to come\n      following after joy: yes, yes, and to have a larger share of\n      trouble and distress the moment something nice has happened.\n\n  nam ego id nunc experior domo atque ipsa de me scio, cui voluptas\n  parumper datast, dum viri mei mihi potestas videndi fuit\n  noctem unam modo; atque is repente abiit a me hinc ante lucem.\n  sola hic mihi nunc videor, quia ille hinc abest quem ego amo\n                  praeter omnes.                                   640\n  plus aegri ex abitu viri, quam ex adventu voluptatis cepi.\n\n      Ah, I am learning this now at first hand, learning it of my\n      own experience--a few short hours of happiness, allowed to\n      see my husband for just one night; and then away he goes all\n      of a sudden before daylight! It does seem so lonely here\n      now, when the one I love best is gone. I have felt more\n      unhappy at his going than happy at his coming.\n\n  sed hoc me beat\n  saltem, quom perduellis vicit et domum laudis compos revenit:\n  id solacio est.\n  absit, dum modo laude parta\n  domum recipiat se; feram et perferam usque\n  abitum eius animo forti atque offirmato, id modo si mercedis\n  datur mi, ut meus victor vir belli clueat.\n\n      But there is thus much to be thankful for, at least: he has\n      been victorious and come home a hero--that is one comfort.\n      He may leave me, if only he returns to me with a glorious\n      name: I will bear his going, yes, and keep on bearing it\n      to the end firmly and unflinchingly, only let me have the\n      reward of hearing my husband hailed conqueror.\n\n  satis mi esse ducam.\n  virtus praemium est optimum;\n  virtus omnibus rebus anteit profecto:\n  libertas salus vita res et parentes, patria et prognati          650\n  tutantur, servantur:\n  virtus omnia in sese habet, omnia adsunt\n  bona quem penest virtus\n\n      That is enough for me! Courage is the very best gift of all;\n      courage stands before everything, it does, it does! It is\n      what maintains and preserves our liberty, safety, life, and\n      our homes and parents, our country and children. Courage\n      comprises all things: a man with courage has every blessing.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Edepol me uxori exoptatum credo adventurum domum,\n  quae me amat, quam contra amo, praesertim re gesta bene,\n  victis hostibus. quos nemo posse superari ratust,\n  eos auspicio meo atque ductu primo coetu vicimus\n  certe enim med illi expectatum optato venturum scio.\n\n      By Jove, my wife will certainly be delighted to have me\n      home--loving each other as we do! Especially now that we\n      have been successful, and the enemy, that every one thought\n      invincible, beaten, beaten at the first set-to under my\n      auspices and leadership. Ah yes, my arrival will\n      surely be a very welcome event to her.\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Quid? me non rere expectatum amicae venturum meae?\n\n      What? And don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think mine is going to be welcome to my\n      lady friend?\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Meus vir hic quidem est.\n\n      (_seeing them_) Why, here is my husband!\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Sequere hac tu me.\n\n      (_to Sosia_) Here you, this way! (_goes on toward house_)\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Nam quid ille revortitur,                                        660\n  qui dudum properare se aibat? an ille me temptat sciens\n  atque id se volt experiri, suom abitum ut desiderem?\n  ecastor med haud invita se domum recipit suam.\n\n      (_aside_) What in the world is he back for so soon after\n      saying he must hurry off!

Let me get hold of a\n      bucket, and by gad, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ever trust my sacred oath again,\n      if I do not drain that well of its last breath, once I\n      begin.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Sequere hac me modo, alium ego isti rei allegabo, ne time.\n\n  Come now, this way with me. (_moves toward house again_)\n      I will appoint some one else to that office, never fear.\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Magis nunc me meum officium facere, si huic eam advorsum, arbitror.\n\n      (_aside_) I suppose it would be more duteous of me to go to\n      meet him.

Why are you making fun of me with all these\n      greetings and salutations, as if you had not seen me a\n      little while ago and were just this moment back from the\n      war?\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Immo equidem te nisi nunc hodie nusquam vidi gentium.

But why are you returning\n      so quickly? Were you delayed by bad omens, or is it the\n      weather detains you, that you have not gone away to the\n      army, as you spoke of doing a little while ago?\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Dudum? quam dudum istuc factum est?\n\n      A little while ago? How little a while ago was that?\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Temptas. iam dudum, modo.\n\n      Tease! Oh, quite a little while ago--just now.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Qui istuc potis est fieri, quaeso, ut dicis: iam dudum, modo?\n\n      For heaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, how can those statements agree--\u00e2\u0080\u009cquite a\n      little while ago\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust now\u00e2\u0080\u009d?\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Quid enim censes? te ut deludam contra lusorem meum,\n  qui nunc primum te advenisse dicas, modo qui hinc abieris.\n\n      Well, how do you suppose?

But I say, ma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am, this morning after you woke\n      up you ought to have taken some salted cakes, or incense,\n      and prayed to Jove--he has charge of prodigies.\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Vae capiti tuo.\n\n      Oh confound you, sir!\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Tua istuc refert--si curaveris.\n\n      (_innocently_) That would do you good, ma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am--if you\n      would see to it.\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Iterum iam hic in me inclementer dicit, atque id sine malo.\n\n      There he is, rude to me again, and not suffering for it!\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Tace tu. tu dic: egone abs te abii hinc hodie cum diluculo?\n\n      (_to Sosia_) Keep still, you! (_to Alcmena_) And you--I left\n      you this morning at daybreak, did I?\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Quis igitur nisi vos narravit mi, illi ut fuerit proelium?\n\n      Why, who else but you two told me how the battle there went?\n\n_Amph._\n\n  An etiam id tu scis?\n\n      You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean to say you know about that?\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Quippe qui ex te audivi, ut urbem maximam\n  expugnavisses regemque Pterelam tute occideris.\n\n      Naturally, since I heard from your own lips how you took\n      that great city and killed King Pterelas yourself.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Egone istuc dixi?\n\n      I told you that, I?\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Tute istic, etiam adstante hoc Sosia.\n\n      Yes, you yourself,--with Sosia here standing by, too.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Audivistin tu me narrare haec hodie?\n\n      (_to Sosia_) Have you ever heard me say a word of this?\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Ubi ego audiverim?\n\n      Heard you? Where?\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Hanc roga.\n\n      (_sullenly_) Ask her.\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Me quidem praesente numquam factum est, quod sciam.\n\n      You never did so far as I know, leastways with me at hand.\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Mirum quin te adversus dicat.\n\n      (_ironically_) It is strange he declines to contradict his\n      own master.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Sosia, age me huc aspice.                                        750\n\n      Sosia, here! Look me in the eye.\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Specto.\n\n      (_obeying_) Very good, sir.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Vera volo loqui te, nolo adsentari mihi.\n  audivistin tu hodie me illi dicere ea quae illa autumat?\n\n      What I want from you is the truth, no obsequiousness. Did\n      you ever hear me utter a syllable of what she says?\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Quaeso edepol, num tu quoque etiam insanis, quom id me interrogas,\n  qui ipsus equidem nunc primum istanc tecum conspicio simul?\n\n      Well, upon my word, I should like to ask if you are not\n      crazy yourself, asking me a question like that--and I just\n      this minute setting eyes on her for the first time along\n      with you?\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Quid nunc, mulier? audin illum?\n\n      What now, madam? Do you hear him?\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Ego vero, ac falsum dicere.\n\n      To be sure I do--telling lies.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Neque tu illi neque mihi viro ipsi credis?\n\n      You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe him, or me, your own husband, either?\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Eo fit quia mihi\n  plurimum credo et scio istaec facta proinde ut proloquor.\n\n      That is only because I believe myself most of all, and I\n      know everything occurred just as I tell you.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Tun me heri advenisse dicis?\n\n      And you say that I arrived yesterday?\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Tun te abiisse hodie hinc negas?\n\n      And you deny that you left to-day?\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Nego enim vero, et me advenire nunc primum aio ad te domum.\n\n      Deny it? Of course I do. And I say I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just now coming home\n      to you for the first time.\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Obsecro, etiamne hoc negabis, te auream pateram mihi             760\n  dedisse dono hodie, qua te illi donatum esse dixeras?\n\n      And will you deny this, too, pray,--that you gave me the\n      golden bowl to-day that was presented to you there, as you\n      said?\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Neque edepol dedi neque dixi; verum ita animatus fui\n  itaque nunc sum, ut ea te patera donem. sed quis istuc tibi dixit?\n\n      By heaven! I neither gave it nor said it. But I did intend\n      to make you a gift of that bowl, and do still. Who told you\n      of that, though?\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Ego equidem ex te audivi et ex tua accepi manu pateram.\n\n      Why, I heard about it from your own lips and received the\n      bowl from your own hand.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Mane, mane, obsecro te. nimis demiror, Sosia,\n  qui illaec illic me donatum esse aurea patera sciat,\n  nisi tu dudum hanc convenisti et narravisti haec omnia.\n\n      One moment, please, one moment! (_turning to Sosia_) It\n      is very extraordinary. Sosia, how she knows I was presented\n      with a golden bowl there, unless you met her a while ago\n      yourself and told her the whole story.\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Neque edepol ego dixi neque istam vidi nisi tecum simul.\n\n      By gad, sir, I never told her, no, nor saw her, except here\n      with you.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Quid hoc sit hominis?\n\n      (_helplessly_) What sort of a creature have I got here?\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Vin proferri pateram?\n\n      Would you like to have the bowl brought?\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Proferri volo.\n\n      Indeed I should.\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Fiat heus tu, Thessala, intus pateram proferto foras,            770\n  qua hodie meus vir donavit me.\n\n      Very well. (_calling to maid within_) Ho, there! Thessala,\n      bring out the bowl my husband gave me to day.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Secede huc tu, Sosia,\n  enim vero illud praeter alia mira miror maxime,\n  si haec habet pateram illam.\n\n      Sosia! Come over here. (_they withdraw somewhat_) Upon my\n      soul, it will be the most astounding of all these astounding\n      circumstances, if she has that.\n\n_Sos._\n\n  An etiam credis id, quae in hac cistellula\n  tuo signo obsignata fertur?\n\n      Do you really believe that, sir, when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got it in this\n      little chest here, sealed with your own signet?\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Salvom signum est?\n\n      Is the seal intact?\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Inspice.\n\n      (_showing chest_) Look and see.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Recte, ita est ut obsignavi.\n\n      (_doing so_) It is all right--just as I sealed it.\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Quaeso, quin tu istanc iubes\n  pro cerrita circumferri?\n\n      For heaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you have her treated for\n      lunacy?\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Edepol qui facto est opus;\n  nam haec quidem edepol larvarum plenast.\n\n      By Jove, so I should! Why, bless my soul, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full of evil\n      spirits!\n\n      ENTER _Thessala_ WITH BOWL.\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Quid verbis opust?\n  em tibi pateram, eccam.\n\n      Are you satisfied, sir? There! Your bowl, see!\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Cedo mi.\n\n      (_dumbfounded_) Give it here!\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Age aspice huc sis nunciam\n  tu qui quae facta infitiare, quem ego iam hic convincam palam\n  estne haec patera qua donatu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s illi?\n\n      Come now, be so good as to look at it, you that do a thing\n      and then disown it. I shall refute you plainly, sir, here\n      and now. Is this the bowl which they presented to you there,\n      or not?\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Summe Iuppiter,                                                  780\n  quid ego video? haec ea est profecto patera. perii, Sosia.\n\n      (_taking it_) Jove almighty! What do I see? The\n      selfsame bowl, it is, it is! This is frightful, Sosia!\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Aut pol haec praestigiatrix multo mulier maxima est\n  aut pateram hic inesse oportet.\n\n      By gad, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s either the greatest enchantress alive, easily,\n      or the bowl must be inside here. (_pointing to chest_)\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Agedum, exsolve cistulam.\n\n      Come, come, unfasten the chest!\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Quid ego istam exsolvam? obsignatast recte, res gesta est bene:\n  tu peperisti Amphitruonem, ego alium peperi Sosiam;\n  nunc si patera pateram peperit, omnes congeminavimus.\n\n      Unfasten it? Why? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sealed all right, everything is\n      shipshape. You have spawned another Amphitryon; I have\n      spawned another Sosia; now if the bowl has spawned another\n      bowl, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve all doubled.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Certum est aperire atque inspicere.\n\n      I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m resolved: it must be opened and inspected.\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Vide sis signi quid siet,\n  ne posterius in me culpam conferas.\n\n      You please take a look at the seal, sir, so that you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\n      blame me later.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Aperi modo;\n  nam haec quidem nos delirantis facere dictis postulat.\n\n      (_looking_) Yes, yes, open up! Why, the woman is bent on\n      driving us mad with her talk.\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Unde haec igitur est nisi abs te quae mihi dono data est?        790\n\n      Where did this come from, then, if not as a present from you?\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Opus mi est istuc exquisito.\n\n      (_curtly_) This matter needs my investigation.\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Iuppiter, pro Iuppiter.\n\n      (_busy with chest_) By Jove! Oh, by Jove!\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Quid tibi est?\n\n      (_excited_) What is it?\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Hic patera nulla in cistulast.\n\n      There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no bowl in the chest here at all!\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Quid ego audio?\n\n      What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that you say?\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Id quod verumst.\n\n      It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the honest truth.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  At cum cruciatu iam, nisi apparet, tuo.\n\n      But your skin shall soon pay for it, if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not forthcoming.\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Haec quidem apparet.\n\n      This one is forthcoming, at any rate.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Quis igitur tibi dedit?\n\n      (_roughly_) Who gave it you, then?\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Qui me rogat.\n\n      (_calmly_) My questioner.\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Me captas, quia tute ab navi clanculum huc alia via\n  praecucurristi, atque hinc pateram tute exemisti atque eam\n  huic dedisti, post hanc rursum obsignasti clanculum.\n\n      (_to Amphitryon_) Trying to catch me! The fact is you ran on\n      ahead from the ship yourself by another road on the sly, and\n      took the bowl out yourself, and gave it to her, and then\n      sealed up the chest again on the sly.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Ei mihi, iam tu quoque huius adiuvas insaniam?\n  an heri nos advenisse huc?\n\n      Oh, ye gods! So now you are abetting her delusions, too!\n      (_to Alcmena, with forced calmness_) We came here yesterday,\n      you say?\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Aio, adveniensque ilico\n  me salutavisti, et ego te, et osculum tetuli tibi.               800\n\n      Yes, and the moment you arrived you greeted me, and I you,\n      and I gave you a kiss.\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Iam illud non placet principium de osculo.\n\n      Now I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like that, that beginning with a kiss!\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Perge exsequi.\n\n      Go on, go on!\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Lavisti.\n\n      Then you bathed.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Quid postquam lavi?\n\n      And after bathing?\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Accubuisti.\n\n      You took your place on the dining couch.\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Euge optime,\n  nunc exquire.\n\n        Bravo, sir! Great work! Now get to the bottom of it.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Ne interpella. perge porro dicere.\n\n      (_to Sosia_) No interruptions! (_to Alcmena_) Go on with\n      your story.\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Cena adposita est, cenavisti mecum, ego accubui simul.\n\n      Dinner was served: we dined together: I took my place on the\n      couch, too.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  In eodem lecto?\n\n      The same couch?\n\n_Alc._\n\n  In eodem.\n\n      Surely.\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Ei, non placet convivium.\n\n      Oho! This banqueting looks bad!\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Sine modo argumenta dicat. quid postquam cenavimus?\n\n      (_to Sosia_) That will do. Let her state her case. (_to\n      Alcmena_) What after we dined?\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Te dormitare aibas, mensa ablata est. cubitum hinc abiimus.\n\n      You said you were sleepy: the table was removed: we went off\n      to bed.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Ubi tu cubuisti?\n\n      Where did you sleep?\n\n_Alc._\n\n  In eodem lecto tecum una in cubiculo.\n\n      Why, with you, in our room.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Perdidisti.\n\n      Oh, my God!\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Quid tibi est?\n\n      What ails you?\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Haec me modo ad mortem dedit.\n\n      She has killed me, killed me!\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Quid iam, amabo?\n\n      Why, my dear man, what do you mean?\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Ne me appella.\n\n      (_furiously_) Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speak to me!\n\n_Sos._\n\n  Quid tibi est?\n\n      What ails you?\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Perii miser,                                                     810\n  quia pudicitiae huius vitium me hinc absente est additum.\n\n      Oh, God help me! She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been seduced while I was gone!\n\n_Alc._\n\n  Obsecro ecastor, cur istuc, mi vir, ex ted audio?\n\n      Good heavens! For mercy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake how can you say such a thing,\n      my dear husband?\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Vir ego tuos sim? ne me appella, falsa, falso nomine.\n\n      Am I your husband? Oh, you false wretch, none of your false\n      names for me!\n\n_Sos_\n\n  Haeret haec res, si quidem haec iam mulier facta est ex viro.\n\n      Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty mess, if he is turned into a woman and is\n      not her husband!\n\n_Alc_\n\n  Quid ego feci, qua istaec propter dicta dicantur mihi?\n\n      What have I done to be talked to like that?\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Tute edictas facta tua, ex me quaeris quid deliqueris.\n\n      You have recounted your doings yourself--and you ask me what\n      the harm is!\n\n_Alc_\n\n  Quid ego tibi deliqui, si, cum nupta sum, tecum fui?\n\n      Pray tell me what I have done in being with you, the man I\n      married?\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Tun mecum fueris? quid illac impudente audacius?\n  saltem, tute si pudoris egeas, sumas mutuom.\n\n      You with me? Of all brazen shamelessness!

Angle for me if you wish, you cannot\n      catch me in such unspeakable conduct.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Pro di immortales, cognoscin tu me saltem, Sosia?\n\n      Great God!

As\n      soon as her time comes she calls on the gods to help her,\n      and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a grumbling and rumbling and smashing and\n      crashing--what a crash, so sudden and quick and heavy it\n      was! Every one fell flat where he stood at the peal. And\n      then some one or other called out in a mighty voice:\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlcmena, help is at hand: be not afraid. To thee and thine\n      the sovereign of the skies comes in kindliness.

Just then Alcmena\n      calls for me to come. I was trembling already at what\n      happened, but fear of mistress prevailed, and up I run\n      to find out what she wants. And there I see she has given\n      birth to twins, boys, and not a soul of us noticed when\n      it happened, or is ready for it!\n\n  sed quid hoc? quis hic est senex, qui ante aedis nostras sic iacet?\n  numnam hunc percussit Iuppiter?\n  credo edepol, nam, pro Iuppiter, sepultust quasi sit mortuos.\n  ibo et cognoscam, quisquis est.

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll soon give you signs and\n      proofs of that.

She had no sooner begun than there was a\n      frightful thunder clap. At first we thought your house was\n      tumbling down: your whole house was shining, sir, just as if\n      it was gold.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Quaeso absolvito hinc me extemplo, quando satis deluseris.\n  quid fit deinde?\n\n      For heaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake hurry up and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep me on tenterhooks!\n      I have had enough of your trifling!

After they were born she\n      told us to bathe them. We began. But that boy I bathed! How\n      big and strong he was! Not a soul of us could wrap him in\n      his swaddling clothes.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Nimia mira memoras; si istaec vera sunt, divinitus\n  non metuo quin meae uxori latae suppetiae sient.\n\n      A most astounding story!

Well, the serpents glared around at all of\n      us. As soon as they spied the boys they made for the cradles\n      like a flash. I backed away, fearful for the boys and\n      frightened for myself, pulling and hauling the cradles along\n      after me with the serpents a-chasing us all the angrier. The\n      minute that boy I was telling of sets eyes on the serpents\n      he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up and out of that cradle in a trice, rushing straight\n      for \u00e2\u0080\u0099em and grabbing \u00e2\u0080\u0099em one in each hand quick as a wink.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Mira memoras, nimis formidolosum facinus praedicas;\n  nam mihi horror membra misero percipit dictis tuis.\n  quid fit deinde? porro loquere.\n\n      Astounding! Astounding! A perfectly horrifying tale! Mercy\n      on us! why, your very words palsy me! What then? Go on, go\n      on!\n\n_Brom._\n\n  Puer ambo angues enicat.\n  dum haec aguntur, voce clara exclamat uxorem tuam--              1120\n\n      The boy chokes both serpents to death. While this is going\n      on, in a clear voice he calls out the name of your wife--\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Quis homo?\n\n      Who does?\n\n_Brom._\n\n  Summus imperator divom atque hominum Iuppiter.\n  is se dixit cum Alcumena clam consuetum cubitibus,\n  eumque filium suom esse qui illos angues vicerit;\n  alterum tuom esse dixit puerum.\n\n      The almighty ruler of gods and men, Jupiter. He said that he\n      himself had secretly shared Alcmena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bed and that that was\n      his son who had crushed the serpents: the other one, he\n      said, was your own child.\n\n_Amph._\n\n  Pol me haud paenitet,\n  si licet boni dimidium mihi dividere cum Iove.\n  abi domum, iube vasa pura actutum adornari mihi,\n  ut Iovis supremi multis hostiis pacem expetam.\n\n      Well, well, well!

Then your very house used to be wreathed in smiles,\n      when I turned up. You used to say I was the one and only\n      love in all the world for you and her.\n\n  ubi quid dederam, quasi columbae pulli in ore ambae meo\n  usque eratis, meo de studio studia erant vostra omnia,           210\n  usque adhaerebatis: quod ego iusseram, quod volueram\n  faciebatis, quod nolebam ac votueram, de industria\n  fugiebatis, neque conari id facere audebatis prius.\n  nunc neque quid velim neque nolim facitis magni, pessumae.\n\n      After I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d given you anything the both of you used to keep\n      hanging on my lips like a pair of young doves. Whatever I\n      fancied, you fancied, and nothing else. You used to keep\n      clinging to me. I ordered a thing, wished a thing,--you used\n      to do it: I disliked a thing, forbade a thing,--you used to\n      take pains to avoid doing it: you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dare attempt to do\n      it then.

This\n      profession of ours is a great deal like bird-catching. The\n      fowler, when he has his fowling-floor prepared, spreads food\n      around; the birds become familiarized: you must spend money,\n      if you wish to make money. They often get a meal: but once\n      they get caught they recoup the fowler. It is quite the same\n      with us here: our house is the floor, I am the fowler, the\n      girl the bait, the couch the decoy, the lovers the birds.\n\n  bene salutando consuescunt, compellando blanditer,\n  osculando, oratione vinnula, venustula.\n  si papillam pertractavit, haud est ab re aucupis;\n  savium si sumpsit, sumere eum licet sine retibus.\n  haecine te esse oblitum, in ludo qui fuisti tam diu?\n\n      They become familiar through pleasant greetings, pretty\n      speeches, kisses, cooey, captivating little whispers.

He\n      busy in the Senate or helping his clients! He wearied out\n      by his labours there, there, that he spends the whole night\n      snoring! It is business away from home that makes him turn\n      up at night all weary--the business of ploughing other\n      people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fields and leaving his own uncultivated. Corrupt\n      himself, he actually goes on and corrupts his own son.\n\n_Par._\n\n  Sequere hac me modo, iam faxo ipsum hominem manifesto opprimas.\n\n      Just follow me this way: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll soon make you drop on our\n      gentleman in the very act.\n\n_Art._\n\n  Nihil ecastor est quod facere mavelim.\n\n      Ah-h-h!

For many years now I have possessed this\n      dwelling, and preserved it for the sire and grandsire of its\n      present occupant. Now this man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grandsire as a suppliant\n      entrusted to me, in utter secrecy, a hoard of gold: he\n      buried it in the centre of the hearth, entreating me to\n      guard it for him.\n\n  is quoniam moritur--ita avido ingenio fuit--\n  numquam indicare id filio voluit suo,                             10\n  inopemque optavit potius eum relinquere,\n  quam eum thensaurum commonstraret filio;\n  agri reliquit ei non magnum modum,\n  quo cum labore magno et misere viveret.\n\n      When he died he could not bear--so covetous was he--to\n      reveal its existence to his own son, and he chose to leave\n      him penniless rather than apprise him of this treasure. Some\n      land, a little only, he did leave him, whereon to toil and\n      moil for a miserable livelihood.\n\n  Ubi is obiit mortem qui mihi id aurum credidit,\n  coepi observare, ecqui maiorem filus\n  mihi honorem haberet quam eius habuisset pater.\n  atque ille vero minus minusque impendio\n  curare minusque me impertire honoribus.\n  item a me contra factum est, nam item obiit diem.                 20\n  is ex se hunc reliquit qui hic nunc habitat filium\n  pariter moratum ut pater avosque huius fuit.\n\n      After the death of him who had committed the gold to my\n      keeping, I began to observe whether the son would hold me in\n      greater honour than his father had. As a matter of fact, his\n      neglect grew and grew apace, and he showed me less honour.\n      I did the same by him: so he also died. He left a son who\n      occupies this house at present, a man of the same mould as\n      his sire and grandsire.\n\n  huic filia una est. ea mihi cottidie\n  aut ture aut vino aut aliqui semper supplicat,\n  dat mihi coronas. eius honoris gratia\n  feci, thensaurum ut hic reperiret Euclio,\n  quo illam facilius nuptum, si vellet, daret\n  nam eam compressit de summo adulescens loco.\n  is scit adulescens quae sit quam compresserit,\n  illa illum nescit, neque compressam autem pater.                  30\n\n      He has one daughter. She prays to me constantly, with\n      daily gifts of incense, or wine, or something; she gives me\n      garlands. Out of regard for her I caused Euclio to discover\n      the treasure here in order that he might the more easily\n      find her a husband, if he wished. For she has been ravished\n      by a young gentleman of very high rank. He knows who it is\n      that he has wronged; who he is she does not know, and as for\n      her father, he is ignorant of the whole affair.\n\n  Eam ego hodie faciam ut hic senex de proxumo\n  sibi uxorem poscat. id ea faciam gratia,\n  quo ille eam facilius ducat qui compresserat.\n  et hic qui poscet eam sibi uxorem senex,\n  is adulescentis illius est avonculus,\n  qui illam stupravit noctu, Cereris vigiliis.\n\n      I shall make the old gentleman who lives next door\n      here (_pointing_) ask for her hand to-day. My reason for so\n      doing is that the man who wronged her may marry her the more\n      easily. And the old gentleman who is to ask for her hand is the\n      uncle of the young gentleman who violated her by night\n      at the festival of Ceres.\n\n  sed hic senex iam clamat intus ut solet.\n  anum foras extrudit, ne sit conscia.\n  credo aurum inspicere volt, ne subreptum siet.\n\n      (_an uproar in Euclio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house_) But there is old Euclio\n      clamouring within as usual, and turning his ancient servant\n      out of doors lest she learn his secret. I suppose he wishes\n      to look at his gold and see that it is not stolen.

I think it must have been fated; otherwise it\n      wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have happened, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure of that.\n\n_Eucl._\n\n  At ego deos credo voluisse ut apud me te in nervo enicem.\n\n      Yes, and I think it must have been fated that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m to shackle\n      you at my house and murder you!\n\n_Lyc._\n\n  Ne istuc dixis.\n\n      Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say that, sir.\n\n_Eucl._\n\n  Quid tibi ergo meam me invito tactiost?\n\n      Then why did you lay hands on what was mine, without my\n      permission?\n\n_Lyc._\n\n  Quia vini vitio atque amoris feci.\n\n      It was all because of drink ... and ... love, sir.\n\n_Eucl._\n\n  Homo audacissime,\n  cum istacin te oratione huc ad me adire ausum, impudens!\n  nam si istuc ius est ut tu istuc excusare possies,\n  luci claro deripiamus aurum matronis palam,\n  post id si prehensi simus, excusemus ebrios\n  nos fecisse amoris causa. nimis vilest vinum atque amor,         750\n  si ebrio atque amanti impune facere quod lubeat licet.\n\n      The colossal impudence of it! To dare to come to me with a\n      tale like that, you shameless rascal! Why, if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal to\n      clear yourself that way, we should be stripping ladies of\n      their jewellery on the public highways in broad daylight!\n      And then when we were caught we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d excuse ourselves on the\n      score that we were drunk, and did it out of love. Drink and\n      love are altogether too cheap, if your drunken lover can do\n      what he likes and not suffer for it.\n\n_Lyc._\n\n  Quin tibi ultro supplicatum venio obstultitiam meam.\n\n      Yes, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come of my own accord sir, to entreat you to\n      pardon my madness.\n\n_Eucl._\n\n  Non mi homines placent qui quando male fecerunt purigant.\n  tu illam scibas non tuam esse. non attactam oportuit.\n\n      I have no patience with men who do wrong and then try to\n      explain it away. You knew you had no right to act so: you\n      should have kept hands off.\n\n_Lyc._\n\n  Ergo quia sum tangere ausus, haud causificor quin eam\n  ego habeam potissimum.\n\n      Well, now that I did venture to act so, I have no objection\n      to holding to it, sir,--I ask nothing better.\n\n_Eucl_\n\n  Tun habeas me invito meam?\n\n      (_more angry_) Hold to it? Against my will?\n\n_Lyc._\n\n  Haud te invito postulo, sed meam esse oportere arbitror.\n  quin tu iam invenies, inquam, meam illam esse oportere, Euclio.\n\n      I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t insist on it against your will, sir, but I do think\n      my claim is just. Why, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll soon come to realize the\n      justice of it yourself, sir, I assure you.\n\n_Eucl._\n\n  Iam quidem hercle te ad praetorem rapiam et tibi scribam dicam,\n  nisi refers.\n\n      I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll march you off to court and sue you, by heaven I will,\n      this minute, unless you bring it back.\n\n_Lyc._\n\n  Quid tibi ego referam?\n\n      I? Bring what back?\n\n_Eucl._\n\n  Quod surripuisti meum.                                           760\n\n      What you stole from me.\n\n_Lyc._\n\n  Surripui ego tuom? unde? aut quid id est?\n\n      I stole something of yours? Where from? What?\n\n_Eucl._\n\n  Ita te amabit Iuppiter\n  ut tu nescis.\n\n      (_ironically_) God bless your innocence--you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know!\n\n_Lyc._\n\n  Nisi quidem tu mihi quid quaeras dixeris.\n\n      Not unless you say what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for.\n\n_Eucl._\n\n  Aulam auri, inquam, te resposco, quam tu confessu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mihi\n  te abstulisse.\n\n      The pot of gold, I tell you; I want back the pot of gold you\n      owned up to taking.\n\n_Lyc._\n\n  Neque edepol ego dixi neque feci.\n\n      Great heavens, man! I never said that or did it, either.\n\n_Eucl._\n\n  Negas?\n\n      You deny it?\n\n_Lyc._\n\n  Pernego immo. nam neque ego aurum neque istaec aula quae siet\n  scio nec novi.\n\n      Deny it? Absolutely. Why, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any idea,\n      about your gold, or what that pot is.\n\n_Eucl._\n\n  Illam, ex Silvani luco quam abstuleras, cedo.\n  i, refer. dimidiam tecum potius partem dividam.\n  tam etsi fur mihi es, molestus non ero. i vero, refer.\n\n      The one you took from the grove of Silvanus--give it me. Go,\n      bring it back. (_pleadingly_) You can have half of it, yes,\n      yes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll divide. Even though you are such a thief, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\n      make any trouble for you. Do, do go and bring it back, oh do!\n\n_Lyc._\n\n  Sanus tu non es qui furem me voces. ego te, Euclio,\n  de alia re rescivisse censui, quod ad me attinet;                770\n  [16]magna est res quam ego tecum otiose, si otium est, cupio loqui.\n\n      Man alive, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re out of your senses, calling me a thief.\n      I supposed you had found out about something else that does\n      concern me, Euclio. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an important matter I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m anxious\n      to talk over quietly with you, sir, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at leisure.\n\n_Eucl._\n\n  Dic bona fide: tu id aurum non surripuisti?\n\n      Give me your word of honour: you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t steal that gold?\n\n_Lyc._\n\n  Bona.\n\n      (_shaking his head_) On my honour.\n\n_Eucl._\n\n  Neque eum scis qui abstulerit?\n\n      And you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know the man that did take it?\n\n_Lyc._\n\n  Istuc quoque bona.\n\n      Nor that, either, on my honour.\n\n_Eucl._\n\n  Atque id si scies\n  qui abstulerit, mihi indicabis?\n\n      And if you learn who took it, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll inform me?\n\n_Lyc._\n\n  Faciam.\n\n      I will.\n\n_Eucl._\n\n  Neque partem tibi\n  ab eo qui habet indipisces neque furem excipies?\n\n      And you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go shares with the man that has it, or shield\n      the thief?\n\n_Lyc._\n\n  Ita.\n\n      No.\n\n_Eucl._\n\n  Quid si fallis?\n\n      What if you deceive me?\n\n_Lyc._\n\n  Tum me faciat quod volt magnus Iuppiter.\n\n      Then, sir, may I be dealt with as great God sees fit.\n\n_Eucl._\n\n  Sat habeo. age nunc loquere quid vis.\n\n      That will suffice. All right now, say what you want.\n\n_Lyc._\n\n  Si me novisti minus,\n  genere quo sim gnatus: hic mihi est Megadorus avonculus,\n  meus pater fuit Antimachus, ego vocor Lyconides.\n  mater est Eunomia.\n\n      In case you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not acquainted with my family connections,\n      sir,--Megadorus here is my uncle: my father was Antimachus,\n      and my own name is Lyconides: Eunomia is my mother.\n\n_Eucl._\n\n  Novi genus. nunc quid vis? id volo                               780\n  noscere.\n\n      I know who you are. Now what do you want? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I wish\n      to know.\n\n_Lyc._\n\n  Filiam ex te tu habes.\n\n      You have a daughter.\n\n_Eucl._\n\n  Immo eccillam domi.\n\n      Yes, yes, at home there!\n\n_Lyc._\n\n  Eam tu despondisti, opinor, meo avonculo?\n\n      You have betrothed her to my uncle, I understand.\n\n_Eucl._\n\n  Omnem rem tenes.\n\n      Precisely, precisely.\n\n_Lyc._\n\n  Is me nunc renuntiare repudium iussit tibi.\n\n      He has asked me to inform you now that he breaks the\n      engagement.\n\n_Eucl._\n\n  Repudium rebus paratis, exornatis nuptiis?\n  ut illum di immortales omnes deaeque quantum est perduint,\n  quem propter hodie auri tantum perdidi infelix, miser.\n\n      (_furious_) Breaks the engagement, with everything ready,\n      the wedding prepared for? May all the everlasting powers\n      above consume that villain that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to blame for my losing my\n      gold, all that gold, poor God forsaken creature that I am!\n\n_Lyc._\n\n  Bono animo es, bene dice. nunc quae res tibi et gnatae tuae\n  bene feliciterque vortat--ita di faxint, inquito.\n\n      Brace up, sir: don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t curse. And now for some thing that I\n      pray will turn out well and happily for yourself and your\n      daughter--\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod grant it may!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Say that.\n\n_Eucl._\n\n  Ita di faciant.\n\n      (_doubtfully_) God grant it may!\n\n_Lyc._\n\n  Et mihi ita di faciant. audi nunciam.\n  qui homo culpam admisit in se, nullust tam parvi preti,          790\n  quom pudeat, quin purget sese. nunc te obtestor, Euclio,\n  ut si quid ego erga te imprudens peccavi aut gnatam tuam,\n  ut mi ignoscas eamque uxorem mihi des, ut leges iubent.\n  ego me iniuriam fecisse filiae fateor tuae,\n  Cereris vigiliis, per vinum atque impulsu adulescentiae.\n\n      And God grant it may for me, too! Now listen, sir. There\n      isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a man alive so worthless but what he wants to clear\n      himself when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done wrong and is ashamed. Now, sir, if\n      I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve injured you or your daughter without realizing what I\n      was doing, I implore you to forgive me and let me marry her\n      as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m legally bound to. (_nervously_) It was the night of\n      Ceres\u00e2\u0080\u0099 festival ... and what with wine and ... a young\n      fellow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s natural impulses together ... I wronged her,\n      I confess it.\n\n_Eucl._\n\n  Ei mihi, quod ego facinus ex te audio?\n\n      Oh, oh, my God! What villainy am I hearing of?\n\n_Lyc._\n\n  Cur eiulas,\n  quem ego avom feci iam ut esses filiai nuptus?\n  nam tua gnata peperit, decumo mense post: numerum cape;\n  ea re repudium remisit avonculus causa mea.\n  i intro, exquaere, sitne ita ut ego praedico.\n\n      (_patting his shoulder_) Lamenting, sir, lamenting, when\n      you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a grandfather, and this your daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wedding day?\n      You see it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the tenth month since the festival--reckon it\n      up--and we have a child, sir. This explains my uncle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n      breaking the engagement: he did it for my sake. Go in and\n      inquire if it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just as I tell you.\n\n_Eucl._\n\n  Perii oppido,                                                    800\n  ita mihi ad malum malae res plurimae se adglutinant.\n  ibo intro, ut quid huius verum sit sciam.\n\n      Oh, my life is wrecked, wrecked! The way calamities swarm\n      down and settle on me one after another! Go in I will, and\n      have the truth of it!                  [EXIT INTO HIS HOUSE.\n\n_Lyc._\n\n  Iam te sequor\n  haec propemodum iam esse in vado salutis res videtur\n  nunc servom esse ubi dicam meum Strobilum non reperio;\n  nisi etiam hic opperiar tamen paulisper, postea intro\n  hunc subsequar. nunc interim spatium ei dabo exquirendi\n  meum factum ex gnatae pedisequa nutrice anu. ea rem novit.\n\n      (_as he disappears_) I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll soon be with you, sir. (_after\n      a pause, contentedly_) It does look as if we were pretty\n      nearly safe in the shallows now. (_looking around_) Where in\n      the world my fellow Strobilus is I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t imagine. Well, the\n      only thing to do is to wait here a bit longer; then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\n      join father-in-law inside. Meanwhile I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll let him have an\n      opportunity to inquire into the case from the old nurse\n      that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been his daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maid: she knows about it all.\n      (_waits in doorway_)\n\n\n\n\nACTVS V\n\n    ACT V\n\n\n    ENTER _Strobilus._\n\n_Strob._\n\n  Di immortales quibus et quantis me donatis gaudiis.\n  quadrilibrem aulam auro onustam habeo. quis me est ditior?\n  quis me Athenis nunc magis quisquam est\n        homo cui di sint propitii?                                 810\n\n      Ye immortal gods, what joy, what bliss, ye bless me with!\n      I have a four pound pot of gold, chock full of gold!

Aye, and this\n      horse will proceed to assail not a stronghold, but a\n      strongbox. The wreck, ruin, and rape of the old man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n      gold will this horse prove to-day.\n\n  nostro seni huic stolido, ei profecto nomen facio ego Ilio;\n  miles Menelaust, ego Agamemno, idem Vlixes Lartius,\n  Mnesilochust Alexander, qui erit exitio rei patriae suae;\n  is Helenam avexit, cuia causa nunc facio obsidium Ilio.\n\n      This silly old man of ours--I dub him Ilium, I certainly\n      do. The Captain is Menelaus, I Agamemnon: I am likewise\n      Laertian Ulysses: Mnesilochus is Alexander,[M] who will be\n      the destruction of his native city; he is the one that\n      carried off Helen, on account of whom I now besiege Ilium.\n\n        [Footnote M: Paris]\n\n  nam illi itidem Vlixem audivi, ut ego sum,\n        fuisse et audacem et malum:\n  in dolis ego prensus sum,\n        ille mendicans paene inventus interiit,                    950\n  dum ibi exquirit fata Iliorum; adsimiliter mi hodie optigit.\n  vinctus sum. sed dolis me exemi: item se ille servavit dolis.\n\n      At that Ilium Ulysses, so they say, was a bold, bad man,\n      just as I am now. I was caught in my wiles; he was found\n      begging and almost perished, while he was seeking to learn\n      there the destinies of the Ilians. What befell me to-day\n      was quite similar. I was bound, but released myself by\n      wiles: by wiles he likewise saved himself.\n\n  Ilio tria fuisse audivi fata quae illi forent exitio:\n  signum ex arce si periisset; alterum etiamst Troili mors;\n  tertium, cum portae Phrygiae limen superum scinderetur:\n  paria item tria eis tribus sunt fata nostro huic Ilio.\n\n      In the case of that Ilium, so they say, there were three\n      fateful events which would prove her downfall: if the\n      image[N] disappeared from the citadel; still a second,\n      the death of Troilus[O]; the third, when the upper lintel\n      of the Phrygian gate should be torn away. Counterparts of\n      these three are three fateful events, too, in the case of\n      this Ilium of ours.\n\n        [Footnote N: The Palladium, a statue of Pallas]\n\n        [Footnote O: A son of Priam, slain by Achilles]\n\n  nam dudum primo ut dixeram nostro seni mendacium\n  et de hospite et de auro et de lembo, ibi signum ex arce iam abstuli.\n  iam duo restabant fata tunc, nec magis id ceperam oppidum.\n  post ubi tabellas ad senem detuli, ibi occidi Troilum,           960\n  cum censuit Mnesilochum cum uxore esse dudum militis.[26]       (961)\n\n      For a little while ago when I first told our old man that\n      lie about his friend and the gold and the galley, I there\n      and then stole the image from the citadel. Even then two\n      fateful events were yet to come, and the town was still\n      untaken. Later, on carrying the letter to the old man,\n      I then slew my Troilus, when he thought Mnesilochus a\n      short time ago was with the Captain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife.[26]\n\n  post cum magnifico milite, urbes verbis qui mermus capit,       (966)\n  conflixi atque hominem reppuli; dein pugnam conserui seni:\n  eum ego adeo uno mendacio devici, uno ictu extempulo\n  cepi spolia. is nunc ducentos nummos Philippos militi,\n  quos dare se promisit, dabit,                                    970\n  nunc alteris etiam ducentis usus est, qui dispensentur\n  Ilio capto, ut sit mulsum qui triumphent milites.[27]           (972)\n\n      Still later I closed with the noble Captain--who captures\n      cities with no weapon save his mighty tongue--and hurled him\n      back. Next I joined battle with the old man: aye, and him I\n      struck down with a single lie; a single blow, and the spoils\n      were mine. He now will give the Captain the two hundred\n      pounds he promised him. And now there is need of another two\n      hundred still, to be disbursed, on Ilium\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capture, that the\n      soldiery may have wine and honey to celebrate their victory.[27]\n\n  sed Priamum adstantem eccum ante portam video.\n        adibo atque adloquar.

(_Prologue laughs uproariously at his pleasantry_)\n      I leave it to you if so much is not true. The old man that\n      lives yonder--(_pointing to Hegio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house_) Hegio, by name--\n      is this man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (_pointing to Tyndarus_) father.\n\n  sed is quo pacto serviat suo sibi patri,\n  id ego hic apud vos proloquar, si operam datis.\n  seni huic fuerunt filii nati duo;\n  alterum quadrimum puerum servos surpuit\n  eumque hinc profugiens vendidit in Alide\n  patri huius. iam hoc tenetis?[2] optume est.                      10\n\n      But how it happens that he is the slave of his own father\n      I shall (_jauntily_) here in your midst proclaim, with your\n      kind attention. This old gentleman had two sons. One of\n      them, when he was four years old, was stolen by a slave who\n      took to his heels and sold the boy in Elis to the father of\n      this worthy (_pointing to Philocrates_) here. Now you take\n      me? Very good!\n\n  negat hercle ille ultimus. accedito.\n  si non ubi sedeas locus est, est ubi ambules,\n  quando histrionem cogis mendicarier.\n  ego me tua causa, ne erres, non rupturus sum.\n  vos qui potestis ope vestra censerier,\n  accipite relicuom: alieno uti nil moror.\n\n      Bless my soul! That gentleman at the back says he does not.\n      Let him step this way--. (_no move in audience_) In case\n      there is no opportunity to take a seat, sir, you can take a\n      (_pointing to an exit_) stroll, seeing you insist on making\n      an actor turn beggar. I have no intention of bursting\n      myself, merely to keep you from misunderstanding the plot.\n      (_to rest of audience_) As for you gentlemen who do own\n      enough property to pay taxes on, let me discharge my debt--\n      none of the credit system for me.\n\n  fugitivos ille, ut dixeram ante, huius patri\n  domo quem profugiens dominum abstulerat vendidit.\n  is postquam hunc emit, dedit eum huic gnato suo\n  peculiarem, quia quasi una aetas erat.                            20\n  hic nunc domi servit suo patri, nec scit pater;\n  enim vero di nos quasi pilas homines habent.\n\n      That runaway slave, as I said before, stole his young\n      master when he decamped and sold him to this (_indicating\n      Philocrates_) man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father. This gentleman, on buying the\n      boy, gave him to this son of his for his very own, the two\n      being of about the same age. Now here he is, back home, his\n      own father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slave without his father knowing it. Ah yes,\n      the gods use us mortals as footballs!\n\n  rationem habetis, quo modo unum amiserit.\n  postquam belligerant Aetoli cum Aleis,\n  ut fit in bello, capitur alter filius:\n  medicus Menarchus emit ibidem in Alide.\n  coepit captivos commercari hic Aleos,\n  si quem reperire possit qui mutet suom,\n  illum captivom: hunc suom esse nescit, qui domist.\n\n      Well, you comprehend the way in which he lost one son.\n      Later, when war broke out between the Aetolians and Eleans,\n      the other son was taken prisoner--a common occurrence in\n      times of war--and a doctor, Menarchus, in that same Elis,\n      bought the young man. Hegio then began to buy up Elean\n      captives, hoping to get hold of one that he could exchange\n      for his son--the captive son, that is: for he has no idea\n      that this man at his home is his own child.\n\n  et quoniam heri indaudivit, de summo loco                         30\n  summoque genere captum esse equitem Aleum,\n  nil pretio parsit, filio dum parceret:\n  reconciliare ut facilius posset domum,\n  emit hosce e praeda ambos de quaestoribus.\n\n      And inasmuch as he heard it rumoured yesterday that an Elean\n      knight of the very highest rank and family connections had\n      been captured, he had no thought of saving money if only he\n      could save his son. So in the hope of getting that son back\n      home more readily he bought both of these prisoners from the\n      commissioners who were disposing of the spoils.\n\n  hisce autem inter sese hunc confinxerunt dolum.\n  quo pacto hic servos suom erum hinc amittat domum.\n  itaque inter se commutant vestem et nomina;\n  illic vocatur Philocrates, hic Tyndarus:\n  huius illic, hic illius hodie fert imaginem.\n\n      These same prisoners, however, have got together and laid\n      a scheme, as you can see, to the end that the slave here\n      (_indicating Tyndarus_) may send his master off home.\n      Accordingly, they have exchanged clothes and names with each\n      other. That one (_indicating Tyndarus_) is calling himself\n      Philocrates, and this one (_indicating Philocrates_)\n      Tyndarus: each is posing as the other for the time being.\n\n  et hic hodie expediet hanc docte fallaciam,                       40\n  et suom erum faciet libertatis compotem,\n  eodemque pacto fratrem servabit suom\n  reducemque faciet liberum in patriam ad patrem,\n  imprudens: itidem ut saepe iam in multis locis\n  plus insciens quis fecit quam prudens boni.\n\n      And Tyndarus here is going to work out this trick to-day\n      like an artist, and set his master at liberty. By so\n      doing he will rescue his own brother, too, and enable\n      him to return home to his father a free man, all quite\n      unwittingly,--as in so many cases before now a man has\n      often done more good unconsciously than wittingly.\n\n  sed inscientes sua sibi fallacia\n  ita compararunt et confinxerunt dolum\n  itaque hi commenti, de sua sententia\n  ut in servitute hic ad suom maneat patrem:\n  ita nunc ignorans suo sibi servit patri;                          50\n  homunculi quanti sunt, quom recogito!\n  haec res agetur nobis, vobis fabula.\n\n      But all unconsciously, in their trickery, they have so\n      planned and contrived and schemed, acting upon their own\n      ideas, that Tyndarus will stay here as his own father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n      slave. So now it is his father he is serving unawares. What\n      helpless creatures we mortals be, when I stop to reflect!\n      All this will be fact on the boards, fiction for the\n      benches.\n\n  sed etiam est, paucis vos quod monitos voluerim.\n  profecto expediet fabulae huic operam dare.\n  non pertractate facta est neque item ut ceterae:\n  neque spurcidici insunt versus, immemorabiles;\n  hic neque periurus leno est nec meretrix mala\n  neque miles gloriosus; ne vereamini,\n  quia bellum Aetolis esse dixi cum Aleis:\n  foris illic extra scaenam fient proelia.                          60\n\n      About one thing more, though, I should like to offer a word\n      or two of suggestion. It will undeniably be to your profit\n      to pay attention to this play. It is not composed in the\n      hackneyed style, is quite unlike other plays; nor does it\n      contain filthy lines that one must not repeat. In this\n      comedy you will meet no perjured pimp, or unprincipled\n      courtesan, or braggart captain.

So if anyone is looking for a battle scene, let him\n      pick a quarrel: if he gets a good strong opponent, I promise\n      him a glimpse of a battle scene so unpleasant that hereafter\n      he will hate the very sight of one.\n\n  abeo. valete, iudices iustissimi\n  domi duellique duellatores optumi.\n\n      (_turning to go_) And so good-bye to you, most just of\n      judges here at home and doughtiest of fighters in the field.\n                                [EXEUNT _Prologue_ AND _Captives_.\n\n\n\n\nACTVS I\n\n    ACT I\n\n\n    ENTER _Ergasilus_ LOOKING HUNGRY AND FORLORN.\n\n_Erg._\n\n  Iuventus nomen indidit Scorto mihi,\n  eo quia invocatus soleo esse in convivio.                         70\n  scio absurde dictum hoc derisores dicere,\n  at ego aio recte. nam scortum in convivio\n  sibi amator, talos quom iacit, scortum invocat.\n\n      The young fellows have dubbed me Missy, on the ground that\n      whenever they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at their banquets I feel called upon to be\n      with \u00e2\u0080\u0099em. To be sure, the professional wags say it is an\n      absurd nickname, but I protest it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good one.

Most\n      unmistakably. But by heaven, I tell you we parasites feel\n      the call more unmistakably still, for no one else ever\n      feels for us or calls us, either.

And, by gad, in this town, at\n      least, if a parasite objects to being banged about and\n      having crockery smashed on his cranium, he can betake\n      himself to the far side of Three Arch Gate and a porter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n      bag.

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big job we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got in hand: we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go\n      to sleep over it.\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  Ero ut me voles esse.\n\n      I will be all you wish me to be, sir.\n\n_Philocr._\n\n  Spero.\n\n      I hope so.\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  Nam tu nunc vides pro tuo caro capite\n  carum offerre me meum caput vilitati.                            230\n\n      For that matter, sir, you already see that to save a man I\n      love, I am holding my own life cheap, much as I love it.\n\n_Philocr._\n\n  Scio.\n\n      I realize it.\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  At scire memento, quando id quod voles habebis;\n  nam fere maxima pars morem hunc homines habent; quod sibi volunt,\n  dum id impetrant, boni sunt;\n  sed id ubi iam penes sese habent,\n  ex bonis pessimi et fraudulentissimi\n  fiunt: nunc ut mihi te volo esse autumo.[7]                     (236)\n\n      But remember to realize it when you get what you want.

How\n      cleverly he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dropped into the servant jargon!\n\n_Hegio._\n\n  Quo de genere natust illic Philocrates?\n\n      Who are Philocrates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 people there in Elis?\n\n_Philocr._\n\n  Polyplusio:\n  quod genus illi est unum pollens atque honoratissumum.\n\n      The Goldfields, sir,--the most influential and respected\n      family in those parts easily.\n\n_Hegio_\n\n  Quid ipsus hic? quo honore est illic?\n\n      And the young man himself?

Old Goldfields could get dripping out of it.\n\n_Hegio_\n\n  Quid pater, vivitne?\n\n      What about his father?

My word, sir! he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adhesive! Why, really,--just so as\n      to give you a better notion of him--whenever he sacrifices\n      to his own Guardian Spirit he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use any dishes needed in\n      the service except ones made of Samian earthenware, for fear\n      his very Guardian Spirit may steal \u00e2\u0080\u0099em. You can see from\n      this what a confiding character he is in general.\n\n_Hegio_\n\n  Sequere hac me igitur. eadem ego ex hoc quae volo exquaesivero.\n  Philocrates, hic fecit, hominem frugi ut facere oportuit.\n  nam ego ex hoc quo genere gnatus sis scio, hic fassust mihi;\n  haec tu eadem si confiteri vis, tua ex re feceris:\n  quae tamen scio scire me ex hoc.\n\n      Well, well, come this way with me. (_aside, as they join\n      Tyndarus_) I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll soon get the information I want out of the\n      master here at the same time. (_to Tyndarus_) Philocrates,\n      your servant has acted as a worthy fellow ought to act.\n      Yes, I know from him about your family: he has admitted\n      everything. If you choose to be equally open with me, it\n      will be to your advantage: however, I have been completely\n      informed already by him.\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  Fecit officium hic suom,\n  cum tibi est confessus verum, quamquam volui sedulo\n  meam nobilitatem occultare et genus et divitias meas,\n  Hegio; nunc quando patriam et libertatem perdidi,                300\n  non ego istunc me potius quam te metuere aequom censeo.\n  vis hostilis cum istoc fecit meas opes aequabiles;\n  memini, cum dicto haud audebat: facto nunc laedat licet.\n\n      (_with dignified melancholy_) He has done his duty in\n      admitting the truth to you, much as I did wish to keep you\n      in the dark, Hegio, about my rank and birth and wealth; now\n      that I am a man without a country, a prisoner, I suppose it\n      is not to be expected that he should stand more in\n      awe of me than of you. The chances of war have put master\n      and man on an equal footing. I remember the time when he did\n      not venture to offend me by a word: now he is at liberty to\n      do me an actual injury.\n\n  sed viden? fortuna humana fingit artatque ut lubet:\n  me, qui liber fueram servom fecit, e summo infimum;\n  qui imperare insueram, nunc alterius imperio obsequor.\n  et quidem si, proinde ut ipse fui imperator familiae,\n  habeam dominum, non verear ne iniuste aut graviter mi imperet.\n  Hegio, hoc te monitum, nisi forte ipse non vis, voluerim.\n\n      But you see! fortune moulds us, pinches us, to suit her\n      whims: here am I, the one-time free man, a slave--tossed\n      from the heights to the depths. Accustomed to command,\n      I am now at another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beck and call. And indeed, if I might\n      have such a master as I myself was when I was the head of a\n      household, I should have no fear of being treated unjustly\n      or harshly. There is one thing I should like to impress upon\n      you, Hegio,--unless you object, maybe.\n\n_Hegio_\n\n  Loquere audacter.\n\n      No, no, speak out.\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  Tam ego fui ante liber quam gnatus tuos,                         310\n  tam mihi quam illi libertatem hostilis eripuit manus.\n  tam ille apud nos servit, quam ego nunc his apud te servio.\n  est profecto deus, qui quae nos gerimus auditque et videt:\n  is, uti tu me his habueris, proinde illum illic curaverit;\n  bene merenti bene profuerit, male merenti par erit.\n  quam tu filium tuom, tam pater me meus desiderat.\n\n      Once I was free as your son; an enemy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success deprived me\n      of my liberty as he was deprived of his; he is a slave in my\n      country as I am here with you. There surely is a God who\n      hears and sees what we do: and according to your treatment\n      of me here, so will he look after your son there. He will\n      reward the deserving and requite the undeserving. Just as\n      you long for your son, so does my father long for me.\n\n_Hegio_\n\n  Memini ego istuc. sed faterin eadem quae hic fassust mihi?\n\n      I know all that--but do you admit the truth of what this\n      fellow has told me?\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  Ego patri meo esse fateor summas divitias domi\n  meque summo genere gnatum. sed te optestor, Hegio,\n  ne tuom animum avariorem faxint divitiae meae:                   320\n  ne patri, tam etsi sum unicus, decere videatur magis,\n  me saturum servire apud te sumptu et vestitu tuo\n  potius quam illi,\n        ubi minime honestumst, mendicantem vivere.[11]            (323)\n\n      I do admit that my father is a very wealthy man at home and\n      that I do come of very good family. But, Hegio, I beseech\n      you, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let my wealth make your demands too exorbitant:\n      for my father, even though I am his only son, might feel\n      that it was better for me to remain your slave, well fed and\n      clothed at your expense, than to come to beggary\n      there at home where it would disgrace us most.\n\n_Hegio_\n\n  Non ego omnino lucrum omne esse utile homini existimo           (325)\n  scio ego, multos iam lucrum lutulentos homines reddidit,\n  est etiam ubi profecto damnum praestet facere quam lucrum.\n  odi ego aurum: multa multis saepe suasit perperam.\n\n      I am not a man who regards each and every acquisition of\n      money as a blessing: plenty of people have been tainted\n      before now by this money getting, I know that. There are\n      even times when it certainly is more profitable to lose\n      money than to make it. Gold!

But come now, confound\n      it, look me in the eye!\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  Em.\n\n      (_doing so coolly_) Well?\n\n_Arist._\n\n  Dic modo:                                                        570\n  tun negas te Tyndarum esse?\n\n      Now tell me: do you deny that you are Tyndarus?\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  Nego, inquam.\n\n      I do, certainly.\n\n_Arist._\n\n  Tun te Philocratem\n  esse ais?\n\n      You claim to be Philocrates, you?\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  Ego, inquam.\n\n      I certainly do.\n\n_Arist._\n\n  Tune huic credis?\n\n      (_to Hegio, exasperated_) Do you believe him?\n\n_Hegio_\n\n  Plus quidem quam tibi aut mihi.\n  nam ille quidem, quem tu hunc memoras esse, hodie hinc abiit Alidem\n  ad patrem huius.\n\n      More than I do you, surely,--or myself. For you see, the\n      fellow you tell me this man is--he went away to Elis to-day\n      to this man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father.\n\n_Arist._\n\n  Quem patrem, qui servos est?\n\n      (_contemptuously_) Father! What do you mean, when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\n      slave?\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  Et tu quidem\n  servos es, liber fuisti, et ego me confido fore,\n  si huius huc reconciliasso in libertatem filium.\n\n      Well, you, too, are a slave and once were free: and (_with\n      emphasis_) I hope to be so myself, when I have restored\n      this gentleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son to home and liberty.\n\n_Arist._\n\n  Quid ais, furcifer? tun te gnatum esse memoras liberum?\n\n      What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that, you villain? You tell me you were born a\n      freeman?\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  Non equidem me Liberum, sed Philocratem esse aio.\n\n      No indeed, my name is not Freeman, but Philocrates, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n      what I say.\n\n_Arist._\n\n  Quid est?\n  ut scelestus, Hegio, nunc iste te ludos facit.\n  nam is est servos ipse, neque praeter se umquam ei servos fuit.  580\n\n      What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all this? How the rascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s making game of you,\n      Hegio! Why he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a slave himself--the only one he ever had.\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  Quia tute ipse eges in patria nec tibi qui vivas domist,\n  omnis inveniri similis tui vis; non mirum facis:\n  est miserorum, ut malevolentes sint atque invideant bonis.\n\n      (_superior_) Just because you yourself are poverty-stricken\n      in your own country, with nothing at home to live on, you\n      want to have every one else put in the same list. There is\n      nothing strange in that: it is characteristic of poor\n      beggars to be ill-natured, and envy the well-to-do.\n\n_Arist._\n\n  Hegio, vide sis, ne quid tu huic temere insistas credere.\n  atque, ut perspicio, profecto iam aliquid pugnae edidit.\n  filium tuom quod redimere se ait, id ne utiquam mini placet.\n\n      Hegio, I beg you take care not to go on with your rash\n      confidence in this fellow. And for that matter, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n      certainly given you a fall or two already, I take it. This\n      talk of his about rescuing your son doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t please me at\n      all.\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  Scio te id nolle fieri; efficiam tamen ego id, si di adiuvant.\n  illum restituam huic, hic autem in Alidem me meo patri.\n  propterea ad patrem hinc amisi Tyndarum.\n\n      (_with an appealing look_) I know you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want it done;\n      but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bring it about, God helping me. (_slowly_) I will\n      restore his son to this gentleman, and then this gentleman\n      will send me back to Elis to my father. That was why I sent\n      Tyndarus off to my father.\n\n_Arist._\n\n  Quin tute is es:\n  neque praeter te in Alide ullus servos istoc nominest.           590\n\n      Why, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re Tyndarus yourself: and besides you there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a\n      slave in Elis of that name.\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  Pergin servom me exprobrare esse, id quod vi hostili optigit?\n\n      Still taunting me with being a slave, eh? A slave as it\n      happens, because the enemy were too much for us!\n\n_Arist._\n\n  Enim iam nequeo contineri.\n\n      (_angrily_) I positively can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t control myself any longer!\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  Heus, audin quid ait? quin fugis?\n  iam illic his nos insectabit lapidibus, nisi illunc iubes\n  comprehendi.\n\n      (_apparently alarmed, to Hegio_) Aha! Hear what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s saying?\n      Run, why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you? He\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be after us with stones in a\n      minute, if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have him seized.\n\n_Arist._\n\n  Crucior.\n\n      Oh, this is driving me wild!\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  Ardent oculi: fit opus, Hegio;\n  viden tu illi maculari corpus totum maculis luridis?\n  atra bilis agitat hominem.\n\n      His eyes are blazing! He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s having one, Hegio! See how his\n      whole body is covered with lurid spots? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s black fury\n      that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tormenting the fellow!\n\n_Arist._\n\n  At pol te, si hic sapiat senex,\n  pix atra agitet apud carnificem tuoque capiti inluceat.\n\n      Now, by the Lord, if this old gentleman did the wise thing,\n      it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s black pitch that would torment you at the\n      executioner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and light up that head of yours!\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  Iam deliramenta loquitur, laruae stimulant virum.\n  hercle qui, si hunc comprehendi iusseris, sapias magis.\n\n      Now he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got to the raving point! Evil spirits are hounding\n      the man, Hegio. Heavens! You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d do more wisely to have him\n      seized!\n\n_Arist._\n\n  Crucior, lapidem non habere me, ut illi mastigiae                600\n  cerebrum excutiam, qui me insanum verbis concinnat suis.\n\n      Oh, damnation! not to have a stone to knock out the brains\n      of this blackguard that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s driving me mad with his talk!\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  Audin lapidem quaeritare?\n\n      Hear that--looking for a stone!\n\n_Arist._\n\n  Solus te solum volo,\n  Hegio.\n\n      (_struggling to contain himself_) Hegio, I want a word with\n      you all alone.\n\n_Hegio_\n\n  Instinc loquere, si quid vis, procul tamen audiam.\n\n      (_timorously_) Say it from there, if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anything you\n      want--from away off there. I shall hear it all the same.\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  Namque edepol si adbites propius, os denasabit tibi\n  mordicus.\n\n      That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right, by Jove! for if you go any nearer, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bite\n      your nose off.\n\n_Arist._\n\n  Neque pol me insanum, Hegio, esse creduis\n  neque fuisse umquam, neque esse morbum quem istic autumat.\n  verum si quid metuis a me, iube me vinciri: volo,\n  dum istic itidem vinciatur.\n\n      Heavens and earth, Hegio! don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m insane, or that\n      I have, or ever had, the disease he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talking about.\n      However, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at all afraid of me, have me tied up. I\n      am willing, provided that fellow is tied up too.\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  Immo enim vero, Hegio,\n  istic, qui volt, vinciatur.\n\n      No indeed, Hegio, certainly not, tie up the fellow that\n      wants it.\n\n_Arist._\n\n  Tace modo. ego te, Philocrates\n  false, faciam ut verus hodie reperiare Tyndarus.                 610\n  quid mi abnutas?\n\n      You keep still, now! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll soon show you up, you false\n      Philocrates, for the real Tyndarus. (_Tyndarus makes signs\n      to him behind Hegio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back_) What, are you shaking your\n      head at me for?\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  Tibi ego abnuto?\n\n      I shaking my head at you?\n\n_Arist._\n\n  Quid agat, si absis longius?\n\n      (_to Hegio_) What would he do, if you were farther off?\n\n_Hegio_\n\n  Quid ais? quid si adeam hunc insanum?\n\n      See here, what if I should step up to this lunatic?\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  Nugas. ludificabitur,\n  garriet quoi neque pes umquam neque caput compareat.\n  ornamenta absunt: Aiacem, hunc cum vides, ipsum vides.\n\n      Ridiculous! He\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make a fool of you, jabbering something\n      without head or tail to it. Look at this fellow, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\n      looking at a regular Ajax[F]--all but the make-up.\n\n        [Footnote F: Another madman of Greek mythology.]\n\n_Hegio_\n\n  Nihili facio. tamen adibo.\n\n      I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care.

Now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m between the\n      axe and the altar, and what to do I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know.\n\n_Hegio_\n\n  Do tibi operam, Aristophontes, si quid est quod me velis.\n\n      I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m at your service, Aristophontes, if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anything you\n      want of me.\n\n_Arist._\n\n  Ex me audibis vera quae nunc falsa opinare, Hegio.\n  sed hoc primum, me expurigare tibi volo. me insaniam             620\n  neque tenere neque mi esse ullum morbum, nisi quod servio.\n  at ita me rex deorum atque hominum faxit patriae compotem,\n  ut istic Philocrates non magis est quam aut ego aut tu.\n\n      I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll show you, Hegio, that all this you take for a lie is\n      the truth. But first I want to clear myself with you, and\n      assure you that I am not insane, and have no affliction\n      except captivity. And now,--(_solemnly_) so may the King of\n      heaven and earth restore me to my native land,--that fellow\n      is no more Philocrates than you or I.\n\n_Hegio_\n\n  Eho dic mihi,\n  quis illic igitur est?\n\n      (_impressed_) Hey? Tell me, who is he then?\n\n_Arist._\n\n  Quem dudum dixi a principio tibi.\n  hoc si secus reperies, nullam causam dico quin mihi\n  et parentum et libertatis apud te deliquio siet.\n\n      The man I told you he was to begin with, a while ago. If you\n      find it otherwise, I make no objection to forfeiting my\n      parents and my liberty and staying here with you.\n\n_Hegio_\n\n  Quid tu ais?\n\n      (_to Tyndarus_) And you--what have you to say?\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  Me tuom esse servom et te meum erum.\n\n      (_urbanely_) That I am your servant, and that you are my\n      master.\n\n_Hegio_\n\n  Haud istuc rogo.\n  fuistin liber?\n\n      (_impatiently_) That isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m asking about. Were you a\n       freeman?\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  Fui.\n\n      I was.\n\n_Arist._\n\n  Enim vero non fuit, nugas agit.\n\n      He certainly was not. Absurd!\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  Qui tu scis? an tu fortasse fuisti meae matri obstetrix,\n  qui id tam audacter dicere audes?\n\n      (_superciliously_) How do you know? Or were you my mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n      midwife, perhaps, that you venture to speak with such\n      assurance on this point?\n\n_Arist._\n\n  Puerum te vidi puer.                                             630\n\n      I saw you when we were both boys.\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  At ego te video maior maiorem: em rursum tibi.\n  meam rem non cures, si recte facis. num ego curo tuam?\n\n      Well, I see you now we are both grown-ups. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one for\n      you! You wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meddle with my business, if you behaved\n      decently. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meddle with yours, do I?\n\n_Hegio_\n\n  Fuitne huic pater Thensaurochrysonicochrysides?\n\n      Wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t his father called Ducatsdoubloonsandpiecesofeightson?\n\n_Arist._\n\n  Non fuit, neque ego istuc nomen umquam audivi ante hunc diem\n  Philocrati Theodoromedes fuit pater.\n\n      No sir, he was not, and I never heard that name before\n      to-day. The father of Philocrates was Theodoromedes.\n\n_Tynd._\n\n  Pereo probe\n  quin quiescis? idie rectum cor meum, ac suspende te.\n  tu sussultas, ego miser vix asto prae formidine.\n\n      (_aside, dryly_) I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m jolly well done for. Stop your noise,\n      will you, heart? Go to the deuce, and be hanged to you!\n      Jumping up and down, while I, poor devil, can hardly stand\n      for fear!\n\n_Hegio_\n\n  Satin istuc mihi exquisitum est, fuisse hunc servom in Alide\n  neque esse hunc Philocratem?\n\n      Am I to take it as absolutely clear that this fellow was a\n      slave in Elis, that he is not Philocrates?\n\n_Arist_\n\n  Tam satis quam numquam hoc invenies secus.\n  sed ubi is nunc est?\n\n      So absolutely that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never find it to be anything\n      different.

Do, do, see if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not some mistake, though.\n\n_Arist._\n\n  Quin exploratum dico et provisum hoc tibi.\n\n      No, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure of my ground and fully informed in what I tell\n      you.\n\n_Hegio_\n\n  Certon?\n\n      You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re certain?\n\n_Arist._\n\n  Quin nihil, inquam, invenies magis hoc certo certus.\n  Philocrates iam inde usque amicus fuit mihi a puero puer.\n\n      You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never find a deader certainty than this, I assure\n      you.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":983,"split":"train"}
