{"ori_id":"677cda46d079c6df650914eda8d9da1dcda8bf8d","title":"Ted (film)","context":"Ted (film)\n In 1985, John Bennett is a lonely child living in Norwood, MA, a suburb of Boston, who wished for his new Christmas gift\u2014a large teddy bear named Ted\u2014to come to life and become his friend. The wish coincides with a shooting star and comes true; word spread and Ted was briefly a celebrity.\nIn 2012, John and Ted are still living in Boston, aged 35 and 27 respectively, and are still staunch companions enjoying a hedonistic life. John is dating 28-year-old, Lori Collins, who is from Pennsylvania. As their anniversary approaches, Lori hopes to marry John but feels he could not move forward with Ted around. John is hesitant against making Ted leave, but he is persuaded to act when they find Ted at home with four prostitutes.\nJohn finds Ted his own apartment and a job at a grocery store, where Ted begins dating his coworker Tami-Lynn. Lori learns that John has been skipping work\u2014using her as an excuse\u2014to continue to spend most of his time with Ted. Things start to come to a head when John and Lori are invited to a party put on by Lori's womanizing manager Rex, and Ted lures John away to a party at his apartment with the offer to meet Sam J. Jones, the star of their favorite film, Flash Gordon. Although John intends to stay only a few minutes, he gets caught up in the occasion. Lori finds John there and breaks up with him. John blames Ted for ruining his life and tells him to stay away.\nJohn and Ted confront each other about their ruined friendship and manage to reconcile after a violent brawl in John's hotel room. To repair John's relationship with Lori, Ted arranges with an old lover, singer Norah Jones, to help by having John express his love for Lori with a song during her concert, in which he does an off-key rendition of Rita Coolidge's Octopussy theme song, All Time High. Although John's performance proves to get him angrily and severely booed off the stage, Lori is touched by the attempt and returns to her apartment after being angered by Rex's sneering of him. Ted comes clean to Lori about his role in John's relapse and offers to leave them alone forever if she can talk to him. Lori is persuaded, but moments after she leaves, Ted is kidnapped by Donny, an obsessive stalker who idolized Ted as a child. Donny plans to make Ted the toy of his brutish son Robert. Ted distracts Robert and reaches a phone to contact John, but he is immediately recaptured. Realizing Ted is in danger, John and Lori locate Donny's residence and track him to rescue Ted. The chase leads to Fenway Park, where John punches Robert, but during the chase, Ted is damaged and falls onto the field ripped entirely in half. A police car arrives, forcing Donny to flee. As John and Lori gather Ted's stuffing, Ted relays his wish that John be happy with Lori, as the magic that gives him life fades away.\nUnable to accept Ted's death, a distraught John and Lori attempt to repair Ted, which proves useless. That night, Lori feels guilty about the incident, and makes a wish on a shooting star. The next morning, John hangs his head while looking over Ted's dead body. Fortunately, Ted is magically restored and after he tricks John into thinking he is physically\/mentally challenged, he and Lori fully reconcile with Ted, who encourages them to resume their relationship. With that resolution, John and Lori are married (with Sam Jones as the presiding minister), and Ted comfortably accepts having a life of his own as he and Tami-Lynn continued their torrid love affair. One afternoon, Ted was caught behind the deli counter eating potato salad off of Tami-Lynn's bare bottom. He was instantly promoted to store manager. Sam Jones attempts to restart his career and moves into a studio apartment with Brandon Routh. Rex gives up his pursuit of Lori, goes into a deep depression, and dies of Lou Gehrig's disease. Donny gets arrested by the Boston Police Department for kidnapping a plush toy, but the charges are dropped because they sound ridiculous. Robert hires a personal trainer, loses a significant amount of weight, and goes on to become Taylor Lautner.\n<html>\n<head><title>Ted Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Ted script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Ted script, Ted movie script, Ted film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

He has a couple\n          stains, some small spots of exposed stuffing, and there's\n          evidence of some half-assed sewing. It's obvious he's\n          been around for three decades. He and John, who sits\n          next to him, are both clearly stoned as we join them.\n          John, for his part, looks far too comfortable in the too-\n          worn Red Sox T-shirt he wears. He eats directly from a\n          box of Fruity Pebbles. Reaching in for a last handful,\n          he finds the box almost empty. He raises it to empty the\n          remainder into his mouth, and accidentally pours Fruity\n          Pebbles all over his face. It doesn't faze him much,\n          though, as he brushes them off. It's quite obvious that\n          this is a guy who has never really given up his\n          childhood... and has never given up his teddy bear.

John pulls free, and stumbles\n          backward off the bed. He notices a tall, free-standing\n          lamp in the corner. He pulls the plug out of the wall,\n          and uses the lamp to take a swing at Ted. Ted swings out\n          of the way. John takes a second swing, but the lamp cord\n          catches on the fan's motor. The lamp is ripped from\n          John's grasp, it swings around through the air, and\n          cracks him in the side of the head. John goes down,\n          whacking his head a second time on the baseboard of the\n          bed. He howls in pain as he lies on his stomach,\n          clutching his head. Ted takes advantage of this. He\n          jumps down from the cord, and pulls the antenna off the\n          clock radio next to the bed. He jumps down to the floor,\n          yanks John's pants partway down, and starts whipping his\n          bare ass with the antenna. John yells in fury, and kicks\n          blindly at Ted.
