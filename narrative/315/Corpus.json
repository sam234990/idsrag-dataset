He offers an exposition of the events leading up to this moment. He hails the arrival of Thanatos (Death), who, dressed in black and carrying a sword, has come to the palace in his role as psychopomp to lead Alcestis to the underworld. Thanatos challenges Apollo's apparent defense of Alcestis and accuses him of \"twisting slippery tricks\" when he helped Admetus cheat death in the first place. Apollo reassures him and, in a passage of swift stichomythic banter, proposes a postponement of Alcestis' death, which is sarcastically rebuffed. \"For once,\" Thanatos concludes, \"you may not have what is not yours.\" Defeated, Apollo leaves angrily, prophesying the arrival of a man (Heracles) who will wrestle Alcestis away from Death. Alone with the audience, Thanatos warns that \"this was a god of many words; but words \/ are not enough,\" before he summons the doors open with the tip of his sword and slowly enters the palace.\nThe entry of the chorus, or the \"parodos\" sequence, follows: a chorus of fifteen men of Pherae, led by a \"coryphaeus\" (chorus-leader), enter the orchestra of the theatre. The chorus-leader complains that they are in a state of suspense, ignorant of whether they ought to be performing mourning rituals for their queen. The chorus' lyrical ode, to which they dance as they sing, consists of two paired stanzas of strophe and antistrophe. They sing of the silence that greets their search for signs of mourning, the evidence of Alcestis' death. \"When goodness dies,\" they lament, \"all good men suffer, too.\" The chorus-leader concludes by dismissing the chorus' search for hope in the situation: \"The King has exhausted every ritual.\"\nThe first episode begins with a maidservant, who enters from the palace in tears. When the chorus-leader presses her for news, she gives a confusing response: \"She is alive. And dead.\" Alcestis stands, she explains, at this moment on the brink of life and death. The chorus-leader anxiously confirms that all of the customary preparations have been made for her proper burial. The maidservant joins the chorus-leader in praising Alcestis' virtue. She narrates a long description of Alcestis' prayers and preparations to die earlier that morning, when Alcestis cried over the bridal bed that will destroy her, embraced her sobbing children, and bade all farewell. She describes how Admetus held Alcestis weeping in his arms while her eyes clung to the sight of the last rays of sun she would see. The maidservant welcomes the chorus-leader to the palace and goes inside to inform Admetus of their arrival.\nAlcestis, on her death-bed, requests that in return for her sacrifice, Admetus never again marry, nor forget her or place a resentful stepmother in charge of their children. Admetus agrees to this and also promises to lead a life of solemnity in her honour, abstaining from the merrymaking that was an integral part of his household. Alcestis then dies.\nJust afterwards, Admetus' old friend Heracles arrives at the palace, having no idea of the sorrow that has befallen the place. Unwilling to turn a guest away, the king decides not to burden Heracles with the sad news and instructs the servants to make him welcome and to keep their mouths shut. By doing this, Admetus breaks his promise to Alcestis to abstain from merrymaking during the period that follows her death. Heracles gets drunk and begins to irritate the servants, who loved their queen and are bitter at not being allowed to mourn her properly. Finally, one of the servants snaps at the guest and tells him what has happened.\nHeracles is deeply embarrassed at his blunder and his bad behaviour and he decides to ambush and confront Death when the funerary sacrifices are made at Alcestis' tomb. When he returns, he brings with him a veiled woman whom he tells Admetus he has won in a competition. He asks his host to take her and look after her while Heracles is away on his labours. After much discussion, he finally forces a reluctant Admetus to take her by the hand, but when he lifts the veil, he finds that it appears to be Alcestis, back from the dead. Heracles has battled Death and forced him to give her up. She cannot speak for three days, after which she will be purified and fully restored to life.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Alcestis, by Euripides\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Yet it remains one of the most characteristic\nand delightful of Euripidean dramas, as well as, by modern standards, the\nmost easily actable. And I notice that many judges who display nothing but\na fierce satisfaction in sending other plays of that author to the block\nor the treadmill, show a certain human weakness in sentencing the gentle\ndaughter of Pelias.\n\nThe play has been interpreted in many different ways. There is the old\nunsophisticated view, well set forth in Paley's preface of 1872. He\nregards the _Alcestis_ simply as a triumph of pathos, especially of\n\"that peculiar sort of pathos which comes most home to us, with our views\nand partialities for domestic life.... As for the characters, that of\nAlcestis must be acknowledged to be pre-eminently beautiful. One could\nalmost imagine that Euripides had not yet conceived that bad opinion of\nthe sex which so many of the subsequent dramas exhibit.... But the rest\nare hardly well-drawn, or, at least, pleasingly portrayed.\" \"The poet\nmight perhaps, had he pleased, have exhibited Admetus in a more amiable\npoint of view.\"\n\nThis criticism is not very trenchant, but its weakness is due, I think,\nmore to timidity of statement than to lack of perception. Paley does see\nthat a character may be \"well-drawn\" without necessarily being \"pleasing\";\nand even that he may be eminently pleasing as a part of the play while\nvery displeasing in himself. He sees that Euripides may have had his own\nreasons for not making Admetus an ideal husband. It seems odd that such\npoints should need mentioning; but Greek drama has always suffered from a\nschool of critics who approach a play with a greater equipment of\naesthetic theory than of dramatic perception. This is the characteristic\ndefect of classicism. One mark of the school is to demand from dramatists\nheroes and heroines which shall satisfy its own ideals; and, though there\nwas in the New Comedy a mask known to Pollux as \"The Entirely-good Young\nMan\" ([Greek: panchraestos neaniskos]), such a character is fortunately\nunknown to classical Greek drama.\n\nThe influence of this \"classicist\" tradition has led to a timid and\nunsatisfying treatment of the _Alcestis_, in which many of the most\nstriking and unconventional features of the whole composition were either\nignored or smoothed away. As a natural result, various lively-minded\nreaders proceeded to overemphasize these particular features, and were\ncarried into eccentricity or paradox. Alfred Sch\u00c3\u00b6ne, for instance, fixing\nhis attention on just those points which the conventional critic passed\nover, decides simply that the _Alcestis_ is a parody, and finds it\nvery funny. (_Die Alkestis von Euripides_, Kiel, 1895.)\n\nI will not dwell on other criticisms of this type. There are those who\nhave taken the play for a criticism of contemporary politics or the\ncurrent law of inheritance. Above all there is the late Dr. Verrall's\nfamous essay in _Euripides the Rationalist_, explaining it as a\npsychological criticism of a supposed Delphic miracle, and arguing that\nAlcestis in the play does not rise from the dead at all. She had never\nreally died; she only had a sort of nervous catalepsy induced by all the\n\"suggestion\" of death by which she was surrounded. Now Dr. Verrall's work,\nas always, stands apart. Even if wrong, it has its own excellence, its\nspecial insight and its extraordinary awakening power. But in general the\neffect of reading many criticisms on the _Alcestis_ is to make a\nscholar realize that, for all the seeming simplicity of the play,\ncompetent Grecians have been strangely bewildered by it, and that after\nall there is no great reason to suppose that he himself is more sensible\nthan his neighbours.\n\nThis is depressing. None the less I cannot really believe that, if we make\npatient use of our available knowledge, the _Alcestis_ presents any\nstartling enigma. In the first place, it has long been known from the\nremnants of the ancient Didascalia, or official notice of production, that\nthe _Alcestis_ was produced as the fourth play of a series; that is,\nit took the place of a Satyr-play. It is what we may call Pro-satyric.\n(See the present writer's introduction to the _Rhesus_.) And we\nshould note for what it is worth the observation in the ancient Greek\nargument: \"The play is somewhat satyr-like ([Greek: saturiphkoteron]). It\nends in rejoicing and gladness against the tragic convention.\"\n\nNow we are of late years beginning to understand much better what a\nSatyr-play was. Satyrs have, of course, nothing to do with satire, either\netymologically or otherwise. Satyrs are the attendant daemons who form the\nK\u00c3\u00b4mos, or revel rout, of Dionysus. They are represented in divers\nfantastic forms, the human or divine being mixed with that of some animal,\nespecially the horse or wild goat. Like Dionysus himself, they are\nconnected in ancient religion with the Renewal of the Earth in spring and\nthe resurrection of the dead, a point which students of the\n_Alcestis_ may well remember. But in general they represent mere\njoyous creatures of nature, unthwarted by law and unchecked by\nself-control. Two notes are especially struck by them: the passions and\nthe absurdity of half-drunken revellers, and the joy and mystery of the\nwild things in the forest.\n\nThe rule was that after three tragedies proper there came a play, still in\ntragic diction, with a traditional saga plot and heroic characters, in\nwhich the Chorus was formed by these Satyrs. There was a deliberate clash,\nan effect of burlesque; but of course the clash must not be too brutal.\nCertain characters of the heroic saga are, so to speak, at home with\nSatyrs and others are not. To take our extant specimens of Satyr-plays,\nfor instance: in the _Cyclops_ we have Odysseus, the heroic\ntrickster; in the fragmentary _Ichneutae_ of Sophocles we have the\nNymph Cyllene, hiding the baby Hermes from the chorus by the most\nbarefaced and pleasant lying; later no doubt there was an entrance of the\ninfant thief himself. Autolycus, Sisyphus, Thersites are all Satyr-play\nheroes and congenial to the Satyr atmosphere; but the most congenial of\nall, the one hero who existed always in an atmosphere of Satyrs and the\nK\u00c3\u00b4mos until Euripides made him the central figure of a tragedy, was\nHeracles.\n[Footnote: The character of Heracles in connexion with the K\u00c3\u00b4mos, already\nindicated by Wilamowitz and Dieterich (_Herakles_, pp. 98, ff.;\n_Pulcinella_, pp. 63, ff.), has been illuminatingly developed in an\nunpublished monograph by Mr. J.A.K. Thomson, of Aberdeen.]\n\nThe complete Satyr-play had a hero of this type and a Chorus of Satyrs.\nBut the complete type was refined away during the fifth century; and one\nstage in the process produced a play with a normal chorus but with one\nfigure of the Satyric or \"revelling\" type. One might almost say the\n\"comic\" type if, for the moment, we may remember that that word is\ndirectly derived from 'K\u00c3\u00b4mos.'\n\nThe _Alcestis_ is a very clear instance of this Pro-satyric class of\nplay. It has the regular tragic diction, marked here and there (393,\n756, 780, etc.) by slight extravagances and forms of words which are\nsometimes epic and sometimes over-colloquial; it has a regular saga plot,\nwhich had already been treated by the old poet Phrynichus in his\n_Alcestis_, a play which is now lost but seems to have been Satyric;\nand it has one character straight from the Satyr world, the heroic\nreveller, Heracles. It is all in keeping that he should arrive tired,\nshould feast and drink and sing; should be suddenly sobered and should go\nforth to battle with Death. It is also in keeping that the contest should\nhave a half-grotesque and half-ghastly touch, the grapple amid the graves\nand the cracking ribs.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo much for the traditional form. As for the subject, Euripides received\nit from Phrynichus, and doubtless from other sources. We cannot be sure of\nthe exact form of the story in Phrynichus. But apparently it told how\nAdmetus, King of Pherae in Thessaly, received from Apollo a special\nprivilege which the God had obtained, in true Satyric style, by making the\nThree Fates drunk and cajoling them. This was that, when his appointed\ntime for death came, he might escape if he could find some volunteer to\ndie for him. His father and mother, from whom the service might have been\nexpected, refused to perform it. His wife, Alcestis, though no blood\nrelation, handsomely undertook it and died. But it so happened that\nAdmetus had entertained in his house the demi-god, Heracles; and when\nHeracles heard what had happened, he went out and wrestled with Death,\nconquered him, and brought Alcestis home.\n\nGiven this form and this story, the next question is: What did Euripides\nmake of them? The general answer is clear: he has applied his usual\nmethod. He accepts the story as given in the tradition, and then\nrepresents it in his own way. When the tradition in question is really\nheroic, we know what his way is. He preserves, and even emphasizes, the\nstateliness and formality of the Attic stage conventions; but, in the\nmeantime, he has subjected the story and its characters to a keener study\nand a more sensitive psychological judgment than the simple things were\noriginally meant to bear. So that many characters which passed as heroic,\nor at least presentable, in the kindly remoteness of legend, reveal some\nstrange weakness when brought suddenly into the light. When the tradition\nis Satyric, as here, the same process produces almost an opposite effect.\nIt is somewhat as though the main plot of a gross and jolly farce were\npondered over and made more true to human character till it emerged as a\nrefined and rather pathetic comedy. The making drunk of the Three Grey\nSisters disappears; one can only just see the trace of its having once\nbeen present. The revelling of Heracles is touched in with the lightest of\nhands; it is little more than symbolic. And all the figures in the story,\ninstead of being left broadly comic or having their psychology neglected,\nare treated delicately, sympathetically, with just that faint touch of\nsatire, or at least of amusement, which is almost inseparable from a close\ninterest in character.\n\nWhat was Admetus really like, this gallant prince who had won the\naffection of such great guests as Apollo and Heracles, and yet went round\nasking other people to die for him; who, in particular, accepted his\nwife's monstrous sacrifice with satisfaction and gratitude? The play\nportrays him well. Generous, innocent, artistic, affectionate, eloquent,\nimpulsive, a good deal spoilt, unconsciously insincere, and no doubt\nfundamentally selfish, he hates the thought of dying and he hates losing\nhis wife almost as much. Why need she die? Why could it not have been some\none less important to him? He feels with emotion what a beautiful act it\nwould have been for his old father. \"My boy, you have a long and happy\nlife before you, and for me the sands are well-nigh run out. Do not seek\nto dissuade me. I will die for you.\" Admetus could compose the speech for\nhim. A touching scene, a noble farewell, and all the dreadful trouble\nsolved--so conveniently solved! And the miserable self-blinded old man\ncould not see it!\n\nEuripides seems to have taken positive pleasure in Admetus, much as\nMeredith did in his famous Egoist; but Euripides all through is kinder to\nhis victim than Meredith is. True, Admetus is put to obvious shame,\npublicly and helplessly. The Chorus make discreet comments upon him.\nThe Handmaid is outspoken about him. One feels that Alcestis herself, for\nall her tender kindness, has seen through him. Finally, to make things\nquite clear, his old father fights him openly, tells him home-truth upon\nhome-truth, tears away all his protective screens, and leaves him with his\nself-respect in tatters. It is a fearful ordeal for Admetus, and, after\nhis first fury, he takes it well. He comes back from his wife's burial a\nchanged man. He says not much, but enough. \"I have done wrong. I have only\nnow learnt my lesson. I imagined I could save my happy life by forfeiting\nmy honour; and the result is that I have lost both.\" I think that a\ncareful reading of the play will show an almost continuous process of\nself-discovery and self-judgment in the mind of Admetus. He was a man who\nblinded himself with words and beautiful sentiments; but he was not\nthick-skinned or thick-witted. He was not a brute or a cynic. And I think\nhe did learn his lesson ... not completely and for ever, but as well as\nmost of us learn such lessons.\n\nThe beauty of Alcestis is quite untouched by the dramatist's keener\nanalysis. The strong light only increases its effect. Yet she is not by\nany means a mere blameless ideal heroine; and the character which\nEuripides gives her makes an admirable foil to that of Admetus. Where he\nis passionate and romantic, she is simple and homely. While he is still\nrefusing to admit the facts and beseeching her not to \"desert\" him, she in\na gentle but businesslike way makes him promise to take care of the\nchildren and, above all things, not to marry again. She could not possibly\ntrust Admetus's choice. She is sure that the step-mother would be unkind\nto the children. She might be a horror and beat them (l. 307). And when\nAdmetus has made a thrilling answer about eternal sorrow, and the\nsilencing of lyre and lute, and the statue who shall be his only bride,\nAlcestis earnestly calls the attention of witnesses to the fact that he\nhas sworn not to marry again. She is not an artist like Admetus. There is\npoetry in her, because poetry comes unconsciously out of deep feeling, but\nthere is no artistic eloquence. Her love, too, is quite different from\nhis. To him, his love for his wife and children is a beautiful thing, a\nsubject to speak and sing about as well as an emotion to feel. But her\nlove is hardly conscious. She does not talk about it at all. She is merely\nwrapped up in the welfare of certain people, first her husband and then he\nchildren. To a modern romantic reader her insistence that her husband\nshall not marry again seems hardly delicate. But she does not think about\nromance or delicacy. To her any neglect to ensure due protection for the\nchildren would be as unnatural as to refuse to die for her husband.\nIndeed, Professor J.L. Myres has suggested that care for the children's\nfuture is the guiding motive of her whole conduct. There was first the\ndanger of their being left fatherless, a dire calamity in the heroic age.\nShe could meet that danger by dying herself. Then followed the danger of a\nstepmother. She meets that by making Admetus swear never to marry. In the\nlong run, I fancy, the effect of gracious loveliness which Alcestis\ncertainly makes is not so much due to any words of her own as to what the\nHandmaid and the Serving Man say about her. In the final scene she is\nsilent; necessarily and rightly silent, for all tradition knows that those\nnew-risen from the dead must not speak. It will need a long _rite de\npassage_ before she can freely commune with this world again. It is a\nstrange and daring scene between the three of them; the humbled and\nbroken-hearted husband; the triumphant Heracles, kindly and wise, yet\nstill touched by the mocking and blustrous atmosphere from which he\nsprang; and the silent woman who has seen the other side of the grave.\nIt was always her way to know things but not to speak of them.\n\nThe other characters fall easily into their niches. We have only to\nremember the old Satyric tradition and to look at them in the light of\ntheir historical development. Heracles indeed, half-way on his road from\nthe roaring reveller of the Satyr-play to the suffering and erring\ndeliverer of tragedy, is a little foreign to our notions, but quite\nintelligible and strangely attractive. The same historical method seems to\nme to solve most of the difficulties which have been felt about Admetus's\nhospitality. Heracles arrives at the castle just at the moment when\nAlcestis is lying dead in her room; Admetus conceals the death from him\nand insists on his coming in and enjoying himself. What are we to think of\nthis behaviour? Is it magnificent hospitality, or is it gross want of\ntact? The answer, I think, is indicated above.\n\nIn the uncritical and boisterous atmosphere of the Satyr-play it was\nnatural hospitality, not especially laudable or surprising. From the\nanalogy of similar stories I suspect that Admetus originally did not know\nhis guest, and received not so much the reward of exceptional virtue as\nthe blessing naturally due to those who entertain angels unawares. If we\ninsist on asking whether Euripides himself, in real life or in a play of\nhis own free invention, would have considered Admetus's conduct to\nHeracles entirely praiseworthy, the answer will certainly be No, but it\nwill have little bearing on the play. In the _Alcestis_, as it stands, the\nfamous act of hospitality is a datum of the story. Its claims are admitted\non the strength of the tradition. It was the act for which Admetus was\nspecially and marvellously rewarded; therefore, obviously, it was an act\nof exceptional merit and piety. Yet the admission is made with a smile,\nand more than one suggestion is allowed to float across the scene that in\nreal life such conduct would be hardly wise.\n\nHeracles, who rose to tragic rank from a very homely cycle of myth, was\napt to bring other homely characters with him. He was a great killer not\nonly of malefactors but of \"k\u00c3\u00aares\" or bogeys, such as \"Old Age\" and \"Ague\"\nand the sort of \"Death\" that we find in this play. Thanatos is not a god,\nnot at all a King of Terrors. One may compare him with the dancing\nskeleton who is called Death in mediaeval writings. When such a figure\nappears on the tragic stage one asks at once what relation he bears to\nHades, the great Olympian king of the unseen. The answer is obvious.\nThanatos is the servant of Hades, a \"priest\" or sacrificer, who is sent to\nfetch the appointed victims.\n\nThe other characters speak for themselves. Certainly Pheres can be trusted\nto do so, though we must remember that we see him at an unfortunate\nmoment. The aged monarch is not at his best, except perhaps in mere\nfighting power. I doubt if he was really as cynical as he here professes\nto be.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the above criticisms I feel that I may have done what critics are so\napt to do. I have dwelt on questions of intellectual interest and perhaps\nthereby diverted attention from that quality in the play which is the most\nimportant as well as by far the hardest to convey; I mean the sheer beauty\nand delightfulness of the writing. It is the earliest dated play of\nEuripides which has come down to us. True, he was over forty when he\nproduced it, but it is noticeably different from the works of his old age.\nThe numbers are smoother, the thought less deeply scarred, the language\nmore charming and less passionate. If it be true that poetry is bred out\nof joy and sorrow, one feels as if more enjoyment and less suffering had\ngone to the making of the _Alcestis_ than to that of the later plays.\n\n\n\n\nALCESTIS\n\n\n\nCHARACTERS OF THE PLAY\n\n\nADM\u00c3\u008aTUS, _King of Pherae in Thessaly_.\nALCESTIS, _daughter of Pelias, his wife_.\nPHER\u00c3\u008aS, _his father, formerly King but now in retirement_.\nTWO CHILDREN, _his son and daughter_.\nA MANSERVANT _in his house_.\nA HANDMAID.\n\nThe Hero HERACLES.\nThe God APOLLO.\nTHAN\u00c3\u0081TOS _or_ DEATH.\nCHORUS, _consisting of Elders of Pherae_.\n\n\n\"_The play was first performed when Glauk\u00c3\u00aenos was Archon, in the 2nd\nyear of the 85th Olympiad_ (438 B.C.). _Sophocles was first,\nEuripides second with the Cretan Women, Alcmaeon in Psophis, Telephus and\nAlcestis....

Thy threats shall win no bride\nFrom me.--This woman, whatsoe'er betide,\nShall lie in Hades' house. Even at the word\nI go to lay upon her hair my sword.\nFor all whose head this grey sword visiteth\nTo death are hallowed and the Lords of death.\n\n [THANATOS _goes into the house. Presently, as the day grows lighter,\nthe_ CHORUS _enters: it consists of Citizens of Pherae, who speak\nseverally._]\n\n\nCHORUS.\n\nLEADER.\nQuiet, quiet, above, beneath!\n\nSECOND ELDER.\nThe house of Admetus holds its breath.\n\nTHIRD ELDER.\nAnd never a King's friend near,\nTo tell us either of tears to shed\nFor Pelias' daughter, crowned and dead;\n  Or joy, that her eyes are clear.\nBravest, truest of wives is she\nThat I have seen or the world shall see.\n\nDIVERS CITIZENS, _conversing_.\n(The dash -- indicates a new speaker.)\n\n--Hear ye no sob, or noise of hands\n    Beating the breast? No mourners' cries\n      For one they cannot save?\n--Nothing: and at the door there stands\n    No handmaid.--Help, O Paian; rise,\n      O star beyond the wave!\n\n--Dead, and this quiet? No, it cannot be.\n--Dead, dead!--Not gone to burial secretly!\n\n--Why? I still fear: what makes your speech so brave?\n--Admetus cast that dear wife to the grave\n      Alone, with none to see?\n\n--I see no bowl of clear spring water.\n    It ever stands before the dread\n      Door where a dead man rests.\n--No lock of shorn hair! Every daughter\n    Of woman shears it for the dead.\n      No sound of bruis\u00c3\u00a8d breasts!\n\n--Yet 'tis this very day ...--This very day?\n--The Queen should pass and lie beneath the clay.\n--It hurts my life, my heart!--All honest hearts\n  Must sorrow for a brightness that departs,\n      A good life worn away.\n\nLEADER.\nTo wander o'er leagues of land,\n  To search over wastes of sea,\nWhere the Prophets of Lycia stand,\n  Or where Ammon's daughters three\nMake runes in the rainless sand,\n  For magic to make her free--\n    Ah, vain! for the end is here;\n    Sudden it comes and sheer.\nWhat lamb on the altar-strand\n  Stricken shall comfort me?\n\nSECOND ELDER.\nOnly, only one, I know:\n  Apollo's son was he,\nWho healed men long ago.\n  Were he but on earth to see,\nShe would rise from the dark below\n  And the gates of eternity.\n    For men whom the Gods had slain\n    He pitied and raised again;\nTill God's fire laid him low,\nAnd now, what help have we?\n\nOTHERS.\nAll's done that can be. Every vow\nFull paid; and every altar's brow\n  Full crowned with spice of sacrifice.\nNo help remains nor respite now.\n\n_Enter from the Castle a_ HANDMAID, _almost in tears._\n\nLEADER.\nBut see, a handmaid cometh, and the tear\nWet on her cheek! What tiding shall we hear?...\n  Thy grief is natural, daughter, if some ill\nHath fallen to-day. Say, is she living still\nOr dead, your mistress? Speak, if speak you may.\n\nMAID.\nAlive. No, dead.... Oh, read it either way.\n\nLEADER.\nNay, daughter, can the same soul live and die?\n\nMAID.\nHer life is broken; death is in her eye.\n\nLEADER.\nPoor King, to think what she was, and what thou!\n\nMAID.\nHe never knew her worth.... He will know it now.\n\nLEADER.\nThere is no hope, methinks, to save her still?\n\nMAID.\nThe hour is come, and breaks all human will.\n\nLEADER.\nShe hath such tendance as the dying crave?\n\nMAID.\nFor sure: and rich robes ready for her grave.\n\nLEADER.\n'Fore God, she dies high-hearted, aye, and far\nIn honour raised above all wives that are!\n\nMAID.\nFar above all! How other? What must she,\nWho seeketh to surpass this woman, be?\nOr how could any wife more shining make\nHer lord's love, than by dying for his sake?\nBut thus much all the city knows. 'Tis here,\nIn her own rooms, the tale will touch thine ear\nWith strangeness. When she knew the day was come,\nShe rose and washed her body, white as foam,\nWith running water; then the cedarn press\nShe opened, and took forth her funeral dress\nAnd rich adornment. So she stood arrayed\nBefore the Hearth-Fire of her home, and prayed:\n\"Mother, since I must vanish from the day,\nThis last, last time I kneel to thee and pray;\nBe mother to my two children! Find some dear\nHelpmate for him, some gentle lord for her.\nAnd let not them, like me, before their hour\nDie; let them live in happiness, in our\nOld home, till life be full and age content.\"\n  To every household altar then she went\nAnd made for each his garland of the green\nBoughs of the wind-blown myrtle, and was seen\nPraying, without a sob, without a tear.\nShe knew the dread thing coming, but her clear\nCheek never changed: till suddenly she fled\nBack to her own chamber and bridal bed:\nThen came the tears and she spoke all her thought.\n  \"O bed, whereon my laughing girlhood's knot\nWas severed by this man, for whom I die,\nFarewell! 'Tis thou ... I speak not bitterly....\n'Tis thou hast slain me. All alone I go\nLest I be false to him or thee. And lo,\nSome woman shall lie here instead of me--\nHappier perhaps; more true she cannot be.\"\n  She kissed the pillow as she knelt, and wet\nWith flooding tears was that fair coverlet.\n  At last she had had her fill of weeping; then\nShe tore herself away, and rose again,\nWalking with downcast eyes; yet turned before\nShe had left the room, and cast her down once more\nKneeling beside the bed. Then to her side\nThe children came, and clung to her and cried,\nAnd her arms hugged them, and a long good-bye\nShe gave to each, like one who goes to die.\nThe whole house then was weeping, every slave\nIn sorrow for his mistress. And she gave\nHer hand to all; aye, none so base was there\nShe gave him not good words and he to her.\n  So on Admetus falls from either side\nSorrow. 'Twere bitter grief to him to have died\nHimself; and being escaped, how sore a woe\nHe hath earned instead--Ah, some day he shall know!\n\nLEADER.\nSurely Admetus suffers, even to-day,\nFor this true-hearted love he hath cast away?\n\nMAID.\nHe weeps; begs her not leave him desolate,\nAnd holds her to his heart--too late, too late!\nShe is sinking now, and there, beneath his eye\nFading, the poor cold hand falls languidly,\nAnd faint is all her breath. Yet still she fain\nWould look once on the sunlight--once again\nAnd never more. I will go in and tell\nThy presence. Few there be, will serve so well\nMy master and stand by him to the end.\nBut thou hast been from olden days our friend.\n                            [_The_ MAID _goes in_.]\n\nCHORUS.\n\nTHIRD ELDER.\n    O Zeus,\nWhat escape and where\n  From the evil thing?\nHow break the snare\n  That is round our King?\n\nSECOND ELDER.\n    Ah list!\nOne cometh?... No.\n  Let us no more wait;\n    Make dark our raiment\n      And shear this hair.\n\nLEADER.\n    Aye, friends!\n'Tis so, even so.\n  Yet the gods are great\n    And may send allayment.\n      To prayer, to prayer!\n\nALL (_praying_).\n      O Paian wise!\nSome healing of this home devise, devise!\nFind, find.... Oh, long ago when we were blind\n  Thine eyes saw mercy ... find some healing breath!\nAgain, O Paian, break the chains that bind;\n  Stay the red hand of Death!\n\nLEADER.\n    Alas!\nWhat shame, what dread,\n  Thou Pheres' son,\nShalt be harvested\n  When thy wife is gone!\n\nSECOND ELDER.\n    Ah me;\nFor a deed less drear\n  Than this thou ruest\n    Men have died for sorrow;\n      Aye, hearts have bled.\n\nTHIRD ELDER.\n    'Tis she;\nNot as men say dear,\n  But the dearest, truest,\n    Shall lie ere morrow\n      Before thee dead!\n\nALL.\n    But lo! Once more!\nShe and her husband moving to the door!\nCry, cry! And thou, O land of Pherae, hearken!\n  The bravest of women sinketh, perisheth,\nUnder the green earth, down where the shadows darken,\n  Down to the House of Death!\n\n[_During the last words_ ADMETUS _and_ ALCESTIS _have entered_.\nALCESTIS _is supported by her Handmaids and followed by her\ntwo children._]\n\nLEADER.\nAnd who hath said that Love shall bring\n  More joy to man than fear and strife?\nI knew his perils from of old,\nI know them now, when I behold\n  The bitter faring of my King,\nWhose love is taken, and his life\n  Left evermore an empty thing.\n\nALCESTIS.\n  O Sun, O light of the day that falls!\nO running cloud that races along the sky!\n\nADMETUS.\nThey look on thee and me, a stricken twain,\nWho have wrought no sin that God should have thee slain.\n\nALCESTIS.\n  Dear Earth, and House of sheltering walls,\nAnd wedded homes of the land where my fathers lie!\n\nADMETUS.\nFail not, my hapless one. Be strong, and pray\nThe o'er-mastering Gods to hate us not alway.\n\nALCESTIS (_faintly, her mind wandering_).\nA boat two-oared, upon water; I see, I see.\n  And the Ferryman of the Dead,\nHis hand that hangs on the pole, his voice that cries;\n\"Thou lingerest; come. Come quickly, we wait for thee.\"\n  He is angry that I am slow; he shakes his head.\n\nADMETUS.\nAlas, a bitter boat-faring for me,\nMy bride ill-starred.--Oh, this is misery!\n\nALCESTIS (_as before_).\nDrawing, drawing! 'Tis some one that draweth me ...\n  To the Palaces of the Dead.\nSo dark. The wings, the eyebrows and ah, the eyes!...\n  Go back! God's mercy! What seekest thou? Let me be!...\n(_Recovering_) Where am I? Ah, and what paths are these I tread?\n\nADMETUS.\nGrievous for all who love thee, but for me\nAnd my two babes most hard, most solitary.\n\nALCESTIS.\n  Hold me not; let me lie.--\nI am too weak to stand; and Death is near,\nAnd a slow darkness stealing on my sight.\n  My little ones, good-bye.\nSoon, soon, and mother will be no more here....\nGood-bye, two happy children in the light.\n\nADMETUS.\nOh, word of pain, oh, sharper ache\n  Than any death of mine had brought!\n  For the Gods' sake, desert me not,\nFor thine own desolate children's sake.\nNay, up! Be brave. For if they rend\n  Thee from me, I can draw no breath;\n  In thy hand are my life and death,\nThine, my belov\u00c3\u00a8d and my friend!\n\nALCESTIS.\nAdmetus, seeing what way my fortunes lie,\nI fain would speak with thee before I die.\nI have set thee before all things; yea, mine own\nLife beside thine was naught. For this alone\nI die.... Dear Lord, I never need have died.\nI might have lived to wed some prince of pride,\nDwell in a king's house.... Nay, how could I, torn\nFrom thee, live on, I and my babes forlorn?\nI have given to thee my youth--not more nor less,\nBut all--though I was full of happiness.\nThy father and mother both--'tis strange to tell--\nHad failed thee, though for them the deed was well,\nThe years were ripe, to die and save their son,\nThe one child of the house: for hope was none,\nIf thou shouldst pass away, of other heirs.\nSo thou and I had lived through the long years,\nBoth. Thou hadst not lain sobbing here alone\nFor a dead wife and orphan babes.... 'Tis done\nNow, and some God hath wrought out all his will.\n  Howbeit I now will ask thee to fulfill\nOne great return-gift--not so great withal\nAs I have given, for life is more than all;\nBut just and due, as thine own heart will tell.\nFor thou hast loved our little ones as well\nAs I have.... Keep them to be masters here\nIn my old house; and bring no stepmother\nUpon them. She might hate them. She might be\nSome baser woman, not a queen like me,\nAnd strike them with her hand. For mercy, spare\nOur little ones that wrong. It is my prayer....\nThey come into a house: they are all strife\nAnd hate to any child of the dead wife....\n  Better a serpent than a stepmother!\nA boy is safe. He has his father there\nTo guard him. But a little girl! (_Taking the_ LITTLE GIRL\n  _to her_) What good\nAnd gentle care will guide thy maidenhood?\nWhat woman wilt thou find at father's side?\nOne evil word from her, just when the tide\nOf youth is full, would wreck thy hope of love.\nAnd no more mother near, to stand above\nThy marriage-bed, nor comfort thee pain-tossed\nIn travail, when one needs a mother most!\nSeeing I must die.... 'Tis here, across my way,\nNot for the morrow, not for the third day,\nBut now--Death, and to lie with things that were.\n  Farewell. God keep you happy.--Husband dear,\nRemember that I failed thee not; and you,\nMy children, that your mother loved you true.\n\nLEADER.\nTake comfort. Ere thy lord can speak, I swear,\nIf truth is in him, he will grant thy prayer.\n\nADMETUS.\nHe will, he will! Oh, never fear for me.\nMine hast thou been, and mine shalt ever be,\nLiving and dead, thou only. None in wide\nHellas but thou shalt be Admetus' bride.\nNo race so high, no face so magic-sweet\nShall ever from this purpose turn my feet.\nAnd children ... if God grant me joy of these,\n'Tis all I ask; of thee no joy nor ease\nHe gave me. And thy mourning I will bear\nNot one year of my life but every year,\nWhile life shall last.... My mother I will know\nNo more. My father shall be held my foe.\nThey brought the words of love but not the deed,\nWhile thou hast given thine all, and in my need\nSaved me. What can I do but weep alone,\nAlone alway, when such a wife is gone?...\n  An end shall be of revel, and an end\nOf crowns and song and mirth of friend with friend,\nWherewith my house was glad. I ne'er again\nWill touch the lute nor ease my heart from pain\nWith pipes of Afric. All the joys I knew,\nAnd joys were many, thou hast broken in two.\nOh, I will find some artist wondrous wise\nShall mould for me thy shape, thine hair, thine eyes,\nAnd lay it in thy bed; and I will lie\nClose, and reach out mine arms to thee, and cry\nThy name into the night, and wait and hear\nMy own heart breathe: \"Thy love, thy love is near.\"\nA cold delight; yet it might ease the sum\nOf sorrow.... And good dreams of thee will come\nLike balm. 'Tis sweet, even in a dream, to gaze\nOn a dear face, the moment that it stays.\n  O God, if Orpheus' voice were mine, to sing\nTo Death's high Virgin and the Virgin's King,\nTill their hearts failed them, down would I my path\nCleave, and naught stay me, not the Hound of Wrath,\nNot the grey oarsman of the ghostly tide,\nTill back to sunlight I had borne my bride.\n  But now, wife, wait for me till I shall come\nWhere thou art, and prepare our second home.\nThese ministers in that same cedar sweet\nWhere thou art laid will lay me, feet to feet,\nAnd head to head, oh, not in death from thee\nDivided, who alone art true to me!\n\nLEADER.\nThis life-long sorrow thou hast sworn, I too,\nThy friend, will bear with thee. It is her due.\n\nALCESTIS.\nChildren, ye heard his promise? He will wed\nNo other woman nor forget the dead.\n\nADMETUS.\nAgain I promise. So it shall be done.\n\nALCESTIS (_giving the children into his arms one after the other_).\nOn that oath take my daughter: and my son.\n\nADMETUS.\nDear hand that gives, I accept both gift and vow.\n\nALCESTIS.\nThou, in my place, must be their mother now.\n\nADMETUS.\nElse were they motherless--I needs must try.\n\nALCESTIS.\nMy babes, I ought to live, and lo, I die.\n\nADMETUS.\nAnd how can I, forlorn of thee, live on?\n\nALCESTIS.\nTime healeth; and the dead are dead and gone.\n\nADMETUS.\nOh, take me with thee to the dark below,\nMe also!\n\nALCESTIS.\n         'Tis enough that one should go.\n\nADMETUS.\nO Fate, to have cheated me of one so true!\n\nALCESTIS (_her strength failing_).\nThere comes a darkness: a great burden, too.\n\nADMETUS.\nI am lost if thou wilt leave me.... Wife! Mine own!\n\nALCESTIS.\nI am not thy wife; I am nothing. All is gone.\n\nADMETUS.\nThy babes! Thou wilt not leave them.--Raise thine eye.\n\nALCESTIS.\nI am sorry.... But good-bye, children; good-bye.\n\nADMETUS.\nLook at them! Wake and look at them!\n\n\nALCESTIS.\n                                      I must go.\n\nADMETUS.\nWhat? Dying!\n\nALCESTIS.\n             Farewell, husband!     [_She dies._]\n\nADMETUS (_with a cry_).\n                                 Ah!...

It is I, your little bird.\n\nADMETUS (_recovering himself and going to the Child_).\nShe hears us not, she sees us not. We lie\nUnder a heavy grief, child, thou and I.\n\nLITTLE BOY.\nI am so little, Father, and lonely and cold\n  Here without Mother. It is too hard.... And you,\n    Poor little sister, too.\n        Oh, Father!\nSuch a little time we had her.

The thought hath poisoned all my years.\n  Howbeit, I now will make the burial due\nTo this dead Queen.

Unlock the furthest line\nOf guest-chambers; and bid the stewards there\nMake ready a full feast; then close with care\nThe midway doors. 'Tis unmeet, if he hears\nOur turmoil or is burdened with our tears.\n\n[_The Attendant leads_ HERACLES _into the house_.]\n\nLEADER.\nHow, master? When within a thing so sad\nLies, thou wilt house a stranger? Art thou mad?\n\nADMETUS.\nAnd had I turned the stranger from my door,\nWho sought my shelter, hadst thou praised me more?\nI trow not, if my sorrow were thereby\nNo whit less, only the more friendless I.\nAnd more, when bards tell tales, were it not worse\nMy house should lie beneath the stranger's curse?\nNow he is my sure friend, if e'er I stand\nLonely in Argos, in a thirsty land.\n\nLEADER.\nThou callest him thy friend; how didst thou dare\nKeep hid from him the burden of thy care?\n\nADMETUS.\nHe never would have entered, had he known\nMy grief.--Aye, men may mock what I have done,\nAnd call me fool. My house hath never learned\nTo fail its friend, nor seen the stranger spurned.\n\n[ADMETUS _goes into the house_]\n\nCHORUS.\nOh, a House that loves the stranger,\n  And a House for ever free!\nAnd Apollo, the Song-changer,\n  Was a herdsman in thy fee;\n    Yea, a-piping he was found,\n    Where the upward valleys wound,\nTo the kine from out the manger\n  And the sheep from off the lea,\n    And love was upon Othrys at the sound.\n\nAnd from deep glens unbeholden\n  Of the forest to his song\nThere came lynxes streaky-golden,\n  There came lions in a throng,\n    Tawny-coated, ruddy-eyed,\n    To that piper in his pride;\nAnd shy fawns he would embolden,\n  Dappled dancers, out along\n    The shadow by the pine-tree's side.\n\nAnd those magic pipes a-blowing\n  Have fulfilled thee in thy reign\nBy thy Lake with honey flowing,\n  By thy sheepfolds and thy grain;\n    Where the Sun turns his steeds\n    To the twilight, all the meads\nOf Molossus know thy sowing\n  And thy ploughs upon the plain.\n    Yea, and eastward thou art free\n    To the portals of the sea,\nAnd Pelion, the unharboured, is but minister to thee.\n\n  He hath opened wide his dwelling\n    To the stranger, though his ruth\n  For the dead was fresh and welling,\n    For the loved one of his youth.\n      'Tis the brave heart's cry:\n      \"I will fail not, though I die!\"\n  Doth it win, with no man's telling,\n    Some high vision of the truth?\n      We may marvel. Yet I trust,\n      When man seeketh to be just\nAnd to pity them that wander, God will raise him from the dust.\n\n[_As the song ceases the doors are thrown open and_ ADMETUS _comes\nbefore them: a great funeral procession is seen moving out._]\n\nADMETUS.\nMost gentle citizens, our dead is here\nMade ready; and these youths to bear the bier\nUplifted to the grave-mound and the urn.\nNow, seeing she goes forth never to return,\nBid her your last farewell, as mourners may.\n\n[_The procession moves forward, past him_.]\n\nLEADER.\nNay, lord; thy father, walking old and grey;\nAnd followers bearing burial gifts and brave\nGauds, which men call the comfort of the grave.\n\n_Enter_ PHERES _with followers bearing robes and gifts_.\n\nPHERES.\nI come in sorrow for thy sorrow, son.\nA faithful wife indeed thou hast lost, and one\nWho ruled her heart. But, howso hard they be,\nWe needs must bear these griefs.--Some gifts for thee\nAre here.... Yes; take them. Let them go beneath\nThe sod. We both must honour her in death,\nSeeing she hath died, my son, that thou mayst live\nNor I be childless. Aye, she would not give\nMy soul to a sad old age, mourning for thee.\nMethinks she hath made all women's life to be\nA nobler thing, by one great woman's deed.\n  Thou saviour of my son, thou staff in need\nTo our wrecked age, farewell! May some good life\nBe thine still in the grave.--Oh, 'tis a wife\nLike this man needs; else let him stay unwed!\n\n[_The old man has not noticed_ ADMETUS'S _gathering\nindignation_.]\n\nADMETUS.\nI called not thee to burial of my dead,\nNor count thy presence here a welcome thing.\nMy wife shall wear no robe that thou canst bring,\nNor needs thy help in aught. There was a day\nWe craved thy love, when I was on my way\nDeathward--thy love, which bade thee stand aside\nAnd watch, grey-bearded, while a young man died!\nAnd now wilt mourn for her? Thy fatherhood!\nThou wast no true begetter of my blood,\nNor she my mother who dares call me child.\nOh, she was barren ever; she beguiled\nThy folly with some bastard of a thrall.\nHere is thy proof! This hour hath shown me all\nThou art; and now I am no more thy son.\n  'Fore God, among all cowards can scarce be one\nLike thee. So grey, so near the boundary\nOf mortal life, thou wouldst not, durst not, die\nTo save thy son! Thou hast suffered her to do\nThine office, her, no kin to me nor you,\nYet more than kin! Henceforth she hath all the part\nOf mother, yea, and father in my heart.\n  And what a glory had been thine that day,\nDying to save thy son--when, either way,\nThy time must needs be brief. Thy life has had\nAbundance of the things that make men glad;\nA crown that came to thee in youth; a son\nTo do thee worship and maintain thy throne--\nNot like a childless king, whose folk and lands\nLie helpless, to be torn by strangers' hands.\n  Wilt say I failed in duty to thine age;\nFor that thou hast let me die? Not so; most sage,\nMost pious I was, to mother and to thee;\nAnd thus ye have paid me! Well, I counsel ye.\nLose no more time. Get quick another son\nTo foster thy last years, to lay thee on\nThy bier, when dead, and wrap thee in thy pall.\n_I_ will not bury thee. I am, for all\nThe care thou hast shown me, dead. If I have found\nAnother, true to save me at the bound\nOf life and death, that other's child am I,\nThat other's fostering friend, until I die.\n  How falsely do these old men pray for death,\nCursing their weight of years, their weary breath!\nWhen Death comes close, there is not one that dares\nTo die; age is forgot and all its cares.\n\nLEADER.\nOh, peace! Enough of sorrow in our path\nIs strewn. Thou son, stir not thy father's wrath.\n\nPHERES.\nMy son, whom seekest thou ... some Lydian thrall,\nOr Phrygian, bought with cash?... to affright withal\nBy cursing? I am a Thessalian, free,\nMy father a born chief of Thessaly;\nAnd thou most insolent. Yet think not so\nTo fling thy loud lewd words at me and go.\n  I got thee to succeed me in my hall,\nI have fed thee, clad thee. But I have no call\nTo die for thee. Not in our family,\nNot in all Greece, doth law bid fathers die\nTo save their sons. Thy road of life is thine\nNone other's, to rejoice at or repine.\nAll that was owed to thee by us is paid.\nMy throne is thine. My broad lands shall be made\nThine, as I had them from my father.... Say,\nHow have I wronged thee? What have I kept away?\n\"Not died for thee?\"... I ask not thee to die.\n  Thou lovest this light: shall I not love it, I?...\n'Tis age on age there, in the dark; and here\nMy sunlit time is short, but dear; but dear.\n  Thou hast fought hard enough. Thou drawest breath\nEven now, long past thy portioned hour of death,\nBy murdering her ... and blamest my faint heart,\nCoward, who hast let a woman play thy part\nAnd die to save her pretty soldier! Aye,\nA good plan, surely! Thou needst never die;\nThou canst find alway somewhere some fond wife\nTo die for thee. But, prithee, make not strife\nWith other friends, who will not save thee so.\nBe silent, loving thine own life, and know\nAll men love theirs!... Taunt others, and thou too\nShalt hear much that is bitter, and is true.\n\nLEADER.\nToo much of wrath before, too much hath run\nAfter. Old man, cease to revile thy son.\n\nADMETUS.\nSpeak on. I have spoken.... If my truth of tongue\nGives pain to thee, why didst thou do me wrong?\n\nPHERES.\nWrong? To have died for thee were far more wrong.\n\nADMETUS.\nHow can an old life weigh against a young?\n\nPHERES.\nMan hath but one, not two lives, to his use.\n\nADMETUS.\nOh, live on; live, and grow more old than Zeus!\n\nPHERES.\nBecause none wrongs thee, thou must curse thy sire?\n\nADMETUS.\nI blest him. Is not life his one desire?\n\nPHERES.\nThis dead, methinks, is lying in _thy_ place.\n\nADMETUS.\nA proof, old traitor, of thy cowardliness!\n\nPHERES.\nDied she through me?... That thou wilt hardly say.\n\nADMETUS (_almost breaking down_).\nO God!\nMayst thou but feel the need of me some day!\n\nPHERES.\nGo forward; woo more wives that more may die.\n\nADMETUS.\nAs thou wouldst not! Thine is the infamy.\n\nPHERES.\nThis light of heaven is sweet, and sweet again.\n\nADMETUS.\nThy heart is foul. A thing unmeet for men.\n\nPHERES.\nThou laugh'st not yet across the old man's tomb.\n\nADMETUS.\nDishonoured thou shalt die when death shall come.\n\nPHERES.\nOnce dead, I shall not care what tales are told.\n\nADMETUS.\nGreat Gods, so lost to honour and so old!\n\nPHERES.\nShe was not lost to honour: she was blind.\n\nADMETUS.\nGo! Leave me with my dead.... Out from my mind!\n\nPHERES.\nI go. Bury the woman thou hast slain....\nHer kinsmen yet may come to thee with plain\nQuestion. Acastus hath small place in good\nMen, if he care not for his sister's blood.\n\n[PHERES _goes off, with his Attendants_. ADMETUS _calls after him\nas he goes._]\n\nADMETUS.\nBegone, begone, thou and thy bitter mate!\nBe old and childless--ye have earned your fate--\nWhile your son lives! For never shall ye be\nFrom henceforth under the same roof with me....\nMust I send heralds and a trumpet's call\nTo abjure thy blood? Fear not, I will send them all....\n\n[PHERES _is now out of sight;_ ADMETUS _drops his defiance and\nseems like a broken man._]\n\nBut we--our sorrow is upon us; come\nWith me, and let us bear her to the tomb.\n\nCHORUS.\n        Ah me!\nFarewell, unfalteringly brave!\n  Farewell, thou generous heart and true!\n  May Pluto give thee welcome due,\nAnd Hermes love thee in the grave.\nWhate'er of bless\u00c3\u00a8d life there be\n  For high souls to the darkness flown,\n  Be thine for ever, and a throne\nBeside the crowned Persephon\u00c3\u00aa.\n\n[_The funeral procession has formed and moves slowly out, followed\nby_ ADMETUS _and the_ CHORUS. _The stage is left empty, till a\nside door of the Castle opens and there comes out a_ SERVANT, _angry\nand almost in tears._]\n\nSERVANT.\nFull many a stranger and from many a land\nHath lodged in this old castle, and my hand\nServed them; but never has there passed this way\nA scurvier ruffian than our guest to-day.\nHe saw my master's grief, but all the more\nIn he must come, and shoulders through the door.\nAnd after, think you he would mannerly\nTake what was set before him? No, not he!\nIf, on this day of trouble, we left out\nSome small thing, he must have it with a shout.\nUp, in both hands, our vat of ivy-wood\nHe raised, and drank the dark grape's burning blood,\nStrong and untempered, till the fire was red\nWithin him; then put myrtle round his head\nAnd roared some noisy song. So had we there\nDiscordant music. He, without a care\nFor all the affliction of Admetus' halls,\nSang on; and, listening, one could hear the thralls\nIn the long gallery weeping for the dead.\n  We let him see no tears. Our master made\nThat order, that the stranger must not know.\n  So here I wait in her own house, and do\nService to some black thief, some man of prey;\nAnd she has gone, has gone for ever away.\nI never followed her, nor lifted high\nMy hand to bless her; never said good-bye....\nI loved her like my mother. So did all\nThe slaves. She never let his anger fall\nToo hard. She saved us alway....  And this wild beast\nComes in our sorrow when we need him least!\n\n[_During the last few lines_ HERACLES _has entered, unperceived by\nthe_ SERVANT. _He has evidently bathed and changed his garments and\ndrunk his fill, and is now revelling, a garland of flowers on his head. He\nfrightens the_ SERVANT _a little from time to time during the\nfollowing speech._]\n\nHERACLES.\nFriend, why so solemn and so cranky-eyed?\n'Tis not a henchman's office, to show pride\nTo his betters. He should smile and make good cheer.\n  There comes a guest, thy lord's old comrade, here;\nAnd thou art all knitted eyebrows, scowls and head\nBent, because somebody, forsooth, is dead!\n  Come close! I mean to make thee wiser.\n\n[_The_ SERVANT _reluctantly comes close._]\n\n                                          So.\nDost comprehend things mortal, how they grow?...\n(_To himself_) I suppose not. How could he?...\n                                Look this way!\nDeath is a debt all mortal men must pay;\nAye, there is no man living who can say\nIf life will last him yet a single day.\nOn, to the dark, drives Fortune; and no force\nCan wrest her secret nor put back her course....\n  I have told thee now. I have taught thee. After this\nEat, drink, make thyself merry. Count the bliss\nOf the one passing hour thine own; the rest\nIs Fortune's. And give honour chiefliest\nTo our lady Cypris, giver of all joys\nTo man. 'Tis a sweet goddess. Otherwise,\nLet all these questions sleep and just obey\nMy counsel.... Thou believest all I say?\nI hope so.... Let this stupid grieving be;\nRise up above thy troubles, and with me\nDrink in a cloud of blossoms. By my soul,\nI vow the sweet plash-music of the bowl\nWill break thy glumness, loose thee from the frown\nWithin. Let mortal man keep to his own\nMortality, and not expect too much.\n  To all your solemn dogs and other such\nScowlers--I tell thee truth, no more nor less--\nLife is not life, but just unhappiness.\n\n[_He offers the wine-bowl to the_ SERVANT, _who avoids it_.]\n\nSERVANT.\nWe know all this. But now our fortunes be\nNot such as ask for mirth or revelry.\n\nHERACLES.\nA woman dead, of no one's kin; why grieve\nSo much? Thy master and thy mistress live.\n\nSERVANT.\nLive? Man, hast thou heard nothing of our woe?\n\nHERACLES.\nYes, thy lord told me all I need to know.\n\nSERVANT.\nHe is too kind to his guests, more kind than wise.\n\nHERACLES.\nMust I go starved because some stranger dies?\n\nSERVANT.\nSome stranger?--Yes, a stranger verily!\n\nHERACLES (_his manner beginning to change_).\nIs this some real grief he hath hid from me?\n\nSERVANT.\nGo, drink, man! Leave to us our master's woes.\n\nHERACLES.\nIt sounds not like a stranger. Yet, God knows...\n\nSERVANT.\nHow should thy revelling hurt, if that were all?\n\nHERACLES.\nHath mine own friend so wronged me in his hall?\n\nSERVANT.\nThou camest at an hour when none was free\nTo accept thee. We were mourning. Thou canst see\nOur hair, black robes...\n\nHERACLES (_suddenly, in a voice of thunder_).\n                         Who is it that is dead?\n\nSERVANT.\nAlcestis, the King's wife.\n\nHERACLES (_overcome_).\n                            What hast thou said?\nAlcestis?... And ye feasted me withal!\n\nSERVANT.\nHe held it shame to turn thee from his hall.\n\nHERACLES.\nShame! And when such a wondrous wife was gone!\n\nSERVANT (_breaking into tears_).\nOh, all is gone, all lost, not she alone!\n\nHERACLES.\nI knew, I felt it, when I saw his tears,\nAnd face, and shorn hair. But he won mine ears\nWith talk of the strange woman and her rite\nOf burial. So in mine own heart's despite\nI crossed his threshold and sat drinking--he\nAnd I old friends!--in his calamity.\nDrank, and sang songs, and revelled, my head hot\nWith wine and flowers!... And thou to tell me not,\nWhen all the house lay filled with sorrow, thou!\n(_A pause; then suddenly_)\nWhere lies the tomb?--Where shall I find her now?\n\nSERVANT (_frightened_).\nClose by the straight Larissa road. The tall\nWhite marble showeth from the castle wall.\n\nHERACLES.\nO heart, O hand, great doings have ye done\nOf old: up now, and show them what a son\nTook life that hour, when she of Tiryns' sod,\nElectryon's daughter, mingled with her God!\n  I needs must save this woman from the shore\nOf death and set her in her house once more,\nRepaying Admetus' love.... This Death, this black\nAnd wing\u00c3\u00a8d Lord of corpses, I will track\nHome. I shall surely find him by the grave\nA-hungered, lapping the hot blood they gave\nIn sacrifice. An ambush: then, one spring,\nOne grip! These arms shall be a brazen ring,\nWith no escape, no rest, howe'er he whine\nAnd curse his mauled ribs, till the Queen is mine!\n  Or if he escape me, if he come not there\nTo seek the blood of offering, I will fare\nDown to the Houses without Light, and bring\nTo Her we name not and her nameless King\nStrong prayers, until they yield to me and send\nAlcestis home, to life and to my friend:\nWho gave me shelter, drove me not away\nIn his great grief, but hid his evil day\nLike a brave man, because he loved me well.\nIs one in all this land more hospitable,\nOne in all Greece? I swear no man shall say\nHe hath cast his love upon a churl away!\n\n[_He goes forth, just as he is, in the direction of the grave.\nThe_ SERVANT _watches a moment and goes back into the hall._]\n\n[_The stage is empty; then_ ADMETUS _and the_ CHORUS\n_return._]\n\nADMETUS.\n    Alas!\nBitter the homeward way,\n  Bitter to seek\n    A widowed house; ah me,\n  Where should I fly or stay,\n    Be dumb or speak?\n      Would I could cease to be!\n\n            Despair, despair!\nMy mother bore me under an evil star.\n  I envy them that are perished; my heart is there.\nIt dwells in the Sunless Houses, afar, afar.\n\nI take no joy in looking upon the light;\n  No joy in the feel of the earth beneath my tread.\nThe Slayer hath taken his hostage; the Lord of the Dead\n  Holdeth me sworn to taste no more delight.\n\n[_He throws himself on the ground in despair._]\n\nCHORUS.\n[_Each member of the_ CHORUS _speaks his line severally, as he\npasses_ ADMETUS, _who is heard sobbing at the end of each line._]\n\n  --Advance, advance;\n      Till the house shall give thee cover.\n  --Thou hast borne heavy things\n      And meet for lamentation.\n  --Thou hast passed, hast passed,\n      Thro' the deepest of the River.\n  --Yet no help comes\n      To the sad and silent nation.\n  --And the face of thy belov\u00c3\u00a8d, it shall meet thee never, never!\n\nADMETUS.\nYe wrench my wounds asunder. Where\n  Is grief like mine, whose wife is dead?\n  My wife, whom would I ne'er had wed,\nNor loved, nor held my house with her....\n\nBlessed are they who dare to dwell\n  Unloved of woman! 'Tis but one\n  Heart that they bleed with, and alone\nCan bear their one life's burden well.\n\nNo young shall wither at their side,\n  No bridal room be swept by death....\n  Aye, better man should draw his breath\nFor ever without child or bride.\n\nCHORUS (_as before_).\n  --'Tis Fate, 'tis Fate:\n      She is strong and none shall break her.\n  --No end, no end,\n      Wilt thou lay to lamentations?\n  --Endure and be still:\n      Thy lamenting will not wake her.\n  --There be many before thee,\n      Who have suffered and had patience.\n  --Though the face of Sorrow changeth, yet her hand is on all nations.\n\nADMETUS.\nThe garb of tears, the mourner's cry:\n  Then the long ache when tears are past!...\n  Oh, why didst hinder me to cast\nThis body to the dust and die\nWith her, the faithful and the brave?\n  Then not one lonely soul had fled,\n  But two great lovers, proudly dead,\nThrough the deep waters of the grave.\n\nLEADER.\nA friend I knew,\n  In whose house died a son,\nWorthy of bitter rue,\n  His only one.\nHis head sank, yet he bare\nStilly his weight of care,\nThough grey was in his hair\n  And life nigh done.\n\nADMETUS.\nYe shapes that front me, wall and gate,\n  How shall I enter in and dwell\n  Among ye, with all Fortune's spell\nDischanted? Aye, the change is great.\n\nThat day I strode with bridal song\n  Through lifted brands of Pelian pine;\n  A hand belov\u00c3\u00a8d lay in mine;\nAnd loud behind a revelling throng\n\nExalted me and her, the dead.\n  They called us young, high-hearted; told\n  How princes were our sires of old,\nAnd how we loved and we must wed....\n\nFor those high songs, lo, men that moan,\n  And raiment black where once was white;\n  Who guide me homeward in the night,\nOn that waste bed to lie alone.\n\nSECOND ELDER.\nIt breaks, like strife,\n  Thy long peace, where no pain\nHad entered; yet is life,\n  Sweet life, not slain.\nA wife dead; a dear chair\nEmpty: is that so rare?\nMen live without despair\n  Whose loves are ta'en.\n\nADMETUS (_erect and facing them_).\nBehold, I count my wife's fate happier,\nThough all gainsay me, than mine own. To her\nComes no more pain for ever; she hath rest\nAnd peace from all toil, and her name is blest.\nBut I am one who hath no right to stay\nAlive on earth; one that hath lost his way\nIn fate, and strays in dreams of life long past....\nFriends, I have learned my lesson at the last.\n  I have my life. Here stands my house. But now\nHow dare I enter in? Or, entered, how\nGo forth again? Go forth, when none is there\nTo give me a parting word, and I to her?...\n  Where shall I turn for refuge? There within,\nThe desert that remains where she hath been\nWill drive me forth, the bed, the empty seat\nShe sat in; nay, the floor beneath my feet\nUnswept, the children crying at my knee\nFor mother; and the very thralls will be\nIn sobs for the dear mistress that is lost.\n  That is my home! If I go forth, a host\nOf feasts and bridal dances, gatherings gay\nOf women, will be there to fright me away\nTo loneliness. Mine eyes will never bear\nThe sight. They were her friends; they played with her.\n  And always, always, men who hate my name\nWill murmur: \"This is he who lives in shame\nBecause he dared not die! He gave instead\nThe woman whom he loved, and so is fled\nFrom death. He counts himself a man withal!\nAnd seeing his parents died not at his call\nHe hates them, when himself he dared not die!\"\n  Such mocking beside all my pain shall I\nEndure.... What profit was it to live on,\nFriend, with my grief kept and mine honour gone?\n\nCHORUS.\nI have sojourned in the Muse's land,\n  Have wandered with the wandering star,\nSeeking for strength, and in my hand\n  Held all philosophies that are;\nYet nothing could I hear nor see\nStronger than That Which Needs Must Be.\nNo Orphic rune, no Thracian scroll,\n  Hath magic to avert the morrow;\nNo healing all those medicines brave\nApollo to the Asclepiad gave;\nPale herbs of comfort in the bowl\n    Of man's wide sorrow.\nShe hath no temple, she alone,\n  Nor image where a man may kneel;\nNo blood upon her altar-stone\n  Crying shall make her hear nor feel.\nI know thy greatness; come not great\nBeyond my dreams, O Power of Fate!\nAye, Zeus himself shall not unclose\n  His purpose save by thy decerning.\nThe chain of iron, the Scythian sword,\nIt yields and shivers at thy word;\nThy heart is as the rock, and knows\n  No ruth, nor turning.\n\n[_They turn to_ ADMETUS.]\n\nHer hand hath caught thee; yea, the keeping\n  Of iron fingers grips thee round.\nBe still. Be still. Thy noise of weeping\n  Shall raise no lost one from the ground.\nNay, even the Sons of God are parted\nAt last from joy, and pine in death....\nOh, dear on earth when all did love her,\nOh, dearer lost beyond recover:\nOf women all the bravest-hearted\n  Hath pressed thy lips and breathed thy breath.\n\nLet not the earth that lies upon her\n  Be deemed a grave-mound of the dead.\nLet honour, as the Gods have honour,\n  Be hers, till men shall bow the head,\nAnd strangers, climbing from the city\n  Her slanting path, shall muse and say:\n\"This woman died to save her lover,\nAnd liveth blest, the stars above her:\nHail, Holy One, and grant thy pity!\"\n  So pass the wondering words away.\n\nLEADER.\nBut see, it is Alcmena's son once more,\nMy lord King, cometh striding to thy door.\n\n[_Enter_ HERACLES; _his dress is as in the last scene, but shows\nsigns of a struggle. Behind come two Attendants, guiding between them a\nveiled Woman, who seems like one asleep or unconscious. The Woman remains\nin the background while_ HERACLES _comes forward._]\n\nHERACLES.\nThou art my friend, Admetus; therefore bold\nAnd plain I tell my story, and withhold\nNo secret hurt.--Was I not worthy, friend,\nTo stand beside thee; yea, and to the end\nBe proven in sorrow if I was true to thee?\nAnd thou didst tell me not a word, while she\nLay dead within; but bid me feast, as though\nNaught but the draping of some stranger's woe\nWas on thee. So I garlanded my brow\nAnd poured the gods drink-offering, and but now\nFilled thy death-stricken house with wine and song.\nThou hast done me wrong, my brother; a great wrong\nThou hast done me. But I will not add more pain\nIn thine affliction.\n                      Why I am here again,\nReturning, thou must hear. I pray thee, take\nAnd keep yon woman for me till I make\nMy homeward way from Thrace, when I have ta'en\nThose four steeds and their bloody master slain.\nAnd if--which heaven avert!--I ne'er should see\nHellas again, I leave her here, to be\nAn handmaid in thy house. No labour small\nWas it that brought her to my hand at all.\nI fell upon a contest certain Kings\nHad set for all mankind, sore buffetings\nAnd meet for strong men, where I staked my life\nAnd won this woman. For the easier strife\nBlack steeds were prizes; herds of kine were cast\nFor heavier issues, fists and wrestling; last,\nThis woman.... Lest my work should all seem done\nFor naught, I needs must keep what I have won;\nSo prithee take her in. No theft, but true\nToil, won her.... Some day thou mayst thank me, too.\n\nADMETUS.\n'Twas in no scorn, no bitterness to thee,\nI hid my wife's death and my misery.\nMethought it was but added pain on pain\nIf thou shouldst leave me, and roam forth again\nSeeking another's roof. And, for mine own\nSorrow, I was content to weep alone.\n  But, for this damsel, if it may be so,\nI pray thee, Lord, let some man, not in woe\nLike mine, take her. Thou hast in Thessaly\nAbundant friends.... 'Twould wake sad thoughts in me.\n  How could I have this damsel in my sight\nAnd keep mine eyes dry? Prince, why wilt thou smite\nThe smitten? Griefs enough are on my head.\n  Where in my castle could so young a maid\nBe lodged--her veil and raiment show her young:\nHere, in the men's hall? I should fear some wrong.\n'Tis not so easy, Prince, to keep controlled\nMy young men. And thy charge I fain would hold\nSacred.--If not, wouldst have me keep her in\nThe women's chambers ... where my dead hath been?\nHow could I lay this woman where my bride\nOnce lay? It were dishonour double-dyed.\nThese streets would curse the man who so betrayed\nThe wife who saved him for some younger maid;\nThe dead herself ... I needs must worship her\nAnd keep her will.\n\n[_During the last few lines_ ADMETUS _has been looking at the\nveiled Woman and, though he does not consciously recognize her,\nfeels a strange emotion overmastering him. He draws back._]\n\n\n                    Aye. I must walk with care....\nO woman, whosoe'er thou art, thou hast\nThe shape of my Alcestis; thou art cast\nIn mould like hers.... Oh, take her from mine eyes!\nIn God's name!\n\n[HERACLES _signs to the Attendants to take_ ALCESTIS _away again.\nShe stays veiled and unnoticing in the background._]\n\nI was fallen, and in this wise\nThou wilt make me deeper fall.... Meseems, meseems,\nThere in her face the loved one of my dreams\nLooked forth.--My heart is made a turbid thing,\nCraving I know not what, and my tears spring\nUnbidden.--Grief I knew 'twould be; but how\nFiery a grief I never knew till now.\n\nLEADER.\nThy fate I praise not. Yet, what gift soe'er\nGod giveth, man must steel himself and bear.\n\nHERACLES (_drawing_ ADMETUS _on_).\nWould God, I had the power, 'mid all this might\nOf arm, to break the dungeons of the night,\nAnd free thy wife, and make thee glad again!\n\nADMETUS.\nWhere is such power? I know thy heart were fain;\nBut so 'tis writ. The dead shall never rise.\n\nHERACLES.\nChafe not the curb, then: suffer and be wise.\n\nADMETUS.\nEasier to give such counsel than to keep.\n\nHERACLES.\nWho will be happier, shouldst thou always weep?\n\nADMETUS.\nWhy, none. Yet some blind longing draws me on...\n\nHERACLES.\n'Tis natural. Thou didst love her that is gone.\n\nADMETUS.\n'Tis that hath wrecked, oh more than wrecked, my life.\n\nHERACLES.\n'Tis certain: thou hast lost a faithful wife.\n\nADMETUS.\nTill life itself is dead and wearies me.\n\nHERACLES.\nThy pain is yet young. Time will soften thee,\n\n[_The veiled Woman begins dimly, as though in a dream, to hear the words\nspoken._]\n\nADMETUS.\nTime? Yes, if time be death.\n\nHERACLES.\n                              Nay, wait; and some\nWoman, some new desire of love, will come.\n\nADMETUS (_indignantly_).\nPeace!\nHow canst thou? Shame upon thee!\n\nHERACLES.\n                                  Thou wilt stay\nUnwed for ever, lonely night and day?\n\nADMETUS.\nNo other bride in these void arms shall lie.\n\nHERACLES.\nWhat profit will thy dead wife gain thereby?\n\nADMETUS.\nHonour; which finds her wheresoe'er she lies.\n\nHERACLES.\nMost honourable in thee: but scarcely wise!\n\nADMETUS.\nGod curse me, if I betray her in her tomb!\n\nHERACLES.\nSo be it!...\nAnd this good damsel, thou wilt take her home?\n\nADMETUS.\nNo, in the name of Zeus, thy father! No!\n\nHERACLES.\nI swear, 'tis not well to reject her so.\n\nADMETUS.\n'Twould tear my heart to accept her.\n\nHERACLES.\n                                      Grant me, friend,\nThis one boon! It may help thee in the end.\n\nADMETUS.\nWoe's me!\nWould God thou hadst never won those victories!\n\nHERACLES.\nThou sharest both the victory and the prize.\n\nADMETUS.\nThou art generous.... But now let her go.\n\nHERACLES.\n                                           She shall,\nIf go she must. Look first, and judge withal.\n\n[_He takes the veil off_ ALCESTIS.]\n\nADMETUS (_steadily refusing to look_).\nShe must.--And thou, forgive me!\n\nHERACLES.\n                                  Friend, there is\nA secret reason why I pray for this.\n\nADMETUS (_surprised, then reluctantly yielding_).\nI grant thy boon then--though it likes me ill.\n\nHERACLES.\n'Twill like thee later. Now ... but do my will.\n\nADMETUS (_beckoning to an Attendant_).\nTake her; find her some lodging in my hall.\n\nHERACLES.\nI will not yield this maid to any thrall.\n\nADMETUS.\nTake her thyself and lead her in.\n\nHERACLES.\n                                   I stand\nBeside her; take her; lead her to thy hand.\n\n[_He brings the Woman close to_ ADMETUS, _who looks determinedly\naway. She reaches out her arms._]\n\nADMETUS.\nI touch her not.--Let her go in!\n\nHERACLES.\n                                  I am loth\nTo trust her save to thy pledged hand and oath.\n\n[_He lays his hand on_ ADMETUS'S _shoulder_.]\n\nADMETUS (_desperately_).\nLord, this is violence ... wrong ...\n\nHERACLES.\n                                     Reach forth thine hand\nAnd touch this comer from a distant land.\n\nADMETUS (_holding out his hand without looking_).\nLike Perseus when he touched the Gorgon, there!\n\nHERACLES.\nThou hast touched her?\n\nADMETUS (_at last taking her hand_).\n                        Touched her?... Yes.\n\nHERACLES (_a hand on the shoulder of each_).\n                        Then cling to her;\nAnd say if thou hast found a guest of grace\nIn God's son, Heracles! Look in her face;\nLook; is she like...?\n\n[ADMETUS _looks and stands amazed_.]\n                       Go, and forget in bliss\nThy sorrow!\n\nADMETUS.\n             O ye Gods! What meaneth this?\nA marvel beyond dreams! The face ... 'tis she;\nMine, verily mine! Or doth God mock at me\nAnd blast my vision with some mad surmise?\n\nHERACLES.\nNot so. This is thy wife before thine eyes.\n\nADMETUS (_who has recoiled in his amazement_).\nBeware! The dead have phantoms that they send...\n\nHERACLES.\nNay; no ghost-raiser hast thou made thy friend.\n\nADMETUS.\nMy wife ... she whom I buried?\n\nHERACLES.\n                                      I deceive\nThee not; nor wonder thou canst scarce believe.\n\nADMETUS.\nAnd dare I touch her, greet her, as mine own\nWife living?\n\nHERACLES.\n              Greet her. Thy desire is won.\n\nADMETUS (_approaching with awe_),\nBeloved eyes; beloved form; O thou\nGone beyond hope, I have thee, I hold thee now?\n\nHERACLES.\nThou hast her: may no god begrudge your joy.\n\nADMETUS (_turning to_ HERACLES).\nO lordly conqueror, Child of Zeus on high,\nBe bless\u00c3\u00a8d! And may He, thy sire above,\nSave thee, as thou alone hast saved my love!\n\n[_He kneels to_ HERACLES, _who raises him_.]\n\nBut how ... how didst thou win her to the light?\n\nHERACLES.\nI fought for life with Him I needs must fight.\n\nADMETUS.\nWith Death thou hast fought! But where?\n\nHERACLES.\n                                      Among his dead\nI lay, and sprang and gripped him as he fled.\n\nADMETUS (_in an awed whisper, looking towards_ ALCESTIS).\nWhy standeth she so still? No sound, no word!\n\nHERACLES.\nShe hath dwelt with Death. Her voice may not be heard\nEre to the Lords of Them Below she pay\nDue cleansing, and awake on the third day.\n(_To the Attendants_) So; guide her home.\n\n[_They lead_ ALCESTIS _to the doorway_.]\n\n                              And thou, King, for the rest\nOf time, be true; be righteous to thy guest,\nAs he would have thee be. But now farewell!\nMy task yet lies before me, and the spell\nThat binds me to my master; forth I fare.\n\nADMETUS.\nStay with us this one day! Stay but to share\nThe feast upon our hearth!\n\nHERACLES.\n                            The feasting day\nShall surely come; now I must needs away.\n\n[HERACLES _departs_.]\n\nADMETUS.\nFarewell! All victory attend thy name\nAnd safe home-coming!\n                          Lo, I make proclaim\nTo the Four Nations and all Thessaly;\nA wondrous happiness hath come to be:\nTherefore pray, dance, give offerings and make full\nYour altars with the life-blood of the Bull!\nFor me ... my heart is changed; my life shall mend\nHenceforth. For surely Fortune is a friend.\n\n[_He goes with_ ALCESTIS _into the house_.]\n\nCHORUS.\nThere be many shapes of mystery;\nAnd many things God brings to be,\n  Past hope or fear.\nAnd the end men looked for cometh not,\nAnd a path is there where no man thought.\n  So hath it fallen here.\n\n\n\n\nNOTES\n\n\nP. 3, Prologue. Ascl\u00c3\u00aapios (Latin Aesculapius), son of Apollo, the\nhero-physician, by his miraculous skill healed the dead. This transgressed\nthe divine law, so Zeus slew him. (The particular dead man raised by him\nwas Hippolytus, who came to life in Italy under the name of Virbius, and\nwas worshipped with Artemis at Aricia.) Apollo in revenge, not presuming\nto attack Zeus himself, killed the Cyclopes, and was punished by being\nexiled from heaven and made servant to a mortal. There are several such\nstories of gods made servants to human beings.\n\nP. 3, l. 12, Beguiling.]--See Preface. In the original story he made them\ndrunk with wine. (Aesch. _Eumenides_, 728.) As the allusion would\ndoubtless be clear to the Greek audience, I have added a mention of wine\nwhich is not in the Greek. Libations to the Elder Gods, such as the Fates\nand Eumenides, had to be \"wineless.\" Historically this probably means that\nthe worship dates from a time before wine was used in Greece.\n\nP. 4, l. 22, The stain of death must not come nigh My radiance.]--Compare\nArtemis in the last scene of the _Hippolytus_. The presence of a dead\nbody would be a pollution to Apollo, though that of Th\u00c3\u00a1natos (Death)\nhimself seems not to be so. It is rather Th\u00c3\u00a1natos who is dazzled and\nblinded by Apollo, like an owl or bat in the sunlight.\n\nP. 5, l. 43, Rob me of my second prey.]--\"You first cheated me of Admetus,\nand now you cheat me of his substitute.\"\n\nP. 6, l. 59, The rich would buy, etc.]--Here and throughout this difficult\nlittle dialogue I follow the readings of my own text in the _Bibliotheca\nOxoniensis_.\n\nP. 7, l. 74, To lay upon her hair my sword.]--As the sacrificing priest\ncut off a lock of hair from the victim's head before the actual sacrifice.\n\nP. 8, l. 77, Chorus.]--The Chorus consists of citizens, probably Elders,\nof the city of Pherae. Dr. Verrall has rightly pointed out that there is\nsome general dissatisfaction in the town at Admetus's behaviour (l. 210\nff.). These citizens come to mourn with Admetus out of old friendship,\nthough they do not altogether defend him.\n\nThe Chorus is very drastically broken up into so many separate persons\nconversing with one another; the treatment in the _Rhesus_ is similar\nbut even bolder. See _Rhesus_, pp. 28-31, 37-42. Cf. also the\nentrance-choruses of the _Trojan Women_ (pp. 19-23) and the\n_Medea_ (pp. 10-13); and ll. 872 ff., 889 ff., pp. 50, 51, below.\n\nInstead of assigning the various lines definitely to First, Second, Third\nCitizen, and so on, I have put a \"paragraphus\" (--), the ancient Greek\nsign for indicating a new speaker.\n\nP. 8, l. 82, Pelias' daughter.]--_i.e._ Alcestis.\n\nP. 8, l. 92, Paian.]--The Healer. The word survives chiefly as a cry for\nhelp and as an epithet or title of Apollo or Asclepios. \"Paian,\" Latin\nPaean, is also a cry of victory; but the relation of the two meanings is\nnot quite made out. (Pronounce rather like \"Pah-yan.\") Cf. l. 220.\n\nP. 9, l. 112, To wander o'er leagues of land.]--You could sometimes save a\nsick person by appealing to an oracle, such as that of Apollo in Lycia or\nof Zeus Ammon in the Libyan desert; but now no sacrifice will help. Only\nAsclepios, were he still on earth, might have helped us. (See on the\nPrologue.)\n\nP. 12, l. 150, 'Fore God she dies high-hearted.]--What impresses the Elder\nis the calm and deliberate way in which Alcestis faces these preparations.\n\nP. 12, l. 162, Before the Hearth-Fire.]--Hestia, the hearth-fire, was a\ngoddess, the Latin Vesta, and is addressed as \"Mother.\" It is\ncharacteristic in Alcestis to think chiefly about happy marriages for the\nchildren.\n\nP. 12, l. 182, Happier perhaps, more true she cannot be.]--A famous line\nand open to parody. Cf. Aristophanes, _Knights_, 1251 (\"Another wear\nthis crown instead of me, Happier perhaps; worse thief he cannot be\"). And\nsee on l. 367 below.\n\nP. 15, l. 228, Hearts have bled.]--People have committed suicide for less\nthan this.\n\nP. 16, l. 244, O Sun.]--Alcestis has come out to see the Sun and Sky for\nthe last time and say good-bye to them. It is a rite or practice often\nmentioned in Greek poetry. Her beautiful wandering lines about Charon and\nhis boat are the more natural because she is not dying from any disease\nbut is being mysteriously drawn away by the Powers of Death.\n\nP. 16, l. 252, A boat, two-oared.]--She sees Charon, the boatman who\nferried the souls of the dead across the river Styx.\n\nP. 17, l. 259, Drawing, drawing.]--The creature whom she sees drawing her\nto \"the palaces of the dead\" is certainly not Charon, who had no wings,\nbut was like an old boatman in a peasant's cap and sleeveless tunic; nor\ncan he be Hades, the throned King to whose presence she must eventually\ngo. Apparently, therefore, he must be Thanatos, whom we have just seen on\nthe stage. He was evidently supposed to be invisible to ordinary human\neyes.\n\nP. 18, l. 280, Alcestis's speech.]--Great simplicity and sincerity are the\nkeynotes of this fine speech. Alcestis does not make light of her\nsacrifice: she enjoyed her life and values it; she wishes one of the old\npeople had died instead; she is very earnest that Admetus shall not marry\nagain, chiefly for the children's sake, but possibly also from some little\nshadow of jealousy. A modern dramatist would express all this, if at all,\nby a scene or a series of scenes of conversation; Euripides always uses\nthe long self-revealing speech. Observe how little romantic love there is\nin Alcestis, though Admetus is full of it. See Preface, pp. xiii, xiv.\n\nPp. 19, 20, l. 328 ff., Admetus's speech.]--If the last speech made us\nknow Alcestis, this makes us know Admetus fully as well. At one time the\nbeauty and passion of it almost make us forget its ultimate hollowness; at\nanother this hollowness almost makes us lose patience with its beautiful\nlanguage. In this state of balance the touch of satire in l. 338 f. (\"My\nmother I will know no more,\" etc.), and the fact that he speaks\nimmediately after the complete sincerity of Alcestis, conspire to weigh\ndown the scale against Admetus. There can be no doubt that he means, and\nmeans passionately, all that he says. Only he could not quite manage to\ndie when it was not strictly necessary.\n\nP. 20, l. 355, If Orpheus' voice were mine.]--The bard and prophet,\nOrpheus, went down to the dead to win back his wife, Eurydice. Hades and\nPersephon\u00c3\u00aa, spell-bound by his music, granted his prayer that Eurydic\u00c3\u00aa\nshould return to the light, on condition that he should go before her,\nharping, and should never look back to see if she was following. Just at\nthe end of the journey he looked back, and she vanished. The story is told\nwith overpowering beauty in Vergil's fourth Georgic.\n\nP. 21, l. 367, Oh, not in death from thee Divided.]--Parodied in\nAristophanes' _Archarnians_ 894, where it is addressed to an eel, and\nthe second line ends \"in a beet-root fricassee.\" See on l. 182.\n\nP. 23, l. 393 ff., The Little Boy's speech.]--Classical Greek sculpture\nand vase-painting tended to represent children not like children but like\ndiminutive men; and something of the sort is true of Greek tragedy.\nThe stately tragic convention has in the main to be maintained; the child\nmust speak a language suited for heroes, or at least for high poetry.\nThe quality of childishness has to be indicated by a word or so of\nchild-language delicately admitted amid the stateliness. Here we have\n[Greek: maia], something like \"mummy,\" at the beginning, and [Greek:\nneossos], \"chicken\" or \"little bird,\" at the end. Otherwise most of the\nlanguage is in the regular tragic diction, and some of it doubtless seems\nto us unsuitable for a child. If Milton had had to make a child speak in\n_Paradise Lost_, what sort of diction would he have given it?\n\nThe success or ill-success of such an attempt as this to combine the two\nstyles, the heroic and the childlike, depends on questions of linguistic\ntact, and can hardly be judged with any confidence by foreigners. But I\nthink we can see Euripides here, as in other places, reaching out at an\neffect which was really beyond the resources of his art, and attaining a\nresult which, though clearly imperfect, is strangely moving. He gets great\neffects from the use of children in several tragedies, though he seldom\nlets them speak. They speak in the _Medea_, the _Andromache_,\nand _Suppliants_, and are mute figures in the _Trojan Women,\nHecuba, Heracles_, and _Iphigenia in Aulis_. We may notice that\nwhere his children do speak, they speak only in lyrics, never in ordinary\ndialogue. This is very significant, and clearly right.\n\nThe breaking-down of the child seems to string Admetus to self-control\nagain.\n\nP. 25, l. 428, Ye chariot-lords.]--The plain of Thessaly was famous for\nits cavalry.\n\nP. 25, l. 436 ff., Chorus.]--The \"King black-browed\" is, of course, Hades;\nthe \"grey hand at the helm and oar,\" Charon; the \"Tears that Well,\" the\nmore that spreads out from Acheron, the River of _Ach\u00c3\u00aa_ or Sorrows.\n\nP. 25, l. 445 ff. Alcestis shall be celebrated--and no doubt worshipped--\nat certain full-moon feasts in Athens and Sparta, especially at the\nCarneia, a great Spartan festival held at the full moon in the month\nCarneios (August-September). Who the ancient hero Carnos or Carneios was\nis not very clearly stated by the tradition; but at any rate he was\nkilled, and the feast was meant to placate and perhaps to revive him.\nResurrection is apt to be a feature of both moon-goddesses and vegetation\nspirits.\n\nP. 27, l. 476, Entrance of Heracles.]--Generally, in the tragic\nconvention, each character that enters either announces himself or is\nannounced by some one on the stage; but the figure of Heracles with his\nclub and lion-skin was so well known that his identity could be taken for\ngranted. The Leader at once addresses him by name.\n\nP. 27, l. 481, The Argive King.]--It was the doom of Heracles, from before\nhis birth, to be the servant of a worser man. His master proved to be\nEurystheus, King of Tiryns or Argos, who was his kinsman, and older by a\nday. See _Iliad_ T 95 ff. Note the heroic quality of Heracles's\nanswer in l. 491. It does not occur to him to think of reward for himself.\n\nP. 27, l. 483, Diomede of Thrace.]--This man, distinguished in legend from\nthe Diomede of the _Iliad_, was a savage king who threw wayfarers to\nhis man-eating horses. Such horses are not mere myths; horses have often\nbeen trained to fight with their teeth, like carnivora, for war purposes.\nDiom\u00c3\u00aades was a son of Ar\u00c3\u00aas, the War-god or Slayer, as were the other wild\ntyrants mentioned just below, Lyc\u00c3\u00a2on, the Wolf-hero, and Cycnus, the Swan.\n\nP. 30, l. 511, Right welcome were she: _i.e._ Joy.]--\"Joy would be a\nstrange visitor to me, but I know you mean kindly.\"\n\nP. 30, l. 518 ff., Not thy wife? 'Tis not Alcestis?]--The rather elaborate\nmisleading of Heracles, without any direct lie, depends partly on the fact\nthat the Greek word [Greek: gynae]; means both \"woman\" and \"wife.\"--The\nwoman, not of kin with Admetus but much loved in the house, who has lived\nthere since her father's death left her an orphan, is of course Alcestis,\nbut Heracles, misled by Admetus's first answers, supposes it is some\ndependant to whom the King happens to be attached. He naturally proposes\nto go away, but, with much reluctance, allows himself to be over-persuaded\nby Admetus. He had other friends in Thessaly, but the next castle would\nprobably be several miles off. The guest-chambers of the castle are\napparently in a separate building with a connecting passage.\n\nAs to Admetus's motive, we must remember that the entertaining of Heracles\nis a datum of the story in its simplest form. See Preface, pp. xiv, xv. In\nEuripides, Admetus is perhaps actuated by a mixture of motives, real\nkindness, pride in his ancestral hospitality, and a little vanity. He\nlikes having the great Son of Zeus for a friend, and he has never yet\nturned any one from his doors.\n\nEuripides passes no distinct judgment on this act of Admetus. The Leader\nin the dialogue blames him (\"Art thou mad?\") and so does Heracles\nhereafter, p. 56. But the Chorus glorifies his deed in a very delightful\nlyric. Perhaps this indicates the judgment we are meant to pass upon it.\nOn the plane of common sense it was doubtless all wrong, but on that of\nimaginative poetry it was magnificent.\n\nP. 35, 11. 569-605, Chorus.]--Apollo, worshipped as a shepherd god and a\nsinger, harper, piper, etc. (\"song-changer\"), had been himself a stranger\nin this \"House that loved the stranger\": hence its great reward. Othrys is\nthe end of the mountain range to the south of Pherae; Lake Boibe\u00c3\u00afs was\njust across the narrow end of the plain to the north-east, beyond it came\nMt. Pelion and the steep harbourless coast. Up to the north-west the plain\nof Thessaly stretched far away towards the Molossian mountains. The wild\nbeasts gathered round Apollo as they did round Orpheus (\"There where\nOrpheus harped of old, And the trees awoke and knew him, And the wild\nthings gathered to him, As he piped amid the broken Glens his music\nmanifold.\"--_Bacchae_, p. 35).\n\nP. 37, l. 614, Scene with Pher\u00c3\u00aas.]--Pher\u00c3\u00aas is in tradition the \"eponymous\nhero\" of Pherae, _i.e._ the mythical person who is supposed to have\ngiven his name to the town. It is only in this play that he has any\nparticular character. The scene gives the reader a shock, but is a\nbrilliant piece of satirical comedy, with a good deal of pathos in it,\ntoo. The line (691) [Greek: chaireis horon phos, patera d' ou chairein\ndokeis]; (\"Thou lovest the light, thinkest thou thy father loves it not?\")\nseems to me one of the most characteristic in Euripides. It has a peculiar\nmordant beauty in its absolutely simple language, and one cannot measure\nthe intensity of feeling that may be behind it. Pheres shows great power\nof fight, yet one feels his age and physical weakness. See Preface, p.\nxvi.\n\nP. 40, l. 713 ff. The quick thrust and parry are sometimes hard to follow\nin reading, though in acting the sense would be plain enough. Admetus\ncries angrily, \"Oh, live a longer life than Zeus!\" \"Is that a curse?\" says\nPheres; \"are you cursing because nobody does you any harm?\" (_i.e_.\nsince you clearly have nothing else to curse for). Admetus: \"On the\ncontrary I blessed you; I knew you were greedy of life.\" Pheres: \"_I_\ngreedy? It is _you_, I believe, that Alcestis is dying for.\"\n\nP. 42, l. 732. Acastus was Alcestis's brother, son of Pelias.\n\nP. 43, l. 747. It is rare in Greek tragedy for the Chorus to leave the\nstage altogether in the middle of a play. But they do so, for example, in\nthe _Ajax_ of Sophocles. Ajax is lost, and the Sailors who form the\nChorus go out to look for him; when they are gone the scene is supposed to\nshift and Ajax enters alone, arranging his own death. This very effective\nscene of the revelling Heracles is to be explained, I think, by the\nSatyr-play tradition. See Preface.\n\nP. 45, ll. 782-785. There are four lines rhyming in the Greek here; an odd\nand slightly drunken effect.\n\nP. 46, l. 805 ff., A woman dead, of no one's kin: why grieve so much?]--\nHeracles is somewhat \"shameless,\" as a Greek would say; he had much more\ndelicacy when he was sober.\n\nP. 48, l. 837 ff. A fine speech, leaving one in doubt whether it is the\noutburst of a real hero or the vapouring of a half-drunken man. Just the\neffect intended. Electryon was a chieftain of Tiryns. His daughter,\nAlcm\u00c3\u00aan\u00c3\u00aa, the Tirynthian _Kor\u00c3\u00aa_ or Earth-maiden, was beloved of Zeus,\nor, as others put it, was chosen by Zeus to be the mother of the Deliverer\nof mankind whom he was resolved to beget. She was married to Amphitryon of\nThebes.\n\nP. 49, l. 860 ff. If Heracles set out straight to the grave and Admetus\nwith the procession was returning from the grave, how was it they did not\nmeet? The answer is that Attic drama seldom asked such questions.\n\nPp. 49-54, ll. 861-961. This Threnos, or lamentation scene, seems to our\nminds a little long. We must remember (1) that a Tragedy _is_ a\nThrenos--a _Trauerspiel_--and, however much it develops in the\ndirection of a mere entertainment, the Threnos-element is of primary\nimportance. (2) This scene has two purposes to serve; first to illustrate\nthe helpless loneliness of Admetus when he returns to his empty house, and\nsecondly the way in which remorse works in his mind, till in ll. 935-961\nhe makes public confession that he has done wrong. For both purposes one\nneeds the illusion of a long lapse of time.\n\nP. 53, l. 945 ff., The floor unswept.]--Probably the floor really would be\nunswept in the house of a primitive Thessalian chieftain whose wife was\ndead and her place unfilled; but I doubt if the point would have been\nmentioned so straightforwardly in a real tragedy.\n\nPp. 54-55, l. 966 ff., That which Needs Must Be.]--Ananke or Necessity.--\nOrphic rune.]--The charms inscribed by Orpheus on certain tablets in\nThrace. Orphic literature and worship had a strong magical element in\nthem.\n\nP. 55, l. 995 ff., A grave-mound of the dead.]--Every existing Greek\ntragedy has somewhere in it a taboo grave--a grave which is either\nworshipped, or specially avoided or somehow magical. We may conjecture\nfrom this passage that there was in the time of Euripides a sacred tomb\nnear Pherae, which received worship and had the story told about it that\nshe who lay there had died for her husband.\n\nPp. 56-67, ll. 1008-end. This last scene must have been exceedingly\ndifficult to compose, and some critics have thought it ineffective or\nworse. To me it seems brilliantly conceived and written, though of course\nit needs to be read with the imagination strongly at work. One must never\nforget the silent and veiled Woman on whom the whole scene centres. I have\ntried conjecturally to indicate the main lines of her acting, but, of\ncourse, others may read it differently.\n\nTo understand Heracles in this scene, one must first remember the\ntraditional connexion of Satyrs (and therefore of satyric heroes) with the\nre-awakening of the dead Earth in spring and the return of human souls to\ntheir tribe. Dionysus was, of all the various Kouroi, the one most widely\nconnected with resurrection ideas, and the Satyrs are his attendant\ndaemons, who dance magic dances at the Return to Life of Semele or\nPersephone. And Heracles himself, in certain of his ritual aspects, has\nsimilar functions. See J.E. Harrison, _Themis_, pp. 422 f. and 365\nff., or my _Four Stages of Greek Religion_, pp. 46 f. This tradition\nexplains, to start with, what Heracles--and this particular sort of\nrevelling Heracles--has to do in a resurrection scene. Heracles bringing\nback the dead is a datum of the saga. There remain then the more purely\ndramatic questions about our poet's treatment of the datum.\n\nWhy, for instance, does Heracles mystify Admetus with the Veiled Woman? To\nbreak the news gently, or to retort his own mystification upon him? I\nthink, the latter. Admetus had said that \"a woman\" was dead; Heracles\nsays: \"All right: here is 'a woman' whom I want you to look after.\"\n\nAgain, what are the feelings of Admetus himself? First, mere indignation\nand disgust at the utterly tactless proposal: then, I think, in 1061 ff.\n(\"I must walk with care\" ... end of speech), a strange discovery about\nhimself which amazes and humiliates him. As he looks at the woman he finds\nhimself feeling how exactly like Alcestis she is, and then yearning\ntowards her, almost falling in love with her. A most beautiful and\npoignant touch. In modern language one would say that his subconscious\nnature feels Alcestis there and responds emotionally to her presence; his\nconscious nature, believing the woman to be a stranger, is horrified at\nhis own apparent baseness and inconstancy.\n\nP. 57, l. 1051, Where in my castle, etc.]--The castle is divided into two\nmain parts: a public _megaron_ or great hall where the men live\nduring; the day and sleep at night, and a private region, ruled by the\nqueen and centring in the _thalamos_ or royal bed-chamber. If the new\nwoman were taken into this \"harem,\" even if Admetus never spoke to her,\nthe world outside would surmise the worst and consider him dishonoured.\n\nP. 66, l. 1148, Be righteous to thy guest, As he would have thee be.]--\nDoes this mean \"Go on being hospitable, as you have been,\" or \"Learn after\nthis not to take liberties with other guests\"? It is hard to say.\n\nP. 66, l. 1152, The feasting day shall surely come; now I must needs\naway.]--A fine last word for Heracles. We have seen him feasting, but that\nmakes a small part in his life. His main life is to perform labour upon\nlabour in service to his king. Euripides occasionally liked this method of\nending a play, not with a complete finish (Greek _catastroph\u00c3\u00aa_), but\nwith the opening of a door into some further vista of endurance or\nadventure. The _Trojan Women_ ends by the women going out to the\nGreek ships to begin a life of slavery; the _Rhesus_ with the doomed\narmy of Trojans gathering bravely for an attack which we know will be\ndisastrous. Here we have the story finished for Admetus and Alcestis, but\nno rest for Heracles. See the note at the end of my _Trojan Women_.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Alcestis, by Euripides\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ALCESTIS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 10523-8.txt or 10523-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/0\/5\/2\/10523\/\n\nProduced by Ted Garvin, Charles M.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/etext06\n\n    (Or \/etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/0\/2\/3\/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/2\/4\/6\/8\/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n","id":315,"split":"train"}
