It states, however, that the current international system of governance is flawed and is unable to eradicate the threats of war, terrorism, anarchy and economic instability. Adding to the problem is the widespread belief that human beings are intrinsically hostile and aggressive, and that these flaws make long-term global peace and stability unsustainable.\nThe Statement presents a contrary argument that the human race has been developing and maturing through its history, that human beings are fundamentally spiritual in nature and are the creation of God. As a result, they are capable of building civilization and creating a peaceful world if they decide to do so. The Universal House of Justice asserts that peace cannot occur without religion and quotes Baha\u2019u\u2019llah, the founder of the Baha\u2019i Faith. \u201cReligion is the greatest of all means for the establishment of order in the world and the peaceful contentment of all that dwell therein.\u201d\nIt is the Universal House of Justice\u2019s contention that source of religious strife does not lie with the different religions themselves, but rather with the negligence of humanity and the, \u201cimposition of erroneous interpretations\". These interpretations have separated faith from reason and science from religion. Having rejected religion as irrelevant, societies around the world have adopted a wide number of ideologies that have failed to serve and support the interests of humanity as a whole.\nPeace cannot be achieved simply by banning particular weapons, resolving specific conflicts or by signing new treaties. It requires a whole new level of commitment. The statement asserts that a new framework must be adopted based on several overarching principles and a genuine interest in creating a peaceful and just world. The underlying problems that must be addressed include:\nRacism and discrimination based on race, gender and religious belief\nThe inordinate disparity between the rich and the poor\nUnbridled Nationalism\nReligious strife\nThe inequality between men and women\nThe lack of educational opportunity for many around the world\nA fundamental lack of communication between peoples\nThe Universal House of Justice goes on to say that peace must be founded on the understanding that mankind is essentially one human family. It then calls for the leaders of the world to gather and deliberate on the problem, for the full support of the United Nations and the willing assent of all people for that process of deliberation.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Promise of World Peace by Universal\nHouse of Justice\n\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no\nrestrictions whatsoever.

For the first time in history\nit is possible for everyone to view the entire planet, with all its myriad\ndiversified peoples, in one perspective. World peace is not only possible\nbut inevitable. It is the next stage in the evolution of this planet\u00e2\u0080\u0094in\nthe words of one great thinker, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe planetization of mankind\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nWhether peace is to be reached only after unimaginable horrors\nprecipitated by humanity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stubborn clinging to old patterns of behaviour,\nor is to be embraced now by an act of consultative will, is the choice\nbefore all who inhabit the earth. At this critical juncture when the\nintractable problems confronting nations have been fused into one common\nconcern for the whole world, failure to stem the tide of conflict and\ndisorder would be unconscionably irresponsible.\n\nAmong the favourable signs are the steadily growing strength of the steps\ntowards world order taken initially near the beginning of this century in\nthe creation of the League of Nations, succeeded by the more broadly based\nUnited Nations Organization; the achievement since the Second World War of\nindependence by the majority of all the nations on earth, indicating the\ncompletion of the process of nation building, and the involvement of these\nfledgling nations with older ones in matters of mutual concern; the\nconsequent vast increase in co-operation among hitherto isolated and\nantagonistic peoples and groups in international undertakings in the\nscientific, educational, legal, economic and cultural fields; the rise in\nrecent decades of an unprecedented number of international humanitarian\norganizations; the spread of women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and youth movements calling for an\nend to war; and the spontaneous spawning of widening networks of ordinary\npeople seeking understanding through personal communication.\n\nThe scientific and technological advances occurring in this unusually\nblessed century portend a great surge forward in the social evolution of\nthe planet, and indicate the means by which the practical problems of\nhumanity may be solved. They provide, indeed, the very means for the\nadministration of the complex life of a united world. Yet barriers\npersist. Doubts, misconceptions, prejudices, suspicions and narrow\nself-interest beset nations and peoples in their relations one to another.\n\nIt is out of a deep sense of spiritual and moral duty that we are impelled\nat this opportune moment to invite your attention to the penetrating\ninsights first communicated to the rulers of mankind more than a century\nago by Bah\u00c3\u00a1\u00e2\u0080\u0099u\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\u00c3\u00a1h, Founder of the Bah\u00c3\u00a1\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c3\u00ad Faith, of which we are the\nTrustees.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe winds of despair\u00e2\u0080\u009d, Bah\u00c3\u00a1\u00e2\u0080\u0099u\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\u00c3\u00a1h wrote, \u00e2\u0080\u009care, alas, blowing from every\ndirection, and the strife that divides and afflicts the human race is\ndaily increasing. The signs of impending convulsions and chaos can now be\ndiscerned, inasmuch as the prevailing order appears to be lamentably\ndefective.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This prophetic judgement has been amply confirmed by the\ncommon experience of humanity. Flaws in the prevailing order are\nconspicuous in the inability of sovereign states organized as United\nNations to exorcize the spectre of war, the threatened collapse of the\ninternational economic order, the spread of anarchy and terrorism, and the\nintense suffering which these and other afflictions are causing to\nincreasing millions. Indeed, so much have aggression and conflict come to\ncharacterize our social, economic and religious systems, that many have\nsuccumbed to the view that such behaviour is intrinsic to human nature and\ntherefore ineradicable.\n\nWith the entrenchment of this view, a paralyzing contradiction has\ndeveloped in human affairs. On the one hand, people of all nations\nproclaim not only their readiness but their longing for peace and harmony,\nfor an end to the harrowing apprehensions tormenting their daily lives. On\nthe other, uncritical assent is given to the proposition that human beings\nare incorrigibly selfish and aggressive and thus incapable of erecting a\nsocial system at once progressive and peaceful, dynamic and harmonious, a\nsystem giving free play to individual creativity and initiative but based\non co-operation and reciprocity.\n\nAs the need for peace becomes more urgent, this fundamental contradiction,\nwhich hinders its realization, demands a reassessment of the assumptions\nupon which the commonly held view of mankind\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical predicament is\nbased. Dispassionately examined, the evidence reveals that such conduct,\nfar from expressing man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true self, represents a distortion of the human\nspirit. Satisfaction on this point will enable all people to set in motion\nconstructive social forces which, because they are consistent with human\nnature, will encourage harmony and co-operation instead of war and\nconflict.\n\nTo choose such a course is not to deny humanity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past but to understand\nit. The Bah\u00c3\u00a1\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c3\u00ad Faith regards the current world confusion and calamitous\ncondition in human affairs as a natural phase in an organic process\nleading ultimately and irresistibly to the unification of the human race\nin a single social order whose boundaries are those of the planet. The\nhuman race, as a distinct, organic unit, has passed through evolutionary\nstages analogous to the stages of infancy and childhood in the lives of\nits individual members, and is now in the culminating period of its\nturbulent adolescence approaching its long-awaited coming of age.\n\nA candid acknowledgement that prejudice, war and exploitation have been\nthe expression of immature stages in a vast historical process and that\nthe human race is today experiencing the unavoidable tumult which marks\nits collective coming of age is not a reason for despair but a\nprerequisite to undertaking the stupendous enterprise of building a\npeaceful world. That such an enterprise is possible, that the necessary\nconstructive forces do exist, that unifying social structures can be\nerected, is the theme we urge you to examine.\n\nWhatever suffering and turmoil the years immediately ahead may hold,\nhowever dark the immediate circumstances, the Bah\u00c3\u00a1\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c3\u00ad community believes\nthat humanity can confront this supreme trial with confidence in its\nultimate outcome. Far from signalizing the end of civilization, the\nconvulsive changes towards which humanity is being ever more rapidly\nimpelled will serve to release the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpotentialities inherent in the station\nof man\u00e2\u0080\u009d and reveal \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe full measure of his destiny on earth, the innate\nexcellence of his reality\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nThe endowments which distinguish the human race from all other forms of\nlife are summed up in what is known as the human spirit; the mind is its\nessential quality. These endowments have enabled humanity to build\ncivilizations and to prosper materially. But such accomplishments alone\nhave never satisfied the human spirit, whose mysterious nature inclines it\ntowards transcendence, a reaching towards an invisible realm, towards the\nultimate reality, that unknowable essence of essences called God. The\nreligions brought to mankind by a succession of spiritual luminaries have\nbeen the primary link between humanity and that ultimate reality, and have\ngalvanized and refined mankind\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capacity to achieve spiritual success\ntogether with social progress.\n\nNo serious attempt to set human affairs aright, to achieve world peace,\ncan ignore religion. Man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perception and practice of it are largely the\nstuff of history. An eminent historian described religion as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfaculty of\nhuman nature\u00e2\u0080\u009d. That the perversion of this faculty has contributed to much\nof the confusion in society and the conflicts in and between individuals\ncan hardly be denied. But neither can any fair-minded observer discount\nthe preponderating influence exerted by religion on the vital expressions\nof civilization. Furthermore, its indispensability to social order has\nrepeatedly been demonstrated by its direct effect on laws and morality.\n\nWriting of religion as a social force, Bah\u00c3\u00a1\u00e2\u0080\u0099u\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\u00c3\u00a1h said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cReligion is the\ngreatest of all means for the establishment of order in the world and for\nthe peaceful contentment of all that dwell therein.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Referring to the\neclipse or corruption of religion, he wrote: \u00e2\u0080\u009cShould the lamp of religion\nbe obscured, chaos and confusion will ensue, and the lights of fairness,\nof justice, of tranquillity and peace cease to shine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In an enumeration\nof such consequences the Bah\u00c3\u00a1\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c3\u00ad writings point out that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cperversion of\nhuman nature, the degradation of human conduct, the corruption and\ndissolution of human institutions, reveal themselves, under such\ncircumstances, in their worst and most revolting aspects. Human character\nis debased, confidence is shaken, the nerves of discipline are relaxed,\nthe voice of human conscience is stilled, the sense of decency and shame\nis obscured, conceptions of duty, of solidarity, of reciprocity and\nloyalty are distorted, and the very feeling of peacefulness, of joy and of\nhope is gradually extinguished.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIf, therefore, humanity has come to a point of paralyzing conflict it must\nlook to itself, to its own negligence, to the siren voices to which it has\nlistened, for the source of the misunderstandings and confusion\nperpetrated in the name of religion. Those who have held blindly and\nselfishly to their particular orthodoxies, who have imposed on their\nvotaries erroneous and conflicting interpretations of the pronouncements\nof the Prophets of God, bear heavy responsibility for this confusion\u00e2\u0080\u0094a\nconfusion compounded by the artificial barriers erected between faith and\nreason, science and religion. For from a fair-minded examination of the\nactual utterances of the Founders of the great religions, and of the\nsocial milieus in which they were obliged to carry out their missions,\nthere is nothing to support the contentions and prejudices deranging the\nreligious communities of mankind and therefore all human affairs.\n\nThe teaching that we should treat others as we ourselves would wish to be\ntreated, an ethic variously repeated in all the great religions, lends\nforce to this latter observation in two particular respects: it sums up\nthe moral attitude, the peace-inducing aspect, extending through these\nreligions irrespective of their place or time of origin; it also signifies\nan aspect of unity which is their essential virtue, a virtue mankind in\nits disjointed view of history has failed to appreciate.\n\nHad humanity seen the Educators of its collective childhood in their true\ncharacter, as agents of one civilizing process, it would no doubt have\nreaped incalculably greater benefits from the cumulative effects of their\nsuccessive missions. This, alas, it failed to do.\n\nThe resurgence of fanatical religious fervour occurring in many lands\ncannot be regarded as more than a dying convulsion. The very nature of the\nviolent and disruptive phenomena associated with it testifies to the\nspiritual bankruptcy it represents. Indeed, one of the strangest and\nsaddest features of the current outbreak of religious fanaticism is the\nextent to which, in each case, it is undermining not only the spiritual\nvalues which are conducive to the unity of mankind but also those unique\nmoral victories won by the particular religion it purports to serve.\n\nHowever vital a force religion has been in the history of mankind, and\nhowever dramatic the current resurgence of militant religious fanaticism,\nreligion and religious institutions have, for many decades, been viewed by\nincreasing numbers of people as irrelevant to the major concerns of the\nmodern world. In its place they have turned either to the hedonistic\npursuit of material satisfactions or to the following of man-made\nideologies designed to rescue society from the evident evils under which\nit groans. All too many of these ideologies, alas, instead of embracing\nthe concept of the oneness of mankind and promoting the increase of\nconcord among different peoples, have tended to deify the state, to\nsubordinate the rest of mankind to one nation, race or class, to attempt\nto suppress all discussion and interchange of ideas, or to callously\nabandon starving millions to the operations of a market system that all\ntoo clearly is aggravating the plight of the majority of mankind, while\nenabling small sections to live in a condition of affluence scarcely\ndreamed of by our forebears.\n\nHow tragic is the record of the substitute faiths that the worldly-wise of\nour age have created. In the massive disillusionment of entire populations\nwho have been taught to worship at their altars can be read history\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nirreversible verdict on their value. The fruits these doctrines have\nproduced, after decades of an increasingly unrestrained exercise of power\nby those who owe their ascendancy in human affairs to them, are the social\nand economic ills that blight every region of our world in the closing\nyears of the twentieth century. Underlying all these outward afflictions\nis the spiritual damage reflected in the apathy that has gripped the mass\nof the peoples of all nations and by the extinction of hope in the hearts\nof deprived and anguished millions.\n\nThe time has come when those who preach the dogmas of materialism, whether\nof the east or the west, whether of capitalism or socialism, must give\naccount of the moral stewardship they have presumed to exercise. Where is\nthe \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew world\u00e2\u0080\u009d promised by these ideologies? Where is the international\npeace to whose ideals they proclaim their devotion? Where are the\nbreakthroughs into new realms of cultural achievement produced by the\naggrandizement of this race, of that nation or of a particular class? Why\nis the vast majority of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s peoples sinking ever deeper into\nhunger and wretchedness when wealth on a scale undreamed of by the\nPharaohs, the Caesars, or even the imperialist powers of the nineteenth\ncentury is at the disposal of the present arbiters of human affairs?\n\nMost particularly, it is in the glorification of material pursuits, at\nonce the progenitor and common feature of all such ideologies, that we\nfind the roots which nourish the falsehood that human beings are\nincorrigibly selfish and aggressive. It is here that the ground must be\ncleared for the building of a new world fit for our descendants.\n\nThat materialistic ideals have, in the light of experience, failed to\nsatisfy the needs of mankind calls for an honest acknowledgement that a\nfresh effort must now be made to find the solutions to the agonizing\nproblems of the planet. The intolerable conditions pervading society\nbespeak a common failure of all, a circumstance which tends to incite\nrather than relieve the entrenchment on every side. Clearly, a common\nremedial effort is urgently required. It is primarily a matter of\nattitude. Will humanity continue in its waywardness, holding to outworn\nconcepts and unworkable assumptions? Or will its leaders, regardless of\nideology, step forth and, with a resolute will, consult together in a\nunited search for appropriate solutions?\n\nThose who care for the future of the human race may well ponder this\nadvice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf long-cherished ideals and time-honoured institutions, if\ncertain social assumptions and religious formulae have ceased to promote\nthe welfare of the generality of mankind, if they no longer minister to\nthe needs of a continually evolving humanity, let them be swept away and\nrelegated to the limbo of obsolescent and forgotten doctrines. Why should\nthese, in a world subject to the immutable law of change and decay, be\nexempt from the deterioration that must needs overtake every human\ninstitution? For legal standards, political and economic theories are\nsolely designed to safeguard the interests of humanity as a whole, and not\nhumanity to be crucified for the preservation of the integrity of any\nparticular law or doctrine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nBanning nuclear weapons, prohibiting the use of poison gases, or outlawing\ngerm warfare will not remove the root causes of war. However important\nsuch practical measures obviously are as elements of the peace process,\nthey are in themselves too superficial to exert enduring influence.\nPeoples are ingenious enough to invent yet other forms of warfare, and to\nuse food, raw materials, finance, industrial power, ideology, and\nterrorism to subvert one another in an endless quest for supremacy and\ndominion. Nor can the present massive dislocation in the affairs of\nhumanity be resolved through the settlement of specific conflicts or\ndisagreements among nations. A genuine universal framework must be\nadopted.\n\nCertainly, there is no lack of recognition by national leaders of the\nworld-wide character of the problem, which is self-evident in the mounting\nissues that confront them daily. And there are the accumulating studies\nand solutions proposed by many concerned and enlightened groups as well as\nby agencies of the United Nations, to remove any possibility of ignorance\nas to the challenging requirements to be met. There is, however, a\nparalysis of will; and it is this that must be carefully examined and\nresolutely dealt with. This paralysis is rooted, as we have stated, in a\ndeep-seated conviction of the inevitable quarrelsomeness of mankind, which\nhas led to the reluctance to entertain the possibility of subordinating\nnational self-interest to the requirements of world order, and in an\nunwillingness to face courageously the far-reaching implications of\nestablishing a united world authority. It is also traceable to the\nincapacity of largely ignorant and subjugated masses to articulate their\ndesire for a new order in which they can live in peace, harmony and\nprosperity with all humanity.\n\nThe tentative steps towards world order, especially since World War II,\ngive hopeful signs. The increasing tendency of groups of nations to\nformalize relationships which enable them to co-operate in matters of\nmutual interest suggests that eventually all nations could overcome this\nparalysis. The Association of South East Asian Nations, the Caribbean\nCommunity and Common Market, the Central American Common Market, the\nCouncil for Mutual Economic Assistance, the European Communities, the\nLeague of Arab States, the Organization of African Unity, the Organization\nof American States, the South Pacific Forum\u00e2\u0080\u0094all the joint endeavours\nrepresented by such organizations prepare the path to world order.\n\nThe increasing attention being focused on some of the most deep-rooted\nproblems of the planet is yet another hopeful sign. Despite the obvious\nshortcomings of the United Nations, the more than two score declarations\nand conventions adopted by that organization, even where governments have\nnot been enthusiastic in their commitment, have given ordinary people a\nsense of a new lease on life. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\nthe Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide,\nand the similar measures concerned with eliminating all forms of\ndiscrimination based on race, sex or religious belief; upholding the\nrights of the child; protecting all persons against being subjected to\ntorture; eradicating hunger and malnutrition; using scientific and\ntechnological progress in the interest of peace and the benefit of\nmankind\u00e2\u0080\u0094all such measures, if courageously enforced and expanded, will\nadvance the day when the spectre of war will have lost its power to\ndominate international relations. There is no need to stress the\nsignificance of the issues addressed by these declarations and\nconventions. However, a few such issues, because of their immediate\nrelevance to establishing world peace, deserve additional comment.\n\nRacism, one of the most baneful and persistent evils, is a major barrier\nto peace. Its practice perpetrates too outrageous a violation of the\ndignity of human beings to be countenanced under any pretext. Racism\nretards the unfoldment of the boundless potentialities of its victims,\ncorrupts its perpetrators, and blights human progress. Recognition of the\noneness of mankind, implemented by appropriate legal measures, must be\nuniversally upheld if this problem is to be overcome.\n\nThe inordinate disparity between rich and poor, a source of acute\nsuffering, keeps the world in a state of instability, virtually on the\nbrink of war. Few societies have dealt effectively with this situation.\nThe solution calls for the combined application of spiritual, moral and\npractical approaches. A fresh look at the problem is required, entailing\nconsultation with experts from a wide spectrum of disciplines, devoid of\neconomic and ideological polemics, and involving the people directly\naffected in the decisions that must urgently be made. It is an issue that\nis bound up not only with the necessity for eliminating extremes of wealth\nand poverty but also with those spiritual verities the understanding of\nwhich can produce a new universal attitude. Fostering such an attitude is\nitself a major part of the solution.\n\nUnbridled nationalism, as distinguished from a sane and legitimate\npatriotism, must give way to a wider loyalty, to the love of humanity as a\nwhole. Bah\u00c3\u00a1\u00e2\u0080\u0099u\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\u00c3\u00a1h\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statement is: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe earth is but one country, and\nmankind its citizens.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The concept of world citizenship is a direct result\nof the contraction of the world into a single neighbourhood through\nscientific advances and of the indisputable interdependence of nations.\nLove of all the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s peoples does not exclude love of one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s country.\nThe advantage of the part in a world society is best served by promoting\nthe advantage of the whole. Current international activities in various\nfields which nurture mutual affection and a sense of solidarity among\npeoples need greatly to be increased.\n\nReligious strife, throughout history, has been the cause of innumerable\nwars and conflicts, a major blight to progress, and is increasingly\nabhorrent to the people of all faiths and no faith. Followers of all\nreligions must be willing to face the basic questions which this strife\nraises, and to arrive at clear answers. How are the differences between\nthem to be resolved, both in theory and in practice? The challenge facing\nthe religious leaders of mankind is to contemplate, with hearts filled\nwith the spirit of compassion and a desire for truth, the plight of\nhumanity, and to ask themselves whether they cannot, in humility before\ntheir Almighty Creator, submerge their theological differences in a great\nspirit of mutual forbearance that will enable them to work together for\nthe advancement of human understanding and peace.\n\nThe emancipation of women, the achievement of full equality between the\nsexes, is one of the most important, though less acknowledged\nprerequisites of peace. The denial of such equality perpetrates an\ninjustice against one half of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population and promotes in men\nharmful attitudes and habits that are carried from the family to the\nworkplace, to political life, and ultimately to international relations.\nThere are no grounds, moral, practical, or biological, upon which such\ndenial can be justified. Only as women are welcomed into full partnership\nin all fields of human endeavour will the moral and psychological climate\nbe created in which international peace can emerge.\n\nThe cause of universal education, which has already enlisted in its\nservice an army of dedicated people from every faith and nation, deserves\nthe utmost support that the governments of the world can lend it. For\nignorance is indisputably the principal reason for the decline and fall of\npeoples and the perpetuation of prejudice. No nation can achieve success\nunless education is accorded all its citizens. Lack of resources limits\nthe ability of many nations to fulfil this necessity, imposing a certain\nordering of priorities. The decision-making agencies involved would do\nwell to consider giving first priority to the education of women and\ngirls, since it is through educated mothers that the benefits of knowledge\ncan be most effectively and rapidly diffused throughout society. In\nkeeping with the requirements of the times, consideration should also be\ngiven to teaching the concept of world citizenship as part of the standard\neducation of every child.\n\nA fundamental lack of communication between peoples seriously undermines\nefforts towards world peace. Adopting an international auxiliary language\nwould go far to resolving this problem and necessitates the most urgent\nattention.\n\nTwo points bear emphasizing in all these issues. One is that the abolition\nof war is not simply a matter of signing treaties and protocols; it is a\ncomplex task requiring a new level of commitment to resolving issues not\ncustomarily associated with the pursuit of peace. Based on political\nagreements alone, the idea of collective security is a chimera. The other\npoint is that the primary challenge in dealing with issues of peace is to\nraise the context to the level of principle, as distinct from pure\npragmatism. For, in essence, peace stems from an inner state supported by\na spiritual or moral attitude, and it is chiefly in evoking this attitude\nthat the possibility of enduring solutions can be found.\n\nThere are spiritual principles, or what some call human values, by which\nsolutions can be found for every social problem. Any well-intentioned\ngroup can in a general sense devise practical solutions to its problems,\nbut good intentions and practical knowledge are usually not enough. The\nessential merit of spiritual principle is that it not only presents a\nperspective which harmonizes with that which is immanent in human nature,\nit also induces an attitude, a dynamic, a will, an aspiration, which\nfacilitate the discovery and implementation of practical measures. Leaders\nof governments and all in authority would be well served in their efforts\nto solve problems if they would first seek to identify the principles\ninvolved and then be guided by them.\n\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nThe primary question to be resolved is how the present world, with its\nentrenched pattern of conflict, can change to a world in which harmony and\nco-operation will prevail.\n\nWorld order can be founded only on an unshakeable consciousness of the\noneness of mankind, a spiritual truth which all the human sciences\nconfirm. Anthropology, physiology, psychology, recognize only one human\nspecies, albeit infinitely varied in the secondary aspects of life.\nRecognition of this truth requires abandonment of prejudice\u00e2\u0080\u0094prejudice of\nevery kind\u00e2\u0080\u0094race, class, colour, creed, nation, sex, degree of material\ncivilization, everything which enables people to consider themselves\nsuperior to others.\n\nAcceptance of the oneness of mankind is the first fundamental prerequisite\nfor reorganization and administration of the world as one country, the\nhome of humankind. Universal acceptance of this spiritual principle is\nessential to any successful attempt to establish world peace. It should\ntherefore be universally proclaimed, taught in schools, and constantly\nasserted in every nation as preparation for the organic change in the\nstructure of society which it implies.\n\nIn the Bah\u00c3\u00a1\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c3\u00ad view, recognition of the oneness of mankind \u00e2\u0080\u009ccalls for no\nless than the reconstruction and the demilitarization of the whole\ncivilized world\u00e2\u0080\u0094a world organically unified in all the essential aspects\nof its life, its political machinery, its spiritual aspiration, its trade\nand finance, its script and language, and yet infinite in the diversity of\nthe national characteristics of its federated units.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nElaborating the implications of this pivotal principle, Shoghi Effendi,\nthe Guardian of the Bah\u00c3\u00a1\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c3\u00ad Faith, commented in 1931 that: \u00e2\u0080\u009cFar from aiming\nat the subversion of the existing foundations of society, it seeks to\nbroaden its basis, to remold its institutions in a manner consonant with\nthe needs of an ever-changing world. It can conflict with no legitimate\nallegiances, nor can it undermine essential loyalties. Its purpose is\nneither to stifle the flame of a sane and intelligent patriotism in men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhearts, nor to abolish the system of national autonomy so essential if the\nevils of excessive centralization are to be avoided. It does not ignore,\nnor does it attempt to suppress, the diversity of ethnical origins, of\nclimate, of history, of language and tradition, of thought and habit, that\ndifferentiate the peoples and nations of the world. It calls for a wider\nloyalty, for a larger aspiration than any that has animated the human\nrace. It insists upon the subordination of national impulses and interests\nto the imperative claims of a unified world. It repudiates excessive\ncentralization on one hand, and disclaims all attempts at uniformity on\nthe other. Its watchword is unity in diversity\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nThe achievement of such ends requires several stages in the adjustment of\nnational political attitudes, which now verge on anarchy in the absence of\nclearly defined laws or universally accepted and enforceable principles\nregulating the relationships between nations. The League of Nations, the\nUnited Nations, and the many organizations and agreements produced by them\nhave unquestionably been helpful in attenuating some of the negative\neffects of international conflicts, but they have shown themselves\nincapable of preventing war. Indeed, there have been scores of wars since\nthe end of the Second World War; many are yet raging.\n\nThe predominant aspects of this problem had already emerged in the\nnineteenth century when Bah\u00c3\u00a1\u00e2\u0080\u0099u\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\u00c3\u00a1h first advanced his proposals for the\nestablishment of world peace. The principle of collective security was\npropounded by him in statements addressed to the rulers of the world.\nShoghi Effendi commented on his meaning: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat else could these weighty\nwords signify,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif they did not point to the inevitable\ncurtailment of unfettered national sovereignty as an indispensable\npreliminary to the formation of the future Commonwealth of all the nations\nof the world? Some form of a world super-state must needs be evolved, in\nwhose favour all the nations of the world will have willingly ceded every\nclaim to make war, certain rights to impose taxation and all rights to\nmaintain armaments, except for purposes of maintaining internal order\nwithin their respective dominions. Such a state will have to include\nwithin its orbit an International Executive adequate to enforce supreme\nand unchallengeable authority on every recalcitrant member of the\ncommonwealth; a World Parliament whose members shall be elected by the\npeople in their respective countries and whose election shall be confirmed\nby their respective governments; and a Supreme Tribunal whose judgement\nwill have a binding effect even in such cases where the parties concerned\ndid not voluntarily agree to submit their case to its consideration.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA world community in which all economic barriers will have been\npermanently demolished and the interdependence of capital and labour\ndefinitely recognized; in which the clamour of religious fanaticism and\nstrife will have been forever stilled; in which the flame of racial\nanimosity will have been finally extinguished; in which a single code of\ninternational law\u00e2\u0080\u0094the product of the considered judgement of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfederated representatives\u00e2\u0080\u0094shall have as its sanction the instant and\ncoercive intervention of the combined forces of the federated units; and\nfinally a world community in which the fury of a capricious and militant\nnationalism will have been transmuted into an abiding consciousness of\nworld citizenship\u00e2\u0080\u0094such indeed, appears, in its broadest outline, the Order\nanticipated by Bah\u00c3\u00a1\u00e2\u0080\u0099u\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\u00c3\u00a1h, an Order that shall come to be regarded as the\nfairest fruit of a slowly maturing age.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe implementation of these far-reaching measures was indicated by\nBah\u00c3\u00a1\u00e2\u0080\u0099u\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\u00c3\u00a1h: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe time must come when the imperative necessity for the\nholding of a vast, an all-embracing assemblage of men will be universally\nrealized. The rulers and kings of the earth must needs attend it, and,\nparticipating in its deliberations, must consider such ways and means as\nwill lay the foundations of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Great Peace amongst men.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe courage, the resolution, the pure motive, the selfless love of one\npeople for another\u00e2\u0080\u0094all the spiritual and moral qualities required for\neffecting this momentous step towards peace are focused on the will to\nact. And it is towards arousing the necessary volition that earnest\nconsideration must be given to the reality of man, namely, his thought. To\nunderstand the relevance of this potent reality is also to appreciate the\nsocial necessity of actualizing its unique value through candid,\ndispassionate and cordial consultation, and of acting upon the results of\nthis process. Bah\u00c3\u00a1\u00e2\u0080\u0099u\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\u00c3\u00a1h insistently drew attention to the virtues and\nindispensability of consultation for ordering human affairs. He said:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cConsultation bestows greater awareness and transmutes conjecture into\ncertitude. It is a shining light which, in a dark world, leads the way and\nguides. For everything there is and will continue to be a station of\nperfection and maturity. The maturity of the gift of understanding is made\nmanifest through consultation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The very attempt to achieve peace through\nthe consultative action he proposed can release such a salutary spirit\namong the peoples of the earth that no power could resist the final,\ntriumphal outcome.\n\nConcerning the proceedings for this world gathering, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Abdu\u00e2\u0080\u0099l-Bah\u00c3\u00a1, the son\nof Bah\u00c3\u00a1\u00e2\u0080\u0099u\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\u00c3\u00a1h and authorized interpreter of his teachings, offered these\ninsights: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey must make the Cause of Peace the object of general\nconsultation, and seek by every means in their power to establish a Union\nof the nations of the world. They must conclude a binding treaty and\nestablish a covenant, the provisions of which shall be sound, inviolable\nand definite. They must proclaim it to all the world and obtain for it the\nsanction of all the human race. This supreme and noble undertaking\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nreal source of the peace and well-being of all the world\u00e2\u0080\u0094should be\nregarded as sacred by all that dwell on earth. All the forces of humanity\nmust be mobilized to ensure the stability and permanence of this Most\nGreat Covenant. In this all-embracing Pact the limits and frontiers of\neach and every nation should be clearly fixed, the principles underlying\nthe relations of governments towards one another definitely laid down, and\nall international agreements and obligations ascertained. In like manner,\nthe size of the armaments of every government should be strictly limited,\nfor if the preparations for war and the military forces of any nation\nshould be allowed to increase, they will arouse the suspicion of others.\nThe fundamental principle underlying this solemn Pact should be so fixed\nthat if any government later violate any one of its provisions, all the\ngovernments on earth should arise to reduce it to utter submission, nay\nthe human race as a whole should resolve, with every power at its\ndisposal, to destroy that government. Should this greatest of all remedies\nbe applied to the sick body of the world, it will assuredly recover from\nits ills and will remain eternally safe and secure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe holding of this mighty convocation is long overdue.\n\nWith all the ardour of our hearts, we appeal to the leaders of all nations\nto seize this opportune moment and take irreversible steps to convoke this\nworld meeting. All the forces of history impel the human race towards this\nact which will mark for all time the dawn of its long-awaited maturity.\n\nWill not the United Nations, with the full support of its membership, rise\nto the high purposes of such a crowning event?\n\nLet men and women, youth and children everywhere recognize the eternal\nmerit of this imperative action for all peoples and lift up their voices\nin willing assent. Indeed, let it be this generation that inaugurates this\nglorious stage in the evolution of social life on the planet.\n\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nThe source of the optimism we feel is a vision transcending the cessation\nof war and the creation of agencies of international co-operation.\nPermanent peace among nations is an essential stage, but not, Bah\u00c3\u00a1\u00e2\u0080\u0099u\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\u00c3\u00a1h\nasserts, the ultimate goal of the social development of humanity. Beyond\nthe initial armistice forced upon the world by the fear of nuclear\nholocaust, beyond the political peace reluctantly entered into by\nsuspicious rival nations, beyond pragmatic arrangements for security and\ncoexistence, beyond even the many experiments in co-operation which these\nsteps will make possible lies the crowning goal: the unification of all\nthe peoples of the world in one universal family.\n\nDisunity is a danger that the nations and peoples of the earth can no\nlonger endure; the consequences are too terrible to contemplate, too\nobvious to require any demonstration. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe well-being of mankind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nBah\u00c3\u00a1\u00e2\u0080\u0099u\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\u00c3\u00a1h wrote more than a century ago, \u00e2\u0080\u009cits peace and security, are\nunattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In\nobserving that \u00e2\u0080\u009cmankind is groaning, is dying to be led to unity, and to\nterminate its age-long martyrdom\u00e2\u0080\u009d, Shoghi Effendi further commented that:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnification of the whole of mankind is the hall-mark of the stage which\nhuman society is now approaching. Unity of family, of tribe, of\ncity-state, and nation have been successively attempted and fully\nestablished. World unity is the goal towards which a harassed humanity is\nstriving. Nation-building has come to an end. The anarchy inherent in\nstate sovereignty is moving towards a climax. A world, growing to\nmaturity, must abandon this fetish, recognize the oneness and wholeness of\nhuman relationships, and establish once for all the machinery that can\nbest incarnate this fundamental principle of its life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAll contemporary forces of change validate this view. The proofs can be\ndiscerned in the many examples already cited of the favourable signs\ntowards world peace in current international movements and developments.\nThe army of men and women, drawn from virtually every culture, race and\nnation on earth, who serve the multifarious agencies of the United\nNations, represent a planetary \u00e2\u0080\u009ccivil service\u00e2\u0080\u009d whose impressive\naccomplishments are indicative of the degree of co-operation that can be\nattained even under discouraging conditions. An urge towards unity, like a\nspiritual springtime, struggles to express itself through countless\ninternational congresses that bring together people from a vast array of\ndisciplines. It motivates appeals for international projects involving\nchildren and youth. Indeed, it is the real source of the remarkable\nmovement towards ecumenism by which members of historically antagonistic\nreligions and sects seem irresistibly drawn towards one another. Together\nwith the opposing tendency to warfare and self-aggrandizement against\nwhich it ceaselessly struggles, the drive towards world unity is one of\nthe dominant, pervasive features of life on the planet during the closing\nyears of the twentieth century.\n\nThe experience of the Bah\u00c3\u00a1\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c3\u00ad community may be seen as an example of this\nenlarging unity. It is a community of some three to four million people\ndrawn from many nations, cultures, classes and creeds, engaged in a wide\nrange of activities serving the spiritual, social and economic needs of\nthe peoples of many lands. It is a single social organism, representative\nof the diversity of the human family, conducting its affairs through a\nsystem of commonly accepted consultative principles, and cherishing\nequally all the great outpourings of divine guidance in human history. Its\nexistence is yet another convincing proof of the practicality of its\nFounder\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vision of a united world, another evidence that humanity can\nlive as one global society, equal to whatever challenges its coming of age\nmay entail. If the Bah\u00c3\u00a1\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c3\u00ad experience can contribute in whatever measure to\nreinforcing hope in the unity of the human race, we are happy to offer it\nas a model for study.\n\nIn contemplating the supreme importance of the task now challenging the\nentire world, we bow our heads in humility before the awesome majesty of\nthe divine Creator, Who out of His infinite love has created all humanity\nfrom the same stock; exalted the gem-like reality of man; honoured it with\nintellect and wisdom, nobility and immortality; and conferred upon man the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cunique distinction and capacity to know Him and to love Him\u00e2\u0080\u009d, a capacity\nthat \u00e2\u0080\u009cmust needs be regarded as the generating impulse and the primary\npurpose underlying the whole of creation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe hold firmly the conviction that all human beings have been created \u00e2\u0080\u009cto\ncarry forward an ever-advancing civilization\u00e2\u0080\u009d; that \u00e2\u0080\u009cto act like the\nbeasts of the field is unworthy of man\u00e2\u0080\u009d; that the virtues that befit human\ndignity are trustworthiness, forbearance, mercy, compassion and\nloving-kindness towards all peoples. We reaffirm the belief that the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cpotentialities inherent in the station of man, the full measure of his\ndestiny on earth, the innate excellence of his reality, must all be\nmanifested in this promised Day of God.\u00e2\u0080\u009d These are the motivations for our\nunshakeable faith that unity and peace are the attainable goal towards\nwhich humanity is striving.\n\nAt this writing, the expectant voices of Bah\u00c3\u00a1\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c3\u00ads can be heard despite the\npersecution they still endure in the land in which their Faith was born.\nBy their example of steadfast hope, they bear witness to the belief that\nthe imminent realization of this age-old dream of peace is now, by virtue\nof the transforming effects of Bah\u00c3\u00a1\u00e2\u0080\u0099u\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\u00c3\u00a1h\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revelation, invested with the\nforce of divine authority. Thus we convey to you not only a vision in\nwords: we summon the power of deeds of faith and sacrifice; we convey the\nanxious plea of our co-religionists everywhere for peace and unity. We\njoin with all who are the victims of aggression, all who yearn for an end\nto conflict and contention, all whose devotion to principles of peace and\nworld order promotes the ennobling purposes for which humanity was called\ninto being by an all-loving Creator.\n\nIn the earnestness of our desire to impart to you the fervour of our hope\nand the depth of our confidence, we cite the emphatic promise of\nBah\u00c3\u00a1\u00e2\u0080\u0099u\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\u00c3\u00a1h: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese fruitless strifes, these ruinous wars shall pass away,\nand the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Most Great Peace\u00e2\u0080\u0099 shall come.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTHE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PROMISE OF WORLD PEACE***\n\n\n\nCREDITS\n\n\nJune 2006\n\n            Converted from Microsoft Word document format to TEI master\n            format.\n            Joshua Hutchinson\n\n\n\nA WORD FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG\n\n\nThis file should be named 19286-0.txt or 19286-0.zip.\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n\n\n    http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/1\/9\/2\/8\/19286\/\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the old editions will be\nrenamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no one\nowns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and\nyou!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission\nand without paying copyright royalties.

Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are\nparticularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.\nCompliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable\neffort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these\nrequirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not\nreceived written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or\ndetermine the status of compliance for any particular state visit\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have\nnot met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against\naccepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us\nwith offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the\nUnited States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods\nand addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including\nchecks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please\nvisit: http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.\n\n\n      General Information About Project Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 electronic works.\n\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with\nanyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2\neBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 eBooks are often created from several printed editions,\nall of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright\nnotice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance\nwith any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eBook\nnumber, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed\n(zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the\nold filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.\n_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n\n    http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2, including how\nto make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,\nhow to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email\nnewsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***FINIS***\n\f","id":7,"split":"train"}
