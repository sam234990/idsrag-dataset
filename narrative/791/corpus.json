MIDSHIPMAN EASY, BY CAPTAIN FREDERICK MARRYAT.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE.\n\nWHICH THE READER WILL FIND VERY EASY TO READ.\n\nMr Nicodemus Easy was a gentleman who lived down in Hampshire; he was a\nmarried man, and in very easy circumstances.  Most couples find it very\neasy to have a family, but not always quite so easy to maintain them.\nMr Easy was not at all uneasy on the latter score, as he had no\nchildren; but he was anxious to have them, as most people covet what\nthey cannot obtain.  After ten years, Mr Easy gave it up as a bad job.\nPhilosophy is said to console a man under disappointment, although\nShakespeare asserts that it is no remedy for toothache; so Mr Easy\nturned philosopher, the very best profession a man can take up, when he\nis fit for nothing else; he must be a very incapable person indeed who\ncannot talk nonsense.  For some time, Mr Easy could not decide upon\nwhat description his nonsense should consist of; at last he fixed upon\nthe rights of man, equality, and all that; how every person was born to\ninherit his share of the earth, a right at present only admitted to a\ncertain length that is about six feet, for we all inherit our graves,\nand are allowed to take possession without dispute.  But no one would\nlisten to Mr Easy's philosophy.  The women would not acknowledge the\nrights of men, whom they declared always to be in the wrong; and, as the\ngentlemen who visited Mr Easy were all men of property, they could not\nperceive the advantages of sharing with those who had none.  However,\nthey allowed him to discuss the question, while they discussed his port\nwine.  The wine was good, if the arguments were not, and we must take\nthings as we find them in this world.\n\nWhile Mr Easy talked philosophy, Mrs Easy played patience, and they\nwere a happy couple, riding side by side on their hobbies, and never\ninterfering with each other.  Mr Easy knew his wife could not\nunderstand him, and therefore did not expect her to listen very\nattentively; and Mrs Easy did not care how much her husband talked,\nprovided she was not put out in her game.  Mutual forbearance will\nalways ensure domestic felicity.\n\nThere was another cause for their agreeing so well.  Upon any disputed\nquestion Mr Easy invariably gave it up to Mrs Easy, telling her that\nshe should have her own way--and this pleased his wife; but, as Mr Easy\nalways took care, when it came to the point, to have his way, he was\npleased as well.  It is true that Mrs Easy had long found out that she\ndid not have her own way long; but she was of an easy disposition, and\nas, in nine cases out of ten, it was of very little consequence how\nthings were done, she was quite satisfied with his submission during the\nheat of the argument.  Mr Easy had admitted that she was right, and if\nlike all men he would do wrong, why what could a poor woman do?  With a\nlady of such a quiet disposition, it is easy to imagine that the\ndomestic felicity of Mr Easy was not easily disturbed.  But, as people\nhave observed before, there is a mutability in human affairs.  It was at\nthe finale of the eleventh year of their marriage that Mrs Easy at\nfirst complained that she could not enjoy her breakfast.  Mrs Easy had\nher own suspicions, everybody else considered it past doubt, all except\nMr Easy; he little \"thought, good easy man, that his greatness was\nripening;\" he had decided that to have an heir was no easy task, and it\nnever came into his calculations that there could be a change in his\nwife's figure.  You might have added to it, subtracted from it, divided\nit, or multiplied it, but as it was a zero, the result would be always\nthe same.  Mrs Easy also was not quite sure--she believed it might be\nthe case, there was no saying; it might be a mistake, like that of Mrs\nTrunnion's in the novel, and, therefore, she said nothing to her husband\nabout the matter.  At last Mr Easy opened his eyes, and when, upon\ninterrogating his wife, he found out the astounding truth, he opened his\neyes still wider, and then he snapped his fingers, and danced, like a\nbear upon hot plates, with delight, thereby proving that different\ncauses may produce similar effects in two instances at one and the same\ntime.  The bear dances from pain, Mr Easy from pleasure; and again,\nwhen we are indifferent, or do not care for anything, we snap our\nfingers at it, and when we are overjoyed and obtain what we most care\nfor, we also snap our fingers.  Two months after Mr Easy snapped his\nfingers, Mrs Easy felt no inclination to snap hers, either from\nindifference or pleasure.  The fact was, that Mrs Easy's time was come,\nto undergo what Shakespeare pronounces \"the pleasing punishment that\nwomen bear;\" but Mrs Easy, like the rest of her sex, declared, \"that\nall men were liars,\" and most particularly poets.\n\nBut while Mrs Easy was suffering, Mr Easy was in ecstasies.  He\nlaughed at pain, as all philosophers do when it is suffered by other\npeople, and not by themselves.\n\nIn due course of time, Mrs Easy presented her husband with a fine boy,\nwhom we present to the public as our hero.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO.\n\nIN WHICH MRS. EASY, AS USUAL, HAS HER OWN WAY.\n\nIt was the fourth day after Mrs Easy's confinement that Mr Easy, who\nwas sitting by her bedside in an easy-chair, commenced as follows: \"I\nhave been thinking, my dear Mrs Easy, about the name I shall give this\nchild.\"\n\n\"Name, Mr Easy! why, what name should you give it but your own?\"\n\n\"Not so, my dear,\" replied Mr Easy; \"they call all names proper names,\nbut I think that mine is not.  It is the very worst name in the\ncalendar.\"\n\n\"Why, what's the matter with it, Mr Easy?\"\n\n\"The matter affects me as well as the boy.  Nicodemus is a long name to\nwrite at full length, and Nick is vulgar.  Besides, as there will be two\nNicks, they will naturally call my boy young Nick, and of course I shall\nbe styled old Nick, which will be diabolical.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr Easy, at all events then let me choose the name.\"\n\n\"That you shall, my dear, and it was with this view that I have\nmentioned the subject so early.\"\n\n\"I think, Mr Easy, I will call the boy after my poor father--his name\nshall be Robert.\"\n\n\"Very well, my dear, if you wish it, it shall be Robert.  You shall have\nyour own way.  But I think, my dear, upon a little consideration, you\nwill acknowledge that there is a decided objection.\"\n\n\"An objection, Mr Easy?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear; Robert may be very well, but you must reflect upon the\nconsequences; he is certain to be called Bob.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear, and suppose they do call him Bob?\"\n\n\"I cannot bear even the supposition, my dear.  You forget the county in\nwhich we are residing, the downs covered with sheep.\"\n\n\"Why, Mr Easy, what can sheep have to do with a Christian name?\"\n\n\"There it is; women never look to consequences.  My dear, they have a\ngreat deal to do with the name of Bob.  I will appeal to any farmer in\nthe county, if ninety-nine shepherds' dogs out of one hundred are not\ncalled Bob.  Now observe, your child is out of doors somewhere in the\nfields or plantations; you want and you call him.  Instead of your\nchild, what do you find?  Why, a dozen curs at least, who come running\nup to you, all answering to the name of Bob, and wagging their stumps of\ntails.  You see, Mrs Easy, it is a dilemma not to be got over.  You\nlevel your only son to the brute creation by giving him a Christian name\nwhich, from its peculiar brevity, has been monopolised by all the dogs\nin the county.  Any other name you please, my dear, but in this one\ninstance you must allow me to lay my positive veto.\"\n\n\"Well, then, let me see--but I'll think of it, Mr Easy; my head aches\nvery much just now.\"\n\n\"I will think for you, my dear.  What do you say to John?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Mr Easy, such a common name?\"\n\n\"A proof of its popularity, my dear.  It is scriptural--we have the\napostle and the baptist--we have a dozen popes who were all Johns.  It\nis royal--we have plenty of kings who were Johns--and, moreover, it is\nshort, and sounds honest and manly.\"\n\n\"Yes, very true, my dear; but they will call him Jack.\"\n\n\"Well, we have had several celebrated characters who were Jacks.  There\nwas--let me see--Jack the Giant Killer, and Jack of the Bean Stalk--and\nJack--Jack--\"\n\n\"Jack Spratt,\" replied Mrs Easy.\n\n\"And Jack Cade, Mrs Easy, the great rebel--and three-fingered Jack,\nMrs Easy, the celebrated negro--and, above all, Jack Falstaff, ma'am,\nJack Falstaff--honest Jack Falstaff--witty Jack Falstaff--\"\n\n\"I thought, Mr Easy, that I was to be permitted to choose the name.\"\n\n\"Well, so you shall, my dear; I give it up to you.  Do just as you\nplease; but depend upon it that John is the right name.  Is it not now,\nmy dear?\"\n\n\"It's the way you always treat me, Mr Easy; you say that you give it\nup, and that I shall have my own way, but I never do have it.  I am sure\nthat the child will be christened John.\"\n\n\"Nay, my dear, it shall be just what you please.  Now I recollect it,\nthere were several Greek emperors who were Johns; but decide for\nyourself, my dear.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" replied Mrs Easy, who was ill, and unable to contend any\nlonger, \"I give it up, Mr Easy.  I know how it will be, as it always\nis: you give me my own way as people give pieces of gold to children,\nit's their own money, but they must not spend it.  Pray call him John.\"\n\n\"There, my dear, did not I tell you, you would be of my opinion upon\nreflection?  I knew you would.  I have given you your own way, and you\ntell me to call him John; so now we're both of the same mind, and that\npoint is settled.\"\n\n\"I should like to go to sleep, Mr Easy; I feel far from well.\"\n\n\"You shall always do just as you like, my dear,\" replied the husband,\n\"and have your own way in everything.  It is the greatest pleasure I\nhave when I yield to your wishes.  I will walk in the garden.  Good-bye,\nmy dear.\"\n\nMrs Easy made no reply, and the philosopher quitted the room.  As may\neasily be imagined, on the following day the boy was christened John.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THREE.\n\nIN WHICH OUR HERO HAS TO WAIT THE ISSUE OF AN ARGUMENT.\n\nThe reader may observe that, in general, all my first chapters are very\nshort, and increase in length as the work advances.  I mention this as a\nproof of my modesty and diffidence.  At first, I am like a young bird\njust out of its mother's nest, pluming my little feathers and taking\nshort flights.  By degrees I obtain more confidence, and wing my course\nover hill and dale.\n\nIt is very difficult to throw any interest into a chapter on childhood.\nThere is the same uniformity in all children until they develop.  We\ncannot, therefore, say much relative to Jack Easy's earliest days; he\nsucked and threw up his milk, while the nurse blessed it for a pretty\ndear, slept, and sucked again.  He crowed in the morning like a cock,\nscreamed when he was washed, stared at the candle, and made wry faces\nwith the wind.  Six months passed in these innocent amusements, and then\nhe was put into shorts.  But I ought here to have remarked, that Mrs\nEasy did not find herself equal to nursing her own infant, and it was\nnecessary to look out for a substitute.\n\nNow a commonplace person would have been satisfied with the\nrecommendation of the medical man, who looks but to the one thing\nneedful, which is a sufficient and wholesome supply of nourishment for\nthe child; but Mr Easy was a philosopher, and had latterly taken to\ncraniology, and he descanted very learnedly with the doctor upon the\neffect of his only son obtaining his nutriment from an unknown source.\n\"Who knows,\" observed Mr Easy, \"but that my son may not imbibe with his\nmilk the very worst passions of human nature.\"\n\n\"I have examined her,\" replied the doctor, \"and can safely recommend\nher.\"\n\n\"That examination is only preliminary to one more important,\" replied\nMr Easy.  \"I must examine her.\"\n\n\"Examine who, Mr Easy?\" exclaimed his wife, who had lain down again on\nthe bed.\n\n\"The nurse, my dear.\"\n\n\"Examine what, Mr Easy?\" continued the lady.\n\n\"Her head, my dear,\" replied the husband.  \"I must ascertain what her\npropensities are.\"\n\n\"I think you had better leave her alone, Mr Easy.  She comes this\nevening, and I shall question her pretty severely.  Dr Middleton, what\ndo you know of this young person?\"\n\n\"I know, madam, that she is very healthy and strong, or I should not\nhave selected her.\"\n\n\"But is her character good?\"\n\n\"Really, madam, I know little about her character; but you can make any\ninquiries you please.  But at the same time I ought to observe, that if\nyou are too particular in that point, you will have some difficulty in\nproviding yourself.\"\n\n\"Well, I shall see,\" replied Mrs Easy.\n\n\"And I shall feel,\" rejoined the husband.\n\nThis parleying was interrupted by the arrival of the very person in\nquestion, who was announced by the housemaid, and was ushered in.  She\nwas a handsome, florid, healthy-looking girl, awkward and naive in her\nmanner, and apparently not overwise; there was more of the dove than of\nthe serpent in her composition.\n\nMr Easy, who was very anxious to make his own discoveries, was the\nfirst who spoke.  \"Young woman, come this way, I wish to examine your\nhead.\"\n\n\"Oh! dear me, sir, it's quite clean, I assure you,\" cried the girl,\ndropping a curtsey.\n\nDr Middleton, who sat between the bed and Mr Easy's chair, rubbed his\nhands and laughed.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr Easy had untied the string and taken off the cap of\nthe young woman, and was very busy putting his fingers through her hair,\nduring which the face of the young woman expressed fear and\nastonishment.\n\n\"I am glad to perceive that you have a large portion of benevolence.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the young woman, dropping a curtsey.\n\n\"And veneration also.\"\n\n\"Thanky, sir.\"\n\n\"And the organ of modesty is strongly developed.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the girl, with a smile.\n\n\"That's quite a new organ,\" thought Dr Middleton.\n\n\"Philo-progenitiveness very powerful.\"\n\n\"If you please, sir, I don't know what that is,\" answered Sarah, with a\ncurtsey.\n\n\"Nevertheless you have given us a practical illustration.  Mrs Easy, I\nam satisfied.  Have you any questions to ask?  But it is quite\nunnecessary.\"\n\n\"To be sure, I have, Mr Easy.  Pray, young woman, what is your name?\"\n\n\"Sarah, if you please, ma'am.\"\n\n\"How long have you been married?\"\n\n\"Married, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Yes, married.\"\n\n\"If you please, ma'am, I had a misfortune, ma'am,\" replied the girl,\ncasting down her eyes.\n\n\"What, have you not been married?\"\n\n\"No, ma'am, not yet.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!  Dr Middleton, what can you mean by bringing this person\nhere?\" exclaimed Mrs Easy.  \"Not a married woman, and she has a child!\"\n\n\"If you please, ma'am,\" interrupted the young woman, dropping a curtsey,\n\"it was a very little one.\"\n\n\"A very little one!\" explained Mrs Easy.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, very small indeed, and died soon after it was born.\"\n\n\"Oh, Dr Middleton!--what could you mean, Dr Middleton?\"\n\n\"My dear madam,\" exclaimed the doctor, rising from his chair, \"this is\nthe only person that I could find suited to the wants of your child, and\nif you do not take her, I cannot answer for its life.  It is true that a\nmarried woman might be procured; but married women who have a proper\nfeeling will not desert their own children; and, as Mr Easy asserts,\nand you appear to imagine, the temper and disposition of your child may\nbe affected by the nourishment it receives, I think it more likely to be\ninjured by the milk of a married woman who will desert her own child for\nthe sake of gain.  The misfortune which has happened to this young woman\nis not always a proof of a bad heart, but of strong attachment, and the\noverweening confidence of simplicity.\"\n\n\"You are correct, doctor,\" replied Mr Easy, \"and her head proves that\nshe is a modest young woman, with strong religious feeling, kindness of\ndisposition, and every other requisite.\"\n\n\"The head may prove it all for what I know, Mr Easy, but her conduct\ntells another tale.\"\n\n\"She is well fitted for the situation, ma'am,\" continued the doctor.\n\n\"And if you please, ma'am,\" rejoined Sarah, \"it was _such a little\none_.\"\n\n\"Shall I try the baby, ma'am?\" said the monthly nurse, who had listened\nin silence.  \"It is fretting so, poor thing, and has its dear little\nfist right down its throat.\"\n\nDr Middleton gave the signal of assent, and in a few seconds Master\nJohn Easy was fixed to Sarah as tight as a leech.\n\n\"Lord love it, how hungry it is--there, there, stop it a moment, it's\nchoking, poor thing!\"\n\nMrs Easy, who was lying on her bed, rose up, and went to the child.\nHer first feeling was that of envy, that another should have such a\npleasure which was denied to herself, the next that of delight, at the\nsatisfaction expressed by the infant.  In a few minutes the child fell\nback in a deep sleep.  Mrs Easy was satisfied; maternal feelings\nconquered all others, and Sarah was duly installed.\n\nTo make short work of it, we have said that Jack Easy in six months was\nin shorts.  He soon afterwards began to crawl and show his legs; indeed,\nso indecorously, that it was evident that he had imbibed no modesty with\nSarah's milk, neither did he appear to have gained veneration or\nbenevolence, for he snatched at everything, squeezed the kitten to\ndeath, scratched his mother, and pulled his father by the hair;\nnotwithstanding all which, both his father and mother and the whole\nhousehold declared him to be the finest and sweetest child in the\nuniverse.  But if we were to narrate all the wonderful events of Jack's\nchildhood from the time of his birth up to the age of seven years, as\nchronicled by Sarah, who continued his dry nurse after he had been\nweaned, it would take at least three volumes folio.  Jack was brought up\nin the way that every only child usually is--that is, he was allowed to\nhave his own way.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOUR.\n\nIN WHICH THE DOCTOR PRESCRIBES GOING TO SCHOOL AS A REMEDY FOR A CUT\nFINGER.\n\n\"Have you no idea of putting the boy to school, Mr Easy?\" said Dr\nMiddleton, who had been summoned by a groom with his horse in a foam to\nattend immediately at Forest Hill, the name of Mr Easy's mansion, and\nwho, upon his arrival, had found that Master Easy had cut his thumb.\nOne would have thought that he had cut his head off by the agitation\npervading the whole household--Mr Easy walking up and down very uneasy,\nMrs Easy with great difficulty prevented from syncope, and all the\nmaids bustling and passing round Mrs Easy's chair.  Everybody appeared\nexcited except Master Jack Easy himself, who, with a rag round his\nfinger, and his pinafore spotted with blood, was playing at bob-cherry,\nand cared nothing about the matter.\n\n\"Well, what's the matter, my little man?\" said Dr Middleton, on\nentering, addressing himself to Jack, as the most sensible of the whole\nparty.\n\n\"Oh, Dr Middleton,\" interrupted Mrs Easy, \"he has cut his hand; I am\nsure that a nerve is divided, and then the lockjaw--\"\n\nThe doctor made no reply, but examined the finger: Jack Easy continued\nto play bob-cherry with his right hand.\n\n\"Have you such a thing as a piece of sticking-plaster in the house,\nmadam?\" observed the doctor, after examination.\n\n\"Oh, yes--run, Mary--run, Sarah!\"  In a few seconds the maids appeared,\nSarah bringing the sticking-plaster, and Mary following with the\nscissors.\n\n\"Make yourself quite easy, madam,\" said Dr Middleton, after he put on\nthe plaster, \"I will answer for no evil consequences.\"\n\n\"Had I not better take him upstairs, and let him lie down a little?\"\nreplied Mrs Easy, slipping a guinea into the doctor's hand.\n\n\"It is not absolutely requisite, madam,\" said the doctor; \"but at all\nevents he will be kept out of more mischief.\"\n\n\"Come, my dear, you hear what Dr Middleton says.\"\n\n\"Yes, I heard,\" replied Jack; \"but I shan't go.\"\n\n\"My dear Johnny--come, love--now do, my dear Johnny.\"\n\nJohnny played bob-cherry, and made no answer.\n\n\"Come, Master Johnny,\" said Sarah.\n\n\"Go away, Sarah,\" said Johnny, with a back-hander.\n\n\"Oh, fie, Master Johnny!\" said Mary.\n\n\"Johnny, my love,\" said Mrs Easy, in a coaxing tone, \"come now--will\nyou go?\"\n\n\"I'll go in the garden and get some more cherries,\" replied Master\nJohnny.\n\n\"Come, then, love, we will go into the garden.\"  Master Johnny jumped\noff his chair, and took his mamma by the hand.\n\n\"What a dear, good, obedient child it is!\" exclaimed Mrs Easy: \"you may\nlead him with a thread.\"\n\n\"Yes, to pick cherries,\" thought Dr Middleton.  Mrs Easy, and Johnny,\nand Sarah, and Mary went into the garden, leaving Dr Middleton alone\nwith Mr Easy, who had been silent during this scene.  Now Dr Middleton\nwas a clever, sensible man, who had no wish to impose upon any one.  As\nfor his taking a guinea for putting on a piece of sticking-plaster, his\nconscience was very easy on that score.  His time was equally valuable,\nwhether he were employed for something or nothing; and, moreover, he\nattended the poor gratis.  Constantly in the house, he had seen much of\nMr John Easy, and perceived that he was a courageous, decided boy, of a\nnaturally good disposition; but from the idiosyncrasy of the father and\nthe doting folly of the mother, in a sure way of being spoiled.  As\nsoon, therefore, as the lady was out of hearing, he took a chair, and\nmade the query at the commencement of the chapter, which we shall now\nrepeat.\n\n\"Have you no idea of putting the boy to school, Mr Easy?\"\n\nMr Easy crossed his legs, and clasped his hands together over his\nknees, as he always did when he was about to commence an argument.\n\n\"The great objection that I have to sending a boy to school, Dr\nMiddleton, is, that I conceive that the discipline enforced is, not only\ncontrary to the rights of man, but also in opposition to all sound sense\nand common judgment.  Not content with punishment, which is in itself\nerroneous and an infringement of social justice, they even degrade the\nminds of the boys still more by applying punishment to the most degraded\npart, adding contumely to tyranny.  Of course it is intended that a boy\nwho is sent to school should gain by precept and example but is he to\nlearn benevolence by the angry look and the flourish of the vindictive\nbirch--or forbearance by the cruelty of the ushers--or patience, when\nthe masters over him are out of all patience--or modesty, when his\nnether parts are exposed to general examination?  Is he not daily\nreading a lesson at variance with that equality which we all possess,\nbut of which we are unjustly deprived?  Why should there be a\ndistinction between the flogger and the flogged?  Are they not both\nfashioned alike after God's image, endowed with the same reason, having\nan equal right to what the world offers, and which was intended by\nProvidence to be equally distributed?  Is it not that the sacred\ninheritance of all, which has tyrannously and impiously been ravished\nfrom the many for the benefit of the few, and which ravishment, from\nlong custom of iniquity and inculcation of false precepts, has too long\nbeen basely submitted to?  Is it not the duty of a father to preserve\nhis only son from imbibing these dangerous and debasing errors, which\nwill render him only one of a vile herd who are content to suffer,\nprovided that they live?  And yet are not these very errors inculcated\nat school, and impressed upon their mind inversely by the birch?  Do not\nthey there receive their first lesson in slavery with the first lesson\nin A B C; and are not their minds thereby prostrated, so as never to\nrise again, but ever to bow to despotism, to cringe to rank, to think\nand act by the precepts of others, and to tacitly disavow that sacred\nequality which is our birthright?  No, sir, without they can teach\nwithout resorting to such a fundamental error as flogging, my boy shall\nnever go to school.\"\n\nAnd Mr Easy threw himself back in his chair, imagining, like all\nphilosophers, that he had said something very clever.\n\nDr Middleton knew his man, and therefore patiently waited until he had\nexhausted his oratory.\n\n\"I will grant,\" said the doctor at last, \"that all you say may have\ngreat truth in it; but, Mr Easy, do you not think that by not\npermitting a boy to be educated, you allow him to remain more open to\nthat very error of which you speak?  It is only education which will\nconquer prejudice, and enable a man to break through the trammels of\ncustom.  Now, allowing that the birch is used, yet it is at a period\nwhen the young mind is so elastic as to soon become indifferent; and\nafter he has attained the usual rudiments of education, you will then\nfind him prepared to receive those lessons which you can yourself\ninstil.\"\n\n\"I will teach him everything myself,\" replied Mr Easy, folding his arms\nconsequentially and determinedly.\n\n\"I do not doubt your capability, Mr Easy; but unfortunately you will\nalways have a difficulty which you never can get over.  Excuse me, I\nknow what you are capable of, and the boy would indeed be happy with\nsuch a preceptor, but--if I must speak plain--you must be aware as well\nas I am, that the maternal fondness of Mrs Easy will always be a bar to\nyour intention.  He is already so spoiled by her, that he will not obey;\nand without obedience you cannot inculcate.\"\n\n\"I grant, my dear sir, that there is a difficulty on that point; but\nmaternal weakness must then be overcome by paternal severity.\"\n\n\"May I ask how, Mr Easy, for it appears to be impossible?\"\n\n\"Impossible!  By heavens, I'll make him obey, or I'll--\" Here Mr Easy\nstopped before the word \"flog\" was fairly out of his mouth--\"I'll know\nthe reason why, Dr Middleton.\"\n\nDr Middleton checked his inclination to laugh, and replied, \"That you\nwould hit upon some scheme, by which you would obtain the necessary\npower over him, I have no doubt; but what will be the consequence?  The\nboy will consider his mother as a protector, and you as a tyrant.  He\nwill have an aversion to you, and with that aversion he will never pay\nrespect and attention to your valuable precepts when he arrives at an\nage to understand them.  Now it appears to me that this difficulty which\nyou have raised may be got over.  I know a very worthy clergyman who\ndoes not use the birch; but I will write, and put the direct question to\nhim; and then if your boy is removed from the danger arising from Mrs\nEasy's over-indulgence, in a short time he will be ready for your more\nimportant tuition.\"\n\n\"I think,\" replied Mr Easy, after a pause, \"that what you say merits\nconsideration.  I acknowledge that in consequence of Mrs Easy's\nnonsensical indulgence, the boy is unruly, and will not obey me at\npresent; and if your friend does not apply the rod, I will think\nseriously of sending my son John to him to learn the elements.\"\n\nThe doctor had gained his point by flattering the philosopher.\n\nIn a day he returned with a letter from the pedagogue in answer to one\nsupposed to be sent to him, in which the use of the birch was\nindignantly disclaimed, and Mr Easy announced to his wife, when they\nmet that day at tea-time, his intentions with regard to his son John.\n\n\"To school, Mr Easy? what, send Johnny to school! a mere infant to\nschool!\"\n\n\"Surely, my dear, you must be aware that at nine years it is high time\nthat he learned to read.\"\n\n\"Why he almost reads already, Mr Easy; surely I can teach him that.\nDoes he not, Sarah?\"\n\n\"Lord bless him, yes, ma'am, he was saying his letters yesterday.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr Easy, what can have put this in your head?  Johnny dear, come\nhere--tell me now what's the letter A.  You were singing it in the\ngarden this morning.\"\n\n\"I want some sugar,\" replied Johnny, stretching his arm over the table\nto the sugar-basin, which was out of his reach.\n\n\"Well, my love, you shall have a great lump if you will tell me what's\nthe letter A.\"\n\n\"A was an archer, and shot at a frog,\" replied Johnny, in a surly tone.\n\n\"There now, Mr Easy; and he can go through the whole alphabet--can't\nhe, Sarah?\"\n\n\"That he can, the dear--can't you, Johnny dear?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Johnny.\n\n\"Yes, you can, my love; you know what's the letter B.  Now don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Johnny.\n\n\"There, Mr Easy, you see what the boy knows, and how obedient he is\ntoo.  Come, Johnny dear, tell us what was B.\"\n\n\"No, I won't,\" replied Johnny, \"I want some more sugar;\" and Johnny, who\nhad climbed on a chair, spread himself over the table to reach it.\n\n\"Mercy!  Sarah, pull him off--he'll upset the urn,\" screamed Mrs Easy.\nSarah caught hold of Johnny by the loins to pull him back, but Johnny,\nresisting the interference, turned round on his back as he lay on the\ntable, and kicked Sarah in the face, just as she made another desperate\ngrasp at him.  The rebound from the kick, given as he lay on a smooth\nmahogany table, brought Johnny's head in contact with the urn, which was\nupset in the opposite direction, and, notwithstanding a rapid movement\non the part of Mr Easy, he received a sufficient portion of boiling\nliquid on his legs to scald him severely, and induce him to stamp and\nswear in a very unphilosophical way.  In the meantime Sarah and Mrs\nEasy had caught up Johnny, and were both holding him at the same time,\nexclaiming and lamenting.  The pain of the scald and the indifference\nshown towards him were too much for Mr Easy's temper to put up with.\nHe snatched Johnny out of their arms, and, quite forgetting his equality\nand rights of man, belaboured him without mercy.  Sarah flew in to\ninterfere, and received a blow which not only made her see a thousand\nstars, but sent her reeling on the floor.  Mrs Easy went off into\nhysterics, and Johnny howled so as to be heard at a quarter of a mile.\n\nHow long Mr Easy would have continued it is impossible to say; but the\ndoor opened, and Mr Easy looked up while still administering the\npunishment, and perceived Dr Middleton in mute astonishment.  He had\npromised to come in to tea, and enforce Mr Easy's arguments, if it were\nnecessary; but it certainly appeared to him that in the argument which\nMr Easy was then enforcing, he required no assistance.  However, at the\nentrance of Dr Middleton, Johnny was dropped, and lay roaring on the\nfloor; Sarah, too, remained where she had been floored, Mrs Easy had\nrolled on the floor, the urn was also on the floor, and Mr Easy,\nalthough not floored, had not a leg to stand upon.\n\nNever did a medical man look in more opportunely.  Mr Easy at first was\nnot certainly of that opinion, but his legs became so painful that he\nsoon became a convert.\n\nDr Middleton, as in duty bound, first picked up Mrs Easy, and laid her\non the sofa.  Sarah rose, picked up Johnny, and carried him kicking and\nroaring out of the room; in return for which attention she received\nsundry bites.  The footman, who had announced the doctor, picked up the\nurn, that being all that was in his department.  Mr Easy threw himself\npanting and in agony on the other sofa, and Dr Middleton was\nexcessively embarrassed how to act: he perceived that Mr Easy required\nhis assistance, and that Mrs Easy could do without it; but how to leave\na lady who was half really and half pretendedly in hysterics, was\ndifficult; for if he attempted to leave her, she kicked and flounced,\nand burst out the more.  At last Dr Middleton rang the bell, which\nbrought the footman, who summoned all the maids, who carried Mrs Easy\nupstairs, and then the doctor was able to attend to the only patient who\nreally required his assistance.  Mr Easy explained the affair in a few\nwords broken into ejaculations from pain, as the doctor removed his\nstockings.  From the applications of Dr Middleton, Mr Easy soon\nobtained bodily relief; but what annoyed him still more than his scalded\nlegs, was the doctor having been a witness to his infringement of the\nequality and rights of man.  Dr Middleton perceived this, and he knew\nalso how to pour balm into that wound.\n\n\"My dear Mr Easy, I am very sorry that you have had this accident, for\nwhich you are indebted to Mrs Easy's foolish indulgence of the boy; but\nI am glad to perceive that you have taken up those parental duties which\nare inculcated by the Scriptures.  Solomon says, `that he who spares the\nrod, spoils the child,' thereby implying that it is the duty of a father\nto correct his children, and in a father, the so doing does not\ninterfere with the rights of man, or any natural equality, for the son\nbeing a part or portion of the father, he is correcting his own self\nonly; and the proof of it is, that a father, in punishing his own son,\nfeels as much pain in so doing as if he were himself punished.  It is,\ntherefore, nothing but self-discipline, which is strictly enjoined us by\nthe Scriptures.\"\n\n\"That is exactly my opinion,\" replied Mr Easy, comforted at the doctor\nhaving so logically got him out of the scrape.  \"But--he shall go to\nschool tomorrow, that I'm determined on.\"\n\n\"He will have to thank Mrs Easy for that,\" replied the doctor.\n\n\"Exactly,\" replied Mr Easy.  \"Doctor, my legs are getting very hot\nagain.\"\n\n\"Continue to bathe them with the vinegar and water, Mr Easy, until I\nsend you an embrocation, which will give you immediate relief.  I will\ncall tomorrow.  By-the-bye, I am to see a little patient at Mr\nBonnycastle's: if it is any accommodation, I will take your son with\nme.\"\n\n\"It will be a great accommodation, doctor,\" replied Mr Easy.\n\n\"Then, my dear sir, I will just go up and see how Mrs Easy is, and\nto-morrow I will call at ten.  I can wait an hour.  Good-night.\"\n\n\"Good-night, doctor.\"\n\nThe doctor had his game to play with Mrs Easy.  He magnified her\nhusband's accident--he magnified his wrath, and advised her by no means\nto say one word, until he was well, and more pacified.  The next day he\nrepeated this dose, and, in spite of the ejaculations of Sarah, and the\ntears of Mrs Easy, who dared not venture to plead her cause, and the\nviolent resistance of Master Johnny, who appeared to have a presentiment\nof what was to come, our hero was put into Dr Middleton's chariot, and\nwith the exception of one plate of glass, which he kicked out of the\nwindow with his feet, and for which feat, the doctor, now that he had\nhim all to himself, boxed his ears till he was nearly blind, he was,\nwithout any further eventful occurrence, carried by the doctor's footman\ninto the parlour of Mr Bonnycastle.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIVE.\n\nJACK EASY IS SENT TO A SCHOOL AT WHICH THERE IS NO FLOGGING.\n\nMaster Jack had been plumped down in a chair by the doctor's servant,\nwho, as he quitted him, first looked at his own hands, from which the\nblood was drawn in several parts, and then at Master Jack, with his\nteeth closed and lips compressed, as much as to say, \"If I only dared,\nwould not I, that's all?\" and then walked out of the room, repaired to\nthe carriage at the front door, when he showed his hands to the\ncoachman, who looked down from his box in great commiseration, at the\nsame time fully sharing his fellow-servant's indignation.  But we must\nrepair to the parlour.  Dr Middleton ran over a newspaper, while Johnny\nsat on the chair all of a heap, looking like a lump of sulks, with his\nfeet on the upper front bar, and his knees almost up to his nose.  He\nwas a promising pupil, Jack.\n\nMr Bonnycastle made his appearance--a tall, well-built, handsome, fair\nman, with a fine powdered head, dressed in solemn black, and knee\nbuckles; his linen beautifully clean, and with a peculiar bland\nexpression of countenance.  When he smiled he showed a row of teeth\nwhite as ivory, and his mild blue eye was the _ne plus ultra_ of\nbeneficence.  He was the beau-ideal of a preceptor, and it was\nimpossible to see him and hear his mild pleasing voice, without wishing\nthat all your sons were under his protection.  He was a ripe scholar,\nand a good one, and at the time we speak of had the care of upwards of\none hundred boys.  He was celebrated for turning them out well, and many\nof his pupils were rising fast in the senate, as well as distinguishing\nthemselves in the higher professions.\n\nDr Middleton, who was on intimate terms with Bonnycastle, rose as he\nentered the room, and they shook hands.  Middleton then turned to where\nJack sat, and pointing to him, said, \"Look there.\"\n\nBonnycastle smiled.  \"I cannot say that I have had worse, but I have\nalmost as bad.  I will apply the Promethean torch, and soon vivify that\nrude mass.  Come, sit down, Middleton.\"\n\n\"But,\" said the doctor, as he resumed his chair, \"tell me, Bonnycastle,\nhow you will possibly manage to lick such a cub into shape, when you do\nnot resort to flogging?\"\n\n\"I have no opinion of flogging, and therefore I do not resort to it.\nThe fact is, I was at Harrow myself, and was rather a pickle.  I was\ncalled up as often as most boys in the school, and I perfectly recollect\nthat eventually I cared nothing for a flogging.  I had become\ncase-hardened.  It is the least effective part that you can touch a boy\nupon.  It leaves nothing behind to refresh their memory.\"\n\n\"I should have thought otherwise.\"\n\n\"My dear Middleton, I can produce more effect by one caning than twenty\nfloggings.  Observe, you flog upon a part for the most part quiescent;\nbut you cane upon all parts, from the head to the heels.  Now, when once\nthe first sting of the birch is over, then a dull sensation comes over\nthe part, and the pain after that is nothing; whereas a good sound\ncaning leaves sores and bruises in every part, and on all the parts\nwhich are required for muscular action.  After a flogging, a boy may run\nout in the hours of recreation, and join his playmates as well as ever,\nbut a good caning tells a very different tale; he cannot move one part\nof his body without being reminded for days by the pain of the\npunishment he has undergone, and he is very careful how he is called up\nagain.\"\n\n\"My dear sir, I really had an idea that you were excessively lenient,\"\nreplied Middleton, laughing; \"I am glad that I am under a mistake.\"\n\n\"Look at that cub, doctor, sitting there more like a brute than a\nreasonable being; do you imagine that I could ever lick it into shape\nwithout strong measures?  At the same time, allow me to say, that I\nconsider my system by far the best.  At the public schools, punishment\nis no check; it is so trifling that it is derided: with me punishment is\npunishment in the true sense of the word, and the consequence is, that\nit is much more seldom resorted to.\"\n\n\"You are a terrorist, Bonnycastle.\"\n\n\"The two strongest impulses in our nature are fear and love.  In theory,\nacting upon the latter is very beautiful; but in practice, I never found\nit to answer,--and for the best of reasons, our self-love is stronger\nthan our love for others.  Now I never yet found fear to fail, for the\nvery same reason that the other does, because with fear we act upon\nself-love, and nothing else.\"\n\n\"And yet we have many now who would introduce a system of schooling\nwithout correction; and who maintain that the present system is\ndegrading.\"\n\n\"There are a great many fools in this world, doctor.\"\n\n\"That reminds me of this boy's father,\" replied Dr Middleton; who then\ndetailed to the pedagogue the idiosyncrasy of Mr Easy, and all the\ncircumstances attending Jack being sent to his school.\n\n\"There is no time to be lost then, doctor.  I must conquer this young\ngentleman before his parents call to see him.  Depend upon it, in a week\nI will have him obedient and well broke in.\"\n\nDr Middleton wished Jack good-bye, and told him to be a good boy.  Jack\ndid not vouchsafe to answer.  \"Never mind, doctor, he will be more\npolished next time you call here, depend upon it,\" and the doctor\ndeparted.\n\nAlthough Mr Bonnycastle was severe, he was very judicious.  Mischief of\nall kinds was visited but by slender punishment, such as being kept in\nat play hours, etcetera; and he seldom interfered with the boys for\nfighting, although he checked decided oppression.  The great _sine qua\nnon_ with him was attention to their studies.  He soon discovered the\ncapabilities of his pupils, and he forced them accordingly; but the idle\nboy, the bird who \"could sing and wouldn't sing,\" received no mercy.\nThe consequence was, that he turned out the cleverest boys, and his\nconduct was so uniform and unvarying in its tenor, that if he was feared\nwhen they were under his control, he was invariably liked by those whom\nhe had instructed, and they continued his friends in after life.\n\nMr Bonnycastle at once perceived that it was no use coaxing our hero,\nand that fear was the only attribute by which he could be controlled.\nSo, as soon as Dr Middleton had quitted the room, he addressed him in a\ncommanding tone, \"Now, boy, what is your name?\"\n\nJack started; he looked up at his master, perceived his eye fixed upon\nhim, and a countenance not to be played with.  Jack was no fool, and\nsomehow or another, the discipline he had received from his father had\ngiven him some intimation of what was to come.  All this put together\ninduced Jack to condescend to answer, with his forefinger between his\nteeth, \"Johnny.\"\n\n\"And what is your other name, sir?\"\n\nJack, who appeared to repent his condescension, did not at first answer,\nbut he looked again in Mr Bonnycastle's face, and then round the room:\nthere was no one to help him, and he could not help himself, so he\nreplied \"Easy.\"\n\n\"Do you know why you are sent to school?\"\n\n\"Scalding father.\"\n\n\"No; you are sent to learn to read and write.\"\n\n\"But I won't read and write,\" replied Jack sulkily.\n\n\"Yes, you will and you are going to read your letters now directly.\"\n\nJack made no answer.  Mr Bonnycastle opened a sort of book-case, and\ndisplayed to John's astonished view a series of canes, ranged up and\ndown like billiard cues, and continued, \"Do you know what those are\nfor?\"\n\nJack eyed them wistfully; he had some faint idea that he was sure to be\nbetter acquainted with them but he made no answer.\n\n\"They are to teach little boys to read and write, and now I am going to\nteach you.  You'll soon learn.  Look now here,\" continued Mr\nBonnycastle, opening a book with large type, and taking a capital at the\nhead of a chapter, about half an inch long.  \"Do you see that letter?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Johnny, turning his eyes away, and picking his fingers.\n\n\"Well, that is the letter B.  Do you see it?  Look at it, so that you\nmay know it again.  That's the letter B.  Now tell me what that letter\nis.\"\n\nJack now determined to resist, so he made no answer.\n\n\"So you cannot tell; well, then, we will try what one of these little\nfellows will do,\" said Mr Bonnycastle, taking down a cane.  \"Observe,\nJohnny, that's the letter B.  Now, what letter is that?  Answer me\ndirectly.\"\n\n\"I won't learn to read and write.\"\n\nWhack came the cane on Johnny's shoulders, who burst out into a roar as\nhe writhed with pain.\n\nMr Bonnycastle waited a few seconds.  \"That's the letter B.  Now tell\nme, sir, directly, what that letter is.\"\n\n\"I'll tell my _mar_.\"  Whack!  \"O law!  O law!\"\n\n\"What letter is that?\"\n\nJohnny, with his mouth open, panting, and the tears on his cheeks,\nanswered indignantly, \"Stop till I tell Sarah.\"\n\nWhack came the cane again, and a fresh burst from Johnny.\n\n\"What letter's that?\"\n\n\"I won't tell,\" roared Johnny; \"I won't tell--that I won't.\"\n\nWhack--whack--whack, and a pause.  \"I told you before, that's the letter\nB.  What letter is that?  Tell me directly.\"\n\nJohnny, by way of reply, made a snatch at the cane.  Whack--he caught\nit, certainly, but not exactly as he would have wished.  Johnny then\nsnatched up the book, and dashed it to the corner of the room.  Whack,\nwhack.  Johnny attempted to seize Mr Bonnycastle with his teeth.\nWhack, whack, whack, whack; and Johnny fell on the carpet, and roared\nwith pain.  Mr Bonnycastle then left him for a little while, to recover\nhimself, and sat down.\n\nAt last Johnny's exclamations settled down in deep sobs, and then Mr\nBonnycastle said to him, \"Now, Johnny, you perceive that you must do as\nyou are bid, or else you will have more beating.  Get up immediately.\nDo you hear, sir?\"\n\nSomehow or another, Johnny, without intending it, stood upon his feet.\n\n\"That's a good boy; now you see, by getting up as you were bid, you have\nnot been beaten.  Now, Johnny, you must go and bring the book from where\nyou threw it down.  Do you hear, sir? bring it directly!\"\n\nJohnny looked at Mr Bonnycastle and the cane.  With every intention to\nrefuse, Johnny picked up the book and laid it on the table.\n\n\"That's a good boy; now we will find the letter B.  Here it is: now,\nJohnny, tell me what that letter is.\"\n\nJohnny made no answer.\n\n\"Tell me directly, sir,\" said Mr Bonnycastle, raising his cane up in\nthe air.  The appeal was too powerful.  Johnny eyed the cane; it moved,\nit was coming.  Breathlessly he shrieked out, \"B!\"\n\n\"Very well indeed, Johnny--very well.  Now your first lesson is over,\nand you shall go to bed.  You have learned more than you think for.\nTo-morrow we will begin again.  Now we'll put the cane by.\"\n\nMr Bonnycastle rang the bell, and desired Master Johnny to be put to\nbed, in a room by himself, and not to give him any supper, as hunger\nwould, the next morning, much facilitate his studies.  Pain and hunger\nalone will tame brutes, and the same remedy must be applied to conquer\nthose passions in man which assimilate him with brutes.  Johnny was\nconducted to bed, although it was but six o'clock.  He was not only in\npain, but his ideas were confused; and no wonder, after all his life\nhaving been humoured and indulged--never punished until the day before.\nAfter all the caresses of his mother and Sarah, which he never knew the\nvalue of--after stuffing himself all day long, and being tempted to eat\ntill he turned away in satiety, to find himself without his mother,\nwithout Sarah, without supper--covered with weals, and, what was worse\nthan all, without his own way.  No wonder Johnny was confused; at the\nsame time that he was subdued; and, as Mr Bonnycastle had truly told\nhim, he had learned more than he had any idea of.  And what would Mrs\nEasy have said, had she known all this--and Sarah too?  And Mr Easy,\nwith his rights of man?  At the very time that Johnny was having the\ndevil driven out of him, they were consoling themselves with the idea,\nthat, at all events, there was no birch used at Mr Bonnycastle's, quite\nlosing sight of the fact, that as there are more ways of killing a dog\nbesides hanging him, so are there more ways of teaching than _a\nposteriori_.  Happy in their ignorance, they all went fast asleep,\nlittle dreaming that Johnny was already so far advanced in knowledge as\nto have a tolerable comprehension of the _mystery of cane_.  As for\nJohnny, he had cried himself to sleep at least six hours before them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX.\n\nIN WHICH JACK MAKES ESSAY OF HIS FATHER'S SUBLIME PHILOSOPHY AND ARRIVES\nVERY NEAR TO TRUTH AT LAST.\n\nThe next morning Master Jack Easy was not only very sore but very\nhungry, and as Mr Bonnycastle informed him that he would not only have\nplenty of cane, but also no breakfast, if he did not learn his letters,\nJohnny had wisdom enough to say the whole alphabet, for which he\nreceived a great deal of praise, the which if he did not duly\nappreciate, he at all events infinitely preferred to beating.  Mr\nBonnycastle perceived that he had conquered the boy by one hour's\nwell-timed severity.  He therefore handed him over to the ushers in the\nschool, and as they were equally empowered to administer the needful\nimpulse, Johnny very soon became a very tractable boy.\n\nIt may be imagined that the absence of Johnny was severely felt at home,\nbut such was not the case.  In the first place, Dr Middleton had\npointed out to Mrs Easy that there was no flogging at the school, and\nthat the punishment received by Johnny from his father would very likely\nbe repeated--and in the next, although Mrs Easy thought that she never\ncould have survived the parting with her own son, she soon found out\nthat she was much happier without him.  A spoiled child is always a\nsource of anxiety and worry, and after Johnny's departure, Mrs Easy\nfound a quiet and repose much more suited to her disposition.  Gradually\nshe weaned herself from him, and, satisfied with seeing him occasionally\nand hearing the reports of Dr Middleton, she at last was quite\nreconciled to his being at school, and not coming back except during the\nholidays.  John Easy made great progress; he had good natural abilities,\nand Mr Easy rubbed his hands when he saw the doctor, saying, \"Yes, let\nthem have him for a year or two longer, and then I'll finish him\nmyself.\"  Each vacation he had attempted to instil into Johnny's mind\nthe equal rights of man.  Johnny appeared to pay but little attention to\nhis father's discourses, but evidently showed that they were not\naltogether thrown away, as he helped himself to everything he wanted,\nwithout asking leave.  And thus was our hero educated until he arrived\nat the age of sixteen, when he was a stout, good-looking boy, with\nplenty to say for himself,--indeed, when it suited his purpose, he could\nouttalk his father.\n\nNothing pleased Mr Easy so much as Jack's loquacity.--\"That's right;\nargue the point, Jack--argue the point, boy,\" would he say, as Jack\ndisputed with his mother.  And then he would turn to the doctor, rubbing\nhis hands, and observe, \"Depend upon it, Jack will be a great, a very\ngreat man.\"  And then he would call Jack and give him a guinea for his\ncleverness; and at last Jack thought it a very clever thing to argue.\nHe never would attempt to argue with Mr Bonnycastle, because he was\naware that Mr Bonnycastle's arguments were too strong for him, but he\nargued with all the boys until it ended in a fight which decided the\npoint; and he sometimes argued with the ushers.  In short, at the time\nwe now speak of, which was at the breaking up of the Midsummer holidays,\nJack was as full of argument as he was fond of it.  He would argue the\npoint to the point of a needle, and he would divide that point into as\nmany as there were days of the year, and argue upon each.  In short,\nthere was no end to Jack's arguing the point, although there seldom was\npoint to his argument.\n\nJack had been fishing in the river, without any success, for a whole\nmorning, and observed a large pond which had the appearance of being\nwell stocked--he cleared the park palings, and threw in his line.  He\nhad pulled up several fine fish, when he was accosted by the proprietor,\naccompanied by a couple of keepers.\n\n\"May I request the pleasure of your name, young gentleman?\" said the\nproprietor to Jack.\n\nNow Jack was always urbane and polite.\n\n\"Certainly, sir; my name is Easy, very much at your service.\"\n\n\"And you appear to me to be taking it very easy,\" replied the gentleman.\n\"Pray, sir, may I inquire whether you are aware that you are\ntrespassing?\"\n\n\"The word trespass, my dear sir,\" replied Jack, \"will admit of much\nargument, and I will divide it into three heads.  It implies, accordng\nto the conventional meaning, coming without permission upon the land or\nproperty of another.  Now, sir, the question may all be resolved in the\nfollowing.  Was not the world made for all? and has any one, or any\nportion of its inhabitants an exclusive right to claim any part of it,\nas his property?  If you please, I have laid down the proposition, and\nwe will now argue the point.\"\n\nThe gentleman who accosted Jack had heard of Mr Easy and his arguments;\nhe was a humorist, and more inclined to laugh than to be angry; at the\nsame time he considered it necessary to show Jack that under existing\ncircumstances they were not tenable.\n\n\"But, Mr Easy, allowing the trespass on the property to be venial,\nsurely you do not mean to say that you are justified in taking my fish;\nI bought the fish, and stocked the pond, and have fed them ever since.\nYou cannot deny but that they are private property, and that to take\nthem is a theft?\"\n\n\"That will again admit of much ratiocination, my dear sir,\" replied\nJack; \"but--I beg your pardon, I have a fish.\"  Jack pulled up a large\ncarp, much to the indignation of the keepers and to the amusement of\ntheir master, unhooked it, placed it in his basket, renewed his bait\nwith the greatest _sang froid_, and then throwing in his line, resumed\nhis discourse.  \"As I was observing, my dear sir,\" continued Jack, \"that\nwill admit of much ratiocination.  All the creatures of the earth were\ngiven to man for his use--man means mankind--they were never intended to\nbe made a monopoly of.  Water is also the gift of heaven, and meant for\nthe use of all.  We now come to the question how far the fish are your\nproperty.  If the fish only bred on purpose to please you, and make you\na present of their stock, it might then require a different line of\nargument; but as in breeding they only acted in obedience to an instinct\nwith which they are endowed on purpose that they may supply man, I\nsubmit to you that you cannot prove these fish to be yours more than\nmine.  As for feeding with the idea that they were your own, that is not\nan unusual case in this world, even when a man is giving bread and\nbutter to his children.  Further--but I have another bite--I beg your\npardon, my dear sir.  Ah! he's off again--\"\n\n\"Then, Mr Easy, you mean to say that the world and its contents are\nmade for all.\"\n\n\"Exactly, sir, that is my father's opinion, who is a very great\nphilosopher.\"\n\n\"How then does your father account for some possessing property and\nothers being without it?\"\n\n\"Because those who are the strongest have deprived those who are\nweaker.\"\n\n\"But would not that be always the case even if we were in that state of\ngeneral inheritance which you have supposed.  For instance, allowing two\nmen to chase the same animal, and both to come up to it at the same\ntime, would not the strongest bear it off?\"\n\n\"I grant that, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, then, where is your equality?\"\n\n\"That does not disprove that men were not intended to be equal; it only\nproves that they are not so.  Neither does it disprove that everything\nwas not made for the benefit of all; it only proves that the strong will\ntake advantage of the weak, which is very natural.\"\n\n\"Oh! you grant that to be very natural.--Well, Mr Easy, I am glad to\nperceive that we are of one mind, and I trust we shall continue so.\nYou'll observe that I and my keepers being three, we are the strong\nparty in this instance, and admitting your argument, that the fish are\nas much yours as mine, still I take advantage of my strength to\nrepossess myself of them, which is, as you say, very natural.--James,\ntake those fish.\"\n\n\"If you please,\" interrupted Jack, \"we will argue that point--\"\n\n\"Not at all; I will act according to your own arguments--I have the\nfish, but I now mean to have more--that fishing-rod is as much mine as\nyours, and being the stronger party, I will take possession of it.--\nJames, William, take that fishing-rod--it is ours.\"\n\n\"I presume you will first allow me to observe,\" replied Jack, \"that\nalthough I have expressed my opinion that the earth and the animals on\nit were made for us all, that I never yet have asserted that what a man\ncreates by himself, or has created for him for a consideration, is not\nhis own property.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon; the trees that that rod was made from were made for\nus all, and if you, or any one for you, have thought proper to make it\ninto a rod, it is no more my fault than it is that I have been feeding\nthe fish with the supposition that they were my own.  Everything being\ncommon, and it being but natural that the strong should take advantage\nof the weak, I must take that rod as my property, until I am\ndispossessed by one more powerful.  Moreover, being the stronger party,\nand having possession of this land, which you say does not belong to me\nmore than to you--I also shall direct my keepers to see you off this\nproperty.  James, take the rod--see Mr Easy over the park palings.  Mr\nEasy, I wish you a good morning.\"\n\n\"Sir, I beg your pardon, you have not yet heard all my arguments,\"\nreplied Jack, who did not approve of the conclusions drawn.\n\n\"I have no time to hear more, Mr Easy: I wish you a good morning.\"  And\nthe proprietor departed, leaving Jack in company with the keepers.\n\n\"I'll trouble you for that rod, master,\" said William.  James was very\nbusy stringing the fish through the gills upon a piece of osier.\n\n\"At all events you will hear reason,\" said Jack.  \"I have arguments--\"\n\n\"I never heard no good arguments in favour of poaching,\" interrupted the\nkeeper.\n\n\"You're an insolent fellow,\" replied Jack.  \"It is by paying such\nvagabonds as you that people are able to be guilty of injustice.\"\n\n\"It's by paying us that the land an't poached--and if there be some\nexcuse for a poor devil who is out of work, there be none for you, who\ncall yourself a gentleman.\"\n\n\"According to his 'count, as we be all equal, he be no more a gentleman\nthan we be.\"\n\n\"Silence, you blackguard, I shall not condescend to argue with such as\nyou: if I did I could prove that you are a set of base slaves, who have\njust as much right to this property as your master or I have.\"\n\n\"As you have, I dare say, master.\"\n\n\"As I have, you scoundrel; this pond is as much my property, and so are\nthe fish in it, as they are of your master, who has usurped the right.\"\n\n\"I say, James, what do you say, shall we put the young gentleman in\npossession of his property?\" said William, winking to the other.\n\nWilliam took the hint; they seized Jack by the arms and legs, and soused\nhim into the pond.  Jack arose after a deep submersion, and floundered\non shore blowing and spluttering.  But in the meantime the keepers had\nwalked away, carrying with them the rod and line, fish, and tin-can of\nbait, laughing loudly at the practical joke which they had played our\nhero.\n\n\"Well,\" thought Jack, \"either here must be some mistake in my father's\nphilosophy, or else this is a very wicked world.  I shall submit this\ncase to my father.\"\n\nAnd Jack received this reply--\"I have told you before, Jack, that these\nimportant truths will not at present be admitted--but it does not the\nless follow that they are true.  This is the age of iron, in which might\nhas become right--but the time will come when these truths will be\nadmitted, and your father's name will be more celebrated than that of\nany philosopher of ancient days.  Recollect, Jack, that although in\npreaching against wrong and advocating the rights of man, you will be\ntreated as a martyr, it is still your duty to persevere; and if you are\ndragged through all the horse-ponds in the kingdom, never give up your\nargument.\"\n\n\"That I never will, sir,\" replied Jack; \"but the next time I argue it\nshall be, if possible, with power on my side, and, at all events, not\nquite so near a pond.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Mrs Easy, who had been a silent listener, \"that Jack\nhad better fish in the river, and then, if he catches no fish, at all\nevents he will not be soused in the water, and spoil his clothes.\"\n\nBut Mrs Easy was no philosopher.\n\nA few days afterwards, Jack discovered, one fine morning, on the other\nside of a hedge, a summer apple-tree bearing tempting fruit, and he\nimmediately broke through the hedge, and climbing the tree, as our first\nmother did before him, he culled the fairest and did eat.\n\n\"I say, you sir, what are you doing there?\" cried a rough voice.\n\nJack looked down, and perceived a stout, thick-set personage in grey\ncoat and red waistcoat, standing underneath him.\n\n\"Don't you see what I'm about,\" replied Jack, \"I'm eating apples--shall\nI throw you down a few?\"\n\n\"Thank you kindly--the fewer that are pulled the better; perhaps, as you\nare so free to give them to others as well as to help yourself, you may\nthink that they are your own property!\"\n\n\"Not a bit more my property than they are yours, my good man.\"\n\n\"I guess that's something like the truth; but you are not quite at the\ntruth yet, my lad; those apples are mine, and I'll trouble you to come\ndown as fast as you please; when you're down we can then settle our\naccounts; and,\" continued the man, shaking his cudgel, \"depend upon it\nyou shall have your receipt in full.\"\n\nJack did not much like the appearance of things.\n\n\"My good man,\" said he, \"it is quite a prejudice on your part to imagine\nthat apples were not given, as well as all other fruit, for the benefit\nof us all--they are common property, believe me.\"\n\n\"That's a matter of opinion, my lad, and I may be allowed to have my\nown.\"\n\n\"You'll find it in the Bible,\" says Jack.\n\n\"I never did yet, and I've read it through and through all, bating the\n'Pocryfar.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Jack, \"go home and fetch the Bible, and I'll prove it to\nyou.\"\n\n\"I suspect you'll not wait till I come back again.  No, no; I have lost\nplenty of apples, and have long wanted to find the robbers out; now I've\ncaught one I'll take care that he don't 'scape without apple-sauce, at\nall events--so come down, you young thief, come down directly--or it\nwill be all the worse for you.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Jack, \"but I am very well here.  I will, if you\nplease, argue the point from where I am.\"\n\n\"I've no time to argue the point, my lad; I've plenty to do, but do not\nthink I'll let you off.  If you don't choose to come down, why then you\nmay stay there, and I'll answer for it, as soon as work is done I shall\nfind you safe enough.\"\n\n\"What can be done,\" thought Jack, \"with a man who will not listen to\nargument?  What a world is this!--however, he'll not find me here when\nhe comes back, I've a notion.\"\n\nBut in this Jack was mistaken.  The farmer walked to the hedge, and\ncalled to a boy, who took his orders and ran to the farm-house.  In a\nminute or two a large bull-dog was seen bounding along the orchard to\nhis master.  \"Mark him, Caesar,\" said the farmer to the dog, \"mark him.\"\nThe dog crouched down on the grass, with his head up, and eyes glaring\nat Jack, showing a range of teeth, that drove all our hero's philosophy\nout of his head.\n\n\"I can't wait here, but Caesar can, and I will tell you, as a friend,\nthat if he gets hold of you, he'll not leave a limb of you together--\nwhen work's done I'll come back.\"  So saying, the farmer walked off,\nleaving Jack and the dog to argue the point, if so inclined.  What a sad\njade must philosophy be, to put her votaries in such predicaments!\n\nAfter a while the dog laid his head down and closed his eyes as if\nasleep, but Jack observed, that at the least movement on his part one\neye was seen to partially unclose; so Jack, like a prudent man, resolved\nto remain where he was.  He picked a few more apples, for it was his\ndinner-time, and as he chewed he ruminated.\n\nJack had been but a few minutes ruminating before he was interrupted by\nanother ruminating animal, no less a personage than a bull, who had been\nturned out with full possession of the orchard, and who now advanced,\nbellowing occasionally, and tossing his head at the sight of Caesar,\nwhom he considered as much a trespasser as his master had our hero.\nCaesar started on his legs and faced the bull, who advanced pawing, with\nhis tail up in the air.  When within a few yards the bull made a rush at\nthe dog, who evaded him and attacked him in return, and thus did the\nwarfare continue until the opponents were already at some distance from\nthe apple-tree.  Jack prepared for immediate flight, but unfortunately\nthe combat was carried on by the side of the hedge at which Jack had\ngained admission.  Never mind, thought Jack, there are two sides to\nevery field, and although the other hedge joined on to the garden near\nto the farm-house, there was no option.  \"At all events,\" said Jack,\n\"I'll try it.\"  Jack was slipping down the trunk, when he heard a\ntremendous roar; the bull-dog had been tossed by the bull; he was then\nhigh in the air, and Jack saw him fall on the other side of the hedge;\nand the bull was thus celebrating his victory with a flourish of\ntrumpets.  Upon which Jack, perceiving that he was relieved from his\nsentry, slipped down the rest of the tree and took to his heels.\nUnfortunately for Jack, the bull saw him, and, flushed with victory, he\nimmediately set up another roar, and bounded after Jack.  Jack perceived\nhis danger, and fear gave him wings; he not only flew over the orchard,\nbut he flew over the hedge, which was about five feet high, just as the\nbull drove his head into it.  \"Look before you leap,\" is an old proverb.\nHad Jack done so, he would have done better; but as there were cogent\nreasons to be offered in extenuation of our philosopher, we shall say no\nmore, but merely state that Jack, when he got on the other side of the\nhedge, found that he had pitched into a small apiary, and had upset two\nhives of bees, who resented the intrusion; and Jack had hardly time to\nget upon his legs before he found them very busy stinging him in all\nquarters.  All that Jack could do was to run for it, but the bees flew\nfaster than he could run, and Jack was mad with pain, when he stumbled,\nhalf-blinded, over the brickwork of a well.  Jack could not stop his\npitching into the well, but he seized the iron chain as it struck him\nacross the face.  Down went Jack, and round went the windlass, and after\na rapid descent of forty feet our hero found himself under water, and no\nlonger troubled with the bees, who, whether they had lost scent of their\nprey from his rapid descent, or being notoriously clever insects,\nacknowledged the truth of the adage, \"leave well alone,\" had certainly\nleft Jack with no other companion than Truth.  Jack rose from his\nimmersion, and seized the rope to which the chain of the bucket was made\nfast--it had all of it been unwound from the windlass, and therefore it\nenabled Jack to keep his head above water.  After a few seconds Jack\nfelt something against his legs, it was the bucket, about two feet under\nthe water; Jack put his feet into it and found himself pretty\ncomfortable, for the water, after the sting of the bees and the heat he\nhad been put into by the race with the bull, was quite cool and\nrefreshing.\n\n\"At all events,\" thought Jack, \"if it had not been for the bull, I\nshould have been watched by the dog, and then thrashed by the farmer;\nbut then again, if it had not been for the bull, I should not have\ntumbled among the bees; and if it had not been for the bees, I should\nnot have tumbled into the well; and if it had not been for the chain, I\nshould have been drowned.  Such has been the chain of events, all\nbecause I wanted to eat an apple.\"\n\n\"However, I have got rid of the farmer, and the dog, and the bull, and\nthe bees--all's well that ends well but how the devil am I to get out of\nthe well?--All creation appears to have conspired against the rights of\nman.  As my father said, this is an iron age, and here I am swinging to\nan iron chain.\"\n\nWe have given the whole of Jack's soliloquy, as it will prove that Jack\nwas no fool, although he was a bit of a philosopher; and a man who could\nreason so well upon cause and effect, at the bottom of a well up to his\nneck in water, showed a good deal of presence of mind.  But if Jack's\nmind had been a little twisted by his father's philosophy, it had still\nsufficient strength and elasticity to recover itself in due time.  Had\nJack been a common personage, we should never have selected him for our\nhero.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\n\nIN WHICH JACK MAKES SOME VERY SAGE REFLECTIONS, AND COMES TO A VERY\nUNWISE DECISION.\n\nAfter all, it must be acknowledged that although there are cases of\ndistress in which a well may become a place of refuge, a well is not at\nall calculated for a prolonged residence--so thought Jack.  After he had\nbeen there some fifteen minutes, his teeth chattered, and his limbs\ntrembled; he felt a numbness all over, and he thought it high time to\ncall for assistance, which at first he would not, as he was afraid he\nshould be pulled up to encounter the indignation of the farmer and his\nfamily.  Jack was arranging his jaws for a halloo, when he felt the\nchain pulled up, and he slowly emerged from the water.  At first he\nheard complaints of the weight of the bucket, at which Jack was not\nsurprised, then he heard a tittering and laughing between two parties,\nand soon afterwards he mounted up gaily.  At last his head appeared\nabove the low wall, and he was about to extend his arms so as to secure\na position on it, when those who were working at the windlass beheld\nhim.  It was a heavy farming-man and a maid-servant.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Jack.\n\nOne never should be too quick in returning thanks; the girl screamed and\nlet go the winch; the man, frightened, did not hold it fast: it slipped\nfrom his grasp, whirled round, struck him under the chin and threw him\nover it headlong, and before the \"Thank you\" was fairly out of Jack's\nlips, down he went again like lightning to the bottom.  Fortunately for\nJack, he had not yet let go the chain, or he might have struck the sides\nand have been killed; as it was, he was merely soused a second time, and\nin a minute or two regained his former position.\n\n\"This is mighty pleasant,\" thought Jack, as he clapped his wet hat once\nmore on his head: \"at all events, they can't now plead ignorance; they\nmust know that I'm here.\"\n\nIn the meantime the girl ran into the kitchen, threw herself down on a\nstool, from which she reeled off in a fit upon sundry heaps of dough\nwaiting to be baked in the oven, which were laid to rise on the floor\nbefore the fire.\n\n\"Mercy on me, what is the matter with Susan?\" exclaimed the farmer's\nwife.  \"Here--where's Mary--where's John?--Deary me, if the bread won't\nall be turned to pancakes.\"\n\nJohn soon followed, holding his under-jaw in his hand, looking very\ndismal and very frightened, for two reasons; one, because he thought\nthat his jaw was broken, and the other, because he thought he had seen\nthe devil.\n\n\"Mercy on us, what is the matter?\" exclaimed the farmer's wife again.\n\"Mary, Mary, Mary!\" screamed she, beginning to be frightened herself,\nfor with all her efforts she could not remove Susan from the bed of\ndough, where she lay senseless and heavy as lead.  Mary answered to her\nmistress's loud appeal, and with her assistance they raised up Susan;\nbut as for the bread, there was no hopes of it ever rising again.  \"Why\ndon't you come here and help Susan, John?\" cried Mary.\n\n\"Aw-yaw-aw!\" was all the reply of John, who had had quite enough of\nhelping Susan, and who continued to hold his head, as it were, in his\nhand.\n\n\"What's the matter here, missus?\" exclaimed the farmer, coming in.\n\"Highty-tighty, what ails Susan, and what ails you?\" continued the\nfarmer, turning to John.  \"Dang it, but everything seems to go wrong\nthis blessed day.  First there be all the apples stolen--then there be\nall the hives turned topsy-turvy in the garden--then there be Caesar\nwith his flank opened by the bull--then there be the bull broken through\nthe hedge and tumbled into the saw-pit--and now I come to get more help\nto drag him out, I find one woman dead like, and John looks as if he had\nseen the devil.\"\n\n\"Aw-yaw-aw!\" replied John, nodding his head very significantly.\n\n\"One would think that the devil had broke loose to-day.  What is it,\nJohn?  Have you seen him, and has Susan seen him?\"\n\n\"Aw-yaw.\"\n\n\"He's stopped your jaw, then, at all events, and I thought the devil\nhimself wouldn't have done that--we shall get nothing of you.  Is that\nwench coming to her senses?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, she's better now.--Susan, what's the matter?\"\n\n\"Oh, oh, ma'am! the well, the well--\"\n\n\"The well!  Something wrong there, I suppose: well, I will go and see.\"\n\nThe farmer trotted off to the well; he perceived the bucket was at the\nbottom and all the rope out; he looked about him, and then he looked\ninto the well.  Jack, who had become very impatient, had been looking up\nsome time for the assistance which he expected would have come sooner;\nthe round face of the farmer occasioned a partial eclipse of the round\ndisc which bounded his view, just as one of the satellites of Jupiter\nsometimes obscures the face of the planet round which he revolves.\n\n\"Here I am,\" cried Jack, \"get me up quick, or I shall be dead;\" and what\nJack said was true, for he was quite done up by having been so long\ndown, although his courage had not failed him.\n\n\"Dang it, but there be somebody fallen into the well,\" cried the farmer;\n\"no end to mishaps this day.  Well, we must get a Christian out of a\nwell afore we get a bull out of a saw-pit, so I'll go call the men.\"\n\nIn a very short time the men who were assembled round the saw-pit were\nbrought to the well.\n\n\"Down below there, hold on now.\"\n\n\"Never fear,\" cried Jack.\n\nAway went the winch, and once more Jack had an extended horizon to\nsurvey.  As soon as he was at the top, the men hauled him over the\nbricks and laid him down upon the ground, for Jack's strength had failed\nhim.\n\n\"Dang it, if it bean't that chap who was on my apple-tree,\" cried the\nfarmer--\"howsomever, he must not die for stealing a few apples; lift him\nup, lads, and take him in--he is dead with cold--no wonder.\"\n\nThe farmer led the way, and the men carried Jack into the house, when\nthe farmer gave him a glass of brandy; this restored Jack's circulation,\nand in a short time he was all right again.\n\nAfter some previous conversation, in which Jack narrated all that had\nhappened, \"What may be your name?\" inquired the farmer.\n\n\"My name is Easy,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"What, be you the son of Mr Easy, of Forest Hill?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Dang it, he be my landlord, and a right good landlord too--why didn't\nyou say so when you were up in the apple-tree?  You might have picked\nthe whole orchard and welcome.\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" replied Jack, who had taken a second glass of brandy, and\nwas quite talkative again, \"let this be a warning to you, and when a man\nproposes to argue the point, always, in future, listen.  Had you waited,\nI would have proved to you most incontestably that you had no more right\nto the apples than I had; but you would not listen to argument, and\nwithout discussion we can never arrive at truth.  You send for your dog,\nwho is ripped up by the bull--the bull breaks his leg in a saw-pit--the\nbee-hives are overturned and you lose all your honey--your man John\nbreaks his jaw--your maid Susan spoils all the bread--and why? because\nyou would not allow me to argue the point.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr Easy, it be all true that all these mishaps have happened\nbecause I would not allow you to argue the point, perhaps, although, as\nI rent the orchard from your father, I cannot imagine how you could have\nproved to me that the apples were not mine; but now, let's take your\nside of the question, and I don't see how you be much better off.  You\nget up in a tree for a few apples, with plenty of money to buy them if\nyou like--you are kept there by a dog--you are nearly gored by a bull--\nyou are stung by the bees, and you tumble souse into a well, and are\nnearly killed a dozen times, and all for a few apples not worth\ntwopence.\"\n\n\"All very true, my good man,\" replied Jack; \"but you forget that I, as a\nphilosopher, was defending the rights of man.\"\n\n\"Well, I never knew before that a lad who stole apples was called a\nphilosopher--we calls it petty larceny in the indictments; and as for\nyour rights of man, I cannot see how they can be defended by doing\nwhat's wrong.\"\n\n\"You do not comprehend the matter, farmer.\"\n\n\"No, I don't--and I be too old to learn, Master Easy.  All I have to say\nis this, you are welcome to all the apples in the orchard if you please,\nand if you prefers, as it seems you do, to steal them, instead of asking\nfor them, which I only can account for by the reason that they say, that\n`stolen fruit be sweetest,' I've only to say that I shall give orders\nthat you be not interfered with.  My chaise be at the door, Master Easy,\nand the man will drive you to your father's--make my compliments to him,\nand say that I'm very sorry that you tumbled into our well.\"\n\nAs Jack was much more inclined for bed than argument, he wished the\nfarmer good-night, and allowed himself to be driven home.\n\nThe pain from the sting of the bees, now that his circulation had fully\nreturned, was so great, that he was not sorry to find Dr Middleton\ntaking his tea with his father and mother.  Jack merely said that he had\nbeen so unfortunate as to upset a hive, and had been severely stung.  He\ndeferred the whole story till another opportunity.  Dr Middleton\nprescribed for Jack, but on taking his hand found that he was in a high\nfever, which, after the events of the day, was not to be wondered at.\nJack was bled, and kept his bed for a week, by which time he was\nrestored; but during that time Jack had been thinking very seriously,\nand had made up his mind.\n\nBut we must explain a circumstance which had occurred, which was\nprobably the cause of Jack's decision.  When Jack returned on the\nevening in question, he found seated with his father and Dr Middleton,\na Captain Wilson, a sort of cousin to the family, who but occasionally\npaid them a visit, for he lived at some distance; and having a wife and\nlarge family, with nothing but his half-pay for their support, he could\nnot afford to expend even shoe-leather in compliments.  The object of\nthis visit on the part of Captain Wilson was to request the aid of Mr\nEasy.  He had succeeded in obtaining his appointment to a sloop of war\n(for he was in the king's service), but was without the means of fitting\nhimself out, without leaving his wife and family penniless.  He\ntherefore came to request Mr Easy to lend him a few hundred pounds,\nuntil he should be able, by his prize-money, to repay them.  Mr Easy\nwas not a man to refuse such a request, and, always having plenty of\nspare cash at his banker's, he drew a cheque for a thousand pounds,\nwhich he gave to Captain Wilson, requesting that he would only repay it\nat his convenience.  Captain Wilson wrote an acknowledgment of the debt,\npromising to pay upon his first prize-money, which receipt, however\nbinding it may be to a man of honour, was, in point of law, about as\nvaluable as if he had agreed to pay as soon \"as the cows came home.\"\nThe affair had been just concluded, and Captain Wilson had returned into\nthe parlour with Mr Easy, when Jack returned from his expedition.\n\nJack greeted Captain Wilson, whom he had long known; but, as we before\nobserved, he suffered so much pain, that he soon retired with Dr\nMiddleton, and went to bed.\n\nDuring a week there is room for much reflection, even in a lad of\nfourteen, although at that age we are not much inclined to think.  But\nJack was in bed; his eyes were so swollen with the stings of the bees\nthat he could neither read nor otherwise amuse himself; and he preferred\nhis own thoughts to the gabble of Sarah, who attended him.  So Jack\nthought, and the result of his cogitations we shall soon bring forward.\n\nIt was on the eighth day that Jack left his bed and came down into the\ndrawing-room.  He then detailed to his father the adventures which had\ntaken place, which had obliged him to take to his bed.\n\n\"You see, Jack,\" replied his father, \"it's just what I told you: the\nworld is so utterly demoralised by what is called social compact, and\nthe phalanx supporting it by contributing a portion of their unjust\npossessions for the security of the remainder, is so powerful, that any\none who opposes it, must expect to pass the life of a martyr; but\nmartyrs are always required previous to any truth, however sublime,\nbeing received, and, like Abraham, whom I have always considered as a\ngreat philosopher, I am willing to sacrifice my only son in so noble a\ncause.\"\n\n\"That's all very good on your part, father, but we must argue the point\na little.  If you are as great a philosopher as Abraham, I am not quite\nso dutiful a son as Isaac, whose blind obedience, in my opinion, is very\ncontrary to your rights of man: but the fact, in few words, is simply\nthis.  In promulgating your philosophy, in the short space of two days,\nI have been robbed of the fish I caught, and my rod and line--I have\nbeen soused into a fish-pond--I have been frightened out of my wits by a\nbull-dog--been nearly killed by a bull--been stung to death by bees, and\ntwice tumbled into a well.  Now, if all that happens in two days, what\nmust I expect to suffer in a whole year?  It appears to be very unwise\nto attempt making further converts, for people on shore seem determined\nnot to listen to reason or argument.  But it has occurred to me, that\nalthough the whole earth has been so nefariously divided among the few,\nthat the waters at least are the property of all.  No man claims his\nshare of the sea--every one may there plough as he pleases, without\nbeing taken up for a trespasser.  Even war makes no difference; every\none may go on as he pleases, and if they meet, it is nothing but a\nneutral ground on which the parties contend.  It is, then, only upon the\nocean that I am likely to find that equality and rights of man, which we\nare so anxious to establish on shore; and therefore I have resolved not\nto go to school again, which I detest, but to go to sea, and propagate\nour opinions as much as I can.\"\n\n\"I cannot listen to that, Jack.  In the first place, you must return to\nschool; in the next place, you shall not go to sea.\"\n\n\"Then, father, all I have to say is, that I swear by the rights of man I\nwill not go back to school, and that I will go to sea.  Who and what is\nto prevent me?  Was not I born my own master?--has any one a right to\ndictate to me as if I were not his equal?  Have I not as much right to\nmy share of the sea as any other mortal?  I stand upon perfect\nequality,\" continued Jack, stamping his right foot on the floor.\n\nWhat had Mr Easy to offer in reply?  He must either, as a philosopher,\nhave sacrificed his hypothesis, or, as a father, have sacrificed his\nson.  Like all philosophers, he preferred what he considered as the less\nimportant of the two, he sacrificed _his_ son; but--we will do him\njustice--he did it with a sigh.\n\n\"Jack, you shall, if you wish it, go to sea.\"\n\n\"That, of course,\" replied Jack, with the air of a conqueror, \"but the\nquestion is, with whom?  Now it has occurred to me that Captain Wilson\nhas just been appointed to a ship, and I should like to sail with him.\"\n\n\"I will write to him,\" said Mr Easy mournfully, \"but I should have\nliked to have felt his head first;\" and thus was the matter arranged.\n\nThe answer from Captain Wilson was, of course, in the affirmative, and\nhe promised that he would treat Jack as his own son.\n\nOur hero mounted his father's horse, and rode off to Mr Bonnycastle.\n\n\"I am going to sea, Mr Bonnycastle.\"\n\n\"The very best thing for you,\" replied Mr Bonnycastle.\n\nOur hero met Dr Middleton.\n\n\"I am going to sea, Dr Middleton.\"\n\n\"The very best thing for you,\" replied the doctor.\n\n\"I am going to sea, mother,\" said John.\n\n\"To sea, John, to sea? no, no, dear John, you are not going to sea,\"\nreplied Mrs Easy, with horror.\n\n\"Yes, I am; father has agreed, and says he will obtain your consent.\"\n\n\"My consent!  Oh, my dear, dear boy!\"--and Mrs Easy wept bitterly, as\nRachel mourning for her children.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\n\nIN WHICH MR. EASY HAS HIS FIRST LESSON AS TO ZEAL IN HIS MAJESTY'S\nSERVICE.\n\nAs there was no time to lose, our hero very soon bade adieu to his\npaternal roof, as the phrase is, and found his way down to Portsmouth.\nAs Jack had plenty of money, and was very much pleased at finding\nhimself his own master, he was in no hurry to join his ship, and five or\nsix companions not very creditable, whom either Jack had picked up, or\nhad picked up Jack, and who lived upon him, strongly advised him to put\nit off until the very last moment.  As this advice happened to coincide\nwith Jack's opinion, our hero was three weeks at Portsmouth before any\none knew of his arrival, but at last Captain Wilson received a letter\nfrom Mr Easy, by which he found that Jack had left home at the period\nwe have mentioned, and he desired the first-lieutenant to make\ninquiries, as he was afraid that some accident might have happened to\nhim.  As Mr Sawbridge, the first-lieutenant, happened to be going on\nshore on the same evening for the last time previous to the ship's\nsailing, he looked into the Blue Posts, George, and Fountain Inns, to\ninquire if there was such a person arrived as Mr Easy.  \"Oh, yes,\"\nreplied the waiter at the Fountain--\"Mr Easy has been here these three\nweeks.\"\n\n\"The devil he has,\" roared Mr Sawbridge, with all the indignation of a\nfirst-lieutenant defrauded three weeks of a midshipman; \"where is he; in\nthe coffee-room?\"\n\n\"Oh dear no, sir,\" replied the waiter, \"Mr Easy has the front\napartments on the first floor.\"\n\n\"Well, then, show me up to the first floor.\"\n\n\"May I request the pleasure of your name, sir?\" said the waiter.\n\n\"First-lieutenants don't send up their names to midshipmen,\" replied Mr\nSawbridge; \"he shall soon know who I am.\"\n\nAt this reply the waiter walked upstairs, followed by Mr Sawbridge, and\nthrew open the door.\n\n\"A gentleman wishes to see you, sir,\" said the waiter.\n\n\"Desire him to walk in,\" said Jack: \"and, waiter, mind that the punch is\na little better than it was yesterday; I have asked two more gentlemen\nto dine here.\"\n\nIn the meantime Mr Sawbridge, who was not in his uniform, had entered,\nand perceived Jack alone, with the dinner-table laid out in the best\nstyle for eight, a considerable show of plate for even the Fountain Inn,\nand everything, as well as the apartment itself, according to Mr\nSawbridge's opinion, much more fit for a commander-in-chief than a\nmidshipman of a sloop of war.\n\nNow Mr Sawbridge was a good officer, one who had really worked his way\nup to the present rank, that is to say, that he had served\nseven-and-twenty years, and had nothing but his pay.  He was a little\nsoured in the service, and certainly had an aversion to the young men of\nfamily who were now fast crowding into it--and with some grounds, as he\nperceived his own chance of promotion decrease in the same ratio as the\nnumbers increased.  He considered that in proportion as midshipmen\nassumed a cleaner and more gentlemanly appearance, so did they become\nmore useless, and it may therefore be easily imagined that his bile was\nraised by this parade and display in a lad, who was very shortly to be,\nand ought three weeks before to have been, shrinking from his frown.\nNevertheless, Sawbridge was a good-hearted man, although a little\nenvious of luxury, which he could not pretend to indulge in himself.\n\n\"May I beg to ask,\" said Jack, who was always remarkably polite and\ngentlemanly in his address, \"in what manner I may be of service to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, you may--by joining your ship immediately.  And may I beg to\nask in return, sir, what is the reason you have stayed on shore three\nweeks without joining her?\"\n\nHereupon Jack, who did not much admire the peremptory tone of Mr\nSawbridge, and who during the answer had taken a seat, crossed his legs\nand played with the gold chain to which his watch was secured, after a\npause very coolly replied:\n\n\"And pray, who are you?\"\n\n\"Who am I, sir?\" replied Sawbridge, jumping out of his chair--\"my name\nis Sawbridge, sir, and I am the first-lieutenant of the _Harpy_.  Now,\nsir, you have your answer.\"\n\nMr Sawbridge, who imagined that the name of the first-lieutenant would\nstrike terror to a culprit midshipman, threw himself back in the chair,\nand assumed an air of importance.\n\n\"Really, sir,\" replied Jack, \"what may be your exact situation on board,\nmy ignorance of the service will not allow me to guess, but if I may\njudge from your behaviour, you have no small opinion of yourself.\"\n\n\"Look ye, young man, you may not know what a first-lieutenant is, and I\ntake it for granted that you do not, by your behaviour; but depend upon\nit, I'll let you know very soon.  In the meantime, sir, I insist upon\nit, that you go immediately on board.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry that I cannot comply with your very moderate request,\"\nreplied Jack coolly.  \"I shall go on board when it suits my convenience,\nand I beg that you will give yourself no further trouble on my account.\"\n\nJack then rang the bell; the waiter, who had been listening outside,\nimmediately entered, and before Mr Sawbridge, who was dumb with\nastonishment at Jack's impertinence, could have time to reply:\n\n\"Waiter,\" said Jack, \"show this gentleman downstairs.\"\n\n\"By the god of war!\" exclaimed the first-lieutenant, \"but I'll soon show\nyou down to the boat, my young bantam; and when once I get you safe on\nboard, I'll make you know the difference between a midshipman and a\nfirst-lieutenant.\"\n\n\"I can only admit of _equality_, sir,\" replied Jack; \"we are all born\nequal--I trust you'll allow that.\"\n\n\"Equality--damn it, I suppose you'll take the command of the ship.\nHowever, sir, your ignorance will be a little enlightened by-and-by.  I\nshall now go and report your conduct to Captain Wilson; and I tell you\nplainly, that if you are not on board this evening, to-morrow morning,\nat daylight, I shall send a sergeant, and a file of marines, to fetch\nyou.\"\n\n\"You may depend upon it, sir,\" replied Jack, \"that I also shall not fail\nto mention to Captain Wilson that I consider you a very quarrelsome,\nimpertinent fellow, and recommend him not to allow you to remain on\nboard.  It will be quite uncomfortable to be in the same ship with such\nan ungentlemanly bear.\"\n\n\"He must be mad--quite mad,\" exclaimed Sawbridge, whose astonishment\neven mastered his indignation.  \"Mad as a March hare--by God.\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied Jack, \"I am not mad, but I am a philosopher.\"\n\n\"A _what_?\" exclaimed Sawbridge, \"damme, what next?--well, my joker, all\nthe better for you; I shall put your philosophy to the proof.\"\n\n\"It is for that very reason, sir,\" replied Jack, \"that I have decided\nupon going to sea: and if you do remain on board, I hope to argue the\npoint with you, and make you a convert to the truth of equality and the\nrights of man.\"\n\n\"By the Lord that made us both, I'll soon make you a convert to the\nthirty-six articles of war--that is, if you remain on board; but I shall\nnow go to the captain, and report your conduct, sir, and leave you to\nyour dinner with what appetite you may.\"\n\n\"Sir, I am infinitely obliged to you; but you need not be afraid of my\nappetite; I am only sorry, as you happen to belong to the same ship,\nthat I cannot, in justice to the gentlemanly young men whom I expect,\nask you to join them.  I wish you a very good morning, sir.\"\n\n\"Twenty years have I been in the service,\" roared Sawbridge, \"and,\ndamme,--but he's mad--downright, stark, staring mad.\"  And the\nfirst-lieutenant bounced out of the room.\n\nJack was a little astonished himself.  Had Mr Sawbridge made his\nappearance in uniform it might have been different, but that a\nplain-looking man, with black whiskers, shaggy hair, and old blue\nfrock-coat and yellow casimere waistcoat, should venture to address him\nin such a manner, was quite incomprehensible;--he calls me mad, thought\nJack, I shall tell Captain Wilson what is my opinion about his\nlieutenant.  Shortly afterwards, the company arrived, and Jack soon\nforgot all about it.\n\nIn the meantime, Sawbridge called at the captain's lodgings, and found\nhim at home: he made a very faithful report of all that had happened,\nand concluded his requests by demanding, in great wrath, either an\ninstant dismissal or a court-martial on our hero, Jack.\n\n\"Stop, Sawbridge,\" replied Captain Wilson, \"take a chair.  As Mr Easy\nsays, we must argue the point, and then I will leave it to your better\nfeelings.  As for the court-martial, it will not hold good, for Mr\nEasy, in the first place, has not yet joined the ship, and in the next\nplace, could not be supposed to know that you were the first-lieutenant,\nor even an officer, for you went to him out of uniform.\"\n\n\"Very true, sir,\" replied Sawbridge, \"I had forgotten that.\"\n\n\"Then, as for his dismissal, or rather, not allowing him to join, Mr\nEasy has been brought up in the country, and has never seen anything\naquatic larger than a fish-pond, perhaps, in his life; and as for the\nservice, or the nature of it, I believe he is as ignorant of it as a\nchild not a year old--I doubt whether he knows the rank of a lieutenant;\ncertainly, he can have no idea of the power of a first-lieutenant, by\nhis treatment of you.\"\n\n\"I should think not,\" replied Sawbridge dryly.\n\n\"I do not think, therefore, that conduct which must have proceeded from\nsheer ignorance, should be so severely punished--I appeal to you,\nSawbridge.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, perhaps you are right--but still he told me he was a\nphilosopher, and talked about equality and rights of man.  Told me that\nhe could only admit of equality between us, and begged to argue the\npoint.  Now, sir, if a midshipman is to argue the point every time that\nan order is given, the service will come to a pretty pass.\"\n\n\"That is all very true, Sawbridge; and now you remind me of what never\noccurred to me at the time that I promised to take Mr Easy in the ship.\nI now recollect that his father, who is a distant relation of mine, has\nsome very wild notions in his head, just like what have been repeated by\nhis son on your interview with him.  I have occasionally dined there,\nand Mr Easy has always been upholding the principles of natural\nequality and of the rights of man, much to the amusement of his guests,\nand I confess, at the time, of mine also.  I recollect telling him that\nI trusted he would never be able to disseminate his opinions in the\nservice to which I belonged, as we should have an end of all discipline.\nI little thought, at the time, that his only son, who has no more\noccasion to go to sea than the Archbishop of Canterbury, for his father\nhas a very handsome property--I believe seven or eight thousand a year--\nwould ever have sailed with me, and have brought these opinions with him\ninto any ship that I commanded.  It is a pity, a great pity--\"\n\n\"He never could have brought his pigs to a worse market,\" observed\nSawbridge.\n\n\"I agree with you, and, as a father myself, I cannot but help feeling\nhow careful we should be how we inculcate anything like abstract and\nphilosophical idea to youth.  Allowing them to be in themselves correct,\nstill they are dangerous as sharp instruments are in the hands of a\nchild; allowing them to be erroneous, they are seized upon with an\navidity by young and ardent minds, and are not to be eradicated without\nthe greatest difficulty, and very often not until they have accomplished\ntheir ruin.\"\n\n\"Then you think, sir, that these ideas have taken deep root in this\nyoung man, and we shall not easily rid him of them.\"\n\n\"I do not say so; but still, recollect they have been instilled,\nperhaps, from the earliest period, by one from whom they must have been\nreceived with all confidence--from a father to a son; and that son has\nnever yet been sufficiently in the world to have proved their fallacy.\"\n\n\"Well sir,\" replied Sawbridge, \"if I may venture to offer an opinion on\nthe subject, and in so doing I assure you that I only shall from a\nfeeling for the service--if, as you say, these opinions will not easily\nbe eradicated, as the young man is independent, would it not be both\nbetter for himself, as well as for the service, that he is sent home\nagain?  As an officer he will never do any good for himself, and he may\ndo much harm to others.  I submit this to you, Captain Wilson, with all\nrespect; but as your first-lieutenant, I feel very jealous at any chance\nof the discipline of the ship being interfered with by the introduction\nof this young man, to whom it appears that a profession is no object.\"\n\n\"My dear Sawbridge,\" replied Captain Wilson, after taking one or two\nturns up and down the room, \"we entered the service together, we were\nmessmates for many years, and you must be aware that it is not only long\nfriendship but an intimate knowledge of your unrewarded merit, which has\ninduced me to request you to come with me as my first-lieutenant.  Now,\nI will put a case to you, and you shall then decide the question--and,\nmoreover, I will abide by your decision.\n\n\"Suppose that you were a commander like myself, with a wife and seven\nchildren, and that, struggling for many years to support them, you found\nyourself, notwithstanding the utmost parsimony, gradually running into\ndebt.  That, after many long applications, you had at last succeeded in\nobtaining employment by an appointment to a fine sloop, and there was\nevery prospect, by prize-money and increased pay, of recovering yourself\nfrom your difficulties, if not realising a sufficient provision for your\nfamily.  Then suppose that all this prospect and all these hopes were\nlikely to be dashed to the ground by the fact of having no means of\nfitting yourself out, no credit, no means of paying debts you have\ncontracted, for which you would have been arrested, or anything\nsufficient to leave for the support of your family during your absence,\nyour agent only consenting to advance one-half of what you require.\nNow, suppose, in this awkward dilemma, without any one in this world\nupon whom you have any legitimate claim, as a last resource you were to\napply to one with whom you have but a distant connection, and but an\noccasional acquaintance--and that when you had made your request for the\nloan of two or three hundred pounds, fully anticipating a refusal (from\nthe feeling that he who goes a-borrowing goes a-sorrowing)--I say,\nsuppose, to your astonishment, that this generous person was to present\nyou with a cheque on his banker for one thousand pounds, demanding no\ninterest, no legal security, and requests you only to pay it at your\nconvenience--I ask you, Sawbridge, what would be your feelings towards\nsuch a man?\"\n\n\"I would die for him,\" replied Sawbridge, with emotion.\n\n\"And suppose that, by the merest chance, or from a whim of the moment,\nthe son of that man was to be placed under your protection?\"\n\n\"I would be a father to him,\" replied Sawbridge.\n\n\"But we must proceed a little further: suppose that you were to find the\nlad was not all that you could wish--that he had imbibed erroneous\ndoctrines, which would probably, if not eradicated, be attended with\nconsequences fatal to his welfare and happiness, would you therefore, on\nthat account, withdraw your protection, and leave him to the mercy of\nothers, who had no claims of gratitude to sway them in his favour?\"\n\n\"Most certainly not, sir,\" replied Sawbridge; \"on the contrary, I would\nnever part with the son until, by precept or otherwise, I had set him\nright again, and thus had, as far as it was possible, paid the debt of\ngratitude due to the generous father.\"\n\n\"I hardly need say to you, Sawbridge, after what has passed, that this\nlad you have just come from, is the son, and that Mr Easy of Forest\nHill is the father.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, I can only say, that not only to please you, but also from\nrespect to a man who has shown such goodwill towards one of our cloth, I\nshall most cheerfully forgive all that has passed between the lad and\nme, and all that may probably take place before we make him what he\nought to be.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Sawbridge; I expected as much, and am not disappointed in my\nopinion of you.\"\n\n\"And now, Captain Wilson, pray what is to be done?\"\n\n\"We must get him on board, but not with a file of marines--that will do\nmore harm than good.  I will send a note, requesting him to breakfast\nwith me to-morrow morning, and have a little conversation with him.  I\ndo not wish to frighten him: he would not scruple to run back to Forest\nHill--now I wish to keep him if I possibly can.\"\n\n\"You are right, sir; his father appears his greatest enemy.  What a pity\nthat a man with so good a heart should be so weak in the head!  Then,\nsir, I shall take no notice of this at present, but leave the whole\naffair in your hands.\"\n\n\"Do, Sawbridge; you have obliged me very much by your kindness in this\nbusiness.\"\n\nMr Sawbridge then took his leave, and Captain Wilson despatched a note\nto our hero, requesting the pleasure of his company to breakfast at nine\no'clock the ensuing morning.  The answer was in the affirmative, but\nverbal, for Jack had drunk too much champagne to trust his pen to paper.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINE.\n\nIN WHICH MR. EASY FINDS HIMSELF ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BAY OF BISCAY.\n\nThe next morning Jack Easy would have forgotten all about his engagement\nwith the captain, had it not been for the waiter, who thought that,\nafter the reception which our hero had given the first-lieutenant, it\nwould be just as well that he should not be disrespectful to the\ncaptain.  Now Jack had not, hitherto, put on his uniform, and he thought\nthis a fitting occasion, particularly as the waiter suggested the\npropriety of his appearance in it.  Whether it was from a presentiment\nof what he was to suffer, Jack was not at all pleased, as most lads are,\nwith the change in his dress.  It appeared to him that he was\nsacrificing his independence; however, he did not follow his first\nimpulse, which was to take it off again, but took his hat, which the\nwaiter had brushed and handed to him, and then set off for the captain's\nlodgings.  Captain Wilson received him as if he had not been aware of\nhis delay in joining his ship, or his interview with his\nfirst-lieutenant, but before breakfast was over, Jack himself narrated\nthe affair in a few words.  Captain Wilson then entered into a detail of\nthe duties and rank of every person on board of the ship, pointing out\nto Jack that where discipline was required, it was impossible, when duty\nwas carried on, that more than one could command; and that that one was\nthe captain, who represented the king in person, who represented the\ncountry; and that, as the orders were transmitted from the captain\nthrough the lieutenant, and from the lieutenant to the midshipmen, who,\nin their turn, communicated them to the whole ship's company, in fact,\nwas the captain alone who gave the orders, and that every one was\n_equally_ obliged to obey.  Indeed, as the captain himself had to obey\nthe orders of his superiors, the admiral and the admiralty, _all_ on\nboard might be said to be _equally_ obliged to obey.  Captain Wilson\nlaid a strong emphasis on the word _equally_, as he cautiously\nadministered his first dose; indeed, in the whole of his address, he\nmade use of special pleading, which would have done credit to the Bar;\nfor at the same time that he was explaining to Jack that he was entering\na service in which _equality_ could never for a moment exist, if the\nservice was to exist, he contrived to show that all the grades were\nlevelled, by all being equally bound to do their duty to their country,\nand that, in fact, whether a seaman obeyed _his_ orders, or he obeyed\nthe orders of _his_ superior officer, they were in reality only obeying\nthe orders of the country, which were administered through their\nchannels.\n\nJack did not altogether dislike this view of the subject, and the\ncaptain took care not to dwell too long upon it.  He then entered upon\nother details, which he was aware would be more agreeable to Jack.  He\npointed out that the articles of war were the rules by which the service\nwas to be guided, and that everybody, from the captain to the least boy\nin the ship, was _equally_ bound to adhere to them--that a certain\nallowance of provisions and wine was allowed to each person on board,\nand that this allowance was the same to all; the same to the captain as\nto the boy: the same in quantity as in quality; every one _equally_\nentitled to his allowance;--that, although there were, of necessity,\nvarious grades necessary in the service, and the captain's orders were\nobliged to be passed and obeyed by all, yet still, whatever was the\ngrade of the officer, they were _equally_ considered as gentlemen.  In\nshort, Captain Wilson, who told the truth, and nothing but the truth,\nwithout telling the whole truth, actually made Jack fancy that he had at\nlast found out that equality he had been seeking for in vain on shore,\nwhen, at last, he recollected the language used by Mr Sawbridge the\nevening before, and asked the captain why that personage had so\nconducted himself.  Now, as the language of Mr Sawbridge was very much\nat variance with equality, Captain Wilson was not a little puzzled.\nHowever, he first pointed out that the first-lieutenant was, at the time\nbeing, the captain, as he was the senior officer on board, as would Jack\nhimself be if he were the senior officer on board; and that, as he\nbefore observed, the captain or senior officer represented the country.\nThat in the articles of war, everybody who absented himself from the\nship, committed an error, or breach of those articles; and if any error\nor breach of those articles was committed by any one belonging to the\nship, if the senior officer did not take notice of it, he then himself\ncommitted a breach of those articles, and was liable himself to be\npunished, if he could not prove that he had noticed it; it was therefore\nto save himself that he was obliged to point out the error; and if he\ndid it in strong language, it only proved his _zeal_ for his country.\n\n\"Upon my honour, then,\" replied Jack, \"there can be no doubt of his\nzeal; for if the whole country had been at stake, he could not have put\nhimself in a greater passion.\"\n\n\"Then he did his duty; but depend upon it it was not a pleasant one to\nhim: and I'll answer for it, when you meet him on board, he will be as\nfriendly with you as if nothing had happened.\"\n\n\"He told me that he'd soon make me know what a first-lieutenant was:\nwhat did he mean by that?\" inquired Jack.\n\n\"All zeal.\"\n\n\"Yes, but he said, that as soon as he got on board, he'd show me the\ndifference between a first-lieutenant and a midshipman.\"\n\n\"All zeal.\"\n\n\"He said my ignorance should be a little enlightened by-and-by.\"\n\n\"All zeal.\"\n\n\"And that he'd send a sergeant and marines to fetch me.\"\n\n\"All zeal.\"\n\n\"That he would put my philosophy to the proof.\"\n\n\"All zeal, Mr Easy.  Zeal will break out in this way; but we should do\nnothing in the service without it.  Recollect that I hope and trust one\nday to see you also a zealous officer.\"\n\nHere Jack cogitated considerably, and gave no answer.\n\n\"You will, I am sure,\" continued Captain Wilson, \"find Mr Sawbridge one\nof your best friends.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so,\" replied Jack: \"but I did not much admire our first\nacquaintance.\"\n\n\"It will perhaps be your unpleasant duty to find as much fault yourself;\nwe are all equally bound to do our duty to our country.  But, Mr Easy,\nI sent for you to say that we shall sail to-morrow: and, as I shall send\nmy things off this afternoon by the launch, you had better send yours\noff also.  At eight o'clock I shall go on board, and we can both go in\nthe same boat.\"\n\nTo this Jack made no sort of objection, and having paid his bill at the\nFountain, he sent his chest down to the boat by some of the crew who\ncame up for it, and attended the summons of the captain to embark.  By\nnine o'clock that evening, Mr Jack Easy was safe on board his Majesty's\nsloop _Harpy_.\n\nWhen Jack arrived on board, it was dark, and he did not know what to do\nwith himself.  The captain was received by the officers on deck, who\ntook off their hats to salute him.  The captain returned the salute, and\nso did Jack very politely, after which the captain entered into\nconversation with the first-lieutenant, and for a while Jack was left to\nhimself.  It was too dark to distinguish faces, and to one who had never\nbeen on board of a ship, too dark to move, so Jack stood where he was,\nwhich was not far from the main bitts; but he did not stay long; the\nboat had been hooked on to the quarter davits, and the boatswain had\ncalled out:\n\n\"Set taut, my lads!\"\n\nAnd then with the shrill whistle, and \"Away with her!\" forward came\ngalloping and bounding along the men with the tackles; and in the dark\nJack was upset, and half a dozen marines fell upon him; the men, who had\nno idea that an officer was floored among the others, were pleased at\nthe joke, and continued to dance over those who were down, until they\nrolled themselves out of the way.  Jack, who did not understand this,\nfared badly, and it was not till the calls piped belay, that he could\nrecover his legs, after having been trampled upon by half the starboard\nwatch, and the breath completely jammed out of his body.  Jack reeled to\na carronade slide, when the officers, who had been laughing at the lark\nas well as the men, perceived his situation--among others, Mr\nSawbridge, the first-lieutenant.\n\n\"Are you hurt, Mr Easy?\" said he kindly.\n\n\"A little,\" replied Jack, catching his breath.\n\n\"You've had but a rough welcome,\" replied the first-lieutenant, \"but at\ncertain times, on board ship, it is every man for himself, and God for\nus all.  Harpur,\" continued the first-lieutenant to the doctor, \"take\nMr Easy down in the gun-room with you, and I will be down myself as\nsoon as I can.  Where is Mr Jolliffe?\"\n\n\"Here, sir,\" replied Mr Jolliffe, a master's mate, coming aft from the\nbooms.\n\n\"There is a youngster come on board with the captain.  Order one of the\nquartermasters to get a hammock slung.\"\n\nIn the meantime Jack went down into the gun-room, where a glass of wine\nsomewhat recovered him.  He did not stay there long, nor did he venture\nto talk much.  As soon as his hammock was ready, Jack was glad to go to\nbed--and as he was much bruised he was not disturbed the next morning\ntill past nine o'clock.  He then dressed himself, went on deck, found\nthat the sloop was just clear of the Needles, that he felt very queer,\nthen very sick, and was conducted by a marine down below, put into his\nhammock, where he remained during a gale of wind of three days,\nbewildered, confused, puzzled, and every minute knocking his head\nagainst the beams with the pitching and tossing of the sloop.\n\n\"And this is going to sea,\" thought Jack; \"no wonder that no one\ninterferes with another here, or talks about a trespass; for I'm sure\nany one is welcome to my share of the ocean; and if I once get on shore\nagain, the devil may have my portion if he chooses.\"\n\nCaptain Wilson and Mr Sawbridge had both allowed Jack more leisure than\nmost midshipmen, during his illness.  By the time that the gale was\nover, the sloop was off Cape Finisterre.  The next morning the sea was\nnearly down, and there was but a slight breeze on the waters.  The\ncomparative quiet of the night before had very much recovered our hero,\nand when the hammocks were piped up, he was accosted by Mr Jolliffe,\nthe master's mate, who asked, \"whether he intended to rouse and bit, or\nwhether he intended to sail to Gibraltar between his blankets.\"\n\nJack, who felt himself quite another person, turned out of his hammock\nand dressed himself.  A marine had, by the captain's orders, attended\nJack during his illness, and this man came to his assistance, opened his\nchest, and brought him all that he required, or Jack would have been in\na sad dilemma.\n\nJack then inquired where he was to go, for he had not yet been in the\nmidshipmen's berth, although five days on board.  The marine pointed it\nout to him, and Jack, who felt excessively hungry, crawled over and\nbetween chests, until he found himself fairly in a hole infinitely\ninferior to the dog-kennels which received his father's pointers.\n\n\"I'd not only give up the ocean,\" thought Jack, \"and my share of it, but\nalso my share of the _Harpy_, unto any one who fancies it.  Equality\nenough here! for every one appears equally miserably off.\"\n\nAs he thus gave vent to his thoughts, he perceived that there was\nanother person in the berth--Mr Jolliffe, the master's mate, who had\nfixed his eye upon Jack, and to whom Jack returned the compliment.  The\nfirst thing that Jack observed was, that Mr Jolliffe was very deeply\npockmarked, and that he had but one eye, and that was a piercer; it\nappeared like a little ball of fire, and as if it reflected more light\nfrom the solitary candle than the candle gave.\n\n\"I don't like your looks,\" thought Jack--\"we shall never be friends.\"\n\nBut here Jack fell into the common error of judging by appearances, as\nwill be proved hereafter.\n\n\"I'm glad to see you up again, youngster,\" said Jolliffe; \"you've been\non your beam ends longer than usual, but those who are strongest suffer\nmost--you made your mind up but late to come to sea.  However, they say,\n`Better late than never.'\"\n\n\"I feel very much inclined to argue the truth of that saying,\" replied\nJack; \"but it's no use just now.  I'm terribly hungry--when shall I get\nsome breakfast?\"\n\n\"To-morrow morning at half-past eight,\" replied Mr Jolliffe.\n\"Breakfast for to-day has been over these two hours.\"\n\n\"But must I then go without?\"\n\n\"No, I do not say that, as we must make allowances for your illness; but\nit will not be breakfast.\"\n\n\"Call it what you please,\" replied Jack.  \"Only pray desire the servants\nto give me something to eat.  Dry toast or muffins--anything will do,\nbut I should prefer coffee.\"\n\n\"You forget that you are off Finisterre, in a midshipman's berth: coffee\nwe have none--muffins we never see--dry toast cannot be made, as we have\nno soft bread; but a cup of tea, and ship's biscuit and butter, I can\ndesire the steward to get ready for you.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" replied Jack, \"I will thank you to procure me that.\"\n\n\"Marine,\" cried Jolliffe, \"call Mesty.\"\n\n\"Pass the word for Mesty,\" cried the marine--and the two syllables were\nhanded forward until lost in the fore part of the vessel.\n\nThe person so named must be introduced to the reader.  He was a curious\nanomaly--a black man who had been brought to America as a slave, and\nthere sold.\n\nHe was a very tall, spare-built, yet muscular form, and had a face by no\nmeans common with his race.  His head was long and narrow, high\ncheek-bones, from whence his face descended down to almost a point at\nthe chin; his nose was very small, but it was straight and almost Roman;\nhis mouth also was unusually small; and his lips thin for an African;\nhis teeth very white, and filed to sharp points.  He claimed the rank of\nprince in his own country, with what truth could not of course be\nsubstantiated.  His master had settled at New York, and there Mesty had\nlearned English, if it could be so called: the fact is, that all the\nemigrant labourers at New York being Irishmen, he had learned English\nwith the strong brogue and peculiar phraseology of the sister kingdom\ndashed with a little Yankeeism.\n\nHaving been told that there was no slavery in England, Mesty had\nconcealed himself on board an English merchant vessel, and escaped.  On\nhis arrival in England he had entered on board of a man-of-war.  Having\nno name, it was necessary to christen him on the ship's books, and the\nfirst lieutenant, who had entered him, struck with his remarkable\nexpression of countenance, and being a German scholar, had named him\nMephistopheles Faust, from whence his Christian name had been razeed to\nMesty.  Mesty in other points was an eccentric character; at one moment,\nwhen he remembered his lineage, he was proud to excess, at others he was\ngrave and almost sullen--but when nothing either in daily occurrences or\nin his mind ran contrary, he exhibited the drollery so often found in\nhis nation, with a spice of Irish humour, as if he had caught up the\nlatter with his Irish brogue.\n\nMesty was soon seen coming aft, but almost double as he couched under\nthe beams, and taking large strides with his naked feet.\n\n\"By the powers, Massa Yolliffe, but it is not seasonable at all to send\nfor me just now, anyhow, seeing how the praters are in the copper, and\nso many blackguard 'palpeens all ready to change net for net, and better\nthemselves by the same mistake, `dam um.'\"\n\n\"Mesty, you know I never send for you myself, or allow others to do so,\nunless it is necessary,\" replied Jolliffe; \"but this poor lad has eaten\nnothing since he has been on board, and is very hungry--you must get him\na little tea.\"\n\n\"Is it tay you mane, sir?--I guess, to make tay, in the first place I\nmust ab water, and in the next must ab room in the galley to put the\nkettle on--and 'pose you wanted to burn the tip of your little finger\njust now, it's not in the galley that you find a berth for it--and den\nthe water before seven bells.  I've a notion it's just impassible.\"\n\n\"But he must have something, Mesty.\"\n\n\"Never mind the tea, then,\" replied Jack, \"I'll take some milk.\"\n\n\"Is it milk massa manes, and the bumboat woman on the oder side of the\nbay?\"\n\n\"We have no milk, Mr Easy; you forget that we are on blue water,\"\nreplied Jolliffe, \"and I really am afraid that you'll have to wait till\ndinner-time.  Mesty tells the truth.\"\n\n\"I tell you what, Massa Yolliffe, it just seven bells, and if the young\ngentleman would, instead of tay, try a little out of the copper, it\nmight keep him asy.  It but a little difference, _tay_ soup and _pay_\nsoup.  Now a bowl of that, with some nuts and a flourish of pepper will\ndo him good, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the best thing he can take, Mesty; get it as fast as you can.\"\n\nIn a few minutes the black brought down a bowl of soup and whole peas\nswimming in it, put before our hero a tin bread-basket full of small\nbiscuit, called midshipmen's nuts, and the pepper-castor.  Jack's\nvisions of tea, coffee, muffins, dry toast, and milk, vanished as he\nperceived the mess; but he was very hungry, and he found it much better\nthan he expected; and he moreover found himself much the better after he\nhad swallowed it.  It struck seven bells, and he accompanied Mr\nJolliffe on deck.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TEN.\n\nSHOWING HOW JACK TRANSGRESSES AGAINST HIS OWN PHILOSOPHY.\n\nWhen Jack Easy had gained the deck, he found the sun shining gaily, a\nsoft air blowing from the shore, and the whole of the rigging and every\npart of the ship loaded with the shirts, trousers, and jackets of the\nseamen, which had been wetted during the heavy gale, and were now\nhanging up to dry; all the wet sails were also spread on the booms or\ntriced up in the rigging, and the ship was slowly forging through the\nblue water.  The captain and first lieutenant were standing on the\ngangway in converse, and the majority of the officers were with their\nquadrants and sextants ascertaining the latitude at noon.  The decks\nwere white and clean, the sweepers had just laid by their brooms, and\nthe men were busy coiling down the ropes.  It was a scene of\ncheerfulness, activity, and order, which lightened his heart after the\nfour days of suffering, close air, and confinement, from which he had\njust emerged.\n\nThe captain, who perceived him, beckoned to him, asked him kindly how he\nfelt: the first lieutenant also smiled upon him, and many of the\nofficers, as well as his messmates, congratulated him upon his recovery.\n\nThe captain's steward came up to him, touched his hat, and requested the\npleasure of his company to dinner in the cabin.  Jack was the essence of\npoliteness, took off his hat, and accepted the invitation.  Jack was\nstanding on a rope which a seaman was coiling down; the man touched his\nhat and requested he would be so kind as to take his foot off.  Jack\ntook his hat off his head in return, and his foot off the rope.  The\nmaster touched his hat, and reported twelve o'clock to the first\nlieutenant--the first lieutenant touched his hat, and reported twelve\no'clock to the captain--the captain touched his hat, and told the first\nlieutenant to make it so.  The officer of the watch touched his hat, and\nasked the captain whether they should pipe to dinner--the captain\ntouched his hat and said, \"If you please.\"\n\nThe midshipman received his orders, and touched his hat, which he gave\nto the head boatswain's mate, who touched his hat, and then the calls\nwhistled cheerily.\n\n\"Well,\" thought Jack, \"politeness seems to be the order of the day, and\nevery one has an equal respect for the other.\"  Jack stayed on deck; he\npeeped through the ports, which were open, and looked down into the deep\nblue wave; he cast his eyes aloft, and watched the tall spars sweeping\nand tracing with their points, as it were, a small portion of the clear\nsky, as they acted in obedience to the motion of the vessel; he looked\nforward at the range of carronades which lined the sides of the deck,\nand then he proceeded to climb one of the carronades, and lean over the\nhammocks to gaze on the distant land.\n\n\"Young gentleman, get off those hammocks,\" cried the master, who was\nofficer of the watch, in a surly tone.\n\nJack looked round.\n\n\"Do you hear me, sir?  I'm speaking to you,\" said the master again.\n\nJack felt very indignant, and he thought that politeness was not quite\nso general as he supposed.\n\nIt happened that Captain Wilson was upon deck.\n\n\"Come here, Mr Easy,\" said the captain; \"it is a rule in the service,\nthat no one gets on the hammocks, unless in case of emergency--I never\ndo--nor the first lieutenant--nor any of the officers or men--therefore,\nupon the principle of equality, you must not do it either.\"\n\n\"Cerainly not, sir,\" replied Jack, \"but still I do not see why that\nofficer in the shining hat should be so angry, and not speak to me as if\nI were a gentleman, as well as himself.\"\n\n\"I have already explained that to you, Mr Easy.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I recollect now, it's zeal; but this zeal appears to me to be\nthe only unpleasant thing in the service.  It's a pity, as you said,\nthat the service cannot do without it.\"\n\nCaptain Wilson laughed, and walked away; and shortly afterwards, as he\nturned up and down the deck with the master, he hinted to him that he\nshould not speak so sharply to a lad who had committed such a trifling\nerror through ignorance.  Now Mr Smallsole, the master, who was a surly\nsort of a personage, and did not like even a hint of disapprobation of\nhis conduct, although very regardless of the feeling of others,\ndetermined to pay this off on Jack, the very first convenient\nopportunity.  Jack dined in the cabin, and was very much pleased to find\nthat every one drank wine with him, and that everybody at the captain's\ntable appeared to be on an equality.  Before the dessert had been on the\ntable five minutes, Jack became loquacious on his favourite topic; all\nthe company stared with surprise at such an unheard-of doctrine being\nbroached on board of a man-of-war; the captain argued the point, so as\nto controvert, without too much offending, Jack's notions, laughing the\nwhole time that the conversation was carried on.\n\nIt will be observed, that this day may be considered as the first in\nwhich Jack really made his appearance on board, and it also was on this\nfirst day that Jack made known, at the captain's table, his very\npeculiar notions.  If the company at the captain's table, which\nconsisted of the second lieutenant, purser, Mr Jolliffe, and one of the\nmidshipmen, were astonished at such heterodox opinions being started in\nthe presence of the captain, they were equally astonished at the cool,\ngood-humoured ridicule with which they were received by Captain Wilson.\nThe report of Jack's boldness, and every word and opinion that he had\nuttered (of course much magnified) was cirulated that evening through\nthe whole ship; it was canvassed in the gun-room by the officers, it was\ndescanted upon by the midshipmen as they walked the deck; the captain's\nsteward held a levee abreast of the ship's funnel, in which he narrated\nthis new doctrine.  The sergeant of marines gave his opinion in his\nberth that it was damnable.  The boatswain talked over the matter with\nthe other warrant officers, till the grog was all gone, and then\ndismissed it as too dry a subject: and it was the general opinion of the\nship's company, that as soon as they arrived at Gibraltar Bay, our hero\nwould bid adieu to the service, either by being sentenced to death by a\ncourt-martial, or by being dismissed, and towed on shore on a grating.\nOthers, who had more of the wisdom of the serpent, and who had been\ninformed by Mr Sawbridge that our hero was a lad who would inherit a\nlarge property, argued differently, and considered that Captain Wilson\nhad very good reason for being so lenient--and among them was the second\nlieutenant.  There were but four who were well inclined towards Jack--to\nwit, the captain, the first lieutenant, Mr Jolliffe, the one-eyed\nmaster's mate, and Mephistopheles, the black, who, having heard that\nJack had uttered such sentiments, loved him with all his heart and soul.\n\nWe have referred to the second lieutenant, Mr Asper.  This young man\nhad a very high respect for birth, and particularly for money, of which\nhe had very little.  He was the son of an eminent merchant who, during\nthe time that he was a midshipman, had allowed him a much larger sum for\nhis expenses than was necessary or proper; and, during his career, he\nfound that his full pocket procured him consequence, not only among his\nown messmates, but also with many of the officers of the ships that he\nsailed in.  A man who is able and willing to pay a large tavern bill\nwill always find followers--that is, to the tavern; and lieutenants did\nnot disdain to dine, walk arm in arm, and be \"hail fellow well met\" with\na midshipman, at whose expense they lived during the time they were on\nshore.  Mr Asper had just received his commission and appointment, when\nhis father became a bankrupt, and the fountain was dried up from which\nhe had drawn such liberal supplies.  Since that, Mr Asper had felt that\nhis consequence was gone: he could no longer talk about the service\nbeing a bore, or that he should give it up; he could no longer obtain\nthat deference paid to his purse, and not to himself; and he had\ncontracted very expensive habits, without having any longer the means of\ngratifying them.  It was therefore no wonder that he imbibed a great\nrespect for money; and, as he could no longer find the means himself, he\nwas glad to pick up anybody else at whose cost he could indulge in that\nextravagance and expense to which he had been so long accustomed, and\nstill sighed for.  Now, Mr Asper knew that our hero was well supplied\nwith money, as he had obtained from the waiter the amount of the bill\npaid at the Fountain, and he had been waiting for Jack's appearance on\ndeck to become his very dearest and most intimate friend.  The\nconversation in the cabin made him feel assured that Jack would require\nand be grateful for support, and he had taken the opportunity of a walk\nwith Mr Sawbridge, to offer to take Jack in his watch.  Whether it was\nthat Mr Sawbridge saw through the design of Mr Asper, or whether he\nimagined that our hero would be better pleased with him than with the\nmaster, considering his harshness of deportment; or with himself, who\ncould not, as first lieutenant, overlook any remission of duty, the\noffer was accepted, and Jack Easy was ordered, as he now entered upon\nhis duties, to keep watch under Lieutenant Asper.\n\nBut not only was this the first day that Jack may be said to have\nappeared in the service, but it was the first day in which he had\nentered the midshipman's berth, and was made acquainted with his\nmessmates.\n\nWe have already mentioned Mr Jolliffe, the master's mate, but we must\nintroduce him more particularly.  Nature is sometimes extremely\narbitrary, and never did she show herself more so than in insisting that\nMr Jolliffe should have the most sinister expression of countenance\nthat ever had been looked upon.\n\nHe had suffered martyrdom with the small-pox, which probably had\ncontracted his lineaments: his face was not only deeply pitted, but\nscarred, with this cruel disorder.  One eye had been lost, and all\neyebrows had disappeared--and the contrast between the dull, sightless\nopaque orb on one side of his face, and the brilliant, piercing little\nball on the other, was almost terrifying.  His nose had been eaten away\nby the disease till it formed a sharp but irregular point: part of the\nmuscles of the chin were contracted, and it was drawn in with unnatural\nseams and puckers.  He was tall, gaunt, and thin, seldom smiled, and\nwhen he did, the smile produced a still further distortion.\n\nMr Jolliffe was the son of a warrant officer.  He did not contract this\ndisease until he had been sent out to the West Indies, where it swept\naway hundreds.  He had now been long in the service, with little or no\nchance of promotion.  He had suffered from indigence, from reflections\nupon his humble birth, from sarcasms on his appearance.  Every contumely\nhad been heaped upon him at one time or another, in the ships in which\nhe served; among a crowd he had found himself desolate--and now,\nalthough no one dared treat him to his face with disrespect, he was only\nrespected in the service from a knowledge of his utility and exemplary\nperformance of his duties--he had no friends or even companions.  For\nmany years he had retired within himself, he had improved by reading and\nstudy, had felt all the philanthropy of a Christian, and extended it\ntowards others.  Silent and reserved, he seldom spoke in the berth,\nunless his authority, as caterer, was called for; all respected Mr\nJolliffe, but no one liked, as a companion, one at whose appearance the\nvery dogs would bark.  At the same time every one acknowledged his\ncorrect behaviour in every point, his sense of justice, his forbearance,\nhis kindness, and his good sense.  With him life was indeed a\npilgrimage, and he wended his way in all Christian charity and all\nChristian zeal.\n\nIn all societies, however small they may be, provided that they do but\namount to half a dozen, you will invariably meet with a bully.  And it\nis also generally the case that you will find one of that society who is\nmore or less the butt.  You will discover this even in occasional\nmeetings, such as a dinner-party, the major part of which have never met\nbefore.\n\nPrevious to the removal of the cloth, the bully will have shown himself\nby his dictatorial manner, and will also have selected the one upon whom\nhe imagines that he can best practise.  In a midshipman's berth this\nfact has become almost proverbial, although now perhaps it is not\nattended with that disagreeable despotism which was permitted at the\ntime that our hero entered the service.\n\nThe bully of the midshipman's berth of H.M. sloop _Harpy_ was a young\nman about seventeen, with light, curly hair, and florid countenance, the\nson of the clerk in the dockyard at Plymouth, and his name was Vigors.\n\nThe butt was a pudding-face Tartar-physiognomied boy of fifteen, whose\nintellects, with fostering, if not great, might at least have been\nrespectable, had he not lost all confidence in his own powers from the\nconstant jeers and mockeries of those who had a greater fluency of\nspeech without perhaps so much real power of mind.  Although slow, what\nhe learned he invariably retained.  This lad's name was Gossett.  His\nfather was a wealthy yeoman of Lynn, in Norfolk.  There were at the time\nbut three other midshipmen in the ship, of whom it can only be said that\nthey were like midshipmen in general, with little appetite for learning,\nbut good appetites for dinner, hating everything like work, fond of\neverything like fun, fighting _a l'outrance_ one minute, and sworn\nfriends the next--with general principles of honour and justice, but\nwhich were occasionally warped according to circumstances; with all the\nvirtues and vices so heterogeneously jumbled and heaped together, that\nit was almost impossible to ascribe any action to its true motive, and\nto ascertain to what point their vice was softened down into almost a\nvirtue, and their virtues from mere excess degenerated into vice.  Their\nnames were O'Connor, Mills, and Gascoigne.  The other shipmates of our\nhero it will be better to introduce as they appear on the stage.\n\nAfter Jack had dined in the cabin he followed his messmates Jolliffe and\nGascoigne down into the midshipmen's berth.\n\n\"I say, Easy,\" observed Gascoigne, \"you are a devilish free and easy\nsort of a fellow, to tell the captain that you considered yourself as\ngreat a man as he was.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" replied Jack, \"I did not argue individually, but\ngenerally, upon the principles of the rights of man.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Gascoigne, \"it's the first time I ever heard a middy do\nsuch a bold thing; take care your rights of man don't get you in the\nwrong box--there's no arguing on board of a man-of-war.  The captain\ntook it amazingly easy, but you'd better not broach that subject too\noften.\"\n\n\"Gascoigne gives you very good advice, Mr Easy,\" observed Jolliffe;\n\"allowing that your ideas are correct, which it appears to me they are\nnot, or at least impossible to be acted upon, there is such a thing as\nprudence, and however much this question may be canvassed on shore, in\nhis Majesty's service it is not only dangerous in itself, but will be\nvery prejudicial to you.\"\n\n\"Man is a free agent,\" replied Easy.\n\n\"I'll be shot if a midshipman is,\" replied Gascoigne, laughing, \"and\nthat you'll soon find.\"\n\n\"And yet it was the expectation of finding that equality that I was\ninduced to come to sea.\"\n\n\"On the first of April, I presume,\" replied Gascoigne.  \"But are you\nreally serious?\"\n\nHereupon Jack entered into a long argument, to which Jolliffe and\nGascoigne listened without interruption, and Mesty with admiration: at\nthe end of it, Gascoigne laughed heartily and Jolliffe sighed.\n\n\"From whence did you learn all this?\" inquired Jolliffe.\n\n\"From my father, who is a great philosopher, and has constantly upheld\nthese opinions.\"\n\n\"And did your father wish you to go to sea?\"\n\n\"No, he was opposed to it,\" replied Jack, \"but of course he could not\ncombat my rights and free-will.\"\n\n\"Mr Easy, as a friend,\" replied Jolliffe, \"I request that you would as\nmuch as possible keep your opinions to yourself: I shall have an\nopportunity of talking to you on the subject, and will then explain to\nyou my reasons.\"\n\nAs soon as Mr Jolliffe had ceased, down came Mr Vigors and O'Connor,\nwho had heard the news of Jack's heresy.\n\n\"You do not know Mr Vigors and Mr O'Connor,\" said Jolliffe to Easy.\n\nJack, who was the essence of politeness, rose and bowed, at which the\nothers took their seats, without returning the salutation.  Vigors had,\nfrom what he had heard and now seen of Easy, thought he had somebody\nelse to play upon, and without ceremony he commenced.\n\n\"So, my chap, you are come on board to raise a mutiny here with your\nequality--you came off scot free at the captain's table; but it won't\ndo, I can tell you, even in the midshipman's berth some must knock\nunder, and you are one of them.\"\n\n\"If, sir,\" replied Easy, \"you mean by knock under, that I must submit, I\ncan assure you that you are mistaken.  Upon the same principle that I\nwould never play the tyrant to those weaker than myself, so will I\nresent oppression if attempted.\"\n\n\"Damme, but he's a regular sea lawyer already: however, my boy, we'll\nsoon put your mettle to the proof.\"\n\n\"Am I then to infer that I am not on an equality with my messmates?\"\nreplied Jack, looking at Jolliffe.  The latter was about to answer him,\nbut Vigors interrupted.\n\n\"Yes, you are on an equality as far as this--that you have an equal\nright to the berth, if you are not knocked out of it for insolence to\nyour masters; that you have an equal share to pay for the things\npurchased for the mess, and an equal right to have your share, provided\nyou can get it; you have an equal right to talk, provided you are not\ntold to hold your tongue.  The fact is, you have an equal right with\nevery one else to do as you can, get what you can, and say what you can,\nalways provided that you can do it; for here the weakest goes to the\nwall, and that is midshipmen's berth equality.  Now, do you understand\nall that; or will you wait for a practical illustration?\"\n\n\"I am then to infer that the equality here is as much destroyed as it\neven will be among savages, where the strong oppress the weak, and the\nonly law is club law--in fact, much the same as it is at a public or\nlarge school on shore?\"\n\n\"I suspect you are right for once.  You were at a public school: how did\nthey treat you there?\"\n\n\"As you propose treating people here--`the weakest went to the wall.'\"\n\n\"Well, then, a nod's as good as a wink to a blind horse, that's all, my\nhearty,\" said Vigors.\n\nBut the hands being turned up, \"Shorten sail\" put an end to the\naltercation for the present.\n\nAs our hero had not yet received orders to go to his duty, he remained\nbelow with Mesty.\n\n\"By de powers, Massa Easy, but I lub you with my hole soul,\" said Mesty.\n\"By Jasus, you really tark fine, Massa Easy; dat Mr Vigor--nebber care\nfor him, wouldn't you lik him--and sure you would,\" continued the black,\nfeeling the muscle of Jack's arm.  \"By the soul of my fader, I'd bet my\nweek's allowance on you anyhow.  Nebber be 'fraid, Massa Easy.\"\n\n\"I am not afraid,\" replied Jack; \"I've thrashed bigger fellows than he;\"\nand Jack's assertion was true.  Mr Bonnycastle never interfered in a\nfair fight, and took no notice of black eyes, provided the lessons were\nwell said.  Jack had fought and fought again, until he was a very good\nbruiser, and although not so tall as Vigors, he was much better built\nfor fighting.  A knowing Westminster boy would have bet his half-crown\nupon Jack, had he seen him and his anticipated adversary.\n\nThe constant battles which Jack was obliged to fight at school had been\nbrought forward by Jack against his father's arguments in favour of\nequality, but they had been overruled by Mr Easy's pointing out that\nthe combats of _boys_ had nothing to do with the rights of man.\n\nAs soon as the watch was called, Vigors, O'Connor, Gossett, and\nGascoigne, came down from the berth.  Vigors, who was strongest in the\nberth, except Jolliffe, had successively had his superiority\nacknowledged, and, when on deck, he had talked of Easy's impertinence,\nand his intention of bringing him to his senses.  The others, therefore,\ncame down to see the fun.\n\n\"Well, Mr Easy,\" observed Vigors, as he came into the berth, \"you take\nafter your name, at all events; I suppose you intend to eat the king's\nprovision, and do nothing.\"\n\nJack's mettle was already up.\n\n\"You will oblige me, sir, by minding your own business,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"You impudent blackguard, if you say another word I'll give you a good\nthrashing, and knock some of your equality out of you.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" replied Jack, who almost fancied himself back at Mr\nBonnycastle's; \"we'll try that.\"\n\nWhereupon Jack very coolly divested himself of his upper garments,\nneckerchief, and shirt, much to the surprise of Mr Vigors, who little\ncontemplated such a proof of decision and confidence, and still more to\nthe delight of the other midshipmen, who would have forfeited a week's\nallowance to see Vigors well thrashed.  Vigors, however, knew that he\nhad gone too far to retreat; he therefore prepared for action; and, when\nready, the whole party went out into the steerage to settle the\nbusiness.\n\nVigors had gained his assumed authority more by bullying than fighting;\nothers had submitted to him without a sufficient trial; Jack, on the\ncontrary, had won his way up in school by hard and scientific combat:\nthe result, therefore, may easily be imagined.  In less than a quarter\nof an hour Vigors, beaten dead, with his eyes closed, and three teeth\nout, gave in; while Jack, after a basin of water, looked as fresh as\never, with the exception of a few trifling scratches.\n\nThe news of this victory was soon through the ship; and before Jack had\nresumed his clothes, it had been told confidentially by Sawbridge to the\ncaptain.\n\n\"So soon!\" said Captain Wilson, laughing; \"I expected that a\nmidshipman's berth would do wonders; but I did not expect this, yet\nawhile.  This victory is the first severe blow to Mr Easy's equality,\nand will be more valuable than twenty defeats.  Let him now go to his\nduty: he will soon find his level.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\n\nIN WHICH OUR HERO PROVES THAT ALL ON BOARD SHOULD EQUALLY SACRIFICE\nDECENCY TO DUTY.\n\nThe success of any young man in a profession very much depends upon the\noccurrences at the commencement of his career, as from those is his\ncharacter judged, and he is treated accordingly.  Jack had chosen to\nenter the Service at a much later period than most lads; he was tall and\nmanly for his age, and his countenance, if not strictly handsome, wore\nthat expression of honesty and boldness which is sure to please.  His\nspirit in not submitting to, and meeting Vigors when he had hardly\nrecovered from his severe prostration of sea-sickness, had gained him\nwith the many respect, and with all, except his antagonist and Mr\nSmallsole, goodwill.  Instead of being laughed at by his messmates, he\nwas played with; for Jolliffe smiled at his absurdities, and attempted\nto reason him out of them, and the others liked Jack for himself and his\ngenerosity, and, more over, because they looked up to him as a protector\nagainst Vigors, who had persecuted them all; for Jack had declared, that\nas might was right in a midshipman's berth, he would so far restore\nequality, that if he could not put down those who were the strongest, at\nall events he would protect the weak, and, let who would come into the\nberth, they must be his master before they should tyrannise over those\nweaker than he.\n\nThus did Jack Easy make the best use that he could of his strength, and\nbecome, as it were, the champion and security of those who, although\nmuch longer at sea and more experienced than he was, were glad to\nshelter themselves under his courage and skill, the latter of which had\nexcited the admiration of the butcher of the ship, who had been a\npugilist by profession.  Thus did Jack at once take the rank of an\noldster, and soon became the leader of all the mischief.  We\nparticularly observe this, because, had it so happened that our hero had\nsuccumbed to Vigors, the case would have been the very reverse.  He then\nwould have had to go through the ordeal to which most who enter the\nnaval service are exposed, which cannot be better explained than by\ncomparing it to the fagging carried to such an iniquitous extent in\npublic schools.\n\nMr Asper, for his own reasons, made him his companion: they walked the\nnight-watch together, and he listened to all Jack's nonsense about the\nrights of man.  And here Mr Asper did good without intending it, for,\nat the same time that he appeared to agree with Jack, to secure his\nfavour, he cautioned him, and pointed out why this equality could not\nexist altogether on board of a man-of-war.\n\nAs for himself, he said, he saw no difference between a lieutenant, or\neven a captain, and a midshipman, provided they were gentlemen: he\nshould choose his friends where he liked, and despised that power of\nannoyance which the service permitted.  Of course, Jack and Mr Asper\nwere good friends, especially as, when half the watch was over, to\nconciliate his good will and to get rid of his eternal arguing, Mr\nAsper would send Jack down to bed.\n\nThey were now entering the Straits, and expected to anchor the next day\nat Gibraltar, and Jack was forward on the forecastle, talking with\nMesty, with whom he had contracted a great friendship, for there was\nnothing that Mesty would not have done for Jack, although he had not\nbeen three weeks in the ship; but a little reflection will show that it\nwas natural.\n\nMesty had been a great man in his own country; he had suffered all the\nhorrors of a passage in a slave ship; he had been sold as a slave twice;\nhe had escaped--but he found that the universal feeling was strong\nagainst his colour, and that on board of a man-of-war he was condemned,\nalthough free, to the humblest of offices.\n\nHe had never heard any one utter the sentiments, which _now_ beat in his\nown heart, of liberty and equality--we say _now_, for when he was in his\nown country before his captivity, he had no ideas of equality; no one\nhas who is in power: but he had been schooled; and although people\ntalked of liberty and equality at New York, he found that what they\npreached for themselves, they did not practise towards others, and that,\nin the midst of liberty and equality, he and thousands more were\nenslaved and degraded beings.\n\nEscaping to England, he had regained his liberty, but not his equality;\nhis colour had prevented the latter, and in that feeling all the world\nappeared to conspire together against him, until, to his astonishment,\nhe heard those sentiments boldly expressed from the lips of Jack, and\nthat in a service where it was almost tantamount to mutiny.  Mesty,\nwhose character is not yet developed, immediately took a fondness for\nour hero, and in a hundred ways showed his attachment.  Jack also liked\nMesty, and was fond of talking with him, and every evening, since the\ncombat with Vigors, they had generally met in the forecastle to discuss\nthe principles of equality and the rights of man.\n\nThe boatswain, whose name was Biggs, was a slight, dapper, active little\nman, who, as captain of the foretop, had shown an uncommon degree of\ncourage in a hurricane, so much so, as to recommend him to the admiral\nfor promotion.  It was given to him; and after the ship to which he had\nbeen appointed was paid off, he had been ordered to join H.M. sloop\n_Harpy_.  Jack's conversation with Mesty was interrupted by the voice of\nthe boatswain, who was haranguing his boy.  \"It's now ten minutes, sir,\nby my repeater,\" said the boatswain, \"that I have sent for you;\" and Mr\nBiggs pulled out a huge silver watch, almost as big as a Norfolk turnip.\nA Jew had sold him the watch; the boatswain had heard of repeaters, and\nwished to have one.  Moses had only shown him watches with the hour and\nminute hands; he now produced one with a second hand, telling him it was\na repeater.\n\n\"What makes it a repeater?\" inquired the boatswain.\n\n\"Common watches,\" said the cunning Jew, \"only tell the minutes and the\nhours; but all repeaters tell the seconds.\"\n\nThe boatswain was satisfied--bought the watch, and, although many had\ntold him it was no repeater, he insisted that it _was_, and would call\nit so.\n\n\"I swear,\" continued the boatswain, \"it's ten minutes and twenty seconds\nby my repeater.\"\n\n\"If you please, sir,\" said the boy, \"I was changing my trousers when you\nsent for me, and then I had to stow away my bag again.\"\n\n\"Silence, sir; I'd have you to know that when you are sent for by your\nofficer, trousers or no trousers, it is your duty to come up directly.\"\n\n\"Without trousers, sir!\" replied the boy.\n\n\"Yes, sir, without trousers; if the captain required me, I should come\nwithout my shirt.  Duty before decency.\"  So saying, the boatswain lays\nhold of the boy.\n\n\"Surely, Mr Biggs,\" said Jack, \"you are not going to punish that boy\nfor not coming up without his trousers!\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr Easy, I am--I must teach him a lesson.  We are bound, now that\nnewfangled ideas are brought into the ship, to uphold the dignity of the\nservice; and the orders of an officer are not to be delayed ten minutes\nand twenty seconds because a boy has no trousers on.\"  Whereupon the\nboatswain administered several smart cuts with his rattan upon the boy,\nproving that it was quite as well that he had put on his trousers before\nhe came on deck.  \"There,\" said Mr Biggs, \"is a lesson for you, you\nscamp--and, Mr Easy, it is a lesson for you also,\" continued the\nboatswain, walking away with a most consequential air.\n\n\"Murder Irish!\" said Mesty--\"how him cut caper.  De oder day he hawl out\nde weather ear-ring, and touch him hat to a midshipman.  Sure enough,\nmake um cat laugh.\"\n\nThe next day, the _Harpy_ was at anchor in Gibraltar Bay; the captain\nwent on shore, directing the gig to be sent for him before nine o'clock;\nafter which hour the sally-port is only opened by special permission.\nThere happened to be a ball given by the officers of the garrison on\nthat evening, and a polite invitation was sent to the officers of H.M.\nsloop _Harpy_.  As those who accepted the invitation would be detained\nlate, it was not possible for them to come off that night.  And as their\nservices were required for the next day, Captain Wilson allowed them to\nremain on shore until seven o'clock the next morning, at which hour, as\nthere was a large party, there would be two boats sent for them.\n\nMr Asper obtained leave, and asked permission to take our hero with\nhim; to which Mr Sawbridge consented.  Many other officers obtained\nleave, and, among others, the boatswain, who, aware that his services\nwould be in request as soon as the equipment commenced, asked permission\nfor this evening.  And Mr Sawbridge, feeling that he could be better\nspared at this than at any other time, consented.  Asper and Jack went\nto an inn, dined, bespoke beds, and then dressed themselves for the\nball, which was very brilliant, and, from the company of the officers,\nvery pleasant.  Captain Wilson looked on at the commencement, and then\nreturned on board.  Jack behaved with his usual politeness, danced till\ntwo o'clock, and then, as the ball thinned, Asper proposed that they\nshould retire.  Having once more applied to the refreshment-room, they\nhad procured their hats, and were about to depart, when one of the\nofficers of the garrison asked Jack if he would like to see a baboon,\nwhich had just been brought down from the rock; and, taking some of the\ncakes, they repaired to the court where the animal was chained down to a\nsmall tank.  Jack fed the brute till all the cakes were gone, and then,\nbecause he had no more to give him, the baboon flew at Jack, who, in\nmaking his retreat, fell back into the tank, which was about two feet\ndeep.  This was a joke; and having laughed heartily, they wished the\nofficer good-night, and went to the inn.\n\nNow, what with the number of officers of the _Harpy_ on shore, who had\nall put up at the same inn, and other occupants, the landlord was\nobliged to put his company into double and treble bedded rooms; but this\nwas of little consequence.  Jack was shown into a doubled-bedded room,\nand proceeded to undress; the other was evidently occupied, by the heavy\nbreathing which saluted Jack's ear.\n\nAs Jack undressed, he recollected that his trousers were wet through,\nand to dry them he opened the window, hung them out, and then jammed\ndown the window again upon them, to hold them in their position, after\nwhich he turned in and fell fast asleep.  At six o'clock he was called,\nas he had requested, and proceeded to dress, but to his astonishment\nfound the window thrown open and his trousers missing.  It was evident\nthat his partner in the room had thrown the window open during the\nnight, and that his trousers, having fallen down into the street, had\nbeen walked off with by somebody or another.  Jack looked out of the\nwindow once more, and perceived that whoever had thrown open the window\nhad been unwell during the night.  A nice drunken companion I have had,\nthought Jack; but what's to be done?  And in saying this, he walked up\nto the other bed, and perceived that it was tenanted by the boatswain.\nWell, thought Jack, as Mr Biggs has thought proper to lose my trousers,\nI think I have a right to take his, or at least the wear of them, to go\non board.  It was but last night he declared that decency must give way\nto duty, and that the orders of a superior officer were to be obeyed,\nwith or without garments.  I know he is obliged to be on board, and now\nhe shall try how he likes to obey orders in his shirt tails.  So\ncogitating, Jack took the trousers of the boatswain, who still snored,\nalthough he had been called, and, putting them on, completed the rest of\nhis dress, and quitted the room.  He went to that of Mr Asper, where he\nfound him just ready, and, having paid the bill--for Asper had forgotten\nhis purse--they proceeded down to the sally-port, where they found other\nofficers waiting, sufficient to load the first boat, which shoved off,\nand they went on board.  As soon as he was down below, Jack hastened to\nchange his trousers, and, unobserved by any one, threw those belonging\nto Mr Biggs on a chair in his cabin, and, having made a confidant of\nMesty, who was delighted, he went on deck, and waited the issue of the\naffair.\n\nBefore Jack left the hotel, he had told the waiter that there was the\nboatswain still fast asleep, and that he must be roused up immediately;\nand this injunction was obeyed.  The boatswain, who had drunk too much\nthe night before, and, as Jack had truly imagined, had opened the window\nbecause he was unwell, was wakened up, and, hearing how late it was,\nhastened to dress himself.  Not finding his trousers, he rang the bell,\nsupposing that they had been taken down to be brushed, and, in the\nmeantime, put on everything else, that he might lose no time: the waiter\nwho answered the bell denied having taken the trousers out of the room,\nand poor Mr Biggs was in a sad quandary.  What had become of them, he\ncould not tell: he had no recollection of having gone to bed the night\nbefore; he inquired of the waiter, who said that he knew nothing about\nthem--that he was very tipsy when he came home, and that when he called\nhim, he had found the window open, and it appeared that he had been\nunwell--he supposed that he had thrown his trousers out of the window.\nTime flew, and the boatswain was in despair.  \"Could they lend him a\npair?\"\n\n\"He would call his master.\"\n\nThe master of the inn knew very well the difference of rank between\nofficers, and those whom he could trust and those whom he could not.  He\nsent up the bill by the waiter, and stated that, for a deposit, the\ngentleman might have a pair of trousers.  The boatswain felt in his\npockets and remembered that all his money was in his trousers' pocket.\nHe could not only not leave a deposit, but could not pay his bill.  The\nlandlord was inexorable.  It was bad enough to lose his money, but he\ncould not lose more.\n\n\"I shall be tried by a court-martial, by heavens!\" exclaimed the\nboatswain.  \"It's not far from the sally-port; I'll make a run for it,\nand I can slip into one of the boats and get another pair of trousers\nbefore I report myself as having come on board;\" so, making up his mind,\nthe boatswain took to his heels, and with his check shirt tails\nstreaming in the wind, ran as hard as he could to where the boat was\nwaiting to receive him.  He was encountered by many, but he only ran the\nfaster the more they jeered, and, at last, arrived breathless at his\ngoal, flew down the steps, jumped into the boat, and squatted on the\nstern sheets, much to the surprise of the officers and men, who thought\nhim mad.  He stated in a few words that somebody had stolen his trousers\nduring the night; and as it was already late, the boat shoved off, the\nmen as well as the officers convulsed with laughter.\n\n\"Have any of you a pea-jacket?\" inquired the boatswain of the men--but\nthe weather was so warm that none of them had brought a pea-jacket.  The\nboatswain looked round; he perceived that the officers were sitting on a\nboat-cloak.\n\n\"Whose boat-cloak is that?\" inquired the boatswain.\n\n\"Mine,\" replied Gascoigne.\n\n\"I trust, Mr Gascoigne, you will have the kindness to lend it to me to\ngo up the side with.\"\n\n\"Indeed I will not,\" replied Gascoigne, who would sooner have thrown it\noverboard and have lost it, than not beheld the anticipated fun;\n\"recollect I asked you for a fishing-line, when we were becalmed off\nCape St. Vincent, and you sent word that you'd see me damned first.  Now\nI'll see you the same before you have my boat-cloak.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr Gascoigne, I'll give you three lines, directly I get on board.\"\n\n\"I dare say you will, but that won't do now.  `Tit for tat,' Mr\nBoatswain, and hang all favours,\" replied Gascoigne, who was steering\nthe boat, having been sent on shore for the others.  \"In bow--rowed of\nall.\"  The boat was laid alongside--the relentless Gascoigne caught up\nhis boat-cloak as the other officers rose to go on board, and rolling it\nup, in spite of the earnest entreaties of Mr Biggs, tossed it into the\nmain chains to the man who had thrown the stern-fast, and to make the\nsituation of Mr Biggs still more deplorable, the first lieutenant was\nstanding looking into the boat, and Captain Wilson walking the quarter\ndeck.\n\n\"Come, Mr Biggs, I expected you off in the first boat,\" cried Mr\nSawbridge; \"be as smart as you please, for the yards are not yet\nsquared.\"\n\n\"Shall I go ahead in this boat, and square them, sir?\"\n\n\"That boat, no; let her drop astern, jump up here and lower down the\ndinghy.  What the devil do you sit there for, Mr Biggs?--you'll oblige\nme by showing a little more activity, or, by Jove, you may save yourself\nthe trouble of asking to go on shore again.  Are you sober, sir?\"\n\nThe last observation decided Mr Biggs.  He sprung up from the boat just\nas he was, and touched his hat as he passed the first lieutenant.\n\n\"Perfectly sober, sir, but I've lost my trousers.\"\n\n\"So it appears, sir,\" replied Mr Sawbridge, as Mr Biggs stood on the\nplaneshear of the sloop where the hammock netting divides for an\nentrance, with his shirt tails fluttering in the sea breeze; but Mr\nSawbridge could not contain himself any longer; he ran down the ship\nladder which led on the quarter deck, choked with laughter.  Mr Biggs\ncould not descend until after Mr Sawbridge, and the conversation had\nattracted the notice of all, and every eye in the ship was on him.\n\n\"What's all this?\" said Captain Wilson, coming to the gangway.\n\n\"Duty before decency,\" replied Jack, who stood by, enjoying the joke.\n\nMr Biggs recollected the day before--he cast a furious look at Jack, as\nhe touched his hat to the captain, and then dived down to the lower\ndeck.\n\nIf anything could add to the indignation of the boatswain, it was to\nfind that his trousers had come on board before him.  He now felt that a\ntrick had been played him, and also that our hero must have been the\nparty, but he could prove nothing; he could not say who slept in the\nsame room, for he was fast asleep when Jack went to bed, and fast asleep\nwhen Jack quitted the room.\n\nThe truth of the story soon became known to all the ship, and \"duty\nbefore decency\" became a by-word.  All that the boatswain could do he\ndid, which was to revenge himself upon the poor boy--and Gascoigne and\nJack never got any fishing-tackle.  The boatswain was as obnoxious to\nthe men as Vigors, and in consequence of Jack's known opinions upon the\nrights of man, and his having floored their two greatest enemies, he\nbecame a great favourite with the seamen, and, as all favourites are\nhonoured by them with a sobriquet, our hero obtained that of _Equality\nJack_.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\n\nIN WHICH OUR HERO PREFERS GOING DOWN TO GOING UP; A CHOICE, IT IS TO BE\nHOPED, HE WILL REVERSE UPON A MORE IMPORTANT OCCASION.\n\nThe next day being Sunday, the hands were turned up to divisions, and\nthe weather not being favourable, instead of the Service, the articles\nof war were read with all due respect shown to the same, the captain,\nofficers, and crew with their hats off in a mizzling rain.  Jack, who\nhad been told by the captain that these articles of war were the rules\nand regulations of the service, by which the captain, officers, and men\nwere equally bound, listened to them as they were read by the clerk with\nthe greatest attention.  He little thought that there were about five\nhundred orders from the admiralty tacked on to them, which, like the\nnumerous codicils of some wills, contained the most important matter,\nand to a certain degree make the will nugatory.\n\nJack listened very attentively, and, as each article was propounded,\nfelt that he was not likely to commit himself in that point, and,\nalthough he was rather astonished to find such a positive injunction\nagainst swearing, considered quite a dead letter in the ship, he thought\nthat, altogether, he saw his way very clear.  But to make certain of it,\nas soon as the hands had been piped down he begged the clerk to let him\nhave a copy of the articles.\n\nNow the clerk had three, being the allowance of the ship, or at least\nall that he had in his possession, and made some demur at parting with\none; but at last he proposed--\"some rascal,\" as he said, \"having stolen\nhis tooth-brush\"--that if Jack would give him one he would give him one\nof the copies of the articles of war.  Jack replied that the one he had\nin use was very much worn, and that unfortunately he had but one new\none, which he could not spare.  Thereupon the clerk, who was a very\nclean personage, and could not bear that his teeth should be dirty,\nagreed to accept the one in use, as Jack could not part with the other.\nThe exchange was made, and Jack read the articles of war over and over\nagain, till he thought he was fully master of them.\n\n\"Now,\" says Jack, \"I know what I am to do, and what I am to expect, and\nthese articles of war I will carry in my pocket as long as I'm in the\nservice; that is to say, if they last so long; and, provided they do\nnot, I am able to replace them with another old tooth-brush, which\nappears to be the value attached to them.\"\n\nThe _Harpy_ remained a fortnight in Gibraltar Bay, and Jack had\noccasionally a run on shore, and Mr Asper invariably went with him to\nkeep him out of mischief; that is to say, he allowed him to throw his\nmoney away on nobody more worthless than himself.\n\nOne morning Jack went down in the berth, and found young Gossett\nblubbering.\n\n\"What's the matter, my dear Mr Gossett?\" inquired Jack, who was just as\npolite to the youngster as he was to anybody else.\n\n\"Vigors has been thrashing me with a rope's end,\" replied Gossett,\nrubbing his arm and shoulders.\n\n\"What for?\" inquired Jack.\n\n\"Because he says the service is going to hell--(I'm sure it's no fault\nof mine)--and that now all subordination is destroyed, and that upstarts\njoin the ship who, because they have a five-pound note in their pocket,\nare allowed to do just as they please.  He said he was determined to\nuphold the service, and then he knocked me down--and when I got up again\nhe told me that I could stand a little more--and then he took out his\ncolt, and said he was determined to ride the high horse--and that there\nshould be no Equality Jack in future.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"And then he colted me for half an hour, and that's all.\"\n\n\"By de soul of my fader, but it all for true, Massa Easy--he larrap, um,\nsure enough--all for noteing, bad luck to him--I tink,\" continued Mesty,\n\"he hab debelish bad memory--and he want a little more of Equality\nJack.\"\n\n\"And he shall have it too,\" replied our hero; \"why, it's against the\narticles of war, `all quarrelling, fighting, etc.'  I say, Mr Gossett,\nhave you got the spirit of a louse?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Gossett.\n\n\"Well, then, will you do what I tell you next time, and trust to me for\nprotection?\"\n\n\"I don't care what I do,\" replied the boy, \"if you will back me against\nthe cowardly tyrant.\"\n\n\"Do you refer to me?\" cried Vigors, who had stopped at the door of the\nberth.\n\n\"Say yes,\" said Jack.\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" cried Gossett.\n\n\"You do, do you?--well then, my chick, I must trouble you with a little\nmore of this,\" said Vigors, drawing out his colt.\n\n\"I think that you had better not, Mr Vigors,\" observed Jack.\n\n\"Mind your own business, if you please,\" returned Vigors, not much\nliking the interference.  \"I am not addressing my conversation to you,\nand I will thank you never to interfere with me.  I presume I have a\nright to choose my own acquaintance, and, depend upon it, it will not be\nthat of a leveller.\"\n\n\"All that is at your pleasure, Mr Vigors,\" replied Jack, \"you have a\nright to choose your own acquaintance, and so have I a right to choose\nmy own friends, and further, to support them.  That lad is my friend,\nMr Vigors.\"\n\n\"Then,\" replied Vigors, who could not help bullying even at the risk of\nanother combat which he probably intended to stand, \"I shall take the\nliberty of giving your friend a thrashing;\" and he suited the action to\nthe word.\n\n\"Then I shall take the liberty to defend my friend,\" replied Jack; \"and\nas you call me a leveller, I'll try if I may not deserve the name\"--\nwhereupon Jack placed a blow so well under the ear, that Mr Vigors\ndropped on the deck, and was not in condition to come to the scratch,\neven if he had been inclined.  \"And now, youngster,\" said Jack, wresting\nthe colt out of Vigors's hand, \"do as I bid you--give him a good\ncolting--if you don't I'll thrash you.\"\n\nGossett required no second threat--the pleasure of thrashing his enemy,\nif only for once, was quite enough--and he laid well on.  Jack with his\nfists doubled ready to protect him if there was a show of resistance,\nbut Vigors was half stupified with the blow under the ear, and quite\ncowed; he took his thrashing in the most passive manner.\n\n\"That will do,\" said Jack, \"and now do not be afraid, Gossett; the very\nfirst time he offers to strike you when I am not present, I will pay him\noff for it as soon as you tell me.  I won't be called Equality Jack for\nnothing.\"\n\nWhen Jolliffe, who heard of this, met our hero alone, he said to him,\n\"Take my advice, boy, and do not in future fight the battles of others,\nyou'll find very soon that you will have enough to do to fight your\nown.\"\n\nWhereupon Jack argued the point for half an hour, and then they\nseparated.  But Mr Jolliffe was right.  Jack began to find himself\nconstantly in hot water, and the captain and first lieutenant, although\nthey did not really withdraw their protection, thought it high time that\nJack should find out that, on board a man-of-war, everybody and\neverything must find its level.\n\nThere was on board of his Majesty's sloop _Harpy_, a man of the name of\nEasthupp, who did the duty of purser's steward; this was the second ship\nthat he had served in; in the former he had been sent with a draft of\nmen from the Tender lying off the Tower.  How he had come into the\nservice was not known in the present ship, but the fact was, that he had\nbeen one of the swell mob--and had been sent on board the Tender with a\nletter of recommendation from the magistrates to Captain Crouch.  He was\na cockney by birth, for he had been left at the workhouse of St. Mary\nAxe, where he had, been taught to read and write, and had afterwards\nmade his escape.  He joined the juvenile thieves of the metropolis, had\nbeen sent to Bridewell, obtained his liberty, and by degrees had risen\nfrom petty thieving of goods exposed outside of the shops and\nmarket-stalls, to the higher class of gentlemen pickpockets.  His\nappearance was some what genteel, with a bullying sort of an impudent\nair, which is mistaken for fashion by those who know no better.  A\nremarkable neat dresser, for that was part of his profession; a very\nplausible manner and address; a great fluency of language, although he\nclipped the king's English; and, as he had suffered more than once by\nthe law, it is not to be wondered at that he was, as he called himself,\na _hout-and-hout_ radical.  During the latter part of his service, in\nhis last ship, he had been employed under the purser's steward, and\nhaving offered himself in this capacity to the purser of H.M. sloop\n_Harpy_, with one or two forged certificates, he had been accepted.\n\nNow, when Mr Easthupp heard of Jack's opinions, he wished to cultivate\nhis acquaintance, and with a bow and a flourish, introduced himself\nbefore they arrived at Gibraltar, but our hero took an immediate dislike\nto this fellow from his excessive and impertinent familiarity.\n\nJack knew a gentleman when he met one, and did not choose to be a\ncompanion to a man beneath him in every way, but who, upon the strength\nof Jack's liberal opinions, presumed to be his equal.  Jack's equality\ndid not go so far as that; in theory it was all very well, but in\npractice it was only when it suited his own purpose.\n\nBut the purser's steward was not to be checked--a man who has belonged\nto the swell mob is not easily repulsed; and although Jack would plainly\nshow him that his company was not agreeable, Easthupp would constantly\naccost him familiarly on the forecastle and lower deck, with his arms\nfolded, and with an air almost amounting to superiority.  At last, Jack\ntold him to go about his business, and not to presume to talk to him,\nwhereupon Easthupp rejoined, and after an exchange of hard words, it\nended by Jack kicking Mr Easthupp, as he called himself, down the\nafter-lower-deck hatchway.  This was but a sorry specimen of Jack's\nequality--and Mr Easthupp, who considered that his honour had been\ncompromised, went up to the captain on the quarter-deck, and lodged his\ncomplaint--whereupon Captain Wilson desired that Mr Easy might be\nsummoned.\n\nAs soon as Jack made his appearance, Captain Wilson called to Easthupp.\n\"Now, purser's steward, what is this you have to say?\"\n\n\"If you please, Captain Vilson, I am wery sorry to be obliged to make\nhany complaint of hany hofficer, but this Mr Heasy thought proper to\nmake use of language quite hunbecoming of a gentleman, and then to kick\nme as I vent down the atchvay.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr Easy, is this true?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Jack; \"I have several times told the fellow not to\naddress himself to me, and he will.  I did tell him he was a radical\nblackguard, and I did kick him down the hatchway.\"\n\n\"You told him he was a radical blackguard, Mr Easy?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; he comes bothering me about his republic, and asserting that\nwe have no want of a king and aristocracy.\"\n\nCaptain Wilson looked significantly at Mr Sawbridge.\n\n\"I crtainly did hoffer my political opinions, Captain Vilson; but you\nmust be avare that ve hall ave an hequal stake in the country--and it's\na Hinglishman's birthright.\"\n\n\"I'm not aware what your stake in the country may be, Mr Easthupp,\"\nobserved Captain Wilson, \"but I think that, if you used such\nexpressions, Mr Easy was fully warranted in telling you his opinion.\"\n\n\"I ham villing, Captain Vilson, to make hany hallowance for the eat of\npolitical discussion--but that is not hall that I ave to complain hof.\nMr Easy thought proper to say that I was a swindler and a liar.\"\n\n\"Did you make use of those expressions, Mr Easy?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, he did,\" continued the steward, \"and, moreover, told me not\nto cheat the men, and not to cheat my master the purser.  Now, Captain\nVilson, is it not true that I am in a wery hostensible sitevation, but I\nflatter myself that I ave been vell edecated, and vos vonce moving in a\nwery different society--misfortains vill appin to us hall, and I feel my\ncharacter has been severely injured by such impertations;\" whereupon Mr\nEasthupp took out his handkerchief, flourished, and blew his nose.  \"I\ntold Mr Heasy that I considered myself quite as much of a gentleman as\nhimself, and at hall hewents did not keep company with a black feller\n(Mr Heasy will understand the insinevation), vereupon Mr Heasy, as I\nbefore said, your vorship, I mean you, Captain Vilson, thought proper to\nkick me down the atchvay.\"\n\n\"Very well, steward, I have heard your complaint, and now you may go.\"\n\nMr Easthupp took his hat off with an air, made his bow, and went down\nthe main ladder.\n\n\"Mr Easy,\" said Captain Wilson, \"you must be aware that, by the\nregulations of the service by which we are all equally bound, it is not\npermitted that any officer shall take the law into his own hands.  Now,\nalthough I do not consider it necessary to make any remark as to your\ncalling the man a radical blackguard, for I consider his impertinent\nintrusion of his opinions deserved it, still you have no right to attack\nany man's character without grounds--and as that man is in an office of\ntrust, you were not at all warranted in asserting that he was a cheat.\nWill you explain to me why you made use of such language?\"\n\nNow our hero had no proofs against the man; he had nothing to offer in\nextenuation, until he recollected, all at once, the reason assigned by\nthe captain for the language used by Mr Sawbridge.  Jack had the wit to\nperceive that it would hit home, so he replied, very quietly and\nrespectfully:\n\n\"If you please, Captain Wilson, that was all zeal.\"\n\n\"Zeal, Mr Easy?  I think it but a bad excuse.  But pray, then, why did\nyou kick the man down the hatchway?--you must have known that that was\ncontrary to the rules of the service.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Jack demurely, \"but that was all zeal too.\"\n\n\"Then allow me to say,\" replied Captain Wilson, biting his lips, \"that I\nthink that your zeal has in this instance been very much misplaced, and\nI trust you will not show so much again.\"\n\n\"And yet, sir,\" replied Jack, aware that he was giving the captain a\nhard hit, and therefore looked proportionally humble, \"we should do\nnothing in the service without it--and I trust one day, as you told me,\nto become a very zealous officer.\"\n\n\"I trust so too, Mr Easy,\" replied the captain.  \"There, you may go\nnow, and let me hear no more of kicking people down the hatchway.  That\nsort of zeal is misplaced.\"\n\n\"More than my foot was, at all events,\" muttered Jack, as he walked off.\n\nCaptain Wilson, as soon as our hero disappeared, laughed heartily, and\ntold Mr Sawbridge \"he had ascribed his language to our hero as all\nzeal.  He has very cleverly given me it all back again; and really,\nSawbridge, as it proves how weak was my defence of you, you may gain\nfrom this lesson.\"\n\nSawbridge thought so too--but both agreed that Jack's rights of man were\nin considerable danger.\n\nThe day before the ship sailed, the Captain and Mr Asper dined with the\ngovernor, and as there was little more to do, Mr Sawbridge, who had not\nquitted the ship since she had been in port, and had some few purchases\nto make, left her in the afternoon in the charge of Mr Smallsole, the\nmaster.  Now, as we have observed, he was Jack's inveterate enemy--\nindeed Jack had already made three, Mr Smallsole, Mr Biggs the\nboatswain, and Easthupp, the purser's steward.  Mr Smallsole was glad\nto be left in command, as he hoped to have an opportunity of punishing\nour hero, who certainly laid himself not a little open to it.\n\nLike all those who are seldom in command, the master was proportionally\ntyrannical and abusive--he swore at the men, made them do the duty twice\nand thrice over on the pretence that it was not smartly done, and found\nfault with every officer remaining on board.\n\n\"Mr Biggs--by God, sir, you seem to be all asleep forward; I suppose\nyou think that you are to do nothing, now the first lieutenant is out of\nthe ship?  How long will it be, sir, before you are ready to sway away?\"\n\n\"By de holy poker, I tink he sway away finely, Massa Easy,\" observed\nMesty, who was in converse with our hero on the forecastle.\n\nMr Smallsole's violence made Mr Biggs violent, which made the\nboatswain's mate violent--and the captain of the forecastle violent\nalso; all which is practically exemplified by philosophy in the laws of\nmotion, communicated from one body to another: and as Mr Smallsole\nswore, so did the boatswain swear--also the boatswain's mate, the\ncaptain of the forecastle, and all the men; showing the force of\nexample.\n\nMr Smallsole came forward--\"Damnation, Mr Biggs, what the devil are\nyou about? can't you move here?\"\n\n\"As much as we can, sir,\" replied the boatswain, \"lumbered as the\nforecastle is with idlers;\" and here Mr Biggs looked at our hero and\nMesty, who were standing against the bulwark.\n\n\"What are you doing here, sir?\" cried Mr Smallsole to our hero.\n\n\"Nothing at all, sir,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"Then I'll give you something to do, sir.  Go up to the mast-head, and\nwait there till I call you down.  Come, sir, I'll show you the way,\"\ncontinued the master, walking aft.  Jack followed till they were on the\nquarter-deck.\n\n\"Now, sir, up to the main-top gallant mast-head; perch yourself upon the\ncross trees--up with you.\"\n\n\"What am I to go up there for, sir?\" inquired Jack.\n\n\"For punishment, sir,\" replied the master.\n\n\"What have I done, sir?\"\n\n\"No reply, sir--up with you.\"\n\n\"If you please, sir,\" replied Jack, \"I should wish to argue this point a\nlittle.\"\n\n\"Argue the point,\" roared Mr Smallsole.  \"By Jove, I'll teach you to\nargue the point--away with you, sir.\"\n\n\"If you please, sir,\" continued Jack, \"the captain told me that the\narticles of war were the rules and regulations by which every one in the\nservice was to be guided.  Now, sir,\" said Jack, \"I have read them over\ntill I know them by heart, and there is not one word of mast-heading in\nthe whole of them.\"  Here Jack took the articles out of his pocket, and\nunfolded them.\n\n\"Will you go to the mast-head, sir, or will you not?\" said Mr\nSmallsole.\n\n\"Will you show me the mast-head in the articles of war, sir,\" replied\nJack; \"here they are.\"\n\n\"I tell you, sir, to go to the mast-head if not, I'll be damned if I\ndon't hoist you up in a bread-bag.\"\n\n\"There's nothing about bread-bags in the articles of war,\" replied Jack;\n\"but I'll tell you what there is, sir,\" and Jack commenced reading:\n\n\"All flag officers, and all persons in or belonging to his Majesty's\nships or vessels of war, being guilty of profane oaths, execrations,\ndrunkenness, uncleanness, or other scandalous actions, in derogation of\nGod's honour, and corruption of good manners, shall incur such\npunishment as--\"\n\n\"Damnation,\" cried the master, who was mad with rage, hearing that the\nwhole ship's company were laughing.\n\n\"No, sir, not damnation,\" replied Jack, \"that's when he's tried above;\nbut according to the nature and degree of the offence--\"\n\n\"Will you go to the mast-head, sir, or will you not?\"\n\n\"If you please,\" replied Jack, \"I'd rather not.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, consider yourself under an arrest--I'll try you by a\ncourt-martial, by God.  Go down below, sir.\"\n\n\"With the greatest of pleasure, sir,\" replied Jack, \"that's all right,\nand according to the articles of war, which are to guide us all.\"  Jack\nfolded up his articles of war, put them into his pocket, and went down\ninto the berth.\n\nSoon after Jack had gone down, Jolliffe, who had heard the whole of the\naltercation, followed him.  \"My lad,\" said Jolliffe, \"I'm sorry for all\nthis; you should have gone to the mast-head.\"\n\n\"I should like to argue that point a little,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"Yes, so would everybody; but if that were permitted, the service would\nbe at a standstill--that would not do;--you must obey an order first,\nand then complain afterwards, if the order is unjust.\"\n\n\"It is not so in the articles of war.\"\n\n\"But it is so in the service.\"\n\n\"The captain told me that the articles of war were the guides of the\nservice, and we were all equally bound to obey them.\"\n\n\"Well, but allowing that, I do not think your articles of war will bear\nyou out.  You observe, they say any officer, mariner, etcetera, guilty\nof disobedience to any lawful command.  Now are you not guilty under\nthat article?\"\n\n\"That remains to be argued still,\" replied Jack.  \"A lawful command\nmeans an order established by law; now where is that law?--besides, the\ncaptain told me when I kicked that blackguard down the hatchway, that\nthere was only the captain who could punish, and that officers could not\ntake the law into their own hands; why then has the master?\"\n\n\"His doing wrong as superior officer is no reason why you as an inferior\nshould disobey him.  If that were permitted--if every order were to be\ncavilled at and argued upon, as just or unjust, there would be an end of\nall discipline.  Besides, recollect, that in the service there is\ncustom, which is the same as law.\"\n\n\"That admits of a little argument,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"The service will admit of none, my dear boy: recollect that, even on\nshore, we have two laws, that which is written, and the _lex non\nscripta_, which is custom; of course we have it in the service, for the\narticles of war cannot provide for everything.\"\n\n\"They provide a court-martial for everything though,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"Yes, with death or dismissal from the service--neither of which would\nbe very agreeable.  You have got yourself into a scrape, and although\nthe captain is evidently your friend, he cannot overlook it:\nfortunately, it is with the master, which is of less consequence than\nwith the other officers; but still, you will have to submit, for the\ncaptain cannot overlook it.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what, Jolliffe,\" replied Jack, \"my eyes now begin to be\nopened to a great many things.  The captain tells me, when I am\nastonished at bad language, that it is all zeal, and then I found out\nthat what is all zeal in a superior to an inferior, is insolence when\nreversed.  He tells me, that the articles of war are made to equally\nguide us all--the master breaks what is positively mentioned in the\nsecond article twenty times over, and goes scot free, while I am to be\npunished, because I do not comply with what the articles do not mention.\nHow was I to know that I ought to go to the mast-head for punishment?\nparticularly when the captain tells me that he alone is to punish in the\nship.  If I obey an order in opposition to the captain's order, is not\nthat as bad as disobeying the captain?  I think that I have made out a\nvery strong case, and my arguments are not to be confuted.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid that the master will make out a very strong case, and that\nyour arguments will never be heard.\"\n\n\"That will be contrary to all the rules of justice.\"\n\n\"But according to all the rules of service.\"\n\n\"I do believe that I am a great fool,\" observed Jack, after a pause.\n\"What do you imagine made me come to sea, Jolliffe?\"\n\n\"Because you did not know when you were well off,\" replied the mate\ndryly.\n\n\"That's true enough; but my reason was, because I thought I should find\nthat equality here that I could not find on shore.\"\n\nJolliffe stared.\n\n\"My dear boy, I heard you say that you obtained those opinions from your\nfather; I mean no disrespect to him, but he must be either mad or\nfoolish, if at his age he has not yet discovered that there is no such\nthing in existence.\"\n\n\"I begin to think so,\" replied Jack; \"but that does not prove that there\nought not to be.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon; the very non-existence proves that it ought not to\nbe--`whatever is, is right'--you might as well expect to find perfect\nhappiness or perfection in the individual.  Your father must be a\nvisionary.\"\n\n\"The best thing that I can do is to go home again.\"\n\n\"No, my dear Easy, the best thing that you can do is to stay in the\nservice, for it will soon put an end to all such nonsensical ideas; and\nit will make you a clever, sensible fellow.  The service is a rough, but\na good school, where everybody finds his level--not the level of\nequality, but the level which his natural talent and acquirements will\nrise or sink him to, in proportion as they are plus or minus.  It is a\nnoble service, but has its imperfections, as everything in this world\nmust have.  I have little reason to speak in its favour, as far as I am\nconcerned, for it has been hard bread to me, but there must be\nexceptions in every rule.  Do not think of quitting the service until\nyou have given it a fair trial.  I am aware that you are an only son,\nand your father is a man of property, and, therefore, in the common\nparlance of the world, you are independent; but, believe me, no man,\nhowever rich, is independent, unless he has a profession, and you will\nfind no better than this, notwithstanding--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That you will be, most certainly, sent to the mast-head to-morrow.\"\n\n\"We'll argue that point,\" replied Jack; \"at all events, I will go and\nturn in to-night.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\n\nIN WHICH OUR HERO BEGINS TO ACT AND THINK FOR HIMSELF.\n\nWhatever may have been Jack's thoughts, at all events they did not spoil\nhis rest.  He possessed in himself all the materials of a true\nphilosopher, but there was a great deal of weeding still required.\nJolliffe's arguments, sensible as they were, had very little effect upon\nhim, for, strange to say, it is much more easy to shake a man's opinions\nwhen he is wrong than when he is right; proving that we are all of a\nvery perverse nature.  \"Well,\" thought Jack, \"if I am to go to the\nmast-head, I am, that's all; but it does not prove that my arguments are\nnot good, only that they will not be listened to;\" and then Jack shut\nhis eyes, and in a few minutes was fast asleep.\n\nThe master had reported to the first lieutenant, and the first\nlieutenant to the captain, when he came on board the next morning, the\nconduct of Mr Easy, who was sent for in the cabin, to hear if he had\nany thing to offer in extenuation of his offence.  Jack made an oration,\nwhich lasted more than half an hour, in which all the arguments he had\nbrought forward to Jolliffe in the preceding chapter were entered fully\ninto.  Mr Jolliffe was then examined, and also Mr Smallsole was\ninterrogated: after which the captain and the first lieutenant were left\nalone.\n\n\"Sawbridge,\" said Captain Wilson, \"how true it is that any deviation\nfrom what is right invariably leads us into a scrape.  I have done\nwrong: wishing to get this boy out of his father's hands, and fearful\nthat he would not join the ship, and imagining him to be by no means the\nshrewd fellow that he is in reality, I represented the service in a much\nmore favourable light than I should have done; all that he says I told\nhim I did tell him, and it is I who really led the boy into error.  Mr\nSmallsole has behaved tyrannically and unjustly; he punished the lad for\nno crime; so that what between the master and me, I am now on the horns\nof a dilemma.  If I punish the boy, I feel that I am punishing him more\nfor my own fault and the fault of others, than his own.  If I do not\npunish him, I allow a flagrant and open violation of discipline to pass\nuncensured, which will be injurious to the service.\"\n\n\"He must be punished, sir,\" replied Sawbridge.\n\n\"Send for him,\" said the captain.\n\nJack made his appearance, with a very polite bow.\n\n\"Mr Easy, as you suppose that the articles of war contained all the\nrules and regulations of the service, I take it for granted that you\nhave erred through ignorance.  But recollect, that although you have\nerred through ignorance, such a violation of discipline, if passed\nunnoticed, will have a very injurious effect with the men, whose\nobedience is enforced by the example shown to them by the officers.  I\nfeel so convinced of your zeal, which you showed the other day in the\ncase of Easthupp, that I am sure you will see the propriety of my\nproving to the men, by punishing you, that discipline must be enforced,\nand I shall therefore send for you on the quarter-deck, and order you to\ngo to the mast-head in presence of the ship's company, as it was in the\npresence of the ship's company that you refused.\"\n\n\"With the greatest pleasure, Captain Wilson,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"And in future, Mr Easy, although I shall ever set my face against it,\nrecollect that if any officer punishes you, and you imagine that you are\nunfairly treated, you will submit to the punishment, and then apply to\nme for redress.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir,\" replied Jack, \"now that I am aware of your wishes.\"\n\n\"You will oblige me, Mr Easy, by going on the quarter-deck, and wait\nthere till I come up.\"\n\nJack made his best bow, and exit.\n\n\"Old Jolliffe told me that I should have to go,\" said Jack to himself,\n\"and he was right, so far; but hang me if I hadn't the best of the\nargument, and that's all I care about.\"\n\nCaptain Wilson sent for the master, and reprimanded him for his\noppression, as it was evident that there was no ground for punishment,\nand he forbade him ever to mast-head another midshipman, but to report\nhis conduct to the first lieutenant or himself.  He then proceeded to\nthe quarter-deck, and, calling for Mr Easy, gave him what appeared to\nbe a very severe reprimand, which Jack looked upon very quietly, because\nit was all _zeal_ on the captain's part to give it, and all _zeal_ on\nhis own to take it.  Our hero was then ordered up to the mast-head.\n\nJack took off his hat, and took three or four steps, in obedience to the\norder--and then returned and made his best bow--inquired of Captain\nWilson whether he wished him to go to the fore or to the main-mast head.\n\n\"To the main, Mr Easy,\" replied the captain, biting his lips.\n\nJack ascended three spokes of the Jacob's ladder, when he again stopped,\nand took off his hat.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Captain Wilson--you have not informed me whether it\nis your wish that I should go to the topmast, or the top-gallant\ncross-trees.\"\n\n\"To the top-gallant cross-trees, Mr Easy,\" replied the captain.\n\nJack ascended, taking it very easy: he stopped at the main-top for\nbreath; at the main-topmast head, to look about him; and, at last,\ngained the spot agreed upon, where he seated himself, and, taking out\nthe articles of war, commenced them again, to ascertain whether he could\nnot have strengthened his arguments.  He had not, however, read through\nthe seventh article before the hands were turned up--\"up anchor!\" and\nMr Sawbridge called, \"All hands down from aloft!\"  Jack took the hint,\nfolded up his documents, and came down as leisurely as he went up.  Jack\nwas a much better philosopher than his father.\n\nThe _Harpy_ was soon under way, and made all sail, steering for Cape de\nGatte, where Captain Wilson hoped to pick up a Spanish vessel or two, on\nhis way to Toulon to receive the orders of the admiral.\n\nA succession of light breezes and calms rendered the passage very\ntedious; but the boats were constantly out, chasing the vessels along\nshore, and Jack usually asked to be employed on this service: indeed,\nalthough so short a time afloat, he was, from his age and strength, one\nof the most effective midshipmen, and to be trusted, provided a whim did\nnot come into his head; but hitherto Jack had always been under orders,\nand had always acquitted himself very well.\n\nWhen the _Harpy_ was off Tarragona, it so happened that there were\nseveral cases of dysentery in the ship, and Mr Asper and Mr Jolliffe\nwere two of those who were suffering.  This reduced the number of\nofficers; and, at the same time, they had received information from the\nmen of a fishing-boat, who, to obtain their own release, had given the\nintelligence, that a small convoy was coming down from Rosas as soon as\nthe wind was fair, under the protection of two gun-boats.\n\nCaptain Wilson kept well off-shore until the wind changed, and then,\nallowing for the time that the vessels would take to run down the\ndistance between Tarragona and Rosas, steered in the night, to intercept\nthem; but it again fell calm, and the boats were therefore hoisted out,\nwith directions to proceed along the shore, as it was supposed that the\nvessels could not now be far distant.  Mr Sawbridge had the command of\nthe expedition in the pinnace; the first cutter was in charge of the\ngunner, Mr Minus; and, as the other officers were sick, Mr Sawbridge,\nwho liked Jack more and more every day, at his particular request gave\nhim the command of the second cutter.  As soon as he heard of it, Mesty\ndeclared to our hero that he would go with him; but without permission\nthat was not possible.  Jack obtained leave for Mesty to go in lieu of a\nmarine: there were many men sick of the dysentery, and Mr Sawbridge was\nnot sorry to take an idler out of the ship instead of a working man,\nespecially as Mesty was known to be a good hand.\n\nIt was ten o'clock at night when the boats quitted the ship; and, as it\nwas possible that they might not return till late the next day, one\nday's biscuit and rum were put on board each, that the crews might not\nsuffer from exhaustion.  The boats pulled in-shore, and then coasted for\nthree hours, without seeing anything: the night was fine overhead, but\nthere was no moon.  It still continued calm, and the men began to feel\nfatigued, when, just as they were within a mile of a low point, they\nperceived the convoy over the land, coming down with their sails\nsquared, before a light breeze.\n\nMr Sawbridge immediately ordered the boats to lie upon their oars,\nawaiting their coming, and arranging for the attack.\n\nThe white lateen sails of the gun-boat in advance were now plainly\ndistinguishable from the rest, which were all huddled together in her\nwake.  Down she came like a beautiful swan in the water, her sails just\nfilled with the wind, and running about three knots an hour.  Mr\nSawbridge kept her three masts in one, that they might not be perceived,\nand winded the boats with their heads the same way, so that they might\ndash on board of her with a few strokes of the oars.  So favourable was\nthe course of the gun-boat, that she stood right between the launch on\none bow and the two cutters on the other; and they were not perceived\nuntil they were actually alongside; the resistance was trifling, but\nsome muskets and pistols had been fired, and the alarm was given.  Mr\nSawbridge took possession, with the crew of the launch, and brought the\nvessel to the wind, as he perceived that at the alarm all the convoy had\ndone the same, directing the cutters to board the largest vessels, and\nsecure as many as they could, while he would do the same with the\nlaunch, as he brought them to: but the other gun boat, which had not yet\nbeen seen, and had been forgotten, now made her appearance, and came\ndown in a gallant manner to the support of her comrade.\n\nMr Sawbridge threw half his men into the launch, as she carried a heavy\ncarronade, and sent her to assist the cutters, which had made right for\nthe gun-boat.  A smart firing of round and grape was opened upon the\nboats, which continued to advance upon her; but the officer commanding\nthe gun-boat, finding that he had no support from his consort, and\nconcluding that she had been captured, hauled his wind again, and stood\nout in the offing.  Our hero pulled after her, although he could not see\nthe other boats; but the breeze had freshened, and all pursuit was\nuseless: he therefore directed his course to the convoy, and, after a\nhard pull, contrived to get on board of a one-masted xebeque, of about\nfifty tons.  Mesty, who had eyes as sharp as a needle, had observed that\nwhen the alarm was given, several of the convoy had not rounded the\npoint, and he therefore proposed, as this vessel was very light, that\nthey should make short tacks with her, to weather the point, as if they\nwere escaping, and by that means be able, particularly if it fell calm\nagain, to capture some others.  Jack thought this advice good.  The\nconvoy who had rounded the point had all stood out to seaward with the\ngun-boat, and had now a fresh breeze.  To chase them was therefore\nuseless; and the only chance was to do as Mesty had proposed.  He\ntherefore stood out into the breeze, and, after half an hour, tacked in\nshore, and fetched well to windward of the low point; but finding no\nvessels, he stood out again.  Thus had he made three or four tacks, and\nhad gained, perhaps, six or seven miles, when he perceived signals of\nrecall made to leeward, enforced with guns.\n\n\"Mr Sawbridge wants us to come back, Mesty.\"\n\n\"Mr Sawbridge mind him own business,\" replied Mesty, \"we nebber take\nall dis trubble to ply to windward for noting.\"\n\n\"But, Mesty, we must obey orders.\"\n\n\"Yes, sar, when he have him thumb upon you; but now, must do what tink\nmost proper.  By de powers, he catch me 'fore I go back.\"\n\n\"But we shall lose the ship.\"\n\n\"Find her again, by-and-bye, Massa Easy.\"\n\n\"But they will think that we are lost.\"\n\n\"So much the better, nebba look after us, Massa Easy; I guess we have a\nfine cruise anyhow.  Morrow we take large vessel--make sail, take more,\nden we go to Toulon.\"\n\n\"But I don't know my way to Toulon; I know it lies up this way, and\nthat's all.\"\n\n\"Dat enough, what you want more?  Massa Easy, 'pose you not find fleet,\nfleet soon find you.  By God, nobody nebba lost here.  Now, Massa Easy,\nlet um go 'bout gain.  Somebody else burn biscuit and boil kettle\nto-morrow for de gentlemen.  Murder Irish! only tink, Massa Easy--I boil\nkettle, and prince in my own country!\"\n\nEasy was very much of a mind with Mesty; \"for,\" argued Jack, \"if I go\nback now, I only bring a small vessel half full of beans, and I shall be\nashamed to show my face.  Now it is true, that they may suppose that we\nhave been sunk by the fire of the gun-boat.  Well, what then? they have\na gun-boat to show for their night's work, and it will appear that there\nwas harder fighting than there has been, and Mr Sawbridge may benefit\nby it.\"  (Jack was a very knowing fellow to have learned so much about\nthe service already.) \"Well, and when they discover that we are not\nlost, how glad they will be to find us, especially if we bring some\nprizes--which I will do, or I'll not go back again.  It's not often that\none gets a command before being two months at sea, and, hang me, now\nI've got it if I won't keep it; and Mr Smallsole may mast-head whom he\npleases.  I'm sorry for poor Gossett though; if Vigors supposes me dead\nhow he will murder the poor little fellow--however, it's all for the\ngood of the service, and I'll revenge him when I come back.  Hang me if\nI won't take a cruise.\"\n\n\"I talk to the men, they say thay all tick to you like leech.  Now dat\njob settled, I tink we better go 'bout again.\"\n\nA short time after this decision on the part of our hero, the day broke:\nJack first looked to leeward, and perceived the gun-boat and convoy\nstanding in for the shore about ten miles distant, followed by the\n_Harpy_, under all sail.  He could also perceive the captured gun-boat\nlying to in-shore to prevent their escape.\n\n\"_Harpy_ hab um all, by Gosh!\" cried Mesty; \"I ab notion dat she soon\nsettle um hash.\"\n\nThey were so busy looking at the _Harpy_ and the convoy, that, for some\ntime, they quite forgot to look to windward.  At last Mesty turned his\neyes that way.\n\n\"Dam um, I see right last night; look, Massa Easy--one chip, one brig\ntree lateen--dem for us.  By de power, but we make _bon_ prize\nto-night.\"\n\nThe vessels found out by Mesty were not above three miles to windward;\nthey were under all sail, beating up for the protection of a battery not\nfar distant.\n\n\"Now, Massa, suppose dey see our boat, dey tink something; keep boat\nalongside, and shift her when we go 'bout every time: better not sail so\nfast now--keep further off till they drop anchor for de night; and den,\nwhen it dark, we take 'em.\"\n\nAll Mesty's advice was good, with the exception perhaps of advising our\nhero how to disobey orders and take a cruise.  To prevent the vessel\nfrom approaching too near the others, and at the same time to let her\nhave the appearance of doing her best, a sail was towed overboard under\nthe bows, and after that they watched the motions of the _Harpy_.\n\nThe distance was too great to distinguish very clearly, but Mesty\nshinned up the mast of the vessel, and reported progress.\n\n\"By Jasus, dare one gun--two gun--go it, _Harpy_.  Won't she ab um, sure\nenough.  Now gun-boat fire--dat our gun-boat--no, dat not ours.  Now our\ngun-boat fire--dat pretty--fire away.  Ah, now de _Harpy_ cum up.  All\n'mung 'em.  Bung, bung, bung--rattle de grape, by gosh.  I ab notion de\nSpaniard is very pretty considerable trouble just now, anyhow.  All\nhove-to, so help me gosh--not more firing; _Harpy_ take um all--dare gun\nboat hove-to, she strike um colours.  By all powers, but suppose dey\ntink we no share prize-money--they find it not little mistake.  Now, my\nlads, it all over, and,\" continued Mesty, sliding down the mast, \"I tink\nyou better not show yourself too much; only two men stay on deck, and\ndem two take off um jackets.\"\n\nMesty's report was correct; the _Harpy_ had captured the other gun-boat,\nand the whole convoy.  The only drawback to their good fortune was the\ndisappearance of Mr Easy and the cutter: it was supposed that a shot\nfrom the gun-boat must have sunk her, and that the whole crew were\ndrowned.  Captain Wilson and Mr Sawbridge seriously regretted the loss\nof our hero, as they thought that he would have turned out a shining\ncharacter as soon as he had sown his wild oats; so did Mr Asper,\nbecause our hero's purse went with him; so did Jolliffe, because he had\ntaken an affection for him; so did little Gossett, because he\nanticipated no mercy from Vigors.  On the other hand, there were some\nwho were glad that he was gone; and as for the ship's company in\ngeneral, they lamented the loss of the poor cutter's crew for\ntwenty-four hours, which, in a man-of-war, is a very long while, and\nthen they thought no more about them.  We must leave the _Harpy_ to make\nthe best of her way to Toulon and now follow our hero.\n\nThe cutter's crew knew very well that Jack was acting contrary to\norders, but anything was to them a change from the monotony of a\nman-of-war; and they, as well as Mesty, highly approved of a holiday.\n\nIt was, however, necessary that they should soon proceed to business,\nfor they had but their allowance of bread and grog for one day, and in\nthe vessel they found nothing except a few heads of garlic, for the\nSpaniards coasting down shore had purchased their provisions as they\nrequired them.  There were only three prisoners on board, and they had\nbeen put down in the hold among the beans; a bag of which had been\nroused on deck, and a part put into the kettle to make soup.  Jack did\nnot much admire the fare of the first day--it was bean-soup for\nbreakfast, bean-soup for dinner, and if you felt hungry during the\nintervals it was still bean-soup, and nothing else.\n\nOne of the men could speak a little Lingua Franca, and the prisoners\nwere interrogated as to the vessels to windward.  The ship was stated to\nbe valuable, and also one of the brigs.  The ship carried guns, and that\nwas all that they knew about them.  As the sun went down the vessels\ndropped their anchors off the battery.  The breeze continued light, and\nthe vessel which contained Jack and his fortunes was about four miles to\nleeward.  As for the _Harpy_, they had long lost sight of her, and it\nwas now time to proceed to some arrangement.  As soon as it was dark\nJack turned his hands up and made a very long speech.  He pointed out to\nthe men that his zeal had induced him not to return to the ship until he\nhad brought something with him worth having--that they had had nothing\nbut beans to eat during the whole day, which was anything but agreeable,\nand that, therefore, it was absolutely necessary that they should better\ntheir condition; and there was a large ship not four miles off, and that\nhe intended to take her; and as soon as he had taken her he intended to\ntake some more; that he trusted to their zeal to support him on this\noccasion, and that he expected to do a great deal during the cruise.  He\npointed out to them that they must consider themselves as on board of a\nman-of-war, and be guided by the articles of war, which were written for\nthem all--and that in case they forgot them, he had a copy in his\npocket, which he would read to them to morrow morning, as soon as they\nwere comfortably settled on board of the ship.  He then appointed Mesty\nas first lieutenant; the marine as sergeant; the coxswain as boatswain;\ntwo men as midshipmen to keep watch: two others as boatswain's mates,\nleaving two more for the ship's company, who were divided into the\nlarboard and starboard watch.  The cutter's crew were perfectly content\nwith Jack's speech, and their brevet rank, and after that they commenced\na more important topic, which was, how they were to take the ship.\nAfter some discussion, Mesty's advice was approved of; which was, that\nthey should anchor not far ahead of the ship, and wait till about two\no'clock in the morning, when they would drop silently down upon her in\nthe cutter, and take possession.\n\nAbout nine o'clock the vessel was anchored as they proposed, and Jack\nwas a little astonished to find that the ship was much larger that he\nhad any idea of; for, although polacca-rigged, she was nearly the same\ntonnage as the _Harpy_.  The Spanish prisoners were first tied hand and\nfoot, and laid upon the beans, that they might give no alarm, the sails\nwere furled, and all was kept quiet.\n\nOn board of the ship, on the contrary, there was noise and revelry; and\nabout half-past ten a boat was seen to leave her and pull for the shore;\nafter which the noise gradually ceased, the lights one by one\ndisappeared, and then all was silent.\n\n\"What do you think, Mesty?\" said Jack; \"do you think we shall take her?\"\n\n\"It is take her, you mane; sure enough we'll take her, stop a bit--wait\ntill um all fast asleep.\"\n\nAbout twelve o'clock there came on a mizzling heavy rain, which was very\nfavourable for our hero's operations.  But as it promised soon to clear\nup, by Mesty's advice they did not delay any longer.  They crept softly\ninto the boat, and with two oars to steer her dropped under the bows of\nthe vessel, climbed up the forechains, and found the deck empty.  \"Take\ncare not fire pistol,\" said Mesty to the men as they came up, putting\nhis finger to their lips to impress them with the necessity of silence,\nfor Mesty had been an African warrior, and knew the advantage of\nsurprise.  All the men being on deck, and the boat made fast, Jack and\nMesty led the way aft; not a soul was to be seen: indeed, it was too\ndark to see anybody unless they were walking the deck.  The\ncompanion-hatch was secured, and the gratings laid on the after-hatch\nways, and then they went aft to the binnacle again, where there was a\nlight burning.  Mesty ordered two of the men to go forward to secure the\nhatches, and then to remain there on guard--and then the rest of the men\nand our hero consulted at the wheel.\n\n\"By the power we ab the ship!\" said Mesty, \"but must manage plenty yet.\nI tink der some damn lazy rascal sleep 'tween the guns.  A lilly while\nit no rain, and den we see better.  Now keep all quiet.\"\n\n\"There must be a great many men in this ship,\" replied our hero; \"she is\nvery large, and has twelve or fourteen guns--how shall we manage to\nsecure them?\"\n\n\"All right,\" replied Mesty, \"manage all dat by-and-bye.  Don't care how\nsoon daylight come.\"\n\n\"It has left off raining already,\" observed Easy; \"there is a candle in\nthe binnacle--suppose we light it and look round the decks.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Mesty, \"one man sentry over cabin hatch, and another over\nafter-hatch.  Now den we light candle, and all the rest go round the\ndeck.  Mind you leave all your pistols on capstern.\"\n\nJack lighted the candle, and they proceeded round the decks: they had\nnot walked far, when, between two of the guns, they discovered a heap\ncovered with gregos.  \"There de _watch_,\" whispered Mesty; \"all fast--\nnot ready for dem yet.\"\n\nMesty blew out the candle, and they all retreated to the binnacle, where\nMesty took out a coil of the ropes about the mizzen-mast, and cutting it\ninto lengths, gave them to the other men to unlay.  In a few minutes\nthey had prepared a great many seizings to tie the men with.\n\n\"Now den we light candle again, and make sure of them lazy hounds,\" said\nMesty; \"very much oblige to dem all de same; they let us take de ship--\nmind now, wake one at a time, and shut him mouth.\"\n\n\"But suppose they get their mouths free and cry out?\" replied Jack.\n\n\"Den, Mr Easy,\" replied Mesty, changing his countenance to an\nexpression almost demoniacal--\"there no help for it\"--and Mesty showed\nhis knife which he held in his right hand.\n\n\"Oh, no! do not let us murder them.\"\n\n\"No, massa--suppose can help it; but suppose they get upper hand--what\nbecome of us?  Spaniards hab knives, and use dem too, by de power!\"\n\nThe observation of Mesty was correct, and the expression of his\ncountenance when he showed his knife proved what a relentless enemy he\ncould be, if his blood was once roused--but Mesty had figured in the\nAshantee wars in former days, and after that the reader need not be\nsurprised.  They proceeded cautiously to where the Spaniards lay.  The\narrangements of Mesty were very good.  There were two men to gag them\nwhile the others were to tie their limbs.  Mesty and Easy were to kneel\nby them with the candle, with raised knives to awe them into silence, or\nto strike home, if their own safety required it.\n\nThe gregos were removed off the first man, who opened his eyes at the\nsight of the candle, but the coxswain's hand was on his mouth--he was\nsecured in silence.  The other two men were awaked, and threw off their\ncoverings, but they were also secured without there being occasion to\nresort to bloodshed.\n\n\"What shall we do now, Mesty?\"\n\n\"Now, sar,\" said Mesty, \"open the after-hatch and watch--suppose more\nmen come up, we make them fass; suppose no more come up, we wait till\ndaylight--and see what take place.\"\n\nMesty then went forward to see if the men were watchful on the\nforecastle; and having again gone round the whole of the deck to see if\nthere were any more men on it, he blew out the candle, and took his\nstation with the others at the after-hatchway.\n\nIt was just at break of day that the Spaniards who had to keep the\nmorning watch having woke up, as people generally do at that hour at\nwhich they expect to be called, dressed themselves and came on deck,\nimagining, and very truly, that those of the middle watch had fallen\nasleep, but little imagining that the deck was in possession of\nEnglishmen.  Mesty and the others retreated, to allow them all to come\nup before they could perceive them, and fortunately this was\naccomplished.  Four men came on the deck, looked round them, and tried\nto make out in the dark where their shipmates might be.  The grating was\nslapped on again by Jack, and before they could well gain their\neyesight, they were seized and secured, not, however, without a scuffle\nand some noise.\n\nBy the time that these men were secured and laid between the guns it was\ndaylight, and they now perceived what a fine vessel they had fairly\ntaken possession of--but there was much to be done yet.  There was, of\ncourse, a number of men in the ship, and, moreover, they were not a mile\nfrom a battery of ten guns.  Mesty, who was foremost in everything, left\nfour men abaft and went forward on the forecastle, examined the cable,\nwhich was _coir_ rope, and therefore easily divided, and then directed\nthe two men forward to coil a hawser upon the fore-grating, the weight\nof which would make all safe in that quarter, and afterwards to join\nthem on the quarter-deck.\n\n\"Now, Mr Easy, the great ting will be to get hold of captain; we must\nget him on deck.  Open cabin-hatch now, and keep the after-hatch fast.\nTwo men stay there, the others all come aft.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Jack, \"it will be a great point to secure the captain--\nbut how are we to get him up?\"\n\n\"You no know how to get captain up?  By de holy, I know very well.\"\n\nAnd Mesty took up the coils of rope about the mizzen-mast, and threw\nthem upon deck, one after another, making all the noise possible.  In a\nshort time there was a violent pull of a bell at the cabin door, and in\na minute afterwards a man in his shirt came up the cabin-hatchway, who\nwas immediately secured.\n\n\"Dis de captain's servant,\" said Mesty, \"he come say no make such damned\nnoise.  Stop a little--captain get in passion, and come up himself.\"\n\nAnd Mesty renewed the noise with the ropes over the cabin.  Mesty was\nright; in a few minutes the captain himself came up, boiling with\nindignation.  At the sound of the cabin door opening, the seamen and our\nhero concealed themselves behind the companion-hatch, which was very\nhigh, so as to give the captain time to get fairly on deck.  The men\nalready secured had been covered over with the gregos.  The captain was\na most powerful man, and it was with difficulty that he was pinioned,\nand then without his giving the alarm, had there been anyone to assist\nhim, but as yet no one had turned out of his hammock.\n\n\"Now we all right,\" said Mesty, \"and soon ab de ship; but I must make\nhim 'fraid.\"\n\nThe captain was seated down on the deck against one of the guns, and\nMesty, putting on the look of a demon, extended above him his long\nnervous arm, with the sharp knife clutched, as if ready every instant to\nstrike it into his heart.  The Spanish captain felt his situation\nanything but pleasant.  He was then interrogated as to the number of men\nin the ship, officers, etcetera, to all which questions he answered\ntruly: he cast his eyes at the firm and relentless countenance of Mesty,\nwho appeared but to wait the signal.\n\n\"I tink all pretty safe now,\" said Mesty.  \"Mr Easy, we now go down\nbelow and beat all men into the hold.\"\n\nOur hero approved of this suggestion.  Taking their pistols from the\ncapstern, they rushed down with their cutlasses, and leaving two men to\nguard the cabin door, they were soon among the crew, who were all naked\nin their hammocks: the resistance, although the numbers were more than\ndouble of the English, was of course trifling.  In a few minutes, the\nSpaniards were all thrown down into the hold of the vessel, and the\nhatches placed over them.  Every part of the ship was now in their\npossession except the cabin, and to that they all repaired.  Our hero\ntried the door, and found it fast; they beat it open, and were received\nwith loud screams from one side of the cabin, and the discharge of two\npistols from the other, fortunately without injury: those who had fired\nthe pistols were an elderly man and a lad about the age of our hero.\nThey were thrown down and secured; the cabin was searched, and nobody\nelse found in it but three women; one old and shrivelled, the other two,\nalthough with their countenances distorted with terror, were lovely as\nHouris.  So thought Jack, as he took off his hat, and made them a very\nlow bow with his usual politeness, as they crouched, half dressed, in a\ncorner.  He told them in English that they had nothing to fear, and\nbegged that they would attend to their toilets.  The ladies made no\nreply, because, in the first place, they did not know what Jack said,\nand in the next, they could not speak English.\n\nMesty interrupted Jack in his attentions, by pointing out that they must\nall go upon deck--so Jack again took off his hat and bowed, and then\nfollowed his men, who led away the two prisoners taken in the cabin.  It\nwas now five o'clock in the morning, and there was movement on board of\nthe other vessels, which lay not far from the ship.\n\n\"Now then,\" said Jack, \"what shall we do with the prisoners?--could we\nnot send the boat and bring our own vessel alongside, and put them all\nin, tied as they are?  We should then get rid of them.\"\n\n\"Massa Easy, you be one very fine officer one of dese days.  Dat damn\ngood idea, anyhow;--but suppose we send our own boat, what they _tink_\non board of de oder vessel?  Lower down lilly boat from stern, put in\nfour men, and drop vessel 'longside--dat it.\"\n\nThis was done; the cutter was on the seaward side of the ship, and, as\nthe ship was the outermost vessel, was concealed from the view of the\nSpaniards on board of the other vessels, and in the battery on shore.\nAs soon as the lateen vessel was alongside, the men who had already been\nsecured on deck, amounting to seven, were lowered into her, and laid\nupon the beans in the hold; all, except the captain, the two cabin\nprisoners, and the captain's servant.  They then went down below, took\noff one part of the hatches, and ordered the Spaniards up from the hold:\nas they came on deck they were made fast and treated in the same manner.\nMesty and the men went down to examine if there were any left\nconcealed, and finding that they were all out, returned on deck.  The\nmen who had been beaten down in the hold were twenty-two in number,\nmaking the whole complement of thirty.  As soon as they had all been put\ninto the xebeque, she was again hauled off and anchored outside, and\nJack found himself in possession of a fine ship of fourteen guns, with\nthree prisoners male and three prisoners female.\n\nWhen the men returned in the boat from the vessel in which the prisoners\nhad been confined (the hatches having been secured over them, by way of\nfurther precaution), by the advice of Mesty they put on the jackets and\ncaps of the Spanish seamen, of which there was a plentiful supply below.\n\n\"Now what's to be done, Mesty?\" inquired Jack.\n\n\"Now, sar, we send some of the men aloft to get sails all ready, and\nwhile they do that I cast loose this fellow,\" pointing to the captain's\nservant, \"and make him get some breakfast, for he know where to find\nit.\"\n\n\"Capital idea of yours, Mesty, for I'm tired of bean-soup already, and I\nwill go down and pay my respects to the ladies.\"\n\nMesty looked over the counter.\n\n\"Yes, and be quick too, Massa Easy; damn the women, they toss their\nhandkerchief in the air to people in the battery--quick, Massa Easy.\"\n\nMesty was right--the Spanish girls were waving their handkerchiefs for\nassistance; it was all that they could do, poor things.  Jack hastened\ninto the cabin, laid hold of the two young ladies, very politely pulled\nthem out of the quarter gallery, and begged that they would not give\nthemselves so much trouble.  The young ladies looked very much confused,\nand as they could no longer wave their handkerchiefs, they put them up\nto their eyes and began to weep, while the elderly lady went on her\nknees, and held her hands up for mercy.  Jack raised her up, and very\npolitely handed her to one of the cabin lockers.\n\nIn the meantime Mesty, with his gleaming knife and expressive look, had\ndone wonders with the captain's steward, for such the man was: and a\nbreakfast of chocolate, salt meat, hams and sausages, white biscuit and\nred wine, had been spread on the quarter-deck.  The men had come from\naloft, and Jack was summoned on deck.  Jack offered his hand to the two\nyoung ladies, and beckoned the old one to follow: the old lady did not\nthink it advisable to refuse his courtesy, so they accompanied him.\n\nAs soon as the females came on deck, and found the two cabin prisoners\nbound, they ran to them and embraced them with tears.  Jack's heart\nmelted, and as there was now no fear, he asked Mesty for his knife, and\ncut loose the two Spaniards, pointing to the breakfast, and requesting\nthat they would join them.  The Spaniards made a bow, and the ladies\nthanked Jack with a sweet smile; and the captain of the vessel, who\nstill lay pinioned against the gun, looked, as much as to say, Why the\ndevil don't you ask me? but the fact was, they had had such trouble to\nsecure him, that Jack did not much like the idea of letting him loose\nagain.  Jack and the seamen commenced their breakfast, and as the ladies\nand prisoners did not appear inclined to eat, they ate their share and\ntheir own too; during which the elderly man inquired of Jack if he could\nspeak French.\n\nJack, with his mouth full of sausage, replied that he could; and then\ncommenced a conversation, from which Jack learned as follows:--\n\nThe elderly gentleman was a passenger with the young man, who was his\nson, and the ladies, who were his wife and his two daughters, and they\nwere proceeding to Tarragona.  Whereupon Jack made a bow and thanked\nhim; and then the gentleman, whose name was Don Cordova de Rimarosa,\nwished to know what Jack intended to do with them, hoping, as a\ngentleman, he would put them on shore with their effects, as they were\nnon-combatants.  Jack explained all this to Mesty and the men, and then\nfinished his sausage.  The men, who were a little elevated with the wine\nwhich they had been drinking, proposed that they should take the ladies\na cruise, and Jack at first did not dislike the idea, but he said\nnothing; Mesty, however, opposed this, saying, that ladies only made a\nrow in a ship, and the coxswain sided with him, saying, that they should\nall be at daggers drawn.  Whereupon Jack pulled out the \"articles of\nwar,\" and informed the men, that there was no provision in them for\nwomen, and therefore the thing was impossible.\n\nThe next question was, as to the propriety of allowing them to take\ntheir effects; and it was agreed, at last, that they might take them.\nJack desired the steward to feed his master the captain, and then told\nthe Spanish Don the result of the consultation; further informing him,\nthat as soon as it was dark, he intended to put them all on board the\nsmall vessel, when they could cast loose the men and do as they pleased.\nThe Don and the ladies returned thanks, and went down to pack up their\nbaggage; Mesty ordering two men to help them, but with a caution, that\nthey were not to encumber themselves with any of the money, if there\nshould happen to be any on board.\n\nThe crew were busy during the day making preparations for sailing.  The\ncoxswain had examined the provender in the ship, and found that there\nwas enough for at least three months, of water, wine, and provisions,\nindependent of luxuries for the cabin.  All thoughts of taking any more\nof the vessels were abandoned, for their crew was but weak to manage the\none which they had possession of.  A fine breeze sprang up, and they\ndropped their fore-topsails, just as a boat was shoving off from the\nshore; but seeing the fore-topsails loosed, it put back again.  This was\nfortunate, or all would have been discovered.  The other vessels also\nloosed their sails, and the crews were heard weighing the anchors.\n\nBut the _Nostra Senora del Carmen_, which was Jack's prize, did not\nmove.  At last the sun went down, the baggage was placed in the cutter,\nthe ladies and passengers went into the boat, thanking Jack for his\nkindness, who put his hand to his heart and bowed to the deck; and the\ncaptain was lowered down after them.  Four men well armed pulled them\nalongside of the xebeque, put them and their trunks on deck, and\nreturned to the ship.  The cutter was then hoisted up, and as the anchor\nwas too heavy to weigh, they cut the cable, and made sail.  The other\nvessels followed their example.  Mesty and the seamen cast longing eyes\nupon them, but it was of no use; so they sailed in company for about an\nhour, and then Jack hauled his wind for a cruise.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\n\nIN WHICH OUR HERO FINDS THAT DISAGREEABLE OCCURRENCES WILL TAKE PLACE ON\nA CRUISE.\n\nAs soon as the ship had been hauled to the wind, Jack's ship's company\nseemed to think that there was nothing to do except to make merry, so\nthey brought some earthen jars full of wine, and emptied them so fast\nthat they were soon fast asleep on the deck, with the exception of the\nman at the helm, who, instead of thirty-two, could clearly make out\nsixty-four points in the compass, and of course was able to steer to a\nmuch greater nicety.  Fortunately, the weather was fine, for when the\nman at the helm had steered till he could see no more, and requested to\nbe released, he found that his shipmates were so overpowered with\nfatigue, that it was impossible to wake them.  He kicked them one by one\nmost unmercifully in the ribs, but it was of no use: under these\ncircumstances, he did as they did, that is, lay down with them, and in\nten minutes it would have taken as much kicking to awake him as he gave\nhis shipmates.\n\nIn the meantime the ship had it all her own way, and not knowing where\nshe was to go she went round and round the compass during the best part\nof the night.  Mesty had arranged the watches, Jack had made a speech,\nand the men had promised everything, but the wine had got into their\nheads, and memory had taken that opportunity to take a stroll.  Mesty\nhad been down with Jack, examining the cabin, and in the captain's\nstate-room they had found fourteen thousand dollars in bags: of this\nthey determined not to tell the men, but locked up the money and every\nthing else of value, and took out the key.  They then sat down at the\ncabin table, and after some conversation, it was no matter of surprise,\nafter having been up all the night before, that Jack laid his head on\nthe table and fell fast asleep.  Mesty kept his eyes open for some time,\nbut at last his head sank down upon his chest, and he also slumbered.\nThus, about one o'clock in the morning, there was not a very good watch\nkept on board of the _Nostra Senora del Carmen_.\n\nAbout four o'clock in the morning, Mesty tumbled forward, and he hit his\nhead against the table, which roused him up.\n\n\"By de mass, I tink I almost fall asleep,\" cried he, and he went to the\ncabin window, which had been left open, and found that there was a\nstrong breeze blowing in.  \"By de Lord, de wind ab come more aft,\" said\nMesty, \"why they not tell me?\"  So saying, he went on deck, where he\nfound no one at the helm; every one drunk, and the ship with her yards\nbraced up running before the wind, just by way of a change.  Mesty\ngrowled, but there was no time to lose; the topsails only were set--\nthese he lowered down, and then put the helm a-lee, and lashed it, while\nhe went down to call our hero to his assistance.  Jack roused up, and\nwent on deck.\n\n\"This nebber do, Massa Easy; we all go to devil together--dam drunken\ndogs--I freshen um up any how.\"  So Mesty drew some buckets of water,\nwith which he soused the ship's company, who then appeared to be\nrecovering their senses.\n\n\"By heavens!\" says Jack, \"but this is contrary to the `articles of war';\nI shall read them to them to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"I tell what better ting, Massa Easy; we go lock up all de wine, and\nsarve out so much, and no more.  I go do it at once, 'fore they wake\nup.\"\n\nMesty went down, leaving Jack on deck to his meditations.\n\n\"I am not sure,\" thought Jack, \"that I have done a very wise thing.\nHere I am with a parcel of fellows who have no respect for the articles\nof war, and who get as drunk as David's sow.  I have a large ship, but I\nhave very few hands; and if it comes on bad weather, what shall I do?--\nfor I know very little--hardly how to take in a sail.  Then--as for\nwhere to steer, or how to steer, I know not--nor do any of my men; but,\nhowever, as it was very narrow when we came into the Mediterranean,\nthrough the straits, it is hardly possible to get out of them without\nperceiving it: besides, I should know the rock of Gibraltar again, if I\nsaw it.  I must talk to Mesty.\"\n\nMesty soon returned with the keys of the provision-room tied to his\nbandana.\n\n\"Now,\" says he, \"they not get drunk again in a hurry.\"\n\nA few more buckets of water soon brought the men to their senses: they\nagain stood on their legs, and gradually recovered themselves.  Daylight\nbroke, and they found that the vessel had made an attempt for the\nSpanish coast, being within a mile of the beach, and facing a large\nbattery _fleur d'eau_; fortunately they had time to square the yards,\nand steer the ship along shore under the top-sails, before they were\nperceived.  Had they been seen at daylight in the position that they\nwere in during the night, the suspicions of the Spaniards would have\nbeen awakened; and had a boat been sent off, while they were all drunk,\nthey must have been recaptured.\n\nThe men, who perceived what danger they had been in, listened very\npenitently to Jack's remonstrances; and our hero, to impress them more\nstrongly on their minds, took out the articles of war, and read that on\ndrunkenness from beginning to end; but the men had heard it read so\noften at the gangway, that it did not make a due impression.  As Mesty\nsaid, his plan was better, and so it proved; for as soon as Jack had\ndone, the men went down to get another jug of wine, and found, to their\ndisappointment, that it was all under lock and key.\n\nIn the meantime, Jack called Mesty aft, and asked him if he knew the way\nto Toulon.  Mesty declared that he knew nothing about it.\n\n\"Then, Mesty, it appears to me that we have a better chance of finding\nour way back to Gibraltar; for you know the land was on our left side\nall the way coming up the Mediterranean; and if we keep it, as it is\nnow, on our right, we shall get back again along the coast.\"\n\nMesty agreed with Jack that this was the _ne plus ultra_ of navigation:\nand that old Smallsole could not do better with his \"pig-yoke\" and\ncompasses.  So they shook a reef out of the top-sails, set\ntop-gallant-sails, and ran directly down the coast from point to point,\nkeeping about five miles distant.  The men prepared a good dinner; Mesty\ngave them their allowance of wine, which was just double what they had\non board the _Harpy_--so they soon appeared to be content.  One man,\nindeed, talked very big and very mutinously, swearing that if the others\nwould join him, they would soon have liquor enough, but Mesty gave him\nhis look, opened his knife, and swore that he would settle him, and Jack\nknocked him down with a handspike; so that, what with the punishment\nreceived, and that which was promised, the fellow thought he might as\nwell say no more about it.  The fact is, that had it not been from fear\nof Mesty, the whole of the men would, in all probability, have behaved\nequally as bad; nevertheless, they were a little staggered, it must be\nowned, at seeing Jack play so good a stick with the handspike.\n\nAfter this night Jack and Mesty kept watch and watch, and everything\nwent on very well until they were nearly abreast of Carthagena, when a\ngale came on from the northward, and drove them out of sight of land.\nSail after sail was reduced with difficulty from their having so few\nhands, and the gale blew for three days with great fury.  The men were\ntired out and discontented.  It was Jack's misfortune that he had but\none good man with him: even the coxswain of the boat, although a\nfine-looking man, was worth nothing.  Mesty was Jack's sheet-anchor.\nThe fourth day the gale moderated, but they had no idea where they were:\nthey knew that they had been blown off, but how far they could not tell;\nand Jack now began to discover that a cruise at sea without a knowledge\nof navigation was a more nervous thing than he had contemplated.\nHowever, there was no help for it: at night they wore the ship, and\nstood on the other tack, and at daylight they perceived that they were\nclose to some small islands, and much closer to some large rocks,\nagainst which the sea beat high, although the wind had subsided.  Again\nwas the helm put up, and they narrowly escaped.  As soon as the sails\nwere trimmed, the men came aft, and proposed that if they could find\nanchorage, they should run into it, for they were quite tired out.  This\nwas true; and Jack consulted with Mesty, who thought it advisable to\nagree to the proposal.  That the islands were not inhabited was very\nevident.  The only point to ascertain was if there were good anchorage.\nThe coxswain offered to go in the boat and examine; and, with four men,\nhe set off, and in about an hour returned, stating that there was plenty\nof water, and that it was as smooth as a mill-pond, being land-locked on\nevery side.  As they could not weigh the bower-anchor, they bent the\nkedge, and, running in without accident, came to in a small bay, between\nthe islands, in seven fathoms water.  The sails were furled, and\neverything put in order by the seamen, who then took the boat and pulled\non shore.  \"They might as well have asked leave,\" thought Jack.  In an\nhour they returned, and, after a short discussion, came aft to our hero\nin a body.\n\nThe coxswain was spokesman.  He said that they had had hard work, and\nrequired now to have some rest,--that there were provisions on board for\nthree months, so that there could not be any hurry,--and that they had\nfound they could pitch a tent very well on shore, and live there for a\nshort time,--and that as there was no harm in getting drunk on shore,\nthey expected that they might be allowed to take provisions and plenty\nof wine with them; and that the men had desired him to ask leave,\nbecause they were determined to go, whether or no.  Jack was about to\nanswer with the handspike; but perceiving that the men had all put on\ntheir cutlasses, and had their pistols at their belts, he thought proper\nto consult Mesty, who, perceiving that resistance was useless, advised\nJack to submit, observing, that the sooner all the wine was gone the\nbetter, as there would be nothing done while it lasted.  Jack,\ntherefore, very graciously told them, that they should have their own\nway, and he would stay there as long as they pleased.  Mesty gave them\nthe keys of the provision-hatch, and told them, with a grin, to help\nthemselves.  The men then informed Jack that he and Mesty should stay on\nboard, and take care of the ship for them, and that they would take the\nSpaniard on shore to cook their victuals; but to this Jack observed,\nthat if he had not two hands, he could not obey their orders, in case\nthey wished him to come on shore for them.  The men thought there was\ngood argument in that observation, and therefore allowed Jack to retain\nthe Spaniard, that he might be more prompt to their call from the beach:\nthey then wished him good day, and begged that he would amuse himself\nwith the \"articles of war.\"\n\nAs soon as they had thrown a spare sail into the boat, with some spars\nto make a tent, and some bedding, they went down below, hoisted up two\npipes of wine out of the three, a bag or two of biscuit, arms and\nammunition, and as much of the salt provisions as they thought they\nmight require.  The boat being full, they shoved off, with three cheers\nof derision.  Jack was sensible to the compliment: he stood at the\ngangway, took off his hat, and made them a polite bow.\n\nAs soon as they were gone, Mesty grinned with his sharp-filed teeth, and\nlooking at our hero, said:\n\n\"I tink I make um pay for all dis--stop a little; by de piper as played\nbefore Moses, but our turn come by-and-by.\"\n\nAs for Jack, he said nothing, but he thought the more.  In about an hour\nthe men returned in the boat: they had forgotten many things they\nwanted--wood to make a fire, and several utensils; they helped\nthemselves freely, and having now everything that they could think of,\nthey again went on shore.\n\n\"How damn lucky we never tell dem about the dollars,\" said Mesty, as\nJack and he were watching the motions of the men.\n\n\"It is, indeed,\" replied Jack, \"not that they could spend them here.\"\n\n\"No, Massa Easy, but suppose they find all that money, they take boat\nand go away with it.  Now, I hab them in my clutch--stop a little.\"\n\nA narrow piece of salt pork had been left at the gangway: Jack, without\nknowing why, tossed it over board; being almost all fat it sank very\ngradually: Jack watched it as it disappeared, so did Mesty, both full of\nthought, when they perceived a dark object rising under it: it was a\nground shark, who took it into his maw, sank down, and disappeared.\n\n\"What was that?\" said Jack.\n\n\"That ground shark, Massa Easy,--worst shark of all; you neber see him\ntill you feel him;\" and Mesty's eyes sparkled with pleasure.  \"By de\npowers, they soon stop de mutiny; now I hab 'em.\"\n\nJack shuddered and walked away.\n\nDuring the day, the men on shore were seen to work hard, and make all\nthe preparations before they abandoned themselves to the sensual\ngratification of intemperance.  The tent was pitched, the fire was\nlighted, and all the articles taken on shore rolled up and stowed away\nin their places; they were seen to sit down and dine, for they were\nwithin hail of the ship, and then one of the casks of wine was spiled.\nIn the meantime the Spaniard, who was a quiet lad, had prepared the\ndinner for Easy and his now only companion.  The evening closed, and all\nwas noise and revelry on shore; and as they danced, and sung, and tossed\noff the cans of wine by the light of the fire, as they hallooed and\nscreamed, and became more and more intoxicated, Mesty turned to Jack\nwith his bitter smile, and only said:\n\n\"Stop a little.\"\n\nAt last the noise grew fainter, the fire died away, and gradually all\nwas silent.  Jack was still hanging over the gangway when Mesty came up\nto him.  The new moon had just risen, and Jack's eyes were fixed upon\nit.\n\n\"Now, Massa Easy, please you come aft and lower down little boat; take\nyour pistols and then we go on shore and bring off the cutter; they all\nasleep now.\"\n\n\"But why should we leave them without a boat, Mesty?\" for Jack thought\nof the sharks, and the probability of the men attempting to swim off.\n\n\"I tell you, sar, this night they get drunk, to morrow they get drunk\nagain, but drunken men never keep quiet--suppose one man say to others,\n`Let's go aboard and kill officer, and then we do as we please,' they\nall say yes, and they all come and do it.  No, sar--must have boat--if\nnot for your sake, I must hab it, save my own life anyhow, for they hate\nme and kill me first;--by de powers, stop a little.\"\n\nJack felt the truth of Mesty's observation; he went aft with him,\nlowered down the small boat, and they hauled it alongside.  Jack went\ndown with Mesty into the cabin and fetched his pistols--\"And the\nSpaniard, Mesty, can we leave him on board alone?\"\n\n\"Yes, sar, he no got arms, and he see dat we have--but suppose he find\narms he never dare do any thing--I know de man.\"\n\nOur hero and Mesty went down into the boat and shoved off, pulling\ngently on shore; the men were in a state of intoxication, so as not to\nbe able to move, much less hear.  They cast off the cutter, towed her on\nboard, and made her fast with the other boat astern.\n\n\"Now, sar, we may go to bed; to-morrow morning you will see.\"\n\n\"They have everything they require on shore,\" replied Easy; \"all they\ncould want with the cutter would be to molest us.\"\n\n\"Stop a little,\" replied Mesty.\n\nJack and Mesty went to bed, and as a precaution against the Spaniard,\nwhich was hardly necessary, Mesty locked the cabin door--but Mesty never\nforgot anything.\n\nJack slept little that night--had melancholy forebodings which he could\nnot shake off; indeed, Jack had reflected so much since he had left the\nship, he had had his eyes so much opened, and had felt what a\nresponsibility he had taken by indulging himself in a whim of the\nmoment, that it might be almost said that in the course of one fortnight\nhe had at once from a boy sprung up into a man.  He was mortified and\nangry, but he was chiefly so with himself.\n\nMesty was up at daylight and Jack soon followed him: they watched the\nparty on shore, who had not yet left the tent.  At last, just as Jack\nhad finished his breakfast, one or two made their appearance: the men\nlooked about them as if they were searching for something, and then\nwalked down to the beach, to where the boat had been made fast.  Jack\nlooked at Mesty, who grinned, and answered with the words so often\nrepeated:\n\n\"Stop a little.\"\n\nThe men then walked along the rocks until they were abreast of the ship.\n\n\"Ship ahoy!\"\n\n\"Halloo,\" replied Mesty.\n\n\"Bring the boat ashore directly, with a breaker of water.\"\n\n\"I knew dat,\" cried Mesty, rubbing his hands with delight.  \"Massy Easy,\nyou must tell them No.\"\n\n\"But why should I not give them water, Mesty?\"\n\n\"Because, sar, den they take boat.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" replied Easy.\n\n\"Do you hear on board?\" cried the coxswain, who was the man who\nhailed--\"send the boat immediately, or we'll cut the throats of every\nmother's son of you, by God!\"\n\n\"I shall not send the boat,\" replied Jack, who now thought Mesty was\nright.\n\n\"You won't--won't you?--then your doom's sealed,\" replied the man,\nwalking up to the tent with the other.  In a short time all the seamen\nturned out of the tent, bringing with them four muskets, which they had\ntaken on shore with them.\n\n\"Good heavens! they are not, surely, going to fire at us, Mesty.\"\n\n\"Stop a little.\"\n\nThe men then came down abreast of the ship, and the coxswain again\nhailed, and asked if they would bring the boat on shore.\n\n\"You must say No, sar,\" replied Mesty.\n\n\"I feel I must,\" replied Jack, and then he answered the coxswain, \"No.\"\n\nThe plan of the mutineers had been foreseen by the wily negro--it was to\nswim off to the boats which were riding astern, and to fire at him or\nJack, if they attempted to haul them up alongside and defend them.  To\nget into the boats, especially the smaller one, from out of the water,\nwas easy enough.  Some of the men examined their priming and held the\nmuskets at their hips all ready, with the muzzles towards the ship,\nwhile the coxswain and two men were throwing off their clothes.\n\n\"Stop, for God's sake, stop!\" cried Jack \"The harbour is full of ground\nsharks--it is, upon my soul!\"\n\n\"Do you think to frighten us with ground sharks?\" replied the coxswain,\n\"keep under cover, my lad; Jack, give him a shot to prove we are in\nearnest, and every time he or that nigger show their heads, give them\nanother, my lads.\"\n\n\"For God's sake, don't attempt to swim,\" said Jack, in an agony; \"I will\ntry some means to give you water.\"\n\n\"Too late now--you're doomed;\" and the coxswain sprang off the rock into\nthe sea, and was followed by two other men: at the same moment a musket\nwas discharged, and the bullet whistled close to our hero's ear.\n\nMesty dragged Jack from the gangway, who was now nearly fainting from\nagonising feelings.  He sank on the deck for a moment, and then sprang\nup and ran to the port to look at the men in the water.  He was just in\ntime to see the coxswain raise himself with a loud yell out of the sea,\nand then disappear in a vortex, which was crimsoned with his blood.\n\nMesty threw down his musket in his hand, of which he had several all\nready loaded, in case the men should have gained the boats.\n\n\"By the powers, dat no use now!\"\n\nJack had covered his face with his hands.  But the tragedy was now\ncomplete: the other men, who were in the water, had immediately turned\nand made for the shore; but before they could reach it, two more of\nthose voracious monsters, attracted by the blood of the coxswain, had\nflown to the spot, and there was a contention for the fragments of their\nbodies.\n\nMesty, who had seen this catastrophe, turned towards our hero, who still\nhid his face.\n\n\"I'm glad he no see dat, anyhow,\" muttered Mesty.\n\n\"See what?\" exclaimed Jack.\n\n\"Shark eat 'em all.\"\n\n\"Oh, horrid, horrid!\" groaned our hero.\n\n\"Yes, sar, very horrid,\" replied Mesty, \"and dat bullet at your head\nvery horrid.  Suppose the sharks no take them, what then?  They kill us,\nand the sharks have our body.  I think that more horrid still.\"\n\n\"Mesty,\" replied Jack, seizing the negro convulsively by the arm, \"it\nwas not the sharks--it was I--I who have murdered these men.\"\n\nMesty looked at Jack with surprise.\n\n\"How dat possible?\"\n\n\"If I had not disobeyed orders,\" replied our hero, panting for breath,\n\"if I had not shown them the example of disobedience, this would not\nhave happened.  How could I expect submission from them?  It's all my\nfault--I see it now--and, O God! when will the sight be blotted from my\nmemory?\"\n\n\"Massa Easy, I not understand that,\" replied Mesty: \"I think you talk\nfoolish--might as well say, suppose Ashantee men not make war, this not\nhappen; for suppose Ashantee not make war, I not slave--I not run away--\nI not come board _Harpy_--I not go in boat with you--I not hinder men\nfrom getting drunk--and that why they make mutiny--and the mutiny why\nthe shark take um?\"\n\nJack made no reply, but he felt some consolation from the\ncounter-argument of the negro.\n\nThe dreadful death of the three mutineers appeared to have had a\nsensible effect upon their companions, who walked away from the beach\nwith their heads down and with measured steps.  They were now seen to be\nperambulating the island, probably in search of that water which they\nrequired.  At noon, they returned to their tent, and soon afterwards\nwere in a state of intoxication, hallooing and shouting as the day\nbefore.  Towards the evening they came down to the beach abreast of the\nship, each with a vessel in their hands, and perceiving that they had\nattracted the notice of our hero and Mesty, tossed the contents of the\nvessels up in the air to show that they had found water, and hooting and\nderiding, went back, dancing, leaping, and kicking up their heels, to\nrenew their orgies, which continued till after mid night, when they were\nall stupified as before.\n\nThe next day Jack had recovered from the first shock which the\ncatastrophe had given him, and he called Mesty into the cabin to hold a\nconsultation.\n\n\"Mesty, how is this to end?\"\n\n\"How do you mean, sar?--end here, or end on board of de _Harpy_?\"\n\n\"The _Harpy_!--there appears little chance of our seeing her again--we\nare on a desolate island, or what is the same thing; but we will hope\nthat it will be so: but how is this mutiny to end?\"\n\n\"Massa Easy, suppose I please I make it end very soon, but I not in a\nhurry.\"\n\n\"How do you mean, Mesty, not in a hurry?\"\n\n\"Look, Massa Easy, you wish take a cruise, and I wish the same ting: now\nbecause mutiny you want to go back--but, by all de powers, you tink that\nI, a prince in my own country, feel wish to go back and boil kettle for\nde young gentlemen.  No, Massa Easy, gib me mutiny--gib me anyting--\nbut--once I was prince,\" replied Mesty, lowering his voice at the last\nfew emphatic words.\n\n\"You must one of these days tell me your history, Mesty,\" replied Jack;\n\"but just now let us argue the point in question.  How could you put an\nend to this mutiny?\"\n\n\"By putting an end to all wine.  Suppose I go shore after they all\ndrunk, I spile the casks in three or four places, and in the morning all\nwine gone--den dey ab get sober, and beg pardon--we take dem on board,\nput away all arms 'cept yours and mine, and I like to see the mutiny\nafter dat.  Blood and 'ounds--but I settle um, anyhow.\"\n\n\"The idea is very good, Mesty--why should we not do so?\"\n\n\"Because I not like run de risk to go ashore--all for what? to go back,\nboil de kettle for all gentlemans--I very happy here, Massa,\" replied\nMesty carelessly.\n\n\"And I am very miserable,\" replied Jack; \"but, however, I am completely\nin your power, Mesty, and I must, I suppose, submit.\"\n\n\"What you say, Massa Easy--submit to me?--no, sar, when you are on board\n_Harpy_ as officer, you talk with me as a friend, and not treat me as\nnegro servant.  Massa Easy, I feel--I feel what I am,\" continued Mesty,\nstriking his bosom, \"I feel it here--for all first time since I leave my\ncountry, I feel dat I am someting; but, Massa Easy, I love my friend as\nmuch as I hate my enemy--and you neber submit to me--I too proud to\nallow dat, 'cause, Massa Easy--I am a man--and once I was a prince.\"\n\nAlthough Mesty did not perhaps explain by words half so well as he did\nby his countenance, the full tide of feeling which was overflowing in\nhis heart, Jack fully understood and felt it.  He extended his hand to\nMesty, and said:\n\n\"Mesty--that you have been a prince, I care little about, although I\ndoubt it not, because you are incapable of a lie; but you are a man, and\nI respect you, nay, I love you as a friend--and with my will we never\npart again.\"\n\nMesty took the hand offered by Jack.  It was the first peace-offering\never extended to him, since, he had been torn away from his native\nland--the first compliment, the first tribute, the first acknowledgment,\nperhaps, that he was not an inferior being; he pressed it in silence,\nfor he could not speak; but could the feelings which were suffocating\nthe negro but have been laid before sceptics, they must have\nacknowledged that at that moment they were all and only such as could do\nhonour, not only to the prince, but even to the Christian.  So much was\nMesty affected with what had happened, that when he dropped the hand of\nour hero, he went down into the cabin, finding it impossible to continue\nthe conversation, which was not renewed until the next morning.\n\n\"What is your opinion, Mesty?--tell me, and I will be governed by it.\"\n\n\"Den, sar, I tell you I tink it right that they first come and ask to\ncome on board before you take them--and, sar, I tink it also right, as\nwe are but two and they are five, dat they first eat all their\nprovision--let 'em starve plenty, and den dey come on board tame\nenough.\"\n\n\"At all events,\" replied Jack, \"the first overtures of some kind or\nanother must come from them.  I wish I had something to do--I do not\nmuch like this cooping up on board ship.\"\n\n\"Massa, why you no talk with Pedro?\"\n\n\"Because I cannot speak Spanish.\"\n\n\"I know dat, and dat why I ask de question.  You very sorry when you\nmeet the two pretty women in the ship, you not able to talk with them--I\nguess that.\"\n\n\"I was very sorry, I grant,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"Well, Massa Easy, by-and-by we see more Spanish girl.  Why not talk all\nday with Pedro, and den you able to talk with dem.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, Mesty, I never had an idea of your value.  I will learn\nall the Spanish that I can,\" replied Jack, who was glad to have\nemployment found for him, and was quite disgusted with the articles of\nwar.\n\nAs for the men on shore, they continued the same course, if not as\nbefore, one day succeeded another, and without variety.  It was,\nhowever, to be observed, that the fire was now seldomer lighted, which\nproved their fuel scarce, and the weather was not so warm as it had\nbeen, for it was now October.  Jack learnt Spanish from Pedro for a\nmonth, during which there was no appearance of submission on the part of\nthe mutineers, who, for the first fortnight, when intoxicated, used to\ncome down and fire at Jack or Mesty, when they made their appearance.\nFortunately drunken men are not good marksmen, but latterly this had\nbeen discontinued, because they had expended their ammunition--and they\nappeared to have almost forgotten that the ship was there, for they took\nno notice of her whatever.\n\nOn the other hand, Jack had decided that if he waited there a year, the\novertures should come from them who had mutinied; and now, having an\noccupation, he passed his time very quietly, and the days flew so fast\nthat two months had actually been run off the calendar, before he had an\nidea of it.\n\nOne evening, as they were down in the cabin, for the evenings had now\nbecome very cold, Jack asked Mesty whether he had any objection to give\nhim a history of his life.  Mesty replied, that if he wished he was\nready to talk; and at a nod from our hero, Mesty commenced as follows.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\n\nIN WHICH MUTINY, LIKE FIRE, IS QUENCHED FOR WANT OF FUEL AND NO WANT OF\nWATER.\n\nAlthough we have made the African negro hitherto talk in his own mixed\njargon, yet, as we consider that, in a long narration, it will be\ntedious to the reader, we shall now translate the narrative part into\ngood English, merely leaving the conversation with which it may be\nbroken in its peculiar dialect.\n\n\"The first thing I recollect,\" said Mesty, \"is that I was carried on the\nshoulders of a man with my legs hanging down before, and holding on by\nhis head.\n\n\"Every one used to look at me, and get out of the way, as I rode through\nthe town and market place, so loaded with heavy gold ornaments that I\ncould not bear them, and was glad when the women took them off: but, as\nI grew older I became proud of them, because I knew that I was the son\nof a king--I lived happy, I did nothing but shoot my arrows, and I had a\nlittle sword which I was taught to handle, and the great captains who\nwere about my father showed me how to kill my enemies.  Some times I lay\nunder the shady trees, sometimes I was with the women belonging to my\nfather, sometimes I was with him and played with the skulls, and\nrepeated the names of those to whom they had belonged, for in our\ncountry, when we kill our enemies, we keep their skulls as trophies.\n\n\"As I grew older, I did as I pleased; I beat the women and the slaves; I\nthink I killed some of the latter--I know I did one, to try whether I\ncould strike well with my two-handed sword made of hard and heavy wood--\nbut that is nothing in our country.  I longed to be a great captain, and\nI thought of nothing else but war and fighting, and how many skulls I\nshould have in my possession when I had a house and wives of my own, and\nI was no longer a boy.  I went out in the woods to hunt, and I stayed\nfor weeks.  And one day I saw a panther basking in the sun, waving his\ngraceful tail.  I crept up softly till I was behind a rock within three\nyards of it, and drawing my arrow to the head I pierced him through the\nbody.  The animal bounded up in the air, saw me, roared and made a\nspring, but I dropped behind the rock, and he passed over me.  He turned\nagain to me, but I had my knife ready, and, as he fixed his talons into\nmy shoulder and breast, I pierced him to the heart.  This was the\nhappiest day of my life; I had killed a panther without assistance, and\nI had wounds to show.  Although I was severely hurt, I thought nothing\nof it.  I took off the skin as my blood dropped down and mixed with that\nof the beast--but I rejoiced in it.  Proudly did I go into the town\ndripping with gore and smarting with pain.  Every one extolled the feat,\ncalled me a hero and a great captain.  I filed my teeth, and I became a\nman.\n\n\"From that day I ranked among the warriors, and, as soon as my wounds\nwere healed, I went out to battle.  In three fights I had gained five\nskulls, and when I returned they weighed me out gold.  I then had a\nhouse and wives, and my father appointed me a Caboceer.  I wore the\nplume of eagle and ostrich feathers, my dress was covered with fetishes,\nI pulled on the boots with bells, and with my bow and arrows slung on my\nback, my spear and blunderbuss, my knives and my double-handed sword, I\nled the men to battle and brought back skulls and slaves.  Every one\ntrembled at my name, and, if my father threatened to send me out,\ngold-dust covered the floor of his hall of council--Now, I boil the\nkettle for the young gentlemen.\n\n\"There was one man I liked.  He was not a warrior, or I should have\nhated him, but he was brought up with me in my father's house, and was a\nnear relative.  I was grave and full of pride, he was gay and fond of\nmusic; and although there was no music to me equal to the tom-tom, yet I\ndid not always wish for excitement.  I often was melancholy, and then I\nliked to lay my head in the lap of one of my wives, under the shady\nforest behind my house, and listen to his soft music.  At last he went\nto a town near us where his father lived, and as he departed I gave him\ngold-dust.  He had been sent to my father to be formed into a warrior,\nbut he had no strength of body, and he had no soul; still I loved him\nbecause he was not like myself.  There was a girl in the town who was\nbeautiful; many asked for her as their wife, but her father had long\npromised her to my friend; he refused even the greatest warrior of the\nplace, who went away in wrath to the fetish-man, and throwing him his\ngold armlets asked for a fetish against his rival.  It was given, and\ntwo days before he was to be married my friend died.  His mother came to\nme, and it was enough.  I put on my war dress, I seized my weapons, sat\nfor a whole day with my skulls before me, working up my revenge, called\nout my men, and that night set off for the town where the warrior\nresided, killed two of his relatives and carried off ten of his slaves.\nWhen he heard what I had done, he trembled and sent gold; but I knew\nthat he had taken the girl home as his wife, and I would not listen to\nthe old man who sought to pacify me.  Again I collected a larger force,\nand attacked him in the night: we fought, for he was prepared with his\nmen, but after a struggle he was beaten back.  I fired his house, wasted\nhis provision ground, and taking away more slaves, I returned home with\nmy men, intending soon to assault him again.  The next day there came\nmore messengers, who knelt in vain, so they went to my father, and many\nwarriors begged him to interfere.  My father sent for me, but I would\nnot listen; the warriors spoke, and I turned my back: my father was\nwroth and threatened, the warriors brandished their two-handed swords--\nthey dared to do it; I looked over my shoulder with contempt, and I\nreturned to my house.  I took down my skulls, and I planned.  It was\nevening, and I was alone, when a woman covered up to the eyes\napproached; she fell down before me as she exposed her face.\n\n\"`I am the girl who was promised to your relation, and I am now the wife\nof your enemy.  I shall be a mother.  I could not love your relation,\nfor he was no warrior.  It is not true that my husband asked for a\nfetish--it was I who bought it, for I would not wed him.  Kill me and be\nsatisfied.'\n\n\"She was very beautiful, and I wondered not that my enemy loved her--and\nshe was with child--it was his child, and she had fetished my friend to\ndeath.  I raised my sword to strike, and she did not shrink: it saved\nher life.  `Thou art fit to be the mother of warriors,' said I, as I\ndropped my sword, `and thou shalt be my wife, but first his child shall\nbe born, and I will have thy husband's skull.'\n\n\"`No, no,' replied she, `I will be the mother of no warriors but my\npresent husband, whom I love; if you keep me as your slave I will die.'\n\n\"I told her she said foolish things, and sent her to the women's\napartment, with orders to be watched--but she hardly had been locked up\nbefore she drew her knife, plunged it into her heart, and died.\n\n\"When the king my father heard this he sent me a message--`Be satisfied\nwith the blood that has been shed, it is enough'--but I turned away, for\nI wished for mine enemy's skull.  That night I attacked him again, and\nmet him hand to hand; I killed him, and carried home his skull, and I\nwas appeased.\n\n\"But all the great warriors were wroth, and my father could not restrain\nthem.  They called out their men, and I called out my men, and I had a\nlarge body, for my name was terrible.  But the force raised against me\nwas twice that of mine, and I retreated to the bush--after a while we\nmet and fought and I killed many, but my men were too few and were\noverpowered--the fetish had been sent out against me, and their hearts\nmelted; at last I sank down with my wounds, for I bled at every pore,\nand I told my men who were about me to take off my feathers, and my\ndress and boots, that my enemies might not have my skull: they did so,\nand I crawled into the bush to die.  But I was not to die; I was\nrecovering, when I was discovered by those who steal men to sell them: I\nwas bound, and fastened to a chain with many more.  I, a prince and a\nwarrior, who could show the white skulls of his enemies--I offered to\nprocure gold, but they derided me; they dragged me down to the coast,\nand sold me to the Whites.  Little did I think, in my pride, that I\nshould be a slave.  I knew that I was to die, and hoped to die in\nbattle: my skull would have been more prized than all the gold in the\nearth, and my skin would have been stuffed and hung up in a\nfetish-house--instead of which, I now boil the kettle for the young\ngentlemen.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Jack, \"that's better than being killed and stuffed.\"\n\n\"Mayhap it is,\" replied Mesty, \"I tink very different now dan I tink\nden--but still, its women's work and not suit me.\n\n\"They put me with others into a cave until the ship came, and then we\nwere sent on board, put in irons, and down in the hold, where you could\nnot sit upright--I wanted to die, but could not: others died every day,\nbut I lived--I was landed in America, all bone, and I fetched very\nlittle money--they laughed at me as they bid their dollars: at last a\nman took me away, and I was on a plantation with hundreds more, but too\nill to work, and not intending to work.  The other slaves asked me if I\nwas a fetish-man; I said yes, and I would fetish any man that I did not\nlike: one man laughed, and I held up my finger; I was too weak to get\nup, for my blood had long boiled with fever, and I said to him, `_you\nshall die_;' for I meant to have killed him, as soon as I was well.  He\nwent away, and in three days he was dead.  I don't know how, but all the\nslaves feared me, and my master feared me, for he had seen the man die,\nand he, although he was a white man, believed in fetish, and he wished\nto sell me again, but no one would buy a fetish-man, so he made friends\nwith me; for I told him, if I was beat he should die, and he believed\nme.  He took me into his house, and I was his chief man, and I would not\nlet the other slaves steal, and he was content.  He took me with him to\nNew York, and there after two years, when I had learned English, I ran\naway, and got on board of an English ship--and they told me to cook.  I\nleft the ship as soon as I came to England, and offered myself to\nanother, and they said they did not want a cook; and I went to another,\nand they asked me if I was a good cook: everybody seemed to think that a\nblack man must be a cook, and nothing else.  At last I starve, and I go\non board man-of-war, and here I am, after having been a warrior and a\nprince, cook, steward and everyting else, boiling kettle for de young\ngentlemen.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Jack, \"at all events that is better than being a slave.\"\n\nMesty made no reply: any one who knows the life of a midshipman's\nservant will not be surprised at his silence.\n\n\"Now, tell me, do you think you were right in being so revengeful, when\nyou were in your own country?\" inquired Jack.\n\n\"I tink so den, Massa Easy, sometimes when my blood boil, I tink so\nnow--oder time, I no know what to tink--but when a man love very much,\nhe hate very much.\"\n\n\"But you are now a Christian, Mesty.\"\n\n\"I hear all that your people say,\" replied the negro, \"and it make me\ntink--I no longer believe in fetish, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Our religion tells us to love our enemies.\"\n\n\"Yes, I heard parson say dat--but den what we do with our friends, Massy\nEasy?\"\n\n\"Love them too.\"\n\n\"I no understand dat, Massa Easy--I love you, because you good, and\ntreat me well--Mr Vigors, he bully, and treat me ill--how possible to\nlove him?  By de power, I hate him, and wish I had him _skull_.  You\ntink little Massa Gossett love him?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Jack, laughing, \"I'm afraid that he would like to have his\nskull as well as you, Mesty--but at all events we must try and forgive\nthose who injure us.\"\n\n\"Then, Massa Easy, I tink so too--too much revenge very bad--it very\neasy to hate, but not very easy to forgive--so I tink that if a man\nforgive he hab _more soul_ in him, he more of a _man_.\"\n\n\"After all,\" thought Jack, \"Mesty is about as good a Christian as most\npeople.\"\n\n\"What that?\" cried Mesty, looking out of the cabin window--\"Ah! damn\ndrunken dogs--they set fire to tent.\"\n\nJack looked, and perceived that the tent on shore was in flames.\n\n\"I tink these cold nights cool their courage any how,\" observed\nMesty--\"Massa Easy, you see they soon ask permission to come on board.\"\n\nJack thought so too, and was most anxious to be off, for, on looking\ninto the lockers in the state-room, he had found a chart of the\nMediterranean, which he had studied very attentively--he had found out\nthe rock of Gibraltar, and had traced the _Harpy's_ course up to Cape de\nGatte, and thence to Tarragona--and, after a while, had summoned Mesty\nto a cabinet council.\n\n\"See, Mesty,\" said Jack, \"I begin to make it out; here is Gibraltar, and\nCape de Gatte, and Tarragona--it was hereabout we were when we took the\nship, and, if you recollect, we had passed Cape de Gatte two days before\nwe were blown off from the land, so that we had gone about twelve\ninches, and had only four more to go.\"\n\n\"Yes, Massa Easy, I see all dat.\"\n\n\"Well, then, we were blown off shore by the wind, and must of course\nhave come down this way; and here you see are three little islands,\ncalled Zaffarine Islands, and with no names of towns upon them, and\ntherefore uninhabited; and you see they lie just like the islands we are\nanchored among now--we must be at the Zaffarine Islands--and only six\ninches from Gibraltar.\"\n\n\"I see, Massa Easy, dat all right--but six debbelish long inches.\"\n\n\"Now, Mesty, you know the compass on the deck has a flourishing thing\nfor the north point--and here is a compass with a north point also.  Now\nthe north point from the Zaffarine Islands leads out to the Spanish\ncoast again, and Gibraltar lies five or six points of the compass to\nthis side of it--if we steer that way we shall get to Gibraltar.\"\n\n\"All right, Massa Easy,\" replied Mesty; and Jack was right, with the\nexception of the variation, which he knew nothing about.\n\nTo make sure, Jack brought one of the compasses down from deck, and\ncompared them.  He then lifted off the glass, counted the points of the\ncompass to the westward, and marked the corresponding one on the\nbinnacle compass with his pen.\n\n\"There,\" said he, \"that is the way to Gibraltar, and as soon as the\nmutiny is quelled, and the wind is fair, I'll be off.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\n\nIN WHICH JACK'S CRUISE IS ENDED, AND HE REGAINS THE HARPY.\n\nA few more days passed, and, as was expected, the mutineers could hold\nout no longer.  In the first place, they had put in the spile of the\nsecond cask of wine so loosely when they were tipsy that it dropped out,\nand all the wine ran out, so that there had been none left for three or\nfour days; in the next, their fuel had long been expended, and they had\nlatterly eaten their meat raw the loss of their tent, which had been\nfired by their carelessness, had been followed by four days and nights\nof continual rain.  Everything they had had been soaked through and\nthrough, and they were worn out, shivering with cold, and starving.\nHanging they thought better than dying by inches from starvation; and,\nyielding to the imperious demands of hunger, they came down to the\nbeach, abreast of the ship, and dropped down on their knees.\n\n\"I tell you so, Massa Easy,\" said Mesty: \"damn rascals, they forget they\ncome down fire musket at us every day: by all de powers, Mesty not\nforget it.\"\n\n\"Ship ahoy!\" cried one of the men on shore.\n\n\"What do you want?\" replied Jack.\n\n\"Have pity on us, sir--mercy!\" exclaimed the other men, \"we will return\nto our duty.\"\n\n\"Debbil doubt 'em!\"\n\n\"What shall I say, Mesty?\"\n\n\"Tell 'em no, first, Massa Easy--tell 'em to starve and be damned.\"\n\n\"I cannot take mutineers on board,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"Well, then, our blood be on your hands, Mr Easy,\" replied the first\nman who had spoken.  \"If we are to die, it must not be by inches--if you\nwill not take us, the sharks shall--it is but a crunch, and all is over.\nWhat do you say, my lads? let's all rush in together: good-bye, Mr\nEasy, I hope you'll forgive us when we're dead it was all that rascal\nJohnson, the coxswain, who persuaded us.  Come, my lads, it's no use\nthinking of it, the sooner done the better--let us shake hands, and then\nmake one run of it.\"\n\nIt appeared that the poor fellows had already made up their minds to do\nthis, if our hero, persuaded by Mesty, had refused to take them on\nboard.  They shook hands all round, and then walking a few yards from\nthe beach, stood in a line while the man gave the signal--one--two.\n\n\"Stop,\" cried Jack, who had not forgotten the dreadful scene which had\nalready taken place,--\"stop.\"\n\nThe men paused.\n\n\"What will you promise if I take you on board?\"\n\n\"To do our duty cheerfully till we join the ship, and then be hung as an\nexample to all mutineers,\" replied the men.\n\n\"Dat very fair,\" replied Mesty; \"take dem at their word, Massa Easy.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" replied Jack, \"I accept your conditions; and we will come\nfor you.\"\n\nJack and Mesty hauled up the boat, stuck their pistols in their belts,\nand pulled to the shore.  The men, as they stepped in, touched their\nhats respectfully to our hero, but said nothing.  On their arrival on\nboard Jack read that part of the articles of war relative to mutiny, by\nwhich the men were reminded of the very satisfactory fact, \"that they\nwere to suffer death;\" and then made a speech which, to men who were\nstarving, appeared to be interminable.  However, there is an end to\neverything in this world, and so there was to Jack's harangue; after\nwhich Mesty gave them some biscuit, which they devoured in thankfulness,\nuntil they could get something better.  The next morning the wind was\nfair, they weighed their hedge with some difficulty, and ran out of the\nharbour: the men appeared very contrite, worked well, but in silence,\nfor they had no very pleasant anticipations; but hope always remains\nwith us; and each of the men, although he had no doubt but that the\nothers would be hung, hoped that he would escape with a sound flogging.\nThe wind, however, did not allow them to steer their course long; before\nnight it was contrary, and they fell off three points to the northward.\n\"However,\" as Jack observed, \"at all events we shall make the Spanish\ncoast, and then we must run down it to Gibraltar: I don't care--I under\nstand navigation much better than I did.\"  The next morning they found\nthemselves, with a very light breeze, under a high cape, and, as the sun\nrose, they observed a large vessel inshore, about two miles to the\nwestward of them, and another outside, about four miles off.  Mesty took\nthe glass and examined the one outside, which, on a sudden, had let fall\nall her canvas, and was now running for the shore, steering for the cape\nunder which Jack's vessel lay.  Mesty put down the glass.\n\n\"Massa Easy--I tink dat de _Harpy_.\"\n\nOne of the seamen took the glass and examined her, while the others who\nstood by showed great agitation.\n\n\"Yes, it is the _Harpy_,\" said the seaman.  \"Oh Mr Easy, will you\nforgive us?\" continued the man, and he and the others fell on their\nknees.  \"Do not tell all, for God's sake, Mr Easy.\"\n\nJack's heart melted; he looked at Mesty.\n\n\"I tink,\" said Mesty apart to our hero, \"dat with what them hab suffer\nalready, suppose they get _seven dozen apiece_, dat quite enough.\"\n\nJack thought that even half that punishment would suffice; so he told\nthe men, that although he must state what had occurred, he would not\ntell all, and would contrive to get them off as well as he could.  He\nwas about to make a long speech, but a gun from the _Harpy_, which had\nnow come up within range, made him defer it till a more convenient\nopportunity.  At the same time the vessel in shore hoisted Spanish\ncolours, and fired a gun.\n\n\"By de powers, but we got in the middle of it,\" cried Mesty; \"_Harpy_\ntink us Spaniard.  Now, my lads, get all gun ready, bring up powder and\nshot.  Massa, now us fire at Spaniard--Harpy not fire at us--no ab\nEnglish colours on board--dat all we must do.\"\n\nThe men set to with a will; the guns were all loaded, and were soon cast\nloose and primed, during which operations it fell calm, and the sails of\nall three vessels flapped against their masts.  The _Harpy_ was then\nabout two miles from Jack's vessel, and the Spaniard about a mile from\nhim, with all her boats ahead of her, towing towards him; Mesty examined\nthe Spanish vessel.\n\n\"Dat man-o'-war, Massa Easy--what de debbil we do for colour? must hoist\nsometing.\"\n\nMesty ran down below; he recollected that there was a very gay\npetticoat, which had been left by the old lady who was in the vessel\nwhen they captured her.  It was of green silk, with yellow and blue\nflowers, but very faded, having probably been in the Don's family for a\ncentury.  Mesty had found it under the mattress of one of the beds, and\nhad put it into his bag, intending probably to cut it up into\nwaistcoats.  He soon appeared with this under his arm, made it fast to\nthe peak halyards and hoisted it up.\n\n\"Dere, massa, dat do very well--dat what you call _all nation colour_.\nEverybody strike him flag to dat--men nebber pull it down,\" said Mesty,\n\"anyhow.  Now den, ab hoist colour, we fire away--mind you only fire one\ngun at a time, and point um well, den ab time to load again.\"\n\n\"She's hoisted her colours, sir,\" said Sawbridge, on board of the\n_Harpy_; \"but they do not show out clear, and it's impossible to\ndistinguish them; but there's a gun.\"\n\n\"It's not at us, sir,\" said Gascoigne, the midshipman; \"its at the\nSpanish vessel--I saw the shot fall ahead of her.\"\n\n\"It must be a privateer,\" said Captain Wilson, \"at all events, it is\nvery fortunate, for the corvette would otherwise have towed into\nCarthagena.  Another gun, round and grape, and well pointed too; she\ncarries heavy metal, that craft; she must be a Maltese privateer.\"\n\n\"That's as much as to say that she's a pirate,\" replied Sawbridge; \"I\ncan make nothing of her colours--they appear to me to be green--she must\nbe a Turk.  Another gun--and devilish well aimed; it has hit the boats.\"\n\n\"Yes, they are all in confusion: we will have her now, if we can only\nget a trifle of wind.  That is a breeze coming up in the offing.  Trim\nthe sails, Mr Sawbridge.\"\n\nThe yards were squared, and the _Harpy_ soon had steerage way.  In the\nmeantime Jack and his few men had kept up a steady, well-directed,\nalthough slow, fire with their larboard guns upon the Spanish corvette;\nand two of her boats had been disabled.  The _Harpy_ brought the breeze\nup with her, and was soon within range; she steered to cut off the\ncorvette, firing only her bow-chasers.\n\n\"We ab her now,\" cried Mesty, \"fire away--men take good aim.  Breeze\ncome now; one man go to helm.  By de power, what dat?\"\n\nThe exclamation of Mesty was occasioned by a shot hulling the ship on\nthe starboard side.  Jack and he ran over, and perceived that three\nSpanish gun-boats had just made their appearance round the point, and\nhad attacked them.  The fact was, that on the other side of the cape was\nthe port and town of Carthagena, and these gun-boats had been sent out\nto the assistance of the corvette.  The ship had now caught the breeze,\nfortunately for Jack, or he would probably have been taken into\nCarthagena; and the corvette, finding herself cut off by both the\n_Harpy_ and Jack's vessel, as soon as the breeze came up to her, put her\nhead the other way, and tried to escape by running westward along the\ncoast close in shore.  Another shot, and then another, pierced the hull\nof the ship, and wounded two of Jack's men; but as the corvette had\nturned, and the _Harpy_ followed her, of course Jack did the same, and\nin ten minutes he was clear of the gun-boats, which did not venture to\nmake sail and stand after him.  The wind now freshened fast, and blew\nout the green petticoat, but the _Harpy_ was exchanging broadsides with\nthe corvette, and too busy to look after Jack's ensign.  The Spaniard\ndefended himself well, and had the assistance of the batteries as he\npassed, but there was no anchorage until he had run many miles farther.\nAbout noon the wind died away, and at one o'clock it again fell nearly\ncalm; but the _Harpy_ had neared her distance, and was now within three\ncables' length of her antagonist, engaging her and a battery of four\nguns.  Jack came up again, for he had the last of the breeze, and was\nabout half a mile from the corvette when it fell calm.  By the advice of\nMesty, he did not fire any more, or otherwise the _Harpy_ would not\nobtain so much credit, and it was evident that the fire of the Spaniard\nslackened fast.  At three o'clock the Spanish colours were hauled down,\nand the _Harpy_, sending a boat on board and taking possession, directed\nher whole fire upon the battery, which was soon silenced.\n\nThe calm continued, and the _Harpy_ was busy enough with the prize,\nshifting the prisoners and refitting both vessels, which had very much\nsuffered in the sails and rigging.  There was an occasional wonder on\nboard the _Harpy_ what that strange vessel might be which had turned the\ncorvette and enabled them to capture her, but when people are all very\nbusy, there is not much time for surmise.\n\nJack's crew, with himself, consisted but of eight, one of whom was a\nSpaniard, and two were wounded.  It therefore left him but four, and he\nhad also some thing to do, which was to assist his wounded men, and\nsecure his guns.  Moreover, Mesty did not think it prudent to leave the\nvessel a mile from the _Harpy_ with only two on board; besides, as Jack\nsaid, he had had no dinner, and was not quite sure that he should find\nanything to eat when he went into the midshipmen's berth; he would\ntherefore have some dinner cooked, and eat it before he went on board in\nthe meantime, they would try and close with her.  Jack took things\nalways very easy, and he said he should report himself at sunset.  There\nwere other reasons which made Jack in no very great hurry to go on\nboard; he wanted to have time to consider a little what he should say to\nexcuse himself, and also how he should plead for the men.  His natural\ncorrectness of feeling decided him, in the first place, to tell the\nwhole truth, and in the next, his kind feelings determined him to tell\nonly part of it.  Jack need not have given himself this trouble, for, as\nfar as regarded himself, he had fourteen thousand good excuses in the\nbags which lay in the state-room; and as for the men, after an action\nwith the enemy, if they behave well, even mutiny is forgiven.  At last\nJack, who was tired with excitement and the hard work of the day,\nthought and thought till he fell fast asleep, and instead of waking at\nsunset did not wake till two hours afterwards; and Mesty did not call\nhim, because he was in no hurry himself to go on board and _boil de\nkettle for de young gentlemen_.\n\nWhen Jack woke up he was astonished to find that he had slept so long:\nhe went on deck; it was dark and still calm, but he could easily\nperceive that the _Harpy_ and corvette were still hove-to, repairing\ndamages.  He ordered the men to lower down the small boat, and leaving\nMesty in charge, with two oars he pulled to the _Harpy_.  What with\nwounded men, with prisoners, and boats going and coming between the\nvessels, every one on board the _Harpy_ were well employed; and in the\ndark Jack's little boat came alongside without notice.  This should not\nhave been the case, but it was, and there was some excuse for it.  Jack\nascended the side, and pushed his way through the prisoners, who were\nbeing mustered to be victualled.  He was wrapped up in one of the\ngregos, and many of the prisoners wore the same.\n\nJack was amused at not being recognised: he slipped down the main\nladder, and had to stoop under the hammocks of the wounded men, and was\nabout to go aft to the captain's cabin to report himself, when he heard\nyoung Gossett crying out, and the sound of the rope.  \"Hang me, if that\nbrute Vigors an't thrashing young Gossett,\" thought Jack.  \"I dare say\nthe poor fellow had had plenty of it since I have been away; I'll save\nhim this time at least.\"  Jack, wrapped up in his grego, went to the\nwindow of the berth, looked in, and found it was as he expected.  He\ncried out in an angry voice, \"_Mr Vigors, I'll thank you to leave\nGossett alone_.\"  At the sound of the voice Vigors turned round with his\ncolt in his hand, saw Jack's face at the window, and, impressed with the\nidea that the reappearance was supernatural, uttered a yell and fell\ndown in a fit--little Gossett also trembling in every limb, stared with\nhis mouth open.  Jack was satisfied, and immediately disappeared.  He\nthen went aft to the cabin, pushed by the servant, who was giving some\norders from the captain to the officer on deck, and entering the cabin,\nwhere the captain was seated with two Spanish officers, took off his hat\nand said:\n\n\"Come on board, Captain Wilson.\"\n\nCaptain Wilson did not fall down in a fit, but he jumped up and upset\nthe glass before him.\n\n\"Merciful God!  Mr Easy, where did you come from?\"\n\n\"From that ship astern, sir,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"That ship astern! what is she?--where have you been so long?\"\n\n\"It's a long story, sir,\" replied Jack.\n\nCaptain Wilson extended his hand and shook Jack's heartily.\n\n\"At all events, I'm delighted to see you, boy: now sit down and tell me\nyour story in a few words; we will have it in detail by-and-bye.\"\n\n\"If you please, sir,\" said Jack, \"we captured that ship with the cutter\nthe night after we went away--I'm not a first-rate navigator, and I was\nblown to the Zaffarine Islands, where I remained two months for want of\nhands: as soon as I procured them I made sail again--I have lost three\nmen by sharks, and I have two wounded in to-day's fight--the ship mounts\ntwelve guns, is half laden with lead and cotton prints, has fourteen\nthousand dollars in the cabin, and three shot-holes right through her--\nand the sooner you send some people on board of her the better.\"\n\nThis was not very intelligible, but that there were fourteen thousand\ndollars, and that she required hands sent on board, was very\nsatisfactorily explained.  Captain Wilson rang the bell, sent for Mr\nAsper, who started back at the sight of our hero--desired him to order\nMr Jolliffe to go on board with one of the cutters, send the wounded\nmen on board, and take charge of the vessel, and then told Jack to\naccompany Mr Jolliffe, and to give him every information; telling him\nthat he would hear his story to-morrow, when they were not so very busy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\n\nIN WHICH OUR HERO FINDS OUT THAT TRIGONOMETRY IS NOT ONLY NECESSARY TO\nNAVIGATION, BUT MAY BE REQUIRED IN SETTLING AFFAIRS OF HONOUR.\n\nAs Captain Wilson truly said, he was too busy even to hear Jack's story\nthat night, for they were anxious to have both vessels ready to make\nsail as soon as a breeze should spring up, for the Spaniards had vessels\nof war at Carthagena, which was not ten miles off, and had known the\nresult of the action: it was therefore necessary to change their\nposition as soon as possible.  Mr Sawbridge was on board the prize,\nwhich was a corvette mounting two guns more than the _Harpy_, and called\nthe _Cacafuogo_.\n\nShe had escaped from Cadiz, run through the straits in the night, and\nwas three miles from Carthagena when she was captured, which she\ncertainly never would have been but for Jack's fortunately blundering\nagainst the cape with his armed vessel, so that Captain Wilson and Mr\nSawbridge (both of whom were promoted, the first to the rank of\npost-captain, the second to that of commander), may be said to be\nindebted to Jack for their good fortune.  The _Harpy_ had lost nineteen\nmen, killed and wounded, and the Spanish corvette forty-seven.\nAltogether, it was a very creditable affair.\n\nAt two o'clock in the morning, the vessels were ready, everything had\nbeen done that could be done in so short a time, and they stood under\neasy sail during the night for Gibraltar, the _Nostra Senora del\nCarmen_, under the charge of Jolliffe, keeping company.  Jolliffe had\nthe advantage over his shipmates, of first hearing Jack's adventures,\nwith which he was much astonished as well as amused--even Captain Wilson\nwas not more happy to see Jack than was the worthy master's mate.  About\nnine o'clock the _Harpy_ hove-to, and sent a boat on board for our hero\nand the men who had been so long with him in the prize, and then hoisted\nout the pinnace to fetch on board the dollars, which were of more\nimportance.  Jack, as he bade adieu to Jolliffe, took out of his pocket\nand presented him with the _articles of war_, which, as they had been so\nuseful to him, he thought Jolliffe could not do without, and then went\ndown the side: the men were already in the boat, casting imploring looks\nupon Jack, to raise feelings of compassion, and Mesty took his seat by\nour hero in a very sulky humour, probably because he did not like the\nidea of having again \"to boil de kettle for de young gentlemen.\"  Even\nJack felt a little melancholy at resigning his command, and he looked\nback at the green petticoat, which blew out gracefully from the mast,\nfor Jolliffe had determined that he would not haul down the colours\nunder which Jack had fought so gallant an action.\n\nJack's narration, as may be imagined, occupied a large part of the\nforenoon; and, although Jack did not attempt to deny that he had seen\nthe recall signal of Mr Sawbridge, yet, as his account went on, the\ncaptain became so interested that at the end of it he quite forgot to\npoint out to Jack the impropriety of not obeying orders.  He gave Jack\ngreat credit for his conduct, and was also much pleased with that of\nMesty.  Jack took the opportunity of stating Mesty's aversion to his\npresent employment, and his recommendation was graciously received.\nJack also succeeded in obtaining the pardon of the men, in consideration\nof their subsequent good behaviour; but notwithstanding this promise on\nthe part of Captain Wilson, they were ordered to be put in irons for the\npresent.  However, Jack told Mesty, and Mesty told the men, that they\nwould be released with a reprimand when they arrived at Gibraltar, so\nall that the men cared for was a fair wind.\n\nCaptain Wilson informed Jack that after his joining the admiral he had\nbeen sent to Malta with the prizes, and that, supposing the cutter to\nhave been sunk, he had written to his father, acquainting him with his\nson's death, at which our hero was much grieved, for he knew what sorrow\nit would occasion, particularly to his poor mother.  \"But,\" thought\nJack, \"if she is unhappy for three months, she will be overjoyed for\nthree more when she hears that I am alive, so it will be all square at\nthe end of the six; and as soon as I arrive at Gibraltar I will write,\nand, as the wind is fair, that will be to-morrow or next day.\"\n\nAfter a long conversation Jack was graciously dismissed, Captain Wilson\nbeing satisfied from what he had heard that Jack would turn out a very\ngood officer, and had already forgotten all about equality and the\nrights of man; but there Captain Wilson was mistaken--tares sown in\ninfancy are not so soon rooted out.\n\nJack went on deck as soon as the captain had dismissed him, and found\nthe captain and officers of the Spanish corvette standing aft, looking\nvery seriously at the _Nostra Senora del Carmen_.  When they saw our\nhero, who Captain Wilson had told them was the young officer who had\nbarred their entrance into Carthagena, they turned their eyes upon him\nnot quite so graciously as they might have done.\n\nJack, with his usual politeness, took off his hat to the Spanish\ncaptain, and, glad to have an opportunity of sporting his Spanish,\nexpressed the usual wish that he might live a thousand years.  The\nSpanish captain, who had reason to wish that Jack had gone to the devil\nat least twenty-four hours before, was equally complimentary, and then\nbegged to be informed what the colours were that Jack had hoisted during\nthe action.  Jack replied that they were colours to which every Spanish\ngentleman considered it no disgrace to surrender, although always ready\nto engage, and frequently at tempting to board.  Upon which the Spanish\ncaptain was very much puzzled.  Captain Wilson, who under stood a little\nSpanish, then interrupted by observing:\n\n\"By-the-bye, Mr Easy, what colours did you hoist up? we could not make\nthem out.  I see Mr Jolliffe still keeps them up at the peak.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Jack, rather puzzled what to call them, but at last\nhe replied that it was the banner of equality and the rights of man.\n\nCaptain Wilson frowned, and Jack, perceiving that he was displeased,\nthen told him the whole story, whereupon Captain Wilson laughed, and\nJack then also explained, in Spanish, to the officers of the corvette,\nwho replied that it was not the first time, and would not be the last,\nthat men had got into a scrape through a petticoat.\n\nThe Spanish captain complimented Jack on his Spanish, which was really\nvery good (for in two months, with nothing else in the world to do, he\nhad made great progress), and asked him where he had learned it.\n\nJack replied, \"At the Zaffarine Islands.\"\n\n\"Zaffarine Isles,\" replied the Spanish captain; \"they are not\ninhabited.\"\n\n\"Plenty of ground sharks,\" replied Jack.\n\nThe Spanish captain thought our hero a very strange fellow, to fight\nunder a green silk petticoat, and to take lessons in Spanish from the\nground sharks.  However, being quite as polite as Jack, he did not\ncontradict him, but took a huge pinch of snuff, wishing from the bottom\nof his heart that the ground sharks had taken Jack before he had hoisted\nthat confounded green petticoat.\n\nHowever, Jack was in high favour with the captain, and all the ship's\ncompany, with the exception of his four enemies--the master, Vigors, the\nboatswain, and the purser's steward.  As for Mr Vigors, he had come to\nhis senses again, and had put his colt in his chest until Jack should\ntake another cruise.  Little Gossett, at any insulting remark made by\nVigors, pointed to the window of the berth and grinned; and the very\nrecollection made Vigors turn pale, and awed him into silence.\n\nIn two days they arrived at Gibraltar--Mr Sawbridge rejoined the ship--\nso did Mr Jolliffe--they remained there a fortnight, during which Jack\nwas permitted to be continually on shore--Mr Asper accompanied him, and\nJack drew a heavy bill to prove to his father that he was still alive.\nMr Sawbridge made our hero relate to him all his adventures, and was so\npleased with the conduct of Mesty, that he appointed him to a situation\nwhich was particularly suited to him--that of ship's corporal.  Mr\nSawbridge knew that it was an office of trust, and provided that he\ncould find a man fit for it, he was very indifferent about his colour.\nMesty walked and strutted about, at least three inches taller than he\nwas before.  He was always clean, did his duty conscientiously, and\nseldom used his cane.\n\n\"I think, Mr Easy,\" said the first lieutenant, \"that as you are so\nparticularly fond of taking a cruise\"--for Jack had told the whole\ntruth--\"it might be as well that you improve your navigation.\"\n\n\"I do think myself, sir,\" replied Jack, with great modesty, \"that I am\nnot yet quite perfect.\"\n\n\"Well, then, Mr Jolliffe will teach you; he is the most competent in\nthis ship: the sooner you ask him the better, and if you learn it as\nfast as you have Spanish, it will not give you much trouble.\"\n\nJack thought the advice good: the next day he was very busy with his\nfriend Jolliffe, and made the important discovery that two parallel\nlines continued to infinity would never meet.\n\nIt must not be supposed that Captain Wilson and Mr Sawbridge received\ntheir promotion instanter.  Promotion is always attended with delay, as\nthere is a certain routine in the service which must not be departed\nfrom.  Captain Wilson had orders to return to Malta after his cruise.\nHe therefore carried his own despatches away from England--from Malta\nthe despatches had to be forwarded to Toulon to the admiral, and then\nthe admiral had to send to England to the Admiralty, whose reply had to\ncome out again.  All this, with the delays arising from vessels not\nsailing immediately, occupied an interval of between five and six\nmonths--during which time there was no alteration in the officers and\ncrew of his Majesty's sloop _Harpy_.\n\nThere had, however, been one alteration; the gunner, Mr Minus, who had\ncharge of the first cutter in the night action in which our hero was\nseparated from his ship, carelessly loading his musket, had found\nhimself minus his right hand, which, upon the musket going off as he\nrammed down, had gone off too.  He was invalided and sent home during\nJack's absence, and another had been appointed, whose name was Tallboys.\nMr Tallboys was a stout dumpy man, with red face, and still redder\nhands; he had red hair and red whiskers, and he had read a good deal--\nfor Mr Tallboys considered that the gunner was the most important\npersonage in the ship.  He had once been a captain's clerk, and having\ndistinguished himself very much in cutting-out service, had applied for\nand received his warrant as a gunner.  He had studied the _Art of\nGunnery_, a part of which he understood, but the remainder was above his\ncomprehension: he continued, however, to read it as before, thinking\nthat by constant reading he should understand it at last.  He had gone\nthrough the work from the title-page to the finis at least forty times,\nand had just commenced it over again.  He never came on deck without the\ngunner's vade-mecum in his pocket, with his hand always upon it to refer\nto it in a moment.\n\nBut Mr Tallboys had, as we observed before, a great idea of the\nimportance of a gunner, and, among other qualifications, he considered\nit absolutely necessary that he should be a navigator.  He had at least\nten instances to bring forward of bloody actions, in which the captain\nand all the commissioned officers had been killed or wounded, and the\ncommand of the ship had devolved upon the gunner.\n\n\"Now, sir,\" would he say, \"if the gunner is no navigator, he is not fit\nto take charge of his Majesty's ships.  The boatswain and carpenter are\nmerely practical men; but the gunner, sir, is, or ought to be,\nscientific.  Gunnery, sir, is a science--we have our own disparts and\nour lines of sight--our windage and our parabolas and projectile\nforces--and our point blank, and our reduction of powder upon a\ngraduated scale.  Now, sir, there's no excuse for a gunner not being a\nnavigator; for knowing his duty as a gunner, he has the same\nmathematical tools to work with.\"  Upon this principle Mr Tallboys had\nadded John Hamilton Moore to his library, and had advanced about as far\ninto navigation as he had in gunnery, that is, to the threshold, where\nhe stuck fast, with all his mathematical tools, which he did not know\nhow to use.  To do him justice, he studied for two or three hours\neveryday, and it was not his fault if he did not advance--but his head\nwas confused with technical terms; he mixed all up together, and\ndisparts, sines and cosines, parabolas, tangents, windage, seconds,\nlines of sight, logarithms, projectiles and traverse sailing, quadrature\nand Gunter's scales, were all crowded together, in a brain which had not\ncapacity to receive the rule of three.  \"Too much learning,\" said Festus\nto the apostle, \"hath made thee mad.\"  Mr Tallboys had not wit enough\nto go mad, but his learning lay like lead upon his brain: the more he\nread, the less he understood, at the same time that he became more\nsatisfied with his supposed acquirements, and could not speak but in\n\"mathematical parables.\"\n\n\"I understand, Mr Easy,\" said the gunner to him one day, after they had\nsailed for Malta, \"that you have entered into the science of\nnavigation--at your age it was high time.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Jack, \"I can raise a perpendicular, at all events, and\nbox the compass.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you have not yet arrived at the dispart of the compass.\"\n\n\"Not come to that yet,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"Are you aware that a ship sailing describes a parabola round the\nglobe?\"\n\n\"Not come to that yet,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"And that any propelled body striking against another flies off at a\ntangent?\"\n\n\"Very likely,\" replied Jack, \"that is a _sine_ that he don't like it.\"\n\n\"You have not yet entered into _acute_ trigonometry?\"\n\n\"Not come to that yet,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"That will require very sharp attention.\"\n\n\"I should think so,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"You will then find out how your parallels of longitude and latitude\nmeet.\"\n\n\"Two parallel lines, if continued to infinity, will never meet,\" replied\nJack.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said the gunner.\n\n\"I beg yours,\" said Jack.\n\nWhereupon Mr Tallboys brought up a small map of the world, and showed\nJack that all the parallels of latitude met at a point at the top and\nbottom.\n\n\"Parallel lines never meet,\" replied Jack, producing Hamilton Moore.\n\nWhereupon Jack and the gunner argued the point, until it was agreed to\nrefer the case to Mr Jolliffe, who asserted, with a smile, that those\nlines were parallels and not parallels.\n\nAs both were right, both were satisfied.\n\nIt was fortunate that Jack would argue in this instance: had he believed\nall the confused assertions of the gunner, he would have been as puzzled\nas the gunner himself.  They never met without an argument and a\nreference, and as Jack was put right in the end, he only learned the\nfaster.  By the time that he did know something about navigation he\ndiscovered that his antagonist knew nothing.  Before they arrived at\nMalta Jack could fudge a day's work.\n\nBut at Malta Jack got into another scrape.  Although Mr Smallsole could\nnot injure him, he was still Jack's enemy; the more so as Jack had\nbecome very popular: Vigors also submitted, planning revenge; but the\nparties in this instance were the boatswain and purser's steward.  Jack\nstill continued his forecastle conversation with Mesty; and the\nboatswain and purser's steward, probably from their respective ill-will\ntowards our hero, had become great allies.  Mr Easthupp now put on his\nbest jacket to walk the dog-watches with Mr Biggs, and they took every\nopportunity to talk at our hero.\n\n\"It's my peculiar hopinion,\" said Mr Easthupp, one evening, pulling at\nthe frill of his shirt, \"that a gentleman should behave as a gentleman,\nand that if a gentleman professes hopinions of hequality and such\nliberal sentiments, that he is bound as a gentle man to hact up to\nthem.\"\n\n\"Very true, Mr Easthupp; he is bound to act up to them; and not because\na person, who was a gentleman as well as himself, happens not to be on\nthe quarter-deck, to insult him because he only has perfessed opinions\nlike his own.\"\n\nHereupon Mr Biggs struck his rattan against the funnel, and looked at\nour hero.\n\n\"Yes,\" continued the purser's steward, \"I should like to see the fellow\nwho would have done so on shore however, the time will come when I can\nhagain pull on my plain coat, and then the insult shall be vashed out in\nblood, Mr Biggs.\"\n\n\"And I'll be cursed if I don't some day teach a lesson to the blackguard\nwho stole my trousers.\"\n\n\"Vas hall your money right, Mr Biggs?\" inquired the purser's steward.\n\n\"I didn't count,\" replied the boatswain magnificently.\n\n\"No--gentlemen are above that,\" replied Easthupp; \"but there are many\nlight-fingered gentry habout.  The quantity of vatches and harticles of\nvalue vich were lost ven I valked Bond Street in former times is\nincredible.\"\n\n\"I can say this, at all events,\" replied the boatswain, \"that I should\nbe always ready to give satisfaction to any person beneath me in rank,\nafter I had insulted him.  I don't stand upon my rank, although I don't\ntalk about equality, damme--no, nor consort with niggers.\"  All this was\ntoo plain for our hero not to understand, so Jack walked up to the\nboatswain, and taking his hat off, with the utmost politeness, said to\nhim:\n\n\"If I mistake not, Mr Biggs, your conversation refers to me.\"\n\n\"Very likely it does,\" replied the boatswain.  \"Listeners hear no good\nof themselves.\"\n\n\"It appears that gentlemen can't converse without being vatched,\"\ncontinued Mr Easthupp, pulling up his shirt-collar.\n\n\"It is not the first time that you have thought proper to make very\noffensive remarks, Mr Biggs; and as you appear to consider yourself\nill-treated in the affair of the trousers, for I tell you at once, that\nit was I who brought them on board, I can only say,\" continued our hero,\nwith a very polite bow, \"that I shall be most happy to give you\nsatisfaction.\"\n\n\"I am your superior officer, Mr Easy,\" replied the boatswain.\n\n\"Yes, by the rules of the service; but you just now asserted that you\nwould waive your rank--indeed, I dispute it on this occasion; I am on\nthe quarter-deck, and you are not.\"\n\n\"This is the gentleman whom you have insulted, Mr Easy,\" replied the\nboatswain, pointing to the purser's steward.\n\n\"Yes, Mr Heasy, quite as good a gentleman as yourself, although I av ad\nmisfortune--I ham of as hold a family as hany in the country,\" replied\nMr Easthupp, now backed by the boatswain; \"many the year did I valk\nBond Street, and I ave as good blood in my weins as you, Mr Heasy,\nhalthough I have been misfortunate--I've had hadmirals in my family.\"\n\n\"You have grossly insulted this gentleman,\" said Mr Biggs, in\ncontinuation; \"and notwithstanding all your talk of equality, you are\nafraid to give him satisfaction--you shelter yourself under your\nquarter-deck.\"\n\n\"Mr Biggs,\" replied our hero, who was now very wroth, \"I shall go on\nshore directly we arrive at Malta.  Let you, and this fellow, put on\nplain clothes, and I will meet you both--and then I'll show you whether\nI am afraid to give satisfaction.\"\n\n\"One at a time,\" said the boatswain.\n\n\"No, sir, not one at a time, but both at the same time--I will fight\nboth or none.  If you are my superior officer, you must _descend_,\"\nreplied Jack, with an ironical sneer, \"to meet me, or I will not descend\nto meet that fellow, whom I believe to have been little better than a\npickpocket.\"\n\nThis accidental hit of Jack's made the purser's steward turn pale as a\nsheet, and then equally red.  He raved and foamed amazingly, although he\ncould not meet Jack's indignant look, who then turned round again.\n\n\"Now, Mr Biggs, is this to be understood, or do you shelter yourself\nunder your _forecastle_?\"\n\n\"I'm no dodger,\" replied the boatswain, \"and we will settle the affair\nat Malta.\"\n\nAt which reply Jack returned to Mesty.\n\n\"Massa Easy, I look at um face, dat feller, Eastop, he no like it.  I go\nshore wid you, see fair play, anyhow--suppose I can?\"\n\nMr Biggs having declared that he would fight, of course had to look out\nfor a second, and he fixed upon Mr Tallboys, the gunner, and requested\nhim to be his friend.  Mr Tallboys, who had been latterly very much\nannoyed by Jack's victories over him in the science of navigation, and\ntherefore felt ill-will towards him, consented; but he was very much\npuzzled how to arrange that _three_ were to fight at the same time, for\nhe had no idea of there being two duels; so he went to his cabin and\ncommenced reading.  Jack, on the other hand, dared not say a word to\nJolliffe on the subject: indeed, there was no one in the ship to whom he\ncould confide but Gascoigne: he therefore went to him, and although\nGascoigne thought it was excessively _infra dig_ of Jack to meet even\nthe boatswain, as the challenge had been given there was no retracting:\nhe therefore consented, like all midshipmen, anticipating fun, and quite\nthoughtless of the consequences.\n\nThe second day after they had been anchored in Vallette harbour, the\nboatswain and gunner, Jack and Gascoigne, obtained permission to go on\nshore.  Mr Easthupp, the purser's steward, dressed in his best blue\ncoat with brass buttons and velvet collar, the very one in which he had\nbeen taken up when he had been vowing and protesting that he was a\ngentleman, at the very time that his hand was abstracting a pocket book,\nwent up on the quarter-deck, and requested the same indulgence, but Mr\nSawbridge refused, as he required him to return staves and hoops at the\ncooperage.  Mesty also, much to his mortification, was not to be spared.\n\nThis was awkward, but it was got over by proposing that the meeting\nshould take place behind the cooperage at a certain hour, on which Mr\nEasthupp might slip out and borrow a portion of the time appropriated to\nhis duty, to heal the breach in his wounded honour.  So the parties all\nwent on shore, and put up at one of the small inns to make the necessary\narrangements.\n\nMr Tallboys then addressed Mr Gascoigne, taking him apart while the\nboatswain amused himself with a glass of grog, and our hero sat outside\nteasing a monkey.\n\n\"Mr Gascoigne,\" said the gunner, \"I have been very much puzzled how\nthis duel should be fought, but I have at last found it out.  You see\nthat there are _three_ parties to fight; had there been two or four\nthere would have been no difficulty, as the right line or square might\nguide us in that instance; but we must arrange it upon the _triangle_ in\nthis.\"\n\nGascoigne stared; he could not imagine what was coming.\n\n\"Are you aware, Mr Gascoigne, of the properties of an equilateral\ntriangle?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the midshipman, \"that it has three equal sides--but what\nthe devil has that to do with the duel?\"\n\n\"Everything, Mr Gascoigne,\" replied the gunner; \"it has resolved the\ngreat difficulty: indeed, the duel between three can only be fought upon\nthat principle.  You observe,\" said the gunner, taking a piece of chalk\nout of his pocket, and making a triangle on the table, \"in this figure\nwe have three points, each equidistant from each other; and we have\nthree combatants--so that placing one at each point, it is all fair play\nfor the three: Mr Easy, for instance, stands here, the boatswain here,\nand the purser's steward at the third corner.  Now, if the distance is\nfairly measured, it will be all right.\"\n\n\"But then,\" replied Gascoigne, delighted at the idea, \"how are they to\nfire?\"\n\n\"It certainly is not of much consequence,\" replied the gunner, \"but\nstill, as sailors, it appears to me that they should fire with the sun;\nthat is, Mr Easy fires at Mr Biggs, Mr Biggs fires at Mr Easthupp,\nand Mr Easthupp fires at Mr Easy, so that you perceive that each party\nhas his shot at one, and at the same time receives the fire of another.\"\n\nGascoigne was in ecstasies at the novelty of the proceeding, the more so\nas he perceived that Easy obtained every advantage by the arrangement.\n\n\"Upon my word, Mr Tallboys, I give you great credit; you have a\nprofound mathematical head, and I am delighted with your arrangement.\nOf course, in these affairs, the principals are bound to comply with the\narrangements of the seconds, and I shall insist upon Mr Easy consenting\nto your excellent and scientific proposal.\"\n\nGascoigne went out, and pulling Jack away from the monkey, told him what\nthe gunner had proposed, at which Jack laughed heartily.\n\nThe gunner also explained it to the boatswain, who did not very well\ncomprehend, but replied:\n\n\"I dare say it's all right--shot for shot, and damn all favours.\"\n\nThe parties then repaired to the spot with two pairs of ship's pistols,\nwhich Mr Tallboys had smuggled on shore; and, as soon as they were on\nthe ground, the gunner called Mr Easthupp out of the cooperage.  In the\nmeantime, Gascoigne had been measuring an equilateral triangle of twelve\npaces--and marked it out.  Mr Tallboys, on his return with the purser's\nsteward, went over the ground, and finding that it was \"equal angles\nsubtended by equal sides,\" declared that it was all right.  Easy took\nhis station, the boatswain was put into his, and Mr Easthupp, who was\nquite in a mystery, was led by the gunner to the third position.\n\n\"But, Mr Tallboys,\" said the purser's steward, \"I don't understand\nthis.  Mr Easy will first fight Mr Biggs, will he not?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the gunner, \"this is a duel of three.  You will fire at\nMr Easy, Mr Easy will fire at Mr Biggs, and Mr Biggs will fire at\nyou.  It is all arranged, Mr Easthupp.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Mr Easthupp, \"I do not understand it.  Why is Mr Biggs to\nfire at me?  I have no quarrel with Mr Biggs.\"\n\n\"Because Mr Easy fires at Mr Biggs, and Mr Biggs must have his shot\nas well.\"\n\n\"If you have ever been in the company of gentlemen, Mr Easthupp,\"\nobserved Gascoigne, \"you must know something about duelling.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I've kept the best company, Mr Gascoigne, and I can give a\ngentleman satisfaction; but--\"\n\n\"Then, sir, if that is the case, you must know that your honour is in\nthe hands of your second, and that no gentleman appeals.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I know that, Mr Gascoigne; but still I've no quarrel with\nMr Biggs, and therefore, Mr Biggs, of course you will not aim at me.\"\n\n\"Why, you don't think that I'm going to be fired at for nothing,\"\nreplied the boatswain; \"no, no, I'll have my shot anyhow.\"\n\n\"But at your friend, Mr Biggs?\"\n\n\"All the same, I shall fire at somebody; shot for shot, and hit the\nluckiest.\"\n\n\"Vel, gentlemen, I purtest against these proceedings,\" replied Mr\nEasthupp; \"I came here to have satisfaction from Mr Easy, and not to be\nfired at by Mr Biggs.\"\n\n\"Don't you have satisfaction when you fire at Mr Easy,\" replied the\ngunner; \"what more would you have?\"\n\n\"I purtest against Mr Biggs firing at me.\"\n\n\"So you would have a shot without receiving one,\" cried Gascoigne: \"the\nfact is, that this fellow's a confounded coward, and ought to be kicked\ninto the cooperage again.\"\n\nAt this affront Mr Easthupp rallied, and accepted the pistol offered by\nthe gunner.\n\n\"You ear those words, Mr Biggs; pretty language to use to a gentleman.\nYou shall ear from me, sir, as soon as the ship is paid off.  I purtest\nno longer, Mr Tallboys; death before dishonour.  I'm a gentleman,\ndamme!\"\n\nAt all events, the swell was not a very courageous gentleman, for he\ntrembled most exceedingly as he pointed his pistol.\n\nThe gunner gave the word, as if he were exercising the great guns on\nboard ship.\n\n\"Cock your locks!\"--\"Take good aim at the object!\"--\"Fire!\"--\"Stop your\nvents!\"\n\nThe only one of the combatants who appeared to comply with the latter\nsupplementary order was Mr Easthupp, who clapped his hand to his\ntrousers behind, gave a loud yell, and then dropped down: the bullet\nhaving passed clean through his seat of honour, from his having\npresented his broadside as a target to the boatswain as he faced towards\nour hero.  Jack's shot had also taken effect, having passed through both\nthe boatswain's cheeks, without further mischief than extracting two of\nhis best upper double teeth, and forcing through the hole of the farther\ncheek the boatswain's own quid of tobacco.  As for Mr Easthupp's ball,\nas he was very unsettled, and shut his eyes before he fired, it had gone\nthe Lord knows where.\n\nThe purser's steward lay on the ground and screamed--the boatswain spit\nhis double teeth and two or three mouthfuls of blood out, and then threw\ndown his pistols in a rage.\n\n\"A pretty business, by God,\" sputtered he; \"he's put my pipe out.  How\nthe devil am I to pipe to dinner when I'm ordered, all my wind 'scaping\nthrough the cheeks?\"\n\nIn the meantime, the others had gone to the assistance of the purser's\nsteward, who continued his vociferations.  They examined him, and\nconsidered a wound in that part not to be dangerous.\n\n\"Hold your confounded bawling,\" cried the gunner, \"or you'll have the\nguard down here: you're not hurt.\"\n\n\"Han't hi?\" roared the steward.  \"Oh, let me die, let me die; don't move\nme!\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" cried the gunner, \"you must get up and walk down to the\nboat; if you don't we'll leave you--hold your tongue, confound you.  You\nwon't? then I'll give you something to halloo for.\"\n\nWhereupon Mr Tallboys commenced cuffing the poor wretch right and left,\nwho received so many swinging boxes of the ear, that he was soon reduced\nto merely pitiful plaints of \"Oh, dear!--such inhumanity--I purtest--oh,\ndear! must I get up?  I can't, indeed.\"\n\n\"I do not think he can move, Mr Tallboys,\" said Gascoigne; \"I should\nthink the best plan would be to call up two of the men from the\ncooperage, and let them take him at once to the hospital.\"\n\nThe gunner went down to the cooperage to call the men.  Mr Biggs, who\nhad bound up his face as if he had a toothache for the bleeding had been\nvery slight, came up to the purser's steward.\n\n\"What the hell are you making such a howling about?  Look at me, with\ntwo shot-holes through my figure-head, while you have only got one in\nyour stern: I wish I could change with you, by heavens, for I could use\nmy whistle then--now if I attempt to pipe, there will be such a wasteful\nexpenditure of his Majesty's stores of wind, that I never shall get out\na note.  A wicked shot of yours, Mr Easy.\"\n\n\"I really am very sorry,\" replied Jack, with a polite bow, \"and I beg to\noffer my best apology.\"\n\nDuring this conversation, the purser's steward felt very faint, and\nthought he was going to die.\n\n\"Oh, dear! oh, dear! what a fool I was; I never was a gentleman--only a\nswell: I shall die; I never will pick a pocket again--never--never--God\nforgive me!\"\n\n\"Why, confound the fellow,\" cried Gascoigne, \"so you were a pickpocket,\nwere you?\"\n\n\"I never will again,\" replied the fellow, in a faint voice: \"Hi'll\nhamend and lead a good life--a drop of water--oh! _lagged_ at last!\"\n\nThen the poor wretch fainted away: and Tallboys coming up with the men,\nhe was taken on their shoulders and walked off to the hospital, attended\nby the gunner and also the boatswain, who thought he might as well have\na little medical advice before he went on board.\n\n\"Well, Easy,\" said Gascoigne, collecting the pistols and tying them up\nin his handkerchief, \"I'll be shot, but we're in a pretty scrape;\nthere's no hushing this up.  I'll be hanged if I care, it's the best\npiece of fun I ever met with.\"  And at the remembrance of it Gascoigne\nlaughed till the tears ran down his cheeks.  Jack's mirth was not quite\nso excessive, as he was afraid that the purser's steward was severely\nhurt, and expressed his fears.\n\n\"At all events, you did not hit him,\" replied Gascoigne; \"all you have\nto answer for is the boatswains's mug--I think you've stopped his jaw\nfor the future.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid that our leave will be stopped for the future,\" replied\nJack.\n\n\"That we may take our oaths of,\" replied Gascoigne.\n\n\"Then look you, Ned,\" said Easy; \"I've lots of dollars; we may as well\nbe hanged for a sheep as a lamb, as the saying is; I vote that we do not\ngo on board.\"\n\n\"Sawbridge will send and fetch us,\" replied Ned; \"but he must find us\nfirst.\"\n\n\"That won't take long, for the soldiers will soon have our description\nand rout us out--we shall be pinned in a couple of days.\"\n\n\"Confound it, and they say that the ship is to be hove down, and that we\nshall be here six weeks at least, cooped up on board in a broiling sun,\nand nothing to do but to watch the pilot fish playing round the rudder,\nand munch bad apricots.  I won't go on board; look ye, Jack,\" said\nGascoigne, \"have you plenty of money?\"\n\n\"I have twenty doubloons, besides dollars,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"Well, then we will pretend to be so much alarmed at the result of this\nduel, that we dare not show ourselves, lest we should be hung.  I will\nwrite a note, and send it to Jolliffe, to say that we have hid ourselves\nuntil the affair is blown over, and beg him to intercede with the\ncaptain and first lieutenant.  I will tell him all the particulars, and\nrefer to the gunner for the truth of it; and then I know that, although\nwe should be punished, they will only laugh; but I will pretend that\nEasthupp is killed, and we are frightened out of our lives.  That will\nbe it; and then let's get on board one of the speronares which come with\nfruit from Sicily, sail in the night for Palermo, and then we'll have a\ncruise for a fortnight, and when the money is all gone we'll come back.\"\n\n\"That's a capital idea, Ned, and the sooner we do it the better.  I will\nwrite to the captain, begging him to get me off from being hung, and\ntelling him where we have fled to, and that letter shall be given after\nwe have sailed.\"\n\nThey were two very nice lads--our hero and Gascoigne.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\n\nIN WHICH OUR HERO SETS OFF ON ANOTHER CRUISE, IN WHICH HE IS NOT BLOWN\nOFF SHORE.\n\nGascoigne and our hero were neither of them in uniform, and they\nhastened to Nix Mangare stairs where they soon picked up the padrone of\na speronare.  They went with him into a wine-shop, and with the\nassistance of a little English from a Maltese boy, whose shirt hung out\nof his trousers, they made a bargain, by which it was agreed that, for\nthe consideration of two doubloons, he would sail that evening and land\nthem at Gergenti or some other town in Sicily, providing them with\nsomething to eat and gregos to sleep upon.\n\nOur two midshipmen then went back to the tavern from which they had set\noff to fight the duel, and ordering a good dinner to be served in a back\nroom, they amused themselves with killing flies, as they talked over the\nevents of the day, and waited for their dinner.\n\nAs Mr Tallboys did not himself think proper to go on board till the\nevening, and Mr Biggs also wished it to be dark before he went up the\nship's side, the events of the duel did not transpire till the next\nmorning.  Even then it was not known from the boatswain or gunner, but\nby a hospital mate coming on board to inform the surgeon that there was\none of their men wounded under their charge, but that he was doing very\nwell.\n\nMr Biggs had ascended the side with his face bound up.\n\n\"Confound that Jack Easy,\" said he, \"I have only been on leave twice\nsince I sailed from Portsmouth--once I was obliged to come up the side\nwithout my trousers, and show my bare stern to the whole ship's company,\nand now I am coming up, and dare not show my figure-head.\"  He reported\nhimself to the officer of the watch, and hasting to his cabin, went to\nbed, and lay the whole night awake from pain, thinking what excuse he\ncould possibly make for not coming on deck next morning to his duty.\n\nHe was, however, saved this trouble, for Mr Jolliffe brought the letter\nof Gascoigne up to Mr Sawbridge, and the captain had received that of\nour hero.\n\nCaptain Wilson came on board, and found that Mr Sawbridge could\ncommunicate all the particulars of which he had not been acquainted by\nJack; and after they had read over Gascoigne's letter in the cabin, and\ninterrogated Mr Tallboys, who was sent down under an arrest, they gave\nfree vent to their mirth.\n\n\"Upon my soul, there's no end to Mr Easy's adventures,\" said the\ncaptain.  \"I could laugh at the duel, for after all, it is nothing--and\nhe would have been let off with a severe reprimand; but the foolish boys\nhave set off in a speronare to Sicily, and how the devil are we to get\nthem back again?\"\n\n\"They'll come back, sir,\" replied Sawbridge, \"when all their money's\ngone.\"\n\n\"Yes, if they do not get into any more scrapes--that young scamp\nGascoigne is as bad as Easy, and now they are together there's no saying\nwhat may happen.  I dine at the Governor's to-day; how he will laugh\nwhen I tell him of this new way of fighting a duel!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, it is just the thing that will tickle old Tom.\"\n\n\"We must find out if they have got off the island, Sawbridge, which may\nnot be the case.\"\n\nBut it was the case.  Jack and Gascoigne had eaten a very good dinner,\nsent for the monkey to amuse them till it was dark, and there had waited\ntill the padrone came to them.\n\n\"What shall we do with the pistols, Easy?\"\n\n\"Take them with us, and load them before we go--we may want them: who\nknows but there may be a mutiny on board of the speronare?--I wish we\nhad Mesty with us.\"\n\nThey loaded the pistols, took a pair each and put them in their waists,\nconcealed under their clothes--divided the ammunition between them, and\nsoon afterwards the padrone came to tell them all was ready.\n\nWhereupon Messrs. Gascoigne and Easy paid their bill and rose to depart,\nbut the padrone informed them that he should like to see the colour of\ntheir money before they went on board.  Jack, very indignant at the\ninsinuation that he had not sufficient cash, pulled out a handful of\ndoubloons, and tossing two to the padrone, asked him if he was\nsatisfied.\n\nThe padrone untied his sash, put in the money, and with many thanks and\nprotestations of service, begged our young gentlemen to accompany him:\nthey did so, and in a few minutes were clear of Nix Mangare stairs, and,\npassing close to his Majesty's ship _Harpy, _were soon out of the\nharbour of Vallette.\n\nOf all the varieties of vessels which float upon the wave, there is not,\nperhaps, one that bounds over the water so gracefully or so lightly as a\nsperonare, or any one so picturesque and beautiful to the eye of those\nwho watch its progress.\n\nThe night was clear, and the stars shone out brilliantly as the light\ncraft skimmed over the water, and a fragment of a descending and waning\nmoon threw its soft beams upon the snow-white sail.  The vessel, which\nhad no neck, was full of baskets, which had contained grapes and various\nfruits brought from the ancient granary of Rome, still as fertile and as\nluxuriant as ever.  The crew consisted of the padrone, two men and a\nboy; the three latter, with their gregos, or night greatcoats with\nhoods, sitting forward before the sail, with their eyes fixed on the\nland as they flew past point after point, thinking perhaps of their\nwives, or perhaps of their sweethearts, or perhaps not thinking at all.\n\nThe padrone remained aft at the helm, offering every politeness to our\ntwo young gentlemen, who only wished to be left alone.  At last they\nrequested the padrone to give them gregos to lie down upon, as they\nwished to go to sleep.  He called the boy to take the helm, procured\nthem all they required, and then went forward.  And our two midshipmen\nlaid down looking at the stars above them, for some minutes, without\nexchanging a word.  At last Jack commenced.\n\n\"I have been thinking, Gascoigne, that this is very delightful.  My\nheart bounds with the vessel, and it almost appears to me as if the\nvessel herself was rejoicing in her liberty.  Here she is capering over\nthe waves instead of being tied by the nose with a cable and anchor.\"\n\n\"That's a touch of the sentimental, Jack,\" replied Gascoigne; \"but she\nis no more free than she was when at anchor, for she now is forced to\nact in obedience to her steersman, and go just where he pleases.  You\nmay just as well say that a horse, if taken out of the stable, is free,\nwith the curb and his rider on his back.\"\n\n\"That's a touch of the rational, Ned, which destroys the illusion.\nNever mind, we are free, at all events.  What machines we are on board\nof a man-of-war!  We walk, talk, eat, drink, sleep, and get up, just\nlike clock-work; we are wound up to go the twenty-four hours, and then\nwound up again; just like old Smallsole does the chronometers.\"\n\n\"Very true, Jack; but it does not appear to me, that, hitherto, you have\nkept very good time: you require a little more regulating,\" said\nGascoigne.\n\n\"How can you expect any piece of machinery to go well, so damnably\nknocked about as a midshipman is?\" replied our hero.\n\n\"Very true, Jack; but sometimes you don't keep any time, for you don't\nkeep any watch.  Mr Asper don't wind you up.  You don't go at all.\"\n\n\"No; because he allows me to go _down; _but still I do _go, _Ned.\"\n\n\"Yes, to your hammock--but it's _no go_ with old Smallsole, if I want a\nbit of _caulk_.  But, Jack, what do you say--shall we keep watch\nto-night?\"\n\n\"Why, to tell you the truth, I have been thinking the same thing--I\ndon't much like the looks of the padrone--he squints.\"\n\n\"That's no proof of anything, Jack, except that his eyes are not\nstraight; but if you do not like the look of him, I can tell you that he\nvery much liked the look of your doubloons--I saw him start, and his\neyes twinkled, and I thought at the time it was a pity you had not paid\nhim in dollars.\"\n\n\"It was very foolish in me; but at all events he has not seen all.\"\n\n\"He saw quite enough, Ned.\"\n\n\"Very true, but you should have let him see the pistols, and not have\nlet him see the doubloons.\"\n\n\"Well, if he wishes to take what he has seen, he shall receive what he\nhas not seen--why, there are only four of them?\"\n\n\"Oh, I have no fear of them, only it may be as well to sleep with one\neye open.\"\n\n\"When shall we make the land?\"\n\n\"To-morrow evening with this wind, and it appears to be steady.  Suppose\nwe keep watch and watch, and have our pistols out ready, with the\ngreatcoats just turned over them, to keep them out of sight?\"\n\n\"Agreed--it's about twelve o'clock now--who shall keep the middle\nwatch?\"\n\n\"I will, Jack, if you like it.\"\n\n\"Well, then, mind you kick me hard, for I sleep devilish sound.  Good--\nnight, and keep a sharp lookout.\"\n\nJack was fast asleep in less than ten minutes; and Gascoigne, with his\npistols lying by him all ready for each hand, sat up at the bottom of\nthe boat.\n\nThere certainly is a peculiar providence in favour of midshipmen\ncompared with the rest of mankind; they have more lives than a cat--\nalways in the greatest danger, but always escaping from it.\n\nThe padrone of the vessel had been captivated with the doubloons which\nJack had so foolishly exposed to his view, and he had, moreover,\nresolved to obtain them.  At the very time that our two lads were\nconversing aft, the padrone was talking the matter over with his two men\nforward, and it was agreed that they should murder, rifle, and then\nthrow them overboard.\n\nAbout two o'clock in the morning, the padrone came aft to see if they\nwere asleep, but found Gascoigne watching.  He returned aft again and\nagain; but found the young man still sitting up.  Tired of waiting,\nanxious to possess the money, and supposing that the lads were armed, he\nwent once more forward and spoke to the men.  Gascoigne had watched his\nmotions; he thought it singular that, with three men in the vessel, the\nhelm should be confided to the boy--and at last he saw them draw their\nknives.  He pushed our hero, who woke immediately Gascoigne put his hand\nover Jack's mouth, that he might not speak, and then he whispered his\nsuspicions.  Jack seized his pistols--they both cocked them without\nnoise, and then waited in silence, Jack still lying down while Gascoigne\ncontinued to sit up at the bottom of the boat.  At last Gascoigne saw\nthe three men coming aft--he dropped one of his pistols for a second to\ngive Jack a squeeze of the hand, which was returned, and as Gascoigne\nwatched them making their way through the piles of empty baskets he\nleaned back as if he was slumbering.  The padrone, followed by the two\nmen, was at last aft--they paused a moment before they stepped over the\nstrengthening plank, which ran from side to side of the boat between\nthem and the midshipmen, and as neither of them stirred they imagined\nthat both were asleep--advanced and raised their knives, when Gascoigne\nand Jack, almost at the same moment, each discharged their pistols into\nthe breast of the padrone and one of the men, who was with him in\nadvance, who both fell with the send aft of the boat, so as to encumber\nthe midshipmen with the weight of their bodies.  The third man started\nback.  Jack, who could not rise, from the padrone lying across his legs,\ntook a steady aim with his second pistol, and the third man fell.  The\nboy at the helm, who, it appeared, either was aware of what was to be\ndone, or seeing the men advance with their knives, had acted upon what\nhe saw, also drew his knife and struck at Gascoigne from behind.  The\nknife fortunately, after slightly wounding Gascoigne on the shoulder,\nhad shut on the boy's hand--Gascoigne sprang up with his other pistol,\nthe boy started back at the sight of it, lost his balance, and fell\noverboard.\n\nOur two midshipmen took a few seconds to breathe.\n\n\"I say, Jack,\" said Gascoigne at last, \"did you ever--\"\n\n\"No, I never--\" replied Jack.\n\n\"What's to be done now?\"\n\n\"Why, as we've got possession, Ned, we had better put a man at the\nhelm--for the speronare is having it all her own way.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" replied Gascoigne; \"and as I can steer better than you, I\nsuppose it must be me.\"\n\nGascoigne went to the helm, brought the boat up to the wind, and then\nthey resumed their conversation.\n\n\"That rascal of a boy gave me a devil of a lick on the shoulder; I don't\nknow whether he has hurt me--at all events it's my left shoulder, so I\ncan steer just as well.  I wonder whether the fellows are dead.\"\n\n\"The padrone is, at all events,\" replied Jack.  \"It was as much as I\ncould do to get my legs from under him--but we'll wait till daylight\nbefore we see to that--in the meantime, I'll load the pistols again.\"\n\n\"The day is breaking now--it will be light in half an hour or less.\nWhat a devil of a spree, Jack!\"\n\n\"Yes, but how can one help it?  We ran away because two men are\nwounded--and now we are obliged to kill four in self-defence.\"\n\n\"Yes, but that is not the end of it; when we get to Sicily what are we\nto do? we shall be imprisoned by the authorities--perhaps hung.\"\n\n\"We'll argue that point with them,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"We had better argue the point between ourselves, Jack, and see what\nwill be the best plan to get out of our scrape.\"\n\n\"I think that we just have got out of it--never fear but we'll get out\nof the next.  Do you know, Gascoigne, it appears to me very odd, but I\ncan do nothing but there's a bobbery at the bottom of it.\"\n\n\"You certainly have a great talent that way, Jack.  Don't I hear one of\nthese poor fellows groan?\"\n\n\"I should think that not impossible.\"\n\n\"What shall we do with them?\"\n\n\"We will argue that point, Ned--we must either keep their bodies or we\nmust throw them overboard.  Either tell the whole story or say nothing\nabout it.\"\n\n\"That's very evident; in short, we must do something, for your argument\ngoes no further.  But now let us take up one of your propositions.\"\n\n\"Well then, suppose we keep the bodies on board, run into a seaport, go\nto the authorities, and state all the facts, what then?\"\n\n\"We shall prove, beyond all doubt, that we have killed three men, if not\nfour; but we shall not prove that we were obliged so to do, Jack.  And\nthen we are heretics--we shall be put in prison till they are satisfied\nof our innocence, which we never can prove, and there we shall remain\nuntil we have written to Malta, and a man-of-war comes to redeem us, if\nwe are not stabbed, or something else in the meantime.\"\n\n\"That will not be a very pleasant cruise,\" replied Jack.  \"Now let's\nargue the point on the other side.\"\n\n\"There is some difficulty there--suppose we throw their bodies\noverboard, toss the baskets after them, wash the boat clean, and make\nfor the first port.  We may chance to hit upon the very spot from which\nthey sailed, and then there will be a pack of wives and children, and a\npopulace with knives, asking us what has become of the men of the boat.\"\n\n\"I don't much like the idea of that,\" said Jack.\n\n\"And if we don't have such bad luck, still we shall be interrogated as\nto who we are, and how we were adrift by ourselves.\"\n\n\"There will be a difficulty about that again--we must swear that it is a\nparty of pleasure, and that we are gentlemen yachting.\"\n\n\"Without a crew or provisions--yachts don't sail with a clean-swept\nhold, or gentlemen without a spare shirt--we have nothing but two\ngallons of water and two pairs of pistols.\"\n\n\"I have it,\" said Jack--\"we are two young gentlemen in our own boat who\nwent out to Gozo with pistols to shoot sea-mews, were caught in a gale,\nand blown down to Sicily--that will excite interest.\"\n\n\"That's the best idea yet, as it will account for our having nothing in\nthe boat.  Well then, at all events, we will get rid of the bodies; but\nsuppose they are not dead--we cannot throw them overboard alive--that\nwill be murder.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" replied Jack; \"then we must shoot them first, and toss them\noverboard afterwards.\"\n\n\"Upon my soul, Easy, you are an odd fellow: however, go and examine the\nmen, and we'll decide that point by-and-bye--you had better keep your\npistol ready cocked for they may be shamming.\"\n\n\"Devil a bit of sham here, anyhow,\" replied Jack, pulling at the body of\nthe padrone, \"and as for this fellow you shot, you might put your fist\ninto his chest.  Now for the third,\" continued Jack, stepping over the\nstrengthening piece--\"he's all among the baskets.  I say, my cock, are\nyou dead?\" and Jack enforced his question with a kick in the ribs.  The\nman groaned.  \"That's unlucky, Gascoigne, but, however, I'll soon settle\nhim,\" said Jack, pointing his pistol.\n\n\"Stop, Jack,\" cried Gascoigne, \"it really will be murder.\"\n\n\"No such thing, Ned; I'll just blow his brains out, and then I'll come\naft and argue the point with you.\"\n\n\"Now do oblige me by coming aft and arguing the point first.  Do, Jack,\nI beg of you--I entreat you.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" replied Jack, resuming his seat by Gascoigne; \"I\nassert, that in this instance killing's no murder.  You will observe,\nNed, that by the laws of society, any one who attempts the life of\nanother has forfeited his own; at the same time, as it is necessary that\nthe fact should be clearly proved and justice be duly administered, the\nparties are tried, convicted, and then are sentenced to the punishment.\"\n\n\"I grant all that.\"\n\n\"In this instance the attempt has been clearly proved; we are the\nwitnesses, and are the judges and jury, and society in general, for the\nbest of all possible reasons, because there is nobody else.  These men's\nlives being therefore forfeited to society, belong to us; and it does\nnot follow because they were not all killed in the attempt, that\ntherefore they are not now to be brought out for punishment.  And as\nthere is no common hangman here, we, of course, must do this duty as\nwell as every other.  I have now clearly proved that I am justified in\nwhat I am about to do.  But the argument does not stop there--\nself-preservation is the first law of nature, and if we do not get rid\nof this man, what is the consequence?--that we shall have to account for\nhis being wounded, and then, instead of judges, we shall immediately be\nplaced in the position of culprits, and have to defend ourselves without\nwitnesses.  We therefore risk our lives from a misplaced lenity towards\na wretch unworthy to live.\"\n\n\"Your last argument is strong, Easy, but I cannot consent to your doing\nwhat may occasion you uneasiness hereafter when you think of it.\"\n\n\"Pooh! nonsense--I am a philosopher.\"\n\n\"Of what school, Jack?  Oh, I presume you are a disciple of Mesty's.  I\ndo not mean to say that you are wrong, but still hear my proposition.\nLet us lower down the sail, and then I can leave the helm to assist you.\nWe will clear the vessel of everything except the man who is still\nalive.  At all events, we may wait a little, and if at last there is no\nhelp for it, I will then agree with you to launch him overboard, even if\nhe is not quite dead.\"\n\n\"Agreed; even by your own making out, it will be no great sin.  He is\nhalf dead already--I only do _half _the work of tossing him over, so it\nwill be only _quarter _murder on my part, and he would have shown no\nquarter on his.\"  Here Jack left off arguing and punning, and went\nforward and lowered down the sail.  \"I've half a mind to take my\ndoubloons back,\" said Jack, as they launched over the body of the\npadrone, \"but he may have them--I wonder whether they'll ever turn up\nagain?\"\n\n\"Not in our time, Jack,\" replied Gascoigne.\n\nThe other body, and all the basket lumber, etcetera, were then tossed\nover, and the boat was cleared of all but the man who was not yet dead.\n\n\"Now let's examine the fellow, and see if he has any chance of\nrecovery,\" said Gascoigne.\n\nThe man lay on his side; Gascoigne turned him over, and found that he\nwas dead.\n\n\"Over with him, quick,\" said Jack, \"before he comes to life again.\"\n\nThe body disappeared under the wave--they again hoisted the sail,\nGascoigne took the helm, and our hero proceeded to draw water and wash\naway the stains of blood; he then cleared the boat of vine-leaves and\nrubbish, with which it was strewed, swept it clean fore and aft, and\nresumed his seat by his comrade.\n\n\"There,\" said Jack, \"now we've swept the decks, we may pipe to dinner.\nI wonder whether there is anything to eat in the locker?\"\n\nJack opened it, and found some bread, garlic, sausages, a bottle of\naquadente, and a jar of wine.\n\n\"So the padrone did keep his promise, after all.\"\n\n\"Yes, and had you not tempted him with the sight of so much gold, might\nnow have been alive.\"\n\n\"To which I reply, that if you had not advised our going off in a\nsperonare, he would now have been alive.\"\n\n\"And if you had not fought a duel, I should not have given the advice.\"\n\n\"And if the boatswain had not been obliged to come on board without his\ntrousers, at Gibraltar, I should not have fought a duel.\"\n\n\"And if you had not joined the ship, the boatswain would have had his\ntrousers on.\"\n\n\"And if my father had not been a philosopher, I should not have gone to\nsea; so that it is all my father's fault, and he has killed four men off\nthe coast of Sicily, without knowing it--cause and effect.  After all,\nthere's nothing like argument; so having settled that point, let us go\nto dinner.\"\n\nHaving finished their meal, Jack went forward and observed the land\nahead; they steered the same course for three or four hours.\n\n\"We must haul our wind more,\" said Gascoigne; \"it will not do to put\ninto any small town: we have now to choose, whether we shall land on the\ncoast and sink the speronare, or land at some large town.\"\n\n\"We must argue that point,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"In the meantime, do you take the helm, for my arm is quite tired,\"\nreplied Gascoigne: \"you can steer well enough; by-the-bye, I may as well\nlook at my shoulder, for it is quite stiff.\"  Gascoigne pulled off his\ncoat, and found his shirt bloody and sticking to the wound, which, as we\nbefore observed, was slight.  He again took the helm, while Jack washed\nit clean and then bathed it with aquadente.\n\n\"Now take the helm again,\" said Gascoigne; \"I'm on the sick list.\"\n\n\"And as surgeon--I'm an idler,\" replied Jack; \"but what shall we do?\"\ncontinued he; \"abandon the speronare at night and sink her, or run in\nfor a town?\"\n\n\"We shall fall in with plenty of boats and vessels if we coast it up to\nPalermo, and they may overhaul us.\"\n\n\"We shall fall in with plenty of people if we go on shore, and they will\noverhaul us.\"\n\n\"Do you know, Jack, that I wish we were back and alongside of the\n_Harpy; _I've had cruising enough.\"\n\n\"My cruises are so unfortunate,\" replied Jack; \"they are too full of\nadventure; but then, I have never yet had a cruise on shore.  Now, if we\ncould only get to Palermo, we should be out of all our difficulties.\"\n\n\"The breeze freshens, Jack,\" replied Gascoigne; \"and it begins to look\nvery dirty to windward.  I think we shall have a gale.\"\n\n\"Pleasant--I know what it is to be short-handed in a gale; however,\nthere's one comfort, we shall not be blown _off shore _this time.\"\n\n\"No, but we may be wrecked on a lee shore.  She cannot carry her whole\nsail, Easy; we must lower it down, and take in a reef; the sooner the\nbetter, for it will be dark in an hour.  Go forward and lower it down,\nand then I'll help you.\"\n\nJack did so, but the sail went into the water, and he could not drag it\nin.\n\n\"Avast heaving,\" said Gascoigne, \"till I throw her up and take the wind\nout of it.\"\n\nThis was done; they reefed the sail, but could not hoist it up: if\nGascoigne left the helm to help Jack, the sail filled; if he went to the\nhelm and took the wind out of the sail, Jack was not strong enough to\nhoist it.  The wind increased rapidly, and the sea got up; the sun went\ndown, and with the sail half hoisted, they could not keep to the wind,\nbut were obliged to run right for the land.  The speronare flew, rising\non the crest of the waves with half her keel clear of the water: the\nmoon was already up, and gave them light enough to perceive that they\nwere not five miles from the coast, which was lined with foam.\n\n\"At all events, they can't accuse us of running away with the boat,\"\nobserved Jack; \"for she's running away with us.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Gascoigne, dragging at the tiller with all his strength;\n\"she has taken the bit between her teeth.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't care if I had a bit between mine,\" replied Jack; \"for I feel\ndevilish hungry again.  What do you say, Ned?\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" replied Gascoigne; \"but, do you know, Easy, it may\nbe the last meal we ever make.\"\n\n\"Then I vote it's a good one--but why so, Ned?\"\n\n\"In half an hour, or thereabouts, we shall be on shore.\"\n\n\"Well, that's where we want to go.\"\n\n\"Yes, but the sea runs high, and the boat may be dashed to pieces on the\nrocks.\"\n\n\"Then we shall be asked no questions about her or the men.\"\n\n\"Very true, but a lee shore is no joke; we may be knocked to pieces, as\nwell as the boat--even swimming may not help us.  If we could find a\ncove or sandy beach, we might, perhaps, manage to get on shore.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Jack, \"I have not been long at sea, and, of course,\ncannot know much about these things.  I have been blown off shore, but I\nnever have been blown on.  It may be as you say, but I do not see the\ngreat danger--let's run her right up on the beach at once.\"\n\n\"That's what I shall try to do,\" replied Gascoigne, who had been four\nyears at sea, and knew very well what he was about.\n\nJack handed him a huge piece of bread and sausage.\n\n\"Thank ye, I cannot eat.\"\n\n\"I can,\" replied Jack, with his mouth full.\n\nJack ate while Gascoigne steered; and the rapidity with which the\nsperonare rushed to the beach was almost frightful.  She darted like an\narrow from wave to wave, and appeared as if mocking their attempts as\nthey curled their summits almost over her narrow stern.  They were\nwithin a mile of the beach, when Jack, who had finished his supper, and\nwas looking at the foam boiling on the coast, exclaimed:\n\n\"That's very fine--very beautiful, upon my soul!\"\n\n\"He cares for nothing,\" thought Gascoigne; \"he appears to have no idea\nof danger.\"\n\n\"Now, my dear fellow,\" said Gascoigne, \"in a few minutes we shall be on\nthe rocks.  I must continue at the helm, for the higher she is forced up\nthe better chance for us; but we may not meet again, so if we do not,\ngood-bye, and God bless you.\"\n\n\"Gascoigne,\" said Jack, \"you are hurt and I am not; your shoulder is\nstiff, and you can hardly move your left arm.  Now I can steer for the\nrocks as well as you.  Do you go to the bow, and there you will have a\nbetter chance.  By-the-bye,\" continued he, picking up his pistols, and\nsticking them into his waist, \"I won't leave them, they've served us too\ngood a turn already.  Gascoigne, give me the helm.\"\n\n\"No, no, Easy.\"\n\n\"I say yes,\" replied Jack, in a loud, authoritative tone, \"and what's\nmore, I will be obeyed, Gascoigne.  I have nerve, if I haven't\nknowledge, and at all events I can steer for the beach.  I tell you,\ngive me the helm.  Well, then, if you won't--I must take it.\"\n\nEasy wrested the tiller from Gascoigne's hand, and gave him a shove\nforward.\n\n\"Now do you look out ahead, and tell me how to steer.\"\n\nWhatever may have been Gascoigne's feelings at this behaviour of our\nhero's, it immediately occurred to him that he could not do better than\nto run the speronare to the safest point, and that therefore he was\nprobably more advantageously employed than if he were at the helm.  He\nwent forward and looked at the rocks, covered at one moment with the\ntumultuous waters, and then pouring down cascades from their sides as\nthe waves recoiled.  He perceived a chasm right ahead, and he thought if\nthe boat was steered for that, she must be thrown up so as to enable\nthem to get clear of her, for at every other part escape appeared\nimpossible.\n\n\"Starboard a little--that'll do.  Steady--port it is--port.  Steer\nsmall, for your life, Easy.  Steady now--mind the yard don't hit your\nhead--hold on.\"\n\nThe speronare was at this moment thrown into a large cleft in a rock,\nthe sides of which were nearly perpendicular; nothing else could have\nsaved them, as, had they struck the rock outside, the boat would have\nbeen dashed to pieces, and its fragments have disappeared in the\nundertow.  As it was, the cleft was not four feet more than the width of\nthe boat, and as the waves hurled her up into it, the yard of the\nsperonare was thrown fore and aft with great violence, and had not Jack\nbeen warned, he would have been struck overboard without a chance of\nbeing saved; but he crouched down and it passed over him.  As the water\nreceded, the boat struck, and was nearly dry between the rocks, but\nanother wave followed, dashing the boat farther up, but, at the same\ntime, filling it with water.  The bow of the boat was now several feet\nhigher than the stern, where Jack held on; and the weight of the water\nin her, with the force of the returning waves, separated her right\nacross abaft the mast.  Jack perceived that the after-part of the boat\nwas going out again with the wave; he caught hold of the yard which had\nswung fore and aft, and as he clung to it, the part of the boat on which\nhe had stood disappeared from under him, and was swept away by the\nreturning current.\n\nJack required the utmost of his strength to maintain his position until\nanother wave floated him, and dashed him higher up: but he knew his life\ndepended on holding on to the yard, which he did, although under water,\nand advanced several feet.  When the wave receded, he found footing on\nthe rock, and still clinging, he walked till he had gained the fore-part\nof the boat, which was wedged firmly into a narrow part of the cleft.\nThe next wave was not very large, and he had gained so much that it did\nnot throw him off his legs.  He reached the rock, and as he climbed up\nthe side of the chasm to gain the ledge above, he perceived Gascoigne\nstanding above him, and holding out his hand to his assistance.\n\n\"Well,\" says Jack, shaking himself to get rid of the water, \"here we\nare, ashore at last--I had no idea of anything like this.  The rush back\nof the water was so strong that it has almost torn my arms out of their\nsockets.  How very lucky I sent you forward with your disabled shoulder.\nBy-the-bye, now that it's all over, and you must see that I was right,\nI beg to apologise for my rudeness.\"\n\n\"There needs no apology for saving my life, Easy,\" replied Gascoigne,\ntrembling with the cold; \"and no one but you would ever have thought of\nmaking one at such a moment.\"\n\n\"I wonder whether the ammunition's dry,\" said Jack; \"I put it all in my\nhat.\"\n\nJack took off his hat, and found the cartridges had not suffered.\n\n\"Now then, Gascoigne, what shall we do?\"\n\n\"I hardly know,\" replied Gascoigne.\n\n\"Suppose, then, we sit down and argue the point.\"\n\n\"No, I thank you, there will be too much cold water thrown upon our\narguments--I'm half dead; let us walk on.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" said Jack, \"it's devilish steep, but I can argue up\nhill or down hill, wet or dry--I'm used to it--for, as I told you\nbefore, Ned, my father is a philosopher, and so am I.\"\n\n\"By the Lord! _you are_,\" replied Gascoigne, as he walked on.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\n\nIN WHICH OUR HERO FOLLOWS HIS DESTINY AND FORMS A TABLEAU.\n\nOur hero and his comrade climbed the precipice, and, after some minutes'\nsevere toil, arrived at the summit, when they sat down to recover\nthemselves.  The sky was clear, although the gale blew strong.  They had\nan extensive view of the coast, lashed by the angry waves.\n\n\"It's my opinion, Ned,\" said Jack, as he surveyed the expanse of\ntroubled water, \"that we're just as well out of that.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, Jack; but it's also my opinion that we should be just\nas well out of this, for the wind blows through one.  Suppose we go a\nlittle farther inland, where we may find some shelter till the morning.\"\n\n\"It's rather dark to find anything,\" rejoined our hero; \"but, however, a\nwesterly gale on the top of a mountain with wet clothes in the middle of\nthe night with nothing to eat or drink, is not the most comfortable\nposition in the world, and we may change for the better.\"\n\nThey proceed over a flat of a hundred yards, and then descended--the\nchange in the atmosphere was immediate.  As they continued their march\ninland, they came to a high-road, which appeared to run along the shore,\nand they turned into it; for, as Jack said very truly, a road must lead\nto something.  After a quarter of an hour's walk, they again heard the\nrolling of the surf, and perceived the white walls of houses.\n\n\"Here we are at last,\" said Jack.  \"I wonder if any one will turn out to\ntake us in, or shall we stow away for the night in one of those vessels\nhauled up on the beach?\"\n\n\"Recollect this time, Easy,\" said Gascoigne, \"not to show your money;\nthat is, show only a dollar, and say you have no more, or promise to pay\nwhen we arrive at Palermo; and if they will neither trust us, nor give\nto us, we must make it out as we can.\"\n\n\"How the cursed dogs bark!  I think we shall do very well this time,\nGascoigne: we do not look as if we were worth robbing, at all events,\nand we have the pistols to defend ourselves with if we are attacked.\nDepend upon it I will show no more gold.  And now let us make our\narrangements.  Take you one pistol, and take half the gold--I have it\nall in my right-hand pocket--my dollars and pistarenes in my left.  You\nshall take half of them too.  We have silver enough to go on with till\nwe are in a safe place.\"\n\nJack then divided the money in the dark, and also gave Gascoigne a\npistol.\n\n\"Now then, shall we knock for admittance?--Let's first walk through the\nvillage, and see if there's anything like an inn.  Those yelping curs\nwill soon be at our heels; they come nearer and nearer every time.\nThere's a cart, and it's full of straw--suppose we go to bed till\nto-morrow morning--we shall be warm, at all events.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Gascoigne, \"and sleep much better than in any of the\ncottages.  I have been in Sicily before, and you have no idea how the\nfleas bite.\"\n\nOur two midshipmen climbed up into the cart, nestled themselves into the\nstraw, or rather Indian corn-leaves, and were soon fast asleep.  As they\nhad not slept for two nights, it is not to be wondered at that they\nslept soundly--so soundly, indeed, that about two hours after they had\ngot into their comfortable bed, the peasant, who had brought to the\nvillage some casks of wine to be shipped and taken down the coast in a\nfelucca, yoked his bullocks, and not being aware of his freight, drove\noff without, in any way, disturbing their repose, although the roads in\nSicily are not yet macadamised.\n\nThe jolting of the roads rather increased than disturbed the sleep of\nour adventurers; and, although there were some rude shocks, it only had\nthe effect of making them fancy in their dreams that they were again in\nthe boat, and that she was still dashing against the rocks.  In about\ntwo hours, the cart arrived at its destination--the peasant unyoked his\nbullocks and led them away.  The same cause will often produce contrary\neffects: the stopping of the motion of the cart disturbed the rest of\nour two midshipmen; they turned round in the straw, yawned, spread out\ntheir arms, and then awoke.  Gascoigne, who felt considerable pain in\nhis shoulder, was the first to recall his scattered senses.\n\n\"Easy,\" cried he, as he sat up and shook off the corn-leaves.\n\n\"Port it is,\" said Jack, half dreaming.\n\n\"Come, Easy, you are not on board now.  Rouse and bitt.\"\n\nJack then sat up and looked at Gascoigne.  The forage in the cart was so\nhigh round them that they could not see above it; they rubbed their\neyes, yawned, and looked at each other.\n\n\"Have you any faith in dreams,\" said Jack to Gascoigne, \"because I had a\nvery queer one last night.\"\n\n\"Well, so had I,\" replied Gascoigne.  \"I dreamt that the cart rolled by\nitself into the sea, and went away with us right in the wind's eye back\nto Malta; and, considering that it never was built for such service, she\nbehaved uncommonly well.  Now what was your dream?\"\n\n\"Mine was, that we woke up and found ourselves in the very town from\nwhich the speronare had sailed, and that they had found the fore-part of\nthe speronare among the rocks, and recognised her, and picked up one of\nour pistols.  That they had laid hold of us, and had insisted that we\nhad been thrown on shore in the boat, and asked us what had become of\nthe crew--they were just seizing us, when I awoke.\"\n\n\"Your dream is more likely to come true than mine, Easy; but still I\nthink we need not fear that.  At the same time, we had better not remain\nhere any longer; and it occurs to me, that if we tore our clothes more,\nit would be advisable--we shall, in the first place, look more wretched;\nand, in the next place, can replace them with the dress of the country,\nand so travel without exciting suspicion.  You know that I can speak\nItalian pretty well.\"\n\n\"I have no objection to tear my clothes if you wish,\" replied Jack; \"at\nthe same time give me your pistol; I will draw the charges and load them\nagain.  They must be wet.\"\n\nHaving reloaded the pistols and rent their garments, the two midshipmen\nstood up in the cart and looked about them.\n\n\"Halloo!--why, how's this, Gascoigne? last night we were close to the\nbeach, and among houses, and now--where the devil are we?  You dreamt\nnearer the mark than I did, for the cart has certainly taken a cruise.\"\n\n\"We must have slept like midshipmen, then,\" replied Gascoigne: \"surely\nit cannot have gone far.\"\n\n\"Here we are, surrounded by hills on every side, for at least a couple\nof miles.  Surely some good genius has transported us into the interior,\nthat we might escape from the relatives of the crew whom I dreamt\nabout,\" said Jack, looking at Gascoigne.\n\nAs it afterwards was known to them, the speronare had sailed from the\nvery seaport in which they had arrived that night, and where they had\ngot into the cart.  The wreck of the speronare had been found, and had\nbeen recognised, and it was considered by the inhabitants that the\npadrone and his crew had perished in the gale.  Had they found our two\nmidshipmen and questioned them, it is not improbable that suspicion\nmight have been excited, and the results have been such as our hero had\nconjured up in his dream.  But, as we said before, there is a peculiar\nprovidence for midshipmen.\n\nOn a minute survey, they found that they were in an open space which,\napparently, had been used for thrashing and winnowing maize, and that\nthe cart was standing under a clump of trees in the shade.\n\n\"There ought to be a house hereabouts,\" said Gascoigne; \"I should think\nthat behind the trees we shall find one.  Come, Jack, you are as hungry\nas I am, I'll answer for it; we must look out for a breakfast\nsomewhere.\"\n\n\"If they won't give us something to eat, or sell it,\" replied Jack, who\nwas ravenous, clutching his pistol, \"I shall take it--I consider it no\nrobbery.  The fruits of the earth were made for us all, and it never was\nintended that one man should have a superfluity and another starve.  The\nlaws of equality--\"\n\n\"May appear very good arguments to a starving man, I grant, but still,\nwon't prevent his fellow creatures from hanging him,\" replied Gascoigne.\n\"None of your confounded nonsense, Jack; no man starves with money in\nhis pocket, and as long as you have that, leave those that have none to\ntalk about equality and the rights of man.\"\n\n\"I should like to argue that point with you, Gascoigne.\"\n\n\"Tell me, do you prefer sitting down here to argue, or to look out for\nsome breakfast, Jack?\"\n\n\"Oh, the argument may be put off, but hunger cannot.\"\n\n\"That's very good philosophy, Jack, so let's go on.\"\n\nThey went through the copse of wood, which was very thick, and soon\ndiscovered the wall of a large house on the other side.\n\n\"All right,\" said Jack; \"but still let us reconnoitre.  It's not a\nfarm-house; it must belong to a person of some consequence--all the\nbetter--they will see that we are gentlemen, notwithstanding our\ntattered dress.  I suppose we are to stick to the story of the sea-mews\nat Gozo?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Gascoigne; \"I can think of nothing better.  But the\nEnglish are well received in this island; we have troops at Palermo.\"\n\n\"Have we?  I wish I was sitting down at the mess-table--but what's that?\na woman screaming?--Yes, by heavens!--come along, Ned.\"  And away dashed\nJack towards the house, followed by Gascoigne.  As they advanced the\nscreams redoubled; they entered the porch, burst into the room from\nwhence they proceeded, and found an elderly gentleman defending himself\nagainst two young men, who were held back by an elderly and a young\nlady.  Our hero and his comrade had both drawn their pistols, and just\nas they burst open the door, the old gentleman who defended himself\nagainst such odds had fallen down.  The two others burst from the women,\nand were about to pierce him with their swords, when Jack seized one by\nthe collar of his coat and held him fast, pointing the muzzle of the\npistol to his ear: Gascoigne did the same to the other.  It was a very\ndramatic tableau.  The two women flew to the elderly gentleman and\nraised him up; the two assailants being held just as dogs hold pigs by\nthe ear, trembling with fright, with the points of their rapiers\ndropped, looked at the midshipmen and the muzzles of their pistols with\nequal dismay; at the same time, the astonishment of the elderly\ngentleman and the women, at such an unexpected deliverance, was equally\ngreat.  There was a silence for a few seconds.\n\n\"Ned,\" at last said Jack, \"tell these chaps to drop their swords, or we\nfire.\"\n\nGascoigne gave the order in Italian, and it was complied with.  The\nmidshipmen then possessed themselves of the rapiers, and gave the young\nmen their liberty.\n\nThe elderly gentleman at last broke the silence.\n\n\"It would appear, signors, that there was an especial interference of\nProvidence, to prevent you from committing a foul and unjust murder.\nWho these are that have so opportunely come to my rescue, I know not,\nbut thanking them as I do now, I think that you will yourselves, when\nyou are calm, also thank them for having prevented you from committing\nan act which would have loaded you with remorse and embittered your\nfuture existence.  Gentlemen, you are free to depart: you, Don Silvio,\nhave indeed disappointed me; your gratitude should have rendered you\nincapable of such conduct: as for you, Don Scipio, you have been misled;\nbut you both have, in one point, disgraced yourselves.  Ten days back my\nsons were both here--why did you not come then?  If you sought revenge\non me, you could not have inflicted it deeper than through my children,\nand at least you would not have acted the part of assassins in attacking\nan old man.  Take your swords, gentlemen, and use them better\nhenceforth.  Against future attacks I shall be well prepared.\"\n\nGascoigne, who perfectly understood what was said, presented the sword\nto the young gentleman from whom he had taken it--our hero did the same.\nThe two young men returned them to their sheaths, and quitted the room\nwithout saying a word.\n\n\"Whoever you are, I owe to you and thank you for my life,\" said the\nelderly gentleman, scanning the outward appearance of our two\nmidshipmen.\n\n\"We are,\" said Gascoigne, \"officers in the English navy, and gentlemen;\nwe were wrecked in our boat last night, and have wandered here in the\ndark, seeking for assistance, and food, and some conveyance to Palermo,\nwhere we shall find friends, and the means of appearing like gentlemen.\"\n\n\"Was your ship wrecked, gentlemen?\" inquired the Sicilian, \"and many\nlives lost?\"\n\n\"No, our ship is at Malta; we were in a boat on a party of pleasure,\nwere caught by a gale, and driven on the coast.  To satisfy you of the\ntruth, observe that our pistols have the king's mark, and that we are\nnot paupers, we show you gold.\"\n\nGascoigne pulled out his doubloons--and Jack did the same, coolly\nobserving:\n\n\"I thought we were only to show silver, Ned!\"\n\n\"It needed not that,\" replied the gentleman; \"your conduct in this\naffair, your manners and address, fully convince me that you are what\nyou represent--but were you common peasants, I am equally indebted to\nyou for my life, and you may command me.  Tell me in what way I can be\nof service.\"\n\n\"In giving us something to eat, for we have had nothing for many, many\nhours.  After that we may, perhaps, trespass a little more upon your\nkind offices.\"\n\n\"You must, of course, be surprised at what has passed, and curious to\nknow the occasion,\" said the gentleman; \"you have a right to be informed\nof it, and shall be, as soon as you are more comfortable; in the\nmeantime, allow me to introduce myself as Don Rebiera de Silva.\"\n\n\"I wish,\" said Jack, who, from his knowledge of Spanish, could\nunderstand the whole of the last part of the Don's speech, \"that he\nwould introduce us to his breakfast.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" said Gascoigne; \"but we must wait a little--he ordered the\nladies to prepare something instantly.\"\n\n\"Your friend does not speak Italian,\" said Don Rebiera.\n\n\"No, Don Rebiera, he speaks French and Spanish.\"\n\n\"If he speaks Spanish my daughter can converse with him; she has but\nshortly arrived from Spain.  We are closely united with a noble house in\nthat country.\"\n\nDon Rebiera then led the way to another room, and in a short time there\nwas a repast brought in, to which our midshipmen did great justice.\n\n\"I will now,\" said the Don, \"relate to you, sir, for the information of\nyourself and friend, the causes which produced this scene of violence,\nwhich you so opportunely defeated.  But first, as it must be very\ntedious to your friend, I will send for Donna Clara and my daughter\nAgnes to talk to him; my wife understands a little Spanish, and my\ndaughter, as I said before, has but just left the country, where, from\ncircumstances, she remained some years.\"\n\nAs soon as Donna Clara and Donna Agnes made their appearance and were\nintroduced, Jack, who had not before paid attention to them, said to\nhimself, \"I have seen a face like that girl's before.\"  If so, he had\nnever seen many like it, for it was the quintessence of brunette beauty,\nand her figure was equally perfect; although, not having yet completed\nher fifteenth year, it required still a little more development.\n\nDonna Clara was extremely gracious, and as, perhaps, she was aware that\nher voice would drown that of her husband, she proposed to our hero to\nwalk in the garden, and in a few minutes they took their seats in a\npavilion at the end of it.  The old lady did not talk much Spanish, but\nwhen at a loss for a word she put in an Italian one, and Jack understood\nher perfectly well.  She told him her sister had married a Spanish\nnobleman many years since, and that before the war broke out between the\nSpanish and the English, they had gone over with all their children to\nsee her; that when they wished to return, her daughter Agnes, then a\nchild, was suffering under a lingering complaint, and it was thought\nadvisable, as she was very weak, to leave her under the charge of her\naunt, who had a little girl of nearly the same age; that they were\neducated together at a convent near Tarragona, and that she had only\nreturned two months ago; that she had a very narrow escape, as the ship\nin which her uncle, and aunt, and cousins, as well as herself, were on\nboard, returning from Genoa, where her brother-in-law had been obliged\nto go to secure a succession to some property bequeathed to him, had\nbeen captured in the night by the English; but the officer, who was very\npolite, had allowed them to go away next day, and very handsomely\npermitted them to take all their effects.\n\n\"Oh, oh,\" thought Jack; \"I thought I had seen her face before; this then\nwas one of the girls in the corner of the cabin--now, I'll have some\nfun.\"\n\nDuring the conversation with the mother, Donna Agnes had remained some\npaces behind, picking now and then a flower, and not attending to what\npassed.\n\nWhen our hero and her mother sat down in the pavilion she joined them,\nwhen Jack addressed her with his usual politeness.\n\n\"I am almost ashamed to be sitting by you, Donna Agnes, in this ragged\ndress--but the rocks of your coast have no respect for persons.\"\n\n\"We are under great obligations, signor, and do not regard such\ntrifles.\"\n\n\"You are all kindness, signora,\" replied Jack; \"I little thought this\nmorning of my good fortune--I can tell the fortunes of others, but not\nof my own.\"\n\n\"You can tell fortunes!\" replied the old lady.\n\n\"Yes, madam, I am famous for it--shall I tell your daughter hers?\"\n\nDonna Agnes looked at our hero, and smiled.\n\n\"I perceive that the young lady does not believe me; I must prove my\nart, by telling her of what has already happened to her.  The signora\nwill then give me credit.\"\n\n\"Certainly, if you do that,\" replied Agnes.\n\n\"Oblige me, by showing me the palm of your hand.\"\n\nAgnes extended her little hand, and Jack felt so very polite, that he\nwas nearly kissing it.  However, he restrained himself, and examining\nthe lines:\n\n\"That you were educated in Spain--that you arrived here but two months\nago--that you were captured and released by the English, your mother has\nalready told me; but to prove to you that I knew all that, I must now be\nmore particular.  You were in a ship mounting fourteen guns--was it not\nso?\"\n\nDonna Agnes nodded her head.\n\n\"I never told the signor that,\" cried Donna Clara.  \"She was taken by\nsurprise in the night, and there was no fighting.  The next morning the\nEnglish burst open the cabin door; your uncle and your cousin fired\ntheir pistols.\"\n\n\"Holy Virgin!\" cried Agnes, with surprise.\n\n\"The English officer was a young man, not very good-looking.\"\n\n\"There you are wrong, signor; he was very handsome.\"\n\n\"There is no accounting for taste, signora; you were frightened out of\nyour wits, and with your cousin you crouched down in the corner of the\ncabin.  Let me examine that little line closer--you had--yes, it's no\nmistake, you had very little clothes on.\"\n\nAgnes tore away her hand and covered her face.\n\n\"E vero, e vero; Holy Jesus! how could you know that?\"\n\nOf a sudden Agnes looked at our hero, and after a minute appeared to\nrecognise him.\n\n\"Oh, mother, 'tis he--I recollect now, 'tis he!\"\n\n\"Who, my child?\" replied Donna Clara, who had been struck dumb with\nJack's astonishing power of fortune-telling.\n\n\"The officer who captured us, and was so kind.\"\n\nJack burst out into laughter, not to be controlled for some minutes, an\nthen acknowledged that she had discovered him.\n\n\"At all events, Donna Agnes,\" said he at last, \"acknowledge that, ragged\nas I am, I have seen you in a much greater deshabille.\"\n\nAgnes sprang up and took to her heels, that she might hide her\nconfusion, and at the same time go to her father and tell him who he had\nas his guest.\n\nAlthough Don Rebiera had not yet finished his narrative, this\nannouncement of Agnes, who ran in breathless to communicate it,\nimmediately brought all the parties together, and Jack received their\nthanks.\n\n\"I little thought,\" said the Don, \"that I should have been so doubly\nindebted to you, sir.  Command my services as you please, both of you.\nMy sons are at Palermo, and I trust you will allow them the pleasure of\nyour friendship when you are tired of remaining with us.\"\n\nJack made his politest bow, and then with a shrug of his shoulders,\nlooked down upon his habiliments, which, to please Gascoigne, he had\ntorn into ribands, as much as to say, We are not provided for a\nlengthened stay.\n\n\"My brothers' clothes will fit them, I think,\" said Agnes to her father;\n\"they have left plenty in their wardrobes.\"\n\n\"If the signors will condescend to wear them till they can replace their\nown.\"\n\nMidshipmen are very condescending--they followed Don Rebiera, and\ncondescended to put on clean shirts belonging to Don Philip and Don\nMartin; also to put on their trousers--to select their best waistcoats\nand coats--in short, they condescended to have a regular fit-out--and it\nso happened that the fit-out was not far from a regular _fit_.\n\nHaving condescended, they then descended, and the intimacy between all\nparties became so great that it appeared as if they not only wore the\nyoung men's clothes, but also stood in their shoes.  Having thus made\nthemselves presentable, Jack presented his hand to both ladies, and led\nthem into the garden, that Don Rebiera might finish his long story to\nGascoigne without further interruption, and resuming their seats in the\npavilion, he entertained the ladies with a history of his cruise in the\nship after her capture.  Agnes soon recovered from her reserve, and Jack\nhad the forbearance not to allude again to the scene in the cabin, which\nwas the only thing she dreaded.  After dinner, when the family,\naccording to custom, had retired for the siesta, Gascoigne and Jack, who\nhad slept enough in the cart to last for a week, went out together in\nthe garden.\n\n\"Well, Ned,\" said Jack, \"do you wish yourself on board the _Harpy_\nagain?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Gascoigne; \"we have fallen on our feet at last, but still\nnot without first being knocked about like peas in a rattle.  What a\nlovely little creature that Agnes is!  How strange that you should fall\nin with her again!  How odd that we should come here!\"\n\n\"My good fellow, we did not come here.  Destiny brought us in a cart.\nShe may take us to Tyburn in the same way.\"\n\n\"Yes, if you sport your philosophy as you did when we awoke this\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, I'll be hanged if I'm not right.  Suppose we argue the\npoint?\"\n\n\"Right or wrong, you will be hanged, Jack; so instead of arguing the\npoint, suppose I tell you what the Don made such a long story about.\"\n\n\"With all my heart; let us go to the pavilion.\"\n\nOur hero and his friend took their seats, and Gascoigne then\ncommunicated the history of Don Rebiera, to which we shall dedicate the\nensuing chapter.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\n\nA LONG STORY, WHICH THE READER MUST LISTEN TO, AS WELL AS OUR HERO.\n\n\"I have already made you acquainted with my name, and I have only to\nadd, that it is one of the most noble in Sicily, and that there are few\nfamilies who possess such large estates.  My father was a man who had no\npleasure in the pursuits of most young men of his age; he was of a\nweakly constitution, and was with difficulty reared to manhood.  When\nhis studies were completed he retired to his country-seat, belonging to\nour family, which is about twenty miles from Palermo, and shutting\nhimself up, devoted himself wholly to literary pursuits.\n\n\"As he was an only son, his parents were naturally very anxious that he\nshould marry; the more so as his health did not promise him a very\nextended existence.  Had he consulted his own inclinations he would have\ndeclined, but he felt that it was his duty to comply with their wishes;\nbut he did not trouble himself with the choice, leaving it wholly to\nthem.  They selected a young lady of high family, and certainly of most\nexquisite beauty.  I only wish I could say more in her favour, for she\nwas my mother; but it is impossible to narrate the history without\nexposing her conduct.  The marriage took place, and my father, having\nwoke up as it were at the celebration, again returned to his closet, to\noccupy himself with abstruse studies; the results of which have been\npublished, and have fully established his reputation as a man of\nsuperior talent and deep research.  But, however much the public may\nappreciate the works of a man of genius, whether they be written to\ninstruct or to amuse, certain it is that a literary man requires, in his\nwife, either a mind congenial to his own, or that pride in her husband's\ntalents which induces her to sacrifice much of her own domestic\nenjoyment to the satisfaction of having his name extolled abroad.  I\nmention this point as some extenuation of my mother's conduct.  She was\nneglected most certainly, but not neglected for frivolous amusements, or\nbecause another form had more captivated his fancy; but, in his desire\nto instruct others, and I may add, his ambition for renown, he applied\nhimself to his literary pursuits, became abstracted, answered without\nhearing, and left his wife to amuse herself in any way she might please.\nA literary husband is, without exception, although always at home, the\nleast domestic husband in the world, and must try the best of tempers,\nnot by unkindness, for my father was kind and indulgent to excess, but\nby that state of perfect abstraction and indifference which he showed to\neverything except the favourite pursuit which absorbed him.  My mother\nhad but to speak, and every wish was granted--a refusal was unknown.\nYou may say, what could she want more; I reply, that anything to a woman\nis preferable to indifference.  The immediate consent to every wish took\naway, in her opinion, all merit in the grant; the value of everything is\nonly relative, and in proportion to the difficulty of obtaining it.  The\nimmediate assent to every opinion was tantamount to insult; it implied\nthat he did not choose to argue with her.\n\n\"It is true that women like to have their own way; but they like, at the\nsame time, to have difficulties to surmount and to conquer; otherwise,\nhalf the gratification is lost.  Although tempests are to be deplored,\nstill a certain degree of oscillation and motion are requisite to keep\nfresh and clear the lake of matrimony, the waters of which otherwise\nsoon stagnate and become foul, and without some contrary currents of\nopinion between a married couple such a stagnation must take place.\n\n\"A woman permitted always and invariably to have her own way without\ncontrol, is much in the same situation as the child who insists upon a\nwhole instead of half a holiday, and before the evening closes is tired\nof himself and everything about him.  In short, a little contradiction,\nlike salt at dinner, seasons and appetises the repast; but too much,\nlike the condiment in question, spoils the whole, and it becomes\nunpalatable in proportion to its excess.\n\n\"My mother was a vain woman in every sense of the word--vain of her\nbirth and of her beauty, and accustomed to receive that homage to which\nshe considered herself entitled.  She had been spoiled in her infancy,\nand as she grew up had learned nothing, because she was permitted to do\nas she pleased; she was therefore frivolous, and could not appreciate\nwhat she could not comprehend.  There never was a more ill-assorted\nunion.\"\n\n\"I have always thought that such must be the case,\" replied Gascoigne,\n\"in Catholic countries, where a young person is taken out of a convent\nand mated according to what her family or her wealth may consider as the\nmost eligible connection.\"\n\n\"On that subject there are many opinions, my friend,\" replied Don\nRebiera.  \"It is true, that when a marriage of convenience is arranged\nby the parents, the dispositions of the parties are made a secondary\npoint; but then, again, it must be remembered, that when a choice is\nleft to the parties themselves, it is at an age at which there is little\nworldly consideration: and, led away, in the first place, by their\npassions, they form connections with those inferior in their station,\nwhich are attended with eventual unhappiness; or, in the other, allowing\nthat they do choose in their own rank of life, they make quite as bad or\noften a worse choice than if their partners were selected for them.\"\n\n\"I cannot understand that,\" replied Gascoigne.\n\n\"The reason is, because there are no means, or if means, no wish, to\nstudy each other's disposition.  A young man is attracted by person, and\nhe admires; the young woman is flattered by the admiration, and is\nagreeable; if she has any faults she is not likely to display them--not\nconcealing them from hypocrisy, but because they are not called out.\nThe young man falls in love, so does the young woman; and when once in\nlove, they can no longer see faults; they marry, imagining that they\nhave found perfection.  In the blindness of love, each raises the other\nto a standard of perfection which human nature can never attain, and\neach becomes equally annoyed on finding, by degrees, that they were in\nerror.  The reaction takes place, and they then underrate, as much as\nbefore they had overrated, each other.  Now, if two young people marry\nwithout this violence of passion, they do not expect to find each other\nperfect, and perhaps have a better chance of happiness.\"\n\n\"I don't agree with you,\" thought Gascoigne; \"but as you appear to be as\nfond of argument as my friend Jack, I shall make no reply, lest there he\nno end to the story.\"\n\nDon Rebiera proceeded.\n\n\"My mother, finding that my father preferred his closet and his books to\ngaiety and dissipation, soon left him to himself, and amused herself\nafter her own fashion, but not until I was born, which was ten months\nafter their marriage.  My father was confiding, and, pleased that my\nmother should be amused, he indulged her in everything.  Time flew on,\nand I had arrived at my fifteenth year, and came home from my studies,\nit being intended that I should enter the army, which you are aware is\ngenerally the only profession embraced in this country by the heirs of\nnoble families.  Of course, I knew little of what had passed at home,\nbut still I had occasionally heard my mother spoken lightly of, when I\nwas not supposed to be present, and I always heard my father's name\nmentioned with compassion, as if an ill-used man, but I knew nothing\nmore: still this was quite sufficient for a young man, whose blood\nboiled at the idea of anything like a stigma being cast upon his family.\nI arrived at my father's--I found him at his books; I paid my respects\nto my mother--I found her with her confessor.  I disliked the man at\nfirst sight; he was handsome, certainly: his forehead was high and\nwhite, his eyes large and fiery, and his figure commanding; but there\nwas a dangerous, proud look about him which disgusted me--nothing like\nhumility or devotion.  I might have admired him as an officer commanding\na regiment of cavalry, but as a churchman he appeared to be most\nmisplaced.  She named me with kindness, but he appeared to treat me with\ndisdain; he spoke authoritatively to my mother, who appeared to yield\nimplicitly, and I discovered that he was lord of the whole household.\nMy mother, too, it was said, had given up gaieties and become devout.  I\nsoon perceived more than a common intelligence between them, and before\nI had been two months at home I had certain proofs of my father's\ndishonour; and what was still more unfortunate for me, they were aware\nthat such was the case.  My first impulse was to acquaint my father;\nbut, on consideration, I thought it better to say nothing, provided I\ncould persuade my mother to dismiss Father Ignatio.  I took an\nopportunity when she was alone to express my indignation at her conduct,\nand to demand his immediate dismissal, as a condition of my not\ndivulging her crime.  She appeared frightened, and gave her consent; but\nI soon found that her confessor had more power with her than I had, and\nhe remained.  I now resolved to acquaint my father, and I roused him\nfrom his studies that he might listen to his shame.  I imagined that he\nwould have acted calmly and discreetly; but, on the contrary, his\nviolence was without bounds, and I had the greatest difficulty from\npreventing his rushing with his sword to sacrifice them both.  At last\nhe contented himself by turning Father Ignatio out of the house in the\nmost ignominious manner, and desiring my mother to prepare for seclusion\nin a convent for the remainder of her days.  But he fell their victim;\nthree days afterwards, as my mother was, by his directions, about to be\nremoved, he was seized with convulsions and died.  I need hardly say,\nthat he was carried off by poison; this, however, could not be\nestablished till long afterwards.  Before he died he seemed to be almost\nsupernaturally prepared for an event which never came into my thoughts.\nHe sent for another confessor, who drew up his confession in writing at\nhis own request, and afterwards inserted it in his will.  My mother\nremained in the house, and Father Ignatio had the insolence to return.\nI ordered him away, and he resisted.  He was turned out by the servants.\nI had an interview with my mother, who defied me, and told me that I\nshould soon have a brother to share in the succession.  I felt that, if\nso, it would be the illegitimate progeny of her adultery, and told her\nmy opinion.  She expressed her rage in the bitterest curses, and I left\nher.  Shortly afterwards she quitted the house and retired to another of\nour country-seats, where she lived with Father Ignatio as before.  About\nfour months afterwards, formal notice was sent to me of the birth of a\nbrother; but as, when my father's will was opened, he there had inserted\nhis confession, or the substance of it, in which he stated, that aware\nof my mother's guilt, and supposing that consequences might ensue, he\nsolemnly declared before God that he had for years lived apart, I cared\nlittle for this communication.  I contented myself with replying that as\nthe child belonged to the church, it had better be dedicated to its\nservice.\n\n\"I had, however, soon reason to acknowledge the vengeance of my mother\nand her paramour.  One night I was attacked by bravos; and had I not\nfortunately received assistance, I should have forfeited my life; as it\nwas, I received a severe wound.\n\n\"Against attempts of that kind I took every precaution in future, but\nstill every attempt was made to ruin my character, as well as to take my\nlife.  A young sister disappeared from a convent in my neighbourhood,\nand on the ground near the window from which she descended, was found a\nhat, recognised to be mine.  I was proceeded against, and\nnotwithstanding the strongest interest, it was with difficulty that the\naffair was arranged, although I had incontestably proved an _alibi_.\n\n\"A young man of rank was found murdered, with a stiletto, known to be\nmine, buried in his bosom, and it was with difficulty that I could\nestablish my innocence.\n\n\"Part of a banditti had been seized, and on being asked the name of\ntheir chief, when they received absolution, they confessed that I was\nthe chief of the band.\n\n\"Everything that could be attempted was put into practice; and if I did\nnot lose my life, at all events I was avoided by almost everybody as a\ndangerous and doubtful character.\n\n\"At last a nobleman of rank, the father of Don Scipio, whom you\ndisarmed, was assassinated; the bravos were taken, and they acknowledged\nthat I was the person who hired them.  I defended myself, but the king\nimposed upon me a heavy fine and banishment.  I had just received the\norder, and was crying out against the injustice, and lamenting my hard\nfate, as I sat down to dinner.  Latterly, aware of what my enemies would\nattempt, I had been accustomed to live much alone.  My faithful valet\nPedro was my only attendant.  I was eating my dinner with little\nappetite, and had asked for some wine.  Pedro went to the beaufet behind\nhim, to give me what I required.  Accidentally I lifted up my head, and\nthere being a large pier-glass opposite to me, I saw the figure of my\nvalet, and that he was pouring a powder in the flagon of wine which he\nwas about to present to me.  I recollected the hat being found at the\nnunnery, and also the stiletto in the body of the young man.\n\n\"Like lightning it occurred to me that I had been fostering the viper\nwho had assisted to destroy me.  He brought me the flagon.  I rose,\nlocked the door, and drawing my sword, I addressed him:--\n\n\"`Villain; I know thee; down on your knees, for your life is forfeited.'\n\n\"He turned pale, trembled, and sank upon his knees.\n\n\"`Now, then,' continued I, `you have but one chance--either drink off\nthis flagon of wine, or I pass my sword through your body.'  He\nhesitated, and I put the point to his breast--even pierced the flesh a\nquarter of an inch.\n\n\"`Drink,' cried I--`is it so very unjust an order to tell you to drink\nold wine?  Drink,' continued I, `or my sword does its duty.'\n\n\"He drank, and would then have quitted the room.  `No, no,' said I, `you\nremain herd, and the wine must have its effect.  If I have wronged you I\nwill make amends to you--but I am suspicious.'\n\n\"In about a quarter of an hour, during which time I paced up and down\nthe room, with my sword drawn, my servant fell down, and cried in mercy\nto let him have a priest.  I sent for my own confessor, and he then\nacknowledged that he was an agent of my mother and Father Ignatio, and\nhad been the means of making it appear that I was the committer of all\nthe crimes and murders which had been perpetrated by them, with a view\nto my destruction.  A strong emetic having been administered to him, he\npartially revived, and was taken to Palermo, where he gave his evidence\nbefore he expired.\n\n\"When this was made known, the king revoked his sentence, apologised to\nme, and I found that once more I was visited and courted by everybody.\nMy mother was ordered to be shut up in a convent, where she died, I\ntrust, in grace, and Father Ignatio fled to Italy, and I have been\ninformed is since dead.\n\n\"Having thus rid myself of my principal enemies, I considered myself\nsafe.  I married the lady whom you have just seen, and before my eldest\nson was born, Don Silvio, for such was the name given to my asserted\nlegitimate brother, came of age, and demanded his succession.  Had he\nasked me for a proper support, as my uterine brother, I should not have\nrefused; but that the son of Friar Ignatio, who had so often attempted\nmy life, should, in case of my decease, succeed to the title and\nestates, was not to be borne.  A lawsuit was immediately commenced,\nwhich lasted four or five years, during which Don Silvio married, and\nhad a son, that young man whom you heard me address by the same name;\nbut after much litigation, it was decided that my father's confessor and\nwill had proved his illegitimacy, and the suit was in my favour.  From\nthat time to this there has been a constant enmity.  Don Silvio refused\nall my offers of assistance, and followed me with a pertinacity which\noften endangered my life.  At last he fell by the hands of his own\nagents, who mistook him for me.  Don Silvio died without leaving any\nprovision for his family; his widow I pensioned, and his son I have had\ncarefully brought up, and have indeed treated most liberally, but he\nappears to have imbibed the spirit of his father, and no kindness has\nbeen able to imbue him with gratitude.\n\n\"He had lately been placed by me in the army, where he found out my two\nsons, and quarrelled with them both upon slight pretence; but, in both\ninstances, he was wounded and carried off the field.\n\n\"My two sons have been staying with me these last two months, and did\nnot leave till yesterday.  This morning Don Silvio, accompanied by Don\nScipio, came to the house, and after accusing me of being the murderer\nof both their parents, drew their rapiers to assassinate me.  My wife\nand child, hearing the noise, came down to my assistance--you know the\nrest.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY ONE.\n\nIN WHICH OUR HERO IS BROUGHT UP ALL STANDING UNDER A PRESS OF SAIL.\n\nOur limits will not permit us to relate all that passed during our\nhero's stay of a fortnight at Don Rebiera's.  He and Gascoigne were\ntreated as if they were his own sons, and the kindness of the female\npart of the family was equally remarkable.  Agnes, naturally perhaps,\nshowed a preference or partiality for Jack: to which Gascoigne willingly\nsubmitted, as he felt that our hero had a prior and stronger claim, and\nduring the time that they remained a feeling of attachment was created\nbetween Agnes and the philosopher, which, if not love, was at least\nsomething very near akin to it; but the fact was, that they were both\nmuch too young to think of marriage; and, although they walked and\ntalked, and laughed, and played together, they were always at home in\ntime for their dinner.  Still, the young lady thought she preferred our\nhero even to her brothers, and Jack thought that the young lady was the\nprettiest and kindest girl that he had ever met with.  At the end of the\nfortnight our two midshipmen took their leave, furnished with letters of\nrecommendation to many of the first nobility in Palermo, and mounted on\ntwo fine mules with bell bridles.  The old Donna kissed them both--the\nDon showered down his blessings of good wishes, and Donna Agnes's lips\ntrembled as she bade them adieu; and, as soon as they were gone, she\nwent up to her chamber and wept.  Jack also was very grave, and his eyes\nmoistened at the thoughts of leaving Agnes.  Neither of them were aware,\nuntil the hour of parting, how much they had wound themselves together.\n\nThe first quarter of an hour our two midshipmen followed their guide in\nsilence.  Jack wished to be left to his own thoughts, and Gascoigne\nperceived it.\n\n\"Well, Easy,\" said Gascoigne, at last, \"if I had been in your place,\nconstantly in company of, and loved by, that charming girl, I could\nnever have torn myself away.\"\n\n\"Loved by her, Ned!\" replied Jack; \"what makes you say that?\"\n\n\"Because I am sure it was the case; she lived but in your presence.\nWhy, if you were out of the room, she never spoke a word, but sat there\nas melancholy as a sick monkey--the moment you came in again she beamed\nout as glorious as the sun, and was all life and spirit.\"\n\n\"I thought people were always melancholy when they were in love,\"\nreplied Jack.\n\n\"When those that they love are out of their presence.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I am out of her presence, and I feel very melancholy, so I\nsuppose, by your argument, I am in love.  Can a man be in love without\nknowing it?\"\n\n\"I really cannot say, Jack, I never was in love myself, but I've seen\nmany others _spooney_.  My time will come, I suppose, by-and-bye.  They\nsay that for every man made there is a woman also made to fit him, if he\ncould only find her.  Now, it's my opinion that you have found yours--\nI'll lay my life she's crying at this moment.\"\n\n\"Do you really think so, Ned? let's go back--poor little Agnes--let's go\nback; I feel I do love her, and I'll tell her so.\"\n\n\"Pooh, nonsense! it's too late now; you should have told her that\nbefore, when you walked with her in the garden.\"\n\n\"But I did not know it, Ned.  However, as you say, it would be foolish\nto turn back, so I'll write to her from Palermo.\"\n\nHere an argument ensued upon love, which we shall not trouble the reader\nwith, as it was not very profound, both sides knowing very little on the\nsubject.  It did, however, end with our hero being convinced that he was\ndesperately in love, and he talked about giving up the service as soon\nas he arrived at Malta.  It is astonishing what sacrifices midshipmen\nwill make for the objects of their adoration.\n\nIt was not until late in the evening that our adventurers arrived at\nPalermo.  As soon as they were lodged at the hotel, Gascoigne sat down\nand wrote a letter in their joint names to Don Rebiera, returning him\nmany thanks for his great kindness, informing him of their safe arrival,\nand trusting that they should soon meet again: and Jack took up his pen,\nand indited a letter in Spanish to Agnes, in which he swore that neither\ntide nor time, nor water, nor air, nor heaven, nor earth, nor the first\nlieutenant, nor his father, nor absence, nor death itself, should\nprevent him from coming back and marrying her, the first convenient\nopportunity, begging her to refuse a thousand offers, as come back he\nwould, although there was no saying when.  It was a perfect love-letter,\nthat is to say, it was the essence of nonsense, but that made it\nperfect, for the greater the love the greater the folly.\n\nThese letters were consigned to the man who was sent as their guide, and\nalso had to return with the mules.  He was liberally rewarded; and, as\nJack told him to be very careful of his letter, the Italian naturally\nconcluded that it was to be delivered clandestinely, and he delivered it\naccordingly, at a time when Agnes was walking in the garden thinking of\nour hero.  Nothing was more opportune than the arrival of the letter;\nAgnes ran to the pavilion, read it over twenty times, kissed it twenty\ntimes, and hid it in her bosom; sat for a few minutes in deep and placid\nthought, took the letter out of its receptacle, and read it over and\nover again.  It was very bad Spanish and very absurd, but she thought it\ndelightful, poetical, classical, sentimental, argumentative, convincing,\nincontrovertible, imaginative, and even grammatical, for if it was not\ngood Spanish, there was no Spanish half so good.  Alas!  Agnes was,\nindeed, unsophisticated, to be in such ecstasies with a midshipman's\nlove-letter.  Once more she hastened to her room to weep, but it was\nfrom excess of joy and delight.  The reader may think Agnes silly, but\nhe must take into consideration the climate, and that she was not yet\nfifteen.\n\nOur young gentlemen sent for a tailor and each ordered a new suit of\nclothes; they delivered their letters of recommendation, and went to the\nbanker to whom they were addressed by Don Rebiera.\n\n\"I shall draw for ten pounds, Jack,\" said Gascoigne, \"on the strength of\nthe shipwreck; I shall tell the truth, all except that we forgot to ask\nfor leave, which I shall leave out; and I am sure the story will be\nworth ten pounds.  What shall you draw for, Jack?\"\n\n\"I shall draw for two hundred pounds,\" replied Jack; \"I mean to have a\ngood cruise while I can.\"\n\n\"But will your governor stand that, Easy?\"\n\n\"To be sure he will.\"\n\n\"Then you're right--he is a philosopher--I wish he'd teach mine, for he\nhates the sight of a bill.\"\n\n\"Then don't you draw, Ned--I have plenty for both.  If every man had his\nequal share and rights in the world, you would be as able to draw as\nmuch as I; and, as you cannot, upon the principles of equality, you\nshall have half.\"\n\n\"I really shall become a convert to your philosophy, Jack; it does not\nappear to be so nonsensical as I thought it.  At all events it has saved\nmy old governor ten pounds, which he can ill afford, as a colonel on\nhalf-pay.\"\n\nOn their return to the inn, they found Don Philip and Don Martin, to\nwhom Don Rebiera had written, who welcomed them with open arms.  They\nwere two very fine young men of eighteen and nineteen, who were\nfinishing their education in the army.  Jack asked them to dinner, and\nthey and our hero soon became inseparable.  They took him to all the\ntheatres, the conversaziones of all the nobility, and, as Jack lost his\nmoney with good humour, and was a very handsome fellow, he was\neverywhere well received and was made much of: many ladies made love to\nhim, but Jack was only very polite, because he thought more and more of\nAgnes every day.  Three weeks passed away like lightning, and neither\nJack nor Gascoigne thought of going back.  At last, one fine day, H.M.\nfrigate _Aurora_ anchored in the bay, and Jack and Gascoigne, who were\nat a party at the Duke of Pentaro's, met with the captain of the\n_Aurora_, who was also invited.  The duchess introduced them to Captain\nTartar, who, imagining them, from their being in plain clothes, to be\nyoung Englishmen of fortune on their travels, was very gracious and\ncondescending.  Jack was so pleased with his urbanity that he requested\nthe pleasure of his company to dinner the next day: Captain Tartar\naccepted the invitation, and they parted, shaking hands, with many\nexpressions of pleasure in having made his acquaintance.  Jack's party\nwas rather large, and the dinner sumptuous.  The Sicilian gentlemen did\nnot drink much wine, but Captain Tartar liked his bottle, and although\nthe rest of the company quitted the table to go to a ball given that\nevening by the Marquesa Novara, Jack was too polite not to sit it out\nwith the captain: Gascoigne closed his chair to Jack's, who, he was\nafraid, being a little affected with the wine, would \"let the cat out of\nthe bag.\"\n\nThe captain was amazingly entertaining.  Jack told him how happy he\nshould be to see him at Forest Hill, which property the captain\ndiscovered to contain six thousand acres of land, and also that Jack was\nan only son; and Captain Tartar was quite respectful when he found that\nhe was in such very excellent company.  The captain of the frigate\ninquired of Jack what brought him out here, and Jack, whose prudence was\ndeparting, told him that he came in his Majesty's ship _Harpy_.\nGascoigne gave Jack a nudge, but was of no use, for as the wine got into\nJack's brain, so did his notions of equality.\n\n\"Oh!  Wilson gave you a passage; he's an old friend of mine.\"\n\n\"So he is of ours,\" replied Jack; \"he's a devilish good sort of a\nfellow, Wilson.\"\n\n\"But where have you been since you came out?\" inquired Captain Tartar.\n\n\"In the _Harpy_,\" replied Jack, \"to be sure, I belong to her.\"\n\n\"You belong to her! in what capacity may I ask?\" inquired Captain\nTartar, in a much less respectful and confidential tone.\n\n\"Midshipman,\" replied Jack; \"so is Mr Gascoigne.\"\n\n\"Umph! you are on leave then.\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" replied Jack; \"I'll tell you how it is, my dear fellow.\"\n\n\"Excuse me for one moment,\" replied Captain Tartar, rising up; \"I must\ngive some directions to my servant which I forgot.\"\n\nCaptain Tartar hailed his coxswain out of the window, gave orders just\noutside of the door, and then returned to the table.  In the meantime,\nGascoigne, who expected a breeze, had been cautioning Jack, in a low\ntone, at intervals, when Captain Tartar's back was turned; but it was\nuseless, the extra quantity of wine had got into Jack's head, and he\ncared nothing for Gascoigne's remonstrance.  When the captain resumed\nhis seat at the table, Jack gave him the true narrative of all that had\npassed, to which his guest paid the greatest attention.  Jack wound up\nhis confidence by saying that in a week or so he should go back to Don\nRebiera and propose for Donna Agnes.\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Captain Tartar, drawing his breath with astonishment and\ncompressing his lips.\n\n\"Tartar, the wine stands with you,\" said Jack, \"allow me to help you.\"\n\nCaptain Tartar threw himself back in his chair, and let all the air out\nof his chest with a sort of whistle, as if he could hardly contain\nhimself.\n\n\"Have you had wine enough?\" said Jack, very politely; \"if so, we will go\nto the Marquesa's.\"\n\nThe coxswain came to the door, touched his hat to the captain, and\nlooked significantly.\n\n\"And so, sir,\" cried Captain Tartar, in a voice of thunder, rising from\nhis chair, \"you're a damned runaway midshipman, who, if you belonged to\nmy ship, instead of marrying Donna Agnes, I would marry you to the\ngunner's daughter, by God!  Two midshipmen sporting plain clothes in the\nbest society in Palermo, and having the impudence to ask a post-captain\nto dine with them!  To ask me, and address me as _Tartar_, and _my dear\nfellow_! you infernal young scamps!\" continued Captain Tartar, now\nboiling with rage, and striking his fist on the table so as to set all\nthe glasses waltzing.\n\n\"Allow me to observe, sir,\" said Jack, who was completely sobered by the\naddress, \"that we do not belong to your ship, and that we are in plain\nclothes.\"\n\n\"In plain clothes--midshipmen in mufti--yes, you are so: a couple of\nyoung swindlers, without a sixpence in your pocket, passing yourselves\noff as young men of fortune, and walking off through the window without\npaying your bill.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to call me a swindler, sir?\" replied Jack.\n\n\"Yes, sir, you--\"\n\n\"Then you lie,\" exclaimed our hero, in a rage.  \"I am a gentleman, sir--\nI am sorry I cannot pay you the same compliment.\"\n\nThe astonishment and rage of Captain Tartar took away his breath.  He\ntried to speak, but could not--he gasped and gasped, and then sat or\nalmost fell down in his chair--at last he recovered himself.\n\n\"Matthews--Matthews!\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied the coxswain, who had remained at the door.\n\n\"The sergeant of marines.\"\n\n\"Here he is, sir.\"\n\nThe sergeant entered, and raised the back of his hand to his hat.\n\n\"Bring your marines in--take charge of these two.  Direct you are on\nboard, put them both legs in irons.\"\n\nThe marines with their bayonets walked in and took possession of our\nhero and Gascoigne.\n\n\"Perhaps, sir,\" replied Jack, who was now cool again, \"you will permit\nus to pay our bill before we go on board.  We are no swindlers, and it\nis rather a heavy one--or, as you have taken possession of our persons,\nyou will, perhaps, do us the favour to discharge it yourself;\" and Jack\nthrew on the table a heavy purse of dollars.  \"I have only to observe,\nCaptain Tartar, that I wish to be very liberal to the waiters.\"\n\n\"Sergeant, let them pay their bill,\" said Captain Tartar, in a more\nsubdued tone--taking his hat and sword, and walking out of the room.\n\n\"By heavens, Easy, what have you done?--you will be tried by a\ncourt-martial, and turned out of the service.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" replied Jack; \"I was a fool to come into it.  But he called\nme a swindler, and I would give the same answer to-morrow.\"\n\n\"If you are ready, gentlemen,\" said the sergeant, who had been long\nenough with Captain Tartar to be aware that to be punished by him was no\nproof of fault having been committed.\n\n\"I will go and pack up our things, Easy, while you pay the bill,\" said\nGascoigne.  \"Marine, you had better come with me.\"\n\nIn less than half an hour, our hero and his comrade, instead of finding\nthemselves at the Marquesa's ball, found themselves very comfortably in\nirons under the half-deck of H.M. frigate _Aurora_.\n\nWe shall leave them, and return to Captain Tartar, who had proceeded to\nthe ball, to which he had been invited.  On his entering he was accosted\nby Don Martin and Don Philip, who inquired what had become of our hero\nand his friend.  Captain Tartar, who was in no very good humour, replied\nbriskly, \"that they were on board his ship in irons.\"\n\n\"In irons! for what?\" exclaimed Don Philip.\n\n\"Because, sir, they are a couple of young scamps who have introduced\nthemselves into the best company, passing themselves off as people of\nconsequence, when they are only a couple of midshipmen who have run away\nfrom their ship.\"\n\nNow the Rebieras knew very well that Jack and his friend were\nmidshipmen; but this did not appear to them any reason why they should\nnot be considered as gentlemen, and treated accordingly.\n\n\"Do you mean to say, signor,\" said Don Philip, \"that you have accepted\ntheir hospitality, laughed, talked, walked arm in arm with them, pledged\nthem in wine, as we have seen you this evening, and after they have\nconfided in you that you have put them in irons?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I do,\" replied Captain Tartar.\n\n\"Then, by Heaven, you have my defiance, and you are no gentleman!\"\nreplied Don Philip, the elder.\n\n\"And I repeat my brother's words, sir,\" cried Don Martin.\n\nThe two brothers felt so much attachment for our hero, who had twice\nrendered such signal service to their family, that their anger was\nwithout bounds.\n\nIn every other service but the English navy there is not that power of\ngrossly insulting and then sheltering yourself under your rank; nor is\nit necessary for the discipline of any service.  To these young\nofficers, if the power did exist, the use of such power under such\ncircumstances appeared monstrous, and they were determined, at all\nevents, to show to Captain Tartar, that in society, at least, it could\nbe resented.  They collected their friends, told them what had passed,\nand begged them to circulate it through the room.  This was soon done,\nand Captain Tartar found himself avoided.  He went up to the Marquesa\nand spoke to her--she turned her head the other way.  He addressed a\ncount he had been conversing with the night before--he turned short\nround upon his heel, while Don Philip and Don Martin walked up and down\ntalking, so that he might hear what they said, and looking at him with\neyes flashing with indignation.  Captain Tartar left the ball-room and\nreturned to the inn, more indignant than ever.  When he rose the next\nmorning he was informed that a gentleman wished to speak with him; he\nsent up his card as Don Ignatio Verez, colonel commanding the fourth\nregiment of infantry.  On being admitted, he informed Captain Tartar\nthat Don Philip de Rebiera wished to have the pleasure of crossing\nswords with him, and requested to know when it would be convenient for\nCaptain Tartar to meet him.\n\nIt was not in Captain Tartar's nature to refuse a challenge; his courage\nwas unquestionable, but he felt indignant that a midshipman should be\nthe cause of his getting into such a scrape.  He accepted the challenge,\nbut having no knowledge of the small-sword, refused to fight unless with\npistols.  To this the colonel raised no objections, and Captain Tartar\ndespatched his coxswain with a note to his second lieutenant, for he was\nnot on good terms with his first.  The meeting took place--at the first\nfire the ball of Don Philip passed through Captain Tartar's brain, and\nhe instantly fell dead.  The second lieutenant hastened on board to\nreport the fatal result of the meeting, and shortly after, Don Philip\nand his brother, with many of their friends, went off in the Governor's\nbarge to condole with our hero.\n\nThe first lieutenant, now captain _pro tempore_, received them\ngraciously, and listened to their remonstrances relative to our hero and\nGascoigne.\n\n\"I have never been informed by the captain of the grounds of complaint\nagainst the young gentlemen,\" replied he, \"and have therefore no change\nto prefer against them.  I shall therefore order them to be liberated.\nBut, as I learn that they are officers belonging to one of his Majesty's\nships lying at Malta, I feel it my duty, as I sail immediately, to take\nthem there and send them on board of their own ship.\"\n\nJack and Gascoigne were then taken out of irons and permitted to see Don\nPhilip, who informed him that he had revenged the insult, but Jack and\nGascoigne did not wish to go on shore again after what had passed.\nAfter an hour's conversation, and assurances of continued friendship,\nDon Philip, his brother, and their friends, took leave of our two\nmidshipmen, and rowed on shore.\n\nAnd now we must be serious.\n\nWe do not write these novels merely to amuse,--we have always had it in\nour view to instruct, and it must not be supposed that we have no other\nend in view than to make the reader laugh.  If we were to write an\nelaborate work, telling truths, and plain truths, confining ourselves\nonly to point out errors and to demand reform, it would not be read; we\nhave therefore selected this light and trifling species of writing, as\nit is by many denominated, as a channel through which we may convey\nwholesome advice a palatable shape.  If we would point out an error, we\ndraw a character, and although that character appears to weave naturally\ninto the tale of fiction, it becomes as much a beacon, as is a vehicle\nof amusement.  We consider this to be the true art of novel-writing, and\nthat crime and folly and error can be as severely lashed, as virtue and\nmorality can be upheld, by a series of amusing causes and effects, that\nentice the reader to take a medicine, which, although rendered agreeable\nto the palate, still produces the same internal benefit as if it had\nbeen presented to him in its crude state, in which it would either be\nrefused or nauseated.\n\nIn our naval novels, we have often pointed out the errors which have\nexisted, and still do exist, in a service which an honour to its\ncountry; for what institution is there on earth that is perfect, or into\nwhich, if it once was perfect, abuses will not creep?  Unfortunately,\nothers have written to decry the service, and many have raised up their\nvoices against our writings, because they felt that, in exposing error,\nwe were exposing them.  But to this we have been indifferent; we felt\nthat we were doing good, and we have continued.  To prove that we are\ncorrect in asserting that we have done good, we will, out of several,\nstate one single case.\n\nIn \"The King's Own,\" a captain, when requested to punish a man\n_instanter_ for a fault committed, replies that he never has and never\nwill punish a man until twenty-four hours after the offence, that he may\nnot be induced by the anger of the moment to award a severer punishment\nthan in his cooler moments he might think commensurate--and that he\nwished that the Admiralty would give out an order to that effect.\n\nSome time after the publication of that work, the order was given by the\nAdmiralty, forbidding the punishment until a certain time had elapsed\nafter the offence; and we had the pleasure of knowing from the First\nLord of the Admiralty of the time, that it was in consequence of the\nsuggestion in the novel.\n\nIf our writings had effected nothing else, we might still lay down our\npen with pride and satisfaction; but they have done more, much more, and\nwhile they have amused the reader, they have improved the service; they\nhave held up in their characters a mirror, in which those who have been\nin error may see their own deformity, and many hints which have been\ngiven, have afterwards returned to the thoughts of those who have had\ninfluence, have been considered as their own ideas, and have been acted\nupon.  The conduct of Captain Tartar may be considered as a libel on the\nservice--is it not?  The fault of Captain Tartar was not in sending them\non board, or even putting them in irons as deserters, although, under\nthe circumstances, he might have shown more delicacy.  The fault was in\nstigmatising a young man as a swindler, and the punishment awarded to\nthe error is intended to point out the moral, that such an abuse of\npower should be severely visited.  The greatest error now in our\nservice, is the disregard shown to the feelings of the junior officers\nin the language of their superiors: that an improvement has taken place\nI grant, but that it still exists, to a degree injurious to the service,\nI know too well.  The articles of war, as our hero was informed by his\ncaptain, were equally binding on officers and crew; but what a dead\nletter do they become if officers are permitted to break them with\nimpunity!  The captain of a ship will turn the hands up to punishment,\nread the article of war for the transgressing of which the punishment is\ninflicted, and to show at that time their high respect for the articles\nof war, the captain and every officer take off their hats.  The moment\nthe hands are piped down, the second article of war, which forbids all\nswearing, etcetera, in derogation of God's honour, is immediately\ndisregarded.  We are not strait-laced,--we care little about an oath as\na mere _expletive_; we refer now to swearing at _others_, to insulting\ntheir feelings grossly by coarse and intemperate language.  We would\nnever interfere with a man for damning his _own_ eyes, but we deny the\nright of his damning those of _another_.\n\nThe rank of a master in the service is above that of a midshipman, but\nstill the midshipman is a gentleman by birth, and the master, generally\nspeaking, is not.  Even at this moment, in the service, if the master\nwere to damn the eyes of a midshipman, and tell him that he was a liar,\nwould there be any redress, or if so, would it be commensurate to the\ninsult?  If a midshipman were to request a court-martial, would it be\ngranted?--certainly not: and yet this is a point of more importance than\nmay be conceived.  Our service has been wonderfully improved since the\npeace, and those who are now permitted to enter it must be gentlemen.\nWe know that even now there are many who cry out against this as\ndangerous and injurious to the service; as if education spoiled an\nofficer, and the scion of an illustrious house would not be more careful\nto uphold an escutcheon without blemish for centuries, than one who has\nlittle more than brute courage; but those who argue thus are the very\npeople who are injurious to the service, for they can have no other\nreason, except that they wish that the juniors may be tyrannised over\nwith impunity.\n\nBut it remembered that these are not the observations of a junior\nofficer smarting under insult--they are the result of deep and calm\nreflection.  We have arrived to that grade, that, although we have the\npower to inflict, we are too high to receive insult, but we have not\nforgotten how our young blood has boiled when wanton, reckless, and\ncruel torture has been heaped upon our feelings, merely because, as a\njunior officer, we were not in a position to retaliate, or even to\nreply.  And another evil is, that this _great error_ is _disseminated_.\nIn observing on it, in one of our works, called _Peter Simple_, we have\nput the following true observation in the mouth of O'Brien.  Peter\nobserves, in his simple, right-minded way:\n\n\"I should think, O'Brien, that the very circumstance of having had your\nfeelings so often wounded by such language when you were a junior\nofficer would make you doubly careful not to use it towards others, when\nyou had advanced in the service?\"\n\n\"Peter, that's just the first feeling, which wears away after a time,\ntill at last, your own sense of indignation becomes blunted, and becomes\nindifferent to it; you forget, also, that you wound the feelings of\nothers, and carry the habit with, you, to the great injury and disgrace\nof the service.\"\n\nLet it not be supposed that in making these remarks we want to cause\nlitigation, or insubordination.  On the contrary, we assert that this\nerror is the cause, and eventually will be much more the cause, of\ninsubordination; for as the junior officers who enter the service are\nimproved, so will they resist it.  The complaint here is more against\nthe officers, than the captains, whose power has been perhaps already\ntoo much curtailed by late regulations: that power must remain, for\nalthough there may be some few who are so perverted as to make those\nwhom they command uncomfortable, in justice to the service we are proud\nto assert that the majority acknowledge, by their conduct, that the\ngreatest charm attached to power is to be able to make so many people\nhappy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY TWO.\n\nOUR HERO IS SICK WITH THE SERVICE, BUT RECOVERS WITH PROPER MEDICINE--AN\nARGUMENT, ENDING, AS MOST DO, IN A BLOW UP--MESTY LECTURES UPON\nCRANIOLOGY.\n\nThe day after the funeral, H.M. ship _Aurora_ sailed for Malta, and on\nher arrival the acting captain sent our two midshipmen on board the\n_Harpy_ without any remark, except \"victualled the day discharged,\" as\nthey had been borne on the ship's books as supernumeraries.\n\nMr James, who was acting in the _Aurora_, was anxious to join the\nadmiral at Toulon, and intended to sail the next day.  He met Captain\nWilson at the Governor's table, and stated that Jack and Gascoigne had\nbeen put in irons by order of Captain Tartar; his suspicions, and the\nreport that the duel had in consequence taken place; but Gascoigne and\nJack had both agreed that they would not communicate the events of their\ncruise to anybody on board of the _Aurora_; and therefore nothing else\nwas known, except that they must have made powerful friends somehow or\nanother; and there appeared in the conduct of Captain Tartar, as well as\nin the whole transaction, somewhat of a mystery.\n\n\"I should like to know what happened to my friend Jack, who fought the\nduel,\" said the Governor, who had laughed at it till he held his sides;\n\"Wilson, do bring him here to-morrow morning, and let us have his\nstory.\"\n\n\"I am afraid of encouraging him, Sir Thomas--he is much too wild\nalready.  I told you of his first cruise.  He has nothing but\nadventures, and they all end too favourably.\"\n\n\"Well, but you can send for him here and blow him up just as well as in\nyour own cabin, and then we will have the truth out of him.\"\n\n\"That you certainly will,\" replied Captain Wilson, \"for he tells it\nplainly enough.\"\n\n\"Well, to oblige me, send for him--I don't see he was much to blame in\nabsconding, as it appears he thought he would be hung--I want to see the\nlad.\"\n\n\"Well, Governor, if you wish it,\" replied Captain Wilson, who wrote a\nnote to Mr Sawbridge, requesting he would send Mr Easy to him at the\nGovernor's house at ten o'clock in the morning.\n\nJack made his appearance in his uniform--he did not much care for what\nwas said to him, as he was resolved to leave the service.  He had been\nput in irons, and the iron had _entered into his soul_.\n\nMr Sawbridge had gone on shore about an hour before Jack had been sent\non board, and he had remained on shore all the night.  He did not\ntherefore see Jack but for a few minutes, and thinking it his duty to\nsay nothing to him at first, or to express his displeasure, he merely\nobserved to him that the captain would speak to him as soon as he came\non board.  As Gascoigne and our hero did not know how far it might be\nsafe, even at Malta, to acknowledge to what occurred on board the\nsperonare, which might get wind, they did not even tell their messmates,\nresolving only to confide it to the captain.\n\nWhen Jack was ushered into the presence of the captain, he found him\nsitting with the Governor, and the breakfast on the table ready for\nthem.  Jack walked in with courage, but respectfully.  He was fond of\nCaptain Wilson, and wished to show him respect.  Captain Wilson\naddressed him, pointed out that he had committed a great error in\nfighting a duel, a greater error in demeaning himself by fighting the\npurser's steward, and still greater in running away from his ship.  Jack\nlooked respectfully to Captain Wilson, acknowledged that he had done\nwrong, and promised to be more careful another time, if Captain Wilson\nwould look over it.\n\n\"Captain Wilson, allow me to plead for the young gentleman,\" said the\nGovernor; \"I am convinced that it has only been an error in judgment.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr Easy, as you express your contrition, and the Governor\ninterferes in your behalf, I shall take no more notice of this; but\nrecollect, Mr Easy, that you have occasioned me a great deal of anxiety\nby your mad pranks, and I trust another time you will remember that I am\ntoo anxious for your welfare not to be uncomfortable when you run such\nrisks.  You may now go on board to your duty, and tell Mr Gascoigne to\ndo the same; and pray let us hear of no more duels or running away.\"\n\nJack, whose heart softened at this kind treatment, did not venture to\nspeak; he made his bow, and was about to quit the room, when the\nGovernor said:\n\n\"Mr Easy, you have not breakfasted.\"\n\n\"I have, sir,\" replied Jack, \"before I came on shore.\"\n\n\"But a midshipman can always eat two breakfasts, particularly when his\nown comes first--so sit down and breakfast with us--it's all over now.\"\n\n\"Even if it was not,\" replied Captain Wilson, laughing, \"I doubt whether\nit would spoil Mr Easy's breakfast;--come, Mr Easy, sit down.\"\n\nJack bowed, and took his chair, and proved that his lecture had not\ntaken away his appetite.  When breakfast was over, Captain Wilson\nobserved:\n\n\"Mr Easy, you have generally a few adventures to speak of when you\nreturn; will you tell the Governor and me what has taken place since you\nleft us.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir,\" replied Jack; \"but I venture to request that it may be\nunder the promise of secrecy, for it's rather important to me and\nGascoigne.\"\n\n\"Yes, if secrecy is really necessary, my boy; but I'm the best judge of\nthat,\" replied the Governor.\n\nJack then entered into a detail of his adventures, which we have already\ndescribed, much to the astonishment of the Governor and his captain, and\nconcluded his narration by stating that he wanted to leave the service;\nhe hoped that Captain Wilson would discharge him and send him home.\n\n\"Pooh, nonsense!\" said the Governor, \"you shan't leave the Mediterranean\nwhile I am here.  No, no; you must have more adventures, and come back\nand tell them to me.  And recollect, my lad, that whenever you come to\nMalta, there is a bed at the Governor's house, and a seat at his table,\nalways ready for you.\"\n\n\"You are very kind, Sir Thomas,\" replied Jack, \"but--\"\n\n\"No buts at all, sir--you shan't leave the service; besides, recollect\nthat I can ask for leave of absence for you to go and see Donna Agnes--\nay, and send you there too.\"\n\nCaptain Wilson also remonstrated with our hero, and he gave up the\npoint.  It was harsh treatment which made him form the resolution, it\nwas kindness which overcame it.\n\n\"With your permission, Captain Wilson, Mr Easy shall dine with us\nto-day, and bring Gascoigne with him; you shall first scold him, and\nI'll console him with a good dinner--and, boy, don't be afraid to tell\nyour story everywhere: sit down and tell it at Nix Mangare stairs, if\nyou please--I'm Governor here.\"\n\nJack made his obeisance, and departed.\n\n\"The lad must be treated kindly, Captain Wilson,\" said the Governor; \"he\nwould be a loss to the service.  Good heavens, what adventures! and how\nhonestly he tells everything.  I shall ask him to stay with me for the\ntime you are here, if you will allow me: I want to make friends with\nhim; he must not leave the service.\"\n\nCaptain Wilson, who felt that kindness and attention would be more\neffectual with our hero than any other measures, gave his consent to the\nGovernor's proposition.  So Jack ate at the Governor's table, and took\nlessons in Spanish and Italian until the _Harpy_ had been refitted,\nafter heaving down.  Before she was ready a vessel arrived from the\nfleet, directing Captain Wilson to repair to Mahon, and send a\ntransport, lying there, to procure live bullocks for the fleet.  Jack\ndid not join his ship very willingly, but he had promised the Governor\nto remain in the service, and he went on board the evening before she\nsailed.  He had been living so well that he had, at first, a horror of\nmidshipman's fare, but a good appetite seasons everything, and Jack soon\ncomplained that there was not enough.  He was delighted to see Jolliffe\nand Mesty after so long an absence; he laughed at the boatswain's\ncheeks, inquired after the purser's steward's shot-holes, shook hands\nwith Gascoigne and his other mess-mates, gave Vigors a thrashing, and\nthen sat down to supper.\n\n\"Ah, Massa Easy, why you take a cruise without me?\" said Mesty; \"dat\nvery shabby--by de power, but I wish I was there; you ab too much\ndanger, Massa Easy, without Mesty, anyhow.\"\n\nThe next day the _Harpy_ sailed, and Jack went to his duty.  Mr Asper\nborrowed ten pounds, and our hero kept as much watch as he pleased,\nwhich, as watching did not please him, was very little.  Mr Sawbridge\nhad long conversations with our hero, pointing out to him the necessity\nof discipline and obedience in the service, and that there was no such\nthing as equality, and that the rights of man secured to every one the\nproperty which he held in possession.  \"According to your ideas, Mr\nEasy, a man has no more right to his wife than anything else, and any\nother man may claim her.\"  Jack thought of Agnes, and he made matrimony\nan exception, as he continued to argue the point; but although he\nargued, still his philosophy was almost upset at the idea of any one\ndisputing with him the rights of man, with respect to Agnes.\n\nThe _Harpy_ made the African coast, the wind continued contrary, and\nthey were baffled for many days; at last they espied a brig under the\nland, about sixteen miles off; her rig and appearance made Captain\nWilson suspect that she was a privateer of some description or another,\nbut it was calm, and they could not approach her.  Nevertheless, Captain\nWilson thought it his duty to examine her; so at ten o'clock at night\nthe boats were hoisted out: as this was merely intended for a\nreconnoitre, for there was no saying what she might be, Mr Sawbridge\ndid not go.  Mr Asper was on the sick-list, so Mr Smallsole the master\nhad the command of the expedition.  Jack asked Mr Sawbridge to let him\nhave charge of one of the boats.  Mr Jolliffe and Mr Vigors went in\nthe pinnace with the master.  The gunner had the charge of one cutter,\nand our hero had the command of the other.  Jack, although not much more\nthan seventeen, was very strong and tall for his age; indeed, he was a\nman grown, and shaved twice a week.  His only object in going was to\nhave a yarn for the Governor when he returned to Malta.  Mesty went with\nhim, and, as the boat shoved off, Gascoigne slipped in, telling Jack\nthat he was come to take care of him, for which considerate kindness\nJack expressed his warmest thanks.  The orders to the master were very\nexplicit; he was to reconnoitre the vessel, and if she proved heavily\narmed not to attack, for she was embayed, and could not escape the\n_Harpy_ as soon as there was wind.  If not armed he was to board her,\nbut he was to do nothing till the morning: the reason for sending the\nboats away so soon was, that the men might not suffer from the heat of\nthe sun during the day-time, which was excessive, and had already put\nmany men on the sick-list.  The boats were to pull to the bottom of the\nbay, not to go so near as to be discovered, and then drop their grapnels\ntill daylight.  The orders were given to Mr Smallsole in presence of,\nthe other officers who were appointed to the boats, that there might be\nno mistake, and the boats then shoved off.  After a three hours' pull,\nthey arrived to where the brig lay becalmed, and as they saw no lights\nmoving on board, they supposed they were not seen.  They dropped their\ngrapnels in about seven fathoms water and waited for daylight.  When\nJack heard Captain Wilson's orders that they were to lie at anchor till\ndaylight he had sent down Mesty for fishing-lines, as fresh fish is\nalways agreeable in a midshipman's berth: he and Gascoigne amused\nthemselves this way, and as they pulled up the fish they entered into an\nargument, and Mr Smallsole ordered them to be silent.  The point which\nthey discussed was relative to boat service; Gascoigne insisted that the\nboats should all board at once--while our hero took it into his head\nthat it was better they should come up one after another; a novel idea,\nbut Jack's ideas on most points were singular.\n\n\"If you throw your whole force upon the decks at once, you overpower\nthem,\" observed Gascoigne; \"if you do not, you are beaten in detail.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" replied Jack, \"supposing that you have an overpowering\nforce, or they are not prepared; but recollect, that if they are, the\ncase is altered; for instance, as to fire-arms--they fire theirs at the\nfirst boat, and they have not time to reload, when the second comes up\nwith its fire reserved; every fresh boat arriving adds to the courage of\nthose who have boarded, and to the alarm of those who defend; the men\ncome on fresh and fresh.  Depend upon it, Gascoigne, there is nothing\nlike a _corps de reserve_.\"\n\n\"Will you keep silence in your boat, Mr Easy, or will you not?\" cried\nthe master; \"you're a disgrace to the service, sir.\"\n\n\"Thank ye, sir,\" replied Jack, in a low tone.  \"I've another bite, Ned.\"\n\nJack and his comrade continued to fish in silence till the day broke.\nThe mist rolled off the stagnant water, and discovered the brig, who, as\nsoon as she perceived the boats, threw out the French tricolour and\nfired a gun of defiance.  Mr Smallsole was undecided; the gun fired was\nnot a heavy one, and so Mr Jolliffe remarked; the men, as usual,\nanxious for the attack, asserted the same, and Mr Smallsole, afraid of\nretreating from the enemy, and being afterwards despised by the ship's\ncompany, ordered the boats to weigh their grapnels.\n\n\"Stop a moment, my lads,\" said Jack to his men, \"I've got a bite.\"  The\nmen laughed at Jack's taking it so easy, but he was their pet; and they\ndid stop for him to pull up his fish, intending to pull up to the other\nboats and recover their loss of a few seconds.\n\n\"I've hooked him now,\" said Jack; \"you may up with the grapnel while I\nup with the fish.\"  But this delay gave the other boats a start of a\ndozen strokes of their oars, which was a distance not easy to be\nregained.\n\n\"They will be aboard before us, sir,\" said the coxswain.\n\n\"Never mind that,\" replied Jack; \"some one must be last.\"\n\n\"But not the boat I am in,\" replied Gascoigne; \"if I could help it.\"\n\n\"I tell you,\" replied Jack, \"we shall be the _corps de reserve_, and\nhave the honour of turning the scale in our favour.\"\n\n\"Give way, my lads,\" cried Gascoigne, perceiving the other boats still\nkept their distance ahead of them, which was about a cable's length.\n\n\"Gascoigne, I command the boat,\" said Jack, \"and I do not wish my men to\nboard without any breath in their bodies--that's a very unwise plan.  A\nsteady pull, my lads, and not too much exertion.\"\n\n\"By heavens, they'll take the vessel before we get alongside.\"\n\n\"Even if they should, I am right, am I not, Mesty?\"\n\n\"Yes, Massa Easy, you are right--suppose they take vessel without you,\nthey no want you--suppose they want you, you come.\"  And the negro, who\nhad thrown his jacket off, bared his arm, as if he intended mischief.\n\nThe first cutter, commanded by the gunner, now gained upon the launch,\nand was three boats'-lengths ahead of her when she came alongside.  The\nbrig poured in her broadside--it was well directed, and down went the\nboat.\n\n\"Cutter's sunk,\" exclaimed Gascoigne, \"by heavens!  Give way, my men.\"\n\n\"Now, don't you observe, that had we all three been pulling up together,\nthe broadside would have sunk us all?\" said Jack, very composedly.\n\n\"There's board in the launch--give way, my men, give way,\" said\nGascoigne, stamping with impatience.\n\nThe reception was evidently warm; by the time that the launch had poured\nin her men, the second cutter was close under the brig's quarter--two\nmore strokes and she was alongside; when of a sudden a tremendous\nexplosion took place on the deck of the vessel, and bodies and fragments\nwere hurled up in the air.  So tremendous was the explosion, that the\nmen of the second cutter, as if transfixed, simultaneously stopped\npulling, their eyes directed to the volumes of smoke which poured\nthrough the ports, and hid the whole of the masts and rigging of the\nvessel.\n\n\"Now's your time, my lads, give way and alongside,\" cried our hero.\n\nThe men, reminded by his voice, obeyed--but the impetus already given to\nthe boat was sufficient.  Before they could drop their oars in the water\nthey grazed against the vessel's sides, and, following Jack, were in a\nfew seconds on the quarter-deck of the vessel.  A dreadful sight\npresented itself--the whole deck was black, and corpses lay strewed;\ntheir clothes on them still burning, and among the bodies lay fragments\nof what once were men.\n\nThe capstern was unshipped and turned over on its side--the binnacles\nwere in remnants, and many of the ropes ignited.  There was not one\nperson left on deck to oppose them.\n\nAs they afterwards learned from some of the men who had saved their\nlives by remaining below, the French captain had seen the boats before\nthey anchored, and had made every preparation; he had filled a large\nammunition chest with cartridges for the guns, that they might not have\nto hand them up.  The conflict between the men of the pinnace and the\ncrew of the vessel was carried on near the capstern, and a pistol fired\nhad accidentally communicated with the powder, which blew up in the very\ncentre of the dense and desperate struggle.\n\nThe first object was to draw water and extinguish the flames, which were\nspreading over the vessel; as soon as that was accomplished, our hero\nwent aft to the taffrail, and looked for the cutter which had been\nsunk.--\"Gascoigne, jump into the boat with four men--I see the cutter\nfloats a quarter of a mile astern: there may be some one alive yet.  I\nthink now I see a head or two.\"\n\nGascoigne hastened away, and soon returned with three of the cutter's\nmen; the rest had sunk, probably killed or wounded by the discharge of\nthe broadside.\n\n\"Thank God, there's three saved!\" said Jack, \"for we have lost too many.\nWe must now see if any of these poor fellows are yet alive, and clear\nthe decks of the remnants of those who have been blown to pieces.  I\nsay, Ned, where should we have been if we had boarded with the pinnace?\"\n\n\"You always fall upon your feet, Easy,\" replied Gascoigne; \"but that\ndoes not prove that you are right.\"\n\n\"I see there's no convincing you, Ned, you are so confoundedly fond of\nargument.  However, I've no time to argue now--we must look to these\npoor fellows; some are still alive.\"\n\nBody after body was thrown through the ports, the habiliments, in most\ncases, enabling them to distinguish whether it was that of a departed\nfriend or foe.\n\nJack turned round, and observed Mesty with his foot on a head which had\nbeen blown from the trunk.\n\n\"What are you about, Mesty?\"\n\n\"Massa Easy, I look at dis, and I tink it Massa Vigor's head, and den I\ntink dis skull of his enemy nice present make to little Massa Gossett;\nand den I tink again, and I say, no, he dead and nebber thrash any\nmore--so let him go overboard.\"\n\nJack turned away, forgiving Vigors in his heart, he thought of the petty\nanimosities of a midshipman's berth, as he looked at the blackened\nportion of a body, half an hour before possessing intellect.\n\n\"Massy Easy,\" said Mesty, \"I tink you say right, anyhow, when you say\nforgive: den, Massa Vigors,\" continued Mesty, taking up the head by the\nsinged hair, and tossing it out of the port, \"you really very bad man--\nbut Ashantee forgive you.\"\n\n\"Here's somebody alive,\" said Gascoigne to Jack, examining a body, the\nface of which was black as a cinder and not to be recognised, \"and he is\none of our men too, by his dress.\"\n\nOur hero went up to examine, and to assist Gascoigne in disengaging the\nbody from a heap of ropes and half-burned tarpaulings with which it was\nentangled.  Mesty followed, and looking at the lower extremities said,\n\"Massa Easy, dat Massa Jolliffe, I know him trousers; marine tailor say\nhe patch um for ever, and so old dat de thread no hold; yesterday he had\ndis patch put in, and marine tailor say he damn if he patch any more,\nplease nobody.\"\n\nMesty was right; it was poor Jolliffe, whose face was burned as black as\na coal by the explosion.  He had also lost three fingers of the left\nhand, but as soon as he was brought out on the deck he appeared to\nrecover, and pointed to his mouth for water, which was instantly\nprocured.\n\n\"Mesty,\" said Jack, \"I leave you in charge of Mr Jolliffe; take every\ncare of him till I can come back.\"\n\nThe investigation was then continued, and four English sailors found who\nmight be expected to recover, as well as about the same number of\nFrenchmen; the remainder of the bodies were then thrown overboard.  The\nhat only of the master was picked up between the guns, and there were\nbut eleven Frenchmen found below.\n\nThe vessel was the _Franklin_, a French privateer, of ten guns and\nsixty-five men, of which eight men were away in prizes.  The loss on the\npart of the vessel was forty-six killed and wounded.  On that of the\n_Harpy_, it was five drowned in the cutter, and eighteen blown up\nbelonging to the pinnace, out of which total of twenty-three, they had\nonly Mr Jolliffe and five seamen alive.\n\n\"The _Harpy_ is standing in with a breeze from the offing,\" said\nGascoigne to Easy.\n\n\"So much the better, for I am sick of this, Ned; there is something so\nhorrible in it, and I wish I was on board again.  I have just been to\nJolliffe; he can speak a little; I think he will recover.  I hope so,\npoor fellow; he will then obtain his promotion, for he is the commanding\nofficer of all us who are left.\"\n\n\"And if he does,\" replied Gascoigne, \"he can swear that it was by having\nbeen blown up which spoiled his beauty--but here comes the _Harpy_.  I\nhave been looking for an English ensign to hoist over the French, but\ncannot find one; so I hoist a wheft over it--that will do.\"\n\nThe _Harpy_ was soon hove-to close to the brig, and Jack went on board\nin the cutter to report what had taken place.  Captain Wilson was much\nvexed and grieved at the loss of so many men: fresh hands were put in\nthe cutter to man the pinnace, and he and Sawbridge both went on board\nto witness the horrible effects of the explosion as described by our\nhero.\n\nJolliffe and the wounded men were taken on board, and all of them\nrecovered.  We have before stated how disfigured the countenance of poor\nMr Jolliffe had been by the smallpox--so severely was it burned that\nthe whole of the countenance came off in three weeks like a mask, and\nevery one declared that, seamed as it still was, Mr Jolliffe was better\nlooking than he was before.  It may be as well here to state that Mr\nJolliffe not only obtained his promotion, but a pension for his wounds,\nand retired from the service.  He was still very plain, but as it was\nknown that he had been blown up, the loss of his eye as well as the\nscars on his face were all put down to the same accident, and he excited\ninterest as a gallant and maimed officer.  He married, and lived\ncontented and happy to a good old age.\n\nThe _Harpy_ proceeded with her prize to Mahon.  Jack, as usual, obtained\na great deal of credit; whether he deserved it, or whether, as Gascoigne\nobserved, he always fell upon his feet, the reader may decide from our\nnarrative; perhaps there was a little of both.  The seamen of the\n_Harpy_, if summoned in a hurry, used very often to reply, \"Stop a\nminute, I've got a bite\"--as for Jack, he often said to himself, \"I have\na famous good yarn for the Governor.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY THREE.\n\nJACK GOES ON ANOTHER CRUISE--LOVE AND DIPLOMACY--JACK PROVES HIMSELF TOO\nCLEVER FOR THREE, AND UPSETS ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE HIGH\nCONTRACTING POWERS.\n\nA few days after the arrival of the _Harpy_ at Port Mahon, a Cutter came\nin with despatches from the admiral.  Captain Wilson found that he was\nposted into the _Aurora_ frigate, in which a vacancy had been made by\nthe result of our hero's transgressions.\n\nMr Sawbridge was raised to the rank of commander, and appointed to the\ncommand of the _Harpy_.  The admiral informed Captain Wilson that he\nmust detain the _Aurora_ until the arrival of another frigate, hourly\nexpected, and then she would be sent down to Mahon for him to take the\ncommand of her.  Further, he intimated that a supply of live bullocks\nwould be very agreeable, and begged that he would send to Tetuan\nimmediately.\n\nCaptain Wilson had lost so many officers that he knew not whom to send:\nindeed, now he was no longer in command of the _Harpy_, and there was\nbut one lieutenant, and no master or master's mate.  Gascoigne and Jack\nwere the only two serviceable midshipmen, and he was afraid to trust\nthem on any expedition in which expedition was required.\n\n\"What shall we do, Sawbridge? shall we send Easy or Gascoigne, or both,\nor neither?--for if the bullocks are not forthcoming, the admiral will\nnot let them off as we do.\"\n\n\"We must send somebody, Wilson,\" replied Captain Sawbridge, \"and it is\nthe custom to send two officers, as one receives the bullocks on board,\nwhile the other attends to the embarkation.\"\n\n\"Well, then send both, Sawbridge, but lecture them well first.\"\n\n\"I don't think they can get into any mischief there,\" replied Sawbridge;\n\"and it's such a hole that they will be glad to get away from it.\"\n\nEasy and Gascoigne were summoned, listened very respectfully to all\nCaptain Sawbridge said, promised to conduct themselves with the utmost\npropriety, received a letter to the vice-consul, and were sent with\ntheir hammocks and chests in the cabin on board the _Eliza Ann_, brig,\nof two hundred and sixteen tons, chartered by government--the master and\ncrew of which were all busy forward heaving up their anchors.\n\nThe master of the transport came aft to receive them: he was a short\nred-haired young man, with hands as broad as the flappers of a turtle;\nhe was broad-faced, broad-shouldered, well-freckled, pug-nosed; but if\nnot very handsome he was remarkably good-humoured.  As soon as the\nchests and hammocks were on the deck, he told them that when he could\nget the anchor up and make sail, he would give them some bottled porter.\nJack proposed that he should get the porter up, and they would drink it\nwhile he got the anchor up, as it would save time.\n\n\"It may save time mayhap, but it won't save porter,\" replied the master;\n\"however, you shall have it.\"\n\nHe called the boy, ordered him to bring up the porter, and then went\nforward.  Jack made the boy bring up two chairs, put the porter on the\ncompanion hatch, and he and Gascoigne sat down.  The anchor was weighed,\nand the transport ran out under her fore-topsail, as they were\nlight-handed, and had to secure the anchor.  The transport passed within\nten yards of the _Harpy_, and Captain Sawbridge, when he perceived the\ntwo midshipmen taking it so very easy, sitting in their chairs with\ntheir legs crossed, arms folded, and their porter before them, had a\nvery great mind to order the transport to heave-to, but he could spare\nno other officer, so he walked away, saying to himself, \"There'll be\nanother yarn for the Governor, or I'm mistaken.\"\n\nAs soon as sail was made on the transport, the master, whose name was\nHogg, came up to our hero, and asked him how he found the porter.  Jack\ndeclared that he never could venture an opinion upon the first\nbottle--\"So, Captain Hogg, we'll trouble you for a second\"--after which\nthey troubled him for a third--begged for a fourth--must drink his\nhealth in a fifth, and finally, pointed out the propriety of making up\nthe half-dozen.  By this time they found themselves rather light-headed,\nso, desiring Captain Hogg to keep a sharp lookout, and not to call them\non any account whatever, they retired to their hammocks.\n\nThe next morning they awoke late; the breeze was fresh and fair: they\nrequested Captain Hogg not to consider the expense, as they would pay\nfor all they ate and drank, and all he did, into the bargain, and\npromised him a fit-out when they got to Tetuan.\n\nWhat with this promise and calling him captain, our hero and Gascoigne\nwon the master's heart, and being a very good-tempered fellow, they did\nwhat they pleased.  Jack also tossed a doubloon to the men for them to\ndrink on their arrival, and all the men of the transport were in a\ntransport, at Jack's coming to \"reign over them.\"  It must be\nacknowledged that Jack's reign was, for the most part of it, \"happy and\nglorious.\"  At last they arrived at Tetuan, and our Pylades and Orestes\nwent on shore to call upon the vice-consul, accompanied by Captain Hogg.\nThey produced their credentials and demanded bullocks.  The vice-consul\nwas a very young man, short and thin, and light-haired; his father had\nheld the situation before him, and he had been appointed his successor\nbecause nobody else had thought the situation worth applying for.\nNevertheless Mr Hicks was impressed with the immense responsibility of\nhis office.  It was, however, a place of some little emolument at this\nmoment, and Mr Hicks had plenty on his hands besides his sister, who,\nbeing the only English lady there, set the fashion of the place, and\nusurped all the attention of the gentlemen mariners who occasionally\ncame for bullocks.  But Miss Hicks knew her own importance, and had\nsuccessively refused three midshipmen, one master's mate, and an acting\npurser.  African bullocks were plentiful at Tetuan, but English ladies\nwere scarce; moreover, she had a pretty little fortune of her own, to\nwit, three hundred dollars in a canvas bag, left her by her father, and\nentirely at her own disposal.  Miss Hicks was very like her brother,\nexcept that she was more dumpling in her figure, with flaxen hair; her\nfeatures were rather pretty, and her skin very fair.  As soon as the\npreliminaries had been entered into, and arrangements made in a small\nroom with bare walls, which Mr Hicks denominated his office, they were\nasked to walk into the parlour to be introduced to the vice-consul's\nsister.  Miss Hicks tossed her head at the two midshipmen, but smiled\nmost graciously at Captain Hogg.  She knew the relative ranks of\nmidshipman and captain.  After a short time she requested the honour of\nCaptain Hogg's company to dinner, and begged that he would bring his\nmidshipmen with him, at which Jack and Gascoigne looked at each other\nand burst out in a laugh, and Miss Hicks was very near rescinding the\nlatter part of her invitation.  As soon as they were out of the house,\nthey told the captain to go on board and get all ready whilst they\nwalked round the town.  Having peeped into every part of it, and stared\nat Arabs, Moors, and Jews, till they were tired, they proceeded to the\nlanding-place, where they met the captain, who informed them that he had\ndone nothing, because the men were all drunk with Jack's doubloon.  Jack\nreplied that a doubloon would not last for ever, and that the sooner\nthey drank it out the better.  They then returned to the vice-consul's,\nwhom they requested to procure for them fifty dozen of fowls, twenty\nsheep, and a great many other articles, which might be obtained at the\nplace; for, as Jack said, they would live well going up to Toulon, and\nif there were any of the stock left, they would give them to the\nadmiral, for Jack had taken the precaution to put his _father's\nphilosophy_ once more to the proof, before he quitted Mahon.  As Jack\ngave such a liberal order, and the vice-consul cheated him out of at\nleast one-third of what he paid, Mr Hicks thought he could do no less\nthan offer beds to our midshipmen as well as to Captain Hogg; so, as\nsoon as dinner was over, they ordered Captain Hogg to go on board and\nbring their things on shore, which he did.  As the time usual for\ntransports remaining at Tetuan before they could be completed with\nbullocks was three weeks, our midshipmen decided upon staying at least\nso long if they could find anything to do, or if they could not, doing\nnothing was infinitely preferable to doing duty.  So they took up their\nquarters at the vice-consul's, sending for porter and other things which\nwere not to be had but from the transport; and Jack, to prove that he\nwas not a swindler, as Captain Tartar had called him, gave Captain Hogg\na hundred dollars on account, for Captain Hogg had a large stock of\nporter and English luxuries, which he had brought out as a venture, and\nof which he had still a considerable portion left.  As, therefore, our\nmidshipmen not only were cheated by the vice-consul, but they also\nsupplied his table, Mr Hicks was very hospitable, and everything was at\ntheir service except Miss Julia, who turned up her nose at a midshipman,\neven upon full pay; but she made great advances to the captain, who, on\nhis part, was desperately in love: so the mate and the men made all\nready for the bullocks, Jack and Gascoigne made themselves comfortable,\nand Captain Hogg made love, and thus passed the first week.\n\nThe chamber of Easy and Gascoigne was at the top of the house, and\nfinding it excessively warm, Gascoigne had forced his way up to the flat\nroof above (for the houses are all built in that way in most Mahomedan\ncountries, to enable the occupants to enjoy the cool of the evening, and\nsometimes to sleep there).  Those roofs, where houses are built next to\neach other, are divided by a wall of several feet, to insure that\nprivacy which the Mahomedan customs demand.\n\nGascoigne had not been long up there before he heard the voice of a\nfemale, singing a plaintive air in a low tone, on the other side of the\nwall.  Gascoigne sang well himself, and having a very fine ear, he was\npleased with the correctness of the notes, although he had never heard\nthe air before.  He leaned against the wall, smoked his cigar, and\nlistened.  It was repeated again and again at intervals; Gascoigne soon\ncaught the notes, which sounded so clear and pure in the silence of the\nnight.\n\nAt last they ceased, and having waited another half-hour in vain, our\nmidshipman returned to his bed, humming the air which had so pleased his\near.  It haunted him during his sleep, and rang in his ears when he\nawoke, as it is well known any new air that pleases us will do.  Before\nbreakfast was ready, Gascoigne had put English words to it, and sang\nthem over and over again.  He inquired of the vice-consul who lived in\nthe next house, and was answered, that it was an old Moor, who was\nreported to be wealthy, and to have a daughter, whom many of the people\nhad asked in marriage, but whether for her wealth or for her beauty he\ncould not tell; he had, however, heard that she was very handsome.\nGascoigne made no further inquiries, but went out with Jack and Captain\nHogg, and on board to see the water got in for the bullocks.\n\n\"Where did you pick up that air, Gascoigne? it is very pretty, but I\nnever heard you sing it before.\"\n\nGascoigne told him, and also what he had heard from Mr Hicks.\n\n\"I'm determined, Jack, to see that girl if I can.  Hicks can talk Arabic\nfast enough; just ask him the Arabic for these words--`Don't be afraid--\nI love you--I cannot speak your tongue,'--and put them down on paper as\nthey are pronounced.\"\n\nJack rallied Gascoigne upon his fancy, which could end in nothing.\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" replied Gascoigne; \"and I should have cared nothing about\nit, if she had not sung so well.  I really believe the way to my heart\nis through my ear;--however, I shall try to-night, and soon find if she\nhas the feeling which I think she has.  Now let us go back: I'm tired of\nlooking at women in garments up to their eyes, and men in dirt up to\ntheir foreheads.\"\n\nAs they entered the house they heard an altercation between Mr and Miss\nHicks.\n\n\"I shall never give my consent, Julia; one of those midshipmen you turn\nyour nose up at is worth a dozen Hoggs.\"\n\n\"Now, if we only knew the price of a hog in this country,\" observed\nEasy, \"we should be able to calculate our exact value, Ned.\"\n\n\"A hog, being an unclean animal, is not--\"\n\n\"Hush,\" said Jack.\n\n\"Mr Hicks,\" replied Miss Julia, \"I am mistress of myself and my\nfortune, and I shall do as I please.\"\n\n\"Depend upon it, you shall not, Julia.  I consider it my duty to prevent\nyou from making an improper match; and, as his Majesty's representative\nhere, I cannot allow you to marry this young man.\"\n\n\"Mercy on us!\" said Gascoigne, \"his Majesty's representative!\"\n\n\"I shall not ask your consent,\" replied the lady.\n\n\"Yes, but you shall not marry without my consent.  I have, as you know,\nJulia, from my situation here, as one of his Majesty's _corps\ndiplomatick_, great power, and I shall forbid the banns; in fact, it is\nonly I who can marry you.\"\n\n\"Then I'll marry elsewhere.\"\n\n\"And what will you do on board of the transport until you are able to be\nmarried?\"\n\n\"I shall do as I think proper,\" replied the lady; \"and I'll thank you\nfor none of your indelicate insinuations.\"  So saying, the lady bounced\nout of the room into her own, and our midshipmen then made a noise in\nthe passage, to intimate that they had come in.  They found Mr Hicks\nlooking very red and vice-consular indeed, but he recovered himself; and\nCaptain Hogg making _his_ appearance, they went to dinner; but Miss\nJulia would not make _her_ appearance, and Mr Hicks was barely civil to\nthe captain, but he was soon afterwards called out, and our midshipmen\nwent into the office to enable the two lovers to meet.  They were heard\nthen talking together, and after a time they said less, and their\nlanguage was more tender.\n\n\"Let us see what's going on, Jack,\" said Gascoigne; and they walked\nsoftly, so as to perceive the two lovers, who were too busy to be on the\nlookout.\n\nCaptain Hogg was requesting a lock of his mistress's hair.  The plump\nJulia could deny him nothing; she let fall her flaxen tresses, and\ntaking out the scissors cut off a thick bunch from her hair behind,\nwhich she presented to the captain: it was at least a foot and a half\nlong and an inch in circumference.  The Captain took it in his immense\nhand, and thrust it into his coat pocket behind, but one thrust down to\nthe bottom would not get it in, so he thrust again and again, until it\nwas all coiled away like a cable in a tier.\n\n\"That's a liberal girl,\" whispered Jack; \"she gives by _wholesale_ what\nit will take some time to _retail_.  But here comes Mr Hicks, let's\ngive them warning; I like Hogg and as she fancies pork, she shall have\nit, if I can contrive to help them.\"\n\nThat night Gascoigne went again on the roof, and after waiting some\ntime, heard the same air repeated: he waited until it was concluded, and\nthen, in a very low tone, sang it himself to the words he had arranged\nfor it.  For some time all was silent, and then the singing recommenced,\nbut it was not to the same air.  Gascoigne waited until the new air had\nbeen repeated several times, and then giving full scope to his fine\ntenor voice, sang the first air again.  It echoed through the silence of\nthe night air, and then he waited, but in vain; the soft voice of the\nfemale was heard no more, and Gascoigne retired to rest.\n\nThis continued for three or four nights, Gascoigne singing the same airs\nthe ensuing night that he had heard the preceding, until at last it\nappeared that the female had no longer any fear, but changed the airs so\nas to be amused with the repetition of them next evening.  On the fifth\nnight she sang the first air, and our midshipman responding, she then\nsang another, until she had sung them all, waiting each time for the\nresponse.  The wall was not more than eight feet high, and Gascoigne now\ndetermined, with the assistance of Jack, to have a sight of his unknown\nsongstress.  He asked Captain Hogg to bring on shore some inch line, and\nhe contrived to make a ladder with three or four poles which were\nupstairs, used for drying linen.  He fixed them against the wall without\nnoise, all ready for the evening.  It was a beautiful clear moonlight\nnight, when he went up, accompanied by Jack.  The air was again sung,\nand repeated by.  Gascoigne, who then softly mounted the ladder, held by\nJack, and raised his head above the wall; he perceived a young Moorish\ngirl, splendidly dressed, half lying on an ottoman, with her eyes fixed\nupon the moon, whose rays enabled him to observe that she was indeed\nbeautiful.  She appeared lost in contemplation; and Gascoigne would have\ngiven the world to have divined her thoughts.  Satisfied with what he\nhad seen, he descended, and singing one of the airs, he then repeated\nthe words, \"Do not be afraid--I love you--I cannot speak your language.\"\nHe then sang another of the airs, and after he had finished he again\nrepeated the words in Arabic; but there was no reply.  He sang the third\nair, and again repeated the words, when, to his delight, he heard an\nanswer in Lingua Franca.\n\n\"Can you speak in this tongue?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Gascoigne, \"I can, Allah be praised.  Be not afraid--I\nlove you.\"\n\n\"I know you not; who are you? you are not of my people.\"\n\n\"No, but I will be anything that you wish.  I am a Frank, and an English\nofficer.\"\n\nAt this reply of Gascoigne there was a pause.\n\n\"Am I then despised?\" said Gascoigne.\n\n\"No, not despised, but you are not of my people or of my land; speak no\nmore, or you will be heard.\"\n\n\"I obey,\" replied Gascoigne, \"since you wish it, but I shall pine till\nto-morrow's moon.  I go to dream of you.  Allah protect you!\"\n\n\"How amazingly poetical you were in your language, Ned,\" said Easy, when\nthey went into their room.\n\n\"To be sure, Jack, I've read the _Arabian Nights_.  You never saw such\neyes in your life: what a houri she is!\"\n\n\"Is she as handsome as Agnes, Ned?\"\n\n\"Twice as handsome by moonlight.\"\n\n\"That's all moonshine, and so will be your courting, for it will come to\nnothing.\"\n\n\"Not if I can help it.\"\n\n\"Why, Gascoigne, what would you do with a wife?\"\n\n\"Just exactly what you would do, Jack.\"\n\n\"I mean, my dear Ned, can you afford to marry?\"\n\n\"Not while the old governor lives, but I know he has some money in the\nfunds.  He told me one day that I could not expect more than three\nthousand pounds.  You know I have sisters.\"\n\n\"And before you come into that you'll have three thousand children.\"\n\n\"That's a large family, Jack,\" replied Gascoigne, bursting out into\nlaughter, in which our hero joined.\n\n\"Well, you know I only wanted to argue the point with you.\"\n\n\"I know that, Jack; but I think we're counting our chickens before they\nare hatched, which is foolish.\"\n\n\"In every other case except when we venture upon matrimony.\"\n\n\"Why, Jack, you're becoming quite sensible.\"\n\n\"My wisdom is for my friends, my folly for myself.  Good-night.\"\n\nBut Jack did not go to sleep.  \"I must not allow Gascoigne to do such a\nfoolish thing,\" thought he--\"marry a dark girl on midshipman's pay, if\nhe succeeds--get his throat cut if he does not.\"  As Jack said, his\nwisdom was for his friends, and he was so generous that he reserved none\nfor his own occasions.\n\nMiss Julia Hicks, as we before observed, set the fashions at Tetuan, and\nher style of dress was not unbecoming.  The Moorish women wore large\nveils, or they may be called what you will, for their head-dresses\ndescend to their heels at times, and cover the whole body, leaving an\neye to peep with, and hiding everything else.  Now Miss Julia found this\nmuch more convenient than the bonnet, as she might walk out in the heat\nof the sun without burning her fair skin, and stare at everybody and\neverything without being stared at in return.  She therefore never went\nout without one of these overalls, composed of several yards of fine\nmuslin.  Her dress in the house was usually of coloured sarcenet, for a\nsmall vessel came into the port one day during her father's lifetime,\nunloaded a great quantity of bales of goods with English marks; and as\nthe vessel had gone out in ballast, there was a surmise on his part by\nwhat means they came into the captain's possession.  He therefore cited\nthe captain up to the Governor, but the affair was amicably arranged by\nthe vice-consul receiving about one quarter of the cargo in bales of\nsilks and muslins.  Miss Hicks had therefore all her dresses of blue,\ngreen, and yellow sarcenet, which, with the white muslin overall, made\nher as conspicuous as the only Frankish lady in the town had a right to\nbe, and there was not a dog which barked in Tetuan which did not know\nthe sister of the vice-consul, although few had seen her face.\n\nNow it occurred to Jack, as Gascoigne was determined to carry on his\namour, that in case of surprise it would be as well if he dressed\nhimself as Miss Hicks.  He proposed it to Gascoigne the next morning,\nwho approved of the idea, and in the course of the day, when Miss Hicks\nwas busy with Captain Hogg, he contrived to abstract one of her dresses\nand muslin overalls--which he could do in safety, as there were plenty\nof them, for Miss Hicks was not troubled with mantua-maker's bills.\n\nWhen Gascoigne went up on the roof the ensuing night, he put on the\napparel of Miss Hicks, and looked very like her as far as figure went,\nalthough a little taller.  He waited for the Moorish girl to sing, but\nshe did not--so he crept up the ladder and looked over the wall--when he\nobserved that she was reclining, as before, in deep thought.  His head\ncovered with the muslin caught her eye, and she gave a faint scream.\n\n\"Fear not, lady,\" said Gascoigne, \"it is not the first time that I have\nbeheld that sweet face.  I sigh for a companion.  What would I not give\nto be sitting by your side?  I am not of your creed, 'tis true--but does\nit therefore follow that we should not love each other?\"\n\nThe Moorish girl was about to reply, when Gascoigne received an answer\nfrom a quarter whence he little expected it.  It was from the Moor\nhimself, who, hearing his daughter scream, had come swiftly up to the\nroof.\n\n\"Does the Frankish lily wish to mingle her perfumes with the dark\nviolet?\" said he, for he had often seen the sister of the vice-consul,\nand he imagined it was she who had come on the roof and ascended the\nwall to speak with his daughter.\n\nGascoigne had presence of mind to avail himself of this fortunate\nmistake.\n\n\"I am alone, worthy Moor,\" replied he, pulling the muslin more over his\nface, \"and I pine for a companion.  I have been charmed by the\nnightingale on the roof of your dwelling; but I thought not to meet the\nface of a man, when I took courage to climb this ladder.\"\n\n\"If the Frankish lily will have courage to descend, she can sit by the\nside of the dark violet.\"\n\nGascoigne thought it advisable to make no reply.\n\n\"Fear not,\" said the old Moor; \"what is an old man but a woman?\" and the\nMoor brought a ladder, which he placed against the wall.\n\nAfter a pause, Gascoigne said, \"It is my fate;\" and he then descended,\nand was led by the Moor to the mattress upon which his daughter\nreclined.  The Moor then took his seat near them, and they entered into\nconversation.  Gascoigne knew quite enough of the vice-consul and his\nsister to play his part--and he thought proper to tell the Moor that her\nbrother wished to give her as wife to the captain of the ship, whom she\nabhorred, and would take her to a cold and foggy climate; that she had\nbeen born here, and wished to live and die here, and would prefer\npassing her life in his women's apartments, to leaving this country.  At\nwhich Abdel Faza, for such was his name, felt very amorous; he put his\nhand to his forehead, salaamed, and told Gascoigne that his zenana, and\nall that were in it, were hers, as well as his house and himself.  After\nan hour's conversation, in which Azar, his daughter, did not join, the\nold Moor asked Gascoigne to descend into the women's apartment; and\nobserving his daughter's silence, said to her:\n\n\"Azar, you are angry that this Frankish houri should come to the\napartments of which you have hitherto been sole mistress.  Fear not, you\nwill soon be another's, for Osman Ali has asked thee for his wife, and I\nhave listened to his request.\"\n\nNow Osman Ali was as old as her father, and Azar hated him.  She offered\nher hand tremblingly, and led Gascoigne into the zenana.  The Moor\nattended them to the threshold, bowed, and left them.\n\nThat Gascoigne had time to press his suit, and that he did not lose such\na golden opportunity, may easily be imagined, and her father's\ncommunication relative to Osman Ali very much assisted our midshipman's\ncause.\n\nHe left the zenana, like most midshipmen, in love, that is, a little\nabove quicksilver boiling heat.  Jack, who had remained in a state of\nsome suspense all this time, was not sorry to hear voices in an amicable\ntone, and in a few minutes afterwards he perceived that Gascoigne was\nascending the ladder.  It occurred to our hero that it was perhaps\nadvisable that he should not be seen, as the Moor, in his gallantry,\nmight come up the ladder with the supposed lady.  He was right, for\nAbdel Faza not only followed her up the ladder on his side, but assisted\nher to descend on the other, and with great ceremony took his leave.\n\nGascoigne hastened to Jack, who had been peeping, and gave him a detail\nof what had passed, describing Azar as the most beautiful, fascinating,\nand fond creature that ever was created.  After half an hour's relation\nhe stopped short, because he discovered that Jack was fast asleep.\n\nThe visits of Gascoigne were repeated every night; old Abdel Faza became\nevery time more gallant, and our midshipman was under the necessity of\nassuming a virtue if he had it not.  He pretended to be very modest.\n\nIn the meantime Captain Hogg continued his attentions to the real Miss\nHicks; the mate proceeded to get the bullocks on board, and as more than\nthree weeks had already passed away, it was time to think of departing\nfor Toulon; but Captain Hogg was too much in love, and as for Gascoigne,\nhe intended, like all midshipmen in love, to give up the service.  Jack\nreasoned with the Captain, who appeared to listen to reason, because\nMiss Hicks had agreed to follow his fortunes, and crown his transports\nin the transport _Mary Ann_.  He therefore proposed that they should get\naway as fast as they could, and as soon as they had weighed the anchor,\nhe would come on shore, take off Miss Hicks, and make all sail for\nToulon.\n\nJack might have suffered this; the difficulty was with Gascoigne, who\nwould not hear of going away without his lovely Azar.  At last Jack\nplanned a scheme, which he thought would succeed, and which would be a\ngood joke to tell the Governor.  He therefore appeared to consent to\nGascoigne's carrying off his little Moor, and they canvassed how it was\nto be managed.  Jack then told Gascoigne that he had hit upon a plan\nwhich would succeed.  \"I find,\" said he, \"from Captain Hogg, that he has\nan intention of carrying off Miss Hicks, and when I sounded him as to\nhis having a lady with him, he objected to it immediately, saying, that\nhe must have all the cabin to himself and his intended.  Now, in the\nfirst place, I have no notion of giving up the cabin to Miss Hicks or\nMrs Hogg.  It will be very uncomfortable to be shut out because he\nwishes to make love; I therefore am determined that he shall not take\noff Miss Hicks.  He has proposed to me that he shall go on board, and\nget the brig under way, leaving me with a boat on shore to sign the\nvouchers, and that Miss Hicks shall slip into the boat when I go off at\ndusk.  Now I will not bring off Miss Hicks; if he wants to marry her,\nlet him do it when I am not on board.  I have paid for everything, and I\nconsider the cabin as mine.\"\n\n\"Look you, Ned, if you wish to carry off your little Moor, there is but\none way, and that is a very simple one; leave her a dress of Miss\nHicks's when you go there to-morrow night, and tell her to slip down at\ndusk, and come out of the house: all the danger will be in her own\nhouse, for as soon as she is out she will be supposed to be the\nvice-consul's sister, and will not be observed or questioned.  I will\nlook out for and bring her on board instead of Miss Hicks.  Hogg will\nhave the brig under way, and will be too happy to make all sail, and she\nshall lock the cabin inside, so that the mistake shall not be discovered\ntill the next morning, and we shall have a good laugh at Captain Hogg.\"\n\nGascoigne pronounced that Jack's scheme was capital, and agreed to it,\nthanking him and declaring that he was the best friend that he ever had.\n\"So I will be,\" thought Jack, \"but you will not acknowledge it at\nfirst.\"  Jack then went to Captain Hogg, and appeared to enter warmly\ninto his views, but told him that Hicks suspected what was going on, and\nhad told him so, at the same time declaring that he would not lose sight\nof his sister until after Hogg was on board.\n\n\"Now,\" says Jack, \"you know you cannot do the thing by main force; so\nthe best plan will be for you to go on board and get under way, leaving\nme to bring off Miss Hicks, when her brother will imagine all danger to\nbe over.\"\n\n\"Many thanks, Mr Easy,\" replied Captain Hogg; \"it will be capital, and\nI'll arrange it all with my Julia.  How very kind of you!\"\n\n\"But, Hogg, will you promise me secrecy?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the captain.\n\n\"That Gascoigne is a very silly fellow, and wants to run away with a\ngirl he has made acquaintance with here; and what do you think he has\nproposed? that after the ship was under way, I should carry her off in\nthe boat; and he has borrowed one of the dresses of Miss Hicks, that it\nmay appear to be her.  I have agreed to it, but as I am determined that\nhe shall not commit such a folly, I shall bring off Miss Hicks instead;\nand observe, Hogg, he is that sort of wild fellow, that if he was to\nfind that I had cheated him, he would immediately go on shore and be\nleft behind; therefore we must hand Miss Hicks down in the cabin, and\nshe will lock the door all night, so that he may not observe the trick\ntill the next morning, and then we shall have a fine laugh at him.\"\n\nCaptain Hogg replied it would be an excellent joke, as Gascoigne did\nbefore him.\n\nNow it must be observed, that the water and the bullocks, and the sheep\nand fowls, were all on board; and Mr Hicks, having received his money\nfrom Jack, had very much altered his manner; he was barely civil, for as\nhe had got all he could out of our hero, he was anxious to get rid of\nhim as well as of Captain Hogg.  Our hero was very indignant at this,\nbut as it would not suit his present views, pretended not to notice it--\non the contrary, he professed the warmest friendship for the\nvice-consul, and took an opportunity of saying that he could not return\nhis kindness in a better way than by informing him of the plot which had\nbeen arranged.  He then told him of the intended escape of his sister,\nand that he was the person intended to bring her off.\n\n\"Infamous, by heavens!\" cried the vice-consul; \"I shall write to the\nForeign Office on the subject.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Jack, \"it will be much better to do what I shall\npropose, which will end in a hearty laugh, and to the confusion of\nCaptain Hogg.  Do you dress yourself in your sister's clothes, and I\nwill bring you off instead of her.  Let him imagine that he has your\nsister secure; I will hand you down to the cabin, and do you lock\nyourself in.  He cannot sail without my orders, and I will not sign the\nvouchers.  The next morning we will open the cabin door and have a good\nlaugh at him.  Desire your boat to be off at daylight to take you on\nshore, and I will then make him proceed to Toulon forthwith.  It will be\na capital joke.\"\n\nSo thought the vice-consul, as well as Gascoigne and Captain Hogg.  He\nshook hands with Jack, and was as civil to him as before.\n\nThat night Gascoigne left one of Miss Hicks's many dresses with Azar,\nwho agreed to follow his fortunes, and who packed up all the jewels and\nmoney she could lay her hands upon.  Poor little Child, she trembled\nwith fear and delight.  Miss Hicks smuggled, as she thought, a box of\nclothes on board, and in the box was her fortune of three hundred\ndollars.  Mr Hicks laughed in his sleeve, so did Jack; and every one\nwent to bed, with expectations that their wishes would be realised.\nAfter an early dinner, Captain Hogg and Gascoigne went on board, both\nsqueezing Jack's hand as if they were never to see him again, and looks\nof intelligence passed between all the parties.\n\nAs soon as they were out of the door the vice-consul chuckled, and Miss\nHicks, who thought he chuckled at the idea of having rid himself of\nCaptain Hogg, chuckled still more as she looked at our hero, who was her\nconfidant, and our hero, for reasons known to the reader, chuckled more\nthan either of them.\n\nA little before dark, the boat was sent on shore from the brig, which\nwas now under way, and Mr Hicks, as had been agreed, said that he\nshould go into the office and prepare the vouchers--that is, put on his\nsister's clothes.  Miss Hicks immediately rose, and wishing our hero a\npleasant voyage, as had been agreed, said that she should retire for the\nnight, as she had a bad headache--she wished her brother good-night, and\nwent into her room to wait another hour, when our hero, having shoved\noff the boat to deceive the vice-consul, was to return, meet her in the\ngarden, and take her off to the brig.  Our hero then went into the\noffice and assisted the vice-consul, who took off all his own clothes\nand tied them up in a handkerchief, intending to resume them after he\nhad gone into the cabin.\n\nAs soon as he was ready, Jack carried his bundle and led the supposed\nMiss Hicks down to the boat.  They shoved off in a great hurry, and Jack\ntook an opportunity of dropping Mr Hicks's bundle overboard.  As soon\nas they arrived alongside, Mr Hicks ascended, and was handed by Jack\ndown into the Cabin: he squeezed Jack's hand as he entered, saying in a\nwhisper, \"To-morrow morning what a laugh we shall have!\" and then he\nlocked the door.  In the meantime the boat was hooked on and hoisted up,\nand Jack took the precaution to have the dead-lights lowered that Mr\nHicks might not be able to ascertain what was going on.  Gascoigne came\nup to our hero and squeezed his hand.\n\n\"I'm so much obliged to you, Jack.  I say, tomorrow morning what a laugh\nwe shall have!\"\n\nAs soon as the boat was up, and the mainyard filled, Captain Hogg also\ncame up to our hero, shaking him by the hand and thanking him; and he,\ntoo, concluded by saying, \"I say, Mr Easy, to-morrow morning what a\nlaugh we shall have!\"\n\n\"Let those laugh who win,\" thought Jack.\n\nThe wind was fair, the watch was set, the course was steered, and all\nwent down to their hammocks, and went to sleep, waiting for to-morrow\nmorning.  Mr Hicks, also, having nothing better to do, went to sleep,\nand by the morning dawn, the transport _Mary Ann_ was more than a\nhundred miles from the African shore.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.\n\nOUR HERO PLAYS THE VERY DEVIL.\n\nWe must leave the reader to imagine the effect of the next morning's\n_denouement_.  Every one was in a fury except Jack, who did nothing but\nlaugh.  The captain wanted to return to obtain Miss Hicks, Gascoigne to\nobtain Azar, and the vice-consul to obtain his liberty--but the wind was\nfoul for their return, and Jack soon gained the captain on his side.  He\npointed out to him that, in the first place, if he presumed to return,\nhe would forfeit his charter bond; in the second, he would have to pay\nfor all the bullocks which died; in the third, that if he wished to take\nMiss Hicks as his wife, he must not first injure her character by having\nher on board before the solemnity; and lastly, that he could always go\nand marry her whenever he pleased; the brother could not prevent him.\nAll this was very good advice, and the captain became quite calm and\nrational, and set his studding-sails below and aloft.\n\nAs for Gascoigne, it was no use reasoning with him, so it was agreed\nthat he should have satisfaction as soon as they could get on shore\nagain.  Mr Hicks was the most violent; he insisted that the vessel\nshould return, while both Jack and the captain refused, although he\nthreatened them with the whole Foreign Office.  He insisted upon having\nhis clothes, but Jack replied that they had tumbled overboard as they\npulled from the shore.  He then commanded the mate and men to take the\nvessel back, but they laughed at him and his woman's clothes.  \"At all\nevents, I'll have you turned out of the service,\" said he to our hero,\nin his fury.  \"I shall be extremely obliged to you,\" said Jack--and\nCaptain Hogg was so much amused with the vice-consul's appearance in his\nsister's clothes, that he quite forgot his own disappointment in\nlaughing at his intended brother-in-law.  He made friends again with\nJack, who regained his ascendancy, and ordered out the porter on the\ncapstern-head.  They had an excellent dinner, but Mr Hicks refused to\njoin them; which, however, did not spoil the appetite of Jack or the\ncaptain: as for Gascoigne, he could not eat a mouthful, but he drank to\nexcess, looking over the rim of his tumbler as if he could devour our\nhero, who only laughed the more.  Mr Hicks had applied to the men to\nlend him some clothes, but Jack had foreseen that, and he was\nomnipotent.  There was not a jacket or a pair of trousers to be had for\nlove or money.  Mr Hicks then considered it advisable to lower his\ntone, and he applied to Captain Hogg, who begged to be excused without\nhe consented to his marriage with his sister, to which Mr Hicks gave an\nindignant negative.  He then applied to Gascoigne, who told him in a\nvery surly tone to go to hell.  At last he applied to our hero, who\nlaughed, and said that he would see him damned first.  So Mr Hicks sat\ndown in his petticoats, and vowed revenge.  Gascoigne, who had drunk\nmuch and eaten nothing, turned in and went to sleep--while Captain Hogg\nand our hero drank porter on the capstern.  Thus passed the first day,\nand the wind was famously fair--the bullocks lowed, the cocks crew, the\nsheep baa'd, and the _Mary Ann_ made upwards of two hundred miles.  Jack\ntook possession of the other berth in the cabin, and his Majesty's\nrepresentative was obliged to lie down in his petticoats upon a topsail\nwhich lay between decks, with a bullock on each side of him, who every\nnow and then made a dart at him with their horns, as if they knew that\nit was to him that they were indebted for their embarkation and being\ndestined to drive the scurvy out of the Toulon fleet.\n\nWe cannot enter into the details of the passage, which, as the wind was\nfair, was accomplished in ten days without the loss of a bullock.\nDuring this time Mr Hicks condescended to eat without speaking,\nimagining that the hour of retribution would come when they joined the\nadmiral.  Gascoigne gradually recovered himself, but did not speak to\nour hero, who continued to laugh and drink porter.  On the eleventh\nmorning they were in the midst of the Toulon fleet, and Mr Hicks smiled\nexultingly as he passed our hero in his petticoats, and wondered that\nJack showed no signs of trepidation.\n\nThe fleet hove-to, Jack ran under the admiral's stern, lowered down his\nboat, and went on board, showed his credentials, and reported his\nbullocks.  The general signal was made, there was a fair division of the\nspoil, and then the admiral asked our hero whether the master of the\ntransport had any other stock on board.  Jack replied that he had not;\nbut that having been told by the Governor of Malta that they might be\nacceptable, he had bought a few sheep and some dozen of fowls, which\nwere much at his service, if he would accept of them.  The admiral was\nmuch obliged to the Governor, and also to Jack, for thinking of him, but\nwould not, of course, accept of the stock without paying for them.  He\nrequested him to send all of them on board that he could spare, and then\nasked Jack to dine with him, for Jack had put on his best attire, and\nlooked very much of a gentleman.\n\n\"Mr Easy,\" said the flag-captain, who had been looking at the transport\nwith his glass, \"is that the master's wife on board?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied Jack; \"it's the vice-consul.\"\n\n\"What, in petticoats! the vice-consul?\"\n\n\"Yes, the vice-consul of Tetuan.  He came on board in that dress when\nthe brig was under way, and I considered it my duty not to delay, being\naware how very important it was that the fleet should be provided with\nfresh beef.\"\n\n\"What is all this, Mr Easy?\" said the admiral; \"there has been some\ntrick here.  You will oblige me by coming into the cabin.\"\n\nEasy followed the admiral and flag-captain into the cabin, and then\nboldly told the whole story how he tricked them all.  It was impossible\nfor either of them to help laughing, and when they began to laugh it was\nalmost as impossible to stop.\n\n\"Mr Easy,\" said the admiral at last, \"I do not altogether blame you; it\nappears that the captain of the transport would have delayed sailing\nbecause he was in love--and that Mr Gascoigne would have stayed behind\nbecause he was infatuated; independent of the ill-will against the\nEnglish which would have been excited by the abduction of the girl.  But\nI think you might have contrived to manage all that without putting the\nvice-consul in petticoats.\"\n\n\"I acted to the best of my judgment, sir,\" replied Jack, very humbly.\n\n\"And altogether you have done well.  Captain Malcolm, send a boat for\nthe vice-consul.\"\n\nMr Hicks was too impatient to tell his wrongs to care for his being in\nhis sister's clothes: he came on board, and although the tittering was\ngreat, he imagined that it would soon be all in his favour, when it was\nknown that he was a diplomatic.  He told his story, and waited for the\ndecision of the admiral, which was to crush our hero, who stood with the\nmidshipmen on the lee-side of the deck; but the admiral replied, \"Mr\nHicks, in the first place, this appears to me to be a family affair\nconcerning the marriage of your sister, with which I have nothing to do.\nYou went on board of your own free will in woman's clothes.  Mr Easy's\norders were positive, and he obeyed them.  It was his duty to sail as\nsoon as the transport was ready.  You may forward your complaint if you\nplease, but, as a friend, I tell you that it will probably occasion your\ndismissal, for these kind of pranks are not understood at the Foreign\nOffice.  You may return to the transport, which, after she has touched\nat Mahon, will proceed again to Tetuan.  The boat is alongside, sir.\"\n\nMr Hicks, astonished at the want of respect, paid to a vice-consul,\nshoved his petticoats between his legs and went down the side amidst the\nlaughter of the whole of the ship's company.  Our hero dined with the\nadmiral, and was well received.  He got his orders to sail that night\nfor Minorca, and as soon as dinner was over he returned on board, where\nhe found Captain Hogg very busy selling his porter--Gascoigne walking\nthe deck in a brown study--and Mr Hicks _solus_ abaft, sulking in his\npetticoats.\n\nAs soon as they were clear of the boats, the _Mary Ann_ hoisted her\nensign and made sail, and as all the porter was not yet sold, Jack\nordered up a bottle.\n\nJack was much pleased with the result of his explanation with the\nadmiral, and he felt that, for once, he had not only got into no scrape\nhimself, but that he had prevented others.  Gascoigne walked the deck\ngloomily; the fact was that he was very unhappy; he had had time to\nreflect, and now that the first violence had subsided, he felt that our\nhero had done him a real service, and had prevented him from committing\nan act of egregious folly; and yet he had summoned this friend to meet\nhim in the field--and such had been his gratitude.  He would have given\nthe world to recall what had passed and to make friends, but he felt\nashamed, as most people do, to acknowledge his error; he had, however,\nalmost made up his mind to it, and was walking up and down thinking in\nwhat manner he might contrive it, when Jack, who was sitting, as usual,\nin a chair by the capstern, with his porter by him, said to himself,\n\"Now I'll lay my life that Ned wants to make friends, and is ashamed to\nspeak first; I may be mistaken, and he may fly off at a tangent, but\neven if I am, at all events it will not be I who am wrong--I'll try\nhim.\"  Jack waited till Gascoigne passed him again, and then said,\nlooking kindly and knowingly in his face:\n\n\"I say, Ned, will you have a glass of porter?\"\n\nGascoigne smiled, and Jack held out his hand; the reconciliation was\neffected in a moment, and the subject of quarrel was not canvassed by\neither party.\n\n\"We shall be at Minorca in a day or two,\" observed Jack, after a while;\n\"now I shall be glad to get there.  Do you know, Ned, that I feel very\nmuch satisfied with myself; I have got into no scrape this time, and I\nshall, notwithstanding, have a good story to tell the Governor when I go\nto Malta.\"\n\n\"Partly at my expense,\" replied Gascoigne.\n\n\"Why, you will figure a little in it, but others will figure much more.\"\n\n\"I wonder what has become of that poor girl,\" observed Gascoigne, who\ncould not refrain from mentioning her; \"what hurts me most is, that she\nmust think me such a brute.\"\n\n\"No doubt of that, Ned--take another glass of porter.\"\n\n\"Her father gave me this large diamond.\"\n\n\"The old goat--sell it, and drink his health with it.\"\n\n\"No, I'll keep it in memory of his daughter.\"\n\nHere Gascoigne fell into a melancholy reverie, and Jack thought of\nAgnes.\n\nIn two days they arrived at Mahon, and found the _Aurora_ already there,\nin the command of Captain Wilson.  Mr Hicks had persuaded Captain Hogg\nto furnish him with clothes, Jack having taken off the injunction as\nsoon as he had quitted the admiral.  Mr Hicks was aware that if the\nadmiral would not listen to his complaint, it was no use speaking to a\ncaptain: so he remained on board a pensioner upon Captain Hogg, and\nafter our midshipmen quitted the transport they became very good\nfriends.  Mr Hicks consented to the match, and Captain Hogg was made\nhappy.  As for poor Azar, she had wandered about until she was tired in\nMiss Hicks's dress, and at last returned broken-hearted to her father's,\nand was admitted by Abdel Faza himself; he imagined it was Miss Hicks,\nand was in transports--he discovered it was his daughter, and he was in\na fury.  The next day she went to the zenana of Osman Ali.\n\nWhen Jack reported himself he did not tell the history of the\nelopements, that he might not hurt the feelings of Gascoigne.  Captain\nWilson was satisfied with the manner in which he had executed his\norders, and asked him, \"whether he preferred staying in the _Harpy_ or\nfollowing him into the _Aurora_.\"\n\nJack hesitated.\n\n\"Speak frankly, Mr Easy; if you prefer Captain Sawbridge to me I shall\nnot be affronted.\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied Easy, \"I do not prefer Captain Sawbridge to you; you\nhave both been equally kind to me, but I prefer you.  But the fact is,\nsir, that I do not much like to part with Gascoigne, or--\"\n\n\"Or who?\" said the captain, smiling.\n\n\"With Mesty, sir; you may think me very foolish--but I should not be\nalive at this moment, if it had not been for him.\"\n\n\"I do not consider gratitude to be foolish, Mr Easy,\" replied Captain\nWilson.  \"Mr Gascoigne I intend to take with me, if he chooses to come,\nas I have a great respect for his father, and no fault to find with him,\nthat is, generally speaking--but as for Mesty--why, he is a good man,\nand as you have behaved yourself very well, perhaps I may think of it.\"\n\nThe next day Mesty was included among the boat's crew taken with him by\nCaptain Wilson, according to the regulations of the service, and\nappointed to the same situation under the master-at-arms of the\n_Aurora_.  Gascoigne and our hero were also discharged into the frigate.\n\nAs our hero never has shown any remarkable predilection for duty, the\nreader will not be surprised at his requesting from Captain Wilson a few\ndays on shore, previous to his going on board of the _Aurora_.  Captain\nWilson allowed the same licence to Gascoigne, as they had both been\ncooped up for some time on board of a transport.  Our hero took up his\nquarters at the only respectable hotel in the town, and whenever he\ncould meet an officer of the _Aurora_, he very politely begged the\npleasure of his company to dinner.  Jack's reputation had gone before\nhim, and the midshipmen drank his wine and swore he was a trump.  Not\nthat Jack was to be deceived, but upon the principles of equality he\nargued that it was the duty of those who could afford dinners to give\nthem to those who could not.  This was a sad error on Jack's part; but\nhe had not yet learned the value of money; he was such a fool as to\nthink that the only real use of it was to make other people happy.  It\nmust, however, be offered in his extenuation that he was a midshipman\nand a philosopher, and not yet eighteen.\n\nAt last Jack had remained so long on shore, keeping open house, and the\nfirst lieutenant of the _Aurora_ found the officers so much more anxious\nfor leave, now that they were at little or no expense, that he sent him\na very polite message, requesting the pleasure of his company on board\nthat evening.  Jack returned an equally polite answer, informing the\nfirst lieutenant that not being aware that he wished to see him, he had\npromised to accompany some friends to a masquerade that night, but that\nhe would not fail to pay his respects to him the next day.  The first\nlieutenant admitted the excuse, and our hero, after having entertained\nhalf a dozen of the _Auroras_, for the _Harpy_ had sailed two days\nbefore, dressed himself for the masquerade, which was held in a church\nabout two miles and a half from Mahon.\n\nJack had selected the costume of the _devil_, as being the most\nappropriate, and mounting a jackass, he rode down in his dress to the\nmasquerade.  But, as Jack was just going in, he perceived a yellow\ncarriage, with two footmen in gaudy liveries, draw up, and, with his\nusual politeness, when the footmen opened the door, offered his arm to\nhand out a fat old dowager covered with diamonds; the lady looked up,\nand perceiving Jack covered with hair, with his trident and his horns\nand long tail, gave a loud scream, and would have fallen had it not been\nfor Captain Wilson, who, in his full uniform, was coming in, and caught\nher in his arms: while the old lady thanked him, and Captain Wilson\nbowed, Jack hastily retreated.  \"I shall make no conquests to-night,\"\nthought he, so he entered the church, and joined the crowd; but it was\nso dense that it was hardly possible to move, and our hero soon got\ntired of flourishing his trident, and sticking it into people, who\nwondered what the devil he meant.\n\n\"This is stupid work,\" thought Jack, \"I may have more fun outside:\" so\nJack put on his cloak, left the masquerade, and went out in search of\nadventures.  He walked into the open country about half a mile, until he\ncame to a splendid house, standing in a garden of orange-trees, which he\ndetermined to reconnoitre.  He observed that a window was open and\nlights were in the room; and he climbed up to the window, and just\nopened the white curtain and looked in.  On a bed lay an elderly person,\nevidently dying, and by the side of the bed were three priests, one of\nwhom held the crucifix in his hand, another the censer, and a third was\nsitting at a table with a paper, pen, and ink.  As Jack understood\nSpanish, he listened, and heard one of the priests say:\n\n\"Your sins have been enormous, my son, and I cannot give you extreme\nunction or absolution unless you make some amends.\"\n\n\"I have,\" answered the moribund, \"left money for ten thousand masses to\nbe said for my soul.\"\n\n\"Five hundred thousand masses are not sufficient: how have you gained\nyour enormous wealth? by usury and robbing the poor.\"\n\n\"I have left a thousand dollars to be distributed among the poor on the\nday of my funeral.\"\n\n\"One thousand dollars is nothing--you must leave all your property to\nholy church.\"\n\n\"And my children!\" replied the dying man faintly.\n\n\"What are your children compared to your salvation?--reply not: either\nconsent, or not only do I refuse you the consolation of the dying, but I\nexcommunicate--\"\n\n\"Mercy, holy father--mercy!\" said the old man, in a dying voice.\n\n\"There is no mercy, you are damned for ever and ever.  Amen.  Now hear:\n_excommunicabo te_--\"\n\n\"Stop--stop--have you the paper ready?\"\n\n\"'Tis here, all ready, by which you revoke all former wills, and endow\nthe holy church with your property.  We will read it, for God forbid\nthat it should be said that the holy church received an involuntary\ngift.\"\n\n\"I will sign it,\" replied the dying man; \"but my sight fails me; be\nquick, absolve me.\"  And the paper was signed, with difficulty, as the\npriests supported the dying man.  \"And now--absolve me.\"\n\n\"I do absolve thee,\" replied the priest, who then went through the\nceremony.\n\n\"Now this is a confounded rascally business,\" said Jack to himself; who\nthen dropped his cloak, jumped upon the window-sill, opened wide the\nwindow-curtains with both hands, and uttered a yelling kind of \"ha! ha!\nha! ha!\"\n\nThe priests turned round, saw the demon, as they imagined--dropped the\npaper on the table, and threw themselves with their faces on the floor.\n\n\"_Exorciso te_,\" stammered one.\n\n\"Ha! ha! ha! ha!\" repeated Jack, entering the room, and taking up the\npaper, which he burned by the flame of the candle.  Our hero looked at\nthe old man on the bed; his jaw had fallen, his eyes were turned.  He\nwas dead.  Jack then gave one more \"ha! ha! ha! ha!\" to keep the priests\nin their places, blew out the candles, made a spring out of the window,\ncaught up his cloak, and disappeared as fast as his legs could carry\nhim.\n\nJack ran until he was out of breath, and then he stopped, and sat down\nby the side of the road.  It was broad moonlight, and Jack knew not\nwhere he was; \"but Minorca has not many high-roads,\" thought Jack, \"and\nI shall find my way home.  Now let me see--I have done some good this\nevening.  I have prevented those rogues from disinheriting a family.  I\nwonder who they are; they ought to be infinitely obliged to me.  But if\nthe priests find me out, what shall I do?  I never dare come on shore\nagain--they'd have me in the inquisition.  I wonder where I am,\" said\nJack; \"I will get on that hill, and see if I can take a departure.\"\n\nThe hill was formed by the road being cut perpendicularly almost through\nit, and was perhaps some twelve or fourteen feet high.  Jack ascended\nit, and looked about him.  \"There is the sea, at all events, with the\nfull moon silvering the waves,\" said Jack, turning from the road, \"and\nhere is the road; then that must be the way to Port Mahon.  But what\ncomes here?--it's a carriage.  Why, it's the yellow carriage of that old\nlady with her diamonds, and her two splashy footmen!\"  Jack was watching\nit as it passed the road under him, when, of a sudden, he perceived\nabout a dozen men rush out, and seize the horses' heads--a discharge of\nfire-arms, the coachman dropped off the box, and the two footmen dropped\nfrom behind.  The robbers then opened the door, and were hauling out the\nfat old lady covered with diamonds.  Jack thought a second--it occurred\nto him, that, although he could not cope with so many, he might frighten\nthem, as he had frightened one set of robbers already that night.  The\nold lady had just been tumbled out of the carriage door, like a large\nbundle of clothes tied up for the wash, when Jack, throwing off his\ncloak, and advancing to the edge of the precipice, with the full moon\nbehind him throwing out his figure in strong relief, raised his trident,\nand just as they were raising their knives, yelled a most unearthly \"ha!\nha! ha! ha!\"  The robbers looked up, and forgetting the masquerade, for\nthere is a double tremor in guilt, screamed with fear; most of them ran\naway, and dropped after a hundred yards; others remained paralysed and\ninsensible.  Jack descended the hill, went to the assistance of the old\nlady, who had swooned, and had to put her into the carriage; but\nalthough our hero was very strong, this was a work of no small\ndifficulty.  After one or two attempts, he lowered down the steps, and\ncontrived to bump her on the first, from the first he purchased her on\nthe second, and from the second he at last seated her at the door of the\ncarriage.  Jack had no time to be over-polite.  He then threw her back\ninto the bottom of the carriage, her heels went up to the top, Jack\nshoved in her petticoats as fast as he could, for decency, and then\nshutting the door seized the reins, and jumped upon the box.  \"I don't\nknow the way,\" thought Jack, \"but we must needs go when the _devil\ndrives_;\" so sticking his trident into the horses, they set off at a\nrattling pace, passing over the bodies of the two robbers, who had held\nthe reins, and who both lay before him in a swoon.  As soon as he had\nbrought the horses into a trot, he slackened the reins, for, as Jack\nwisely argued, they will be certain to go home if I let them have their\nown way.  The horses, before they arrived at the town, turned off, and\nstopped at a large country house.  That he might not frighten the\npeople, Jack had put on his cloak, and taken off his mask and\nhead-piece, which he had laid beside him on the box.  At the sound of\nthe carriage wheels the servants came out, when Jack, in a few words,\ntold them what had happened.  Some of the servants ran in, and a young\nlady made her appearance, while the others were helping the old lady out\nof the carriage, who had recovered her senses, but had been so much\nfrightened that she had remained in the posture in which Jack had put\nher.\n\nAs soon as she was out, Jack descended from the coach-box and entered\nthe house.  He stated to the young lady what had taken place, and how\nopportunely he had frightened away the robbers, just as they were about\nto murder her relation; and also suggested the propriety of sending\nafter the servants who had fallen in the attack, which was immediately\ndone by a strong and well-armed party collected for the occasion.  Jack,\nhaving made his speech, made a very polite bow and took his leave,\nstating that he was an English officer belonging to a frigate in the\nharbour.  He knew his way back, and in half an hour was again at the\ninn, and found his comrades.  Jack thought it advisable to keep his own\nsecret, and therefore merely said that he had taken a long walk in the\ncountry; and soon afterwards went to bed.\n\nThe next morning our hero, who was always a man of his word, packed up\nhis portmanteau, and paid his bill.  He had just completed this heavy\noperation, when somebody wanted to speak to him, and a sort of\nhalf-clerical, half-legal sort of looking gentleman was introduced, who,\nwith a starched face and prim air, said that he came to request in\nwriting the name of the officer who was dressed as a devil in the\nmasquerade of the night before.\n\nJack looked at his interrogator, and thought of the priests and the\ninquisition.  \"No, no,\" thought he, \"that won't do; a name I must give,\nbut it shall be one that you dare not meddle with.  A midshipman you\nmight get hold of, but it's more than the whole island dare to touch a\npost-captain of one of his Majesty's frigates.\"  So Jack took the paper\nand wrote Captain Henry Wilson, of his Majesty's ship _Aurora_.\n\nThe prim man made a prim bow, folded up the paper, and left the room.\n\nJack threw the waiter half a doubloon, lighted his cigar, and went on\nboard.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.\n\nIN WHICH THE OLD PROVERB IS ILLUSTRATED, \"THAT YOU MUST NOT COUNT YOUR\nCHICKENS BEFORE THEY ARE HATCHED.\"\n\nThe first lieutenant of the _Aurora_ was a very good officer in many\nrespects, but, as a midshipman, he had contracted the habit of putting\nhis hands in his pockets, and could never keep them out, even when the\nship was in a gale of wind; and hands are of some use in a heavy lurch.\nHe had more than once received serious injury from falling on these\noccasions, but habit was too powerful; and, although he had once broken\nhis leg by falling down the hatchway, and had moreover a large scar on\nhis forehead, received from being thrown to leeward against one of the\nguns, he still continued the practice; indeed, it was said that once,\nwhen it was necessary for him to go aloft, he had actually taken the two\nfirst rounds of the Jacob's ladder without withdrawing them, until,\nlosing his balance, he discovered that it was not quite so easy to go\naloft with his hands in his pockets.  In fact, there was no getting up\nhis hands, even when all hands were turned up.  He had another\npeculiarity, which was, that he had taken a peculiar fancy to a quack\nmedicine, called Enouy's Universal Medicine for all Mankind; and Mr\nPottyfar was convinced in his own mind that the label was no libel,\nexcept from the greatness of its truth.  In his opinion, it cured\neverything, and he spent one of his quarterly bills every year in\nbottles of this stuff; which he not only took himself every time he was\nunwell, but occasionally when quite well, to prevent his falling sick.\nHe recommended it to everybody in the ship, and nothing pleased him so\nmuch as to give a dose of it to every one who could be persuaded to take\nit.\n\nThe officers laughed at him, but it was generally behind his back, for\nhe became very angry if contradicted upon this one point, upon which he\ncertainly might be considered to be a little cracked.  He was\nindefatigable in making proselytes to his creed, and expatiated upon the\nvirtues of the medicine for an hour running, proving the truth of his\nassertion by a pamphlet, which, with his hands, he always carried in his\ntrousers pocket.\n\nJack reported himself when he came on board, and Mr Pottyfar, who was\non the quarter-deck at the time, expressed a hope that Mr Easy would\ntake his share of the duty, now that he had had such a spell on shore;\nto which Jack very graciously acceded, and then went down below, where\nhe found Gascoigne and his new messmates, with most of whom he was\nalready acquainted.\n\n\"Well, Easy,\" said Gascoigne, \"have you had enough of the shore?\"\n\n\"Quite,\" replied Jack, recollecting that after the events of the night\nbefore he was just as well on board; \"I don't intend to ask for any more\nleave.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it's quite as well, for Mr Pottyfar is not very liberal on\nthat score, I can tell you; there is but one way of getting leave from\nhim.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" replied Jack; \"and what is that?\"\n\n\"You must pretend that you are not well, take some of his quack\nmedicine, and then he will allow you a run on shore to work it off.\"\n\n\"Oh! that's it, is it? well then, as soon as we anchor in Valette, I'll\ngo through a regular course, but not till then.\"\n\n\"It ought to suit you, Jack; it's an equality medicine; cures one\ndisorder just as well as the other.\"\n\n\"Or kills--which levels all the patients.  You're right, Gascoigne, I\nmust patronise that stuff--for more reasons than one.  Who was that\nperson on deck in mufti?\"\n\n\"The mufti, Jack? in other words, the chaplain of the ship; but he's a\nprime sailor, nevertheless.\"\n\n\"How's that?\"\n\n\"Why, he was brought up on the quarter-deck, served his time, was acting\nlieutenant for two years, and then, somehow or other, he bore up for the\nchurch.\"\n\n\"Indeed--what were his reasons?\"\n\n\"No one knows--but they say he has been unhappy ever since.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because he did a very foolish thing, which cannot now be remedied.  He\nsupposed at the time that he would make a good parson, and now that he\nhas long got over his fit, he finds himself wholly unfit for it--he is\nstill the officer in heart, and is always struggling with his natural\nbent, which is very contrary to what a parson should feel.\"\n\n\"Why don't they allow parsons to be broke by a court-martial, and turned\nout of the service, or to resign their commissions, like other people?\"\n\n\"It won't do, Jack--they serve Heaven--there's a difference between that\nand serving his Majesty.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't understand these things.  When do we sail?\"\n\n\"The day after to-morrow.\"\n\n\"To join the fleet off Toulon?\"\n\n\"Yes; but I suppose we shall be driven on the Spanish coast going there.\nI never knew a man-of-war that was not.\"\n\n\"No; wind always blows from the South going up the Mediterranean.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you'll take another prize, Jack--mind you don't go away without\nthe articles of war.\"\n\n\"I won't go away without Mesty, if I can help it.  Oh, dear, how\nabominable a midshipman's berth is after a long run on shore!  I\npositively must go on deck and look at the shore, if I can do nothing\nelse.\"\n\n\"Why, ten minutes ago you had had enough of it.\"\n\n\"Yes, but ten minutes here has made me feel quite sick.  I shall go to\nthe first lieutenant for a dose.\"\n\n\"I say, Easy, we must both be physicked on the same day.\"\n\n\"To be sure; but stop till we get to Malta.\"\n\nJack went on deck, made acquaintance with the chaplain and some of the\nofficers whom he had not known, then climbed up into the maintop, where\nhe took a seat on the armolest, and, as he looked at the shore, thought\nover the events that had passed, until Agnes came to his memory, and he\nthought only of her.  When a mid is in love, he always goes aloft to\nthink of the object of his affection; why, I don't know, except that his\nreverie is not so likely to be disturbed by an order from a superior\nofficer.\n\nThe _Aurora_ sailed on the second day, and with a fine breeze, stood\nacross, making as much northing as easting; the consequence was, that\none fine morning they saw the Spanish coast before they saw the Toulon\nfleet.  Mr Pottyfar took his hands out of his pockets, because he could\nnot examine the coast through a telescope without so doing; but this, it\nis said, was the first time that he had done so on the quarter-deck from\nthe day that the ship had sailed from Port Mahon.  Captain Wilson was\nalso occupied with his telescope, so were many of the officers and\nmidshipmen, and the men at the mast-heads used their eyes, but there was\nnothing but a few small fishing-boats to be seen.  So they all went down\nto breakfast, as the ship was hove-to close in with the land.\n\n\"What will Easy bet,\" said one of the midshipmen, \"that we don't see a\nprize to-day?\"\n\n\"I will not bet that we do not see a vessel--but I'll bet you what you\nplease, that we do not take one before twelve o'clock at night.\"\n\n\"No, no, that won't do--just let the teapot travel over this way, for\nit's my forenoon watch.\"\n\n\"It's a fine morning,\" observed one of the mates, of the name of Martin;\n\"but I've a notion it won't be a fine evening.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" inquired another.\n\n\"I've now been eight years in the Mediterranean, and know something\nabout the weather.  There's a watery sky, and the wind is very steady.\nIf we are not under double-reefed topsails to-night, say I'm no\nconjuror.\"\n\n\"That you will be, all the same, if we are under bare poles,\" said\nanother.\n\n\"You're devilish free with your tongue, my youngster.  Easy, pull his\nears for me.\"\n\n\"Pull them easy, Jack, then,\" said the boy, laughing.\n\n\"All hands make sail!\" now resounded at the hatchways.\n\n\"There they are, depend upon it,\" cried Gascoigne, catching up his hat\nand bolting out of the berth, followed by all the others except Martin,\nwho had just been relieved, and thought that his presence in the waist\nmight be dispensed with for the short time, at least, which it took him\nto swallow a cup of tea.\n\nIt was very true; a galliot and four lateen vessels had just made their\nappearance round the easternmost point, and, as soon as they observed\nthe frigate, had hauled their wind.  In a minute the _Aurora_ was under\na press of canvas, and the telescopes were all directed to the vessels.\n\n\"All deeply laden, sir,\" observed Mr Hawkins, the chaplain; \"how the\ntopsail of the galliot is scored!\"\n\n\"They have a fresh breeze just now,\" observed Captain Wilson to the\nfirst lieutenant.\n\n\"Yes, sir, and it's coming down fast.\"\n\n\"Hands by the royal halyards, there.\"\n\nThe _Aurora_ careened with the canvas to the rapidly increasing breeze.\n\n\"Top-gallant sheet and halyards.\"\n\n\"Luff you may, quarter-master; luff, I tell you.  A small pull of that\nweather maintop-gallant brace--that will do,\" said the master.\n\n\"Top-men aloft there;--stand by to clew up the royals--and, Captain\nWilson, shall we take them in?--I'm afraid of that pole--it bends now\nlike a coach-whip,\" said Mr Pottyfar, looking up aloft, with his hands\nin both pockets.\n\n\"In royals--lower away.\"\n\n\"They are going about, sir,\" said the second lieutenant, Mr Haswell.\n\n\"Look out,\" observed the chaplain, \"it's coming.\"  Again the breeze\nincreased, and the frigate was borne down.\n\n\"Hands reef topsails in stays, Mr Pottyfar.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, sir--'bout ship.\"\n\nThe helm was put down and the topsails lowered and reefed in stays.\n\n\"Very well, my lads, very well indeed,\" said Captain Wilson.\n\nAgain the topsails were hoisted and top-gallant sheets home.  It was a\nstrong breeze, although the water was smooth, and the _Aurora_ dashed\nthrough at the rate of eight miles an hour, with her weather leeches\nlifting.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you so?\" said Martin to his mess-mates on the gangway;\n\"but there's more yet, my boys.\"\n\n\"We must take the top-gallant sails off her,\" said Captain Wilson,\nlooking aloft--for the frigate now careened to her bearings, and the\nwind was increasing and squally.  \"Try them a little longer;\" but\nanother squall came suddenly--the halyards were lowered, and the sails\nclewed up and furled.\n\nIn the meantime the frigate had rapidly gained upon the vessels, which\nstill carried on every stitch of canvas, making short tacks in-shore.\nThe _Aurora_ was again put about with her head towards them, and they\nwere not two points on her weather bow.  The sky, which had been clear\nin the morning, was now overcast, the sun was obscured with opaque white\nclouds, and the sea was rising fast.  Another ten minutes, and then they\nwere under double-reefed topsails, and the squalls were accompanied with\nheavy rain.  The frigate now dashed through the waves, foaming in her\ncourse and straining under the press of sail.  The horizon was so thick\nthat the vessels ahead were no longer to be seen.\n\n\"We shall have it, I expect,\" said Captain Wilson.\n\n\"Didn't I say so?\" observed Martin to Gascoigne.  \"We take no prizes\nthis day, depend upon it.\"\n\n\"We must have another hand to the wheel, sir, if you please,\" said the\nquarter-master, who was assisting the helmsman.\n\nMr Pottyfar, with his hands concealed as usual, stood by the capstern.\n\"I fear, sir, we cannot carry the mainsail much longer.\"\n\n\"No,\" observed the chaplain, \"I was thinking so.\"\n\n\"Captain Wilson, if you please, we are very close in,\" said the master:\n\"don't you think we had better go about?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr Jones.  Hands about ship--and--yes, by heavens, we must!--up\nmainsail.\"\n\nThe mainsail was taken off, and the frigate appeared to be immediately\nrelieved.  She no longer jerked and plunged as before.\n\n\"We're very near the land, Captain Wilson; thick as it is, I think I can\nmake out the loom of it--shall we wear round, sir?\" continued the\nmaster.\n\n\"Yes--hands wear ship--put the helm up.\"\n\nIt was but just in time, for, as the frigate flew round, describing a\ncircle, as she payed off before the wind, they could perceive the\nbreakers lashing the precipitous coast not two cables' length from them.\n\n\"I had no idea we were so near,\" observed the captain, compressing his\nlips--\"can they see anything of those vessels?\"\n\n\"I have not seen them this quarter of an hour, sir,\" replied the\nsignalman, protecting his glass from the rain under his jacket.\n\n\"How's her head now, quarter-master?\"\n\n\"South south-east, sir.\"\n\nThe sky now assumed a different appearance--the white clouds had been\nexchanged for others dark and murky, the wind roared at intervals, and\nthe rain came down in torrents.  Captain Wilson went down into the cabin\nto examine the barometer.\n\n\"The barometer has risen,\" said he on his return on deck.  \"Is the wind\nsteady?\"\n\n\"No, sir, she's up and off three points.\"\n\n\"This will end in a south-wester.\"\n\nThe wet and heavy sails now flapped from the shifting of the wind.\n\n\"Up with the helm, quarter-master.\"\n\n\"Up it is--she's off to south-by-west.\"\n\nThe wind lulled, the rain came down in a deluge--for a minute it was\nquite calm, and the frigate was on an even keel.\n\n\"Man the braces.  We shall be taken aback directly, depend upon it.\"\n\nThe braces were hardly stretched along before this was the case.  The\nwind flew round to the south-west with a loud roar, and it was fortunate\nthat they were prepared--the yards were braced round, and the master\nasked the captain what course they were to steer.\n\n\"We must give it up,\" observed Captain Wilson, holding on by the\nbelaying pin.  \"Shape our course for Cape Sicie, Mr Jones.\"\n\nAnd the _Aurora_ flew before the gale, under her foresail and topsails\nclose reefed.  The weather was now so thick that nothing could be\nobserved twenty yards from the vessel; the thunder pealed, and the\nlightning darted in every direction over the dark expanse.  The watch\nwas called as soon as the sails were trimmed, and all who could went\nbelow, wet, uncomfortable, and disappointed.\n\n\"What an old Jonah you are, Martin,\" said Gascoigne.\n\n\"Yes, I am,\" replied he; \"but we have the worst to come yet, in my\nopinion.  I recollect, not two hundred miles from where we are now, we\nhad just such a gale in the _Favourite_, and we as nearly went down,\nwhen--\"\n\nAt this moment a tremendous noise was heard above, a shock was felt\nthroughout the whole ship, which trembled fore and aft as if it were\nabout to fall into pieces; loud shrieks were followed by plaintive\ncries, the lower deck was filled with smoke, and the frigate was down on\nher beam ends.  Without exchanging a word, the whole of the occupants of\nthe berth flew out, and were up the hatchway, not knowing what to think,\nbut convinced that some dreadful accident had taken place.\n\nOn their gaining the deck it was at once explained; the foremast of the\nfrigate had been struck by lightning, had been riven into several\npieces, and had fallen over the larboard bow, carrying with it the main\ntopmast and jib-boom.  The jagged stump of the foremast was in flames,\nand burned brightly, notwithstanding the rain fell in torrents.  The\nship, as soon as the foremast and main topmast had gone overboard,\nbroached-to furiously, throwing the men over the wheel and dashing them\nsenseless against the carronades; the forecastle, the fore part of the\nmain deck, and even the lower deck, were spread with men, either killed\nor seriously wounded or insensible from the electric shock.  The frigate\nwas on her beam ends, and the sea broke furiously over her; all was dark\nas pitch, except the light from the blazing stump of the foremast,\nappearing like a torch, held up by the wild demons of the storm, or when\noccasionally the gleaming lightning cast a momentary glare, threatening\nevery moment to repeat its attack upon the vessel, while the deafening\nthunder burst almost on their devoted heads.  All was dismay and\nconfusion for a minute or two: at last Captain Wilson, who had himself\nlost his sight for a short time, called for the carpenter and axes--they\nclimbed up, that is, two or three of them, and he pointed to the\nmizzen-mast; the master was also there, and he cut loose the axes for\nthe seamen to use; in a few minutes the mizzen-mast fell over the\nquarter, and the helm being put hard up, the frigate payed off and\nslowly righted.  But the horror of the scene was not yet over.  The\nboatswain, who had been on the forecastle, had been led below, for his\nvision was gone for ever.  The men who lay scattered about had been\nexamined, and they were assisting them down to the care of the surgeon,\nwhen the cry of \"Fire!\" issued from the lower deck.  The ship had taken\nfire at the coal-hole and carpenter's storeroom, and the smoke that now\nascended was intense.\n\n\"Call the drummer,\" said Captain Wilson, \"and let him beat to quarters--\nall hands to their stations--let the pumps be rigged and the buckets\npassed along.  Mr Martin, see that the wounded men are taken down\nbelow.  Where's Mr Haswell?  Mr Pottyfar, station the men to pass the\nwater on by hand on the lower deck.  I will go there myself.  Mr Jones,\ntake charge of the ship.\"\n\nPottyfar, who actually had taken his hands out of his pockets, hastened\ndown to comply with the captain's orders on the main deck, as Captain\nWilson descended to the deck below.\n\n\"I say, Jack, this is very different from this morning,\" observed\nGascoigne.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Jack, \"so it is; but I say, Gascoigne, what's the best\nthing to do?--when the chimney's on fire on shore, they put a wet\nblanket over it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Gascoigne; \"but when the coal-hole's on fire on board,\nthey will not find that sufficient.\"\n\n\"At all events, wet blankets must be a good thing, Ned, so let us pull\nout the hammocks; cut the lanyards and get some out--we can but offer\nthem, you know, and if they do no good, at least it will show our zeal.\"\n\n\"Yes, Jack, and I think when they turn in again, those whose blankets\nyou take will agree with you that zeal makes the service very\nuncomfortable.  However, I think you are right.\"\n\nThe two midshipmen collected three or four hands, and in a very short\ntime they had more blankets than they could carry--there was no trouble\nin wetting them, for the main deck was afloat--and followed by the men\nthey had collected, Easy and Gascoigne went down with large bundles in\ntheir arms to where Captain Wilson was giving directions to the men.\n\n\"Excellent, Mr Easy! excellent, Mr Gascoigne;\" said Captain Wilson.\n\"Come, my lads, throw them over now, and stamp upon them well;\" the\nmen's jackets and the captain's coat had already been sacrificed to the\nsame object.\n\nEasy called the other midshipmen, and they went up for a further supply;\nbut there was no occasion, the fire had been smothered: still the danger\nhad been so great that the fore magazine had been floated.  During all\nthis, which lasted perhaps a quarter of an hour, the frigate had rolled\ngunwale under, and many were the accidents which occurred.  At last all\ndanger from fire had ceased, and the men were ordered to return to their\nquarters, when three officers and forty-seven men were found absent--\nseven of them were dead--most of them were already under the care of the\nsurgeon, but some were still lying in the scuppers.\n\nNo one had been more active or more brave during this time of danger\nthan Mr Hawkins the chaplain.  He was everywhere, and when Captain\nWilson went down to put out the fire he was there, encouraging the men\nand exerting himself most gallantly.  He and Mesty came aft when all was\nover, one just as black as the other.  The chaplain sat down and wrung\nhis hands--\"God forgive me!\" said he, \"God forgive me!\"\n\n\"Why so, sir?\" said Easy, who stood near, \"I am sure you need not be\nashamed of what you have done.\"\n\n\"No, no, not ashamed of what I've done; but, Mr Easy--I have sworn so,\nsworn such oaths at the men in my haste--I, the chaplain!  God forgive\nme!--I meant nothing.\"  It was very true that Mr Hawkins had sworn a\ngreat deal during his exertions, but he was at that time the\nquarter-deck officer and not the chaplain; the example to the men and\nhis gallantry had been most serviceable.\n\n\"Indeed, sir,\" said Easy, who saw that the chaplain was in great\ntribulation, and hoped to pacify him, \"I was certainly not there all the\ntime, but I only heard you say, `God bless you, my men! be smart,' and\nso on; surely, that is not swearing.\"\n\n\"Was it _that_ I said, Mr Easy, are you sure?  I really had an idea\nthat I had damned them all in heaps, as some of them deserved--no, no,\nnot deserved.  Did I really bless them--nothing but bless them?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Mesty, who perceived what Jack wanted; \"it was nothing,\nI assure you, but `God bless you, Captain Wilson!--Bless your heart, my\ngood men!--Bless the king!' and so on.  You do noting but shower down\nblessing and wet blanket.\"\n\n\"I told you so,\" said Jack.\n\n\"Well, Mr Easy, you've made me very happy,\" replied the chaplain; \"I\nwas afraid it was otherwise.\"\n\nSo indeed it was, for the chaplain had sworn like a boatswain; but, as\nJack and Mesty had turned all his curses into blessings, the poor man\ngave himself absolution, and shaking hands with Jack, hoped he would\ncome down into the gun-room and take a glass of grog; nor did he forget\nMesty, who received a good allowance at the gun-room door, to which Jack\ngladly consented, as the rum in the middy's berth had all been exhausted\nafter the rainy morning--but Jack was interrupted in his third glass, by\nsomebody telling him the captain wanted to speak with Mr Hawkins and\nwith him.\n\nJack went up and found the captain on the quarter-deck with the\nofficers.\n\n\"Mr Easy,\" said Captain Wilson, \"I have sent for you, Mr Hawkins, and\nMr Gascoigne, to thank you on the quarter-deck, for your exertions and\npresence of mind on this trying occasion.\"  Mr Hawkins made a bow.\nGascoigne said nothing, but he thought of having extra leave when they\narrived at Malta.  Jack felt inclined to make a speech, and began\nsomething about when there was danger that it levelled every one to an\nequality even on board of a man-of-war.\n\n\"By no means, Mr Easy,\" replied Captain Wilson, \"it does the very\ncontrary, for it proves which is the best man, and those who are the\nbest raise themselves at once above the rest.\"\n\nJack was very much inclined to argue the point, but he took the\ncompliment and held his tongue, which was the wisest thing he could have\ndone; so he made his bow, and was about to go down into the midshipmen's\nberth when the frigate was pooped by a tremendous sea, which washed all\nthose who did not hold on down into the waist.  Jack was among the\nnumber, and naturally catching at the first object which touched him, he\ncaught hold of the chaplain by the leg, who commenced swearing most\nterribly, but before he could finish the oath, the water, which had\nburst into the cabin through the windows--for the dead-lights, in the\nconfusion, had not yet been shipped--burst out the cross bulkheads,\nsweeping like a torrent the marine, the cabin-door, and everything else\nin its force, and floating Jack and the chaplain with several others\ndown the main hatchway on to the lower deck.  The lower deck being also\nfull of water, men and chests were rolling and tossing about, and Jack\nwas sometimes in company with the chaplain, and at other times\nseparated; at last they both recovered their legs, and gained the\nmidshipmen's berth, which, although afloat, was still a haven of\nsecurity.  Mr Hawkins spluttered and spit, and so did Jack, until he\nbegan to laugh.\n\n\"This is very trying, Mr Easy,\" said the chaplain: \"very trying indeed\nto the temper.  I hope I have not sworn--I hope not.\"\n\n\"Not a word,\" said Jack--\"I was close to you all the time--you only\nsaid, `God preserve us!'\"\n\n\"Only that?  I was afraid that I said `God damn it!'\"\n\n\"Quite a mistake, Mr Hawkins.  Let's go into the gun-room, and try to\nwash this salt water out of our mouths, and then I will tell you all you\nsaid, as far as I could hear it, word for word.\"\n\nSo Jack by this means got another glass of grog, which was very\nacceptable in his wet condition, and made himself very comfortable,\nwhile those on deck were putting on the dead-lights, and very busy\nsetting the goose-wings of the mainsail, to prevent the frigate from\nbeing pooped a second time.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY SIX.\n\nIN WHICH OUR HERO BECOMES EXCESSIVELY UNWELL, AND AGREES TO GO THROUGH A\nCOURSE OF MEDICINE.\n\nThe hammocks were not piped down that night: some were taken\nindiscriminately for the wounded, but the rest remained in the nettings,\nfor all hands were busy preparing jury-masts and jury-rigging, and Mr\nPottyfar was so well employed that, for twelve hours, his hands were not\nin his pockets.  It was indeed a dreadful night: the waves were\nmountains high, and chased the frigate in their fury, cresting,\nbreaking, and roaring at her taffrail; but she flew before them with the\nwings of the wind; four men at the helm assisted by others at the\nrelieving tackles below.  Jack, having been thanked on and washed off\nthe quarter-deck, thought that he had done quite enough; he was as deep\nas he could swim before he had satisfied all the scruples of the\nchaplain, and stowing himself away on one of the lockers of the\nmidshipmen's berth, was soon fast asleep, notwithstanding that the\nfrigate rolled gunwale under.  Gascoigne had done much better; he had\ntaken down a hammock, as he said, for a poor wounded man, hung it up,\nand turned in himself.  The consequence was, that the next morning the\nsurgeon, who saw him lying in the hammock, had put him down in the\nreport; but as Gascoigne had got up as well as ever, he laughed, and\nscratched his name out of the list of wounded.\n\nBefore morning, the ship had been pumped out dry, and all below made as\nsecure and safe as circumstances would permit; but the gale still\ncontinued its violence, and there was anything but comfort on board.\n\n\"I say, Martin, you ought to be thrown overboard,\" said Gascoigne; \"all\nthis comes from your croaking you're a Mother Carey's chicken.\"\n\n\"I wish I had been any one's chicken,\" replied Martin; \"but the devil a\nthing to nestle under have I had since I can well remember.\"\n\n\"What a bore to have no galley fire lighted,\" said one of the\nyoungsters, \"no tea, and not allowed any grog.\"\n\n\"The gale will last three days,\" replied Martin, \"and by that time we\nshall not be far from the admiral; it won't blow home there.\"\n\n\"Well, then, we shall be ordered in directly, and I shall go on shore\nto-morrow,\" replied Easy.\n\n\"Yes, if you're ill,\" replied Gascoigne.\n\n\"Never fear, I shall be sick enough: we shall be there at least six\nweeks, and then we'll forget all this.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Martin, \"we may forget it, but will the poor fellows\nwhose limbs are shrivelled forget it? and will poor Miles, the\nboatswain, who is blind for ever?\"\n\n\"Very true, Martin, we are thinking about ourselves, not thankful for\nour escape, and not feeling for others,\" replied Gascoigne.\n\n\"Give us your hand, Ned,\" said Jack Easy.  \"And, Martin, we ought to\nthank you for telling us the truth--we are a selfish set of fellows.\"\n\n\"Still we took our share with the others,\" replied one of the\nmidshipmen.\n\n\"That's more reason for us to be grateful and to pity them,\" replied\nJack; \"suppose you had lost your arm or your eyesight--we should have\npitied you; so now pity others.\"\n\n\"Well, so I do, now I think of it.\"\n\n\"Think oftener, youngster,\" observed Martin, going on deck.\n\nWhat a change from the morning of the day before!--but twenty-four hours\nhad passed away, and the sea had been smooth, the frigate dashed through\nthe blue water, proud in all her canvas, graceful as a swan.  Since\nthat, there had been fire, tempest, lightning, disaster, danger, and\ndeath; her masts were tossed about on the snowy waves hundreds of miles\naway from her--and she, a wreck, was rolling heavily, groaning and\ncomplaining in every timber as she urged her impetuous race with the\nfurious-running sea.\n\nHow wrong are those on shore who assert that sailors are not\nreligious!--how is it possible, supposing them to be possessed of\nfeeling, to be otherwise?  On shore, where you have nothing but the\nchange of seasons, each in his own peculiar beauty--nothing but the\nblessings of the earth, its fruit, its flowers--nothing but the bounty,\nthe comforts, the luxuries which have been invented, where you can rise\nin the morning in peace, and lay down your head at night in security--\nGod may be neglected and forgotten for a long time; but at sea, when\neach gale is a warning, each disaster acts as a check, each escape as a\nhomily upon the forbearance of Providence, that man must be indeed\nbrutalised who does not feel that God is there.  On shore we seldom view\nHim but in all His beauty and kindness; but at sea we are as often\nreminded how terrible He is in His wrath.  Can it be supposed that the\noccurrences of the last twenty-four hours were lost upon the mind of any\none man in that ship?  No, no.  In their courage and activity they might\nappear reckless, but in their hearts they acknowledged and bowed unto\ntheir God.\n\nBefore the day was over a jury-foremast had been got up, and sail having\nbeen put upon it, the ship was steered with greater ease and safety--the\nmain brace had been spliced to cheer up the exhausted crew, and the\nhammocks were piped down.\n\nAs Gascoigne had observed, some of the men were not very much pleased to\nfind that they were minus their blankets, but Captain Wilson ordered\ntheir losses to be supplied by the purser and expended by the master;\nthis quite altered the case, as they obtained new blankets in most cases\nfor old ones; but still it was impossible to light the galley fire, and\nthe men sat on their chests and nibbled biscuit.  By twelve o'clock that\nnight the gale broke, and more sail was necessarily put on the scudding\nvessel, for the sea still ran fast and mountains high.  At daylight the\nsun burst out and shone brightly on them, the sea went gradually down,\nthe fire was lighted, and Mr Pottyfar, whose hands were again in his\npockets, at twelve o'clock gave the welcome order to pipe to dinner.  As\nsoon as the men had eaten their dinner, the frigate was once more\nbrought to the wind, her jury-mast forward improved upon, and more sail\nmade upon it.  The next morning there was nothing of the gale left\nexcept the dire effects which it had produced, the black and riven stump\nof the foremost still holding up a terrific warning of the power and\nfury of the elements.\n\nThree days more, and the _Aurora_ joined the Toulon fleet.  When she was\nfirst seen it was imagined by those on board of the other ships that she\nhad been in action; but they soon learned that the conflict had been\nagainst more direful weapons than any yet invented by mortal hands.\nCaptain Wilson waited upon the admiral, and of course received immediate\norders to repair to port and refit.  In a few hours the _Aurora_ had\nshaped her course for Malta, and by sunset the Toulon fleet were no\nlonger in sight.\n\n\"By de holy poker, Massa Easy, but that terrible sort of gale the other\nday anyhow--I tink one time we all go to Davy Joney's lacker.\"\n\n\"Very true, Mesty; I hope never to meet with such another.\"\n\n\"Den, Massa Easy, why you go to sea?  When man ab no money, noting to\neat, den he go to sea, but everybody say you ab plenty money--why you\ncome to sea?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know,\" replied Jack thoughtfully; \"I came to sea on\naccount of equality and the rights of man.\"\n\n\"Eh, Massa Easy, you come to wrong place anyhow; now I tink a good deal\nlately, and by all de power, I tink equality all stuff.\"\n\n\"All stuff, Mesty, why? you used to think otherwise.\"\n\n\"Yes, Massa Easy, but den I boil de kettle for all young gentleman.  Now\ndat I ship's corporal and hab cane, I tink so no longer.\"\n\nJack made no reply, but he thought the more.  The reader must have\nperceived that Jack's notions of equality were rapidly disappearing; he\ndefended them more from habit, and perhaps a wilfulness which would not\nallow him to acknowledge himself wrong; to which may be added his love\nof argument.  Already he had accustomed himself to obedience to his\nsuperiors, and, notwithstanding his arguments, he would admit of no\nresistance from those below him; not that it was hardly ever attempted,\nfor Jack was anything but a tyrant, and was much beloved by all in the\nship.  Every day brought its lesson, and Captain Wilson was now\nsatisfied that Jack had been almost cured of the effects of his father's\nridiculous philosophy.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Mesty tapped his cane on the funnel, and\nrecommenced.\n\n\"Then why you stay at sea, Massa Easy?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Mesty; I don't dislike it.\"\n\n\"But, Massa Easy, why you stay in midshipman berth--eat hard biscuit,\nsalt pig, salt horse, when you can go shore, and live like gentleman?\nDat very foolish!  Why not be your own master?  By all power! suppose I\nhad money, catch me board ship.  Little sea very good, Massa Easy--open\none eyes; but tink of the lightning t'other night: poor massa boatswain,\nhe shut um eyes for ebber!\"\n\n\"Very true, Mesty.\"\n\n\"Me hope you tink of this, sar, and when you go on shore, you take Mesty\nwid you: he sarve you well, Massa Easy, long as he live, by de holy St.\nPatrick.  And den, Massa Easy, you marry wife--hab pickaninny--lib like\ngentleman.  You tink of this, Massa Easy.\"\n\nThe mention of the word marriage turned the thoughts of our hero to his\nAgnes, and he made no reply.  Mesty walked away, leaving our hero in\ndeep thought.\n\nThis conversation had more effect upon Jack than would have been\nimagined, and he very often found he was putting to himself the question\nof Mesty--\"Why do you stay at sea?\"  He had not entered the service with\nany particular view, except to find equality; and he could not but\nacknowledge to himself that, as Mesty observed, he had come to the wrong\nplace.  He had never even thought of staying to serve his time, nor had\nhe looked forward to promotion, and one day commanding a ship.  He had\nonly cared for the present, without indulging in a future anticipation\nof any reward, except in a union with Agnes.  Mesty's observations\noccasioned Jack to reflect upon the future for the first time in his\nlife; and he was always perplexed when he put the question of Mesty, and\ntried to answer to himself as to what were his intentions in remaining\nin the service.\n\nNevertheless, Jack did his duty very much to the satisfaction of Mr\nPottyfar; and after a tedious passage, from baffling and light winds,\nthe _Aurora_ arrived at Malta.  Our hero had had some conversation with\nhis friend Gascoigne, in which he canvassed his future plans; all of\nwhich, however, ended in one settled point, which was that he was to\nmarry Agnes.  As for the rest, Gascoigne was of opinion that Jack ought\nto follow up the service, and become a captain, but there was plenty of\ntime to think about that, as he observed, now all they had to consider\nwas how to get on shore; for the refitting of the ship was an excuse for\ndetaining them on board, which they knew Mr Pottyfar would avail\nhimself of.  Jack dined in the gun-room on the day of their arrival, and\nhe resolved that he would ask that very evening.  Captain Wilson was\nalready on shore at the Governor's.  Now, there had been a little\ndifference of opinion between Mr Pottyfar and Mr Hawkins, the\nchaplain, on a point of seamanship; and most of the officers sided with\nthe chaplain, who, as we have before observed, was a first-rate seaman.\nIt had ended in high words, for Mr Hawkins had forgotten himself so far\nas to tell the first lieutenant that he had a great deal to learn, not\nhaving even got over the midshipman's trick of keeping his hands in his\npockets; and Mr Pottyfar had replied that it was very well for him as\nchaplain to insult others, knowing that his cassock protected him.  This\nwas a bitter reply to Mr Hawkins, who at the very time that the\ninsinuation made his blood boil, was also reminded that his profession\nforbade a retort: he rushed into his cabin, poor fellow, having no other\nmethod left, vented his indignation in tears, and then consoled himself\nby degrees with prayer.  In the meantime, Mr Pottyfar had gone on deck,\nwroth with Hawkins and his messmates, as well as displeased with\nhimself.  He was, indeed, in a humour to be pleased with nobody, and in\na most unfortunate humour to be asked leave by a midshipman.\nNevertheless, Jack politely took off his hat, and requested leave to go\non shore and see his friend the Governor.  Upon which Mr Pottyfar\nturned round to him, with his feet spread wide open, and thrusting his\nhands to the very bottom of his pockets, as if in determination, said,\n\"Mr Easy, you know the state of the ship; we have everything to do--new\nmasts, new rigging, everything almost to refit--and yet you ask to go on\nshore!  Now, sir, you may take this answer for yourself and all the\nother midshipmen in the ship, that not one soul of you puts his foot on\nshore until we are all a-taunto.\"\n\n\"Allow me to observe, sir,\" said our hero, \"that it is very true that\nall our services may be required when the duty commences, but this being\nSaturday night, and to-morrow Sunday, the frigate will not be even moved\ntill Monday morning; and as the work cannot begin before that, I trust\nyou will permit leave until that time.\"\n\n\"My opinion is different, sir,\" replied the first lieutenant.\n\n\"Perhaps, sir, you will allow me to argue the point,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"No, sir, I never allow argument; walk over to the other side of the\ndeck, if you please.\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly, sir,\" said Jack, \"if you wish it.\"\n\nJack's first idea was to go on shore without leave, but from this he was\npersuaded by Gascoigne, who told him that it would displease Captain\nWilson, and that old Tom, the Governor, would not receive him.  Jack\nagreed to this, and then, after a flourish about the rights of man,\ntyranny, oppression, and so forth, he walked forward to the forecastle,\nwhere he found his friend Mesty, who had heard all that had passed, and\nwho insidiously said to him in a low tone:\n\n\"Why you stay at sea, Massa Easy?\"\n\n\"Why, indeed,\" thought Jack, boiling with indignation, \"to be cooped up\nhere at the will of another?  I am a fool--Mesty is right--I'll ask for\nmy discharge to-morrow.\"  Jack went down below and told Gascoigne what\nhe had determined to do.\n\n\"You'll do no such thing, Jack,\" replied Gascoigne \"depend upon it,\nyou'll have plenty of leave in a day or two.  Pottyfar was in a pet with\nthe chaplain, who was too much for him.  Captain Wilson will be on board\nby nine o'clock.\"\n\nNevertheless, Jack walked his first watch in the _magnificents_, as all\nmiddies do when they cannot go on shore, and turned in at twelve\no'clock, with the resolution of sticking to his purpose, and quitting\nhis Majesty's service; in fact, of presenting his Majesty with his\nbetween two and three years' time, served as midshipman, all free,\ngratis, and for nothing, except his provisions and his pay, which some\ncaptains are bold enough to assert that they not only are not worth, but\nnot even the salt that accompanies it; forgetting that they were once\nmidshipmen themselves, and at the period were, of course, about the same\nvalue.\n\nThe next morning Captain Wilson came off; the ship's company were\nmustered, the service read by Mr Hawkins, and Jack, as soon as all the\nofficial duties were over, was about to go up to the captain, when the\ncaptain said to him:\n\n\"Mr Easy, the Governor desired me to bring you on shore to dine with\nhim, and he has a bed at your service.\"\n\nJack touched his hat, and ran down below, to make his few preparations.\n\nBy the time that Mesty, who had taken charge of his chest, etcetera, had\nput his necessaries in the boat, Jack had almost made up his mind that\nhis Majesty should not be deprived yet awhile of so valuable an officer.\nJack returned on deck, and found that the captain was not yet ready; he\nwent up to Mr Pottyfar, and told him that the captain had ordered him\nto go on shore with him; and Mr Pottyfar, who had quite got over his\nspleen, said:\n\n\"Very well, Mr Easy--I wish you a great deal of pleasure.\"\n\n\"This is very different from yesterday,\" thought Jack; \"suppose I try\nthe medicine?\"\n\n\"I am not very well, Mr Pottyfar, and those pills of the doctor's don't\nagree with me--I always am ill if I am long without air and exercise.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" said the first lieutenant, \"people require air and\nexercise.  I've no opinion of the doctor's remedies; the only thing that\nis worth a farthing is the universal medicine.\"\n\n\"I should so long to try it, sir,\" replied Jack; \"I read the book one\nday, and it said that if you took it daily for a fortnight or three\nweeks, and with plenty of air and exercise, it would do wonders.\"\n\n\"And it's very true,\" replied Mr Pottyfar, \"and if you'd like to try it\nyou shall--I have plenty--shall I give you a dose now?\"\n\n\"If you please, sir,\" replied Jack; \"and tell me how often I am to take\nit, for my head aches all day.\"\n\nMr Pottyfar took Jack down, and putting into his hand three or four\nbottles of the preparation, told him that he was to take thirty drops at\nnight, when he went to bed, not to drink more than two glasses of wine,\nand to avoid the heat of the sun.\n\n\"But, sir,\" replied Jack, who had put the bottles in his pocket, \"I am\nafraid that I cannot take it for long; for as the ship is ready for\nfitting, I shall be exposed to the sun all day.\"\n\n\"Yes, if you are wanted, Mr Easy; but we have plenty here without you;\nand when you are unwell you cannot be expected to work.  Take care of\nyour health; and I trust, indeed I am sure, that you will find this\nmedicine wonderfully efficacious.\"\n\n\"I will begin to-night, sir, if you please,\" replied Jack, \"and I am\nvery much obliged to you.  I sleep at the Governor's--shall I come on\nboard to-morrow morning?\"\n\n\"No, no; take care of yourself, and get well; I shall be glad to hear\nthat you get better.  Send me word how it acts.\"\n\n\"I will, sir, send you word by the boat every day,\" replied Jack,\ndelighted; \"I am very much obliged to you, sir.  Gascoigne and I were\nthinking of asking you, but did not like to do so: he, poor fellow,\nsuffers from headaches almost as bad as I do, and the doctor's pills are\nof no use to him.\"\n\n\"He shall have some, too, Mr Easy.  I thought he looked pale.  I'll see\nto it this afternoon.  Recollect, moderate exercise, Mr Easy, and avoid\nthe sun at midday.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Jack, \"I'll not forget;\" and off went Jack,\ndelighted.  He ordered Mesty to put up his whole portmanteau instead of\nthe small bundle he put into the boat, and telling Gascoigne what a\nspoke he had put into his wheel, was soon in the boat with the captain,\nand went on shore, where he was cordially greeted by the Governor.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN.\n\nIN WHICH CAPTAIN WILSON IS REPAID WITH INTEREST FOR JACK'S BORROWING HIS\nNAME; PROVING THAT A GOOD NAME IS AS GOOD AS A LEGACY.\n\n\"Well, Jack, my boy, have you any long story ready for me?\" inquired the\nGovernor.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Jack, \"I have one or two very good ones.\"\n\n\"Very well, we'll hear them after dinner,\" replied old Tom.  \"In the\nmeantime find out your room and take possession.\"\n\n\"That must not be for very long, Governor,\" observed Captain Wilson.\n\"Mr Easy must learn his duty, and there is a good opportunity now.\"\n\n\"If you please, sir,\" replied Jack, \"I'm on the sick-list.\"\n\n\"Sick-list,\" said Captain Wilson; \"you were not in the report that Mr\nWilson gave me this morning.\"\n\n\"No, I'm on Mr Pottyfar's list; and I'm going through a course of the\nuniversal medicine.\"\n\n\"What's all this, Jack--what's all this?--there's some story here--don't\nbe afraid of the captain--you've me to back you,\" said the Governor.\n\nJack was not at all afraid of the captain, so he told him how the\nfirst-lieutenant had refused him leave the evening before, and how he\nhad now given him permission to remain, and try the universal medicine,\nat which the Governor laughed heartily, nor could Captain Wilson refrain\nfrom joining.\n\n\"But, Mr Easy,\" replied the captain, after a pause, \"if Mr Pottyfar\nwill allow you to stay on shore, I cannot--you have your duty to learn.\nYou must be aware that now is your time, and you must not lose\nopportunities that do not occur every day.  You must acknowledge the\ntruth of what I say.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Jack, \"I admit it all, provided I do intend to\nfollow the profession;\" and so saying, our hero bowed, and left the\nveranda where they had been talking.\n\nThis hint of Jack's, thrown out by him more with the intention of\npreventing his being sent on board than with any definite idea, was not\nlost upon either the captain or the Governor.\n\n\"Does he jib, then?\" observed the Governor.\n\n\"On the contrary, I never knew him more attentive and so entirely\ngetting rid of his former notions.  He has behaved most nobly in the\ngale, and there has not been one complaint against him--I never was more\nastonished--he must have meant something.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what he means, Wilson--that he does not like to be sent\non board, nothing more.  He's not to be cooped up--you may lead him, but\nnot drive him.\"\n\n\"Yes, but the service will not admit of it.  I never could allow it--he\nmust do his duty like the rest, and conform to the rules.\"\n\n\"Exactly, so he must; but look ye, Wilson, you must not lose him: it's\nall easily settled--appoint him your orderly midshipman to and from the\nship; that will be employment, and he can always remain here at night.\nI will tell him that I have asked, as a favour, what I now do, and leave\nme to find out what he is thinking about.\"\n\n\"It may be done that way, certainly,\" replied Captain Wilson, musing;\n\"and you are more likely to get his intentions from him than I am.  I am\nafraid he has too great a command of money ever to be fond of the ship;\nit is the ruin of a junior officer to be so lavishly supplied.\"\n\n\"He's a long way from ruin yet, Wilson--he's a very fine fellow, even by\nyour own acknowledgment.  You humoured him out of gratitude to his\nfather, when he first came into the service; humour him a little now to\nkeep him in it.  Besides, if your first lieutenant is such a fool with\nhis universal medicine, can you wonder at a midshipman taking advantage\nof it?\"\n\n\"No, but I ought not to allow him to do so with my eyes open.\"\n\n\"He has made it known to you upon honour, and you ought not to take\nadvantage of his confidence: but still what I proposed would, I think,\nbe the best, for then he will be at his duty in a way that will suit all\nparties.  You, because you employ him on service--the first lieutenant,\nbecause Jack can take his medicine--and Jack, because he can dine with\nme every day.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose it must be so,\" replied Captain Wilson, laughing; \"but\nstill, I trust, you will discover what is working in his mind to induce\nhim to give me that answer, Governor.\"\n\n\"Never fear, Jack shall confess, and lay his soul as bare as that of a\nCatholic bigot before his padre.\"\n\nThe party sat down to dinner, and what with the Governor's aide-de-camp\nand those invited, it was pretty numerous.  After the cloth had been\nremoved, the Governor called upon Jack for his stories, whereupon, much\nto the surprise of Captain Wilson, who had never heard one word of it,\nfor the admiral had not mentioned anything about it to him during the\nshort time the _Aurora_ was with the Toulon fleet, our hero gave the\nGovernor and the company the narrative of all that happened in the _Mary\nAnn_ transport--the loves of Captain Hogg and Miss Hicks--the adventures\nof Gascoigne--and his plan, by which he baulked them all.  The Governor\nwas delighted, and Captain Wilson not a little astonished.\n\n\"You prevented a very foolish thing, Mr Easy, and behaved very well,\"\nobserved the captain, laughing again at the idea; \"but you never told me\nof all this.\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied Jack, \"I have always reserved my stories for the\nGovernor's table, where I am sure to meet you, and then telling once\ndoes for all.\"\n\nJack received his appointment as orderly midshipman, and everything went\non well; for, of his own accord, he stayed on board the major part of\nthe day to learn his duty, which very much pleased the captain and Mr\nPottyfar.  In this Jack showed a great deal of good sense, and Captain\nWilson did not repent of the indulgence he had shown him.  Jack's health\nimproved daily, much to Mr Pottyfar's satisfaction, who imagined that\nhe took the universal medicine night and morning.  Gascoigne also was a\npatient under the first lieutenant's hands, and often on shore with our\nhero, who thought no more of quitting the service.\n\nFor seven weeks they had now remained in harbour, for even the masts had\nto be made, when, one day, Captain Wilson opened a letter he received at\nbreakfast-time, and having read it, laid it down with the greatest\nsurprise depicted in his countenance.  \"Good heavens! what can this\nmean?\" said he.\n\n\"What's the matter, Wilson?\" said the Governor.\n\n\"Just hear its contents, Sir Thomas.\"\n\nCaptain Wilson then read in Spanish as follows:--\n\n\"HONOURABLE SIR:--\n\n\"It is my duty to advise you that the Honourable Lady Signora Alforgas\nde Guzman, now deceased, has, in her testament, bequeathed to you the\nsum of one thousand doubloons in gold as a testimony of your kind\nservices on the night of the 12th of August.  If you will authorise any\nmerchant here to receive the money, it shall be paid forthwith, or\nremitted in any way you please to appoint.  May you live a thousand\nyears.\n\n\"Your most obedient servant:--\n\n\"ALFONZO XEREZ.\"\n\nJack heard the letter read, rose quietly, whistled low, as if not\nattending to it, and then slipped out of the room, unperceived by the\nGovernor or Captain Wilson.\n\nThe fact was, that although Jack had longed to tell the Governor about\nhis adventures after the masquerade, he did not like yet awhile, until\nhe was sure that there were no consequences--because he had given the\ncaptain's name instead of his own.  As soon as he heard the letter read,\nhe at once perceived that it had been the old lady, and not the priests,\nwho had made the inquiry, and that by giving Captain Wilson's name he\nhad obtained for him this fine legacy.  Jack was delighted, but still\npuzzled, so he walked out of the room to reflect a little.\n\n\"What can it mean?\" said Captain Wilson.  \"I never rendered any services\nto any one on the 12th of August or after it.  It is some mistake--12th\nof August--that was the day of the grand masquerade.\"\n\n\"A lucky one for you, at all events--for you know, mistake or not, no\none else can touch the legacy.  It can only be paid to you.\"\n\n\"I never heard of anything taking place at the masquerade--I was there,\nbut I left early, for I was not very well.  Mr Easy,\" said Captain\nWilson, turning round, but Jack was gone.\n\n\"Was he at the masquerade?\" asked the Governor.\n\n\"Yes, I know he was, for the first lieutenant told me that he requested\nnot to come on board till the next day.\"\n\n\"Depend upon it,\" replied the Governor, striking his fist upon the\ntable, \"that Jack's at the bottom of it.\"\n\n\"I should not be surprised at his being at the bottom of anything,\"\nreplied Captain Wilson, laughing.\n\n\"Leave it to me, Wilson, I'll find it out.\"\n\nAfter a little more conversation, Captain Wilson went on board, leaving\nJack on purpose that the Governor might pump him.  But this Sir Thomas\nhad no occasion to do, for Jack had made up his mind to make the\nGovernor his confidant, and he immediately told him the whole story.\nThe Governor held his sides at our hero's description, especially at his\nruse of giving the captain's name instead of his own.\n\n\"You'll kill me, Jack, before you've done with me,\" said old Tom, at\nlast; \"but now what is to be done?\"\n\nOur hero now became grave; he pointed out to the Governor that he\nhimself had plenty of money, and would come into a large fortune, and\nthat Captain Wilson was poor, with a large family.  All Jack wished the\nGovernor to manage was, that Captain Wilson might consent to accept the\nlegacy.\n\n\"Right, boy, right! you're my own boy,\" replied the Governor; \"but we\nmust think of this, for Wilson is the very soul of honour, and there may\nbe some difficulty about it.  You have told nobody?\"\n\n\"Not a soul but you, Sir Thomas.\"\n\n\"It never will do to tell him all this, Jack, for he would insist that\nthe legacy belonged to you.\"\n\n\"I have it, sir,\" replied Jack.  \"When I was going into the masquerade,\nI offered to hand this very old lady, who was covered with diamonds, out\nof her carriage, and she was so frightened at my dress of a devil, that\nshe would have fallen down had it not been for Captain Wilson, who\nsupported her, and she was very thankful to him.\"\n\n\"You are right, Jack,\" replied the Governor, after a short pause; \"that\nwill, I think, do.  I must tell him the story of the friars, because I\nswore you had something to do with it--but I'll tell him no more: leave\nit all to me.\"\n\nCaptain Wilson returned in the afternoon, and found the Governor in the\nveranda.\n\n\"I have had some talk with young Easy,\" said the Governor, \"and he has\ntold me a strange story about that night, which he was afraid to tell to\neverybody.\"\n\nThe Governor then narrated the history of the friars and the will.\n\n\"Well, but,\" observed Captain Wilson, \"the history of that will afford\nno clue to the legacy.\"\n\n\"No, it does not; but still, as I said, Jack had a hand in this.  He\nfrightened the old lady as a devil, and you caught her in your arms and\nsaved her from falling, so he had a hand in it, you see.\"\n\n\"I do now remember that I did save a very dowager-like old personage\nfrom falling at the sight of a devil, who, of course, must have been our\nfriend Easy.\"\n\n\"Well, and that accounts for the whole of it.\"\n\n\"A thousand doubloons for picking up an old lady!\"\n\n\"Yes, why not?--have you not heard of a man having a fortune left him\nfor merely opening the pew-door of a church to an old gentleman?\"\n\n\"Yes, but it appears so strange.\"\n\n\"There's nothing strange in this world, Wilson, nothing at all--we may\nslave for years and get no reward, and do a trifle out of politeness and\nbecome independent.  In my opinion, this mystery is unravelled.  The old\nlady, for I knew the family, must have died immensely rich: she knew you\nin your full uniform, and she asked your name; a heavy fall would have\nbeen to one so fat a most serious affair; you saved her, and she has\nrewarded you handsomely.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Captain Wilson, \"as I can give no other explanation, I\nsuppose yours is the correct one; but it's hardly fair to take a\nthousand doubloons from her relations merely for an act of civility.\"\n\n\"You really are quite ridiculous; the old lady owned half Murcia, to my\nknowledge.  It is no more to them than any one leaving you a suit of\nmourning in an English legacy.  I wish you joy; it will help you with a\nlarge family, and in justice to them you are bound to take it.\nEverybody does as he pleases with his own money,--depend upon it, you\nsaved her from breaking her leg short off at the hip joint.\"\n\n\"Upon that supposition I presume I must accept of the legacy,\" replied\nCaptain Wilson, laughing.\n\n\"Of course, send for it at once.  The rate of exchange is now high.  I\nwill give you government bills, which will make it nearly four thousand\npounds.\"\n\n\"Four thousand pounds for preventing an old woman from falling,\" replied\nCaptain Wilson.\n\n\"Devilish well paid, Wilson, and I congratulate you.\"\n\n\"For how much am I indebted to the father of young Easy!\" observed\nCaptain Wilson, after a silence of some minutes; \"if he had not assisted\nme when I was appointed to a ship, I should not have gained my\npromotion--nor three thousand pounds I have made in prize-money--the\ncommand of a fine frigate--and now four thousand pounds in a windfall.\"\n\nThe Governor thought that he was more indebted to Jack than to his\nfather for some of these advantages, but he was careful not to point\nthem out.\n\n\"It's very true,\" observed the Governor, \"that Mr Easy was of service\nto you when you were appointed; but allow me to observe that for your\nship, your prize-money, and for your windfall, you have been wholly\nindebted to your own gallantry in both senses of the word; still Mr\nEasy is a fine generous fellow, and so is his son, I can tell you.\nBy-the-bye, I had a long conversation with him the other day.\"\n\n\"About himself?\"\n\n\"Yes, all about himself.  He appears to me to have come into the service\nwithout any particular motive, and will be just as likely to leave it in\nthe same way.  He appears to be very much in love with that Sicilian\nnobleman's daughter.  I find that he has written to her, and to her\nbrother, since he has been here.\"\n\n\"That he came into the service in search of what he never will find in\nthis world, I know very well; and I presume that he has found that out--\nand that he will follow up the service is also very doubtful; but I do\nnot wish that he should leave it yet; it is doing him great good,\"\nreplied Captain Wilson.\n\n\"I agree with you there--I have great influence with him, and he shall\nstay yet awhile.  He is heir to a very large fortune, is he not?\"\n\n\"A clear eight thousand pounds a year, if not more.\"\n\n\"If his father dies he must, of course, leave: a midshipman with eight\nthousand pounds a year would indeed be an anomaly.\"\n\n\"That the service could not permit.  It would be as injurious to himself\nas it would to others about him.  At present, he has almost, indeed I\nmay say quite, an unlimited command of money.\"\n\n\"That's bad, very bad.  I wonder he behaves so well as he does.\"\n\n\"And so do I: but he really is a very superior lad, with all his\npeculiarities, and a general favourite with those whose opinions and\nfriendship are worth having.\"\n\n\"Well, don't curb him up too tight--for really he does not require it.\nHe goes very well in a snaffle.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT.\n\n\"PHILOSOPHY MADE EASY\" UPON AGRARIAN PRINCIPLES, THE SUBJECT OF SOME\nUNEASINESS TO OUR HERO--THE FIRST APPEARANCE, BUT NOT THE LAST, OF AN\nIMPORTANT PERSONAGE.\n\nThe conversation was here interrupted by a mail from England which they\nhad been expecting.  Captain Wilson retired with his letters; the\nGovernor remained equally occupied; and our hero received the first\nletter ever written to him by his father.  It ran as follows:--\n\n\"MY DEAR SON:--\n\n\"I have many times taken up my pen with the intention of letting you\nknow how things went on in this country.  But as I can perceive around\nbut one dark horizon of evil, I have as often laid it down again without\nventuring to make you unhappy with such bad intelligence.\n\n\"The account of your death, and also of your unexpectedly being yet\nspared to us, were duly received, and I trust, I mourned and rejoiced on\neach occasion with all the moderation characteristic of a philosopher.\nIn the first instance I consoled myself with the reflection that the\nworld you had left was in a state of slavery and pressed down by the\niron arm of despotism, and that to die was gain, not only in all the\nparson tells us, but also in our liberty; and, at the second\nintelligence, I moderated my joy for nearly about the same reasons,\nresolving, notwithstanding what Dr Middleton may say, to die as I have\nlived, a true philosopher.\n\n\"The more I reflect the more am I convinced that there is nothing\nrequired to make this world happy but equality, and the rights of man\nbeing duly observed--in short, that everything and everybody should be\nreduced to one level.  Do we not observe that it is the law of nature--\ndo not brooks run into rivers--rivers into seas--mountains crumble down\nupon the plains?--are not the seasons contented to equalise the parts of\nthe earth?  Why does the sun run round the ecliptic, instead of the\nequator, but to give an equal share of his heat to both sides of the\nworld?  Are we not all equally born in misery? does not death level us\nall _aequo pede_, as the poet hath? are we not all equally hungry,\nthirsty, and sleepy, and thus levelled by our natural wants?  And such\nbeing the case, ought we not to have our equal share of good things in\nthis world, to which we have an undoubted equal right?  Can any argument\nbe more solid or more level than this, whatever nonsense Dr Middleton\nmay talk?\n\n\"Yes, my son, if it were not that I still hope to see the sun of Justice\narise, and disperse the manifold dark clouds which obscure the land--if\nI did not still hope, in my time, to see an equal distribution of\nproperty--an Agrarian law passed by the House of Commons, in which all\nshould benefit alike--I would not care how soon I left this vale of\ntears, created by tyranny and injustice.  At present, the same system is\ncarried on; the nation is taxed for the benefit of the few, and it\ngroans under oppression and despotism; but I still do think that there\nis, if I may fortunately express myself, a bright star in the west; and\nsigns of the times which comfort me.  Already we have had a good deal of\nincendiarism about the country, and some of the highest aristocracy have\npledged themselves to raise the people above themselves, and have\nadvised sedition and conspiracy; have shown to the debased and\nunenlightened multitude that their force is physically irresistible, and\nrecommended them to make use of it, promising that if they hold in\npower, they will only use that power to the abolition of our farce of a\nconstitution, of a church, and of a king; and that if the nation is to\nbe governed at all, it shall only be governed by the many.  This is\ncheering.  Hail, patriot lords! all hail!  I am in hopes yet the great\nwork will be achieved, in spite of the laughs and sneers and shakes of\nthe head which my arguments still meet with from that obstinate fellow\nDr Middleton.\n\n\"Your mother is in a quiet way; she has given over reading and working,\nand even her knitting, as useless; and she now sits all day long at the\nchimney corner twiddling her thumbs, and waiting, as she says, for the\nmillennium.  Poor thing! she is very foolish with her ideas upon this\nmatter, but as usual I let her have her own way in every thing, copying\nthe philosopher of old, who was tied to his Xantippe.\n\n\"I trust, my dear son, that your principles have strengthened with your\nyears and fortified with your growth, and that, if necessary, you will\nsacrifice all to obtain what in my opinion will prove to be the real\nmillennium.  Make all the converts you can, and believe me to be, your\naffectionate father and true guide:--\n\n\"NICODEMUS EASY.\"\n\nJack, who was alone, shook his head as he read this letter, and then\nlaid it down with a pish!  He did it involuntarily, and was surprised at\nhimself when he found that he had so done.  \"I should like to argue the\npoint,\" thought Jack, in spite of himself; and then he threw the letter\non the table, and went into Gascoigne's room, displeased with his father\nand with himself.  He asked Ned whether he had received any letters from\nEngland, and it being dinner-time, went back to dress.  On his coming\ndown into the receiving-room with Gascoigne, the Governor said to them:\n\n\"As you two both speak Italian, you must take charge of a Sicilian\nofficer who has come here with letters of introduction to me, and who\ndines here to-day.\"\n\nBefore dinner they were introduced to the party in question, a\nslight-made, well-looking young man, but still there was an expression\nin his countenance which was not agreeable.  In compliance with the\nwishes of the Governor, Don Mathias, for so he was called, was placed\nbetween our two midshipmen, who immediately entered into conversation\nwith him, being themselves anxious to make inquiries about their friends\nat Palermo.  In the course of conversation Jack inquired of him whether\nhe was acquainted with Don Rebiera, to which the Sicilian answered in\nthe affirmative, and they talked about the different members of the\nfamily.  Don Mathias, towards the close of the dinner, inquired of Jack\nby what means he had become acquainted with Don Rebiera, and Jack, in\nreply, narrated how he and his friend Gascoigne had saved him from being\nmurdered by two villains; after this reply the young officer appeared to\nbe less inclined for conversation, but before the party broke up\nrequested to have the acquaintance of our two midshipmen.  As soon as he\nwas gone, Gascoigne observed in a reflective way, \"I have seen that face\nbefore, but where I cannot exactly say; but you know, Jack, what a\nmemory of people I have, and I have seen him before, I am sure.\"\n\n\"I can't recollect that ever I have,\" replied our hero, \"but I never\nknew any one who could recollect in that way as you do.\"\n\nThe conversation was then dropped between them, and Jack was for some\ntime listening to the Governor and Captain Wilson, for the whole party\nwere gone away, when Gascoigne, who had been in deep thought since he\nhad made the observation to Jack, sprang up.\n\n\"I have him at last!\" cried he.\n\n\"Have who?\" demanded Captain Wilson.\n\n\"That Sicilian officer--I could have sworn that I had seen him before.\"\n\n\"That Don Mathias?\"\n\n\"No, Sir Thomas!  He is not Don Mathias!  He is the very Don Silvio who\nwas murdering Don Rebiera, when we came to his assistance and saved\nhim.\"\n\n\"I do believe you are right, Gascoigne.\"\n\n\"I'm positive of it,\" replied Gascoigne; \"I never made a mistake in my\nlife.\"\n\n\"Bring me those letters, Easy,\" said the Governor, \"and let us see what\nthey say of him.  Here it is--Don Mathias de Alayeres.  You may be\nmistaken, Gascoigne; it's a heavy charge you are making against this\nyoung man.\"\n\n\"Well, Sir Thomas, if that is not Don Silvio, I'd forfeit my commission\nif I had it here in my hand.  Besides, I observed the change in his\ncountenance when we told him it was Easy and I who had come to Don\nRebiera's assistance; and did you observe after that, Easy, that he\nhardly said a word?\"\n\n\"Very true,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"Well, well, we must see to this,\" observed the Governor; \"if so, this\nletter of introduction must be a forgery.\"\n\nThe party then retired to bed, and the next morning, while Easy was in\nGascoigne's room talking over their suspicions, letters from Palermo\nwere brought up to him.  They were in answer to those written by Jack on\nhis arrival at Malta: a few lines from Don Rebiera, a small note from\nAgnes, and a voluminous detail from his friend Don Philip, who informed\nhim of the good health of all parties and of their good-will towards\nhim; of Agnes being as partial as ever; of his having spoken plainly, as\nhe had promised Jack, to his father and mother relative to the mutual\nattachment; of their consent being given, and then withheld, because\nFather Thomas, their confessor, would not listen to the union of Agnes\nwith a heretic; but, nevertheless, telling Jack this would be got over\nthrough the medium of his brother and himself, who were determined that\ntheir sister and he should not be made unhappy about such a trifle.  But\nthe latter part of the letter contained intelligence equally important,\nwhich was, that Don Silvio had again attempted the life of their father,\nand would have succeeded, had not Father Thomas, who happened to be\nthere, thrown himself between them.  That Don Silvio in his rage had\nactually stabbed the confessor, although the wound was not dangerous.\nThat, in consequence of this, all further lenity was denied to him, and\nthat the authorities were in search of him to award him the punishment\ndue to murder and sacrilege.  That up to the present they could not find\nhim, and it was supposed that he had made his escape to Malta in one of\nthe speronares.\n\nSuch were the contents of the letter, which were immediately\ncommunicated to the Governor and Captain Wilson, upon their meeting at\nbreakfast.\n\n\"Very well, we must see to this,\" observed the Governor, who then made\nhis inquiries as to the other intelligence contained in the letters.\n\nJack and Gascoigne were uneasy till the breakfast was over, when they\nmade their escape: a few moments afterwards Captain Wilson rose to go on\nboard, and sent for them, but they were not to be found.\n\n\"I understand it all, Wilson,\" said the Governor; \"leave them to me; go\non board and make yourself quite easy.\"\n\nIn the meantime our two midshipmen had taken their hats and walked away\nto the parapet of the battery, where they would not be interrupted.\n\n\"Now, Gascoigne,\" observed Jack, \"you guess what I'm about--I must shoot\nthat rascal this very morning, and that's why I came out with you.\"\n\n\"But, Easy, the only difference is this, that I must shoot him, and not\nyou; he is my property, for I found him out.\"\n\n\"We'll argue that point,\" replied Jack: \"he has attempted the life of my\nis-to-be, please God, father-in-law, and therefore I have the best claim\nto him.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Jack, he is mine, for I discovered him.  Now let me\nput a case: suppose one man walking several yards before another, picks\nup a purse, what claim has the other to it?  I found him, and not you.\"\n\n\"That's all very well, Gascoigne; but suppose the purse you picked up to\nbe mine, then I have a right to it, although you found it; he is my bird\nby right, and not yours.\"\n\n\"But I have another observation to make, which is very important: he is\na blood relation of Agnes, and if his blood is on your hands, however\nmuch he may deserve it, depend upon it, it will be raised as an obstacle\nto your union; think of that.\"\n\nJack paused in thought.\n\n\"And let me induce you by another remark--you will confer on me a most\nparticular favour.\"\n\n\"It will be the greatest I ever could,\" replied Jack, \"and you ought to\nbe eternally indebted to me.\"\n\n\"I trust to make him _eternally_ indebted to me,\" replied Gascoigne.\n\nSailors, if going into action, always begin to reckon what their share\nof their prize-money may be, before a shot is fired--our two midshipmen\nappear in this instance to be doing the same.\n\nThe point having been conceded to Gascoigne, Jack went to the inn where\nDon Silvio had mentioned that he had taken up his quarters, and sending\nup his card, followed the waiter upstairs.  The waiter opened the door,\nand presented the card.\n\n\"Very well,\" replied Don Silvio, \"you can go down and show him up.\"\n\nJack, hearing these words, did not wait, but walked in, where he found\nDon Silvio very busy removing a hone upon which he had been whetting a\nsharp double-edged stiletto.  The Sicilian walked up to him, offering\nhis hand with apparent cordiality; but Jack with a look of defiance\nsaid, \"Don Silvio, we know you; my object now is to demand, on the part\nof my friend, the satisfaction which you do not deserve, but which our\nindignation at your second attempt upon Don Rebiera induces us to offer;\nfor if you escape from him you will have to do with me.  On the whole,\nDon Silvio, you may think yourself fortunate, for it is better to die by\nthe hands of a gentleman than by the gibbet.\"\n\nDon Silvio turned deadly pale--his hand sought his stiletto in his\nbosom, but it was remaining on the table; at last he replied, \"Be it\nso--I will meet you when and where you please, in an hour from this.\"\n\nJack mentioned the place of meeting, and then walked out of the room.\nHe and Gascoigne then hastened to the quarters of an officer they were\nintimate with, and having provided themselves with the necessary\nfire-arms, were at the spot before the time.  They waited for him till\nthe exact time, yet no Don Silvio made his appearance.\n\n\"He's off,\" observed Gascoigne; \"the villain has escaped us.\"\n\nHalf an hour over the time had passed, and still there was no sign of\nGascoigne's antagonist, but one of the Governor's aides-de-camp was seen\nwalking up to them.\n\n\"Here's Atkins,\" observed Jack; \"that's unlucky, but he won't\ninterfere.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Atkins, taking off his hat with much solemnity, \"the\nGovernor particularly wishes to speak to you both.\"\n\n\"We can't come just now--we'll be there in half an hour.\"\n\n\"You must be there in three minutes, both of you.  Excuse me, my orders\nare positive--and to see them duly executed I have a corporal and a file\nof men behind that wall--of course, if you walk with me quietly there\nwill be no occasion to send for their assistance.\"\n\n\"This is confounded tyranny,\" cried Jack.  \"Well may they call him King\nTom.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Atkins, \"and he governs here _in rey absoluto_--so come\nalong.\"\n\nJack and Gascoigne, having no choice, walked up to the government-house,\nwhere they found Sir Thomas in the veranda, which commanded a view of\nthe harbour and offing.\n\n\"Come here, young gentlemen,\" said the Governor, in a severe tone; \"do\nyou see that vessel about two miles clear of the port?  Don Silvio is in\nit, going back to Sicily under a guard.  And now remember what I say as\na maxim through life.  Fight with gentlemen, if you must fight, but not\nwith villains and murderers.  By _consenting_ to fight with a\n_blackguard_, you as much disparage your cloth and compromise your own\ncharacters, as by refusing to give satisfaction to a _gentleman_.\nThere, go away, for I'm angry with you, and don't let me see you till\ndinner-time.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY NINE.\n\nIN WHICH OUR HERO SEES A LITTLE MORE SERVICE, AND IS BETTER EMPLOYED\nTHAN IN FIGHTING DON SILVIO.\n\nBut before they met the Governor at his table, a sloop-of-war arrived\nfrom the fleet with despatches from the Commander-in-Chief.  Those to\nCaptain Wilson required him to make all possible haste in fitting, and\nthen to proceed and cruise off Corsica, to fall in with a Russian\nfrigate which was on that coast; if not there, to obtain intelligence,\nand to follow her wherever she might be.\n\nAll was now bustle and activity on board of the _Aurora_.  Captain\nWilson, with our hero and Gascoigne, quitted the Governor's house and\nrepaired on board, where they remained day and night.  On the third day\nthe _Aurora_ was complete and ready for sea, and about noon sailed out\nof Valette harbour.\n\nIn a week the _Aurora_ had gained the coast of Corsica, and there was no\nneed of sending look-out men to the mast-head, for one of the officers\nor midshipmen was there from daylight to dark.  She ran up the coast to\nthe northward without seeing the object of her pursuit, or obtaining any\nintelligence.\n\nCalms and light airs detained them for a few days, when a northerly\nbreeze enabled them to run down the eastern side of the island.  It was\non the eighteenth day after they had quitted Malta that a large vessel\nwas seen ahead about eighteen miles off.  The men were then at\nbreakfast.\n\n\"A frigate, Captain Wilson, I'm sure of it,\" said Mr Hawkins the\nchaplain, whose anxiety induced him to go to the mast-head.\n\n\"How is she steering?\"\n\n\"The same way as we are.\"\n\nThe _Aurora_ was under all possible sail, and when the hands were piped\nto dinner, it was thought that they had neared the chase about two\nmiles.\n\n\"This will be a long chase; a stern chase always is,\" observed Martin to\nGascoigne.\n\n\"Yes, I'm afraid so--but I'm more afraid of her escaping.\"\n\n\"That's not unlikely either,\" replied the mate.\n\n\"You are one of Job's Comforters, Martin,\" replied Gascoigne.\n\n\"Then I'm not so often disappointed,\" replied the mate.  \"There are two\npoints to be ascertained; the first is, whether we shall come up with\nthe vessel or lose her--the next is, if we do come up with her, whether\nshe is the vessel we are looking for.\"\n\n\"You seem very indifferent about it.\"\n\n\"Indeed I am not: I am the oldest passed midshipman in the ship, and the\ntaking of the frigate will, if I live, give me my promotion, and if I'm\nkilled, I shan't want it.  But I've been so often disappointed, that I\nnow make sure of nothing until I have it.\"\n\n\"Well, for your sake, Martin, I will still hope that the vessel is the\none we seek, that we shall not be killed, and that you will gain your\npromotion.\"\n\n\"I thank you, Easy--I wish I was one that dared hope as you do.\"\n\nPoor Martin! he had long felt how bitter it was to meet disappointment\nupon disappointment.  How true it is that hope deferred maketh the heart\nsick! and his anticipations of early days, the buoyant calculations of\nyouth, had been one by one crushed, and now, having served his time\nnearly three times over, the reaction had become too painful, and, as he\ntruly said, he dared not hope: still his temper was not soured but\nchastened.\n\n\"She has hauled her wind, sir,\" hailed the second-lieutenant from the\ntopmast cross-trees.\n\n\"What think you of that, Martin?\" observed Jack.\n\n\"Either that she is an English frigate, or that she is a vessel\ncommanded by a very brave fellow, and well manned.\"\n\nIt was sunset before the _Aurora_ had arrived within two miles of the\nvessel; the private signal had been thrown out, but had not been\nanswered, either because it was too dark to make out the colours of the\nflags, or that these were unknown to an enemy.  The stranger had hoisted\nthe English colours, but that was no satisfactory proof of her being a\nfriend; and just before dark she had put her head towards the _Aurora_,\nwho had now come stem down to her.  The ship's company of the _Aurora_\nwere all at their quarters, as a few minutes would now decide whether\nthey had to deal with a friend or a foe.\n\nThere is no situation perhaps more difficult, and demanding so much\ncaution, as the occasional meeting with a doubtful ship.  On the one\nhand, it being necessary to be fully prepared and not allow the enemy\nthe advantage which may be derived from your inaction; and on the other,\nthe necessity of prudence, that you may not assault your friends and\ncountrymen.  Captain Wilson had hoisted the private night-signal, but\nhere again it was difficult, from his sails intervening, for the other\nship to make it out.  Before the two frigates were within three cables\nlength of each other, Captain Wilson, determined that there should be no\nmistake from any want of precaution on his part, hauled up his courses\nand brailed up his driver that the night-signal might be clearly seen.\n\nLights were seen abaft on the quarter-deck of the other vessel, as if\nthey were about to answer, but she continued to keep the _Aurora_ to\nleeward at about half a cable's length, and as the foremost guns of each\nvessel were abreast of each other, hailed in English--\n\n\"Ship ahoy; what ship's that?\"\n\n\"His Majesty's ship _Aurora_,\" replied Captain Wilson, who stood on the\nhammocks.  \"What ship's that?\"\n\nBy this time the other frigate had passed half her length clear of the\nbeam of the _Aurora_, and at the same time that a pretended reply of\n\"His Majesty's ship--\" was heard, a broadside from her guns, which had\nbeen trained aft on purpose, was poured into the _Aurora_ and, at so\nshort a distance, doing considerable execution.  The crew of the\n_Aurora_, hearing the hailing in English, and the vessel passing them\napparently without firing, had imagined that she had been one of their\nown cruisers.  The captains of the guns had dropped their lanyards in\ndisappointment, and the silence which had been maintained as the two\nvessels met was just breaking up in various ways of lamentation at their\nbad luck, when the broadside was poured in, thundering in their ears,\nand the ripping and tearing of the beams and planks astonished their\nsenses.  Many were carried down below, but it was difficult to say\nwhether indignation at the enemy's ruse, or satisfaction at discovering\nthat they were not called to quarters in vain, most predominated.  At\nall events it was answered by three voluntary cheers, which drowned the\ncries of those who were being assisted to the cockpit.\n\n\"Man the larboard-guns and about ship!\" cried Captain Wilson, leaping\noff the hammocks.  \"Look out, my lads, and rake her in stays!  We'll pay\nhim off for that foul play before we've done with him.  Look out, my\nlads, and take good aim as she pays round.\"\n\nThe _Aurora_ was put about, and her broadside poured into the stern of\nthe Russian frigate--for such she was.  It was almost dark, but the\nenemy, who appeared as anxious as the _Aurora_ to come to action, hauled\nup her courses to await her coming up.  In five minutes the two vessels\nwere alongside exchanging murderous broadsides at little more than\npistol-shot--running slowly in for the land, than not more than five\nmiles distant.  The skin-clad mountaineers of Corsica were aroused by\nthe furious cannonading, watching the incessant flashes of the guns, and\nlistening to their reverberating roar.\n\nAfter half an hour's fierce combat, during which the fire of both\nvessels was kept up with undiminished vigour, Captain Wilson went down\non the main deck, and himself separately pointed each gun after it was\nloaded; those amidships being direct for the main-channels of the\nenemy's ship, while those abaft the beam were gradually trained more and\nmore forward, and those before the beam more and more aft, so as to\nthrow all their shot nearly into one focus, giving directions that they\nwere all to be fired at once, at the word of command.  The enemy, not\naware of the cause of the delay, imagined that the fire of the _Aurora_\nhad slackened, and loudly cheered.  At the word given the broadside was\npoured in, and, dark as it was, the effects from it were evident.  Two\nof the midship ports of the antagonist were blown into one, and her\nmain-mast was seen to totter, and then to fall over the side.  The\n_Aurora_ then set her courses, which had been hauled up, and, shooting\nahead, took up a raking position while the Russian was still hampered\nwith her wreck, and poured in grape and cannister from her upper deck\ncarronades to impede their labours on deck, while she continued her\ndestructive fire upon the hull of the enemy from the main-deck battery.\n\nThe moon now burst out from a low bank of clouds, and enabled them to\naccomplish their work with more precision.  In a quarter of an hour the\nRussian was totally dismasted, and Captain Wilson ordered half of his\nremaining ship's company to repair the damages, which had been most\nsevere, whilst the larboard men at quarters continued the fire from the\nmain deck.  The enemy continued to return the fire from four guns, two\non each of her decks, which she could still make bear upon the _Aurora_;\nbut after some time even these ceased, either from the men having\ndeserted them, or from their being dismounted.  Observing that the fire\nfrom her antagonist had ceased, the _Aurora_ also discontinued, and the\njolly-boat astern being still uninjured, the second lieutenant was\ndeputed to pull alongside of the frigate to ascertain if she had struck.\n\nThe beams of the bright moon silvered the rippling water as the boat\nshoved off; and Captain Wilson and his officers who were still unhurt,\nleant over the shattered sides of the _Aurora_, waiting for a reply:\nsuddenly the silence of the night was broken upon by a loud splash from\nthe bows of the Russian frigate, then about three cables' length\ndistant.\n\n\"What could that be?\" cried Captain Wilson.  \"Her anchor's down.  Mr\nJones, a lead over the side, and see what water we have.\"\n\nMr Jones had long been carried down below, severed in two with a round\nshot--but a man leaped into the chains, and lowering down the lead,\nsounded in seven fathoms.\n\n\"Then I suspect he will give us more trouble yet,\" observed Captain\nWilson; and so indeed it proved, for the Russian captain, in reply to\nthe second lieutenant, had told him in English, \"that he would answer\nthat question with his broadside,\" and before the boat was dropped\nastern, he had warped round with the springs on his cable, and had\nrecommenced his fire upon the _Aurora_.\n\nCaptain Wilson made sail upon his ship, and sailed round and round the\nanchored vessel, so as to give her two broadsides to her one, and from\nthe slowness with which she worked at her springs upon her cables, it\nwas evident that she must be now very weak-handed.  Still the\npertinacity and decided courage of the Russian captain convinced Captain\nWilson that, in all probability, he would sink at his anchor before he\nwould haul down his colours; and not only would he lose more of the\n_Aurora's_ men, but also the Russian vessel, without he took a more\ndecided step.  Captain Wilson, therefore, resolved to try her by the\nboard.  Having poured in a raking fire, he stood off for a few moments,\nduring which he called the officers and men on deck, and stated his\nintention.  He then went about, and himself conning the _Aurora_, ran\nher on board the Russian, pouring in his reserved broadside as the\nvessels came into collision, and heading his men as they leaped on the\nenemy's decks.\n\nAlthough, as Captain Wilson had imagined, the Russian frigate had not\nmany men to oppose to the _Aurora's_, the deck was obstinately defended,\nthe voice and the arm of the Russian captain were to be heard and seen\neverywhere, and his men, encouraged by him, were cut down by numbers\nwhere they stood.\n\nOur hero, who had the good fortune to be still unhurt, was for a little\nwhile close to Captain Wilson when he boarded, and was about to oppose\nhis unequal force against that of the Russian captain, when he was\npulled back by the collar by Mr Hawkins, the chaplain, who rushed in\nadvance with a sabre in his hand.  The opponents were well matched, and\nit may be said that, with little interruption, a hand-to-hand conflict\nensued, for the moon lighted up the scene of carnage, and they were well\nable to distinguish each other's faces.  At last, the chaplain's sword\nbroke; he rushed in, drove the hilt into his antagonist's face, closed\nwith him, and they both fell down the hatchway together.  After this,\nthe deck was gained, or rather cleared, by the crew of the _Aurora_, for\nfew could be said to have resisted, and in a minute or two the frigate\nwas in their possession.  The chaplain and the Russian captain were\nhoisted up, still clinging to each other, both senseless from the fall,\nbut neither of them dead; although bleeding from several wounds.\n\nAs soon as the main-deck had been cleared, Captain Wilson ordered the\nhatches to be put on, and left a party on board while he hastened to\nattend to the condition of his own ship and ship's company.\n\nIt was daylight before anything like order had been restored to the\ndecks of the _Aurora_; the water was still smooth, and instead of\nletting go her own anchor, she had hung on with a hawser to the prize,\nbut her sails had been furled, her decks cleared, guns secured, and the\nbuckets were dashing away the blood from her planks and the carriages of\nthe guns, when the sun rose and shone upon them.  The numerous wounded\nhad, by this time, been put into their hammocks, although there were\nstill one or two cases of amputation to be performed.\n\nThe carpenter had repaired all shot-holes under or too near to the\nwater-line, and then had proceeded to sound the well of the prize; but\nalthough her upper works had been dreadfully shattered, there was no\nreason to suppose that she had received any serious injury below, and\ntherefore the hatches still remained on, although a few hands were put\nto the pumps to try if she made any water.  It was not until the\n_Aurora_ presented a more cheerful appearance that Captain Wilson went\nover to the other ship, whose deck, now that the light of heaven enabled\nthem to witness all the horrors even to minuteness, presented a shocking\nspectacle of blood and carnage.  Body after body was thrown over; the\nwounded were supplied with water and such assistance as could be\nrendered until the surgeons could attend them; the hatches were then\ntaken off, and the remainder of her crew ordered on deck; about two\nhundred obeyed the summons, but the lower deck was as crowded with\nkilled and wounded as was the upper.  For the present the prisoners were\nhanded over down into the forehold of the _Aurora_, which had been\nprepared for their reception, and the work of separation of the dead\nfrom the living then underwent.  After this such repairs as were\nimmediately necessary were made, and a portion of the _Aurora's_ crew,\nunder the orders of the second lieutenant, were sent on board to take\ncharge of her.  It was not till the evening of the day after this\nnight-conflict that the _Aurora_ was in a situation to make sail.  All\nhands were then sent on board of the _Trident_, for such was the name of\nthe Russian frigate, to fit her out as soon as possible.  Before\nmorning--for there was no relaxation from their fatigue, nor was there\nany wish for it--all was completed, and the two frigates, although in a\nshattered condition, were prepared to meet any common conflict with the\nelements.  The _Aurora_ made sail with the _Trident_ in tow; the\nhammocks were allowed to be taken down, and the watch below permitted to\nrepose.\n\nIn this murderous conflict the _Trident_ had more than two hundred men\nkilled and wounded.  The _Aurora's_ loss had not been so great, but\nstill it was severe, having lost sixty-five men and officers.  Among the\nfallen there were Mr Jones the master, the third lieutenant Mr\nAwkwright, and two midshipmen killed.  Mr Pottyfar, the first\nlieutenant, severely wounded at the commencement of the action.  Martin,\nthe master's mate, and Gascoigne, the first mortally, and the second\nbadly, wounded.  Our hero had also received a slight cutlass wound,\nwhich obliged him to wear his arm, for a short time, in a sling.\n\nAmong the ship's company who were wounded was Mesty: he had been hurt\nwith a splinter before the _Trident_ was taken by the board, but had\nremained on deck, and had followed our hero, watching over him and\nprotecting him as a father.  He had done even more, for he had with Jack\nthrown himself before Captain Wilson, at a time that he had received\nsuch a blow with the flat of a sword as to stun him and bring him down\non his knee.  And Jack had taken good care that Captain Wilson should\nnot be ignorant, as he really would have been, of this timely service on\nthe part of Mesty, who certainly, although with a great deal of\n_sang-froid_ in his composition when in repose, was a fiend incarnate\nwhen his blood was up.\n\n\"But you must have been with Mesty,\" observed Captain Wilson, \"when he\ndid me the service.\"\n\n\"I was with him, sir,\" replied Jack, with great modesty, \"but was of\nvery little service.\"\n\n\"How is your friend Gascoigne this evening?\"\n\n\"Oh, not very bad, sir--he wants a glass of grog.\"\n\n\"And Mr Martin?\"\n\nJack shook his head.\n\n\"Why, the surgeon thinks he will do well.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, and so I told Martin; but he said that it was very well to\ngive him hope--but that he thought otherwise.\"\n\n\"You must manage him, Mr Easy; tell him that he is sure of his\npromotion.\"\n\n\"I have, sir, but he won't believe it.  He never will believe it till he\nhas his commission signed.  I really think that an acting order would do\nmore than the doctor can.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr Easy, he shall have one to-morrow morning.  Have you seen Mr\nPottyfar?  He, I am afraid, is very bad.\"\n\n\"Very bad, sir; and, they say, is worse every day, and yet his wound is\nhealthy, and ought to be doing well.\"\n\nSuch was the conversation between Jack and his captain, as they sat at\nbreakfast on the third morning after the action.\n\nThe next day Easy took down an acting order for Martin, and put it into\nhis hands.  The mate read it over as he lay bandaged in his hammock.\n\n\"It's only an acting order, Jack,\" said he; \"it may not be confirmed.\"\n\nJack swore, by all the articles of war, that it would be; but Martin\nreplied that he was sure it never would.\n\n\"No, no,\" said the mate, \"I knew very well that I never should be made.\nIf it is not confirmed, I may live; but if it is, I am sure to die.\"\n\nEvery one that went to Martin's hammock wished him joy of his promotion;\nbut six days after the action poor Martin's remains were consigned to\nthe deep.\n\nThe next person who followed him was Mr Pottyfar, the first lieutenant,\nwho had contrived, wounded as he was, to reach a packet of the universal\nmedicine, and had taken so many bottles before he was found out, that he\nwas one morning found dead in his bed, with more than two dozen empty\nphials under his pillow, and by the side of his mattress.  He was not\nburied with his hands in his pockets, but when sewed up in his hammock,\nthey were, at all events, laid in the right position.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY.\n\nMODERN PHILANTHROPY WHICH, AS USUAL, IS THE CAUSE OF MUCH TROUBLE AND\nVEXATION.\n\nIn three weeks the _Aurora_, with her prize in tow, arrived at Malta.\nThe wounded were sent to the hospital, and the gallant Russian captain\nrecovered from his wounds about the same time as Mr Hawkins, the\nchaplain.\n\nJack, who constantly called to see the chaplain, had a great deal to do\nto console him.  He would shake his hands as he lay in his bed,\nexclaiming against himself.  \"Oh,\" Would he say, \"the spirit is willing,\nbut the flesh is weak.  That I, a man of God, as they term me, who ought\nto have been down with the surgeons, whispering comfort to the\ndesponding, should have gone on deck (but I could not help it), and have\nmixed in such a scene of slaughter!  What will become of me?\"\n\nJack attempted to console him by pointing out that not only chaplains\nbut bishops have been known to fight in armour from time immemorial.\nBut Mr Hawkins's recovery was long doubtful, from the agitation of his\nmind.  When he was able to walk, Jack introduced to him the Russian\ncaptain, who was also just out of his bed.\n\n\"I am most happy to embrace so gallant an officer,\" said the Russian,\nwho recognised his antagonist, throwing his arms round the chaplain, and\ngiving him a kiss on both cheeks.  \"What is his rank?\" continued he,\naddressing himself to Jack, who replied, very quietly, \"that he was the\nship's padre.\"\n\n\"The padre!\" replied the captain, with surprise, as Hawkins turned away\nwith confusion.  \"The padre--par exemple!  Well, I always had a great\nrespect for the church.  Pray sir,\" said he, turning to Easy, \"do your\npadres always head your boarders?\"\n\n\"Always, sir,\" replied Jack; \"it's a rule of the service--and the duty\nof a padre to show the men the way to heaven.  It's our ninety-ninth\narticle of war.\"\n\n\"You are a fighting nation,\" replied the Russian, bowing to Hawkins, and\ncontinuing his walk, not exactly pleased that he had been floored by a\nparson.\n\nMr Hawkins continued very disconsolate for some time; he then invalided\nand applied himself to his duties on shore, where he would not be\nexposed to such temptations from his former habits.\n\nAs the _Aurora_, when she was last at Malta, had nearly exhausted the\ndockyard for her repairs, she was even longer fitting out this time,\nduring which Captain Wilson's despatches had been received by the\nadmiral, and had been acknowledged by a brig sent to Malta.  The\nadmiral, in reply, after complimenting him upon his gallantry and\nsuccess, desired that, as soon as he was ready, he should proceed to\nPalermo with communications of importance to the authorities, and having\nremained there for an answer, was again to return to Malta to pick up\nsuch of his men as might be fit to leave the hospital, and then join the\nToulon fleet.  This intelligence was soon known to our hero, who was in\necstasies at the idea of again seeing Agnes and her brothers.  Once more\nthe _Aurora_ sailed away from the high-crowned rocks of Valette, and\nwith a fine breeze dashed through the deep blue waves.\n\nBut towards the evening the breeze increased, and they were under\ndouble-reefed topsails.  On the second day they made the coast of\nSicily, not far from where Easy and Gascoigne had been driven on shore;\nthe weather was then more moderate, and the sea had, to a great degree,\nsubsided.  They therefore stood in close to the coast, as they had not a\nleading wind to Palermo.  As they stood in, the glasses, as usual, were\ndirected to land; observing the villas with which the hills and valleys\nwere studded, with their white fronts embowered in orange groves.\n\n\"What is that, Gascoigne,\" said Easy, \"under that precipice?--it looks\nlike a vessel.\"\n\nGascoigne turned his glass in the direction--\"Yes, it is a vessel on the\nrocks: by her prow she looks like a galley.\"\n\n\"It is a galley, sir--one of the row galleys--I can make out her bank of\noars,\" observed the signal-man.\n\nThis was reported to Captain Wilson, who also examined her.\n\n\"She is on the rocks, certainly,\" observed he; \"and I think I see people\non board.  Keep her away a point, quarter-master.\"\n\nThe _Aurora_ was now steered right for the vessel, and in the course of\nan hour was not more than a mile from her.  Their suppositions were\ncorrect--it was one of the Sicilian government galleys bilged on the\nrocks, and they now perceived that there were people on board of her,\nmaking signals with their shirts and pieces of linen.\n\n\"They must be the galley-slaves; for I perceive that they do not one of\nthem change their positions: the galley must have been abandoned by the\nofficers and seamen, and the slaves left to perish.\"\n\n\"That's very hard,\" observed Jack to Gascoigne; \"they were condemned to\nthe galleys, but not to death.\"\n\n\"They will not have much mercy from the waves,\" replied Gascoigne; \"they\nwill all be in kingdom come to-morrow morning, if the breeze comes more\non the land.  We have already come up two points this forenoon.\"\n\nAlthough Captain Wilson did not join in this conversation, which he\noverheard as he stood on the forecastle gun, with his glass over the\nhammocks, it appears he was of the same opinion; but he demurred: he had\nto choose between allowing so many of his fellow-creatures to perish\nmiserably, or to let loose upon society a set of miscreants, who would\nagain enter a course of crime until they were recaptured, and by so\ndoing probably displease the Sicilian authorities.  After some little\nreflection he resolved that he would take his chance of the latter.  The\n_Aurora_ was hove-to in stays, and the two cutters ordered to be lowered\ndown, and the boat's crew to be armed.\n\n\"Mr Easy, do you take one cutter and the armourers; pull on board of\nthe galley, release those people, and land them in small divisions.  Mr\nGascoigne, you will take the other to assist Mr Easy, and when he lands\nthem in his boat, you will pull by his side ready to act, in case of any\nhostile attempt on the part of the scoundrels; for we must not expect\ngratitude: of course, land them at the nearest safe spot for\ndebarkation.\"\n\nIn pursuance of these orders, our two midshipmen pulled away to the\nvessel.  They found her fixed hard upon the rocks, which had pierced her\nslight timbers, and, as they had supposed, the respectable part of her\ncrew, with the commander, had taken to the boats, leaving the\ngalley-slaves to their fate.  She pulled fifty oars, but had only\nthirty-six manned.  These oars were forty feet long, and ran in from the\nthole-pin with a loom six feet long, each manned by four slaves, who\nwere chained to their seat before it, by a running chain made fast by a\npadlock in amidships.  A plank, of two feet wide, ran fore and aft the\nvessel between the two banks of oars, for the boatswain to apply the\nlash to those who did not sufficiently exert themselves.\n\n\"Viva los Inglesos,\" cried the galley-slaves, as Easy climbed up over\nthe quarter of the vessel.\n\n\"I say, Ned, did you ever see such a precious set of villains?\" observed\nEasy, as he surveyed the faces of the men who were chained.\n\n\"No,\" replied Gascoigne; \"and I think if the captain had seen them as we\nhave, that he would have left them where they were.\"\n\n\"I don't know--but however, our orders are positive.  Armourer, knock\noff all the padlocks, beginning aft; when we have a cargo we will land\nthem.  How many are there?--twelve dozen; twelve dozen villains to let\nloose upon society.  I have a great mind to go on board again and report\nmy opinion to the captain--one hundred and forty-four villains, who all\ndeserve hanging--for drowning is too good for them.\"\n\n\"Our orders are to liberate them, Jack.\"\n\n\"Yes; but I should like to argue this point with Captain Wilson.\"\n\n\"They'll send after them fast enough, Jack, and they'll all be in limbo\nagain before long,\" replied Gascoigne.\n\n\"Well, I suppose we must obey orders; but it goes against my conscience\nto save such villainous-looking rascals.  Armourer, hammer away.\"\n\nThe armourer, who, with the seamen, appeared very much of Jack's\nopinion, and had not commenced his work, now struck off the padlocks,\none by one, with his sledge-hammer.  As soon as they were released the\nslaves were ordered into the cutter, and when it was sufficiently loaded\nJack shoved off, followed by Gascoigne as guard, and landed them at the\npoint about a cable's length distant.  It required six trips before they\nwere all landed: the last cargo were on shore, and Easy was desiring the\nmen to shove off, when one of the galleriens turned round, and cried out\nto Jack in a mocking tone, \"Addio signor, a reveder la.\"  Jack started,\nstared, and in the squalid, naked wretch who addressed him, he\nrecognised Don Silvio!\n\n\"I will acquaint Don Rebiera of your arrival, signor,\" said the\nmiscreant, springing up the rocks, and mixing with the rest, who now\ncommenced hooting and laughing at their preservers.\n\n\"Ned,\" observed Easy to Gascoigne, \"we have let that rascal loose.\"\n\n\"More's the pity,\" replied Gascoigne; \"but we have only obeyed orders.\"\n\n\"It can't be helped, but I've a notion there will be some mischief out\nof this.\"\n\n\"We obeyed orders,\" replied Gascoigne.\n\n\"We've let the rascals loose not ten miles from Don Rebiera's.\"\n\n\"Obeyed orders, Jack.\"\n\n\"With a whole gang to back him, if he goes there.\"\n\n\"Orders, Jack.\"\n\n\"Agnes at his mercy.\"\n\n\"Captain's orders, Jack.\"\n\n\"I shall argue this point when I go on board,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"Too late, Jack.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Easy, sinking down on the stern sheets with a look of\ndespair.\n\n\"Give way, my lads, give way.\"\n\nJack returned on board and reported what he had done; also that Don\nSilvio was among those liberated; and he ventured to mention his fears\nof what might take place from their contiguity to the house of Don\nRebiera.  Captain Wilson bit his lips: he felt that his philanthropy had\ninduced him to act without his usual prudence.\n\n\"I have done a rash thing, Mr Easy, I am afraid.  I should have taken\nthem all on board and delivered them up to the authorities.  I wish I\nhad thought of that before.  We must get to Palermo as fast as we can,\nand have the troops sent after these miscreants.  Hands 'bout ship, fill\nthe main-yard.\"\n\nThe wind had veered round, and the _Aurora_ was now able to lay up clear\nof the island of Maritimo.  The next morning she anchored in Palermo\nRoads--gave immediate notice to the authorities, who, wishing Captain\nWilson's philanthropy at the devil, immediately dispatched a large body\nof troops in quest of the liberated malefactors.  Captain Wilson,\nfeeling for Jack's anxiety about his friends, called him over to him on\ndeck, and gave him and Gascoigne permission to go on shore.\n\n\"Will you allow me to take Mesty with me, sir, if you please?\" said\nJack.\n\n\"Yes, Mr Easy: but recollect that, even with Mesty, you are no match\nfor one hundred and fifty men, so be prudent.  I send, you to relieve\nyour anxiety, not to run into danger.\"\n\n\"Of course, sir,\" replied Jack, touching his hat, and walking away\nquietly till he came to the hatch-way, when he darted down like a shot,\nand was immediately occupied with his preparations.\n\nIn half an hour our two midshipmen, with Mesty, had landed, and\nproceeded to the inn where they had put up before: they were armed up to\nthe teeth.  Their first inquiries were for Don Philip and his brother.\n\n\"Both on leave of absence,\" replied the landlord, \"and staying with Don\nRebiera.\"\n\n\"That's some comfort,\" thought Jack.  \"Now we must get horses as fast as\nwe can.--Mesty, can you ride?\"\n\n\"By all de power can I ride, Massa Easy; suppose you ride Kentucky\nhorse, you ride anyting.\"\n\nIn half an hour four horses and a guide were procured, and at eight\no'clock in the morning the party set off in the direction of Don\nRebiera's country-seat.\n\nThey had not ridden more than six miles when they came up with one of\nthe detachments sent out in pursuit of the liberated criminals.  Our\nhero recognised the commanding officer as an old acquaintance, and\nimparting to him the release of Don Silvio, and his fears upon Don\nRebiera's account, begged him to direct his attention that way.\n\n\"Corpo di Bacco--you are right, Signor Mid,\" replied the officer, \"but\nDon Philip is there, and his brother too, I believe.  I will be there by\nten o'clock to-morrow morning; we will march almost the whole night.\"\n\n\"They have no arms,\" observed Easy.\n\n\"No, but they will soon get them: they will go to some small town in a\nbody, plunder it, and then seek the protection of the mountains.  Your\ncaptain has given us a pretty job.\"\n\nJack exchanged a few more words, and then, excusing himself on account\nof his haste, put the spurs to his horse and regained his own party, who\nnow proceeded at a rapid pace.\n\n\"O Signor!\" said the guide, \"we shall kill the horses.\"\n\n\"I'll pay for them,\" said Jack.\n\n\"Yes, but we shall kill them before we get there, Jack,\" replied\nGascoigne, \"and have to walk the rest of the way.\"\n\n\"Very true, Ned; let's pull up, and give them their wind.\"\n\n\"By de holy poker, Massa Easy, but my shirt stick to my ribs,\" cried\nMesty, whose black face was hung with dewdrops from their rapid course.\n\n\"Never mind, Mesty.\"\n\nIt was about five o'clock in the afternoon when they arrived at the seat\nof Don Rebiera.  Jack threw himself off his jaded steed, and hastened\ninto the house, followed by Gascoigne.  They found the whole family\ncollected in the large sitting-room, quite ignorant of any danger\nthreatening them, and equally astonished and pleased at the arrival of\ntheir old friends.  Jack flew to Agnes, who screamed when she saw him,\nand felt so giddy afterwards that he was obliged to support her.  Having\nseated her again, he was kindly greeted by the old people and the two\nyoung officers.  After a few minutes dedicated to mutual inquiries, our\nhero stated the cause of their expeditious arrival.\n\n\"Don Silvio with one hundred and fifty galleriens, let loose on the\ncoast yesterday afternoon!\" exclaimed Don Rebiera; \"you are right, I\nonly wonder they were not here last night.  But I expect Pedro from the\ntown; he has gone down with a load of wine: he will bring us\nintelligence.\"\n\n\"At all events, we must be prepared,\" said Don Philip, \"the troops you\nsay will be here to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Holy Virgin!\" exclaimed the ladies in a breath.\n\n\"How many can we muster?\" said Gascoigne.\n\n\"We will have five men here, or we shall have by the evening,\" replied\nDon Philip--\"all, I think, good men--my father, my brother and myself.\"\n\n\"We are three--four with the guide, whom I know nothing about.\"\n\n\"Twelve in all--not one too many; but I think that now we are prepared,\nif they attack, we can hold out till the morning.\"\n\n\"Had we not better send the ladies away?\" said Jack.\n\n\"Who is to escort them?\" replied Don Philip; \"we shall only weaken our\nforce: besides, they may fall into the miscreants' hands.\"\n\n\"Shall we all leave the house together? they can but plunder it,\"\nobserved Don Rebiera.\n\n\"Still we may be intercepted by them, and our whole force will be\nnothing against so many,\" observed Don Philip, \"if we are without\ndefence, whereas in the house we shall have an advantage.\"\n\n\"E vero,\" replied Don Rebiera, thoughtfully; \"then let us prepare, for\ndepend upon it Don Silvio will not lose such an opportunity to wreak his\nvengeance.  He will be here to-night: I only wonder he has not been here\nwith his companions before.  However, Pedro will arrive in two hours.\"\n\n\"We must now see what means we have of defence,\" said Philip.  \"Come,\nbrother--will you come, sir?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY ONE.\n\nA REGULAR SET-TO, IN WHICH THE PARTIES BEATEN ARE NOT KNOCKED DOWN, BUT\nRISE HIGHER AND HIGHER AT EACH DISCOMFITURE--NOTHING BUT THE TROOPS\nCOULD HAVE PREVENTED THEM FROM GOING UP TO HEAVEN.\n\nDon Rebiera and his two sons quitted the room, Gascoigne entered into\nconversation with the senora, while Easy took this opportunity of\naddressing Agnes.  He had been too much occupied with the consultation\nto pay her much attention before.  He had spoken, with his eyes fixed\nupon her, and had been surprised at the improvement which had taken\nplace in less than a year.  He now went to her, and asked her, in a low\nvoice, \"whether she had received his letter?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" replied she, colouring.\n\n\"And were you angry with what I said, Agnes?\" in a low tone.\n\n\"No,\" replied she, casting her eyes down on the floor.\n\n\"I repeat now what I said, Agnes--I have never forgotten you.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"Father Thomaso.\"\n\n\"What of him?\"\n\n\"He never will--\"\n\n\"Will what?\"\n\n\"You are a heretic,\" he says.\n\n\"Tell him to mind his own business.\"\n\n\"He has great influence with my father and mother.\"\n\n\"Your brothers are on our side.\"\n\n\"I know that, but there will be great difficulty.  Our religion is not\nthe same.  He must talk to you--he will convert you.\"\n\n\"We'll argue that point, Agnes.  I will convert him if he has common\nsense; if not, it's no use arguing with him.  Where is he?\"\n\n\"He will soon be at home.\"\n\n\"Tell me, Agnes, if you had your own will, would you marry me?\"\n\n\"I don't know; I have never seen any one I liked so well.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"Is it not enough for a maiden to say?\" replied Agnes, raising her eyes,\nand looking reproachfully.  \"Signor, let me go, here comes my father.\"\n\nNotwithstanding, Jack cast his eyes to the window where Gascoigne and\nthe senora were in converse, and perceiving that the old lady's back was\nturned, he pressed Agnes to his bosom before he released her.  The\ngentlemen then returned with all the fire-arms and destructive weapons\nthey could collect.\n\n\"We have enough,\" observed Don Philip, \"to arm all the people we have\nwith us.\"\n\n\"And we are all well armed,\" replied Jack, who had left Agnes standing\nalone.  \"What now are your plans?\"\n\n\"Those we must now consult about.  It appears\"--but at this moment the\nconversation was interrupted by the sudden entrance of Pedro, who had\nbeen despatched to the town with the load of wine.  He rushed in,\nflurried and heated, with his red cap in his hand.\n\n\"How now, Pedro, back so early!\"\n\n\"O signor!\" exclaimed the man--\"they have taken the cart and the wine,\nand have drawn it away up to the mountains.\"\n\n\"Who?\" inquired Don Rebiera.\n\n\"The galley-slaves who have been let loose--and by the body of our\nblessed saint, they have done pretty mischief--they have broken into the\nhouses, robbed everything--murdered many--clothed themselves with the\nbest--collected all the arms, provisions, and wine they could lay their\nhands on, and have marched away into the mountains.  This took place\nlast night.  As I was coming down within a mile of the town, they met me\nwith my loaded cart, and they turned the bullocks round and drove them\naway along with the rest.  By the blessed Virgin! but they are stained\nwith blood, but not altogether of men, for they have cut up some of the\noxen.  I heard this from one of the herdsmen, but he too fled and could\nnot tell me more.  But, signor, I heard them mention your name.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt of it,\" replied Don Rebiera.  \"As for the wine, I only\nhope they will drink too much of it to-night.  But, Pedro, they will be\nhere, and we must defend ourselves--so call the men together; I must\nspeak to them.\"\n\n\"We shall never see the bullocks again,\" observed Pedro mournfully.\n\n\"No; but we shall never see one another again, if we do not take care.\nI have information they come here to-night.\"\n\n\"Holy Saint Francis! and they say there are a thousand of them.\"\n\n\"Not quite so many, to my knowledge,\" observed Jack.\n\n\"They told me that a great many were killed in their attack upon the\ntown, before they mastered it.\"\n\n\"So much the better.  Go now, Pedro, drink a cup of wine, and then call\nthe other men.\"\n\nThe house was barricaded as well as circumstances would permit; the\nfirst story was also made a fortress by loading the landing-place with\narmoires and chests of drawers.  The upper story, or attic, if it might\nbe so called, was defended in the same way, that they might retreat from\none to the other if the doors were forced.\n\nIt was eight o'clock in the evening before all was ready, and they were\nstill occupied with the last defence, under the superintendence of\nMesty, who showed himself an able engineer, when they heard the sound of\nan approaching multitude.  They looked out of one of the windows and\nperceived the house surrounded by the galley-slaves, in number,\napparently, about a hundred.  They were all dressed in a most fantastic\nmanner with whatever they could pick up: some had fire-arms, but the\nmost of them were supplied with only swords or knives.  With them came\nalso their cortege of plunder: carts of various descriptions, loaded\nwith provisions of all sorts, and wine; women lashed down with ropes,\nsails from the vessels and boats to supply them with covering in the\nmountains, hay and straw and mattresses.  Their plunder appeared to be\nwell chosen for their exigencies.  To the carts were tied a variety of\ncattle, intended to accompany them to their retreat.  They all appeared\nto be under a leader, who was issuing directions--that leader was soon\nrecognised by those in the house to be Don Silvio.\n\n\"Massa Easy, you show me dat man?\" said Mesty, when he heard the\nconversation between Easy and the Rebieras; \"only let me know him.\"\n\n\"Do you see him there, Mesty, walking down in front of those men? he has\na musket in his hand, a jacket with silver buttons, and white trousers.\"\n\n\"Yes, Massa Easy, me see him well--let me look little more--dat enough.\"\n\nThe galley slaves appeared to be very anxious to surround the house that\nno one should escape, and Don Silvio was arranging the men.\n\n\"Ned,\" said Jack, \"let us show him that we are here.  He said that he\nwould acquaint Don Rebiera with our arrival--let us prove to him that he\nis too late.\"\n\n\"It would not be a bad plan,\" replied Gascoigne; \"if it were possible\nthat these fellows had any gratitude among them, some of them might\nrelent at the idea of attacking those who saved them.\"\n\n\"Not a bit; but it will prove to them that there are more in the house\nthan they think for; and we can frighten some of them by telling them\nthat the soldiers are near at hand.\"\n\nJack immediately threw up the casement, and called out in a loud voice,\n\"Don Silvio! galley-slave!  Don Silvio!\"\n\nThe party hailed turned round, and beheld Jack, Gascoigne, and Mesty,\nstanding at the window of the upper floor.\n\n\"We have saved you the trouble of announcing us,\" called out Gascoigne.\n\"We are here to receive you.\"\n\n\"And in three hours the troops will be here, so you must be quick, Don\nSilvio,\" continued Jack.\n\n\"_A reveder la_,\" continued Gascoigne, letting fly his pistol at Don\nSilvio.\n\nThe window was then immediately closed.  The appearance of our heroes,\nand their communication of the speedy arrival of the troops, was not\nwithout effect.  The criminals trembled at the idea; Don Silvio was mad\nwith rage--he pointed out to the men the necessity of immediate attack--\nthe improbability of the troops arriving so soon, and the wealth which\nhe expected was locked up by Don Rebiera in his mansion.  This rallied\nthem, and they advanced to the doors, which they attempted to force\nwithout success, losing several men by the occasional fire from those\nwithin the house.  Finding their efforts, after half an hour's repeated\nattempts, to be useless, they retreated, and then bringing up a long\npiece of timber, which required sixty men to carry it, they ran with it\nagainst the door, and the weight and impetus of the timber drove it off\nits hinges, and an entrance was obtained.  By this time it was dark, the\nlower story had been abandoned, but the barricade at the head of the\nstairs opposed their progress.  Convenient loop-holes had been prepared\nby the defenders, who now opened a smart fire upon the assailants, the\nlatter having no means of returning it effectually, had they had\nammunition for their muskets, which fortunately they had not been able\nto procure.  The combat now became fierce, and the galley-slaves were\nseveral times repulsed with great loss during a contest of two hours;\nbut, encouraged by Don Silvio, and refreshed by repeated draughts of\nwine, they continued by degrees removing the barriers opposed to them.\n\n\"We shall have to retreat!\" exclaimed Don Rebiera; \"very soon they will\nhave torn down all.  What do you think, Signor Easy?\"\n\n\"Hold this as long as we can.  How are we off for ammunition?\"\n\n\"Plenty as yet--plenty to last for six hours, I think.\"\n\n\"What do you say, Mesty?\"\n\n\"By holy St. Patrig--I say hold out here--they got no fire-arms--and we\nab um at arm-length.\"\n\nThis decision was the occasion of the first defence being held for two\nhours more, an occasional relief being afforded by the retreat of the\nconvicts to the covered carts.\n\nAt last, it was evident that the barricade was no longer tenable, for\nthe heavy pieces of furniture they had heaped up to oppose entrance were\ncompletely hammered to fragments by poles brought up by the assailants,\nand used as battering-rams.  The retreat was sounded; they all hastened\nto the other story, where the ladies were already placed, and the\ngalley-slaves were soon in possession of the first floor--exasperated by\nthe defence, mad with wine and victory, but finding nothing.\n\nAgain was the attack made upon the second landing, but, as the stairs\nwere now narrower, and their defences stronger in proportion, they for a\nlong while gained no advantage.  On the contrary, many of their men were\nwounded and taken down below.\n\nThe darkness of the night prevented both parties from seeing distinctly,\nwhich was rather in favour of the assailants.  Many climbed over the\nfortress of piled-up furniture, and were killed as soon as they appeared\non the other side, and, at last, the only ammunition used was against\nthose who made this rash attempt.  For four long hours did this assault\nand defence continue, until daylight came, and then the plan of assault\nwas altered: they again brought up the poles, hammered the pieces of\nfurniture into fragments, and gained ground.  The defenders were worn\nout with fatigue, but flinched not; they knew that their lives, and the\nlives of those dearest to them, were at stake, and they never relaxed\ntheir exertions; still the criminals, with Silvio at their head,\nprogressed, the distance between the parties gradually decreased, and\nthere was but one massive chest of drawers now defending the\nlanding-place, and over which there was a constant succession of blows\nfrom long poles and cutlasses, returned with the bullets from their\npistols.\n\n\"We must now fight for our lives,\" exclaimed Gascoigne to Easy, \"for\nwhat else can we do?\"\n\n\"Do?--get on the roof and fight there, then,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"By-the-bye, that's well thought of, Jack,\" said Gascoigne.  \"Mesty, up\nand see if there is any place we can retreat to in case of need.\"\n\nMesty hastened to obey, and soon returned with a report that there was a\ntrap-door leading into the loft under the roof, and that they could draw\nthe ladder up after them.\n\n\"Then we may laugh at them,\" cried Jack.  \"Mesty, stay here while I and\nGascoigne assist the ladies up,\" explaining to the Rebieras and to their\ndomestics why they went.\n\nEasy and Gascoigne hastened to the signora and Agnes, conducted them up\nthe ladder into the loft, and requested them to have no fear; they then\nreturned to the defences on the stairs, and joined their companions.\nThey found them hard pressed, and that there was little chance of\nholding out much longer; but the stairs were narrow, and the assailants\ncould not bring their force against them.  But now, as the defences were\nnearly destroyed, although the convicts could not reach them with their\nknives, they brought up a large supply of heavy stones, which they threw\nwith great force and execution.  Two of Don Rebiera's men and Don Martin\nwere struck down, and this new weapon proved most fatal.\n\n\"We must retreat, Jack,\" said Gascoigne, \"the stones can do no harm\nwhere we are going to.  What think you, Don Philip?\"\n\n\"I agree with you; let those who are wounded be first carried up, and\nthen we will follow.\"\n\nThis was effected, and as soon as the wounded men were carried up the\nladder, and the arms taken up to prevent their falling into the hands of\ntheir assailants, for they were now of little use to them, the\nammunition being exhausted, the whole body went into the large room\nwhich contained the trap-door of the loft, and, as soon as they were up,\nthey drew the ladder after them.  They had hardly effected this, when\nthey were followed with the yells and shoutings of the galley-slaves,\nwho had passed the last barriers, and thought themselves sure of their\nprey: but they were disappointed--they found them more secure than ever.\n\nNothing could exceed the rage of Don Silvio at the protracted resistance\nof the party, and the security of their retreat.  To get at them was\nimpossible, so he determined to set fire to the room, and suffocate\nthem, if he could do no otherwise.  He gave his directions to his men,\nwho rushed down for straw, but in so doing he carelessly passed under\nthe trap-door, and Mesty, who had carried up with him two or three of\nthe stones, dashed one down on the head of Don Silvio, who fell\nimmediately.  He was carried away, but his orders were put in execution;\nthe room was filled with straw and fodder, and lighted.  The effects\nwere soon felt.  The trap-door had been shut, but the heat and smoke\nburst through; after a time, the planks and rafters took fire, and their\nsituation was terrible.  A small trap-window in the roof on the side of\nthe house was knocked open, and gave them a temporary relief; but now\nthe rafters burned and crackled, and the smoke burst on them in thick\ncolumns.  They could not see and with difficulty could breathe.\nFortunately the room below that which had been fired was but one out of\nfour on the attics, and, as the loft they were in spread over the whole\nof the roof they were able to remove far from it.  The house was slated\nwith massive slate of some hundredweight each, and it was not found\npossible to remove them so as to give air, although frequent attempts\nwere made.  Donna Rebiera sank exhausted in the arms of her husband, and\nAgnes fell into those of our hero, who, enveloped in the smoke, kissed\nher again and again; and she, poor girl, thinking that they must all\ninevitably perish, made no scruple, in what she supposed her last\nmoment, of returning these proofs of her ardent attachment.\n\n\"Massa Easy, help me here--Massa Gascoigne, come here.  Now heab wid all\nyour might: when we get one off we get plenty.\"\n\nSummoned by Mesty, Jack and Gascoigne put their shoulders to one of the\nlower slates; it yielded--was disengaged, and slid down with a loud\nrattling below.  The ladies were brought to it, and their heads put\noutside; they soon recovered; and now that they had removed one, they\nfound no difficulty in removing others.  In a few minutes they were all\nwith their heads in the open air, but still the house was on fire below,\nand they had no chance of escape.  It was while they were debating upon\nthis point, and consulting as to their chance of safety, that a breeze\nof wind wafted the smoke that issued from the roof away from them, and\nthey beheld the detachment of troops making up to the house; a loud\ncheer was given, and attracted the notice of the soldiers.  They\nperceived Easy and his companions; the house was surrounded and entered\nin an instant.\n\nThe galley-slaves, who were in the house searching for the treasure\nreported by Don Silvio to be concealed, were captured or killed, and in\nfive minutes the troops had possession.  But how to assist those above\nwas the difficulty.  The room below was in flames, and burning fiercely.\nThere were no ladders that could reach so high, and there were no means\nof getting to them.  The commandant made signs from below, as if to ask\nwhat he was to do.\n\n\"I see no chance,\" observed Don Philip mournfully.  \"Easy, my dear\nfellow, and you, Gascoigne, I am sorry that the feuds of our family\nshould have brought you to such a dreadful death; but what can be done?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Jack, \"unless we could get ropes.\"\n\n\"You quite sure, Massa Easy, that all galley-rascals below gone?\" asked\nMesty.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Easy, \"you may see that; look at some of them bound\nthere, under charge of the soldiers.\"\n\n\"Den, sar, I tink it high time we go too.\"\n\n\"So do I, Mesty; but how?\"\n\n\"How? stop a little.\"\n\n\"Come, help me, Massa Easy; dis board (for the loft was floored) is\nloose, come help, all of you.\"\n\nThey all went, and with united strength pulled up the board.\n\n\"Now strike like ---!--and drive down de plaster,\" said Mesty,\ncommencing the operation.\n\nIn a few minutes they had beaten an opening into one of the rooms below\nnot on fire, pulled up another board, and Mesty having fetched the\nladder, they all descended in safety, and, to the astonishment of the\ncommandant of the troops, walked out of the door of the house, those who\nhad been stunned with the stones having so far recovered as to require\nlittle assistance.\n\nThe soldiers shouted as they saw them appear, supporting the females.\nThe commanding officer, who was an intimate friend of Don Philip, flew\nto his arms.  The prisoners were carefully examined by Mesty, and Don\nSilvio was not among them.  He might however, be among the dead who were\nleft in the house, which now began to burn furiously.  The galley-slaves\nwho were captured amounted in number to forty-seven.  Their dead they\ncould not count.  The major part of the plunder and the carts were still\nwhere they had been drawn up.\n\nAs soon as the culprits had been secured, the attention of the troops\nwas directed to putting out the flames, but their attempts were\nineffectual; the mansion was burned to the bare walls, and but little of\nthe furniture saved; indeed, the major part of it had been destroyed in\nthe attack made by Don Silvio and his adherents.\n\nLeaving directions with Pedro and his people, that the property\ncollected by the miscreants should be restored to the owners, Don\nRebiera ordered the horses, and with the whole party put himself under\nthe protection of the troops, who, as soon as they had been refreshed,\nand taken some repose, bent their way back to Palermo with the\ngalley-slaves, bound and linked together in a long double row.\n\nThey halted when they had gone half-way, and remained for the night.\nThe next day, at noon, Don Rebiera and his family were once more in\ntheir palazzo, and our two midshipmen and Mesty took their leave, and\nrepaired on board to make themselves a little less like\nchimney-sweepers.\n\nCaptain Wilson was not out of the ship.  Jack made his report, and then\nwent down below, very much pleased at what had passed, especially as he\nwould have another long yarn for the Governor on his return to Malta.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY TWO.\n\nIN WHICH OUR HERO AND GASCOIGNE OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES, AND\nDID FEEL WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED MIDSHIPMITE COMPUNCTION.\n\nThe _Aurora_ continued three weeks at Palermo, during which the most\nactive search had been made for the remainder of the galley-slaves, and\nsome few had been captured, but still Don Silvio, and a considerable\nnumber, were at large; and it was said that they had returned to the\nfastnesses in the mountains.  Our hero was constantly on shore at Don\nRebiera's house, and, after what had passed, he was now looked upon as\nsoon to become a member of the family.  The difference of religion was\noverlooked by Don Rebiera and the relations--by all but the confessor,\nFather Thomaso, who now began to agitate and fulminate into the ears of\nthe Donna Rebiera all the pains and penalties attending heretical\nconnection, such as excommunication and utter damnation.  The effects of\nhis remonstrances were soon visible, and Jack found that there was\nconstraint on the part of the old lady, tears on the part of Agnes, and\nall father confessors heartily wished at the devil ten times a day on\nthe part of Don Philip and his brother.  At last he wormed the truth out\nof Agnes, who told her tale, and wept bitterly.\n\n\"Ned, I don't much like the appearance of things,\" observed Jack; \"I\nmust get rid of that Father Thomaso.\"\n\n\"You'll find that rather difficult,\" observed Gascoigne; \"besides, if\nyou get rid of him you would have his place filled up with another.\"\n\n\"He has frightened that poor old woman into the dismals, and she has the\npains of purgatory on her already.  I shall go and talk to Mesty.\"\n\n\"How can Mesty help you?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but you can't; so, for want of better advice, I'll try\nthe Ashantee.\"\n\nOur hero went to Mesty, and laid the difficult affair open to him.\n\n\"I see,\" said Mesty, showing his filed teeth, \"you want him skull.\"\n\n\"No, I don't, Mesty; but I want him out of the way.\"\n\n\"How dat possible, Massa Easy?--ship sail day after to-morrow.  Now\n'pose I ab time, I soon manage all dat.  Stop a little.\"\n\n\"Confound it! but there's no stopping,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"Suppose, Massa Easy, you get leave go on shore--not come off again.\"\n\n\"That will be deserting, Mesty.\"\n\n\"By holy poker, I ab it--you go on shore and break your leg.\"\n\n\"Break my leg!--break my leave, you mean?\"\n\n\"No, Massa Easy--you break your leg--den captain leave you shore, and\nleave me take care of you.\"\n\n\"But why should I break my leg, and how am I to break my leg?\"\n\n\"Only pretend break leg, Massa Easy.  Go talk Massa Don Philip, he\nmanage all dat.--Suppose man break his leg in seven pieces, it is not\npossible to take him board.\"\n\n\"Seven pieces, Mesty! that's rather too many.  However, I'll think of\nthis.\"\n\nJack then went back and consulted Gascoigne, who approved of Mesty's\nadvice, and thought the scheme feasible.\n\n\"If we could only pretend that we were thrown out of a caricola, you\nbreak your leg, a compound fracture of course--I break my arm--both left\non shore at sick quarters, with Mesty to take care of us.\"\n\n\"Capital indeed,\" replied Jack; \"I really would not mind it if it really\ntook place; at all events we'll overturn the caricola.\"\n\n\"But shall we get leave the last day?\"\n\n\"Yes, it's two days since I have been on shore, for I have not liked to\ngo to Don Rebiera's since what Agnes told me.  Besides, my clothes are\nall on shore, and that will be an excuse for a few hours.\"\n\nOur two midshipmen applied for leave the next morning to be off in the\nafternoon.  The first lieutenant gave them permission.  They hastened to\nthe hotel, sent for Don Philip, and made him a party to their plan.  He\nreadily promised his assistance, for he had resolved that our hero\nshould marry his sister, and was fearful of the effect of his absence,\ncoupled with Friar Thomaso's influence over his mother.  He went to the\nsurgeon of his regiment, who immediately entered into the scheme.\n\nOur two midshipmen got into a caricola, rattled up and down the streets,\nand perceiving Captain Wilson at his window flogged the horse into a\ngallop: when abreast of the barracks Jack ran the wheel against a bank,\nand threw himself and Gascoigne out.  Midshipmen are never hurt by these\naccidents, but fortunately for the success of the enterprise their faces\nwere cut and bruised.  Don Philip was standing by: he called the men to\npick up our two scamps, carried them into the barracks, and sent for the\nsurgeons, who undressed them, put Jack's left leg into a multitude of\nsplints, and did the same to Gascoigne's arm.  They were then put to\nbed, their contused faces with the blood, left _in statu quo_, while Don\nPhilip sent an orderly, as from the commandant, to Captain Wilson, to\nacquaint him that two of his officers had been thrown out of a caricola,\nand were lying dangerously hurt at the barracks.\n\n\"Good heavens, it must be Mr Easy and Mr Gascoigne!\" said Captain\nWilson, when the intelligence was communicated; \"I saw them galloping\ndown the street like two madmen just now.  Coxswain, take the gig on\nboard and tell the surgeon to come on shore immediately, and bring him\nup to me at the barracks.\"\n\nCaptain Wilson then put on his hat, buckled on his sword, and hastened\nto ascertain the extent of the injury.  Don Philip kept out of the way,\nbut the captain was ushered into the room by one of the officers, where\nhe found, in two beds, our two midshipmen stretched out, the surgeon of\nthe forces and the regimental surgeon in consultation between them,\nwhile attendants were standing by each bed with restoratives.  The\nmedical gentlemen saluted Captain Wilson, and looked very grave, talked\nabout fractures, contusions, injuries, in the most interminable manner--\nhoped that Mr Easy would recover--but had doubts.  The other gentleman\nmight do well with care; that is, as far as his arm was concerned, but\nthere appeared to be a concussion of the brain.  Captain Wilson looked\nat the cut and blood-smeared faces of the two young men, and waited with\nanxiety the arrival of his own surgeon, who came at last, puffing with\nthe haste he had made, and received the report of the brothers of the\nfaculty.\n\nThe leg of Mr Easy fractured in two places--had been set--bone\nprotruding--impossible to move him.  Gascoigne, arm, compound fracture--\nconcussion of the brain not certain.  Now, that all this would have been\ndiscovered to be false if the surgeon had been able to examine, is true;\nbut how could he not credit the surgeon of the forces and the regimental\nsurgeon, and how could he put the young men to fresh tortures by\nremoving splints and unsetting limbs?  Politeness, if nothing else,\nprevented his so doing, for it would have been as much as to say that\neither he did not credit their report, or that he doubted their skill.\nHe looked at our hero and his companion, who kept their eyes closed, and\nbreathed heavily with their mouths open, put on a grave face as well as\nhis brothers in the art, and reported to Captain Wilson.\n\n\"But when can they be moved, Mr Daly?\" inquired the latter; \"I cannot\nwait; we must sail to-morrow, or the next day at the farthest.\"\n\nThe surgeon, as in duty bound, put the question to the others, who\nreplied that there would be great risk in removing before the fever,\nwhich might be expected the next day, and which might last ten days; but\nthat Captain Wilson had better not think of removing them, as they\nshould have every care and attention where they were and could rejoin\nthe ship at Malta.  Mr Daly, the surgeon, agreed that this would be the\nmost prudent step, and Captain Wilson then gave his consent.\n\nThat being settled, he walked up to the bed of Gascoigne, and spoke to\nhim; but Gascoigne knew that he was to have a concussion of the brain,\nand he made no reply, nor gave any signs of knowing that Captain Wilson\nwas near him.  He then went to our hero, who, at the sound of Captain\nWilson's voice, slowly opened his eyes without moving his head, and\nappeared to recognise him.\n\n\"Are you in much pain, Easy?\" said the captain kindly.\n\nEasy closed his eyes again, and murmured, \"Mesty, Mesty!\"\n\n\"He wants his servant, the ship's corporal, sir,\" said the surgeon.\n\n\"Well,\" replied Captain Wilson, \"he had better have him: he is a\nfaithful fellow, and will nurse him well.  When you go on board, Mr\nDaly, desire the first lieutenant to send Mesty on shore with Mr\nGascoigne's and Mr Easy's chests, and his own bag and hammock.  Good\nheavens!  I would not for a thousand pounds that this accident had\noccurred.  Poor foolish boys--they run in couples, and if one's in a\nscrape the other is sure to share it.  Gentlemen, I return you many\nthanks for your kindness, and I must accept of your promised care for my\nunfortunate officers.  I sail to-morrow at daylight.  You will oblige me\nby informing their friends, the Rebieras, of their mischance, as I am\nsure they will contribute all they can to their comfort.\"  So saying,\nCaptain Wilson bowed and quitted the room, followed by the surgeon.\n\nAs soon as the door was closed the two midshipmen turned their heads\nround and looked at each other, but they were afraid to speak at first,\nin case of the return of the surgeon.  As soon as it was announced to\nthem that Captain Wilson and Mr Daly were outside the barrack gates our\nhero commenced--\"Do you know, Ned, that my conscience smites me, and if\nit had not been that I should have betrayed those who wish to oblige us,\nwhen poor Captain Wilson appeared so much hurt and annoyed at our\naccident, I was very near getting up and telling him of the imposition,\nto relieve his mind.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, Jack, and I felt much the same--but what's done\ncannot be undone.  We must now keep up the imposition for the sake of\nthose who, to help us, have deceived him.\"\n\n\"I don't think that you would find an English surgeon who would have\nconsented to such an imposition.\"\n\n\"No, that is certain; but after all, it is an imposition that has hurt\nnobody.\"\n\n\"Oh, I do not wish to moralise--but I repent of my share in the deceit;\nand had it to be done over again I would not consent to it.\"\n\n\"Not even for ---? but I won't mention her name in barracks.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Jack; \"but let's say no more about it, and thank\nthese gentlemen for their kindness.\"\n\n\"Yes, but we must keep it up until we see the _Aurora_ under all sail.\"\n\n\"And longer too,\" replied Jack; \"we must not let the affair get wind\neven on shore.  We must not recover quickly, but still appear to\nrecover.  Don Rebiera and his wife must be deceived.  I have a plot in\nmy head, but I cannot work it out clear until I see Mesty.\"\n\nDon Philip now came in.  He had seen Captain Wilson, who had requested\nhim to look after the two invalids, and stated his intention to sail the\nnext morning.  They consulted with him, and it was agreed that no one\nshould be acquainted with the real fact but his brother Martin, and that\nall Palermo should be as much deceived as Captain Wilson, for if not, it\nwould put Father Thomaso on the _qui vive_, and make him fulminate more\nthan ever.  Our midshipmen ate an excellent dinner, and then remained in\nbed conversing till it was time to go to sleep; but long before that,\nMesty had made his appearance with their clothes.  The eyes of the\nAshantee said all that was necessary--he never spoke a word, but\nunlashed his hammock and lay down in a corner, and they were soon all\nthree asleep.\n\nThe next morning Captain Wilson called to ascertain how our hero and his\ncompanion were, but the room had been darkened, and he could not see\ntheir faces plainly.  Easy thanked him for his kindness in allowing\nMesty to attend them, and having received his orders as to their joining\nthe ship as soon as they recovered, and having promised to be very\ncautious in their behaviour and keep out of all scrapes, he wished them\na speedy recovery, and departed.\n\nIn little more than half an hour afterwards, Mesty, who had been peeping\nout of the shutters, suddenly threw them open with a loud laugh.\n\nThe _Aurora_ was under way, with studding sails below and aloft,\nstanding out of the roads.  Jack and Gascoigne got up, threw off the\nsplints, and danced about in their shirts.  As soon as they were quiet\nagain, Mesty said in a grave tone, \"Den why you stay at sea, Massa\nEasy?\"\n\n\"Very true, Mesty, I've asked myself that question often enough lately;\nbecause I'm a fool, I suppose.\"\n\n\"And I, because I can't help it,\" replied Gascoigne; \"never mind, we are\non shore now, and I look for a famous cruise.\"\n\n\"But first we must see what the ground is we are to cruise on,\" replied\nJack; \"so, Mesty, let us have a palaver, as they say in your country.\"\n\nThe two midshipmen got into their beds, and Mesty sat on the chest\nbetween them, looking as grave as a judge.  The question was, how to get\nrid of the padre Thomaso.  Was he to be thrown over the molehead to the\nfishes--or his skull broke--was Mesty's knife to be resorted to--was he\nto be kidnapped or poisoned--or were fair means to be employed--\npersuasion, bribery?  Every one knows how difficult it is to get rid of\na priest.\n\nAs our hero and Gascoigne were not Italians, they thought that bribery\nwould be the more English-like way of doing the thing; so they composed\na letter, to be delivered by Mesty to the friar, in which Jack offered\nto Father Thomaso the moderate sum of one thousand dollars, provided he\nwould allow the marriage to proceed, and not frighten the old lady with\necclesiastical squibs and crackers.\n\nAs Mesty was often on shore with Jack, and knew the friar very well by\nsight, it was agreed that the letter should be confided to his charge;\nbut, as it was not consistent that a person in such a state as our hero\nwas represented to be should sit up and write letters, the delivery was\ndeferred for a few days, when, after waiting that time, Mesty delivered\nthe letter to the friar, and made signs that he was to take back the\nanswer.  The friar beckoned him that he was to accompany him to his\nroom, where he read the letter, and then again made signs to him to\nfollow him.  The friar led the way to his monastery, and as soon as\nMesty was in his cell, he summoned another who could speak English to\nact as interpreter.\n\n\"Is your master recovering?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Mesty, \"he is at present doing well.\"\n\n\"Have you served him long?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Mesty.\n\n\"Are you very fond of him? does he treat you well, give you plenty of\nmoney?\"\n\nAt these questions, the artful black conceived that there was something\nin the wind, and he therefore very quietly replied, \"I do not care much\nfor him.\"\n\nThe friar fixed his keen eye upon Mesty, and perceived there was a\nsavage look about the black, from which he augured that he was a man who\nwould suit his purpose.\n\n\"Your master offers me a thousand dollars; would you wish to gain this\nmoney for yourself?\"\n\nMesty grinned and showed his sharp-filed teeth.\n\n\"It would make me a rich man in my own country.\"\n\n\"It would,\" replied the friar; \"now you shall have it, if you will only\ngive your master a small powder.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" replied Mesty; \"hab those things in my country.\"\n\n\"Well--do you consent?--if so, I will write the letter to get the\nmoney.\"\n\n\"Suppose they find me out?\" replied Mesty.\n\n\"You will be safe, and you shall be sent away as soon as possible--say,\nwill you consent?\"\n\n\"The whole thousand dollars?\"\n\n\"Every one of them.\"\n\n\"Den give me the powder?\"\n\n\"Stay a little,\" replied the friar, who went out of the cell, and, in\nabout ten minutes, returned with an answer to our hero's letter and a\npaper containing a grayish powder.\n\n\"Give him this in his soup or anything--spread it on his meat, or mix it\nup with his sugar if he eats an orange.\"\n\n\"I see,\" replied Mesty.\n\n\"The dollars shall be yours.  I swear it on the holy cross.\"\n\nMesty grinned horribly, took his credentials, and then asked, \"When I\ncome again?\"\n\n\"As soon as you have received the money bring it to me at Don\nRebiera's--then give the powder: as soon as it is given you must let me\nknow, for you must not remain in Palermo.  I will myself conduct you to\na place of safety.\"\n\nMesty then quitted the cell and was shown out of the monastery.\n\n\"By de holy poker he one damn rascal!\" muttered Mesty, as he was once in\nthe open air.  \"But stop a little.\"\n\nThe Ashantee soon arrived at the barracks, and repeated the whole of the\nconference between him and the Friar Thomaso.\n\n\"It must be poison, of course,\" observed Gascoigne; \"suppose we try it\nupon some animal?\"\n\n\"No, Massa Gascoigne,\" replied Mesty, \"I try it myself, by-and-bye.  Now\nwhat we do?\"\n\n\"I must give you the order for the thousand dollars, Mesty,\" replied\nJack.  \"The rascal here writes to me that for that sum he will consent\nnot only not to oppose me, but agrees to assist my cause; but the great\nquestion is, whether he will keep his word with you, Mesty; if not, I\nshall lose my money.  So therefore we must now have another palaver and\nargue the point.\"\n\nThe point was argued between Jack and Gascoigne.  A thousand dollars was\na large sum, but Jack's father was a philosopher.  After many _pros_ and\n_cons_, it was as last decided that the money should be given to Mesty;\nbut that Mesty should state, when he took the money to the friar, that\nhe had administered the powder, and claim it when he presented it.\n\nThe next day the order for the money was given to Mesty, and he went to\nthe Friar Thomaso with it.  The friar hastened with Mesty to the\nmonastery and sent for the interpreter.\n\n\"You have given it?\" inquired the friar.\n\n\"Yes--not one hour ago.  Here de order for de money.\"\n\n\"You must run for the money before he is dead, for the powder is very\nrapid.\"\n\n\"And me,\" replied Mesty, apparently much alarmed, \"where am I to go?\"\n\n\"As soon as you bring the money here, you must go back to the barracks.\nRemain there till he is dead, and then return here.  I will have all\nready, and take you, as soon as it is dusk, to a monastery of our order\nin the mountains, where no one will think of looking for you till the\naffair is blown over; and then I will find you a passage in some vessel\nout of the island.\"\n\nMesty hastened for the money, and taking it in a large bag to the\nmonastery, delivered it to the friar's charge, and then returned to the\nbarracks to Easy and Gascoigne.  It was agreed that he should go with\nthe friar, who would probably remain away some time; indeed, Mesty\ninsisted upon so doing.  Mesty stayed two hours, and then returned about\ndusk to the monastery, and reported the death of our hero.  He remained\nthere until it was dark, and then the friar ordered him to tie the bag\nof dollars to his saddle-bow.  They mounted two mules, which stood\nalready caparisoned, and quitted Palermo.\n\nIn the morning, Don Philip, as usual, made his appearance, and told our\nhero that the friar had been summoned away by the abbot, and would not\nreturn for some time.\n\n\"I came to tell you this news,\" said Don Philip, \"as I thought it would\nplease you; the sooner you are now well, the better.  I mean to propose\nyour both being removed to my father's palazzo, and then you can recover\nyour lost ground during the confessor's absence.\"\n\n\"And I have the means,\" replied Jack, showing the friar's letter.  Don\nPhilip read it with astonishment, but was still more surprised when he\nheard the whole story from Jack.  He was for a time silent: at last he\nsaid:\n\n\"I am sorry for your poor black.\"\n\n\"Why so?\" replied Jack.\n\n\"You will never see him again, depend upon it.  A thousand dollars would\nsign the death-warrant of a thousand blacks; but there is another\nreason--they will put him out of the way that he may not give evidence.\nWhere is the powder?\"\n\n\"Mesty has it; he would not part with it.\"\n\n\"He is a shrewd fellow, that black; he may be too much for the friar,\"\nreplied Don Philip.\n\n\"He means mischief, I'm sure,\" replied Gascoigne.\n\n\"Still I feel a great deal of alarm about him,\" replied Easy; \"I wish\nnow that I had not let him go.\"\n\n\"Are you sure that he went?\"\n\n\"No, I am not; but the friar told him that he should take him to the\nmountains as soon as it was dark.\"\n\n\"And probably he will,\" replied Don Philip, \"as the best place to get\nrid of him.  However, the whole of this story must be told both to my\nfather and my mother; to the former that he may take the right measures,\nand to my mother that it may open her eyes.  Give me the copy of the\nletter you wrote to the friar, and then I shall have it all.\"\n\nThe report of the accident which had occurred to Easy and Gascoigne had\nbeen spread and fully believed throughout Palermo.  Indeed, as usual, it\nhad been magnified, and asserted that they could not recover.  To Agnes\nonly had the case been imparted in confidence by Don Philip, for her\ndistress at the first intelligence had been so great that her brother\ncould not conceal it.\n\nTwo days after Don Philip had made his parents acquainted with the\nvillainy of the friar, the midshipmen were transported to the palazzo,\nmuch to the surprise of everybody, and much to the renown of the\nsurgeons, who were indemnified for their duplicity and falsehood by an\namazing extension of their credit as skilful men.\n\nAfter their arrival at the palazzo, Don Rebiera was also entrusted with\nthe secret, but it went no further.  As now there was no particular\nhurry for our hero to get well, he was contented and happy in the\nsociety of Agnes and her parents; the old lady, after she had been\ninformed of the conduct of Friar Thomaso, having turned round in our\nhero's favour, and made a vow never to have a confessor in the house\nagain.  Jack and Gascoigne were now as happy as could be; all their\nalarm was about Mesty, for whose return they were most anxious.\n\nTo Don Rebiera Jack made known formally his intentions with regard to\nAgnes.  He fully satisfied him as to his qualifications and his\nproperty, and Don Rebiera was fully aware of his debt of gratitude to\nour hero.  But all he required was the consent of Jack's father, and\nuntil this was obtained, he would not consent to the marriage taking\nplace.  Jack attempted to argue the point; his father, he said, had\nmarried without consulting him, and therefore he had a right to marry\nwithout consulting his father.  But Don Rebiera, not having any\nacquaintance with the rights of man and equality, did not feel the full\nforce of Jack's argument, and made it a _sine qua non_ that his parents\nshould write and consent to the alliance before it took place.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY THREE.\n\nIN WHICH MESTY SHOULD BE CALLED THROUGHOUT MEPHISTOPHELES, FOR IT\nABOUNDS IN BLACK CLOAKS, DISGUISES, DAGGERS, AND DARK DEEDS.\n\nOn the fourth evening after the removal of our two midshipmen to the\npalazzo of Don Rebiera, as they were sitting in company with Agnes and\nDon Philip in their own room, a friar made his appearance at the door.\nThey all started, for by his height they imagined him to be the Friar\nThomaso, but no one addressed him.  The friar shut the door without\nsaying a word, and then lifting up his cowl, which had been drawn over\nit, discovered the black face of Mesty.  Agnes screamed, and all sprang\nfrom their seats at this unusual and unexpected apparition.  Mesty\ngrinned, and there was that in his countenance which said that he had\nmuch to communicate.\n\n\"Where is the friar, Mesty?\" inquired Easy.\n\n\"Stop a little, Massa--suppose we lock door first, and den I tell all.\"\n\nTaking this precaution, Mesty threw off the friar's gown, and appeared\nin his own dress, with the bag of dollars slung round his body.\n\n\"Now, Massa Easy, I hab a long tory to tell--so I tink I better begin at\nthe beginning.\"\n\n\"It is the most approved method,\" replied Jack; \"but stop when I hold up\nmy finger, that we may translate what you say to the lady and Don\nPhilip.\"\n\n\"Dat all right, sar.  Friar and I get on two mule as soon as it quite\ndark.  He make me carry all tousand dollars--and we ride out of town.\nWe go up mountain and mountain, but the moon get up shine and we go on\ncheek by jowl--he nebber say one word, and I nebber say one word, 'cause\nI no speak his lingo, and he no understand my English.  About two\no'clock in de morning, we stop at a house and stay dere till eight\no'clock, and den we go on again all next day, up all mountain, only stop\nonce, eat a bit bread and drink lilly wine.  Second night come on, and\nden we stop again, and people bow very low to him, and woman bring in\nrabbit for make supper.  I go in the kitchen, woman make stew smell very\nnice, so I nod my head, and I say very good, and she make a face, and\nthrow on table black loaf of bread and garlic, and make sign dat for my\nsupper; good enough for black fellow, and dat rabbit stew for friar.\nDen I say to myself, stop a little; suppose friar hab all de rabbit, I\ntink I give him a lilly powder.\"\n\n\"The powder, Mesty?\" exclaimed Jack.\n\n\"What does he say?\" inquired Don Philip.\n\nGascoigne translated all that Mesty had communicated.  The interest of\nthe narrative now became exciting.  Mesty continued:\n\n\"Well, Massa Easy, den woman she go for dish to put stew in, and I take\nde powder and drop it in de pot, and den I sit down again and eat black\nbread, she say good enough for black man.  She stir up de stew once\nmore, and den she pour it out into dish, and take it to friar.  He lick\num chops, by all de powers, and he like um so well he pick all de bones,\nand wipe up gravy with him bread.  You tink it very nice, Massa Friar,\ntink I; but stop a little.  After he drink a whole bottle of wine he\ntell em bring mules to de door, and he put him hands on de woman head,\nand dat de way he pay for him supper.\n\n\"The moon shone bright, and we go up all mountain, always go up, and\n'bout two hour, he got off him mule and he put him hand so, and set down\non de rock.  He twist, and he turn and he groan for half an hour, and\nden he look at me, as much as to say, you black villain, you do this?\nfor he not able to speak, and den I pull out de paper of de powder, and\nI show him, and make him sign he swallow it: he look again, and I laugh\nat him--and he die.\"\n\n\"Oh Mesty, Mesty,\" exclaimed our hero; \"you should not have done that--\nthere will be mischief come from it.\"\n\n\"Now he dead, Massa Easy, so much less mischief.\"\n\nGascoigne then interpreted to Don Philip and Agnes, the former of whom\nlooked very grave and the latter terrified.\n\n\"Let him go on,\" said Don Philip; \"I am most anxious to hear what he did\nwith the body.\"\n\nMesty, at the request of our hero, proceeded: \"Den I thought what I\nshould do, and I said I would hide him, and I tink I take his coat for\nmyself--so I pull off him coat and I pull off all his oder clothes--he\nnot wear many--and I take the body in my arm and carry him where I find\na great split in de rock above all road.  I throw him in, and den I\nthrow plenty large pieces rock on him till I no see him any more; den I\ntake de two mules and get on mine wid de dollars, and lead the other\nthree four mile, till I come to a large wood--take off him saddle and\nbridle, turn him adrift.  Den I tear up all clothes all in lilly bits,\nhide one piece here, noder piece dere, and de saddle and bridle in de\nbush.  All right now, I say; so put on friar cloak, hide my face, get on\nmy mule, and den I look where I shall go--so I say, I not be in dis road\nanyhow.  I passed through wood till I find nother.  I go 'bout two\nmile--moon go down, all dark, and five six men catch hold my bridle, and\nthey all got arms, so I do nothing--they speak to me, but I no answer,\nand neber show my face.  They find all dollars (damn um) fast enough,\nand they lead me away through the wood.  Last we come to large fire in\nde wood, plenty of men lie 'bout, some eat and some drink.  They pull me\noff, and I hold down my head and fold my arms, just like friar do.  They\nbring me along to one man, and pour out all my dollar before him.  He\ngive some order, and they take me away, and I peep through the cloak,\nand I say to myself, he that damn galley--slave rascal Don Silvio.\"\n\n\"Don Silvio!\" cried Jack.\n\n\"What does he say of Don Silvio?\" demanded Don Philip.\n\nMesty's narrative was again translated, and he continued.\n\n\"Dey lead me away 'bout fifty yards, tie me to tree, and den dey leave\nme, and dey all drink and make merry, neber offer me anyting; so I hab\nnoting den to eat.  I eat de ropes and gnaw them through, and den I stay\nthere two hour until all go asleep, and all quiet; for I say to myself,\nstop a little.  Den when dey all fast asleep, I take out my knife and I\ncrawl 'long de ground, as we do in our country sometime--and den I stop\nand look 'bout me; no man watch but two, and dey look out for squarl,\nnot look in board where I was.  I crawl 'gain till I lay down 'longside\nthat damn galley-slave Don Silvio.  He lie fast asleep with my bag\nthousand dollars under him head.  So I tink, `you not hab dem long, you\nrascal.'  I look round--all right, and I drive my knife good aim into\nhim heart, and press toder hand on him mouth, but he make no noise; he\nstruggle little and look up, and den I throw off de head of de gown and\nshow him my black face, and he look and he try to speak; but I stop dat,\nfor down go my knife, again, and de damn galley-slave dead as herring.\"\n\n\"Stop, Mesty, we must tell this to Don Philip,\" said Gascoigne.\n\n\"Dead, Don Silvio dead! well, Mesty, we are eternally obliged to you,\nfor there was no safety for my father while he was living.  Let him go\non.\"\n\n\"So when I put de knife through his body, I lie down by him, as if\nnoting had happened, for ten minute, and den I take de bag of dollars\nfrom under him head, and den I feel him all over, and I find him pistols\nand him purse, which I hab here, all gold.  So I take them and I look--\nall asleep, and I crawl back to de tree.  Den I stay to tink a little;\nde man on watch come up and look at me, but he tink all right and he go\naway again.  Lucky ting, by de power, dat I go back to tree.  I wait\nagain, and den I crawl and crawl till I clear of all, and den I take to\nmy heel and run for um life, till daylight come, and den I so tired I\nlie down in bush: I stay in bush all day, and den I set off again back\nhere, for I find road and know my way.  I not eat den for one day and\none night, and come to house where I put my head in and find woman\nthere.  I not able to speak, so I help myself, and not show my face.\nShe not like dat and make a bobbery, but I lift up my cloak and show my\nblack face and white teeth, and den she tink me de debil.  She ran out\nof de house and I help myself very quick, and den set off and come close\nhere yesterday morning.  I hide myself all day and come in at night, and\nnow, Massa Easy, you ab all de whole truth--and you ab your tousand\ndollars--and you ab got rid of de rascal friar and de damn galley-slave\nDon Silvio.\"\n\n\"Tell them all this, Ned,\" said Jack, who, whilst Gascoigne was so\nemployed, talked with Mesty.\n\n\"I was very much frightened for you, Mesty,\" said Jack; \"but still I\nthought you quite as cunning as the friar, and so it has turned out; but\nthe thousand dollars ought to be yours.\"\n\n\"No, sar,\" replied Mesty, \"the dollars not mine; but I hab plenty of\ngold in Don Silvio's purse--plenty, plenty of gold.  I keep my property,\nMassa Easy, and you keep yours.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid that this affair may be found out, Mesty; the woman will\nspread the report of having been attacked by a black friar, and that\nwill lead to suspicion, as the other friars of the convent knew that you\nleft with Friar Thomaso.\"\n\n\"So I tink dat, but when a man starve, he quite forget his thought.\"\n\n\"I don't blame you; but now I must talk to Don Philip.\"\n\n\"Suppose you no objection, while you talk I eat something from the table\nthen, Massa Easy; for I hungry enough to eat de friar, mule and all.\"\n\n\"Eat, my good fellow, and drink as much as you please.\"\n\nThe consultation between our two midshipmen and Don Philip was not long:\nthey perceived the immediate necessity for the departure of Mesty, and\nthe suspicion which would attach to themselves.  Don Philip and Agnes\nleft them, to go to Don Rebiera, and make him acquainted with what had\npassed, and to ask his advice.\n\nWhen they went into the room, Don Rebiera immediately accosted his son.\n\n\"Have you heard, Philip, that Friar Thomaso has returned at last?--so\nthe servants tell me.\"\n\n\"The report may be fortunate,\" replied Don Philip; \"but I have another\nstory to tell you.\"\n\nHe then sat down and imparted to Don Rebiera all the adventures of\nMesty.  Don Rebiera was for some time in deep thought; at last he\nreplied:\n\n\"That Don Silvio is no more is fortunate, and the negro would be\nentitled to reward for his destruction--but for the friar, that is a bad\nbusiness.  The negro might remain and tell the whole story, and the\nfacts might be proved by the evidence of Signor Easy and the letters;\nbut what then? we should raise the whole host of the clergy against our\nhouse, and we have suffered too much from them already; the best plan\nwould be the immediate departure, not only of the negro, but of our two\nyoung friends.  The supposition of Friar Thomaso being here, and their\ndeparture with the negro servant to rejoin their ship, will remove much\nsuspicion and destroy all inquiry.  They must be off immediately.  Go to\nthem, Philip, and point out to them the absolute necessity of this\nmeasure, and tell our young friend that I rigidly adhere to my promise,\nand as soon as he has his father's sanction I will bestow upon him my\ndaughter.  In the meantime I will send down and see if a vessel can be\nchartered for Malta.\"\n\nOur hero and Gascoigne fully admitted the wisdom of this measure, and\nprepared for their departure; indeed, now that Don Rebiera's resolution\nhad been made known to our hero, he cared more for obtaining his\nfather's consent than he did for remaining to enjoy himself at Palermo,\nand before noon of the next day all was ready, the vessel had been\nprocured, Jack took his leave of Agnes and her mother, and accompanied\nby Don Rebiera and Don Philip (for Don Martin was on duty a few miles\nfrom Palermo), went down to the beach, and having bid them farewell\nembarked with Gascoigne and Mesty on board of the two-masted lateen\nwhich had been engaged, and before sunset not a steeple of Palermo was\nto be seen.\n\n\"What are you thinking of, Jack?\" said Gascoigne, after our hero had\nbeen silent half an hour.\n\n\"I have been thinking, Ned, that we are well out of it.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" replied Gascoigne; and here the conversation dropped for a\ntime.\n\n\"What are you thinking of now, Jack?\" said Gascoigne after a long pause.\n\n\"I've been thinking that I've a good story for the old Governor.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" replied Gascoigne; and both were again silent for some\ntime.\n\n\"What are you thinking of now, Jack?\" said Gascoigne, after another long\ninterval.\n\n\"I've been thinking that I shall leave the service,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"I wish you would take me with you,\" replied Gascoigne, with a sigh; and\nagain they were both in deep contemplation.\n\n\"What are you thinking of now, Jack?\" said Gascoigne again.\n\n\"Of Agnes,\" replied our hero.\n\n\"Well, if that's the case I'll call you when supper's ready.  In the\nmeantime I'll go and talk with Mesty.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY FOUR.\n\nJACK LEAVES THE SERVICE, IN WHICH HE HAD NO BUSINESS, AND GOES HOME TO\nMIND HIS OWN BUSINESS.\n\nOn the fourth day they arrived at Malta, and our two midshipmen, as soon\nas they had settled with the padrone of the vessel, went up to the\ngovernment-house.  They found the Governor in the veranda, Who held out\nboth his hands, one to each.\n\n\"Glad to see you, my lads.  Well, Jack, how's the leg, all right? don't\nlimp.  And your arm, Gascoigne?\"\n\n\"All right, sir, and as sound as ever it was,\" replied they both.\n\n\"Then you're in luck, and have made more baste than you deserve, after\nyour mad pranks; but now sit down, and I suppose, my friend Jack, you\nhave a story to tell me.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, Sir Thomas, and a very long one.\"\n\n\"Then I won't have it now, for I expect people on business; we'll have\nit after dinner.  Get your things up and take possession of your rooms.\nThe _Aurora_ sailed four days ago.  You've had a wonderful recovery.\"\n\n\"Wonderful, sir!\" replied our hero; \"all Palermo rings with it.\"\n\n\"Well, you may go now--I shall see you at dinner.  Wilson will be\ndelighted when he hears that you have got round again, for he was\nlow-spirited about it, I can tell you, which is more than you deserve.\"\n\n\"He's right there,\" said our hero to Gascoigne as they walked away.\n\nWhen dinner was over, Jack narrated to the Governor the adventures of\nMesty, with which he was much interested; but when they were quite alone\nin the evening, the Governor called our two midshipmen into the veranda,\nand said:\n\n\"Now, my lads, I'm not going to preach, as the saying is, but I've been\nlong enough in the world to know that a compound fracture of the leg is\nnot cured in fourteen or sixteen days.  I ask you to tell me the truth.\nDid not you deceive Captain Wilson on this point?\"\n\n\"I am ashamed to say that we did, sir,\" replied Easy.\n\n\"How did you manage that, and why?\"\n\nJack then went into further details relative to himself and his amour,\nstating his wish to be left behind and all that had passed.\n\n\"Well, there's some excuse for you, but none for the surgeons.  If any\nsurgeon here had played such a trick, I would have hung him, as sure as\nI'm Governor.  This affair of yours has become serious.  Mr Easy, we\nmust have some conversation on the matter to-morrow morning.\"\n\nThe next morning the packet from England was reported off the harbour's\nmouth.  After breakfast the letters were brought on shore, and the\nGovernor sent for our hero.\n\n\"Mr Easy, here are two letters for you, I am sorry to say with black\nseals.  I trust that they do not bring the intelligence of the death of\nany very near relative.\"\n\nJack bowed without speaking, took the letters, and went to his room.\nThe first he opened was from his father.\n\n\"My Dear John--\n\n\"You will be much grieved to hear that your poor mother, after sitting\nin the corner for nearly two years waiting for the millennium, appeared\nto pine away; whether from disappointment or not I do not know; but at\nlast, in spite of all Dr Middleton could do, she departed this life;\nand, as the millennium would not come to her as she expected, it is to\nbe hoped she is gone to the millennium.  She was a good wife, and I\nalways let her have her own way.  Dr Middleton does not appear to be\nsatisfied as to the cause of her death, and has wished to examine; but I\nsaid no, for I am a philosopher, and it is no use looking for causes\nafter effects; but I have done since her death what she never would\npermit me to do during her life.  I have had her head shaved, and\nexamined it very carefully as a phrenologist, and most curiously has she\nproved the truth of the sublime science.  I will give you the result.\nDetermination, very prominent; Benevolence, small; Caution, extreme;\nVeneration, not very great; Philo-progenitiveness, strange to say, is\nvery large, considering she has but one child; Imagination very strong:\nyou know, my dear boy, she was always imagining some nonsense or\nanother.  Her other organs were all moderate.  Poor dear creature! she\nis gone, and we may well wail, for a better mother or a better wife\nnever existed.  And now, my dear boy, I must request that you call for\nyour discharge, and come home as soon as possible.  I cannot exist\nwithout you, and I require your assistance in the grand work I have in\ncontemplation.  The time is at hand, the cause of equality will soon\ntriumph; the abject slaves now hold up their heads; I have electrified\nthem with my speeches, but I am getting old and feeble; I require my son\nto leave my mantle to, as one prophet did to another, and then I will,\nlike him, ascend in glory.--Your affectionate Father:--\n\n\"NICODEMUS EASY.\"\n\nFrom this it would appear, thought Jack, that my mother is dead, and\nthat my father is mad.  For some time our hero remained in a melancholy\nmood; he dropped many tears to the memory of his mother, whom, if he had\nnever respected, he had much loved; and it was not till half an hour had\nelapsed, that he thought of opening the other letter.  It was from Dr\nMiddleton.\n\n\"My Dear Boy,--\n\n\"Although not a correspondent of yours, I take the right of having\nwatched you through all your childhood, and from a knowledge of your\ndisposition, to write you a few lines.  That you have by this time\ndiscarded your father's foolish, nonsensical philosophy, I am very sure.\nIt was I who advised your going away for that purpose, and I am sure\nthat, as a young man of sense and the heir to a large property, you will\nbefore this have seen the fallacy of your father's doctrines.  Your\nfather tells me that he has requested you to come home, and allow me to\nadd any weight I may have with you in persuading you to do the same.  It\nis fortunate for you that the estate is entailed, or you might soon be a\nbeggar, for there is no saying what debts he might, in his madness, be\nguilty of.  He has already been dismissed from the magistracy by the\nlord lieutenant, in consequence of his haranguing the discontented\npeasantry, and, I may say, exciting them to acts of violence and\ninsubordination.  He has been seen dancing and hurrahing round a stack\nfired by an incendiary.  He has turned away his keepers, and allowed all\npoachers to go over the manor.  In short, he is not in his senses; and,\nalthough I am far from advising coercive measures, I do consider that it\nis absolutely necessary that you should immediately return home and look\nafter what will one day be your property.  You have no occasion to\nfollow the profession with eight thousand pounds per annum.  You have\ndistinguished yourself--now make room for those who require it for their\nsubsistence.  God bless you.  I shall soon hope to shake hands with you.\n\n\"Yours most truly:--\n\n\"G. Middleton.\"\n\nThere was matter for deep reflection in these two letters, and Jack\nnever felt before how much his father had been in the wrong.  That he\nhad gradually been weaned from his ideas was true, but still he had, to\na certain degree, clung to them, as we do to a habit; but now he felt\nthat his eyes were opened; the silly, almost unfeeling, letter of his\nfather upon the occasion of his mother's death opened his eyes.  For a\nlong while Jack was in a melancholy meditation, and then, casting his\neyes upon his watch, he perceived that it was almost dinner-time.  That\nhe could eat his dinner was certain, and he scorned to pretend to feel\nwhat he did not.  He therefore dressed himself and went down, grave, it\nis true, but not in tears.  He spoke little at dinner, and retired as\nsoon as it was over, presenting his two letters to the Governor, and\nasking his advice for the next morning.  Gascoigne followed him, and to\nhim he confided his trouble; and Ned, finding that Jack was very\nlow-spirited, consoled him to the best of his power, and brought a\nbottle of wine which he procured from the butler.  Before they retired\nto bed, Jack had given his ideas to his friend, which were approved of,\nand wishing him a good-night, he threw himself into bed, and was soon\nfast asleep.\n\n\"One thing is certain, my good fellow,\" observed the Governor to our\nhero, as he gave him back his letters at the breakfast table the next\nmorning; \"that your father is as mad as a March hare.  I agree with that\ndoctor, who appears a sensible man, that you had better go home\nimmediately.\"\n\n\"And leave the service altogether, sir?\" replied Jack.\n\n\"Why, I must say that I do not think you exactly fitted for it.  I shall\nbe sorry to lose you, as you have a wonderful talent for adventure, and\nI shall have no more yarns to hear when you return: but, if I understand\nright from Captain Wilson, you were brought into the profession because\nhe thought that the service might be of use in eradicating false\nnotions, rather than from any intention or necessity of your following\nit up as a profession.\"\n\n\"I suspect that was the case, sir,\" replied Jack; \"as for my own part, I\nhardly know why I entered it.\"\n\n\"To find a mare's nest, my lad; I've heard all about it; but never mind\nthat, the question is now about your leaving it to look after your own\nproperty, and I think I may venture to say that I can arrange all that\nmatter at once, without referring to admiral or captain.  I will be\nresponsible for you, and you may go home in the packet which sails on\nWednesday for England.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Sir Thomas, I am much obliged to you,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"You, Mr Gascoigne, I shall, of course, send out by the first\nopportunity to rejoin your ship.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Sir Thomas, I am much obliged to you,\" replied Gascoigne,\nmaking a bow.\n\n\"You'll break no more arms, if you please, sir,\" continued the Governor;\n\"a man in love may have some excuse for breaking his leg, but you had\nnone.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir; if Mr Easy was warranted in breaking his leg\nout of love, I submit that I could do no less than break my arm out of\nfriendship.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, sir, or I'll break your head from the very opposite\nfeeling,\" replied the Governor, good-humouredly.  \"But observe, young\nman, I shall keep this affair secret, as in honour bound; but let me\nadvise you, as you have only your profession to look to, to follow it up\nsteadily.  It is high time that you and Mr Easy were separated.  He is\nindependent of the service, and you are not.  A young man possessing\nsuch ample means will never be fitted for the duties of a junior\nofficer.  He can do no good for himself, and is certain to do much harm\nto others: a continuance of his friendship would probably end in your\nruin, Mr Gascoigne.  You must be aware that if the greatest indulgence\nhad not been shown to Mr Easy by his captain and first lieutenant, he\nnever could have remained in the service so long as he has done.\"\n\nAs the Governor made the last remark in rather a severe tone, our two\nmidshipmen were silent for a minute.  At last Jack observed, very\nquietly:\n\n\"And yet, sir, I think, considering all, I have behaved pretty well.\"\n\n\"You have behaved very well, my good lad, on all occasions in which your\ncourage and conduct, as an officer, have been called forth.  I admit it;\nand had you been sent to sea with a mind properly regulated, and without\nsuch an unlimited command of money, I have no doubt but that you would\nhave proved an ornament to the service.  Even now I think you would, if\nyou were to remain in the service under proper guidance and necessary\nrestrictions, for you have, at least, learned to obey, which is\nabsolutely necessary before you are fit to command.  But recollect, what\nwould your conduct have brought upon you if you had not been under the\nparental care of Captain Wilson?  But let us say no more about that: a\nmidshipman with the prospect of eight thousand pounds a year is an\nanomaly which the service cannot admit, especially when that midshipman\nis resolved to take to himself a wife.\"\n\n\"I hope that you approve of that step, sir.\"\n\n\"That entirely depends upon the merit of the party, which I know nothing\nof, except that she has a pretty face, and is of one of the best\nSicilian families.  I think the difference of religion a ground of\nobjection.\"\n\n\"We will argue that point, sir,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"Perhaps it will be the cause of more argument than you think for, Mr\nEasy; but every man makes his own bed, and as he makes it, so must he\nlie down in it.\"\n\n\"What am I to do about Mesty, sir?  I cannot bear the idea of parting\nwith him.\"\n\n\"I am afraid that you must; I cannot well interfere there.\"\n\n\"He is of little use to the service, sir; he has been sent to sick\nquarters as my servant: if he may be permitted to go home with me, I\nwill procure his discharge as soon as I arrive, and send him on board\nthe guard-ship till I obtain it.\"\n\n\"I think that, on the whole, he is as well out of the service as in it,\nand therefore I will, on consideration, take upon myself the\nresponsibility, provided you do as you say.\"\n\nThe conversation was here ended, as the Governor had business to attend\nto, and Jack and Gascoigne went to their rooms to make their\narrangements.\n\n\"The Governor is right,\" observed Gascoigne; \"it is better that we part,\nJack.  You have half unfitted me for the service already; I have a\ndisgust of the midshipmen's berth; the very smell of pitch and tar has\nbecome odious to me.  This is all wrong; I must forget you and all our\npleasant cruises on shore, and once more swelter in my greasy jacket.\nWhen I think that if our pretended accidents were discovered, I should\nbe dismissed the service, and the misery which that would cause to my\npoor father, I tremble at my escape.  The Governor is right, Jack: we\nmust part, but I hope you never will forget me.\"\n\n\"My hand upon it, Ned.  Command my interest, if ever I have any--my\nmoney--what I have, and the house, whether it belongs to me or my\nfather--as far as you are concerned at least, I adhere to my notions of\nperfect equality.\"\n\n\"And abjure them, I trust, Jack, as a universal principle.\"\n\n\"I admit, as the Governor asserts, that my father is as mad as a March\nhare.\"\n\n\"That is sufficient; you don't know how glad it makes me to hear you say\nthat.\"\n\nThe two friends were inseparable during the short time that they\nremained together.  They talked over their future prospects, their hopes\nand anticipations, and when the conversation flagged, Gascoigne brought\nup the name of Agnes.\n\nMesty's delight at leaving the service, and going home with his patron,\nwas indescribable.  He laid out a portion of his gold in a suit of plain\nclothes, white linen shirts, and in every respect the wardrobe of a man\nof fashion; in fact, he was now a complete gentleman's gentleman; was\nvery particular in frizzing his woolly hair--wore a white neckcloth,\ngloves, and cane.  Every one felt inclined to laugh when he made his\nappearance; but there was some in Mesty's look, which, at all events,\nprevented their doing so before his face.  The day for sailing arrived.\nJack took leave of the Governor, thanking him for his great kindness,\nand stating his intention of taking Malta in his way out to Palermo in a\nmonth or two.  Gascoigne went on board with him, and did not go down the\nvessel's side till it was more than a mile clear of the harbour.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY FIVE.\n\nMR. EASY'S WONDERFUL INVENTION FULLY EXPLAINED BY HIMSELF--MUCH TO THE\nSATISFACTION OF OUR HERO, AND, IT IS TO BE PRESUMED, TO THAT ALSO OF THE\nREADER.\n\nAt last the packet anchored in Falmouth Roads.  Jack, accompanied by\nMesty, was soon on shore with his luggage, threw himself into the mail,\narrived in London, and waiting there two or three days to obtain what he\nconsidered necessary from a fashionable tailor, ordered a chaise to\nForest Hill.  He had not written to his father to announce his arrival,\nand it was late in the morning when the chaise drew up at his father's\ndoor.\n\nJack stepped out and rang the bell.  The servants who opened the door\ndid not know him; they were not the same as those he left.\n\n\"Where is Mr Easy?\" demanded Jack.\n\n\"Who are you?\" replied one of the men, in a gruff tone.\n\n\"By de powers, you very soon find out who he is,\" observed Mesty.\n\n\"Stay here, and I'll see if he is at home.\"\n\n\"Stay here! stay in the hall like a footman?  What do you mean, you\nrascal?\" cried Jack, attempting to push by the man.\n\n\"Oh, that won't do here, master; this is Equality Hall; one man's as\ngood as another.\"\n\n\"Not always,\" replied Jack knocking him down.  \"Take that for your\ninsolence, pack up your traps, and walk out of the house to-morrow\nmorning.\"\n\nMesty in the meantime, had seized the other by the throat.\n\n\"What I do with this fellow, Massa Easy?\"\n\n\"Leave him now, Mesty; we'll settle their account to-morrow morning.  I\npresume I shall find my father in the library.\"\n\n\"His father!\" said one of the men to the other; \"he's not exactly a chip\nof the old block.\"\n\n\"We shall have a change, I expect,\" replied the other, as they walked\naway.\n\n\"Mesty,\" cried Jack, in an authoritative tone, \"bring those two rascals\nback to take the luggage out of the chaise; pay the postilion, and tell\nthe housekeeper to show you my room and yours.  Come to me for orders as\nsoon as you have done this.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Mesty.  \"Now come here, you damn blackguard, and\ntake tings out of chaise, or by de holy poker I choke your luff, both of\nyou.\"\n\nThe filed teeth, the savage look, and determination of Mesty, had the\ndue effect.  The men sullenly returned and unloaded the chaise.  In the\nmeantime, Jack walked into his father's study; his father was there--the\nstudy was lighted up with argand lamps, and Jack looked with\nastonishment.  Mr Easy was busy with a plaster cast of a human head,\nwhich he pored over, so that he did not perceive the entrance of his\nson.  The cast of the skull was divided into many compartments, with\nwriting on each; but what most astonished our hero was the alteration in\nthe apartment.  The book-cases and books had all been removed, and in\nthe centre, suspended from the ceiling, was an apparatus which would\nhave puzzled any one, composed of rods in every direction, with screws\nat the end of them, and also tubes in equal number, one of which\ncommunicated with a large air-pump, which stood on a table.  Jack took a\nshort survey, and then walked up to his father and accosted him.\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Mr Easy, \"is it possible?--yes, it is my son John!\nI'm glad to see you, John--very glad indeed,\" continued the old\ngentleman, shaking him by both hands--\"very glad that you have come\nhome: I wanted you--wanted your assistance in my great and glorious\nproject, which, I thank Heaven, is now advancing rapidly.  Very soon\nshall equality and the rights of man be proclaimed everywhere.  The\npressure from without is enormous, and the bulwarks of our ridiculous\nand tyrannical constitution must give way.  King, lords, and\naristocrats; landholders, tithe-collectors, church and state, thank God,\nwill soon be overthrown, and the golden age revived--the millennium, the\ntrue millennium--not what your poor mother talked about.  I am at the\nhead of twenty-nine societies, and if my health lasts, you will see what\nI will accomplish now that I have your assistance, Jack;\" and Mr Easy's\neyes sparkled and flashed in all the brilliancy of incipient insanity.\n\nJack sighed, and to turn the conversation he observed, \"You have made a\ngreat change in this room, sir.  What may all this be for?  Is it a\nmachine to improve equality and the rights of man?\"\n\n\"My dear son,\" replied Mr Easy, sitting down, and crossing his legs\ncomplacently, with his two hands under his right thigh, according to his\nusual custom when much pleased with himself--\"why, my dear son, that is\nnot exactly the case, and yet you have shown some degree of perception\neven in your guess; for if my invention succeeds, and I have no doubt of\nit, I shall have discovered the great art of rectifying the mistakes of\nnature, and giving an equality of organisation to the whole species, of\nintroducing all the finer organs of humanity, and of destroying the\nbaser.  It is a splendid invention, Jack, very splendid.  They may talk\nof Gall and Spurzheim, and all those; but what have they done? nothing\nbut divided the brain into sections, classed the organs, and discovered\nwhere they reside; but what good result has been gained from that? the\nmurderer by nature remained a murderer--the benevolent man, a benevolent\nman--he could not alter his organisation.  I have found out how to\nchange all that.\"\n\n\"Surely, sir, you would not interfere with the organ of benevolence?\"\n\n\"But indeed I must, Jack.  I myself am suffering from my organ of\nbenevolence being too large; I must reduce it, and then I shall be\ncapable of greater things, shall not be so terrified by difficulties,\nshall overlook trifles, and only carry on great schemes for universal\nequality and the supreme rights of man.  I have put myself into that\nmachine every morning for two hours, for these last three months, and I\nfeel now that I am daily losing a great portion.\"\n\n\"Will you do me the favour to explain an invention so extraordinary,\nsir,\" said our hero.\n\n\"Most willingly, my boy.  You observe that in the centre there is a\nframe to confine the human head, somewhat larger than the head itself,\nand that the head rests upon the iron collar beneath.  When the head is\nthus firmly fixed, suppose I want to reduce the size of any particular\norgan, I take the boss corresponding to where that organ is situated in\nthe cranium, and fix it on it.  For you will observe that all the bosses\ninside of the top of the frame correspond to the organs as described in\nthis plaster-cast on the table.  I then screw down pretty tight, and\nincrease the pressure daily, until the organ disappears altogether, or\nis reduced to the size required.\"\n\n\"I comprehend that part perfectly, sir,\" replied Jack; \"but now explain\nto me by what method you contrive to raise an organ which does not\npreviously exist.\"\n\n\"That,\" replied Mr Easy, \"is the greatest perfection of the whole\ninvention, for without I could do that, I could have done little.  I\nfeel convinced that this invention of mine will immortalise me.  Observe\nall these little bell-glasses which communicate with the air-pump.  I\nshave my patient's head, grease it a little, and fix on the bell-glass,\nwhich is exactly shaped to fit the organ in length and breadth.  I work\nthe air-pump, and raise the organ by an exhausted receiver.  It cannot\nfail.  There is my butler, now; a man who escaped hanging last spring\nassizes on an undoubted charge of murder.  I selected him on purpose; I\nhave flattened down murder to nothing, and I have raised benevolence\ntill it's like a wen.\"\n\n\"I am afraid my poor father's head is an exhausted receiver,\" thought\nJack, who then replied, \"Well, sir, if it succeeds it will be a good\ninvention.\"\n\n\"If it succeeds!--why, it has succeeded!--it cannot fail.  It has cost\nme near two thousand pounds.  By-the-bye, Jack, you have drawn very\nliberally lately, and I had some trouble, with my own expenses, to meet\nyour bills; not that I complain--but what with societies, and my\nmachine, and tenants refusing to pay their rents on the principle that\nthe farms are no more mine than theirs, which I admit to be true, I have\nhad some difficulty in meeting all demands.\"\n\n\"The Governor was right,\" thought Jack, who now inquired after Dr\nMiddleton.\n\n\"Ah, poor silly man! he's alive yet--I believe doing well.  He is one\nwho will interfere with the business of others, complains of my\nservants--very silly man indeed--but I let him have his own way.  So I\ndid your poor mother.  Silly woman, Mrs Easy--but never mind that.\"\n\n\"If you please, sir, I have also a complaint to make of the servants for\ntheir insolence to me: but we will adjourn, if you please, as I wish to\nhave some refreshment.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Jack, if you are hungry; I will go with you.  Complain of my\nservants, say you?--there must be some mistake--they are all shaved, and\nwear wigs, and I put them in the machine every other morning; but I mean\nto make an alteration in one respect.  You observe, Jack, it requires\nmore dignity: we must raise the whole machinery some feet, ascend it\nwith state as a throne, for it is the throne of reason, the victory of\nmind over nature.\"\n\n\"As you please, sir; but I am really hungry just now.\"\n\nJack and his father went into the drawing-room and rang the bell; not\nbeing answered, Jack rose and rang again.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" observed Mr Easy, \"you must not be in a hurry; every man\nnaturally provides for his own wants first, and afterwards for those of\nothers.  Now my servants--\"\n\n\"Are a set of insolent scoundrels, sir, and insolence I never permit.  I\nknocked one down as I entered your house, and, with your permission, I\nwill discharge two, at least, to-morrow.\"\n\n\"My dear son,\" exclaimed Mr Easy, \"you knocked my servant down!--are\nyou not aware by the laws of equality--\"\n\n\"I am aware of this, my dear father,\" replied Jack, \"that by all the\nlaws of society we have a right to expect civility and obedience from\nthose we pay and feed.\"\n\n\"Pay and feed!  Why, my dear son--my dear Jack--you must recollect--\"\n\n\"I recollect, sir, very well; but if your servants do not come to their\nrecollection in a very short time, either I or they must quit the\nhouse.\"\n\n\"But, my dear boy, have you forgotten the principles I instilled into\nyou?  Did you not go to sea to obtain that equality foiled by tyranny\nand despotism here on shore?  Do you not acknowledge and support my\nphilosophy?\"\n\n\"We'll argue that point to-morrow, sir--at present I want to obtain my\nsupper;\" and Jack rang the bell furiously.\n\nThe butler made his appearance at this last summons, and he was followed\nby Mesty, who looked like a demon with anger.\n\n\"Mercy on me, whom have we here?\"\n\n\"My servant, father,\" exclaimed Jack, starting up; \"one that I can trust\nto, and who will obey me.  Mesty, I wish some supper and wine to be\nbrought immediately--see that scoundrel gets it ready in a moment.  If\nhe does not, throw him out of the door, and lock him out.  You\nunderstand me.\"\n\n\"Yes, massa,\" grinned Mesty; \"now you hab supper very quick, or Mesty\nknow the reason why.  Follow me, sar,\" cried Mesty, in an imperative\ntone to the butler; \"quick, sar, or by de holy poker, I show you what\nMesty can do;\" and Mesty grinned in his wrath.\n\n\"Bring supper and wine immediately,\" said Mr Easy, giving an order such\nas the butler had never heard since he had been in the house.\n\nThe butler quitted the room, followed by the Ashantee.\n\n\"My dear boy--my Jack--I can make every allowance for hunger, it is\noften the cause of theft and crime in the present unnatural state of\nsociety--but really you are too violent.  The principles--\"\n\n\"Your principles are all confounded nonsense, father,\" cried Jack in a\nrage.\n\n\"What, Jack! my son--what do I hear?  This from you--nonsense!  Why,\nJack, what has Captain Wilson been doing with you?\"\n\n\"Bringing me to my senses, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, oh, dear! my dear Jack, you will certainly make me lose\nmine.\"\n\n\"Gone already,\" thought Jack.\n\n\"That you, my child, so carefully brought up in the great and glorious\nschool of philosophy, should behave this way--should be so violent--\nforget your sublime philosophy, and all--just like Esau, selling your\nbirthright for a mess of pottage.  Oh, Jack, you'll kill me! and yet I\nlove you, Jack--whom else have I to love in this world?  Never mind,\nwe'll argue the point, my boy--I'll convince you--in a week all will be\nright again.\"\n\n\"It shall, sir, if I can manage it,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"That's right, I love to hear you say so--that's consoling, very\nconsoling--but I think now I was wrong to let you go to sea, Jack.\"\n\n\"Indeed you were not, father.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm glad to hear you say so; I thought they had ruined you,\ndestroyed all your philosophy--but it will be all right again--you shall\ncome to our societies, Jack--I am president--you shall hear me speak,\nJack--you shall hear me thunder like Demosthenes--but here comes the\ntray.\"\n\nThe butler, followed by Mesty, who attended him as if he was his\nprisoner, now made his appearance with the tray--laid it down in a sulky\nmanner and retired.  Jack desired Mesty to remain.\n\n\"Well, Mesty, how are they getting on in the servants' hall?\"\n\n\"Regular mutiny, sar--ab swear dat dey no stand our nonsense, and dat we\nboth leave the house to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Do you hear, sir, your servants declare that I shall leave your house\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"You leave my house, Jack, after four years' absence!--no, no.  I'll\nreason with them--I'll make them a speech.  You don't know how I can\nspeak, Jack.\"\n\n\"Look you, father, I cannot stand this; either give me a carte-blanche\nto arrange this household as I please, or I shall quit it myself\nto-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Quit my house, Jack! no, no--shake hands and make friends with them; be\ncivil, and they will serve you--but you know upon the principles--\"\n\n\"Principles of the devil!\" cried Jack in a rage.\n\n\"Of the devil, Jack; dear me!  I wish you had never gone to sea.\"\n\n\"In one word, sir, do you consent, or am I to leave the house?\"\n\n\"Leave the house!  Oh, no; not leave the house, Jack.  I have no son but\nyou.  Then do as you please--but you must not send away my murderer, for\nI must have him cured, and shown as a proof of my wonderful invention.\"\n\n\"Mesty, get my pistols ready for to-morrow morning, and your own too--do\nye hear?\"\n\n\"All ready, massa,\" replied Mesty; \"I tink dat right.\"\n\n\"Right!--pistols, Jack!  What do you mean?\"\n\n\"It is possible, father, that you may not have yet quite cured your\nmurderer, and therefore it is as well to be prepared.  I will now wish\nyou goodnight; but before I go, you will be pleased to summon one of the\nservants that he may inform the others that the household is under my\ncontrol for the future.\"\n\nThe bell was again rung, and was this time answered with more\nexpedition.  Jack told the servant, in the presence of his father, that,\nwith the consent of the latter, he should hereafter take the whole\ncontrol of the establishment, and that Mesty would be the major-domo\nfrom whom they would receive their orders.  The man stared, and cast an\nappealing look to Mr Easy, who hesitated, and at last said:\n\n\"Yes, William; you'll apologise to all, and say that I have made the\narrangement.\"\n\n\"You apologise to none, sir,\" cried Jack; \"but tell them that I will\narrange the whole business to-morrow morning.  Tell the woman to come\nhere and show me my bedroom.  Mesty, get your supper and then come up to\nme; if they dare to refuse you, recollect who does, and point them out\nto-morrow morning.  That will do, sir; away with you, and bring flat\ncandlesticks.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY SIX.\n\nIN WHICH JACK TAKES UP THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT, AND PROVES THAT\nHE CAN ARGUE AS WELL ON ONE SIDE AS THE OTHER.\n\nThis scene may give some idea of the state of Mr Easy's household upon\nour hero's arrival.  The poor lunatic, for such we must call him, was at\nthe mercy of his servants, who robbed, laughed at, and neglected him.\nThe waste and expense were enormous.  Our hero, who found how matters\nstood, went to bed, and lay the best part of the night revolving what to\ndo.  He determined to send for Dr Middleton, and consult him.\n\nThe next morning Jack rose early; Mesty was in the room, with warm\nwater, as soon as he rang.\n\n\"By de power, Massa Easy, your fader very silly old man.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid so,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"He not right here,\" observed Mesty, putting his fingers to his head.\n\nJack sighed, and desired Mesty to send one of the grooms up to the door.\nWhen the man knocked he desired him to mount a horse and ride over to\nDr Middleton, and request his immediate attendance.\n\nThe man, who was really a good servant, replied, \"Yes, sir,\" very\nrespectfully, and hastened away.\n\nJack went down to breakfast, and found it all ready, but his father was\nnot in the room: he went to his study, and found him occupied with a\ncarpenter who was making a sort of a frame as the model of the platform\nor dais to be raised under the wonderful invention.  Mr Easy was so\nbusy that he could not come to breakfast, so Jack took his atone.  An\nhour after this Dr Middleton's carriage drove up to the door.  The\ndoctor heartily greeted our hero.\n\n\"My dear sir--for so I suppose I must now call you--I am heartily glad\nthat you have returned.  I can assure you that it is not a moment too\nsoon.\"\n\n\"I have found that out already, doctor,\" replied Jack: \"sit down.  Have\nyou breakfasted?\"\n\n\"No, I have not; for I was so anxious to see you, that I ordered my\ncarriage at once.\"\n\n\"Then sit down, doctor, and we will talk over matters quietly.\"\n\n\"You, of course, perceive the state of your father.  He has been some\ntime quite unfit to manage his own affairs.\"\n\n\"So I am afraid.\"\n\n\"What do you intend to do then--put them in the hands of trustees?\"\n\n\"I will be trustee for myself, Dr Middleton.  I could not do the other\nwithout submitting my poor father to a process and confinement which I\ncannot think of.\"\n\n\"I can assure you that there are not many in Bedlam worse than he is;\nbut I perfectly agree with you; that is, if he will consent to your\ntaking charge of the property.\"\n\n\"A power of attorney will be all that is requisite,\" replied Jack; \"that\nis, as soon as I have rid the house of the set of miscreants who are in\nit, and who are now in open mutiny.\"\n\n\"I think,\" replied the doctor, \"that you will have some trouble.  You\nknow the character of the butler.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have it from my father's own mouth.  I really should take it as\na great favour, Dr Middleton, if you could stay here a day or two.  I\nknow that you have retired from practice.\"\n\n\"I would have made the same offer, my young friend.  I will come here\nwith two of my servants; for you must discharge these.\"\n\n\"I have one of my own who is worth his weight in gold--that will be\nsufficient.  I will dismiss every man you think I ought, and as for the\nwomen, we can give them warning, and replace them at leisure.\"\n\n\"That is exactly what I should propose,\" replied the doctor.  \"I will\nnow go, if you please, procure the assistance of a couple of constables,\nand also of your father's former, legal adviser, who shall prepare a\npower of attorney.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Jack, \"and we must then find out the tenants who refuse\nto pay upon the principles of equality, and he shall serve them with\nnotice immediately.\"\n\n\"I am rejoiced, my dear young friend, to perceive that your father's\nabsurd notions have not taken root.\"\n\n\"They lasted some time nevertheless, doctor,\" replied Jack, laughing.\n\n\"Well then, I will only quit you for an hour or two, and then, as you\nwish it, will take up my quarters here as long as you find me useful.\"\n\nIn the forenoon, Dr Middleton again made his appearance, accompanied by\nMr Hanson, the solicitor, bringing with him his portmanteau and his\nservants.  Mr Easy had come into the parlour, and was at breakfast when\nthey entered.  He received them very coolly; but a little judicious\npraise of the wonderful invention had its due effect; and after Jack had\nreminded him of his promise that in future he was to control the\nhousehold, he was easily persuaded to sign the order for his so doing--\nthat is, the power of attorney.\n\nMr Easy also gave up to Jack the key of his secretary, and Mr Hanson\npossessed himself of the books, papers, and receipts necessary to\nascertain the state of his affairs, and the rents which had not yet been\npaid up.  In the meantime the constables arrived.  The servants were all\nsummoned; Mr Hanson showed them the power of attorney empowering Jack\nto act for his father, and in less than half an hour afterwards all the\nmen-servants, but two grooms, were dismissed: the presence of the\nconstables and Mesty prevented any resistance, but not without various\nthreats on the part of the butler, whose name was O'Rourke.  Thus, in\ntwenty-four hours, Jack had made a reformation in the household.\n\nMr Easy took no notice of anything; he returned to his study and his\nwonderful invention.  Mesty had received the keys of the cellar, and had\nnow complete control over those who remained.  Dr Middleton, Mr\nHanson, Mr Easy, and Jack, sat down to dinner, and everything wore the\nappearance of order and comfort.  Mr Easy ate very heartily, but said\nnothing till after dinner, when, as was his usual custom, he commenced\narguing upon the truth and soundness of his philosophy.\n\n\"By-the-bye, my dear son, if I recollect right, you told me last night\nthat you were no longer of my opinion.  Now, if you please, we will\nargue this point.\"\n\n\"I'll argue the point with all my heart, sir,\" replied Jack; \"will you\nbegin?\"\n\n\"Let's fill our glasses,\" cried Mr Easy triumphantly; \"let's fill our\nglasses, and then I will bring Jack back to the proper way of thinking.\nNow then, my son, I trust you will not deny that we were all born\nequal.\"\n\n\"I do deny it, sir,\" replied Jack; \"I deny it _in toto_--I deny it from\nthe evidence of our own senses, and from the authority of Scripture.  To\nsuppose all men were born equal is to suppose that they are equally\nendowed with the same strength and with the same capacity of mind, which\nwe know is not the case.  I deny it from Scripture, from which I could\nquote many passages; but I will restrict myself to one--the parable of\nthe Talents: `To one he gave five talents, to another but one,' holding\nthem responsible for the trust reposed in them.  We are all intended to\nfill various situations in society, and are provided by Heaven\naccordingly.\"\n\n\"That may be,\" replied Mr Easy; \"but that does not prove that the earth\nwas not intended to be equally distributed among all alike.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon; the proof that that was not the intention of\nProvidence is that that equality, allowing it to be put in practice,\ncould never be maintained.\"\n\n\"Not maintained!--no, because the strong oppress the weak, tyrants rise\nup and conquer--men combine to do wrong.\"\n\n\"Not so, my dear father; I say it could not be maintained without the\norganisation of each individual had been equalised and several other\npoints established.  For instance, allowing that every man had, _ab\norigine_, a certain portion of ground, he who was the strongest or the\ncleverest would soon cause his to yield more than others would, and thus\nthe equality be destroyed.  Again, if one couple had ten children, and\nanother had none, then again would equality be broken in upon, as the\nland that supports two in the one instance, would have to feed twelve in\nthe other.  You perceive, therefore, that without rapine or injustice\nyour equality could not be preserved.\"\n\n\"But, Jack, allowing that there might be some diversity from such\ncauses, that would be a very different thing from the present monstrous\nstate of society, in which we have kings, and lords, and people, rolling\nin wealth, while others are in a state of pauperism, and obliged to\nsteal for their daily bread.\"\n\n\"My dear father, I consider that it is to this inequality that society\nowes its firmest cementation, that we are enabled to live in peace and\nhappiness, protected by just laws, each doing his duty in that state of\nlife to which he is called, rising above or sinking in the scale of\nsociety according as he has been entrusted with the five talents or the\none.  Equality can and does exist nowhere.  We are told that it does not\nexist in heaven itself--how can it exist upon earth?\"\n\n\"But that is only asserted, Jack, and it is not proof that it ought not\nto exist.\"\n\n\"Let us argue the point, father, coolly.  Let us examine a little what\nwould be the effect if all was equality.  Were all equal in beauty,\nthere would be no beauty, for beauty is only by comparison--were all\nequal in strength, conflicts would be interminable--were all equal in\nrank, and power, and possessions, the greatest charms of existence would\nbe destroyed--generosity, gratitude, and half the finer virtues would be\nunknown.  The first principle of our religion, charity, could not be\npractised--pity would never be called forth--benevolence, your great\norgan, would be useless, and self-denial a blank letter.  Were all equal\nin ability, there would be no instruction, no talent--no genius--nothing\nto admire, nothing to copy, to respect--nothing to rouse emulation or\nstimulate to praiseworthy ambition.  Why, my dear father, what an idle,\nunprofitable, weary world would this be, if it were based on equality!\"\n\n\"But, allowing all that, Jack,\" replied Mr Easy, \"and I will say you\nargue well in a bad cause, why should the inequality be carried so far?\nking and lords, for instance.\"\n\n\"The most lasting and imperishable form of building is that of the\npyramid, which defies ages, and to that may the most perfect form of\nsociety be compared.  It is based upon the many, and rising by degrees,\nit becomes less as wealth, talent, and rank increase in the individual,\nuntil it ends at the apex, or monarch, above all.  Yet each several\nstone from the apex to the base is necessary for the preservation of the\nstructure, and fulfils its duty in its allotted place.  Could you prove\nthat those at the summit possess the greatest share of happiness in this\nworld, then, indeed, you have a position to argue on; but it is well\nknown that such is not the case; and, provided he is of a contented\nmind, the peasant is more happy than the king, surrounded as the latter\nis by cares and anxiety.\"\n\n\"Very well argued indeed, my dear sir,\" observed Dr Middleton.\n\n\"But, my dear boy, there are other states of society than monarchy; we\nhave republics and despotisms.\"\n\n\"We have, but how long do they last, compared to the first?  There is a\ncycle in the changes which never varies.  A monarchy may be overthrown\nby a revolution, and republicanism succeed, but that is shortly followed\nby despotism, till, after a time, monarchy succeeds again by unanimous\nconsent, as the most legitimate and equitable form of government; but in\nnone of these do you find a single advance to equality.  In a republic\nthose who govern are more powerful than the rulers in a restricted\nmonarchy--a president is greater than a king, and next to a despot,\nwhose will is law.  Even in small societies you find that some will\nnaturally take the lead and assume domination.  We commence the system\nat school, when we are first thrown into society, and there we are\ntaught systems of petty tyranny.  There are some few points in which we\ncan obtain equality in this world, and that equality can only be\nobtained under a well-regulated form of society, and consists in an\nequal administration of justice and of laws to which we have agreed to\nsubmit for the benefit of the whole--the equal right to live and not be\npermitted to starve, which has been obtained in this country.  And when\nwe are all called to account, we shall have equal justice.  Now, my dear\nfather, you have my opinion.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear, this is all very well in the abstract; but how does it\nwork?\"\n\n\"It works well.  The luxury, the pampered state, the idleness--if you\nplease, the wickedness of the rich, all contribute to the support, the\ncomfort, and employment of the poor.  You may behold extravagance--it is\na vice; but that very extravagance circulates money, and the vice of one\ncontributes to the happiness of many.  The only vice which is not\nredeemed by producing commensurate good, is avarice.  If all were equal\nthere would be no arts, no manufactures, no industry, no employment.  As\nit is, the inequality of the distribution of wealth may be compared to\nthe heart, pouring forth the blood like a steam-engine through the human\nframe, the same blood returning from the extremities by the veins, to be\nagain propelled, and keep up a healthy and vigorous circulation.\"\n\n\"Bravo, Jack!\" said Dr Middleton.  \"Have you anything to reply, sir?\"\ncontinued he, addressing Mr Easy.\n\n\"To reply, sir?\" replied Mr Easy with scorn, \"why, he has not given me\nhalf an argument yet--why, that black servant even laughs at him--look\nat him there, showing his teeth.  Can he forget the horrors of slavery?\ncan he forget the base unfeeling lash?--no, sir, he has suffered, and he\ncan estimate the divine right of equality.  Ask him now, ask him if you\ndare, Jack, whether he will admit the truth of your argument.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll ask him,\" replied Jack, \"and I tell you candidly that he was\nonce one of your disciples.  Mesty, what's your opinion of equality?\"\n\n\"Equality, Massa Easy?\" replied Mesty, pulling up his cravat; \"I say\ndamn equality, now I major domo.\"\n\n\"The rascal deserves to be a slave all his life.\"\n\n\"True, I ab been slave--but I a prince in my own country--Massa Easy\ntell how many skulls I have.\"\n\n\"Skulls--skulls--do you know anything of the sublime science; are you a\nphrenologist?\"\n\n\"I know man's skull very well in Ashantee country, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Then if you know that, you must be one.  I had no idea that the science\nhad extended so far--maybe it was brought from thence.  I will have some\ntalk with you to-morrow.  This is very curious, Dr Middleton, is it\nnot?\"\n\n\"Very, indeed, Mr Easy.\"\n\n\"I shall feel his head to-morrow after breakfast, and if there is\nanything wrong I shall correct it with my machine.  By-the-bye, I have\nquite forgot, gentlemen; you will excuse me, but I wish to see what the\ncarpenter has done for me, and after that I shall attend the meeting of\nthe society.  Jack, my boy, won't you come and hear my speech.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir, but I cannot well leave your friends.\"\n\nMr Easy quitted the room.\n\n\"Are you aware, my dear sir, that your father has opened his preserves\nto all the poachers?\" said Mr Hanson.\n\n\"The devil he has!\"\n\n\"Yes, he has allowed several gangs of gipsies to locate themselves in\nhis woods, much to the annoyance of the neighbourhood, who suffer from\ntheir depredations,\" continued Dr Middleton.\n\n\"I find, by the receipts and books, that there is nearly two years'\nrental of the estate due; some tenants have paid up in full, others not\nfor four years.  I reckon fourteen thousand pounds still in arrear.\"\n\n\"You will oblige me by taking immediate steps, Mr Hanson, for the\nrecovery of the sums due.\"\n\n\"Most certainly, Mr John.  I trust your father will not commit himself\nto-night as he has done lately.\"\n\nWhen they rose to retire Dr Middleton took our hero by the hand.  \"You\ndo not know, my dear fellow, what pleasure it gives me to find that, in\nspite of the doting of your mother and the madness of your father, you\nhave turned out so well.  It is very fortunate that you have come home;\nI trust you will now give up the profession.\"\n\n\"I have given it up, sir; which, by-the-bye, reminds me that I have not\napplied for either my discharge or that of my servant; but I cannot\nspare time yet, so I shall not report myself.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN.\n\nIN WHICH OUR HERO FINDS HIMSELF AN ORPHAN, AND RESOLVES TO GO TO SEA\nAGAIN, WITHOUT THE SMALLEST IDEA OF EQUALITY.\n\nThe next morning, when they met at breakfast, Mr Easy did not make his\nappearance, and Jack inquired of Mesty where he was?\n\n\"They say down below that the old gentleman not come home last night.\"\n\n\"Did not come home!\" said Dr Middleton, \"this must be looked to.\"\n\n\"He great rascal dat butler man,\" said Mesty to Jack; \"but de old\ngentleman not sleep in his bed, dat for sure.\"\n\n\"Make inquiries when he went out,\" said Jack.\n\n\"I hope no accident has happened,\" observed Mr Hanson; \"but his company\nhas lately been very strange.\"\n\n\"Nobody see him go out, sar, last night,\" reported Mesty.\n\n\"Very likely he is in his study,\" observed Dr Middleton; \"he may have\nremained all night, fast asleep, by his wonderful invention.\"\n\n\"I'll go and see,\" replied Jack.\n\nDr Middleton accompanied him, and Mesty followed.  They opened, the\ndoor, and beheld a spectacle which made them recoil with horror.  There\nwas Mr Easy, with his head in the machine, the platform below fallen\nfrom under him, hanging, with his toes just touching the ground.  Dr\nMiddleton hastened to him, and, assisted by Mesty and our hero, took him\nout of the steel collar which was round his neck; but life had been\nextinct for many hours, and, on examination, it was found that the poor\nold gentleman's neck was dislocated.\n\nIt was surmised that the accident must have taken place the evening\nbefore, and it was easy to account for it.  Mr Easy, who had had the\nmachine raised four feet higher, for the platform and steps to be placed\nunderneath, must have mounted on the frame modelled by the carpenter for\nhis work, and have fixed his head in, for the knob was pressed on his\nbump of benevolence.  The framework, hastily put together with a few\nshort nails, had given way with his weight, and the sudden fall had\ndislocated his neck.\n\nMr Hanson led away our hero, who was much shocked at this unfortunate\nand tragical end of his poor father, while Dr Middleton ordered the\nbody to be taken up into a bedroom, and immediately despatched a\nmessenger to the coroner of the county.  Poor Mr Easy had told his son\nbut the day before that he felt convinced that this wonderful invention\nwould immortalise him, and so it had, although not exactly in the sense\nthat he anticipated.\n\nWe must pass over the few days of sorrow, and closed shutters, which\nalways are given to these scenes.  The coroner's inquest and the funeral\nover, daylight was again admitted, our hero's spirits revived, and he\nfound himself in possession of a splendid property, and his own master.\n\nHe was not of age, it is true, for he wanted nine months; but on opening\nthe will of his father, he found that Dr Middleton was his sole\nguardian.  Mr Hanson, on examining and collecting the papers, which\nwere in the greatest confusion, discovered bank-notes in different\ncorners, and huddled up with bills and receipts, to the amount of two\nthousand pounds, and further, a cheque signed by Captain Wilson on his\nbanker, for the thousand pounds advanced by Mr Easy, dated more than\nfifteen months back.\n\nDr Middleton wrote to the Admiralty, informing them that family affairs\nnecessitated Mr John Easy, who had been left at sick quarters, to leave\nhis Majesty's service, requesting his discharge from it forthwith.  The\nAdmiralty was graciously pleased to grant the request, and lose the\nservices of a midshipman.  The Admiralty were also pleased to grant the\ndischarge of Mesty, on the sum required for a substitute being paid in.\n\nThe gipsies were routed out of their abodes, and sent once more to\nwander.  The gamekeepers were restored, the preserves cleared of all\npoachers, and the gentry of the county were not a little pleased at\nJack's succession, for they had wished that Mr Easy's neck had been\nbroken long ago.  The societies were dissolved, since, now that Mr Easy\npaid no longer for the beer, there was nothing to meet for.  Cards and\ncompliments were sent from all parts of the county, and every one was\nanxious that our hero should come of age, as then he would be able to\nmarry, to give dinners, subscribe to the fox-hounds, and live as a\ngentleman ought to do.\n\nBut, during all these speculations, Jack had made Dr Middleton\nacquainted with the history of his amour with Agnes de Rebiera, and all\nparticulars connected therewith, also with his determination to go out\nto bring her home as his wife.  Dr Middleton saw no objection to the\nmatch, and he perceived that our hero was sincere.  And Jack had made\ninquiries when the packet would sail for Malta, when Mesty, who stood\nbehind his chair, observed:\n\n\"Packet bad vessel, Massa Easy.  Why not go out in man-of-war?\"\n\n\"Very true,\" replied Jack; \"but you know, Mesty, that is not so easy.\"\n\n\"And den how come home, sar.  Suppose you and Missy Agnes taken\nprisoner--put in prison?\"\n\n\"Very true,\" replied Jack; \"and as for a passage home in a man-of-war\nthat will be more difficult still.\"\n\n\"Den I tink, sar, suppose you buy one fine vessel--plenty of guns--take\nout letter of marque--plenty of men, and bring Missy Agnes home like a\nlady.  You captain of your own ship.\"\n\n\"That deserves consideration, Mesty,\" replied Jack, who thought of it\nduring that night; and the next day resolved to follow Mesty's advice.\nThe Portsmouth paper lay on the breakfast-table.  Jack took it up, and\nhis eye was caught by an advertisement for the sale of the _Joan d'Arc_,\nprize to H.M. ship _Thetis_, brigantine of 278 tons, copper-bottomed,\narmed _en flute_, with all her stores, spars, sails, running and\nstanding rigging, then lying in the harbour of Portsmouth, to take place\non the following Wednesday.\n\nJack rang the bell, and ordered post-horses.\n\n\"Where are you going, my dear boy?\" inquired Dr Middleton.\n\n\"To Portsmouth, doctor.\"\n\n\"And pray what for, if not an impertinent question?\"\n\nJack then gave Dr Middleton an insight into his plan, and requested\nthat he would allow him to do so, as there was plenty of ready-money.\n\n\"But the expense will be enormous.\"\n\n\"It will be heavy, sir, I grant; but I have calculated it pretty nearly,\nand I shall not spend at the rate of more than my income.  Besides, as\nletter of marque, I shall have the right of capture; in fact, I mean to\ntake out a privateer's regular licence.\"\n\n\"But not to remain there and cruise?\"\n\n\"No, upon my honour; I am too anxious to get home again.  You must not\nrefuse me, my dear guardian.\"\n\n\"As a lady is in the case, I will not, my dear boy; but be careful what\nyou are about.\"\n\n\"Never fear, sir, I will be back in four months, at the furthest; but I\nmust now set off and ascertain if the vessel answers the description\ngiven in the advertisement.\"\n\nJack threw himself into the chariot.  Mesty mounted into the rumble, and\nin two hours they were at Portsmouth; went to the agent, viewed the\nvessel, which proved to be a very fine fast-sailing craft, well found,\nwith six brass carronades on each side.  The cabins were handsome,\nfitted up with bird's-eye maple and gilt mouldings.\n\nThis will do, thought Jack; a couple of long brass nines, forty men and\nsix boys, and she will be just the thing we require.  So Mesty and Jack\nwent on shore again, and returned to Forest Hill to dinner, when he\ndesired Mr Hanson to set off for Portsmouth, and bid at the sale for\nthe vessel, as he wished to purchase her.  This was Monday, and on\nWednesday Mr Hanson purchased her, as she stood, for 1750 pounds, which\nwas considered about half her value.\n\nDr Middleton had, in the meantime, been thinking very seriously of\nJack's project.  He could see no objection to it, provided that he was\nsteady and prudent, but in both these qualities Jack had not exactly\nbeen tried.  He therefore determined to look out for some steady naval\nlieutenant, and make it a _sine qua non_ that our hero should be\naccompanied by him, and that he should go out as sailing-master.  Now\nthat the vessel was purchased, he informed Jack of his wish; indeed, as\nDr Middleton observed, his duty as guardian demanded this precaution,\nand our hero, who felt very grateful to Dr Middleton, immediately\nacquiesced.\n\n\"And, by-the-bye, doctor, see that he is a good navigator; for although\nI can fudge a day's work pretty well, latterly I have been out of\npractice.\"\n\nEvery one was now busy.  Jack and Mesty at Portsmouth, fitting out the\nvessel, and offering three guineas a head to the crimps for every good\nable seaman--Mr Hanson obtaining the English register, and the letters\nof licence, and Dr Middleton in search of a good naval dry-nurse.  Jack\nfound time to write to Don Philip and Agnes, apprising them of the death\nof his father, and his intentions.\n\nIn about six weeks all was ready, and the brigantine, which had taken\nout her British register and licence under the name of the _Rebiera_,\nwent out of harbour, and anchored at Spithead.  Dr Middleton had\nprocured, as he thought, a very fit person to sail with Jack, and our\nhero and Mesty embarked, wishing the doctor and solicitor good-bye, and\nleaving them nothing to do but to pay the bills.\n\nThe person selected by Dr Middleton, by the advice of an old friend of\nhis, a purser in the navy who lived at Southsea, was a Lieutenant\nOxbelly, who, with the ship's company, which had been collected,\nreceived our hero as their captain and owner upon his arrival on board.\nThere certainly was no small contrast between our hero's active slight\nfigure and handsome person, set-off with a blue coat, something like the\npresent yacht-club uniform, and that of his second in command, who\nwaddled to the side to receive him.  He was a very short man, with an\nuncommon protuberance of stomach, with shoulders and arms too short for\nhis body, and hands much too large, more like the paws of a Polar bear\nthan anything else.  He wore trousers, shoes, and buckles.  On his head\nwas a foraging cap, which, when he took it off, showed that he was quite\nbald.  His age might be about fifty-five or sixty; his complexion\nflorid, no whiskers and little beard, nose straight, lips thin, teeth\nblack with chewing, and always a little brown dribble from the left\ncorner of his mouth (there was a leak there, he said).  Altogether his\ncountenance was prepossessing, for it was honest and manly, but his\nwaist was preposterous.\n\n\"Steady enough,\" thought Jack, as he returned Mr Oxbelly's salute.\n\n\"How do you do, sir?\" said Jack, \"I trust we shall be good shipmates,\"\nfor Jack had not seen him before.\n\n\"Mr Easy,\" replied the lieutenant, \"I never quarrel with any one,\nexcept (I won't tell a story) with my wife.\"\n\n\"I am sorry that you have ever domestic dissensions, Mr Oxbelly.\"\n\n\"And I only quarrel with her at night, sir.  She will take up more than\nher share of the bed, and won't allow me to sleep single; but never mind\nthat, sir; now will you please to muster the men?\"\n\n\"If you please, Mr Oxbelly.\"\n\nThe men were mustered, and Jack made them a long speech upon\nsubordination, discipline, activity, duty, and so forth.\n\n\"A very good speech, Mr Easy,\" said Mr Oxbelly, as the men went\nforward; \"I wish my wife had heard it.  But, sir, if you please, we'll\nnow get under way as fast as we can, for there is a Channel cruiser\nworking up at St. Helen's, and we may give him the go-by by running\nthrough the Needles.\"\n\n\"But what need we care for the Channel cruiser?\"\n\n\"You forget, sir, that as soon as she drops her anchor she will come on\nboard and take a fancy to at least ten of our men.\"\n\n\"But they are protected.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, but that's no protection nowadays.  I have sailed in a\nprivateer at least three years, and I know that they have no respect for\nletters of marque or for privateers.\"\n\n\"I believe you are right, Mr Oxbelly, so if you please we will up with\nthe anchor at once.\"\n\nThe crew of the _Rebiera_ had been well chosen; they were prime\nmen-of-war's men, most of whom had deserted from the various ships on\nthe station, and, of course, were most anxious to be off.  In a few\nminutes the _Rebiera_ was under way with all sail set below and aloft.\nShe was in excellent trim, and flew through the water; the wind was\nfair, and by night they had passed Portland Lights, and the next morning\nwere steering a course for the Bay of Biscay without having encountered\nwhat they feared more than an enemy--a British cruiser to overhaul them.\n\n\"I think we shall do now, sir,\" observed Mr Oxbelly to our hero; \"we\nhave made a famous run.  It's twelve o'clock, and if you please I'll\nwork the latitude and let you know what it is.  We must shape our course\nso as not to run in with the Brest squadron.  A little more westing,\nsir.  I'll be up in one minute.  My wife--but I'll tell you about that\nwhen I come up.\n\n\"Latitude 41 degrees 12 minutes, sir.  I was about to say that my wife,\nwhen she was on board of the privateer that I commanded--\"\n\n\"Board of the privateer, Mr Oxbelly?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, would go; told her it was impossible, but she wouldn't listen\nto reason--came on board, flopped herself into the standing bed-place,\nand said that there she was for the cruise--little Billy with her--\"\n\n\"What! your child, too?\"\n\n\"Yes, two years old--fine boy--always laughed when the guns were fired,\nwhile his mother stood on the ladder and held him on the top of the\nbooby-hatch.\"\n\n\"I wonder that Mrs Oxbelly let you come here now?\"\n\n\"So you would, sir, but I'll explain that--she thinks I'm in London\nabout my half-pay.  She knows all by this time, and frets, I don't\ndoubt; but that will make her thin, and then there will be more room in\nthe bed.  Mrs Oxbelly is a very stout woman.\"\n\n\"Why you are not a little man!\"\n\n\"No, not little--tending to be lusty, as the saying is--that is, in good\ncondition.  It's very strange that Mrs Oxbelly has an idea that she is\nnot large.  I cannot persuade her to it.  That's the reason we always\nspar in bed.  She says it is I, and I know that it is she, who takes the\nlargest share of it.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you may both be right.\"\n\n\"No, no, it is she who creates all the disturbance.  If I get nearer to\nthe wall she jams me up till I am as thin as a thread-paper.  If I put\nher inside and stay outside, she cuts me out as you do a cask, by the\nchine, till I tumble out of bed.\"\n\n\"Why don't you make your bed larger, Mr Oxbelly?\"\n\n\"Sir, I have proposed, but my wife will have it that the bed is large\nenough if I would not toss in my sleep.  I can't convince her.  However,\nshe'll have it all to herself now.  I slept well last night, for the\nfirst time since I left the _Boadicea_.\"\n\n\"The _Boadicea_?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I was second lieutenant of the _Boadicea_ for three years.\"\n\n\"She's a fine frigate, I'm told.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, such a pinched-up little craft below I never saw.\nWhy, Mr Easy, I could hardly get into the door of my cabin--and yet, as\nyou must see, I'm not a large man.\"\n\n\"Good heavens! is it possible,\" thought Jack, \"that this man does not\nreally know that he is monstrous?\"\n\nYet such was the case.  Mr Oxbelly had no idea that he was otherwise\nthan in good condition, although he had probably not seen his knees for\nyears.  It was his obesity that was the great objection to him, for in\nevery other point there was nothing against him.  He had, upon one\npretence and another, been shifted, by the manoeuvres of the captains,\nout of different ships, until he went up to the Admiralty to know if\nthere was any charge against him.  The First Lord at once perceived the\ncharge to be preferred, and made a mark against his name as not fit for\nanything but harbour duty.  Out of employment, he had taken the command\nof a privateer cutter, when his wife who was excessively fond, would, as\nhe said, follow him with little Billy.  He was sober, steady, knew his\nduty well; but he weighed twenty-six stone, and his weight had swamped\nhim in the service.\n\nHis wish, long indulged, had become, as Shakespeare says, the father of\nhis thought, and he had really at last brought himself to think that he\nwas not by any means what could be considered a fat man.  His wife, as\nhe said, was also a very stout woman, and this exuberance of flesh on\nboth sides, was the only, but continual, ground of dispute.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT.\n\nIN WHICH OUR HERO, AS USUAL, GETS INTO THE VERY MIDDLE OF IT.\n\nOn the eleventh day the Rebiera entered the Straits, and the Rock of\nGibraltar was in sight as the sun went down; after which the wind fell\nlight, and about midnight it became calm, and they drifted up.  At\nsunrise they were roused by the report of heavy guns, and perceived an\nEnglish frigate about eight miles farther up the Straits, and more in\nthe mid-channel, engaging nine or ten Spanish gunboats, which had come\nout from Algesiras to attack her.  It still continued a dead calm, and\nthe boats of the frigate were all ahead towing her, so as to bring her\nbroadside to bear upon the Spanish flotilla.  The reverberating of the\nheavy cannon on both sides over the placid surface of the water--the\nwhite smoke ascending as the sun rose in brilliancy in a clear blue\nsky--the distant echoes repeated from the high hills--had a very\nbeautiful effect for those who are partial to the picturesque.  But Jack\nthought it advisable to prepare for action instead of watching for\ntints--and in a short time all was ready.\n\n\"They'll not come to us, Mr Easy, as long as they have the frigate to\nhammer at; but still we had better be prepared, for we cannot well pass\nthem without having a few shot.  When I came up the Straits in the\nprivateer we were attacked by two, and fought them for three hours;\ntheir shot dashed the water over our decks till they were wet fore and\naft, but somehow or another they never hit us--we were as low as they\nwere.  I'll be bound but they'll hull the frigate though.  Mrs Oxbelly\nand Billy were on deck the whole time--and Billy was quite delighted,\nand cried when they took him down to breakfast.\"\n\n\"Why, Mrs Oxbelly must be very courageous.\"\n\n\"Cares neither for shot nor shell, sir, laughs when they whiz over her\nhead, and tells Billy to hark.  But, sir, it's not surprising; her\nfather is a major, and her two brothers are lieutenants in the\nbombardiers.\"\n\n\"That, indeed,\" replied Jack--\"but see, there is a breeze springing up\nfrom the westward.\"\n\n\"Very true, Mr Easy, and a steady one it will be, for it comes up dark\nand slow; so much the better for the frigate, for she'll get little\nhonour and plenty of mauling at this work.\"\n\n\"I hope we shall take it up with us,\" observed Jack; \"how far do you\nreckon the gun-boats from the shore?\"\n\n\"I should think about five miles, or rather less.\"\n\n\"Trim sails, Mr Oxbelly--perhaps we may cut one or two of these off--\nsteer inshore of them.\"\n\n\"Exactly.  Up there, my lads, set top-gallant studding sails, top-mast\nstuddings to hand-rig out the booms--keep as you go now, my lad--we\nshall be well inshore of them, and out of the range of the batteries.\"\n\nThe breeze came down fresh, and all sail was set upon the _Rebiera_.\nShe took the wind down with her, and it passed her but little--half a\nmile ahead of them all was still and smooth as a glass mirror, and they\nneared and gained inshore at the same time.  The gun-boats were still\nengaging the frigate, and did not appear to pay any attention to the\n_Rebiera_ coming down.  At last the breeze reached them and the frigate,\nlight at first and then gradually increasing, while the _Rebiera_ foamed\nthrough the water and had now every chance of cutting off some of the\ngun-boats.  The frigate trimmed her sails and steered towards the\nflotilla, which now thought proper to haul off and put their heads\ninshore, followed by the frigate firing her bow-chasers.  But the\n_Rebiera_ was now within half gun-shot, inshore, and steering so as to\nintercept them.  As she rapidly closed, the flotilla scarcely knew how\nto act; to attack her would be to lose time, and allow the frigate to\ncome up and occasion their own capture; so they satisfied themselves\nwith firing at her as she continued to run down between them and the\nland.  As they neared, Jack opened his fire with his eighteen-pound\ncarronades and long nines.  The gun-boats returned his fire, and they\nwere within a quarter of a mile, when Jack shortened sail to his\ntop-sails, and a warm engagement took place, which ended in one of the\ngun-boats being in a few minutes dismasted.  The frigate, under all\ncanvas, came rapidly up, and her shot now fell thick.  The flotilla then\nceased firing, passing about two cables' lengths ahead of the _Rebiera_,\nand making all possible sail for the land.  Jack now fired at the\nflotilla as they passed, with his larboard broadside, while with his\nstarboard he poured in grape and canister upon the unfortunate gun-boat\nwhich was dismasted, and which soon hauled down her colours.  In a few\nminutes more the remainder were too far distant for the carronades, and,\nas they did not fire, Jack turned his attention to take possession of\nhis prize, sending a boat with ten men on board, and heaving-to close to\nher to take her in tow.  Ten minutes more and the frigate was hove-to a\ncable's length from the _Rebiera_, and our hero lowered down his other\nquarter boat to go on board.\n\n\"Have we any men hurt, Mr Oxbelly?\" inquired Jack.\n\n\"Only two; Spearling has lost his thumb with a piece of langrage, and\nJames has a bad wound in the thigh.\"\n\n\"Very well; I will ask for the surgeon to come on board.\"\n\nJack pulled to the frigate and went up the side, touched his hat in due\nform, and was introduced by the midshipmen to the other side, where the\ncaptain stood.\n\n\"Mr Easy!\" exclaimed the captain.\n\n\"Captain Sawbridge?\" replied our hero with surprise.\n\n\"Good heavens! what brought you here!\" said the captain; \"and what\nvessel is that?\"\n\n\"The _Rebiera_, letter of marque, commanded and owned by Mr Easy,\"\nreplied Jack, laughing.\n\nCaptain Sawbridge gave him his hand.  \"Come down with me in the cabin,\nMr Easy; I am very glad to see you.  Give you great credit for your\nconduct, and am still more anxious to know what has induced you to come\nout again.  I knew that you had left the service.\"\n\nJack, in a very few words, told his object in fitting out the _Rebiera_;\n\"but,\" continued Jack, \"allow me to congratulate you upon your\npromotion, which I was not aware of.  May I ask where you left the\n_Harpy_, and what is the name of your frigate?\"\n\n\"The _Latona_!  I have only been appointed to her one month, after an\naction in which the _Harpy_ took a large corvette, and am ordered home\nwith despatches to England.  We sailed yesterday evening from Gibraltar,\nwere becalmed the whole night, and attacked this morning by the\ngun-boats.\"\n\n\"How is Captain Wilson, sir?\"\n\n\"I believe he is very well, but I have not seen him.\"\n\n\"How did you know, then, that I had left the service, Captain\nSawbridge?\"\n\n\"From Mr Gascoigne, who is now on board.\"\n\n\"Gascoigne!\" exclaimed our hero.\n\n\"Yes, he was sent up to join the _Aurora_ by the Governor, but she had\nleft the fleet, and having served his time, and a passing day being\nordered, he passed, and thought he might as well go home with me and see\nif he could make any interest for his promotion.\"\n\n\"Pray, Captain Sawbridge, is the gun-boat our prize or yours?\"\n\n\"It ought to be wholly yours; but the fact is, by the regulations, we\nshare.\"\n\n\"With all my heart, sir.  Will you send an assistant-surgeon on board to\nlook after two of my men who are hurt?\"\n\n\"Yes, directly; now send your boat away, Easy, with directions to your\nofficer in command.  We must go back to Gibraltar, for we have received\nsome injury, and, I am sorry to say, lost some men.  You are going then,\nI presume, to stay on board and dine with me: we shall be at anchor\nbefore night.\"\n\n\"I will, with pleasure, sir.  But now I will send my boat away and shake\nhands with Gascoigne.\"\n\nGascoigne was under the half-deck waiting to receive his friend, for he\nhad seen him come up the side from his station on the forecastle.  A\nhurried conversation took place, after our hero had dismissed his boat\nwith the assistant-surgeon in it to dress the two wounded men.  Jack\nthen went on deck, talked with the officers, looked with pleasure at the\n_Rebiera_ with the gun-boat in tow, keeping company with the frigate,\nalthough only under the same canvas--promised Gascoigne to spend the\nnext day with him either on shore or on board of the _Rebiera_, and then\nreturned to the cabin, where he had a long conference with Captain\nSawbridge.\n\n\"When you first entered the service, Easy,\" said Captain Sawbridge, \"I\nthought that the sooner the service was rid of you the better; now that\nyou have left it, I feel that it has lost one, who, in all probability,\nwould have proved a credit to it.\"\n\n\"Many thanks, sir,\" replied Jack; \"but how can I be a midshipman with\neight thousand pounds a year?\"\n\n\"I agree with you that it is impossible:--but dinner is serving; go into\nthe after-cabin and the steward will give you all you require.\"\n\nOur hero, whose face and hands were not a little grimed with the\ngunpowder, washed himself, combed out his curly black hair, and found\nall the party in the fore-cabin.  Gascoigne, who had not been asked in\nthe forenoon, was, by the consideration of Captain Sawbridge, added to\nthe number.  Before dinner was long off the table, the first lieutenant\nreported that it was necessary to turn the hands up, as they were close\nto the anchorage.  The party, therefore, broke up sooner than otherwise\nwould have been the case; and as soon as the _Latona's_ sails were\nfurled Captain Sawbridge went on shore to acquaint the Governor with the\nresults of the action.  He asked Jack to accompany him, but our hero,\nwishing to be with Gascoigne, excused himself until the next day.\n\n\"And now, Easy,\" said Gascoigne, as soon as the captain had gone over\nthe side, \"I will ask permission to go on board with you--or will you\nask?\"\n\n\"I will ask,\" replied Jack; \"a gentleman of fortune has more weight with\na first lieutenant than a midshipman.\"\n\nSo Jack went up to the first lieutenant, and with one of his polite bows\nhoped, \"if duty would permit, he would honour him by coming on board\nthat evening with some of his officers, to see the _Rebiera_ and to\ndrink a bottle or two of champagne.\"\n\nThe first lieutenant, as the _Rebiera_ was anchored not two cables'\nlengths from him, replied, \"that as soon as he had shifted the prisoners\nand secured the gun-boat, he would be very glad;\" so did three or four\nmore of the officers, and then Jack begged as a favour that his old\nfriend, Mr Gascoigne, might be permitted to go with him now, as he had\nimportant packages to entrust to his care to England.  The first\nlieutenant was very willing, and Gascoigne and our hero jumped into the\nboat, and were once more in all the confidence of tried and deserved\nfriendship.\n\n\"Jack, I've been thinking of it, and I've made up my mind,\" said\nGascoigne.  \"I shall gain little or nothing by going home for my\npromotion: I may as well stay here, and as I have served my time and\npassed, my pay is now of little consequence.  Will you take me with\nyou?\"\n\n\"It is exactly what I was thinking of, Ned.  Do you think that Captain\nSawbridge will consent?\"\n\n\"I do; he knows how I am circumstanced, and that my going home was\nmerely because I was tired of looking after the _Aurora_.\"\n\n\"We'll go together and ask him to-morrow,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"At all events, you'll have a more gentlemanly companion than Mr\nOxbelly.\"\n\n\"But not so steady, Ned.\"\n\nThe first lieutenant and officers came on board, and passed a merry\nevening.  There's nothing passes time more agreeably away than\nchampagne, and if you do not affront this regal wine by mixing him with\nany other, he never punishes you next morning.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY NINE.\n\nA COUNCIL OF WAR, IN WHICH JACK DECIDES THAT HE WILL HAVE ONE MORE\nCRUISE.\n\nAs Captain Sawbridge did not return on board that evening, Easy went on\nshore and called upon him at the Governor's, to whom he was introduced,\nand received an invitation to dine with him.  As Gascoigne could not\ncome on shore, our hero took this opportunity of making his request to\nCaptain Sawbridge, stating that the person he had with him was not such\nas he wished and could confide everything to; that is, not one to whom\nhe could talk to about Agnes.  Jack, as he found that Captain Sawbridge\ndid not immediately assent, pressed the matter hard; at last Captain\nSawbridge, who reflected that Gascoigne's interest hereafter would be\nmuch greater through his friend Easy than any other quarter, and that\nthe more the friendship was cemented the more advantageous it might\nprove to Gascoigne, gave his consent to our hero's wish, who called on\nboard the _Latona_ to acquaint Gascoigne and the first lieutenant of\nCaptain Sawbridge's intentions, and then went on board of _Rebiera_ and\nordered Mesty to come with his portmanteau on shore to the inn, that he\nmight dress for dinner.  Gascoigne, now considered as not belonging to\nthe _Latona_, was permitted to accompany him; and Jack found himself\nlooking out of the window at which he had hung out his trousers upon the\nmemorable occasion when the boatswain had to follow his own precept, of\nduty before decency.\n\n\"What scenes of adventure I have passed through since that,\" thought\nJack; \"not much more than four years ago, then not three weeks in the\nservice.\"  Whereupon Jack fell into a deep reverie, and thought of the\nbaboon and of Agnes.\n\nThe repairs of the _Latona_ were all made good by the next day, and\nGascoigne, having received his discharge-ticket, went on board the\n_Rebiera_.  The gun-boat was put into the hands of the agent, and\nshortly afterwards purchased by Government.  The _Rebiera's_ crew did\nnot, however, obtain their prize-money and share of the head-money, for\nshe had seventy men on board, until their return, but, as they did, they\nhad broken the ice, and that was everything.  Moreover, it gave them\nconfidence in themselves, in their vessel, and in their commander.  Our\nhero weighed a short time after the _Latona_, having first taken leave\nof Captain Sawbridge, and committed to his care a letter to Dr\nMiddleton.\n\nOnce more behold the trio together--the two midshipmen hanging over the\ntaffrail, and Mesty standing by them.  They had rounded Europa Point,\nand with a fine breeze off the land, were lying close-hauled along the\nSpanish shore.  Mr Oxbelly was also walking near them.\n\n\"When I was cruising here it was very different,\" observed Jack; \"I had\na vessel which I did not know how to manage, a crew which I could not\ncommand, and had it not been for Mesty, what would have become of me?\"\n\n\"Massa Easy, you know very well how to get out of scrapes, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Yes, and how to get into them,\" continued Gascoigne.\n\n\"And how to get others out of them, too, Ned.\"\n\n\"`No more of that Hal, an thou lovest me,'\" quoted Gascoigne.  \"I have\noften wondered what has been the lot of poor Azar.\"\n\n\"The lot of most women, Ned, in every country--prized at first,\nneglected afterwards--the lot she might have had with you.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so,\" replied Ned, with a sigh.\n\n\"Massa Easy, you get eberybody out of scrape; you get me out of scrape.\"\n\n\"I do not recollect how, Mesty.\"\n\n\"You get me out from boil kettle for young gentlemen--dat devil of\nscrape.\"\n\n\"And I'm sure I've got you out of a scrape, Mr Oxbelly.\"\n\n\"How so, Mr Easy?\"\n\n\"How so!--have I not prevented your quarrelling with your wife every\nnight?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir, you have been the means.  But, do you know, when we\nwere engaging the other day, I could not help saying to myself, `I wish\nmy wife was here now, holding little Billy at the hatchway.'\"\n\n\"But at night, Mr Oxbelly.\"\n\n\"At night!--why, then I'm afraid I should have wished her home again--\nit's astonishing how comfortable I sleep now every night.  Besides, in\nthis climate it would be intolerable.  Mrs Oxbelly is a very large\nwoman--very large indeed.\"\n\n\"Well, but now we must hold a council of war.  Are we to run up the\ncoast, or to shape our course direct for Palermo?\"\n\n\"Course direct, and we shall take nothing, that is certain,\" said\nGascoigne.\n\n\"If we take nothing we shall make no prize-money,\" continued Oxbelly.\n\n\"If we make no prize-money the men will be discontented,\" said Easy.\n\n\"If no ab noting to do--it will be damned 'tupid,\" continued Mesty.\n\n\"Now then the other side of the question.  If we steer for Palermo, we\nshall be sooner there and sooner home.\"\n\n\"To which I reply,\" said Gascoigne, \"that the shorter the cruise is, the\nless I shall have of your company.\"\n\n\"And I shall have to sleep with Mrs Oxbelly,\" continued Oxbelly.\n\n\"Hab fine ship, fine gun, fine men, and do noting,\" cried Mesty.  \"By de\npower, I no like dat, Massa Easy.\"\n\n\"You want eight months of coming of age, Jack,\" observed Gascoigne.\n\n\"It won't make a difference of more than three or four weeks,\" said Mr\nOxbelly; \"and the expenses have been very great.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"But what, Jack?\"\n\n\"Agnes.\"\n\n\"Agnes will be better defended going home by men who have been\naccustomed to be in action.  And, as for her waiting a little longer, it\nwill only make her love you a little more.\"\n\n\"Sleep single a little longer, Mr Easy, it's very pleasant,\" said Mr\nOxbelly.\n\n\"That's not very bad advice of yours,\" observed Gascoigne.\n\n\"_Stop a little_, Massa Easy,\" said Mesty, \"you know dat very good\nadvice.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" replied Jack, \"I will, as I am quite in the minority.  We\nwill work up the whole coast--up to Toulon.  After all, there's\nsomething very pleasant in commanding your own ship, and I'm not in a\nhurry to resign it--so that point's decided.\"\n\nThe _Rebiera_ was steered in to the land, and at sunset they were not\nfour miles from the lofty blue mountains which overhang the town of\nMalaga.  There were many vessels lying at the bottom of the bay, close\nin with the town; the wind now fell light, and the _Rebiera_, as she\ncould not fetch the town, tacked as if she were a merchant vessel\nstanding in, and showed American colours, a hint which they took from\nperceiving three or four large vessels lying in the outer roads, with\nthe colours of that nation hoisted at the peak.\n\n\"What is your intention, Jack?\" said Gascoigne.\n\n\"I'll be hanged if I know yet.  I think of working up to the outer\nroads, and anchoring at night--boarding the American vessels, and\ngaining intelligence.\"\n\n\"Not a bad idea; we shall then learn if there is anything to be done,\nand if not, we may be off at daylight.\"\n\n\"The pratique boat will not come off after sunset.\"\n\n\"And if they did, we could pass for an American, bound to Barcelona or\nanywhere else--the outer roads where the vessels lie are hardly within\ngun-shot.\"\n\nMesty, who had resumed his sailor's clothes, now observed, \"What we do,\nMassa Easy, we do quickly--time for all ting, time for show face and\nfight--time for hide face, crawl, and steal.\"\n\n\"Very true, Mesty, we'll crawl this time, and steal if we can.  It's not\nthe warfare I like best of the two.\"\n\n\"Both good, Massa Easy; suppose you no steal board of polacca ship, you\nnot see Missy Agnes.\"\n\n\"Very true, Mesty.  'Bout ship, Mr Oxbelly.\"\n\n\"Mr Oxbelly not good for boat sarvice,\" observed Mesty, showing his\nteeth.\n\nIt was dark before the _Rebiera_ was anchored in the outer roads, a\ncable's length astern of the outermost American vessel.  One of her\nquarter-boats was lowered down, and Gascoigne and our hero pulled\nalongside, and, lying on their oars, hailed, and asked the name of the\nvessel.\n\n\"So help me Gad, just now I forget her name,\" replied a negro, looking\nover the gangway.\n\n\"Who's the captain?\"\n\n\"So help me Gad, he gone on shore.\"\n\n\"Is the mate on board?\"\n\n\"No, so help me Gad--he gone shore too.\"\n\n\"Who is aboard then?\"\n\n\"So help me Gad, nobody on board but Pompey--and dat me.\"\n\n\"Good ship-keepers, at all events,\" said Jack.  \"A ship in the outer\nroads with only a black fellow on board!  I say, Pompey, do they always\nleave you in charge of the vessel?\"\n\n\"No, sar; but to-night great pleasure on shore.  Eberybody dance and\nsing, get drunk, kick up bobbery, and all dat.\"\n\n\"What, is it a festival?\"\n\n\"So help me Gad, I no know, sar.\"\n\n\"Is there any one on board of the other vessels?\"\n\n\"Eberybody gone on shore.  Suppose they have black man, he stay on\nboard.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Pompey.\"\n\n\"Good-night, sar.  Who I say call when captain come on board?\"\n\n\"Captain Easy.\"\n\n\"Captain He-see, very well, sar.\"\n\nOur hero pulled to another ship, and found it equally deserted; but at\nthe third he found the second mate, with his arm in a sling, and from\nhim they gained the information that it was a great festival, being the\nlast day of the carnival; and that every one was thinking of nothing but\namusement.\n\n\"I've a notion,\" said the mate, in reply, \"that you're American.\"\n\n\"You've guessed right,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"What ship, and from what port?\"\n\n\"Rhode Island, the _Susan and Mary_,\" replied Gascoigne.\n\n\"I thought you were north.  We're of New York.  What news do you bring?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" replied he, \"we are from Liverpool last.\"\n\nA succession of questions was now put by the American mate, and answered\nvery skilfully by Gascoigne, who then inquired how the market was?\n\nIt was necessary to make and reply to all these inquiries before they\ncould ask apparently indifferent questions of American traders; at last\nGascoigne inquired:\n\n\"Do you think they would allow us to go on shore? the pratique boat has\nnot been on board.\"\n\n\"They'll never find you out if you are off before daylight; I doubt if\nthey know that you are anchored.  Besides, from Liverpool you would have\na clean bill of health, and if they found it out, they would not say\nmuch; they're not over-particular, I've a notion.\"\n\n\"What are those vessels lying inshore?\"\n\n\"I guess, they have olive oil on board, the chief on 'em.  But there are\ntwo double lateens come in from Valparaiso the day before yesterday,\nwith hides and copper.  How they 'scaped the British, I can't tell, but\nthey did, that's sure enough.\"\n\n\"Good-night, then.\"\n\n\"You won't take a glass of sling this fine night, with a countryman?\"\n\n\"To-morrow, my good fellow, to-morrow; we must go on shore now.\"\n\nOur hero and Gascoigne returned on board the _Rebiera_, consulted with\nOxbelly and Mesty, and then manned and armed the two quarter and stern\nboats.  They thought it advisable not to hoist out their long-boat; no\nfire-arms were permitted to be taken lest, going off by accident or\notherwise, an alarm should be given.  Our hero and Mesty proceeded in\nthe first boat, and pulled in for the town; Gascoigne shortly after in\nthe second, and the boatswain, in the jolly-boat, followed at some\ndistance.\n\nThere was no notice taken of them; they pulled gently down to the\nlanding-place, which was deserted.  There was a blaze of light, and the\nsounds of revelry in every quarter on shore; but the vessels appeared\nequally deserted as the American ones in the offing.\n\nFinding themselves unobserved, for they had taken the precaution to pull\nonly two oars in each boat, they dropped gently alongside one of the\ndouble-masted lateen vessels, and Mesty stepped on board.  He peeped\ndown in the cabin, and perceived a man lying on the lockers; he came up\nin his stealthy manner, closed the hatch softly, and said, \"all right.\"\nJack left Gascoigne to take out this vessel, which he did very\nsuccessfully, for it was very dark; and although there were sentries\nposted not far off, their eyes and ears were turned towards the town,\nlistening to the music.\n\nA second vessel, her consort, was boarded in the same way, but here they\nfound a man on deck, whom they were obliged to seize and gag.  They put\nhim down in the cabin, and Mesty, with another boat's crew, cut her\ncables and swept her gently out towards the American vessels.  One more\nvessel was required, and Jack, pulling two oars as usual, saluted a\ngalliot heavily laden, but of what her cargo consisted was not known.\nIn this vessel they found two men in the cabin playing cards, whom they\nseized and bound, and cutting her cables were obliged to make sail upon\nher, as she was much too large to sweep out.  As they were making sail\nthey, however, met with an interruption which they did not expect.  The\ncrew belonging to the vessel, having had enough amusement for the\nevening, and intending to sail the next morning, had thought it right to\ncome off sooner than the others: it was then about midnight or a little\nlater, and while some of Jack's men were aloft, for he had six with him,\nJack, to his annoyance, heard a boat coming off from the shore, the men\nin her singing a chorus.  The galliot was at that time just under\nsteerage way, her topsail had been loosed and her jib hoisted, but the\nformer had not been sheeted home, for the three men below could not, in\nthe dark, find the ropes.  The other three men were on the foreyard\nloosing the foresail, and Jack was undetermined whether to call them\ndown immediately or to allow them to loose the sail, and thus get good\nway on the vessel, so as to prevent the boat, which was loaded with men,\nfrom overtaking them.  The boat was not more than twenty yards from the\ngalliot, when, not finding her where they left her, they pulled to the\nright and lay on their oars.  This gave a moment of time, but they very\nsoon spied her out.  \"Carambo!\" was the exclamation--and the head of the\nboat was pulled round.\n\n\"Down, my lads, in a moment by the swifters,\" cried Jack.  \"Here's a\nboat on board of us.\"\n\nThe men were in a few seconds on deck, and the others, who had now\nsheeted home the topsails, hastened aft.  The vessel soon gathered way,\nbut before that her way was sufficient, the boat had pulled under the\ncounter, and the Spaniards, letting their oars swing fore and aft, were\nclimbing up, their knives in their teeth.  A scuffle ensued, and they\nwere thrown down again, but they renewed their attempt.  Our hero,\nperceiving a small water or wine cask lashed to the gunwale, cut it\nloose with his cutlass, and, with one of the men who was by his side,\npushed it over, and dropped it into the boat.  It struck the gunwale,\nstove a plank, and the boat began to fill rapidly; in the meantime the\ngalliot had gained way--the boat could not longer be held on, from its\nweight, and dropped astern with the men in it.  Those who were half in\nand half out were left clinging to the gunwale of the vessel, and as\nthey climbed up were secured and put down in the cabin.  Fortunately, no\nfire-arms having been used on either side, the alarm was not given\ngenerally, but the sentry reported fighting on board one of the vessels,\nand the people of the guard-boat were collected, and pulled out; but\nthey only arrived in time to see that the galliot was under way, and\nthat the two other vessels from Valparaiso were not in their berths.\n\nThey hastened on shore, gave the alarm; the gunboats, of which there\nwere three at the mole, were ordered out, but half the crew and all the\nofficers were on shore, some at balls, others drinking at taverns or\nposadas; before they could be collected all three vessels were alongside\nof the _Rebiera_; and not aware that anything had been discovered, our\nhero and his crew were lulled in security.  Jack had gone on board,\nleaving fourteen of his men on board the galliot--Gascoigne had done the\nsame--Mesty still remained on board his vessel; and they were\ncongratulating themselves, and ordering the men on board to the\nwindlass, when they heard the sound of oars.\n\n\"Silence!--what is that?\" exclaimed Oxbelly.  \"The gun-boats or\nrow-boats, as sure as I'm alive!\"\n\nAt this moment Mesty jumped up the side.\n\n\"Massa Easy, I hear row-boat not far off.\"\n\n\"So do we, Mesty.  Gascoigne, jump into the boat--tell the men in the\nprizes to make all sail right out, and leave us to defend their\nretreat--stay on board of one and divide your men.\"\n\n\"Dat all right, Massa Easy.--Mr Gascoigne, be smart--and now, sar, cut\ncable and make sail; no time get up anchor.\"\n\nThis order was given, but although the men were aloft in a moment, and\nvery expeditious, as the _Rebiera_ payed her head round and the jib was\nhoisted, they could perceive the boom of the three gun-boats pulling and\nsailing not five cables' length from them.  Although rather\nshort-handed, topsails, courses, and top-gallant sails were soon set,\nthe men down to their quarters, and the guns cast loose, before the\ngun-boats were close under their stern.  Then Jack rounded to, braced\nup, and the _Rebiera_ stood across them to the westward.\n\n\"Why the devil don't they fire?\" said Jack.\n\n\"I tink because they no ab powder,\" said Mesty.\n\nMesty was right--the ammunition chests of the gun-boats were always\nlanded when they were at the mole, in case of accidents, which might\narise from the crew being continually with cigars in their mouths, and\nin the hurry they had quite forgotten to put them on board.\n\n\"At all events, we have powder,\" said Jack, \"and now we'll prove it.\nGrape and canister, my lads, and take good aim.\"\n\nThe commanders of the gun-boats had hailed each other, and agreed to\nboard the _Rebiera_, but she now had good way on her, and sailed faster\nthan they pulled.  A well-directed broadside astonished them--they had\nno idea of her force; and the execution done was so great, that they\nfirst lay on their oars and then pulled back to the mole with all speed,\nleaving the _Rebiera_ in quiet possession of her prizes, which had\nalready gained two miles in the offing.\n\nThe _Rebiera_, as soon as Jack perceived that the gun-boats had\nretreated, was put before the wind, and soon closed with her captures,\nwhen she was hove-to till daylight with the three vessels in company.\nGascoigne returned on board, prize-masters were selected, and Jack\ndetermined to keep them all with him, and take them to Palermo.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FORTY.\n\nIN WHICH THERE IS ANOTHER SLIGHT DIFFERENCE OF OPINION BETWEEN THOSE WHO\nSHOULD BE FRIENDS.\n\nThe two lateen vessels proved of considerable value, being laden with\ncopper, hides, and cochineal.  The galliot was laden with sweet oil, and\nwas also no despicable prize.  At daylight they were all ready, and, to\nthe mortification of the good people of Malaga, sailed away to the\neastward without interruption.\n\n\"Me tink we do dat job pretty well, Massa Easy,\" observed Mesty, as he\nlaid the breakfast table.\n\n\"Nothing like trying,\" replied Gascoigne; \"I'm sure when we stood into\nthe bay I would have sold all my prize-money for a doubloon.  How do I\nshare, Jack?\"\n\n\"Only as one of the crew, Ned, for you are a supernumerary, and our\narticles and agreement for prize-money were signed previous to our\nsailing.\"\n\n\"I ought to share with Mr Oxbelly's class by rights,\" replied\nGascoigne.  \"That would be to take half my prize-money away.  I shall\nwant it all, Mr Gascoigne, to pacify my wife for giving her the slip.\"\n\n\"Ah, very well; I'll get all I can.\"\n\nFor ten days they ran down the coast, going much too fast for the wishes\nof the crew, who were anxious to make more money.  They seized a fishing\nboat and put on board of her the four prisoners, whom they had found in\nthe vessels, and arrived off Barcelona, without falling in with friend\nor foe.  The next morning, the wind being very light, they discovered a\nlarge vessel at daylight astern of them to the westward, and soon made\nher out to be a frigate.  She made all sail in chase, but that gave them\nvery little uneasiness, as they felt assured that she was a British\ncruiser.  One fear, however, came over them, that she would, if she came\nup with them, impress a portion of their men.\n\n\"As certainly as I'm here, and Mrs Oxbelly's at Southsea,\" said\nOxbelly, \"they'll take some of the men--the more so as, supposing us to\nbe a Spanish convoy, they will be disappointed.\"\n\n\"They will hardly take them out of the prizes,\" observed Easy.\n\n\"I don't know that; men must be had for his Majesty's service somehow.\nIt's not their fault, Mr Easy--the navy must be manned, and as things\nare so, so things must be.  It's the king's prerogative, Mr Easy, and\nwe cannot fight the battles of the country without it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Gascoigne, \"and although, as soon as the services of\nseamen are no longer wanted, you find that there are demagogues on shore\nwho exclaim against impressment, they are quiet enough on the point when\nthey know that their lives and property depend upon sailors' exertions.\"\n\n\"Very true, Mr Gascoigne, but it's not our fault if we are obliged to\ntake men by force; it's the fault of those who do not legislate so as to\nprevent the necessity.  Mrs Oxbelly used to say that she would easily\nmanage the matter if she were Chancellor of the Exchequer.\"\n\n\"I dare say Mrs Oxbelly would make a very good Chancellor of the\nExchequer,\" replied Gascoigne, smiling; \"one thing is certain, that if\nthey gave the subject half the consideration they have others of less\nmagnitude, an arrangement might be made by which his Majesty's navy\nwould never be short of men.\"\n\n\"No doubt, no doubt, Mr Gascoigne; but nevertheless, the king's\nprerogative must never be given up.\"\n\n\"Then I agree with you, Mr Oxbelly; it _must be held_ in case of sudden\nemergency and absolute need.\"\n\n\"We'll argue that point by-and-bye,\" replied Jack; \"now let us consult\nas to our measures.  My opinion is, that if I made more sail we should\nbeat the frigate, but she would come up with the prizes.\"\n\n\"That's the best thing we can do, Mr Easy; but let us send a boat on\nboard of them, and take out all the men that can possibly be spared,\nthat there may be no excuse for impressing them.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Gascoigne; \"and as the wind is falling it is possible it\nmay fall calm, and they may send their boats; suppose we separate a mile\nor two from each other.\"\n\n\"Dat very good advice, Massa Gascoigne,\" observed Mesty.\n\nThis plan was acted upon; only three men were left in the lateens, and\nfour in the galliot, and the vessels, in obedience to the orders,\nsheered off on both sides of the _Rebiera_, who made all sail and\nstarted ahead of the prizes.  This manoeuvre was perceived on board of\nthe frigate, and made them sure that it was a Spanish convoy attempting\nto escape.  The fire-engine was got on deck, sails wetted, and every\nexertion made to come up.  But about four o'clock in the afternoon, when\nthe frigate was eight or nine miles off, it fell calm, as Gascoigne had\npredicted, and the heads of all the vessels, as well as the frigate,\nwere now round the compass.\n\n\"There's out boats,\" said Mr Oxbelly; \"they will have a long pull, and\nall for nothing.\"\n\n\"How savage they will be!\" observed Gascoigne.\n\n\"Never mind that,\" replied Jack; \"Mesty says that dinner is ready.\"\n\nAfter dinner, they all went on deck, and found that the boats had\nseparated, one pulling for each of the prizes, and two for the\n_Rebiera_.  In less than an hour they would probably be alongside.\n\n\"And now let us decide how we are to act.  We must not resist, if they\nattempt to impress the men?\"\n\n\"I've been thinking upon that matter, Mr Easy, and it appears to me\nthat the men must be permitted to act as they please, and that we must\nbe neuter.  I, as a lieutenant in his Majesty's service, cannot of\ncourse act, neither can Mr Gascoigne.  You are not in the service, but\nI should recommend you to do the same.  That the men have a right to\nresist, if possible, is admitted; they always do so, and never are\npunished for so doing.  Under the guns of the frigate, of course, we\nshould only have to submit; but those two boats do not contain more than\ntwenty-five men, I should think, and our men are the stronger party.  We\nhad better leave it to them, and stand neuter.\"\n\n\"Dat very good advice,\" said Mesty; \"leab it to us;\" and Mesty walked\naway forward where the seamen were already in consultation.\n\nJack also agreed to the prudence of this measure, and he perceived that\nthe seamen, after a consultation with Mesty, were all arming themselves\nfor resistance.\n\nThe boats were now close on board, and English colours were hoisted at\nthe gaff.  This did not, however, check the impetus of the boats, which,\nwith their ensigns trailing in the still water astern of them, dashed\nalongside, and an officer leaped on board, cutlass in hand, followed by\nthe seamen of the frigate.  The men of the _Rebiera_ remained collected\nforward--Easy, Gascoigne, and Oxbelly aft.\n\n\"What vessel is this?\" cried the lieutenant who commanded the boats.\n\nJack, with the greatest politeness, took off his hat, and told him that\nit was the _Rebiera_ letter of marque, and that the papers were ready\nfor his inspection.\n\n\"And the other vessels?\"\n\n\"Prizes to the _Rebiera_, cut out of Malaga Bay,\" replied Jack.\n\n\"Then you are a privateer,\" observed the disappointed officer.  \"Where\nare your papers?\"\n\n\"Mr Oxbelly, oblige me by bringing them up,\" said Jack.\n\n\"Fat Jack of the bone house,\" observed the lieutenant, looking at\nOxbelly.\n\n\"A lieutenant in his Majesty's service, of longer standing than\nyourself, young man,\" replied Oxbelly firmly;--\"and who, if he ever\nmeets you in any other situation--will make you answer for your insolent\nremark.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" observed the lieutenant ironically; \"now, if you had said you\nwere once a boatswain or gunner.\"\n\n\"Consider yourself kicked,\" roared Oxbelly, losing his temper.\n\n\"Hey day! why, you old porpoise!\"\n\n\"Sir,\" observed Jack, who listened with indignation, \"Mr Oxbelly is a\nlieutenant in his Majesty's service, and you have no right to insult\nhim, even if he were not.\"\n\n\"I presume you are all officers,\" replied the lieutenant.\n\n\"I am, sir,\" retorted Gascoigne, \"an officer in his Majesty's service,\nand on board of this vessel by permission of Captain Sawbridge of the\n_Latona_.\"\n\n\"And I was, until a few months ago, sir,\" continued Jack; \"at present I\nam captain and owner of this vessel--but here are the papers.  You will\nhave no obstruction from us in the execution of your duty--at the same\ntime, I call upon the two young gentlemen by your side, and your own\nmen, to bear witness to what takes place.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well, sir--just as you please.  Your papers I perceive are all\nright.  Now you will oblige me by mustering your men.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir,\" replied Jack; \"send all the men aft to muster, Mr\nOxbelly.\"\n\nThe men came aft to the mainmast, with Mesty at their head, and answered\nto their names.  As the men passed over, the lieutenant made a\npencil-mark against ten of them, who appeared the finest seamen; and,\nwhen the roll had been called, he ordered those men to get their bags\nand go into the boat.\n\n\"Sir, as you must observe, I am short-handed, with my men away in\nprizes; and I, as commander of this vessel, protest against this\nproceeding: if you insist upon taking them, of course I can do nothing,\"\nobserved Jack.\n\n\"I do insist, sir; I'm not going on board empty-handed, at all events.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I can say no more,\" said Jack, walking aft to the taffrail,\nto which Oxbelly and Gascoigne had retreated.\n\n\"Come, my lads, get those men in the boat,\" said the lieutenant.\n\nBut the men had all retreated forward in a body, with Mesty at their\nhead, and had armed themselves.  Some of the seamen of the frigate had\ngone forward, in obedience to their officer, to lead the men selected\ninto the boat; but they were immediately desired to keep back.  The\nscuffle forward attracted the notice of the lieutenant, who immediately\nsummoned all his men out of the boats.\n\n\"Mutiny, by heavens!  Come up, all of you, my lads.\"\n\nMesty then came forward, with a sabre in one hand and a pistol in the\nother, and thus addressed the seamen of the frigate:\n\n\"I tell you dis, my lads--you not so strong as we--you not got better\narms--we not under gun of frigate now, and we ab determination not to go\nboard.  'Pose you want us, come take us--'pose you can.  By all de\npower, but we make mince-meat of you, anyhow.\"\n\nThe seamen paused--they were ready to fight for their country, but not\nto be killed by or kill those who were their own countrymen, and who\nwere doing exactly what they would have done themselves.  The lieutenant\nthought otherwise; he was exasperated at this sensation.\n\n\"You black scoundrel, I left you out because I thought you not worth\nhaving, but now I'll add you to the number.\"\n\n\"Stop a little,\" replied Mesty.\n\nThe lieutenant would not take the Ashantee's very prudent advice; he\nflew forward to seize Mesty, who striking him a blow with the flat of\nhis sabre, almost levelled him to the deck.  At this the men and other\nofficers of the frigate darted forward; but after a short scuffle, in\nwhich a few wounds were received, were beaten back into the boats.  The\nlieutenant was thrown in after them, by the nervous arm of Mesty--and,\nassailed by cold shot and other missiles, they sheered off with\nprecipitation, and pulled back in the direction of the frigate.\n\n\"There will be a row about this,\" said Oxbelly, \"as soon as they come\nclear of the vessel.  If the frigate gets hold of us she will show us no\nmercy.  There is a breeze coming from the north-west.  How fortunate! we\nshall be three leagues to windward, and may escape.\"\n\n\"I doubt if she could catch us at any point of sailing: they may come up\nwith the prizes, but can do nothing with them.\"\n\n\"No, the boats which boarded them are already returned to the frigate;\nshe must wait for them, and that will give us a start and it will be\nnight before they can even make sail.\"\n\n\"Fire a gun for the prizes to close,\" said Jack; \"we will put the men on\nboard again, and then be off to Palermo as fast as we can.\"\n\n\"We can do no better,\" said Oxbelly.  \"If ever I chance to meet that\nfellow again, I will trouble him to repeat his words.  Trim the sails,\nmy lads.\"\n\n\"His language was unpardonable,\" observed Jack.\n\n\"Since I've been in the service, Mr Easy, I have always observed that\nsome officers appear to imagine that, because they are under the king's\npennant, they are warranted in insulting and tyrannising over all those\nwho have not the honour to hoist it; whereas the very fact of their\nbeing king's officers should be an inducement to them to show an example\nof courtesy and gentlemanly conduct in the execution of their duty,\nhowever unpleasant it may be.\"\n\n\"It is only those who, insignificant themselves, want to make themselves\nof importance by the pennant they serve under,\" replied our hero.\n\n\"Very true, Mr Easy; but you are not aware that a great part of the\nill-will shown to the service, is owing to the insolence of those young\nmen in office.  The king's name is a warrant for every species of\ntyranny and unwarrantable conduct.  I remember Mrs Oxbelly telling one\nof them, when--\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Mr Oxbelly,\" interrupted Jack, \"but we have no time\nto chat now; the breeze is coming down fast, and I perceive the prizes\nare closing.  Let us lower down the boat, send the men on board again,\nand give them their orders--which I will do in writing, in case they\npart company.\"\n\n\"Very true, sir.  It will be dark in half an hour, and as we are now\nstanding inshore, they will think that we intend to remain on the coast.\nAs soon as it is quite dark we will shape our course for Palermo.  I\nwill go down and look at the chart.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FORTY ONE.\n\nWHICH WINDS UP THE NAUTICAL ADVENTURES OF MR. MIDSHIPMAN EASY.\n\nIn half an hour the prizes were again alongside, the men put on board,\nand the boat hoisted up.  The frigate still remained becalmed to\nleeward, and hoisted in her boats.  They watched until she was hid by\nthe shades of night, and then wearing round stood away, with the wind\ntwo points free, for the coast of Sicily.  The next morning when the sun\nrose there was nothing in sight.  Strange anomaly, in a state of high\ncivilisation, where you find your own countrymen avoided and more\ndreaded than even your foes!\n\nThe run was prosperous, the weather was fine, and the prizes did not\npart company.\n\nOn the sixteenth day the _Rebiera_ and her convoy anchored in Palermo\nBay.  The wind was light in the morning that they stood in, and as Jack\nhad a large blue flag with _Rebiera_ in white letters hoisted at the\nmain, Don Philip and Don Martin were on board and greeting our hero,\nbefore the _Rebiera's_ anchor had plunged into the clear blue water.\n\nThe information which our hero received, after having been assured of\nthe health of Agnes and her parents, was satisfactory.  The\ndisappearance of the friar had, at first, occasioned much surprise;--but\nas the servants of Don Rebiera swore to his return without the black,\nand the letter of Don Rebiera, sent to the convent, requesting his\npresence, was opened and read, there was no suspicion against the\nfamily.  A hundred conjectures had been afloat, but gradually they had\nsubsided, and it was at last supposed that he had been carried off by\nthe banditti, some of whom had been taken, and acknowledged that they\nhad seized a friar on a day which they could not recollect.  The reader\nwill remember that it was Mesty.\n\nThe _Rebiera_ received pratique, and Jack hastened on shore with Don\nPhilip and his brother, and was once more in company of Agnes, who, in\nour hero's opinion, had improved since his departure.  Most young men in\nlove think the same after an absence, provided it is not too long.  The\nprizes were sold and the money distributed, and every man was satisfied,\nas the cargoes fetched a larger sum than they had anticipated.\n\nWe must pass over the _pros_ and _cons_ of Don Rebiera and his lady, the\npleading of Jack for immediate nuptials, the unwillingness of the mother\nto part with her only daughter, the family consultation, the dowry, and\nall these particulars.  A month after his arrival Jack was married, and\nwas, of course, as happy as the day was long.\n\nA few days afterwards, Mr Oxbelly advised departure, as the expenses of\nthe vessel were heavy, and it was his duty so to do.  Don Philip and Don\nMartin obtained leave to go to England, with their sister and her\nhusband.  Nevertheless, Jack, who found Palermo a very pleasant\nresidence, was persuaded by the Don and his wife to remain there a\nmonth, and then there was crying and sobbing, and embracing, and\nembarking; and at last the _Rebiera_, whose cabins had been arranged for\nthe reception of the party, weighed and made sail for Malta, Jack having\npromised to call upon the Governor.\n\nIn four days they anchored in Valette harbour, and Jack paid his\nrespects to his old friend, who was very glad to see him.  The Governor\nsent his own barge for Mrs Easy, and she was installed in the state\napartments, which were acknowledged to be very comfortable.  Our hero\nhad, as usual, a long story to tell the Governor, and the Governor\nlistened to it very attentively, probably because he thought it would be\nthe last, which opportunity Jack employed to narrate the unfortunate end\nof his father.\n\n\"I would not have said so at the time, Mr Easy, but now the wound is\nhealed, I tell you that it is the best thing that could have happened--\npoor old gentleman! he was mad, indeed.\"\n\nOur hero remained a fortnight at Malta, and then Signora Easy was\nre-embarked, and once more the _Rebiera_ made sail.\n\n\"Fare you well, my lad; what I have seen of your brothers-in-law pleases\nme much; and as for your wife, it will be your own fault if she is not\nall that you would wish.  If ever I come to England again, I will pay my\nfirst visit to Forest Hill.  God bless you!\"\n\nBut Sir Thomas never did go back to England, and this was their final\nadieu.  Once more the _Rebiera_ pursued her course, stopped a day or two\nat Gibraltar, shared the proceeds of the captured gun-boat, and then\nmade sail for England, where she arrived without adventure or accident\nin three weeks.\n\nThus ended the last cruise of Mr Midshipman Easy.  As soon as their\nquarantine at the Mother-bank was over, they disembarked, and found Dr\nMiddleton and Mr Hanson waiting for them at the George Hotel.  Our hero\nhad scarcely time to introduce his wife, when the waiter said that a\nlady wished to speak to him.  She did not wait to know if Jack was\nvisible, but forced her way past him.  Jack looked at her large\nproportions, and decided at once that it must be Mrs Oxbelly, in which\nconjecture he was right.\n\n\"Pray, sir, what do you mean by carrying off my husband in that way?\"\nexclaimed the lady, red with anger.\n\n\"God forbid that I should have to carry your husband, Mrs Oxbelly; he\nis rather too heavy.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, but it's little better than kidnapping, and there's a law for\nkidnapping children at all events.  I shall send my lawyer to you, that\nyou may depend upon.\"\n\n\"You hardly can consider your husband as a child, Mrs Oxbelly,\" replied\nJack, laughing.\n\n\"Very well, sir, we shall see.  Pray, where is he now?\"\n\n\"He is on board, Mrs Oxbelly, and will be delighted to see you.\"\n\n\"I'm not quite so sure of that.\"\n\n\"He's very anxious to see little Billy,\" said Gascoigne.\n\n\"What do you know of little Billy, young man?\"\n\n\"And more than anxious to be on shore again.  He's quite tired of\nsleeping single, Mrs Oxbelly.\"\n\n\"Ah, very well, he has been talking, has he? very well,\" exclaimed the\nlady in a rage.\n\n\"But,\" said Easy, \"I am happy to say that, with pay and prize-money,\nduring his short absence, he has brought home nearly five hundred\npounds.\"\n\n\"Five hundred pounds--you don't say so, sir?\" exclaimed Mrs Oxbelly;\n\"are you sure of that?\"\n\n\"Quite sure,\" rejoined Gascoigne.\n\n\"Five hundred pounds!--Well, that is comfortable--dear me! how glad I\nshall be to see him!  Well, Mr Easy, it was hard to part with him in so\nunhandsome a way--but all's for the best in this world.  What a dear,\nnice lady your wife is, Mr Easy--but I won't intrude--I beg pardon.\nWhere is the brig, Mr Easy?\"\n\n\"Now coming into the harbour,\" replied Gascoigne: \"if you bargain you\ncan get off for twopence.\"\n\n\"Five hundred pounds!\" exclaimed Mrs Oxbelly, whose wrath was now\nappeased.\n\n\"By all power, she no fool of a woman dat,\" said Mesty, as she retreated\ncurtseying; \"I tink Mr Oxbelly very right sleep tingle.\"\n\nWe have now come to the end of our hero's adventures; that afternoon\nthey all started for Forest Hill, where everything was ready for their\nreception.  The _Rebiera's_ men were paid off, and were soon distributed\non board of his Majesty's ships; the vessel was sold, and Mr Oxbelly\nretired to Southsea, to the society of his wife and little Billy.\nWhether he obtained from his wife a divorce _de thoro_, is not handed\ndown.\n\nOur hero, who was now of age, invited all within twenty miles of home to\nballs and dinners; became a great favourite, kept a pack of hounds, rode\nwith the foremost, received a deputation to stand for the county on the\nconservative interest, was elected without much expense, which was very\nwonderful, and took his seat in parliament.  Don Philip and Don Martin,\nafter two months' stay, took their passage back to Palermo, fully\nsatisfied with the prospects of their sister as to competence and\nhappiness.  Jack had no occasion to argue the point with Agnes; she\nconformed at once to the religion of her husband, proved an excellent\nand affectionate wife, and eventually the mother of four children, three\nboys and a girl.\n\nMesty held his post with dignity, and proved himself trustworthy.\nGascoigne, by the interest of the conservative member, soon obtained the\nrank of post-captain, and was always his devoted and sincere friend.\nAnd thus ends the history of Mr Midshipman Easy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Mr. Midshipman Easy, by Captain Frederick Marryat\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MR.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":791,"split":"train"}
